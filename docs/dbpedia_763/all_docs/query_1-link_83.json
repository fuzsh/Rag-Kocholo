Long An ability to understand the hybrid nature of culture develops from an experience of dealing with a dominant culture from the outside. —Guillermo Gómez Peña, The New World Border Naming our others means understanding them and accepting them in the multiplicity of their differences.â•¯.â•¯.â•¯. But more importantly, there is something radically democratic in admitting that many times we do not know how to name our others. —Néstor García Canclini, La globalización imaginada\n\nF\n\nrom the perspective of today’s global village, change arrives with the speed of the Internet, and news of altered realities arrives even faster. Writings on the Mexican-U.S.-Chicano relationships that came to the forefront of international and domestic consciousness in the 1960s and 1970s constitute a wellaged literary and ideological tradition, much of which has now come under the umbrella term “borderland studies.” Texts such as Miguel Méndez’s Peregrinos de Aztlán (1974), Ernesto Galarza’s Barrio Boy (1971), The Collected Stories of Amado Muro (1979), Tino Villanueva’s anthology Chicanos (1980), and Gloria Anzaldúa’s groundbreaking Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza (1987) were strikingly original and controversial discourses that shocked us all into a new awareness of the importance of the shaky line that had historically done such a questionable job of dividing North from South, first world from third, the United States from Mexico, rendering the two countries neighbors in little but the word. As collections such as Aztlán: Essays on the Chicano Homeland began to come out in the late 1980s and 1990s, their authors were already looking back on the time when Mexican immigrants and subsequent-generation Mexican Americans were institu-\n\n1\n\n2\n\nMEXICO READING THE UNITED STATES\n\ntionalizing the myths that would underlie much of today’s writing about the new world border. And even then, that terrain was an intermediate space experiencing radical economic, political, cultural, and conceptual expansions. Affirmative action was already in place throughout public and private institutions in North America. Bilingual education was a fixture in public schools. Some were already debating the official language of California. Congress was grappling with immigration control at the permeable Mexican-U.S. border. Hispanic population as a percentage of the total North American census was climbing fast. Entrepreneurs were beginning to publish Spanish-language newspapers and business magazines from coast to coast. Californians visiting Massachusetts missed their salsa. At the border itself, the maquiladoras—the factories owned and operated by Americans and Mexicans employing cheap Mexican labor—were turning El Paso/Juárez and San Diego/ Tijuana into bilateral megacities that shared shabby barrios on both sides of the ephemeral line demarcating their sovereign separation. These changes suggest that in many ways the border can no longer be “located at any fixed geopolitical site” (Gómez-Peña 750). The thirteen essays included in this volume, published here for the first time, insert themselves into the multilayered discourse of this lived and transcribed tradition of bilateral realities. They read various aspects of the U.S. experience from the Mexican side of the metaphorically disputed border, finding their texts in literature and other cultural artifacts such as film, but in every instance holding a Mexican point of view. Often that is not an easy distinction to make or maintain, particularly in relation to the blended societies presented in some of the most recent works analyzed here. Comprehensive examinations of the Mexican perspective on the United States are underrepresented in the scholarship; we speak of studies in which Mexico is seen to generate meanings about North America rather than viewed as an object of analysis in relation to the United States. The vast majority of borderland studies and literary production originates from a North American perspective. These can be generated in universities or government think tanks. They can also emerge from artistic works identified with the Chicano aesthetic and ideology, despite Mexican art critic Gabriel Trujillo Muñoz’s observation, regarding the relationship of Mexican, U.S., and Chicano art, that “one of the most common errors of judgment into which many critics have fallen [is] that of considering border art as a Chicano aesthetic produced on this side of the line” (“Art and the Border” 30).1 In a similar vein, U.S. university critics have long engaged in the hunt for evidence of North American and European influences in Mexican literary works, implicitly hinting that without John Dos Passos, William Faulkner, or Kafka, Mexico’s most preeminent fiction icons—such as Carlos Fuentes, Juan José Arreola, or even Juan Rulfo—might not have risen to the meteoric heights they have reached. More recent scholarship has proposed that “discussion of the United States by Mexican intellectuals is rarely intended as an end in itself, but rather as a discursive means\n\nLinda Egan and Mary K. Long\n\nto explain and create a narrative on Mexico” (Morris 160).2 Alan Riding offers another angle on the apparent lack of Mexican analysis of the United States in a recent edition of his classic portrait of the Mexicans: “While Mexico has vainly demanded to be understood by the United States, .â•¯.â•¯. it has made little attempt of its own to understand its neighbor.” To elaborate, Riding quotes Mexican historian Daniel Cosío: “One of the Mexican’s most disconcerting traits is his Olympian intellectual disdain for the United States, which he secretly envies, while blaming it for all his ills and which he has never tried to understand” (327).3 Put another way: “Thanks to massive migrations, the one that remains and the one that leaves, [both rural and urban realities in Mexico] discover their promised land, that which they left behind and that which they will never reach. Through the intervention of millions of Mexican individuals living on the outside, the Mexico still living within can verify the velocity of the changes it experiences” (Monsiváis, “De los otros aportes de los migrantes” [Of Other Migrant Benefits] 18).4 This collection of essays thus chooses the road less traveled in the borderlands, one that will lead our readers to see the United States through the eyes of creative Mexicans who ponder the centuries-old conundrums of our binational conflicts from their point of view—who hold a mirror to our face and invite us to see ourselves as they do, and not as we think they might or ought to be thinking of us. Their opinions—running the gamut from hostile to comical, neutral, inspiring, clichéd, profound, or surprising—come at a crucial juncture in the history of bilateral relations, as Mexican political commentator Enrique Krauze reminded us during a PBS television interview a few years ago: “You have Mexico within the United States. It’s not just a neighbor.â•¯.â•¯.â•¯. It’s also a partner. A very important commercial partner .â•¯.â•¯. [and] you have 20 million Mexicans within the borders of the United States, and that is changing American culture, and it’s bound to change it both ways. It’s changing Mexican culture, and American culture” (1). Yet, despite the transcendent import of shared interests involving human border traffic, poverty, nutrition, health, water, air pollution, hazardous waste disposal, economic development, distribution of wealth, and countless other vital concerns, “there is little if any cross-border communication.” Overwhelming statistical evidence “suggests that most border problems are resolved on an ad hoc basis,” if at all (Herzog 254): “The enormous political-economic polarization between the United States and Mexico has impeded the evolution of any sustained form of transboundary cooperation in the management of .â•¯.â•¯. problems.â•¯.â•¯.â•¯. The two nations cling to their sovereignty and, at this time, seem reluctant to trade off control over national territorial destiny for the recognition of a transboundary ‘community of interests’â•–” (256–57). At the same time, Mexican news coverage of the border region is rigorous because it represents one of the nation’s key economic resources (Herzog 10)—directly, because of the enormous number of its citizens employed there, and, indirectly, because of the even greater number of its citizens who cross from that\n\n3\n\n4\n\nMEXICO READING THE UNITED STATES\n\njumping-off point over to the other side, thus relieving Mexico of the burden of providing jobs and social services for them (Grayson 2, 4, 7–8).5 Celebrated Mexican journalist and author Elena Poniatowska, speaking in November 2007 on a U.S. university campus, chided her government for failing to provide jobs and opportunities for Mexicans forced to migrate to the United States. According to Martín Martínez’s description of the event, Poniatowska said that remittances from her compatriots living in the United States are keeping Mexico afloat economically, something that no domestic leader should brag about, as did former president Vicente Fox, who left office in 2006: “It’s not possible that Fox is saying he’s proud of the fact that remittances are the second-largest source of income (for Mexico), instead of creating jobs. If those people had jobs, they wouldn’t feel the need to abandon their country.” She described a gardener she had met years earlier in California who lived in fear of the U.S. Border Patrol: “Every time the Border Patrol would drive by he would jump into the bushes. I asked him how he could live like that—always fearful and in danger. He said he would rather live with fear than live in Mexico because at least here if he died his body wouldn’t be left to rot and be eaten by the buzzards.” Poniatowska cited Zacatecas as an example of a state in which the local government relies “on remittances rather than internal economic growth, where 90 percent of families receive assistance from relatives living and working in the United States” (Martínez). Poverty is not the only factor that pushes millions of Mexicans illegally to the United States. There are other, complex circumstances that cause them to want to leave their country (García y Griego 86–87), but economic need (and the availÂ� ability of jobs in the North, which depends on their presence to “remain competitive, keep inflation in check, enjoy the fruits of cheap labor, etc.” [Payan 84]), is nonetheless the overriding cause.6 Of course, immigrants do not always or even usually leave poverty behind when they manage to find a niche in the land of opportunity: Hispanics tend to have some of the lowest socioeconomic indicators in the country. “Hispanics are projected to comprise about 25% of the total population of the United States by the year 2050; in a hundred years, Hispanics will outnumber non-Hispanic whites in this country” (Ramos xvii). “As the country becomes more Hispanic, the poverty factor does not bode well for the border states—or for the nation as a whole” (Payan 137). Payan points with his statistics to the need to unite the Mexican and U.S. societies more closely through more effective bilateral cooperation at the government level, including U.S. help with the Mexican external debt and Mexican development of civil and economic opportunities for domestic advancement: a sustained joint effort, in short, to relieve suffering and the psychic pressures that feed xenophobic racism and class consciousness. Six of the essays in this collection address the issues of immigration, Mexican identity, and the phenomenon of transculturation directly, while in others the subject of the Americanization of Mexico is a more or less implicit thread in a dis-\n\nLinda Egan and Mary K. Long\n\ncourse explicitly focused on different concerns. In a way, immigration has become a dual metaphor for cultural contact and sociopolitical influence, if not outright control, themes which course through this anthology as leitmotifs fraught with ironic contradiction. The irony, of course, is implicit in the fact that Mexico invited U.S. colonists into Texas in the early 1800s and then could not stop the flow—and soon after lost that territory and much more as a result of the war of 1847, which Andrés Reséndez and José Emilio Pacheco rightly call the unjust war (9–31) in their beautifully written and illustrated Crónica de 47. The corollary irony, also implicit, is that the United States invited Mexican guest workers into the country during World War II to help resolve a labor shortage and—no surprise—could not then, nor can it now, stop the flow. In a very real way, it is in the process of “losing” Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California—as well as other unforeseen chunks of North America—right back to Mexico: “Texas is now 38 percent Hispanic; New Mexico is 43 percent Hispanic; Arizona is 30 percent Hispanic; and California is 35 percent Hispanic. Nevada and Colorado now have large Hispanic populations as well” (Payan 137). The contradictions—also amply illustrated in this anthology—enter into discourse when “fear and anxiety” brought about by such a rapid transformation in the assumed cultural identity of a society cause disorientation and resentment (Suárez-Orozco and Páez 42–43). Speaking either of Americanized Mexico or LatÂ� inized America, the reaction is perhaps merely a schizophrenic love-hate attitude that we have identified as another leitmotif strongly present throughout this volume. It’s the tone of voice that one former Mexican citizen uses, for example, when he announces in a poem he calls “Naturalization”: Now I am officially American. So what? .â•¯.â•¯. I wish the judge would hurry up, give the room full of Vietnamese and Mexicans and a few French, Koreans, Italians and Chinese their paper awards that allow them to claim a history of slavery and murderous imperialism as their own. Now we can profit from the inequality of this country, we can exploit our own race more freely, we can celebrate the fourth of july .â•¯.â•¯. .â•¯.â•¯. I have nothing to celebrate. (García 110–11)\n\n5\n\n6\n\nMEXICO READING THE UNITED STATES\n\nWe recognize it especially in the dichotomy “spirit-material,” cited in a majority of these essays by Mexicans discomfited by their attraction to things American or just to the United States itself. They are drawn to a better economic life and perhaps even to the freedoms so much promised in this land, but then they feel compelled to qualify their impulse to transmigrate as something like a betrayal of national origin. They condemn U.S. materialist consumerism in high contrast to their culture’s historical emphasis on spiritual values, a dualism detailed elsewhere by Alan Riding; he concludes a long characterization of the Mexican as a being governed by “the predominance of the spiritual over the material,” as well as by a profound connection to the past, which tends to dictate perspectives on the present and future (5, 14–15). Students of Carlos Fuentes know that his entire work dramatizes the eternal presence of the pre-Hispanic past in contemporary Mexican life. Similarly, well-known culture theorist Néstor García Canclini is struck by the apparent paradox in Octavio Paz’s promotion of modernity in Mexican literature while pursuing at the same time a constant return to the premodern roots of his society (cited in Saldívar 31). Understanding this aspect of the Mexican character helps explain the psychic paradox implicit in many essays of this volume, as well as elsewhere in Mexican writings about the United States, for it is the very material well-being that the United States possesses that compels Mexicans to leave their country, often at risk to their lives, and that most do not abandon once they too possess some of it, even in small measure. They return to visit family and friends in Mexico, but seldom to live there again permanently. This angst—what Herzog calls a “friction-fusion” relationship (249)—leads to the related discourse of cultural identity (either the loss of it or the need to protect it), another dominant theme of this collection. Carlos Monsiváis, for one, places the question in a dryly pragmatic context. For him, any notion of purity—or even superiority—of culture merely “emphasizes the idea that culture is being protected by a people who, at the middle-class level, want nothing more than to be like their American models, and who, at the mass level, have no material resources or cultural organizations with which to achieve such a desirable ethnicity” (“Culture of the Frontier” 53). To Mexicans who criticize barrio gang members for wearing American blue jeans or an indigenous girl for trekking off to the jungle with a U.S. boombox on her shoulder, thus destroying national efforts to preserve the native Mexican culture, Monsiváis offers a more compassionate—and historically realistic—viewpoint: “How can we condemn .â•¯.â•¯. the youth of the lower classes who, as they Americanize themselves on diverse levels, believe that they are thus exorcizing their thunderous lack of a future?” (“Duración de la eternidad” 42).7 Do not, in short, worry that buying American products is going to drain Mexico of its cultural spirit (whatever that is), says Monsiváis: “Resistance to ‘Americanization’ is only weak because the seduction is not, in principle, ideological but technological: How can anyone say no to comfort?” (“Para un cuadro” 94).8\n\nLinda Egan and Mary K. Long\n\nThe argument about cultural purity and superiority in Mexico festered as far back as 1847, albeit among a very small, informed minority. Mexico had been virtually committing slow suicide since Independence, with constant civil war; economic bankruptcy; an isolated, uneducated, poverty-stricken and therefore apathetic citizenry; and, in short, a national being that was close to anarchy, with almost all its resources centered in the capital. After years of futilely fending off American encroachment in Texas, New Mexico, and others of its underpopulated and undefended northern territories, and in the midst of a poorly managed and devastatingly unequal war, during which the common citizen often cheered the Yankees more than the Mexican army (see Crónica de 47), some Mexican government officials and intellectuals held secret talks about turning Mexico over to the United States: Let’s just let Americans run the country and be done with on-again, off-again dictators and vendepatrias (sell-outs) like Santa Anna, the thinking went, and maybe they can save us from ourselves. Among those who seriously considered such a plan were some of Mexico’s most illustrious thinkers and writers: Guillermo Prieto, Mariano Otero, Manuel Payno (Reséndez and Pacheco 23).9 Some of these men had traveled to the United States. Common threads run through the reports they pen on their return: The worst that America has to offer is better than the best that Mexico can produce (Prieto 1:32–35); would that Mexico’s education system, like America’s, were actually about learning rather than inculcation of ideology (Prieto 1:149; Cuéllar 22–25); why can’t we have a postal system in Mexico that in fact delivers letters, or even allows businesses to prosper by sending products through the mail? (Prieto 1:235–38; Cuéllar 89). Viewing the Mexican collection of the Bancroft Library, Prieto was sadly awestruck (1:207). Gutiérrez Nájera, who is otherwise hostile toward the predatory North American giant, observes how the unemployed workers of Coxey’s Army marched, unmolested, on the government in Washington, D.C., in 1894, “like a caravan of pilgrims to Mecca .â•¯.â•¯. vaguely conscious of their right to do so” (192);10 the poet exclaims with admiration over the Americans’ evident trust in the law and sees the march as a symbol of a democracy Mexico had not yet grasped in concept or in fact. What Gutiérrez Nájera was seeing was a piece of the “whole package” that the United States offered—and still offers—immigrants from the world over, as “the first modern nation to free itself deliberately from the fetters of colonialism and to repudiate feudal notions of privilege, .â•¯.â•¯. that guaranteed its inhabitants ‘certain inalienable rights,’ .â•¯.â•¯. including freedom of religion, the press, and assembly” (Wills 7). To be clear on this point: It is not that U.S. citizens are nicer than people elsewhere; we share the global human propensity to practice racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, xenophobia, and all other evil that people can do unto each other. What underlies the ugly top layer of shameful behavior, however, is a tried and still-true system of law based on civil and human rights that somehow persistently makes desire for justice, change for the better, and patient upward mobility the bedrock characteristics of our culture. Specific or inchoate knowledge\n\n7\n\n8\n\nMEXICO READING THE UNITED STATES\n\nof that promise is what ultimately pulls immigrants toward what Wills calls “destination America” from virtually every corner of the world, knowing that hard times await them, yet believing that better times will come. In this context, several of our contributors have selected themes that explore the historical anxiety that Mexico, among other newly formed Latin American nations, faced as its inhabitants compared themselves to those of the United States and Europe in their struggle to forge viable national projects and world-class, yet independent, aesthetic expressions to embody the spirit of those new societies. Perhaps the overriding theme of this collection recalls the tension between two economic structures in transition: the more traditional culture of the less industrialized, less consumer-oriented economy of Mexico versus the assumed superiority (from both the Mexican and U.S. points of view) of the comforts of materialism and modernization of North America. Closely related to this first theme is the subcategory of an intermittent interest in the political and personal freedoms proposed by the democratic model followed in the United States. These ultimately are the central debates today about globalization in which critics see the imperatives of consumer society overwhelming traditional societies and the capitalist economic model overpowering the democratic political model. Can democracy reap the benefits of capitalism, but also check its excesses? This is the question many Mexican intellectuals have asked since at least the early 1990s. The arrangement of this collection highlights the historical evolution of these and related tensions over time and shows Mexico as it evolves into a skilled critic and modifier of the methods prescribed by the United States for those who wish to achieve fuller freedom. Each part responds to the example that the United States has historically presented for its southern neighbor. Mexico’s readings exemplify strategies to define material comfort and freedoms according to the needs of its own cultural imperatives.\n\nSeparate and Unequal: Mexico Struggles for Autonomy, 1920–1960 The essays in Part I, encompassing chapters one through four and covering the historical period from the end of the Mexican Revolution to 1960 set the stage for the evolution of the cultural and political tensions just described by offering new critical angles on texts from the period. These essays will broaden the reader’s understanding of familiar debates that assume two principal stances: the first, the wellknown rejection of North American utilitarianism in defense of Hispanic culture’s spiritualist base, a reflection of José Enrique Rodó’s arielist notions; the second, a willingness on Mexico’s part to experiment with the practical benefits of material well-being and personal liberties offered by the more individualistic U.S. society.11 The adaptation of North American models represented in the first four chapters is pragmatic, not yet taking the shape of a political movement; the two states are still perceived as spaces that one can enter and exit, in spite of the increasing movement of products and media between them.\n\nLinda Egan and Mary K. Long\n\nInseparable Differences: Mexico Adapts U.S. Models, 1960–1990s The next four chapters, Part II, cover the period from 1960 through the 1990s and have as common themes how Mexicans deal with the ever-present anguish of deciding whether or how to live with the temptations and tribulations of the “superior” and always influential United States from within a clearly defined Mexican state. This angst develops around such issues as civil rights, literary trends, and questions of identity. As Stephen Morris has noted in Gringolandia, often the United States is mainly a backdrop against which Mexico struggles to define itself while inevitably being unable to entirely reject ready-made U.S. models. At the same time, the essays here highlight more direct responses to the United States as an exemplary object. They all depart from a U.S. model traditionally held as exemplary and assume a disobedient stance in their interpretation of it, reading it from inside “that second skin we Latinos all live with, although we know very well how to hide it when we need to,” as contributor Oswaldo Estrada wrote in a personal communication to the editors.12 Chapters 5 and 6 reveal how Mexico adapts politically liberating principles that do not follow the methodological rules as they apply the U.S. model (i.e., the shifted priorities of social/economic/ethnic liberation in Monsiváis; the rejection of coming out as an obligatory step in the Mexican gay movement). Chapters 7 and 8 express still more scathing criticism of the U.S. model, because rather than modify political exempla for an internal, non-U.S. end, they reject outright what the United States would consider the best it has to offer: generosity and the charitable spirit, wealth and a more hygienic, organized, and convenient lifestyle. These are redefined in multiple (and almost joyfully) negative ways in spite of the fascination they provoke. In these chapters, the two countries are still represented as separate spaces, in spite of evidence in the texts of more frequent dual national existences.\n\nAt Home with the Other: Mexico Deals with Virtual Nationhood into the Twenty-first Century The last five chapters bring us to the twenty-first century, fraught with its themes of consumerism, neoliberalism, globalization, transculturation, the virtual realities of cyberspace—and the consequences of these issues carried to the extreme. Chapters 9 and 10 analyze fictional representations of the human effects of transnationality and the creative (liberating) but also anguished suffering of individuals in a (U.S.-model) society driven by consumer norms. Chapters 12 and 13 explore nonfiction modes that propose different normative stances for understanding the increasing complexity of our ever more borderless countries, for which the concept and lived reality of nationality is problematical at best. Mediating between these is the linking Chapter 11, in which the spatial issues of online consumption allow a\n\n9\n\n10\n\nMEXICO READING THE UNITED STATES\n\nreader to experience the freedom—and the anxiety—of a landless virtual community that places the “citizen” mentally in Mexico but physically in no-man’s-land, anywhere on the planet. This “empty space” echoes the ways in which the characters in Hind’s binational novels and Chapter 9’s bilingual Diablo Guardián occupy diverse mental and physical spaces simultaneously. This is not to say, however, that Chapter 11 does not also express strong, independently critical Mexican perspectives, as aggressive (and at times as prejudiced) as the U.S. conservative critic of Hispanic immigration in Chapter 12. Mexican perspectives on the United States in these chapters propose new visions of Mexican autonomy, such as the Latino world within the United States that Ramos describes in Chapter 13. In all these essays, the issue of separate spaces and separate cultures of, within, and between the United States and Mexico becomes permanently problematic. The thirteen essays cover a broad and rich range of topics. Still, we are moved to return to Gutiérrez Nájera’s observation of Coxey’s Army as the incarnation of civil society at work in North America; it could be one more contribution to the varied arguments in this volume, a definition of “pure” Mexican culture as (so often in this volume) contrasted to U.S. culture—and it would be submitted by Carlos Monsiváis. It is the one argument missing here, the one definition of U.S. culture not offered—at least explicitly—from the readings of the United States from south of the border that we include in this anthology. We describe it in inverted fashion now—by way of a Mexican yearning to see it in Mexico—to suggest possible future readings by Mexicans taking a close look at their neighbor to the north. Nearly thirty years ago, in a two-part retrospective on the 1970s with the disheartening title “Los de atrás se quedarán” (Those Left Behind Will Remain There), Monsiváis examined his country’s failure to make noticeable progress toward social democracy—job creation; upward mobility; racial, gender, economic, and political equality; criminal justice—all that makes a civil society civil, and named cultural chaos as the raw material of democracy that was wanting: the untamed, unmonitored, free practice of human creative activity (22). Then he defined culture itself as “the forging of a civil society that permits alternatives susceptible to maturation in direct relation to their right to public expression” (42), which we may take as an anachronistic definition of Coxey’s march on Washington.13 Against all evidence of success in his teachings, Monsiváis has continued to lecture his society on this singular cultural point from that 1980 chronicle until today. However, in another retrospective piece, this time a masterful survey of Mexican society from 1985 to 2005, Monsiváis documents his eternal optimism: He enumerates what he now observes as progress his country has made toward the beginnings of a true civil society—toward a stable Mexican culture—since the devastating 1985 earthquake shook the citizenry out of its apathy and galvanized it into the untamed, unmonitored, free practice of altruistic love of fellow human beings. In the chronicle he wrote at that time, he observed how collective selfless action taught anonymous Mexican citizens the value of a single life extracted from\n\nLinda Egan and Mary K. Long\n\nthe ruins (Entrada libre 19–21). In the uplifting title of his recent retrospective examination of postearthquake Mexico, “No sin nosotros” (Never Again without Us, the motto of the EZLN, or Zapatista Movement of Chiapas), Monsiváis finds the metaphor for the civil society he can now perceive rising above the rubble of the natural disaster and the successive political, economic, and social collapses that followed.14 Among other proofs he cites of substantive forward movement toward civil democracy in Mexico, the list he provides includes the fall of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) in 2000, which cracked open a long-awaited door to plurality (52); the gay liberation and feminist movements that broke down crippling barriers to social community (24–29); a change in the meaning of the word “history” from permanent, indelible truth to something merely memorable (52); a beginning, through globalization, of respect for human rights—although high officials and drug traffickers still remain beyond justice’s reach, in small ways there have been Mexican versions of Coxey’s Army getting away with public marches for farmers’ and other human rights (33–35). Monsiváis is prone to making lists, and this eye-opening chronicle is full of them. The items they contain do not always make the news—they are too diffuse to constitute a story that can be published on a given day, representing the author’s own years of observation and synthesis. Yet the events and phenomena he itemizes bear the hallmarks of those verifiable realities that all of Mexico and the world that reads Monsiváis trust him for. And what they describe are markers of a genuine Mexican culture that is becoming ingrained within the national spirit—not subject to colonization, contamination, or contraband. If “cultural battles for diversity constitute one of the major advances toward civil society” (Monsiváis, “No sin nosotros,” 43), then major progress toward civil society constitutes a victory for the defense of Mexican culture, both as an active agent responding to invasive U.S. prerogatives and as a sender, rather than a receiver, of autonomous meanings.15 From a position of widespread inner societal strength, Mexico would no longer need to view the United States as a threat to its cultural authenticity, its political hegemony, or its economic viability, but could confidently criticize and adapt elements the United States has to offer, choosing at will what to accept or reject. The Mexico that has read the United States through this volume has most harshly criticized a materialistic consumer society gone wild. And, while the tensions and contradictions inherent in the simultaneous desire and scorn for material wealth can be called hypocrisy, that is too easy a label to append, for these readings also point out how object fetishism in a consumer society consistently separates individuals from other uses of their talents and resources—and deprives all of society of more humane and productive benefit of that collective human treasure. This criticism, as Maarten Van Delden notes, comes not merely from Mexico, but from within the United States as well. If we view this reading of the United States from such an angle, these Mexican observers are not ungrateful or disloyal users of U.S. space and resources but, rather, modern subjects appraising U.S. practices against a\n\n11\n\n12\n\nMEXICO READING THE UNITED STATES\n\nbroader—let us say transglobal—set of values and goals. The material-versus-spirit argument, which so easily offers itself as a weak defense or justification for bolting from third to first world, becomes instead a truly cross-border, cross-cultural, bilateral search for a more fully rounded human existence in which the United States + Mexico = one much better space for living.\n\nNotes 1. In his 1991 work, Trujillo Muñoz emphasized a radical divide between Mexican border art and that produced by Chicanos: “The visual artists from the North of Mexico have little to do with Chicano iconography and even less with the mythologies that sustain it. It is certain that there are personal contacts among Chicano artists and Mexican border artists, but while Chicano artists have made of the barrio and the celebration of brotherhood an epic where the old nationalist ideals and the public art emanating from Mexican muralism are resuscitated, for border artists, in contrast, the recovery of Mexican muralism is less important, and they pay more attention to the obscure figures .â•¯.â•¯. of the Mexican visual tradition: they prefer to closely follow new, demystified tendencies of international and national visual arts. In each case they want to cast down idols instead of putting up altars” (“Art and the Border” 30). It is worth noting here that recent works in Chicano studies have begun to expand dialogues across the border, although still from the North American side of the line. See, for example, Debra A. Castillo’s Redreaming America: Toward a Bilingual American Culture and her exploration of the dual questions, “What would U.S. literature look like if we included literature from the United States in languages other than English?” and “What would Latin American literature look like if we understood the United States to be a Latin American country?” (14) Tom Miller, in his 2003 Writing on the Edge: A Borderlands Reader, brings together many predominantly Spanish-speaking voices from south and north of the border to consider what gives border writing its unusual scope and texture. 2. Political scientist Stephen Morris in his Gringolandia: Mexican Identity and Perceptions of the United States makes a recent and valuable contribution to the rich scholarship in the fields of political science and history about the U.S.-Mexican relationship. Other key texts in this vast tradition include works by Jorge Castañedas, Robert Pastor, David Lorey, and Andrew Selee, as well as others cited in the body of the introduction. Morris’s work was published in 2005, just as this critical anthology was taking shape, after a number of the contributors had presented papers on the topic at the Mid-America Conference on Hispanic Literature (MACHL) in Colorado in 2003 and the Latin American Studies Association conference in Puerto Rico in 2005. Many of our essayists subsequently read his study and have included references to it. Morris’s book complements and differs from Mexico Reading the United States both in point of view (he examines primarily how the representation of the United States is used to define Mexican identity) and discourses analyzed (he depicts the United States through several media: political speeches, school textbooks, political cartoons, intellectual writings, national cinema, consumption and marketing, and opinion surveys.) 3. Just as there can be no “free Mexican culture .â•¯.â•¯. without economic independence” (Monsiváis, “Culture of the Frontier” 54), there can be no economic independence so long as Mexico continues to fail “to find a social space for its very poorest”\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7. 8. 9.\n\n10.\n\nLinda Egan and Mary K. Long (Guillermoprieto 55). Throughout its history and at least until the end of the PRI’s one-party rule, Mexico’s government displayed “a scavenger’s genius for wasting nothing and no one, and a truly pre-Hispanic vocation for building pyramidal social organizations” that left a tiny clutch of the very rich at the top and a vast mass of disenfranchised poor at the bottom (55). Cultural identity or security and economic safety go hand in hand. “Gracias a las migraciones masivas, el que se queda y el que se va [las realidades rurales y urbanas de México] descubren su tierra prometida, aquella que se dejó y aquella que no se alcanzará. Por intercesión de los millones de personas del México de fuera, el México de dentro verifica la velocidad de sus cambios.” As the United States clusters most of its now heavily militarized resources at the major metropolitan border crossings, Mexican and OTM (Other Than Mexican) immigrants planning their run across the line have established gathering places in isolated points along the two-thousand-mile stretch from Tijuana to Juárez, such as James Johnson’s farm outside Columbus, New Mexico, or the dusty little town of Palomas, which has an inordinate number of hotels for a spot no tourist would be interested in (Payan 53–54). A recently published Pew Hispanic Center poll found that “a full 43 percent of Mexicans would leave Mexico today for the United States if they could” (Payan 61). Although Poniatowska cites remittances from Mexican immigrants in the United States as the second-largest source of income for her country, a 2008 source states that money sent home from workers in North America had reached 128 percent of petroleum earnings by 2005 (Ganster and Lorey 140–41). A statistic like that suggests there is little on the Mexican side of the border, officially or humanly, with the will or the means to slow the tide of Mexican job seekers heading to the United States. These figures may change in the future, of course. For example, a May 2008 New York Times article reports that the recent economic downturn experienced in the United States is having an effect on the confidence of large numbers of immigrants in their ability to find and keep jobs that will allow them to send money home and indicates that these levels may be dropping, though at present it would seem that, as of this year, remittances are holding steady and even growing, but only in comparison to most recent years (Preston). The news demonstrates, as ever, the codependent linkages between Mexico and the United States, at every level, beginning with the economic and moving, as this volume indicates, up into the sociopolitical and cultural. “¿De qué modo condenar .â•¯.â•¯. a los jóvenes de las clases populares, que al americanizarse en diversos niveles creen así exorcizar su estruendosa falta de porvenir?” “La resistencia a ‘la americanización’ resulta débil porque la seducción no es, en principio, ideológica sino tecnológica: ¿cómo decirle que no al confort?” Historian Justo Sierra, whose México, su evolución social was in the mid-twentieth century still must reading for Mexican schoolchildren (Reyes 249), is among those who believed Mexico was incapable of governing itself (Sierra 208–9) and said the War of ’47 was a good kick in the pants for the country and that Mexico should just give Texas and the entire northern Mexico desert to the United States (212), although he much admired Santa Anna’s “benevolent” dictatorship (224–25); held Mexico’s principle problem to be the alcoholic mestizo and Indians’ vagrant nature inherited from the Aztecs (35–36, 96); and, in short, advised his people that they were better off without Texas and California (245). Sierra was secretary of public education under Porfirio Díaz from 1905–1911. “como caravana de peregrinos que va a la Meca .â•¯.â•¯. [con] conciencia vaga, nublada, de un derecho.”\n\n13\n\n14\n\nMEXICO READING THE UNITED STATES 11. José Enrique Rodó (1871–1917), is the Uruguayan essayist who is held to have infused modernism with its cultural spiritualism, and whose seminal work Ariel (1900) may be, more than any other, the source of the now-axiomatic conviction that AngloSaxon America is synonymous with materialism while Latin America is synonymous with spirit. Rodó, allied with Spain’s Leopoldo Alas (Clarín) and famed Nicaraguan modernist Rubén Darío, encouraged Latin America’s youth to reject Anglo-Saxon materialism at a time when the Industrial Revolution was instituting mass production. For Rodó, the values of modern, mechanized capitalism were exemplified in the opposing characters of Shakespeare’s The Tempest—Ariel representing Latin America and Caliban representing North America; he called on Hispanic society to embrace the ancient classical values of cultural autonomy and spiritual enrichment in the face of the specialization (repetitive work) that a modernized industrial society required. It is important to note that twenty years before Rodó’s landmark essay, José Martí had begun grappling with these tensions, which he explored in a number of chronicles written in New York in the 1880s and published in newspapers all over Latin America. See, for example, “Coney Island,” Martí’s magnificent portrait of America in miniature (published in 1881 in Bogota, Colombia), in which he articulates the materialism/spirit dichotomy with melancholy elegance: “Other peoples—ourselves among them—live in prey to a sublime inner demon that drives us to relentless pursuit of an ideal of love or glory.â•¯.â•¯.â•¯. Not so these tranquil [American] spirits, disturbed only by their eagerness to possess wealth. The eyes travel across these reverberating beaches; the traveler goes in and out of these dining rooms, vast as the pampas, and climbs to the tops of these colossal buildings, high as mountains; seated in a comfortable chair by the sea, the passerby fills his lungs with that powerful and salubrious air, and yet it is well known that a sad melancholy steals over the men of our Hispanoamerican peoples who live here.â•¯.â•¯.â•¯. Nostalgia for a superior spiritual world invades and afflicts them .â•¯.â•¯. , and though their eyes may be dry, the frightened spirit breaks into a torrent of the bitterest tears because this great land is devoid of spirit” (92). 12. “esa segunda piel con la que todos los latinos vivimos, aunque sepamos muy bien cómo ocultarla en determinadas situaciones.” 13. “la forja de una sociedad civil que permita otras alternativas susceptibles de madurar en razón directa de su capacidad de expresión pública.” 14. “â•–‘No sin nosotros’ podría ser la consigna generalizada, en la nación que, en lo relativo a la equidad, siempre se ha caracterizado por incluir a casi todos en la exclusión” [“Not without us” could be the overall slogan for the nation which, with respect to equality, has always characterized itself by including almost everyone by excluding them] (Monsiváis, “No sin nosotros” 50). 15. “las batallas culturales por la diversidad constituyen uno de los mayores avances de la sociedad civil.” Works Cited Aguilar Melantzón, Ricardo.

Long\n\nT\n\nhe two decades between 1920 and 1940 mark a unique period in cultural relations between the United States and Mexico. Prior to 1920, “frequent tensions and mutual disdain” (Delpar 7) had prevented either country from learning much about the culture, art, music, and literature produced in the creative spheres of its neighbor. But various general world changes during the first two decades of the twentieth century, in addition to the broader international significance of both Mexico and the United States after World War I and the Mexican Revolution, would lay the groundwork for “a flowering of cultural relations” (7) between Mexico and the United States.1 The central catalyst to this new relationship was the Mexican arts (as expressed both in popular and high culture) and preColumbian culture and artifacts, which enjoyed dramatic popularity and influence in the United States and beyond. In addition, in both countries it was an exhilarating time for the arts and letters, lauded by idealistic artists and utopian thinkers for what the president of Columbia University called (in his speech dedicating the new Academy of the Arts building in New York City in 1930) their power to help “maintain the primacy and the influence on life of the human spirit” in an “age of materialism” (“Academy”).2 Furthermore, the arts and letters were funded from a more pragmatic and imperialistic angle (both privately and by each of the governments, though from different power bases, of course) as vehicles of diplomacy that could promote beneficial political and economic interactions beyond the sphere of the arts by counteracting negative stereotypes.3 Increased travel between the two countries is a significant aspect of this period of cultural relations, and the list of travelers from both countries constitutes a who’s who of the cultural (as well as other public) leaders of the era.4 This increase in travel, along with the combined public and private efforts of utopians and pragmatists alike, generated multiple new meanings for Mexico and the United States during these years.5 Since the 1960s there has been a growing body of scholarship (in a variety of disciplines) dedicated to documenting and understanding the significance of this\n\n21\n\n22\n\nMEXICO READING THE UNITED STATES\n\nperiod and to defining these new meanings.6 However, in much of the scholarship published so far the tendency has been to focus either on the understanding of Mexico developed by visitors from the United States and how this influenced their own work and through it the creative sphere of the United States, as well as the status and meaning assigned to Mexican culture in North America, or on how interest from the United States influenced Mexico’s understanding of itself. Less work has focused on how this period of intense exchange influenced Mexico’s articulation of meanings about its northern neighbor, and, consequently, “scholars still lack a comprehensive perspective that addresses not only politics, art, and social ideas but also the international dimension of the phenomenon, including its equally important United States and Mexican components” (Tenorio-Trillo 226). This essay aims to add to the “comprehensive perspective” on this period by comparing and contrasting the visions of the United States presented in Â�chronicles, letters, autobiographies, and travel texts by a cross section of the foundational twentieth-century Mexican artists and writers who traveled to or lived in the United States during these years. All these texts were subsequently circulated and published in Mexico; the visions of the United States that emerge in them represent a significant contribution to Mexican institutionalized knowledge of U.S. high and popular cultures in the first half of the twentieth century. They are: by famed muralist José Clemente Orozco (1883–1949), sections from his autobiography, which recount visits to the United States (1917–1920, 1928–1936) and letters written from New York between 1927 and 1928 to the French artist Jean Charlot (1898–1979), who spent much of his career in Mexico; letters to painter Manuel Rodríguez de Lozano (1895–1971) written from New York between 1929 and 1930 by Antonieta Rivas Mercado (1900–1931)—writer, influential patron of the arts, and legendary lover of José Vasconcelos (1882–1959); sections from the travel narratives Return Ticket (1928) and Continente vacío (Empty Continent; 1935) by Contemporáneo Salvador Novo (1904–1974), one of the country’s most talented poets and literary journalists in the first half of the century, who was highly controversial because of his publicly proclaimed homosexuality in an intensely homophobic era; letters to Novo written from Yale between 1935 and 1936 by Contemporáneo Xavier Villaurrutia (1903–1950), an equally influential poet and essayist who was also attacked for his more privately expressed homosexuality; and, finally, a select few chronicles from the late 1920s and 1930s of the over seven hundred written by the poet, art critic, and diplomat José Juan Tablada (1871–1945) about New York and life in the United States in general between 1921 and 1940, which were published in numerous Mexican periodicals and finally compiled in 1996 under the title Babilonia de hierro (Iron Babylon).7 Before entering into a detailed analysis of these personal texts, here it is useful to reflect a moment on the nature of travel writing in general and to underline some of the particularities about the contact between the United States and Mexico in the years I am examining. In a recent article, Leila Gómez reminds us\n\nMary K. Long\n\nthat the concepts of power, knowledge, and identity are integral to the travel narrative as a genre (1). These three concepts are also central to any consideration of interactions between the United States and Mexico, as well as to the texts I study here. For though I have introduced this topic with emphasis on the idealistic hopes placed on the arts to improve relations between the countries, it is important to remember that in both nations powerful negative stereotypes of the other existed: Mexican elites regarded North Americans as “vulgar materialists” incapable of distinguishing themselves in “artistic creation or appreciation,” while North Americans in general saw Mexicans through a haze of “racism, ethnocentrism, and antipathy toward Catholicism” and by the end of the Revolution were hard put to conceive of Mexicans as anything but bandits (Delpar 5). During the years studied here, however, the flow of products and information between the two countries increased dramatically, and this expanded the body of cultural details available for the formation of impressions and definitions between the two countries, albeit in a somewhat unbalanced way. For example, the dominance of Hollywood films in the Mexican market during these years meant that Mexicans in general had a better sense of everyday life (or at least the film version of everyday life) in the United States than U.S. nationals did of life in Mexico.8 This dominance also meant that Mexicans were more aware of the stereotypes of Mexicans in the United States than vice versa, and the frequent negative portrayal of Mexicans in U.S. films was a source of extreme tension between the two countries.9 From a more positive angle, the improved flow of news across the border also meant that travelers could stay in touch with events at home. The texts analyzed in this study present both positive and negative aspects of the United States, as well as evidence of the increased flow of film and news; the visions of the United States that emerge in these Mexican discourses provide valuable insights into the new meanings for the country that would emerge in the Mexican imagination during the first half of the twentieth century. A central feature of these new understandings is a more nuanced and flexible concept of the relationship between the two societies that provides a counterpoint to the line of thought (influenced by partial adaptations of the ideas expressed by Jose Enrique Rodó in his essay Arielâ•ƒ) which would have Latin America reject all influence from the United States. For example, these letters and chronicles coincide and contrast in significant ways with José Vasconcelos’s more widely read accounts of travel to and residence in the United States during this same time period, in which he recognizes economic advantages to be found in the United States but is nevertheless gravely concerned by the threat of spiritual conquest and ultimately rejects the idea of any advantages to be gained from cooperation between the two countries; he emphasizes instead the need for Mexico, and Latin America in general, to develop their unique Latin societies and economies independently of the United States.10 In addition, the confidence and independence of thought with which these travelers explore the United States problematize theories developed by Samuel Ramos in\n\n23\n\n24\n\nMEXICO READING THE UNITED STATES\n\nhis landmark psychological and historical analysis of Mexican identity, El perfil del hombre y la cultura en México (Profile of Man and Culture in Mexico; 1934) about a Mexican inferiority complex in relation to metropolitan culture and the limits this complex places on Mexican destiny.11 It is not my intention to reject Ramos’s entire line of thought, but rather to nuance the curiously closed-ended nature of the possibilities he defines for the Mexican future. For example he states: The Mexican never takes into account the reality of his life: that is to say the limitations that history, race, biological conditions impose on his future. The Mexican plans his life as if he were free to choose any of the possibilities that occur to his mind as the most interesting or valuable. He doesn’t know that the horizon of life’s possibilities is very limited for each people or each man. Historical heredity, the ethnic mental structure, the atmospheric peculiarities predetermine the line of life development with a rigidity that individual will cannot alter. We call this destiny. (95)12\n\nUltimately, I see that the letters and chronicles examined here disrupt simplistic binary oppositions between spirit and industrialized society while also providing concrete examples of Mexican interaction with metropolitan culture: They can serve as “case studies” through which to reconsider any proposal about a Mexican inferiority complex, as well as limits to self and national realization created by destiny. Finally, these texts represent significant contributions to the larger artistic, philosophical, and existential discussions in the first half of the twentieth century about the threats posed by metropolitan modernization, mechanization, and market, and the power of spirit (as expressed through the arts) to defend civilization, culture, and, ultimately, humanity from these forces. An exploration of the nuances of this earlier era can perhaps also facilitate a departure from contemporary views of binary oppositions between globalization (often considered to be synonymous with Americanization) and cultural identity. The travelers considered here made the trip north for a variety of reasons. Orozco left Mexico in 1917 and 1927 because of what he describes as an unfavorable atmosphere for art (Autobiografía 59, 119), resolving to make a new financial and artistic beginning each time. He covered the initial costs of the first trip himself and for the second received a stipend to cover travel and three months’ expenses from Genaro Estrada, who was then Mexican secretary of foreign relations. During both stays he generated further income through art-related endeavors. Rivas Mercado fled alone to New York in 1929 after the violent end (marked by the deaths of three young supporters) of José Vasconcelos’s failed presidential campaign to which she had contributed countless hours of labor and undisclosed amounts of money. Once there, she began a whirlwind lifestyle marked by intense exploration of cultural events, determined networking within the art world to promote non-\n\nMary K. Long\n\nmuralist Mexican painters like Rodríguez Lozano and Abraham Ángel, multiple social events where she crossed paths with nearly every notable artist or diplomat from the Spanish-speaking world who was in New York at the time (including García Lorca, with whom she found a mutual and intense, if brief, affinity), manic periods of writing, and eventual hospitalization for emotional and mental exhaustion (Rivas Mercado 91–137). Novo made both his trips as an official representative of the Mexican government, traveling by train and ship from Mexico, through San Francisco, to Hawaii in 1928 to an international education conference and stopping for a few weeks in New York both on his way to and upon his return from the 1933 Pan-American conference in Uruguay. Villaurrutia’s year studying theater at Yale University was funded by a Guggenheim scholarship. Tablada, after going into exile because of his support for the Huerta regime (which he later withdrew), ended up settling in New York City from 1920 to 1937 and also spent the last year of his life there (1944–1945). He was paid during these years by several Mexican administrations to promote Mexican art in particular and Mexican interests in general in a variety of venues, and he also opened the Fifth Avenue Spanishlanguage bookstore, La Latina, which became the creative center for Latinos in the city (Williams 14).13 Whatever their reasons for travel, these wanderers occupied a similar place among the Mexican intellectual and artistic elites of their time: They were all firmly established as influential leaders in nationalist artistic and government projects and yet also on occasion attacked as outsiders for their artistic visions, political values, and/or personal lifestyles.14 In addition to (or perhaps because of ) this shared status as both insiders and outsiders, a common energy emerges in the narratives examined here: These writers and artists travel with an optimistic sense of curiÂ� osity, purpose, autonomy, and self-confidence; they are open to the new, relieved to be free for a time of the political and social tensions of the home setting, yet also completely confident that they will return home. While the texts, of course, reflect the individual personalities and values of each author, some significant similarities emerge in their overall vision of the United States.15 Certainly, descriptions of physical settings vary according to place. San Francisco appears as a vibrant, colorful city embraced by the beauty of its natural setting, and is made picturesque and even somewhat exotic by the presence of so many sailors (Orozco, Novo, and Villaurrutia);16 New Haven is cold and gray, both because of the weather and because of the architecture (Villaurrutia); New York is alternately dehumanizing and richly diverse, ultimately valued more for its repositories of high culture (the library, theaters, art museums) and culturally diverse neighborhoods like Harlem and Little Italy than for its skyscrapers and the economic power of Wall Street (everyone).17 But underlying these place-specific differences, the descriptions all define certain characteristics as typical of physical space in the United States: Order, uniformity, and technological efficiency, which at times inspire admiration, are occasionally overwhelming but ultimately\n\n25\n\n26\n\nMEXICO READING THE UNITED STATES\n\ndo not need in-depth analysis because they are known to all, an assumed given. For example, when describing Coney Island, Orozco states: “Up and down the beach the typical big American fair is set up with its endless attractions, which don’t need to be described since they are so familiar to both young and oldâ•ƒ” (AutoÂ� bioÂ�grafía 70, emphasis mine).18 Villaurrutia, on his first trip to the United States, describes Yale in one of his first letters as “the gothic university surrounded by the standard American city” (32, emphasis mine).19 The sense of a bland, boring, and familiar uniformity as the defining backdrop to everything also characterizes the descriptions of North Americans themselves in group settings. On the train from El Paso to San Francisco, Novo observes: “The people who populate the [cars] are all the same and cover their crystallized faces with the same sort of magazines” (627).20 And later when shopping in a used-book store in San Francisco, he states: “North American books, like North Americans themselves, become old and common as they age. They are beautiful and uniform when they are young and new .â•¯.â•¯. but they soon go out of style” (633).21 Tablada’s description of the weekend influx of city folk to the country takes advantage of a literary reference to convey what he sees a bit more harshly: We arrived at the panoramic valley of Woodstock .â•¯.â•¯. that was about to be invaded by the lobster cloud of the bourgeoisie. Thousands of Babbitts arrive from New York wanting to invade the picturesque oasis and flatten it into a total Main Street, populated by automatons, unanimous in their vanity, alcohol, sex, and the five percent of their lives that is the only goal. (Babilonia de hierro 281) 22\n\nInitially it might seem that there is not anything particularly different about these descriptions in relation to Rodó’s vision of the North American nation as admirably efficient when achieving practical, concrete, short-term goals (39) but ultimately lacking any passion for the ideals of truth and beauty (44). In fact, they seem even to confirm the negative visions of the United States as a country made up of metropolitan, modern spaces, which, though efficiently shaped by the uniformity of industrialization, are nevertheless populated by spiritless clods. Yet there is a significant difference in tone, for these travelers are less concerned about deploring the lack of spiritual or moral sensitivity of their hosts and more interested in exploring the practical aspects (in a utilitarian sense) of this world. Though these Mexican travelers may find little new in terms of ideas or content, they do find new techniques, experiences, and individual freedoms, and they are eager to discover the possible uses they can make of these unique elements to further their personal, artistic, or national cause. For example, Villaurrutia complains to Novo about the boring classes at Yale, where he spends the mornings “listening to all the things I already know, that we already know, inflated to the point of exhaustion,” finally concluding: “I have al-\n\nMary K. Long\n\nready squeezed all the juice out of the Yale University Theatre Department. I have sat in on all the courses, as well as registering officially for others. The day that I return to Mexico and we are in your library you will be convinced that you have the books that these people use to inform themselves” (41, 47).23 Yet he does find something of value for his theatrical goals: “The directing workshops at least have a little human value: the presence of students of both sexes, or of no sex, who compose silent scenes in order to demonstrate where the emphasis should lie, how to create a sequence, how to achieve balance” (41).24 He concludes that “there is only one thing that I feel, inside myself, to have been worthwhile: I have lost my fear of stage directing; I think that I could, when necessary, direct a play scientifically, technically. I have learned to analyze a play from the point of view of the director and to objectify the results. That is all” (47).25 This influence of lived experiences and a willingness to adapt new techniques from the United States becomes even more apparent when we focus on the way the narrators discover personal freedoms as they move within America’s modern space. For though the overall project has been introduced from the angle of attempting to define and articulate Mexico’s understanding of the otherness of the United States as object, upon an initial reading of these texts, one is reminded of the highly self-reflexive nature of travel writing in which “home” serves, as Gómez states, both as a point of physical and emotional reference and as an epistemological starting point (1). For these authors, coming to the United States certainly provides the opportunity to consider issues about Mexico with the clear-minded reflection that distance often affords, as well as to take a rest from intense social and political pressures.26 But even more significant are the descriptions of how the entrance into the United States leads each of these authors to reexamine his or her sense of self. The strategies each uses for self-understanding in the new setting are emblematic of the strategies they use for understanding the United States. For Novo, entrance into the “neighbor to the north” implies a change of costume: A few hours in El Paso between trains are enough for him to “confirm that my walking cane would be too distinguished” and he is quick to resolve the problem: “I leave it at the consulate, in the same way as I abandon my straw hat and a suit in the station where I put on the new suit that I just bought, thus, like an illusionist, transforming myself ” (627).27 For Rivas Mercado, travel to the United States, at least initially, offers freedom from national duty and time to begin a process of self-realization: “This morning when I was crossing Central Park, I clearly felt my Mexican wrapping detach.â•¯.â•¯.â•¯. I feel like I have canceled my debt with my country, that I no longer have it, that I am outside countries and beginning to live a universal truth” (94).28 For Villaurrutia, time in the Unites States brings a change in custom: “When one lives abroad and far away from one’s habits (my only vices) one loses any sense of time, or to be more exact, one acquires a true sense of time. The rigid linear time that I lived in Mexico has been replaced by an elastic time” (17).29 He goes\n\n27\n\n28\n\nMEXICO READING THE UNITED STATES\n\non to elaborate how this new sense of time has freed him. The process of liberation does not come without culture shock. He states early in his stay: “I am afraid that I will never be able to breathe naturally in this country where everyone goes straight for their goal, where the only attention paid to others is full of superficial, empty smiles” (41).30 But by the end of the trip he sees benefits for personal independence in this more individualistic way of life. In Los Angeles, Villaurrutia runs into a mutual friend, Pérez Gavilán, and comments to Novo that this friend “lives here just as he pleases without any of those complexes that were making him unhappy in Mexico” (74).31 And Villaurrutia himself is able to live just as he pleases also: “I went to spend the weekend in Los Angeles. If by day the city is ugly, by night it is marvelous. Not even in New York does desire and the satisfaction of desire flow the way they do here. I scarcely slept on Friday and Saturday” (75).32 Such freedom from social restraints leads to a transformational experience in San Francisco that he describes ecstatically to Novo as he sits “completely naked” and “exhausted” in his hotel room: I don’t allow myself time to think about my destiny; I simply live it, without daring to contradict it, without pretending to anticipate it in my thoughts. I have lived these last few days at an extraordinary level of pressure and speed. I scare myself sometimes but how to resist temptation without making it stronger? I prefer to fall into it.â•¯.â•¯.â•¯. Here .â•¯.â•¯. life does not stop for one second to be analyzed.â•¯.â•¯.â•¯. Yesterday’s Xavier, as well as tomorrow’s, admire, applaud, envy, all at the same time today’s Xavier. You understand what I mean. There is not the least shadow of vanity in what I say: I have felt completely alive, young, intelligent here as never before. (77)33\n\nThis new completeness of identity will be significant to Villaurrutia’s selfÂ�understanding and artistic production as well as to the expression and acceptance of homosexual desire in Mexico, since one of his most significant poems, “Nocturno de los ángeles,” results from this experience and adds a significant representation of the United States to the Mexican literary canon. It is important to note from these examples that, in spite of the economic and political power imbalances, and in spite of homesickness for Mexico that each writer expresses at one point or another, time spent in the United States is not an abject experience for these travelers. They are resilient and quite capable of embracing new possibilities (Rivas de Mercado, Villaurrutia) while also maintaining a sense of self in this new setting: After the exhilaration of a new suit and a new haircut, Novo loses his equanimity but soon recovers it after a long afternoon visit to a bookstore in San Francisco, confiding: “I have found myself again. I no longer feel inferior to all these robust people going quickly along the street newly wet [with rain]” (633).34 Thus they prove to themselves that they are capable of surviving and prospering in the supposedly more advanced U.S. context and also find\n\nMary K. Long\n\nthe freedom to explore their individual impulses in a more anonymous way that allows them to experience a sense of inner completeness. In addition to such private discoveries, these travelers also reveal their strength when confronting false public versions of Mexican identity in the United States. Orozco’s writing reveals much about the strategies used in relation to questions about identity. During his time in the United States, this traveler is frequently frustrated by misinterpretations about identity. These include those imposed by, first, unassailable authorities: His first border crossing in 1917 brought the destruction of seventy of his paintings by customs officials who labeled his artworks “immoral.” although, according to Orozco, “the paintings were far from immoral, there was nothing insolent, not even any nudes” (Autobiografía, 60).35 Second, misinterpretations that are the result of ignorant marketing: In San Francisco he visits a number of “saloons” that recreate the boom atmosphere of the 1840s and are “decorated with photographs of the most famous Mexican ‘bandits’ from that era and who were actually people whose land had been taken from them” (64).36 And third, misinterpretations due to irresponsible journalism: When his visit to Niagara Falls is cut short by a Canadian police officer who, upon learning he is Mexican, urgently deposits him back over the border into the United States lest the Prince of Wales’s visit be disrupted, Orozco notes: “That day the muckraking newspapers had published the news of a train robbery by the villistas in Sonora during which all the women had been raped. Mexican and bandit were synonymous” (66).37 Orozco is not, however, defeated by these official misinterpretations that impose an “incorrect” meaning. He sets out to learn the ropes of his new setting and develops strategies for furthering the interpretations that he deems to be correct. The issue of U.S. interpretations and the always present implication of Mexican inferiority are central to all the texts considered here, appearing over and over, even in the most positive settings and interactions with supportive American friends who have a great interest in and knowledge about Mexico and who are eager to be hospitable and gracious. For example, Novo is given a tour of the Mexican section of the Berkeley library by a history professor. The library houses an impressive collection of Mexican poetry and manuscripts. But curiously, before the professor shows these books to Novo, he takes him first to see “the books in English; the pro and the con: Is México Worth Saving? The Land of the Sleeping Burro, The Land of Mañana, The People Next-Door” (635).38 Novo deflects the negativity of these titles with his trademark irony: “It’s my opinion that it’s a case of some very unilateral bookshelves” (635).39 But this episode is emblematic of a broader issue: that even the best-intentioned Americans who seek to celebrate Mexico create interpretations that for Mexicans seem to somehow miss the point. This is particularly clear in the New York art scene, where both Orozco and Rivas Mercado (who worked diligently during her time in New York to promote the work of nonmural artists) are frustrated by the way high and popular art are lumped together indiscriminately and angered when work by artists that they con-\n\n29\n\n30\n\nMEXICO READING THE UNITED STATES\n\nsider to be inferior is privileged over the work they wish to promote. Orozco was extremely upset by the February 1928 exhibition at the Art Center: “The only things that anyone could see were the pictures by Pacheco, Ruiz, and the large number of aficionados, or amateurs who are regarded as ‘great artists’ .â•¯.â•¯. the people laughed and howled .â•¯.â•¯. there were also many of Hidalgo’s little wax monkeys and dressed fleas” (Artist 34). This leads them not only to criticize the projects but also to occasionally doubt the sincerity of promoters of Mexican arts like Anita Brenner, Alma Reed, and Frances Flynn Payne, who are at times portrayed, at best, as too naïve to truly understand and, at worst, as motivated by greed or self-interest (Orozco, Artist 34; Rivas Mercado 101). Orozco, in particular, becomes frustrated and discouraged, but he does not accept defeat. Rather, he decides that he must learn the rules of the marketing game himself if he is to maintain control of his message. He writes to friend Jean Charlot: “I know this little game quite well now. I haven’t had anything to do with caricatures, /magazines/, or other lesser absurdities, instead I have proceeded directly to formal painting, galleries, dealers, painters etc.; .â•¯.â•¯. I’m telling you all this so you will see clearly that only the painters themselves, personally, can handle their affairs and know and see everything, and all that the middlemen can do is ruin one” (Artist 49–50). The desire to create true and “correct” understanding through art, and the need to learn the nuances of the marketing game to do so, present some interesting contradictions for the individual artist, as well as for those involved in the diplomatic projects that seek to create positive cross-cultural perceptions through art and for those who have faith in the ability of the arts to counter the dehumanizing effects of modern mechanized society. In these writings we see Mexican artists and thinkers grappling with dilemmas similar to those that shortly would be theorized in the work of Walter Benjamin, namely that, in order to communicate the “spiritual” message, it is essential to connect with an audience, and in order to reach the audience, it is necessary to take advantage of techniques developed by “dehumanized” modern society. But in doing the latter, there is the risk of turning the work of art into a simple consumer product in which its market value (i.e., appeal to the buyer) is the main measure of success, thus fossilizing and in essence deactivating any spiritual truth or aura the work might contain. Both Orozco and Rivas de Mercado are intensely sincere in their attempt to make these contradictory forces work together. Orozco, at least, feels he has some success; he leaves the United States satisfied with the exposure he has been able to achieve for his messages and is not so troubled by the corresponding lack of economic profit. Alma Reed’s biographer describes a significant conversation held when Orozco was returning to Mexico after six years: “Alma voiced her extreme frustration at not having translated Orozco’s genius into a comparable financial success. But he was quick to remind her that their goal had been walls, not wealth. This they had achieved—in New York, in California, and in the heart of conservative New England. Surely\n\nMary K. Long\n\nin these places his name would be forever identified with the beginnings of truly American continental art” (May, 242). Jose Juan Tablada takes a different view of the relationship between art, consumer society, and wealth in a chronicle written in January 1928. In it he reviews the history of economic exploitation of Mexico as a source of raw materials to underline the positive importance of then-current interest in Mexican arts as a revindication of the value of Mexicans who had, according to him, previously been seen as “the only obstacle between .â•¯.â•¯. dizzying wealth and the greed of those who coveted it” (Babilonia de hierro 252).40 He considers it the duty of every Mexican to take advantage of the current interest: We on the one hand, are a people with abundant manifestations of beauty and pure aesthetic products, but without a market to consume them .â•¯.â•¯. and [the United States] on the other hand is abundantly wealthy, able to satisfy their smallest whim and pay for our artistic products in all possible forms, from the largest architectural project to the most trivial object.â•¯.â•¯.â•¯. The law of supply and demand has never before presented us with such a propitious occasion on which to affirm our spiritual capability and to .â•¯.â•¯. get rich. (261)41\n\nIn this chronicle, Tablada turns the tension between spirit and the modern world into an issue of supply and demand. And while in this text he essentially confirms and reinforces the binary opposition between North American and Mexican identity, he changes the balance of power in the relationship by showing his compatriots to be, if not on the same level in terms of economic power, certainly on the same level as far as marketing guile, while North Americans, still shown as lacking spiritual capability, are at least also evidently interested in spiritual themes. In other texts, North Americans are portrayed not only as eager consumers of the spirituality in Mexican art, but also as active seekers of higher truth. In several columns, Tablada explores aspects of this spiritual quest and related themes that are presented as worthy of his readers’ serious consideration and that he followed in his personal life.42 Spiritualist studies, which have intensified throughout the world ever since that great moral and economic catastrophe called the Great War, are gaining new followers every day in the United States. Every week the book review journals study new books with clear spiritualist tendencies.â•¯.â•¯.â•¯. Faced with the skeptic’s smile I can only point to the huge volume of these facts, which demonstrate a universal orientation toward the theory of immortality and spiritual progress. Such a movement is serious, almost solemn, as it indicates the religious reaction of mankind deceived by materialism. (Babilonia de hierro 141)43\n\n31\n\n32\n\nMEXICO READING THE UNITED STATES\n\nWhile still acknowledging a past that was defined by inequality and conflict between the countries, as well as noting the dangers of excessive materialism, in these chronicles Tablada creates a more nuanced vision of the United States as a metropolitan arena full of opportunity, open and accessible to all, in which both Mexicans and Americans partake of the possibilities, confront the challenges, and pursue spiritual as well as material goals. This opens a sphere in which creativity and spirit are not erased by money and market but supported by the structures that accompany them. The positive energy that characterizes Tablada’s chronicles is generated by all the texts considered here. The understanding of the United States present in these works is significant, not only for a view at least partly accepting of the United States at a time when other Mexicans were articulating a defensive one, but also for the playful approach to understanding the methods that offer freedom for continued growth, exploration, and creativity, and thus development and preservation of individual spirit and confidence in their cultural identity. The travelers who wrote these letters and reports are free to negotiate and create their own meanings— meanings they will allow to evolve over time. It is not so much that the authors propose radically different articulations of the issues of their time, but rather that through the strategies they use to enter the northern metropolis, learn its tools, and use them to impose their will, these artists and writers negotiate the spaces between binary oppositions in ways that allow for a much more hopeful and autonomous identity than Ramos’s vision. These Mexicans do indeed behave as if they “were free to choose any of the possibilities that occur to [their] mind as the most interesting or valuable” (Ramos 95).44 Not, however, because they are ignoring their history, as Ramos proposes. They remain connected to Mexico but are not paralyzed by those ties. This self-confidence, in turn, allows for a more humorous, resilient positioning in relation to the cultural, political, and economic power of the United States.45 From this stance, being an efficient user of technology, the modern market, et cetera, is not the equivalent of being Americanized, nor are these travelers simply imitators or promoters of what Rodó called “Nordomanía” (35). Rather, they seem to have heeded a less often cited part of Rodó’s vision (or discovered the same possibility on their own), namely that “the fruits of North American positivism will serve the cause of Ariel” (49).46 And from this shifted point of view it is possible to consider the stresses and benefits that modernization, mechanization, and market represent for both countries from a more continental perspective in which the United States is no longer a threat to cultural identity but rather an extension of Mexico’s own possibilities, a repository of information, techniques, and experiences to be used or rejected at will.47\n\nMary K. Long\n\nNotes 1. On the one hand, Mexico “represented a season of revolutionary fascination, primitivism, and social hope to modernist and radical activists, artists, and writers .â•¯.â•¯. and constituted for many foreigners .â•¯.â•¯. an essence of summer that could rejuvenate the self and recover peace, permanence, and intellectual concord” (Tenorio-Trillo 224). On the other, “the United States had emerged as a major economic and military power .â•¯.â•¯. [and] American economic ascendancy was accompanied by the export of American values, .â•¯.â•¯. faith in private free enterprise, [and] support for the free flow of goods, information, and culture, .â•¯.â•¯. which war-weary Europe willingly accepted .â•¯.â•¯. as an inevitable consequence of the economic and technological superiority of the United States” (Delpar 7). 2. There are numerous examples of this utopian faith in the arts in both Mexico and the United States. In Mexico, for example, Secretary of Education José Vasconcelos’s faith in the spiritual powers of art and literature (which grew in large part from his early involvement with the Ateneo de la Juventud, and which he expressed in his writing and his speeches from the 1920s and 1930s) was central to the renovation of education in Mexico. The muralist movement is perhaps one of the most internationally famous results of his efforts, but equally important was his emphasis on the reading of classical and world literature (Obras). The muralists themselves, in addition to playing a central role in the renovation of Mexican national identity, articulated an even more utopian political vision for the role of the arts through the communist Artists and Sculptors Union and its weekly newspaper El Machete, which strove to create support from intellectuals for working-class issues (Orozco, Autobiografía 110–11). In the United States, in addition to many publicly funded museums and grants for artistic production and study (see Delpar), there were private artistic patrons like the Delphic Society (headquartered in Greece but with a “colony” in New York, 1928–1935) that brought together international artists and humanitarians for cultural evenings in a Manhattan apartment called the Ashram in honor of Mahatma Gandhi. The brainchild of Eva (Palmer) Sikelianos, wife of Greek poet Angelo Sikelianos, the Delphic Society was described as a “cultural movement with a philosophic base” (May 212). In New York, Eva was aided in her efforts by Alma Reed, a journalist and promoter of world arts, who had strong ties to Mexico, first through her engagement to the governor of Yucatan, Felipe Carrillo Puerto (executed by de la Huerta forces in 1924), and later, during the years studied here, through her intense patronage and promotion of Mexican arts in general and of the work of Jose Clemente Orozco in particular. The goal of both women was through these gatherings to ultimately “reestablish ancient Delphi .â•¯.â•¯. as a center of universality and the source of a peaceful new world.” In practical terms, the society and later the Delphic studios, which Reed ran, provided a forum through which the work of Orozco and numerous other foreign authors and artists was presented to the New York cultural community (May 212). 3. In Mexico, government patronage of the arts was a significant element of the postrevolutionary project of nation building. This was not limited to the national scene. The Mexican government also recognized the power of the arts to promote national interests abroad and funded travel for both artistic and educational purposes as well as sponsoring cultural events, art shows, concerts, and so on, and paying authors (like Juan José Tablada) to publish articles promoting Mexican arts in the U.S. press.
