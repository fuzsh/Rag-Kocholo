        "text": "The rankings are for mixed leagues, standard 5×5 roto. This format is obsolete for many, who play points leagues or head-to-head, or DFS or sim games. I try to note where format makes a difference. But it’s called “standard” for a reason and we have to start somewhere.\n\nThe boldface price at the end of each player comment is what I would pay for him in a mono league auction (AL-only or NL-only). They are not projections of roto dollar values. Rather they are bets, calculated with an eye toward constructing a winning team in this format. You will note that my prices are usually (but not always) lowball. I find that sticking to my guns on the low end enables me to pay the extra bucks for the players I really want.\n\nMore 2024 fantasy baseball positional rankings & auction values: C – 1B – 2B – 3B – SS – UT\n\nYou should not use these prices in mixed league auctions. If you do, you will lose out on great players because they are worth more in mixed leagues. At the same time, you will pay way too much for mediocrity, which is the cardinal sin in mixed leagues.\n\nIn a 15-team mixed league, much less a 12-team or 10-team league, there is no getting around the fact that good players will be available for one dollar, or as reserves or free agents. The pool of good players exceeds the number of roster slots. Mediocrity is essentially free. This destroys a linear pricing structure.\n\nSome people like to go into a mixed league auction with projected roto earnings as a guide. That’s fine, as long as you know that in reality you can pay $60 for Ronald Acuña and $60 for Gerrit Cole and not suffer in the end game, as long as you save enough money to top a $1 or $3 bid in the endgame for mediocrities you think will step up. My general aim is to have about $27 left for my final nine players.\n\nThe designations Reserve A and B are those not worth bidding on who have a chance to play sooner or later, more or less. By opening day, several of them will be worth auction bids. PFA means Possible Free Agent, or not worth a roster slot now but worth an eye.\n\nNo doubt I have missed some prospects who will contribute in 2024, but I tried to note all those reasonably close to 2024 action. Feel free to ask about others, or to comment in general. If I’m wrong, please tell me so we all know better before draft day.\n\nRonald Acuña Jr. (ATL) Just to remind you that the obvious No. 1 pick in a given year is usually not the No. 1 pick the next year. Which is no reason to take anyone else, unless you know something that the world does not. Five cats in abundance. $47\n\nCorbin Carroll (ARI) Hitting .285 is plenty good enough for us these days, but bear in mind that he has not yet established a mean. Carroll can rather easily hit .315, with appropriate trimmings in the other four cats. He should not last until the middle of the first round — if you say he shouldn’t last until the third pick, I won’t argue, but I think Bobby Witt Jr. is a slightly better bet. $42\n\nAaron Judge (NYY) Nothing has changed. Keep him on the field and he’s the favorite to lead the majors in home runs, and likely to steal 10-12 bases, not to mention hit his lifetime BA of .282, which virtually guarantees 110/110 production in 150 games. I’m just a little timid in AL leagues due to injury risk, real or imagined, but a no-doubt early first rounder in mixed. $40\n\nKyle Tucker (HOU) Finally made it to the heart of the order, praise be. The projections I see are calling for better still — only slightly better as is their wont, but anytime you see that after a career-best season, it’s time to pounce. Projections just don’t do that. If you want Tucker behind only Acuña it’s perfectly understandable, indeed it is a proper conservative play. $38\n\nJulio Rodriguez (SEA) It’s still a bit on-the-come to bid $38 because he hasn’t earned that yet. But he would have last year had he played the full season, and there is no real reason to label him injury prone. I won’t be surprised if $38 doesn’t get him, but bear in mind that Seattle is a tough place to hit and his supporting cast is relatively weak.\n\nFernando Tatis Jr. (SD) I wish someone would walk up to him and say, “too bad you’ll never be as good as Ronald Acuña.” Get him pissed and competing at his true level. I would point out that Acuña posted a similar season in 2022.\n\nAwfully nice floor, if it is his floor, but I think it is. As far as being his own worst enemy, no news is good news. Cut his Ks to 22.2% despite swinging more, which to me strongly indicates that his .258 BA is too low. If he hits his career .280, the gateway thus opens to the four other cats, and he is a high first rounder in 2025. I would probably take Tatis in the first round this year, but almost certainly at the turn – pairing him with the guy below. $37\n\nYordan Alvarez (HOU) In my opinion, the best four-cat hitter in the game. They can’t get him out, or keep him in the ballpark, over time. You might have to live with a fill-in at times, but you still get a winning roster slot all said and done. This was true even with Alvarez playing just 114 games. (Please read that again.) He is therefore a rock-solid first pick. I understand that you want speed early, but I assure you that speed will be available with your next pick. And it is very possible that Alvarez stays healthy and hits .333 with 51 home runs. $37\n\nMookie Betts (LAD) Also qualifies at 2B and possibly SS (16 games). We really can bank on him to score 120 Runs, which is a helluva thing. Unfortunately, we can’t bank on even 15 SBs. Oh well. $35\n\nJuan Soto (NYY) On HQ Radio last August, my friend, the great Patrick Davitt, asked me for a hitter to trash, and I chose Juan Soto, because he had hit about .260 and slugged about .480 for about a year. That’s no way for the best hitter in baseball to behave. Well, Soto looked a lot more aggressive in September and finished at .279/.410/.519.\n\nAs long as Soto is in tiger mode, he may yet be the best hitter in the game. If not, he still walks a ton and gets that short porch. $32, three more in OBP leagues.\n\nMichael Harris II (ATL) Needed to make adjustments and, after a rough start, he did. This is crucial in a second-year Rookie-of-the-Year player. Stardom — in his case five cats — is thus pretty much assured. The possibility of super-stardom is no fleeting fancy. A better slot in the Braves’ great lineup is virtually inevitable. Plays at age 23. I’m paying up. $30, and in mixed league auctions I’d certainly pay a few more.\n\nLuis Robert Jr. (CWS) The eyes and the numbers agree, he was trying to hit a home run just about every PA. As a general approach, great. Just not when you’re leading off the inning down three runs… not when the winning run is on third base… not when the pitcher can’t throw a strike… like that. But we don’t care about real baseball, go ahead and load up, Luis.\n\nIt probably won’t matter much in the sense that we know Robert is going to be good-to-very-good, but to be great he first needs to master his PAs. He’s also quite capable of stealing 50 bases, but 20 is a long way from 50.\n\nI dunno. Would you be surprised if Robert was an obvious first round pick in 2025? I wouldn’t. I said the same thing last year and it didn’t happen, but the guy is still 26 years old and he hardly fell from grace. Arguable in the second round, but a no-doubter in the third. $30 is enough in AL leagues, as Robert has yet to top 145 games.\n\nMike Trout (LAA) What’s unfair to us is that Trout has lost zero speed but does not run. No one is asking him to steal 50, but he should steal 20 as pure gifts. Nor has he lost a thing in hard hits. As long as he’s healthy in March, I’ll definitely take him in the third round, although I bet he lasts longer in many drafts. In AL leagues, I’ll bid for 120 games and hope I get them. $26\n\nAdolis García (TEX) Showed genuine improvement in his plate approach, as in fewer swings at bad pitches. Don’t count on more than 10 SBs, or better than a neutral batting average, but 32 HRs with 100/105 are excellent building blocks. $26\n\nChristian Yelich (MIL)\n\nWhere has all the power gone\n\nLong time lacking\n\nWhere has all the power gone\n\nFive years ago\n\nWhere have all the homers gone\n\nGone to groundballs every one\n\nNow can he ever learn?\n\nThat is my main concern $25\n\nJosh Lowe (TB) Just because he has earned a chance to play against lefties doesn’t mean he’s going to get one. He’ll still get into games that he doesn’t start, but have to dock him a few bucks. Not too many though, as his Ks improved the more he played. It’s pretty likely that his best is yet to come. $25\n\nCody Bellinger (FA) It appears that his career has been three years of streak, then three years of slump, and now one year of streak. Should we bet the over? I say yes, based on a career-low 15.6% Ks if nothing else, but also because his speed and base-stealing ability are largely intact. Still makes me a bit nervous though — that was some kinda slump. Also qualifies at first base. $24\n\nBryan Reynolds (PIT) Pretty high level for a boring regular. We have every right to expect everything he does, and even a bit better, across the board. He swings at strikes and hits them hard, with power to all fields. $24\n\nKyle Schwarber (PHI) Reigning champion of the high-K/high-FB hitters. I just love the 104 RBIs batting leadoff, after 94 in 2022. Of all the dumb things that baseball fans say, one that really bugs me is, “it’s a waste to hit a leadoff home run.” What? You have scored a run and you still have 27 outs to play with. It’s the best thing you can do. Sure, it would be better if there had been a runner on base, but he’s hardly stopping the 3-through-9 hitters from doing just that. And every time the lineup turns over there is a massive home run threat at the dish.\n\nSchwarber gets the biggest pay raise this year in OBP leagues. $23 in BA leagues, $28 in OBP leagues.\n\nRandy Arozarena (TB) The 22 SBs after 32 in 2022 were predictable, after he led the league in being caught stealing two years in a row. Note that his SB success rate did not rise with the tide at 69%. And 22 SBs don’t get you where they used to. That said, another fine season with every indication that he can keep it up — which means possibly better — for another few years. Isn’t it slightly shocking that his career high in HRs is 23? $23, one more in OBP leagues.\n\nGeorge Springer (TOR) At some point he’ll cease to be the paragon of consistency that he is, but it does not appear imminent. SBs should hold up since he’s stealing them with brains more than legs. I suppose there is a greater risk of injury at age 34. $23\n\nNolan Jones (COL) Note the freakish divergence between his barrel rate (94th%) and his hard hit rate (53rd%). As the MLB norm is more than four hard hits for every barrel, the HH rate should have more stability.\n\nThen there is his 29.7% K rate, playing half his games in Coors Field, where strikeouts are typically reduced by a good 15%. I am not buying into Nolan Jones to duplicate his fine season over a full season. Oh, he’ll probably put up 23/23, just in a lot more games and with a much lower BA. $23\n\nLane Thomas (WAS) The SBs should hold up and can double if he puts his mind to it, but that is far from bettable. As a hitter he’s good, but not 2023 good. He’s more likely to hit .255 and slug .440. $22 probably doesn’t get him and may be too conservative, but to pay more is to bet on a full repeat, and my doubts are too strong.\n\nJazz Chisholm (MIA) Problems playing center field, but I suppose the team is hoping that experience smooths them out. Also problems staying on the field, every year it seems. But his biggest obstacle to stardom is that he can’t hit a lick off lefties, and it’s getting worse — .507 OPS last year. If he doesn’t turn it around soon he’s going to be platooning. I can’t get too enthusiastic, which means I don’t get Chisholm. Visions of 30/30 will drive up his price, but I want to see him come close first. $21\n\nEvan Carter (TEX) Have to wonder if they will play him against lefties. I think it’s short-sighted to platoon a potential superstar, but I don’t get a vote. We also have to wonder how often he will run on the Rangers, as the whole team stole only 79 bases last year, and it certainly appeared that the stop sign was up for Carter. But there is no wondering that Carter is a really good baseball player, and he’s 21 years old. It’s possible that he struggles, and with 32% Ks perhaps we should expect it, but I really don’t, not after watching him hit good pitching in the postseason. That gives him a floor like you rarely see in one so young. I don’t think $21 is too much.\n\nAnthony Santander (BAL) Not a disciplined hitter and it’s hard to see him getting better at age 29, but his career xSlug is .406 while his career real slug is .459. Clearly he’s got something going on, and another thing I liked is that the switch-hitter adjusted his style to his home park — power against righties and OBP against lefties. He won’t get better but he’ll still be good. $20\n\nEsteury Ruiz (OAK) Should be a great fly-chaser, but he’s not, he just outruns some of his mistakes. They really should send him to Fielding Solutions (I made that up) or move him to left field where he won’t do so much damage.\n\nThe question for us is the usual Pure Rabbit question: how much to sacrifice for his SBs? But then each case is different. Will you at least get three cats when the power is near nil? Probably not here: Ruiz hit .254, and can almost certainly do better, and is unlikely to do much worse, but there is no good reason yet to believe he will be a BA asset. Furthermore, he scored 47 runs in 132 games batting mostly leadoff, and by September he was batting ninth, where he belongs with a 4% walk rate. Not a total power bust, but he’d probably be a better hitter if he was. It must be said that his manager Mark Kotsay does not agree.\n\nThe other reason not to chase Ruiz is that he freezes you out of cheap Rabbits later, because you really, really don’t want two of them active on your roster.\n\nBut I must admit, Ruiz is good for 75 bags in a full season. A case can be made to preempt him after loading up on high-average power early. His current ADP of 129 allows for a few pitchers too. $20\n\nJordan Walker (STL) Pretty good for an undisciplined 21 year-old while learning two new positions in the major leagues. I’ll stick with my Dave Winfield comp — onward and upward! Bill James said it decades ago, and I think it has held up: any hitter who plays regularly in the majors at age 21 or younger has a 50% chance to make the Hall of Fame. Plenty of profit potential in $20.\n\nCedric Mullins (BAL) A team that’s trying to win the World Series is liable to decide that Mullins should sit against lefties (lifetime .657 OPS). On the other hand, I’m sure they would prefer Mullins to play every day, and his leash should be long. Sprint speed is down to 68th%, but that won’t stop him from stealing 30 bases if he gets the opportunity, plus he played with a bad groin from May on, which probably hurt his hitting too. His 2021 power is looking more and more like a fluke, but he’s hardly punchless. Close enough to prime at 29. $19\n\nLuke Raley (SEA) A fine player who deserves a chance to play every day, and has a chance to explode given that chance (we only get so many chances). I once did a study of somewhat established lefty hitters when they got their first shot at playing every day. I’m pretty sure the conclusion has held up, at least roughly, for two decades: more than half of them saw a slugging increase of 70 points or more.\n\nSuch a study is stacked in favor of success — if the guy starts the season and flops, he’s not an every-day player for long and therefore he doesn’t get measured. And then there is the chicken-and-egg question: “Is he playing more because he’s hitting better, or is he hitting better because he’s playing more?”\n\nBut the point is that it happens a lot, and almost always when it happens it happens because the guy hits righties better when he faces more lefties.\n\nRaley is limited as an extreme-K, extreme fly-ball hitter. He did not play wildly streaky as so many do, but still he only hit three home runs in August and but one in September. In this case, the hope is that every-day PAs help him reduce his strikeouts, which he really needs to do.\n\nNormally we worry about hitting in Seattle, but the streaks/slumps of the high-K/high-FB hitter tend to overwhelm park effects. Raley has both the speed and the aptitude to steal many more bases, but that remains to be seen. In short, he could earn a lot more or a lot less than my price. I know, that doesn’t help you. Sorry. I’ll try to do better with other players. $18, one less in OBP leagues.\n\nStarling Marte (NYM) Eye-opening 24-for-28 stealing with 44th% sprint speed. Look what can be done. Then again, I’m skeptical of the stat since it clashes with my own eyes. I watch the Mets a lot and his speed was well-above average. I guess he was really slow in the games I missed.\n\nMarte stole those bases in 86 games and would easily have stolen 40 in a full season, but of course he has only played a full season once in 12 years. Well not quite, as he played 61 games in 2020 to lead the majors. I mean, what were the odds of that?\n\nWhile Marte is pretty much off limits in NL leagues, he’s an excellent play in mixed leagues at his current ADP of 221. As long as he’s healthy going in, even at the depressed numbers of 2023, he’ll beat a whole lot of hitters who go ahead of him. And he should get something of a mulligan for playing hurt, unless you think he’s finished, which I definitely do not. His max exit velocity is intact, and this is a lifetime .287 hitter.\n\nI think part of the reason that Marte has fallen so far is that so many roto managers have overpaid for him over the years. They are determined to avoid the same mistake. Great, now they can make the opposite mistake, and I won’t wait until 221 to take him. Such feckless front-running should be punished. $15\n\nTeoscar Hernández (LAD) Road OPS .830, but .643 in Seattle. Dodger Stadium is no paradise, but Teoscar should stay comfortably above .800. $18\n\nJarren Duran (BOS) He’s ready. It remains to be seen, but I think the Sox are foolish not to hand him an outfield gig. Maybe not center field, although he did improve. Duran is not overmatched against lefties and they can always bat him last when facing a lefty starter anyway. Plenty of speed and hard hits, and Fenway for his BA… just let him play. Duran makes the list of those fully capable of 50 SBs, and he should steal 30. A likely building block bargain. $18\n\nRiley Greene (DET) He just looks so good, I can’t help but picture him as the new Freddie Freeman. He’s not, Greene is rather the new Justin Morneau with some speed. That’s good enough. Expected to be ready for spring training after TJ surgery on his non-throwing elbow. $18\n\nSeiya Suzuki (CHC) Nice growth season with the bat. My only complaint is that his running game has not matched his speed. Plays mostly at age 29, so a plateau is the considered probability. $17\n\nIan Happ (CHC) Solid and stable, in DFS he’s often a good cheapish play against stiff righties with stiff bullpens following.\n\nWhich brings up a couple of DFS tips. One is that in many games your hitter will face the stiff starting pitcher only once, and almost never more than twice. If the opponent’s bullpen is strong, your hitter thus often gives his edge right back. But he maintains it against a weak pen.\n\nAnother is to be aware of when the good relievers won’t be pitching, which is basically anytime they have pitched two days in a row, and usually when they have pitched in two of the past three games. $17\n\nChristopher Morel (CHC) A test case in how far you can go on talent alone. Power and speed in abundance, a laser for an arm, but 17.1% Swinging Strikes. Highly vulnerable up and in, but deadly down and away in the strike zone, where most pitchers will go multiple times in any PA. Turns 25 in June. Has a chance to learn discipline and become a real star, but first he has to play more, and it doesn’t seem so likely with Craig Counsell, the master manipulator, at the helm. Not a good outfielder despite the gun, but at least he outruns a few of his mistakes. If Morel could only improve his swing-and-miss a little bit, he would hit enough to be a full-time DH. Tough bid — $16 probably won’t get him but the PAs worry me.\n\nTJ Friedl (CIN) Personifies the battle between excellent quantity of contact vs. poor quality of contact. His actual results are better than his expected results, and this has been true in all three of his seasons, and the gap grew bigger in 2023, which again is not the way it’s supposed to work.\n\nThe simplest explanation is that Friedl owns some skill or quality or mechanism that renders expectations irrelevant, or less relevant. I mean, he hit 18 home runs in 138 games with a 5th% hard hit rate.\n\nHere’s another head-scratcher: a huge reverse platoon split over his three years — .981 against lefties and .761 against righties. Many more PAs against righties, true, but again the edge was huge in his third year. Therefore, if Friedl plays every day this season, he figures to beat his breakout season, not “regress.” I’m fascinated enough to make sure I get him somewhere. $17\n\nBrandon Nimmo (NYM) All of what we call “consistency” is, in at least one sense, illusion. All players get old, and at best they are only consistent until they’re not. That said, skill sets strongly tend to manifest themselves within a range of expected outcomes. Otherwise projections wouldn’t work at all, and they do work about 70% of the time, more or less depending on how loosely you define “work.” A corollary is that consistency applies no matter the talent level, from Yordan Alvarez to Austin Hedges, and everyone in between.\n\nWhich brings us to Brandon Nimmo, a .270 lifetime hitter who has hit within 10 points of .270 in six of his eight seasons. Otherwise, he hit .221 in his injury-riddled 2019, and once he hit .292, which is well-within reasonable outcome range for a .270 hitter. But he has never had a great year and he plays this year at age 31. I don’t think anyone expects it this year. And yet I do.\n\nTo begin with, his skills are intact except for his speed, which is still well-above average at 66th%. He never ran anyway. I’m talking about his hitting skills, which are elite at not chasing bad pitches, and near-elite in hard hits. There is no reason in his numbers to expect an ounce of decline. And plenty of players have their career year at age 31 or older. Just last year we saw unexpected great years from Yandy Diaz, Marcel Ozuna and Jorge Soler. Nimmo is every bit as good at what he does as they are. And Nimmo put up an easy career-high last year in home runs and extra-base hits.\n\nLast, maybe least (but maybe not), a consensus of reasoning analysts has long expected a .310 season from Nimmo. Let’s go Brandon. $16\n\nLeody Taveras (TEX) Cut his Ks to 21.1% while increasing his hard hits from 36% to 42%. Definitely has the speed to steal 50 bases, but it is unlikely on the Rangers. Still, it shouldn’t be hard to persuade Bruce Bochy that the game of baseball in 2024 is giving Leody Taveras 35 steals. But even with last year’s 14, Taveras has the basis for growth in either BA or power, if not both. His floor seems secure, and his defense keeps him in the lineup. He needs work against lefties (.638 OPS) but he’ll get it, and besides, teams won’t be eager to bring in a lefty to face Taveras with Marcus Semien on deck. $16\n\nJames Outman (LAD) More PAs against lefties (154) than you might expect from the Dodgers. His OBP held up (.357 despite 31.8% Ks) but he slugged .307. I don’t think they will allow that again, and so a $19 player falls to $16. But that’s not the last word — growth is still a reasonable possibility.\n\nJorge Soler (SF) Nice year because he mostly stayed on the field. Inconsistent because he’s high-K/high-FB type, but one impressive consistency is Soler’s mockery of the tough home run parks. I mean, 36 in 137 games for Miami, 48 in Kansas City — San Francisco will not faze him. He’s got the strength and he’s got the barrels.\n\nIn an effort to keep him in the batter’s box, the Giants are likely to keep him off the field, all to the good. Maybe the “first year of a big contract with a new team” applies, but it’s not that big of a contract and Soler has already bounced around. Anyway, he’s a better play in mixed leagues. $16, one more in OBP leagues.\n\nMasataka Yoshida (BOS) Take a bow, projectioneers, your model for Japanese hitters is looking pretty darn good. No reason to expect different except that Yoshida is a year more comfortable and can steal more bases. $16\n\nNick Castellanos (PHI) My price is low-ball because he is not consistent, and he’s inconsistent because his undeniable ability is too often thwarted by swinging at bad pitches. He turns 32 in March with no progress. He has been a nice on-and-off play for several years, and this is an off year.\n\nWhen he is nominated, I’m going to jump the bidding to my limit of $15. If that gets him, so be it, but I doubt it will. I’m pretty sure that two or three bidders will take the bait and push him to $20.\n\nJosé Siri (TB) Broken hand in September — a clean break they said. He should be ready to start the season. It took the Rays long enough to play him every day, perhaps because Siri is one of the most undisciplined hitters you will ever see — which shows the limitations of that analytic angle.\n\nProdigious power, and elite speed that Siri hasn’t used much for SBs. He could steal 50 except that he only hit 35 singles and walked only 20 times. And as easy as it seems to better a .267 OBP, .295 ain’t so hot either. So figure 25/15, hitting .225 on the low end of the lineup. $15\n\nKerry Carpenter (DET) The usual struggles against lefties and breaking balls, but a successful season all said and done. Should contribute across the board, and he’s capable of 20 SBs, but bank on 10. $15\n\nLourdes Gurriel Jr. (ARI) Sometimes he’s completely clueless, but add it all up and he produces every year. Skills are stable — expect more of the same. $15\n\nDaulton Varsho (TOR) Has to compete with outfielders now, so his lifetime .229 BA hurts that much more, and his 16 SBs are pretty much par for his roster slot. He’s a high-K/high-FB hitter, although not terrible at a career 23.7% Ks. Hit lefties better than righties but still lost PAs to platoon situations. I dunno, he should be better than this – maybe not a lot better, but better. $15\n\nChas McCormick (HOU) What must he do to claim a full-time gig? He hits, he runs, he plays center field well, and yet they can’t wait to bench him. Maybe it was just Dusty Baker. I guess we’ll see, but I don’t want to pay full price here. Turns 29 in April — figure his growth phase is over. $15\n\nSteven Kwan (CLE) Again we see that even abysmal hard hit rates don’t stop a guy from hitting for average — Kwan’s career HH rate is under 20% but his career BA is .282. As long as he bats first or second, three good cats and two bad cats. Acceptable OF5 if you need what he’s got. $15\n\nSal Frelick (MIL) I really liked him going into last year, and then how he looked in the majors for 50 games, but it is my duty to report that Frelick ended the season going 0-for-27. You wonder if they’ll let him play against lefties but with a first-round pick you figure they will, at least to start. Hit cleanup more than anywhere else, which is strange, but excellent strike zone command as a rookie (16.6% Ks, 12.6% walks) is encouraging for a prominent lineup slot. Figure the 0-fer was just one of those things. $15\n\nAlex Verdugo (NYY) I take his .281 career BA, add a little power for Yankee Stadium, figure neutral production (for a winning roster slot) and five steals. And I don’t give a damn about his bad reputation. $14\n\nTommy Pham (FA) Still a good player at age 35 and his skills are stable. Not exactly durable, but while on the field he’s a viable OF4 in mixed leagues. I would not target Pham in a mono league though. I’ll pay for 120 games and if he costs more, let him go. $12\n\nBrandon Marsh (PHI) Soundly rebuffed his doubters, including me, while still striking out 30.5% of the time. I don’t think Marsh is a platoon player this year. He wasn’t in the NLCS, and he justified the move.\n\nI was going to call him more a solid floor than a high ceiling guy, but the closer I look the easier it is to see a step up or two. First the playing time, then if he plays more he’ll probably strike out less. He’s 26 years old with experience, in his case high-pressure experience, and he did the job. Last, but far from least, is that he has done things in BA and power and speed. I can see .280 with 18/18 pretty easily.\n\nAbout the worst you can say is that Marsh hit in the 7-9 range in the order in 76% of his PAs. This hurts less on the Phillies than on most teams, but it still hurts. And yet, if he has a good year, someone is going to get hurt and he’ll move up. $14\n\nGiancarlo Stanton (NYY) Sad that it’s come to this. I will pay so much and no more, reminding you and myself that huge slumps are what these guys do, along with monster streaks. Stanton absolutely fits the Last Year’s Bum profile, except that he was also a bum in 2022. But then the more extreme they are with the strikeouts and fly balls, the greater the peaks and valleys. It’s difficult to measure, but it sure seems that way. You might reply that sooner or later it’s all valley and no peak, and that will shut me up. $14\n\nJake Fraley (CIN) Breakout season at age 27, but please note just 41 PAs against lefties. Also note his deep blue HH rate and that he is an extreme pull hitter. Granting him full repeats in power/speed, he could still rather easily hit .230. $14 is plenty.\n\nJackson Chourio (MIL) The problem in NL leagues is that you pay money for him and have to find a replacement if he starts in Triple-A, which at this time is still possible. You must therefore add a $1 player to those you already have (as few as possible when employing the Maximum Plate Appearance strategy that I very much prefer in mono leagues).\n\nIt can work, I don’t deny it. In mixed leagues, where replacement level talent is much easier to find, there is nothing wrong with taking an exceptional talent like Chourio even as an OF4. Given what he has done before the age of 20, he could be a first-rounder in 2025. Given his broad range of accomplishments, disaster is highly unlikely. He’s safe to bid into the teens with a confirmed job. But in NL leagues I hate holes. Reserve A\n\nWill Benson (CIN) Late bloomer turns 26 in June, but has pedigree as a first-rounder in 2016 out of high school. Mighty impressive .297/.390/.549 slash against righties, not to mention 88th% sprint speed, and he finished strong. Strikes out too much of course. On my team, Benson gets a chance to play every day, but the Reds are not my team. Even platooning, he’s a good OF5 in mixed leagues. $13\n\nJung Hoo Lee (SF) Runs well enough to play center field but not a lot of steals in Korea — 12 per 150 games. His superb 7.7% K rate will take a hit of course, but it could double and still be good. What figures to take a big hit from Korea to San Francisco is his power — be surprised if he hits more than 10 HRs. But he should hit for average with doubles and triples. $13\n\nRichie Palacios (TB) Impressive debut, if a little late. He was 8-for-19 against lefties with two home runs, which at least rules out disaster. Just 11 Ks in 101 PAs for the Redbirds, and a minor league career of .288/.392/.447, with 25 SBs per 150 games. He can play center field. Even platooning, Palacios is an above-average baseball player, and should be a minor, but distinct, roto asset. $13\n\nBryan De La Cruz (MIA) I can see why people were high on him last year, and I can still see it even after a pretty meh season. Talented-but-overaggressive can go either way, or maintain a mediocre consistency. I’m betting on the baseline: .263/.311/.420. $13\n\nTaylor Ward (LAA) It’s always a concern coming back from getting hit in the face, so a bad spring will knock a few bucks off his price. But Ward handles righties and is a solid, if unspectacular, major league hitter. $13\n\nAndrew Benintendi (CWS) Hits lefties, but doesn’t hit righties enough to be a winning corner outfielder, unless he gets back to .285 with 40 doubles. $12\n\nMax Kepler (MIN) Nice reversal of a three-year downward trend, especially because it all came in the second half (.306/.377/.549). That bodes well, I just fear he’s going to see fewer and fewer fastballs. There is also a chance that the promising Twins youngsters force Kepler into a platoon. If he stabilizes at .280/.360/.500, I’ll look like an idiot, but I’m timid. $12\n\nTrent Grisham (NYY) What a stiff. It’s actually hard to be a stiff with a 13.4% walk rate, but when your OBP is only .312 and you slug .351, you are a stiff. And yet Grisham has a few things going for him.\n\nFirst is that his career-high 10.2% Sw/Str is still pretty good. His problem was that he didn’t swing at strikes which, as problems go, seems fixable.\n\nSecond, because he steals bases, we don’t think of him as your basic high-K/high-FB hitter, but that’s what he is — prone to the long streak and the long slump. All the while his hard hits are well above average.\n\nFinally, his circumstances are favorable: he gets the short porch, and the Yankees really need a lefty-hitting center fielder to play every day. It opens up options. Even if Grisham flops, he won’t hurt them too much batting ninth because he takes runs off the board in the field. And Grisham has actually hit lefties better his whole career (OPS .748/.683). I’m going to chase him a little. $12, two more in OBP leagues.\n\nWilyer Abreu (BOS) Curious that his scouting reports predicted trouble with high fastballs, but he slugged .700 against four-seamers, and a) 95 pitches is not so small a sample, and b) .700 can come down a long way and still be really good. Unlikely to do more than platoon, but he’s an asset in the outfield corners with speed, so he can easily get into 145 games. I don’t often go into double figures with platooners but definitely will here, assuming that Abreu makes the team, which for now I do. More a hole-filler in mixed leagues until proven otherwise. $12\n\nJacob Young (WAS) Stole 13 bases in 33 games for the Nats, he’s an 89% basestealer as a pro with 98th% sprint speed. Little power but 18.2% Ks as a rookie, hit 75% ground balls or line drives, uses the whole field and takes his walks. He should hit for BA/OBP, and thus the gateway opens. Young was the center fielder after they called him up.\n\nI’d bid $15 if we knew he was the center fielder, but we don’t. Victor Robles is the immediate competition, not much of a threat you say, and you might be right, and then James Wood looms very large behind. So for now just $6, but almost a must as a mixed league reserve.\n\nStone Garrett (WAS) No hype for a 28-year-old post-prospect.He has a strikeout problem to be sure, but crushed many a major league pitch and also owns 79th% sprint speed. My bid assumes that he is a full-time player and that may not be so, but he was until he broke his leg. My bid assumes he’ll be ready, but the latest word is that he may not — for now I’ll leave him where he is. Garrett is a baseball rat with plenty of experience, and hugely popular in the clubhouse and with the fans. No explosive stat potential for us, but a good chance to turn a profit on $12 — one less in OBP leagues.\n\nWyatt Langford (TEX) The fourth overall pick of the 2023 draft annihilated four minor league levels — .360/.480/.677, with 12 SBs in 44 games, and more walks than strikeouts. Instant stardom is almost never bettable, but in this case instant mediocrity is virtually assured, and the Rangers have cleared an outfield corner/DH slot for him. It should be quite safe to bid Langford as an average major league hitter since he was so much better than the average minor league hitter, along the full spectrum of skills. $12\n\nVíctor Robles (WAS) Hidden behind a season-ending bad back, horrible defense in center field, and McKenzie Gore openly questioning his hustle, Robles quietly cut his strikeouts to 14.3% while increasing his walks to 8.7%. He slashed .299/.385/.364 in 36 games, and was 8-for-9 stealing. If it was the back, that would explain the fielding woes and hustle issue, though the SBs seem to be a contradiction. It’s pretty likely that a healed Robles is one of their three best outfield options. $11\n\nAustin Hays (BAL) Ill-suited to his home park, but he has made some adjustments and hit for average with doubles there. Thing is, Hays has a small margin for error as a corner outfielder, plus his team is trying to win it all. A serious increase to 25% Ks does not bode well for his BA, and he did enjoy a .345 BABIP. Unless he gets traded to a hitter’s park, I am laying low. $11\n\nTyler O’Neill (BOS) I’ve low-balled him for the past two years and, even with the expected power boost, I’m low-balling him again. With his strikeouts and fly balls, he will not hit for average, and he ran less while everyone was running more. So although he should add 4-6 HRs, O’Neill is low-average power, a plentiful commodity.\n\nMaybe the trade will also change what sure looks like O’Neill merely going through the motions — an observation that is hardly mine alone. Hell, I first heard his commitment questioned in a private conversation with a knowledgeable source at the wonderful First Pitch Arizona conference back when O’Neill was still a prospect. If he is smart, he will make a point of hustling, get the fans on his side, and I will watch for this in March. $12\n\nJack Suwinski (PIT) Easily the highest FB rate of all qualifying hitters, and a close second in K rate. This tells us that .224 may be his high end, and over .240 is a virtual impossibility. Add to that his .608 OPS against lefties and we should expect less playing time and no progress. Suwinski will hit some home runs and steal some bases — he has the speed to steal more — but unless the Ks come down, my expectations are not high. $11\n\nEddie Rosario (FA) Nice rebound season at age 31. The odds are only the odds. Not terribly likely to keep it up as he’s not the decent contact hitter he used to be, but in nine years he has hit below .254 only once. He can still take a righty deep. $11\n\nLars Nootbaar (STL) In 2022, he hit lefties better than righties, but it didn’t hold up. They gave him 124 PAs against lefties last year and his OPS split was .835/.635.\n\nWhich raises a difficult question: should they let him play every day? I’m not the Cardinals, but I believe the answer is yes, if Nootbaar can play a competent major league center field, and it appears that he can. If he can’t, as a corner outfielder, you have to platoon him. He’s a fan favorite and that counts in St Louis, at least to start. $11\n\nJarred Kelenic (ATL) Didn’t do a lot but did something, in a tough place to hit. Ks must come down from 31.7%, that’s too high to bet on a breakout, but they played him a fair amount against lefties and he handled them (.778 OPS). The Braves are not terribly likely to follow suit. Verdict: not bad, but the jury is hung on how good. $10\n\nBrenton Doyle (COL) In recent years the Rockies have specialized in shockingly high-K hitters. They would all have a floor if they could manage to stay in the lineup. Doyle played better at the end, but then a .752 OPS the final month is nothing special even in a neutral park.\n\nPlayed very well in center field, which figures to make him the starter going in, but minor power/speed with three other cats of neutral at best is the reasonable expectation. $9\n\nParker Meadows (DET) The next time someone tells me what a great manager A.J. Hinch is, I will ask why he wouldn’t give his prized prospect more than 28 PAs against lefties. I guess Matt Vierling is blocking him.\n\nSome star potential here, although Meadows has a strikeout problem. Also has power/speed, plays a superior center field, and I’m assuming he’s the regular. By all means, confirm before bidding. $12\n\nMichael Conforto (SF) Extremely ho-hum but at least he pretty much stayed on the field. Not a great lineup, not a great place to hit, not much chance to top 5 SBs, and so not a good bet for us. Not a bad reserve pick in mixed leagues but I wouldn’t push it. $10\n\nTyrone Taylor (NYM) Looked like he was getting the hang of it, cutting his Ks to 20.6% and slugging .545 in the second half. Good outfielder, can handle center field, has a floor of 350 PAs and probably a good deal more given the injury rates. Taylor gives every indication that he’s 20/20 as a full-time guy and, although he is a fly-ball hitter, he should be able to get his BA over .240 — just a little more patience would go a long way. $10\n\nPete Crow-Armstrong (CHC) Appears to be the center fielder on the North Side — often compared to Corbin Carroll, which is a bit over the top. Whatever, it is unwise to expect instant success at the age of 22. Should steal some bases even if he flops. Also has pop, so an utter stinker is not likely, but Crow-Armstrong (this guy needs a nickname) could be back in Iowa in May. Right now, $9 assumes he’s a regular.\n\nWilli Castro (MIN) Not bad, good enough for the good side of a platoon even though he is allegedly a switch hitter. Perhaps he can improve in center field — he certainly needs to, and the Twins don’t have a lot of holes. I see less playing time and fear that those 33 SBs are an easy career high. $9\n\nMatt Wallner (MIN) Three True Outcomes, on the high end for both power and Ks. Lots of swing-and-miss, but his approach was sound, not swinging at balls but swinging at strikes. These days most of these guys have opposite field power, as does Wallner, but it’s still worth noting. $9, one more in OBP leagues.\n\nAlek Thomas (ARI) Still young enough to grow into more power, but until he does, he better stop pulling everything. Great speed but doesn’t run much. A woeful .435 OPS vs. lefties. His path to improvement is to knock a good six points off his 36.6% O-zone swings. It usually doesn’t happen that fast. $9\n\nJoc Pederson (ARI) Speed is gone, which also hurts in the outfield. Most teams aren’t much looking for a platoon DH these days, and with four-man benches, we see why. But that seems to be the case here, and Pederson can still hit a righty. Turning 32 in April, his hitting skills remain sharp, plus he leaves a hostile hitting environment. I’d take him as an OF5. $9\n\nHenry Davis (PIT) Gets a bump since he should soon qualify at catcher. Maybe he shouldn’t, as Davis had a ton of trouble with breaking balls (44% Sw/Str). But then he looked better early, before he hurt his thumb. His pedigree surely still counts, but additional defensive responsibilities add to the worries for his immediate future. $9\n\nMickey Moniak (LAA) Did not hit lefties — OPS+ of 48. Of course, 65 PAs are hardly conclusive, but it shows what he’s up against for playing time. Don’t be fooled by his big first half/second half split, as Moniak picked it back up at the end. And he’s a good fielder, so he’s secure on the good side of a platoon for now, and possibly full-time.\n\nHe’s a free-swinger and definitely strikeout prone, but note that almost half his hits went for extra bases. This is old school and valid, and usually runs parallel to hard hit rate. Moniak’s 39.2% hard hit rate was exactly the MLB average, but that’s not a legit anomaly to me in 323 PAs. He also has largely unexploited 83rd% sprint speed. $9, one less in OBP leagues.\n\nJoey Gallo (WAS) All-time king of the high-K/high-FB hitters, so maybe Gallo has the capacity for the longest hottest streaks and the longest coldest slumps.\n\nThe slump part is believable for Gallo, indeed it is inescapable. I would throw a few bucks at the streak possibility given at least a platoon role, and his contract implies that he’ll play every day, at least at the start. $8, three more in OBP leagues.\n\nJésus Sánchez (MIA) Seems so easy to lay off just two bad pitches per game, and if Sánchez ever does it he will have a big year. God forbid they experiment and see if playing every day would help with his problem. But, hey, with Jon Berti and Jonathan Davis available, who can blame them? Sheesh. Hole-filler in mixed leagues until proven otherwise. $9\n\nMike Yastrzemski (SF) Professional platoon PAs with good power but his home park kills him — 54 HRs on the road in his career, 34 at home. If the Yankees had any imagination, they would have traded for him three years ago. Good outfielder, but he’s now 33. $8\n\nKris Bryant (COL) Constant, lingering injuries, and a slew-footed disaster in the outfield. I can see taking a late shot in mixed leagues, but that’s about it. $3\n\nKevin Kiermaier (TOR) One of his better years, but not a helpful OF5 in mixed leagues. As a fill-in, sure, but he doesn’t steal enough bases to compensate for his weak production and relative lack of power. $8\n\nBrent Rooker (OAK) Made the most of his second chance. There are a couple of dozen just like him floating around, but when are they ever bettable? You just latch on early in the run or, if you miss out, milk him in DFS for as long as he’s cheap. In this case, Rooker’s 32.8% Ks are fully supported by swinging at balls and taking strikes. When coupled with his 47% fly-ball rate, he is more likely to hit .198 than .246. And he’s a liability in the outfield corners. $8\n\nMichael A. Taylor (FA) Very simple: a winning player against a lefty, a losing player against a righty. Except you put him in for defense late and give him a few more SB opportunities. $8\n\nZach McKinstry (DET) Also qualifies at 2B, SS and 3B. The Tigers were thrilled with him because it’s nice to be able to field a decent player at just about any position. But decent for them is a hole-filler at best in mixed leagues. $8\n\nDominic Fletcher (CWS) Brother of David, same kind of hitter with more power, but not a lot. Which means he can carve out a career, and probably starts with the strong side of a platoon. $7\n\nHunter Goodman (COL) Possibly the opening day first baseman or DH. Good reserve pick in mixed leagues, capable of a serious power blitz at any time. More likely he flails his way back to Albuquerque, but one thing to like is that Goodman has hit as many doubles and triples in the minors (72) as home runs. This suggests that he can fight back against his K problem, and his home park has lots of room for doubles and triples.\n\nNormally the Hunter Goodmans are too risky in mono leagues, but the Coors factor ups him a notch. $6\n\nAdam Duvall (FA) Getting on at 35; not a center fielder although he can fill in; no platoon edge to speak of. It’s a matter of will a team just play him and live with his strikeouts, and hope he has another 30-HR season in him? Probably not. $6\n\nAndrew McCutchen (PIT) Still a threat against a lefty, and still steals some bases. $6\n\nManuel Margot (LAD) When you’re 29 and have never earned your roto pay, I keep paying less. I keep not getting him and I keep not crying. $6\n\nHarrison Bader (NYM) Can’t knock him as a player, but he turns 30 in June and keeps leaving the field soon after taking it. Supposedly a regular, but I’ll pay for it when I see it. $3\n\nSam Haggerty (SEA) I know, why is Gene paying $7 for Sam Haggerty when $1 gets him in 89.6% of AL leagues? Because if he stays healthy, Haggerty has a good shot at 400 PAs, which very probably means 30 SBs. He plays at least five positions, he’s a switch-hitter who has markedly improved his walk rate (.364 OBP), and his speed is elite. Not utterly punchless but don’t expect anything. As he played last year, Haggerty is an ideal bencher, especially in the low-scoring environment that is Seattle.\n\nKyle Isbel (KC) With his current minimal power and minimal walks, Isbel needs to hit at least .280 with 30 doubles to play for a team that wants to win. The Royals have said they’re going to play him, at least to start. Good base stealer but not fast (55th% sprint speed) — can’t expect a surge, although sure Isbel can steal 30 bases if Nico Hoerner can steal 43.\n\nI just don’t see anything to indicate that Isbel will hit that .280 with 30 doubles, or boost his HRs. Good glove in CF will grant him a longer leash, but don’t be surprised if he is on the bench come July. And he has been an awful platooner — .644 career OPS against righties. $7\n\nJohan Rojas (PHI) Slap-hitting hacker with a touch of power and blazing speed, the first question is, will the Phillies hand him center field? The second is whether he will hit enough to keep it, and the odds are against it — 25.6% Ks are way too many to sustain a high BA, and 3.1% walks are liable to sink his OBP below .300. Given his outstanding defense, they may give Rojas an extended opportunity, in which case he can steal 20 bases even if he flops. He’s 23, so growth is certainly possible, just not bettable. Not a bad reserve pick in mixed leagues. $6\n\nJake McCarthy (ARI) Did his full share in killing my NFBC Main Event team, hitting .143 in April with two SBs. He hit well on his return from the minors, but collapsed again in August and September and lost his job. He’ll have trouble getting it back but should fill a useful reserve role and steal some bases. $5\n\nDominic Canzone (SEA) No hot prospect at 26, but his four-year minor league slash is .310/.377/.556. Not great in the majors, but 19 of his 38 hits went for extra bases. Had trouble with slow stuff but slugged .653 off major league fastballs. The M’s need lefty bats. $6\n\nMike Tauchman (CHC) Got another chance and did something with it, showing the attributes of the professional hitter. Handled lefties, played good defense. Steals some bases too. Likely to have a substantial bench role. $6\n\nRamón Laureano (CLE) Still only 29 but hasn’t been a good player since 2019. Good glove, should stick and won’t do nothing, but no basis for optimism that I can see. $6\n\nJason Heyward (LAD) I’ll eat some crow here, as I thought he was finished three years ago. Give him and the Dodgers (Freddie Freeman?) credit, Heyward stopped jamming himself on every other pitch. Should platoon again, but now 34 and we should expect a little less of the same. $6\n\nAkil Baddoo (DET) Has teased before, with power/speed and a good eye. I don’t understand why he isn’t better. I mean, 25% Ks are not good but there are far worse, and both his Sw/Str and O-zone swings are better than average. He should strike out less, but he strikes out more. And it’s not like Baddoo has so many of the hard hits that can compensate. Still only 25, we’re not yet at the now-or-never stage, but he may not even make the Tigers. $6 for now.\n\nMJ Melendez (KC) Only caught 10 games, so in most leagues he now has to compete with, you know, good hitters. Which he really wasn’t. Melendez will crush a mistake but the pitchers continue to dominate him inside. It won’t be so easy to get playing time this year in Kansas City, so don’t be surprised if they trade him to a team that moves him back behind the plate. Worth a late shot in mixed leagues, but too much variance for AL leagues. $6\n\nHunter Renfroe (KC) Bid assumes that he makes the team, which is not a sure thing. He used to be a good outfielder but collapsed last year and, without a glove, that leaves DH, or part-time DH, which is inherently unstable. Just acknowledging that Renfroe can hit a bunch of home runs given the chance. $6\n\nJonny DeLuca (TB) One piece of the Tyler Glasnow deal, comiled .526 minor league slugging with just 16.6% Ks. Also offers 20-SB speed and can play center field. It’s almost unimaginable that the Rays play him every day, but he should get at least the weak side of a platoon. $5\n\nAlec Burleson (STL) Needs some team – probably not the Cardinals – to hand him a job and see if he can duplicate his minor league slash of .300/.350/.492. As of now, figure he’s in and out of a platoon role again, and mildly productive. A hot start would help. May qualify at 1B (17 games). $5\n\nDylan Carlson (STL) The problem is his career .221/.304/.368 against righties. He’s still only 25, but has made zero progress. Probably gets one more chance to play every day. $5\n\nJoey Wiemer (MIL) It might be a long-term mistake to keep him in the majors to play against lefties and for late-inning defense, but if there is short-term gain they may do it anyway, and you can’t really blame them. With the bat, Wiemer will crush a meatball, but is otherwise an automatic out. He runs very well and is willing to steal.\n\nIn his age 25 season, Wiemer could improve, and what he needs to improve is his pitch recognition, as he swings at balls and takes strikes. As an aside, I don’t know why every team doesn’t do sim work of some sort with their hitters on this vital facet of the game. The biggest edge in baseball, by far, is whether a hitter is ahead in the count or behind in the count. It’s an easy 400+ points in OPS — as in, way over .900 vs. way under .600, year after year. $6\n\nDairon Blanco (KC) Turns 31 in April but has logged only five minor league seasons as he signed out of Cuba. His slash in those five years is .288/.356/.440, and in the majors his sprint speed trailed only Elly de la Cruz and Bobby Witt, Jr. He’s on the 40-man roster and plays center field. The team is by no means settled there. Deep sleeper potential, and a spring watch for sure. Right now $5.\n\nColton Cowser (BAL) Turns 24 in March with nothing left to prove in the minors, but way overmatched in 77 PAs for the O’s. Retains his star potential, for now. As a No. 1 draft pick, obviously the team has plans for him. Bats left, so there is no platoon with Cedric Mullins. I predict a Baltimore-Norfolk yo-yo season. In the majors, it’s safe to project minor power/speed with a painful BA in a low lineup slot. It’s also possible that now their plan is to trade Cowser. $4\n\nDrew Waters (KC) Both speed and center-field glove are near-elite, but 33% Ks so far are too high a hurdle. Age 25, could still improve — worth an eye in March on the K column. $4\n\nGarrett Mitchell (MIL) Serious speed battles serious strikeouts, and throw in 15 home runs in a full season. No doubt the Brewers would prefer Jackson Chourio to slot into center field, which leaves Mitchell unemployed unless they platoon him with Sal Frelick or DH Christian Yelich a lot. His PA over/under is about 315. Still only 25, pretty good swing/take decisions, but the swing-and-miss must come down. $4\n\nRobbie Grossman (FA) Far better against lefties for the past several years — figure that will be his role. Walks a lot, with occasional pop and speed, but limited. $4, two more in OBP leagues.\n\nSeth Brown (OAK) Not enough, even against righties. $4\n\nMyles Straw (CLE) I’m not even sure I’d pay this, because I don’t care how good you are in center field, no team can play a .597 OPS for long. In a rational universe, Straw is a pinch-runner/defensive replacement. $4\n\nRandal Grichuk (ARI) Not useless at a price. $4\n\nMitch Haniger (SEA) Stranger things have happened, but it appears that all the bangs and incisions have taken their toll. Age 33, Haniger actually played 157 games twice. Moves from one bad place to hit to another. $3 and let him go.\n\nWill Brennan (CLE) Value is tied to his BA as he’s lacking in power and walks, and .266 is not enough BA. Good speed. $3\n\nAaron Hicks (LAA) A monster against lefties (.970 OPS), perhaps a fluke in the context of his career. He hasn’t produced as a regular since 2018 and the clock is ticking at age 34, but should help a little in a weak-side platoon. $3\n\nRob Refsnyder (BOS) Alarming power outage but, even with that, quite the viable weak-side platooner: .428 OBP vs. lefties. $3\n\nNick Gordon (MIA) Missed most of the year with a broken leg, so a speed check is mandatory. If he passes, a sweet little NL league play. He’s got surprising, if still only occasional, power, and he cut his Ks in half in the truncated season. Plus, he plays all over on a team with apparent holes. Don’t let him go for a buck. $3\n\nEdward Olivares (PIT) He’s not great. He’s at least decent. Other than that, who can know? The Royals made a big deal out of trading for him, and for four years never played him full time. This is because Olivares is a disaster in the outfield.\n\nThat leaves DH. His past two years of .270/.322/.439 compare favorably with all DHs last year, who slashed .245/.325/.430. And Olivares may well benefit not only from more PAs, but also from less time in the field.\n\nI’m not predicting what the Pirates will do. My scenario is not terribly likely. $3\n\nForrest Wall (ATL) He’s on the 40-man and it makes sense that he will make the team — bats left, primarily a center fielder, plus they’ve already shown that they will let him run (5 SBs in 15 games). Age 28, with nine years in the minors, but it seems something clicked at Gwinnett. Wall might be the best $1 speed guy this year, as distinguished from reserve picks who don’t start in the majors. $3\n\nSean Bouchard (COL) The Rockies played him when he was healthy and he played pretty well, but his problems with slow stuff appear chronic and he’s now 27. A decent deep mixed league reserve. $3\n\nIsiah Kiner-Falefa (TOR) Also qualifies at third base and possibly elsewhere in the fullness of time, but dubious as even a hole-filler in mixed leagues. Beats a hole in mono leagues. $3\n\nMatt Vierling (DET) Functional bench player but that’s about it. $3\n\nRaimel Tapia (FA) Retains his speed. A lifetime .274 hitter, but not much else. $3\n\nOswaldo Cabrera (NYY) Has some power/speed, good arm and defensive versatility, but slugging .290 against fastballs bodes ill for his future, at least his immediate future. $3\n\nJake Bauers (MIL Perfectly capable of repeating and indeed exceeding, even out of the Bronx. The streaks (and slumps) of his type usually overpower their home parks, but Milwaukee is kind to lefty power anyway. Make sure Bauers makes the team before bidding $3 — the signing of Rhys Hoskins hurts his chances.\n\nStuart Fairchild (CIN) The Reds seem to like him more than the prospect watchers, always worth noting, but I think in this case the outsiders are right. Has some pop and great speed, but his hit tool comes up short. Pretty likely to stick as a reserve. $3\n\nCharlie Blackmon (COL) Not much left here and have to figure he’ll play less. Still in Colorado, so not useless, but don’t be surprised if they release him. $3\n\nMark Canha (DET) Still gets on base but decidedly below average in an outfield corner. $2, two more in OBP leagues.\n\nGarrett Hampson (KC) Good year off the bench but where are the SBs? The speed is definitely still there. Also qualifies at shortstop and perhaps second base (14 games). $2\n\nMiguel Andujar (OAK) Has now bounced around for seven years but doesn’t turn 28 until March. His career major league slash is .270/.302/.450. There should be a place for that, and anyone who can do that mostly coming off the bench can do better than that. I think Andujar makes the team and will not let him go for a buck. $2\n\nKevin Pillar (CWS) Can still go get ’em in the outfield, and a mild threat against a lefty. $2\n\nJuan Yepez (WAS) Disappointing age 24 season, even in the minors and extending to the Puerto Rican Winter League. The Nats scooped him right up, and indeed Yepez has a chance to be one of their better hitters. He has played all four corners, but he’s not a fielding asset (except possibly at first base). Might be better than Joey Meneses, but not with declining contact plus declining hard hits. $1\n\nJake Meyers (HOU) Dusty Baker didn’t like what he saw, which was .227/.287/.359 for two years. Good glove and Grade-A speed that he hasn’t used. You can’t write Meyers off, but it’s not looking good. A change of scenery might help. $1\n\nDJ Stewart (NYM) Riding high after he got the call, and the wave might even keep coming for a bit, but before very long it will crash on the hard rocks of his high-K/high-FB reality. $1\n\nGavin Sheets (CWS) Three years in the majors and a total of 84 PAs against lefties. In 2022, and again last year, the Sox could have given Sheets a chance to play every day, but instead chose to play Clint Frazier and Trayce Thompson. Forward-looking they are on the South Side.\n\nSheets turns 28 in April. He’s not a good fielder, although he also qualifies at first base. It’s no big deal if he hits, but last year’s .212/.281/.349 against righties will not play for long. He has done better, but he better start hot, and that doesn’t look bettable. $1\n\nDane Myers (MIA) No larva at playing age 28, but he’s got bat control plus a little power/speed, can play center field, and played third base in the minors. He’s got a good chance to make the team. $1\n\nAustin Slater (SF) Hit .288/.361/.439 against lefties, but that is not compelling when he’s not much of an outfielder. $1\n\nJosé Azocar (SD) Has a chance to become the new Greg Allen. $1 if he makes the team, PFA if not.\n\nJoshua Palacios (PIT) Runs well and has some power, but he’s vulnerable up and he’s vulnerable in, and that’s probably too much to overcome. Not a bad late buck. $1\n\nConnor Joe (PIT) A little better than I thought he was. $1\n\nDylan Moore (MIA) Speed is down to average, and I don’t see what he gains with his all-or-nothing approach. Not a regular gig to be sure. Also qualifies at 2B. $1\n\nVictor Scott II (STL) If you count the Arizona Fall League, he stole 112 bases in 155 games. His 31.3 feet per second, easily beat the best sprint speed in MLB last year (30.5 ft., a tie between Bobby Witt Jr. and Elly De La Cruz). Visions of Vince Coleman dance in the heads of old timers, and why not? The on-base skills appear to be adequate, if not really good, even for this year. He bats left, he can bunt, he takes some walks, he hits the ball on the ground and uses the whole field, with just enough punch to keep the defense honest. All that, and with a mere .300 OBP, he can steal 50 bases. Spring may bring the good news, and with a confirmed job, I’d probably bid $20. Reserve A for the moment, but in mixed leagues I can see taking Scott before the reserve rounds. I certainly will if I need speed.\n\nChase DeLauter (CLE) Just 57 games in the minors plus another 23 in the AFL, but his big lefty bat looks ready. Outstanding contact, and to see him in the AFL you wouldn’t believe that his power tool has been questioned. Opportunities abound in Cleveland, including the middle of the order. Also runs well, so he should kick in some steals. Reserve A for now —may be worth a double-digit bid if he makes the team.\n\nAlexander Canario (CHC) Has 30-HR potential right out of the gate, but spring watch on his strikeouts. I’m pretty sure that the Cubs like him more than the prospect watchers, but everyone knows he has elite bat speed. If he makes the team, they will play him. Reserve A\n\nJ.P. Martinez (ATL) The Cuban import turns 28 in March, and his minor league line in 82 games at three levels was .297/.425/.538, with 41 stolen bases. Little guy but far from punchless, as you can see, and you can also see that he takes his walks. L/L and plays center field, therefore a very good chance to see action in 2024. Strikeouts not too bad but will get worse, of course. Given the chance, likely to provide major SBs. Reserve A\n\nCeddanne Rafaela (BOS) One of his middle names is “Chipper.” They’re baseball hip in Curaçao. They’ve got a dug-on beat they can call their very own. Ceddanne is plenty fast and the ball jumps off his bat, but he swings at everything and 31.5% Ks could get worse instead of better. The Sox may disagree and hand him center field, but odds are he’s not ready. Right now Reserve A.\n\nEnrique Bradfield (BAL) The 2023 first-rounder out of Vanderbilt stole 25 bases in 25 minor league games with a .473 OBP. Hits for average, but don’t count on any power, and gets raves for his fly-chasing in center field. Might be the fastest player in all of pro ball, him or Victor Scott II. Likely to get at least a look in Baltimore this year. A legit No. 1 target in keeper/dynasty formats. Reserve A\n\nNelson Velázquez (KC) Perhaps the greatest swing potential of any hitter in 2024. Fans don’t see too many opposite field home runs in Kansas City, or to dead center, but they did when this guy played. Of course, it is signature significant to hit 14 home runs in 40 games, but his wild swinging and extreme fly ball ways meant that he hit more home runs than singles. I mean, home runs are great, don’t get me wrong, but you have to hit some singles, especially if you don’t walk.\n\nThe plans of the Kansas City Royals are ever shrouded in mist, and the signing of Hunter Renfroe does not help Velázquez. Right now he’s the favorite to lead the minor leagues in home runs. But he could also hit 40 in the majors, albeit batting .215. Reserve A\n\nRoman Anthony (BOS) Made it to Double-A at age 19, so definitely a shot at the bigs and will almost surely get a cup of coffee. Power to all fields plays well for a lefty in Fenway, and also figures to hit for average with his excellent contact. Possible downside is that Anthony takes a lot of strikes. There sure are a lot of great reserve pick outfielders this year. Reserve B\n\nJames Wood (WAS) Interested in a lefty Aaron Judge, or maybe a rich man’s Cody Bellinger? Me too, and that really is the potential we’re talking about here, but the 33.7% Ks in Double-A say he’s not ready. Sometimes they come fast — spring watch, for sure. Reserve B\n\nJakob Marsee (SD) Exactly what the Pads need, a lefty center fielder with excellent on-base skills and speed, plus developing power. More walks than strikeouts in his two minor league seasons, it’s a virtual guarantee that Marsee will reach the majors — not terribly likely this year, but it’s certainly possible, and definitely a keeper league target if available. Scouts love him and the numbers are falling in line. Tore up the Arizona Fall League. Reserve B\n\nOscar Colás (CWS) Out of his league, completely overmatched by anything crooked and didn’t do much against the fastball either. Also, a defensive liability. Still only 25, with not one but two culture shocks under his belt, but the burden of proof is now on him. Reserve B\n\nDylan Crews (WAS) The No. 2 overall pick of the 2023 draft made it to Double-A in his first season, and should get a shot with the Nats at some point in 2024. Trouble is, Crews did not handle Double-A, slugging just .278 in 20 games. Little speed and his power was diminished as a pro. Probably a year away. Reserve B\n\nLuis Matos (SF) Plate discipline held up in the majors at age 21 — 13% Ks and 8% walks, and 253 PAs are a decent sample. To me this signifies that his talents will be realized at the 20/20 level. His 2023 numbers are pretty good for early struggles. He’s got a floor. Definitely worth a few bucks if Matos makes the team, but he’s more likely to start in Triple-A. Reserve B\n\nWade Meckler (SF) Hit .367 in Low-A after signing in 2022, and followed up with .371 at three levels in 2023, whereupon Meckler was promoted to the big club for a 20-game look. He looked bad — 25 Ks in 64 PAs. That’s a formidable obstacle since contact is his game.\n\nYou’d never know it from his 15 SBs in those two years, but Baseball Savant claims 95th% sprint speed. The Giants could really use some speed in their outfield. Spring watch — might be worth some bucks. Reserve B\n\nCade Marlowe (SEA) A chance for the good side of a platoon in an outfield corner. Has power and speed but, of course, strikes out too much. Played excellent defense in his 34-game look. It’s a tough place to hit, but Marlowe could be worth several dollars with a good spring. Reserve B\n\nEstevan Florial (CLE) Slugged .565 in Triple-A — they were waiting for that. Runs like the wind, but stymied by strikeouts so far in the majors. Well, not completely this time around, as he did hit the fastball. Should get a chance to play at some point, and still has a chance to get over the hump at age 25. Reserve B\n\nZac Veen (COL) Speaking of stymied — in his age 21 season at Double-A — but blame it on a tendon in his wrist that was surgically repaired last June. Blazing speed and a little pop, Veen will take over in center field about the very minute they decide that he can. It’s encouraging that he played a little winter ball in Puerto Rico and hit well. I won’t argue if you rank him higher. Reserve B\n\nSam Huff (TEX) Big power, even bigger strikeouts, but with Huff many of the fly balls you would expect are line drives. Gives him a chance, given a chance. Reserve B\n\nKevin Alcántara (CHC) Looks better to me as a hitter than Pete Crow-Armstrong, but probably a year away and figures to strike out a lot with his 6-foot-6 frame. Also, 20-SB speed. Reserve B may be stretching it — he’s still just 21, but he has the talent to force the issue.\n\nTravis Jankowski (TEX) On the waiver wire if you need a few steals. $1\n\nOwen Caissie (CHC) Huge power and huge strikeouts, but also walked a lot and hit .289 with doubles in Double-A at age 21. Probably not ready, but definitely worth an eye, and a speculative pick in keeper leagues. PFA\n\nJasson Domínguez (NYY) Looked great in his cup of coffee, but he’s just turning 21 and he will strike out a lot in the majors without sudden improvement — which is certainly possible. He won’t be back from his UCL repair until mid-season at the earliest, so not worth a reserve pick except possibly very late on a 50-man squad. With a normal rehab, it is wise to get in ahead on the waiver wire. PFA\n\nNick Pratto (KC) Negative defensive value at the three easiest positions, and his bad rookie K rate of 36.3% sank to a positively shameful flat 40%. Probably worth a few bucks if he makes the team, but I don’t think he will. PFA\n\nHenry Ramos (CIN) An eternal minor leaguer, but 12 years of .285/.347.440 says he deserves a shot, and as a switch-hitter he may make the Reds’ bench. Has a little speed too. PFA\n\nBubba Thompson (CIN) Hard to see him making a team with regress, not progress, at age 25. He needs to forget about exit velocity and start scrounging to get on base. I mean, his power is not going to play, and Bubba is as fast as anyone. PFA\n\nAvisíal García (MIA) Two partial years with the Marlins have resulted in .215/.260/.316. That’s not good enough to be a backup, and what possessed this notoriously cheap franchise to pay him $53 million for four years we can only guess. A kindergarten analytics class would have warned them off. My theory is that they wanted someone to teach the young players how NOT to do the little things. Or the big things. When his name comes up, I will stifle a snicker and let someone else have him. PFA\n\nDerek Hill (TEX) Possible late bloomer at age 28. Well-trained with nine years of pro ball. Has some pop and some speed and can play center field. Had a better chance with Washington. PFA\n\nCal Stevenson (PHI) See above but a year younger. Minor league career of .287/.408/.419 with 30 SBs per 150 games. Sometimes the Quad-A rep ain’t right. PFA\n\nWeston Wilson (PHI) See above but age 29. Not much of a minor league career until he hit 31 home runs and stole 32 bases at Lehigh Valley in 2023, and continued with a homer and three steals in eight games for the Phils. Plays all over, including shortstop. Worth several dollars if he makes the team. PFA\n\nSam Hilliard (BAL) Personifies the limits of big power and big speed in baseball, but he’s still got both and did a good job for the Braves. If he could only get his Ks down to 25%. PFA\n\nKyle Stowers (BAL) Playing time will be hard to come by without multiple injuries in Baltimore. He’s got good lefty power but the usual contact problem. Age 26. PFA\n\nOscar Gonzalez (NYY) Disaster City 2023, even if drafted as filler, because he filled nothing. As of now he can’t hit anything up in the zone. Can’t bid until that changes. Gets a new lease on life in the Bronx, a nice place to land but first he has to make the team. PFA\n\nRyan McKenna (BAL) Almost no chance to play every day, but has some power/speed and may have another gear in him. I like these guys with loads of minor league experience to fill bench roles effectively. PFA\n\nTerrin Vavra (BAL) See above, different skill set, in this case more defensive versatility, less power and probably less speed, but Vavra has hit .306 all through the minors. Both will probably see action at different times. PFA\n\nDavid Peralta (CHC) The back end of the Dodgers lineup was weak and Peralta was one big reason. You shouldn’t be giving 422 PAs to someone with a .675 OPS, and especially not in left field. Nice career, but I think he’s done — BA is his central skill and he has hit .256 for three years and he’s 36. PFA\n\nTony Kemp (OAK) You pick him up if you have a hole and hope he steals you a base before you drop him the following week. Maybe worth a buck AL in leagues where OBP is a category. PFA\n\nNathan Lukes (TOR) No prospect at age 29, with just a little power and a little more speed. His possible ticket is his .308 BA the past three minor league seasons. They need lefty hitting. PFA\n\nEverson Pereira (NYY) Good power, good speed, and has hit .279 in the minors. Hard to do with 29.1% Ks and, as we would expect, he struck out 40 times in 103 PAs for the Yanks. Plays this year at age 23, so there is time, but very probably at least a year away. PFA\n\nCorey Julks (HOU) Earned his shot in the majors but didn’t do much with it. Minor power/speed if he gets the call. PFA\n\nLawrence Butler (OAK) Has some power/speed, and is still only 23, but not enough so far to earn a career. PFA\n\nConner Capel (CIN) A .280 career hitter in the minors, but no speed and his power has not developed beyond occasional. Unlikely, but not hopeless. PFA\n\nJo Adell (LAA) All the talk about how the Angels failed to back up Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani, and a big part of that failure is a string of bad top draft picks. Adell was one. He’s a talent, not a ballplayer, and if it was obvious to me four years ago, it should have been obvious to them. And it’s too late to trade him now. But I guess anything is possible. PFA\n\nMichael Siani (STL) Maybe he’ll get on base enough to use his wheels in a fulfilling bench role. Occasional pop. PFA\n\nTaylor Trammell (SEA) Small parts of three seasons, 37% K rate prevents access to his power/speed. Age 26, it’s not too late — maybe worth an eye on his strikeouts in March. PFA\n\nNate Eaton (KC) Excellent speed but can’t get over the strikeout hump and now he’s 27. PFA\n\nAustin Meadows (FA) Anxiety issues plus vertigo, which can’t help. Turns 29 in May. At last look, he was a lefty power bat. Absent positive news, PFA.\n\nCristian Pache (PHI) Good glove and still only 25 but no signs of a bat. PFA\n\nYonathan Daza (COL) Not enough power for an outfield corner, not enough defense for center field, no SB speed for us. PFA\n\nJordyn Adams (LAA) First-round pick out of high school in 2018. Good glove in CF but the bat has not developed. Stranger things have happened. PFA\n\nCam Eden (TOR) Great speed, but four years of .246/.334/.357 in the minors hold out little hope. PFA\n\nEric Haase (MIL) Lost his catcher eligibility — may get it back soon enough backing up William Contreras — but his hitting fell off a cliff (.528 OPS). That’s a mighty long way from helping. PFA\n\nHeliot Ramos (SF) Still only 24 but so far shows, you know, good power and too many strikeouts. PFA\n\nJJ Bleday (OAK) Now 541 PAs in, the slash is .183/.296/.335. Highly unbettable. PFA\n\nJake Alu (WAS) Showed some scrappy middle infielder skills (also qualifies at second base) in the minors, but consistently overmatched so far in the majors. PFA\n\nKyle Garlick (MIN) Big power but too often an automatic out and now age 32. PFA\n\nAnother hidden aspect of every team carrying 13 pitchers is that fewer hitters get a chance to stick around. You would think, wouldn’t you, that there is a development cost on the hitting side. I would venture a little further and claim that corner outfielders without defensive versatility are likely victims. There is a mighty long list of strikeout-prone power-hitting corner outfielders (first basemen too) who flopped in the majors, just in recent years. It strikes me that a few of them would have turned into J.D. Martinez, or at least Chris Davis or Carlos Peña, given an extended trial. We will never know, because one thousand guys named Justin Martinez just had to pitch.\n\nJurickson Profar (SD) The key is how very slow he is now (13th%), and he was never fast. Profar, therefore, hurts a team in left field, plus he loses base hits. Still a tough out but they get the out just the same. I don’t think he’s worth a buck. PFA\n\nPavin Smith (ARI) High-BA guys can’t go hitting .206 for two years. PFA\n\nKole Calhoun (FA) Showed up in Cleveland and enjoyed a little streak but quickly cooled off and the tank is on E. PFA\n\nAJ Pollock (FA) Another empty husk. Time the Conqueror. PFA\n\nChris Taylor (LAD) Also qualifies at shortstop and third base. Surely the Dodgers are aware that his presence in the lineup increases the chance of an L. PFA\n\nCorey Dickerson (FA) Looks done, and little cat appeal even if not. PFA\n\nAlex Call (WAS) Organizational depth. PFA\n\n(Top photo of Corbin Carroll: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports)"
