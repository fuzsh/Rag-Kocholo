        "text": "Both Argentina and Croatia needed penalty shoot-out victories to reach the semi-finals of the Fifa World Cup – and this match at Lusail Stadium on Tuesday night has the potential to go the distance again.\n\nLionel Messi and Luka Modric, the captains and No.10s of Argentina and Croatia respectively, could well hold the key to unlocking their opponents’ defence. But should they breach the backline they will then face two of the tournament’s top goalkeepers. Argentina keeper Emiliano Martinez made two saves in the shoot-out win over the Netherlands. While Croatia stopper Dominik Livakovic made one penalty save against Brazil, adding to the three that he made against Japan in the round of 16 shoot-out.\n\nMessi, who has scored four goals so far at Qatar 2022, will no doubt be Argentina’s main attacking threat. There’s also the added storyline of the 35-year-old aiming to win a first World Cup in what is his fifth and final tournament.\n\nCroatia, who are looking to reach their second successive World Cup final, will “need to guard” against the Argentina skipper, but they have “nothing to fear”, said head coach Zlatko Dalic. He told Fifa+ that his team won’t man-mark Messi “in a player-on-player style”, as they didn’t do that in their last meeting against Neymar and Brazil.\n\n“We know how much he runs, how much he likes to play with the ball at his feet and the key to our defensive phase will be discipline,” Dalic added. “If we repeat the same thing as against Brazil, which is that we are close [to him], that we stand by the player, we have nothing to fear.”\n\nThe winners of this match will return to the Lusail Stadium for Sunday’s Fifa World Cup final where they will face France or Morocco.\n\nMatch facts\n\nWho: Argentina vs. Croatia\n\nWhat: Fifa World Cup semi-final\n\nWhen: Tuesday 13 December 2022\n\nWhere: Lusail Stadium\n\nKick-off time: 7pm (all times GMT)\n\nHow to watch on TV in the UK\n\nTuesday’s semi-final clash between Argentina and Croatia will be shown live in the UK on ITV1 and ITVX. TV coverage begins at 6.15pm and the match kicks off at 7pm.\n\nTeam news\n\nArgentina full-backs Marcos Acuna and Gonzalo Montiel are both suspended, so Nicolas Tagliafico should come in on the left while Nahuel Molina will continue on the right. Winger Angel Di Maria came off the bench against the Netherlands, and his fitness could be a key factor in whether head coach Lionel Scaloni “opts for a four- or five-man defence”, said Marc Mayo in the London Evening Standard. Papu Gomez missed the quarter-final with an ankle knock and remains a doubt.\n\nCroatia head coach Dalic has no suspension or injury worries. Left-back Borna Sosa returned for the win over Brazil while striker Bruno Petkovic is pushing for a start after scoring the late extra-time equaliser in the quarter-final.\n\nPossible starting XIs\n\nArgentina: Emiliano Martinez; Nahuel Molina, Cristian Romero, Nicolas Otamendi, Lisandro Martinez, Nicolas Tagliafico; Rodrigo De Paul, Enzo Fernandez, Alexis Mac Allister; Julian Alvarez, Lionel Messi\n\nCroatia: Dominik Livakovic: Josip Juranovic, Dejan Lovren, Josko Gvardiol, Borna Sosa; Luka Modric, Marcelo Brozovic, Mateo Kovacic; Andrej Kramaric, Mario Pasalic, Ivan Perisic\n\nPredictions\n\n“I put my hands up here” because I have written off Croatia numerous times throughout this tournament, said Chris Sutton on BBC Sport. “And I don’t mind saying I’ve got them badly wrong.” Who knows how this game will play out and I would say it is “50-50 in terms of who will win”. But I haven’t done too badly “following my heart rather than my head”, so “I am going to do it again” and send Messi through to the final. “Yes, this means I am writing off Croatia yet again – which probably means another shoot-out, which they will win.” Prediction: Argentina 1 Croatia 0.\n\nAhead of kick-off, the Opta supercomputer makes Argentina “the favourites to progress without needing penalties (55.8%)”, said Patric Ridge on Opta Analyst. Croatia are given a “17.9% chance” of winning. Eight of Croatia’s last nine World Cup knockout matches have gone to extra-time, however, “so do not be surprised if this match is drawn over 90 minutes, or even 120”.\n\nAnother World Cup knockout game for Croatia, another period of extra time? “Strap in”, said Ben Knapton on SportsMole. Knowing how “dangerous” the Croatians are from 12 yards, Lionel Scaloni should “call upon his enviable wealth of attacking options” to try to “put the game to bed” in normal time, but it may take 120 minutes for La Albiceleste to deny the Checkered Ones another final appearance and set up a “tantalising contest” with Morocco or France. Prediction: Argentina 2 Croatia 1 (after extra time).\n\nDespite Croatia’s “impressive showing” against Brazil, I am backing Argentina to deliver Messi his first World Cup victory, said Matthew Williams on Goal. I would expect a “low-scoring, highly-contested” match that is decided by corner kicks and individual brilliance. “Both of these categories favour Argentina.” Prediction: Argentina 2 Croatia 0.\n\nAfter the way Croatia played against Brazil, “it’s hard to see why they can’t muster the same performance” against a similar opponent in Argentina, said Kyle Bonn on Sporting News. Argentina “do not look inspired” in the final third, and seeing as they’ll miss a few players due to yellow card suspensions, “Croatia could do the business again here with a pragmatic performance”.\n\nGiven how both teams have operated thus far, “it’s going to be very tight”, said Jonathan Gorrie in the London Evening Standard. Messi, however, “could prove the difference” for Argentina. Croatia “don’t hold too much of an attacking threat outside of penalties” and the Argentina captain could “punish them” in a game of few chances. Prediction: Argentina to win 1-0.\n\nThat “tightness” between the two teams makes this contest “almost impossible to predict over 90 minutes”, said Feargal Brennan on Football Italia. A draw at the end of normal time is a “strong possibility” – and extra time and penalties further down the line.\n\nThe stadium\n\nThe 80,000-seater Lusail Stadium is the centrepiece of the Qatar World Cup and will host the final next Sunday. Located nine miles north of Doha, six group games, one round of 16 match and the quarter-final between the Netherlands and Argentina have so far been held at the stadium.\n\nSquads\n\nArgentina\n\nHead coach: Lionel Scaloni\n\nKey player: Lionel Messi\n\nOne to watch: Julian Alvarez\n\nGoalkeepers: Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa), Franco Armani (River Plate) and Geronimo Rulli (Villarreal)\n\nDefenders: Gonzalo Montiel (Sevilla), Nahuel Molina (Atletico Madrid), German Pezzella (Real Betis), Cristian Romero (Tottenham Hotspur), Nicolas Otamendi (Benfica), Lisandro Martinez (Manchester United), Juan Foyth (Villarreal), Nicolas Tagliafico (Olympique Lyonnais), Marcos Acuna (Sevilla)\n\nMidfielders: Leandro Paredes (Juventus), Guido Rodriguez (Real Betis), Enzo Fernandez (Benfica), Rodrigo De Paul (Atletico Madrid), Exequiel Palacios (Bayer Leverkusen), Alejandro Gomez (Sevilla), Alexis Mac Allister (Brighton & Hove Albion)\n\nForwards: Paulo Dybala (AS Roma), Lionel Messi (Paris Saint-Germain), Angel Di Maria (Juventus), Nicolas Gonzalez (Fiorentina), Joaquin Correa (Inter Milan), Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan), Julian Alvarez (Manchester City)\n\nCroatia"
