        "text": "Campeonato Nacional Selectivo Mexico 2022 Preview Part 2: Doubles\n\nPart 1 (published yesterday) previewed the Mexican National singles draws.\n\nPart 2 today covers the three doubles draws: Men’s, Women’s, and Mixed.\n\nr2sports site: https://www.r2sports.com/tourney/home.asp?TID=38926\n\nMen’s Doubles\n\n13 Teams are here, highlighted by the top two seeded teams of #1 @Javier Mar and @Rodrigo Montoya and #2 @Daniel de la Rosa & @Alvaro Beltran. These two teams have met on plenty of occasions as of late:\n\nthe 2021 Mexican Nationals final (Mar/Montoya win)\n\n2021 US Open Semis (DLR/Beltran win)\n\n2021 Shamrock Shootout Semis (DLR/Beltran win)\n\n2020 Shamrock final (DLR/Beltran win)\n\n2020 Mexican Nationals final (Mar/Montoya win)\n\n2020 Lewis Drug Final (DLR/Beltran win).\n\nSo, the two wins for the Mar/Montoya team were … in the Mexican Nationals finals, which then opened a pathway for them to represent their country at the last few international events, where they have had great success. They’re the current reigning 2019 Pan Am Games champs and the 2021 World Champs.\n\nSo, can anyone stop either team on the way to another finals rematch?\n\nThe only other team I’d be fearful of here is the #4 seeded team of @Sebastian Fernandez and Andres Parrilla ; they’ll give Montoya/Mar a run for the money in the semis. DLR and Beltran should cruise to the final.\n\nMy prediction? Another Montoya/Mar defeat of DLR/Beltran. I think Alvaro is dinged up right now, not getting any younger, and as a team they’ve gotten upset early in the last few events they’ve entered.\n\nWomen’s Doubles Preview:\n\nNine teams here, highlighted (like the Men’s draw) by two powerhouse teams at #1 and #2 seeds. #1 @Paola Longoria and @Samantha Salas Solis continue their partnership, which now includes 36 pro titles together, somewhere in the range of 15 Mexican national titles, and 19 International titles together. Amazing. But the #2 team of @Montse Mejia and @Alexandra Herrera is coming up fast on the veteran team’s heels. They’ve beaten Longoria/Salas in a couple of significant pro events recently ( the 2019 US Open being most memorable) and have several pro titles together. But they’ve yet to take a National doubles title.\n\nIs this the weekend?\n\nLike on the men’s side, it is difficult to see anyone standing in the way of a 1-2 final. In that final, I’m going to predict a changing of the guard with the Mejia/Herrera team topping Longoria and Salas to take their first national title together.\n\nMixed Doubles preview.\n\nToday marks a new day for Pro Racquetball Stats: the beginning of what seems like it will be a sustained movement of regular mixed doubles competition at both the National and International level. For the nearly 20 years I’ve run this site, we’ve never had anything other than a couple of one-off Mixed pro events when the two tours just happened to be in the same spot (World Doubles in Denver, the Syosset Open, Arizona Pro-am to name a few over the past few years). But now we have Mixed to add to both the Amateur and International database and report code.\n\nLets preview the first National mixed doubles draw.\n\nThere are 15 Mixed Doubles teams competing here; lets go through with some predictions.\n\nMatches to watch for in the 16s (which happened yesterday so this is old news)\n\n#5 Beltran/Mejia were done no favors having to play #12 Polo/Acosta. A lefty righty pair will present some interesting choices for Beltran and Mejia. Polo is always hard to beat. In the end though, Beltran/Mejia advanced rather easily 10,4,9\n\nQF matches to look for\n\nThe 4/5 of Beltran/Mejia versus the Parrilla/Parrilla brother/sister combo could be great. Andree is a great doubles player and will push this matchup. I think there’s an interesting balance of talent here; Parrilla is a better player than Beltran right now, while Mejia is a better than Jessica. But, the key for me is the fact that Beltran plays almost entirely on the right hand side when he plays doubles with DLR in mens; here he’ll have to play the left hand side, where I think Parrilla has the advantage. I see the Bro/Sis pairing advancing.\n\nI like the 3/6 matchup between DLR/Longoria and Cardona/Lucia. It might be odd to think that a pairing of the two currently ranked #1 pro players in the world is seeded third (hey, Mexican national seeding), but chemistry is important in doubles pairings, especially in mixed. Cardona will bang it out on the right side with DLR, while Longoria could overwhelm Lucia on the left.\n\nProjected Semis:\n\n#1 Montoya/Salas, who won the 2021 World Doubles mixed pro title with relative ease, are set to face the Parrillas.\n\n#2 Fernandez/Herrera, who made the 2021 World doubles final (perhaps this is the tourney they used to seed this draw) are set to face the #1/#1 team of DLR/Longoria. What makes this matchup interesting is the lefty/righty pairing. Herrera will be on the left, meaning DLR will be serving to her. DLR is not hitting photons at 160mph … but he does hit with pace and can place his “walking drive serve” with an accuracy and depth that Herrera is not used to seeing. On the flip side, Patata can blast serves at Paola’s forehand, but probably will choose to either hit wallpapers or hard Zs. Either way, for whatever reason Longoria has not fared well in past Mixed pro matches and I think they’ll lose again here to setup 1v2.\n\nIn the final, I like a rematch of the Denver World doubles final from 2021, where Montoya/Salas crushed Fernandez/Herrera 12,6. I think we’ll see a closer match but a similar result. #1 seeds to win.\n\nStreaming has started: follow RKT on Facebook to get live notifications. The tournament runs through Sunday early afternoon. Juarez is Mountain time, so 2 hours later than EST for your planning purposes.\n\nCampeonato Nacional Selectivo Mexico 2022 Preview Part 1: Singles\n\nWelcome to one of my favorite tournaments to cover every year; its the 2022 Mexican Nationals Selection event. This year features both Singles and Doubles in one event and will feature the best of all the top Mexican players and pros. A new fun feature this year is the inclusion of Mixed Open Doubles, thanks to the IRF adding Mixed as a competitive event, so we’ll preview that event and the interesting pairings we will see.\n\nI’ll preview Singles today and Doubles tomorrow.\n\nYou’ll see rally scoring this weekend, since IRF has adopted it and thus confederations will play it going forward so as to prepare t heir athletes.\n\nThis tournament started on Wednesday morning thanks to the huge draws, so we’re a bit behind on this preview (some of the first round of Men’s has already been played), but here goes.\n\nr2sports site: https://www.r2sports.com/tourney/home.asp?TID=38926\n\nMen’s Singles\n\nThere’s some notable absences at this event. Current IRT #7 Eduardo Portillo is missing despite playing last weekend at the Beach Bash. Also missing was the other semi finalist from 2021 in @Elias Nieto. Curious why they’re not here, though word has it that a bit of a kerfuffle about the PARC Mexican doubles team was resolved by Mar/Montoya backing out and giving their spots to Lalo/Nieto (as was apparently promised to them last Summer, when the FMR said the 2022 PARC team would be comprised of the singles semi finalists, not the Doubles winners from the Worlds selection event later in the fall).\n\nAlso not here are top Mexicans such as Eduardo Garay (perhaps still not converted back to Mexico from Colombia), Javier Estrada , Alan Natera , @GeraGerardo Franco (who may be retired at this point), @Jaime Martel , @Ernesto Ochoa, Jordy Alonso (who’s had some recent success on tour), Rodrigo Rodriguez, or frequent competitor @Christian Longoria . So, as deep as this draw is it could have been better. Also not playing singles but here playing doubles is @Alvaro Beltran, prioritizing his health and skipping the demanding singles draw to focus on doubles.\n\nBut, there’s some notable players present who we don’t always get to see playing. Former WRT #1s @Alejandro Cardona and @Polo Gutierrez are entered in the draw (probably because they’re both residents of Juarez and its an easy commute). Both are top notch players and are dark horses as the #8 and #20 seeds respectively.\n\nAlso, a general word about the seeding. The seeds at this event always seem curious to me, depending on what seems to be a random calculation of past events and personal opinion. Daniel De la Rosa, for example, is the #1 player in the world and has been for some time, but is seeded 6th in the Singles draw (he missed the 2021 Nationals event and finished 3rd in the 2019 event, so i guess that adds up to the 6th seed). It makes for some curious early round matches sometimes that we’ll note as we go.\n\nIf you were asking me to seed this ignoring last year’s results (not that you were of course), i’d seed it: DLR, Parrilla, Montoya, Mar, Fernandez, Cardona, Trujillo, and Polo.\n\nThere’s 31 players in the singles draw, with the top seeds driven by last year’s finals. Here’s a preview of matches to look for.\n\nIn the 32s:\n\n#5 @Emir Martinez faces #28 @Luis Renteria in what could be an interesting match. Renteria is one of the more decorated Mexican Juniors in history but is in his age 17 season.\n\n#7 @Sebastian Fernandez takes on fellow IRT touring pro @ErErick Fernanado Cuevas in the round of 32, perhaps a round too early for such a meeting.\n\n– Another decorated Mexican junior recently matriculated in Jose Ramos is entered as a #23 seed; he’ll take on #10 seed Angel Camacho in the opener.\n\nProjecting the 16s, here’s some fun ones\n\n#4 @EErick Trujillo , who has been making waves on tour, may face Polo at this stage. Polo has a unique game style that stymies veteran pros all the time; can the younger Trujillo make the adjustments? Upset watch here.\n\n– #7 Patata versus the upset-minded junior #23 Ramos: Fernandez should advance but if Ramos gets by round one he’ll have some confidence.\n\nQuarters: here’s where the rubber meets the road, with a set of projected quarter final players all with tour experience.\n\n#1 @Rodrigo Montoya versus #8 Cardona: a good old fashioned WRT matchup between two hard hitters. Cardona leads career h2h 4-2, but they havn’t played in 5 years. Advantage Montoya to move on.\n\nThe winner of Trujillo/Polo has the advantage over #5 @Emir Martinez, who has zero IRT experience and is seeded 5th (ahead of DLR, lets we forget) on the back of his 2021 run to the quarters.\n\n#6 @Daniel de la Rosa takes on #3 @Javier Mar in a match worthy of a final, but which happens in the quarters thanks to the ridiculous seeding. Mar has been on the singles sidelines for months as he recovered from a hernia, but competed well last weekend in Florida. DLR missed the Nationals last year for the first time in a decade, but has made the semis or better in the last 6 Mexican Nationals that he’s played. Mar won this title in 2017 and made the 2020 semis … so this will be a tightly fought match. Advantage DLR just based on world rankings.\n\n#2 @Andree Parrilla projects to take on Patata in another fun match. They have not met since 2019, but Andree is 4-0 lifetime against Fernandez. This is a solid IRT round of 16 quality match and Parrilla should advance.\n\nMy projected Semis:\n\n#1 Montoya over #4 Trujillo; power will rise to the top here.\n\n#6 DLR over #2 Parrilla; Though Andree beat him in their last meeting (Atlanta pro semis in January en route to his 11-10 win over Kane in the final) DLR is still 7-2 lifetime over his younger countryman. DLR in 5 games.\n\nProjected Final: Montoya over DLR. This would be a rematch of the 2018 final, when DLR seemed to just kind of go through the motions and lost 3,12 to Montoya. See, once you have the final determined, both players are on “the team” and the winner is more about bragging rights and title collection than anything else. Will DLR push to win another actual title or is he just interested in ensuring his spot on the team for future IRF competitions?\n\nWomen’s Singles Review\n\nNo real notable missing names from the Singles draw for the Women: the top 7-8 women in my book are all here and will make for some great quarters onward. Second tier pros like @Ana Laura Flores, Erin (Rivera) Groves, and Montserrat Perez are not here, nor are some of the top up and coming Mexican junior girls, but the draw is solid.\n\nHere’s a preview of what to look for.\n\nIn the 16s:\n\n#12 @Lucia Gonzalez, who has had enough past success that players know not to call her a “dark horse” any longer, should advance past #5 @DanielDaniela Rica .\n\n#3 @Montse Mejia faces a tough challenge from @Delia Aguilar to start\n\nIn the quarters:\n\n#1 @Paola Longoria , looking for what should be something like her 15th national singles title (our records are not complete), gets a tough quarterfinal opponent in #8 @Jessica Parrilla. Longoria moves on but not without getting pushed a bit.\n\n#12 Gonzalez is my pick to upset #4 @Nancy Enriquez here. She’s done it before and should do it again.\n\nThe match of the round is #3 Mejia versus the criminally under-seeded #6 @Alexandra Herrera, winner of the last two LPRT stops. These two doubles partners are good friends of course, and know each other’s game all too well, but Herrera’s form is spot on right now. Six month’s ago i’d have favored Mejia here, but now its Herrera’s match to lose.\n\n#2 @Samantha Salas should breeze into the semis with a win over veteran @Susy Acosta.\n\nIn the semis:\n\nLongoria should dominate against Lucia.\n\nHerrera should top Salas.\n\nFinal: for the third major tournament in a row its Longoria versus Herrera in the final. Will the tournament category matter here? Longoria needs to find a winning strategy and fast, because Alexandra has proven for two events in a row she can make drive serves, play clean, error-free racquetball and get wins. My gut says Longoria wins this, just because the National titles are so important to her.\n\nStreaming: it remains to be seen who will do the streaming down in Juarez. I’d follow FMR and RKT for now, to see if we can get some live streaming.\n\nThanks to the Tourney Directors @Favio Soto for putting this event on!\n\nReminder to Players!

But in singles this is more of the same; this was DLR’s 3rd Beach Bash singles title and Scott’s 3rd as well. Lastly, Faro & Espinal turn back the clock and take the CPRT title nearly 20 years after Faro made the finals of the first big-time rball event on these courts in 2004.\n\nThis year’s Beach Bash was A great tournament that featured a ton of first-time pros who “got it” and fit into the vibe of the event. One-wall is unique, as is the culture surrounding it, and there’s been nothing but positives about the event from all who were there.\n\nR2 Sports App home page for event: https://www.r2sports.com/tourney/home.asp?TID=31509\n\nTriple Crown Reports: here’s links to the “triple crown” winners of all the Outdoor majors, updated to the 2022 Beach Bash:\n\nMen’s Singles: http://rball.pro/74BC5A\n\nWomen’s Singles: http://rball.pro/1A00B2\n\nMen’s Doubles: http://rball.pro/E90109\n\nWomen’s Doubles: http://rball.pro/6DBFD5\n\nMixed Doubles: http://rball.pro/B63A8C\n\nLets review the notable matches in the Singles draws. First up, and first to be mostly competed, was the Men’s Singles draw.\n\nMen’s Singles Match report in the PRS database: http://rball.pro/6BFD79\n\nIn the 16s:\n\nSlight upset #8 @Mario Mercado taking out #9 @David Blatt. Blatt’s a one-wall specialist from NY, but Mercado has plenty of one-wall experience from playing at Stratton Woods in DC. He squeaked out a 21-19 win.\n\n#5 @Thomas Gerhardt got a solid win over top IRT touring international @CConrrado Moscoso . Gerhardt’s strategy was clear: drive serve on open court to get points, then force the indoor pro into awkward overhead shots on quadrant serving. Moscoso made multiple errors going for too good of a shot early, and Gerhardt rode the lead to the win. A textbook example of how outdoor players strategize their way to wins.\n\n#13 @Sebastian Franco upset the 4th seed William Rolon 21-14. A tough draw for Rolon, getting an “indoor” pro with a ton of one-wall experience at this juncture.\n\n– The biggest upset of all though was new-to-outdoor @Javier Mar taking out the 4-time champion #2 seed @Robert Sostre 22-20. Mar proved to be quite a quick study to outdoor and squeaked out a close win.\n\nIn the Quarters\n\n#1 @Daniel de la Rosa was mostly untroubled by #8 Mercado, advancing 21-13\n\n#13 Franco advanced past #5 Gerhardt 21-16.\n\nDC area one-wall enthusiast #6 @Dylan Pruitt got a statement win by taking out Hall of Famer #3 @FreFFreddy Ramirez with ease 21-11.\n\nMar continued his on-the-fly education, taking out a very capable outdoor player in #7 @Andres Acuna again by the 22-20 score line.\n\nYour semis are the #1, #13, #6 and #15 seeds.\n\nIn the Semis\n\n#1 DLR methodically topped #13 Franco 21-12 to move into the final.\n\n#15 Mar outclassed the youngster Pruitt 21-6 to move to the final.\n\nIn the Finals, Mar and DLR went toe to toe for much of the game, with Mar more than holding his own and showing an amazing combination of power and touch on the one-wall courts. But, DLR was just a hair better, taking the final 21-15. He wins his third Pro Singles title in Hollywood and 2nd running.\n\nWomen’s Pro Singles preview\n\nPRS Match Report: http://rball.pro/559CFB\n\nThe Women’s singles was one of the absolute first draws to get started on Thursday morning, and right off the bat we got the #1 seed and defending champion @Hollie Scott getting pressed by two fellow LPRT pros. She managed to top both @KKelani Lawrence and @Masiel Rivera Operto by the razer thin score-line of 22-20 to pave the way for a defense of her title. She finished off the sweep of the 4-person round robin with a comprehensive 21-8 win over @kKatie Neil to repeat as Beach Bash women’s singles champ.\n\nMen’s Pro Doubles review:\n\nMatch report in the PRS database: http://rball.pro/BA011F\n\nThere were upsets galore in the Men’s Doubles draw, from the round of 16 onwards. Lets recap the unpredictable draw.\n\nIn the 16s:\n\nThe #1 seeds and defending champs @BennGolden Benny and Ryan Lopez were handed their walking papers by the #17 seeded team of relative outdoor newbies (but regular IRT touring pros) @Andres Acuna and @Eduardo Portillo 9,10.\n\nCPRT champs Faro/Iggy took out the #8 seeds @Rick “Soda Man” Koll and @EEmmett Coe in a slight upset in the 8/9 match.\n\n2021 Vegas one-wall doubles winners Adam Manilla and Nick Riffel took out the 2018 Beach Bash Champs @WWilliam Rolon and @DaDavid Blatt (aka “The Warrior” and the “Hulkster”) in two solid games to advance.\n\nSingles finalist Mar teamed up with experienced one-wall player @MMario Mercado to take out @RoRocky Carson and @AlejaAlejandro Barceló in an upset in the 7/10 match.\n\nSo, four of your top 8 seeds were topped in the round of 16. But the upsets were just starting.\n\nIn the quarters:\n\n#17 Acuna/Lalo took out #9 Faro/Iggy in a match that went deep into the night, finishing under the lights on Garfield street. The young touring pros collaborated to take out two of the OGs of one-wall racquetball on these courts in a breaker.\n\n#12 Manilla/Riffel shocked the 2015 championsSebastian Franco and @Joe Young 1,8.\n\n#3 @RRobert Sostre and @DavDaDavid Horn held serve over the #6 seeds and 3-time champs Richie Miller and @Nelson Deida in dominant fashion 9,2 to move on.\n\nAnd in a massive upset, #10 Mar/Mercado took #2 DLR and @Alvaro Beltran in a tiebreaker. No career triple crown for DLR/Alvi this year.\n\nSo, #17, #12, #3 and #10 into your semis.\n\nIn the Semis …\n\nPortillo/Acuna blasted Riffel/Manilla 5,7 to move into the final. These two IRT regulars have really taken to outdoor.\n\nMercado/Mar nearly got whitewashed in game one, losing it 15-2, but then made adjustments like one-wall old hats to cruise to game 2 & 3 wins 15-7, 11-4 to move into the final over one-wall royalty in Sostre/Horn.\n\nIn the final: the two teams of IRT pros traded games, but Mercado & Mar pulled away in the breaker to take the title. Final score (12),13,3.\n\nWomen’s Pro Doubles review\n\nMatch report in the PRS database: http://rball.pro/E72C77\n\nSix teams competed for the Women’s pro doubles title, with some throwback teams and some surprising new teams.\n\nFrom the top, #1 seeds DLR/Scott outlasted the @Kathy Guinan / @Maira Ramos team (each of whom has won prior Pro doubles titles here), in one semi, while the #6 seeds @Erika Manilla and @Katie Neils took out both the #2 and #3 seeds to get to the finals themselves.\n\nIn that final … outdoor veteran Neils and outdoor newbie (but red-hot lately) Manilla completed the sweep of the top seeds here, ousting the #1 seeds and overwhelming favorites mDLR and Scott to take the title. Final score: 8,(10),1.\n\nFun fact; every match in the Women’s pro doubles draw went tiebreaker. Never seen that before.\n\nMixed Pro Doubles review\n\nMatch report in the PRS database: http://rball.pro/F553E8\n\nThe Mixed Pro draw was completed on Friday; the entire draw in one day, very Pickleball style. Here’s a recap.\n\nOn the top-half, what many think might be the best mixed doubles team of all time (the De La Rosa husband-wife pair) faced a stiff quarter final challenge against the under-seeded Rocky Carson/Kelani Lawrence team, but moved on to face NY one-wall specialists David Blatt (aka, the “Hulkster”) and @Susan Stephen in one semi. The New Yorkers pressed the Arizona duo, but fell 11-8 in the breaker.\n\nOn the bottom half, another under-seeded team of @Eduardo Portillo and Hollie Scott upset two higher ranked teams (Pagan/Roehler in the 16s then Riffel/Neils in the quarters) to make the Mixed semis. There they met the very tough team of Sostre/Rivera, who cruised past the Manillas in the quarters. The east coast duo of Sostre/Rivera outlasted the young duo of Lalo/Hollie to advance to the final.\n\nIn the final, Masiel and Iceman tried to break the DLR streak of wins, but fell in the breaker 11-5. The husband-wife team defends their 2019 title here and wins their 14th career pro outdoor Mixed doubles title together.\n\nCPRT Doubles review\n\nThough not tracked in the database, the CPRT takes on new importance in 2022 because it counts for the Cup series. So Let’s recap.\n\nThe top half of the CPRT draw went chalk, with #1 @Alvaro Beltran and @Rick “Soda Man” Koll advancing with ease into the semis. There they faced the sneaky-good Florida pair of @Eric Faro and @Ignacio “Iggy” Espinal.\n\nThe bottom half featured upsets, as 1988 IRT pro tour champ @Ruben González put down the pickleball paddle he was playing with in Hilton Head and came out of retirement to team with TiTo Montanez and upset the 3rd seeded team of one-wall experts Rolon/Young to advance to the semis. There they faced the dark-horse Florida team of @Max Heymann and Seran Ramkissoon , who won two rounds and upset #2 Freddy Ramierz and @Albert Jimenez to make the semis. Heymann and Seran made fast work of the legends to advance to the final.\n\nIn the final … the experience of Faro & Iggy (Faro is one of the few players who was at the original 2004 outdoor nationals event and is still playing here this weekend) outlasted the upstart Floridians; they take the CPRT title 7,7.\n\nThanks for all the streaming on the weekend, especially from the LPRT-sponsored broadcast team of JT R Ball, Vic Leibofsky , and friends.\n\nThanks to the Tourney Directors @Peggine Tellez and @Mike Coulter for putting this event on!\n\nReminder to Players!

One of my favorite tourneys every year.\n\nFrom an Outdoor Major perspective, Leg 2 on the “Road to Vegas” is Outdoor Nationals in July. The r2 site is live now; reserve your spot and start making travel plans to visit sunny Southern California.\n\nBefore that though; breaking news: 3WallBall is partnering with the IRT to host a Sunday May 1 Outdoor shootout the day after the IRT pro stop finishes in Fullerton in a month’s time. More details coming, but basically we’ll run a one-day pro shootout for all the travelling pros to play the day after the tournament saturday night finish.\n\ntags\n\nAssociations\n\nWorld Outdoor Racquetball\n\nUSA Racquetball\n\nLPRT\n\nInternational Racquetball Tour\n\nMajor Sponsors\n\n@Formulaflow\n\n@onewallball.com\n\n3WallBall Outdoor World Championships\n\nMC Vegas\n\n@AAGE SOLUTIONS / Andy Gomer\n\nAPCON / MZ Companies / @Abel Perez\n\n@Team Dovetail / Mike Kinkin : a special thanks to Team Dovetal for enabling a slew of pros to make this event.\n\nDaily Racquetball\n\nHashtags #racquetball #proracquetball #outdoorracquetball #irt #lprt #wor\n\nUSAR Intercollegiates Re-cap\n\nIn addition to two other major events this past weekend, USA Racquetball hosted its Intercollegiates tournament for the first time in two years. After having 2020 cancelled last minute due to the fast rising Covid issue, then not even attempting to organize for 2021, we’re back for 2022.\n\nThe host this year was, for the first time since 2017, not technically a University. To avoid any last minute mask mandate policy changes, USAR kept the tournament in Tucson (where the University of Arizona was intended to be the host), but moved the event to the beautiful Tucson Racquet & Fitness Center.\n\nr2sports home page: https://www.r2sports.com/tourney/home.asp?TID=38237\n\nHere’s a recap of the events\n\nCongrats to your winners:\n\nMen’s #1 Singles: Ariel Tito, CSU-Pueblo\n\nWomen’s #1 Singles: Annie Roberts , University of the Pacific\n\nMen’s #1 Doubles: @Arthur Schmeiser and @Ben Baron , Northern Arizona\n\nWomen’s #1 Doubles: Roberts & @Alondra Canche , University of the Pacific\n\nMen’s Team: Missouri\n\nWomen’s Team: Missouri\n\n– Overall Team: Missouri\n\nComments on the results with some fun facts.\n\nThanks to a two year gap in competition, we were guaranteed two new Singles champions. The reigning champions from 2019 (Erik Garcia and @Hollie Scott have both matriculated from college. This opens up the door for a brand new set of competitors in both main singles draws, and some familiar names from recent USA Junior competitions were in the mix.\n\nIn the Boys #1, Bolivian Junior Ariel Tito, now attending the racquetball mecca of Colorado State University at Pueblo, made a big statement this weekend, beating three higher seeded players as the #6 seed to take the final over #2 Ben Baron. Tito’s only previous IRT experience was in a PAC shootout lower tier event last year, and he’ll see his USA Ranking rocket up after his comprehensive win in the final 9,3.\n\nIn the Girls #1, the final was competed by two familiar faces to those who watch the LPRT. There, former Junior national champ @Annie Robert cruised to the title, never giving up more than 6 points in a game. In the final she topped Texas-native @Shane Diaz 6,4 to take her first intercollegiates title.\n\nThis win represents the 9th ever Men’s singles #1 win for a player from CSU Pueblo; they are gaining ground win by win on the leader, that being Memphis State (now U of Memphis). This is the first ever Women’s #1 title for a player from the U of the Pacific (2nd overall, as @Marco Rojas won the 2016 men’s #1 while playing for that university).\n\nIn the Men’s #1 Doubles, it was a rematch of teams featuring the two singles finalists, but NAU’s Baron teamed with Schmeiser to top Tito and his partner @Samuel Lazcano\n\nto take the title.\n\nIn the Women’s #1 Doubles, Roberts teamed with Canchola to take the title. They topped Missouri’s Kate Zawalski / Abby Lachance in the final.\n\nIn the team competition…Missouri made a clean sweep of the team event, winning all three team competitions. Your team results top 3 in each category:\n\nMen’s: Missouri, BYU, Northern Arizona (nau)\n\nWomen’s: Missouri, Pacific, BYU\n\nOverall: MIssouri, BYU, Oregon State\n\nThis represents the first team title of any kind for Missouri in the 48-year history of intercollegiates. Its also the first time we’ve had a clean sweep by a college since Oregon State in 2013.\n\nCongrats to all the participants and to USA Racquetball and @Shane Conner for tournament direction. Thanks to Leo Vazquez for streaming all weekend.\n\nWarhawk Open Recap\n\nIn addition to Intercollegiates and Beach Bash, the racquetball fanatics down in Louisiana had their annual Warhawk Open this weekend, and it featured a stacked draw of players. Since this tournament ended first, we’ll publish this recap first 🙂\n\nThe tournament was an IRT Tier 4 event, and drew a huge 29-man pro draw that included several regular IRT touring pros, a slew of the best Open players from the Southwestern states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, the Kelley twins from the NJ/NY area, and one special guest all the way from St. Louis in the legend himself Marty Hogan .\n\nLets recap the pro draw.\n\nSix of the top eight seeds advanced to the quarters; one exception being (of course) Mr Hogan, who topped @Hayden Farmer, a solid player who upset #5 @Bob Jackson in the first round. The other upset by seed was #10 @Sam Kelley topping 16U Texan Cole Sendry to move on.\n\nFrom there, chalk to the semis:\n\n#1 @Thomas Carter , fresh off a decent pro showing in Chicago, topped Alabama’s #1 @DDestry Everhart\n\n#4 @Joe Kelley, all the way down from Jersey with his brother, was the one to put Hogan out of his misery here 3,3\n\n#3 @Austin Cunningham , a part time IRT player from Georgia, made fast work of Texas’ @Zach Williams\n\n#2 IRT veteran @Robert Collin cruised past the right-handed Kelley brother Sam to make the semis.\n\nIn the semis, Lefty Carter took out lefty Kelley 8,6, while Lefty Collins went the distance against Cunningham, pushed to an 11-10 win. It may have taken something out of the Hawaiian, as he was taken out in the final 10,2 to give Carter the title.\n\nIn the Doubles bracket…\n\nCarter and his partner Raymond Flowers looked like they were going to give Carter the double on the weekend, advancing with relative ease to the final from the top as the #1 seed.\n\nOn the bottom side of the draw, Lefty/Righty brother/brother Kelleys upset both the #2 and #3 seeds en route to the final.\n\nIn that final, the #6 seeded Kelley brothers made the trip worth it, taking out Carter/Flowers 11,2 to win.\n\nCongrats to the Louisiana Monroe team for a great event. Thanks to tournament directors @Mark Thompson, Raj Bhandari , and Steve Semones for running the event, and thanks to all the local sponsors.\n\n2022 Beach Bash Preview\n\nAfter a 2 year hiatus, Beach Bash is back! The best one-wall players in the land are descending as we speak to South Florida to join the Spring Breakers and to play some racquetball on the historic Garfield Street courts, right off the Boardwalk in Hollywood, Florida.\n\nThis will be the 14th iteration of what was first called “Beach Bash for Cash,” which started in 2007. It was the follow-on tournament to the seminal 2004 WOR One-Wall National Doubles Championships held on these same courts, which was a formative event in the history of WOR and Outdoor Racquetball in this country in general.\n\nIt is great to have this tournament back … and judging by the talent of players entered, so is the community at large.\n\nA huge number of regular “indoor” touring pros are entered this week, including 5 of the current top 10 on the IRT and a slew of regular touring LPRT pros. They are joined by a literal who’s who of top one-wall outdoor players from DC, NY, and FL to compete for the pro titles. This weekend’s event shall be great.\n\nFurther adding to the import of the year’s first outdoor “major” is the inclusion of the new Outdoor Cup Series for 2022. Winners here this weekend will have a big leg-up on the competition for the “Road to Vegas” year-long cup series.\n\nR2 Sports App link: https://www.r2sports.com/tourney/home.asp?TID=31509\n\nLets preview the draws. There’s a ton of pro draws, singles and doubles, so we’ll run through them with some thoughts given in each competition.\n\nMen’s Pro Doubles\n\nA stacked Men’s pro doubles draw is headlined by the #1 seeds and defending champs Ryan Lopez and @Benny Goldenberg. Seeded #2 is the top outdoor doubles team of @Daniel de la Rosa and @Alvaro Beltran , who together have won six Major outdoor pro doubles titles, including the last five straight Vegas 3-wall pro titles. But, Beltran injured his hip in the IRT event last weekend … and this is one-wall, not three-wall (where all their titles together are), so DLR/Beltran may not be the favorites here.\n\nThe rest of the draw is littered with top pairs with past titles. The top half features @David Blatt and William Rolon as the #4 seeds (they were the 2018 Beach Bash champs), the hard hitting #5 seeded team of @Sebastian Franco and @Joe Young (the 2015 Beach Bash champs), the 2021 Vegas one-wall pro doubles champs as a #12 seed (that being @Adam Manilla and @Nick Riffel ), and then we throw in top outdoor one-wall player @Rick Koll playing with perhaps the land’s best paddleball player in @Emmitt Coe.\n\nThat’s a stacked draw … and its just the top half of this bracket.\n\nChallenging DLR/Beltran from the bottom half include the #3 seeded team of Sostre and David Horn (Sostre has 4 Beach Bash titles and another 4 finals), teams comprised of top IRT touring players like Conrrado Moscoso , Mario Mercado , and @Javier Mar, and long-time outdoor player @Tito Montanez playing with the legend himself Ruben González. Lastly there’s #6 seeded team of @Nelsen Dieda and @Richie Miller … Miller and Dieda together made 5 straight Beach Bash pro doubles finals between 2013 and 2018, winning three of them, and Miller himself made the final of every Beach Bash pro doubles event for 8 straight years.\n\nWhoever comes out of the bottom will have more than earned it.\n\nPredictions? I like Lopez/Benny from the top to beat Franco/Young in the semis. From the bottom, whoever wins the 3/6 matchup between Sostre/Horn and Miller/Deida runs to the title. I’m leaning Miller/Deida, but wouldn’t be surprised if the strength of Iceman on the one-wall court pulls them to the final.\n\nWomen’s Pro Doubles\n\nThere’s several tough teams in this Women’s pro doubles draw, each of whom you could make an argument for winning. Scott (the 2018 winner) is playing with the most decorated women’s outdoor doubles player in the land in @Michelle De La Rosa: they’re the #1 seed. But they have to get by the Zerega-veteran team of Ramos/Guinan to make the final.\n\nOn the bottom half two-time Beach Bash champ and outdoor legend @Anita Maldonado is playing with three-time winner @Jasmine Suarez ; they’ll likely face the very tough doubles team of Hall of Famer Aimee Roehler and LPRT touring pro @MasieMasiel Rivera in the bottom half.\n\nGreat matches ahead; my money is on Roehler/Rivera to top mDLR/Scott in the final.\n\nMixed Pro Doubles\n\nIts tough not to look at this draw and immediately predict a #1 vs #2 final, given who is there and how they generally fare in these events. #1 Seeds and defending champs the De La Rosa husband/wife pair\n\nwill be pushed in the semis by 2015 Mixed pro champs Maldonado/Deida, while the #2 seeded team of Sostre/Rivera will face a gauntlet of interesting pairings of experienced outdoor players playing with solid indoor-only partners (teams such as Portillo/Scott, or Riffel/Neils, or Pagan/Roehler, or even the Manilla bro/sis combo).\n\nAt the end of the day though, i’m going chalk to the finals with another title for the De La Rosas.\n\nMen’s Pro Singles:\n\n19 players are entered into Men’s pro singles, trying to dethrone the two favorites and two top seeds in 2019’s finalists @Daniel de la Rosa and @Robert Sostre. DLR took out IceMan in the 2019 singles final, breaking Sostre’s streak of four straight titles in the event.\n\nFrom the top side of the draw, DLR will face an immediate threat from a seasoned one-wall expert in @Tito Montanez in the 16s, before having to navigate possibly against 2019 semi finalist @William Rolon in the semis. That’s if Rolon can get past the winner of @Thomas Gerhardt and Conrrado Moscoso , who is playing one-wall for the first time and could be a dark-horse thanks to his extensive experience playing Fronton in his native Bolivia.\n\nFrom the bottom side, #2 Sostre may face a heavy challenge in the quarters from #7 @Andres Acuna , who topped two excellent outdoor singles players in 2019 en route to the 3WB outdoor final. Otherwise, the projection would be for Iceman to meet his long-time doubles partner Freddy Ramirez in the semis for a shot at the title.\n\nDespite all the talent in the draw, look for a rematch of the 2019 final when all is said and done and for DLR to retain the title. He’s just too strong on the outdoor courts and is in the peak of his playing years.\n\nWomen’s Pro Singles .\n\nTwo time defending Beach Bash pro singles winner Hollie Scott is here to defend her title. She’ll take on a round robin of fellow LPRT touring pros and Outdoor veterans, trying to dethrone her.\n\nMy prediction: Scott rolls to another pro title.\n\nLook for Streaming on the LPRT feed for the weekend, with JT R Ball flying into town from Southern California to man the mike with a series of guest stars all weekend.\n\nThanks to the Tourney Directors @Peggine Tellez and the @3WallBall Outdoor World Championships team (Mike Coulter) for putting this event on!

Mar/Montoya take their 3rd pro doubles title together in dominant fashion.\n\nR2 Sports App home page for event: https://www.r2sports.com/website/event-website.asp?TID=38590\n\nLets review the notable matches in the Singles draw.\n\nSingles Match report in the PRS database: http://rball.pro/BF73A5\n\nThe round of 64 was relatively straight-forward with expected results. But the round of 32 had some serious fireworks and some serious upsets. A number of players had career wins. Here’s a run through:\n\n#16 Thomas Carter put down a statement, splitting the first two games with #17 @Eduardo Garay before racing to a dominant 11-1 tiebreaker win. This is a very solid win over a strong player, one of the best of Carter’s IRT career.\n\nThe biggest upset of the round was #9 Jake Bredenbeck , who made the final of this event last October, falling to the little known Mexican Jordy Alonso 12,10. Alonso is a rare IRT participant, but has been getting more time on the court lately and nets a huge win.\n\nWe’ve been predicting it for a while, but the defending World 18U champion @Erick Trujillo finally got a breakthrough win over a big-time touring pro, taking out #12 @Sebastian Franco in a tight 11-9 breaker. Trujillo will have a similar looking match in the next round against #5 Murray and could go further.\n\n#14 @Andres Acuña got a very solid win over #19 @Javier Mar in a breaker. Though not an upset by the seeds, Mar’s ranking has taken a tumble from its peak in the upper teens after taking time off to heal. This was another in a long line of incrementally excellent wins for Acuna, as he continues to improve on tour.\n\n#11 @Alvaro Beltran split games with @Erick Cuevas before settling down and dominating the breaker 11-0 to move on.\n\n– In what was likely the most entertaining match of the round, two power players from Mexico faced off in the 15/18 match-up, and the former World Champion @RRodrigo Montoya held off match-point against in the breaker to advance past @Sebastian Fernandez 4,(10),10.\n\nIn the 16s, some normalcy returned to the draw with 7 of the 8 top seeds advancing, but the one upset was a big one.\n\n#1 @Daniel de la Rosa held serve against #17 Carter 11,12 in a match that was a big closer than I expected. Bravo to Carter for pressing the #1.\n\n#8 Rocky Carson blew past the upset-minded Alonso to move into the quarters.\n\n#5 Samuel Murray held off the phenom Trujillo 9,12 to move into the quarters.\n\n#4 @Alejandro Landa , who hasn’t been seeded this low in an event since Oct 2019, went tiebreaker with the improving Manilla but moved on to setup a meeting with his doubles partner.\n\n#3 @Kane Waselenchuk was the least “troubled” in the round, crushing the Costa Rican #1 Acuna 3,3 to move on with ease.\n\n#6 @Eduardo Portillo , coming off a knee injury, got a fortunate walk-over against #11 @Alvaro Beltran (who injured a hip in his double match earlier in the evening) to get into the quarters without much fanfare.\n\n#7 @Conrrado Moscoso made a statement, taking out an opponent who has pressed him in the past in #10 @Mario Mercado with ease 6,4 to get to the quarters yet again.\n\n– And in the biggest upset of the day, #2 @Andree Parrilla ‘s difficult draw caught up with him, as he couldn’t convert match point opportunities in game two and fell 11-9 to his long-time rival @Rodrigo Montoya . Parrilla’s run of semis or better at this event comes to an end.\n\nIn the Quarters\n\n#1 DLR seemed completely frustrated with his shot-making on the day, while #8 Carson turned back the clock and played some of the most complete racquetball i’ve seen out of him in years, upsetting Daniel 11,4 to move into the semis.\n\n#5 Landa held off his long-time doubles partner #4 Murray after an incredibly slow start, dropping the first game 15-3 before rebounding to win the second 15-1 and outlasting the Canadian in the breaker 11-7. Landa’s emotions got the best of him on the day from a professionalism perspect ive, but he moves on.\n\n#3 Waselenchuk made fast work of the knee-hampered youngster Lalo 7,5.\n\n– #7 Moscoso cruised past an opponent in Montoya who he had never beaten before 6,12, getting another statement win. Montoya started very slowly (because he was late getting to his match), and Moscoso came out firing. Montoya made it closer in game two, but Moscoso’s relentless drive serves earned him lots of Aces and lots of 3-shot rallies on the day. He moves on to a highly anticipated semi.\n\nIn the Semis\n\n#8 Carson continued his hot streak, dropping a close first game to Landa before blowing him out in the second and outlasting him in the breaker 11-9. He gets back to a final for the first time since November 2019.\n\n#3 Kane dominated #7 Moscoso in the highly anticipated semi 6,7. Moscoso’s shot making wasn’t up to the level of Kane’s, who continued making short work of his opponents here.\n\nIn the Finals, we get a throwback match-up; a final between Rocky and Kane, something we saw week in and week out for years. Their 82nd career meeting ended as most of them had; with a Kane win 6,9.\n\nPoints Implications of results\n\nThis win should jump Kane up one spot over Parrilla to take over #2 on tour. He will still be 1100 points or so behind DLR, but has the rest of the year to make that up. There’s little other movement in the top 20 anticipated.\n\nDoubles review\n\nMatch report in the PRS database: http://rball.pro/FCC970\n\nThe story of the Doubles draw was the early exit of the #1 team of DLR/Beltran. They were taken out 11-8 in the breaker by the rapidly improving Carson/Lalo team. The other three top seeds advanced to the semis, setting up some great doubles action.\n\nIn the pro doubles semis:\n\n#4 Keller/Moscoso, the reigning Bolivian champs and who have made the finals of the last three major IRF championships took out the Carson/Lalo team…. but not without having to survive match points against in an 11-10 breaker.\n\n#2 Mar/Montoya (who barely survived their quarterfinal) rebounded against Big Canada/Big Minnesota (aka Jake and Sam) 11,11 to setup a great rematch of the last three major IRF finals.\n\nIn that final, the Mexicans again topped the Bolivians, as they have done in the last two major IRF finals, to take the crown 9,9.\n\nIn Men’s Open, the top four seeds advanced to the semis. #1 Mercado topped #4 Cuevas in one semi, #2 Acuna topped #3 Trujillo in the other semi, then Mario outlasted Acuna 11-10 to take the open title.\n\nThanks for all the streaming on the weekend, especially from broadcasters Dean Baer, Favio Soto, Pablo Fajre and the IRTLive crew\n\nThanks to the Tourney Directors Geoff Peters and @Dan Jaskier for putting this event on!\n\nReminder to Players!

The 37th annual Shamrock shootout is back in its normal spot around St. Patricks’ day, and the tour is happy to be back in Chicago as well.\n\nR2 Sports App link: https://www.r2sports.com/website/event-website.asp?TID=38590\n\nThere’s 31 men’s pros entered here this weekend, the weekend after many countries held their national selection events ahead of next month’s Pan American Racquetball Championships (PARC) in Bolivia. This has caused some of the normal international players to take the weekend off.\n\nTop players missing from the draw include #12 Carlos Keller (fresh off his finals appearance in Bolivian Nationals), but he’s the only player in the top 20 missing here. A great draw. We see a return to action of @Javier Mar, who was nursing an injury for months that kept him out of singles action. We also see @Educardo Garay back in action after missing the past couple of events.\n\nLets preview the draw. With only 31 players, there’s two qualifying rounds. I see mostly straightforward wins from expected winners in the first round, so lets pick up with the Round of 32. Nearly every round of 32 match is going to be compelling, with interesting storylines.\n\nHere’s what i’m looking forward to there:\n\n#16 v #17 Garay versus @Thomas Carter . Garay probably is the better player, but hasn’t played in months on tour. Can Carter pull an upset?\n\n#9 @Jake Bredenbeck takes on @Jordy Alonso, a dangerous lower seed who can play well above his ranking. I don’t think this is an upset, but Alonso may push him.\n\n#12 @Sebastian Franco is an upset watch against up and coming Mexican junior @Erik Trujillo. He’ll look to setup a rematch against a top 8 pro in the 16s.\n\nTwo American lefties take on each other as @Adam Manilla and @Robert Collins battle it out. Look for the Colorado pro to take out the Hawaiian pro.\n\nIn Mar’s return to action, he faces a tall task in the fast improving #14 @Andres Acuna. Acuna is fresh of a title in Minnesota where he topped two top-10 players, and Mar’s rustiness probably prevents him from playing up to his normal top levels. Look for Acuna to move on.\n\n– In my favorite match of the round, @Rodrigo Montoya takes on @Sebastian Fernandez in what should be an enjoyable shootout of power and athleticism. On paper Montoya is the better player, but Fernandez has the capabilities to move on.\n\nround of 16:\n\n#1 @Daniel De La Rosa should move on easily from Garay or Carter.\n\n#8 @Rocky Carson faces a tough opponent in Bredenbeck. They met in Atlanta, a close 14,11 win for Rocky. Can Jake close the gap? Look for the veteran to move on again.\n\n#5 @Samuel Murray gets started against the Franco/Trujillo winner, and should move past either player.\n\n#4 @Alex Landa likely faces lefty Manilla in the 16s, a tricky match for the former #1. Manilla’s online training gig has him on the courts a ton, whereas Landa is seemingly at a career cross roads. Upset watch here.\n\n#3 @Kane Waselenchuk was a last minute confirmation for the event, and is inarguably a favorite. He starts off against a friendly face in Acuna, who may get some points but will serve mostly as Kane’s warmup for the latter rounds despite his recent successes.\n\n#6 @Eduardo Portillo is back in action after a knee injury suffered in Atlanta kept him out of action for 2 months. He is set to face the veteran Beltran, who can still play. Where is Lalo in his recovery? If he’s still a step slow, Beltran’s crafty game will be hard to beat. Upset watch here.\n\n#7 @Conrrado Moscoso is fresh off his latest Bolivian National title, but faces a very tricky opponent in Mercado here. Mercado plays him tough every time; expect two tight games.\n\n– #2 @Andree Parrilla is Mr. Chicago: his first ever pro final was here in 2017, and his first ever pro win was here in 2018. He’s made the semis the last three years after that. He loves this court and will be hard to beat. But his projected round of 16 opponent will be a troublesome one: if its Montoya, its a player in his same age class who has been playing him (and often beating him) for years. If its Patata, its a guy who won’t back down and will make him earn every point. Look for a struggle here but for Andree to prevail.\n\nProjected Qtrs:\n\nThere’s really only one quarterfinal i’m looking forward to … but here’s all four projected.\n\n#1 DLR will top #8 Carson to move on. DLR has topped Rocky every time they’ve played lately and will again here.\n\n#4 Landa, if he gets here, should handle his doubles partner #5 Murray, if he gets here. But both players have had iffy results lately, so this could also be some combination of Franco and Manilla. Possible wildcard semi finalist coming out of this quadrant.\n\n#3 Kane should cruise past his long-time rival Beltran, or will test Lalo’s rehabbed knee for him in this quarter to move on.\n\nThe big one: #2 Parrilla versus #7 Moscoso. They’ve met three times; once at the 2017 US Open (a 5-game Moscoso win that was part of his coming out party), then a Parrilla win in 2019, then a Moscoso win last December at Worlds. They’re neck and neck in my personal rankings; this is a coin flip. These are the two winners of the last two pro stops. Parrilla loves Chicago, Moscoso beat him in their last matchup and is coming off a title in Bolivia. I’m going to go with Moscoso in an upset.\n\nSemis:\n\nDLR over Landa if the seeds hold: Landa holds a pretty definitive career W/L record over DLR … 9-3 on the IRT and 10-5 in all top-level competitions. However, they have not played since March of 2020, which is basically when Landa plateaued as a professional. I think DLR is a step ahead now, and moves into the final here.\n\nWaselenchuk over Moscoso; this is a great match, a rematch of the fantastic 2019 US open final. Kane has never really been threatened by Conrrado … and in fact destroyed him the last time they played in Austin in 2019. Conrrado needs a strategy to win, much as Andree had a strategy going into the Atlanta final. I’m not sure Conrrado as a player has the capability of devising a strategy right now; that’s why he takes losses against lesser players despite probably being the 2nd most talented player on earth. Look for a Kane win.\n\nFinals; we finally get (hopefully) Daniel versus Kane. Current #1 versus long-time #1. Man, I hope it happens.\n\nDLR, like Parrilla, is a thinking man on the court, a player who depends less on power and more on shot-making. He can handle Kane’s power. When they’ve played recently, Daniel gets his points. The scores were Kane wins, but it was 9 and 10, 8 and 10, 11 and 6. That was 2-3 years ago; what happens now?\n\nI’m thinking tie-breaker, with Kane pulling it out and returning to the winner’s circle. But if Daniel maintains his cool and is not overwhelmed by the import of the match, this could be another upset win over the long-time King.\n\nDoubles review\n\nWe thought perhaps we’d get a return to competition the venerable pairing of Kane and @Ben Croft, but they’re not in the draw. What we do have though is a stacked draw of solid international teams here to prepare for Beach Bash and for PARC.\n\nFrom the top I like #1 DLR/Beltran to take out the Bolivian champs Moscoso/Keller in one semi, while the #2 Montoya/Mar takes out the team Beastmade Clothing Bredenbeck/Murray pairing in the other semi. In the final. a frequent matchup on tour and in Mexican Nationals will see the younger pairing winning out over the veteran Mexican pair.\n\nLook for Streaming in the regular places; follow the IRT on Facebook and sign up to get notifications when they go Live.\n\nLook for Dean Baer, Favio Soto, Pablo Fajre and the IRTLive crew all weekend on the mike, calling the shots!\n\nThanks to the Tourney Directors Dan Jaskier andGeoff Peters for putting this event on!\n\nReminder to Players!

Here’s a quick run through of what was a very busy weekend globally for racquetball.\n\nUS High School Nationals.\n\nr2sports site: https://www.r2sports.com/tourney/home.asp?TID=38151\n\nOne of the biggest tournaments of the year (by pure attendance) was held last weekend: the 2022 @USA Racquetball High School Nationals event, held at the Vetta Sports clubs in St. Louis.\n\nNearly 350 High School players from around the country were in St. Louis to compete for singles, doubles, and team competitions. Here’s a recap of the #1/Gold competitions on the weekend…\n\nBoys #1 Gold Singles: #1 @Josh Shea from New York topped #2 @AnAndrew Gleason from Iowa. In a likely precursor to the 18U Junior Nationals final later this year, Shea won the first HS title for a New Yorker since … @sSudsy Monchik won in 1991.\n\nGirls #1 Gold Singles: #2 @Naomi Ros from San Antonio upset #1 seed @Heather Mahoney. Ros recently relocated from Mexico and topped Mahoney in the 2021 Junior Nationals, setting up a rivalry that is set to run for a couple more years on the US junior national scene. She becomes the first ever titlist from a Texas HS on the girl’s side.\n\nBoys #1 Doubles: Jacob Schmidt / Gabe Collins from Christian Brothers College High School in St Louis cruised to the title as the #1 seed.\n\nGirls #1 Doubles: Heather Mahoney / Ava Naworski from Casa Grande High School outside of Santa Rosa HS took the title as the #3 seeds.\n\nMixed #1 Doubles: Ros teamed with DJ Mendoza (the #4 seed in Boys #1 gold) to cruise to the Mixed doubles title.\n\nThe team competition was dominated by Missouri/St Louis area high schools:\n\nBoys’ Team: St. Louis University HS\n\nGirl’s Team: Lafayette HS\n\nOverall Team: Kirkwood HS\n\nCongrats to everyone who played, organized and participated. Thanks to @LLeo Vasque ‘s tireless work on the stream all weekend.\n\nLPRT Boston Open Draws\n\nr2sports site: https://www.r2sports.com/website/event-website.asp?TID=38579\n\nConnecticut’s top player @Jose Flores upset the #1 seeded @John Behm to take the 24-man Open draw from Boston this weekend.\n\nWomen’s Open: as noted in the LPRT wrap-up, Micaela Meneses had a great women’s Open tournament, topping LPRT regulars Lotts, Lawrence and Munoz to take the title.\n\nPAC Pueblo Athletic Shootout IRT recap\n\nr2sports: https://www.r2sports.com/website/event-website.asp?TID=38852\n\nSeveral IRT touring regulars traveled to Colorado to compete in the PAC shootout.\n\nThe four IRT regulars all advanced to the singles semis as expected. From there, #1 Andree Parrilla topped #4 @NNick Riff while @David Horn took out his colleague @Adam Manilla in the other semi to setup an All-WRT alumni final.\n\nIn that final, Parrilla cruised to the title, topping Horn 2,5.\n\nIn doubles, Horn and Manilla were unstoppable, cruising to the pro doubles title over #2 seeds Riffel and @Mike O’Brien in the final.\n\nMinnesota Hall of Fame IRT Tier 3\n\nr2sports: https://www.r2sports.com/website/event-website.asp?TID=38807\n\nA solid mid-western flair draw of top players descended to Fridley over the weekend for the Hall of Fame tournament. This included the IRT broadcast team of @DeDDean Baer and @PFPablo Fajre , who made friends with a local kangaroo and called some matches.\n\nr2sports site: https://www.r2sports.com/website/event-website.asp?TID=38807\n\nCongrats to local open amateurs @John Goth , Blake Hansen , and Lee Meinerz , who joined the 5 touring pros in the pro quarters.\n\nFrom there, Canadian #1 @Samuel Murray topped #5 Jordy Alonso in one semi, while #3 @Andres Acuña upset home-town favorite @Jake Bredenbeck in the other semi.\n\nIn the singles final…Acuna played solid ball to top Murray 10,7 to take the singles title.\n\nIn the Doubles draw, the Bredenbeck brothers took out Murray playing with Canadian Ledu Michael in the final.\n\nLastly, several countries have been holding Nationals events or National team selection events ahead of next month’s Pan American Racquetball Championships. Results are a little hard to come by since no international countries use r2sports outside of the “big 3” … but here’s what we’ve been able to glean from various Facebook Posts:\n\nCosta Rica held their men’s championships last weekend; in the men’s final: Andres Acuna d Gabriel Garcia 6,7,5. This is somewhat of a changing of the guard, as @FelipFelipe Camacho has represented the country for many, many years.\n\nColombia held a Men’s Selection event in Pereia, COL over the weekend.\n\nGuatemala held their Men’s Selection event this past week and weekend (Women’s will be next weekend). The 4 semi finalists competed (presumably) in a RR draw; here was the results:\n\n@EdwEdwin Galicia\n\n@Juan Jose Salvatierra\n\nChristian Wer\n\nGeovani Mendoza\n\nThe top 3 will represent Guatemala, with Mendoza as the alternate.\n\nLPRT Boston Open Recap\n\nCongrats to your winners on the weekend:\n\nSingles: Alexandra Herrera\n\nDoubles: Paola Longoria & Samantha Salas\n\nR2 Sports App home page for event: https://www.r2sports.com/website/event-website.asp?TID=38579\n\nLets review the notable matches in the Singles draw.\n\nSingles Match report in the PRS database: http://rball.pro/F91610\n\nIn the 32s:\n\n@Hollie Scott and Maria Renee Rodriguez split two close games in their 16/17 match-up before Scott pulled away with a dominant 11-1 tiebreaker win.\n\nThe ever improving junior Micaela Meneses took a game off of #13 @Erika Manila before falling in a breaker.\n\n@Crist’ Amaya got a solid win over fellow veteran tour player @Nancy Enriquez 11-5 in the breaker.\n\n– #11 @Carla Munoz reversed the script against @Jenny Daza , topping her 9,9 to move on. Daza had gotten the big upset over Munuz in this round just last tournament.\n\nIn the 16s:\n\nScott made #1 @Paola Longoria work for her round of 16 win, pushing the top player 12,11 in their round of 16 matchup.\n\n#5 @Natalia Mendez was challenged by her younger Argentinian rival @Valeria Centellas before advancing 11-7 in the breaker.\n\n#13 Manilla got her fifth win over a top-5 seed on tour since October, downing #4 @Gaby Martinez in a hard-fought close match. She took the first game 15-13, then Gaby raced to a huge lead in game two before Erika pulled it all the way back. They traded blows at match point before Gaby’s athletic exploits pushed a tiebreaker. There, Manilla looked to run away with the breaker before Gaby scored 7 unanswered to push for an amazing comeback … but Manilla got the 11-8 win.\n\n#3Maria Jose Vargas battled through some illness and outlasted the veteran Amaya in a tiebreaker.\n\n– #7 @Montse Mejia put a statement down , crushing #10 @Brenda Laime 8,1 to move into the quarters.\n\nIn the Quarters, a couple of surprising results.\n\n#1 Longoria made fast work of her doubles partner Salas 5,7\n\n#5 Mendez avenged herself in a rematch against Manilla, winning in a tie-breaker to avoid two upsets in two tournaments.\n\n#3 Vargas could not overcome both illness and #6 Barrios, losing in a tie-breaker.\n\n– #2 Herrera outlasted her doubles partner Mejia, dropping the middle game but running away with it in the tiebreaker.\n\nIn the Semis\n\nLongoria made quick work of Mendez 7,5 and was in cruise control for most of the match.\n\nHerrera was not troubled by the young Bolivian Barrios 6,5 and setup the anticipated rematch of last week’s final in Vero Beach.\n\nIn the Finals…. another shocker. Herrera dominated in game one 15-8, then for a while it looked like Longoria had found another gear, racing to a 12-1 game two win. Instead of packing it in, Herrera fought back and saved game points against to take game two 15-14 in a pretty amazing comeback win.\n\nHerrera’s second career win moves her into the top 20 all time of tour wins. Longoria loses in the final for the second tourney in a row … something that hadn’t happened since the fall of 2010, when she lost two successive finals to Rajsich (also the last time she lost to the same person in two straight events). Is this a changing of the guard? Or a blip on Longoria’s resume?\n\nPoints Implications of results: I don’t see a ton of movement in the top 10 after this tourney. Herrera solidifies her grip on #2 and closes the gap a bit on #1. Gaby maintains a slight lead on Mendez for #4.\n\nFurther down, some more significant movement. Manilla should move up to #12 and Lawrence should move to #15, edging slowly to the top 10. Meneses continues to rise; she’s nearly in the top 20 now. Lastly two more appearances for Daza and Rico have them both inside the top 30.\n\nDoubles review.\n\nHollie Scott had the tournament of her career, driving the all-American duo of Scott & Lawrence to the pro doubles final. They took out Vargas & Mendez in the quarters, then Herrera/Mejia in the semis. In the final though, they couldn’t overtake the #1 duo of Longoria/Salas, falling in a breaker.\n\nLongoria & Salas win their 35th pro doubles title together since August 2014. Amazing.\n\nMatch report in the PRS database: http://rball.pro/F5E7DA\n\nWomen’s Open\n\nMeneses may have lost in the first round of pros to Manilla, but she took out several pros en route to the Women’s Open title. She took out local player @Jolene Sullivan in the round of 16, then beat Lotts, Lawrence, and Munoz for the title. Great wins.\n\nThanks for all the streaming on the weekend, especially from broadcasters Timothy Baghurst , Jerry J Josey Jr. , @JT R Ball , and Tj Baumbaugh\n\nNext up?\n\nPer our handy master racquetball calendar …\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/…/1V6OTid6rZ356voXVkoV2sN7KMMb…/\n\nNothing domestically, but a couple of countries are having National selection events to pick their teams to go to PARC. We’ll try to decipher Facebook postings to figure out who has won.\n\ntags\n\n@LPRT"
