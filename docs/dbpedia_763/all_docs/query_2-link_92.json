They also added Zach Eflin to their rotation.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNothing new.\n\nBoston Red Sox:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nNothing new since last week with the roster.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNo update.\n\nChicago White Sox:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nMiguel Vargas looks to be a regular starter in the lineup and is hitting second with rookie Brooks Baldwin hitting sixth.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nDavis Martin replaced Fedde, but I expect Iriarte to be the guy by the end of the year.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nIgnore.\n\nCleveland Guardians:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nI like the aggressiveness of the Guardians to add Lane Thomas, who is now hitting second between Kwan and J Ram.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nJoey Cantillo joined the rotation and Tanner Bibee might be hurt.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNo update.\n\nDetroit Tigers:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nDillon Dingler was called up after a huge week and is now starting at catcher for the Tigers.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nWe are still waiting to find out who replaced Jack Flaherty in the rotation, post-trade.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNothing new.\n\nHouston Astros:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nInteresting for the Astros to move on from Loperfido.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nYusei Kikuchi is in the Astros rotation!\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNo update.\n\nKansas City Royals:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nNothing new here.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nN/A.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nIt’s possible Lucas Erceg finally becomes a closer now.\n\nLos Angeles Angels:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nPretty bad deadline here for the Angels to not move some of these guys, but they did cash on Estevez.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nReid Detmers should be back soon.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nLooks like Hunter Strickland will close, rather than Ben Joyce.\n\nMinnesota Twins:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nNothing new.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nDavid Festa is in the rotation now.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNothing new.\n\nNew York Yankees:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nAustin Wells is hitting cleanup, while Jazz Chisholm Jr. is hitting sixth and playing third.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nN/A.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNo update.\n\nOakland Athletics:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nNothing new.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nTyler Ferguson is the closer with Erceg traded and Mason Miller out.\n\nSeattle Mariners:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nArozarena is hitting second with Justin Turner at DH and hitting fourth.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nN/A.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nAndres Munoz is re-locked in as closer.\n\nTampa Bay Rays:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nWaiting on Junior Caminero still.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nJeffrey Springs is back!\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNothing new.\n\nTexas Rangers:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nN/A.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nWho is the fifth starter going to be?\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNothing new.\n\nToronto Blue Jays:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nJoey Loperfido is already hitting second with Spencer Horwitz hitting fourth right now.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nYariel Rodrigeuz and Bowden Francis are both in the rotation with Kikuchi gone.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNothing new.\n\nArizona Diamondbacks:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nThe D Backs picked up Josh Bell to play 1B with Christian Walker out and he is hitting clean up.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nPen Notes:\n\nAJ Puk is basically the lefty setup guy in the pen.\n\nAtlanta Braves:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nOrlando Arcia is hot right now and hitting fifth in the Braves lineup. Don’t be afraid to start pitchers against the Braves right now.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nReliever Grant Holmes was moved into the rotation and has been pretty good so far with a 22.4 K-BB% on the season (starter and reliever) with a 2.93 SIERA.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNo update.\n\nChicago Cubs:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nThe Cubbies flipped Christopher Morel into Isaac Paredes who is hitting fifth for the Cubs.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNothing new.\n\nCincinnati Reds:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nJonathan India is leading off, even with TJ Friedl back.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nNothing new.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNothing new.\n\nColorado Rockies:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nDon’t look now, but the Rockies could actually trade away a starter. Cal Quantrill is still at best an innings eater though.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nGavin Lux is hitting third… why?\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nJack Flaherty took the number “0” with the Dodgers… weird.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the Dodgers go back to six starters or if they stick at five when Yamamoto and Buehler return.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nBullpen by committee, for now.\n\nMiami Marlins:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nThe Marlins completely transformed their team, though a good portion of the players they added are in the minors still.\n\nKyle Stowers is the first in line, hitting fifth.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nNew starter Vallente Bellozo only throws 90, I would stay away.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nWill Andrew Nardi be the closer or Anthony Bender?\n\nMilwaukee Brewers:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nPen Notes:\n\nDevin Williams is back and closing!\n\nNew York Mets:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nNew acquisition Jesse Winker is hitting fifth and playing in LF.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nPaul Blackburn is eating innings. Not sure what this team would do in the playoffs without Senga, the rotation is pretty terrible.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nBrandon Marsh is starting in CF with Austin Hays in LF and hitting ninth.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nPen Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nPittsburgh Pirates:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nOneil Cruz and Bryan De La Cruz… this team is turning into a Booze Cruz. (That’s for you Jake).\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nPen Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nSan Diego Padres:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nPen Notes:\n\nLooks like Robert Suarez is going to stick at closer over Tanner Scott.\n\nSan Francisco Giants:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nTyler Fitzgerald is going off and Marco Luciano was called back up.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nHayden Birdsong is returning to the rotation next week.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNothing new.\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nTommy Pham has been starting every day since the Cardinals brought him in and Nolan Gorman has barely played all week against a bunch of lefty starters.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nLance Lynn hitting the IL is keeping Andre Pallante in for now.\n\nPen Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nWashington Nationals:\n\nLineup Notes:\n\nJuan Yepez is hitting second now and Harold Ramirez is hitting fourth.\n\nRotation Notes:\n\nN/A\n\nPen Notes:\n\nNo update.\n\nFantasy Baseball Injury Notes\n\nOF Mike Trout (Angels) – Looks like Ken Griffey Jr. all over again with Trout, as he’s out for the season again with another torn meniscus.\n\n2B/3B Jordan Westburg – Westburg was hit in the hand with a pitch and suffered a broken hand. He’s likely out somewhere between 4-8 weeks and is likely out for the rest of the fantasy baseball season.\n\nOF Evan Carter (Rangers) – Carter has not recovered from his back issues and is likely out for the season.\n\n1B Christian Walker (Diamondbacks) – Walker hit the IL with a minor oblique strain and is only expected to miss about three weeks.\n\nTim’s Top 5 Fantasy Baseball Waiver Adds (12 Team Leagues)\n\nNOTE: Under 50% Owned (CBS)\n\nSP David Festa (Twins) 10% – Festa has been on this list for a while now and has a 20% K-BB rate, throwing over 95 MPH with a killer breaking pitch and excellent command so far in the majors to boot. He has a 3.60 SIERA against the 6.98 ERA.\n\nSP Hayden Birdsong (Giants) 49% – Birdsong has been on this list for a few consecutive weeks and it’s paying off now. He has a stellar 28.3% K rate and 30.2 CSW% to go along with a 14.1 SwStr% on the season and a 3.87 SIERA. He’s crushing it and re-joining the rotation on Tuesday.\n\nSP River Ryan (Dodgers) 45% – As I expected, Ryan got the nod to Knack and the other Dodgers back end guys with Kershaw re-joining the rotation. Ryan has a big 96-97 MPH fastball and a minor league record of some ridiculous stuff when healthy. He’s an older prospect and should get some good run here, there’s no reason to hold him back. He rocked a 23.8 K-BB rate in his second start with a 3.44 SIERA.\n\nSP JP Sears (Athletics) 34% – Sears has been on and off this list all season, but he’s on one right now. Over his last five starts, Sears has a 21.8 K-BB% and 3.30 SIERA.\n\n2B Gavin Lux (Dodgers) 26% – Lux is hitting third for the Dodgers right now, which is good enough. Since July 11th, Lux has a .404/.473/.766 slash with 4 bombs.\n\nTim’s Top 10 Fantasy Baseball Redraft Prospects\n\nNot promoted yet\n\n1. 3B Junior Caminero (Rays)\n\n2023 A+/AA: .324/.384/.591 | 56 XBH, 31 HR, 5 SB\n\n2023 MLB: .235/.278/.353| 5.6 BB% / 22.2 K%| 2 XBH, 1 HR, 0 SB\n\n2024 AAA: .265/.327/.492 | 7.5 BB% / 22.1 K%| 19 XBH, 11 HR, 1 SB\n\nAge: 20\n\nETA: Late August\n\nfScores: 97 fContact, 86 fDiscipline, 121 fPower, 78 fSpeed\n\nComp: Ronald Acuna w/o the wheels\n\nPrime Skills: Probably the quickest bat speed in the minors with some big time power potential. He could be one of the best hitters in baseball sooner rather than later. The lack of a higher walk rate and being overly aggressive might ding him a bit in points leagues, but the power will be his carrying tool right out of the gate as he should at worst put up numbers similar to Willy Adames, but with a better batting average.\n\nRanking Explanation: Caminero is back in AAA, but if the Rays want to maintain rookie status they can’t call him up until the last week of August or so.\n\n2. OF Jasson Dominguez (Yankees)\n\n2023 AA/AAA: .265/.377/.425 | 40 XBH, 15 HR, 40 SB\n\n2023 MLB: .258/.303/.677 | 6.1 BB%, 24.2 K% | 5 XBH, 4 HR, 1 SB\n\n2024 AAA: .340/.389/.520 | 5.6 BB%, 16.7 K% | 5 XBH, 2 HR, 3 SB (13 games)\n\nAge: 21\n\nETA: Early August\n\nPre-season fScores: 99 fContact, 103 fDiscipline, 136 fPower, 162 fSpeed\n\nNOTE: The 2024 sample size is not large enough to run new fScores\n\nComp: Switch hitting Mookie Betts-light\n\nPrime Skills: Dominguez has top notch plate skills, while also demonstrating he can be a game changer on the base paths. He smashes pitches high in the zone from both sides of the plate, but needs to work on lifting pitches low in the zone instead of smashing them into the ground. He was doing a good job of this before the injury at the major league level.\n\nRanking Explanation: Dominguez is on the way back and working his way into health again. The Yankees could use his bat in the lineup.\n\n***Jordan Walker would be placed here.\n\n3. 1B Deyvison De Los Santos (Marlins)\n\n2023 AA: .254/.297/.431 | 38 XBH, 20 HR, 4 SB\n\n2024 AA/AAA: .322/.377/.633 | 50 XBH, 30 HR, 0 SB\n\nAge: 20\n\nETA: Late July\n\nfScores: N/A\n\nComp: Cristian Encarnacion-Strand\n\nPrime Skills: Big time power potential with an improved contact rate and decrease in strikeouts.\n\nRanking Explanation: De Los Santos was traded to the Marlins and could possibly debut as soon as he move into the new organization.\n\n4. SP Jakob Misiorowski (Brewers)\n\n2023 A/A+/AA: 71 1/3 IP | 110 Ks, 42 BBs | 3.41 ERA, 1.18 WHIP\n\n2024 AA: 79 2/3 IP | 15.9 K-BB%, 13.9 SwStr%, 32.2 CSW% | 3.86 ERA, 1.28 WHIP\n\nAge: 23\n\nComp: Tyler Glasnow\n\nETA: Early September\n\nfScores: 114 fStuff, 86 fControl, 118 fERA\n\nPrime Skills: Killer fastball, he throws it 101 and it’s at an odd arm angle, so it’s difficult to pick up. He’s had some control issues, especially in his short stint at AA, but if he can harness the control he could be an elite starter – otherwise he will be a back of the bullpen beast.\n\nRanking Explanation: The control is getting reigned in and Misiorowski could end up being the second starter for the Brewers if they can’t afford another pitching upgrade by the deadline.\n\n5. 2B / 3B Jace Jung (Tigers)\n\n2023 A+/AA: .253/.372/.502 | 57 XBH, 28 HR, 5 SB\n\n2024 AAA: .266/.387/.470 | 15.8 BB%, 23.3 K% | 35 XBH, 14 HR, 1 SB\n\nAge: 22\n\nETA: Early August\n\nfScores: N/A\n\nComp: Nolan Gorman meets Josh Jung\n\nPrime Skills: The pull power is legit. His swing reminds me a ton of Nolan Gorman and his approach is very similar to his brother Josh. All things look good for success, except that he will have to hit in Detroit.\n\nRanking Explanation: Jung has been out since 6/19 with right wrist soreness, but is already expected to come back in the next few days or so.\n\nHonorable Mention: SP Caden Dana (Angels), SP Jairo Iriarte (White Sox), OF Colby Thomas (Athletics), OF Dylan Crews (Nationals), SP Cade Horton (Cubs), SP Zebby Matthews (Twins), OF Chase DeLauter (Guardians), SS Colson Montgomery (White Sox), OF Drew Gilbert (Mets), SP Ty Madden (Tigers), 3B Matt Shaw (Cubs), 2B Thomas Saggesse (Cardinals), SP Tink Hence (Cardinals), SS Carson Williams (Rays), 2B/OF Luisangel Acuna (Mets), SP Quinn Mathews, SP Mick Abel (Phillies), SP Will Warren (Yankees), OF Owen Caissie (Cubs), OF Caleb Durbin (Yankees), SP Gunnar Hoglund (Athletics), SP Mason Adams (White Sox), SP Logan Henderson (Brewers)\n\nFantasy Baseball Moves I Made This Week\n\nCBS Memorial Magazine League (12 Team 5×5 Roto):\n\nN/A\n\nCBS NL Only Analyst League (12 Team 5×5 Roto):\n\nAdded SP Jack Flaherty for $100\n\nTGFBI (15 Team 5×5 Roto):\n\nAdded Hayden Birdsong for $4, dropping Lance Lynn\n\nFantasy Aceball Invitational (16 Team Ottoneu H2H Points):\n\nN/A\n\nOttoneu Podcaster’s League (12 Team Ottoneu 5×5 Roto):\n\nN/A\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google Podcasts | SoundCloud | iHeartRadio\n\nPlease find more of our work by listening to the Fantasy Aceball podcast on Apple Pods and Spotify and follow me on X @fantasyaceball."
