He’s 15 days older than Robby Snelling, the Double-A Texas League’s youngest player.\n\nInternational League\n\nPacific Coast League\n\nDouble-A\n\nThere are some themes surfacing. The Orioles have the youngest player in the International League (Holliday) and Eastern League (Samuel Basallo). The Angels’ Nelson Rada is more than a year and half younger than anyone else in the Southern League, and he won’t be the last Angels player we focus on as youngest in a league.\n\nEastern League\n\nSouthern League\n\nTexas League\n\nHigh-A\n\nEthan Salas is the youngest player in any full season league, which was also the case for much of last year. He’s the only 17-year-old who made an active Opening Day roster.\n\nMidwest League\n\nNorthwest League\n\nSouth Atlantic League\n\nLow-A\n\nThe youngest players in the Low-A leagues are international signees who skipped the Arizona and Florida Complex leagues to jump straight from the Dominican Summer League to full season ball, which is the case for Juan Flores, Yophery Rodriguez and Alfredo Duno.\n\nCalifornia League\n\nCarolina League\n\nFlorida State League"
