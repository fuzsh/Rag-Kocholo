Large-scale migration increased the U.S.' Mexican population during the 1910s, as refugees fled the economic devastation and violence of Mexico's high-casualty revolution and civil war. Until the mid-20th century, most Mexican Americans lived within a few hundred miles of the border, although some resettled along rail lines from the Southwest into the Midwest.",

In the article Artificial Intelligence and Predicting Illegal Immigration to the USA the statistic that \"more than half of undocumented immigrants in the USA enter the USA legally and overstay their visas\" (Yektansani). This happened all throughout the timeline."
