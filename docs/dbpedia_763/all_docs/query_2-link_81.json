        "text": "The project aims to develop a software application using Python and various libraries for image processing and manipulation. The software used consists of Windows 10 Pro Education, Python 3.8.2, OpenCV 4.5.3, NumPy 1.22, Imutils 0.5.4, Pillow 9.4.0, Tkinter, and Visual Studio Code 1.75.1. The methodology is divided into four sprints. In the first sprint, the necessary dependencies, including OpenCV, NumPy, Imutils, Pillow, and Tkinter, were installed. The second sprint involved developing a command-line interface and integrating a live webcam video feature. In the third sprint, color detection was implemented by converting the image to black and white and applying filters to identify specific colors. Finally, the fourth sprint focused on developing the selection of geometric figures and colors. When a figure and color were selected, the software would identify and outline the corresponding object. This project utilized Python and various libraries to create an application for image processing and manipulation. The methodology followed a sprint-based approach to gradually develop different features and functionalities of the software."
