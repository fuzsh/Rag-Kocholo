        "text": "Tradition, pure and blended cultures, our ancestors, ourselves and for the generations who will follow us and look to us as their roots.\n\nThose of us who live in the United States of America should appreciate that America is called \"the melting pot\" of cultures. East to West, North to South, and in between all have a cultural diversity of unsurpassed in the entire world.\n\nMy wife and I just finished watching \"Roots\" for the umpteenth time, and this reminded me of my own family and its diverse cultural blend.\n\nMy family in the \"New World\" started in Mexico, New England, and Alta California at about the same time.\n\nThe earliest record of my family in the \"New world\" as of this writing; are 1514 in Mexico when Louis Carrillo and Nunez Balboa expedition discovered the Pacific Ocean and the Smiths as early as 1685 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (undocumented).\n\nFrom a European beginning, across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and settling in areas thousands of miles from one another before coming together in Alta California many generations later. Such diversity in cultures and status, it is amazing to me the stories of how they came to be my family!\n\nIn the East, those of my family that came to the \"New World\" for religious and economic reasons and of my family who came to Mexico and Alta California for economic reasons, this is the story of how they fared.\n\nIn the East, you read the names of cities, towns and they are mostly Anglo, whereas in the South West the names of the cities towns are mostly Spanish. In California, where I hail from, you can truly see the blend of cultures. I grew up in an unincorporated area called \"Castro Valley\", and have lived in cities called \"San Leandro\" and \"Fremont\". What I mean is that within the area called the \"Bay Area\" you find equal numbers of Anglo and Spanish names of cities and towns depending on what area was colonized and named for the, or after the locals.\n\nI also find it interesting that the present day President of Mexico is named Fox. Truly not a Spanish surname, but in all else he truly is a Mexican. Somewhere in his family, a European named Fox married a Spanish, Mexican, or native Indian woman and thus the name of Fox has been handed down through the generations. In my own family, a man named Miller married a Spanish, Mexican, or native Indian woman and at least one in the line married a man named Smith. There are Smiths and Millers living in Mexico at this writing who are truly Mexican, but bear the surname of a European other than one from Spain.\n\nThe Smith, Gilpin, and Hartnell families came from England, and the Carrillo, de la Guerra, de Lugo, Castro, Alvarez, Arellanes, Boronda, Esapinosa, Escamilla, de la Torre, Moreno, Ramirez, Soberanes, and Munoz families came from Spain. The Mayer, Wagoner and Miller families came from Germany, the Bonelli and Cappelli families came from Italy and finally the Christensen family came from Denmark.\n\nBeginning on the East coast with the Smith family, they were merchants in Pennsylvania. They later owned business in Mexico City, Mexico, and then became ranchers in Alta California. The Gilpin families were Quaker farmers in Pennsylvania, and the Gilpin family roots go back to 1206 England where an early ancestor won a title and estate by slaying a killer Boar. Lafayette used the farmhouse of Joseph Gilpin as a command post during the \"Battle of Brandywine\" during the American Revolution. Samuel Smith Married Lydia Gilpin and they have eight children. Joseph met Loretta Miller in Mexico while on business Joseph Smith later married Loretta. He later started a business in Mexico City with the husband of his sister Hannah, John Stokes. The couple had eight children, all born in Mexico. The family traveled between Mexico City and Philadelphia many times during their marriage. Three of the boys, Miguel, George, and Alban, were educated in Philadelphia in a private school. On the last trip to Mexico in 1848, Joseph died, leaving Loretta and the children without income. I have copies of letters written by George Smith for his mother, as she read wrote and spoke only in Spanish. I believe Loretta and the girls moved back with her family, but I do not know where in Mexico they settled. I have a photo of family, taken in Mexico. In 1849, the three remaining brothers, Miguel, George, and Alban came to Alta California, leaving their Mother and two remaining sisters, Anna and Guadalupe (Lupita) in Mexico.\n\nAnd in the west, Juan Carillo born 1695 in Baja California and a descendent of Louis Carrillo, marries Lucia Efigina Miller born 1705 in Baja California. They have a son in 1715, Hilario. Hilario marries Maria Antonia De PASOS, born in Baja California 1725. They have a son Jose Raimondo CARRILLO-PASOS born in 1749 also in Baja. Jose Raimondo marries Maria Thomasa de LUGO, in 1781, at the San Carlos Mission in Monterey Alta California.\n\nThe earliest Alta California ancestors are Jose Raimondo CARRILLO-PASOS and Maria Thomasa de LUGO CARRILLO. They have seven children, my direct ancestor, Maria Antonia CARRILLO, was born 1786 in San Gabriel, California.\n\nJose Antonio DE LA GUERRA was born 1779 in Novales, Santander, Spain. A soldier and early settler of California, Jose Antonio was one of the few personages in early California who was of the \"Sangre Azul\" (blue blood) of old Spain. At age 13 he came to Mexico City to live with his maternal uncle Pablo Gonzalez de Noriega, a wealthy merchant. Jose joined the frontier army in 1793; in 1798 he was appointed a cadet at the Presidio of San Diego. He was promoted to alferez (ensign) at the Presidio at Monterey in 1800 and by 1804 was its acting Commandant. In 1806 he was made lieutenant at the Presidio in Santa Barbara and served so until 1817 when he became captain. He became commandant in 1827 and also became a Deputy (Diputado) to the Mexican National Congress. He served as Commandant until 1842, when he retired. He was popular and was known as \"El Capitain\" From Spanish Land Grants and purchases, he became owner of over ½ million acres in what is now Santa Barbara, Ventura, Marin, and Sacramento counties. In 1804 Jose marries Maria Antonia Carrillo. They lived in Santa Barbara along with the de Lugo and Carrillo families. Their adobes still remain within a mile of one another. Jose and Maria become influential in the community, many a fiesta was held at their hacienda, and it is said they personally helped many who were in need. They had eleven children all total. One of the daughters, Maria Teresa Isidora De La Guerra is a direct descendant of mine.\n\nWilliam Edward Petty HARTNELL born in Backbarrow, Lancashire, England, in 1798. An orphan, he was raised by his maternal uncle who sent him away to school. He was educated in Germany, learning Spanish, German, and French in addition to his business and bookkeeping studies. In 1819, William went to Santiago, Chile and signed on as a bookkeeper for a large mercantile firm and it is there where he met Hugh McCulloch. The two young men came to Monterey, Alta California in 1822, where they set up trade with the established Missions. It is during his visits to Santa Barbara he met Jose Antonio DE LA GUERRA and later Maria Teresa Isidora De La Guerra, Joses daughter. William made friends easily and before long was courting Maria Teresa Isidora De La Guerra. She was a devote Roman Catholic and William was not, after counseling with Friar Antonio Ripoli, a Franciscan monk William had befriended, William converts to the Roman Catholic faith. Maria Teresa Isidora De La Guerra and William Edward Petty HARTNELL marry in 1825 and have twelve children. William became a Mexican citizen and was awarded land grants in Salinas, Solano county, and Santa Barbara county. After his business fails, William starts the first college in Alta California on his ranch outside of Salinas. HARTNELL was called upon many times, by the Mexican Governor of California, to act as interpreter. He became \"ex officio interpreter\" for the new state of California.\n\nGuillermo Antonio Hartnell, first born of William and Maria. Guillermo marries Maria Del Refugio MORENO in 1850 and they have eleven children. For a time, he was sheriff of what is now Castroville. The family owned property near Santa Inez and Guillermo was listed as a rancher in the census of 1870. A cousin, Juan Hartnell, was also a rancher at that time and area. One of Guillermo and Marias daughters is a direct descendant, Maria De La Concepcion Blanca HARTNELL born in 1853.\n\nGeorge Smith, and younger brother, Alban are listed in the 1860 census of Township Santa Inez as sheepherders. Working on a ranch owned by Jose Espanans, whose ranch is near the ranch of Guillermo Antonio Hartnell. It is there that the brothers first meet the Hartnell family. In 1870, George Smith, and brother Alban are married in a double ceremony at the Mission in San Luis Obispo. George marries Maria De La Concepcion Blanca HARTNELL, and Alban marries her sister, Maria Ada HARTNELL. In the census of 1870, George and Maria are listed as sheepherders, with Alban and his wife Maria are listed under the household of George. One of George and Marias daughters, Blanca Rose Smith, is a direct descendant of mine. I have a letter from George to daughter Blanca dated 1895; she was sixteen and charged with looking after her older brother George McKinley. My grandmother told us stories about her \"mothers family\" owning or managing a Hotel in Saratoga, California. One of the aunts lived on what is now highway 9, near the entrance to Big Basin State Park. It is there on a trip to visit family that Blanca met and later married Carl.\n\nOliver Peter CHRISTENSEN and Meta Margaret (maiden name unknown), come to America from Denmark in about 1879. With them they bring their sons, Carl and John. Landing in New York, they moved to Baltimore Maryland. After a couple of years they went westward as did many others of the time, settling in Park City Utah, and then Herber Utah, where they had family. Oliver was a cobbler and seeking a better life, the family moved to Saratoga California where Oliver set up a shop on the main street of Saratoga, on the creek side of Big Basin way. Sometime between 1896 and 1897, Carl meets Blanca Smith while she was visiting family in Saratoga.\n\nCarl CHRISTENSEN and Blanca Rose Smith marry in 1898. They live in Saratoga where Carl is employed as caretaker of the \"Tyson ranch\" in the foothills near the Congress Springs road. Carl and Blanca buy a house on the \"creek side\" of Big Basin Way in Saratoga and have four children, Loretta Rose, Fred George, Joseph Carl, and Lucrecia (Kay). In 1905, Blanca becomes gravely ill, her older sister Rose, now living in San Jose, comes to take care of Blanca and the children. Blanca soon dies and the children are shuttled to family members and friends. At the death of his wife at an early age and having to separate the family, Carl becomes embittered.\n\nLoretta, now called Laura, is sent for a time to live with her Grandmother, Maria De La Concepcion Blanca HARTNELL Smith, in San Jose, California. When her fathers mother becomes ill, Loretta is sent to live with her Grandmother Meta, until Meta dies in 1915. The family soon moves to Octavia Street in Oakland California, where Carl has purchased a house. At his point Carl is able to bring all of the children with him. Loretta is charged with keeping the house, cooking, cleaning, and washing. She enters Heald College and after graduating soon finds employment with one of the Tyson brothers who owns an insurance agency in San Francisco.\n\nHenry C. Mayer born in San Antonio, Texas meets and marries Irma Wagner, born in Germany. They have a son Raymond I. Mayer, born 1898 in Del Rio, Texas.\n\nIn 1921, Laura Rose CHRISTENSEN met Raymond I. Mayer and they were married and left for the Philippines, where Raymond and His father Henry had contracted a job to install refrigeration. They were together only three months when Laura leaves Raymond and returns to California working her way home on a ship. During the trip home, Laura discovers that she is pregnant. Laura returns to the home of her father in Oakland.\n\nFred George Mayer is born May 16, 1922. He lives with his mother and grandfather in the home on Octavia Street in Oakland. With no contact whatsoever with his father, Fred comes to identify with his grandfathers family. While working at Caterpillar tractor Company in San Leandro California, Fred meets and eventually marries Priscilla (Primasia) Bonelli.\n\nGustavo Bonelli arrives in America from Ponti e Saccio, Italy in 1913, aboard the ship Berlin. Rosa Capelli arrives in America from Pistoia, Italy in 1920, aboard the ship America. They meet in Ohio and marry in Canton in 1920. Their first child is Primasia Margaret Bonelli. When Premasia was six she started school, she did not speak any English. Her first grade teacher changed her name from Primasia to Priscilla, and she has gone by that name ever since.\n\nKenneth D. Mayer is born in 1950 and my brother David is born six years later.\n\nWith the death of her mother Blanca, at the early age of six, and after Laura left the company of her maternal Grandmother, she soon lost physical contact with her Mothers family. Reading through correspondence she had with several cousins, some of the letter was written in Spanish. I never knew my grandmother even knew Spanish, let alone read and write! What an epiphany to find this out! As a young boy, and in the tradition of an oral book, I remember my grandmother telling me with pride stories of her GGGrandfather, William E.P. Hartnell, the early Californianos and our Spanish nobility heritage. Well into her nineties, my Grandmother identified old photos of her people. We had relatives in Maryland, New York, Utah, Mexico, in addition to the ones in California.\n\nWith interest in history and my family heritage I have researched my roots. I have met with or corresponded with cousins who I never knew existed, who were also driven with a desire to find the family roots. We are both the culture(s) of our parents and the culture of which we choose to identify. The blend of cultures is alive with me and the other family members who choose to keep them alive.\n\nIn a message dated 7/10/2006 darellano@austin.rr.com writes:\n\n\"Sangre Pura,\" by Dan Arellano\n\nDear Mimi,\n\nSince so many people go to your web-site I can no longer restrain myself from writing in response to the letter written by Historian Alex Loya. Although I respect and admire his continuing research on the origins of the Tejano community, I believe he should have taken his research just a little bit further. I, like him, am proud of my Spanish ancestry, but I am also proud of my indigenous ancestry and I disagree with him that the majority of the early settlers were of \"pure Spanish blood.\"\n\nMr. Loya you make several references of \"sangre pura,\" as if to be ashamed of having ingenious blood flowing through your veins. You may well be of pure Spanish blood sir, but the majority of us are not. Carey McWilliams, in his book, \"North From Mexico,\" describes this as a \"fantasy heritage.\" McWilliams describes this further, \"the native-born Spanish-speaking elements resent any attempt to designate them in a manner that implies a \"non-white\" racial origin. Being called \"Mexican\" is resented, not on the basis of nationality, but on the assumption of racial difference.\"\n\nAs Dr. Arthur L Campa has pointed out, because of the Anglo-Americans attitude towards race, the first reaction of the New Mexican , \"is to disassociate himself from anything that carries a Mexican implication.\" To do this, he must insist on his difference in origin. Thus he is of \"pure Spanish blood,\" a direct descendent, \"of the Spanish conquerors.\" Carried to its logical conclusion, this line of reasoning results in the deductions (a) that the New Mexican is not a \"Mexican,\" ; and (b) that he has no Indian blood. \"Being American citizens the next step is to combine the concept of race with that of nationality and the hyphenated Spanish-American is the result. Such a term serves a triple purpose: it lifts from the New Mexican the opprobrium of being a Mexican: it makes him a member of the\"white\" race, and expresses his American citizenship.\" But the difficulty with \"Spanish-American,\" as Dr. Campa adds, is that, while it suits the New Mexican in the abstract, there is little in his appearance and origin that upholds the distinction he is trying so hard to make. To the Anglo-Americans of the borderlands, with their racial pre-occupations, it is second nature to refer to the Spanish-speaking group as \"Mexican\"; whereas the \"Californios, the Tejanos, and the New Mexicans insist that they are \"Spanish\" or Spanish-American.\" The trouble with all the terminology, as Dr Campa puts it, \"is based on logic and excludes the human factor. The whole thing is characterized by anomalies which attempt to justify prejudices and defense mechanisms. Certainly the attitude of the Californios, the Tejanos and the New Mexicans has been a factor in the cultivation of an absurd dichotomy between things Spanish and things Mexican.\"\n\nCarol Hendrickson, in her dissertation, \"Everybody's Indian When The Occasion is Right,\" argues that criteria such as wealth, size of landholdings, or the number of votes is a primary factor in fundamental classifiers when she describes the social phenomena of ethnicity. Other systems of labeling exist, of course, but many of the more social-politically oriented are taken to be sub-summed by basic ethnic distinctions. The term \"Indio,\" which translated into English as Indian, has derogatory connotations and is not a common word for self-definition.\n\nThe majority of the early settlers were not of \"sangre pura\" as Alex Loya describes. They are a mixture of the Native Americans, Los Indios Tlaxcallans from northern Mexico and the mixed blood mestizos of Spanish and Mexican Indian blood.\n\nAs Dr Arthur L. Campa accurately asserts about the descendents of the mission Indians \"the inhabitants of all of the missions have been so completely assimilated that they resent any reference of their Indian identity.\" As Juan Gomez-Quinones, a Chicano historian noted, \"The history of the Southwest is beclouded by assumptions of Spanish this and Spanish that, and is devoid of human content. The literature has information based on legal documents concerning administrative practice, architecture, laws and economic trade, but there is little as to the people, their values and relations as they developed over time. Settlement was carried on, in the majority, by indio-mestizo-mulatto settlers. Nonetheless, upon reviewing the literature, an individual of Mexican descent can speculate, understandably, about the probability of a Machiavellian conspiracy to deny the historical presence of ancestral kin.\"\n\nWriting about the early communities in Texas, Edgar L. Hewett points out, \" the disappearance of some of the pueblos is simply the result of a complete assimilation of such Indian villages as Tome, Nambe, Cuyimange, Socorro and Ysleta in Texas.\" Gerald E. Poyo in his book \"Tejano Origins,\" says that in the early years life in San Antonio the desire of Fray Antonio de Olivares of San Antonio de Valero Mission had been that \"pure blooded\" Spanish families were to settle the area and virtually all of Alarcon's recruits were \"mulattos, lobos, coyotes and mestizos.\" There, according to the priest, \"were people of the lowest order, whose customs are worse than those of the Indians.\" Unless you were of Spanish descent the friars would not identify race when registering the baptisms, marriages, and deaths, concealing racial \"shortcomings.\" For instance, only one interracial marriage is registered in San Antonio during this time between a Spanish settler and the commanders Indian servant. And in another case, even when the groom is identified as the son of a Spaniard and an Indian he is listed in the marriage register as Spanish and not mestizo. Thus, these descendents of racially mixed individuals were allowed to progress to the preferred social status in the larger colonial society. In spite of their dark skin, many people on the frontier passed themselves off as \"Spanish.\" Because the distribution of San Antonio's resources during the early years were in the hands of the elite Canary Islanders, it was difficult for non-Spaniards to acquire wealth and social status. However, in the later years, it became easier and advantageous to inter-marry into the ruling families in order to obtain status. Along with the attainment of such status came changes in ethnic designations, as is evident in the frequent transition of mulattos or mestizos to \"Spanish.\"\n\nCarlos Castanada in \"Our Catholic Heritage Volume II\" says that \"the ethnically mixed were the rule rather than the exception.\" Castaneda further states in \"Our Catholic Heritage,\" that during the colonial era \"that the Catholic Church and the missionary's role was to reduce and culturally obliterate the Indian. Their objective was to create a \"Christian,\" and that meant to spiritually and culturally stamp out the Indian.\" In a way they succeeded. As we have inevitably become anglicized by living in the United States and educated in American schools, our Indian remnants have disappeared. We may be culturally extinct, losing our names, our heritage, but we are still here. Like the Maya of Yucatan, their civilization peaked hundreds of years ago, but they still exist, and so do we.\n\nDonald E. Chipman in his book,\"Spanish Texas, 1519-1821says that,\" the ethnic structure of Texas during 1777-1793 reflected that the largest percentage of the population, approximately 50 percent was classified as \"Spaniard,\" followed by settled Indians. By the 1790's roughly two-thirds of the adult population was married. Single men outnumbered single women, with disparity most noticeable in towns containing military garrisons. Most immigrants married women from the local community. At the close of the eighteenth century the population of Texas in general, reflected ethnic mobility. The marriage of white men to women of mixed origin started the process of amalgamation, and children of these unions often passed as white.\" Chipman also writes : \"That despite the rich human tapestry that was pre-Spanish Texas, the Indians were ultimately doomed. They succumbed because of lost ancestral lands, fatal diseases, limited numbers, destruction of the buffalo and superior European technology. The record is inexorable, for not one original native culture remains in the state of Texas. Apart from the ethnic roots of Tejanos, one must search hard to find other significant Indian legacies in the Lone Star State.\n\nAs Elizabeth A.H. Johns, in her book,\"Storms Brewed in Other Mens Worlds,\" has demonstrated, \"by painful trial and error Indian and Spanish communities evolved toward peaceful coexistence.\"\n\nIn 1821, the greater part of some three thousand nonindigenous settlers in Spanish Texas were mestizo, of mixed ethnicity. Jack Jackson, \"Los Mestenos,\" has shown that caste distinctions continued in the Mexican population with the use of such terms as espanol, indio, negro, mestizo, mulatto, coyote, lobo, and zambo. He also noted that many Anglo-Americans were apt to ignore these finer distinctions and lump all Spanish speakers into one \"despicable\" race.\n\nIn 1591 four hundred Tlaxcalla families came north with Spanish Captain General Francisco de Urdinola to settle San Estaban alongside the Spanish town of Saltillo. Which later would become, as the Historian, Herbert E. Bolton has described as ,\"the mother colony from which numerous offshoots were planted at the new missions and villages further north,..that is in Texas.\" David Bergen Adams, B.A. in his dissertation \"The Tlaxcallan Colonies of Spanish Coahuila and Nuevo Leon; An aspect of the settlement of Northern Mexico,\" The University of Texas, Dec. 1970, writes: The main attributes of the Tlaxcallans in this process were stated in a 1698 petition which was that they , \"would be a buffer against enemies and would always have arms and horses in order to resist...{and} because the natural Indians get along well with the Tlaxcaltecos and help them in everything.\" The Tlaxcallans were to establish dozens of towns in northern Mexico, too numerous to mention them here.\n\nIn his book, \"Tejanos and Texas,\" Andres Tijerina,PHD, states: \"The major pattern of Tejano settlement was not the planned spread and strategic military settlements that the Mexican Government tried so diligently to achieve. Instead the population of Texas, particularly in the Bejar-Goliad region, increased only as the established presidio soldiers or presediales steadily integrated or amalgamated into the neighboring communities through intermarriage or retirement. The presidial amalgamation increased the population and promoted a racial mixing as well. Most of the Mexican soldiers and settlers who inhabited the communities and presidios of Texas had come from the stages in Northern Mexico where racial mixing had been prevalent. They were mestizos, a racial mixture of Spanish and native Mexican Indian. The Mexican natives in Northern Mexico were largely of the Tlaxcalan tribe from the former Aztec Empire. Thus, the original Tejano community was most likely a blend of intermarrying between Tlaxcallan soldiers and Spanish mestizo settlers. Presidiales married into civilian communities; Tlaxcallans married into Spanish families.\"\n\nIn his diary, \"Texas by Teran,\" General Manuel de Mier y Teran says, \" It is a shame that we cannot do what the Spanish did before. From San Luis Potosi to Bejar I have not visited a single town of any size that had not been a Tlaxcallan Indian settlement, established at a cost to the {royal} treasury and run by {missionary} fathers. {This is} a little known fact, as is in all of our history.\" He also mentions that the Spanish government, when it had made a determined effort to populate these lands, (Texas), that they had sent Indians from Tlaxcalla under the charge of the missionary priests. They had also placed exorbitant funds in the missionaries hands so that they might pursue unchecked, their chief desire to construct buildings.\n\nThe eminent historian, Charles Gibson in his book, \"Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century,\" says that although there were other Indian Nations that allied with Cortez and the Conquistadores that the Tlaxcallan were the only ones to \"participate with fair consistency and in large numbers.\" He continues by saying, \" the military alliance with the Spaniards and the colonization venture in the north was a form of escape and an attempt to begin anew. They were used as general settlers during the later northern expansion and seem to have been members or descendents of the 1591 group.\" (Saltillo, San Estaban)\n\nMimi, I could go on and on and I felt I had to speak for the indigenous population, which has remained silent and in the background for much to long. All of this information and more is in my book, 'Tejano Roots.\" The first part is of the \"Battle of Medina,\" of which Mr. Loya makes reference to and again is wrong with his assessment.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDan Arellano\n\nAuthor/Historian\n\nwww.tejanoroots.org for more information\n\nPo Box 43012\n\nAustin, Tx 78704\n\n512-826-7569\n\nIn a message dated 7/13/2006 Mimi writes to darellano@austin.rr.com and alexloya@integrity.com\n\nSubject: Re: Tejano Origins\n\nDear Dan:\n\nThank you for your very thoughtful letter and supportive data. I know that my roots include indigenous lines because I have the wedding document that refers to my gggrandmother as a mestiza. I also know that my Pena lines (two) are Tlaxcallan tribal connections. Like you, I am proud of both my Spanish and indigenous lines.\n\nAlex Loya has indeed done extensive research and found evidence of a Hispanic presence in the Southwest much earlier than even suspected. His work is very much to be admired.\n\nWith the results of my own family research, I personally do not agree with the \"pure blood\" emphasis that Alex points to . . I do feel however that it is good to present the research of historians with differing opinions on that point. It enriches the base of information that is shared. . . especially when well-researched data is the foundation of the positions taken.\n\nI have not decided the best place for your letter yet; Texas, Southwest, Indigenous, and even Anti-Spanish would be suitable.\n\nThank you for expressing your opinion.\n\nGod bless, Mimi\n\nRe: Tejano Origins\n\nIn a message dated 7/15/2006 from alexloya@integrity.com to Mimi and darellano@austin.rr.com\n\nSorry for taking so long to answer, I have been out of town and so busy I have not had a chance to check my email in a few days.\n\nWhen I first began to research this issue I contacted Professor Robert McCaa of the University of Minnesota because the people of Northern New Spain, of Chihuahua and Texas etc. are, generally speaking, palpably whiter than the people of central and southern Mexico. I wondered if there had been a migration from the East, from Louisiana, to Northern New Spain rather than from the south. Professor McCaa stated that most of the migration was from south to north, but, that his research had shown that whites did not intermarry very much in Northern New Spain. Then I found how that mestizos had been excluded from colonization. Well, that explained the mystery of the distinct appearance of the original colonials of Northern New Spain and those of the middle and south of Mexico as is plainly visible today.\n\nI understand your position, although I must say your disagreement is not with me but with Antonio Menchaca and such men who over and over and over and over and over and over and over stated and stated and stated and stated that they were Spaniards, that in their veins flowed the warm blood of Castile, when I write about this issue, I am simply echoing what they said which has been totally ignored until now, and now that I point it out, it is fiercely resisted by some who just as soon eliminate the Spaniard race from any existence in the making of America. Only in San Antonio was there a majority, not of mestizos, but of mulattos, go and count the persons in the census again, and\n\nnote that just as you say some went from being mestizo to being Spaniard, so were there those who are ignored who went from being Spaniard to being mulatto etc., showing the reverse process you refer\n\nto. Why, in one instace although the original population was almost exclusively Spaniard, ten years later that same town became almost exclusively quebrado, showing the total reverse process that you and\n\nother writers claim happened that mestizos later claimed to be Spaniard.\n\nIn all this argument, it is not the mestizos that are being railroaded, it is the criollos who have been forgotten and ignored until now, you are not the victim of injustice in this instance, it is the criollos of Northern New Spain who have been the victims of cultural genocide and even now with one little work that points to the role of the criollo, you are up in arms wanting to make us disappear from history again.\n\nWell, I don't want to fight, sir, like I said, take it up with the Spaniard Founding Fathers of Texas, tell Menchaca he was not a Spaniard, tell Navarro his father was not Corsican and his mother was\n\nnot criollo, tell Seguin he was not French and of full Castilian lineage (he was said to be of full Castilian lineage although French in his Seguin side,by the way, Seguins participated with the French at\n\nYorktown, as did the Loya), I am merely pointing out their testimony (and note that when I call them so, I am just repeating what they or their friends or interviewers wrote of them, I did not make it up), and then go and deny the people of Northern New Spain what they claimed was their heritage, as so many have done in their attempt to erase the Spaniard from existence in the making of America, and then\n\ngo and change their faces in their portraits.\n\nLike I said, I don't want to fight, sir, I will write for the criollos and you go ahead and write for the mestizos, who were a tiny tiny minority since the mixed population was that of the mulattos, not the\n\nmestizos.\n\nI suppose the question is who was the majority and from whom the colonial Tejanos drew their identity... you are just wrong in saying the majority in colonial days and before the Texas Revolution were\n\nmestizos, and you are just wrong in saying they drew their identity from them. The fact is they claimed to be Spaniard, they called themselves Spaniard, and they had the face of the Spaniard. The trouble is, of course, that when an original Tejano like Menchaca says he is Spaniard, you call him a liar, when the census says the vast majority were Spaniards, you say they all changed their race from mestizo to Spaniard based on one or two who changed from mestizo to Spaniards while completely ignoring those who changed from Spaniard to mestizo. Your argument is not against me, your argument is against\n\nNavarro and Seguin and Menchaca, your argument is against all those colonials who said they were Spaniards, and against those like Professor McCaa who have studied this issue extensively and show that what you claim did not take place in NOrthern New Spain.\n\nHeck, in Mexico everybody knows \"Los Nortenos\", the original Chihuahuans and Nuevo Leonians and Coahuilans etc are the majority mysteriously white, and to some who study criollos! In Mexico,\n\neverybody knows the original inhabitants of Northern Mexico are different from the Mexicans of central and southern Mexico in that they are white and gachupines as opposed to the central and southern\n\nMexicans who are indios nada mas! In Mexico, and I know because I lived in Mexico for many years, every one knows that, contrary to what Dr. Tijerina claims, which is absurd (that the colonial people of\n\nNorthern Mexico were Tlaxcalan Indians, that is absurd!) and concurring with what Dr. McCaa found, the colonial people of Northern Mexico are generally white and whiter than the Mexicans to the south, it is\n\ncommon knowledge. In fact, just 3 years ago when I took my family on vacation to Mexico we saw, in southern Mexico just outside of Mexico City, two men taller than the the rest, white with shaved though\n\nvisibly full beards, wearing cowboy hats and boots, I mentioned to my wife that I bet they are from Chihuahua, and, sure enough, the license plate on their pick up truck was from Chihuahua, as was their accent.\n\nBut see how you deny us! One little work speaking for the criollos and it can not be tolerated! We must be eliminated! The cultural genocide which has been perpetrated against us for a century must prevail! For some reason you despise us criollos, including the few mestizos who according to the Spaniards were assimilated into the Spanish race (you know, through the indio + Spaniard= mestizo, mestizo+Spaniard= castizo and castizo+ Spaniard = Spaniard process).\n\nI don't know why you say that the indigenous population and background has remained silent for too long, that is all that is ever claimed! And when one word is said about a criollo heritage, it is ridiculed,\n\ndenied and attacked as even now you are doing.\n\nUltimately, it does not matter, I believe we are all racially related to Adam, although it would be nice if they would let the Spaniards in America exist.\n\nAlex Loya\n\nP.S. I am aware that this response is mostly emotion, for facts you can read my book one day.\n\n7/27/2006 From Dan Arellano to Alex Loya\n\ncc: Don Guillermo and Mimi Lozano\n\nThank you for your gracious apology and I am NOT THAT OLD! Hah, I wish.\n\nAs far as the inter- marrying between the different groups you know as well as I that wherever an army travels, babies will be born. There were many laws passed as the limpeza de sangre, but they were unenforceable. A common saying was obedezco pero no cumplo (I obey but do not execute).\n\nDuring the conquest friendly caciques gave women to the Spaniards and other native females went freely or were taken by force. During the sixteenth century the term mestizo was synonymous with bastard. A high percentage of the mestizos were illegitimate. Unrecognized by their fathers, most stayed with their Indian mothers and so became more culturally Indian than Spaniard. Many of these liaisons were fleeting but others ripened into long comfortable affairs. Some Spaniards had wives in Spain, and by law were required to send for them, but found it convenient to obedezco pero no cumplo. In 1551, according to the bishop of Mexico, there were five hundred married Spaniards whose wives were back in Spain and by one pretext or another avoided bringing them to the New World. In the meantime these men took native concubines and some even remarried, risking trial for bigamy. The crown and church wanted Spaniards married and settled to give the colony stability, and for these reasons they encouraged Spaniards to marry Indian girls. Spanish women rarely married outside their caste unless it was to a prominent mestizo, and then they were never there in large numbers. The encomenderos felt particular pressure, as they were required to marry within three years or lose their grants of Indians. As time passed quite a few Spaniards married their Indian mistresses thus legitimizing their children. By 1540 there were a good number of mestizo girls of marriageable age. They may not have been the preferred pure Spanish types, but many were recognized daughters of prosperous and socially prominent conquistadores. The child of these unions created a castiza and would pass as white, thus by the late sixteenth century there seems to have been enough females considered white to go around. A notable case is the son of Hernan Cortes, Don Martin Cortes son of the captain and Dona Marina. He was certainly a mestixo but because of the standing of his parents, he passed as white. Pedro de Alvarados mestizo daughter also had high social status, marrying a cousin of the duke of Albuquerque. (Meyers and Sherman, The Course of Mexican History, Third Edition)\n\nI am suggesting that perhaps Prof McCaa did not take into consideration that by the 1800s the majority of the Indians, mestizos, mullato, etc., had been given Spanish names and were practicing the Catholic religion thus the confusion of the marriages.\n\nAccording to Michael C. Meyer and William L. Sherman in The Course of Mexican History, and Augustin Cue Cavanos, Historical social y enconomica de Mexico (1521-1854) (Mexico, 1972), p. 134:\n\nIn 1793 The General Population of New Spain is thus: Indians 2,500,000 (52%),Peninsulares 70,000 (1%), Criollos 1,025,000 (21%), Mestizos 1,231,000 (25%various mixes), Blacks 6,000 (0.1%)\n\nFor a total population of 4,832,000\n\nIn 1810 The General Population was: Indians 3,676,281 (60%),Peninsulares 15,000 (0.3%), Criollos 1,092,367 (18%), Mestizos 704,245 (11%), Mulattoes and Zambos(Afromestizos) 624,461 (10%), Blacks 10,000 (0.2%) for a total population of 6,122,354.\n\nThis count almost certainly minimizes the numbers of the castes: doubtless many of the Spaniards were technically castizos and mestizos, and a good share of the Negroes were probably mulattoes and zambos. At independence, in 1821, almost exactly three hundred years after the conquest, the total population of Mexico was around seven million, of many varied racial strains.(Meyers and Sherman)\n\nThus these are the people that would migrate to the north of Mexico and eventually into Texas.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDan Arellano\n\nAuthor/Historian\n\n512-826-7569\n\nwww.tejanoroots.org\n\ndrellano@austin.rr.com\n\nMr. Arellano,\n\nThank you for accepting my apology sir, maybe you are a young grandpa!\n\nThe things you mention are true, sir, as you say, there were 1,025,000 criollos in New Spain in 1793, and 1,092,367 in 1810, true... and only 30 years ago or so, when the population of Mexico was 70,000,000 the whole state of Chihuahua, in the 1970's, had no more than 800,000 people. Two hundred years earlier, the more than one million criollos were more than enough to populate all the northern provinces of New Spain many times over, and, in fact, when you check all the census records as a whole, that is exactly what they did, the criollo population was most concentrated in the north. Of those 1,025,000 criollos of 1793, and the 1,092,367 of 1810, the highest concentration was in Northern New Spain. You made my point quite well, Mr. Arellano, thank you!\n\nOr actually, you made the point of the colonists of Northern New Spain, because the majority of them claimed to be Spaniards, and you made the point of the Founding Fathers of Texas, because they also claimed to be criollos, and you made the point of what they teach in Mexican government issued history books, because in them they teach that \"En el norte no ocurrio tanto el mestizaje, por lo cual es posible observar en los nortenos caracteristicas mas europeas\" (In the north the mixing of the races did not occur as much, for that reason it is possible to observe in the people of the north more European characteristics), I am merely echoing what they said, my study is exegetical.\n\nNow, it is true that the Tables of Ethnicity of the Spaniards stated that the union of a white man with an Indian produced a mestizo, a mestizo with a white man, produced a castizo, and a castizo with a white man, produced a white man (a Spaniard), and that some of the Spaniards were castizos in this regard. In my book, in the final edition which is not out yet, I state that a small number of the Spaniards that I count are the offspring of mestizos with Spaniards, and that I do so because that is what the Tables of Ethnicity did, in it I say that the offspring of mulattos with Spaniards I count as mulattos because the Tables of Ethnicity said African blood could not be assimilated (the offspring of coyotes with mestizos I count as mestizos).\n\nGenetically, as it pertains to the mestizos turning into Spaniards through intermarriage with Spaniards, that is exactly what happens, the Indian genotype is assimilated into the European genotype, so that after just a couple of generations, a castizo Spaniard looks like a Peninsular, which is why the Spaniards, without knowing genetics, concluded that the union of a castizo with the Spaniard produced a Spaniard. In Northern New Spain there were more than enough criollos, and few enough mestizos, for the mestizos to be assimilated and diluted genetically into the European genepool. That does not take away from their \"Spaniardness\" anymore than some Indian blood takes away from the \"Angloness\" of many Anglos who have Indian blood at some level, especially when DNA studies of Europeans, including Nordics, Jews and Italians, all who contributed to the formation of the Spaniard \"race\" in Spain, who have never left Europe have shown\n\nhaplogroups present in Native Americans.\n\nHey, Jesus was a pure Palestinian Jew before the Jews intermarried so much with the Europeans, He is counted by God as the Jewish Messiah and Salvation is of the Jews... yet in the genealogical line of Jesus we find the prostitute Rahab, who was a Canaanite, and Ruth, who was a Moabite, yet Jesus, and King David whose great grandmother was the Moabite Ruth, and whose great great grandmother was the Canaanite Rahab, yet Jesus and King David were both Jews among Jews, and God the Father Himself counted them as Jews among Jews, with her ggggmother a mestiza, and some other Indian somewhere way back, Mimi is a Spaniard among Spaniards, especially when Indian haplogroups are found among Europeans who have never left Europe. The only \"pure\" race is the Human race.\n\nThe issue here, Mr. Arellano, is not \"purity of race\", rather, it is purity of identity, the colonial pioneers of Northern New Spain, including Texas and the American Southwest, considered themselves Spaniards, they called themselves Spaniards, and that in contrast to the \"all Indian groups, including the Mexicans\". One thing is absolutely certain, they were not the deeply racially mixed and Mexican Indian crowd that many claim, they were distinctly Spaniards, whether because they did not intermarry at all, or because some of them who were mestizos were assimilated, by the Tables of Ethnicity, and by the very real genetic assimilation and dilution.\n\n1,029,000 criollos in New Spain in 1793 is a whole lot of people! A lot! Especially when one remembers that in central and southern Mexico the criollo population was negligible and the Indian population was, and is, overwhelming.\n\nOver a million criollos in 1793, when there were only 2.5 million people in all of the 13 formerly British colonies, is certainly way more than enough to populate Northern New Spain... and in fact, they did.\n\nAlex Loya alexloya@integrity.com\n\n[[Editor: To read Alex Loya's full response to Mr. Arellano's Open Letter to Alex Loya, Alex invites you to click on the link link below and read chapters 3 and 4 entitled \"Spaniard Americans\" and \"What Happened To The One Million?\" respectively (they have been updated to respond to Mr. Arellano's concerns).\n\nhttp://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/images/texforum/txforumloya.htm ]]\n\nOn July 10, 2004, I crossed the border into Mexico at Roma, Texas. I was about to find out who my Mexican relatives really were. This topic was a source of confusion and resistance every time I brought up the question of our family history. I have always wanted to find out about my origins. There was so much mystery about our family history that I began to feel like an orphan. All I knew was that my grandparents came from Mexico. I was going into Mexico to finally find answers to the question of where we came from.\n\nOn the Mexican side of the border is Ciudad Miguel Aleman. I was stopped by a Mexican border policeman who asked, \"What is your business in Mexico?\" I said, \"Im going to try to find family in Monterrey.\" \"What are their names and where do they live?\" he asked. \"I dont know their names, but Im hoping to find some Lozanos in a small town outside Monterey called Santa Maria La Floreña.\" \"Do you mind pulling your truck over to the parking area, I want to search your truck.\"\n\nHe proceeded to look over everything in my truck. He even looked in my ice chest. After not finding anything suspicious, he let me go. I was through my first challenge.\n\nAs soon as you cross into Mexico you know youre in another country. The buildings all look different. Most of the buildings are made of stucco. The stucco is mostly tan, white or yellow. The doorways and windows are all arched. You see a lot of brightly painted signs advertising various businesses. Music is always being played over speakers. People walk everywhere. There is wrought iron on the windows, fences and over the entrances. Many vendors sell their wares in little kiosks lining the sidewalks. The roofs on the houses are flat and many are made of rounded ceramic tiles. All of the buildings are crowded together and very few of them are higher than two stories. And everything is in Spanish. The stop signs say \"Alto.\" Slow is \"Despacio.\"\n\nI headed next to Ciudad Mier. It is at a crossroads of Route 2 and Route 54. I took 54. After Ciudad Mier, I entered the wide-open spaces of lonely cattle ranches. In the middle of this deserted area, I came upon a roadblock. There were lots of soldiers checking every car. They were armed with automatic rifles. When it was my turn, a soldier came up to my window and asked for my identification. I showed him my official papers that allowed me to travel legally in Mexico. It was scary, but he said, \"Move on.\" After driving a couple of hours, I came to the town of Cerralvo. I was told that my grandmother, Refugio Lozano Bosque, was born here. I have no proof of this, but one of the first businesses that I saw had a big sign on it that read \"Bosque Restaurante.\" This was a good sign that I was on the right trail. Since this is a larger town of several thousand people, I decided to proceed to the town that my grandfather was from because it is a very small village. I reasoned that I would have a better chance of finding relatives if there were fewer people living in the village. Everyone would surely know all the people there.\n\nI traveled about another hour. The road was very narrow. Unlike in the U.S., there are no aprons on the roads here. The surface of the road was very bad and I hit some deep potholes and bounced on some dips in the road. I was more afraid of the truck drivers on this road because they came very close to me when they headed in the opposite direction or were passing me. This definitely was a white-knuckle drive. I was warned to never drive on these roads at night because livestock roam over the road at that time of day. There are no fences out here. I wondered why do I only have to beware of this danger at night, because without fences whats to keep the cows off the road in the daytime as well? I saw a sign that pointed right for the town of Pesqueria. This was the county seat of the smaller village that I was looking for. My destination was the hacienda of Santa Maria La Floreña. This area is mostly flat but you can see the Sierra Madre Mountains in the distance. Pesqueria was founded in 1669 by our relative, Captain Don Francisco de la Garza Falcón. The original ranch that became Pesqueria was called Espiritú Santo. Pesqueria is a city of about 2,000 people. When I drove through the town, it appeared deserted. There were very few people around. The houses were made of stone and stucco. Every building had a square look to it. It did not look very prosperous. There was a corner store with a large sign that read \"Mini Market Super Lozano.\" It had Coca-Cola and Corona beer signs plastered all over it. There was a church in the center of the town. We would call it the town square; they call it their plaza. In the plaza was an elevated gazebo. The church is named Nuestra Señora de Loreta. It was built in 1889. It was obvious that the town was very proud of its one recreation facilitya pool and water park called Ojo de Agua. I passed a police station. I had read somewhere that the police might try to shake you down for bribes if they see you are from the U.S. As I drove by the police station, I saw that there were several police officers outside. When they saw me, they tried to wave me over. I acted like I didnt see them and kept on driving. They didnt pursue me. I quickly passed through the narrow one-way streets of Pesqueria and entered the farming lands on the outskirts of town. Just outside of town, on the east side, is the river that gives Pesqueria its name. I followed this road straight for another 15 miles until I came to Santa Maria la Floreña.\n\nSanta Maria la Floreña is a village, or hacienda, of about 300 people. The town looked very primitive. Some of the houses looked run down. There were clumps of scattered trees throughout the area. You could see the mountains in the distance. The only vehicles on the dusty road were late model pickup trucks. Both sides of the road were lined with rough fences made from cut limbs and barb wire. There were prairie grasslands everywhere growing in patches in the parched white salty soil. The village itself was comprised of a group of scattered, old buildings mostly made of white stucco. Two small mini markets and a cantina were the extent of business in town. As I drove through the town I saw some school girls and their mothers collecting money for a charity. There was a uniformed policeman who was helping to stop cars so the girls could ask for a contribution. I asked what they were collecting for and one of the girls told me they were raising money to learn to speak English. I gave them five dollars and asked for information on any Lozanos in town. The policeman directed me to the mini-market to ask there. Before I went to Mexico, I had prepared a letter of introduction that explained who I was looking for written in Spanish. The letter read, \"I am looking for information on my family. My great-grandfathers name is Eugenio Lozano. He is from Pesqueria. He died in Santa Maria la Floreña. He was born in 1852 and died in 1923. He was married to Antonia Elizondo. I am looking for relatives of Eugenio and Antonia. Can you please help me with any information that might be useful?\" The owner of the store asked everyone who was hanging around the store if they knew of any Lozanos until one old man said that he knew of a man by that name who owned some property down the street. We waited around for a while talking because he said that the man usually comes by late in the day. The owner of the store gave me a free bottle of Coke. After waiting about half an hour, the guy figured that I would not be a very good conversationalist since I only spoke limited Spanish, so he agreed to take me to the house where I could wait on my own. I thanked him and sat in front of a great looking house waiting for Mr. Lozano to return.\n\nThe only sounds were of the occasional trucks that went by and the crowing of the many roosters and chickens in the nearby yards. I didnt know what to expect since I was told by my father that the village was very isolated. As far as I knew, it could have been a shack in the desert. This house looked like one of the best houses in the town. It had a light-reddish hue. Citrus trees surrounded it. Some were orange and some were lemon\n\ntrees.\n\nThere was an empty swimming pool and a pavilion-like shelter in the yard. While sitting out front in the comfortable sun, I noticed several boys looking at me from across the road. I waved hello to them and they came over to see who this stranger was. I introduced myself and asked if the people who lived in the house were expected back soon. They said they didnt know. They told me their names. Jorge Garza was 11 years old. He was short and of light complexion. He was the most talkative of the boys. Another boy was Antonio González who was 14. He was light-skinned and had reddish-blond hair. Antonio had dropped out of school. I found out that most kids in Santa Maria had dropped out by 14 years of age. There was Orlando Perez who was 12 years old. He had a dark complexion, bright smile and was very smart. The oldest was Alejandro Garza who was the 15 year-old brother of Jorge. Alejandro was shy. He had also dropped out of school and was working full-time picking fruit from citrus trees. After waiting another hour, I asked the kids if they could direct me to the cemetery. They said they would take me there if I wanted. I said they could if they would go ask their parents for permission. They went home and came back with Jorge and Alejandros father. He said that he worked as the caretaker of the house and that the man would not be back until tomorrow afternoon. He also said it would be alright if the boys took me to the cemetery to look for the grave of my great-grandfather Eugenio. I gave the kids some tacos I had in my cooler and some cold drinks and then we drove down dirt roads to the cemetery. I was glad they were taking me there because Im sure I would have never found it.\n\nThe cemetery was in a very isolated spot, tucked away in the middle of nowhere. There was a cement facade that looked like the front of a church. It had the name of Santa Maria la Reina Saint Mary the Queen. The boys and I spread out and started looking for Lozanos. Every time we found the name, they called me over and I took a photograph of the headstone. The cemetery was overgrown with weeds and had prickly stickers all over. I was concerned that we would step on a rattlesnake. After about an hour, we covered the entire cemetery and found a lot of Lozanos, but I did not find anyone whose name I recognized. I took the kids home and told them that I would return the next afternoon. As I reflected on my good luck of locating my grandfathers house, a feeling of extreme excitement and pride overcame me. I felt like I had just won the lottery. Here I was in a country that I knew nothing about. I barely spoke the language. I really didnt know where I was going because all the maps that I had were not very detailed and did not even show Santa Maria la Floreña. With all of these obstacles, I had made extraordinary progress on my first day.\n\nWe first went to a house just outside of town where I met Hilda Gloria Garza González who was 64 years old and handicapped. She sat on a rug on the floor. She said she was related to the Lozanos and that the Garzas were also related to the Lozanos. She wrote down the names of her deceased mother and father and the names of her brothers and sisters. We did not have too long of a conversation because she was obviously not well. There was a woman who cared for her as a nurse/caregiver. I thanked her for her information and proceeded to our next destination to meet a man named Osvaldo Lozano Cantú.\n\nHe is the grandson of my great grandfather Eugenio and his second wife Ramona Garza. He lived about 20 miles away in a town named Agua Fria. We came up to this beautiful walled compound with a six foot wrought iron gate. Inside was one of the nicest houses in the neighborhood. There, I finally would meet my cousin Osvaldo Lozano, Blanca his wife, and his Aunt Elida who is 80 years old. Blanca is the daughter of the Mayor of Aqua Fria. Osvaldos grandfather was half-brother to my grandfather Gustavo. Osvaldo number 1 inherited the cattle ranch where the house is located in Santa Maria la Floreña. Osvaldo number 2 took over the ranch. The first two generations of Osvaldos are dead now. The person I was meeting was Osvaldo number 3 who was about 40 years old. He no longer lived in Santa Maria and has a neighbor look after the empty house. Osvaldo told me that his cousin, Salvador Lozano, had the most knowledge about the family. Salvador lives in Monterrey. Salvadors half brother is Noe Lozano who lives in California. He has a PhD and is the Associate Dean of Engineering at Stanford University. My cousin, Osvaldo, and his aunt had the family trait of being very light-complexioned. We talked for about an hour about our family. Osvaldo said that he was a teacher. Elida was the daughter of Osvaldo. I thanked them for helping me and expressed my gratitude for making this one of my greatest moments. I was glad that little Jorge had videotaped the whole meeting that I had with my new found cousins. All of this side of the family is half-cousins because they were from my grandfathers second marriage to Ramona Garza. I still had to find my relatives through my great grandfathers first wife, Antonia Elizondo. My direct grandfather, Gustavo, was the youngest son of Eugenio and Antonia. The oldest child was Antonio. The second son was Jose Guadalupe. There were two girls, Josepha and Felicitas. As the sun started to set, I reflected on how God had blessed me on my quest. I was on a high of good fortune. It would be getting dark soon and I needed to get back fast so as to not get caught on these country roads at night. Tomorrow I would be searching for my original family documents in the Archives of the State of Nuevo Leon.\n\nThe first place that I needed to locate was the State Civil Registration Office at the corner of Zaragoza and Cinco de Mayo. There were long lines of people everywhere I looked. There were about four floors in this modern building. I didnt have a clue as to how to get started. Which line do I get into or who to ask for help? I wandered around the building trying to look for a likely target. Finally, I saw an office with a pregnant receptionist who was probably the clerk for one of the supervisors. I went up to her and said that I was from the United States and that I was looking for help to find some of my relatives records. I then gave her my pre-typed letter that described who I was looking for. I dont know this womans name but she got on her computer and within a few minutes she brought up the name of my great grandfather, Eugenio Lozano. The record was from August 13, 1935. It was a birth record for a child named Eugenio Lozano González. The child was born in Pesquería. The parents were Filomón Lozano and Cleofas González and the grandparents were Eugenio Lozano and Ramona Garza, and Felix González and Virginia Gutiérrez. Filomón was the third child born to my great grandfather, Eugenio and his second wife Ramona Garza. The child, Eugenio Lozano González, was named after my great grandfather, Eugenio Lozano González. I then asked the nice woman if there were any more records about the older Eugenio Lozano. She said, \"We only have records at this office back to 1935. You will have to go to the Archives General of the State of Nuevo Leon at the corner of Juan Ignacio Ramon and Zaragoza for all records before 1935.\" She said, \"Talk to Raul Olivas.\" She then said, \"Let me call him for you and tell him to be expecting you.\" I couldnt believe my good luck, especially since so many other people were standing in long lines and looking frustrated. I came in and I got immediate service. This young receptionist probably was not even responsible for the information that I was asking for, but she dropped everything she was doing to help me. I dont think I would have been so lucky if this was in a U. S. government office. I thanked her profusely and then I headed out to find the other office.\n\nThe next day, I determined to be back at the State Archives Office first thing in the morning. I got there just when the doors opened and asked a short, slightly overweight man if he would help me. His name was José Maria. He immediately went to work personally looking at the complicated index systems that were written in Spanish. He asked a woman by the name of Consuela to help him. Before I knew it, they were bringing me the exact documents that I was looking for of all my relatives. They brought me the marriage certificate of my great grandfather. They brought me his birth certificate. They even showed me the birth certificates of all his children. What was even more amazing is that they did this all within a couple of hours. For some unknown reason, they gave me priority treatment even though there were long lines of people waiting. This whole experience was unbelievable. I was overwhelmed by the helpfulness of complete strangers. This was the first time that I had certified sources to back up my personal family sources. Furthermore, I was able to identify who my great-great grandparents were. My great grandfather Eugenios father was Antonio Lozano and he married Augustina González on November 20, 1848 in Santa Rosa, Mexico. Agustinas parents were Ygnacio González and Maria Luisa Guajardo. My Great Grandfather Eugenio had five children by his first marriage to Antonia Elizondo. The children were: Antonio(1880), José Guadalupe(1882), Josepha (1884), Felicita (1886), and my grandfather Gustavo, (1888). The second marriage of Eugenio Lozano to Ramona Garza produced six more children. The children were Osvaldo, Salvador, Filomon, Domingo, Celia, and Quiotilda. I also found out that my great grandmothers parents were Francisco Elizondo De la Garza and Isabel Elizondo Elizondo who were married on May 4, 1833. I couldnt believe that I began this search with only being able to trace my family to the early 1900s and now I was in the early 1800s. I next would try to search the Catholic Church records at the nearby Cathedral.\n\nI headed out early to find the catholic archives which were located on the corner of Zuazua and Ocampo. This ended up being about 15 blocks away. It was quite a hike, but there were lots of new sites to see on the way. I came upon the Municipal Palace which is located next to a huge open Plaza covering about 40 acres. At the center of the Plaza is Neptunes Fountain, an impressive bronze sculpture created by noted Mexican Artist, Luis Sanquino. There is also a great outdoor shopping area that rivals anything in the United States, just blocks across from the Catholic Church on Ocampo Street. When I went to the Church office to ask to see their archives, the nun there told me that they are kept in another building located near Washington and Arista streets at number 230 South Arista. The problem was, it was 15 blocks back in the same direction that I had just walked. As I puffed and panted back, I saw a gigantic white stone building located between Doctor Coss and Diego Montemayor Avenues.\n\nThere is a long plaza in front of the Museum of Mexican History. In the plaza is a fountain that sprays water 50 feet into the air. There is also a river and a large reflective pond that surrounds the building and is filled with koi fish. On a wall next to the building, there is an 80 foot long proclamation to the King of Spain from the Founder, Diego Montemayor, naming the City Monterrey in the year 1596. I decided to go in the building. Inside were exhibits from Aztec Indians to modern times. There was also a library and a cafeteria. I didnt stay long because I wanted to get to the church archives, but I decided to return later to check out the resources in the library.\n\nI then proceeded to the church archives. When I got to the right street, I couldnt find anything that looked like a church. I walked around the block a couple of times without spotting the church. All I saw were flat roofed houses built one next to the other. They all looked like private residences. Finally, I went up to one of the houses and saw a small sign on the door that said it is only open until noon. It was already past noon so I would have to come back tomorrow at 9 a.m. I decided to go back to the Museo de História Mexicana.\n\nI went straight to the library where I asked for information about the first settlers who came to Nuevo Leon. The director of the library, Blanca Muñoz, did not speak any English but her assistant, Mariana González, was proficient in English. Blanca was a short, dark-haired, light-skinned woman in her mid thirties. Mariana was a tall beautiful light skinned girl with long light brown hair. She brought me all the books that they had that contained information about the history of Monterrey. I found wills and stories about the Lozanos of Nuevo Leon. Mariana and Blanca were busy all afternoon helping me. I learned of a person on the internet by the name of Leticia Montemayor who was a professor. She writes about genealogy and regional history. I asked the two women if they knew this person. They said that they had heard of her, but did not know her personally. They began calling various people until they located her. When they contacted her, I talked to her about my interest in learning more about my family history. She agreed to meet me the next day at the Museum of Mexican History. Just before the Museum closed, the librarians heard about a special program being held that night about the town of Pesqueria. This was an unbelievable coincidence since this was the home of many of my relatives. This had again been an example of Divine Providence. Everything seemed to be falling in place for me. When night came, I made my way to the meeting room at the Museum. The guest speaker was professor Mario Elizondo Montalvo. He spoke about the history of the town of Pesqueria. He explained that the first settlers attempted growing various crops. They tried corn, beans, oats, melons and sugar cane. Sugar cane didnt succeed because the soil was too salty which caused the sugar to be less sweet. There also were not enough mills to process the cane that was grown in the area. There was a prison in the town for a while. This particular prison had a bad reputation because they housed women there. The people of the town protested the treatment of the women prisoners. The Mayor finally decided that he had to improve the conditions in the prison.\n\nThere were many stories about the revolutionary, Pancho Villa who tried to get the people to support his cause, but the people didnt think much of Pancho because he drank heavily in all the bars. The professor talked about the founder of the town, Francisco De La Garza Falcón, who developed a successful cattle ranch operation. They had stock that numbered in the thousands, mainly sheep, cattle and horses. During the war with the United States in 1844, the men of the town were very active in the fighting. They battled over three days on September 22, 23, 24 of 1844. He told the standing-room-only crowd that my relatives José Maria Guerra Lozano and Dolores Elizondo fought very bravely. Antonio González Garza was killed. The Mexican soldiers fought guerrilla warfare against the U.S. soldiers after being defeated in the battle for Monterrey. The Mexicans captured supplies and horses in numerous ambushes against the U.S. soldiers. I decided after hearing about the more personal side of history from this seminar, to try to find out what my ancestors did during their lifetime. That night after I went to my room, I dreamed of the great things that my Mexican ancestors did over the centuries.\n\nIt was only a short walk from the hotel to the church archives. I was the first one there. It was a one-room office. In the center of the small room was a conference table. There was one attendant who sat at a small desk in front of a doorway that led to a large area in the back for storing the valuable papers. I gave the attendant the span of years and the name of the town that I was looking for. He brought out the bound books of all the marriage, birth and death records. While I looked through one book, he looked through the other books. Before long, I found that my great great great grandparents were Juan Nepomunceno Lozano Ayala and Trinidad Montemayor González who were born in 1806 and 1809 respectively. They were the parents of Antonio Lozano. Trinidads parents were Andres Montemayor and Rafaela González. The final record of my family that I found at the church archives were the parents of Juan Nepomenceno who were Francisco Lozano de Gongora and Gertrudis Ayala Guerra. They were married on February 6, 1782. Their parents were Andrés Lozano de la Garza and Antonia de Gongora. Gertrudiss parents were Ramon Ayala and Francisca Guerra. I took pictures of every original record. A few minutes before the office closed, I met a woman who was also searching for records. She told me her name was *Edna Yolanda Elizondo*. She said that we should stay in touch because we might find some common relatives. As it turned out, her ancestors were from the same town as mine and we had many common relatives. We have since communicated regularly. I found this cousin just by fate. My second cousin, Cesar González Elizondo, who is the Mayor of San Benito, Texas, is also related to this branch of the Elizondo family.\n\nMy meeting with the renowned historian Letecia Montemayor de Lazos was set for noon at the Mexican History Museum. I arrived there to meet a middle-aged, professionally dressed woman. She was very attractive and carried herself in a businesslike way. She definitely was a leader of people. I felt very fortunate that she was taking the time out of her busy day to meet with me. We went to the cafeteria to have coffee. She asked to see my research on my family tree. After she looked it over, she immediately recognized\n\nthat we were related through my Montemayor relative, Trinidad Montemayor, who married Juan Nepomenceno Lozano. She then told me that we were related to the General who founded Monterrey in 1596, Diego Montemayor. Letecia then wrote down for me some of the famous family tree that she has documented. She gave me a brief rundown of the significance of the Montemayor family line. I was amazed at what I was hearing. My family arrived with the first conquistadors of Mexico. They were also of Spanish royal blood. They were wealthy landowners in Mexico. She took me to the library and made me copies of some of her documents and promised that she would get me more by the next day. When we departed, the businesslike formality broke down and we gave each other a warm hug of long lost family. I couldnt believe the good fortune that had been with me since I began this journey. I was very thankful to God for guiding me in all the right directions. I was on cloud nine and I didnt think that I would ever come down. I just needed to walk and reflect on all that had happened on this great day.\n\nWhen I entered the lobby to my hotel, the night attendant informed me that a phone call had come from a man named Eduardo Montemayor. I said that it was too late to call him back, but he insisted that the man wanted me to call him no matter how late it was. Since I couldnt make a long distance phone call from the hotel, I had to go find an all night convenience store and buy a phone card. I then had to go to a street phone to make the call. When I finally got Eduardo on the phone, we tried to communicate with each other. His English was about as bad as my Spanish. Because we both struggled to understand each other it took much time. In the process, the phone card ran out of time. I then had to go back to the store to buy another one. After about three tries, I finally got him back on the phone. He then said that he was going to come over to the hotel. He showed up about a half hour later. He was a short man. Eduardo was from the south suburb of San Pedro Garza Garcia. He was a thin short man in his late forties. He was a light-skinned, blue eyed Mexican. He told me that blue eyes were a family trait. I know this to be true because my great great grandfather, Eugenio Lozano, had blue eyes. Eduardos hair was light brown and he had a graying thin mustache and goatee. In many ways he resembled me. He had an injured left arm, similar to Bob Dole. Eduardo told me that he was a schoolteacher. It seems like we have our share of military men and schoolteachers in my new family tree. We talked all night about our common family tree. He brought with him a thick photo album that was well organized into various sections that described different family members. In order for me to fully understand him we asked the hotel night clerk to translate for us. I will always remember how thankful I was for this complete stranger who spent a couple of hours helping us to tell our family stories to each other. One of the persons that we were related to, that Eduardo was proudest of, was a Hollywood movie star popular during the 1960s to the 1980s by the name of Yvette Mimieux. She was born to Yolanda Montemayor and Rene Mimieux. It is such a coincidence that her big movie break was in one of my favorite childhood movies\"The Time Machine\" by H.G. Wells. She played the role of Weena. This Movie received the Oscar for Best Special Effects. Yvette became famous as the teenage, blond, beach bunny in the movie, \"Where the Boys Are\" and was also in the \"Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm\" with Barbara Eden. Yvette starred in the movie \"Toys in the Attic,\" with Dean Martin. Life Magazine adorned its cover with Yvette in 1960 and 1963. She also starred in the popular T.V. series, \"Dr. Kildare.\" Her first husband was film director Stanley Donen who directed \"Singing in the Rain,\" and \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.\" As the sun slowly began to rise, I said goodbye to Eduardo.\n\nI woke up at the crack of dawn the next morning to begin my journey back into the United States. On the way back, I stopped at a few towns. One was Cerralvo and the other was Marin. I found virtually no one moving around in either of these towns, partly because it was so early, and partly because people stay in their homes unless they are working. Even though Cerralvo was said to be the birthplace of my grandmother I thought I would save that search for the future. My temporary car insurance would be expiring tomorrow. As I reentered the U.S., I felt overwhelmed by what I had just experienced. This trip so far was definitely a life altering experience. I had achieved so much in such a short time. I couldnt wait to see what new discoveries were awaiting me on the rest of my journey.\n\n*Edna Yolanda Elizondo* is helping to put on an Elizondo family reunion in Mexico,\n\nclick for information.\n\nYou'll also find the will of Pedro Lozano, dated 9 septiembre de 1674 shared by Edna."
