        "text": "Projected record: 84-78 (49% playoff odds | 0.7% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? The Cubs surpassed expectations only to fall just short of the postseason. This year, they're favorites to win the NL Central. They're counting on an influx of top prospects to help out. The Cubs boast the best farm system in the National League, and 11 of the organization's top prospects, according to ESPN's Kiley McDaniel, could realistically make their debuts in 2024. That list is topped by Pete Crow-Armstrong, who was the favorite to open the season as the Cubs' starting center fielder until they re-signed Cody Bellinger last month. Crow-Armstrong will make his way to Chicago at some point this season. He won't be alone. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: Four times Craig Counsell has finished second in NL Manager of the Year voting. He's never won. His reputation could hardly be more sparkling and in the managing game, reputation matters. That's how you become the highest-paid field general in history. So if the Cubs break out as NL Central champs and it doesn't feel like a default win because of a bad division, Counsell is going to end his MOY drought. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can become true contenders: Justin Steele emerged in his age-27 season last year, going 16-5 with a 3.06 ERA to finish fifth in National League Cy Young voting. Behind him there are questions -- about Shota Imanaga's transition from Japan, how Jordan Wicks performs in his first full season in the major leagues, how Jameson Taillon bounces back and whether hyped pitching prospect Cade Horton emerges. The Cubs will have a solid offense and a good defense. If the rotation steps up, they'll run away from a crowded NL Central. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: Seiya Suzuki put it all together in the second half of his second season with the Cubs, hitting .313/.372/.566. Let's say he comes close to that over an entire season: .300/.370/.540 with 30 home runs. -- Schoenfield\n\n15. San Francisco Giants\n\nProjected record: 83-79 (40% playoff odds | 0.6% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? San Francisco needed an infusion of talent. They used the entire offseason, and most of spring training, to complete a significant one. The Giants tried signing Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto. That didn't happen, giving credence to the idea that the club can't land premier free agents. Signing Jung Hoo Lee to a six-year $113 million contract -- an overpay in some observers' eyes -- plus Jorge Soler and Jordan Hicks didn't change the club's expected fortunes much. But getting Matt Chapman and Blake Snell during spring training altered the expectations surrounding San Francisco. Add Robbie Ray's expected summer return and the Giants are legitimate postseason contenders. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: The somewhat beleaguered Farhan Zaidi had himself a strong hot stove season. Despite that narrative dominated by the Giants whiffing on elite free agents, he managed to ink Snell, Lee, Chapman, Soler and Hicks. He nabbed Nick Ahmed on a minor league deal. His trade for Ray could pay off big later in the season. Zaidi also plucked Bob Melvin from division rival San Diego to replace Gabe Kapler in the dugout. If the Giants bust out, Zaidi is going to be a leading contender for Executive of the Year. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can become true contenders: The Giants received 729⅓ innings from their starting rotation last year, dead last in the majors. Only two pitchers went more than 150 innings: Logan Webb and Alex Cobb, who underwent hip surgery in October. That will have to change. Adding Snell will certainly help matters, even though he also isn't known for going deep in games. But Hicks' transition to the rotation and Ray's emergence in the second half will be critical here. Just as important: Kyle Harrison's development in his age-22 season. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: The Giants gave Lee a six-year, $113 million contract as a free agent from South Korea, betting his contact skills and ability to hit for average will translate to the majors. They will: He hits .301 with a .360 OBP and becomes the first Giants player since Hunter Pence in 2014 to score 100 runs. -- Schoenfield\n\n16. Cincinnati Reds\n\nProjected record: 80-82 (31% playoff odds | 0.6% World Series odds\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? For 17 years, Joey Votto was Reds baseball. The future Hall of Famer won an MVP, made six All-Star teams and became a beloved athlete in Cincinnati -- and beyond. But the Reds have flipped the page, going all-in on a promising youth movement while Votto tries to make an impact on his hometown Blue Jays. It'll be strange not seeing Votto in a Reds uniform. But if Elly De La Cruz, Matt McLain, Hunter Greene, Andrew Abbott and the rest of a deep young core put the Reds back on a winning track, the fan base will move on just fine. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: The odds like Reds skipper David Bell as a Manager of the Year candidate, second only to Chicago's Craig Counsell. But let's dream a little and point to the immense potential of Elly De La Cruz. Yeah, it's unlikely. He's only 22 and has less than 100 MLB games under his belt. He swings at everything and misses a lot of the time. In the field, despite De La Cruz's athleticism, his metrics have been negative because you never know where he's going to chuck the ball. But let's say he pulls it all together. We're talking 30 homers, 40 steals, highlight reel defense. It's probably too soon for this conversation, but the potential is there for something really special. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can become true contenders: We know all about the head-turning crop of young position-player talent, but it'd be really nice if Cincinnati could get something similar on the starting pitching front to complement Greene. We're talking about Nick Lodolo and Andrew Abbott in the major leagues, and Connor Phillips, Rhett Lowder and Chase Petty in the minors. Phillips (54th), Lowder (65th) and Petty (70th) all cracked Kiley McDaniel's Top 100 at the start of the year. At least one of them should graduate to the majors this season. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: We'd love to proclaim a breakout season for De La Cruz ... but instead we'll call one for Hunter Greene, who finally stays healthy, makes 30 starts, strikes out 200 batters and posts a 3.50 ERA, giving him the highest WAR for a Reds pitcher under the age of 25 since Edinson Volquez's 4.8 at age 24 in 2008. -- Schoenfield\n\n17. St. Louis Cardinals\n\nProjected record: 85-77 (56% playoff odds | 1.6% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? The Cardinals did not waste time addressing their most pressing need over the offseason: starting pitching. They quickly signed veterans Kyle Gibson and Lance Lynn to one-year deals in November before giving Sonny Gray a three-year, $75 million deal a week later. They ended the offseason by signing Brandon Crawford -- another 30-something-year-old -- to be a backup infielder. The Cardinals filled their biggest need. Time will tell if they got better. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: The Cardinals have some interesting rookies like Masyn Winn and Victor Scott II. They have a recent MVP in Paul Goldschmidt. They signed last year's AL Cy Young winner, Gray. The oddsmakers actually give manager Oliver Marmol the team's best probability, likely because if St. Louis snaps back to form, he'll get a lot of the credit. But let's go with Nolan Arenado for MVP. He's never won it, making him one of the best active players without an MVP trophy. He's got a lot to prove after having his Gold Glove streak snapped. Arenado turns 33 soon and this may be his last, best chance to an MVP run. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can become true contenders: The Cardinals' vaunted development pipeline has stalled, forcing the front office to plug several rotation holes from the outside this offseason. If Gray, Gibson and Lynn, signed for a combined $99 million, can step up, the Cardinals might challenge for the NL Central. If not, it will be another grueling summer in St. Louis. Cardinals starters finished last season with a 5.08 ERA. Only the Royals, Reds, A's and Rockies were worse. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: Nolan Gorman cracks 40 home runs and Jordan Walker hits 30 -- but the Cardinals still miss the playoffs with 80 wins, recording their first back-to-back losing seasons since 1994-95.-- Schoenfield\n\nTier 4: We're saying there's a chance\n\n18. New York Mets\n\nProjected record: 79-83 (24% playoff odds | 0.3% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? David Stearns tinkered with the roster in his first offseason leading the Mets' front office, signing nine free agents to one-year contracts, highlighted by the addition of J.D. Martinez just a week before Opening Day. Sean Manaea received a two-year deal -- with an opt-out after this season -- as part of the Mets' mini rotation overhaul. Starters Luis Severino (one-year deal) and Adrian Houser (trade) were also added to the mix. But the most significant change will be deploying Edwin Diaz for the ninth inning again. The All-Star closer is back after missing last season with a knee injury that launched a disappointing season in Queens. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: Carlos Mendoza is a little under the radar but first-time managers have a built-in leg up in manager of the year consideration. That's mostly because they are invariably taking over disappointing teams. The Mets didn't make any major splashes during the winter, instead opting to build up roster depth. You can win that way if the manager leverages the depth in the right way. So if the Mets exceed their middling expectations, Mendoza could become the real king of Queens. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can become 2024's big surprise: In a year's time, the Mets have gone from a popular World Series pick to a team that needs a lot to go right just to stay in a playoff race. Diaz and Jose Quintana need to stay healthy. Severino, Manaea, Starling Marte, Jeff McNeil and Harrison Bader need to bounce back. Martinez needs to keep mashing at age 36. Francisco Alvarez and Brett Baty need to take the next step in their development. Just as important: Kodai Senga, who is nursing a strain in his shoulder capsule, needs to make meaningful contributions. This is very much a transition year for the Mets. Those aforementioned players need to keep it from getting ugly. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: With Pete Alonso on his way to a third straight 40-homer season but the Mets playing under .500 at the trade deadline and the first baseman heading into free agency after the season, the Mets deal him to the Mariners for some prospects -- and then look to re-sign him in the offseason. -- Schoenfield\n\n19. Boston Red Sox\n\nProjected record: 79-83 (21% playoff odds | 0.4% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? What was supposed to be a \"full-throttle\" offseason was a whimper of a winter. The Red Sox again cut payroll -- about $20 million -- and emerged from the offseason with a roster arguably worse than the one that finished 78-84 in 2023. They traded Chris Sale for Vaughn Grissom and replaced Sale with Lucas Giolito, who is out for the season with an elbow injury. They watched James Paxton, Adam Duvall and Justin Turner leave in free agency. They traded Alex Verdugo to the Yankees. Their biggest free agent signings were Tyler O'Neill and Liam Hendriks, who won't pitch until around the trade deadline. The offseason further angered a fan base still reeling from the Mookie Betts trade four years ago. Apathy could be next in Boston. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: Rafael Devers' plate discipline numbers have inched gradually forward throughout his career. Last season he became more of a take-and-rake pull hitter, but one who retained enough aggression to keep his strikeout rate well above average for a legit power hitter. The 2024 season will be Devers' age-27 campaign and, good as he's been, it doesn't feel like we've seen his career season. If 2024 is it, his numbers will be MVP-esque. He has yet to finish in the top 10 in the annual balloting, so he has a lot of voters to win over. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can become 2024's big surprise: The Red Sox have abstained from big signings in recent years, much to their fans' chagrin. Their success in 2024, then, will be largely defined by the development of their young players. Triston Casas (24 years old), Grissom (23) and Ceddanne Rafaela (23) could play a major role in bolstering the offense this season. Yeah, the Red Sox still have to get something from their starting rotation and must navigate the monster that is the American League East, but they have to take it one small step at a time right now. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: Casas picks up where he left off over the final three-plus months last season. While he doesn't post a 1.000 OPS like he did in the second half, he does go over .900 with 35 home runs and starts the All-Star Game. Now here's the really bold part: He leads the Red Sox to a wild-card spot. -- Schoenfield\n\n20. Cleveland Guardians\n\nProjected record: 80-82 (29% playoff odds | 0.5% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? It's more of the same for the Guardians, an organization that pumps out quality starting pitching every year but didn't make any prominent offseason moves. Cleveland's success will ride on a talented rotation that is expected to feature Shane Bieber, Triston McKenzie, Tanner Bibee, Logan Allen and Carlos Carrasco to start the season. Offensively, the lineup could use more punch in the outfield, but there's promise with Jose Ramirez, the sport's most overlooked star, as the engine. Standing pat coming off a 76-win season usually isn't enough to win a division. But this is the AL Central. The Guardians are a contender. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: The Guardians don't have any preseason awards front-runners, but it doesn't take much imagination to picture someone from Cleveland taking any of the major honors. Jose Ramirez is the obvious pick. He's been on the perimeter of AL MVP consideration since 2017. Working against Ramirez is that, at 31, it's hard to imagine the kind of production spike that would steal the spotlight. But Ramirez does so many things well you can't count him out, especially if he posts an upper-end (for him) season in the context of a team breakout. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can become 2024's big surprise: The Guardians are still really good at developing starting pitchers. What they don't have, once again, is much punch in their lineup. The Guardians finished last season with a .397 slugging percentage, fifth-lowest in the majors. They accumulated only 166 home runs from 2022 to 2023, less than every team except the Tigers. It's hard to compete in this era without the benefit of the home run. Because the front office didn't do much of anything to address that this offseason, the likes of Jose Ramirez, Josh Naylor and Bo Naylor will carry a heavy burden. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: The Naylor brothers combine for 51 home runs -- 27 from Josh and 24 from Bo. That puts them in the top 15 all time for brothers in a season (the Giambi brothers hold the record with 61 in 2002). -- Schoenfield\n\n21. Milwaukee Brewers\n\nProjected record: 79-83 (25% playoff odds | 0.3% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? The star power in Milwaukee will be dimmer on Opening Day. Craig Counsell bolted to a rival for the most money ever given to a manager. 2021 Cy Young Award winner Corbin Burnes was shipped to Baltimore. All-Star closer Devin Williams will miss the season's first three months with a back injury. Expectations, consequently, have fallen in Wisconsin. But the Brewers expect to continue competing in the NL Central. Having Jackson Chourio, one of baseball's top prospects, star as a rookie would help. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: In recent years, you've had your pick of the major categories. There was Craig Counsell (manager), Christian Yelich (MVP) and Brandon Woodruff or Corbin Burnes (Cy Young). But 2024 is a season of change in Milwaukee. In a strange way that makes new manager Pat Murphy, who has the rare opportunity of replacing his own protege in Counsell, a viable candidate. If Murphy wins as much as Counsell did with what looks like more of a transitional roster, he'll get support. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can become 2024's big surprise: If the Brewers are going to overcome a diluted roster and make a run in what remains a wide-open NL Central, they'll need some unexpected star-level performances. Chourio, the toolsy center fielder who is ESPN's No. 2 overall prospect, and Joey Ortiz, the young high-floor shortstop acquired in the Burnes trade, have the best chance of providing that. That alone wouldn't be enough to win a division, but it would set Milwaukee up to be truly competitive again as early as 2025. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: The Brewers win the NL Central. That's it. That's our bold pick. Nobody is picking them. The Cubs are the popular choice, the cool kids are going with the Reds, the Cardinals have their believers. Let's go with the Brewers, taking a tight four-team race with 86 wins. And don't sleep on Joey Ortiz, who will outperform Jackson Chourio as the best rookie in the lineup. -- Schoenfield\n\n22. Detroit Tigers\n\nProjected record: 78-84 (19% playoff odds | 0.2% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? The Tigers won't have Miguel Cabrera on their roster for the first time since 2007 after the future Hall of Famer retired following last season. Now it's about the Tigers' youth movement. Tarik Skubal, Riley Greene, Spencer Torkelson, Colt Keith, and Parker Meadows are among the next wave. The Tigers added several veterans to the mix including pitchers Kenta Maeda and Jack Flaherty, but the focus remains on the future. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: Let's say that the AL rookie race has a big three in Jackson Holliday, Evan Carter and Wyatt Langford. A strong No. 4 might be Colt Keith, who should be Detroit's everyday second baseman from the get-go in 2024 after signing a long-term extension in January. The kid can hit and has the ability to light up all three columns of the slash categories. The Rookie of the Year race is often a product of talent plus opportunity. That bodes well for Keith, even as the competition for rookie honors in both leagues figures to be fierce in 2024. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can become 2024's big surprise: Yes, it's all about the future in Detroit. But if they really want to be a surprise, then the veterans need to augment them with bounce-back performances. We're talking about Flaherty (4.84 ERA the past two years), Maeda (4.44 ERA since nearly winning the Cy Young in 2020), Mark Canha (108 OPS+ last season), Gio Urshela (coming off a broken pelvis) and, of course, Javier Baez, who signed a six-year, $140 million contract in November 2021 and proceeded to slash .230/.273/.361 over the next two years. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: With Gerrit Cole missing the start of the season, the AL Cy Young race is wide open. How about Skubal? Just doubling his stats from last season makes him a strong contender: 30 starts, 2.80 ERA, 200-plus strikeouts, .199 batting average, 14 wins. He wins the award. -- Schoenfield\n\n23. Miami Marlins\n\nProjected record: 77-85 (18% playoff odds | 0.2% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? The Marlins reached the postseason for just the second time since winning the 2003 World Series, but they ended up with a front office overhaul anyway. Kim Ng, the highest-ranking woman in a major North American professional sports front office, declined to return as general manager after she learned the team wanted to hire a president of baseball operations over her. The franchise chose Peter Bendix, another branch on the Rays' front office tree. His first offseason was uneventful. Miami, again, will depend on its pitching to carry a faulty offense. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: It's hard to imagine Skip Schumaker winning Manager of the Year a second straight time. It's even harder to imagine Sandy Alcantara winning NL Cy Young from the injured list. Where does that leave us? How about Jesus Luzardo for Cy Young? He put up his first full season in 2023, starting 32 games. His K-rate is a dead certainty and his walk rate has continued to trend downward. Add in some balls-in-play luck and a ramp up to 190 innings and you've got a Cy Young candidate. The baseline talent is there. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can become 2024's big surprise: It needs to start with none other than Jazz Chisholm Jr., the 26-year-old middle-infielder-turned-center-fielder who's bursting with talent but can't manage to stay healthy. Chisholm was limited to 97 games in 2023 -- one year after playing in just 60 of them -- because of turf toe and an oblique strain. He still managed to accumulate 19 home runs and 22 stolen bases. A full season of Jazz could provide the Marlins with the type of offensive catalyst they so desperately need. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: With the help of his new split change, A.J. Puk's transition to the rotation is a success. He wins 12 games and posts a 3.56 ERA with 170 strikeouts in 150 innings. -- Schoenfield\n\n24. Los Angeles Angels\n\nProjected record: 73-89 (7% playoff odds | 0.1% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? The Angels' inability to reach a postseason -- just once -- in six years with Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout on the same roster at the peak of their powers will boggle minds forever. Ohtani wasn't just a two-way star in Anaheim -- he was a jaw-dropping sensation, a reason for people to show up to the ballpark despite all the losing. Now Ohtani is up the 5, sandwiched between Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman in that stacked Dodgers lineup -- at least for now. And the Angels are left trying to make the playoffs for the first time in a decade without him. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: Mike-freakin'-Trout. Have we forgotten how good this guy is? OK, he's missed so many games that you have to bake his absences into the Angels' team projection. Over the past three seasons, he's played in 237 of a possible 486 games. But let's consider his per-162-games numbers during that span: .283/.382./579, 45 homers, 97 RBIs, 111 runs. Keep this guy on the field and he is -- still -- an MVP front-runner. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can become 2024's big surprise: The Angels' defense against the bevy of criticism levied their way -- for spoiling the careers of two generational talents, for not doing enough to bring back Ohtani, for going more than a decade with a decrepit farm system -- is that they've actually built a solid young core. If the Angels are going to survive the post-Ohtani era, that young core will have to emerge as early as this season. That includes catcher Logan O'Hoppe, shortstop Zach Neto, first baseman Nolan Schanuel, outfielders Jo Adell and Mickey Moniak, and starting pitchers Reid Detmers and Griffin Canning. Their bullpen should be better and their offense will at least be decent if Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon are healthy, but their young players hold the key. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: Only one qualified player since 2011 (not including 2020) has reached a .400 OBP while hitting fewer than 10 home runs: Yandy Diaz in 2022. Rookie first baseman Schanuel posts that old-school line, as he posts a .405 OBP while hitting seven home runs. -- Schoenfield\n\n25. Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nProjected record: 73-89 (8% playoff odds | 0.1% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? Pittsburgh's offseason plan appears to have been to acquire veterans on short-term deals with hopes of flipping them at the trade deadline. In other words, a way to indirectly buy prospects. The Pirates signed Rowdy Tellez, Michael A. Taylor, Martin Perez, Yasmani Grandal, and Aroldis Chapman to one-year contracts. They traded for Marco Gonzales, who has a club option for next season. Most, if not all, of them could be on other teams by August. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: The Pirates sent Paul Skenes to the minors because of reasons and even if they hadn't, he would have had to go against Yoshinobu Yamamoto in the NL Rookie of the Year race. So instead let's dream a little based on what is very likely just a spring mirage: After missing most of 2023 with a leg fracture, Cruz is back and bashing. This spring, he has clubbed seven homers, and most of them were highlight-reel stuff. His OPS was almost dystopian. Cruz's ceiling is prodigious but so too are his flaws. But if we're talking about MVP upside, let's do it now. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can become 2024's big surprise: The Pirates have three pitchers in Kiley McDaniel's Top 100. Of them, Jared Jones is the closest to the majors, Thomas Harrington has the highest floor and Paul Skenes, of course, has the most talent. The Pirates have a solid foundation of position players with Cruz, Ke'Bryan Hayes, Bryan Reynolds and, if he takes a step forward, Henry Davis. They need some pitchers to emerge -- because we all know they won't spend on them in free agency. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: Hayes proves his final two months of 2023 weren't a fluke as he hits .300 with 25 home runs, wins his second straight Gold Glove at third base and also takes home the Platinum Glove as the best overall defender in the NL. It adds up to a top-10 MVP finish. -- Schoenfield\n\n26. Kansas City Royals\n\nProjected record: 72-90 (6% playoff odds | 0.1% World Series odds\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? The Royals are ... going for it? Kansas City was unexpectedly one of the busiest teams over the offseason, improving their roster with several veteran additions. Seth Lugo and Michael Wacha are in the rotation. Will Smith, Chris Stratton, and Nick Anderson are in the bullpen. Hunter Renfroe, Adam Frazier, and Garrett Hampson will supply depth. But the most important -- and expensive -- move was agreeing to an 11-year, $288.8 million extension with Bobby Witt Jr., the face of the franchise. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: Yeah, it's Witt, even though pitcher Cole Ragans has generated so much buzz of late. Witt has played two seasons for the Royals, a franchise that dates back to 1969 and has had a lot of success. (And a lot of not success, but still.) He is arguably already the best shortstop in Royals history. That's kind of an award, but here we're talking more about AL MVP consideration. He can be that, too, and he can do that this season. Repeating some numbers expressed previously: Over his last 56 games last year, Witt hit .323/.369/.589 with 162-game prorated figures of 133 runs, 130 RBI, 41 homers and 61 stolen bases. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can become 2024's big surprise: Witt is really good, and adding some established veteran pieces -- something out-of-contention teams are increasingly abstaining from -- was nice to see. But for the Royals, it's going to come down to how young starting pitchers like Cole Ragans, Brady Singer and Alec Marsh fare. Ragans, acquired in the trade that sent Aroldis Chapman to the Rangers last summer, was really good down the stretch, with a 2.64 ERA in 12 starts. But Singer and Marsh combined for a 5.58 ERA in 234 innings. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: After falling one stolen base shy of the 30/50 club last season, Witt gets there this season in hitting 37 home runs and swiping 60 bases -- the only other player to reach both those figures was Ronald Acuna Jr. last season. Witt also wins a Gold Glove and finishes in the top five of the MVP voting. -- Schoenfield\n\nTier 5: Already playing for next season\n\n27. Washington Nationals\n\nProjected record: 58-104 (0.1% playoff odds | 0% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? If all goes as planned, this season will be one final forgettable last-place finish before a talented young core takes hold and reverses the organization's fortunes in 2025. Some of that core -- Josiah Gray, Keibert Ruiz, CJ Abrams, MacKenzie Gore -- are already big leaguers. James Wood, Dylan Crews, and Cade Cavalli highlight the rebuild's next wave of talent set to make an impact in 2024. More is expected in 2025. And, who knows, maybe the Nationals will start spending money again. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: The Yoshinobu Yamamoto factor, not to mention Jung Hoo Lee, makes it hard to pick an NL Rookie of the Year candidate who might stand out in other seasons. Jackson Chourio (Milwaukee) would surely have been lauded if not for that. Well, the Nationals are hurting for award candidates so we're entering that race anyway and putting forth Crews. If Wood gets to the majors first, we'll go with him. Either way, both players represent hope that someday the Nationals will once again be relevant in awards conversations. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can make their season a success: Abrams, 22, hit 18 home runs and stole 47 bases, but he had a walk rate of just 5.2%. Ruiz, 25, contributed 1.3 Baseball-Reference wins above replacement but was a slightly-below-average hitter based on adjusted OPS. Gray, 26, and Gore, 25, combined for a 4.14 ERA in 57 starts. They all provided encouraging signs -- but they can all stand to take another step forward. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: The future arrives in the second half. Wood reaches the majors at the halfway point and belts 16 home runs in 80 games, showcasing his future 40-homer potential. Crews gets called up a few weeks later and hits .275 with 10 home runs in 60 games. -- Schoenfield\n\n28. Chicago White Sox\n\nProjected record: 61-101 (0.4% playoff odds | 0% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? They did it. They really did it. The White Sox finally traded Dylan Cease, ending the persistent speculation surrounding the right-hander's future over the last year-plus. The White Sox waited until mid-March, and their patience was rewarded with a good haul. But it won't help them this year. Now the trade rumor world turns its attention to another White Sox star: Luis Robert Jr. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: If there isn't an official award for best ballpark food, there ought to be. Get Padma Lakshmi involved. The food at Guaranteed Rate Field is pretty good for a ballpark. Is it the best? Hard to say. That's why we need an award. But decent barbeque, some underrated hand-carved deli sandwiches, Chicago dogs and a solid array of microbrews. If there is an award to be won for the 2024 ChiSox, it's somewhere in this arena, especially since they probably ought to trade Robert sooner than later. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can make their season a success: The White Sox thought that -- like the Braves -- they were building a sustainable, championship-level core, then quickly learned they weren't. And so, success this season would be the likes of Yoan Moncada, Eloy Jimenez, Andrew Vaughn and perhaps even Andrew Benintendi performing well enough to get a nice haul of young players back and build up a farm system that was ranked 20th by ESPN at the start of the season. Yes, Robert will probably factor into this conversation, too -- though building around him sure seems tantalizing. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: The White Sox use 25 different starting pitchers -- breaking the MLB record of 24 shared by the 1915 A's and 2023 A's -- and stumble to 107 losses, most in franchise history. Along the way, Robert is traded at the deadline. -- Schoenfield\n\n29. Colorado Rockies\n\nProjected record: 57-105 (0.1% playoff odds | 0% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? Nothing has changed. They didn't attempt to fix the worst offense in baseball. They did little to improve their pitching. Another last-place finish is on deck for the franchise that paid another team to take Nolan Arenado before signing the baseball player formerly known as Kris Bryant. Why change when you're consistently in the top half of attendance anyway? The formula makes money. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: Bud Black has been a Manager of the Year, winning the award with San Diego in 2010. It's hard both to imagine him winning it again with this year's Rockies and even harder to imagine someone else on the club winning anything. So we'll go with Bud. If this Rockies roster were to make the postseason, Black should win something more along the lines of Manager of the Decade than the one-year honor. Anyway, Colorado fans are lucky to have him. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can make their season a success: Pitching at altitude has been a problem since the Rockies' inaugural season in 1993. But they reached a low in that department last season. Their starters combined to post a 5.91 ERA at home and on the road, the seventh-highest mark this century. It wasn't long ago that the Rockies believed they had finally built some homegrown pitching, but German Marquez and Antonio Senzatela will spend at least the first half of this season recovering from Tommy John surgery. The likes of Kyle Freeland, Austin Gomber and Ryan Feltner desperately need to be better. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: Something nice, you say? Ezequiel Tovar breaks out in his sophomore campaign and hits .300, represents the Rockies at the All-Star Game and, most impressively, unseats two-time reigning NL Gold Glove winner Dansby Swanson at shortstop. -- Schoenfield\n\n30. Oakland Athletics\n\nProjected record: 60-102 (0.2% playoff odds | 0% World Series odds)\n\nWhat has changed most since we saw them last? Oakland is another club going nowhere in 2024 that decided to acquire a few veterans perhaps with a plan to trade them this summer. Ross Stripling, Alex Wood, and J.D. Davis are looking for bounce-back seasons as Oakland continues its deep rebuild. They're not part of the Athletics' long-term plans -- whatever and wherever they are. -- Castillo\n\nMost likely 2024 award winner: Let's not kid ourselves. -- Doolittle\n\nHow they can make their season a success: If guys like second baseman Zack Gelof, closer Mason Miller, outfielder Denzel Clarke, shortstop Darrell Hernaiz and catcher Shea Langeliers can establish themselves as part of a solid, emerging core, that would be a major success. But given the anger from the current locals, the potential apathy that awaits them in Vegas, the uncertainty over their immediate future and the general ineptitude that surrounds all of it, simply surviving another brutal season should be considered a triumph for these A's. -- Gonzalez\n\nOne (realistic) bold prediction: Esteury Ruiz swiped 67 bases last season -- in just 132 games and fewer than 500 plate appearances. With more playing time and a little higher OBP (just .309 in 2023), he goes wild on the bases and steals 85 bases for the first 80-steal season since, yes, Rickey Henderson stole 93 in 1988. -- Schoenfield"
