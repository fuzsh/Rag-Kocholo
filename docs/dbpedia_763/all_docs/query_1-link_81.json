Vázquez is professor of history and philosophy and director of the Hutchins Center for Interdisciplinary Learning at Sonoma State University, California. Among his publications are “Philosophy in Mexico: The Opium of the Intellectuals or a Prophetic Insight” (Canadian Journal of Political and Social Theory, Vol. 4, No. 3, 1980) and “Chicanology: A Postmodern Analysis of Meshicano Discourse” (Perspectives in Mexican American Studies, Vol. 3, 1992).\n\nL A T I N O/A T H O U G H T\n\nLatino/a Thought brings together the most important writings that shape Latino consciousness, culture, and activism today. This historical anthology is unique in its presentation of cross-cultural writings—especially from Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban writers—and political documents that shape the ideology and experience of U.S. Latinos. Students can read, firsthand, the works or authors that have most shaped the Latino/a cultural heritage. They are guided by vivid introductions that set each article or document in its historical context and describe its relevance today. The writings touch on many themes, but are guided by this book’s concern for a quest for public citizenship among all Latino populations and a better understanding of racialized populations in the United States today.\n\nCULTURE, POLITICS, and SOCIETY\n\n“With the publication of this new edition of Latino/a Thought, Francisco H. Vázquez has done a great service to scholars, the Latino community, and the general public. Framed within the global and transnational context and the history of Latino struggles for social justice and political empowerment, this is simply the best, most comprehensive collection of essays available on the Latinos/as in the United States. Readers will find here a wide range of documents and analyses of critical historical, socioeconomic, political, and cultural concern. It is an ideal primer for the classroom or simply for all those seeking a well-rounded overview of the historical and contemporary Latino/a reality.” —William I. Robinson, professor of sociology, University of California, Santa Barbara\n\nCover art by Patricia Speier Torres Cover design by Piper F.

One is the geopolitical and social change affecting the status of Latinas and Latinos in the United States with particular intensity the last few years. It also seems timely and appropriate to implement a number of comments and suggestions that student and colleagues have made on how to improve the first edition. When this book was first written and assembled in 2001–2002, the Latino/a population in the United States was poised to become the largest cultural group in the United States. In just a few short years, Latinos and Latinas have achieved that status. They have become the center of national attention, however, primarily because of immigration issues and, allegedly, how these issues impact the economy and the war against terrorism. This situation is illustrated by the controversial Foreign Policy article by retired Harvard professor Samuel P. Huntington, “The Hispanic Challenge” (March/April 2004) based on his book Who Are We: Challenges to America’s National Identity. Huntington sees the challenge coming primarily from Mexicans, who he considers to be fundamentally different from U.S. Americans. He warns that unless Mexican immigration is limited, there may be hostilities between U.S. Americans and Mexicans similar to the hostilities between Palestinians and Israelis. Obviously, these are critical times not only for U.S. Mexicans, but also for all those who care for the preservation of a democratic society and the development of a sustainable economic democracy that includes all Americans who inhabit this continent. The second edition addresses these\n\nxiii\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nnew developments by including a new piece by William I. Robinson, “Aquí estamos y no nos vamos!”: Global Capital and Immigrant Rights. Huntington’s arguments, which are representative of a deep-rooted anti-Mexican sentiment, are confronted at various points in this book, but primarily in Vázquez’s newly written framing pieces: two revised articles from the first edition, A Continental American Quest for Democracy (formerly Americas Patriots Then and Now) and the concluding chapter Latino U.S.A.: The Canary in the Mine of Continental Democracy (formerly Reflection on Latino/as and Public Citizenship) and a new piece Chicanology: Law, Class Struggle, and Power/Knowledge. In response to students and colleagues’ suggestions, this second edition has undergone several major changes. Both introductions have been rewritten and updated with the latest information and statistics when appropriate, and the language has been streamlined to make it more accessible to students. Part I: Origins and Theories has been redesigned so the focus is clearly on the historical and philosophical context, and on the three main methods that are applied to the understanding of Latino and Latina political thought: liberalism, Marxism and power/knowledge or discursive analysis. Maps and tables that were in the appendix are now integrated into the pertinent readings. Thus, the poem I Am Joaquin by Rodolfo “Corky” Gonzalez is presented in an interactive format with the Chart of Latinos/as in World Events. Additionally, Vázquez’s A Continental American Quest for Democracy now contains the Chart of World Social Movements. This allows the readers to have immediate access to graphics that help understand the text. Another significant change is that instead of a chronological format, each one of the three main groups now has its own section or in the book. This makes the text less fragmented and readers can focus on one group at a time. The sections are arranged according to a chronology of sorts: Mexicans come first because they were incorporated in 1848 through a war of conquest. Cubans are next because by mid-nineteenth century, waves of Cuban political incorporated themselves into the fabric of U.S. society as they sought refuge from, and planned the revolution against the Spanish colonial government. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, as a result of the Spanish-American War, a military government was imposed on Puerto Rico in 1898, thus constructing an ambiguous colonial relationship that remains an issue to this day. This change called for the relocating, rewriting, and updating all the framing pieces. Thus the pieces having to do with U.S. Mexicans are now in Part II and all the pieces having to do with Cubans are in Part III. Part IV includes some of the same texts on Puerto Ricans from the first edition, whereas other texts have been replaced by a chapter by Juan Antonio\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nCorretjer on Albizu Campos and the Ponce Massacre. This text, which is now out of print, provides not only the independentista perspective on an important historical event but also a clear political and economic context for it. Also new are excerpts from the Foraker Act, the Jones Act, and Public Law 600, which are three congressional laws that have shaped the political status of Puerto Rico. In Part V, the last section, all these issues that confront Latinos and Latinas are put into a global, transnational context. A context, furthermore, in which the struggle is not only for social justice, but also for a sustainable world. In an effort to bring into clear focus the role of women in this quest for economic democracy, an article commissioned from Teresa Córdova replaces some of pieces on women issues in the first edition. This part also includes the already mentioned article by Robinson on globalization on immigrant rights. This second edition represents a great effort to integrate the valuable comments and suggestions received from students, colleagues, and blind reviews. My expectation is that this second edition will be a useful tool for the understanding the increasing critical role of Latinas and Latinos in the United States and throughout the American continent. Francisco H. Vázquez, Ph.D. January 21, 2008\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nWho Are These People, and What Do They Want?\n\nIf Latinos and Latinas were fairly invisible in what is known as “the American Century,” they are poised to play a crucial role in the United States of the twenty-first century. Currently this group is 46 million strong (not including 3.9 million residents of Puerto Rico); they make up about 15 percent of the U.S. population and are projected to grow to 25 percent by 20501 (about 102.6 million), and those who are immigrants are applying for U.S. citizenship at an unprecedented rate. There is an emergent, socially oriented middle class with economic clout that has spawned a cohesive national Latina and Latino lobby, and they are considered to be a political third force.2 Furthermore, massive protests in 2006 and 2007, in favor of humane immigration legislation, have sparked not only a new civil rights movement but also an anti-immigrant backlash. Speaking of invisibility, before we continue this discussion, it is imperative to address the issue of language. To acknowledge the presence and contributions of women, we use both Latino and Latina and alternate the order. At times, we resort to using the slash and give words an “o/a” ending. This is, admittedly, awkward and cumbersome but it is necessary to remain conscious of the participation of women in historical and political events. The national elections in the United States in 2000 were so controversial that they masked the fact that a political revolution of another sort was taking place. With 7 percent of the one million voters in the 2000 elections, Latinos/as were the deciding factor in many critical political races, including the contested presidential election. It is said that Mexicans gave the presidency to\n\nxvii\n\nxviii\n\nIntroduction\n\nGore in California and that Cubans took it away from him in Florida.3 Latinos and Latinas can also be a swing vote in the 2008 elections. Though at 9 percent they make up only a relatively small share of the nationwide electorate, Hispanics comprise a larger share of voters in four of the six “swing states” that President Bush carried by margins of 5 or fewer percentage points in 2004— New Mexico, Florida, Nevada and Colorado.4 Indeed, we can now say that Latinos/as are no longer becoming, they are a major political, economic, and cultural force in the United States. This is a status that carries much potential in terms of their contribution and also in terms of the danger of a backlash against Latinos/as who, arguably, are the canary in the mine of democracy. Now here is a sad situation: Latinas and Latinos work hard, participate as much as they can in civic affairs, and shed their blood in the many U.S. wars for democracy. And yet, surveys consistently show that U.S. Latinos and Latinas in the United States do not feel included, accepted, and most importantly, treated with respect by their fellow citizens. History, too, demonstrates ample military, cultural, and sociopolitical reasons why this is so. This feeling has been worsened by the recent anti-illegal immigration attitudes, ordinances, and legislation.5 These anti-Latino and Latina feelings have also penetrated into scholarly discourse, as illustrated by retired Harvard professor Samuel P. Huntington’s “The Hispanic Challenge” in which he claims that Mexican immigrants are fundamentally different from U.S. Americans and raises the specter of race and ethnic wars.6 These are frightening notions, given the fact that the flow of bodies is both ways; most U.S. Americans who live outside the United States, live in Mexico. Consequently, one of the objectives of Latino/a Thought is to facilitate an understanding of this paradoxical and potentially dangerous situation. This book is also an important device to counteract the mantle of invisibility that seems to envelope the Latina and Latino population. Informed people of the United States and abroad will find this book useful for the study of the history of Latinos and Latinas, their quest for both an economic and a political democracy, and the possible directions this struggle may take in the future. One challenge to this quest for social justice is the increasing difficulty in sustaining these memories of past struggles. Young people especially are subjected to a fragmentation of consciousness by cell phones, sidekicks, handheld and laptop computers, etc. On the other hand, unlike previous generations, young people are more open to interacting with people from other cultures, nationalities, and ethnic groups. Consequently, the tone of the framing pieces in this book is directed especially to young people; this is evident by the special introduction for students. Latina and Latino youth, in particular, are in dire need of a historical and political context in which to\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\nlocate their changing identities, the mestizaje that characterizes their culture. They also need this context to make sense of and become active in the social, political, and economic realities of their communities and society in general. Most are not taught their own history, and, if they are taught their own history, it is often biased, or one dimensional, or restricted to one particular group. Through the framing pieces, students are encouraged to read the texts with critical minds, suspend judgment, and not take statements as given truths, but as truths in a complex game of truths. In short, students are encouraged to do what no one power, divine or mortal, can do for them: think for themselves. For each reader, however, the objective is to promote understanding by raising the level of discourse of, by, and for Latinos and Latinas in the United States. Thus far, the topic has been Latinos and Latinas but the focus of this book will be is on Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Mexicans. With regard to the first edition, the question has been asked: “Why not include other Latinos and Latinas?” Although the original concept was to address U.S. Latino and Latina thought in general, as a result of logistical reasons (size of the publication and the diversity of national and ethnic groups), the final decision was to focus on Mexicans, Puerto Ricans and Cubans. The criterion for this decision is that these three groups were incorporated into the United States through a declaration of war (against Mexico in 1848 and against Spain in 1898). The treaties that ended these wars in effect “delivered” not only territory but also these human bodies to the United States. Symbolically, therefore, these treaties represent a sort of birth certificate of these U.S. Latinos. More concretely, they also established a legal foundation that has ramifications to this day; two obvious ones are Puerto Rico’s political status and the U.S. claim over Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. No doubt, an argument can be made that U.S. military and economic intervention has provoked the deliverance of human bodies from other Latin American countries to the United States. Perhaps the Monroe Doctrine through which the United States made it clear to the world that the American continent is off-limits to everyone except the United States serves as a cultural “birth certificate” for Latin Americans. To some extent, these arguments miss the salient points. First, there is definitely a need for a more inclusive book on Latino and Latina thought; this could not be it. More critically, with or without official treaties, this is ultimately a question of justice and human rights not nationalities or historical origins. The fact is that the global economy is forcing people all over the world to migrate, legally or illegally, to countries where there is a concentration of production and wealth, and these immigrants are claiming equal rights with the citizens of the host nations (see Robinson in Part V).\n\nxx\n\nIntroduction\n\nUnfortunately, although most people welcome world trade, they do not want to extend rights to the immigrants that this trade produces.7\n\nDefining Latinos and Latinas in the United States The reasons why Latinas and Latinos have taken the center stage in the politics of the United States vary from the issue of illegal and legal immigration to the increasing globalization of the economy and its effects on the working class in the United States and promoting illegal immigration and the massive protest marches in 2006 and 2007 to questions of homeland security and even threats to the identity of the United States. Historically, these people (especially Mexicans) have proven to be the most useful (and thus the favorite) tool for politicians and demagogues. Although this is exactly what is going on today, the difference from before is the demographic presence, the sheer numbers, and the exponential growth of the Latina and Latino population and their increasingly ubiquitous presence throughout the country. To round off the numbers, cited previously, including the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico there are almost 50 million Latinos and Latinas, and they are projected to grow to 102.6 million by 2050. This means the United States has the third largest Hispanic-origin population in the world (after Mexico and Colombia).8 In the United States, the breakdown by national origin is as follows: 64% Mexican, 9% Puerto Rican, 3.5% Cuban, 3% Salvadoran, and 2.7% Dominican. The remainder is from Central America, South America, or other Hispanic or Latino origin. Although almost half of them live in the Southwest of the United States (48% live in California (13.1 million) or Texas (8.4 million), Latinos and Latinas are spread out throughout the country. For example, there are fifteen states with at least half a million Latinos and Latinas (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington). In the same vein, there are twenty-two states in which they are the larges minority group (Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wyoming). In Los Angeles County, this population is the largest of any county in the nation (4.7 million). A population of this size also has a big economic impact. The revenue generated by Hispanic-owned businesses in 2002 was $222 billion, up 19 percent from 1997. Mexicans, Mexican Americans, and Chicanos own almost half (45 percent) of all Hispanic-owned firms. In this, too, there is a wide geographical diversity. The states with the fastest rates of growth for Hispanic-owned firms\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxi\n\nbetween 1997 and 2002 included New York (57 percent), Georgia and Rhode Island (56 percent each), and Nevada and South Carolina (48 percent each). It is often said that the Latino and Latina culture is family oriented. In effect, the statistics do support the notion that Latinos and Latinas have stable families: 67 percent of these family households consist of married couples. And 66 percent of these children live with two married parents. It is crucial, however, to understand that this is not because of some intrinsic Latina or Latino cultural essence. Simply put, family orientation depends on material conditions that support a traditional culture, one that is characterized by a hierarchy that tends to be patriarchal and authoritarian. But this is true of any traditional culture anywhere in the world (including the Amish and Mormons in the United States). Modern cultures, on the other hand, are characterized by the freedom of individuals to make their own decisions, and they, too, can be found anywhere in the world. Research shows that, as some members of the second generation adapt to the modern aspects of U.S. culture, they break away from hierarchical and authoritarian structures, and thus acquire the same social characteristics of the general population. This is not always to their benefit but that is another story. The one statistic that is a source of both hope and alarm, depending on your political orientation, is that in 2006 the median age of the Latino and Latina population is 27.4 years, compared to 36.4 for the population as a whole. When projected toward the rest of the twenty-first century, many questions arise regarding the role of this young population in the economy and the culture of the United States. A similar contentious issue is the Spanish language. There are 32.2 million U.S. household residents ages 5 and older, who speak Spanish at home; that is nearly one in eight U.S. household residents. What is often left out of the debate, however, is that, among all those who speak Spanish at home, more than one-half say the speak English well. What are the social conditions of these human bodies as of 2005? Their median income is $35,967; the poverty rate is 21.8 percent; and 32.7 percent lack health insurance. All these statistics are the same as the previous year. This situation is, of course, connected to educational levels. Focusing on the Latina and Latino population that is 25 years and older in 2006, 59 percent of them had at least a high school education, whereas 12 percent had a bachelor degree or higher. There is a difference between Cubans and other Latino and Latina groups that, again, should be attributed to material conditions and not some intrinsic cultural essence. Among the same age group (25 and older), 73 percent of Cuban Americans were at least high school graduates, and 24 percent had a bachelor’s degree or higher (almost doubled). Educational levels naturally impact the employment statistics. Note for example\n\nxxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nthat although 68 percent of Latinos and Latinas 16 and older are part of the civilian labor force, only 17 percent of the same age population work in management, professional, and related occupations. The remaining 83 percent tend toward the lower level jobs: 24 percent in service occupations; 22 percent in sales and office occupations; 2 percent in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations; 16 percent in construction, extraction, maintenance and repair occupations; and 19 percent in production, transportation, and material moving occupations. Civic engagement through voting was discussed previously, but another form of contribution to one’s society is through military service. As of 2005, there are 1.1 million Latinas and Latinos in the U.S. armed forces. The distinguished record of their participation is often ignored, not only in the debates about the role of Latinos and Latinas in the United States, but it is also often left out of war documentaries and films (such as the recent brouhaha over the exclusion of Latino and Latina veterans from Ken Burns film’s on World War II). Although an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 American Latinos fought in World War II, their contribution is virtually unknown to the U.S. public. Thus, it needs to be emphasized here: During World War II, in proportion to their percentage of the population, more Mexican Americans served in combat divisions than any other ethnic group; in the Allied invasion of the European mainland, they died in battle at a rate out of proportion to their numbers.9 Mario Barrera’s documentary, Latino Stories of World War II is the first to tell the stories, in their own words, of four veterans who served in the Air Force, the Army, and the Marines. The 1960 movie Hell to Eternity describes the exploits of one of them, Guy Gabaldon, although the movie did not mention he was a Latino.10 The same commitment is evident today: From 1992 to 2001, although the overall strength of the military dropped by 23 percent from 1,775,000 to 1,369,000, the number of Hispanics in uniform grew by a staggering 30 percent from 90,600 to 118,000.11 Clearly, Latinos and Latinas have paid their dues. Why do they feel as if they do not belong? Probably because their bodies continue to be abused: Parents of undocumented soldiers killed in Iraq are deported12; families are being separated by immigration raids (with children being especially impacted).13 Even candidates for the U.S. 2008 presidential election do not show respect for Latinas and Latinos.14\n\nFrom the Melting Pot to the Cosmic Race What is in a name? One often hears the remark, “I just don’t know whether to call them Hispanics or Latinos or Chicanos. How can I make sure what is\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxiii\n\nthe correct word?” It could even be argued that the mantle of invisibility covering Latinas and Latinos could be attributed to their sheer diversity of nationalities, races, ethnic groups, and religions. This reality has to do more with the nature of power relations. In other words, people who struggle to carve a place in U.S. society necessarily adopt a variety of tactics and strategies to win their rightful place. Moreover, this variety brings along a plethora of names. Once they have arrived, then the names stabilized. Thus, when we consider the U.S. Italian, Irish, and German populations, for example, each of these groups, have in due time become accepted as “real” Americans. They do not need their own ethnic studies at the university. For some people, however, the struggle continues, and the names keep on changing along with their tactics and strategies. Often the names overlap. Thus, there is a Negro College Fund, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Black Panthers, Black, and now African American studies. Similarly, there is the League of United Latin American Citizens, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the National Council for La Raza, and the Mexican American Legal and Educational Fund. There is also a variety of names for specific groups of individuals: Hispanics, Latinos and Latinas, La Raza, Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans and Nuyoricans, Mexicans, Mexican Americans, Spanish Americans, Chicana, Indio, Tex Mex, manita, cholo, pocha, etc. Each name represents an assertion of dignity, of human worth, and a struggle for respect. Within each group, there are also names that refer to how dark the skin may be (güero/a, trigueño/a, moreno/a, prieto/a, negro/a) or to hair texture (pelo liso or pelo quebrado—straight or wavy hair).15 There are two sides to these names. On the one hand, they are part of what is here called pigmentocracy, meaning a hierarchy based on the color of skin, with light skin being superior and which is apparent in Latin American popular and folk customs, and mass media and among Latinos and Latinas in the United States. In short, this is a form of unspoken, latent racism. On the other hand, as Octavio Romano has pointed out, Latinos and Latinas are the only group in the United States that proclaims its mestizaje (its mixture of races, its hibridity). Indeed, Latinos and Latinas can be from any race or ethnic group. This complexity was evident in the 2000 census, in which Latinos were asked to claim a particular racial origin. “Some of the nation’s 35 million Latinos scribbled in the margins that they were Aztec or Mayan. A fraction said they were Indian. Nearly 48% described themselves as white, and 2% as black. Fully 42% said they were ‘some other race.’”16 Latin America and the Caribbean have in some ways realized the U.S. American dream of a melting pot; although the Mexican philosopher José\n\nxxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nVasconcelos used a different metaphor for it, he called it La Raza Cósmica (The Cosmic Race). This means, incidentally, that La raza is, by definition, an inclusive, not an exclusionary term. The term mestizaje is increasingly gaining a great deal of currency. In Part II of this book, for example, Valle and Torres, analyze an emerging political and cultural mestizaje in Los Angeles, which is the practice, among the working class Latinos and Latinas to reach out across rigid cultural and political boundaries and form coalitions with other ethnic groups in a common quest for economic democracy. In his public talks, the writer Richard Rodriguez often makes reference to Anglo teenagers dating Mexicans and how most children in California do not look like their grandparents. The latest comprehensive salvo, however, comes from the book Mongrels, Bastards, Orphans and Vagabonds: Mexican Immigration and the Future of Race in America in which the author Gregory Rodriguez (no relation to Richard) argues that, Mexican Americans are forcing the United States to reinterpret the concept of a melting pot to include racial as well as ethnic mixing . . . Just as the emergence of the mestizos undermined the Spanish racial system in colonial Mexico, Mexicans Americans, who have always confounded the Anglo American racial system, will ultimately destroy it too.17\n\nClearly, in addition to all the contributions Latinos and Latinas have made to the United States, there is still much for them to do in the area of racial understanding. So, what do I call you? What do you consider yourself? This line of questioning brings to mind the book Around the Day in Eighty Worlds by Julio Cortázar, so one possible answer is, “It depends on what time it is.” To indicate that this is not a joke, one can then state that just like in Einstein’s theory of relativity “up” or “down” can only be defined in relation to something else. In the same way, each one of the terms applied to Latinos and Latinas needs to be defined in reference to a specific social class, ethnic group, region, political consciousness, or level of acculturation. The point is that we need to be clear what serves as the referent. Thus, if one belongs to several organizations like the ones previously mentioned, one can literally assume, or be perceived as having, like Cortázar, several identities in one day. Let us now extend this idea of “relation to referent” to one of the most common complaints about Mexicans in the United States, namely that they do not learn the language and that they do not become Americans like other immigrants. People who say or believe this are suffering from an optical illusion. In other words, as a result of the geographical fact that Mexico is right next to the United States, and people constantly migrate, it is natural that\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxv\n\nit takes them a while to learn the language and become acculturated. During that particular time, it is indeed true that they do not speak English and do not know “the American ways.” Eventually, though, they do become part of the mainstream. But when they do, and here is the clincher: They are no longer perceived as being “Mexican.” In fact, some Mexicans over time lose their Spanish language and become so thoroughly assimilated that they do not even think of themselves as Mexican. The problem is that the term Mexican does not have as a referent all the Mexicans who have come (or were already here) and have joined mainstream society. The referent is restricted to the recent arrivals. In other words, in the public and the media’s eye, the Mexicans are always and only those who just arrived. The important point is that identities, and the terms we use to designate them, are mere social constructions. They are not essences imbedded in the genes or tattooed on the flesh. To conclude this discussion of identity, for those who wonder if it is possible to know in advance what to call a particular Latina or Latino. The short answer is: “No, it is not possible. You have to get to know them first.” It is possible, however, to learn what some of the most used terms mean and to what they refer. Many of the following terms are used in the readings, and the definitions not covered below are provided by the context of the texts or the framing pieces. Let us begin with the term American or americano. Depending on the time period, or the location it is applied both to Latin Americans and to Anglo Americans. Granted, it is part of the official name of the United States of America. Technically, of course, there is only one American continent and everyone who is born there is an American. The terms South, Central, and North American are figments of a political imagination; for example, Mexico is in North America but this term is also applied only to the United States. In view of these inconsistencies, in this book we refer to the population of the United States in general by the term U.S. American. When it is necessary to be more specific, we use the term Anglo American or white. Similarly, we use the term U.S. Mexican to refer to the Mexicans who reside in the United States and thus come under the jurisdiction of the U.S. government. When the context requires more specificity, we may use the terms Mexican American or Chicana/Chicano. The term Hispanic refers to Spain and the Spanish language and is preferred by the U.S. government and the conservative, light-skinned upper and upper-middle classes. This, however, would be like calling all English speakers (e.g., Indian and Australian) Brittanics and considering them a homogeneous group. More to the point, there are many indigenous people who do\n\nxxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nnot even speak Spanish and associate Spain with the genocidal invasion of their lands. Latino and Latina has its own historical problems (its origin dates back to the French intervention in Mexico), but it is a term in the Spanish language, and it has Latin America, not Spain as a referent; it tends to cut across class levels but is more prevalent among liberal groups. Mexican American and Spanish American (especially in New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona) are names used by people who have been well established in the United States for several generations and want to differentiate themselves from the recently arrived, poor Mexicans. The latter used to be called Chicanos, but this pejorative term became a badge of honor for the militant student movement of the late sixties and seventies. The meaning of Chicano includes a struggle for social change and pride in a heritage that includes indigenous, working class, and immigrant people. In U.S. popular culture and among scholars like Juan Gómez-Quiñonez and Rodolfo Acuña, the term Mexican is applied to Mexicans in the United States. In this book, U.S. Mexican is used to distinguish the latter from Mexicans from Mexico (the same goes for U.S. Latinos and Latinas to distinguish them from people from Latin America). Raza also encompasses all Latino/as, as in Raza Studies at San Francisco State University in California. The term has two sources: It is used colloquially to designate “lower” classes, “the rabble,” but, as noted previously, it is also derived from the philosophical concept of a cosmic (hybrid) race: La Raza Cósmica of José Vasconcelos. Cholo or chola is the modern term for pachuco or gang member, whereas pocho or pocha is a pejorative for a Mexican American who has supposedly “lost” her or his culture.\n\nA Synopsis of the Latino/Latina Story: What Do They Want or What Do We Want? In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the fight was between liberalism and the monarchies (such as the U.S. founding fathers and mothers against the British King, Latin American liberators against the Spanish King). The United States was the first nation to promote democracy in the New World (with its Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution). People in Latin America also yearned for democracy and looked to the U.S. Revolution (and the French Revolution) as models. A century later, with the notion that it was God’s will (Manifest Destiny) the United States promoted capitalism and imperialism. Through military intervention, it expanded first into northern Mexico and half a century later into Puerto Rico and Cuba. Nationalist Mexicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans fought against the United\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxvii\n\nStates in a variety of ways to defend their homeland and keep their sovereignty. The results: Mexicans lost half of their country in 1848; Puerto Ricans became a colony (a possession, also called Commonwealth) of the United States in 1898; and Cubans were allowed to keep their independence (as long as they allowed U.S. intervention) until Fidel Castro took over the government in 1959 and got rid of the U.S. presence. In the twentieth century, the struggle took the form of social revolutions (such as the Mexican in 1910 and the Russian in 1917). On one side, the struggle for civil and human rights for African-descent, indigenous, and Latino peoples and women, gays, and other marginalized peoples continued in each country in the world. On the other side, the fight that took center stage was the one between capitalist democracy and communist and socialist democracies. This war of ideologies also affected how Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans saw themselves in relation to the United States. Whereas some supported capitalism, others supported socialism. This struggle took place not only among countries (such as Russia and allies against United States and allies), but also within countries (such as the McCarthy era in the United States, or between allies of each camp in Korea, China, Cuba, Viet Nam, Nicaragua, Chile, etc.). At the beginning of the twenty-first century, there has been another shift. There is an increasing expansion of capitalism into the entire world and into most aspects of life to maximize profits and open new markets. Just as the whole planet becomes either a commodity or a labor market, and capital has gone transnational to look for cheap labor (outsourcing jobs), so are many workers forced to migrate to where the jobs are. Immigration, both legal and illegal, has become a world issue because workers look for the best opportunities and wages. Because many citizens of the industrialized countries have to compete with workers all over the world or have lost their jobs, now many of them have grown resentful of immigrants. The terrorist attacks on the United States and the resulting “War on Terror” has led to security measures that are, arguably, even in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The rights of the state are now becoming more important than the rights of the people. Consequently, although it does take that form in some historical periods, the struggle is not so much for a national or ethnic brand of Mexican American or Puerto Rican democracy as it is an all out war for the idea of democracy itself. In other words, it is not so much the clashes of Mexican Americans and Puerto Rican or Cuban independentistas against the United States government, as it is the struggle of all the people for an economic democracy based on human rights.\n\nxxviii\n\nIntroduction\n\nStructure of The Reader Clearly, we live in critical times and Latinos and Latinas are caught in a paradoxical and dangerous situation as a growing yet vulnerable minority in the United States. Consequently, it is critical to promote understanding by raising the level of discourse of, by, and for Latinos and Latinas in the United States. This book is a contribution to that goal. It presents one perspective on Latina and Latino thought and grounds it on a variety of texts by distinguished scholars. These texts are drawn from books representing a variety of academic disciplines combined with pieces from scholarly journals and pamphlets. An effort has been made to represent diverse voices and differences in political tone and orientation, or at least to point to the existence of opposing views and to include important pieces that are now out of print. Through its distinctive user-friendly design, this book goes beyond the usual anthology that collects a number of related articles and frames them with an introduction and conclusion. Think of it as a small book with chapter-long footnotes, as it were. Here, for example, to provide a historical or political context for the readers, each section and each chapter has an initial introduction with endnotes that serve as reference for further research. Secondly, after each chapter there is a set of essay-type questions that challenge the reader to go beyond the text, to reflect on the topic, and also to elaborate on a particular line of thought, or to think of alternatives that may contradict the author (or the reader!). Furthermore, the main ideas, concepts, theories, and events are cross-referenced through the framing pieces to indicate interconnections among Mexicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans or the various historical events. They are also highlighted in boldface and explained in a glossary. Finally, there is a guide for instructors with exercises for classroom use based on Why we love power but hate politics: An Introduction for Students and additional pedagogical suggestions for seminar discussions. In terms of chronology, the readings covers from the period of the wars of independence from Britain, France, and Spain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to the present, and one of them includes a chart illustrates the major national (Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, United States) and world events going to the conquest of the New World. In terms of theory and methodology, there are texts on liberalism and Marxism as examples of methods to deal with the question of power and a critique of these two from the perspective of discursive or power/knowledge analysis. Among the questions addressed by the reader regarding Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and Cuban in the United States are: (1) What political philosophies serve as a model for or are considered the origins of, contemporary\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxix\n\nMexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban political thought? (2) What is the nature of power, and why is it so difficulty to achieve justice for all? (3) What differentiates Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and Cubans in the United States from each other? (4) Do Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and U.S. Cubans see themselves as part of the United States political framework or do they support a separatist position? (5) What are the most important issues for Mexican, Puerto Rican, and U.S. Cubans? (6) What are their visions and strategies political action in the twenty-first-century United States? and (7) How do these three groups address current issues such as racism, the globalization of the economy, immigration, gender, class relations, and relations with other ethnic groups?\n\nNotes and Suggestions for Further Research 1. Paul Taylor and Richard Fry, Hispanics and the 2008 Election: A Swing Vote? (Washington, DC: Pew Hispanic Center, December, 2007). 2. Juan Gonzalez, Harvest of Empire (New York: Viking, 2000), 168. 3. As part of the voto castigo or punishment vote for the affair regarding the little boy Elian Gonzalez who was sent back to Cuba to his father. 4. Taylor and Fry, Hispanics and the 2008 Election. According to this survey of Latino registered voters, the gains that the Republican Party had been making since this last election in partisan affiliation among Latinos have dissipated in the past year. The Democratic-over-Republican partisan affiliation edge (identifiers and leaners included), which had been 33 percentage points in 1999, then fell to 21 percentage points by 2006, is now back up to 34 percentage points. Though their electoral clout continues to be undercut by the fact that many are ineligible to vote, either because they are not citizens or not yet 18 years old, Latinos will comprise about 9 percent of the eligible electorate nationwide in 2008. If past turnout trends persist, they will make up only about 6.5 percent of those who actually turn out to vote in November. 5. The latest report on this is by the Pew Hispanic Center 2007 National Survey of Latinos, “As Illegal Immigration Issue Heats Up, Hispanics Feel A Chill,” (Washington, DC, December 2007). There is also William V. Flores and Rina Benmayor, eds., Latino Cultural Citizenship: Claiming Identity, Space and Rights (Boston: Beacon, 1997). However, as Raymund Paredes has shown in “The Origins of Anti-Mexican Sentiment in the United States” (in eds. R. Romo and R. Paredes, New Directions in Chicano Scholarship, Chicano Studies Monograph Series [San Diego: University of California, 1978]), Latino and Anglo American relations are part of an epic discourse going back at least four centuries to the “Black Legend,” or the defeat of the invisible Armada. In 1900, José Enrique Rodó, referring to Shakespeare’s “The Tempest,” claimed that whereas Latinos/as are imbued with the aesthetic sensibilities characteristic of the spirit of Ariel, U.S. Anglo Saxons covet materialism because they are possessed by the spirit of Calibán (Rodó, Ariel, trans. Margaret Sayers Peden [Austin: University of Texas Press, 1988]). For a\n\nxxx\n\nIntroduction\n\ncritical perspective, see Roberto Fernández Retamar, Caliban and Other Essays, trans. Edward Baker (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1989). Arielismo became a literary and political movement that is said to have spawned revolutionaries such as Victor Raul Haya de la Torre, and through his American Revolutionary Popular Alliance, Fidel Castro (Martin Staab, In Quest of Identity [Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1967]). Nobel Prize winner Octavio Paz says these two peoples, Latinos and Anglos, are the product of two different civilizations and are so essentially different that even economic equality cannot bridge their dissimilarities (The Labyrinth of Solitude and the Other Mexico, Return to the Labyrinth of Solitude, Mexico and the United States, The Philanthropic Ogre [New York: Grove Press, 1985]). Within the United States, some complain that Latinos crossed the border illegally; others retort that the border crossed them. Social scientists observe that Latinos/as will eventually become assimilated like all other ethnic groups have in the past, whereas politicians argue that Latinos/as threaten to become another Quebec and complain about a “chromosomatic invasion.” 6.

The readings focus on Mexicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans in the United States. The lessons derived from the readings, however, apply to the struggles of all ethnic groups and genders within the United States and all over the world. This is because a theme that is weaved throughout the readings is the relationship between power and knowledge and how this relation affects the quest for democracy and social justice. Furthermore, this book is written primarily for students, and consequently, it attempts to correlate the academic and the personal levels. The purpose of this introduction is to familiarize students with the main concepts that guide the discussions in the framing or introductory pieces or the texts, and secondly, to increase the students’ awareness of the relationship between the subject of Latino/a thought and their own personal interests. Thus, it is written in a question/answer format that explores the personal dimension of politics, learning, and power in relation to language and knowledge.\n\nBasic Assumptions First of all, like all teachers, this text makes the assumption that you, the reader, the student, is interested in the subject of Latinos and Latinas in the United States. That you are curious about politics, the concept of power and how they relate to your education, and that you are willing to delve into the readings, wrestle with sometimes difficult and obscure language and force it to yield the hidden meanings, codes, and secrets of power.\n\nxxxi\n\nxxxii\n\nWhy We Love Power but Hate Politics\n\nStudent Challenges In reality, however, when a student is confronted with a reader on Latino/a political thought, there is a set of frequently asked questions that the students may not raise in class but may think to themselves or share with their classmates: I hate politics! What will I learn? How true is this? Whose side of the story is this? Is this one of those books on how Latinos/as have been victimized by the dominant group? These are legitimate questions that need to be addressed, first briefly and then more extensively. “Why Should I Care? I Hate Politics!” According to a famous phrase by Aristotle, humans are political animals. This means there is a political dimension to almost everything we do, collectively or individually, whether we mean it as political or not. Another way of putting it is that every action is subject to interpretation and every interpretation has political implications and consequences “What Will I Learn?” In this text, you learn about the political history of Latinos/as in the United States and their struggles for respect and for justice. At the same time, however, you learn about the quest for democracy in general. This is important because the political economic system you choose to live in affects not only your future career but your well-being in general and that of your loved ones. Consequently, in this introduction (and expectedly, throughout the text), you may discover ways to understand yourself in terms of the relationship between power and knowledge, to increase your understanding of the politics of education, and to increase your critical thinking and learning strategies. In short, we invite you to play games of truth and power that shape your own identity and to make a map to navigate your own political reality. “How ‘True’ Is This Representation of Latino/a Political Thought?” What “truth” is and how it is involved with politics is one of the main concerns of this reader. Although we try to present a variety of ways to look at truth, it is left up to you to decide on your own what truth is based on the evidence presented in this reader and elsewhere. “Whose Side of the Story Is This? Is This Another Book on How Latinos/as Have Been Victimized by the Dominant Group?” The text contains a variety of positions and voices. However, the quest for democracy, for social justice, inevitably includes victims and victimizers and\n\nWhy We Love Power but Hate Politics\n\nxxxiii\n\nsocial systems that oppress and liberate. Who is the hero and who is the fool may change over time and ultimately depends, again, on your own perspective and your own interpretation of what truth is. That does not mean there is no truth with a capital T, but it does mean that the way to see it is through our own individual perspectives or truths with a small t. The closest that we can probably get to an ultimate, objective truth is by looking at the impact on the human body and the ecology that supports it. To be sure, this is not an argument for moral relativism, meaning that there is no one truth. It means that you have to make your own decisions based on evidence that supports solid arguments. (The nature of truth and power is discussed more thoroughly in chapter 4.) “What Is Politics, Anyway?” When I was in elementary school in Mexico, my mother would admonish me: “No te metas a la política. No andes juzgando, criticando ni alegando.” (Don’t get involved in politics. Don’t go around judging, criticizing, or arguing.) I knew what she meant; she wanted to protect me from a particular kind of politics. Student politics in Mexico, as in many countries, can be deadly. When I visited Guadalajara after many years in the United States, I was sad to find that some of my childhood friends had been killed in junior high school and high school during political confrontations. Through my living and schooling experiences in the United States, however, I soon realized that everyone is political in one way or another; to be alive and even to die is to be political. I learned, furthermore, that judgment, criticism, and argument are the necessary tools for successful political involvement. Politics can be defined in many ways. Let us dig deep to find the kind of politics that affects us in a personal way. When you look up politics in a dictionary or encyclopedia, it is likely that you will find the following definitions: 1. The art or science of government or governing, especially the governing of a political entity, such as a nation, and the administration and control of its internal and external affairs. Here politics means the knowledge that would help you govern the United States, Aztlán, Puerto Rico, or Cuba, if ever you were to find yourself in that situation. If you were to study and teach politics, the academic discipline is called political science. 2. Within a country, what a government (federal, state, local), a politician, or a political party does is also politics.\n\nxxxiv\n\nWhy We Love Power but Hate Politics\n\n3. An individual can also be “into politics” in the sense that she or he dedicates her or his life or makes a career out of politics. 4. Intrigue or maneuvering within a political unit or a group to gain control or power. This could be as passionate as office politics or student government, as fervent as Republican or Democratic or ethnic politics, or as zealous and dangerous as fighting to the death to defend your territory, your family, and your dignity. Control of a street gang or high school cliques like the in-crowd or the so-called “populars” in high school also fits into this definition of politics. 5. and 6. The last of the definitions refers to the hidden sort of politics that most of us take for granted: “political attitudes and positions” and “the often internally conflicting interrelationships among people in a society.”1 Indeed, the psychologist R. D. Laing has written books on the Politics of the Family and the Politics of Experience. In Spanish, there are terms like tio político (literally a political uncle who is not related by blood but by marriage, corresponding to the English usage of in-law). The point is that even if you hate politics, you are involved in them. The obvious implication is that whether you are conscious of it or not, you have a political attitude and you take political positions. Even refusing to take a position is a political position! Within the political spectrum you may be in the center (a centrist), on the right (conservative), or left or leftist (liberal, socialist, or anarchist) and not even know it! In this context, it is pertinent to note that during the 1960s, to the extent that Chicano and Puerto Rican youth became “politicized” by joining the Brown Berets or the Young Lords, gang membership dropped. We need to question why the personal dimension of politics is the last one in the list of definitions. This dimension reflects the attitude that leads people to say they hate politics. This is a disempowering notion. It is part of the illusion that politics is just something that politicians do, not what we the people do. This gives a sort of invisibility to the politics in our everyday life and to our role as political animals. And yet at the same time, we profess that we have “a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.” “What Is the Difference between Politics and Policies?” There is one incident that brought politics to its most fundamental level for me. I was once in a hotel in Mexico where the manager told me they had a\n\nWhy We Love Power but Hate Politics\n\nxxxv\n\npolítica on cashing checks. It struck me as odd: what does cashing checks have to do with politics? To my surprise, I found that in Spanish política means both politics and policy. Indeed, policy is such a close relative of politics that is first defined by dictionaries as “a plan or course of action, as of a government, political party, or business, intended to influence and determine decisions, actions, and other matters,” such as “U.S. foreign policy in Mexico” or “the company’s personnel policy.” As with politics, it is defined secondarily at the personal level as “a course of action, guiding principle, or procedure considered expedient, prudent, or advantageous.” Examples are in comments we hear in everyday conversation: “my policy is not to borrow money from friends” or “my personal policy is not to date my friend’s girl/boy friend.” So the policy in your university for paying tuition and the clothing store policy for returns are, at some level, politics. When you do not like these policies and you want to change them, you are involved in political action. So, you go talk to the head of the department or manager and tell him you want such and such policy changed—but is that all it takes? How do we use language to change our political realities? To become acquainted with your political self, you may want to reflect on the following questions: What are the key events of your “political” life as previously discussed? What are your political views? How have your parents, family, or ancestors influenced them? It is critical then to envision politics as building from the bottom up, from the political relationship you have with yourself (how you govern your identity, your persona), with your parents, with relatives, with friends, with lovers, and with institutions like school, business, the courts, and the police. Then, at higher levels, there are political relations among individuals, and among groups and the relations between the people and the state. By “state” we do not mean California or another state in the United States, we mean one of the most complex political machines humans have ever built, next to corporations, and in another time, the church. In short, politics is the way we manage the relationship between power and language and power and knowledge at the many levels of economic, social, and cultural existence. Such awareness is important not only for you to understand Latino/a political thought, but also for you to make sense of the world around you and for your own personal development.2 “What Is the Relationship between Language and Power?” There is a Mexican saying: a las palabras se las lleva el viento (words are carried away by the wind). An equivalent in English might be “actions speak louder than words”; the implication is that words are just words, meaning\n\nxxxvi\n\nWhy We Love Power but Hate Politics\n\nthat they do not carry any weight. In addition to confronting the possibility that you may be political without even knowing it, we invite you to explore the possibility that language is something solid that resists your attempts to shape it they way you want. Here we discuss the nature of language, the intimate relationship between language and power, between what is said and the economic or political institutional that governs our lives. (This is explored in depth in chapter 4.) The Nature of Language A main misunderstanding of the relationship between language and power seems to arise because we tend to think of language and words as transparent things, as objects that obey our commands, as entities that carry our intentions and our thoughts without distorting them. We become frustrated when words do not do the job we tell them to do. That is because words have their own baggage, their own meanings. They are material, solid things, like mountains and oceans and deserts. We would not claim to be able to move a mountain with our bare hands, and yet we firmly believe that we can say anything we want. We believe words come from us, when in fact we were born into them. Often when I go over an essay with a student I point out that her or his paper says X, and the student responds, “That’s not what I meant!” So who speaks? Language apparently distorts what my students meant to say in their papers. Similarly, when you read texts, some of them are fluid like water and you can “breeze” through them, others are like thick mud and you can barely make your way through them. This “materiality” turns words, statements, discourse, into commodities of exchange, within a sort of political economy of language. Think of market of statements that have different values and that can be bought and sold. Even more drastically, discourse can be like a minefield. Words can explode into contradictory meanings with potentially disastrous results. For example, you might have heard the statement: “if only people knew about it, something would be done and things would change.” To illustrate the problem with this assumption, let us briefly refer here to a dramatic story that is discussed at length in chapter 4. On April 13, 1972, Ricardo Chávez Ortiz, a Mexican national, hijacked a Frontier Airlines 737 jet from Albuquerque, New Mexico, with an unloaded gun. The plane landed in Los Angeles, where he asked not for money but for radio time to talk about the unjust treatment of Mexicans, hoping that spreading such knowledge would bring about social change. He got the airtime but, as you might imagine, no major change occurred in the life of Mexicans in the United States. He paid with federal prison time for the right to speak to power.3 This is a big price to pay for misunderstanding the nature of language!\n\nWhy We Love Power but Hate Politics\n\nxxxvii\n\nThis misconception about the way language is, unfortunately, rather widespread and it affects our everyday lives, our notions of reality, of history, and of our own sense of identity. Language hides things at the same time that it reveals them. Yet, we take the inherent power of language for granted when we should be establishing a vigilant, careful relationship with it. Thus, you need to do more than just read a text, you need to “decode” a text. To do that you need to think vertically, in depth, and to dig for the relations that tend to remain invisible under the horizontal surface of language. Why Are Some Voices Heard and Not Others? Let us explore in more detail how the relationship between power and language works. Imagine the voices of the people in any given community, in any social group. Some of these voices are just that, voices that are “carried away by the wind.” Other voices do have an impact on desire, politics, or economics, and that is because they intersect with power relations. How do we know they have an impact? Because of the reaction these voices provoke. At a personal level there are voices you hear, remember, and repeat in your mind over and over again. What is it about some things that are said that affect you so much while others you forget almost immediately? At a social level, depending on the status, the position of who speaks, the voice(s) may be categorized as political, scientific, artistic, funny, or worth repeating, or they may be considered stupid, unworthy, or “fighting words.” Social class, culture, gender, skin color, and an almost infinite number of other factors come into play to define the position of the speaker. This is another example of how words acquire (or not) specific values within a system of exchange, just like other commodities. Why are some voices heard and not others? Although Chávez Ortiz was not really heard, even by hijacking a plane, other voices become solidified; they acquire a high value, a certain materiality; they seem to be carved in stone. Laws and policies, for example, represent one of the most concrete and powerful realities that impact our everyday lives. They are made up of words that, if necessary, are enforced by economic and military force. On the one hand, although the ideal is that no one is above the law and that “all humans are created equal,” the reality is that there are individuals whose voices have immediate access to the White House or the U.S. Congress or the Supreme Court and can manipulate laws and policies almost at will. Or as the popular Mexican song “El Rey” (The King) puts it: mi palabra es la ley (my word is the law). On the other hand, other voices are silenced. There are bodies and events that are rendered invisible because they do not fit into any of the socially\n\nxxxviii\n\nWhy We Love Power but Hate Politics\n\naccepted categories of what can be said (the dominant political, economic, and desire discourses). Sure we know the poor and the homeless are invisible in some ways. But even when people have lots of knowledge, some of them find it difficult to translate that knowledge into power. Undocumented college students for example, are in fact invisible.4 Opening Up Spaces for Your Voice and the Voices of the Other All the aforementioned leads to the notion that the quest for democracy, the struggle for social justice and for dignity, is also the constant fight to open up spaces for voices to be heard and bodies to be seen. In May of 2006 and 2007, for example, through massive demonstrations, millions of legal and illegal immigrants in the United States tried to implant their own needs and desires into positions of authority, policies, and institutional procedures until the desired social changes take place. It is not, again, just a matter of speaking up, it is a question of investing our words with power. The key point is that this is not a battle on behalf of truth but a struggle about the status of truth and the political and economic roles it plays. Each interest at play in society tries to make their own truth appear as the Truth, regardless of what the actual facts may be. Clearly, these games of truth are not just an issue for Latinos/as, but for everyone who cares about a democracy that is based on the will of the people. In other words, we are always caught in a relationship with a body of knowledge that surrounds our intention (and sometimes imposes its own intention). Thus, we need to be aware of the potential impact of the following factors: (1) what we say, read, and write, (2) our status or identity (our gender, ethnicity, skin color, political views, social, educational and economic position), and (3) what the dominant institutions or the mass media say. In the final analysis, what does all this knowledge and learning mean for our own well-being and the good of society? “If ‘Knowledge Is Power,’ Does that Mean that ‘Power Is Knowledge?’” Thus far we have addressed two misunderstandings: that we hate politics and can do without it and that language is there for us to use anyway we want. A third misconception is about the relation between power and knowledge. It is common to hear people say that getting an education is important because knowledge is power. If this were true, presumably, every high school and college graduate would be powerful. Why is it that people rarely say the opposite, that “power is knowledge?” Just like we saw in the language and power relations, the relation between power and knowledge take many forms (discussed in detail in chapter 4). Let us focus here on how these relations be-\n\nWhy We Love Power but Hate Politics\n\nxxxix\n\ntween power and knowledge and how they are reflected by institutions of learning, pedagogy (the science or art of teaching) and how these theories and practices affect you as a lifelong learner and active citizen.\n\nThe Theory: Education for Domination or for Liberation The educational system categorizes students into established social categories like class, gender, and skin color. More than just categorize, we might say the educational system subjects (i.e., ties down) individuals to these particular identities. This is what is known as a process of subjectification, and as usual, there are economic, and political factors involved in it. For example, the socioeconomic level of a school district determines the curriculum and the academic performance of students. There is also a correlation between a lowincome area and a high percentage of school dropouts. As we shift from an industrial to a postindustrial global economy, most U.S. Americans no longer work in big factories. Most of the factories move to parts of the world where cheap labor is abundant. This means U.S. Americans have to compete with workers all over the world.5 Consequently, instead of working primarily in manufacturing, they do two main things: process information and provide services for other people. So your place in the economy and thus in the class structure determines, to a large extent, what kind of education you get and what position you will occupy in society. In addition to social class, race and gender enter into this process of subjectification. Of course, this does not mean that everyone’s destiny is determined by socioeconomic or racial factors. There is also individual determination or agency. This means that you are ultimately responsible for your own actions, and there are methods individuals use to struggle against this form of domination. Nevertheless, the answer to the question posed here seems to be that in these games of truth we all must play, knowledge is necessary but it is not sufficient for power. The process of subjectification was addressed by the distinguished pedagogue Paulo Freire in his book Pedagogy of the Oppressed. He notes that education can be for domination or for liberation.6 Education for domination operates on the basis of what he calls “the banking concept of education,” and it works this way: sit in the classroom and absorb everything the teacher “deposits” in you via the lecture format; faithfully repeat it in a test to get good grades. Clearly, through this method you will have the ability to regurgitate what you have been taught. It does not necessarily mean you will learn about your relationship with the world (and the power/knowledge relations we are discussing here). The key question is about teaching and learning in a way\n\nxl\n\nWhy We Love Power but Hate Politics\n\nthat fosters a close relationship between the individual student and the socioeconomic context of the world in which she or he lives. Are you just learning to pass the test or do you take yourself seriously as a learner? That is, are you just going through the motions pretending you are learning? Or are you aware of the relationship between what you learn (knowledge) and the issues that affect your personal and socioeconomic realities (power)? Incidentally, in this complex and paradoxical struggle for respect and justice, some students “fight back” against the domination they feel coming from schools by dropping out. Education for liberation or critical pedagogy, by contrast, is based on the transformation that occurs when learning takes place as a dialogue between the teacher and the student, and it leads to a transformation in both of their social outlooks. Or better yet, learning becomes a dialogue between the teacher and the student with the social world. This kind of learning you carry with you as part of yourself. The learning is not limited to schools but it is continued through your interactions in your everyday life such as during conversations with friends, family, and relatives, from your own experiences, or from movies and television. Critical pedagogy, like critical thinking leads you to care about your education because you understand how it can make a difference not only in your life but also in the world around you. One has to wonder about a democracy that depends on the expression of the will of the people, yet has an educational system that does not teach most of the people to feel validated, to express their own beliefs and opinions, and to practice critical thinking. A system that does teach these things would seem a requirement for any active citizen, especially one on a quest for democracy.\n\nThe Practice: Discussion Groups and “Knowing Thyself” Because education based on the “banking concept” teaches to rely on instructors, on experts, on those “with authority” to define the truth or what is important, there is little if any room for students to articulate their own ideas and opinions. This leads to three consequences among many college students: a lack of self-validation and the inability to encourage members of the discussion group to express their opinions; a lack of trust in the notion that they can learn from their peers; and an inability to listen carefully to what others have to say. Consequently, one way to approach education as liberation is through a student-centered method of teaching, such as the seminar or discussion group (see appendix). Another important component of education as liberation is critical thinking skills that are based on determining what your “voice” is. This means to\n\nWhy We Love Power but Hate Politics\n\nxli\n\nknow who you are, separate from the identities to which you are subjected (that have been assigned to or forced on you). Now, let us say that you are participating in a seminar to discuss this reader or other readings that have been selected by the group. How do you distinguish between what is important, and what is not important? How do you decide to take a position? How do you play this particular game of truth? When do you use inductive or deductive reasoning? Many students are swayed by the arguments in favor and then change their minds when they hear the argument against. But how do you begin to think critically? This is not the place to address this question in depth; there are many sources on this subject.7 Antonio Gramsci, however, provides a personal perspective: The starting-point of critical elaboration is the consciousness of what one really is, and is “knowing thyself” as a product of the historical process to date, which has deposited in you an infinity of traces, without leaving an inventory; therefore it is imperative at the outset to compile such an inventory.8\n\nThis means that to think critically you need to know who you are. In effect, from our experience, students who do not know themselves as “a product of the historical process to date” usually agree with everything and have a difficult time making up their minds about a particular issue. This difficulty also appears in their writing and in their participation in discussions. So, if it is crucial to know thyself,9 how do you begin to compile an inventory of the historical fragments that define who you are? Obviously for Latino/a students, especially of Cuban, Mexican, and Puerto Rican heritage, this reader is one place to start. For all students, however, the reader begins by providing charts and discussion from which you can begin to compile a historical inventory of who you are as a member of human society that has a quest for democracy. You may want to think of the ten key events, or stepping-stones, of your “educational life.” Or you may also write a dialogue with society (e.g., with your school principal or teacher). You may want to write a reflective essay on your educational experiences using Paulo Freire’s concepts of education: Have you been educated for domination or for liberation?\n\nBecoming Politically Involved Once you take responsibility for your own education and you know thyself, you can bring a special awareness and attention to the games of truth all of us must play. As you go through your everyday life you detect the workings of knowledge and power, the rules for the manipulation of discourse and the\n\nxlii\n\nWhy We Love Power but Hate Politics\n\neffect of power on human bodies and the ecology. You can recognize, assess, compare, analyze, and synthesize power relations. In short, you want to become politically involved. But there are so many issues and everything is so complex! How do you get started sorting things out? Here is a tip: When you buy a car you begin to notice, out of the millions of cars in the world, other cars that look like yours. Similarly, when you “buy” a particular pet issue, idea or theory, you also recognize its reflection in books, newspapers, television, movies, conversations, etc. This means that the first step, if you do not already have one, is to pick one issue, or area of interest. When you follow it, it will lead you to a body of knowledge and perhaps power that may be related to a particular profession. It may also enable you to earn a living doing something you enjoy doing. In a way, this brings us back to Aristotle’s observation that “we are political animals.” Think about the ideas of politics, language, knowledge/power, and education as they affect your everyday life. What does your political world look like and what role do you play in it? In an essay or drawing (in a poster-sized paper) you may want to illustrate your political realities; in other words, the many forces that affect you, and the ways you can affect them in return. “What Is the Best Way to Read the Articles in This Reader?” Continuing with the analogy of having a new car, as you read the articles it helps to know what you are looking for. You may have your own “pet idea or theory,” if not, the introductions to the sections and the articles will provide questions to keep in mind as you read them. Remember that language is as material as water and rocks and air, therefore, some of the articles are easier to read than others. So you may breeze through a poem like I Am Joaquín, but feel like you are stuck in mud when reading treaties or theoretical articles. Do not be discouraged. It is in the nature of power to hide behind language. The readings also differ in political tone and orientation. Read with a suspicious mind, suspend judgment, and do not take statements as given truths but as truths in a complex game of truths. An effort has been made to include different political perspectives or at least to point to the existence of opposing views. There is only one thing that you and only you can do (not even God has that power), and that is to think for yourself. Consequently, you must make up your mind about what you want to believe.\n\nNotes and Suggestions for Further Research 1.

Among the Greeks, the story goes that the Oracle of Delphi, who was like the voice of the gods, said that Socrates was the smartest man in Athens. Socrates did not believe it, so he went around trying to prove that there were others who knew more than he did. After a while Socrates realized that although there were others who knew more than he did, he knew the limits of his own knowledge and this made him smarter than anyone else! Over the entrance to the Oracle of Delphi’s abode were the words “Know thyself.”\n\nP A R T\n\nI\n\nORIGINS AND THEORIES\n\nP A R T\n\nI\n\nA\n\nA Dream of Justice: Contexts, Methods, and Practices in Latino/a Thought Francisco Hernández Vázquez\n\nLatino/a thought may be approached from diverse philosophical, historical, and political perspectives. As presented here, Latino/a political thought emerges out a struggle against absolute power. First, it was the American continental struggle against the monarchies, which was started by the English Americans, followed by the Haitians and then the rest of Spanish Americans. After the overthrow of the European crowns, there has been a continental quest for democracy, an effort to establish democratic societies that are governed by the people. Similarly, within the United States, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans have struggled in their own particular quest for equity and social justice along with other ethnic minorities. An important point driving this discussion is that despite current arguments to the contrary, this is what all people in the American continent have in common. The American Dream is a continental Americano Dream, not the exclusive dream of the Anglo Saxon Protestant, as retired Harvard professor Samuel P. Huntington claims (see chapters 4 and part V.B). Arguably, this is a human dream but that is another discussion.\n\nFrom the Nationalization of Philosophy to the Ethnicization of Social Science When the subject of Latina or Latino political thought comes up, many people, even in academia, tend to wonder if there is a unique Latino/a thought that is part of a Latino/a philosophy. Is there a Latin American philosophy 3\n\n4\n\nPart I: Origins and Theories\n\nwith its own philosophers and specific philosophies?1 Because one of the themes of this reader is the notion of invisibility that is created by power relations, it is not only pertinent but also necessary to make it perfectly clear: There is, in fact, a history of Latin American philosophy, a collection of the reflections on the same philosophical questions that have challenged philosophers throughout human history and across cultures and countries, namely, the meaning of life (ethics), identity and purpose (social philosophy), the nature of knowledge (epistemology), and reality (ontology). In effect, approximately from 1880 to 1960 there was a deliberate effort in Latin America (and in other non-European countries), to create a national philosophy, as part of the struggle against European and U.S. imperialism. For example, Gaos argues that, just like the Germans, French, British, and Americans have Idealism, Rationalism, Empiricism, and Pragmatism philosophies, respectively, the Spanish-speaking people have Emotivismo (Emotionism or a philosophy based on emotion).2 The name comes from the preference for the intuitive and for the aesthetic form to express its philosophical thought, such as the poem, the letter, the essay. Spanish-speaking philosophers have shown no inclination for developing grand, systematic political philosophies. Their focus has been on the immediate issues that impact their societies. In Mexico, Antonio Caso, Samuel Ramos, José Vasconcelos, and Octavio Paz, among others, are associated with la filosofía de lo mexicano (the philosophy of that which is Mexican). Not coincidentally, about the time that this project of nationalization of philosophy was abandoned, a similar project emerged in the United States with the ethnicization of the social sciences (Chicano sociology, anthropology, political science, etc.; see chapter 4 for a discussion of power and knowledge relations and the social sciences). Within Latin American political thought, one finds a wide historical and political spectrum. It ranges from scholasticism to Enlightenment. On the one hand, there are liberal democratic ideas such as those that led to Mexican independencia in 1821 and the Mexican Constitutions of 1854 and 1917 and the constitutions of Cuba in 1900 and Puerto Rico in 1950. On the other hand, one finds the conservative and racist ideas of the positivists, known as los científicos, in the nineteenth century and that is associated with U.S.backed militarist, reactionary, and elitist politics of the twentieth century. Marxism and Socialism continue to be predominant in Latin America. Liberation theology is a unique Latin American philosophy, a combination of Catholicism and Marxism. As for Latinos/as in the United States, three major Latin American philosophers, who have influenced Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans, and U.S. Mexicans are José Martí, Eugenio Maria de Hostos, and Ricardo Flores Magón, respectively.3\n\nA Dream of Justice\n\n5\n\nThe National Question: Nationalism and Transnationalism Words like nationalization, ethnicization, imperialism, and others that will appear in various texts as nation, nationality, nationalism, and colonial are essential for the understanding of Latino/a thought (and political thought in general) and thus require clarification from the outset. Imagine ancient history when the world was populated by hundreds of “nations,” that is, groups of people, clans, tribes, who share common customs, origins, histories, and languages. The word nation comes from the Latin natio, which means birth or race; from nasci, to be born; literally, “where you are born,” your home turf. In the Greek language, the word for nation is ethnos. Therefore, nations are equal to ethnic groups, equal to tribes, such as the Anglos, the Saxons (yes, they used to be two different tribes), the Franks, the Navajo, and the Maya. There is an implication here of blood ties, of one big family, like with the concept found in discussions of cultural nationalism: Puerto Ricans claim an ethno-nation and the rainbow familia; Chicanos claim carnalismo (literally flesh of my flesh); and there the ever present cubanidad). For white supremacists, like the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), it is the notion of the purity of the blood line. Whether real or imagined, blood ties among a people, lead to notions of justice and vengeance: such as avenging those who have shed the blood of a family member. The nation and the blood ties of its members are a central factor in present day conflicts all over the world, such as in the Middle East and in rural feuds and among urban gang members. When some nations reach a particular level of economic and technological development, they conquer and possess other nations to create a citystate or polis (as in political system) as the Greeks called it. The Maya kingdom and the Roman and British empires are other examples. When this happens, the nations that are conquered become colonies and they are said to have lost their sovereignty, that is, the right to self-determination, the right to make their own decisions; or they may become integrated into the dominant nation, the metro-polis (literally, the huge city-state). By the eighteenth century, the word nation started to be used in the sense of country or nation-state, that is, a state that contains other nations. England, for example, turned so many independent nations, into colonies, it was said that the sun never set on the British Empire. One positive aspect of empires is that they allowed for linguistic and cultural differences among their subjects (as long as they paid tribute). The United States, has also “incorporated” Northern Mexico, Puerto Rico (as a Commonwealth), and Guam, the Marianas, Samoa, and many Indian nations, such as the Navajo and the Apache and at\n\n6\n\nPart I: Origins and Theories\n\none time, the Philippines and Cuba. “The national question” is precisely the relation of domination exercised by one nation over another.4 Now, that the term state has been added to nation, let us define it. Think of the state as the invention of a political machine, a form of government that not only replaced the empires and monarchies in the seventeenth century, but also tends to homogenize and normalize populations through the imposition of one language and one culture. Another important characteristic is that the nation-state grants individual human bodies legal status through citizenship, it gives them a nationality. Thus, newspapers identify individuals as Mexican or Canadian nationals, which is another way of saying that they belong to those two particular nation-states. There is a crucial difference between nationality and nationalism, and it must be addressed to avoid confusion. Nationalism describes the feeling of patriotism, or extreme, perhaps even fanatical loyalty to a particular nation or nation-state. Thus, an indigenous person in the Americas may feel her or his first loyalty is to their nation-tribe, not to the Mexican or U.S. nation-state. There are examples all over the world in which particular nations are not happy being owned by nation-states, and they want to be independent from them. It is in this sense that we may speak of black, Chicano, Puerto Rican, and Cuban nationalism. There is, however, another kind of nationalism, like the one that arises in the United States in times of economic distress and leads many U.S. Americans (including blacks, Puerto Ricans, and Mexican Americans) to turn against those who fit the label of “foreigners,” or “immigrants” that is, those that do not belong to “the Nation.” This, too, is the horizon where the “national question” comes into focus. Thus, one is always a national (of one country) but one chooses to be a nationalist (that is, the degree of critical "
