        "text": "Superconducting Magnets for the 12 GeV Upgrade at Jefferson Lab\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFair, Ruben J.; Young, Glenn R.\n\n2015-06-01\n\nJefferson Laboratory is embarked on an energy upgrade to its flagship continuous electron beam accelerator in order to expand the scope of its research capabilities and probe further into the structure of nuclear particles. The 12 GeV upgrade includes the design, manufacture, integration, installation and commissioning of eight different superconducting magnets in three separate experimental halls. The effort involves other national laboratories, universities and industry spanning three countries. This paper will summarize the key characteristics of these magnets, ranging in size from 0.2 to 23 MJ in stored energy, and featuring many different types and configurations. The paper will alsomoreÂ Â» give an overview of the specific technical challenges for each magnet, and a status report on magnet manufacture and expected delivery dates. The 12GeV upgrade at J-Lab represents the largest superconducting magnet fabrication and installation program currently ongoing in the United States and this paper will present the breadth of collaborations supporting it.Â«Â less\n\nReal time capable infrared thermography for ASDEX Upgrade\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSieglin, B., E-mail: Bernhard.Sieglin@ipp.mpg.de; Faitsch, M.; Herrmann, A.\n\n2015-11-15\n\nInfrared (IR) thermography is widely used in fusion research to study power exhaust and incident heat load onto the plasma facing components. Due to the short pulse duration of todayâs fusion experiments, IR systems have mostly been designed for off-line data analysis. For future long pulse devices (e.g., Wendelstein 7-X, ITER), a real time evaluation of the target temperature and heat flux is mandatory. This paper shows the development of a real time capable IR system for ASDEX Upgrade. A compact IR camera has been designed incorporating the necessary magnetic and electric shielding for the detector, cooler assembly. The cameramoreÂ Â» communication is based on the Camera Link industry standard. The data acquisition hardware is based on National Instruments hardware, consisting of a PXIe chassis inside and a fibre optical connected industry computer outside the torus hall. Image processing and data evaluation are performed using real time LabVIEW.Â«Â less\n\nUpgraded photon calorimeter with integrating readout for Hall A Compton Polarimeter at Jefferson Lab\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nFriend, M.; Parno, D.; Benmokhtar, F.; ...\n\n2012-06-01\n\nThe photon arm of the Compton polarimeter in Hall A of Jefferson Lab has been upgraded to allow for electron beam polarization measurements with better than 1% accuracy. The data acquisition system (DAQ) now includes an integrating mode, which eliminates several systematic uncertainties inherent in the original counting-DAQ setup. The photon calorimeter has been replaced with a Ce-doped Gd 2SiO 5 crystal, which has a bright output and fast response, and works well for measurements using the new integrating method at electron beam energies from 1 to 6 GeV.\n\nFMEA on the superconducting torus for the Jefferson Lab 12 GeV accelerator upgrade\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nGhoshal, Probir K.; Biallas, George H.; Fair, Ruben J.; ...\n\n2015-01-16\n\nAs part of the Jefferson Lab 12GeV accelerator upgrade project, Hall B requires two conduction cooled superconducting magnets. One is a magnet system consisting of six superconducting trapezoidal racetrack-type coils assembled in a toroidal configuration and the second is an actively shielded solenoidal magnet system consisting of 5 coils. Both magnets are to be wound with Superconducting Super Collider-36 NbTi strand Rutherford cable soldered into a copper channel. This paper describes the various failure modes in torus magnet along with the failure modes that could be experienced by the torus and its interaction with the solenoid which is located inmoreÂ Â» close proximity.Â«Â less\n\nJefferson Lab 12 GEV Cebaf Upgrade\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRode, C. H.\n\n2010-04-01\n\nThe existing continuous electron beam accelerator facility (CEBAF) at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) is a 5-pass, recirculating cw electron Linac operating at Ë6 GeV and is devoted to basic research in nuclear physics. The 12 GeV CEBAF Upgrade is a 310 M project, sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Nuclear Physics, that will expand its research capabilities substantially by doubling the maximum energy and adding major new experimental apparatus. The project received construction approval in September 2008 and has started the major procurement process. The cryogenic aspects of the 12 GeV CEBAF Upgrade includes: doubling the accelerating voltages of the Linacs by adding ten new high-performance, superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cryomodules (CMs) to the existing 42 1/4 cryomodules; doubling of the 2 K cryogenics plant; and the addition of eight superconducting magnets.\n\nDetector development for Jefferson Lab's 12GeV Upgrade\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nQiang, Yi\n\n2015-05-01\n\nJefferson Lab will soon finish its highly anticipated 12 GeV Upgrade. With doubled maximum energy, Jefferson Labâs Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) will enable a new experimental program with substantial discovery potential, addressing important topics in nuclear, hadronic and electroweak physics. In order to take full advantage of the high energy, high luminosity beam, new detectors are being developed, designed and constructed to fit the needs of different physics topics. The paper will give an overview of various new detector technologies to be used for 12 GeV experiments. It will then focus on the development of two solenoid-based spectrometers,moreÂ Â» the GlueX and SoLID spectrometers. The GlueX experiment in Hall D will study the complex properties of gluons through exotic hybrid meson spectroscopy. The GlueX spectrometer, a hermetic detector package designed for spectroscopy and the associated partial wave analysis, is currently in the final stage of construction. Hall A, on the other hand, is developing the SoLID spectrometer to capture the 3D image of the nucleon from semi-inclusive processes and to study the intrinsic properties of quarks through mirror symmetry breaking. Such a spectrometer will have the capability to handle very high event rates while still maintaining a large acceptance in the forward region.Â«Â less\n\nAn Investigation into the Electromagnetic Interactions between a Superconducting Torus and Solenoid for the Jefferson Lab 12 GeV Upgrade\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRajput-Ghoshal, Renuka; Ghoshal, Probir K.; Fair, Ruben J.\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThe Jefferson Lab 12 GeV Upgrade in Hall B will need CLAS12 detector that requires two superconducting magnets. One is a magnet system consisting of six superconducting trapezoidal racetrack-type coils assembled in a Toroidal configuration (Torus) and the second is an actively shielded solenoidal magnet (Solenoid). Both the torus and solenoid are located in close proximity to one another and are surrounded by sensitive detectors. This paper investigates the electromagnetic interactions between the two systems during normal operation as well as during various fault scenarios as part of a Risk Assessment and Mitigation (RAM).\n\nImplementing Wireless Mobile Instructional Labs: Planning Issues and Case Study\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMcKimmy, Paul B.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nIn April 2002, the Technology Advisory Committee of the University of Hawaii-Manoa College of Education (COE) prioritized the upgrade of existing instructional computer labs. Following several weeks of research and discussion, a decision was made to support wireless and mobile technologies during the upgrade. In June 2002, the first of threeâ¦\n\nPhysics Opportunities with the 12 GeV Upgrade at Jefferson Lab\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDudek, Jozef; Essig, Rouven; Kumar, Krishna\n\n2012-08-01\n\nWe are at the dawn of a new era in the study of hadronic nuclear physics. The non-Abelian nature of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and the resulting strong coupling at low energies represent a significant challenge to nuclear and particle physicists. The last decade has seen the development of new theoretical and experimental tools to quantitatively study the nature of confinement and the structure of hadrons comprised of light quarks and gluons. Together these will allow both the spectrum and the structure of hadrons to be elucidated in unprecedented detail. Exotic mesons that result from excitation of the gluon field willmoreÂ Â» be explored. Multidimensional images of hadrons with great promise to reveal the dynamics of the key underlying degrees of freedom will be produced. In particular, these multidimensional distributions open a new window on the elusive spin content of the nucleon through observables that are directly related to the orbital angular momenta of quarks and gluons. Moreover, computational techniques in Lattice QCD now promise to provide insightful and quantitative predictions that can be meaningfully confronted with, and elucidated by, forthcoming experimental data. In addition, the development of extremely high intensity, highly polarized and extraordinarily stable beams of electrons provides innovative opportunities for probing (and extending) the Standard Model, both through parity violation studies and searches for new particles. Thus the 12 GeV upgrade of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jefferson Lab will enable a new experimental program with substantial discovery potential to address these and other important topics in nuclear, hadronic and electroweak physics.Â«Â less\n\nOverview of torus magnet coil production at Fermilab for the Jefferson Lab 12-GeV Hall B upgrade\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nKrave, S.; Velev, G.; Makarov, A.; ...\n\n2016-02-29\n\nFermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) fabricated the torus magnet coils for the 12-GeV Hall B upgrade at Jefferson Lab (JLab). The production consisted of six large superconducting coils for the magnet and two spare coils. The toroidal field coils are approximately 2 m Ã 4 m Ã 5 cm thick. Each of these coils consists of two layers, each of which has 117 turns of copper-stabilized superconducting cable, which will be conduction cooled by supercritical helium. Due to the size of the coils and their unique geometry, Fermilab designed and fabricated specialized tooling and, together with JLab, developed unique manufacturingmoreÂ Â» techniques for each stage of the coil construction. Furthermore, this paper describes the tooling and manufacturing techniques required to produce the six production coils and the two spare coils needed by the project.Â«Â less\n\nMethods for Upgrading an Intramural-Recreational Sports Program: An Agency Report.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNewman, Richard E.; Miller, Michael T.\n\nThis study assessed the state of intramural-recreational (IR) programs at Peru State College (Nebraska) and offered suggestions for the improvement of existing IR programs.

The upgrade of the VELO is planned to be installed in 2019-2020, and the current detector will be replaced by a hybrid pixel system equipped with electronics capable of reading out at a rate of 40 MHz. The new detector is designed to withstand the radiation dose expected at an integrated luminosity of 50 fb-1. The detector will be composed of silicon pixel sensors, read out by the VeloPix ASIC that is being developed based on the TimePix/MediPix family. The prototype sensors for the VELO upgrade are being irradiated in five different facilities and the post-irradiation performance is being measured with testbeams, and in the lab. These proceedings present the VELO upgrade and briefly discuss the results of the sensor testing campaign.\n\nSuperconducting Magnet Power Supply and Hard-Wired Quench Protection at Jefferson Lab for 12 GeV Upgrade\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGhoshal, Probir K.; Bachimanchi, Ramakrishna; Fair, Ruben J.\n\nThe superconducting magnet system in Hall B being designed and built as part of the Jefferson Lab 12 GeV upgrade requires powering two conduction cooled superconducting magnets - a torus and a solenoid. The torus magnet is designed to operate at 3770 A and solenoid at 2416 A. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) determined that voltage level thresholds and dump switch operation for magnet protection should be tested and analyzed before incorporation into the system. The designs of the quench protection and voltage tap sub-systems were driven by the requirement to use a primary hard-wired quench detection sub-system togethermoreÂ Â» with a secondary PLC-based protection. Parallel path voltage taps feed both the primary and secondary quench protection sub-systems. The PLC based secondary protection is deployed as a backup for the hard-wired quench detection sub-system and also acts directly on the dump switch. Here, we describe a series of tests and modifications carried out on the magnet power supply and quench protection system to ensure that the superconducting magnet is protected for all fault scenarios.Â«Â less\n\nSuperconducting Magnet Power Supply and Hard-Wired Quench Protection at Jefferson Lab for 12 GeV Upgrade\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nGhoshal, Probir K.; Bachimanchi, Ramakrishna; Fair, Ruben J.; ...\n\n2017-10-05\n\nThe superconducting magnet system in Hall B being designed and built as part of the Jefferson Lab 12 GeV upgrade requires powering two conduction cooled superconducting magnets - a torus and a solenoid.

Furthermore, this facility is presently being upgraded, which will enable a new experimental program with substantial discovery potential to address important topics in nuclear, hadronic, and electroweak physics. Further in the future, it is envisioned that the Laboratory will evolve into an electron-ion colliding beam facility.\n\nPulsed laser facilities operating from UV to IR at the Gas Laser Lab of the Lebedev Institute\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIonin, Andrei; Kholin, Igor; Vasil'Ev, Boris; Zvorykin, Vladimir\n\n2003-05-01\n\nPulsed laser facilities developed at the Gas Lasers Lab of the Lebedev Physics Institute and their applications for different laser-matter interactions are discussed. The lasers operating from UV to mid-IR spectral region are as follows: e-beam pumped KrF laser (Î»= 0.248 Î¼m) with output energy 100 J; e-beam sustained discharge CO2(10.6 Î¼m) and fundamental band CO (5-6 Î¼m) lasers with output energy up to ~1 kJ; overtone CO laser (2.5-4.2 Î¼m) with output energy ~ 50 J and N2O laser (10.9 Î¼m) with output energy of 100 J; optically pumped NH3 laser (11-14 Î¼m). Special attention is paid to an e-beam sustained discharge Ar-Xe laser (1.73 Î¼m ~ 100 J) as a potential candidate for a laser-propulsion facility. The high energy laser facilities are used for interaction of laser radiation with polymer materials, metals, graphite, rocks, etc.\n\nAdvanced Ground Systems Maintenance Cryogenics Test Lab Control System Upgrade Project\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHarp, Janice Leshay\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis project will outfit the Simulated Propellant Loading System (SPLS) at KSC's Cryogenics Test Laboratory with a new programmable logic control system.

VISIR is the mid-infrared imager and spectrograph at ESO's VLT. The project team is comprised of ESO staff and members of the original VISIR consortium: CEA Saclay and ASTRON. The project plan is based on input from the ESO user community with the goal of enhancing the scientific performance and efficiency of VISIR by a combination of measures: installation of improved hardware, optimization of instrument operations and software support. The cornerstone of the upgrade is the 1k by 1k Si:As Aquarius detector array (Raytheon) which has demonstrated very good performance (sensitivity, stability) in the laboratory IR detector test facility (modified TIMMI 2 instrument). A prism spectroscopic mode will cover the N-band in a single observation. New scientific capabilities for high resolution and high-contrast imaging will be offered by sub-aperture mask (SAM) and phase-mask coronagraphic (4QPM/AGPM) modes. In order to make optimal use of favourable atmospheric conditions a water vapour monitor has been deployed on Paranal, allowing for real-time decisions and the introduction of a userdefined constraint on water vapour. Improved pipelines based on the ESO Reflex concept will provide better support to astronomers. The upgraded VISIR will be a powerful instrument providing background limited performance for diffraction-limited observations at an 8-m telescope. It will offer synergy with facilities such as ALMA, JWST, VLTI and SOFIA, while a wealth of targets is available from survey work (e.g. VISTA, WISE). In addition it will bring confirmation of the technical readiness and scientific value of several aspects of potential mid-IR instrumentation at Extremely Large Telescopes. The intervention on VISIR and installation of hardware has been completed in July and commissioning will take place during July and August. VISIR is scheduled to be available to the users starting Oct 2012.\n\nThe Science and Experimental Equipment for the 12 GeV Upgrade of CEBAF\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nArrington, John; Bernstein, Aron; Brooks, William\n\n2005-01-10\n\nThis Conceptual Design Report (CDR) presents the compelling scientific case for upgrading the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jefferson Lab to 12 GeV. Such a facility will make profound contributions to the study of hadronic matter.\n\nEnhanced modeling and simulation of EO/IR sensor systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHixson, Jonathan G.; Miller, Brian; May, Christopher\n\n2015-05-01\n\nThe testing and evaluation process developed by the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) Modeling and Simulation Division (MSD) provides end to end systems evaluation, testing, and training of EO/IR sensors. By combining NV-LabCap, the Night Vision Integrated Performance Model (NV-IPM), One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) input sensor file generation, and the Night Vision Image Generator (NVIG) capabilities, NVESD provides confidence to the M&S community that EO/IR sensor developmental and operational testing and evaluation are accurately represented throughout the lifecycle of an EO/IR system. This new process allows for both theoretical and actual sensor testing. A sensor can be theoretically designed in NV-IPM, modeled in NV-IPM, and then seamlessly input into the wargames for operational analysis. After theoretical design, prototype sensors can be measured by using NV-LabCap, then modeled in NV-IPM and input into wargames for further evaluation. The measurement process to high fidelity modeling and simulation can then be repeated again and again throughout the entire life cycle of an EO/IR sensor as needed, to include LRIP, full rate production, and even after Depot Level Maintenance. This is a prototypical example of how an engineering level model and higher level simulations can share models to mutual benefit.\n\nUpgrading and testing program for narrow band high resolution planetary IR imaging spectrometer\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWattson, R. B.; Rappaport, S.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nAn imaging spectrometer, intended primarily for observations of the outer planets, which utilizes an acoustically tuned optical filter (ATOF) and a charge coupled device (CCD) television camera was modified to improve spatial resolution and sensitivity. The upgraded instrument was a spatial resolving power of approximately 1 arc second, as defined by an f/7 beam at the CCD position and it has this resolution over the 50 arc second field of view. Less vignetting occurs and sensitivity is four times greater. The spectral resolution of 15 A over the wavelength interval 6500 A - 11,000 A is unchanged. Mechanical utility has been increased by the use of a honeycomb optical table, mechanically rigid yet adjustable optical component mounts, and a camera focus translation stage. The upgraded instrument was used to observe Venus and Saturn.\n\nRICH Detector for Jefferson Labs CLAS12\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTrotta, Richard; Torisky, Ben; Benmokhtar, Fatiha\n\n2015-10-01\n\nJefferson Lab (Jlab) is performing a large-scale upgrade to its Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) up to 12GeV beams. The Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS12) in Hall B is being upgraded and a new hybrid Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector is being developed to provide better kaon - pion separation throughout the 3 to 8 GeV/c momentum range. This detector will be used for a variety of Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering experiments. Cherenkov light can be accurately detected by a large array of sophisticated Multi-Anode Photomultiplier Tubes (MA-PMT) and heavier particles, like kaons, will span the inner radii. We are presenting our work on the creation of the RICH's geometry within the CLAS12 java framework. This development is crucial for future calibration, reconstructions and analysis of the detector.\n\nThe analysis and rationale behind the upgrading of existing standard definition thermal imagers to high definition\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGoss, Tristan M.\n\n2016-05-01\n\nWith 640x512 pixel format IR detector arrays having been on the market for the past decade, Standard Definition (SD) thermal imaging sensors have been developed and deployed across the world. Now with 1280x1024 pixel format IR detector arrays becoming readily available designers of thermal imager systems face new challenges as pixel sizes reduce and the demand and applications for High Definition (HD) thermal imaging sensors increases. In many instances the upgrading of existing under-sampled SD thermal imaging sensors into more optimally sampled or oversampled HD thermal imaging sensors provides a more cost effective and reduced time to market option than to design and develop a completely new sensor. This paper presents the analysis and rationale behind the selection of the best suited HD pixel format MWIR detector for the upgrade of an existing SD thermal imaging sensor to a higher performing HD thermal imaging sensor. Several commercially available and \"soon to be\" commercially available HD small pixel IR detector options are included as part of the analysis and are considered for this upgrade. The impact the proposed detectors have on the sensor's overall sensitivity, noise and resolution is analyzed, and the improved range performance is predicted. Furthermore with reduced dark currents due to the smaller pixel sizes, the candidate HD MWIR detectors are operated at higher temperatures when compared to their SD predecessors. Therefore, as an additional constraint and as a design goal, the feasibility of achieving upgraded performance without any increase in the size, weight and power consumption of the thermal imager is discussed herein.\n\nComparison between simulations and lab results on the ASSIST test-bench\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLe Louarn, Miska; Madec, Pierre-Yves; Kolb, Johann; Paufique, Jerome; Oberti, Sylvain; La Penna, Paolo; Arsenault, Robin\n\n2016-07-01\n\nWe present the latest comparison results between laboratory tests carried out on the ASSIST test bench and Octopus end-to end simulations. We simulated, as closely to the lab conditions as possible, the different AOF modes (Maintenance and commissioning mode (SCAO), GRAAL (GLAO in the near IR), Galacsi Wide Field mode (GLAO in the visible) and Galacsi narrow field mode (LTAO in the visible)). We then compared the simulation results to the ones obtained on the lab bench. Several aspects were investigated, like number of corrected modes, turbulence wind speeds, LGS photon flux etc. The agreement between simulations and lab is remarkably good for all investigated parameters, giving great confidence in both simulation tool and performance of the AO system in the lab.\n\nDevelopment of micromegas muon chambers for the ATLAS upgrade\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWotschack, J.\n\n2012-02-01\n\nLarge-area particle detectors based on the bulk-micromegas technology are an attractive choice for the upgrade of LHC detectors and/or detectors for the ILC or other experiments. In the context of the R&D for the ATLAS Muon System upgrade, we have built detectors of order 1 m2. In order to overcome the spark problem in micromegas a novel protection scheme using resistive strips above the readout electrode has been developed. This technology has undergone extensive tests with hadron beams at the CERN-SPS, X-rays in the lab, as well as in a neutron beam. In addition, four 10 Ã 10 cm2 micromegas chambers have been installed in the ATLAS cavern and are taking data under LHC conditions. We will discuss the underlying design of the chambers and present results on the performance of these chambers.\n\nOperational experience on the generation and control of high brightness electron bunch trains at SPARC-LAB\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMostacci, A.; Alesini, D.; Anania, M.

In this paper we present recent results at SPARC-LAB on the generation of such beams, highlighting the key points of our scheme. We will discuss also the on-going machine upgrades to allow driving FELs with plasma accelerated beams or with short electron pulses at an increased energy.\n\nUsing Ozone in Organic Chemistry Lab: The Ozonolysis of Eugenol\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBranan, Bruce M.; Butcher, Joshua T.; Olsen, Lawrence R.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAn ozonolysis experiment, suitable for undergraduate organic chemistry lab, is presented.

Thus the beginnings of a concept for not only teaching computer- based instrumentation techniques, but aiso a method for the beginner to experience writing a com- puter program. Professor Essick saw LabVIEW as the \"perfect environment in which to\n\nNASA Glenn Propulsion Systems Lab (PSL) Icing Facility Update\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nThomas, Queito P.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe NASA Glenn Research Center Propulsion Systems Lab (PSL) was recently upgraded to perform engine inlet ice crystal testing in an altitude environment. The system installed 10 spray bars in the inlet plenum for ice crystal generation using 222 spray nozzles. As an altitude test chamber, PSL is capable of simulation of in-flight icing events in a ground test facility. The system was designed to operate at altitudes from 4,000 ft. to 40,000 ft. at Mach numbers up to 0.8M and inlet total temperatures from -60F to +15F.\n\nIR Spectroscopy and Photo-Chemistry of Extraterrestrial Ices\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBernstein, Max P.; Mastrapa, Rachel; Elsila, Jamie; Sandford, Scott\n\n2005-01-01\n\nDense molecular clouds from which planetary systems form and the outer Solar System are both cold environments dominated by ices. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is used to probe these ices, but the IR absorptions of molecules depend on the conditions. As a result appropriate lab data is needed to correctly fit spectra of extraterrestrial ices. Such fits have shown that most of these ices are composed primarily of H2O, but also contain 1-10 percent of other simple molecules such as CO2, CO, CH4, & NH3;. We shall present near IR spectra of ice mixtures of relevance to icy outer Solar System bodies and show that they still hold surprises, such as the Cheshire cat-like CO2 (2v3) overtone near 2.134 micrometers (4685 cm-1) that is absent from spectra of pure CO2 but present in H2O-CO2 mixtures.\n\nReflections on Three Corporate Research Labs: Bell Labs, HP Labs, Agilent Labs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHollenhorst, James\n\n2008-03-01\n\nThis will be a personal reflection on corporate life and physics-based research in three industrial research labs over three decades, Bell Labs during the 1980's, HP Labs during the 1990's, and Agilent Labs during the 2000's. These were times of great change in all three companies. I'll point out some of the similarities and differences in corporate cultures and how this impacted the research and development activities. Along the way I'll mention some of the great products that resulted from physics-based R&D.\n\nThe HVAC Challenges of Upgrading an Old Lab for High-end Light Microscopes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRichard, R.; Martone, P.; Callahan, L.M.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe University of Rochester Medical Center forms the centerpiece of the University of Rochester's health research, teaching, patient care, and community outreach missions. Within this large facility of over 5 million square feet, demolition and remodeling of existing spaces is a constant activity. With more than $145 million in federal research funding, lab space is frequently repurposed and renovated to support this work. The URMC Medical Center Facilities Organization supporting small to medium space renovations is constantly challenged and constrained by the existing mechanical infrastructure and budgets to deliver a renovated space that functions within the equipment environmental parameters. One recent project, sponsored by the URMC Shared Resources Laboratory, demonstrates these points. The URMC Light Microscopy Shared Resource Laboratory requested renovation of a 121 sq. ft. room in a 40 year old building which would enable placement of a laser capture microdissection microscope and a Pascal 5 laser scanning confocal microscope with the instruments separated by a blackout curtain. This poster discusses the engineering approach implemented to bring an older lab into the environmental specifications needed for the proper operation of the high-end light microscopes.\n\nUpgrading of bio-oil from the pyrolysis of biomass over the rice husk ash catalysts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSutrisno, B.; Hidayat, A.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe pyrolysis oils are complex mixtures of organic compounds that exhibit a wide spectrum of chemical functionality, and generally contain some water. Their direct use as fuels may present some difficulties due to their high viscosity, poor heating value, corrosiveness and instability. For possible future use as replacements for hydrocarbon chemical feedstocks and fuels, the liquids will require considerable upgrading to improve its characteristics. By esterification of the bio oil as the upgrading method, the properties of the bio-oil could be improved. In the paper, the upgrading of a bio-oil obtained by pyrolysis was studied over rice husk ash catalysts. The raw bio-oil was produced by pyrolysis of rice husk.From the experiment results, it can be concluded that the densities of upgraded bio-oil were reduced from 1.24 to 0.95 g.cm-3, and the higherheating value increased from 16.0 to 27.2 MJ/kg and the acidity of upgraded bio-oil was also alleviated from 2.3 to 4.4. The results of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and FT-IR analysis showed that the ester compounds in the upgraded bio-oil increased. It is possible to improve the properties of bio-oil by esterifying the raw bio-oil.\n\nNIRSS Upgrades: Final Report\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPolitovich, Marcia K.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis year we were able to further the NIRSS program by re-writing the data ingest and display code from LabVIEW to C++ and Java. This was leveraged by a University of Colorado Computer Science Department Senior Project. The upgrade made the display more portable and upgradeable. Comparisons with research aircraft flights conducted during AIRS-2 were also done and demonstrate reasonable skill in determining cloud altitudes and liquid water distribution. Improvements can still be made to the cloud and liquid logic. The icing hazard index was not evaluated here since that represents work in progress and needs to be made compatible with the new CIP-Severity algorithm. CIP is the Current Icing Potential product that uses a combination decision tree/fuzzy logic algorithm to combine numerical weather model output with operational sensor data (NEXRAD, GOES, METARs and voice pilot reports) to produce an hourly icing diagnosis across the CONUS. The new severity algorithm seeks to diagnose liquid water production through rising, cooling air, and depletion by ice processes. The information used by CIP is very different from that ingested by NIRSS but some common ground does exist. Additionally, the role of NIRSS and the information it both needs and provides needs to be determined in context of the Next Generation Air Traffic System (NGATS). The Weather Integrated Products Team has a plan for an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) to take place in 2012. NIRSS is not explicitly a part of that IOC but should be considered as a follow-on as part of the development path to a 2025 full capability.\n\nPrecision Electron Beam Polarimetry in Hall C at Jefferson Lab\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGaskell, David\n\n2013-10-01\n\nThe electron beam polarization in experimental Hall C at Jefferson Lab is measured using two devices. The Hall-C/Basel MÃ¸ller polarimeter measures the beam polarization via electron-electron scattering and utilizes a novel target system in which a pure iron foil is driven to magnetic saturation (out of plane) using a superconducting solenoid. A Compton polarimeter measures the polarization via electron-photon scattering, where the photons are provided by a high-power, CW laser coupled to a low gain Fabry-Perot cavity. In this case, both the Compton-scattered electrons and backscattered photons provide measurements of the beam polarization. Results from both polarimeters, acquired during the Q-Weak experiment in Hall C, will be presented. In particular, the results of a test in which the MÃ¸ller and Compton polarimeters made interleaving measurements at identical beam currents will be shown. In addition, plans for operation of both devices after completion of the Jefferson Lab 12 GeV Upgrade will also be discussed.\n\nJefferson Lab CLAS12 Superconducting Solenoid magnet Requirements and Design Evolution\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRajput-Ghoshal, Renuka; Hogan, John P.; Fair, Ruben J.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nAs part of the Jefferson Lab 12GeV accelerator upgrade project, one of the experimental halls (Hall B) requires two superconducting magnets. One is a magnet system consisting of six superconducting trapezoidal racetrack-type coils assembled in a toroidal configuration and the second is an actively shielded solenoidal magnet system consisting of 5 coils. In this presentation the physics requirements for the 5 T solenoid magnet, design constraints, conductor decision, and cooling choice will be discussed. The various design iterations to meet the specification will also be discussed in this presentation.\n\nA Major Upgrade of the H.E.S.S.

It was built to detect Very High Energy (VHE, >100 GeV) cosmic gamma rays, and consists of four 12 m diameter Cherenkov telescopes (CT1-4), built in 2003, and a larger 28 m telescope (CT5), built in 2012. The larger mirror surface of CT5 permits to lower the energy threshold of the array down to 30 GeV. The cameras of CT1-4 are currently undergoing an extensive upgrade, with the goals of reducing their failure rate, reducing their readout dead time and improving the overall performance of the array. The entire camera electronics has been renewed from ground-up, as well as the power, ventilation and pneumatics systems, and the control and data acquisition software. Technical solutions forseen for the next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory have been introduced, most notably the readout is based on the NECTAr analog memory chip. The camera control subsystems and the control software framework also pursue an innovative design, increasing the camera performance, robustness and flexibility. The CT1 camera has been upgraded in July 2015 and is currently taking data; CT2-4 will upgraded in Fall 2016. Together they will assure continuous operation of H.E.S.S at its full sensitivity until and possibly beyond the advent of CTA. This contribution describes the design, the testing and the in-lab and on-site performance of all components of the newly upgraded H.E.S.S. camera.\n\nGAS/LIQUID MEMBRANES FOR NATURAL GAS UPGRADING\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHoward S. Meyer\n\nA new project was initiated this quarter to develop gas/liquid membranes for natural gas upgrading. Efforts have concentrated on legal agreements, including alternative field sites. Gas Technology Institute (GTI) is conducting this research program whose objective is to develop gas/liquid membranes for natural gas upgrading to assist DOE in achieving their goal of developing novel methods of upgrading low quality natural gas to meet pipeline specifications. Kvaerner Process Systems (KPS) and W. L. Gore & Associates (GORE) gas/liquid membrane contactors are based on expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membranes acting as the contacting barrier between the contaminated gas stream and the absorbingmoreÂ Â» liquid. These resilient membranes provide much greater surface area for transfer than other tower internals, with packing densities five to ten times greater, resulting in equipment 50-70% smaller and lower weight for the same treating service. The scope of the research program is to (1) build and install a laboratory- and a field-scale gas/liquid membrane absorber; (2) operate the units with a low quality natural gas feed stream for sufficient time to verify the simulation model of the contactors and to project membrane life in this severe service; and (3) conducted an economic evaluation, based on the data, to quantify the impact of the technology. Chevron, one of the major producers of natural gas, has offered to host the test at a gas treating plant. KPS will use their position as a recognized leader in the construction of commercial amine plants for building the unit along with GORE providing the membranes. GTI will provide operator and data collection support during lab- and field-testing to assure proper analytical procedures are used. Kvaerner and GTI will perform the final economic evaluation. GTI will provide project management and be responsible for reporting and interactions with DOE on this project.Â«Â less\n\nEMC effect for light nuclei: New results from Jefferson Lab\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAji Daniel\n\nHigh energy lepton scattering has been the primary tool for mapping out the quark distributions of nucleons and nuclei. Measurements of deep inelastic scattering in nuclei show that the quark distributions in heavy nuclei are not simply the sum of the quark distributions of the constituent proton and neutron, as one might expect for a weakly bound system. This modification of the quark distributions in nuclei is known as the EMC effect. I will discuss the results from Jefferson Lab (JLab) experiment E03-103, a precise measurement of the EMC effect in few-body nuclei with emphasis on the large x region.moreÂ Â» Data from the light nuclei suggests that the nuclear dependence of the high x quark distribution may depend on the nucleon's local environment, rather than being a purely bulk effect. In addition, I will also discuss about a future experiment at the upgraded 12 GeV Jefferson Lab facility which will further investigate the role of the local nuclear environment and the influence of detailed nuclear structure to the modification of quark distributions.Â«Â less\n\nA new THz/Far-IR beamline at the Jefferson Lab ERL\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNeil, George; Williams, Gwyn\n\n2003-08-01\n\nMultiparticle coherent synchrotron emitted by sub-picosecond bunches of electrons in an energy recovering linac, (ERL), at 75 MHz, yield average powers of ~ 100 watts, even for beam currents of 10 mA.This is 10,000 times higher than typical table-top systems.We describe a new ERL facility under construction at Jefferson Lab, and a new THz extraction system and beamline.We also present theoretical calculations.Potential applications of this exciting new source include driving new non-linear phenomena, performing pump-probe studies of dynamical properties of novel materials, and studying molecular vibrations and rotations, low frequency protein motions, phonons, superconductor bandgaps, electronic scattering, collective electronic excitationsmoreÂ Â» (e.g., charge density waves), and spintronics.This work was supported by the US Department of Energy, the Office of Naval Research and the Commonwealth of Virginia.G.L.

It was built to detect Very High Energy (VHE > 100 GeV) cosmic gamma rays. Since 2003, HESS has discovered the majority of the known astrophysical VHE gamma-ray sources, opening a new observational window on the extreme non-thermal processes at work in our universe. HESS consists of four 12-m diameter Cherenkov telescopes (CT1-4), which started data taking in 2002, and a larger 28-m telescope (CT5), built in 2012, which lowers the energy threshold of the array to 30 GeV .

The entire camera electronics has been renewed from ground-up, as well as the power, ventilation and pneumatics systems, and the control and data acquisition software. Only the PMTs and their HV supplies have been kept from the original cameras. Novel technical solutions have been introduced, which will find their way into some of the Cherenkov cameras foreseen for the next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory. In particular, the camera readout system is the first large-scale system based on the analog memory chip NECTAr, which was designed for CTA cameras.

To investigate whether mitochondrial function is regulated by insulin signaling, we analyzed muscle and liver of insulin receptor (IR) +/- -insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) +/- double heterozygous (IR-IRS1dh) mice, a well described model for insulin resistance. IR-IRS1dh mice were studied at the age of 6 and 12 months and glucose metabolism was determined by glucose and insulin tolerance tests. Mitochondrial enzyme activities, oxygen consumption, and membrane potential were assessed using spectrophotometric, respirometric, and proton motive force analysis, respectively. IR-IRS1dh mice showed elevated serum insulin levels. Hepatic mitochondrial oxygen consumption was reduced in IR-IRS1dh animals at 12 months of age. Furthermore, 6-month-old IR-IRS1dh mice demonstrated enhanced mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle, but a tendency of impaired glucose tolerance. On the other hand, 12-month-old IR-IRS1dh mice showed improved glucose tolerance, but normal muscle mitochondrial function. Our data revealed that deficiency in IR/IRS-1 resulted in normal or even elevated skeletal muscle, but impaired hepatic mitochondrial function, suggesting a direct cross-talk between insulin signaling and mitochondria in the liver.\n\nThe Use and Evaluation of Scaffolding, Student Centered-Learning, Behaviorism, and Constructivism to Teach Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and IR Spectroscopy in a Two-Semester Organic Chemistry Course\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLivengood, Kimberly; Lewallen, Denver W.; Leatherman, Jennifer; Maxwell, Janet L.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSince 2002, infrared spectroscopy (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry have been introduced at the beginning of the first-semester organic chemistry lab course at this university.

Yet despite these technologies, we are expected to reach a bandwidth ceiling in the near future. Communications using orbital angular momentum (OAM) carrying modes offers infinite dimensional states, providing means to increase link capacity by multiplexing spatially overlapping modes in both the azimuthal and radial degrees of freedom. OAM modes are multiplexed and de-multiplexed by the use of spatial light modulators (SLM). Implementation of complex amplitude modulation is employed on laser beams phase and amplitude to generate Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes. Modal decomposition is employed to detect these modes due to their orthogonality as they propagate in space. We demonstrate data transfer by sending images as a proof-of concept in a lab-based scheme. We demonstrate the creation and detection of OAM modes in the mid-IR region as a precursor to a mid-IR free-space communication link.\n\nIncidence, predictors, and procedural results of upgrade to resynchronization therapy: the RAFT upgrade substudy.\n\nPubMed\n\nEssebag, Vidal; Joza, Jacqueline; Birnie, David H; Sapp, John L; Sterns, Laurence D; Philippon, Francois; Yee, Raymond; Crystal, Eugene; Kus, Teresa; Rinne, Claus; Healey, Jeffrey S; Sami, Magdi; Thibault, Bernard; Exner, Derek V; Coutu, Benoit; Simpson, Chris S; Wulffhart, Zaev; Yetisir, Elizabeth; Wells, George; Tang, Anthony S L\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe resynchronization-defibrillation for ambulatory heart failure trial (RAFT) study demonstrated that adding cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in selected patients requiring de novo implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD) reduced mortality as compared with ICD therapy alone, despite an increase in procedure-related adverse events. Data are lacking regarding the management of patients with ICD therapy who develop an indication for CRT upgrade. Participating RAFT centers provided data regarding de novo CRT-D (CRT with ICD) implant, upgrade to CRT-D during RAFT (study upgrade), and upgrade within 6 months after presentation of study results (substudy). Substudy centers enrolled 1346 (74.9%) patients in RAFT, including 644 de novo, 80 study upgrade, and 60 substudy CRT attempts. The success rate (initial plus repeat attempts) was 95.2% for de novo versus 96.3% for study upgrade and 90.0% for substudy CRT attempts (P=0.402). Acute complications occurred among 26.2% of de novo versus 18.8% of study upgrade and 3.4% of substudy CRT implantation attempts (P<0.001). The most common complication was left ventricular lead dislodgement. The principal reasons for not yet attempting upgrade in the substudy were patient preference (31.9%), New York Heart Association Class I (17.0%), and a QRS<150 ms (13.1%). Among a broad group of implant physicians, CRT upgrades were performed in patients with an ICD in situ with no difference in implant success rate and a reduced acute complication rate as compared with a de novo CRT implant. Decisions to upgrade were influenced by predictors of benefit in subgroup analyses of the RAFT study and other trials.

Typical research questions involve detection, recognition and identification as a function of range, blur, noise, spectral band, image processing techniques, image characteristics, and human factors. NVESD's Perception Lab provides an essential bridge between the physics of the imaging systems and the performance of the human operator. In addition to quantifying sensor performance, perception test results can also be used to generate models of human performance and to drive future sensor requirements. The Perception Lab seeks to develop and employ scientifically valid and efficient perception testing procedures within the practical constraints of Army research, including rapid development timelines for critical technologies, unique guidelines for ethical testing of Army personnel, and limited resources. The purpose of this paper is to describe NVESD Perception Lab capabilities, recent methodological improvements designed to align our methodology more closely with scientific best practice, and to discuss goals for future improvements and expanded capabilities. Specifically, we discuss modifying our methodology to improve training, to account for human fatigue, to improve assessments of human performance, and to increase experimental design consultation provided by research psychologists. Ultimately, this paper outlines a template for assessing human perception and overall system performance related to EO/IR imaging systems.\n\nAirborne Warning and Control System Block 40/45 Upgrade (AWACS Blk 40/45 Upgrade)\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-12-01\n\nSelected Acquisition Report ( SAR ) RCS: DD-A&T(Q&A)823-277 Airborne Warning and Control System Block 40/45 Upgrade (AWACS Blk 40/45 Upgrade) As of...Upgrade December 2015 SAR March 23, 2016 16:04:37 UNCLASSIFIED 2 Table of Contents Common Acronyms and Abbreviations for MDAP Programs 3 Program...Acquisition Unit Cost AWACS Blk 40/45 Upgrade December 2015 SAR March 23, 2016 16:04:37 UNCLASSIFIED 3 PB - Presidentâs Budget PE - Program Element\n\nImpaired Insulin Signaling is Associated with Hepatic Mitochondrial Dysfunction in IR+/â-IRS-1+/â Double Heterozygous (IR-IRS1dh) Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFranko, Andras; Kunze, Alexander; BÃ¶se, Marlen; von Kleist-Retzow, JÃ¼rgen-Christoph; Paulsson, Mats; Hartmann, Ursula; Wiesner, Rudolf J.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMitochondria play a pivotal role in energy metabolism, but whether insulin signaling per se could regulate mitochondrial function has not been identified yet.

Almost one in seven people on the planet are expected to reside in urban informal settlements, or slums, by 2030. Slum upgrading is the process of delivering place-based environmental and social improvements to the urban poor, including land tenure, housing, infrastructure, employment, health services and political and social inclusion. The processes and products of slum upgrading can address multiple environmental determinants of health. This paper reviewed urban slum upgrading evaluations from cities across Asia, Africa and Latin America and found that few captured the multiple health benefits of upgrading. With the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focused on improving well-being for billions of city-dwellers, slum upgrading should be viewed as a key strategy to promote health, equitable development and reduce climate change vulnerabilities. We conclude with suggestions for how slum upgrading might more explicitly capture its health benefits, such as through the use of health impact assessment (HIA) and adopting an urban health in all policies (HiAP) framework. Urban slum upgrading must be more explicitly designed, implemented and evaluated to capture its multiple global environmental health benefits.\n\nSlum Upgrading and Health Equity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCorburn, Jason; Sverdlik, Alice\n\n2017-01-01\n\nInformal settlement upgrading is widely recognized for enhancing shelter and promoting economic development, yet its potential to improve health equity is usually overlooked.

Most devices, particularly the beam viewers, cannot be safely inserted into the beam line during high-current beam operations. Software is partly responsible for protecting the machine from untimely insertions. The multiplicity of beam-blocking and beam-vulnerable devices motivates us tomoreÂ Â» try a data-driven approach. The beamline insertions application components are centrally managed and configured through an object-oriented software framework created for this purpose. A rules-based engine tracks the configuration and status of every device, along with the beam status of the machine segment containing the device. The application uses this information to decide on which device actions are allowed at any given time.Â«Â less\n\nStructural Analysis of Thermal Shields During a Quench of a Torus Magnet for the 12 GeV Upgrade\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPastor, Orlando; Willard, Thomas; Ghoshal, Probir K.\n\nA toroidal magnet system consisting of six superconducting coils is being built for the Jefferson Lab 12- GeV accelerator upgrade project. This paper details the analysis of eddy current effects during a quench event on the aluminum thermal shield. The shield has been analyzed for mechanical stresses induced as a result of a coil quench as well as a fast discharge of the complete magnet system. The shield has been designed to reduce the eddy current effects and result in stresses within allowable limits.\n\nMCT IR detection modules with 15 ÃÂµm pitch for high-reliability applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBreiter, R.; Ihle, T.; Wendler, J.; Lutz, H.; Rutzinger, S.; Schallenberg, T.; Hofmann, K.; Ziegler, J.\n\n2010-04-01\n\nAdditional to the development of 3rd Gen IR modules like dual-band and dual-color devices AIM is focused on IR FPAs with reduced pitch. These FPAs allow manufacturing of compact low cost IR modules with minimum power consumption for state-of-the-art high performance IR systems. AIM has realized full TV format MCT 640x512 mid-wave and long-wave IR detection modules with a 15 Î¼m pitch to meet the requirements of critical military applications like thermal weapon sights or thermal imagers in UAV applications. In typical configurations like a F/4.6 cold shield for the 640x512 MWIR module an NETD < 25 mK @ 5 ms integration time is achieved, while the LWIR modules achieve an NETD < 38 mK @ F/2 and 180 Î¼s integration time. For the LWIR modules FPAs with a cut-off of 9 and 10 Î¼m have been realized. The modules are available either with different integral rotary cooler configurations for portable applications which require minimum cooling power or a new split linear cooler providing long lifetime with a MTTF > 20,000 h as required e.g. for warning sensors in 24/7 operation. The modules are available with an optional image processing electronics providing non-uniformity correction and further image processing for a complete IR imaging solution. A double field of view FLIR for an upgrade of the German Army UAV LUNA has been developed by AIM using the MCT 640x512 MWIR 15Î¼m pitch engine. The latest results and performance of those modules and their applications are presented.\n\nImplementation of a fast 16-Bit dynamic clamp using LabVIEW-RT.\n\nPubMed\n\nKullmann, Paul H M; Wheeler, Diek W; Beacom, Joshua; Horn, John P\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe dynamic-clamp method provides a powerful electrophysiological tool for creating virtual ionic conductances in living cells and studying their influence on membrane potential. Here we describe G-clamp, a new way to implement a dynamic clamp using the real-time version of the Lab-VIEW programming environment together with a Windows host, an embedded microprocessor that runs a real-time operating system and a multifunction data-acquisition board. The software includes descriptions of a fast voltage-dependent sodium conductance, delayed rectifier, M-type and A-type potassium conductances, and a leak conductance. The system can also read synaptic conductance waveforms from preassembled data files. These virtual conductances can be reliably implemented at speeds < or =43 kHz while simultaneously saving two channels of data with 16-bit precision. G-clamp also includes utilities for measuring current-voltage relations, synaptic strength, and synaptic gain. Taking an approach built on a commercially available software/hardware platform has resulted in a system that is easy to assemble and upgrade. In addition, the graphical programming structure of LabVIEW should make it relatively easy for others to adapt G-clamp for new experimental applications.\n\nH-1 Upgrades (4BW/4BN) (H-1 Upgrades)\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-12-01\n\nautomatic blade fold of the new composite rotor blades, new performance matched transmissions, a new four-bladed tail rotor and drive system, upgraded...Upgrades December 2015 SAR March 18, 2016 10:59:17 UNCLASSIFIED 4 Col Steven Girard PMA-276 USMC Light/Attack Helicopter Program Executive Officer...attack helicopter is to provide rotary wing close air support, anti-armor, armed escort, armed/visual reconnaissance and fire support coordination\n\ne-Learning - Physics Labs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMohottala, Hashini\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe general student population enrolled in any college level class is highly diverse. An increasing number of ``nontraditional'' students return to college and most of these students follow distance learning degree programs while engaging in their other commitments, work and family. However, those students tend to avoid taking science courses with labs, mostly because of the incapability of remotely completing the lab components in such courses. In order to address this issue, we have come across a method where introductory level physics labs can be taught remotely. In this process a lab kit with the critical lab components that can be easily accessible are conveniently packed into a box and distributed among students at the beginning of the semester. Once the students are given the apparatus they perform the experiments at home and gather data All communications with reference to the lab was done through an interactive user-friendly webpage - Wikispaces (WikiS). Students who create pages on WikiS can submit their lab write-ups, embed videos of the experiments they perform, post pictures and direct questions to the lab instructor. The students who are enrolled in the same lab can interact with each other through WikiS to discuss labs and even get assistance.\n\nDiagnostic and Hardware Upgrades for the US-PRC PMI Collaboration on EAST\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTritz, Kevin; Maingi, R.; Andruczyk, D.; Canik, J.; Wang, Z.; Wirth, B.; Zinkle, S.; Woller, K.; Hu, J. S.; Luo, G. N.; Gong, X. Z.; EAST Team\n\n2017-10-01\n\nSeveral collaborative diagnostic and hardware upgrades are planned to improve understanding and control of Plasma-Material Interactions on EAST, as part of the US-PRC PMI collaboration. Dual-band thermography adapters, designed by UT-K and ORNL, are being designed for existing IR cameras to improve the accuracy of the divertor heat flux measurements by reducing sensitivity to surface emissivity. These measurements should improve power accounting for EAST discharges, which can show a large gap between input power and divertor exhaust power. MIT is preparing tungsten tiles with fluorine depth markers to measure net erosion of PFC tiles. JHU plans to improve the electronics of the Multi-Energy Soft X-ray diagnostic as well as expand the present edge system to a full core-edge measurement; this will enhance the assessment of the effect of Li injection on tungsten accumulation and transport. In addition to PPPL-developed upgrades to the lithium granule and pellet delivery systems, LANL is assessing core-shell micropellets for pellet ablation analysis. Finally, UIUC and PPPL are developing flowing liquid lithium limiters, both with and without LiMIT tile features, for deployment on EAST.

Developmental batteries used included nickel zinc batteries, a nickel iron battery, and an improved lead acid battery. Testing of the electric vehicles and upgraded batteries was performed in the complete vehicle system environment to characterize performance and identify problems unique to the vehicle/battery system. Constant speed tests and driving schedule range tests were performed on a chassis dynamometer. The results from these tests of the upgraded batteries and vehicles were compared to performance capabilities for the same vehicles equipped with standard batteries.\n\nUser and Performance Impacts from Franklin Upgrades\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHe, Yun\n\n2009-05-10\n\nThe NERSC flagship computer Cray XT4 system\"Franklin\" has gone through three major upgrades: quad core upgrade, CLE 2.1 upgrade, and IO upgrade, during the past year. In this paper, we will discuss the various aspects of the user impacts such as user access, user environment, and user issues etc from these upgrades. The performance impacts on the kernel benchmarks and selected application benchmarks will also be presented.\n\nVISIR upgrade overview: all's well that ends well\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKerber, Florian; KÃ¤ufl, Hans Ulrich; Tristram, Konrad; Asmus, Daniel; Baksai, Pedro; Di Lieto, Nicola; Dobrzycka, Danuta; Duhoux, Philippe; Finger, Gert; Hummel, Christian; Ives, Derek; Jakob, Gerd; Lundin, Lars; Mawet, Dimitri; Mehrgan, Leander; Pantin, Eric; Riquelme, Miguel; Sanchez, Joel; Sandrock, Stefan; Siebenmorgen, Ralf; Stegmeier, JÃ¶rg; Smette, Alain; Taylor, Julian; van den Ancker, Mario; Valdes, Guillermo; Venema, Lars\n\n2016-08-01\n\n. After overcoming several additional technical problems, VISIR is back in Science Operations since April 2015. In addition an upgrade of the IT infrastructure related to VISIR has been conducted in order to support burst-mode operations. Science Verification of the new modes was performed in Feb 2016. The upgraded VISIR is a powerful instrument providing close to background limited performance for diffraction-limited observations at an 8-m telescope. It offers synergies with facilities such as ALMA, JWST, VLTI and SOFIA, while a wealth of targets is available from survey works like WISE. In addition, it will bring confirmation of the technical readiness and scientific value of several aspects for future mid-IR instrumentation at Extremely Large Telescopes. We also present several lessons learned during the project.\n\nUpgrading in an Industrial Setting.

The API gravity of crude oils has been decreasing by about 0.17% per year, this meaning that there will be an urgent need for economically viable new technologies to upgrade the heavy oil for the refineries. The same applies to the residues of several refineries processes. This work will present the results of the application of a plasma process to upgrade long-chain hydrocarbons, namely, tridecane, tetradecane, and squalane (shark oil). They are high boiling point alkanes, the latter being a C_30H_62 with six methyl groups attached to various carbon positions on the chain. An oxygen plasma, created by a high voltage glow discharge, reached the low vapor pressure surface of each liquid hydrocarbon. This (2 mL) was cooled down to temperatures close to its freezing point in a glass reactor. Applied power was 24 W for times of reaction between 30 and 60 minutes and oxygen pressures from 0.1 to 0.4 mbar. Products were analyzed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. The ^1H and ^13C NMR spectra showed that the most important products were secondary alcohols and the corresponding ketones, for tridecane and tetradecane. For squalane, tertiary alcohols were first. Total conversions are tipically 90 to 100%\n\nA Comparative Study on Real Lab and Simulation Lab in Communication Engineering from Students' Perspectives\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBalakrishnan, B.; Woods, P.

Each lab is designed to use only the student's smartphone, laptop and items easily found in big-box stores or a hobby shop. Each lab contains theory, set-up instructions and basic analysis techniques. All of these labs can be performed outside of the traditional university lab setting and initial costs averaging less than 8 per student, per lab.\n\nMethLAB\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKilaru, Varun; Barfield, Richard T; Schroeder, James W; Smith, Alicia K\n\n2012-01-01\n\nRecent evidence suggests that DNA methylation changes may underlie numerous complex traits and diseases. The advent of commercial, array-based methods to interrogate DNA methylation has led to a profusion of epigenetic studies in the literature. Array-based methods, such as the popular Illumina GoldenGate and Infinium platforms, estimate the proportion of DNA methylated at single-base resolution for thousands of CpG sites across the genome. These arrays generate enormous amounts of data, but few software resources exist for efficient and flexible analysis of these data. We developed a software package called MethLAB (http://genetics.emory.edu/conneely/MethLAB) using R, an open source statistical language that can be edited to suit the needs of the user. MethLAB features a graphical user interface (GUI) with a menu-driven format designed to efficiently read in and manipulate array-based methylation data in a user-friendly manner. MethLAB tests for association between methylation and relevant phenotypes by fitting a separate linear model for each CpG site. These models can incorporate both continuous and categorical phenotypes and covariates, as well as fixed or random batch or chip effects. MethLAB accounts for multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a user-specified level. Standard output includes a spreadsheet-ready text file and an array of publication-quality figures. Considering the growing interest in and availability of DNA methylation data, there is a great need for user-friendly open source analytical tools. With MethLAB, we present a timely resource that will allow users with no programming experience to implement flexible and powerful analyses of DNA methylation data.

A growing number of schools use virtual labs that must meet mandated laboratory standards to ensure they provide learning experiences comparable to hands-on labs, which are an integral part of science curricula. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to examine teachers' perceptions of the quality and effectiveness of high school virtual labs. The theoretical foundation was constructivism, as labs provide student-centered activities for problem solving, inquiry, and exploration of phenomena. The research questions focused on experienced teachers' perceptions of the quality of virtual vs. hands-on labs. Data were collected through survey questions derived from the lab objectives of The Next Generation Science Standards . Eighteen teachers rated the degree of importance of each objective and also rated how they felt virtual labs met these objectives; these ratings were reported using descriptive statistics. Responses to open-ended questions were few and served to illustrate the numerical results. Many teachers stated that virtual labs are valuable supplements but could not completely replace hands-on experiences. Studies on the quality and effectiveness of high school virtual labs are limited despite widespread use. Comprehensive studies will ensure that online students have equal access to quality labs. School districts need to define lab requirements, and colleges need to specify the lab experience they require. This study has potential to inspire positive social change by assisting science educators, including those in the local school district, in evaluating and selecting courseware designed to promote higher order thinking skills, real-world problem solving, and development of strong inquiry skills, thereby improving science instruction for all high school students.\n\nHigh temperature Ir segregation in Ir-B ceramics: Effect of oxygen presence on stability of IrB 2 and other Ir-B phases\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nXie, Zhilin; Terracciano, Anthony C.; Cullen, David A.; ...\n\n2015-05-13\n\nThe formation of IrB 2, IrB 1.35, IrB 1.1 and IrB monoboride phases in the IrâB ceramic nanopowder was confirmed during mechanochemical reaction between metallic Ir and elemental B powders. The IrâB phases were analysed after 90 h of high energy ball milling and after annealing of the powder for 72 h at 1050Â°C in vacuo. The iridium monoboride (IrB) orthorhombic phase was synthesised experimentally for the first time and identified by powder X-ray diffraction. Additionally, the ReB 2 type IrB 2 hexagonal phase was also produced for the first time and identified by high resolution transmission electron microscope. IrmoreÂ Â» segregation along disordered domains of the boron lattice was found to occur during high temperature annealing.

C.\n\n2013-05-01\n\nOver the years, rapid development in computer technology has engendered simulation-based laboratory (lab) in addition to the traditional hands-on (physical) lab. Many higher education institutions adopt simulation lab, replacing some existing physical lab experiments. The creation of new systems for conducting engineering lab activities has raised concerns among educators on the merits and shortcomings of both physical and simulation labs; at the same time, many arguments have been raised on the differences of both labs. Investigating the effectiveness of both labs is complicated, as there are multiple factors that should be considered. In view of this challenge, a study on students' perspectives on their experience related to key aspects on engineering laboratory exercise was conducted. In this study, the Visual Auditory Read and Kinetic model was utilised to measure the students' cognitive styles. The investigation was done through a survey among participants from Multimedia University, Malaysia. The findings revealed that there are significant differences for most of the aspects in physical and simulation labs.\n\n3D-printed lab-on-valve for fluorescent determination of cadmium and lead in water.\n\nPubMed\n\nMattio, Elodie; Robert-Peillard, Fabien; Vassalo, Laurent; Branger, Catherine; Margaillan, AndrÃ©; Brach-Papa, Christophe; Knoery, JoÃ«l; Boudenne, Jean-Luc; Coulomb, Bruno\n\n2018-06-01\n\nIn recent years, the development of 3D printing in flow analysis has allowed the creation of new systems with various applications. Up to now, 3D printing was mainly used for the manufacture of small units such as flow detection cells, preconcentration units or mixing systems. In the present study, a new 3D printed lab-on-valve system was developed to selectively quantify lead and cadmium in water. Different technologies were compared for lab-on-valve 3D printing. Printed test units have shown that stereolithography or digital light processing are satisfactory techniques for creating complex lab-on-valve units. The lab-on-valve system was composed of two columns, eight peripheral ports and a central port, and a coil integrating baffles to increase mixing possibilities. A selective extraction of lead was first carried out by TrisKem Pbâ¢ Resin column. Then, cadmium not retained on the first column was extracted on a second column of AmberliteÂ® IR 120 resin. In a following step, lead and cadmium were eluted with ammonium oxalate and potassium iodide, respectively. Finally, the two metals were sequentially detected by the same Rhod-5Nâ¢ fluorescent reagent. This 3D printed lab-on-valve flow system allowed us to quantify lead and cadmium with a linear response from 0.2 to 15â¯Âµgâ¯L -1 and detection limits of 0.17 and 0.20â¯Âµgâ¯L -1 for lead and cadmium, respectively, which seems adapted for natural water analysis.
