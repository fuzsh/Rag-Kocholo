History

Copenhagen was established by the Vikings as a fishing town during the 10th century. The presence of a natural harbor and the availability of herring were the main influencing factors to its establishment. The expansion and growth of the town were directly linked to the increased fishing and trade of herring. Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the 15th century after the formation of the Kalmar Union. Subsequent centuries saw the growth of the city as a major hub for education, politics, commerce, and culture. Several important institutions were established including the University of Copenhagen. In the 18th century, the city saw damage from two major fire outbreaks and a plague which destroyed most of the existing buildings and took thousands of lives. Its neutrality in European wars made it an important trading center among states near the Baltic Sea. The 19th century was marked by the Danish Golden Age which saw massive growth in culture, art, and architecture. In the 20th century, Copenhagen served as an administrative and industrial center prospering economically during WWI due to its neutrality. Its involvement in WWII is linked to the occupation of German troops in the city in 1944.
