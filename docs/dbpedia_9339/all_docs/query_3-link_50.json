        "text": "There are three kingdoms in the Nordic countries: Sweden, Denmark and Norway. Denmark has a queen, and Sweden and Norway have a king.\n\nEach Scandinavian royal family has its unique history, traditions, and contributions to their countries.\n\nThe three Nordic countries are exciting places to experience royal monuments and palaces, such as Hamlets Kronborg Castle in Denmark, Drottningholm Castle in Sweden, and the Royal Palace in Oslo, Norway.\n\nMany other exciting royal attractions exist in Copenhagen in Denmark, Stockholm in Sweden, and Oslo in Norway.\n\nThe Royal family in Sweden\n\nThe Swedish Monarchy is more than 1000 years old, and the current monarch in Sweden is HRH King Carl XVI Gustaf; he became King on 15 September 1973 after the death of his grandfather, Gustaf Vl Adolf.\n\nSweden was a kingdom in the 1st century. The monarch is no longer the commander-in-chief of the Swedish Armed Forces, but he has retained the honorary rank of a four-star admiral in the Swedish Army and Air Force.\n\nSweden became the first monarchy to change its succession rites so that the monarch's firstborn child was heir to the throne, regardless of gender.\n\nThe Royal Palace, known as Stockholm Palace, is the King's official residence. The Palace is located on Stadsholmen in Stockholm, known as Gamla Stan, in Stockholm's national capital city.\n\nSee also\n\nTop Royal Attractions in Stockholm\n\nThe Royal family in Denmark\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark is one of the oldest monarchies in the world. The first royal house of Denmark was established in the 10th century by a Viking king called Gorm the Old, and the Danish monarch is a descendant of the old Viking king.\n\nDenmark is a constitutional monarchy, meaning the monarch cannot perform political acts independently. The Queen's main tasks are representing Denmark abroad and being a figurehead at home.\n\nThe Danish Royal Family and Monarchy is a famous institution in Denmark, and it is highly respected and supported by nearly all the Danes.\n\nSee more about the Royal Danish family\n\nA new King in Denmark in 2024\n\nJanuary 14th 2024, HRH Queen Margrethe ll abdicates and leaves the throne to her son, HRH Crown Prince Frederik, who becomes King Frederik the 10th.\n\nMany Danes are proud of their queen and their royal monarchy. Queen Margrethe is hugely respected for her intellectual prowess and artistic abilities, including working as an illustrator and set designer at the Pantomime Theatre in Tivoli in Copenhagen.\n\nThe HRH Queen Margrethe II married a French diplomat, Count Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, now known as HRH Prince Henrik and they got two sons, HRH Crown Prince Frederik and HRH Prince Joachim.\n\nAmalienborg Palace in Royal Copenhagen is the official residence of the Queen and King. Still, there are also other Palaces in Denmark where the royal family stayed during the year, such as Fredensborg Palace, Marselisborg Palace in Aarhus and Gråsten Palace.\n\nGreenland also belongs to the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nSee also\n\nTop 9 Castles in Denmark\n\nThe Royal family in Norway\n\nNorway is a constitutional, hereditary monarchy. According to the Constitution, executive power rests with the King. Still, the Council of the State governs as the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget) has the power.\n\nKing Harald Fairhair initiated the Kingdom of Norway in the 9th century. The Kingdom of Norway obtained independence from Sweden in 1905.\n\nToday in Norway, HRH King Harald V is King. He and his wife, HRH Queen Sonja, have two children, HRH Princess Märtha Louise and HRH Crown Prince Haakon, and they live in Oslo at the Royal Palace.\n\nSee also:"
