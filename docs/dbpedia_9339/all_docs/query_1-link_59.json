        "text": "A fire hit Copenhagen's Old Stock Exchange on Tuesday, one of the Danish capital's best-known buildings, engulfing its spire, which collapsed onto the roof in a scene reminiscent of the 2019 blaze at Paris's Notre-Dame cathedral.\n\nThe Dutch Renaissance style building no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, but serves as headquarters for the Danish Chamber of Commerce. Emergency services, employees from the Danish Chamber of Commerce, including its CEO Brian Mikkelsen, and even passers-by were seen carrying large paintings away from the building in a race to save historic artifacts from the flames.\n\n\"We are saving everything we possibly can,\" Jakob Vedsted Andersen, Copenhagen's fire department chief, told reporters.\n\nDenmark's National Museum sent 25 employees to the scene to help evacuate cultural artifacts and paintings, it said on X.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries, police said.\n\nConstruction a challenge for firefighters\n\nParts of the roof had collapsed and the fire spread to several floors of the building, Vedsted told reporters.\n\n\"It's always sad to put out fires in old buildings,\" he said.\n\nSome 120 people were working to contain the fire but only around 40 per cent of it was under control, Vedsted said, adding that the firefighting operation would go on for at least 24 hours.\n\n\"Horrible pictures from the Boersen. So sad. An iconic building that means a lot to all of us ... Our own Notre-Dame moment,\" Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen wrote on X.\n\nThe historic building, whose spire was shaped as the tails of four dragons intertwined, had been under renovation when the fire broke out. The spire also had three crowns at the top, symbolizing the great kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.\n\n\"This spire is absolutely iconic and there is no other like it in the world,\" Ulla Kjaer, senior researcher at the National Museum of Denmark, told Reuters.\n\nThe scaffolding around the building made it harder for the emergency services to get through to the flames, while the copper roof was preserving the heat, the Copenhagen fire department said.\n\nThe nearby Finance Ministry was evacuated as a result of the fire, the police said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what caused the blaze.\n\nCopenhagen police asked people to avoid driving in the inner part of the city.\n\nThe Danish Chamber of Commerce has worked on restoring it to the style of Denmark's King Christian IV, who had the building constructed in the 17th century."
