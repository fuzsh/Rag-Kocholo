        "text": "Copenhagen is Denmark’s largest city, and its history goes way back. The city houses one of the oldest monarchies in the world and has a history tracing back to the Viking Age. History is everywhere in Copenhagen and the surrounding areas, where you will find old castles, cobbled streets, and ancient ships.\n\nToday Copenhagen is a welcoming and friendly city, but in past years the locals were feared far from the Danish shores. They were Vikings and famous for pillaging and raiding foreign villages. They were sea travellers who explored foreign territories in Europe, Asia and even North America. They believed in Norse Gods like Thor and Odin and their time ran from around 800 until 1050 AD.\n\nThe Viking Age lasted about 250 years. At one point, the Danish Viking Sweyn Forkbeard (Svend Tveskæg) and his son Canute the Great (Knud den Store) were the kings not only of Denmark but of Norway, Southern Sweden, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Shetland, Orkney and parts of England.\n\nAfter the Viking Age, Denmark entered the years of Kings and Queens. Copenhagen was founded in 1167 by Bishop Absalon and became capital of Denmark during the 15th century. Herring fishing then brought great wealth to Copenhagen and, under the reign of King Christian 4th in the 17th century, the city grew to become the important regional capital it remains today. In 1219, legend has it, the Danish flag fell from heaven during a battle in present-day Estonia, helping the Danish army to an unexpected victory.\n\nFrom 1376-1412 Denmark was ruled by a woman. Margrete was the first who ruled through her son, the King. She founded the Kalmar Union bringing Norway, Sweden and Denmark together under her rule. From January 14, 19972, until January 14, 2024, Denmark was once again reigned by a female regent: Queen Margrethe II. In her annually New Year speech on December 31, 2023, Queen Margrethe announced that she would abdicate after 52 years of reign making her son King Frederik X of Denmark. The Royal Family still lives in Copenhagen at Amalienborg Palace.\n\nCopenhagen is also a city of culture and has always been. Amongst its important historical inhabitants are author Hans Christian Andersen, astronomer Tycho Brahe and philosopher Soren Kierkegaard."
