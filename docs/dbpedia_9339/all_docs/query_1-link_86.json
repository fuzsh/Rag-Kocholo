        "text": "June 5th, 1815\n\nInternationale\n\nSituation in Europe continues to deteroiate. Communication lines with the states of the Rhineland and Germany as a whole remain nonexistant at this time.\n\nFall of Konigsberg\n\nResidents and the king of Prussia find themselves capitaless. Retrieved sources can confirm the extraction of King Frederick and the royal family. Their speculated destination is London. This fall marks the second capital of Prussia to be lost, only two years ago did the fall of Berlin occur, only months after the Battle and Fall of Leipzig refugees have arrived in droves to the Slesvig line. No information has surfaced regarding the fate of the nation, but with the knowledge previously gathered we may speculate the nation joins as one of the many to capitulate from the scurge of the Sygdom. Just months ago the forces of Prussia pledged troops to the cause in northwestern France, now the streets of Berlin and Konigsberg ring earily silent with only the moans of the dead to accompany it.\n\nIn Brussels this weekend a new agreement was forged, much to seeining disconnect of Bonaparte. Forces of the United Kingdom are to mobilize and provide aid to the France in return of the formation of a new country encompassing much of Dutch territories held by the French Empire. These territories are to unite as a Sovereign nation known as the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Although such an agreement leaves an English pawn on France's doorstep, many believe the English's involvement are necessary for the survival of France.\n\nUnited Kingdom relations continue to sour. Although perceived peace continues to reign the English and their pettiness knows no bounds. At this time they expect Danish aid and troops to be provided in the Anglo offensive of the Sygdom. King Frederick has stated no such aid shall arrive. Our men are stretched thin at the Danevirke, our navy remains in your hands, now terrorized our citizens, and brought on an attack in peace. No such aid will be provided. A quote from the English Diplomat Augustus Foster. \"All nations of Europe are to provide sacrifice for the liberation of Europe. Denmark must provide sacrifice to rid this scourge!\"\n\nFrench Empire has finalized agreements to deploy forces to the Danevirke. In response the king is to allow the French to stage positions on the north sea, in order to reinforce or perhaps extract those under siege in Hamburg. Danish forces defend the city aswell so such common interest has meritted this measure.\n\nDanevirke\n\nFortifications remain standing, only two breaches were reported as of the last issue. Large groups of Sygdom sufferers are congregated south of the town of Slesvig. Residents have been urged to prepare to evacuate but as of printing their is believed to be no known cases of breaches or symptoms of the Sygdom. The Danewerk 2 wall which fell only days ago continues to be overrun. Only now are we beginning to face the reality of loss of life. A full list of those believed to have fell can be found on page 5.\n\nNorthern Recovery\n\nKirkenes, Norge, June 7th. Account of investigation of and recovery of Vardohus.\n\nOur journey began in the naval yard. We bid fare-well to Copenhagen. We arrived at the small island of Vardo on the 3rd of April. Communication with the fortress and island had been lost since Christmas of 1812. On the island we found not a living soul. Complete desolation. The long decayed bodies of few were recovered, by then frozen and thawed multiple times. Most peculiar of all was a body frozen in the ice of the sea. Its eyes were pealed open, those eyes moved, the limbs were frozen over, but the eyes moved. Long dried blood stained many walls. A train of military equipment lined the ground from the fort to the docks. What events transpired here are un-\n\nJune 30th, 1815\n\nMore Vardo ships arrive at Copenhagen\n\nTwo boats involved in the recovery and investigation of Vardohus F. arrived a quarter past seven this Friday evening. Onboard the ship is vital evidence in peacing the events that transpired at the ill-fated fortress. Along with the first bodies recovered. The soldier's remains are to be laid to rest in Assistens cemetary. Ceremonies will be held respectively on the 5th of July. Surgeons, doctors, physicians, and so called sygdom experts attempt to bring light to the mystery on Vardo. Two such theories we have the pleasure of displaying.\n\nDr Johann Berling\n\nI myself have viewed the recordings and findings of those far up north. Many are quick to point their fingers to the sygdom, but I assure you, by no means could at is have traveled to such remoteness. No case of the Sngdom could transmitt itself accross oceans. This poor air theory is total non-sense, as if we are living through the bubonic plague! Our knowledge has greatly expanded, no plague travels from air!\n\nKarl Dahl\n\nThey deny the sygdom has touched our soil. As if the silk of our red and white flag hasn't been stained by the scourge of Europe. Forbid you fall into a man in denial. Look at the blood that stains the walls, no other disease, plague, scurge, does such! This disease has reached Norge, ravaged and tore through Vardo, and now we drag back a ship full of the dead who fell to such Sygdom. Might I remind you such a disease that simply raises those already deceased. If this ship is to arrive in harbor it will spend the end of our fatherland. I believe the smell of the dead alone awakens those buried away in the cemetaries. This is the end of Denmark. I urge citizens to deny entry to this ship. The dead aboard, they'll kill us all regardless if they're not wandering. This disease reached Vardo, devastated her, and now will feast upon Copenhagen. Bless you all best of luck to you.\n\nInternationale\n\nThe current affairs effective of Thursday June 29th\n\nFranco-Anglo stand against the Sygdom was conducted on the 18th of this month. The little communcation received from such paints a daunting and hopeless picture. So forth we are to provide you with a French account of the event. Louise Blane was extracted from the Dutch coasts by a fishing vessel of Danish origin. He was returned to France, but beforehand he provided the captain, a formal navy officer with a firsthand account. This is the the account.\n\nThe dead do not sleep, they are relentless, you can outmarch them, but they will make the ground while you rest. Their hunger does not stop them. They are beasts, cannibals, monsters, all words fall pail to describe. We were positioned near Brussels. We were to hold a mound of ground. Mont Saint Jean. Before long we were ordered to march toward the farmhouse of Hougoumont, but such orders we cancelled. Such a forsaken fate was avoided. Later we would come to learn all souls positioned at these farms would meet their fates. We instead were positioned near the English Line. Rain poured the evening of Saturday. The roads turned to mud quickly, and the fields of grass even worse. Our first encounter with the dead was on the evening of the 17th, a day earlier than any dragoons reported. The first assault was held with little death, however their numbers did not dwindle, but rather they continued to grow. By nine o'clock our line had retreated many times. Men were lost to the dead every hour. One would simply lose his balance in the mud, and quite quickly the dead would gather around him and feast upon him. His screams would ring, but no soul would make forth to save him for it would be in vain. By what must've been midnight the English, such cowards abandoned our forces. The full brunt of the dead they had held back struck us and we were forced to retreat. Farms such as Hougoumont provided us our only life line. The men there had assembled fires to burn the dead like moths to a light. The manuever worked and provided us cover to retreat, however as I neared them screams could be heard from behind their walls. The unusual fire behind those walls soon followed suit, and what must've been two o'clock the fire extinguished. The English cowards left us all to perish. Foul play was suspected in our ranks, some thought they routed us to bring the dead to Paris. Others believe they were attempting to swarm the Imperial Garde."
