overview\n\nThis thoroughly modern market economy features advanced industry with world-leading firms in pharmaceuticals, maritime shipping, and renewable energy, and a high-tech agricultural sector. Danes enjoy a high standard of living, and the Danish economy is characterized by extensive government welfare measures and an equitable distribution of income. An aging population will be a long-term issue.Denmark’s small open economy is highly dependent on foreign trade, and the government strongly supports trade liberalization. Denmark is a net exporter of food, oil, and gas and enjoys a comfortable balance of payments surplus, but depends on imports of raw materials for the manufacturing sector.Denmark is a member of the EU but not the eurozone. Despite previously meeting the criteria to join the European Economic and Monetary Union, Denmark has negotiated an opt-out with the EU and is not required to adopt the euro.Denmark is experiencing a modest economic expansion. The economy grew by 2.0% in 2016 and 2.1% in 2017. The expansion is expected to decline slightly in 2018. Unemployment stood at 5.5% in 2017, based on the national labor survey. The labor market was tight in 2017, with corporations experiencing some difficulty finding appropriately-skilled workers to fill billets. The Danish Government offers extensive programs to train unemployed persons to work in sectors that need qualified workers.Denmark maintained a healthy budget surplus for many years up to 2008, but the global financial crisis swung the budget balance into deficit. Since 2014 the balance has shifted between surplus and deficit. In 2017 there was a surplus of 1.0%. The government projects a lower deficit in 2018 and 2019 of 0.7%, and public debt (EMU debt) as a share of GDP is expected to decline to 35.6% in 2018 and 34.8% in 2019. The Danish Government plans to address increasing municipal, public housing and integration spending in 2018.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$287.8 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$281.4 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$276 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 60\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$325.6 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n2.3% (2017 est.)\n\n2% (2016 est.)\n\n1.6% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 139\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$50,100 (2017 est.)\n\n$49,300 (2016 est.)\n\n$48,800 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 30\n\nGross national saving\n\n28.8% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n28.3% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n28.7% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 35\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 48% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 25.2% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 20% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: -0.2% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 54.5% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -47.5% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 1.3% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 22.9% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 75.8% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\nbarley, wheat, potatoes, sugar beets;
