        "text": "Relief\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThe Country Quiz\n\nDenmark proper is a lowland area that lies, on average, not more than 100 feet (30 meters) above sea level. The country’s highest point, reaching only 568 feet (173 meters), is Yding Forest Hill (Yding Skovhøj) in east-central Jutland.\n\nThe basic contours of the Danish landscape were shaped at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch (2,580,000 to 11,700 years ago) by the Weichsel glaciation. This great glacial mass withdrew temporarily during several warmer interstadial periods, but it repeatedly returned to cover the land until it retreated to the Arctic north for the last time about 10,000 years ago. As a result, the barren layers of chalk and limestone that earlier constituted the land surface acquired a covering of soil that built up as the Weichsel retreated, forming low, hilly, and generally fertile moraines that diversify the otherwise flat landscape.\n\nA scenic boundary representing the extreme limit reached by the Scandinavian and Baltic ice sheets runs from Nissum Fjord on the western coast of Jutland eastward toward Viborg, from there swinging sharply south down the spine of the peninsula toward Åbenrå and the German city of Flensburg, just beyond the Danish frontier. The ice front is clearly marked in the contrast between the flat western Jutland region, composed of sands and gravels strewn by meltwaters that poured west from the shrinking ice sheet, and the fertile loam plains and hills of eastern and northern Denmark, which become markedly sandier toward the prehistoric ice front. (See also Scandinavian Ice Sheet.)\n\nIn northern Jutland, where the long Lim Fjord separates the northern tip (Vendsyssel-Thy) from the rest of the peninsula, there are numerous flat areas of sand and gravel, some of which became stagnant bogs. Burials and ritual deposits interred in these bogs in antiquity—especially during the Bronze Age and the Iron Age—have been recovered by archaeologists. In more recent centuries these bogs were a valued source of peat for fuel. In the 20th century they were drained to serve as grazing areas for livestock.\n\nIn places along the northern and southwestern coasts of Jutland, salt marshes were formed by the evaporation of an inland sea that existed during the Late Permian Epoch (approximately 260 to 252 million years ago). Senonian chalk, deposited about 100 million years ago, is exposed in southeastern Zealand, at the base of Stevns Cliff (Stevns Klint) and Møns Cliff (Møns Klint), and at Bulbjerg, in northwestern Jutland. Younger limestone of from Danian Age (66.0 to 61.6 million years ago) is quarried in southeastern Zealand."
