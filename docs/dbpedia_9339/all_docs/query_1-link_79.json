        "text": "Foreword\n\nCounterfactual history are often about the big changes to history, the rise and fall of grand empire and dread ideologies. Denmark-Norway are somewhat different. It do not have the potential to rival the great power of Europe, but the survival of the state would be interesting in it own right, as in OTL the Nordic countries are dominated by the small state, but industrial powerhouse; Sweden, with 3 four other small states seeking their own niches and one microstate living its own life. If we put the modern states of Denmark and Norway together it have a population a little larger than Sweden, but at the same time it do not have the industrial potential Sweden have. On the other hand Denmark they have synergy effects Sweden lack, Denmark have a very diverse economy, while Norway have a relatively undiverse economy, but it have had a industrial potential which was never fulfilled, because the lack of capital and the OTL union with Sweden meant investments in Swedish industry was a better investments.\n\nSo this timeline ask the question what would have been the effect of Denmark-Norway stayed one state, I will try to look into the political, the demographic, economic and linguistic effects, what will be the synergies of such a union.\n\nIn general this timeline will avoid butterflies unless it serve the plot, unless the development and survival of the union direct effect foreign countries or marriages, I will seek to create a history as close to OTL, at least through the 19th century.\n\nUseful terms.\n\nHelstaten: “Whole State” an ideology which sought to keep Denmark, Norway and the Duchies a centralise state.\n\nThe Duchies: Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg.\n\nBokmål: “Book Language” one of several terms for the dominating Norwegian dialects, which are de facto dialects of Danish. It’s closer related to standard Danish than several Jutish dialects.\n\nNynorsk: “New Norwegian” one of several terms for a written standardisation of western and northern dialects of Norwegian, which are de facto a separate language from Danish and Bookmål, Danes can understand it in written form thanks to much of the vocabulary being adopted from Danish, but it’s incredibly hard to understand when spoken. Faroese de facto a dialect of it. Today mostly used in Western Norway, while the northern dialect decide to use Bokmål as written language.\n\nPrincipality of Rügen: Swedish Pomerania.\n\nFeedback is welcomed, I especially seek people who can give my a general idea how Sweden will develop through the 19th century without the union with Norway and still dealing with the loss of Finland.\n\nBeside that I also seek suggestion what could start the war between Prussia and Austria without the war in 1864, and the disagrement over the occupation of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nA general overview are needed to describe the Union and how many structures are different from OTL. Because the loss of Norway changed how the union continued to develop in the 19th century and this post will focus on this.\n\nHow did the union of Denmark-Norway survive, well I will go with them somehow changing side before Sweden did. It’s not really important, the important part is the result.\n\nAs for the Vienna Congress Denmark-Norway succeed in gaining Lauenburg, Sweden kept Swedish Pomerania. How this happened are very complex, but not really important, so roll with it people.\n\nThe result are a map of Europe in 1815, where the only significant changes are Danish Norway and Sweden keeping its province in Pomerania.\n\nSo what else are different for Denmark-Norway, well the end of conflict with UK earlier lead to Denmark avoiding its State Bankruptcy in 1813 as the state are able to export (Yay).\n\nSo the Denmark-Norway going into the post-War period have a far better economy, than OTL Denmark.\n\nAt the same time Denmark-Norway was quite different from the kingdom which entered the Napoleonic Wars, the fortunes build on slave and sugar trade was gone, instead large landowners and smuggler had made their own fortunes. The state had not end up in bankruptcy, but it was a impoverish state making it out of the wars, the Norwegian population dealt with aftermath of the famines.\n\nDemographic the Union was home to around 2,8 million people, Norway and Denmark had each around a million people while Holstein was home to 400.000, Schleswig 300.000 and Lauenburg 35.000 people. the North Atlantic possession had another 60.000 people. Beside these there was also the Danish colonies of the Danish West Indies, Danish India and Danish Gold Coast. But the full population of these areas was unknown, but even with African vassals/allies the colonies counted less than 200.000 people.\n\nIf we look at the population around four out of five are Scandinavian speakers, while the rest are mostly German speakers. The most relevant speakers of other language are a small population of Frisian speakers, Icelander and a few Sami and Finns in northern Norway. The West Indies are in the middle of a language shift from a Dutch creole to English, the Cold Coast are populated by speakers of several local languages, through a Danish speaking biracial group lives around the Danish forts. At last Danish India are split between Tamil and Bengali speakers.\n\nIn OTL the Danish industry suffered the loss of Norway, which meant the centre of growth moved from the inner Danish waters (the islands and eastern Holstein) to south Holstein which was connected with Hamburg and had easier access to the European markets. In Norway much of the manufacturing collapsed without access to the Danish markets and the mining and forestry export suffered too. Well here the old structures of trade and transportation of goods stay. This means neither Denmark nor Norway suffer the economic crisis of OTL. Of course Holstein still see the growth of south Holstein, but it keep the growth in eastern Holstein which keep its agricultural export to Norway. In OTL the rise of south Holstein let to a greater focus on Germany and identity as Germans for the duchies. Here the east coast of the duchies keep a much greater focus on Denmark, the result are that Kiel, Schleswig (the town) and Flensburg stay oriented toward Denmark instead of Hamburg and Germany. The results are that the idea of Holsteiners as German speaking Danes rather than Germans living under a Danish king stays alive.\n\nThe result are that rather than placing their loyalty to the Danish king, instead they place their loyalty toward the Danish state. Of course German nationalism are still happening and it gain a widespread popularity among German students, but while in OTL it resulted in a alliance between liberals who wanted to join Germany and conservative who wanted greater autonomy against the Denmark, we instead see an alliance between Danish and Holsteiner conservatives to keep Helstaten united. While the liberals on the other hand are split between Danish/Scandinavian and German nationalists, with the Danish liberals force in the end into a coalition with the conservatives to keep the union together.\n\nThis will serve to fundamental change what a Danish and Scandinavian identity are. Danish simply becomes a term for people dwelling in the Danish-Norwegian Union, instead Danish and Norwegian nationalist see themselves as part of a Scandinavian national identity. There will be exceptions to this. Fundamental Danish shift or rather stay a similar identity to Austrian, Swiss, British or Canadian.\n\nOf course just as we usually identify the average Canadian as a English speaking person, the Swiss with the German speakers and the British with the English. In the same manner foreigners will see the typical Dane as a speaker of standard Danish (Rigsdansk) and related dialects, but there will be a awareness of the existence of Danes who speak a weird version of German.\n\nHopefully Norway will still break free and have their own constitution and royal family by 1905... just maybe without being in union with Sweden first like in OTL?\n\nOf course they won't, I won't write a timeline like this for that, Norwegian independence could have been avoided by Sweden, it would just have demanded the Swedes thought of the entire union. Denmark and Norway on the other hand share a whole lot of interest, which is why I don't think a union will break down.\n\nDenmark-Norway will definitely need the U.K. nonantagonistic or at least unpersuaded by Swedish attempts to ally.\n\nYes but I have decided to handwave it, the important fact are the survival of the Union, not precisely why the British decides that Denmark are a preferable ally.\n\nWhile I can see Danish used commonly to mean \"unionish\" - similarly that English is used for British, Holland for Netherlands, etc - there will need to be a term for \"unionish\".\n\nWould Nordensk be viable at this time?\n\nThe official term will be Danish-Norwegian, but Danish will be used as a shorthand outside official documents.\n\nOTL there's no \"union name\" for the Danish Realm, so I would guess people would still call themselves Danes.\n\nNordic wouldn't work, since Sweden and Finland are also Nordic countries. Not sure how Swedes would react to that, though I could imagine them believing it to be a Danish cassus beli.\n\nI haven't fully decided on the use of Nordic and Scandinavian, before the Swedish loss of Finland, Nordic was used as a term for North Germanic speakers, Scandinavian only replaced that with the rise of pan-Scandinavianism, where Finns became fully included in the term Nordic. A weaker Sweden and a stronger Denmark may mean we don't see that replacement.\n\nI can see this becoming a problem for the German-speaking provinces, but AFAIK OTL they still identified themselves as German-speaking Danes.\n\nYou also don't have the same issues for the other provinces (bar perhaps Norway) since they're underdeveloped and has a small population.\n\nDenmark, Norway and the Duchies are as you said the only provinces which matters, we will see some change to that.\n\nI don't think this TL will see the same Norwegian nationalism as OTl. 1) I think the Norwegian population is gonna be very pro-Danish when the Napoleonic wars ends, due to Danish efforts to smuggle agricultural goods to Norway, under the English blockade. 2) the Norwegian Elite is practically Danish at this point or at least also very pro-Danish. 3) Norways economy is gonna stayed tied a lot more to Denmark than to GB as it was historical. 4) The Norwegian peasants were never treated harshly by the Danish King, or atleast not harsher than Danish peasants were.\n\nYes we won't see the change of focus toward UK, in fact in OTL Norway suffered from the fact that any industrial improvement suffered under the Swedes could do anything the Norwegians did, just better. Denmark lack the vast forest, the massive hydro power potential and the significant mineral riches Norway have. So Norway will turn into the centre of Danish heavy industry.\n\nI am wondering what the effect of Aalborg will be, due to the city's close links to Norway, I think a good guess would be that it is significant larger than OTL.\n\nAalborg will be different, as north Jutland will turn into the place where the Norwegian elite travel on vacations, but on the other hand Aalborg won't take the position of Denmark's connection to the North Atlantic possessions, Bergen will keep that. I think the main difference for Aalborg, Aarhus and Odense are that they will third tier cities rather than second tier cities in the Danish-Norwegian state. We will have Copenhagen which will be larger than OTL, next we will have Christiania (Oslo), Altona and maybe Bergen as second tier cities.\n\nOf course Aalborg will still be far larger than in OTL.\n\nAnother city which might have a interesting but somewhat different development is København, if I remember correct it had a very large German population which disappeared after world war I, so that might stay\n\n.\n\nCopenhagen was 20-25% German, that number will still fall, because of the rural migration to Copenhagen, but with Denmark keeping German language areas, we will still see a significant German minority in Copenhagen, but I suspect it will lay around 15%.\n\nOther cities that will be affected, is that Altona [Part of Hamburg now] stays in the Helstat, which is gonna be interesting development wise for both Altona, but also Hamburg.\n\nYes it will be pretty interesting, I expect Hamburg-Altona will grow into a weird double city.\n\nEsbjerg is also probably not gonna be more than a fishing town, but what that means for western Jutland I don't know.\n\nYes I lean toward Esbjerg not being developed, but this will mean that Ribe will have room to grow instead, while Ribe won't rival OTL Esbjerg, it will still dominate the local area in the same manner as Næstved dominates it's local area, I expect Ribe to have 40-60.000 people.\n\nOne of the intriguing parts is that Sweden keeps Swedish Pomerania, with you mentioned keeping to OTL as much as possible. So are this TL gonna see a Prussia/German war against Denmark-Norway + Sweden for the German territories ?\n\nI doesn't plan for it, I plan for Prussia to simply accept these area staying outside Germany. Sweden always was quite friendly with Prussia and Swedish Pomerania aren't worth the loss of that relationship. Schleswig-Holstein on the other hand are worth the conflict. But honestly without Denmark giving a so idiotic casus belli, I expect Prussia prefer a peaceful northern border\n\nHow would the Faroes and Greenland develop? If Denmark and Norway stays out of an economic crisis, as ATL says, would the Faroes and Greenland develop further since DK would be richer, or would they suffer since the Danish resources will (most likely) be spent on developing Norway?\n\nI haven't fully written it out yet, not even n my mind, but I expect we will see a language conflict in Norway, between Danish (Bokmål) and Norwegian (Nynorsk) speakers, the former will win as in OTL in all areas except Vestlandet, there Nynorsk will dominate, but across the sea Nynorsk will also have success on the Faroes, where Nynorsk end up the written standard instead of modern Faroese. Fundamental Faroese will end up integrated with Vestlandet. Of course Vestlandet speaking a different language will create a \"interesting\" dynamic when the oil are found.\n\nGreenland I expect will see greater Norwegian immigration than Danish one in OTL, the climate are significant different from Denmark, but the best areas of Greenland are better than the worst areas in Norway, beside that with the greater Norwegian experience with mining than Danies (Danes do mine, but we go after bulk material like granite, gravel, clay and chalk) as such I expect to see more mining on Greenland.\n\nBeside that we also have two other north Atlantic areas to talk about.\n\nIceland I expect to be also to be somewhat better developed, Denmark did improve Iceland through the 19th century, but Norway will keep a lot of expertice in develop areas with climate like Iceland.\n\nAt last Svalbard I expect with Danish capital and the bigger need for coal, we will see a much bigger mining community, but also a much clearer ownership of the territory.\n\nNext we will have Christiania (Oslo), Altona and maybe Bergen as second tier cities.\n\nOk bare with me here:\n\nI agree that these three cities are probably gonna the second tier cities, though I would argue that Kiel will quite comfortable be the star of the third rate cities.\n\nI think there might be a good argument for Altona to be the largest of the Second rate cities. Christiania I think is one of the few cities that will get the \"least\" out of the Dano-Norwegian Union, I expect you're gonna have substantiel population growth so it is probably gonna end up a bit larger than OTL but not more than that. Bergen on the other hand I think could quite likely end up rivaling Christiania population wise.\n\nWhy? Because I suspect that Norway is gonna be much more regional, in the sense that Christiania is not gonna be the center of government.\n\nSo in Denmark you have Copenhagen soaking up population from the rural areas like a sponge, but Christiania won't so there is more cities that get to shine, especially Bergen.\n\nNow why Altona:\n\nI doesn't plan for it, I plan for Prussia to simply accept these area staying outside Germany. Sweden always was quite friendly with Prussia and Swedish Pomerania aren't worth the loss of that relationship. Schleswig-Holstein on the other hand are worth the conflict. But honestly without Denmark giving a so idiotic casus belli, I expect Prussia prefer a peaceful northern border\n\nHistorical before the First and Second Schleswig war Denmarks main trading partner was with Germany (Or the various Germans state) During these war the national rhetoric changed towards them for obvious reasons, and GB became the Main trading partner due to the ongoing blockade during the wars, but also because the market was incredible profitable. But OTL GB only remained our main trading partner for a century or so, before it changed back to Germany.\n\nSure the market of GB is something that Denmark-Norway probably are gonna be heavily invested in. But in this TL the link between Denmark and Germany won't be broken due to no war, so I think there is a fair bet that the German states are gonna remain the major trading partner, and most of that trade will go through Altona.\n\nMight be wrong though !\n\nI expect Hamburg-Altona will grow into a weird double city.\n\nYea indeed, but with Altona large enough to stay significantly outside Hamburgs light, compared to OTL Copenhagen-Malmö\n\nyes I lean toward Esbjerg not being developed, but this will mean that Ribe will have room to grow instead, while Ribe won't rival OTL Esbjerg\n\nI think Esbjerg probably are gonna be a city in its own right, say OTL Ribe size, just because it is a okay place to have a habour. But it will probably stay the soulless city that it is today. Compared to Ribe which while not as large as OTL Esbjerg probably will have plenty of soul!\n\nOk bare with me here:\n\nI agree that these three cities are probably gonna the second tier cities, though I would argue that Kiel will quite comfortable be the star of the third rate cities.\n\nI'm not so sure even in OTL where it's the cpital of Schleswig-Holstein it's smaller than Aarhus. I suspect we see a pearl chain of tertiary \"Jutish\" cities around the same size (Kiel, Flensburg, Aarhus and Aalborg). I suspect that Trondheim will be the largest tertiary city simply because the lack of competing cities close by.\n\nI think there might be a good argument for Altona to be the largest of the Second rate cities. Christiania I think is one of the few cities that will get the \"least\" out of the Dano-Norwegian Union, I expect you're gonna have substantiel population growth so it is probably gonna end up a bit larger than OTL but not more than that. Bergen on the other hand I think could quite likely end up rivaling Christiania population wise.\n\nWhy? Because I suspect that Norway is gonna be much more regional, in the sense that Christiania is not gonna be the center of government.\n\nSo in Denmark you have Copenhagen soaking up population from the rural areas like a sponge, but Christiania won't so there is more cities that get to shine, especially Bergen.\n\nNow why Altona:\n\nHistorical before the First and Second Schleswig war Denmarks main trading partner was with Germany (Or the various Germans state) During these war the national rhetoric changed towards them for obvious reasons, and GB became the Main trading partner due to the ongoing blockade during the wars, but also because the market was incredible profitable.

On the other hand Oslo/Christiania lies in the centre of the agricultural centre of Norway, it have access to incredible amount of hydropower, it have access to large amount of raw materials and at last with sea travel it's very close to Copenhagen. I suspect the Viken region (or greater Christiania) will be the industrial heart of Denmark. So I think it will be far greater population in the region than in OTL.\n\nOn the other hand Altona will be a major Danish export port to western Europe and Germany. I suspect the result will be that Hamburg-Altona will have even bigger population than in OTL.\n\nI think Esbjerg probably are gonna be a city in its own right, say OTL Ribe size, just because it is a okay place to have a habour. But it will probably stay the soulless city that it is today. Compared to Ribe which while not as large as OTL Esbjerg probably will have plenty of soul!\n\nI suspect you're right."
