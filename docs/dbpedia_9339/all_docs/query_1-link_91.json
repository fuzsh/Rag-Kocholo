        "text": "Copenhagen has been my dream destination for such a long time. And finally, after seeing the movie Danish Girl, I decided – it’s time to visit this pretty city. Even before going there, I knew I’d fall in love with Copenhagen. And I was right. For a girl like me who loves compact cities with rich histories and beautiful architecture, Copenhagen is the perfect place to be. It’s so vibrant, full of life and, at the same time, it feels cozy and intimate. If you’re planning a trip there, keep reading our Copenhagen travel guide.\n\n1. TAKE A STROLL THROUGH THE BOTANICAL GARDEN\n\nCopenhagen Botanical Garden is located in the center of Copenhagen and has 27 historical glasshouses dating from 1874. The Palm House, the most notable glasshouse, is 16 meters tall and has narrow spiral staircases leading to a passageway at the top. Some of the plants there are more than 100 years old.\n\n2. GO UP THE ROUND TOWER\n\nThe Rundetaarn (Round Tower in English), is a 17th-century tower located in central Copenhagen which was built as an astronomical observatory. You can stroll up the spiral walkway to enjoy the magnificent view of old Copenhagen. Don’t forget to check out the library that’s located near the top. And on the way there you can stop by the floating glass floor – see the tower’s core by standing on a glass floor, hovering 25 meters above the ground. It’s free for Copenhagen Cardholders, 25.00 DKK for adults, and 5.00 DKK for children.\n\n3. TAKE A WALK ALONG NYHAVN\n\nIt is nearly impossible to visit Copenhagen without taking a stroll along Nyhavn. It’s the 17th-century canal waterfront that’s lined with boats and colorful houses. Nyhavn is the place you see in many postcards and images of the city and there’s a reason why – it’s picture-perfect!\n\n4. VISIT THE ROYAL LIBRARY\n\nThe famous Black Diamond is an extension to the Royal Library that is connected to the original library by several bridges. The outside of the building is covered with black marble and glass and you can see the sky and water being reflected on the shiny black surface. The interior of the Black Diamond is gorgeous as well with its 24-meter high atrium and a panoramic view over the harbor.\n\n5. ENJOY THE VIEW FROM THE TÅRNET\n\nVisit Tårnet – the parliament tower – a space that was abandoned and used as a storage space for a period of time. It is the tallest tower in Copenhagen and the view of the city is fantastic from there. It is also completely free.\n\n6. GET SOME SOUVENIRS FROM HAY\n\nHAY House is a Danish interior design shop. It has two floors packed with gorgeous furniture and smaller items for the home (kitchen towels, candle holders, lots of stationery items, etc.). If you’re looking for a place to get a stylish souvenir – this would be it.\n\n7. SAY HI TO THE LITTLE MERMAID\n\nStop by and say hi to the Little Mermaid – one of Copenhagen’s most famous tourist attractions. The sculpture was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale about a mermaid who gives up everything to be united with a young, handsome prince on land. This is definitely a very touristy spot, but the area around it is nice and you might enjoy taking a walk there.\n\n8. HAVE BRUNCH AT WULFF & KONSTALI\n\nAnother one of my favorites from our trip to Copenhagen – Wulff & Konstali. It’s a small restaurant chain with beautiful interiors and delicious brunches. I wrote a blog post about this place HERE.\n\n9. EXPLORE ØSTERBRO\n\nØsterbro is a vibrant neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants – definitely worth exploring if you have time. And if you’re looking for a street with tons of cute colorful houses, walk along Olufsvej Street. The street is not that long, it’s very quiet and beautiful. You’re going to want to snap a picture of every single house on that street.\n\n10. ENJOY A CUP OF COFFEE AT ATELIER SEPTEMBER\n\nCheck out Atelier September if you’re looking for a good cup of coffee with some pastries or an avocado toast. The place is beautifully designed with big windows and lots of natural light. You can know for sure your coffee pictures will turn out great there.\n\n11. WATCH THE CHANGING OF THE GUARDS AT AMALIENBORG PALACE\n\nThe Amalienborg Palace is the home of the Danish royal family. Each day at noon, there is a changing of the guards procession that is free for the public to see. Make sure to arrive by 11:45, as people line up early to get a good spot. Afterwards, pay a visit to the Marble Church – one of the most impressive churches of the city – that’s located right across the street.\n\nWhere to Stay in Copenhagen: Our Stylish Airbnb\n\nUntil next time, Copenhagen!"
