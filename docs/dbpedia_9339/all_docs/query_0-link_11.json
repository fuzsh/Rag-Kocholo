        "text": "Scandinavia is a fascinating region of Northern Europe, known around the world for its natural beauty. But does it have a capital city?\n\nThe three capitals of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway all vie for attention within the region. But which of Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Oslo has the biggest clout on the world stage?\n\nOf course, it's a ridiculous question really. It’s like asking what is the capital of Europe. Brits would say London, the French would claim Paris, Spaniards Madrid, Italians Rome, and Germans Berlin.\n\nBrussels has a claim as the home of the EU political class, but the biggest European city in terms of population is actually Istanbul, which also has historical claims and a strategic position as the gateway to Asia.\n\nHowever, Governments, city councils, tourist boards and the like continue to argue over the capital of Scandinavia. So we’re going to join in!\n\nWith that in mind, where does one begin? After my visit to Copenhagen earlier this month, I've now spent time in all three. Here’s what I think about each of the three contenders.\n\nStockholm, Sweden\n\nSweden's capital city Stockholm ranks first in terms of population of the city (984,748) and urban area (2.1 million), as of 2023.\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest factor in Stockholm's favour is this: the city simply feels like a capital.\n\nIt's large, historical, and I would say the most naturally beautiful of the three cities. If you like water, you'll love Stockholm. Built on 14 islands, the city offers endless watery views and the opportunity to tour the archipelago by boat.\n\nAs for the economy, Stockholm is dominated by finance and high technology. The Scandinavian publishing giant Bonnier is based here too.\n\nStockholm is the self-proclaimed Capital of Scandinavia:\n\nThere are many reasons why Stockholm is the natural Capital of Scandinavia. One is that Stockholm is positioned at the heart of the region, and enjoys the benefits of a world-class transport infrastructure. Another is that Stockholm is the largest city in the largest country in Scandinavia. It is also where you find the most multinational companies, the largest stock market and, not least, the most visitors.\n\nThe Swedes are considered to be the most arrogant of the Nordic population, so it's perhaps no surprise they were first to come out with an advertising slogan like this.\n\nCopenhagen, Denmark\n\nAs of 2023, the population of Denmark’s capital city Copenhagen is a little smaller (city 653,664, urban area 1.36 million). But the city competes well with Stockholm in other areas.\n\nIt held the title of European Green Capital for 2014, and is of course the home of world-famous Danish design like the egg chair.\n\nWhere Copenhagen really shines is transport. Every year over six million vehicles cross the Öresund Bridge, which links Denmark's capital with the Swedish city of Malmö. The combined urban area has a population of 2.5m.\n\nOn top of this, Copenhagen Airport is the busiest airport not just in Scandinavia, but the whole Nordic region. It's the main hub of Scandinavian Airlines, and has a considerably higher percentage of international traffic than its rivals in Oslo and Stockholm.\n\nCopenhagen also leads the way with bicycle-friendly city planning. According to the local tourist board, city residents cycle an estimated 1.44 million km every single day. Also, almost half of all trips to work or school in the city are on a bicycle.\n\nFinally, Copenhagen is home to the headquarters of the Nordic Council, so there’s some definite political clout there too.\n\nOslo, Norway\n\nNorway’s capital city Oslo is the underdog, albeit one whose bark is a lot louder these days. It’s population has grown fast.\n\nSo much so, that as of late 2022 the city itself has more than 700,000 residents, making it an equivalent size, if not slightly bigger, than Copenhagen. However, the wider urban area is home to just over 1 million, which is less than both Stockholm and Copenhagen.\n\nOslo has a lot going for it these days. It's one of Europe's leading maritime centres and an important base for many Norwegian energy companies.\n\nIn the fDi Magazine report “European Cities of the Future 2012”, Oslo was ranked number one among large European cities in economic potential, and ranked 2nd in business friendliness, behind Amsterdam.\n\nWith the opening of the National Museum and MUNCH in 2022, Oslo enjoys a growing reputation in the arts. In addiiton, new premium hotels have begun to attract a new kind of tourist to the city.\n\nOur Verdict on the Capital of Scandinavia\n\nI think it’s fair to say that each of the cities has a claim. But, you can probably guess where I'm going with this one: Scandinavia doesn't need a capital.\n\nGermany has several major cities with different strengths: Government and hi-tech in Berlin, media in Hamburg, finance in Frankfurt, etc. Likewise, the Scandinavian region has three thriving cities drawing different kind of visitors, businesses and opportunity into the region.\n\nIf you extend the definition to include the other major Nordic cities, Helsinki and Reykjavík, the collective strength increases further.\n\nRather than arguing about which city is better than the other, let's celebrate the unique strengths of each, and this wonderful region as a whole."
