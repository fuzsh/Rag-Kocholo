        "text": "Welcome to Copenhagen. If you arrive early, which is highly recommended, why not visit the pastel-coloured waterfront houses in the Nyhavn area. Drop in at an industrial-chic bar for a drink or stroll around the famous Tivoli Gardens, home to the world's oldest rollercoaster. Another area worth checking out is Norrebro, a residential area known for its wide range of restaurants. Meet your group at 6 pm then head out for an optional group dinner if it takes your fancy.\n\nWhen in Copenhagen, do as the locals do and explore the city by bike, undoubtedly the best way to explore the city's many hidden corners. The bike-friendly streets mean cycling to the city's major sites are a breeze. Venture into the Freetown of Christiania with a local guide, a self-proclaimed autonomous neighbourhood south-east of the city centre. It is regulated by a special law, the Christiania Law of 1989, and has been a source of controversy since 1971 when squatters took over a former military area. The late afternoon is free for you to further explore this Scandinavian city. Stroll along the harbour or head out to the classicist palaces of 18th century Amalienborg, to this day the main residence of the Danish Royal family. Perhaps pay a visit to Frederik's Church, also known as Marble Church, the Court House on Nytorv Square or check out the facade of the red brick town hall. Alternatively, the National Museum is not to be missed, nor is the Christiansborg Palace in the very centre of Copenhagen.\n\nA morning train ride will get us to Malmo in Sweden, via the famous Oresund Bridge that spans the strait separating Denmark and the Scandinavian Peninsula. Malmo has gone through somewhat of a transformation, or should we say revival, over the past twenty years thanks to the construction of the Oresund Bridge and the opening of Malmo University. Now, a city once reliant mainly on shipbuilding is growing steadily with architecture firms, IT companies, students and start-ups. Just under half of Malmo's population is under the age of 35, so it really now is a progressive city that knows how to have fun. Spend some time checking out the Old Town, the castle or perhaps have a glance inside Apoteket Lejonet, a 1896 pharmacy in Neo-Renaissance style. Then continue on to Gothenburg (by train or bus depending on availability at the time of booking), where you'll spend the night.\n\nCatch an early-ish ferry from Gothenburg to Vrango Island. Vrango is the most southerly island of the Gothenburg Archipelago, with a permanent population in the low hundreds and a strong fishing industry. The island is known for its stunning beaches and protected nature reserves and you'll explore the coastline in an included kayaking activity (summer only). In the afternoon, enjoy some free time strolling around the town or maybe try an optional floating sauna, before returning to Gothenburg for a free evening. Sweden's second largest city is known as the world's most sustainable destination and is exemplary example of what a responsible tourism destination should look like.\n\nThis morning you'll head to Alingsas, regarded as the Capital of Fika, a Swedish cafe and food culture. You'll be accompanied by a local expert to tour some of the town's best traditional cafes. You'll learn of the local love affair with coffee and discover the story behind this town's special cafe culture. And, of course, you'll also get a chance to sample Swedish cinnamon buns, biscuits, chocolate truffles, pastries and sandwiches. You'll return to Gothenburg in the late afternoon and have a little time to explore at your leisure. Perhaps visit the Göteborg City Museum, housed in the former East India Company House and built during the time when Gothenburg's role was that of a major maritime trading centre. Take in the architectural ensemble on Gustav Adolfs Torg, go shopping along the main boulevard Avenyn, check out the iconic Skansen Kronan, stroll along bohemian Långgatan street or sip a coffee in the charming Haga quarter, known for its picturesque wooden houses.\n\nCatch a morning bus across the border to Norway's capital Oslo. Your leader will take you on an initial orientation walk so you get a first taste of this quirky, colourful city. It's definitely worthwhile to spend the afternoon perusing delicacies at Maschmanns Food Market, admiring the handiwork of glass blowers at the Hadeland Glassverk, or simply strolling along Karl Johans Gate, the main shopping strip of the city. Perhaps head to the Munch Museum to glimpse Edvard Munch's famous 19th-century painting, The Scream. In the evening say 'skal' ('cheers') to the group over dinner. Why not seek out some traditional Norwegian fare based around cod and mackerel dishes.\n\nToday you'll leave Oslo behind and take the train across the stunning countryside to Trondheim. Trondheim was the first capital of Norway (although some historians would argue that) and remains the city where kings go through their coronation. Its name translates as 'a good place to live', with 'trond' meaning 'a good place' and 'heim' home, and it truly is. The city is situated on the Trondheimsfjord and colourful wooden storehouses flank the Nidelva River that runs through town, while the city's outskirts are surrounded by hilly wilderness. There are some great seafood restaurants in town, so why not venture out with the group for a bite to eat in the evening?\n\nThe forested Bymarka awaits you today – a large nature reserve in Trondheim’s west. Take an easy walk around Lianvatnet, a freshwater lake surrounded by grassy slopes and shady paths. Enjoy a picnic lunch by the lake before free time to explore Bymarka further or return to the centre of Trondheim for sightseeing at leisure. An absolute must-see is the Nidaros Cathedral, an immense Gothic cathedral built from 1070 on, which remains the northernmost Gothic structure in Europe. Quite simply, it's incredible. There are several museums to visit including the Archbishop's Palace, which contains the real Crown Jewels, and the Rockheim Museum, providing a history of Norwegian pop music since the 1950s. In the evening walk over to the nearby station for an overnight train to Bodo, departing just before midnight.\n\nWake up just north of the Arctic Circle as we pull into the town of Bodø this morning. There's ample time for you to explore this interesting town until we leave on the afternoon ferry to Svolvaer on the Lofoten Islands. Bodø is a modern city as it was rebuilt after essentially being destroyed by German bombers during WWII. With a dramatic backdrop of rugged ranges, Bodø has the densest population of white-tailed sea eagles in the world, so once you're done exploring why not grab a drink or some food by the quay and take in the vista while these impressive birds circle above (just watch your food). Board the afternoon ferry to the Lofoten Islands. After arriving late in the evening, settle into your comfortable accommodation in the town of Svolvaer.\n\nThe Lofoten Islands are known for picturesque fishing villages, pristine nature and, of course, the Midnight Sun. This is viking country, and the beauty of the area is unparalleled and near-impossible to convey in words. Svolvaer, one of the main towns on the islands, relies heavily on fishing and an ever-growing tourism industry as it's used as a primary base to explore the other islands. This morning head out on an excursion by RIB (rigid inflatable boat) to the narrow and steep-sided Trollfjord. On this exhilarating trip around the small islands and skerries of the Raftsundet Strait, you'll also get the chance to see sea eagles, it’s a special experience when one circles just a few metres above your head. The afternoon is free to explore as you wish and there are several optional activities for you to choose from. Perhaps enjoy a sea kayaking trip around Svolvaer's picture-perfect harbour (subject to availability) or hike through the dramatic granite peaks jutting out of the ocean.\n\nToday, after breakfast, enjoy a hike to Linken peak (105 m above the sea level). This is a picturesque and easy hike (approximately 2 hours) that offers beautiful views of the surrounding mountains and the sea. For those who are up for a further challenge and exercise your leader can additionally take you for Tjeldbergtinden hike to enjoy a spectacular view over the sea and fjords and Svolvær city below. Those feeling less energetic can return to Svolvaer after the Linken Peak hike and enjoy the rest of the day at your leisure.\n\nDepart the Lofoten Islands on a long but scenic travel day to Tromsø. Start with a local bus ride to Harstad, you'll have some free time here so perhaps take your time for lunch or explore the little town. Later on continue by local ferry past stunning scenery, plenty of fjords and even a maelstrom to Tromsø. Located far above the Arctic Circle, Tromsø is northern Norway's major cultural centre thanks to a range of music and arts festivals and an increasing student population courtesy of the University of Tromsø. Enjoy a free evening on arrival in town.\n\nThis morning, start exploring Tromsø on an e-bike tour and learn about life north of the Arctic Circle. You'll stop at some of the local's favourite city sites like MS Polstjerna, an extremely well-preserved vessel that took part in seal hunting (entry not included), an old farmstead from the 19th century, Prestvannet, the biggest lake on the island and more. Then, explore Tromsø at your leisure. Perhaps learn about the region's fascinating history at the Polar Museum and Tromsø Museum, check out the many art galleries or take a boat cruise in the surrounding waters (the city is actually built on an island). No visit to Tromsø would be complete without a beer at the city's oldest pub, Olhallen, part of the Mack Brewery that is even older than the pub. It was founded by Ludwig Mack, a baker who cared not for the drunkenness of the townsfolk. Mack started brewing beer in 1877 as a less alcoholic alternative to the spirits drunk by most. The brewery is still family-owned and frequented by young and old, traveller and local, student and teacher. Perhaps meet in the evening for an optional final group dinner together."
