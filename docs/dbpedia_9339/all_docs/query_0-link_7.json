        "text": "Scandinavia is known around the world for its outdoor attractions. The northern lights in the north of Sweden and Norway, the Norwegian fjords, the Scandinavian mountains and the wonderful cycling on offer in Denmark are just a few of the highlights.\n\nYet the capital cities are packed with historical and cultural attractions, cutting-edge design and outdoor experiences of their own. Stockholm, Copenhagen and Oslo all have a lot to offer the curious traveler that wants to scratch under the surface of Scandinavian lifestyle.\n\nThe capital of Scandinavia?\n\nDespite what an advertising campaign in Stockholm would have you believe, there is no single Scandinavia capital. Each nation’s capital city Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm compete for attention on a global scale.\n\nInstead of picking just one, it’s easy to visit two or all three Scandinavian capital cities. Multiple direct flights per day from SAS and Norwegian shuttle business and leisure travelers between the three cities, while those on a budget should consider the rail network. Traveling through Scandinavia by train is generally cheaper than flying, plus you get to enjoy scenic views for much of the journey.\n\nStockholm, Sweden\n\nBuilt over several islands, Sweden’s capital city Stockholm is packed with historic and cultural attractions. It’s also an emerging art and design hub with some fantastic museums and galleries, including the art-packed metro system.\n\nPublic transit is usually little more than a method of getting from a to b, but in Stockholm the entire metro network doubles as an art gallery. Most of the stations are decorated with sculptures, mosaics and other art installations. More than 150 artists have contributed to the project so far.\n\nStart your exploration of above-ground Stockholm at the old town, Gamla Stan. The most picturesque part of the city is packed with narrow alleys, boutiques and historic architecture. The Stockholm exhibition at the nearby City Museum is a must-see to understand more about this district and the city’s development.\n\nThe Vasa museum houses the incredible Vasa warship that sank just minutes into its maiden voyage. One look at the top-heavy wooden carvings and you’ll understand why. Music lovers travel from across the world to visit the ABBA Museum and as such, advance booking here is a must.\n\nIf you prefer a more relaxing city break, join one of the many passenger ferries or tour boats to explore the vast Stockholm archipelago. Spending a few days island hopping is the best way to appreciate the diversity but day trips are more feasible for most travelers.\n\nThe laidback Möja is a good choice. It’s just one hour from Stockholm and there’s bikes and kayaks available to rent, or many trails to explore. Vaxholm is a popular alternative is time is short as the island with its charming old town is also accessible by car.\n\nCopenhagen, Denmark\n\nArguably the easiest to reach by air from North America, Copenhagen is the starting point for many international travelers.\n\nThe family-friendly Danish capital is packed with attractions that will make you want to stick around for longer, including the historic Tivoli Gardens amusement park, Frederiksberg Palace and Rosenborg Castle.\n\nThe National Museum of Denmark is a great place to start for history lovers. It tells the story of how the nation came to be, including the acclaimed Viking Age attraction The Raid and the legendary Viking ship Roskilde 6.\n\nClose to Copenhagen Airport, the Blue Planet is northern Europe’s largest aquarium known for its striking whirlpool-inspired architecture and the imposing hammerhead sharks that live within.\n\nOther visitors may prefer to explore the thriving dining scene. The Copenhagen region is home to an astonishing 15 Michelin star restaurants for which you’ll need to reserve a table well in advance, but many people will be just as happy enjoying a coffee and cake in one of the many sidewalk cafes.\n\nCopenhagen is one of the most cycling-friendly cities in Europe and bike rental is commonplace throughout the city. Suggested routes include the Nordhavn art route, the 8-mile harbour circle, and the 19-mile tour through the suburbs and forests of Copenhagen in search of the six wooden giants. Families needn’t miss out on simpler rides through the city as bikes with front-facing seats for your youngest are freely available.\n\nThanks to the Øresund bridge, a day trip into Sweden is a breeze. The Swedish city Malmö is just 35 minutes away by train and offers a\n\nOslo, Norway\n\nWith the recent opening of two major art museums, the latest step in Oslo’s dramatic waterfront transformation is complete. Over the past 20 years, the district has slowly transformed from industrial eyesore to culture hotspot, attracting a different kind of tourist to the Norwegian capital.\n\nThe new waterfront promenade links cultural buildings including a modern library, opera house, the colossal new National Museum and an entire gallery dedicated to Norwegian artist Edvard Munch. Despite the controversial architecture choices, both new art museums have made a striking impression on the global art world.\n\nDespite all the development on the waterfront, Vigeland Sculpture Park remains the city’s top tourist attraction. Hundreds of sculptures—the life’s work of sculptor Gustav Vigeland—are set within open parkland in western Oslo.\n\nThe tall monolith is the deserved centerpiece but there is so much of interest throughout the park that you should allow at least one hour, possibly two, to make the most of your visit.\n\nAs the park suggests, it’s outdoor attractions where Oslo truly shines. From the diverse islands of the Oslofjord to the forest that surrounds the city, Oslo locals make the most of nature’s playground.\n\nSmall passenger ferries putter between the islands throughout the week. Hovedøya, just five minutes from the city hall, is full of nature trails, historic sites and bathing spots, while Lindøya is dotted with a few hundred colorful vacation cabins and is buzzing with life during the summer. Alternatively, ride the Oslo metro up to Frognerseteren to explore the many hiking and cross-country skiing trails of the vast forest Nordmarka.\n\nWhen you’re ready to leave Oslo, consider a ride on the Bergen line railway. The scenic 300-mile journey is the highest passenger rail journey in Northern Europe, crossing the northern edge of the Hardangervidda mountain plateau at a height of more than 4,000 feet above sea level."
