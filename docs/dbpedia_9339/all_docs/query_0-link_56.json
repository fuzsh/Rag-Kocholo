        "text": "Quirky cities filled with delish food, fascinating culture and the most attractive people you’ve ever seen – welcome to Scandinavia! Touch down in Copenhagen and say ‘hej’ (pronounced ‘hi’ = win) to the fellow explorers sharing the ride. Then: get pumped for the adventure at our first group dinner. This is gonna be good...\n\nMeals\n\nDinner\n\nReady to be versed in all things Copenhagen by our on-road expert? We’ll kick things off today with a walking tour – hitting the likes of City Hall, Nyhavn and the National Musuem of Denmark. Then: make like Dora and get exploring! Jump aboard an optional canal tour (those rainbow-coloured townhouses need #nofilter – trust us). Hire a bike and explore this chilled-out Scandi city on two wheels. Tuck into a smorgasbord of Nordic cuisine. Discover the city’s thriving craft beer scene. Or go vintage with a visit to Tivoli Gardens – an OG amusement park and the inspo for Disney World. Time it right, and you can take in the sunset from the top of the giant chair swing. Cue: alllll the goosebumps.\n\nActivities\n\nWalking tour of Copenhagen with Trip Leader\n\nMeals\n\nBreakfast\n\nYour Options\n\nCanal tour: from €12\n\nVisit Tivoli Gardens amusement park: from €16\n\nWave ‘hej hej’ to Copenhagen (yep, it’s ‘hi’ twice – we don’t make the rules). Today we’ve got Sweden in our sights – specifically the canal-packed seaside city of Gothenburg. When we roll in, we’ll take to the water on a Paddan boat tour. Expect: a 17th-century moat, a LOT of bridges and historical facts galore. Then? The arvo’s all yours. Need local tips? Your Trip Leader’s got ‘em. Get your culture fix at Gothenburg Museum of Art. Perfect those panos from the viewpoint at Skansen Kronan fortress. Or seek out a traditional cinnamon bun the size of your head. This evening: gather your trip mates and head to Tredje Langgatan street for good grub, good wine and good company. Guaranteed.\n\nActivities\n\nPaddan boat tour\n\nMeals\n\nBreakfast\n\nSay bye to the ‘burg – we’re on the move after brekkie. Oslo, we’re coming for ya! When we pull into Norway’s iconic capital, our in-the-know Trip Leader will point out the must-sees for our free day tomorrow. And then? Round up the group and head to a local haunt for some pølse – hot dogs wrapped in potatoey tortilla blankets. Yes please. Hunt down Illegal Burger for the best one you’ve ever had. Period. Or hop onto an optional dinner cruise and have a full-on foodie experience as you sway along the Oslofjord.\n\nActivities\n\nOrientation walk of Oslo with Trip Leader\n\nMeals\n\nBreakfast\n\nYour Options\n\nDinner cruise in Oslo: prices available locally\n\nYou wanted time to delve deeper. So here it is – Oslo-style! Our suggestions? Get to the water for some awesome kayaking. Check out medieval Akershus Fortress. Get steamy in a local sauna (they’re everywhere). Or make a beeline for Bygdøy (aka Museum Island). We’re talking the Kon-Tiki Museum, Fram Polar Ship, Norsk Folkemuseum and the Viking Ship Museum (obvs). Get the ferry back to Oslo port in time for tonight’s included group dinner. And later? Spice up your life with a glass of aquavit (the local tipple) at uber-cool Himkok bar. Think gin, but herbier.\n\nMeals\n\nBreakfast\n\nDinner\n\nShotgun a window seat. We’re heading west this morning – and the scenery that whizzes past is Out. Of. This. World. Expect jaw-dropping mountain passes, sparkling fjords and a sprinkling of rustic red cabins. You won’t find landscapes like this back home. Want another natural wonder thrown into the mix? Of course you do. We’ll treat our peepers to Vøringsfossen Waterfall en route – 182 metres of crashing, splashing awesomeness. When we jump off the minicoach in Bergen, wrap your lips around a stack of raspeballer dumplings for dinner. Mmmm...\n\nActivities\n\nVisit Vøringsfossen Waterfall\n\nMeals\n\nBreakfast\n\nToday’s your day, your way. Time to delve deeper into ‘the city of seven mountains’ (and 200 days of rain a year – hope you’ve packed your jacket). Need pointing in the right direction? Your expert Trip Leader’s ON it. Wander the cobbled streets and check out the traditional wooden houses. Sample the local salmon at Bergen Fish Market – FYI this place has been around since 1276 (but the fish have changed since then). Or tuck into a reindeer sausage at Trekroneren hot-dog hut. Sorry Rudolph.\n\nMeals\n\nBreakfast\n\nWarning: our next drive contains scenes which some viewers made find INCREDible. After another included brekkie, settle in for more beaut mountain-meets-water views as we wind our way up to the Norwegian Fjordlands. A hop, skip and a short ferry ride across the Sognefjord later, this watery wonderland is yours to discover! Our hot (correction: cold) tip? Soak up all the snow-capped, fairytale-style wildness in Norway’s capital of adrenaline, Voss. Best way to get started? An optional guided tour of the river and its surroundings by canoe. Tonight: swap stories over our included group dinner.\n\nActivities\n\nFerry to the Fjordlands\n\nMeals\n\nBreakfast\n\nDinner\n\nYour Options\n\nRiver canoe tour in Voss: prices available locally\n\nHear that? That’s the sound of a free day in the mind-blowing Fjordlands. Get that thrill-seeking heart ready for some addictive adventuring. Take to two wheels and W-O-W your way past soaring mountains and glistening glaciers. Grab your mates and show the rushing river you mean business (again if yesterday’s optional wasn’t enough) on a whitewater raft. Sharpen your tools, sling on your boots and head to Mølstertunet at Voss Folk Museum for a REAL insight into farming traditions in the area between 1500 and 1927. Or hop on a cruise AND ride the Flåmsbana train. Beaut views. Relaxed vibes. And UNESCO-approved heritage in one BIG package.\n\nMeals\n\nBreakfast\n\nYour Options\n\nFjordcruise and historical Flåmsbana train ride: from €210\n\nTime to tunnel outta here. This morning we’re heading eastwards via the Lærdal Tunnel – the world’s longest road tunnel. Then: Lillehammer’s calling! Our fact-filled Trip Leader will give us the run around the Netflix-famed ski town on an orientation walk. Next: put those included chairlift tix to good use (read: their only use) and feast your eyes on allllll the city-and-lake panos from the top of Lysgårdsbakkene ski jump. And after? Get some puppy lovin’ at a local husky kennel. These beauts love to get visitors. Cue alll the tail wagging, wet kisses and the possibility that you’ll never wanna leave. Ever.\n\nActivities\n\nOrientation walk of Lillehammer with Trip Leader\n\nChairlift up Lysgårdsbakkene ski jump\n\nMeals\n\nBreakfast\n\nYour Options\n\nVisit Nordic husky kennel: from €50\n\nDust off those brekkie crumbs and say so long to ski-ville – today it’s time for Sweden: Part Two. Ngl, we've got a bit of a drive. BUT it’s the perfect opportunity to text the ‘rents, catch some zzzs or simply soak up all the screensaver-worthy scenery that fills the coach window. Our home for the eve? The medieval city of Örebro in the heart of the Swedish lakes region. Engage explorer mode and check out the Disney-vibes castle. Then ask you-know-who for dinner recommendations (your Trip Leader, not Voldemort).\n\nMeals\n\nBreakfast\n\nOnwards! This morning we’re making tracks for the iconic Scandi city of Stockholm. Fun fact: this place is built on an archipelago of 14 islands where the Lake Mälaren flows out to the Baltic Sea. Cool, right? After our Trip Leader helps us get our bearings, grab a kanebullar for the road and go explore! Snap a pic at Stortorget and watch the changing of the guard at The Palace. Take the ferry across to Djurgården and hit up the Vasa Museum (a must), Skansen Museum and the ABBA Museum. Or head to ultra-hip Södermalm for a local vibe and trendy cafes. Whatever you choose, make sure you’re back in time for tonight’s group dinner – we’re going to give this Scandi adventure the send-off it deserves!\n\nActivities\n\nOrientation walk of Stockholm with Trip Leader\n\nMeals\n\nBreakfast\n\nDinner\n\nYou came. You saw. You cultured. And just like that, it’s over. Get down to breakfast and swap those socials – you’re gonna need them for next year’s reunion trip. Where to next?\n\nMeals\n\nBreakfast\n\nThe trip leader Kate was an exceptional guide. She found the perfect balance of fun, professional and informative. This was my third top deck trip and have found the better the trip leader the better the experience. The locations visited were also chosen well the only improvement would be maybe more time in fjordlands."
