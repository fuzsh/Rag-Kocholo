        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe region of northern Europe made up of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is called Scandinavia. Its people are known for their rugged pioneer spirit as well as their quest for international peace. The term Scandinavia sometimes includes Finland; Iceland; and the Faroe Islands, which are part of Denmark, though a self-governing region.\n\nSweden and Norway occupy the Scandinavian peninsula and many small, nearby islands. Denmark comprises the Jylland, or Jutland, peninsula just north of Germany; two large islands called Fyn, or Fünen, and Själland, or Zealand; and 483 smaller islands. The name Scandinavia comes from that of a region in southern Sweden called Skåne or Scania. The terms Norden and Nordic, both meaning “North,” have also been used to refer collectively to the five Scandinavian countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands).\n\nThe terrain of Scandinavia ranges from the flatlands of Denmark to the forests and rivers of Sweden to the fjords (narrow arms of the sea that extend inland) of Norway. The surrounding bodies of water include the Norwegian, North, and Baltic seas. The highest peak in the region is Glittertinden—at 8,084 feet (2,464 meters)—in Norway.\n\nThe Fennoscandian Shield is an area of geologically old basement rock that reaches from the Kola Peninsula of Russia westward through Finland, Sweden, and Norway. These three countries are also part of the Northwest Highlands. Rivers in southern Norway and in eastern Sweden—such as the Ljungan, which empties into the Gulf of Bothnia—provide considerable hydroelectric power. Tundra and beautiful fjords, the longest of which is the Sognafjorden, fringe the coasts of Norway.\n\nDenmark and the southernmost part of Sweden lie in the European Lowlands, a geologic area interrupted only by hills formed by glaciers. The soil of eastern Denmark is rich and fertile. Most of Iceland’s surface is either volcanic or covered with snow or glaciers.\n\nDespite Scandinavia’s far northern latitude, most of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden has a moderate climate tempered by the waters of the North Atlantic Current. Bergen, on the west coast of Norway, has an average temperature of 35° F (1.7° C) in January and 61° F (16.1° C) in July. Only in the most remote inland areas of Scandinavia are the winters harsh.\n\nPeople and Cultures\n\nThe combined area of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden is more than 315,000 square miles (816,800 square kilometers). Sweden is both the largest and most populous of the three. Denmark, the smallest country, is several times more densely populated than the other two. Much of the population is concentrated in southern Scandinavia, known as the Öresund area, comprising Skåne and Själland. The largest cities are Copenhagen, Denmark; Oslo, Norway; and Stockholm, Sweden. Each is a national capital and a lively cosmopolitan center.\n\nThe Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish languages developed by ad 1000 from dialects of Common Scandinavian. Today similarities in vocabulary and grammar allow speakers of the three languages to communicate with each other. By contrast, the Icelandic and Faroese languages remain similar to Old Norse and are largely unintelligible to speakers of Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. Finnish is unrelated to the Scandinavian languages.\n\nLiteracy is virtually 100 percent. Institutions of higher education include the universities in Stockholm; Göteborg, Sweden; Oslo; Copenhagen; and Århus, Denmark. Lutheranism is the official state religion of all three countries.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Vikings, or Norsemen, lived in what are now Denmark, Norway, and Sweden from about ad 740 to 1050. Fierce bands of Viking men sailed across the North Sea to raid the coasts of Britain, Ireland, and France. Many of the Norsemen went westward to Iceland and, starting with Erik the Red, to Greenland. Erik’s son Leif Eriksson was the first European to visit the North American mainland, in about ad 1000.\n\nAfter the Viking era the kingdoms of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark expanded their power closer to home, but by the 1300s Norway came under Danish control. In 1397 the Union of Kalmar, established by the Danish queen, Margret, joined the three countries; the Swedes withdrew in 1523. Norway was ceded to Sweden in 1814. The Norwegian parliament voted in 1905 to become independent; despite expectations, war between the two countries was averted. Iceland, though linked to Denmark until 1944, became a sovereign nation in 1919. All the Scandinavian countries remained neutral during World War I; Denmark and Norway were occupied by Germany during World War II."
