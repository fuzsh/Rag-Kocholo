        "text": "Come with us to explore some of the world's most exotic destinations. Marvel at all the must-see spots, plus discover local color and off-the-beaten-path cultural experiences.\n\nGet our digital catalog\n\nItching to get out and travel, but not sure which destinations are open?\n\nSee where you can go now\n\nStart the day with a hands-on Danish cooking class! Learn the art of making a traditional Danish smørrebrød, an open-faced sandwich that Danes considered the best in the world. With toppings prepared and bread sliced, assemble and decorate your smørrebrød that appeals to your eyes and taste buds! Your class concludes with a \"hygge\" communal lunch, where you will come together and dine on your specially made sandwich.\n\nAfter lunch, meet with a local expert and enjoy a city tour. Embrace the spirit of hygge, how the Danish define togetherness and happiness, and discover the charm of one of Copenhagen's most iconic locales in Nyhavn. Stroll along the canal and view the colorful-lined houses as you feel the relaxed atmosphere that is quintessential Copenhagen. As you walk along the water, don't forget to look for house number 20. Once belonging to famed Danish poet and writer Hans C Andersen, he reminds us of the importance of travel with his notable quote, \"To travel is to live.\"\n\nAndersen is also the inspiration for another famous landmark on your walking tour: the Little Mermaid statue. Learn more about the fairy-tale story and the history behind this famed statue. Then, continue to the home of the Danish royal family at the Royal Amalienborg Palace. Experience the enthralling charms of past and present and embrace the history behind one of the world's oldest monarchies.\n\nAfter breakfast, explore Copenhagen from a different perspective and enjoy a cruise through the city's idyllic canals. Take in new and exciting views while learning more about the beautiful churches, houses, and landmarks that make up the city.\n\nThe rest of your afternoon is free at leisure to explore further, shop for Viking souvenirs, enjoy lunch in Nyhavn, or relax. Later, embark on an overnight cruise to Oslo, Norway. Dinner is included on the ship tonight.\n\nUpon arrival in Norway, disembark and enjoy a sightseeing tour of Oslo, a brimming metropolitan city rich in world-class art, architecture, museums, and restaurants. Journey to Frogner Park and marvel at the over 200 unique sculptures created by Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland. Continue to the picturesque Royal Palace, the splendid City Hall, and the medieval Askerhus Fortress. Then, visit The Fram Museum, home of The Fram, the first ship built especially for polar research. Experience life on the boat with 270-degree surround sound film while on the ship's deck.\n\nLater this afternoon, visit the Holmenkollen Ski Jump & Museum. Magnificently protruding into the air, the ski jump provides a unique vantage point over the city of Oslo. Get your camera ready as you head to the top of the ski jump to witness this view. Considered to be a dominant country in the Winter Olympics, discover why Norwegians love their winter sports and see over 4,000 years' worth of skiing, snowboarding, and polar exploration artifacts at the museum.\n\nThis morning, leave behind the city and venture towards Norway's stunning fjords. Travel by train from Oslo to the town of Myrdal and board the famous Flåm Railway. The train journey takes you through a breathtaking array of steep mountains, cascading waterfalls, and local villages intertwined with nature. No matter which side of the train you are on, incredible views await!\n\nExplore the village of Flåm at your leisure before visiting a local brewery. Learn more about traditional Norwegian beer making, engage in a fascinating storytelling presentation with the owners, and indulge in a sampling of five different types of beer. Join your fellow travelers for a delicious dinner at your hotel this evening.\n\nThis morning, get ready for an unforgettable experience as you board a cruise through Nærøyfjord, one of Norway's most spectacular and awe-inspiring fjords. A UNESCO world heritage site, it is a bucket list item for many with its overload of scenic, striking mountains, and valleys. Your boat smoothly glides you along the water and presents many opportunities for pictures. It is encouraged to climb to your boat's top deck to maximize your experience!\n\nDisembark in the town of Gudvangen and take the shuttle back to Flåm, where you have additional time at leisure. Depart by train and make your way towards Bergen. This will also allow you to take in the panoramic views of the Flåm railway for a second time!\n\nToday, enjoy a morning walking tour of Bergen with a local expert. Considered the \"heart of the fjords,\" Bergen is the second-largest city in Norway but still retains a small-town charm and character. Visit Hanseatic Bryggen, located along the waterfront with its signature brightly colored facades. A UNESCO world heritage site, step up close and take notice of the slight lean in a few of the houses that add to its authenticity and historical resolve. Continue to the Church of Mary, the oldest building in Bergen, and the nearby Hakon Fortress before visiting the Bergen fish market. For generations, the fish market has been a place of fundamental importance for merchants and fishers alike. Today it is home to some of the world's freshest fish and seafood.\n\nA trip up the Fløibanen funicular awaits as you reach Mount Fløyen for a sensational panoramic view of the city. Step onto the large viewing platform and snap as many pictures as you'd like of the city below, and take in the sweet smell of a freshly baked cinnamon bun at one of the cafes at the top. The rest of the day is free to explore Bergen further on your own.\n\nAfter breakfast, enjoy a walking tour of the vibrant city of Stockholm, referred to as the \"Venice of the North,\" with its intertwining waterways. Visit Gamla Stan, one of Northern Europe's oldest and most well-preserved old towns. Pass along the cobblestone streets and crooked but beautifully preserved medieval houses as you take in the friendly setting. Visit the official home of the Swedish monarch in the baroque-style Royal Palace, as well as the lavishly designed interior of Stockholm's City Hall. Then, stop for a sweet treat at a local cafe for a traditional Swedish Fika coffee and cake break.\n\nNext, step inside the Vasa Museum, housing the only preserved 17th-century ship in the world, The Vasa. Having sunk on its maiden voyage from Stockholm in 1628, more than 95 percent of the ship and its intricate outer design have been recovered and restored. Witness its substantial size and learn more about its incredible first voyage.\n\nEnjoy a delicious farewell dinner with beer or wine while recounting the incredible memories made during your time in Scandinavia."
