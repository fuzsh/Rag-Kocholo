        "text": "Following the surrender of Germany and Japan in 1945, the world community faced the major task of re-establishing diplomatic and international co-operation, while avoiding the escalation of conflicts and aggressive nationalism. The depression of the 1930s and the Second World War, with its huge civilian and economic losses, were viewed as failures of international economic co-operation and political diplomacy. However, the post-war period soon became defined by new conflicts, and with the onset of the Cold War from 1946–1947 Denmark had to navigate a new context of bloc formations and international organisations. Denmark’s foreign and economic policy was to orient itself towards the West through membership of NATO and the European Community, and to establish tighter Nordic co-operation. Its foreign and security policy after 1945 was thus largely defined by its relations to these inter-governmental and supranational organisations.\n\nThe Cold War and new alliances\n\nThe period from 1914 to 1945 is sometimes seen as one continuous era of international conflict, culminating in the Second World War. ‘No more war’ was therefore the slogan for politicians and weary populations in the immediate post-war years. Hopes of peace were dashed, however, by ideological tensions and overlapping spheres of interest, particularly for the two countries that became major post-war powers: the USA and the USSR. These were ‘superpowers’, to use the new word coined to describe these global heavyweights, and thus even larger and more powerful than the traditional political and economic great powers like Britain, France and Germany, which had built up strong states, empires and alliances in the nineteenth century.\n\nThe four allied great powers had met during the Second World War to discuss spheres of interest and possible solutions. At the Bretton Woods Conference in July 1944, Britain, France and the USA agreed on new international economic rules to try to avoid a return to the economic instability of the inter-war period, and at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 they were joined by the USSR to agree on geopolitical spheres of interest. In the immediate post-war years, efforts were made to build bridges between the Allies of the Second World War. The hope was that an organisation for effective inter-governmental collaboration could be founded in order to reduce conflict and prevent a new war, unlike the failed League of Nations of the inter-war period.\n\nThe United Nations (UN) was established on 24 October 1945. It was intended to be a collective security organisation, but dialogue and collaboration were disrupted in the face of growing antagonisms, aggressive military actions and mistrust between the allied Western powers and the communist USSR. The years 1946–1947 therefore marked the beginning of the Cold War.\n\nIn 1949, the North Atlantic Pact (from 1950 the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO) was set up as a defence alliance for the USA, Canada and ten western European countries, including Denmark. Following West Germany’s accession in 1955, NATO was countered by the Warsaw Pact, which united the USSR and the eastern European communist countries in a joint military alliance. At the same time Denmark had to navigate an increasing number of western European political and economic co-operative frameworks. These included the Organisation of European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), of which Denmark was a member 1948–1959; the Council of Europe, which Denmark joined at its inauguration in 1949; and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which Denmark joined at its inauguration in 1960, but left again in 1972. Finally, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the European Economic Community (EEC) and Euratom became the European Communities (EC) in 1967, and Denmark became a member in 1973 together with Britain and Ireland.\n\nThe four cornerstones of Danish foreign policy\n\nThe driving force behind much of the Social Democratic Party’s policy in the post-war era was the politician Per Hækkerup. He was foreign minister between 1962 and 1966, and published the book Danmarks Udenrigspolitik (Denmark’s Foreign Policy) in 1965, in which he presented Danish foreign policy from historical, geostrategic, military and political perspectives. According to his interpretation, Danish post-war foreign policy had four cornerstones: NATO, the United Nations (UN), Europe and the Nordic countries. While security was to be addressed through NATO and partly in the UN, foreign economic and trade policy was handled in the European and Nordic spheres, while the promotion of peace and other values took place in the UN and through Nordic co-operation. Through the various institutional frameworks linked to these four cornerstones, Danish foreign policy was cast in a new mould, representing a clear break with the tradition of neutrality and non-alignment that had guided Denmark during the First World War, the interwar period and the German occupation.\n\nThis slightly unfamiliar perspective on the northern hemisphere shows the importance of Greenland – and thus the Thule Air Base – for American security policy. The red lines depict possible missile routes for the two superpowers during the Cold War. Greenland was located midway between the strategically and politically important areas in the east of the USA (Washington and New York) and the west of the USSR (Moscow and Leningrad – present-day St Petersburg). Illustration: Hans Møller\n\nFollowing a plane crash in 1968, it became known that part of the American Arctic defence included overflights by B-52 bombers armed with nuclear weapons. These planes were part of a global airborne alert programme which included permanent overflights of Greenland and constant visual contact with Thule, as a safety supplement to telecommunication with the base. The plane crash demonstrated the Danish double standard on nuclear weapons: no to nukes in Denmark, yes to them in Greenland. However, the Danish government seized on the crash as an opportunity to pressurise the American government into terminating the double standard, even though the latter was very critical of the Danish move. In 1969 both countries agreed on a supplement to the 1951 defence agreement which banned nuclear weapons in Greenland in peacetime. Archival studies made after the end of the Cold War have further shown that the Danish government knew about the presence of nuclear weapons on the American airbase at Thule from 1957, and accepted it through secret agreements.\n\nEuropean political and economic collaboration: visions and realities\n\nThe experiences of the world wars and the inter-war period created the background for new military co-operation, accompanied by efforts to establish closer political and economic co-operation in Europe. After decades of war, conflicts and economic crises, people believed that closer co-operation could prevent aggressive nationalism, promote democracy, boost the economy and increase European welfare. Joint European efforts in this regard were initially thwarted because of the Cold War, which divided Europe into the East and the West on either side of the Iron Curtain, but these intentions were soon to be realized in western Europe.\n\nThe idea of a political federation was abandoned, since France and Britain were against it. However, in 1949, ten western European states – including Denmark – formed the Council of Europe, an inter-governmental organisation focusing on political areas like democracy, human rights and the rule of law. European federalists were very disappointed at the limited ambitions of the Council of Europe, and so was France. The French government became increasingly worried about the plans of the USA and Britain to re-arm West Germany, which had been formed as a new state in 1949. Therefore, the French government presented two plans, the first for the creation of a Coal and Steel Community and the second for a European Defence Community. Both were aimed at securing control of West German rearmament and defence capabilities.\n\nThe Defence Community never materialised, but in 1952 Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany formed the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). This union established supranational collaboration and a common market for important economic and industrial areas; it was unprecedented in a European context, since it involved the transfer of national sovereignty and decision-making authority to joint institutions. For many years, national sovereignty had been a key part of the foreign and domestic policy of European countries. Even though countries in the ECSC only had to surrender their sovereignty in limited areas, the union represented a new type of co-operation, which over time came to be known as ‘European integration’. Danish governments followed the development of the ECSC very closely, but decided not to opt for membership because Britain and the other Scandinavian countries had no intentions of joining.\n\nThe EEC and the EC: European integration with Denmark on the sidelines\n\nIn 1957, following the establishment of the ECSC as a supranational institution, the Treaty of Rome was signed by the same six countries, leading to the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1958. The aim of the EEC was to promote economic integration, create a common market and establish a customs union among the members. Development was slow and marked by many obstacles and clashes between national interests, especially concerning the degree of national obligations and the supranational nature of the co-operation. In 1967, a merger brought together the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community to form the European Community (EC).\n\nGrowing European integration became an important part of Danish foreign and domestic policy in the 1950s and 1960s, even though Denmark did not become a member of the EC until 1973. Immediately after the end of the Second World War, there were hopes of establishing a common Nordic organisation for economic co-operation, similar to the defence co-operation ideas. These ambitions were never fully realised, though the founding of the Nordic Council (1952) paved the way for the Helsinki Treaty (1962) and the Nordic Council of Ministers (1971), establishing Nordic co-operation on economic issues, the labour market and cultural affairs.\n\nIn parallel with this Nordic development, Denmark began working to become a member of the EC, together with Britain, Ireland and Norway. Traditionally, Denmark had enjoyed extensive and important mutual trade with Britain, so joining the EC without Britain made little sense. At the same time, Denmark could not ignore the booming economic development (Wirtschaftswunder) of neighbouring West Germany, and thus became less reluctant to enter into economic co-operation with the former occupying power, which was now a growing export market. The EC’s common agricultural policy was particularly attractive for Denmark, since its price guarantees and subsidies promised new opportunities for one of the most important Danish export sectors.\n\nThe president of France, Charles de Gaulle, was fiercely opposed to British membership and vetoed the negotiations in 1963 and 1967, which also stalled Denmark’s application. Denmark was left in the uncomfortable position of holding a seat in what has been called ‘the European waiting room’. With de Gaulle’s departure in 1969, British membership became a real possibility, which led to Denmark starting accession negotiations with the EC in 1970.\n\nDenmark’s entry into the EC, 1972–1973\n\nIf Denmark had been able to join the EC at the beginning of the 1960s, it would have been possible to do so without a referendum under the 1953 constitution, because 5/6 of the Folketing supported the decision at that time. The parliamentary situation was different in 1972, however, meaning that the proposal for Denmark to become a member of the EC had to be put to a referendum. This took place on 2 October 1972.\n\nThe debate leading up to the referendum was intense, and the opposing sides were keen to underline their differences. Opponents of EC membership spanned the entire political spectrum, but the main opposition came from the left, while the Social Democrats were divided on the issue. Arguments against joining the EC were primarily political-cultural, centring on the fear of losing national sovereignty. Arguments included scepticism towards joining a union dominated by Germany or even neo-Nazis, and by Catholics. The left wing and parts of the labour movement had concerns about letting foreigners into the labour market and feared the dominance of big capital. In general the fear was widespread that Denmark as a nation risked losing its status as a small, independent, harmonious and prosperous welfare state.\n\nWhile the ‘no’ side used political arguments, the ‘yes’ side overwhelmingly employed economic arguments (higher pork prices, better market access and in general a stronger financial platform for funding the welfare state). In the referendum, 63.3% voted ‘yes’ and 36.7% voted ‘no’, meaning that, Denmark became a member of the European Community from 1 January 1973. A few days after the referendum, the French newspaper Le Monde described Denmark’s entry as ‘a marriage of convenience’, in which the ‘yes’ vote was interpreted as an expression of economic realism and consideration for Danish exports, rather than as a sign of Danish enthusiasm for the European political project. This analysis has proved to be relevant for much of Danish EC/EU policy since.\n\nBoth the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ sides put much effort into the referendum campaigns on Danish membership of the EC in October 1972. This picture shows a pamphlet issued by the Danish Red Stockings (Rødstrømperne) EC group, which argued that people should vote ‘no’ by emotively claiming that Danish families would be split up because fathers would be forced to take jobs as guest workers in German industry. The main message in the rest of the pamphlet was that, for the Danish population, EC membership would lead to lower incomes, higher prices and rising unemployment, as well as hampering the Danish welfare state in areas such as pensions, working conditions, equal pay and child care.

The number of developing countries grew rapidly in Africa, Asia and South America, as decolonisation and the right to self-determination meant that former colonial territories became independent – but often poor – states. Such countries were originally referred to as ‘underdeveloped countries’, later ‘developing countries’, and development aid programmes were launched that were seen as the wealthy countries’ compensation for colonial rule and an attempt to enhance global equality and security. However, the programmes were also motivated by the developed countries’ own economic interests in relation to the acquisition of raw materials, the need for labour and the expansion of export opportunities.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Danish state joined multilateral aid projects launched by the UN, the western European economic co-operation organisation OEEC (set up in 1948, from 1961 the OECD) and the World Bank (founded in 1945). Following the UN’s proclamation of the 1960s as a decade of development, in 1962 the Danish Folketing voted to establish bilateral development programmes with selected countries under the Danish International Development Agency (Danida), which became a department in the ministry of foreign affairs. The law on Denmark’s international development co-operation from 1971 established the organisational framework for aid. The emergence and development of Danish development aid with its focus on idealism, humanism and the fight against poverty can be seen as an extension and expansion of the commitment to the UN in Danish foreign policy. Together with Sweden and Norway, Denmark has been seen as a pioneer in this area, and aid became one of the guiding principles of Nordic international engagement. Denmark has also been criticised for failed projects, however, and for not fully understanding the cultural contexts of the recipient countries."
