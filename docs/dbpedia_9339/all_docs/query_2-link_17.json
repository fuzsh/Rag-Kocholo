        "text": "What is a definite departure?\n\nA departure is shown as 'Definite Departure' once it has reached a minimum number of guests. That particular departure will definitely run, barring any extraordinary circumstances.\n\nWe update these regularly, and you can book any departure. While it is highly unlikely a departure doesn't meet the minimum number of guests, you will be offered the best alternative dates or a full refund of any payment made if this is the case.\n\nIf there are ever any changes to your departure, we will contact you.\n\nHow can I book flights for my tour? What about extra hotel nights?\n\nYou can add flights and extra hotel nights directly through Trafalgar, so that everything is taken care of, leaving you to relax and enjoy your tour.\n\nIf you're booking online, once you've selected your travel dates and room type, you'll be offered an option to add extra hotel nights and flights.\n\nAlternatively, you can call us to book and one of our travel experts can advise on your options.\n\nWhat are the different kinds of experiences available?\n\nEach Trafalgar tour has a carefully-selected range of included experiences to help immerse yourself in a destination. But did you know that every tour also has a Be My Guest and MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience?\n\nBe My Guest Experiences are the original local travel experience, letting you step into the lives of hosts who will share stories about their families and communities.\n\nMAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experiences are conscious travel experiences that give back to the local communities, which support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nOur tours also include a selection of Optional Experiences which are available for an additional cost, allowing you to make your trip your own.\n\nCan I join a Trafalgar tour as a solo traveller?\n\nA guided tour is the perfect way to solo travel. You'll meet like-minded people traveling with Trafalgar, and you'll relax knowing you can travel with ease, forming genuine connections as you go.\n\nTo find out more solo room types and pricing select your preferred departure date and continue to the next page.\n\nHow can I apply my past guest discount?\n\nIt's great to have you back on board - the loyalty of our guests means everything to us.\n\nTo access your Global Tour Rewards discount, please confirm the name and date of your past trip once you've added your passenger details.
