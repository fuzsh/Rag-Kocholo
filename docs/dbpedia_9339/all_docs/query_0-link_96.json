        "text": "Stockholm, as a city, is over 700 years old and spreads across 14 islands, it is often referred to as the 'Beauty on Water'. Upon arrival, you'll make your way to your hotel and check-in. After checking in you'll have the option to embark on a 75-minute panoramic bus sightseeing tour where you'll take in the main sights of the city. In the evning, you'll also have the option to take a three-hour cruise on the S/S Stockholm during which you can enjoy dinner on board.\n\nAfter breakfast at the hotel, the day is free for you to spend as you wish to discover Stockholm. In the morning, you'll have the option to head out of the inner city and explore the maze of canals that run through it. Whilst exploring Stockholm, make sure to visit the Vasa Museum, Skansen Open Air Museum, City Hall, the Old Town (Gamla Stan) and many more. Your hotel can also provide recommendations of where to eat.\n\nFollowing breakfast at the hotel, you'll head to the train station to catch a train to Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark (the train journey will be around five hours). In the charming city of Copenhagen, one thousand years of history awaits you in the medieval streets. After checking into your hotel, you'll embark on a grand tour of the city by boat, you'll sail through the idyllic canals where you will hear stories about Copenhagen’s beautiful churches, castles and old listed houses.\n\nAfter breakfast at your hotel, you'll have the entire day to dicover Copenhagen at your own pace. You may want to take a walk down Copenhagen's main shopping street Strøget, visit the lively Nyhavn harbour and explore the many sights Copenhagen has to offer. If you're looking for something a little more structured, you can opt to go on one of two tours: the Royal Castle Tour which takes you out of the city into the countryside or the Panorama Sightseeing and Canal Tour.\n\nYour day will be free to spend as you wish to explore Copenhagen. There are many things to do here including visiting Nyhavn, a stunning district in Copenhagen home to a 17th-century waterfront, canal and beautiful brightly-coloured 17th-century and 18th-century townhouses. You may also want to visit the Tivoli Gardens, an international attraction founded in 1843, or perhaps visit the famous Little Mermaid Statue.\n\nYou'll enjoy a Scandinavian breakfast buffet onboard before arriving in Oslo at 09:30 in the morning. The Norwegian capital is beautifully situated at the head of the Oslo Fjord and surrounded by forested ridges. Before checking into your hotel, you'll have the chance to head out on a three-hour sightseeing tour by bus taking in the most important highlights of Oslo including the Vigeland Sculpture Park, the Parliament building, the Royal Palace, Karl Johan’s street and the Opera House.\n\nAfter breakfast at the hotel, you'll take a 5-hour train journey from Oslo to Myrdal. Part of the Bergen Railway, it is classed as one of the finest train journeys in the world. In Myrdal you will change to the Flåm Railway, connecting the Bergen Line to the Sognefjord. You will pass through wild and beautiful mountain scenery with waterfalls and steep mountain sides before reaching the fjord village of Flåm. Upon arrival, you'll have the afternoon to explore Flåm.\n\nYou'll spend the morning at leisure in Flåm before you depart on a two-hour fjord cruise on the Nærøyfjord to Gudvangen. The Nærøyfjord is the narrowest fjord channel in Europe and has recently been added to UNESCO’s World Heritage List. The journey continues by bus through Nærøyfjord Valley. The last part of the excursion will be by train from Voss to Bergen, Norway’s second largest city and the world’s only city surrounded by 7 mountains and 7 fjords.\n\nEven though Bergen is the second largest city in Norway, it is rather a town with the charm and atmosphere of a small town; you can walk practically everywhere in only 20 minutes and instead of tall buildings you will find wooden houses and narrow streets. Today after breakfast, you'll head out to explore the area of Hardangerfjord and the nearby towns on a bicycle. You'll have the day to explore the area surrounding the Hardangerfjord on the 25-kilometre long stretch between Utne and Herand.\n\nAfter breakfast at the hotel, your journey through this 10 day Scandinavia itinerary will come to an end. You'll leave from Bergen according to your own itinerary or perhaps you would like to combine this tour with the Hurtigruten cruise along the coast of Norway to Kirkene? The choice is yours."
