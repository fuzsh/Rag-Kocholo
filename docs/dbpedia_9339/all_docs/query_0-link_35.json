Away from its southern cities Sweden is sparsely populated over a diversely beautiful land area larger than Germany.\n\nHome At First’s Sweden travel program focuses on the country’s south, a beautiful region that is also the cultural center of Sweden.\n\nHome At First Lodging Locations for Independent Scandinavia touring in Sweden:\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\n5 CLASSIC Locations\n\nHome At First’s Classic Lodging Locations across scenic southern Sweden:\n\n• STOCKHOLM: The Capital & its Baltic Archipelago\n\n• UPPSALA: Ancient Scholastic & Ecclesiastical Center\n\n• SWEDEN’S GREAT LAKES: mid-way between the coasts\n\n• THE WEST COAST: Bohuslän & its Skerries\n\n• GOTHENBURG: Central City of Scandinavia\n\nNOTE: Except where noted, Classic À La Carte Pricing Applies to these Classic Lodging Locations in Sweden.\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\n4 ReQUEST Locations\n\nSpecial Request Lodging Locations Elsewhere in Sweden:\n\n• GOTLAND: Great Baltic Island\n\n• SKÅNE: Sweden’s far south\n\n• DALARNA: Sweden’s heartland\n\n• NORRBOTTEN: North Sweden — Lappland & the Arctic\n\nNOTE: Custom-Pricing Applies to all Lodging & Transportation elements of these Special Request Locations in Swede.:\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\nCLASSIC Locations\n\nEASTERN SWEDEN\n\nStockholm & Uppsala\n\nStockholm is Sweden’s capital and its largest city, with 25% of Swedes living within its metro area. Because of it is built across 14 islands — each with a different character — Stockholm seems more a collection of small, walkable communities than a congested modern city.\n\nMEDIEVAL RIDDARHOLMEN ISLAND IS PART OF STOCKHOLM’S GAMLA STAN OLD CITY.\n\nSome islands are mostly residential. Others are commercial centers, governmental centers, parkland and recreation areas, and home to Swedish royalty.\n\nThis last is also home to the Gamla Stan historic old city, easily Stockholm’s most popular visitor destination.\n\nWhen not exploring on foot, Home At First visitors find Stockholm easy to get around by public transport: metro, tram, bus, and ferry using the included Stockholm Pass, which also provides free entry to many top city attractions, including the top-rated Vasa Ship Museum.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors staying 3 nights or longer receive the Stockholm Pass valid for city buses, metro, trams, and certain ferries, as well as free or reduced entries for many attractions. We do not recommend car rental for visitors to Stockholm.\n\nTHE ROMANTIC ALLEYS OF STOCKHOLM’S OLD CITY, GAMLA STAN\n\nHome At First offers lodgings in small Swedish hotels in at least 3 areas of Stockholm, including one along a pedestrian street in the heart of Gamla Stan.\n\nBy special request, we can arrange for lodging on one of the many islets in Stockholm’s Baltic Archipelago as part of a visit to the Stockholm region.\n\n13TH CENTURY UPPSALA CATHEDRAL, SWEDEN’S MOST IMPORTANT CHURCH.\n\nHome At First also offers hotel lodgings in the center of the historic small city of Uppsala, home of the oldest university in Scandinavia and the Church of Sweden.\n\nUppsala is connected by frequent rail service to Stockholm — a 40-minute commute — as well as to Stockholm’s main Arlanda Airport (16min journey time).\n\nUppsala is a very walkable city with a rich history extending from Viking times. Its 13th century cathedral is Sweden’s most important church. Its large 16th century royal castle houses several museums.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Uppsala is an excellent choice for visitors wishing to travel by car who do not wish to stay in urban Stockholm, but still want access to Stockholm by high-speed rail.\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\nCLASSIC Location\n\nSOUTH-CENTRAL SWEDEN\n\nSweden’s Great Lakes\n\nSouth-central Sweden is midway between Stockholm on Sweden’s east coast and Gothenburg & Bohuslän on Sweden’s west coast. The region has great forests, interesting towns & cities, fine medieval castles, as well as notable agriculture & manufacturing, especially quality glassmaking.\n\nBut the world-class attractions of the region are its two great lakes, Vättern & Vänern, inland seas ranking among the largest in Europe.\n\nBAROQUE 16TH CENTURY LÄCKÖ CASTLE, OPEN TO THE PUBLIC ON THE SOUTH SHORE OF LAKE VÄNERN\n\nHome At First offers lodgings in small, classically Swedish hotels by Lake Vättern, in/near the historic small lakeside town of Gränna, an ideal stop en route by car midway between Stockholm/Uppsala and Gothenburg, Bohuslän, or Copenhagen.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors to Sweden’s Lakeland will need a car rental.\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\nCLASSIC Location\n\nSWEDEN’S WEST COAST\n\nBohuslän\n\nSweden’s west coast extends about 250 miles from gritty Malmö across the Øresund strait from Copenhagen north along the Kattegat & Skagerrak seas to the Norwegian border not far south of Oslo.\n\nThe region of Bohuslän covers the northern half of Sweden’s west coast from Gothenburg to the border with Norway.\n\nBohuslän has a convoluted coastline and a rolling, agricultural interior, but it is the region’s inlets, islets, and skerries that give it a unique character.\n\nBOHUSLÄN: GREBBESTAD HARBOR ATTRACTS BOATERS & LAND VISITORS TO ITS WATERSIDE SHOPS & CAFéS.\n\nCoastal Bohuslän is a playground for Swedes, peppered with isolated private cabins, family camps, peaceful hamlets sheltered by coves, and busy colorful villages and towns that harbor fleets of private sailboats and one-time sea shanties turned into delightful café restaurants and boutique shops.\n\nBOHUSLÄN: LIGHTHOUSE ON URSHOLMEN OUTER ISLAND.\n\nBohuslän is ideal for exploration by car. There are prehistoric sites to visit, and fortresses from iron age forts to medieval castles to 20th century citadels.\n\nFerries carry visitors to outer islands crowned with lighthouses, and across the Skagerrak at the mouth of the Oslo Fjord to Norway.\n\nHome At First offers Bohuslän lodgings in small, classically Swedish hotels, close by the historic small coastal town of Grebbestad, an ideal stop en route by car midway between Oslo and Gothenburg, as well as a drive of 3½ hrs drive from Gränna in Sweden’s Great Lakes region.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors to Sweden’s West Coast (Bohuslän) will need a car rental.\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\nCLASSIC Location\n\nCENTER OF SCANDINAVIA\n\nGothenburg\n\nMid-way between Oslo and Copenhagen along Sweden’s west coast south of the skerries of Bohuslän is Sweden’s second city, the major port of Gothenburg.\n\nFully 10% of Sweden’s populace lives in and around Gothenburg. Shipping and manufacturing — Volvo and other major Swedish firms — have made the relatively young (since 1621) city into the economic powerhouse in the center of Scandinavia.\n\nGOTHENBURG HARBOR: TALL SHIP BY THE CITY’S LANDMARK “LIPSTICK” SKYSCRAPER.\n\nVisitors find that Gothenburg has the most vibrant culinary scene in Sweden, several noteworthy museums, and a famed in-town amusement park, Liseberg.\n\nGetting around Gothenburg by tram and canal boat — the city was built by Dutch engineers — means a car is not necessary here.\n\nHOME AT FIRST’S GOTHENBURG INN.\n\nHome At First offers lodgings in boutique Swedish inn not far from Liseberg, where guests may leave their cars and explore the city by public transport.\n\nGothenburg’s international airport (Landvetter) is just 25min from the inn, making it convenient for connecting with more distant parts of Scandinavia and beyond.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors to Gothenburg will not need a car rental. Guests staying 3 nights or longer receive a transit pass valid for city buses, trams, and certain boats.\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\nSPECIAL REQUEST DESTINATIONS IN SWEDEN\n\nHome At First can arrange lodging (usually hotels or historic inns) and appropriate transportation for any of four custom-priced, special-request Swedish regions.

And unlike most Swedish islands Gotland is far — about 60mi — from the Swedish mainland.\n\nWith permanent population nearing 60,000, Sunny Gotland becomes much more populated in summer months (especially August) when thousands of vacationers arrive from the mainland.\n\nSTROLLING THROUGH VISBY, PRINCIPAL TOWN OF GOTLAND. VISBY IS A DESIGNATED WORLD HERITAGE SITE AND ONE OF SCANDINAVIA’S BEST-PRESERVED MEDIEVAL TOWNS WITH MORE THAN 2 MILES OF LARGELY INTACT TOWN WALLS.\n\nPhoto: Tina Axelsson/ imagebank.sweden.se\n\nGotland is primarily flat, agriculture, and sparsely populated. Nearly half (25,000) of the island’s residents live in the main town, Visby.\n\nVisitors like Gotland’s laid-back lifestyle, its fresh foods, its beaches, its easy cycling, and its Viking and medieval history, elements that combine to make the island a Swedish idyll.\n\nVisitors can travel to Visby, Gotland, by ferry — with or without their rental car — from Nynäshamn south of Stockholm. Journey time is 3hrs.\n\nVisitors can also fly from Stockholm (50min), Gothenburg (1hr), or Malmö (1hr) to Visby. Car rentals (if desired) are available at the airport and ferry docks. Lodgings in Gotland can be B&Bs, hotels, inns, cottages, or apartments and are available in Visby and in locations throughout Gotland.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors to Gotland will find rental cars necessary for efficient exploration of the island.

Locally available bike rentals are popular additions for visitors to Gotland.\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\nSPECIAL REQUEST Location\n\nSkåne\n\nSWEDEN’S FAR SOUTH\n\nSkåne is Sweden’s southernmost region. Unlike most of Sweden Skåne is agricultural and known for its organic farms, fresh food, produce, and regional food specialties.\n\nSkåne also is home to Sweden’s third largest city, Malmø, (pop. 316,000) situated on the southwest corner of the country across the Øresund Strait (and connected by the international, rail & roadway Øresund Bridge/Tunnel to Copenhagen Airport and Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nTHE ØRESUND BRIDGE CONNECTS MALMØ, SWEDEN, WITH COPENHAGEN, dENMARK.\n\nPhoto © Viggo Lundberg\n\nThe city of Lund (pop. 92,000), northeast of Malmø, is home to one of Scandinavia’s great cathedrals.

A land of lakes, forests, and scattered villages & towns, Dalarna is the size of Belgium but with a population density of just 25 persons per square mile.\n\nCELEBRATING MIDSUMMER IN DALARNA\n\nPhoto: Per Bifrost/ imagebank.sweden.se\n\nDalarna — “the valleys” — is often thought as Sweden’s historic cultural heartland. Swedes — and foreigners with Swedish roots — enjoy returning to Dalarna to connect with their heritage in a largely natural landscape.\n\nDalarna is especially popular in June at Midsummer when traditional festivities are celebrated in historic costume.\n\nwooden DALARNA HORSE — swedish symbol MADE IN NUSNÄS ON LAKE SILJAN IN THE CENTER OF DALARNA\n\nPhoto: Cecilia Larsson Lantz/ Imagebank.sweden.se\n\nLodgings in Dalarna can be hotels or inns in locations across the region.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors to Dalarna will find rental cars necessary for efficient exploration of the region.\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\nSPECIAL REQUEST Location\n\nNorrbotten\n\nSWEDEN’S FAR NORTH: LAPPLAND & THE ARCTIC\n\nSweden’s northernmost 25% is Norrbotten county — larger than Ireland — a lightly populated land of great variety. Most of Norrbotten is above the Arctic Circle. Much of its population lives below the Arctic Circle. But, above the line Arctic Sweden is a land apart, full of waiting adventures.\n\nSAMI CULTURE IN LAPPLAND\n\nPhoto Lola Akinmade Åkerström/ imagebank.sweden.se\n\nMuch of Arctic Sweden is Lappland, home to migrating Sami people whose traditional lives revolve around their domesticated reindeer herds. Visitors can experience Sami culture close up at the annual Jokkmokk market and elsewhere.\n\nDOG-SLEDDING AT JOKKMOKK\n\nPhoto Staffan Widstrand/ imagebank.sweden.se\n\nNumerous adventure operators offer arctic experiences, including dog-sledding, reindeer sledding, hiking, skiing, fishing, and snowshoeing.\n\nTHE NORTHERN LIGHTS DANCE ABOVE THE ICE HOTEL IN ARCTIC SWEDEN\n\nPhoto Asaf Kliger/Icehotel/ imagebank.sweden.se\n\nFor those looking to experience the Northern Lights have an excellent chance to realize their dream in Artic Sweden.

Besides the Ice Hotel, lodgings in Norrbotten can be in the tree-tops or in other unusual hotels or inns in locations across the region.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors to Norrbotten County not traveling with an organized tour will find rental cars necessary for efficient exploration of the region.\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring OF:\n\nNORWAY\n\nCAR FERRY CROSSING THE HARDANGER FJORD, NORWAY\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\nNORWAY\n\nNot long ago Norway was Scandinavia’s poor relation: too far north, too mountainous, too snowy, with a western coastline too rugged, wet, foggy, and treacherous to handle major shipping or attract tourism.\n\nThen, in the 1960s major North Sea oil fields were discovered just offshore, and everything changed.\n\nNow Norway is Scandinavia’s biggest attraction: its cities centers of culture & gastronomy; its art & literature world class; its west coast fjords & mountains World Heritage Sites; its traditional foods, once subsistence sustenance, now relished as gourmet.\n\nTRADITIONAL NORWAY IS RE-ENACTED DAILY AT MAIHAUGEN OPEN-AIR MUSEUM, LILLEHAMMER\n\nBut traditional Norway runs deep.

The few non-stop flights take about 2.5 hrs from Oslo. At the arrival airport you will need to pick-up a rental car to continue the journey to your lodgings: another 1-5 hours.\n\nIs a visit to the Lofoten Islands worth the trouble and expense? There’s a reason spectacular images of Lofoten appear so frequently on travel calendars.\n\nIf you decide to go, remember that the success of your adventure will be more than a little dependent on the weather you encounter on this arctic archipelago in the Norwegian Sea well north of Iceland.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors coming to the Lofoten Islands by train, plane, or boat will need rental cars for exploration of the region.\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\nSPECIAL REQUEST LocationS\n\nTromsø & the Arctic\n\nARCTIC NORWAY NEAR THE TOP OF MAINLAND EUROPE\n\nTromsø (pop. 65,000) is Norway’s largest far-northern city, and 3rd most populous arctic city in the world. Built on two islands and the Norwegian mainland, Tromsø’s deep-water port location is warmed by the Gulf Stream.\n\nLike much of coastal Norway, Tromsø’s climate is relatively mild given its extreme northern latitude. Being well above the Arctic Circle, Tromsø experiences midnight sun for fully two months (mid-May through mid-July) each year, and “polar night” from late-November through mid-January, a time when the Northern Lights are often visible above the city.\n\nTROMSø’S LANDMARK ARCTIC CATHEDRAL\n\nTromsø was once the frontier of Norway with Sámi territory (Lappland) and Russia, and had been an important German stronghold during World War II.\n\nThe city has long been a base for arctic expeditions. Today, Tromsø is important as Norway’s largest fishing port and as an arctic research center. The city is the regional cultural center for far northern Norway.\n\nTROMSø EXPERIENCES 2 MONTHS OF MIDNIGHT SUN\n\nDriving to Tromsø from Lofoten is possible in about 7 hours, and a little over 3 hours from Narvik. Flying from Lofoten (Leknes) takes 50min, but there are few flights. Flight time is about 2hrs from Oslo or from Bergen,\n\nDriving to the famous Ice Hotel near Kiruna, Sweden, (Swedish Lappland) takes under 6hrs. All of these journey times assume decent weather conditions.\n\nTravelers are advised that travel in the far north of Scandinavia can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions and the vast wilderness.\n\nWe recommend flying to Tromsø from southern Norway. The few non-stop flights take about 2 hrs from Oslo. At the arrival airport you will need to pick-up a rental car to continue the journey to your lodgings: another 15 minutes.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors to Tromsø arriving by plane or boat will find city buses an efficient and inexpensive means of seeing the city. Those stopping at Tromsø with rental cars will find rental cars useful for exploration of the region."
