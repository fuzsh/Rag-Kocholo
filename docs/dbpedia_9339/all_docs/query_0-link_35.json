Because of it is built across 14 islands â each with a different character â Stockholm seems more a collection of small, walkable communities than a congested modern city.\n\nMEDIEVAL RIDDARHOLMEN ISLAND IS PART OF STOCKHOLMâS GAMLA STAN OLD CITY.\n\nSome islands are mostly residential. Others are commercial centers, governmental centers, parkland and recreation areas, and home to Swedish royalty.\n\nThis last is also home to the Gamla Stan historic old city, easily Stockholmâs most popular visitor destination.\n\nWhen not exploring on foot, Home At First visitors find Stockholm easy to get around by public transport: metro, tram, bus, and ferry using the included Stockholm Pass, which also provides free entry to many top city attractions, including the top-rated Vasa Ship Museum.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors staying 3 nights or longer receive the Stockholm Pass valid for city buses, metro, trams, and certain ferries, as well as free or reduced entries for many attractions.

Its 13th century cathedral is Swedenâs most important church. Its large 16th century royal castle houses several museums.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Uppsala is an excellent choice for visitors wishing to travel by car who do not wish to stay in urban Stockholm, but still want access to Stockholm by high-speed rail.\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\nCLASSIC Location\n\nSOUTH-CENTRAL SWEDEN\n\nSwedenâs Great Lakes\n\nSouth-central Sweden is midway between Stockholm on Swedenâs east coast and Gothenburg & BohuslÃ¤n on Swedenâs west coast. The region has great forests, interesting towns & cities, fine medieval castles, as well as notable agriculture & manufacturing, especially quality glassmaking.\n\nBut the world-class attractions of the region are its two great lakes, VÃ¤ttern & VÃ¤nern, inland seas ranking among the largest in Europe.\n\nBAROQUE 16TH CENTURY LÃCKÃ CASTLE, OPEN TO THE PUBLIC ON THE SOUTH SHORE OF LAKE VÃNERN\n\nHome At First offers lodgings in small, classically Swedish hotels by Lake VÃ¤ttern, in/near the historic small lakeside town of GrÃ¤nna, an ideal stop en route by car midway between Stockholm/Uppsala and Gothenburg, BohuslÃ¤n, or Copenhagen.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors to Swedenâs Lakeland will need a car rental.\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\nCLASSIC Location\n\nSWEDENâS WEST COAST\n\nBohuslÃ¤n\n\nSwedenâs west coast extends about 250 miles from gritty MalmÃ¶ across the Ãresund strait from Copenhagen north along the Kattegat & Skagerrak seas to the Norwegian border not far south of Oslo.\n\nThe region of BohuslÃ¤n covers the northern half of Swedenâs west coast from Gothenburg to the border with Norway.\n\nBohuslÃ¤n has a convoluted coastline and a rolling, agricultural interior, but it is the regionâs inlets, islets, and skerries that give it a unique character.\n\nBOHUSLÃN: GREBBESTAD HARBOR ATTRACTS BOATERS & LAND VISITORS TO ITS WATERSIDE SHOPS & CAFÃ©S.\n\nCoastal BohuslÃ¤n is a playground for Swedes, peppered with isolated private cabins, family camps, peaceful hamlets sheltered by coves, and busy colorful villages and towns that harbor fleets of private sailboats and one-time sea shanties turned into delightful cafÃ© restaurants and boutique shops.\n\nBOHUSLÃN: LIGHTHOUSE ON URSHOLMEN OUTER ISLAND.\n\nBohuslÃ¤n is ideal for exploration by car.

Shipping and manufacturing â Volvo and other major Swedish firms â have made the relatively young (since 1621) city into the economic powerhouse in the center of Scandinavia.\n\nGOTHENBURG HARBOR: TALL SHIP BY THE CITYâS LANDMARK âLIPSTICKâ SKYSCRAPER.\n\nVisitors find that Gothenburg has the most vibrant culinary scene in Sweden, several noteworthy museums, and a famed in-town amusement park, Liseberg.\n\nGetting around Gothenburg by tram and canal boat â the city was built by Dutch engineers â means a car is not necessary here.\n\nHOME AT FIRSTâS GOTHENBURG INN.\n\nHome At First offers lodgings in boutique Swedish inn not far from Liseberg, where guests may leave their cars and explore the city by public transport.\n\nGothenburgâs international airport (Landvetter) is just 25min from the inn, making it convenient for connecting with more distant parts of Scandinavia and beyond.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors to Gothenburg will not need a car rental.

Those stopping at Trondheim with rental cars will find rental cars useful for exploration of the region.\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\nSPECIAL REQUEST LocationS\n\nThe Lofoten Islands\n\nARCTIC COASTAL NORWAY BETWEEN TRONDHEIM & TROMSÃ\n\nIn a country renowned for its scenic spectacle, the Lofoten Islands may be unsurpassed. The remote archipelago extends some 200 miles southwest from the Norwegian mainland near Narvik.\n\nA panoply of precipitous peaks, placid bays, and pristine fishing villages on a string of arctic islands: travel pearls connected by a chain of road bridges, Lofoten invites exploration by car. But Lofoten is not easy to get to, and its accommodations can be spartan, if welcoming.\n\nTHE AURORA BOREALIS DANCES OVER THE\n\nLOFOTEN ISLANDS OF NORTHERN NORWAY.\n\nPhoto Â© Johny Goerend / brandnorway.no\n\nDriving to Lofoten from southern Norway is far and time-consuming (about 20 hrs drive time) and only recommended for those looking for a challenging road trip of marathon proportions.\n\nWhile it is possible to take the train from Sweden to Narvik and continue onto Lofoten by rental car, the train journey requires a full day.\n\nWe recommend flying to Lofoten from southern Norway. The few non-stop flights take about 2.5 hrs from Oslo. At the arrival airport you will need to pick-up a rental car to continue the journey to your lodgings: another 1-5 hours.\n\nIs a visit to the Lofoten Islands worth the trouble and expense? Thereâs a reason spectacular images of Lofoten appear so frequently on travel calendars.\n\nIf you decide to go, remember that the success of your adventure will be more than a little dependent on the weather you encounter on this arctic archipelago in the Norwegian Sea well north of Iceland.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors coming to the Lofoten Islands by train, plane, or boat will need rental cars for exploration of the region.\n\nIndependent Scandinavia touring:\n\nSPECIAL REQUEST LocationS\n\nTromsÃ¸ & the Arctic\n\nARCTIC NORWAY NEAR THE TOP OF MAINLAND EUROPE\n\nTromsÃ¸ (pop. 65,000) is Norwayâs largest far-northern city, and 3rd most populous arctic city in the world. Built on two islands and the Norwegian mainland, TromsÃ¸âs deep-water port location is warmed by the Gulf Stream.\n\nLike much of coastal Norway, TromsÃ¸âs climate is relatively mild given its extreme northern latitude. Being well above the Arctic Circle, TromsÃ¸ experiences midnight sun for fully two months (mid-May through mid-July) each year, and âpolar nightâ from late-November through mid-January, a time when the Northern Lights are often visible above the city.\n\nTROMSÃ¸âS LANDMARK ARCTIC CATHEDRAL\n\nTromsÃ¸ was once the frontier of Norway with SÃ¡mi territory (Lappland) and Russia, and had been an important German stronghold during World War II.\n\nThe city has long been a base for arctic expeditions. Today, TromsÃ¸ is important as Norwayâs largest fishing port and as an arctic research center. The city is the regional cultural center for far northern Norway.\n\nTROMSÃ¸ EXPERIENCES 2 MONTHS OF MIDNIGHT SUN\n\nDriving to TromsÃ¸ from Lofoten is possible in about 7 hours, and a little over 3 hours from Narvik. Flying from Lofoten (Leknes) takes 50min, but there are few flights. Flight time is about 2hrs from Oslo or from Bergen,\n\nDriving to the famous Ice Hotel near Kiruna, Sweden, (Swedish Lappland) takes under 6hrs. All of these journey times assume decent weather conditions.\n\nTravelers are advised that travel in the far north of Scandinavia can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions and the vast wilderness.\n\nWe recommend flying to TromsÃ¸ from southern Norway. The few non-stop flights take about 2 hrs from Oslo. At the arrival airport you will need to pick-up a rental car to continue the journey to your lodgings: another 15 minutes.\n\nTRANSPORTATION NOTE: Visitors to TromsÃ¸ arriving by plane or boat will find city buses an efficient and inexpensive means of seeing the city. Those stopping at TromsÃ¸ with rental cars will find rental cars useful for exploration of the region."
