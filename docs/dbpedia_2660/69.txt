A musical inspired by the life of Ray Charles will be heading to New York this fall.

According to Billboard, the show is titled Unchain My Heart and will premiere on Broadway on November 7, with previews scheduled to begin on October 8.

Stuart Benjamin, who produced the film Ray and worked with the late singer, is behind the production.

An earlier version of the musical called Ray Charles Live was produced at California's Pasadena Playhouse in 2007.
