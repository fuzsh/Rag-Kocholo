        "text": "Mario Van Peebles has been tapped to direct “That’ll Be the Day,” the story of how Buddy Holly and other musicians of the late 1950s helped give birth to rock ‘n’ roll and influence the wider societal and cultural landscape, including the civil rights movement.\n\nMusic has been central to much of Van Peebles’ work, from his 1991 gangster movie “New Jack City” to his work on “Wu-Tang: An American Saga,” which he co-executive produced for Hulu. Van Peebles is currently writing a musical stage tribute to his father Melvin Van Peebles, to be performed at New York City’s Lincoln Center later this year.\n\n“America’s tumultuous cultural melting pot has produced transcendent musical talent, including Buddy Holly, who was our first bad ass rock ’n’ roll nerd,” Van Peebles said in a statement.\n\nHis 2003 docudrama “Baadasssss!” pays homage to his father’s groundbreaking film “Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song.” His latest film,...\n\n“Don’t be such a dreamer,” says Bob (Esai Morales) to his younger brother, to which soon-to-be teen star Ritchie Valens (Lou Diamond Phillips), né Richard Valenzuela, quickly retorts, “My dreams are pure rock ‘n’ roll.” It’s the kind of blunt, overearnest exchange found in countless music-based biopics, but it also exemplifies La Bamba’s penchant for the cartoonishly archetypal. Indeed, everyone surrounding Ritchie is stripped of both nuance and agency as their roles in the film rarely extend beyond fueling or antagonizing the future icon.\n\nRitchie’s girlfriend, Donna (Danielle von Zerneck), the namesake of one of his biggest hits, is little more than a poodle skirt and a cheery smile, while his doting mother, Connie (Rosanna DeSoto), is the quintessential ultra-supportive parent. Bob is certainly the most fully fleshed out of this trio, but even most of his personal ups and downs are presented as being directly...\n\nColin Hanks, Diane Guerrero and hip-hop star Nelly have joined the cast of the Buddy Holly biopic “Clear Lake,” directed by Bruce Beresford.\n\n“Clear Lake” tells the story of how Holly and other famous musicians of the late 1950s gave birth to rock ‘n’ roll while changing the trajectory of civil rights in America. The 22-year-old Holly tragically died in a plane crash outside Clear Lake, Iowa, on Feb. 3, 1959, along with Ritchie Valens, J.P. “The Big Bopper” Richardson and pilot Roger Peterson.\n\nHanks (“Fargo”) will co-star as Norman Petty, Holly’s brilliant but often controlling manager and producer. “Orange Is the New Black” star Guerrero has been cast in the role of Holly’s wife, Maria Elena Holly.

(The Big Bopper) Richardson. Valens’ short life—particularly with family and friends in a vibrant Mexican-American community—and obsessive love of music are the focus in La Bamba, directed with warmth by Luis Valdez (Zoot Suit).

Morgan Neville has signed on to produce the project.\n\nJust last month, Concord Music Group announced that it was developing a Broadway musical about the iconic music label Stax Records, which launched the careers of such soul artists as Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes and Booker T. & the Mg's amid the racial tension of the civil rights era. Stuart Benjamin, the Academy Award nominated producer of Ray, is co-developing the musical, and the plan is to launch by spring of 2016.
