        "text": "A musical celebrating American musician Ray Charles will open on Broadway in November.\n\nUnchain my Heart will open in a soon-to-be-named theatre on Nov. 7, with preview performances beginning Oct. 8, according to an announcement Thursday by its producers.\n\nThe production will feature Charles's music, which spanned rhythm and blues, soul and gospel among other genres.\n\n\"I want people to sit in the theatre and get the full gamut of experiences â€” I want them to laugh, I want them to cry, I want them to feel Ray's pain, I want them to feel Ray's elation,\" said producer Stuart Benjamin, who worked with the late music legend for 15 years and produced the 2004 film, Ray.\n\nThe show will be directed by Sheldon Epps, artistic director of the Pasadena Playhouse. Its book is by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks.\n\nJamie Foxx won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Charles in Ray, but the actor won't be stepping on stage for an encore. According to Benjamin, the lead role has been cast with a Tony Award-nominated stage actor who, along with the rest of the cast, will be named soon. Benjamin said the physical demands of the role require a veteran stage actor.\n\nUnlike the film, which featured recordings of Charles's voice, the musical will have live singing throughout.\n\nThe scope of the stage story will also be different from the film version. While Ray ended in 1965, with the singer kicking his heroin addiction, the musical will start with his childhood in rural Florida and move through to the end of his life in 2004.\n\nA developmental production of the musical under the title, Ray Charles Live!, ran at the Pasadena Playhouse in 2007. It imagines Charles at his last live recording session, where he relates stories from his life and sings his best-known hits."
