        "text": "Benjamin Widiss specializes in twentieth-century and contemporary American literature and film. He wrote Obscure Invitations: The Persistence of the Author in Twentieth-Century American Literature. Widiss is working on a second book that explores a constellation of relationships between mass production and individual bodily presence, conceptions of temporality and loss, and constructions of adolescence and maturity as a means to articulate the aesthetic postures of an emergent post-postmodernism. He received a doctorate in English from the University of California, Berkeley, and a bachelor's degree from Yale University.\n\nRecent Courses Taught\n\nDream/Life\n\nU.S. Modernisms\n\nLiterary Theory and Literary Study\n\nContemporary American Fiction\n\nPoetry and Poetics\n\nFaulkner and The South\n\nContemporary Graphic Narrative\n\nSelected Publications\n\nObscure Invitations: The Persistence of the Author in Twentieth-Century American Literature (Stanford University Press, 2011).\n\n“Reverse Entropy.” Forthcoming in The Pocket Instructor: Literature.
