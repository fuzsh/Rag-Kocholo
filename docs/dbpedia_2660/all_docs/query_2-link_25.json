        "text": "THIBODAUX -- When big-budget movies come to small towns, area residents are typically star-struck and wide-eyed as they search for actors and actresses and hope for their own 15 minutes of fame.\n\nWhat many don't realize is the economic impact these productions leave behind.\n\n\"It's a great thing for the community,\" said Stuart Benjamin, a Los Angeles producer, who wrapped up shooting scenes from \"Unchain My Heart: The Ray Charles Story\" today near Thibodaux.\n\nThe production, which transformed Laurel Valley Plantation into Jelly Roll, Ga., for scenes from the movie, has employed between 100 and 150 people each day, including many locals.\n\n\"We take up residence down here,\" Benjamin said. \"We rent cars and trucks and purchase lumber to build sets.\"\n\nThibodaux-based Rouses Supermar-kets participated by catering the set, along with other area vendors.\n\n\"It's been really neat. I even had the chance to watch them make the movie,\" said Rhonda Melancon of Thibodaux-based Summer Sno, a mobile snowball stand hired to quench the thirsts of the cast and crew.\n\nFor Jerry McKee, the Laurel Valley sugar farm's owner, the movie business is becoming old hat.\n\n\"This is our 21st feature film,\" he said. \"A lot of people don't know that.\"\n\nLaurel Valley -- believed to be the South's largest intact turn-of-the-century sugar-cane plantation complex -- has served as the set in the past for such films as \"JFK\" and \"Interview with a Vampire.\"\n\n\"It's a business for us,\" McKee said. \"It's actually kind of disruptive to our normal farming operations.\"\n\nBut what the production crews leave behind is worth the disruption, he said.\n\n\"It's great for the restaurants and hotels,\" he said. \"Some of these people have had to stay in Houma because they couldn't find a room in Thibodaux. So it's a good shot in the arm for the local economy.\"\n\nAnd the aspect of movie making McKee personally enjoys is the artistry and set designs.\n\n\"It makes these old buildings come alive,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to dressing the more than three-dozen cabins at Laurel Valley, the crew built a new structure called the Robinson House, which served as an interior set for scenes.\n\nThe production staff didn't have to look far to find quality set designers, either. The crew hired Bob Cooper Special Effects and Rentals, which is based up the road in Chacahoula.\n\nCooper, originally from New York, has quite a movie resume from his more than two decades in the business.\n\n\"We work all over the country,\" he said.\n\nCooper has worked on such blockbusters as \"Titanic\" and \"True Lies.\"\n\nCooper is \"well known throughout the business,\" McKee said.\n\nAt Laurel Valley, Cooper's crew was challenged to make the cabin's chimneys smoke and provide rain when needed, among many other duties.\n\n\"They've spent a ton of money down here, from construction to set dressings,\" Cooper said of the production company. \"A lot of people don't realize the impact. And the best thing about the movie industry is it's nonpolluting. Our construction crews will come back and make everything look like it did before we started.\"\n\n\"I wish the local politicians understood the economic impact of this,\" McKee said.\n\nAnd maybe they do -- or are at least beginning to do so.\n\nCooper said tax incentives for filmmakers passed by the state Legislature over the past two years lured \"Unchain My Heart\" to Louisiana.\n\nAnd movie staff members said they know of more than 20 feature films waiting to take advantage of the incentives in Louisiana, as well.\n\nJimmy Trotter, a New Orleans-based location scout for the movie, said south Louisiana offers many unique settings attractive to Hollywood.\n\n\"We found a perfect look and atmosphere at Laurel Valley,\" he said.\n\nBesides rural south Louisiana, Trotter said upscale residential areas of New Orleans are popular, along with the new University of New Orleans soundstage in Elmwood.\n\nMatt Gresham can be reached at 857-2204 or by e-mail at matthew.gresham@houmatoday.com."
