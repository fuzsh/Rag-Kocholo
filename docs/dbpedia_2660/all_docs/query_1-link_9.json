        "text": "By Bob Mehr\n\nStax is headed to the Great White Way.\n\nThe story of the iconic Memphis soul label will hit Broadway as part of a stage production slated for a 2016 debut.\n\nConcord Music Group ? the Los Angeles-based company that owns the Stax name and much of its catalog ? and producer Stuart Benjamin announced the development of a show based around the music, songs and history of the label on Wednesday in show business trade publication The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nBenjamin was a longtime partner of director Taylor Hackford, and the pair collaborated on 2004 Academy Award-nominated biopic \"Ray,\" about R&B singer Ray Charles. Benjamin also produced the 1987 film \"La Bamba,\" about the life of rocker Richie Valens.\n\nBenjamin has also had his hand in several recent musicals, including a Ray Charles stage effort that's slated to premiere on Broadway next year. Benjamin's son Matthew is expected to write the book for the Stax musical.\n\nThe Stax show would follow other Broadway productions based on the music and stories of famous record labels, including the recent \"Motown: The Musical,\" and the Sun Records-based \"Million Dollar Quartet.\"\n\nThough Wednesday's announcement took some at the Soulsville Foundation by surprise, several Memphians, including Stax songwriter/producer David Porter, have already consulted on the project.\n\nPorter, co-author with the late Isaac Hayes of many key Stax hits, including \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin,'\" met twice with Benjamin to discuss plans for a musical. \"We talked about wanting to explore a musical and get into that,\" said Porter. \"For some time there's been thought about a musical, and I've had no doubt it would happen eventually.\"\n\nFrom the unlikely formation of the label by suburban country fiddler/banker Jim Stewart and his sister Estelle Axton, to the rise of stars like Rufus and Carla Thomas, Eddie Floyd and Booker T. & the MGs, to the life and tragic death of Otis Redding, to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, and Stax's Al Bell-led rebirth in the late ?60s, there are enough twists and turns to fuel a half-dozen shows.\n\n\"I say this, not because I was involved in it, but I say it totally genuinely: the Stax is strongest story that could hit the marketplace,\" said Porter. \"Because there's so many variables and angles in the story that could make it interesting for a Broadway audience, really for any audience.\"\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, Concord and Benjamin are targeting spring 2016 for a premiere."
