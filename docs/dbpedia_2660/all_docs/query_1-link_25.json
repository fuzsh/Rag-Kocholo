        "text": "One of the nicest things I get to do every year is to return to Federation University Australia to present the Pitman Benjamin Prize. The 2023 Award goes to Mitchell Biggin, for his thesis on \"Understanding the opportunities and impediments to the use of recycled water for irrigation of agricultural crops\". Mitchell's work identified current trends, attitudes, and challenges towards the use of recycled water, providing valuable insights into its potential for sustainable agriculture. Incredibly thought-provoking work, that represents a significant addition to the accumulated knowledge in our discipline. We established this prize very soon after Heather's sudden passing in 2005. It has become one of the preeminent awards in the Institute of Innovation, Science and Sustainability. Having your name on the honour board is an incredible achievement. The tears in Mitchell's Mums eyes said it all. Being able to present an award like this, to a boy from Beaufort - confirms that our work at Federation is delivering for our community. Heather was the first woman to graduate as an engineer in Ballarat, from the Ballarat College of Advanced Education (now known as Federation University). Heather held many positions over her career, with her last appointment being the City of Ballarat Manager of Building & Assets. It was in this role that Heather took a very green young developer under her wing and our friendship was formed. My thanks to the leadership team, including Duncan Bentley, Truong Phung, Jess Reeves, Sam Henson, Carolyn Chong and Chris Hutchison for continuing to support my work and our broader community."
