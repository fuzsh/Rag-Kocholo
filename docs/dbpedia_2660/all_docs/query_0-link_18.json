        "text": "Concord Music Group and producer Stuart Benjamin, known for his work on the film Ray, are developing a musical production based on Memphis’ iconic Stax Records. A book will be written by Matthew Benjamin, and the Broadway premiere is expected in spring 2016.\n\nStax Records began in an old movie theater and became an international hit-making machine, spawning the careers of Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, Booker T. & the MG’s, The Staple Singers and Steve Cropper, to name few.\n\nAs producer of Ray, Benjamin received a Best Picture Oscar nomination. He won a Grammy Award as producer of the film’s multi-platinum soundtrack. He co-founded New Visions Entertainment which has produced the films Against All Odds, White Nights, La Bamba and Everybody’s All American. He has collaborated with artists including Sting, Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen and Mariah Carey.\n\nIn related Concord news, the company has acquired the catalog of R&B/soul label Vee-Jay Records, which includes over 5,000 master recordings by artists such as Little Richard, John Lee Hooker, Betty Everett, Jimmy Reed, Jerry Butler, The Staple Singers, Gene Chandler and The Dells. The purchase includes Chandler’s “Duke of Earl,” Hooker’s iconic “Boom Boom,” and Everett’s “The Shoop Shoop Song (It’s In His Kiss).”\n\nConcord Music Group’s active roster is home to Sir Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Alison Krauss, Ben Harper, and Steve Martin and more."
