        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — A musical celebrating Ray Charles is headed for Broadway this fall. “Unchain My Heart” will open Nov. 7 with preview performances beginning Oct. 8. Producer Stuart Benjamin said Thursday the show would feature a book by Suzan-Lori Parks and direction by Sheldon Epps. Casting will be announced. Benjamin worked with the late singer for 15 years and produced “Ray,” the hit movie about his life starring Jamie Foxx. Parks won a Pulitzer Prize for her play “Topdog/Underdog.” An earlier version of the musical called “Ray Charles Live” was produced at California’s Pasadena Playhouse in 2007.\n\nOriginally Published: March 14, 2010 at 9:23 a.m."
