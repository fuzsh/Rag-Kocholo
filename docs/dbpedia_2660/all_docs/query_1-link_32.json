        "text": "Hey everyone –\n\nI know you have been waiting a long time for an update about the Spy School movie — and I am sure this is not what you were hoping for. It’s certainly not what I was hoping for.\n\nAfter 54 weeks of doing nothing with the movie script, Disney decided that they were not going to move forward with the Spy School movie.\n\nWhy? I don’t really have a great answer for that. I was told that Disney had some concerns with the story involving kids in real danger — which you’d think they would have been able to figure out was part of the plot long ago, given the title.\n\nSadly, this kind of thing happens a lot in Hollywood. As I keep saying, it is very hard to get a movie made.\n\nThis does not mean the movie will never get made. My agents can now try to set the project up at another movie studio or streaming service. We will see what happens.\n\nIn the meantime, feel free to write angry letters to Disney or cancel your Disney + accounts in protest."
