        "text": "“Unchain My Heart, the Ray Charles Musical” is scheduled to begin preview performances on Broadway on Oct. 8 and open on Nov. 7, the lead producer, Stuart Benjamin, said on Thursday. It will be directed by Sheldon Epps with a book by Suzan-Lori Parks, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright of “Topdog/Underdog.” The musical, which had a developmental production at Pasadena Playhouse under the title “Ray Charles Live!” in 2007, imagines Charles, at his last live recording session, where stories from his life pour out and mix with his best-known hits that will be featured in the show. A spokeswoman for the production said that “Unchain My Heart” represents the first musical book-writing effort by Ms. Parks, whose plays also include “Venus,” “In the Blood” and her newest, “The Book of Grace,” which is now in preview performances at the Public Theater. Mr. Benjamin, who worked with Charles for years and produced the Academy Award-winning film “Ray,” said the production would run at a Shubert Organization theater to be announced later."
