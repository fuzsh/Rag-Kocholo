        "text": "For the past three decades, Drew Ferrante has been instrumental in achieving success for various companies in almost every division of the Music Industry. A \"lifer\" in the world of music, Drew became a musician at an early age, played in bands throughout his teens, and ran his own successful professional recording studio by the time he was 20. While engineering and producing countless regional acts, his own band was signed to a major recording contract, and he was hired to co-produce their major-label debut album which, unfortunately, was never released.\n\nDesperate to understand how the major labels operated, he switched gears, spending the next 12 years “inside” the music industry, with various A&R, Marketing and Promotion positions at MCA Records, Columbia Records, Chaos Recordings, The Work Group, and Epic Records. He was then recruited to help rebuild and revive the Walt Disney Company's Hollywood Records label. After several years, and a successful relaunch of the Disney Music Group, he was offered a unique opportunity to help build and run the independent Connoisseur Records label.\n\nWith piracy causing record labels to downsize, he opted to switch to the tech-driven side of the industry, joining Yangaroo, Inc., the Entertainment Industry’s leading Digital Media Distribution company, where he continues to assist Major Entertainment companies to make the most out of digital distribution. As their Senior Vice President of Business Development, he has been instrumental in the creation of their Yangaroo Awards Solutions, and has helped secure deals for The Grammy Awards (NARAS), The Golden Globes (HFPA), The Academy of Country Music Awards, The Emmy Awards (NATAS), the MTV Music and Video Awards, the BET Awards, and many more, moving them from traditional paper balloting to a secure online streaming and voting solution.\n\nIn his “spare” time, he feeds his creative side as an Engineer, Producer, and Mixer, having mixed or re-mixed several #1 songs by Miley Cyrus, Jesse McCartney, and Breaking Benjamin. He continues to independently do audio production for The Walt Disney Company, so you’ll likely hear his work (and his voice) being used in a variety of Disney projects!\n\nJames A. Fino is a founding partner of Starburns Industries, inc. He served as executive producer on the Emmy award-winning stop-motion animated ABED’S UNCONTROLLABLE CHRISTMAS for NBC’s comedy COMMUNITY as well as Adult Swim’s stop-motion series, MARY SHELLEY’S FRANKENHOLE and BEFOREL OREL. Fino assembled a fierce animation team and pushed the envelope of TV animation for Adult Swim’s RICK AND MORTY before continuing to executive produce Starburns Industries’ first documentary feature, HARMONTOWN, the Oscar-nominated stop-motion feature, ANOMALISA, HBO’s animated series, ANIMALS, VRV’s animated series, HARMONQUEST, and recently, WOMAN IN THE BOOK, an animated Mexican Gothic horror series for Facebook Watch produced with a majority LatinX cast and crew.\n\nStuart Pollok has worked in various capacities in the film industry for almost 25 years. After a brief stint in marketing for Universal Pictures, Stuart worked in development, production, and business affairs for most of the nineties at Paramount Pictures-based Prelude Pictures, rising to Executive Vice President, the highest-ranking executive at the company. At Prelude, a division of Neufeld/Rehme Productions, the producers of Patriot Games, The Hunt for Red October and Clear And Present Danger, The Omen, and No Way Out, among many others, Stuart originated and shepherded to production Judicial Consent for HBO/Rysher Entertainment, Black Dog for Universal Pictures and tent-pole Lost In Space for New Line Cinema. After Prelude, Stuart produced One of The Hollywood Ten starring Jeff Goldblum for the BBC, Canal+, TVE, and Buena Vista International (BVI). It premiered at the Closing Night of the San Sebastian Film Festival. He then conceived, wrote, and implemented the business plan that leads to the creation of Studio Hamburg International Production (SHIP), the English-language theatrical feature division of Studio Hamburg, then Germany’s largest television producer with an annual turnover in excess of $250m. As Head of Production at SHIP, Stuart oversaw and executive produced three features, including launching the successful The Three Investigators family franchise for BVI, and handled production services in Germany for Flightplan starring Jodie Foster for Imagine Entertainment/Disney. Today, he is the Head of International for Pagale SE, a Swedish financing/production entity. Stuart is a former New York attorney and a graduate of the University of Glasgow, Georgetown University Law Center and the University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television, Peter Stark Producing Program. He was a Rotary Scholar at Georgetown, representing Europe on a World Peace Initiative, and at high school graduated as top male of his class and was elected Class President.\n\nAn alum of the UTLA program, Barbara is a television drama writer with a decade of TV writers’ room, development, production, and social media experience.
