These judges have personal histories of helping writers, directors, and actors break into the business by signing with major talent agencies like CAA, WME, ICM, etc., or by selling original material to the major Hollywood studios, including Universal Pictures, Paramount, Fox, and Warner Bros.\n\nThe most recent additions to the LAISC 2017 judging panel include:\n\nStuart Benjamin, Oscar-nominated Grammy-winning producer of such major feature films as Ray, La Bamba, White Knights, and The Long Walk Home.\n\nMarc Pariser, former CAA and WME packaging agent, responsible for the discovery of writers, producers, and directors, and guiding some of the most successful careers in Hollywood.\n\nJeffrey Scott, Emmy and Humanitas Award-winning writer-producer with hundreds of animated and live action feature and TV credits working alongside Jim Henson, Stan Lee, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Stevie Wonder; the acclaimed author of How to Write for Animation.\n\nSuzanne Herrera, former film and television actress, writer of Zorro, High Tide, and Falcon Crest. Actively consulting other writers in story, structure, character, dialogue, and in preparing scripts for casting and production.\n\nMikhael Bassilli, writer-producer-director, award-winning screenwriter and CEO of Play Think Entertainment, currently filling his production slate with \"the best of the best\" projects from established and promising screen and TV writers.\n\nJerry London, director-producer, nominated for multiple Emmys, DGA award-winner, with more than 100 major film and television projects including Shogun, Chiefs, Ellis Island.\n\nRon Friedman, legendary writer-producer, among the most prolific television writers of all time, the man behind Transformers, G.I.
