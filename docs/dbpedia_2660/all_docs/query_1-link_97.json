        "text": "Just this year David Austin launched 3 roses named after people, so it would not come as a big surprise that there are many roses named after famous people. If you are deciding which varieties of roses to plant in your garden, you can choose ones named after your favourite celebrities or American presidents.\n\nThe fashion of naming roses after people started at the beginning of 19th century when breeding company Jackson and Perkins named their first Rose Dorothy Perkins. This rose was not named after a celebrity but rather after a Grand-daughter of one of the owners. The rose turned out to be a huge success, it won a prize at the Royal National Rose Society in 1908. As a result, Dorothy Perkins became famous overnight without having to do anything!\n\nSince then many rose propagators named their creations after family members. So if you see a rose named after a person but no famous face comes to mind you are probably looking at rose named after a family member and not a celebrity.\n\nThese roses named after famous people are typically the best of roses. After all, celebrities can be picky as their reputation is at stake. For example, Barbara Streisand was quite particular in what kind of rose can be named after her.\n\nList of roses named after famous people\n\nAnne Boleyn Rose\n\nAnne Boleyn Rose: Name Origins: Named for the second of Henry VIIIâs six wives, who was mother to Queen Elizabeth I. The neat flowers form a rosette shape, with symmetrically arranged petals in a soft shade of warm pink. The blooms are produced in large sprays and carried by the gracefully arching stems. The rose has a light fragrance. The overall impression of this rose is one of pleasing freshness, both in flower and in leaf. It has soft green, highly polished foliage.\n\nDetails:\n\nOther names:\n\nType: English Musk Hybrid\n\nColour: Warm Pink\n\nPetal Count: 60 +\n\nFragrance: light musk fragrance\n\nBreeder: David Austin\n\nYear: 1999\n\nAudrey Hepburn Rose\n\nAudrey Hepburn Rose: Creating rose worthy of Audrey Hepburn must have been quite a challenge as she is well known for her elegance and class. The light pink hybrid tea rose that was named after her is very feminine and delicate, just like the talented and beautiful actress. Her rose has a very gentle smell which can be described as a light, fruity scent. Its blooming season repeats well through the season.\n\nDetails:\n\nOther names: Joanâs Desire, TWOadore\n\nType: Hybrid tea\n\nColour: Light pink similar to apple bloom\n\nPetal Count: 30 â 36 petals\n\nFragrance: Fruity\n\nBreeder: Jerry F. Twomey\n\nYear: 1991\n\nAugusta Luise rose\n\nAugusta Luise rose: Augusta Louise Stolberg-Stolberg (1753-1835) is known for her lively correspondence with the poet and thinker Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1775-1776, they personally never met. She is known as Goetheâs Gustchen in the history of literature. Matthias Tantau created this rose variety in 1999 in honour of the 250th anniversary of the birth of Goethe.\n\nDetails:\n\nOther names: RACHEL (Tangust)\n\nType: Hybrid tea\n\nShape: Cabbage rose shape\n\nColour: Confection of cream, pink and peach\n\nPetal Count: 120+\n\nFragrance: Strong fruity scent\n\nBreeder: Rosen Tantau\n\nYear: 1999\n\nRose Princess Alexandra of Kent\n\nRose Princess Alexandra of Kent: has unusually deeply cupped blooms of warm, glowing pink. They are full-petalled in shape; the ring of light pink outer petals enclosing the warm pink inner petals, creating a most pleasing effect. In spite of their size, the flowers are never clumsy and are held nicely poised above the foliage.\n\nThis rose is famous not only because of its looks but also for its delicious award-winning fragrance. Its magnificent blooms have a delicious fresh tea fragrance which, interestingly, changes completely to lemon as the flowers age â eventually taking on additional hints of blackcurrants.\n\nDavid Austin named this rose after Princess Alexandra, who is a cousin to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nDetails:\n\nOther names: Ausmerchant\n\nType: English Old Rose Hybrid\n\nColour: Warm pink\n\nPetal Count: 130 petals\n\nFragrance: Tea fragrance with notes of lemon and blackcurrants.\n\nBreeder: David Austin\n\nYear: 2002\n\nBarbra Streisand rose\n\nBarbra Streisand rose: Barbra Streisand was very selective when picking a rose that will bear her name. The singer has said that if a flower was named after her, she would want it to smell good and be disease free. The rose created by Tom Carruth in 2001 lived up to expectations with its rich lavender blooms that are combined with an intense citrus-like fragrance. The plants are clothed with lush foliage that is very disease resistant.\n\nThis is a rose with a family history. Its mother is an unnamed sister seedling of âLagerfeldâ and âNew Zelandâ is a father. Both parents are fine examples of fragrant roses, but their offspring handily outdoes them both. Its fragrance is ravishing and deeply scented.\n\nBarbra Streisand rose is being registered as a mauve blend, which does not do justice to how finely itâs coloured. The majority of modern mauve roses have too much red or too much blue in their petals. This rose got it right and so its colours remain pure thought out its life, never greying.\n\nDetails:\n\nOther names: WEKquaneze\n\nType: Hybrid tea\n\nColour: Lavender with darker edges\n\nPetal Count: 26 â 30 petals\n\nFragrance: Strong citrus-like scent\n\nBreeder: Tom Carruth\n\nYear: 2001 (in 2004 named as âBarbra Streisandâ)\n\nBetty White Rose\n\nBetty White Rose: Was named after American actress with the longest television career of a female entertainer.

The rose has a strong, fruity fragrance that makes it a superb cutting rose. It was introduced by David Austin in 2001 and like most David Austin roses combines beauty, fragrance, a remarkably long-blooming season and a high resistance to diseases.\n\nThe rose was named to commemorate the life of the popular English composer, conductor and performer.\n\nDetails:\n\nOther names: Ausencart\n\nColour: Deep Salmon Pink\n\nType: English Leander Hybrid\n\nPetal Count:\n\nFragrance: Lovely, intensely fruity fragrance with hints of wine and pear drops.\n\nBreeder: David Austin\n\nYear: 2001\n\nBotticelli\n\nBotticelli Rose: In 2004 Meilland created a nostalgic rose, which appears in colours ranging from salmon pink to pink.

The buds look striking in rich red colour that gradually changes to apricot when a rose reaches its peak. The rose has large rosettes, each with ruffled petals and a button eye.\n\nSent wise the rose is a show stopper with its lovely, medium-strong fragrance, which combines classic tea with a fresh note of cucumber and a hint of kiwi.\n\nThis variety is very resistant to rain damage. A vigorous grower, it produces strong, arching stems which, over time, form an attractive mound of blooms. The arching stems encourage many side shoots, which quickly produce a generous second crop of blooms.\n\nDetails:\n\nOther names: â\n\nColour: Apricot\n\nType: English Musk Hybrid\n\nPetal Count: 100+\n\nFragrance: Fresh tea fragrance\n\nBreeder: David Austin\n\nYear: 2017\n\nRose Diana, Princess of Wales\n\nRose Diana, Princess of Wales: This rose was developed by Zary in 1998 and named after one of the most famous people of all time.
