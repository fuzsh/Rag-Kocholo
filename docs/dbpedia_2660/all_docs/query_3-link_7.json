        "text": "Academy decides producer credits\n\nfor nominated films\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP -- Michael Mann\n\nand Graham King will be eligible to receive an Oscar if their film, \"The Aviator,\"\n\nshould win the best picture award this year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts\n\nand Sciences decided Thursday.\n\nThe ruling excluded Charles Evans\n\nJr., who's listed as a producer on the film, but was previously ruled ineligible\n\nby the Producers Guild of America under that group's rules for determining who\n\ndeserves producer credits.\n\nIn a lawsuit against Mann in 2001,\n\nEvans claimed he was responsible for developing the idea for the film and persuading\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio to portray Hughes. Eventually, Evans claimed, Mann cut him\n\nout of the deal altogether, taking DiCaprio and the project to another studio.\n\nThe lawsuit was settled, and Evans\n\nwas listed as a producer on the final film.\n\nAlso excluded was Sandy Climan,\n\na colleague of Mann's at Forward Pass Productions, who's also listed in the\n\nfilm's credits as a producer.\n\nThis year, the companies behind\n\nthree of the five best-picture nominees failed to pare their long list of producers,\n\nforcing the academy to meet and rule on eligibility.\n\nThe academy also ruled that Clint\n\nEastwood, Albert Ruddy and Tom Rosenberg are eligible to receive the award for\n\ntheir film, \"Million Dollar Baby.\" Rosenberg is the head of Lakeshore Entertainment,\n\nwhich financed the movie. Paul Haggis, who was listed on screen as a producer,\n\nwas left off, but he has an Oscar nomination for adapted screenplay.\n\nThe group was spared the task of\n\ndeciding the eligibility of producers on the Ray Charles film \"Ray.\"\n\nThe company behind the movie decided\n\nat the last minute that Taylor Hackford, Stuart Benjamin and Howard Baldwin\n\nwould be listed as producers for Oscar purposes, leaving off Baldwin's wife,\n\nKaren.\n\nUnder academy rules, a maximum of\n\nthree people are eligible to be nominated for each film. If more than three\n\npeople are credited as a producer, the rules state that the Oscar will go to\n\n\"those three or fewer who have performed the major portion of the producing\n\nfunctions.\"\n\nThe rules were adopted after the\n\nOscars in 1999, when five producers, including Miramax studio chief Harvey Weinstein,\n\ntook the stage to accept the best-picture Oscar for \"Shakespeare in Love.\"\n\nThe spectacle rankled those angered\n\nby \"credit creep,\" the tendency of filmmakers to massage the egos of actors,\n\ndirectors, studio executives -- even talent managers and agents -- by giving\n\nthem on-screen credit for jobs they did not perform.\n\n\"The title of producer has in the\n\nlast 20 years become a bargaining chip, a negotiated perk, given to those who\n\ncan extract it from the studios,\" said Kathleen Kennedy, president of the Producers\n\nGuild of America.\n\nIn October, the guild began a \"Truth\n\nin Credits\" campaign, which included advertisements featuring such prominent\n\nproducers as Jerry Bruckheimer and \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas.\n\n\"Even in science fiction, the fiction\n\nshould end when the credits roll,\" the Lucas ad read.\n\nAccording to guild guidelines, a\n\nproducer exercises decision-making authority in one or more of four areas of\n\nfilmmaking -- development, pre-production, production and post-production/marketing."
