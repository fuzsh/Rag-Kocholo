        "text": "The problem of the awesome waves preyed on Ben Stiller. There’s a scene in “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,” a script that Stiller had developed to direct and star in, in which Walter, carrying vital radio parts for a fishing trawler cruising off Greenland, leaps from a helicopter into the stormy waters near the ship. Then a fin surfaces behind him. As Walter desperately treads water, the ship’s captain offers some contemplative advice:\n\nCAPTAIN: If that is a porpoise, befriend it. Porpoises are mammals with rare intelligence and sympathy. They often protect swimmers from predators.\n\nThe fin circles by again.\n\nCAPTAIN (cont’d): If that’s a shark, strike it. Their snouts are sensory hubs.\n\nWALTER (calling out): How do you—I just see a fin. Can you get a bead on some more information?\n\nIt’s a shark, naturally, and Walter must pummel it with his bare hands. If realized on film, the moment would be signature Stiller: the put-upon Everyman striving for dignity as the mayhem escalates. But when the director gathered the film’s producers and technicians for their first pre-production, or “prep,” meeting, he emphasized that the scene was the fulcrum of the film, and that without sufficiently realistic surf it wouldn’t be momentous. It wouldn’t even be funny.\n\nJames Thurber’s 1939 short story “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” follows a mild-tempered man who, as he accompanies his wife on her weekly shopping trip in Waterbury, Connecticut, imagines himself as a brilliant surgeon, a steely naval commander, and a daring bomber pilot; it made “Walter Mitty” a byword for a passive dreamer who longs for escape. When we meet Stiller’s version of Walter, he’s a nebbish who runs the photo library at Life but lacks a life of his own. He gets lost in elaborate fantasies where his crush on a colleague, Cheryl, comes to glorious fruition, and where he confounds his nasty new boss, Ted. Only when Ted’s about to fire him because he can’t find a negative, one slated for the cover of Life’s final issue—the movie is set in a nineteen-sixties-ish present day in which the magazine is still publishing—does Walter act. He flies to Greenland in search of the nomadic photographer who took the shot. And it’s here, once he jumps in the water with the radio parts, that the real-life adventures begin.\n\nThe prep meeting took place on a Saturday afternoon in January, in a conference room at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Atlanta. Stiller was starring in a comedy, “The Watch,” that was filming nearby, and, when you’re a director who also happens to be a movie star, everyone comes to you. Stiller cued up an episode of “The Deadliest Catch” on a flat-screen TV and paused the action on some hellacious waves from an Arctic storm. His production designer and friend, Jeff Mann, is the loquacious Penn to Stiller’s gnomic Teller; eying the mountain of water, he deadpanned, “Those are some important motherfucking radio parts.”\n\n“I’m not saying that big,” Stiller said. He stared at the eight men around the conference table, four of whom wore heavy, black-framed glasses like his own. “But slightly less, only because we need to see the shark. This vibe: sunset, storm, God-rays of light from the sky?” He often puts his wishes as questions, radio signals beamed out in a search for intelligent life. Onscreen, Stiller’s face is an unmade bed of comic distress, but his daily aspect, in a black Ralph Lauren T-shirt, black Simon Miller jeans, and black Nikes, is ascetic and pensive. His green eyes bore into you, hoping to be understood but expecting otherwise. Stiller’s wife, the actress Christine Taylor, says that when they met, during an audition for a TV pilot he was directing, “I was almost uncomfortable with how much eye contact he was making, because in Hollywood everyone’s very polite and no one ever looks at you.”\n\nKurt Williams, the visual-effects producer, observed, “You’re going to have to move a lot of water in a tank to get that. Or, if you add the waves digitally, it’s forty thousand dollars a shot, and a two-million-dollar hit to our movie.” The budget was a concern. With shooting set to begin in three months, Twentieth Century Fox still hadn’t given the film a green light; Stiller and Fox remained nearly four million dollars apart. Prep is often the most stressful period in a production, the moment when the fantasy of what the movie could be meets the limitations of budget, time, and talent—and Stiller is tenacious in his defense of the most sumptuous version of a film. Jeff Mann said, “Ben’s always going to say, ‘Let’s find the best, most expensive examples that anyone has ever done, and use them as a template.’ It’s like, dude, this is a moment, in a comedy—it doesn’t have to be the stormiest storm ever.” But Stiller wanted “Mitty” to be much more than a standard studio comedy; he hoped to make a film so original that it would transform his image. Like Mitty, he dreamed of being someone different.\n\n“Well, less vapor than this,” Stiller told Williams. “But I like the crazy scary storm—it sells the shark even more. To me, it’s always been against the grain to do this in a tank in New York”—where much of the film would be shot, from April through July, before a final month in Iceland. “I thought we should take a small unit out in the Bering Sea and find the waves—more adventurous, more exciting, more real.”\n\n“This is the first I’m hearing this concern!” Mann said, feigning surprise. Stiller had said “real,” “handheld,” or “naturalistic” at least twenty times in the previous hour.\n\n“Yeah, but as much as I keep suggesting—”\n\n“We know!” Mann cried.\n\nStiller smiled repentantly. He often peers down at his own obsessiveness and finds it absurd. In “Tropic Thunder,” a 2008 film he directed and starred in that satirized Vietnam War movies, his character, an action star named Tugg Speedman, reflected with Stilleresque intensity on playing a dunce in a film called “Simple Jack.” “I just did the work,” Speedman explains. “Watched a lot of retarded people, spent time with them, observed them, watched all the retarded stuff they did.”\n\nMitty’s line producer, G. Mac Brown, made a note and said, “I’m certainly open to looking at a real trawler in Iceland.” Stiller gave Brown a provisional nod; he’d just hired him to replace someone who hadn’t panned out. Brown, who has worked on some thirty films, later told me, “This is probably the hardest one, because the fantasies are all distinctive, and because Ben is so determined that each one feel real.” Brown asked about Alpine Walter, the daydreamed mountain-climber persona who beguiles Cheryl with his derring-do. The snowy peak that would appear in the middle of Life’s offices would itself require a separate set, and Brown, eying the budget, wondered how Stiller planned to achieve the look of the “taller, chiselled” version of himself described in the screenplay.\n\n“Alpine Walter is an idealized version of Walter,” Stiller said. “Six feet or six-two, a dimple in the chin, with a perfect five-o’clock shadow that I don’t have. So, Viggo Mortensen meets me. Nothing prosthetic. Something you guys can do, by tweaking me digitally, to make it look real?” He stared at Kurt Williams, who nodded vigorously, not wishing to disappoint.\n\nThough five feet seven, Stiller is as much a leading man as Viggo Mortensen—from the right side. That’s the side that shows to best advantage his pearly teeth and bedroom eyes; the side we see alongside Michelle Monaghan or Jennifer Aniston. From the left, though, Stiller’s face seems custard-pie-ready. That’s the side that amplifies the jittery nods and frustrated winces and wide-eyed outcries—his eyebrows fleeing the lies his mouth is about to tell—that make him a straight man nonpareil.\n\nIf you ask the average person to name some movie stars, Brad Pitt and George Clooney and Will Smith will spring to mind, and Stiller will be an afterthought. In part, this is because Stiller is a whetstone, a generous actor who elicits his screen partners’ funniest and most unexpected work: think of Cameron Diaz’s flighty radiance in “There’s Something About Mary,” or Robert De Niro’s nimble bullying in “Meet the Parents.” And in part it’s because Stiller’s influence is so pervasive that it’s hard to recognize. “Ben is ground zero for everything in modern comedy,” Judd Apatow told me. “With ‘The Ben Stiller Show,’ he created the way modern sketch shows are shot, by employing the visual style of the thing he was parodying. And there’s not a stronger comedic director. People talk about improv in my movies, but it all comes from me watching Ben work.”\n\nAt forty-six, Stiller is arguably the world’s biggest comedic movie star, an audience magnet in both R-rated scabrousness and PG-rated family fun. He has sold more than five billion dollars’ worth of tickets to such comedies as “There’s Something About Mary,” “DodgeBall,” “Night at the Museum” (and its sequel), “Madagascar” (and its sequels), and “Meet the Parents” (and its sequels). He is the only actor with three billion-dollar franchises (the ones with sequels). Even when he’s hired only as an actor, he’ll take full responsibility for a film, from retooling the script to approving the director, assembling the cast, and overseeing how the scenes are edited together. Jeffrey Katzenberg, the founder and C.E.O. of DreamWorks Animation, who worked with Stiller on the three animated “Madagascar” films, cheerfully explains how their partnership operates: “Ben beats on me unmercifully with chains, sabres, and two-by-fours, delivering his anxieties, frustrations, and ambitions at full velocity.”\n\nStiller’s prodigious input can stun his collaborators; new arrivals to the “Tropic Thunder” set were told, “Welcome to Ben Stiller’s comedy death camp.” When Stiller asked John Hamburg to do a last-minute rewrite of the 2006 film “Night at the Museum,” the writer says, he found himself on “an eight-hour conference call, on my cell phone, with Ben in Hawaii, where he was supposedly on vacation. He had minute notes on every page: ‘Why am I enemies with Attila the Hun, if I’m friends with the cavemen? What’s the rationale?’ ”\n\nThe film’s director, Shawn Levy, who was also on the call, told me, “If you say, ‘Ben, I’m sorry, I have to go pee,’ you feel weak, because your bladder isn’t big enough. It may all sound like crazy perfectionism, but Ben’s process, which is basically ‘Don’t apologize for worrying about everything,’ is the single biggest reason that movie made over half a billion dollars.”\n\nStiller’s abiding dilemma is that he never intended to become a movie star, particularly one best known for getting his semen on his ear, his balls snagged in a zipper, and his face rubbed in a fat man’s sweaty belly and repeatedly slapped by a capuchin monkey. What he really loves to do is direct. It’s a cliché, of course—and he knows that, and it doesn’t help. Stiller’s films, particularly “Zoolander” and “Tropic Thunder,” both of which he co-wrote, are mordant, hilarious, and unexpectedly sweet. Will Ferrell says of “Zoolander,” which featured perhaps his funniest performance, “Ben made the fashion world seem epic.”\n\nYet studios are leery of Stiller as a director, both because his films go over budget and because they’d rather he star in three films a year for them than direct one. “It can’t be easy being Ben,” Robert Downey, Jr., who starred in “Tropic Thunder,” says. “The anger he has comes from the pressure, and the pressure comes from knowing he’s like Chaplin doing ‘A Woman of Paris,’ which nobody in Hollywood wanted him to do. Everyone associates Ben with clowning, when he actually has the ability to control tone and story and look to achieve something masterful. But that ability is always impeded by the shortcomings and shortsightedness of the people around him, and that’s a cancer that rips at his bowels.”\n\nNick Stevens, Stiller’s longtime agent, resembles his client in being slight, intense, and possessed of a puzzle-solving mind. After working for years to help make Stiller who he is, he is now trying to help launch Stiller, the sequel: an actor whose characters shape their own destinies; a director whose films don’t so much satirize a familiar world as create a new one. “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” could accomplish both goals—and at a time in Stiller’s life when his years as a star, and thus his years of nearly irresistible leverage, are numbered. Comedy stars usually get only ten years to twinkle before they become a red giant (Adam Sandler) or a white dwarf (Bill Murray) or go supernova and vanish entirely (Mike Myers). Stiller has already had fourteen. Stevens said, “ ‘Mitty’ is the win. It’s the greatest movie Ben’s ever had—a chance as a director to play with all the visual-effects bells and whistles of a big-budget film, as well as to convey emotion and tell a real story, and a chance as an actor to capture the more critical audience.”\n\nYet the movie’s very distinctiveness made Fox apprehensive; such a film, in the modern marketplace, doesn’t “pencil.” Stiller explained, “If I say to Fox that this movie is like ‘Little Miss Sunshine’ or ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,’ they freak out, understandably, because they’re spending real money and they need to sell it as a big comedy. So I keep referring to ‘Forrest Gump,’ because it wasn’t a big comedy, really, but it also made a bazillion dollars. I’m trying to do two things at once: make a movie that brings in a lot of people, but also one that will be really good, and will last.” Hollywood’s peculiar secret is that it’s just as tough to cook up a memorable commercial movie as a critically lauded indie film—indeed, because there are so many chefs over-egging the pudding, it’s tougher.\n\nFox expected to spend well over a hundred million dollars on the project, including global-marketing costs, and it wasn’t confident that the film would earn a profit. That forecast would usually end the discussion. But Fox has made four big hits with Stiller, and expects to make other, more safely commercial properties with him in the future. Tom Rothman, the chairman and C.E.O. of Fox Filmed Entertainment, denied that he would green-light the film simply to foster a relationship: “It’s too expensive for that.” But, he added, “We sleep pretty well when we’re in bed with Ben. Probably better than he does.”\n\nStudios exist to make money, but the people who run them also long to leave a mark. Rothman hosts “Fox Legacy,” on the Fox Movie Channel, and writes his own introductions to the studio’s classic films. He is aware that nine of last year’s ten top-grossing films were sequels, and that Fox’s forthcoming slate is dominated by sequels to “Taken,” “Ice Age,” “X-Men,” and “Die Hard.” “The movie business cannot only make comic books and sequels,” Rothman told me, “because at a certain point there would be no ‘Avatar 2’ or ‘Avatar 3,’ because there had been no ‘Avatar.’ At a certain point, probably now, you run out. So what you need is originality.” He grabbed my shoe and shook it for emphasis. “We had a great script, a rare and scary property: Walter Mitty is the Everyman’s Everyman, leading a life of quiet desperation. And movies can do what life can’t—they can make dreams come true. So we needed to make it happen, to take the big risk.” He paused, and added, “Responsibly, and protecting your shareholders, make it happen.”\n\nAfter meeting with his “Mitty” team until nearly midnight, Stiller returned the following day to the set of “The Watch,” a warehouse in Norcross, Georgia, made to resemble a Costco in Ohio. Stiller’s character, Evan, is the superstore’s officious but well-meaning manager. After his security guard is murdered, he forms a neighborhood watch group with three other guys, including characters played by Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill—and, when the killers turn out to be aliens, the group becomes Earth’s only defense.\n\nThe film, which Fox will release next month, is an R-rated buddy movie, and the atmosphere on the set was loose, with the thirty-four-year-old director, Akiva Schaffer, blasting Kanye West between takes, and Vaughn and Hill improvising hilariously filthy sequences. For Stiller, this kind of work is a day job—albeit one he takes seriously—that allows him to pursue his grander aspirations. Even as he kept up his end of the improvising, he also installed himself as a guardian of story and continuity, “so it’s not just ‘Cannonball Run,’ where they’re having fun in the outtakes.”\n\nIn one scene, the posse is hunting the aliens, who have chosen Evan’s Costco as their headquarters. When Stiller, Vaughn, and Hill hear an alien that they’ve already gunned down come back to life, they turn and blast it with their guns. Vaughn wondered, beforehand, if they should also set up the later revelation of the aliens’ critical weakness: “You can only kill these guys if you shoot them in the dick.”\n\n“That’s a good instinct,” Stiller said. “Let’s move it to after the shooting, for more sense of foreboding. I like Jonah saying, ‘Damn, these guys are hard to kill.’ ” Hill nodded.\n\nThey did a take, firing a fusillade of blanks and quarter-loads at a stuntman in a lizard suit. Standing over the supine alien, Stiller fired a last round, and then, after a beat, Vaughn fired a last round, and then Stiller fired, and Vaughn fired, and Stiller, after a long pause, fired a final last round. On “Cut!,” everyone cracked up. Vaughn told me, “The improv was a shorthand way of establishing the story point that, in fact, these aliens are really hard to kill. If you’re doing that, why not make it funny, too?”\n\nAs the cameras reset, Stiller asked if I wanted to play Ping-Pong. It was one of those pretend-casual games, on a table by the warehouse entrance, with a bunch of crew members watching. Stiller bent closer and closer to the table, fretful about his errors, expressing pained admiration for my windmilling forehand and then smiling at my attempted nonchalance about it. I pulled the game out, 21–18 (and then Stiller’s stunt double beat me by the same score). During the next few months, Stiller brought up the match more than once, mentioning that he’d taken some lessons, then doing a mischievous imitation of my forehand, exaggerating the motion as if desperately hailing a lifeguard.\n\nIt’s that sensitivity to others’ foibles which makes our eyes go to him onscreen. In “Meet the Fockers,” Robert De Niro insists that Stiller palpate the “man-ary gland,” a contraption for feeding milk to toddlers that De Niro’s character made from a cast of his daughter Debbie’s breast. Stiller warily touches it and says, “Oh, yeah, yeah, it’s got a great, lifelike, kinda . . .”—reacting to De Niro’s narrowed eyes—“or what I would imagine Debbie’s breast might actually feel like.” De Niro told me, “Ben just nods his head and it’s very funny, because he’s keeping his judgment to himself—but we can see it.”\n\nOn the set of “The Watch,” Jonah Hill took note of how Stiller was managing his image. “A lot of people falter when they get to be a big star, because they want to look cool all the time,” he said. “But Ben knows audiences like to see him get beat up a bit.” Stiller understands that he will never be Cary Grant—that he is the antonym of suave. In the 2004 film “Along Came Polly,” when Stiller learns the salsa to impress Jennifer Aniston, his dancing is all blocky determination, a Latin lover crossed with a Humvee. It’s this quality that makes him “relatable,” in the studio parlance, since most of us are at best effortful amateurs in whatever we do.\n\nStill, Nick Stevens said, “I think Ben is sensitive about playing too many put-upon losers.” In a later “Watch” scene, Evan and his wife (Rosemarie DeWitt) come to the aid of a policeman who’s bleeding copiously from an alien encounter. Stiller did a few takes sternly, and then, at Schaffer’s suggestion, a couple where he said, “You’re going to be fine,” then shook his head at DeWitt and mouthed, “He’s going to die.” It was right in Stiller’s wheelhouse; the lie another character doesn’t see but we do. Then the director said, “Can we do one where you’re grossed out by the blood? Not grossed out in a pussy way, but where you have fun with it?” Stiller nodded, but didn’t. Stevens explained, “He’s trying to find a greater sense of cool in this role, not just be a suburban lap-bitch.”\n\nFinding a director for “The Watch” wasn’t easy. Stiller vetoed a few candidates, and several others declined the job, having heard that, as one director put it, he can “leave directors rocking in a corner.” Stiller is loyal to those in his inner circle; “He’s a 3 A.M. guy if you need him,” the screenwriter Jerry Stahl says. But he can also beckon you close with one hand even as the other halts you at the border. So co-workers often consult with one of his intimates—the “Ben whisperers,” as they are known—before knocking on Stiller’s door. If he’s being asked to do something embarrassing, he needs to feel loved and supported.\n\n“It’s always interesting trying to direct somebody who is ultimately your boss,” Schaffer, who previously directed hip-hop spoof videos at “Saturday Night Live,” said. “When Ben would say, ‘Do you want to do a cool shot of me over there?,’ I’d say, ‘Yeah!,’ where with another actor it would be ‘What the fuck are you talking about?’ And if you make a mistake he’s going to notice, where the other actors won’t—‘Shouldn’t the walkie-talkie be blue?’ And then I feel stupid, and I realize I’d better see every prop and setup before Ben does.”\n\nStiller often starts with the premise that a joke or a character arc is inadequate, a form of pessimism that usually galvanizes his colleagues and sometimes paralyzes them. He said, “I want people who have strong ideas, and who stand up for them. But it’s a tough balance, for Akiva, when I say, ‘Be an auteur—but, oh, by the way, that’s not funny, and I’m not doing that scene.’ ” He laughed, a little sadly. “While you do have to place your trust in a director, ultimately the audience holds me responsible—it’s a Ben Stiller movie if it fails.”\n\nIn 2009, Stiller played the supporting role of a randy music teacher in a small Paramount Vantage film called “The Marc Pease Experience.” The completed film fell well short of his hopes. “Paramount could have put it out there as the next big Ben Stiller movie,” he says, “but that would have been fooling the audience.” Nick Stevens called Paramount to ask the studio to weigh the short-term loss of limiting the film’s release against the long-term relationship with his filmmaker. Paramount released the film domestically in just ten theatres for a single week, and it grossed exactly $4,033. It couldn’t fail, because it never really happened.\n\nThere was a glorious era, way back five years ago, when Hollywood studios bestrode the earth. Of the fifty billion dollars that the six major studios grossed in 2007, almost half came from DVD sales and rentals, an extremely lucrative business that boosted the studios’ combined profit margin to 10.5 per cent. In those palmy days, the biggest stars regularly secured “20/20” deals—twenty million dollars for playing a role, against twenty per cent of all the film’s revenues (save for DVDs, of which they get a much smaller percentage).\n\nBut even then domestic movie attendance was dropping; it has now fallen twenty per cent in the past decade. Factors that had nibbled at audience loyalty began to gnaw: gas prices; and digital piracy; and tweets and texts that killed films on opening night; and Redbox and Netflix; and the difficulty of reaching the most fervent moviegoers—seventeen-to-twenty-year-old men—with television ads; and, surely, the damp-squib films that the studios turned out in an increasingly anxious effort to retain their restless customers.\n\nThen the DVD market tanked, and studios’ over-all margins fell to a combined 8.1 per cent. The major studios are small divisions of international conglomerates, such as Sony and Viacom, and, as one studio head observes, the declining margins mean that “our owners don’t need us to swing for the fences at all costs in hopes we can justify our existence. If we don’t make smart decisions, they’ll just reduce the number of films we make.” In 2006, the studios released a hundred and thirty-one films; last year, only a hundred and four.\n\n“We now green-light fewer movies that are just O.K.,” Rob Moore, the vice-chairman of Paramount Pictures, said. “You have to feel a movie is special enough to have a chance to get the teen-ager off the couch from playing Call of Duty with his friends. But movies that are really special are big risks, and big risks are the hardest ones to say yes to.”\n\nStudios believe that to lure teen-agers—or their parents—off the couch a big-budget film must provide some combination of visual spectacle, gut-busting laughs, clutch-your-boyfriend scares, or strong emotions. It also needs “set pieces”—the boisterous, highly engineered moments that anchor a film’s trailer. Few of us recall how “Borat” resolved the hero’s infatuation with Pamela Anderson, but everyone remembers the naked wrestling scene.\n\nThen you need a whiz-bang ending, one that sends audiences out of the theatres texting in rapture. This requirement explains why many studio films fall apart in the last half hour, are reshot, and still don’t work. Stuart Cornfeld, Ben Stiller’s producing partner, observes, “You can keep the emotions real in a movie for two acts. Then you have to make that right turn toward a climax, which has to be more exciting than anything else in the movie, and suddenly the events are not dictated by the emotions but by getting the hero to the mountain, where the dynamite is about to explode—or you have to stop the movie to do the scenes where the hero comes to terms with his feelings and is honest with the woman he loves.”\n\nAnd then, sometimes, to service all those requirements—but only sometimes now—you need a star.\n\nA star, to the industry, is someone who can dependably get a film “open”—that is, can lure people to see it on opening weekend. A star, to the rest of us, is the person our eyes are always drawn to onscreen. Stars come in two distinct varieties. A sirloin star like Brad Pitt is someone people long for, or long to be. A hamburger star like Ben Stiller is someone whose struggles and triumphs give us vicarious satisfaction.\n\nThe job description is changing, however, and the job itself is endangered. The leading stars today—Pitt, Stiller, Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Denzel Washington, Adam Sandler, Angelina Jolie, George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Sandra Bullock—have all been around awhile. Yet plenty of people who were big stars ten years ago now are not: Keanu Reeves, Mel Gibson, Demi Moore, Tom Hanks, Reese Witherspoon, Russell Crowe, Nicolas Cage, John Travolta—the list goes on, as the constellation shrinks. “All the furor surrounding Elizabeth Taylor’s death was an elegy for the kind of movie star we used to have,” Terry Press, a leading film-marketing consultant, says. “People were mourning the loss of larger-than-life personas.”\n\nStudios have labored to make new stars, putting forward the likes of Orlando Bloom and Topher Grace and Josh Hartnett and Kate Hudson, but moviegoers have the ultimate say. They will anoint a star only if they warm to him or her in a series of films and then are dazzled by a crowning performance. Yet the kind of mid-budget, actor-showcasing films that mint stars—“Bull Durham” for Kevin Costner; “L.A. Confidential” for Russell Crowe; “Pretty Woman” for Julia Roberts—are now rare.\n\nPart of the problem is the ubiquity of “pre-awareness” titles, those adapted from comic books, video games, and young-adult novels. “If half your movies are about capes, not people, how can you make movie stars?” the director Will Gluck wonders. Whenever a new face does emerge—a Ryan Reynolds or a Jeremy Renner—studios jockey to put him in a cape. But a caped dynamo is a piston that powers the plot, rather than a repository of our inmost wishes.\n\nIf you require stars less often, and your profits are sinking, then their income can seem objectionable. Stars with a twenty-million-dollar “quote” now often receive just ten to fifteen million, which is barely worth getting out of bed for. Studios are increasingly bypassing stars altogether, making entertainments—“Transformers,” “Real Steel,” “Cars”—that largely dispense with the traditional sine qua non of the movies, the human face. Such films are intended to surmount the idiosyncrasies of the global bazaar by serving as a kind of cinematic Esperanto. “A person may come across differently in each market,” Stacey Snider, the C.E.O. of DreamWorks Studios, says. “A robot is a robot around the world.”\n\nYet stars continue to be vital to the small subset of movies that lack pre-awareness, many of which are comedies; Stiller is one of the last of this breed. Marketing departments use stars as hieroglyphs that tell you—in the few seconds it takes to whiz by a billboard—what the film is about. For this to work, the star must be advertising exactly the kind of film you’d expect. Adam Fogelson, the chairman of Universal Pictures, says, “ ‘Safe House’ was a safe bet for us, because Denzel Washington playing a bad-ass is a full-fledged reason for people to buy movie tickets.” Studios don’t want, say, Adam Sandler to reinvent himself, for the same reason McDonald’s doesn’t want the Hamburglar to reinvent himself.\n\nUniversal marketed Stiller’s recent film “Tower Heist” with a scene in which an antic Stiller smashes a Maserati with a golf club. Fogelson acknowledges that Stiller’s character was actually cagey and long-suffering but says, “What we need is twenty seconds of sellable material. And for that you go to what the audience likes and wants.” Stiller is convinced that the picture’s box-office—it grossed a hundred and fifty-three million dollars worldwide, basically breaking even—was constrained by its marketing: “But, no matter how much I made my position known, I would never have gotten the studio around to doing something that was so inventive that they’d say, ‘Wow! Ben really told me how to do my job better! Thanks!’ ”\n\nIn February, Robert Downey told me, “I got an e-mail this morning from my agents saying that the success of ‘Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows’ made it a billion-dollar franchise. They said, ‘That gives you two billion-dollar franchises’ ”—along with “Iron Man”—“ ‘and only five people have done that.’ Such e-mails remind you that this business, from the studios’ point of view, is about whore stewardship.”\n\nHollywood has been interested in “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” since Thurber’s story was first published: the idea of a timid man who longs to do momentous things is an extraordinarily relatable one. In 1947, Samuel Goldwyn adapted the story into a hit film starring Danny Kaye, and the film has since almost been remade numerous times, beginning in 1994, when Samuel Goldwyn, Jr., developed the project for New Line and Jim Carrey, and continuing under the stewardship of John Goldwyn, the patriarch’s grandson. As twelve successive writers or writing teams tried to crack a more contemporary version of the story, the project went to Paramount and then to Fox, and was offered to Carrey again, as well as to Owen Wilson, Mike Myers, and Johnny Depp. The quest became something of a protracted séance, an attempt to conjure up the bygone glamour of the studio system in the days of the original Goldwyn, when M-G-M boasted of having “more stars than there are in heaven.” One executive who tried to get the film made said, “The fact that everyone had put so much time and money into it convinced everyone else that there must be something there—while at the same time causing them to hesitate, for fear that it hadn’t worked for everyone else because it had some fatal flaw.”\n\nStiller was offered the role in 2005 and turned it down. But when Fox sent him a new draft by Steve Conrad, in March of 2011, he liked that it didn’t resemble a studio comedy. The third act, he told me, “isn’t about a lot of crazy shit happening but just about these two people getting together—it felt like ‘It’s a Wonderful Life.’ ” When Stiller decided that he wanted not only to star in the film but to direct it, he proceeded as if that were a fait accompli, showing Fox a four-minute sizzle reel—a “rip-o-matic” montage of borrowed film clips—to indicate what he had in mind. The images ranged from the cavernous office of “The Apartment” to war footage from CNN. There was also a snippet from a commercial in which a London building exploded in a rain of colors, an image that had inspired Stiller’s planned title sequence: Walter’s head, stuffed with florid scenarios, would explode “like a firecracker piñata.”\n\nTom Rothman found the assemblage astute and lyrical, and he was willing to consider Stiller as his director—especially as it wouldn’t hurt in securing him as his star. Still, it was a thorny situation. Scott Rudin, who produced “Zoolander,” says, “Studios always hope they don’t have to fight with the movie star, though they’re perfectly willing to fight with the director. When the movie star is the director, it gets very complicated.” “Zoolander” is now seen as a touchstone comedy, but it was a troubled project. At one point, Paramount brought in another writer to replace Stiller, and wanted Brendan Fraser to play the male-model role that Stiller had dreamed up for himself. When the shoot went six million dollars over budget, Stiller had to pay a seven-figure penalty before the studio would let him finish the film. “I don’t regret that,” he said. “I do regret the end-title sequence they wouldn’t let me do, even though it was only sixty thousand dollars—this great thing of Will Ferrell dancing. God, do I regret that.” And, while “Tropic Thunder” made a small profit, it, too, was a tug-of-war that went fifteen million dollars over budget.\n\nFox also had script issues. Mitty’s fantasies felt too random for a studio release; they had to be given a clear arc that would illustrate Mitty’s clear goal. “The bigger the budget, the cleaner the concept needs to be,” Universal’s Fogelson explains. “Because you need to appeal not just to all four quadrants”—women as well as men, those younger than twenty-five as well as those older—“but to people who speak every language under the sun. So ambiguity and darkness are tough.”\n\nStiller was determined to retain Steve Conrad’s voice, and not have it diluted by a “punch up” mill, a tool he himself has often used: a roomful of writers who swarm a script like doctors resuscitating a gunshot victim. So he met with him in Hawaii, New York, and Los Angeles, for days at a time, and they devised a new progression of set-piece fantasies. Stacey Snider, of DreamWorks, says, “Ben is incredibly calm and specific about what’s missing from a film. After the test screenings of ‘Tropic Thunder,’ he said, ‘They’re not getting on board with my character.’ So he shot a new scene where Tyra Banks interviews his character, Tugg, and says, ‘Somebody close to you said, “One more flop and it’s over.” ’ And Tugg looks amazed and says, ‘Somebody said they were close to me?’ Suddenly you liked him, and that had a profound effect on our ‘definite recommends’—and therefore on our box-office.”\n\nIn his first set of notes, Stiller wrote, “Walter’s fantasies need to spring clearly and specifically from his emotional dynamics and turmoil.” At the end of Conrad’s first draft, Walter became an inadvertent symbol of class protest at a meeting of the G8, and wound up onstage singing with Rage Against the Machine. John Goldwyn explains, “It was ‘God damn it, I’m a man,’ an anger that was not the most emotionally satisfying thing for an audience to endure.” The sequence was one of the first things Stiller cut.\n\nThe script hadn’t specified why Walter was a daydreamer; to deepen the story, Stiller felt that the movie needed what the director Sidney Lumet called a “rubber ducky” scene—a handy explanation, usually rooted in childhood, for a character’s issues (it’s all because his mother took his rubber ducky away that time). So Walter’s woolgathering was given a root cause; his father’s death, when he was seventeen, which had forced him to give up his plans to travel and instead take a job at a Papa John’s pizzeria. He became not an existential hero, washed to and fro, but a screen hero who took charge of his life, thereby making himself worthy of his love interest. Stiller gradually made the script less tone poem and more major-key symphony. Jeff Mann observed, “Ben has tried to steer the film toward marketability without cutting the heart out of the cerebral, surreal bits. Do I love the über pop references now in it? I don’t. But we’re not making a movie only for forty-six-year-olds. We’re also making it for fourteen-year-olds.”\n\nTom Rothman continued to worry that the movie wouldn’t feel big-laugh funny. When Stiller flew to Los Angeles in late September, he spent the trip marking every point in the script where he thought the audience would laugh. Then, half in jest, he handed the script to Rothman and said, “There are a hundred and thirty jokes here, so I think it’s pretty clearly a comedy.” With that resolved, they had to cast the part of Cheryl. Stiller had been imagining a quiet actress with a low profile, but he acceded to Rothman’s suggestion, Kristen Wiig, and started wooing her. In December, Stiller said, “I called Tom and said, ‘Kristen wants to be in it for the same reason I do—because it’s not the broad comedy people associate with her.’ Tom said, ‘I totally get it. And it’s a great thing on our end, because it gives people the sense that it will be funny.’ ” They were tacitly agreeing to build in the standard cognitive dissonance, where Stiller could make the movie he envisioned, more or less, and Fox could sell the movie it believed audiences would actually want to see.\n\nOn a Sunday in January, the “Mitty” crew met in the living room of Stiller’s rented stone house, high on a hill in Buckhead, Georgia, to work through four of the film’s set pieces. The gas fire was blazing, but the patio doors were open to the cool mist and rain of the winter afternoon. DVDs teetered in towers everywhere; Stiller would often stay up late with Jeff Mann, watching films such as “The Apartment” and “The Graduate” and “Being There” and “Play Time,” hoping to reverse-engineer a style, a mood, an impalpable majesty. The first actor Stiller had cast, as Walter’s mother, was Shirley MacLaine, who’d starred in “The Apartment” and “Being There.”\n\nThe director sat by the trays of crackers and crudités that materialize before his every meeting and asked his animators to screen a “pre-visualization”—roughly animated footage akin to moving storyboards—of the film’s most expensive and elaborate set piece, one that would surely anchor Fox’s trailers and television ads: the Ted-Walter fight. When Walter is teased by his boss, Ted, because he’s holding a Stretch Armstrong figure in the elevator, he imagines an epic battle over the toy. The two men hurl each other through the elevator and building walls, fall to the street, then use their superpowers to ski and snowboard after each other on chunks of pavement they’ve churned up, doing aerial tricks as they race along. Complex, kinetic, and difficult to shoot, the scene would require both precisely choreographed maneuvering with rigs and cranes in midtown Manhattan and a generous overlay of digital wizardry. It had been optimistically budgeted at ten million dollars, but its costs were already rising well above that, even as the film remained over budget.\n\nStiller ran the sequence five times, his thumb and forefinger rubbing his lower lip, and whittled it from 3:30 to 2:58. “We can’t tell it here,” he said, “but people are going to get bored.” Shorter would also be cheaper. The director called to one of his assistants and asked for his hoodie. When she brought it, he said, “That’s not the one I was thinking about, though. There’s a Ralph Lauren one.” She returned with a second hoodie, but Stiller was back in the flow, discussing how to film another fantasy. After Stiller suggested that Walter see his whole life with Cheryl play out, Conrad had written a montage inspired by “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” in which Brad Pitt ages backward. Walter, who never saw the film, tells Cheryl, “I have that Benjamin Buttons thing where I get old but smaller or whatever, so I’ll be a gradual old baby or something”; she then cares for him as he rapidly shrinks and withers. Stiller now murmured to Conrad that Emma Watts, Fox’s president of production, had told him, “I don’t know if I’m rooting for Walter if he’s a little man I’m holding,” to which Stiller had replied, “Well, it’s the funniest scene in the movie.”\n\nThe filmmakers had a giddy debate about the prosthetics and oversized clothes necessary to sell the beginning of the montage, before they would have recourse to “a scary old little child’s body,” “a head replacement,” and, finally, “a withered old man.” Everyone kept cracking up at the prospect of attaching the production’s jet engines to this goofy little red wagon of a bit. Conrad grinned and shook his head: “That’s not even how ‘Benjamin Button’ works.”\n\n“That’s the beauty of it!” Stiller assured him. “That it makes no sense.”\n\nIf Benjamin Edward Meara Stiller had wanted to become a chef or an osteopath, he chose the wrong family. When he was born, in 1965, his parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, were a popular comedy team known for their daffy bickering on “The Ed Sullivan Show.” The friends who came to their New Year’s Eve parties on the Upper West Side—William Hurt, Mary Travers, James Coco—embraced Ben and his older sister, Amy, laughed late into the night, then zoomed off in a cloud of glamour. It was the kind of sheltered, complicated, have-another-cocktail Manhattan upbringing where you never quite learn how to run a washing machine. Jerry and Anne were often on the road, and Stiller says, “I remember watching a lot of TV—‘Gilligan’s Island,’ ‘The Brady Bunch,’ ‘Bewitched,’ and ‘Star Trek’ reruns. All the colors were so rich and vivid, and that California back-lot reality seemed very comforting.”\n\nWhen Stiller was six, Anne and Jerry guest-hosted “The Mike Douglas Show” and brought Amy and Benjy, as he was called, onstage to play the violin. As he shouldered his instrument, Meara told him, “Relax, there’s just thirty million people watching.” Then the children sawed their way through a painful version of “Chopsticks,” as the camera lingered on Meara’s look of pride and amusement and distress.\n\n“It didn’t seem that bad at the time,” Stiller said. “It was exciting to go down to Philadelphia in a stretch limo and have lobster at Bookbinder’s. And show business is filled with moments like that, humiliating moments where you’re putting yourself out there, like in ‘All That Jazz,’ with the chorus girls.” But you weren’t putting yourself out there, I observed. “Yeah. Yeah,” Stiller said, intensifying his gaze. “Now I look at it and go, Wow, pretty rough.” Meara says, “Amy and Ben knew they couldn’t play the violin. Jerry loved it, but it was one of the worst days of my life.”\n\nIn later years, Stiller would often put his parents in his films. Jerry Stiller says that, when he appeared in “Zoolander,” “Ben was acting with me, and also directing me—‘Do it this way, Dad. No, this way.’ He wanted perfection, and I was getting a little huffy. I didn’t even want to be in the movie.” Meara interjected, “Jerry was afraid people would think he was riding on his son’s coattails.” “Yeah, something like that,” he admitted. “Ben was ahead of me, in a lot of ways. Everything I could never do, Ben could do.”\n\nWhen Stiller was nine, his father gave him a Fuji Super 8 camera, and he was soon casting and shooting ambitious home movies, such as a remake of “Airport 1975,” in which his father had a role. By thirteen, Ben had a subscription to American Cinematographer. Though his dream was to direct and star in the kind of angsty films made by Woody Allen and Albert Brooks, he venerated Hollywood blockbusters. He watched “The Poseidon Adventure” dozens of times, always amazed by the kid who shinnies up the Christmas tree: “I remember thinking, That’s the coolest thing ever, the kid taking this chance.” Years later, on “The Royal Tenenbaums,” Stiller worked up the nerve to tell Gene Hackman how much his work in “The Poseidon Adventure” had affected him. Stiller recalls, “He smiled, after a beat, and said, ‘Money job.’ ”\n\n“My dad was really driven to be funny, but I was more like my mom,” Stiller told me. “She didn’t want to do the comedy—that was my dad’s idea. So she approached it skeptically, through satire.” Stiller left U.C.L.A. in the spring of his freshman year, in 1984, then took small roles as an actor before making a five-minute parody of Martin Scorsese’s 1986 film “The Color of Money” which got passed around Hollywood. That got him a job performing on “Saturday Night Live,” in 1989, but he quit after only five episodes to do a show on MTV. Amy Stiller says, “Around then, he got really into changing his diet, and working out a lot, and taking care of his skin with something called L’Peau Neuve. I don’t think he was that happy.” In 1992, the Fox network gave him a bigger platform, “The Ben Stiller Show,” which featured Stiller doing loving sendups of such braggadocious figures as Tony Robbins and Tom Cruise. Judd Apatow, who executive-produced the program with Stiller, says, “Some weeks, Ben would blow the entire budget on an Oliver Stone theme-park sketch, making it look amazingly real.”\n\nThe show won Stiller an Emmy—by which time it had been cancelled. It also secured him his first directing job, on a 1994 film called “Reality Bites.” A slight but engaging look at Generation X, it demonstrated Stiller’s yearning for grand compositions. Michael Shamberg, the producer who conceived the film, says of its most memorable scene, “The Ed Ruscha gas station where they’re dancing under the stars”—to the song “My Sharona”—“that’s all Ben.” Stiller saw himself chiefly as a director, and the studios that considered producing the film were reluctant to have him appear in it. But he’d improvised so much of one character’s dialogue with the screenwriter that he wound up taking the part. His portrayal of Michael, an executive at an MTV-like network, was the first big-screen display of the ambivalent Stiller persona: when his love interest, Lelaina (Winona Ryder), tells him that she plans to make a documentary about a generation without an identity, Michael says, “Wow, that’s . . . that’s . . . that sounds great. It seems like your friends would be perfect for that.”\n\nIn 1995, Stiller was offered the chance to direct “The Cable Guy,” starring Jim Carrey as a loutish cable installer. Carrey, notoriously, got the first twenty-million-dollar deal, and, as notoriously, the film proved curdled and bleak. Stiller says, “I still remember the first line of the Times review: ‘The true disaster film of the summer may just be “The Cable Guy” ’—ooh! It was all such a smackdown—wow!”\n\n“That was a big moment for Ben,” Stiller’s friend Scott Smith says. “It was his attempt to combine two possible routes: a big studio film and his naturally darker sensibility, which is on the verge of socially inappropriate—and people didn’t like it. I think he learned to keep the two routes separate.”\n\nStiller says that Nick Stevens told him, “You’re in movie jail, so you need to sh-h-h for a bit.” Shelving his directorial dreams, Stiller acted in four films that appeared in 1998. One of them, “There’s Something About Mary,” unexpectedly grossed three hundred and seventy million dollars around the world and made him a star.\n\nStiller’s casting process for “Mitty” was typically meticulous: in the course of fourteen audition sessions, in Manhattan and Los Angeles, he read with up to fifty aspirants for each of thirty-four parts. The actors evidently believed that to have any kind of chance they’d have to signal that they already belonged in his world. So their greetings, on both coasts, lunged toward intimacy: “Steve Conrad is my Obi Wan”; “We met many years ago, at Laura Linney’s first wedding”; “I just worked with Noah Baumbach—synchronicity!” One man threw himself on the mercy of the court, murmuring only, “I have a really nice-shaped head.”\n\nWhile unfailingly polite, Stiller came alive only when someone’s acting tickled him. Afterward, he and his casting director, Rachel Tenner, would exchange a quick verdict: “droopy dog” (good); “crazy mannequin” (good but not great); “a not-gay Paul Lynde” (very good); “character-y” (bad); “thyroid eyeballs” (good); “looks like he would have turned you in during the war” (superb). It became clear that he favored crafty improvisers and, contrarily, people with big heads and wide eyes, innocents who almost didn’t seem to be actors.\n\nStiller has a knack for noticing the people who, three years later, everyone notices. He was a distant-early-warning system for the writers John Hamburg and Justin Theroux and such actors as Jack Black and Will Ferrell. After spotting Owen Wilson in “Bottle Rocket,” Stiller gave him his first studio-film role, in “The Cable Guy.” The two became close friends and have appeared together in ten films. Wilson recalls that early on they’d walk around Central Park spitballing movie ideas into Stiller’s tape recorder, and Stiller would often say “Yeah, yeah!” to the beginning of Wilson’s idea and then quietly flick the recorder off to save the tape.\n\nThey had great chemistry: the tense but secretly sensitive brunet and the chilled-out but secretly sensitive blond. In “Meet the Parents,” Wilson plays the all-American ex-fiancé of Stiller’s girlfriend. At one point, he began to improv a reminiscence about her with Stiller, saying, “Boy, she is a tomcat. Whoo!” When he looked off into the middle distance, recalling their torrid couplings, Stiller followed Wilson’s gaze, seething but also curious to see what might be out there.\n\nAt the end of a casting session at the Post Factory, in SoHo, Stiller read with Brian Scott McFadden and Dion Graham, who were auditioning to be T.S.A. officers who interview Walter upon his return from ungoverned Afghanistan. After they ran the lines, Stiller had them swap roles. Then he switched them back and gave McFadden two of Graham’s lines—a runner of curiosity about Walter’s new beard—and suggested, “Do it more like this guy pisses you off.” To Graham, he said only, “You could maybe do a bit less, because you have a lot of natural charisma.” The scene came alive: a stoic cop and a peevish one, an uncoöperative subject, mounting suspicion. When McFadden unleashed a nasal cry of skepticism—“With your beard?”—Stiller broke up. “That was awesome,” he said. “Awesome!” He hired them both.\n\n“There’s Something About Mary” holds a viewer’s interest now because of the sweetness of Stiller’s crush on Cameron Diaz, its hapless ardor. But what distinguished the film when it came out was the set pieces: Stiller getting his penis stuck in his zipper; Stiller masturbating to bra ads and misplacing the semen; Stiller being savaged by Mary’s speed-addled dog. He remains somewhat astonished by what those set pieces did for him. After “Meet the Parents” certified his stardom, in 2000, he could get a movie made with barely a wave of his hand. When he called Nick Stevens with the idea of adapting a seventies cop show and said, “I’ve got five words for you—Owen Wilson, ‘Starsky & Hutch,’ ” that was pretty much all Warner Bros. needed to hear. Stiller told me, “Honestly, when it started I was just stepping into a Farrelly brothers movie. That thing that I suddenly became known for . . . man-child . . . humiliations”—he batted the words away—“broad physical comedy was never my goal. It never excited me.”\n\nIt became his job description. When his friend John Hamburg, the writer-director of “Along Came Polly,” asked him to crown a pickup-basketball scene by having his face smeared across a fat man’s sweaty belly, Stiller says, “I said, ‘Really? Really, I have to do it?’ I’m glad it was in the movie, but it’s also something I don’t ever have to do again.” Stiller often seems uncomfortable with the idea of himself as a cutup. “Will Ferrell is a hundred times funnier than I am,” he says. “When people tell me I’m funny, I think, Oh, really? What scene?” He began to vet scripts for indignities, and told Shawn Levy, on “Night at the Museum,” that while he’d let the capuchin monkey slap him, because it was funny, he wouldn’t wear the night watchman’s hat—“I look ridiculous in hats”—or ride the dinosaur. A studio executive who knows Stiller well says, “You can see throughout Ben’s oeuvre that he feels like a hired fool pantomiming for the gaping masses. The jester is even the symbol of his company, Red Hour.”\n\nSoon after he became a star, Stiller began dating Christine Taylor, who had played Marcia in “The Brady Bunch Movie,” and the couple wed in 2000. Taylor says that, in the early years of their marriage, “Ben was getting movies left and right and they were making money and he didn’t know how to say no, and I was struggling to keep my own career going—and neither of us knew how to do any of it.”\n\nA few years ago, Stiller was keen to make “The Mirror,” a corrosive screenplay written by his friend Scott Smith and loosely derived from Stiller’s life. In it, he tells his wife, who would have been played by Taylor, “Know what I am? A dancing monkey! You and I both—a pair of fools capering for the crowd.” The script’s Stiller splits into two people: a capable sellout who adores his career and is beloved by all, and the messier but more human Ben, a teller of unsettling truths who wants to walk away from his fame. (Stiller’s mother, who was also a character, vetoed the project.) Stiller said that a dancing monkey “was more of a Scott Smith interpretation than how I see myself, but you are a diversion for some people in life. When I go on Twitter and say, ‘Hey, check out this article by Paul Farmer’ ”—a doctor heavily involved in health care in Haiti, where Stiller’s foundation has built schools—“people respond, ‘You have the worst tweets! Be funny!’ ”\n\nRevamping your image as a star isn’t easy. Basically, you’re telling your audience, “I want to see other people.” Three years ago, Stiller really wanted to star in “Greenberg,” a small film written and directed by Noah Baumbach, in which he would play Roger Greenberg, a misanthropic carpenter. So he enticed Universal to green-light the film by agreeing to star in “Little Fockers,” the third and feeblest “Fockers” installment. Stiller, like many stars, usually massages a screenplay so he can play a version of himself, but on “Greenberg” he worked diligently with his acting coach to try to become Roger. “I didn’t have to worry about my responsibility to the studio, and about opening weekend,” Stiller said. “If I had—if the film were designed to reach all four quadrants—there would have been an early scene where you see Roger not getting a job, or getting snubbed, where you ingratiate him with the audience.” Instead, Stiller’s character was resolutely withholding. Despite the film’s integrity—or perhaps because of it—it was not beloved: “Little Fockers” made three hundred and eleven million dollars worldwide, “Greenberg” only six.\n\nStiller is still working to improve the behavior that, in the first years of his stardom, earned him a reputation as a hair-trigger guy who ignored the crew and could berate anyone who challenged his dictates. Some of his most arduous battles with directors had a self-lacerating aspect, as they erupted on films such as “Envy” and “Duplex,” which would have been forgettable even if they’d been brilliantly realized. One top agent said of Stiller, “He’s a tough customer, because he’s truly enraged by the crap he’s doing.” And a marketer who worked closely with the actor observed, “A lot of what he asks for is some variation of ‘Take me seriously.’ And he believes you’ll only take him seriously if he’s overbearing, prickly, and rude.”\n\nThe actor also became known for being unusually particular about who got to fly with him on the studio’s plane. When I brought this up, Stiller grimaced and joked, “I’ve got to get new plane people.” He acknowledged that his wish for control hasn’t always sat comfortably with the multiplier effect that stardom gave to his every mood. “The me who I am,” he said, “is not the guy who walks into the room and everyone is looking at him.”\n\nStiller stood slightly self-consciously in a short-sleeved green shirt, a tie with a tie clip, and slacks. It was his first camera test at Kaufman Astoria, to see which combination of clothes and makeup made him look most Mittyish. Lori Guidroz, Stiller’s hair stylist, kept her gaze on the star’s newly trimmed hair. “On ‘The Watch,’ his character was uptight, so Ben’s hair was longer, very combed, very groomed,” she said. “But I see Walter Mitty as a little boyish.”\n\nNow Stiller, who kept popping out to check his look on the monitor, beckoned Guidroz over and said, “I worry it might be a little too cool. Maybe it should be more retro and then get more contemporary?” Mitty’s hair was one of many elements that would subtly change to indicate his growth; the movie’s color palette would become increasingly saturated, and a shift from flat to anamorphic camera lenses would make the images more vivid; the music would grow more evocative of his bygone youth; and his clothing would shift from business bland to casual and distinctive. Stiller’s makeup artist, Sarah Mays, was planning her own arc. “I’m starting off grainy, gritty, and pale,” she said. “A lavender undertone to a white foundation. I’m not emphasizing his strong brow, so this is also his more meek and vulnerable look. Then, later in the film, we’ll try something more romantic, working in some pink.” She hastened to clarify: “I don’t tell him I’m using pink. I call it ‘warming him up.’ ”\n\nThe crew seemed jittery, and Stiller twice stopped to confer with his producers; Tom Rothman had recently told him that the budget absolutely had to come down by four million dollars. Though Stiller knew that the movie hung in the balance, he had called his wife and said, “I can’t do it.” Having earlier urged him to make the movie at any budget, she now invoked the calming phrase they use with each other, “Deep breath.”\n\nAs the crew broke for lunch, Tim Trella, the stunt coördinator, edged into Stiller’s field of vision and showed him some video he’d shot on his iPad: two crew members on wires, enacting the start of the Ted-Walter fight on the elevator set. “It should have more of a ‘Bourne’ feeling,” Stiller said, frowning. “And it’s missing a few of the shots, so it feels like jump cuts. I can’t really see it.”\n\nStiller told me that he wished he’d been able to shoot the video himself, or appear in it, or both. “Directing while acting is kind of like being Walter Mitty—you’re here but not here,” he said. “A lot of the frustration is just not being able to be in two places at once.” He has sometimes imagined a cleaner path, in which he attended a small New England college for four years, or directed the thriller he was working on after “Reality Bites,” or in which “There’s Something About Mary” hadn’t become such a hit. Those roads would all have led to him becoming a director who made not just comedies but also small, serious movies: “I would have been just as content, I’d have been a better director, and it would have been a lot less complicated.”\n\nStiller’s first passion project was “What Makes Sammy Run?,” a script that he and Jerry Stahl adapted in the late nineties from the Budd Schulberg novel about Sammy Glick, a hustling movie exec who finds it very lonely at the top. They never found a buyer. Stiller has also been trying for fifteen years to make a film called “CivilWarLand in Bad Decline,” from George Saunders’s bleak story about murderous doings at a Civil War theme park, to no avail, even with Owen Wilson and Sean Penn attached and a budget pared to fifteen million dollars. Saunders, who wrote the screenplay under Stiller’s tutelage, said, “It was the reverse of the cliché about the pandering movie guy and the noble fiction writer, because I would absolutely have sold out to get the movie made—added car chases, a puppy cluster, whatever—and Ben always insisted on returning to the darkest, oddest version of this story.”\n\nAfter gravely cataloguing these failures, Stiller said, “You get a little weary of going out to the town, going out to the town, going out to the town, and you think, Maybe I should try to make something that people want me to make.”\n\nOne bright February morning, Stiller sat at a large marble Saarinen table in the dining room of one of his two adjoining houses in the Hollywood Hills. Sitting with him were Shawn Levy, who directed the “Night at the Museum” films, and Mark Friedman, who had written the latest draft of “Night at the Museum 3.”\n\nDoing a third “Museum” would not seem to offer Stiller many creative challenges. Even the first and best film was predicated on a compromise; Levy said, “I told Ben, ‘I promise you this movie will have the pedigreed casting you want—Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan, Ricky Gervais—and you promise me it’s going to have the unironically warmhearted sweet center I know it needs.’”\n\nYet sequels to hits are usually hits themselves, and that was a vital consideration, given Stiller’s age. As one studio head points out, “Larry the museum guard, if he’s in his fifties, is just a lonely old weird guy.” Sequels also do particularly well overseas, and overseas matters more than ever; international box-office has grown thirty-eight per cent in the past five years. Rob Moore, of Paramount Pictures, says, “The reason Ben is still on top is that he’s done better and better abroad.” Stiller’s big movies have made ninety per cent as much overseas as they have at home, for a combined average of two hundred and sixteen million dollars. The animated “Madagascar” series alone has been translated into thirty-seven languages—which requires a commensurate number of promotional appearances. As Stiller travels the world on Jeffrey Katzenberg’s Boeing business jet, he has discovered that his actual performance is beside the point. In many of the countries they visit, not only can you not see Stiller onscreen; you can’t even hear his voice, which has been dubbed. It’s a form of homeopathic medicine, where the vital ingredient has been diluted to a point of functional insignificance—while still remaining somehow potent. “It’s weird to be promoting a movie you’re not really in,” Stiller said. “They introduce us, and then they introduce our counterparts—the Italian guy who’s Ben Stiller.”\n\nIn the meeting for “Night at the Museum 3,” Stiller nibbled a slice of cucumber and raised a general concern: the third-act battle in an underground lair “seems like such a huge set piece. Aren’t we trying to get back to the simplicity and mystery of the first movie?” The watch spring of this film, intended as the franchise’s final installment, would be a villain who obtains the magic tablet that brings the museum’s inhabitants to life—even as the tablet is beginning to decay. But the film was really meant to celebrate its lovable gang of misfits.\n\n“Guess what?” Levy said. “When I think of ‘Night 2: Battle of the Smithsonian’—it ain’t much of a battle. All the costumes and armies, it’s a mess.”\n\nStiller said, “I think we need to do more with the constellations. I like making Orion a character.”\n\nLevy perked up: “So, if Orion was here, could I put my hand through him?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Oh, that’s cool.”\n\n“And he’d have Liam Neeson’s voice,” Friedman suggested. “Yeah, he would!” Stiller agreed.\n\nLevy said, “So he speaks, just like Rexy”—the dinosaur—“roars even though he’s just a skeleton, which no one ever notices.”\n\n“Rexy roars?” Stiller said.\n\n“Yes!” Levy said. “When you’re crouched behind the reception desk in ‘Night 1’? You have to remember that—I got this text from Akiva on ‘The Watch’: ‘Ben won’t crouch behind the bar. He says he did it on “Night at the Museum.” ’ That’s when I realized you’ve been in so many movies, it’s hard to avoid replications. But you’re good at policing them, I’ll give you that.”\n\nStiller adopted a heroic archer’s pose—a pose that Levy had glorified in both the second “Night at the Museum” and his subsequent battling-robots film, “Real Steel.”\n\nLevy opened his mouth, then gracefully admitted, “I have no riposte.”\n\nSmiling, Stiller went on, “So there could be a cool scene in Central Park where Orion is telling Larry where he’s from—”\n\nLevy started to rise in excitement. “That’s an anthemic scene—the gang on Sheep’s Meadow at night, laying back and looking up at the stars—”\n\nStiller cut in, doing Neeson’s furry brogue: “ ‘And Sagittarius is a total dick, and Cassiopeia sleeps with everyone . . .’ ”\n\n“I smell a breakout character!” Levy cried, punching the air.\n\nWhen the group arrived at the film’s climax, having just agreed that Larry should nobly allow his son, Nicky, to go away to college, they debated how to soften the further blow that if the tablet peters out it’s curtains for the museum gang. Feeling his way, Friedman asked, “So Larry is left without his museum friends, and without his son?” Stiller deadpanned, “He commits suicide . . . and the trilogy comes to an end.”\n\nAfter further discussion, Stiller suggested, “What if Larry says goodbye to Teddy”—Teddy Roosevelt, his father figure—“and leaves the museum before dawn, because he wants to remember Teddy alive. He goes out and Nicky shows up, as a surprise, and says, ‘I’m going to Stanford’—or not—and then they look at the fading stars and see Orion, and we call that back with a line, and then they walk through New York as the sun comes up.”\n\n“I love it!” Levy said. “I don’t have that line for the goodbye yet, but it’ll be Teddy: ‘Lawrence, it’s not dawn yet. Why are you leaving?’ Larry: ‘Something something that’s going to be incredibly moving.’ ”\n\n“It’s about death,” Stiller said. “And that always works.” He grinned. “And then, in the credit sequence, I go to the Met, and see a magical sceptre. Cut to black.” He adopted a Looney Tunes voice: “See ya next time!”\n\nOne afternoon in Hollywood, Stiller visited Red Hour, his production company, which is situated in a concrete aerie that used to be a hair salon. His nine employees circled him like charged electrons. First, Debbie Liebling discussed the thirteen TV pilots she was developing for a deal that Red Hour had with ABC, a number of which seemed to leave Stiller unmoved. Of one about “two dudes teaching immigrants at an English-language school,” Stiller said that it “sounds sitcom-y.” “These are sitcoms,” Liebling replied. Then he trudged into a meeting about forty-one films the company was considering. Red Hour extends Stiller’s influence in manifold ways, yet he sometimes wonders whether it’s worth the time it requires.\n\nStiller brightened when Steve Conrad arrived. He has an endless appetite for story work, fitting it into his schedule as someone else might fit in a set of pushups—and, better, the “Mitty” crew had pruned three million dollars from the budget, by cutting scenes and effects and paring Ted and Walter’s battle over Stretch Armstrong to 1:45. Stiller was looking for ways to find the last million, and, as always, to improve the script. He paged through it opposite the unshaven writer, who had a which-room-service-meal-did-I-just-eat air. Stiller said that Emma Watts, Fox’s president of production, “wants a cleaner way into Ted-Walter—you got any ideas there?”\n\n“We can do anything you like,” Conrad said. “But I do think we have to protect Walter’s fight for his dignity.”\n\nStiller nodded—then went the other way. “What if Walter takes Stretch and wraps it around Ted’s neck?” he said, aggressively demonstrating the move as Conrad laughed and began typing on his MacBook.\n\nWatts had again suggested cutting Benjamin Buttons to help with the budget. Instead, Stiller had whittled six hundred and sixty-eight thousand dollars by tightening the sequence. But he sympathized with Watts’s wish to show clearly, after the fantasy ends, that Walter’s daydreams are an obstacle for Cheryl. He told Conrad, “Maybe Cheryl says something in the world of ‘Where do you go?,’ where we see that it’s holding her back.” Conrad made a note, his face still, and Stiller softly added, “It’s a tough balance, but we need to get the point across.”\n\nStiller told me, “Two months ago, I wouldn’t have imagined making cuts like this. We even lost the exploding head. It tells you what the movie could be, audiences would have loved it—but it’s just not necessary. I hope.” If he was right, the exploding head was the movie’s bay leaf, a catalyzing ingredient best removed before serving. “A lot of the changes have actually made the movie better,” he admitted. “I learned on ‘Tropic Thunder’ that I really wanted there to be three helicopters in the opening scene—it was necessary there—but that at a certain point in a film a laugh is more important than an expensive explosion. And that’s why I could give up the exploding head. No laughs.”\n\nThe next day, Fox approved Stiller’s suggested budget cuts, which had brought him within thirty thousand dollars of the target number. The studio didn’t send over a bottle of champagne, or even give him an official green light, but it became apparent that the movie would be made. Stiller permitted himself to be elated for about forty-eight hours—and it was astonishing how loose and boyish he became, and how much his high spirits infected the crew. It was a new Ben Stiller, one relieved, if only briefly, of his Atlas burden of anxiety.\n\nIn early March, the cast of “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” gathered in Stage K at Kaufman Astoria—known under the Stiller regime as the Ping-Pong Room—to read the script aloud. The read-through was a chance to define the film’s tone, and to hear what wasn’t working, before everyone dispersed to their piecework over the next six months. (Action films often omit read-throughs, as the third act is mostly grunts and fireballs.) Seventeen actors sat around a large rectangular table, surrounded, in a wider rectangle of chairs, by the film’s producers and department heads, a few guests, and Emma Watts. Stiller spoke briefly, saying, “Feel free to have fun with it,” and off they went.\n\nThe first ten minutes were a cautious search for the right pitch. Then the Ted-Walter antagonism landed—even Stiller doubled up at Adam Scott’s snotty hostility as Ted—and so did the Alpine Walter fantasy. There were extended stretches without laughs, however, and though this was to be expected in a film that aspired to a mixture of tones, a few glances darted Watts’s way. Then, gradually, the comedy began to emerge from character. The Benjamin Buttons sequence, in which Stiller sounded like a doddering leprechaun, had people eying him in delighted recalibration: this could actually, maybe, be really good.\n\nAt the close, everyone applauded for fifteen seconds. “That was great! So great!” Kristen Wiig told Stiller, and he rubbed her back. Watts told me that she loved the “emotional wallop” of the reading, and said her doubts about Buttons had been assuaged: “When you make a movie with Ben Stiller, you have to trust his sense of what’s funny.” Only Steve Conrad felt a pang about the film’s evolution, murmuring, “Near the end, I keep expecting we’re going to go to the G8”—the sequence Stiller had cut nearly a year earlier.\n\nAfter lunch, Stiller convened the leading actors for a postmortem. Shirley MacLaine spoke: “I think this is more profound than you all realize. It’s really about love and how to find yourself and how imagination doesn’t even matter anymore in the Internet world. To me, Walter is not the crazy one—it’s a tragedy about what we’ve become.”\n\nAfter a respectful silence, the comedian Patton Oswalt, who plays Todd, Walter’s self-appointed romance adviser, said, “You just gave me a really cool idea. Wouldn’t there be a twenty-first-century fantasy where you’re rock-star famous online, and your Facebook and Twitter page views and followers keep rising—”\n\n“ ‘That’s the guy with the great eHarmony picture!’ ” Wiig suggested.\n\nStiller had Conrad write a social-media scene: a fantasy in which Jay-Z tweeted in praise of Walter, and LeBron James (along with Pitbull and 2,344,889 other people) “liked” a Facebook photograph of Walter about to punch a paparazzo. The director acknowledged that the scene undercut his intention that the movie feel timeless but said, “I wouldn’t want that to come at the expense of relevance, or of appealing to young people.”\n\nFox was no longer asking that the film be funnier, but Stiller kept laboring to improve the jokes—funny is money, as the Hollywood saying has it. He added a soccer fantasy for the film’s international release, and a Rihanna-inspired fantasy in which Cheryl would strip off her business outfit and break into song. Assessing these changes, Stiller said, “This last rewrite addresses a note Tom Rothman had earlier—we did make the movie funnier and more accessible, but we got there the way we got there, and we kept Steve Conrad’s voice.” Now he just had to do the work of filming and editing the movie—a nine-month process in which everything could fall apart every day.\n\nRothman, for his part, said that he was particularly fond of one of the bittersweet moments that remained in the script: the one where Walter, overwhelmed finally to be travelling for real, begins to cry in a Papa John’s pizzeria in Iceland. “It’s going to be heartbreaking and wry and transcendent—he’s crying not in a church or a graveyard but in a Papa John’s! And that’s what makes it Ben. The audience will laugh and cry and be smiling through their tears.”\n\nEighteen months ago, Stiller and Christine Taylor moved to the New York area to give their children, Ella and Quinlin, an East Coast upbringing. They bought a house in Westchester County, just outside the city, and an apartment on the West Side—in the building where Stiller grew up, eight floors above his childhood home. The relocation was the landing point of a larger move the couple had begun to make. Stiller said, “It took me some time to understand that just because you have kids doesn’t mean you’re going to have a relationship with them.” After his son Quinlin was born, in 2005, Stiller said, “I took a good chunk of time off, and Christine and I made a conscious effort to make our relationship work. It felt good. I surprised myself that I could actually enjoy time off. On a vacation. With my family . . .” He thought for a moment, then mentioned a health issue one of his children had had. “You know, real life is . . . daunting.”\n\nLike a hermit crab, Stiller has shed his shell of yesteryear. “I felt really stupid when I learned that three billion of the seven billion people in the world are living on under two dollars a day,” he said. “I felt embarrassed that I didn’t know that. And so, when I started building schools in Haiti, I was trying not to be the person I used to make fun of—the actor who does good works—but at the same time I was trying to let go of how people would perceive me, and not give a shit.”\n\nNonetheless, the project of changing how people perceive him continues. Stiller has been increasingly drawn to Scott Rudin, who produced “Zoolander” and “Greenberg”; Rudin recently persuaded him to direct the pilot of a forthcoming HBO series, “All Talk,” and to play the main character, a rabbi who struggles with faith and faithfulness. Rudin believes that Stiller’s true achievements lie ahead: “Ben is a great vessel for the things I want to do with him, for the Jewish guy in the culture—the questioning, tortured, ardent, fucked-up guy.” Nick Stevens adds, “Global movie stardom is not forever for anyone, so I hope Ben doesn’t only find satisfaction in staying on top and selling tickets and having infinite choices. I think what will sustain Ben’s passion now is having opportunities to show his true abilities as a director and an actor.”\n\nChristine Taylor said, “I have a completely different view of Ben’s body of work than he does. I say, ‘Look at all you’ve done, it’s the ultimate career!’ He recognizes that, but he thinks, Do my peers respect me? I don’t get nominated for awards. . . . And it would feel good to get the call from this director, or that one.” Friends say that Stiller regrets not being asked to star in films such as Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Punch-Drunk Love” or Alexander Payne’s “The Descendants.” When her husband gets downhearted, Taylor says, “I tell him to remember when Tom Cruise sent two hundred cupcakes when ‘Night at the Museum’ became a hit.”\n\nWhen I mentioned his wife’s perspective to Stiller, he hesitated, uncertain how candid to appear. He would like to be omnipresent yet invisible, like God. At last, he said, “I’m picky and specific as a director, so I get why other directors are, too. But it would be great to have every director calling all the time!”"
