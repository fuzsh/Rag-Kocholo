Featuring a remarkable performance from Jamie Foxx in the central role. Ray follows the inspiring story of a one-of-a-kind genius.\n\nBorn in a poor town in Georgia, Ray Charles went blind at the age of seven, shortly after witnessing his younger brother's accidental death. Inspired by a fiercely independent mother who insisted he make his own way in the world, Charles found his calling and his gift, behind a piano keyboard. Touring across the Southern musical circuit, the soulful singer gained a reputation and then exploded with worldwide fame when he pioneered incorporating gospel, country, jazz and orchestral influences into his inimitable style.\n\nAs he revolutionized the way people appreciated music, he simultaneously fought segregation in the very clubs that launched him and championed artists' rights within the corporate music business. Ray provides an unflinching portrait of Charles' musical genius as he overcomes drug addiction while transforming into one of this country's most beloved performers.\n\nBack to contents.\n\nRay - The Ray Charles Story (15)\n\nAudio described cinema shows:\n\nNo more shows are planned.\n\nBack to contents.\n\nProduction notes .\n\nIf a life is merely the sum of its parts, the the story of Ray Charles might read as a tale of personal highs and lows behind a lengthy, award-winning career in the music business.\n\nBut for a man who synthesized his struggles, pain and personal darkness as effectively as he incorporated a myriad of musical styles - Jazz, Rhythm & Blues, Rock & Roll, Gospel, Country & Western - into his art, the story reads much differently, transformed from a sequence of events and accomplishments into a compelling and ultimately inspiring journey of a one-of-a-kind genius with a distinct vision who along the way, gave the world a new way to hear.\n\nRay is the never-before-told musical biographical drama of american legend Ray Charles, brought to the big screen following a 15-year journey by award-winning filmmaker TAYLOR HACKFORD and featuring a remarkable performance from the multifaceted JAMIE FOXX.\n\nLink to full production notes.\n\nBack to contents.\n\nThe cast.\n\nJamie Foxx stars as Ray Charles.\n\nKerry Washington plays Della Bea Robinson\n\nClifton Powell plays Jeff Brown\n\nHarry Lennix plays Joe Adams\n\nTerrence Dashon Howard plays Gossie McKee\n\nLarenz Tate plays Quincy Jones\n\nRichard Schiff plays Jerry Wexler\n\nAunjanue Ellis plays May Ann Fisher\n\nBokeem Woodbine plays Fathead Newman\n\nSharon Warren plays Aretha Robinson\n\nCurtis Armstrong plays Ahmet Ertegun\n\nRegina King plays Margie Hendricks\n\nLink to full cast biographies.\n\nBack to cast members.\n\nBack to contents.\n\nJamie Foxx stars as Ray Charles.\n\nJamie Foxx (Ray Charles) is enjoying success in a multifaceted career that already encompasses dramatic roles in films and television, as well as stand-up comedy and music. Though previously best known for his comedy work, his emergence as a leading dramatic actor is evidenced in his most recent an upcoming roles. He most recently starred opposite Tom Cruise in Michael Mann's thriller Collateral; Foxx portrays Max, a taxi driver who becomes \"collateral\" - an expandable person - when he and his cab are hijacked for a night by a contract killer (Cruise) in town to carry out five hits before dawn. In addition to his title role in Ray, Foxx is set to star in the action thriller Stealth for director Rob Cohen, which is slated for release in 2005.\n\nFoxx recently received critical acclaim for his portrayal of gang member-turned-Nobel Peace Prize nominee Stan Tookie Williams in the cable movie Redemption. He also starred opposite Gabrielle Union in the urban romantic comedy film Breakin' All the Rules.\n\nFoxx first came to fames as a popular stand-up comedian and comedy actor. During the early 1990s, he was a regular on the comedy series In Living Color, alongside Keenan Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans and Jim Carrey. He also had a recurring role on the series Roc, and guest-starred on several other shows.\n\nIn 1996, he launched his own series, The Jamie Foxx Show, which became one of the top-rated shows on the WB network. Foxx not only co-created and starred on the show, but also served as an executive producer and directed several episodes. During the show's five-year run, Foxx won an NAACP Image Award and earned three more nominations for Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nOn the big screen, Foxx received praise from both critics and audiences for his performance as a breakout star quarterback in Oliver Stone's 1999 football-themed drama Any Given Sunday, in which he joined an ensemble cast that also included Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz and LL Cool J. In addition to his on-screen role in the movie, Foxx wrote, produced and performed two songs featured on the film's soundtrack, including the title track and the chant \"My Name Is Willie\".\n\nHe went on to co-star with Will Smith in the 2001 epic Ali, which marked Foxx's first collaboration with director Michael Mann. His portrayal of Muhammad Ali's corner man and constant inspiration, Drew Bundini Brown, brought Foxx another Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. His additional film credits include Bait, The Truth About Cats and Dogs and The Great White Hype.\n\nIn 2002, Foxx brought down the house in his first HBO comedy special, Jamie Foxx: I Might Need Some Security. He also has the distinction of hosting the top-rated Saturday Night Live of the 2001-02 season.\n\nBack to cast members.\n\nBack to contents.\n\nDirector, producer and screenplay credits.\n\nRay is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Taylor Hackford (An Officer and a Gentleman); screenplay by James L White, from a story by Hackford and White; and produced by Hackford, Stuart Benjamin, Howard Baldwin and Karen Baldwin.\n\nLink to full biographies.\n\nBack to contents.\n\nTwenty testimonials to Ray Charles by his peers.\n\n\"...The only genius in our business.\"Frank Sinatra.\n\n\"In a time where racism was at a premium high, he brought together country music rhythm and blues.\"Stevie Wonder.\n\n\"Ray was always positive about what he was doing, and I admire him most for that. I tell you one thing: He could see a lot better than those eyes\"James Brown.\n\n\"I have grown up with Ray Charles' music and I have always thought of him as the quintessential Soul Man - the flip side of Nat King Cole, if you will. Ray is a musical genius on piano and in voice. The consistency and substance of his work and his career is something for any musical artist to aspire to. His arrangements are always rich, soulful but elegant, and he knows how to have fun. Anyone who can turn the National Anthem into the anthem of all times is an artist to be reckoned with. I am proud to have worked with him on this endeavour.\"Natalie Cole.\n\n\"the voice of a lifetime.\"Aretha Franklin.\n\n\"When people mention Ray Charles, I just smile. That grin, that voice, his music is so joyous. He had an enormous effect on my career. Anything he put out, I bought. He has one of the greatest voices of all time.\"Elton John.\n\n\"When he started singing, that was it. Everyone else was playing for second.\"Bruce Hornsby.\n\n\"Ray Charles was a true American original who many artists tried to emulate - among them, myself, Rod Stewart, Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood and countless others. Ray Charles defined rhythm and blues, soul and authentic rock and roll. I am eternally grateful to him...Billy Joel.\n\n\"I just love everything about Ray Charles. He could sing any song, and it sounds like Ray Charles and it sounds amazing. There's nothing I could say to do him justice. I love him so much. He is as big an influence on me as you can get.\"Norah Jones.\n\n\"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did.\"Quincy Jones.\n\n\"Brother Ray is so good. It was great to have the opportunity to work with long-time friends like him and Billy Preston. We were a sight; three old timers burning through this historic blues track. I cannot express how much it meant to me to sing alongside Ray on on e of his hits from his early career.\"BB King.\n\n\"When recording or performing with Ray I always knew I was in presence of greatness. A true legend in his time and mine...\"Gladys Knight.\n\n\"I was so nervous to be in the same studio as Ray Charles. He is not just an ordinary singer, musician or icon. He's the best of the best. It was a highlight of my life.\"Johnny Mathis.\n\n\"To be singing with Ray Charles, two feet away from him live with an orchestra was pretty unbelievable. \"Hey Girl\" is the ingredient that makes the moment even more special to me because I know how much Ray loves that song.\"Michael McDonald.\n\n\"His sound was stunning - it was blues, it was R&B, it was gospel, it was swing - it was all the stuff I was listening to before that but rolled into one amazing, soulful thing.\"Van Morrison.\n\n\"A lot of folks want to pay tribute to Ray Charles, and I'm glad a lot of us are getting the opportunity to do that. Ray and I are very good friends and there's no one any better, as far as I'm concerned, at what we do. Recording with Ray was an extraordinary experience. Who would have thought that guys like us would still be out there recording and doing stuff. That's what makes it special.\"Willie Nelson.\n\n\"There was music before Ray Charles, and there's music after Ray Charles. It's that stark a difference... I got to record with him for his duets project... He was very kind and generous and appreciative - very present. And when I heard that voice and that piano coming out of the headphones, well, that was the pinnacle of my career...\"Bonnie Raitt.\n\n\"It's a special privilege to say you've recorded with Ray Charles. Being immersed in and around his musicality is always a learning experience. He set the pace for all of us.\"Phil Ramone.\n\n\"It was all music to Ray. He was the first true crossover artist... But Ray was Rock & Roll. He was Rhythm & Blue. He was Jazz. He was country. He had such reach - and far-reaching effect.\"Keith Richards\n\n\"Ray Charles has made the greatest individual contribution to American music in my lifetime... He was a genius. He was the one.\"James Taylor.\n\nBack to contents.\n\nLinks to more Ray Charles websites:\n\nLink to official U.K. website.\n\nLink to official U.S. website.\n\nLink to U.S. website.\n\nLink to Ray Charles fan club website.\n\nThe latest news on Ray Charles.\n\nBack to contents.\n\nContent copyright Universal Studios 2004.
