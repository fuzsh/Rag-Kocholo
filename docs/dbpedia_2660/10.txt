A musical celebrating Ray Charles is headed for Broadway later this year.

Unchain My Heart will open on November 7 with preview performances beginning on October 8.

Producer Stuart Benjamin said on Thursday the show would feature a book by Suzan-Lori Parks and direction by Sheldon Epps. Casting will be announced.

Benjamin worked with the late singer for 15 years and produced Ray, the hit movie about his life starring Jamie Foxx. Parks won a Pulitzer Prize for her play "Topdog/Underdog."

An earlier version of the musical called "Ray Charles Live" was produced at California's Pasadena Playhouse in 2007.
