NEW YORK â€” A musical celebrating Ray Charles is headed for Broadway this fall.

"Unchain My Heart" will open Nov. 7 with preview performances beginning Oct. 8.

Producer Stuart Benjamin said Thursday the show would feature a book by Suzan-Lori Parks and direction by Sheldon Epps.

Benjamin produced "Ray," the hit movie starring Jamie Foxx. Parks won a Pulitzer Prize for her play "Topdog/Underdog."

An earlier version of the musical called "Ray Charles Live" was produced at California's Pasadena Playhouse in 2007.
