        "text": "Kindgom of Ghazals loses its King\n\nAfter Jagjit Singh another golden voice has departed from the world of Ghazal with Mehdi Hassan's demise.\n\nMehdi Hassan (July 18, 1927 - June 13, 2012)\n\nBorn into a family of traditional musicians, Mehdi Hassan was the 16th generation of hereditary musicians hailing from the Kalawant clan of musicians.

Produced by EMI/Virgin records, the album is a tribute noted Bhojpuri litterateur Bhikhari Thakur. It was launched in Mauritius on the 4th of June 2012, by the country's Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Public Infrastructure Mr. Anil Kumar Bachoo and Mr. Mookhesswur Choonee, Minister of Arts and Culture.\n\nThe richness of Bhojpuri mores have perhaps been shadowed by the massive popularity of double meaning hip shakers, thanks to the competitive rating points driven entertainment industry. It therefore comes as a surprise when one of the most popular Bhojpuri vocalists decides to stream aside from the rat race and explore the lost works of Bhikhari Thakur, fondly known as Shakespeare of Bhojpuri literature for his contribution to poetry and drama.\n\nAssam born singer Kaplana Patowary has carved a mighty niche for herself in the entertainment industry having lent her vocals to a numerous Bhojpuri songs as well as Bollywood numbers including films like Billo Barber and De Dhana Dhan. Although she has a myriad of folk and popular songs to her credit, Bhojpuri music has been her most dedicated foray.\n\nBorn in 1887, Bhikhari Thakur’s creative sojourn began late in his life for he was an illiterate until quite a few decades of his life. He learnt the three Rs from a shopkeeper when he went to Calcutta following a family tradition of working in the city. The stark social and cultural variations of his village and Calcutta, as well as works of Raja Ram Mohan Roy inspired him to express his experiences through literature. On returning to his village Bhikhari Thakur formed Bhikhari Thakur Natak Mandali thus creating a theatre form called Bidesia. Unlike conventional poets and dramatists, Thakur’s work took a dig at the redundant ways and customs of the society of his. One of his most noted works includes the tale of a woman in a village whose husband leaves the village to work in a but she still has physical desires, so she gets involved with another man and has a child.\n\nInspired by the contemporary nature of Thakur’s writings, Kalpana felt a need to share his work with a present day global audience. It turned out to be a mammoth task as the material available on Bhikhari Thakur is negligible. Luckily her rendezvous with a 98 year old dancer from the Bhikhari Thakur Natak Mandali gave her a first person account of the experiences of Tahkur’s legend as well as well walked her through his works.\n\nTitled The Legacy of Bhikhari Thakur, Kalpana’s tribute to the Shakespeare of Bhojpuri literature has nine melodious tracks, the lyrics of which were penned down by Thakur himself. His memorable poems on immigration and unemployment rendered by Kapalana's powerhouse vocals have been welcomed with warmth in many parts of the globe. It has been launched in France and Mauritius and a launch in is scheduled in the foreseeable future. It's comes as no surprise that EMI/Virgin Records has undertaken the risk of pricing this Bhojpuri album at Rs. 195. The Legacy of Bhikari Thakur takes Bhojpuri music from the masses to the classes.\n\n- by Parmita Borah\n\n↧\n\nFirst Superstar of India Rajesh Khanna's demise\n\nRajesh Khanna (1942-2012)\n\nYesteryear Bollywood superstar Rajesh Khanna passed away on Wednesday afternoon (July 18, 2012) after a prolonged illness.

The feeling is ecstatic, he says.\n\nWallang, guitarist with the Shillong-based blues rock band Soulmate, will open the show for Santana along with his bandmates on Oct 28.\n\n\"It was a dream....and it has come true for me and Tips (Tipriti Kharbangar, the lead vocalist) as well,\" Soulmate lead guitarist Rudy Wallang told IANS.\n\n\"I first heard 'Black Magic Woman' when I was about 10 years old and the first notes of that song are still stuck in my soul,\" the Shillong-born musician said and added that he doesn't know whether Santana will jam with him on stage.\n\nWallang is one of the foremost singer-songwriter-blues guitar player in the country with a long musical history. He has been part of well-known blues rock acts - Great Society & Mojo.\n\n\"It is an honour for us to open the act for global music icon Carlos Santana. Our music derives inspiration from his legendary compositions. It is like a dream come true for us. We are looking forward to this special moment,\" said Wallang with a smile.\n\n\"I have also composed a song called 'Moon Magic' back in 1983-84, which was my tribute to Santana and we will be playing it at the concert,\" Wallang revealed.\n\nSantana, 65, has sold more than 100 million records and has won 10 Grammy Awards.\n\nTipriti, fondly called Tips, said: \"I am lost for words now. I have seen him only on television. I am looking forward to playing and talking with Carlos Santana. I am sure it will be a magical moment for me and our band.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old has earned a name as one of the finest female singers to have emerged out of Shillong and India as a whole.\n\nTips, however, admitted that she started feeling for Santana's music when she heard his version of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\".\n\n\"These tunes are capturing the imagination of our generation. His music is full of thoughts, meaning and feelings,\" she said.\n\n\"We are all geared up to create history in music by performing as the opening act for Santana,\" she added.\n\nThe musicians backing Soulmate are Leon Wallang(Bass), Shaun Nonghulo (Drums)and Raveen Pandey (Hammond Organ).\n\nThe band has given as many as 500 performances in the country and abroad, including in countries like the US, France, Germany, Sweden, Singapore, Indonesia Bhutan and Nepal.\n\nSoulmate has recorded two albums thus far - \"Shillong\" and \"Moving On\" - and is in the process of putting down songs for the next one.\n\n\"Carlos Santana's music spans over four decades.

And, despite being a lighthearted conversationalist, and what I’d like to describe as a ‘fun guy’, 2Blue is a true blue musician with viable love and dedication towards music. Along with his Mumbai based band Zedde (one of India’s leading Rock bands), 2Blue is committed to making original music that rocks the worlds of many.\n\n2Blue talks about his band, Zedde, his upcoming album with the band, his connection with North East India, and holy cow – his wacky name …\n\n2Blue - lead singer, Zedde\n\nQ.Zedde – fan base from all around the globe, more than 5000 likes on Facebook and counting and many prestigious awards. How does it feel?\n\n2Blue: It sure feels good to have a growing fan base and the awards. But an artist needs to live in the present and not bask too much in past glory. While Facebook likes and fancy awards may put his name out there, they should not be used as a certification of his talent... because there will always be many out there with far more talent and far less luck. The funny thing is: the vice versa is equally true. Switch on a radio or a television set and you will see what I saying (winks).\n\nQ.What is the connection between Zedde and North-East India?\n\n2Blue: I was born and raised in Agartala, Tripura. Two of my friends from Guwahati, Assam — Akashdeep Gogoi and Deepu Saikia — handle bass playing duties for the band depending on their availability. So that’s one half of the band with its roots in the North-East.\n\nQ.2Blue! Very unusual name. What is the story behind? We would also like to know your alternate name, if any.\n\n2Blue: Here are a few other ‘unusual’ names: Skrillex, Bono, The Edge, Sting, Eminem, 2Pac, Slash and Babul Supriyo. Just wait till I get famous enough for ‘2Blue’ to sound really cool (laughs out loud). Okay, on a serious note, Tublu is a very common pet name amongst the Bengali community that I come from. I just like its alphanumeric incarnation better. Had this article been for a business magazine, you would have been addressing me as... wait for it... Tirthankar Poddar. You can now laugh all you want (smiles).\n\nQ.Vayu to Zedde. How did it happen?\n\n2Blue: All things come with an expiry date, no matter how good (or bad) they are. So soon after the Vayu album ‘Wings Of A Dream’ was released, Zedde was founded. One phone call was all it took. Guitar player Claver Menezes, who was at the other end of the line, readily agreed to come onboard. That’s how the nucleus of the band was formed.\n\nQ.Tell us something about Zedde’s members and the gears they use.\n\nClaver Menezes - guitarist, Zedde\n\n2Blue: Zedde (pronounced zēd) is essentially a 4-piece rock band featuring Claver Menezes on guitars, Akashdeep Gogoi (and sometimes Deepu Saikia) on bass as mentioned earlier, and Trevor Berchman on drums. While each member of the band keeps upgrading their gear, the last time I checked, Claver used Ibanez guitars with Tech 21 Liverpool Distortion, Tech 21 DLA, Jim Dunlop Cry Baby Wah, and a Boss GT8 processor. Of course I can’t resist the urge to mention the Makita drill machine he uses on our recent single ‘Blame It On Her Youth (The Electric Drill Song)’ which is now available for free download on our website www.ZeddeLIVE.in (smiles sheepishly). Akash has way too many bass guitars to mention: right from a 6-string Ibanez SR3006 and a 5-string Fender Jazz, to a headless Steinberger and a Asbory rubber bass. His choice of pedals includes (but is not restricted to): Boss Super Octave, Boss Bass Equalizer, Hartke Bass Attack, and EBS Micro Bass II. Trevor is a fan of all things Zildjian. When recording in the studio, he likes his Yamaha and/or Roland virtual drums. When touring with the band, he settles for whatever the event organizer has the budget for (laughs out loud). When it comes to my personal favourite, I like to use a Shure SM58 cordless along with a Boss Digital Delay pedal. And of course, I like my megaphone (smiles again).\n\nQ.What/who inspired you to create your milestone project ‘Mumbai’? How did you promote it?\n\nIf you pay attention to the lyrics, you’ll see it’s about taking the “one-way train” to the city with “just a bag of dreams”, “knocking the doors”, “chasing the sun”, “until she hears your silent screams”. Then “she puts her wings around you”, “takes away your crown of thorns”, “nurses your wounds”, “washes you clean”, and “saves you from the howling storm”. So in more ways than one, it is the story of my life... of the small town boy who moved to the city for a better tomorrow. How did we promote it? Well, the initial plan was to debut the song at the erstwhile south-Mumbai night club (Not Just) Jazz By The Bay on Saturday, November 29, 2008. Then all hell broke loose on Wednesday, November 26. The city bled for days. Innocent lives were lost. It was no time to celebrate music. So we cancelled the show. Then on November 26 the following year, the music video for ‘Mumbai’ debuted on VH1. It may not be the fanciest thing you’ve watched on TV but it managed to climb to #1 position on the YouTube India charts within 24 hours of upload. It sure has emotions that run deep.\n\nQ.The new Zedde CD is currently being recorded. What would be the name? Any collaboration with any other musician or band?\n\n2Blue: We have 10 original songs that have been tried and tested at several venues across the country. As soon as we have a couple of more songs that all members of the band are happy with, we will start knocking a few doors again (smiles). We haven’t settled on a name yet, and since this is going to be our first full length album, I think it is best we exploit the band’s intrinsic talent pool to create it so we can grow organically.\n\nQ.Are you satisfied with the present music scenario of India? Do you want the industry people and the Government of India to change anything?\n\nClaver & 2Blue, Zedde\n\n2Blue: The music scenario in India is definitely a lot more promising now than it used to be say about 10 years back. The focus has shifted to originality and in spite of the steep uphill climb, a lot of self-respecting musicians have embraced the Do-It-Yourself model. Musicians today are not afraid to be their own publicists, producers, distributors, and managers amongst other things. The success stories are quite a few. But the thing about success is that when some milestones are met, a whole new world of ambitious milestones gets created. So some more support and appreciation from mainstream media would help motivate, spur, and channelize creative efforts. Another thing I would like to mention is the lack of adequate attention for the ‘artistic middleclass’. Music companies, promoters, journalist et al are all busy promoting either fresh talent or iconic acts, with brazen lack of concern for those that don’t fit into these extremes. Let the aforementioned people be reminded that it is the artistic middleclass that connects with its audience at a very personal level. It is the artistic middleclass that builds long lasting relationships with their fans and supporters via social media and intimate club concerts. Fresh talent does not have that luxury while iconic acts have way too much going on to maintain that personal touch. So the artistic middle class is what brands and music business people need to take more interest in to push the right kind of marketing communication out to their target audience. As far as the role of the government goes, cultural exchanges beyond the realm of domestic pastures should be encouraged more vehemently. Entertainment taxes should be made more reasonable too.\n\nQ.If a new band or a singer wants to follow the footsteps of Zedde and 2Blue, what will be your advice?\n\n2Blue: I am not sure if I would make an ideal role model but I sure have had my share of good and bad times to know that it’s a brutal world out there. But if you are armed with talent, passion, ambition, and faith, nothing can stop you. So follow your heart. You stand to lose way too much if you don’t.\n\nFollow Zedde on Facebook, Reverbnation and Youtube\n\n- Jim Ankan Deka\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDr. Bhupen Hazarika and his attachment with Meghalaya\n\nDr. Bhupen Hazarika is not only a revered figure in Assam, but also equally revered in Meghalaya. The people who came in touch with him in one way or another still keep such glorious, delightful and nostalgic memories alive in their hearts.\n\nDr. Bhupen Hazarika (1926-2011)\n\nThe main purpose of this short article is to highlight his love towards and attachment with the people of Meghalaya. Also it is a small step towards educating the new generation about Bhupen Hazarika’s contribution in showcasing the culture and tradition of the people of Meghalaya, particularly the Khasis with the outside world during 50’s, 60’s and 70’s.\n\nDr. Hazarika was not merely a singer, but was a humanist. Most of his unforgettable songs carry the message of love and unity. His songs reflect the colourful culture of the tribes of the then great undivided Assam. In one of the songs he talks about the age-old relationship between Assamese and Khasis. Comparing both, he beautifully describes about the commonness in many avenues of rural lifestyles. I couldn’t help but to share this beautiful creation for greater perception which has been transliterated keeping the meaning and aesthetic sense as nearest as possible -\n\nWith drum beats\n\nWith the warmth of hearts\n\nWith the unseen thread of attachment\n\nLet’s embrace the Great Syiem of the hills.\n\nAt wet Cherrapunjee\n\nIn the wetness of the sky\n\nThe way the generous cloud\n\nEmbraces our great ‘Luit’\n\nKrishna cowboys play the ‘Bahi’\n\nKhasi cowboys play the ‘Sharati’\n\nBoth the flutes made up of bamboo\n\nBoth express the same melody\n\nTall pine trees with green leaves\n\nOur ‘Ahat’, too, reflects the same hue\n\n‘Bnei’ or ‘Jone’ in the hills and plains\n\nBlesses us with same moonlit night\n\nBy cultivating the red hills\n\nKhasi farmers work day and night\n\nIn the plains, too, thousands of Rangmon\n\nRepresent the same farmers.\n\nOne of his most romantic numbers entitled ‘Shilongore godhuli’ (The Evening of Shillong) carries deep rooted meaning bringing alive the beauty of a young Khasi maiden and the beauty of the nature in the hills. He shared his affection towards the dew drops gracefully falling down from a ‘diengsie’ leaf. He was awe inspired when darkness slowly engulfed a tiny village in Meghalaya.\n\nHis another number ‘Shilongore Monalisa’ (Monalisa of Shillong), which he beautifully composed and sang alongwith his brother late Jayanta Hazarika, was one of the most remarkable songs where he describes about an imaginary Khasi damsel Monalisa Lyngdoh highlighting the ability to play guitar – a sign of culturally active people of Meghalaya.\n\nLien Makao – his another golden number, is a duet with Manna Dey and one of the most popular songs of the film ‘Pratidhwani’. The song carries the message of love and brotherhood among the people of Meghalaya. Similarly many of his creations carry the message of unity among the people of hills and plains.\n\nHe had a far reaching plan to create a common archive cum museum where songs of different tribes of the North-east would be preserved. He mentioned about the rich musical tradition of the Khasis, Jaintias, Garos, Hajongs etc in his songs, journals and interviews.\n\nIn the year 1970, Bhupen Hazarika won as an independent M.L.A. and placed in Shillong – the capital of undivided Assam. He was accommodated in the Room No. 33 at Pinewood Hotel, Shillong. It was the glorious moment for the people of Assam and Meghalaya. He did his best to develop the prevailed situation of rich musical traditions of Assam and the Khasis.\n\nHis brother and ex-professor of St. Anthony’s College, Sri Balen Hazarika still remembers the day and said to me once, “Bhupen da was the MLA and it was a moment of joy for his family members as well as fans. I along with many friends used to visit the assembly hall regularly just to witness the interesting yet unforgettable debates by the ministers and MLAs including Bhupen da. Bhupen da was always vocal about the importance of preserving the age-old traditions of our people and expected that the government would do their best and offer financial support for projects like the creation of an archive, Jyoti Chitraban, etc.”\n\nThe leading personalities among the Khasi intellectuals and thinkers like Dr. Helen Giri, Chesterfield Khongwir, etc. extended their full support and cooperation to Dr. Hazarika by helping him in showcasing Khasi cultural heritage in various occasions particularly outside of North-east India. Their commendable work in the ‘21st Banga Sanskriti Sanmilani’ was an unforgettable experience for thousands of audiences who thronged the venue to witness the colourful cultural heritage of the seven sisters where Dr. Hazarika’s role as the head of the northeast troupe as well as the interpreter of the entire programme is a matter to be specially referred to.\n\nDr. Hazarika was a successful film and music director. He directed a number of films in Assamese, Bengali and Hindi. In most of the films, that he directed, he himself was the script writer, lyricist, and music director. He directed some remarkable TV serials, too. His films were highly acclaimed and he was nominated as the best music director several times in his life. One of his unforgettable films was ‘Pratidhwani’ in 1964. It was a romantic film based on the life and culture of the Khasis. The same was dubbed into Khasi as ‘Ka Sharati’ which brought laurels to the state by receiving the Silver medal from the President of India. Further, the film was invited to the International Film Festival held in France in the same year. Dr. Hazarika had to work hard to collect money to make the film. He used to travel from one village to another along with his only God gifted property – the sweet and powerful voice. After this film he became a loving hero among the Khasis.\n\nDr. Hazarika used to perform at different concerts and events throughout Meghalaya including Garo hills; mostly to raise funds for noble causes like opening of a school, orphanage etc. Once in the ‘Laban Bihu Sanmilan’ the then people’s leader professor R. H. Lyngdoh emotionally hugged Dr. Hazarika and regretted saying, “Bhupen is better known outside than in the northeast.” This is partially true. Many of his evergreen compositions carry the message of love and unity among the people of northeast depicting their age-old relationship. But most of them are written and composed in Assamese and later translated into some other major Indian languages. Further, no significant steps are taken to translate his songs into other major languages of the Northeast. Local media is also responsible for that.\n\nDr. Hazarika had written a number of articles where he mentioned about the people and culture of Meghalaya. He had deep knowledge about the cultural heritage of the tribes of Meghalaya. Theoretically he knew all the nukes of Nongkrem and other dance forms as well as the traditional dances of Garos and Jaintias.\n\nToday, at this time of social disorder and misunderstanding, Dr. Hazarika will remain an inspiration for thousands who are craving for peace and brotherhood. I have a firm belief that if his songs and other creations are correctly translated into different languages of the North-east and also if the new generation singers carry the deep meaningful messages of his songs, the negative attitudes of life will minimize to a great extent. Being a disciple of Paul Robeson and a person of principle he has proved many times through his powerful songs that ‘GAAN’ (music), and not ‘GUN’, can be the ideal and the cheapest instrument to fight against all social evils. Dr. Hazarika was an optimist and his songs reflect the same. Praising the monumental treasure work of U Soso Tham he said, “…Great people come once to the world to leave their foot prints through their golden creations. ‘Ka Duitara Ksiar’ is one among them….”\n\nBhupen Hazarika had a sense of humour. Once someone in America asked him the meaning of his name, he said, “‘Bhu’ means the earth in Assamese. I am the ‘pen’ of the ‘earth’.” Though the statement was comical, it best fitted him.\n\nTruly, his writings reflect the love, happiness, miseries and sorrows of the mass. His songs have a universal appeal. Through his immortal creations he has proved that the pen is mightier than the sword. He is no more today, but his golden voice will forever act as the guiding force resonating peace and harmony among the people of different culture when racial and religious intolerance have reached the extremum.\n\nBy - Ankur Deka\n\nEmail: ankur1966@gmail.com\n\nPriyamvada Patel Hazarika (wife of Bhupen Hazarika) paying her respect to Dr. Hazarika at a function in Guwahati, Assam\n\n↧\n\nLucky Ali and Joi Barua in Bangalore ● Photo Showcase\n\nThousands of Bangaloreans flocked at the Audogodi Police ground on November 04, 2012 as a myriad of celebrated musicians came together for the harmony concert “Sadbhavna Bangalore 2012”.

The fascinating story of juvenile Piscine Molitor, the lone survivor of a shipwreck as he travels across the Pacific ocean on a life boat, a makeshift raft and a ferocious Bengal tiger 'Richard Parker' for a companion. The big question - will he make it?\n\nLife Of Pi - a film by Ang Lee\n\nIrfan Khan as an adult Pi does justice to his role. Tabu, Adil Hussain, Vibish Sivakumar as Pi's mother, father and brother too have delivered brief but memorable performances. (Being an Assamese it was a proud moment to watch Adil Hussain be part of something so coveted and well crafted). But, it's the teen actor Suraj Sharma who shoulders the mighty task of carrying the story forward, and does so skilfully by infusing the necessary maturity and innocence to Pi's character.\n\nThe most impressive part about the narrative is that although it's an adult Pi telling his story to a reporter (which means Pi actually lives), not once does the plot feels predictable. There are surprises, pleasant and shocking throughout the 127 minutes of exhilarating cinematic experience. Yann Martel's book leaves readers pondering at the end whether Pi's story is an allegory of another set of parallel events or vice versa, and questions the need for rationalizing faith. This was well achieved with Irfan Khan's narration juxtaposed with that of Suraj Sharma's.\n\nSuraj Sharma, Tabu and Ang Lee\n\nAng Lee avoids the common Indian stereotypes and paints a pretty picture of Pondicherry, especially during the initial few minutes of name casting. With the 3D glasses on, everything appears at an arm's length. The background score is subtle and soothing but you wouldn't find yourself paying much attention to it. The visual effects transcends reality and merges the surreal. There is this one scene in particular where the entire ocean is covered with jelly fishes which makes you feel like 'this is what heaven must look like'.\n\nDirector Ang Lee's fascination towards picturesque, visually appealing cinema is no news to anyone, but with Life of Pi he achieved what James Cameron paved way for when he directed Avatar.\n\n- by Parmita Borah\n\n↧\n\nGrammy award winning Deep Forest to perform at ‘Deep India’ concert\n\nEric Mouquet (Deep Forest)\n\nDeep Forest, the Grammy Award winning band from France will be performing for the first time in India at 'Deep India' concert on Thursday, December 13. The venue Vivanta by Taj at MG Road, Bangalore in collaboration with Sony Music will showcase this musical evening.\n\nDeep Forest, comprising of Michel Sanchez and Eric Mouquet, was nominated for a Grammy Award for the first time in 1994 and won the award for the album 'Boheme' in 1995. The band is known for their unique music, also known as 'ethnic electronica'.\n\nThe band will be performing in the city to celebrate the “one with nature” rainforest retreat 'Vivanta Madikeri Coorg'. Their collaboration with Santoor maestro Rahul Sharma will be available in an upcoming album ‘Deep India’. One of the tracks from the album is a tribute to Vivanta by Taj - Madikeri, Coorg, a visually stunning rainforest retreat spread across 180 acres.\n\nTickets of the event are priced at Rs.2000 and one can contact 080-6660-4444 for advance booking.\n\nVivanta by Taj Currently comprises of 25 hotels and resorts in India and the Indian Ocean region. Vivanta by Taj is represented across key metropolitan capitals as well as popular holiday destinations like Goa, Kerala, Rajasthan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.\n\n- EFNI\n\n↧\n\nCandid conversation with Eric Mouquet - frontman of Grammy Award winning Deep Forest\n\nFrench duo Eric Mouquet and Michel Sanchez from the Grammy Award winning ‘Deep Forest’ are all set to perform in Bangalore. World music and Electronica enthusiasts can watch them live at The Deep India Concert on December 13, 2012 at Vivanta by Taj (6.30 PM onwards). Deep Forest is celebrated in the world music scene for fusing ethnic music with dance and chill-out beats. Their albums have sold over 10 million copies and they are also the recipients of the World Music Awards - French group with the highest 1995 world sales.\n\nEric Mouquet and Parmita Borah (© Jim Ankan Deka)\n\nWe managed to catch hold of the charming Eric Mouquet, a day before his performance at Vivanta by Taj, Bangalore, and spoke about his two decades long musical journey and his collaboration with Indian musician Rahul Sharma; and dig this – made him sing a Hindi song! Here’s an excerpt of our brief yet fun filled conversation –\n\nParmita Borah: It’s been twenty years that you’ve been associated with the music industry. How has your journey been?\n\nEric Mouquet: It’s been fantastic and adventerous. I didn’t imagine when we began, that we would come this far. I consider myself very lucky because I continue to travel, meet musicians, do shows and concerts. The beauty of this whole journey is that you get to meet new people and always have the inspiration to make new projects. So it’s been an amazing adventure.\n\nEric Mouquet of Deep Forest (© Jim Ankan Deka)\n\nPB: When we say ‘electronica’, mostly trance and mash ups come to mind; and there’s ‘ethnic eletronica’ which seems to have folk elements.\n\nEM: It’s hard to say. When I was a teenager, electronica was preferred, it wasn’t dance at all, it was ambient music. Today it’s all about club and dance. I think every generation has it’s own taste (laughs). For me electronica is a way to use the synthesizer, and the sequencer and a way to compose music using technical things like sampling, analog and digital sounds. Ofcourse, trance is a part of it, and we will play trance at our performace tomorrow, but the scope of electronica is much wider than that.\n\nPB: Of all your global collaborations, you’ve have recently collaborated with Indian musician Rahul Sharma. Tel us something about that.\n\nEM: To be honest, I didn’t know Rahul Sharma before this project. Sony Music asked me to listen to Rahul Sharma’s Santoor works, it’s a very beautiful instrument and Rahul’s a very good musician. It’s always easy to work with a good musician because we speak the same language. Our project is supported by Vivanta by Taj, and therefore we will be performing in Bangalore and Coorg.\n\nEric Mouquet and Parmita Borah (© Jim Ankan)\n\nPB: About your association with Vivanta by Taj, would you like to tell us something about that?\n\nEM: Actually Rahul was in Vivanta by Taj, Madikere. There he recorded some nature sound effects, drum beats and vocals and sent them for me to get a feel of the place. Later we worked on the sounds, wrote a song and now we have a song called Viva Madikere, inspired by the beauty of the land.\n\nPB: Did he teach you any Hindi song?\n\nEM: None as yet.\n\nI broke into the song ‘Pyaar Huwa Ikraar Huwa’ from Shree 420, and Eric Mouquet pretty much got it right at his second attempt, making me his first Hindi Teacher! Deep Forest will be performing on December 13, 2012 at Vivanta by Taj, 6.30 PM onwards. Catch them live at The Deep India Concert if you want to kick start your weekend in a cool way.\n\n- by Parmita Borah\n\n↧\n\nSitar Maestro who put Indian music on international map took his final bow\n\nPt. Ravi Shankar (1920-2012)\n\nI can't claim to know much about Pandit Ravi Shankar's music, nor much about music for that matter; but it is safe to say that with his demise, the world of music has suffered another massive blow, and not just in the Indian scene but on a whole global front.\n\nIn the 1960's when India was still struggling to segregate and discover it's own identity from that of the leftover influence of Brits, a musician from orthodox classical music background emerged as a music icon of the western hippie culture. Was it dumb luck that shot him to fame? Not Likely. Dumb luck is for Gangam Style, not the likes of people who understood and fused genres with polar differences and created a blend that could be grasped and loved by many.\n\nThe multi talented Maestro wrote the Oscar-nominated score for 1982 film \"Gandhi,\" several books, and mounted theatrical productions. His popularity exploded in the west for his multiple collaborations with western musicians, George Harrison being the most enduring one. Amongst his numerous performances in the west the most notable ones include the Woodstock Music Festival, Monterey Pop Festival and one at the Concert for Bangladesh at Madison Square Gardens in New York City (of which he was a co-organiser along with Harrison). Pandit Ravi Shankar’s influence in classical music, including on composer Philip Glass, is equally noteworthy. His work with Menuhin on their \"West Meets East\" albums in the 1960s and 1970s earned them a Grammy, and he wrote concertos for sitar and orchestra for both the London Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic.\n\nPandit Ravi Shankar has been the recipient of many prestigious awards and recognition. Silver Bear Extraordinary Prize of the Jury at the 1957 Berlin International Film Festival, Sangeet Natak Akademi Award; the three highest national civil honours of India: Padma Bhushan, in 1967, Padma Vibhushan, in 1981, and Bharat Ratna, in 1999, just to name a few. He was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Elizabeth II for his \"services to music\". He will also receive lifetime achievement Grammy award posthumously, making him the first Indian recipient of the award. The 55th annual Grammy Awards show will be held in Los Angeles on February 10, 2013.\n\nPt. Shankar’s contribution to Indian music is equally substantial – from composing music for Apu Triology to working as the music director of All India Radio, New Delhi, from 1949 to 1956. His legacy however, is not limited to being a brilliant sitar virtuoso; rather, the fact that he helped assimilate traditional Indian Raagas into the ever progressing world of rock and roll, thus opening the flood gates of fusion. He helped to craft and develop a genre of music that the whole world could understand, relate to and enjoy. While fusion experiments may not always be successful, but with the sitar going global and forming a core part of rock ballads, jazz and world music, Shankar threw light on centuries-old traditions of Indian music which would have otherwise remained unknown. Niklas Stålvind, lead guitarist of the Swedish heavy metal band ‘Wolf’ himself played the sitar on the track “Electric Raga. A synergy like that is feasible today, thanks to the vision that Pandit Ravi Shankar had many decades back.\n\nThere’s little wonder why George Harrison of Beatles labelled him as the ‘godfather of world music’.\n\n- by Parmita Borah\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nPsychedelic evening with Deep Forest at Deep India concert\n\nElectronica may be the flavor of the hour, but certainly not my first choice. Therefore a day before The Deep India Concert at Vivanta by Taj on December 13, 2012, I decided to chat up with Eric Mouquet, the front man of Grammy Award winning Deep Forest, and learn a thing or two about his music. (Click here to read Eric Moquet's interview). He clarified my doubt that although elctronica has become synonymous with mash-ups, club and dance music for my generation, his music has a wider scope to it. Deep Forest strives to create a synergy between technologies like sampling with deep rooted folk elements and even organic sound effects. Deep India is a spin off of that very concept.\n\nDeep India Concert at Vivanta by Taj\n\nFor those who didn't know 'The Deep India concert' is a brief musical tour to promote the project 'Deep India', a collaboration between Deep Forest and Indian santoor player Rahul Sharma. The event was on the breezy evening of December 13, at Vivanta by Taj. Our moods pretty much in sync with psychedelic lights emitted by busy traffic, we reached an hour early for the concert and binged on yummy tidbits, standing next to an open bar.\n\nI may still not be a trance/elctronica fan, but in all honesty, it was one hell of a show. Deep Forest kicked off the evening with some unhurried dreamy tracks, with David Fall on the drums, Alune Wade on the bass, Olyza Zamati - the vocalist, and the master himself Eric Mouquet on the keys (both on the keyboard and the laptop).\n\nThe highlight of the show has got to be composition 'Viva Madikere,' an ode to the enchanting hill station town Madikere. There's an interesting story behind this song. It so happened that Indian santoor player had recorded some drum beats, vocals and natural sound effects during his stay at Madikere and send them to Eric to get a flavor of the land. Inspired by the flavors of the place, Deep Forest worked on the song and named it 'Viva Madikere', which later paved way for the complete musical collaboration - Deep India. The audience were equally thrilled to groove to a Bihu song (traditional folk song of Assam) that Eric had fused with techno beats!\n\n- by Parmita Borah 5HUE2USGAHPQ\n\nEric Mouquet of Deep Forest at Deep India Concert (photo - Jim Ankan Deka)\n\nOlyza Zamati at Vivanta by Taj, Bangalore (photo - Jim Ankan Deka)\n\nAlune Wade of Deep Forest at Deep India Concert, Bangalore, India (photo - Parmita Borah)\n\nOlyza Zamati at Deep India Concert, Vivanta by Taj, Bangalore (photo - Jim Ankan Deka)\n\nDavid Fall at Deep India Concert, Vivanta by Taj, Bangalore (photo - Jim Ankan Deka)\n\nEric Mouquet of Deep Forest at Vivanta by Taj, Bangalore (photo - Jim Ankan Deka)\n\nOlyza Zamati of Deep Forest at Vivanta by Taj, Bangalore (photo - Jim Ankan Deka)\n\nEric Mouquet at Deep India Concert, Vivanta by Taj, India (photo - Jim Ankan Deka)\n\n↧\n\nHornbill Festival 2012, Nagaland ● Photo Showcase\n\nHundreds gathered at the the Hornbill Festival2012, a week long celebration that showcases Nagaland's rich tribal culture.
