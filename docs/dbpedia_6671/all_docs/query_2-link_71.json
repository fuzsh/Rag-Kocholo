        "text": "Debutant music composer Anirudh Ravichander unravels the mystery behind the new song.\n\nIN FOCUS\n\nKeeping aside political issues, scams and who’s entering The house, the event that’s making headlines is The Kolaveri song. We call it an event, because it’s the first regional track to top charts and be aired on radio stations across the nation, let alone music channels. ‘The Soup song’ has been viewed over 1.8 million times on the internet domain, that too in just days of its release. It’s now the most searched song on video sharing websites and Tweeple are taking to Kolaveri as the latest trend word. Apart from the amateur, quirky yet fun Tanglish lyrics, what sets the song apart from other such released tracks is its catchy tune. And the man behind it is none other than a 21-year-old debutant music composer, Anirudh Ravichander. A tete-atete with the lad who’s got the nation headbanging to the Kolaveri tune.\n\nJust 21 and a music composer already! Tell us about it?\n\nBasically what happened, in college, Aishwarya (the director) shot many short films for which I had composed music. Now she’s taken the big leap and so my debut album; precisely my big leap too (laughs). Music has been on my mind ever since I was four. I finished all my grades from the Trinity College of Music. I have been part of a band both in school and high school. It was more about carnatic fusion back then. I started playing the piano real young, though my initial tunes were horrendous (I laugh at them now,) I’ve come a long way. In college, I became a part of a rock band. Though the influences paid off pretty well, my main interest always lies in commercial music.\n\nYour inspiration if any?\n\nI am born in the 90s and for most musicians my age, AR Rahman is a sure shot idol. Rahman is an inspiration both personally and professionally. Though, I don’t think I’d ever copy his style.\n\nThe story of the Soup Song…\n\nKolaveri Di was made keeping the youth in mind. The whole situation of the song is of love failure. When Aishwarya gave me the cue, I worked on it. The tune and structure was ready in about 5-10 mins (sounds unreal but it’s true.) When Dhanush heard the track I’d composed, he started penning down the lyrics in broken Tamil. The idea we kept in mind was, how would a Tamilian, who doesn’t know English, sing a song on love failure? And in less than 20 minutes we were done with the quirky Tanglish track which fit the tune pretty well.\n\nWhat worked for Kolaveri Di?\n\nIt’s wonderful how there’s no language barrier in music. I think that worked for Kolaveri’s success. Not only is the tune catchy and hummable but also are the lyrics quirky and fun. But the USP of the song is got to be it’s colloquialism and that one can relate to the emotion of the song. That’s why this song struck a chord.\n\nSome critics say the lyrics are quite anti-women. Your views…\n\nThis is a fun loving song. It’s in no way anti-women. Trust me, I have most respect for women, much more than I have for men. We had fun making this song, and that’s how I work. I need to enjoy while I compose.\n\nA little about the tracks in the album 3?\n\nThe Soup song is one of a kind and I can safely say the album is a mix of different genres. No two songs sound alike. There are almost 7 songs in the album and three themes. And yes, included in that is a duet by Shruti Haasan and Dhanush too.\n\nThis song is a success; what do you feel about it? What plans next?\n\nI still haven’t recovered from the shock. I feel pretty overwhelmed that my debut song as a composer has topped the charts and has gone global. And thanks to The Soup Song rage, I’ve been flooded with offers, some real big ones too, not only in Kollywood but also in Bollywood. But right now I’m just busy with this album and want to concentrate and focus on it without being carried away. I just want to give my best and live up to the expectations of the people. What I’m looking forward is to compose the background score of the album as that’s what truly judges the ability of a music composer.\n\nSimi Kuriakose.\n\nSome of the best spiritual singers from the country — Parvathy Baul, Mukhtiar Ali, Warsi Brothers, and others — join whirling dervishes from Turkey for the eleventh edition of the Sufi and mystic music festival, Ruhaniyat.\n\nWatch them perform under a star-lit sky at Horniman Circle, Mumbai this weekend.\n\nWith nine groups from different parts of the country being part of Ruhaniyat, the common thread that runs through the festival is the theme of devotion, spirituality and the feeling of oneness with God. “ Seventy per cent of the performances included in the schedule are new, while the remaining performances have been seen at Ruhaniyat earlier,” reveals Mahesh Babu, director of Banyan Tree Events, which organises Ruhaniyat. Babu spends seven months in a year meeting people who are practitioners of Sufism or Mysticism.\n\n“ Music is puja for them, it’s part of their daily life. Listening to them transports me to a different world,” he adds. This year for the first time the line- up at the Sufi music festival includes Devaram, mystic hymns dating back to the 7th century from Madurai, Waee from remote villages of the deserts of Kutch and polyphony songs from Bulgaria.\n\nMystic minstrel from Bengal\n\nParvathy Baul, who has been a part of the festival since its first year, says it has always been a fantastic experience for her. “ All the artists who come there carry such a valuable treasure. We get the opportunity to meet not just artists but sadhakas and practictioners of Sufism,” she says.\n\nBaul started studying the Baul parampara 18 years ago.\n\nShe lived with her gurus and learnt from them. “ Those were the best years of my life. It was such an uplifting relationship.\n\nIt’s a sublime relationship that takes you beyond the pettiness of daily life. It is a time when you can be a real student and surrender at the feet of the Guru,” reminisces Baul.\n\nAsk her what is the one message that she thinks her music delivers, and she says, “ Love. Love more and more.\n\nPractising love is Sahaja Yoga, a simple connection. When we sing and dance we lose the ego.\n\nLove helps transcend all the dos and don’ts in life. You let yourself flow and experience a oneness with the universe,” she says. The singer believes that if love is paramount letting go of one’s ego is not so difficult. “ Let there be no duality.\n\nDuality comes from ego.” To the layman it may appear that Baul lets herself flow without abandon and loses herself completely when she sings, “ On the contrary, I find myself,” she remarks.\n\n“ We are lost most other times. When we are connected to the Lord, we find ourselves”. The love for the Lord is so eminent in everything she says, “ The love is hard to describe. I can only say, I have not fallen in love, I have risen in love,” she adds as she breaks into a laugh.\n\nTamil Nadu’s temple music\n\nMutukumaran and Kumaraswaminathan, who have come to the city from Kanjanur village in Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu to be part of Ruhaniyat for the first time, believe that music is the most beautiful when it is sung to the Lord. They sing the music of the Nayanmars, the 63 Shaivite devotional poets/ saints of Tamil Nadu. “ We wake up the Lord with our songs. It’s our tradition to sing in the temples,” says Mutukumaran adding “ We are coming to Mumbai and we are going to be listening to Sufi music for the first time.” The music is passed on from one generation to another by word of mouth. Mutukumaran learnt from his father and now he is teaching his son as well.\n\nKabir’s wisdom\n\nFor 26 generations, singer Mukhtiyar Ali’s family has been passing on their knowledge about the traditional music. Ali is famous for his Kabirbanis.\n\n“ We will try to keep the tradition alive and my kids are learning Kabirbani from me,” he says. “ When I sing Kabir ( sic) I only feel one needs to understand oneself. If people listen to Kabir’s words and implement them, they will be able to realise and understand themselves a lot better,” he adds. Before signing off, he quotes words of Kabir, which have inspired him the most and he feels are most needed today: Pothi pad- pad jag mua pandit bhaya na koi, Dhai akshar prem ke pade so pandit hoye ( No one becomes a scholar, reading great books of the world, But he who has studied the four letters of ‘love’, is a learned man.)\n\nSUREKHA S.\n\n‘Glocal’ music maker Akshai Sarin is set to release his first major EDM album on Tiesto’s Black Hole Recordings early next year.\n\nDepending on who you ask, Akshai Sarin is either the new poster boy of Indian electronica or just another good-looking pretender populating the creative firmament of Mumbai. Admittedly, while the noise around him is still an underground buzz, it’s one with potential to get louder.\n\nSample this: Even though his debut album Soundscapes released when he was just 16, Akshai’s first mainstream album Connectedis set for worldwide release on Dutch heavyweight Tiesto’s label Black Hole Recordings in January 2012. He’s also recently played at the Exit Festival in Serbia, a four-day event near the Danube river, where over 2.5 million revelers relentlessly party across 20 different stages, covering every genre from Metal to Reggae, with artists including Arcade Fire, Deadmau5, Magnetic Man, Jamiroquai, MIA and Portishead. His collaboration with Russian Trace duo Moonbeam on a track called Elephant Ride, the video for which was shot outside Dadar Station and an under-construction building, last year is due to hit a major international music channel in the country any week now. Whatever the hype (or lack thereof), there’s a lot bubbling beneath the surface.\n\nA complex bundle of both confidence and humility, Akshai wears the hats of composer, producer and performer with the ease of a seasoned pro. A formally trained musician, he learnt the tabla when he was eight apart from taking piano lessons, before going on to study at theLondon School of Music. “Creating music has always been a part of my life. I’ve been making music for a really long time. When I released Soundscapes, it was like Buddha Bar but way before Buddha Bar. It’s something I take pride in, I guess. The album was a digital release and I realised the power of technology when people started ordering it from as far off as Austriaand Bosnia.”\n\nWhile in London, Akshai also played at the 2005 Glastonbury Music Festival and even tried his hand at DJ’ing before giving it up two years ago to focus on making original music. “I started playing live gigs in 2007 and performed at the Singapore F1 Rocks event two years in a row alongside artists like Beyonce, The Black Eyed Peas, N.E.R.D, Empire of the Sun and The Chemical Brothers. One of the most interesting gigs I played at though was in Bangalore, for the silver jubilee celebrations of the Art of Living Foundation in 2006,” he says.\n\nErmcome again? He grins when he says, “There were nearly 800,000 people at the Jakkur airfield, where I performed a remix of the theme song Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, meaning ‘one world, one family’. I got on stage with just a laptop and keyboard and saw a sea of people in front of me, including Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, dadas, dadis, uncles, aunties, kids, tribal people from Chattisgarh, Abdul Kalam, and the presidents of France, Mauritius and Germany. I started to play the chorus and then suddenly kicked into some hardcore breakbeats and heavy basslines and saw people curiously moving in closer and closer. Next thing I know, they were all jumping and dancing around with the happiest looks on their faces! They kept asking for an encore! It was surreal because this was a seriously spiritual audience and Shubha Mudgal had just performed, and then there was me! It’s a different high playing for an audience like that. That’s when I realised that as long as you keep your music real and the emotion behind it intact, there’s no reason why people won’t appreciate it.”\n\nThere’s a mystical streak running through the musician and it’s apparent when he talks about an album he did for his aunt a meditation instructor called (don’t laugh now!) The Ultimate Aha. “We recorded it when I was in still in university, behind a flour mill, on a zero budget. We actually had to record when the mill wasn’t running to avoid the sound it generated!” he laughs. “The response we got to that album was phenomenal though. My aunt still gets emails for it 10 years later. It’s nice to know that the album you put the least money and the most love and effort into actually reached out to people. Often we’re so isolated in our existence that I think what everyone just wants to do whether at a club or at an ashram is connect with other people on a more visceral level. For me, music is a way of connecting with other people.” Having preferred to stand outside the mainstream all this while, Akshai confesses, “To be honest, one of the reasons why I haven’t released a lot of music is because I’m scared. It’s a big part of who I am and I’m afraid of being judged. So I’ve taken the easy way out so far.”\n\nZahra Khanon .BT.\n\nIf music be the food of life, India is where you ought to be.

It was only after an extended period of planning that the first Kingfisher October Fest was held from 11th to 13th November, 2005, at the Palace Grounds, Bangalore. It has grown in heaps and bounds since its inception in Bangalore. Fashioned around the very premise of Woodstock ’69, with an aim to spread love, peace and music, this fest reflected another aspect. And that was, spread the good times among the numerous people who converged to the place from various parts of the country. Apart from this, a whole lot of associated events taking place all over the fest ground grabbed the attention of people attending the fest. Various beer games, a flea market, tattoo artists, face painters, doll dancers, stilt walkers etc., kept the high spirits lingering over the period of the three days, making this event a huge success. Banglore’s eclectic music scene goes back to early in the city’s history and encompasses a wide variety of music including country, folk, jazz, blues and rock.

He was, of course, both of these, but the kind of impact this genius has had in the socio-cultural-political space of a huge geographic region comprising the North-East India, West Bengal and Bangladesh would be hard to grasp for anyone who does not understand the Assamese and Bengali languages.\n\nFor the rest of India, Dr. Hazarika (the “Dr.” is not one of those bestowed upon cinema, cultural and political personalities by universities whose administrators are usually keen to rub shoulders with the recipients, but one had earned by completing a Ph.D from Columbia University in the early 1950s on how cultural tools can be used to spread the reach of education) is known for his fabulous music in Kalpana Lajmi’s “Rudali”, particularly that in the song “Dil Hoom Hoom Kare” (based on his 1960s composition “Buku Ham Ham Kare” from the Assamese film “Moniram Dewan”), and his song “Ganga Behti Ho Kyun” (an adaption of “Ol’ Man River” by his friend, inspiration and civil rights activist-singer Paul Robson).\n\nBut what would remain unknown to music lovers outside Assamese and Bengali-speaking communities is Dr. Hazarika’s immense capacity to write, compose and sing songs for nearly 75 years (he first sang as a 10-year-old kid in cultural doyen Jyotiprasad Agarwalla’s second film “Indramalati” in 1939, also the second Assamese film after Agarwalla’s “Joymoti” four years before that) reflecting virtually every social issue, every political development, every season, every community, every emotion of the entire North-East and its neighbourhood – not to forget his numerous songs surrounding the subject of the river Brahmaputra, his lifelong inspiration.\n\nWhether it was the Bangladesh Liberation Struggle – the government of that country has already announced the Muktijoddha Padak, the highest civilian award there, to him posthumously, while despite a long-pending demand from the entire North-East India as well as a unanimous resolution passed by the Assam State Assembly, the Indian government could not confer the Bharat Ratna to him while he was alive – the 1962 Chinese aggression, the establishment of the Guwahati University in 1948, the carving out of the states of Meghalaya and Nagaland out of Assam, the anti-foreign infiltration movement of the early 1980s or the ULFA-induced insurgency, Dr. Hazarika has a song for everything. And each of these songs can be hummed along by any Assamese almost word to word, such evergreen classics they have been, just like probably over 95 per cent of the over 1,500 songs he wrote, composed and sung, some of them together with his highly-talented brother Jayanta Hazarika, who died young in the mid-1970s, and who too like his elder brother had become a legend by the time he was in his late 20s.\n\nOne reason why Dr. Hazarika’s songs did not travel much outside the Assamese-Bengali-speaking areas were their cultural rootedness, even though his compositions always had a universality about them (to get a sense of what I am trying to convey, please listen to his songs in Assamese and Bengali available on Youtube and many other platforms on the Internet). Even Gulzar, while translating some of his classics into Hindi for HMV (now Saregama)’s album “Main Aur Mera Saaya” had spoken about this aspect of Dr. Hazarika’s lyrics.\n\nWhat would also remain outside the geographies mentioned is also the fact that Dr. Hazarika was not just a lyricist-composer-singer. He was also a filmmaker – one who in 1992 was conferred with India’s highest honour in cinema, the Dada Saheb Phalke Award – a prolific writer, a painter, an editor who for years edited a highly-popular magazine “Amaar Pratinidhi”, a politician who served one term in the Assam Assembly as a Left-leaning independent politician in the late 1960s (in contrast to his failed attempt to enter the Lok Sabha much later as a BJP candidate, which was a rare and only failure in the public arena for him, and a classic example of how an entire community rejected the political face of a legend even while never stopping to shower him with love in his avatar as a creative artiste), a children’s literature writer, a cultural ambassador (he served as the chairman of the Sangeet Natak Akademi), and a relentless crusader for social harmony.\n\nWhat made him even more unique was his innate quality of being accessible to anyone and everyone of his fans. During his live performances in numerous open-air stages every April for over five decades all over Assam during the Rongali Bihu (the Assamese new year festival every mid-April), thousands would get into a virtual reverie listening to his songs and the conversations he would have with the crowd in between.\n\nPersonally, it was sometime in 1977-78, when as a 10-year-old, I first met Dr. Bhupen Hazarika in person, and in really close quarters. We used to stay in one half of a rented accommodation in Guwahati’s Rajgarh locality, the other half being the residence of the late Nirode Chowdhury, one of the most popular Assamese writers whose stories “Chameli Memsab” and “Banahangsa” have in the previous couple of years been made into highly-popular films with music by the maestro. Nirode Chowdhury’s house was virtually an extension of our house and as a kid I would often be found rummaging through his great collection of books. Like every Assamese would be, I too had been indoctrinated automatically into his fan club by that age, quite clearly beyond the capacity to understand the import of much of his lyrics but enthralled by the mellifluousness of his compositions. For a young kid of that age, he was “Bhupen Mama”, the name he had assumed as a writer of children’s literature, particularly some fun poems through which he had made learning the alphabet and words easier for us. Despite his literary-musical sessions with Chowdhury, he would indulge us kids, sometimes asking interesting questions, sometimes teasing us, sometimes saying something funny.\n\nLater, in the late 1980s, as an over-enthusiastic college student, I put up some (now looking at it, very amateurish) photographs of landscapes I had shot with my automatic camera in a first-ever Kala Mela in Guwahati, which had the participation of some of the top painters and photographers of Assam. Looking back, I can clearly see that the organisers were more than encouraging to allow me to participate in that event, given the standard of my photography. But Dr. Hazarika, who came in as a special visitor to the art fair, spent quite a few minutes praising my photography (by then, of course, he did not remember the little me he had met a decade before). Looking back, I now understand that it was his way of encouraging an enthusiastic youngster to pursue his interests. It was his style, to make everyone feel at ease and one’s own.\n\nLater, in my avatar as a journalist and film critic, I met him many times in both Assam and Delhi, sometimes professionally and sometimes personally. Most of the time, his words would have me eat out of his hands, even as he would make me share his lunch or dinner. An eternal prankster, he even did not forget to pull my leg when I met him during one of his Delhi visits days after I had been declared as the winner of the Swarna Kamal for the Best Film Critic at the 50th National Film Awards in 2003. “You have always been interviewing me, now get ready to be interviewed when you next visit Assam, now that you have become the first person from the North-East to win the Best Film Critic’s Award,” he joked as his long-time companion and filmmaker Kalpana Lajmi and senior journalist Samudra Gupta Kashyap of the Indian Express enjoyed my discomfiture. It was during that visit that he had shared with me his plans to make a feature film with Assam’s insurgency as the backdrop. Unfortunately, soon thereafter, he started keeping unwell, and that film never got made. I am sure if it had got made, it would have been a strong rebuttal against violence and a call for survival of humanity, something he had strongly believed in and had got reflected in his song “Manuhe Manuhor Baabe, Jodihe Okono Nabhabe” (“If human beings don’t take care of the mankind, who will”).\n\nAs I write this, it is past 1 AM on the 8th of November. About 12 hours ago, his body arrived in Guwahati from Mumbai. It took his body nearly 8 hours to travel about 25 kms to his home in the Nizarapar locality, as lakhs of people thronged the route to have a glimpse of the maestro earlier in the day. Now his body lies in state in the Judge’s Field, a location where he had sung numerous times. And even at this late hour, a queue of people – comprising kids to senior citizens – several kilometres in length is slowly, and in a very remarkably disciplined manner, moving ahead for a last glimpse of the maestro before his body is cremated within the next 24 hours. As I see this in the continuous live telecast in news channels from Assam on my DTH system sitting at my home in Delhi, I can see that it is his message for humanity mainly through his music that is drawing in the multitudes. Quite clearly, the genius of Dr. Bhupen Hazarika will live on through his songs, and in the hearts of his fans.\n\nI don’t know if a river cries, and even if one does, I don’t know if its tears can be seen in the flowing waters. But I am sure, the Old Man River, the Brahmaputra, is today quietly shedding a tear, just as quietly it flows, having lost a genius born on its banks. Indeed, it’s not surprising that Dr. Hazarika’s last recording to come into the public domain would be a poem on the river that remained his permanent inspiration. The poem is being used as a prelude in young filmmaker Bidyut Kotoky’s under-production bilingual feature film “as the River flows…” (Hindi) / “Ekhon Nedekha Nodir Xhipaare” (Assamese), being produced by the National Film Development Corporation. At a personal level, it will be an honour to share credits in a film with the legend, having been associated with it as a script consultant. What more can an eternal fan ask for!"
