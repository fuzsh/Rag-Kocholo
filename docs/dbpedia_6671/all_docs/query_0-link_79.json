        "text": "The Legacy of Bhikhari Thakur is a Bhojpuri language documentary folk album by Assamese Bhojpuri singer Kalpana Patowary, originally written by Bhikhari Thakur. It was released by London-based music label EMI/Virgin records on 14 May 2012 by the Vice Prime Minister of Mauritius Anil Bachoo and Arts and Cultural Minister Mookhesswur Choonee in the Prime Minister’s office in Mauritius.[1]\n\nThe album comprises nine tracks, all of which were written by Bhikari Thakur and Kalpana Patowary using minimal acoustics. The album starts with Bhikari parichay, an autobiographical narrative rendered by Kalpana. On the track Kalyug prem, Bhikhari Thakur talks about the anguish of women whose husbands have become addicted to alcohol. The song relates, \"Born into a family of barbers, he, like many of his fellow natives, moved to Calcutta for work\". Although he later wrote songs questioning the redundant ways and customs of the society, Bhikhari was initially illiterate. \"It was a baniya in Calcutta who taught him to read and write,\" Kalpana said. He then returned to his village and formed the Bhikari Thakur Natak Mandali."
