        "text": "Bhojpuri Music and Cultural Troupe from India here\n\nTHE Bhojpuri Music and Cultural Troupe from India is here in time for the country’s Independence celebrations and the treat to the Guyanese people, compliments of the Guyana and Indian Governments.\n\nThe visitors, led by playback singer, Kalpana Patowary, and her husband, Parwaz Khan, arrived in the country yesterday morning with the rest of their team comprising Saroj Mazumdar, Amar Nathram, Bijay Chouhan and Raja Das, all musicians.\n\nThey paid a courtesy call on Minister of Culture, Youth and Sport, Dr. Frank Anthony, at his Main Street, Georgetown office, just after arrival at the Cheddi Jagan International Airport, where Acting Indian High Commissioner, Tirath Singh, was also present.\n\nPatowary, in brief remarks, said the visit is a very emotional one for her as she thinks about how the Indians left behind, in India, their own land and family to come to Guyana.\n\nMinister Anthony said he was very pleased to welcome the travelling group and expressed confidence that, by means of their performances, they will thrill their audiences.\n\nHe informed them that, in May, Guyana observes a number of significant events including Arrival Day which signifies the coming of Guyanese ancestors from different parts of the world.\n\nVERY APPRECIATIVE\n\n“The music and culture is very much alive here. People do not speak the languages here but we are very appreciative of the music and the films,” Dr Anthony told the visitors.\n\nHe said the group will be performing first at the Indian Monument Gardens in Georgetown, which features a beautiful monument of a ship that signifies the first one that brought Indian indentured immigrants to Guyana. The sculpture was done in India.\n\nThe troupe will also perform at State House in New Amsterdam, Berbice.\n\nDr. Anthony pointed out, as well, the significance of that location where, not far from there, the original set of Indian indentured immigrants landed.\n\nThe Acting High Commissioner explained that Kalpana is a versatile playback singer, well-known as the Bhojpuri Queen. She has done more than 9,000 songs in India and has been singing in 25 Indian dialects.\n\nThe diplomat thanked the minister for making this initiative possible.\n\nKalpana and her team arrived in Guyana from Suriname, where they have just completed a number of successful concerts.\n\n(By Telesha Ramnarine)"
