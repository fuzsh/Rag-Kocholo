        "text": "Assamese singer Kalpana Patowary, who shifted base from Guwahati to Mumbai, has emerged as a front-running artist in the Bhojpuri music world. Having been bestowed with the title of “Queen of Bhojpuri Music”, Kalpana is now working on her first Hindi music video album – Maa-e-ri, which focus on the pristine beauty of North East India.\n\nThe locations for Kalpana’s album are befitting for the album as they take the viewers on a journey through some of the minimally visited locales of the Northeast. The videos have been produced and the production coordinated by Music Box, which has sought hard to present the North east in all its beauty and grandeur. The videos have been shot in locales like Dawki in Meghalaya, Mawlynong village, Cherapunjee, etc.\n\nThe production team has sought to highlight the significance of the locales through the videos. For instance, Mawlyngnong is regarded to be one of the cleanest villages in India.\n\n“The rich sites of this village have been captured in frame, which obviously will whet the senses of an adventurous traveller. The tiny village, otherwise unknown to most people of the world, will now be featured in this video, which will get an edge in the tourism map. The Living Root Bridge, a phenomenon to be seen to be believed is something that tourism buffs will be attracted to after seeing the video, which will be a class apart in its league. A part of the video has also been shot in Cherrapunjee, once the wettest place on earth,” says Kalpana.\n\nMae-e-Ri, apart from portraying the rich tapestry of some of the places of the Northeast has also laid ample emphasis on the costumes, which is an array of attractive colours from the looms of the Northeast. The first costume that Kalpana has worn for her video is an ensemble inspired from one of the tribes of Nagaland. The video captures traditionally garbed Naga tribesmen performing to the beat of Kalpana’s song. “We have also used costumed from Assam, a dress unique to the Darrang District. This costume is mostly worn by the women during the performance of the Deodhani Nritya on the auspicious day of Ma Manasha Puja,” says Kalpana.\n\nThe Deodhani dance is performed either solo or in a group of three to four women essentially on the occasion of the worship of Godesses Manasha. As per myth, Behula had to dance before Goddess Manasha in order to get back her husband’s life. The dancers wear Mekhela-Sador, the unique and traditional attire of the women of Assam. This ethnic ensemble is a two piece dress, with the mekhela being the lower part or the skirt from waist down, which is pleated in two to three folds. This is topped up by a blouse. The Sador is a longish piece of cloth, which is again wrapped very gracefully over the blouse and right across the front of the torso to be folded delicately into the mekhela. The motifs woven into the mekhela-sador are usually inspired by objects from nature, like birds, flowers, trees, etc.\n\nFor Kalpana, this video has been a journey of some of the most coveted moments of her life. Says Kalpana, “I am launching my first International Hindi music album in order to reach out to the maximum number of music lovers around the globe. I am on a journey of evolution through this album. A tribute to Mother Earth, working on this album has been a major experience for me. Let us return to nature because only in nature can the spirit of mankind be found meaningful.”\n\nRate this:\n\nIn a country with over a billion people, countless languages and multitude of musical influences, it takes special talent to stand out from the crowd as an entertainer. Luckily talent is what Assam’s Kalpana has sacks full of.\n\nOne of the most popular Bhojpuri singers in India right now, Kalpana came to attention in 2002 with her breakout hit album, Gawan wa leja Rajaji. Since then she has become a household name having performed on over 150 Bhojpuri film soundtracks, 100 Hindi film songs sung ,recorded more than 400 radio and television jingles and presented Sur Sangram’s season 1 & 2 and other TV shows.\n\nKalpana has been finalized as the judge for the upcoming show Nehle pe dehla “ Nan he Suron Ka Maha Sangraam” on Mahua Tv. The show will showcase the singing prowess of children from both UP & Bihar. In an age where talent coupled with great looks gives one the extra edge, the versatile singer is leaving no stone unturned as she gets ready to make a smashing appearance as one of the judges on Mahua Tv’s childrens music reality show NEHLE PE DEHLA. Apparently, Kalpana has been meticulously planning her looks as she wants to look young and contemporary. New hairdo, revamped wardrobe, a chiselled body… Kalpana can give even the Bollywood heroines a run for their money.\n\n‘Let’s get innocent hearts closer. The show will bring together raw talented kids from all over UP & Bihar. The participants will be in the 8-13 years age group. Nehle pe dehla is a musical forum and opportunity for budding talent for children from UP & Bihar, says Kalpana, and adds, “Mahua channel came up with this unique concept, something different – a show that will have kids from all over UP & Bihar teaming up in a singing reality show where boys will be competing with girls. The girl’s team is boosted by Kalpana whereas the boy’s team is goofed by Pawan Singh.”\n\nKalpana believes that only those who sings well and performs well should win the show. But she also adds, “On a personal note, I support the girls as participants because when I entered the Bhojpuri industry, girl singers were not seen with very good eyes. Achhe Ghar Ki Ladkiya Nahi Gati Hai –the so-called society said. I entered the industry with bhajans, modern songs and even hot item numbers – but proved that singing can also be a professional career for girls. The scenario has changed and I am lucky to have set the trend.”\n\nKalpana is an amazing mentors and she has personally handpicked every contestants by indoor and outdoor selection rounds in Patna, Lucknow, Banaras and other places. At present she is busy with her world music project THE LEGACY OF BHIKHARI THAKUR to be released from Times Music, trying to relive the country’s long-forgotten treasure of Bhojpuri folk music.\n\nRate this:\n\nAshibagee Eshei staged in Oslo\n\nOslo, last week, woke up to the grandeur of Ratan Thiyam and his famed theatre group. The entire troupe of the Chorus Repertory Theatre led by Ratan Thiyam himself staged ‘Ashibagee Eshei’ (Song of the Dead) at the international Ibsen festival 2010 last Wednesday and Thursday. With the staging of the play, Thiyam has once again done the entire Northeast and country proud as ‘Ashibagee Eshei’ was the only play to have been invited from India.\n\n‘Ashibagee Eshei’ had been first performed at the Delhi Ibsen Festival in 2008. Following the staging of this play, the praises are yet to stop pouring in; with even The New York Times waking up to the maestro’s achievement.. The Chorus Repertory Theatre is today acknowledged throughout the world for the successful blending of Eastern and Western art forms. When contacted, Thiyam’s answer to the praise was a simple “Ibsen wrote an unlimited play”.\n\nGirish Pradhan and the Chronicles in Guwahati\n\nAt a time when classic rock is slowly disappeared from the country’s music scene, a new star has arrived in the form of Girish Pradhan and the Chronicles. Within a very short span of time, Girish and his troupe from Gangtok has caught the fancy of rock lovers of the country, primarily on the strength of Girish’s vocal prowess and terrific chemistry between the band members, besides their skill of course. Girish had earlier performed at the Suncan International festival earlier this year and done the country proud by winning the first runners-up position. The band will be performing in the city on Sunday as part of the Rockarolla Pub Rock fest at Blues lounge. A few other bands from the city and the Northeast are also slated to perform the same day.\n\nFilm on groom kidnapping to be released soon\n\nAntardwand, the much-hyped film on groom kidnapping, is finally up for release soon. The film has been in the news for bagging the award for Best Social Issues in the 55th National Filmfare Awards. The film also has a strong Assamese connection in the form of Kalpana Patowary who had sung the much acclaimed mujra number, Kaate na jawani hai o mora raja. Talking about the film, she said, “I am more for the voiceless girl deeply entrenched in a male dominated feudalistic society where she has nothing else to fall back on.”\n\nRate this:"
