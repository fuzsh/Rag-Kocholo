The name of the programme is “Junoon Kuch Kar Dikhane Ka” which is being aired on a new Hindi entertainment channel called NDTV IMAGINE at 8:30 p.m. from every Friday to Sunday. It was nice to hear songs like “axom dekhor bagisare suali…..champa nohoi mure nam chameli”, “manuhey manuhor babey jadihey..” in Kalpana’s melodious voice. Everyone including the judges, audiences were seems to enjoying Assamese songs sung by Kalpana. “Junoon Kuch Kar Dikhane Ka” is a musical reality show to decide country’s most favourite genre of music. There are three genres of music in the programme which includes Sufi, Folk Songs and Hindi Film Music. Kalpana was invited to represent folk music of Bihar and UP as Kalpan has earned a name for herself in Bhojpuri songs and as such she is quite popular among the peoples of UP and Bihar. Kalpana look upon it as a golden opportunity to bring the Assamese folk songs to the international level. She requested NDTV IMAGINE to allow her to sing Assamese folk songs also. But the producers of the programme were at first not interested to include Assamese folk songs in the programme as the Assamese folk songs were not so popular in national level. Her incessant efforts bore fruits when NDTV IMAGINE agreed to include Assamese folk songs in the programme on one condition that Kalpana should concentrate more on Bhojpuri folks. And this is how Kalpana’s journey in “Junoon Kuch Kar Dikhane Ka” begun. It was very nice to see Kalpana singing “manuhey manuhor babey jadihey..” with Ila Arun, one of the judge of the show.\n\nAssamese people were always very supportive with regard to any Assamese contestant in such reality shows. Recent example of this support is Debojit and Anamika. Now it is Kalpana’s turn to make it to the top and for this she needs the good wishes and blessings of the people of Assam. According to Kalpana, when the other contestants knew that she is from Assam everyone get afraid, at first she don’t knew what was the matter later she came to know that everybody fears Assamese contestant as Assamese people were known for their generous voting in support of their candidate. To vote for Kalpana one has to write “Junoon 21” and send it to 56388. We all wish her success in the show.\n\nAuthor info"
