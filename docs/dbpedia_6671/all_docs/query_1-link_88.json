        "text": "When singer Kalpana Patowary moved to Mumbai from her hometown in Assam, 15 years ago, she harboured dreams of a musical career. Never did she imagine that she will be hailed as the Bhojpuri Queen. Heavily influenced by the philosophy of musician and filmmaker, late Bhupen Hazarika, Kalpana was inspired “to explore different genres in music”.\n\nWhile Bollywood always remained a popular category for her, she soon found herself venturing into other “uncharted waters. I started singing in the music industry of North India, particularly Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar. People accepted it and that’s how a my journey began,” recalls Kalpana. It wasn’t long before she shot to fame with her soulful renditions of Bhojpuri music. Breaking misconceptions about the genre being vulgar, she is credited with popularising it and presenting its various forms such as Urvi, Pachra, Sohar, Kajri and Nautanki.\n\nThe versatile singer, who has sung in almost 28 languages, was in Bengaluru recently for a Bhojpuri music concert, organised for the migrant labourers in the city. The event, titled Purabiya Taan: Songs from the East was put together by Maraa, a media and arts collective.\n\nThe group believes that in a city, which is developing by the day, the people responsible for its growth are rarely acknowledged. “Bengaluru has always shied away from being called a migrant city. There is little talk about the people who build it.” says Angarika Guha of Maraa.\n\n“There’s a crisis regarding the identities of these workers. When Maraa decided to bring them together using music, I felt the medium would be serving a purpose beyond entertainment,” she adds .\n\nAs someone who has been to various rural areas, Kalpana she points out that there are still parts where electricity and water are not available to villagers. “Even as we talk about concepts like ‘Incredible India’, there are two realities within the same country. I see Maraa’s efforts as a way of bringing together the two aspects of India.” At the end of the concert, Kalpana also released her latest album at the event, Anthology of Birha, which comprises a collection of folk songs from North India. “They are all songs of separation or migration. Birha is a working man’s song. So, I’m really happy to be releasing it amidst the workers here. It’s a different kind of blessing to be able to bring out the music among the real listeners.”\n\nApart from her distinct set of folk songs, Kalpana has also sung for in Bollywood movies. “Uncha Lamba Kad” from Welcome and Gandi Baat from R... Rajkumar being two of her most well-known tracks. “Bollywood is a very popular medium and people connect to it. So, it has a responsibility to retain folk music in its original format.” While the current trend of fusing traditional songs with Bollywood tracks may well be a way of accepting this responsibility, Kalpana stresses on the need to keep the original form.\n\n“Along with other songs, every film could have one authentic folk song,” she signs off."
