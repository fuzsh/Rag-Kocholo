        "text": "This article will look at the figure of Pratima Barua Pandey, one of the icons of Goalpariya folk music in Assam, through a critical feminist lens. Basing the study on the qualitative method of interviews, especially with musicians, singers and other stakeholders associated with the folk form in question, we will try to locate her persona within a framework of contradictions, as someone who had transgressed the constricting spaces of caste/class/gender to be where she was, with deep and caring relationships with local practitioners of the folk form, and also as someone who co-opted and sanitized the form at the same time, given her social location and the larger politics of culture within which she was located. By including the first-hand narratives of our research participants throughout the article, we attempt to arrive at a 'thick description' of the concerned theme of study. Such an understanding will help to critically interrogate the conventional image of Pratima Pandey as the 'hero' of Goalpariya folk music.\n\nThis article aims to propose an ethnomusicological methodology for the study of Gujarat’s tribal music apart from serving, primarily, as a study of the role of women in the making of the music of a particular tribe – the Rathwas of South Gujarat. For it, I have plumbed works which deal with woman in Western music, comparative ethnomusicological treatises, studies on Indian folklore/musics, and have attempted to adapt the findings of these studies to reflect the concerns and questions which need to be posited in different contexts, all the while attempting to widen their scope enough to allow for reproduction at the level of method in studies which remain to be undertaken in this area. It begins with an introduction to the field of musicology, moving into the realm of ethnomusicology, examining the central precepts of this field and how it attempts to read music as a form of cultural production, providing an insight into the workings of the societies from whence it stems. Next, it examines the importance of music to the scheme of Rathwa ‘ways of seeing’ and living in the world, and attempts to outline the role of this community’s women in the making of their music, their role in the writing/creating of musical patterns, and their very purpose in the community’s musical schema, by asking questions such as whether women’s ‘choirs’ or groups form a part of certain festivities or occasions, whether they work in conjunction with their men-folk, or whether there is a segregation of spheres, for example – and examining whether there are any taboos on women making/playing instruments (the corollary being that they might be relegated to the sphere of vocalising alone).\n\nThis essay is an exercise in thinking through the issues involved in putting together a new project. It will aim to set out some of the problems I am encountering as I try to formulate my research questions-the dilemmas over directions to take or avoid; the anxiety about how to interpret diverse sorts of materials; about what methods to adopt; about how to constitute my archive. My last project took me deep into the analysis of Caribbean popular music in terms of the social grids that sustain it. The book, Mobilizing India: Women, Music and Migration between India and Trinidad (2006), was followed by a documentary film called Jahaji Music (dir. Surabhi Sharma, 2007). The film engaged with the musical culture of the Caribbean through the journey and collaborations of an Indian musician, Remo Fernandes. The Remo project-which tried to pursue the possibility of connection in another sphere, that of actual musical practice-seemed to be a logical if somewhat unexpected outcome of the earlier scholarly endeavour. Perhaps the most predictable direction I could have taken next would have been to pursue the story of the Indian diaspora and its musical negotiations in the United Kingdom for example, where once again the Indian and the African come together to form different sorts of cultural equations. However, the insights I gained from thinking about music, nationalism and race in Trinidad took me in another direction altogether. The point of the comparative frame I proposed in my book was not simply to look at two different contexts, but to see how the questions I was asking could be brought back 'home' to India. What did I gain from thinking about popular music in Trinidad? That consolidation and displacement occur together and form part of a continuing process. [Here the consolidation and displacement had to do with notions of racial identity and citizenship.] That this complicated process is often manifested most visibly as cultural practice, and as music production in particular. That in our modernity-fashioned as it is through and in the wake of colonialism-thinking about the music might help us see one of the important ways by which ideas of who we are/who we want to be are put together, circulated, and gain purchase. That music is related to the structure of social aspiration and issues of social mobility. That female sexuality is central to processes of nation-making and the production of modern subjects, and that music is one such process. Thinking about these issues has brought me to my own cultural context, which is that of southern India.\n\n'Ganda Baja' is a hardly discussed topic in scholastic works of Indian folk music. It is one of the major and unique folk music traditions in western-Odisha folk culture. Presently, it is going through a phase of transition which could determine its very existence. The new generation constantly in a search to contextualize the music that would sound trendy to the present-day music market, yet it is searching scopes to reach a level in terms of music quality and to justify the core. On the other hand, the cultural elites trying to filter the music that would be conducive to proscenium, but the original music and musicians remain marginalized. With the notion of up grading music, somewhere the transition is causing a distortion to the music and rarely addressed with that gravity. However, the traditional musicians and their music have always been rooted in traditional aesthetics. This study addresses on few degenerative factors that causing a huge distortion to Ganda Baja in the process of transition. The distortions that need more scholastic attentions are (1) the changing styles of music performance practices and the platforms, (2) the music making with overridden musical assimilation, and (3) the changing connotations in the scholastic works. The Ganda Baja musicians are excluded in current cultural happenings. This study aims at bringing Ganda Baja and the musicians to limelight both in the music literature and cultural platforms. It invites scholastic attentions to way out solutions that would produce music without a distortion."
