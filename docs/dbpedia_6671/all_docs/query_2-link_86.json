        "text": "New Delhi [India], Sept 19 (ANI-NewsVoir): Nesco, India's largest exhibition center is fast becoming a hub for various social, cultural, and entertainment events. This could be seen with them organising nine days Navratri for the first time ever from September 21 to be followed by their second season of Paddy Fields, a folk and fusion music event. Talking about the Navratri festival, Singer Parthiv Gohil, who shot to fame when he was spotted by Ismail Darbar and Sanjay Leela Bhansali during a live performance and subsequently got an opportunity to work in Devdas and then debuted as a lead singer in Saawariya will be performing live at nine days Navratri festival hosted by Nesco in Goregaon this year call 'Rangilo Re'. While most of the places have a deadline of 10 pm, Gohil will be performing till extended hours at Nesco's new 80000 square feet Air-Conditioned, pillar less hall. Gohil would not only be playing the garba songs for nine days, but have prepared a special entertainment session on a daily basis which will include Sheri Garba, Mumbai style music with Nashik dhol, Bollywood, vadodara ways, classical and Punjabi dhamal, folk music, Marwadi, betha garba nagar style to entertain the garba lovers. \"Rangilo Re is certainly going to be special for me because I will be performing for all nine nights of Navratri. It will be more than just dance and music. It will be an experience for the garba lovers and myself. Each night I plan to showcase one different concept for around 30 minutes. From Vadodara na garba to kutchi dhole Sathe nu sangeet, from traditional Bollywood music to folk fusion of Maharashtra I will bring to you a variety of flavours to enjoy. So get ready to dazzle and razzle this Navratri,\" he said. Talking about the Paddy Fields event, eight women singers from various parts of the country will perform on October 7 and 8 this year. In a first of its kind, a musical event will be organized with only women performers taking centre stage in the country. The second season salutes women performers and propels folklore into the limelight. With an exclusive line-up of India's top most women folk and fusion artists it creates a platform for the talented women story tellers in our country to take center stage. As an added and exciting feature this year we will feature specially curated songs including Khasi Blues, Bhojpuri, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Meghalaya, Assam and Delhi. The list of the singers includes names like Shubha Mudgal, Kalpana Patowary, Sona Mohapatra, Nooran Sisters, Susheela Raman, Tipriti Kharbangar, Sonam Kalra and Sunita Bhuyan. The event focuses on massive revival of soul music and promises to take the genre of folk music to a new level by giving regional musicians and artists a larger platform. It also offers a heady mix of fusion giving the festival a modern-day context. \"I am really excited to perform at paddyfelds this years. Folk is mostly termed to be more played by the male and not females, so this will change the complete perspective with women performing folk music. I am really happy that a lot of importance is now given to the folk music and looking forward for the event,\" said Mumbai-based Assamese violinist Sunita Bhuyan. \"This event is a great platform for the known star singers in metro cities and folk singers to perform on the same platform. We have very talented folk singers in remote areas of the country and listening to them is a treat. I am happy that such an event is being initiated by Nesco in Mumbai,\" added Shubha Mugdal. \"With its facilities now, Nesco Center is making its foray into the consumer space and has set up Nesco Events by starting its own IPs and bringing B2C events into campus. One such effort is Rangilo Re - A Navratri Celebration and other is Paddy Fields, a Folk and Fusion music event. Supporting such cultural and musical initiatives and engaging the youth of India is one of the main focuses of Nesco Events. And in keeping with our promise of unique experiences this will be more than an evening of dance, Navratri will be a festival where we will bring alive the spirit of Gujarat. While Folk and fusion music is growing in popularity and Paddy Fields continues with its pioneering efforts in spurring this revolutionary music trend,\" said Dibakar Chatterjee, CEO of Nesco Ltd. \"One of the arms of the NESCO Group was set up with the philosophy of 'Enhancing Life' at its core. This entity is dedicated to bringing unique and exciting experiences centred around Music and Live Entertainment. With new and exciting events in the pipeline NESCO Events is set to touch lives by giving people the opportunity to create memories that last a lifetime. NESCO CENTER is poised to be the new age cultural and social hub. It's the place where events and people come together. Where international meets national, social meets cultural, business meets opportunity and music, food and entertainment meets life,\" he added. (ANI-NewsVoir)"
