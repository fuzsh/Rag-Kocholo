I'll use politics as a tool, medium and power to serve more and reach out. BJP for me is an ideology.\"\n\n\"I have not joined BJP for contesting elections as of now, but I am ready to help the party in every possible way through my art\", said the multi-lingual singer who has also lent her voice to many Bollywood films.\n\n\"Even though I join politics, my field of work will be the same - that is music and more importantly archiving our folk musical heritage\", said the singer who is popularly known as 'Bhojpuri Queen'."
