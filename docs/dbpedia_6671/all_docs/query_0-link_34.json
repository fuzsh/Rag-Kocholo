        "text": "Singer Anwesshaa said that music is a genetic gift and it can’t be instilled in a person. She was speaking during a session at the India Today Conclave East 2022 in Kolkata’s Grand Oberoi on July 5. The session, titled Eastern Euphoria: Power Voices: Walking the Untrodden Path, was also attended by Indian folk singer Kalpana Patowary.\n\nHere are excerpts from their session:\n\nadvertisement\n\nANWESSHAA STARTED LEARNING MUSIC AT AN EARLY AGE\n\nSpeaking about her musical journey, Anwesshaa spoke about how she never felt dissociated from the mode of art. “Music has been like a family member to me. I never felt like it was something alien. I was born in Maharashtra and I started training in music from the age of 4. I started my training under my Guruji Jayanta Sarkar,” she said.\n\n“Music is a genetic gift, it can’t be instilled. I always look at myself primarily as a singer. I never thought that I'd shift to composing or anything else. I discovered it along the way but I was quite skeptical about stepping on that path. Eventually, I realised my potential as I was casually humming a tune and came to understand that I too can compose songs,” she added while talking about her love for singing and composing.\n\nConclave East 2022 Full Coverage\n\nKALPANA PATOWARY ON BEING INFLUENCED BY BHUPEN HAZARIKA\n\nWhile speaking about bringing out the essence of folk music in her songs, Kalpana Patowary shared that she was highly influenced by Bhupen Hazarika. “I don’t teach anyone music because I am still learning myself. I have been highly inspired by Bhupen Hazarika ji. He was someone who gave the working class a strong voice through his music. I have sung in 32 languages and when I was exploring Bhojpuri music, I came across a great personality. Bhikhari Thakur, ek nirakshar vyakti, jab renaissance ayaa, unhone labourers ke liye gana likha. Aaj se 70 saal pehle unhone samaaj sanskar ke bare mein gaane likhe aise hi. (I have been influenced by a great personality who is popularly known as Bhikhari Thakur. Though he was illiterate, he was brilliant at composing songs that empowered the working class. This happened 70 years ago when he used to write songs about the welfare of society)\n\nANWESSHAA ON NEPOTISM AND INCREASE OF SOCIAL MEDIA’S INFLUENCE\n\nOn the much-debated issue of nepotism, Anwesshaa clarified that the music industry was not hounded by nepotism like the film industry. “I haven’t faced it personally but I have seen it many times happening around me. However, the intensity is not like what is generally seen in tinsel town,’ she said.\n\nAs for the topic of social media’s exaggeration in today’s life, she said, “The difficulty level is increasing every day. Anybody who is talented and is able, can start a channel and upload YouTube videos. But the curse is, there is a lot of substandard content. In this mixed crowd, the genuine content gets lost. Now, the people who are already established, have to compete with this new breed of stars.”"
