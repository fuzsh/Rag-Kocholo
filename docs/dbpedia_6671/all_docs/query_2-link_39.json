        "text": "Jyotishman Bordoloi\n\nIt gives immense happiness to write this blog about this week’s singer; Jyotish a close friend, a greatly talented singer, a great mind, extremely kind to others, and above all one of the promising singers representing the state of Assam and singing in both the regional language Assamese and national language Hindi.\n\nAssam the north-eastern state of India lies to the south of the great Himalayas. Land which produced singers of National fame and fine artists like the great Bhupen Hazarika, Parveen Sultana, Kalpana Patowary, Papon, and Zubeen Garg; the region is beautiful and is known for its great mountains and valleys that grow world-famous Assam Tea. In fact, Bhupen Hazarika and Jayantha Hazarika are Jyotishmans’ idols in singing. We happen to see Jyotishman just by sheer chance over a few months ago, listening to him singing a Hindi melody and ever since hooked to his channel. He sang just over 800 songs so far, but we think his singing is outstanding and needs to be encouraged.\n\nHe is our first of the cover of young singers (and we are so happy he is the first one, so deserving) in a series that starts this week to feature the most promising young singers from all over India. These singers are all with less experience yet show promising singing talent and great enthusiasm for experimenting with their voices using Smule Sing. We have a great line of singers from the states of Orissa, Jammu Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, Andra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala to be featured in the coming weeks. So please come back to the site every week to meet a new talent from your own local singers.\n\nSingers from other states who speak other regional languages not mentioned above may contact us so that we may listen to your singing and consider covering them here. Please use the Contact form here.\n\nSo the critical question is, Why do Jyotishman, and his singing need a cover here? You judge yourself by playing these videos. We asked Jyotish to bring one other male singer and a female singer from Assam that he thinks he wants to highlight here with him. He gracefully suggested his collaborator Touhid and here enjoy Jyotish and Touhid singing a beautiful Assamese hit originally sung by Zubeen Garg song Kaar Porokh.\n\nClick the link to the original song by Assamese playback singer Zubeen Garg. After hearing this you will be convinced how well these two youngsters sang this song.\n\nHere is a song in Assamese Rang Diya Morom with Jyotishs’ first pick of female singer collaborator Dimpy. Both Jyotish and Dimpy sang this as beautifully as the original but in their own ways and very experimental and we love singers do something experimental on the Smule. Sparkle!\n\nHere is the original track, beautiful; The male voice of this again is the one and only Assamese phenomenal singer Zubeen Garg, and the female singer is none other than Shreya Ghoshal. Watch the original movie scene from the Assamese movie Ramdhenu here. One may be surprised to see the Kerala backwaters in this Assamese movie song, https://youtu.be/nztD7LdCeek.\n\nJyotish singing one of the outstanding melodies made in recent Hindi movies “O Rangrez” with a prodigal young singer Mouli (Whom we will be covering in our youngster’s section from West Bengal).\n\nPapon fan Kaun Mera by Jyotish\n\nKaun Mera by Papon on MTV unplugged. You all know Papon is from Assam and came to national fame from beginnings in the great land of Assam. Everybody has to start from somewhere, right. I really hope Jyotish gets all the opportunities he deserves.\n\nLal Isque: Beautiful melody. The singer’s face used in the following video is Smule singer Mouli. The effort put in to do justice to this song throughout the song by Jyotish is commendable. Unfortunately, this collaboration of Jyotish did not get many responses from other singers.\n\nThis great singer can be followed at Jyothishmans Smule profile here please follow him here\n\nSpecial Mention\n\nHere we bring two other singers selected from Assam TOUHID AND DIMPY\n\nTOUHID\n\nOne of Touhids’ performances for all to enjoy. Awesome singing.\n\nDIMPY\n\nHere is Dimpy sings one with Touhid\n\nAye Ho meri Zindagi Dimpy with JYO\n\nEND NOTES\n\nAssam is a very under-represented state as far as its music talents are concerned. As we witnessed Smule bring many such talents to fame which is only the beginning. We hope to follow the region’s talents regularly and bring them here. Please keep doing the good work all friends from Assam. All the best. Keep your Smule profiles as beautiful as it is always. Best wishes in all your current and future music endeavors."
