Yes it’s safe there in its original form, but of no use unless we make the world hear our very soulful and meditative music. So to make it global I am trying to blend the music of my homeland with world music and other genres. This passion for traditional music, the burning sense of rhythm and grooves made singer Kalpana worked in an album together with world class India’s virtuoso percussionist and bandleader Trilok Gurtu, one of the most dynamic and prolific musicians on a new project MASSICAL released from BIRD JAM label Germany and collaborated with international unique musicians like Carlo Cantini, Jan Garbarek, Phil Drummy, Roland Cabezas, Stefano Dall’Ora.\n\nShe is deeply rooted in Nirgun, Purvi, Kajree, Pachra(devi geet), Bihu,Goalporia folk forms.
