A woman born and raised in the rich cultural state of Assam, yet she chose to follow the unconventional path to give 15 years of her life towards the promotion and greater outreach of Bhojpuri, the colloquial language of India's heartland Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\n\nShe reintroduced Bhojpuri music by popularizing some extinct traditional folk forms to the international front. Her sheer dedication to Bhojpuri music has earned her the sobriquet \"Bhojpuri Queen.\"\n\nInitially trained in Kamrupiya and Goalporiya lokgeet by her artist father, her first public performance was when she was just a 4-year-old kid. She was further trained by Dipen Roy and Shikha Dutta for Sangeet Visharad in Hindustani Classical Music under Bhatkhande Sangeet Vishwavidyalaya, Lucknow. A disciple of legendary Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan, she is also a certified AIR Guwahati artist and attains inspiration from the bard of Brahmaputra, Padma Vibhushan Dr. Bhupen Hazarika. A graduate in English literature, language, and phonetics is her forte.\n\nHer documented albums \"The Legacy of Bhikhari Thakur,\" the \"Anthology of Birha,\" extinct roots and grammar of Birha folk tradition of the Yadava cult from Uttar Pradesh, \"The Sacred Scriptures of Monikut,\" spiritual Brajavali hymns by 15th-century Bhakti Movement poets of Assam, Mahapurush Srimanta Shankardeva and Madhavdeva, \"Jimochhaya,\" explores five different community languages namely Deuri, Tiwa, Mising, Sonowal, featuring Bihu folk songs from Assam, and \"Salaam,\" an Islamic prayer praising the Prophet. Kalpana Patowary's musical work has been vast and secular in its truest form.\n\nPlucking and acquiring different folk philosophies of the human race, she mastered various folk subjects such as Purvi, Birha, Pachra, Nirgun, Kabir, Nautanki, Fagua, Kanwar Bhajan, Chhath Geet, Kajri, Sohar, Vivah Geet, Bihu, Mahout Bondhu Geet, Ghoxa, etc.\n\nShe has collaborated with some renowned artists across the globe, percussionist Trilok Gurtu from Germany, Roland Cabezas from Hamburg, Phil Drummy from Australia, Carlo Cantini, Johan Berby from France, Jan Garbarek from Norway in the album \"Massical,\" released from the BirdJam label in Germany, and with the Father of Naga Folk Blues and Tribal National Award winner Guru Ruben Mashangva in \"The Sacred Scriptures of Monikut."
