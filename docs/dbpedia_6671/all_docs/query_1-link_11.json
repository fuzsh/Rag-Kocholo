        "text": "Biography:\n\nKalpana Patowary, an acclaimed Indian playback and folk singer hailing from Assam, has left an indelible mark on the music landscape. Born into a Yogi-Nath family in Barpeta district, Assam, she began her musical journey at the age of 4 under the guidance of her folksinger father, Sri Bipin Nath Patowary. Trained in Kamrupiya and Goalporiya folk music, Kalpana also holds a Sangeet Visharad in Indian classical music from Bhatkhande Music Institute University, Lucknow.\n\nKalpana Patowary’s musical prowess extends to over 32 languages, reflecting her versatility. She became the inaugural Bhojpuri singer to bring the age-old Khadi Birha tradition to international platforms, garnering attention even from British recording company Virgin EMI Records.\n\nIn a notable career achievement, Kalpana ventured into the Chhaprahiya Purvi style, traditionally dominated by male artists, becoming the first woman to record and sing in this genre.\n\nHer contribution to the documentary film “Bidesia in Bambai” (2013), which explores Mumbai through the lens of migrant workers and their music, showcased her ability to convey powerful narratives through her art."
