        "text": "The movie “Begum jaan”, begins with a scene from New Delhi 2016 and after a few minutes, Srijit Mukherji hits the audience hard with a crude reality that questions our freedom. Are we too careless and carefree in this computerized, technologized India, standing with one leg on the past and one on the future, taking our freedom and the pain of it’s fighters and the sufferings of millions as granted? “Begum Jaan” is Srijit Mukherji’s best movie till date, with a strong inherent message, power pact performances and a thought provoking directorial approach.\n\nBegum Jaan owns a “kotha” or brothel and runs a family consisting of few girls who have suffered in this male dominated society. They came from different parts of India and Begum Jaan has created this small country inside her “kotha”, where the inhabitants have no organized religion stamped on their body. They...\n\nThe makers of Begum Jaan launched the third track ‘O Re Kaharo’ sung by Kalpana Patowary and Altamash Faridi. The music has been composed by Anu Malik and the lyrics have been penned by Kausar Munir.\n\nVishesh Films and Play Entertainment presents Begum Jaan in association with Mahesh Bhatt and Mukesh Bhatt, produced by Mukesh Bhatt, Vishesh Bhatt and Play Entertainment.\n\nWritten and directed by Srijit Mukherji, Begum Jaan will release in cinemas on 14th April 2017.\n\nStay tuned for an interview with the wonderfully talented Vidya Balan.\n\nAjay Devgn and Leena Yadav’s internationally acclaimed film Parched has come up with yet another soul-shattering number, ‘Bhookamp’. Post the raving success of their song, ‘Mai Ri Mai’, the four women saga of debauchery and resilience will thump to the beats of this new song composed by Hitesh Sonik, sung by Kalpana Patowary, Alamgir Khan, Swanand Kirkire and penned by Swanand Kirkire and music is on T-series.\n\nParched follows the lives of four ordinary women in rural India who begin to break free from the century-old patriarchal traditions. The film stars Tannishtha Chatterjee, Radhika Apte, Surveen Chawla and Adil Hussain among others. Screened at more than 20 acclaimed film festivals, Parched has had a successful release in seven countries including France, Belgium, Netherlands, USA, Mexico, Spain and Colombia.\n\nProduced by Ajay Devgn, Parched is set to release nationally on 23rd September.\n\nThe post ‘Parched’ releases ‘Bhookamp’ appeared first on BollySpice.\n\nby Jonathan Howell\n\nThe 14th of July could well go down in history, not only as the opening night of the 2016 London Indian Film Festival (Liff), but also as the day that a film festival began to change the world. It may sound like a bold claim but it’s backed up by the festival’s diverse and pioneering programme which brought a wide variety of brand new features, documentaries, and short films which challenge the firmly held stereotypes of India and South Asia.\n\nThe festival kicked off with the powerful and deeply moving Parched, directed by Leena Yadav who is another of the steadily expanding group of famous female Indian directors who are gaining recognition on the world stage.\n\nBefore the movie, the director, producer Ajay Devgn, and the stars of the film Tannishtha Chatterjee, Chandan Anand, and Lehar Khan had the full red-carpet experience. This gave the assembled...\n\nPrabhu Deva is back in the game with his second release of the year, R Rajkumar, which teams him with Shahid Kapoor, Sonakshi Sinha, and his much sought after music director Pritam. Deva had been trying to book the busy Pritam to compose for his other films, but it hadn’t worked until this album. Pritam and Shahid also teamed for his last release Phata Poster Nikla Hero, which raises expectations for this album to deliver. As expected, the songs are energetic, catchy, and fulfill that masala quota. However, it feels slightly perfunctory in producing the kuthu song, the romantic song, the item song,\n\nGandi Baat has been making waves on social media ever since its debut, with good reason, as it’s a catchy and slickly produced track. The song does resemble “Dhating Naach” with its chorus section of the dhols, and horns, but this one fares better with Mika Singh and Kalpana Patowary.\n\nWe have the first song from the Shahid Kapoor-Sonakshi Sinha starrer R…Rajkumar! Choreographed by the great Prabhu Deva, who also directs the film, it is full on cool Prabhu Deva ishtyle! Bonus is that we get to see Shahid and Prabhu Deva dancing together to the killer beat composed by Pritam. ‘Gandi Baat’ is sung by Kalpana Patowary and Mika Singh.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXHoeO9o0ZE\n\nR…Rajkumar releases in theatres on 6th December, 2013.\n\nCheck out Prabhu Deva and Shahid’s killer moves in Gandi Baat from R…Rajkumar! is a post from: BollySpice\n\nThe post Check out Prabhu Deva and Shahid’s killer moves in Gandi Baat from R…Rajkumar! appeared first on BollySpice."
