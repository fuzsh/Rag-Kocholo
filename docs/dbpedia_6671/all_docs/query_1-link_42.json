She has no direct or indirect connection to the soils of Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. Yet her fans from these states has given her the title of ‘Bhojpuri Queen’. It is not that she has consciously chosen to sing in Bhojpuri. The fact is that it is one of the music recording companies who made her to sing Bhojpuri songs. Again, the title ‘Bhojpuri Queen’ to her would give an impression that she has restricted her singing mainly to Bhojpuri songs. But it is not so. She has been in her professional music scene since 2001 rendering nearly 9000 songs in 30 different languages/dialects of India. She has also done the playback singing in Hindi, Bhojpuri, Bangla, Assamese, Tamil and Marathi films, beside acting in some films. She is a folk musicologist and has done extensive research on the history of folk music especially in the Bhojpuri region.\n\nI am referring to Kalpana Patowary (b. 27/10/1978) who has been endowed with a rich and powerful voice capable of singing in high octaves with ease. She was born in Sorbhog town in Barpeta district of Assam. Her father, Bipin Patowary, a folk singer himself and working for AIR (Aakashvani), Guwahati, gave Kalpana the initial training in Kamrupiya and Gaolporiya folk singing of Assam. She also learnt Baul singing from Naren Das. After completing her graduation in English literature from Cotton College, Guwahati, Kalpana enrolled in Bhatkhande College of Music, Lucknow from where she completed her Sangeet Visharad.\n\nEven though Kalpana Patowary has been performing on the stage since her childhood, her professional music journey started in 2001 when after marrying Pervez Khan, her school-mate and neighbour in Assam, she shifted to Mumbai. She learnt Hindustani classical music from Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan of Rampur-Sahaswan Gharana in Mumbai. The first music album recorded by Kalpana Patowary was in 2001 which was a remix of popular Hindi songs. Her first Bhojpuri song album “Na Hum Se Bhangiya Pisaai’ae Ganesh Ke Papa” released in 2002 made her very popular among the Bhojpuri speaking population. With this popularity, she sang for the first time in a Bhojpuri film, ‘Sasura Bada Paisewala’ (2004) after which she became a regular playback singer of Bhojpuri films. She expanded her command over Bhojpuri songs by singing non-film folk songs in Puria, Pachra, Kajri, Birha, Sohar, Chaita and Nautanki genres. She traveled extensively in Bhojpuri speaking regions to study the folklore of the region. She was the first woman singer to sing and record a Chhapraihiya Purvi folk style song which was hitherto a male preserve.\n\nIn June 2012, Kalpana Patowary launched her music cum documentary album ‘The Legacy of Bhikari Thakur’ which was released by a British recording company, Virgin EMI Records. It received popularity all over the world, especially from in those countries having a sizeable Bhojpuri speaking population. It was a sort of Kalpana Patowary’s tribute to Bhikari Thakur who is regarded as ‘Shakespeare of Bhojpuri literature’. In addition, she also recorded documentary musical albums like ‘The Sacred Scriptures of Monikut’ and ‘Anthology of Birha’. She is the first singer to sings a Khadi Birha folk song for Coke Studio.\n\nKalpana Patowary as a playback singer in Bhojpuri films has faced criticism from some quarters for popularising Bhojpuri film songs with raunchy lyrics. She has defended herself by saying that in the initial period of her career in Bhojpuri film music, she was not well-versed with Bhojpuri dialect and the meanings. Also, she has pointed out that it is the writers of the songs who have to take care of the raunchy wordings. Also, she says that if the song was obscene than how did the Censor Board not take objection?\n\nOne of the effects of such criticism on Kalpana Patowary seems to be that she has become more determined to study the folklore of Bhojpuri region and popularise such folk songs not only all over India but also all over the world. Hence, during the last five years or so, she has been devoting much of her time in folklores of not only the Bhojpuri region but also of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and North-Eastern States. She has also started her focus on devotional songs of these states.\n\nIt is in this background that Kalpana Patowary seems to have lapped up an opportunity by singing a devotional song “Chain Kahaan Prabhu Bin Manwa” in the film ‘Har Har Byomkesh’ (2015) which is picturised on herself. The song is written by Sutapa Basu which is set to music by Bickram Ghosh. The song in the video clip is partial as picturised in the film. The audio clip has got the full song.\n\nThe details of the film and the story have been given in my earlier article on the song – “Roothe Sajan Kaise Manaawe Ho Rama“.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nAcknowledgements: The profile and other information on Kalpana Patowary is based on her interviews which appeared in some newspapers, magazines and also on Rajya Sabha TV.
