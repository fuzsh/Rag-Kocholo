        "text": "To know moreabout Kalpana Patowary Checkout Official Blog http://singerkalpana.blogspot.com/\n\nBhojpuri Queen – Kalpana Patowary will render a specially presentation as a distinguished guest on March 22, 2012 at 100th Bihar Diwas celebration organized by the Mumbai Chapter of Bihar Foundation, a Government of Bihar Initiative to be held at Sri Sanmukkhananda Hall, Sion, Mumbai.\n\nMarch 22, 1912 marks the day when the British carved out Bihar from Bengal Presidency which then comprised Bihar, Bengal, Orissa and Assam. Making the announcement, Mumbai chapter of Bihar Foundation Hon. Chairman, Ravishankar Srivastava told media persons that the song would be composed and set to music by the singer herself.“She is famous for her musical works. We have requested her to perform her magic with a composition for this momentous occasion,” Ravishankar Srivastava said.\n\nThe celebrations of the Bihar Day will cross the boundaries of the country. The 100th foundation day of Bihar will be celebrated with gaiety and fervor in several countries where the state’s culture and cuisine will be on display with Indians, mostly Bhojpuri-speaking people, singing and dancing to the tunes of Bhojpuri lyrics and watching Bihar’s heritage and Bhojpuri films on screens.\n\nCalifornia and New Jersey in the US, Sydney in Australia, Seoul in South Korea, Qatar and Bahrain in the Gulf, besides Canada and Trinidad are the countries which will observe Bihar Day with pomp and grandeur. Ravi Verma in California and Veerendra Kumar in New Jersey, Shekhar Kishore and Amit Das in Sydney, Ghyasuddin Ahmad in Manama (Bahrain), Shakil Kakvi in Doha (Qatar) and Vibhuti Vikramaditya in Seoul are the Foundation representatives who are making preparations to arrange the gala events where the colours of Bihar will be on display. The colours of Holi, the piousness of Chhath festival, the folklores like Alha, Bidesia of Bhikhari Thakur and Vidyapati songs will be enjoyed by the people at the functions, who will also relish Bihari cuisine.\n\nThe Mumbai chapter is headed by additional excise commissioner Ravishankar Srivastava and inspector general of police Amar Kumar Pandey is chairman of the Bangalore chapter. In Kolkata, the chapter is headed by Mani Prasad and in Chennai, Shobhakant Das is making arrangements to make the event lively and memorable.\n\n“Bihar Foundation is an initiative of the government of Bihar and its motto is bonding, branding and business. The government has set up the Foundation to connect and leverage the large network of non -resident Biharis who are willing to contribute towards development of Bihar.\n\nKalpana Patowary – The Bhojpuri Queen, has brought this part of our cultural heritage the dignity and high seriousness of classical expression as a translucence added to the warmth & spontaneity of the folk world.\n\nIn 2001, with endless aspirations and immense confidence, Kalpana moved towards Mumbai the dream city of India. A disciple of Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan, Kalpana was fortunate to con music from him in order to shape her career. With her debut on Bhojpuri album “ Gawanwa Leja Rajaji ” she raised a storm which heralded the dawn of new era in the realm of Bhojpuri folk music. Released in 2003, Gawanwa Leja Rajaji strongly resonated with audiences, becoming that year’s best-selling album in India and selling more than 1 crore units nationwide to date. Kalpana broke milestones with the album which opened the Bhojpuri music industry in India. Her contribution to Bhojpuri cinema, Bhojpuri albums and devotional songs is voluminous and of very high quality. Says Kalpana, my first Bhojpuri film for which I sang was “SAIYA SE KARDA MILANWA HEY RAM” and the second was GANGA JAISAN MAI HAMAR. But the 3rd film really turned to be a milestone and once again it established an industry – yes, SASURA BADA PAISAWALA. Bhojpuri Cinema was revolutionized by Sasura Bada Paisewala. Made with a budget of Rs. 30 lakhs, the film collected a gross earning of over Rs. 25 crore. Hereafter, there was no looking back for the Bhojpuri film industry.\n\nFrom that time till now Bhojpuri film industry has evolved so much that now it has become a global industry. The best-selling female artist of all time – Kalpana has made an indelible impact on the Bhojpuri music industry and audiences everywhere. Bhojpuri folk music has been showcased and revived by Kalpana in a big way. As Kalpana says, I don’t want my folk music to be trapped in our villages. Yes it’s safe there in its original form, but of no use unless we make the world hear our very soulful and meditative music. So to make it global I am trying to blend the music of my homeland with world music and other genres. This passion for traditional music, the burning sense of rhythm and grooves made singer Kalpana worked in an album together with world class India’s virtuoso percussionist and bandleader Trilok Gurtu, one of the most dynamic and prolific musicians on a new project MASSICAL released from BIRD JAM label Germany and collaborated with international unique musicians like Carlo Cantini, Jan Garbarek, Phil Drummy, Roland Cabezas, Stefano Dall’Ora.\n\nShe is deeply rooted in Nirgun, Purvi, Kajree, Pachra(devi geet), Bihu,Goalporia folk forms. Some of these forms which have become extinct were presented by Kalpana in different stages.\n\nShe have given many a hit songs like ‘Man ke Sawaria’, ‘Dil ke Dhardkan’, ‘Balamji’, “Suna Pardes Balam”,”Rasgulla”,”Pani Bhare Gaine Rama”,etc. She has also provided the playback for multiple generations of the actresses in Bhojpuri cinema.\n\nA tribute to The Shakespear of Bhojpuri Literature – The Legacy of Bhikhari Thakur (EMI – 12012) unreleased, is bringing her applause even in distant land countries like Africa, Russia ,China, the U K and the U S A .\n\nKalpana Patowary”s popularity is as tremendous as a performing artist that for the last 6 years she has been the biggest crowd puller. During her cultural tours sponsored by I C C R (Govt. of India ) of Scotland, Mauritius, Suriname, Trinard & Tobogo, Mascut, Oman, Dubai, Australia, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, Egypt , with her subtle artistry and mellifluous voice, the Bhojpuri Queen charmed the millions of rural folk and city-bred elites alike.\n\nHer numbers in the Hindi block buster’s Anil Kapoor’s – NO PROBLEM, Ajay Devgan’s- AAKROSH, Akshay Kumar’s – KHATTA MEETHA, WELCOME, DE DANA DAN, Shah Rukh Khan’s – BILLU BARBER, ANTARDWAND & Monty Sharma’s – CHAMKU & MIRCHHhave further endeared her countless people in India and abroad.\n\nAwards and honors have come to Kalpana in plenty. She has been recognized with Bhikhari Thakur Samman in Calcutta, Swar Samragee , Bhojpuri Swar Mallika, Bhojpuri Sewa Samman, Bhojpuri Sangam Samman, Panchamrit Samman, Atkrista Gayak Samman, The Bhojpuri Queen to name a few. She was entitled with “Bhojpuri Samragee” and “Swar Kokila” for popularity contribution to folk music of Bihar by Uttar Pradesh and Bihar government.\n\n“Kalpana has enthralled music lovers with her flawless singing and even the most multiple generations of the Bhojpuri population have grown up listening to her. There are hundreds of thousands of her fans all around the world. She is the real ambassador of Bihar, a symbol of Bhojpuri music, a soft spoken, humble, cultured and virtuous person and will be remembered forever.\n\nBihar Foundation, on Bihar Diwas 2012 conveys their deep appreciation for Kalpana Patowary’s contributions to the genre of folk music of the province of Bihar and making an urbane, suave and contemporary presentation of the same to the society at large.\n\nThe timing has been right for Delhi-based Advaita. A TV spot brought them out to a mainstream audience .\n\nWith spots on TV and a formidable presence in Bollywood, the indie music scene is set to explode.\n\nHave you heard of Scribe, Something Relevant, Junkyard Groove or Shaair ‘n’ Func? These are just four of the many names in the indie scene that is fraying at its seams with talent, waiting to explode. And they are coming soon to a screen near you, a TV screen that is. Entertainment channels in India can’t ignore the indie music scene anymore and everyone wants a piece of the action.\n\nWINDS OF CHANGE\n\nStarting with Coke Studio on MTV earlier this year, a tidal wave of indie music is set to hit television, giving this underground movement a chance to break into the mainstream. The music channel also runs Roots (that plays indie music videos from south-east Asia) and is soon to start an Indian version of the iconic MTV Unplugged.\n\nOthers are also grooving to the beat. Sources say UTV Bindaas will roll out a new show later this year and has recorded 150 artists across India. Another show, that is currently gone online, also may make it to TV. That’s three new dedicated music shows in just one year. Aditya Swami, channel head at MTV India, who has been instrumental in blowing these winds of change says, “A band like Advaita have, say, 1,000 ardent fans in pockets all across India. With Coke Studio, their performance was beamed to 100 times that number. Imagine what that does for the scene.” Cynical, are we? Here’s another one: Sagar Joshi, manager of India’s only Marathi band, Moksh received a call recently that made him fall off his chair. Saam Marathi, the TV channel, called to enquire about shooting an indie gig for Independence Day. He says, “They asked me if we have enough material for an entire show.” The result was a primetime slot (7-10 pm) that\n\nhad Moksh play original compositions. That’s quite a jump considering regional language bands are relegated to playing for shoppers at malls and college gigs. The show had a phenomenal response and had a repeat telecast on August 27, in the same primetime slot.\n\nBACK IN BLACK\n\nIt’s a throwback to the early ’90s, when music channels were pitted against each other for TRPs, and the alternative music scene benefited. There was an avalanche of pop stars — from Apache Indian to Junoon. This phase soon went out of key. Uday Benegal, lead vocalist of Indus Creed has lived through both — the explosion of interest in the indie scene, and the implosion that followed. He says, “We were already quite popular in the circuit, but when Pretty Child aired on TV, it was something else. You can’t compete with that kind of visibility. Everyone who was interested in music was watching MTV at that point and they gave us shit loads of airplay.”\n\nIndus Creed was recognised as the first Indian rock band, but the truth is there were hundred others — world famous only in the community. The defining factor was that they didn’t have a slot on TV. But the honeymoon ended just when things started getting interesting. Uday explains, “There was so much interest in the alternative scene that a lot of rubbish Hindi pop music was aired. There was some good stuff such as Lucky Ali and Sunita Rao’s initial tracks, but mostly it was just bad music. That’s the reason we got frustrated and stopped playing.”\n\nROLLING STONES\n\nThis time around things are different. Bands used to be showered with plastic bottles for playing originals at live gigs a decade ago. Now, a band that doesn’t showcase originality is looked upon like a scratched CD, you can play it but only at your own peril. The quality of music the indie circuit produces is appreciated by not just the young 20 to 35-year-old crowd that goes for gigs, but even by the film industry.\n\nThe best example is the Raghu Dixit Project, which struggled for over a decade to make a mark. After one album, lots of gigging and TV spots, Raghu is now a leading music director down South, and his self-titled album has reached the number one spot on iTunes on the world music charts.\n\nThere are many others. Raina and Tapan Raj, the Delhi-based electronic music duo have been around for over a decade and are stars on the indie circuit, but Bollywood too has recognized their potential. Together with Karsh Kale, the trio composed the background score for Karthik Calling Karthik and is now the music director for the upcoming Rajeev Khandelwal starrer, Soundtrack. Other than making new music, they have also licensed music from indie bands.\n\nINDIE DEFINED\n\nVishwesh Krishnamoorthy, filmmaker and vocalist for Scribe, says: The indie scene is like the free periods you used to get in school. You did what you wanted without being dictated by the teachers, it’s not an engineered phenomenon. You’d do indie music disservice if you classified it. You can’t classify the music a Sridhar/Thayil or a Scribe or a Pink Noise makes. It’s incredible brand new music, and years ago if you found a CD of this music in a store, you would never guess it is from India. Their own tracks — Atomiser and Naina Laage — will be a part of the film; Ankur Tewari and the Ghalat Family’s Jannat will make an appearance and their long-time collaborator, Vishal Vaid’s, unreleased single will also be featured. In Shaitan, metal band Bhayanak Maut’s song Habemus Papam was licensed and singers such as Suman Sridhar from Sridhar/Thayil (Khoya Khoya Chand) and Siddharth Basrur from Goddess Gagged (Haunted 3D) have also sung for Bollywood films. The numbers keep increasing.\n\nFLYPSIDE\n\nWhile this is great for exposure, it brings up the age-old conundrum of the indie tag. The Killers became indie outcasts after receiving international recognition. Vishal Dadlani’s Pentagram got booed a decade ago because the community thought he was a sell out. So what happens once bands get mainstream recognition? Neysa Mendes, the go-to music publicist says, “I believe that it did exist many years ago, but now, Bollywood itself has evolved. It is open to a wider range of genres. Bollywood isn’t a genre; it’s a vehicle on which different genres ride on.”\n\nIN THE END\n\nBenegal, the face of the ’90s indie revolution, agrees. “There can never be a battle between Bollywood and indie music. It is an alternative to what the nation listens to. There are more bands than ever before and they are producing good music, and as they get mainstream recognition, the scene will only grow bigger.”\n\n“I congratulate the film Antardwand because such films are of great use and help for social change.” – Hon President Smt. Pratibha Patil.\n\nSinger Kalpana…..classy, sophisticated and attractive… she is the Queen of Bhojpuri music world and truly rules the hearts.She has become the favorites of music lovers with her tuneful song like “Aila re Aila” (film Khatta Meetha), ‘Ek Ooncha Lamba Kad’ (film Welcome), ‘Billu Bhayankar’(film Billu) and ‘Hotty Naughty’ (film De Dana Dan).\n\nAfter gaining prestigious position as the versatile singer of Bhojpuri films, singer Kalpana has become the favorites of music directors and is the most sought after singer in Bollywood.\n\nThis Assamese girl is the darling of the North Indian belt and has been christened the uncrowned BHOJPURI QUEEN.\n\nAs Kalpana says, ANTARDWAND is finally releasing. This film got the distinction of bagging the Award for Best Social Issues in the 55th National Filmfare Awards. My mujra song – kaate na jawani hai o more raja, in this film got great applause. This song is the soul of the film.\n\nI am so happy for the moments and proud for such recognition. It is a National Award winning film based on Groom Kidnapping.\n\nAs PEEPLI LIVE has brought the focus of Urban India to the issues faced in rural India, in an entertaining way, ANTARDWAND, too brings to light the social evil that plagues Rural India, in the mainstream media debate. Such forced marriages wreak huge emotional damage on both the girl and the boy. Kalpana says, I am more for the voiceless girl who is deeply entrenched in a male dominated feudalistic society where she has nothing else to fall back on.\n\nWhether deserted or divorced -the life of a hapless girl in such a claustrophobic society becomes a hellish and endless journey. She bears the stigma of ‘being married but not married’.\n\nIt is a story where everyone involved, pay a heavy price for the ugly patriarchal power play…it’s a society rotting while the country surges ahead to be a global power.\n\nAntardwand is a film that strokes the sensitive, thinking viewer’s ire.\n\nI am so happy for the moments and proud to be part of a film with a social issue which peeps into the reality that is mofussil India, a feudal India refusing to die.\n\nGroom abduction or “Pakrauah Shaddi” is so rampant in Bihar & Eastern UP and is touched upon in Antardwand. The film is very realistic, well made film, and more ever it’s a true story, which makes it more interesting….It brings to light that these unfortunate incidents still happen in India…True stories truly inspires me more than anything else. The true story in the film should be highlighted”…This film is getting big thumbs up from the A plus film fraternity in Bollywood.\n\nWhen her other film ‘Saanncha’ was selected for The Cannes Film Festival, it added one more feather to her cap and proved a sort of milestone in her artistic career.\n\nIn one of her recent interviews Kalpana has confessed herself in these words, “In the beginning of my career as a playback singer, I had been lending my voice to all type of songs for films and albums, but I had an appetite for art films. This is a must listen song.With time, my maturity also went on increasing, along with my ambition for singing for movies which has a message of social cause.\n\nSays Kalpana, these films has burning social problems of the society.\n\nIn yet to be released film ‘AAKROSH (Ajay Devgan) on honor killings in UP & Bihar, AAJ BHI’ & PAROKSH singer Kalpana’s voice touches the hearts and is bound to enhance her gifted flair to the peak of popularity. After her successful World Tour for the promotion of her International music album- Massical released by Bird Jam Label,Germany with Trilok Gurtu, singer Kalpana had lend her voice in the new version of the song on national integration- MILE SUR MERA TUMHARA.\n\nShe is busy now days judging SUR SANGRAM-2 in Mahua Tv with Bhojpuri super star Ravi Kishan."
