In short it will be a school, a stage, a platform, a launch pad, and a business enterprise for those who believe in the power of music.\n\nWith our modern facilities, best faculties and extensive connections within the music industry, “SaReGaMaPa Music Academy” offers music courses that develops aspiring singers and prepares them to face any test in Music Industry like Reality television auditions, playback singing or Live performance.\n\nSMA understands how the music industry works today and has created an immerse and broad learning environment for students, which connects them directly with the industry.\n\nAn apt description for “Mr. Gajendra Singh” would be a ‘trend setter’, the Creator of Musical Reality shows in India, Talent Scout extraordinaire’ and a true visionary who revolutionized the Indian Cable TV scene. He is the PIONEER of Musical reality Shows on Indian television. Few of his popular & prominent shows have been Close-Up Antakshari, SaReGaMa and the recent popular “Music ka Maha Muqabala” and “Sur Kshetra”.\n\nHe grew with Zee TV and took Indian Television to an international level.

Courageous enough to step into south market he creating benchmark shows for bouquet of channels there having won several awards and simultaneously created fiction and non-fiction shows in Bengali and other regional tv channels with path-breaking television ratings on Mahuaa TV. Mr. Singh has been instrumental in Conceptualizing, Developing and Producing a number of hit Musical reality shows and fiction based television series.\n\nHe also founded his dream Music Academy “SA Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni SA” in year 2007 which gave a platform to many aspirants of music."
