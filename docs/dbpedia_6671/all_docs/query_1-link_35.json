        "text": "HT Correspondent\n\nDIBRUGARH, Sept 2: A Bangalore based MNC senior executive Pratha Pratim Mahanta filed defamation case against singer Kalpana Patowary, her husband Parvez Khan, her mother and sisters for allegedly uploaded various defamatory video containing defamatory allegations against Partha Pratim Mahanta in social media.\n\nKalpana Patowary, since 2019 uploaded various defamatory videos containing defamatory allegations through her various social media platforms like Facebook, Whatsapp, YouTube, etc., against Partha Pratim Mahanta to demolish his reputation in public at large.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nKalpana Patwory is repeatedly doing this activity through her social media platform since September 2019 on various occasions.\n\nPartha Pratim Mahanta said, “Kalpana Patowary and her family have been keeping my minor daughter (now 10 years) since September 2019 after my wife’s unfortunate death due to a massive heart attack in Bangalore. The family has brainwashed my minor daughter for the last 3 years against me so that she can give wrong statements in court. I have already filed a kidnapping FIR in the Dispur police station against Kalpana Patowary and her family.”\n\nAccording to Mahanta both his daughter and himself are victims of a family conspiracy, inspired and led by Kalpana Patowary and her husband Parvez Khan.\n\n“It can be assumed that my minor daughter may be mentally harassed by the family members and she has been bound to follow their instructions. The family’s main intention is to detach my daughter from me, so that she can claim her share of her father’s property once she becomes mature. The mastermind behind this whole game plan is Kalpana Patowary and her husband Parvez Khan,” Mahanta stated."
