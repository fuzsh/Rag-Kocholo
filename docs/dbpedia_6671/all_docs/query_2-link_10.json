        "text": "Neither ASCPCR nor CWC can take the side of any party, we have to go by the law and see for the best interest of a child: ASCPCR\n\nSinger Kalpana Patowary has landed into a fresh controversy for a family matter. After the demise of her sister, the brother-in-law of Kalpana desires to take the responsibility of their 7-year-old daughter. But, reportedly Kalpana and her family refused to hand over the girl to him and alleged that the girl does not want to go with her father.\n\nAs per reports, few days ago a man named some Partho Mahanta submitted an application to Assam State Commission for Protection of Child Right (ASCPCR) saying that he is a resident of Guwahati working at Bangalore having a 7-year-old daughter and wife.\n\nHis wife had died of heart attack on 3rd of September. He brought the body to Guwahati for funeral and kept the child with grandparents.\n\nWhen the father wanted to go back to Bangalore along with his daughter and his mother to look after his daughter, the family members refused to hand over the girl to him by saying that the girl does not want to go with her father. Partho Mahanta wrote in the complaint that instead of handing over the girl to him they physically assaulted him. So he lodged an FIR in Dispur Police station complaining against maternal aunt's and uncles of the child including Kalpana Patowary.\n\nThe ASCPCR wrote a letter to the Police Commissioner to take necessary action to rescue the child and verbally instructed CHILDLINE to rescue her.\n\nOn the other hand, Kalpana Patowary alleged that the Chairperson of Assam State Commission for Protection of Child Right (ASCPCR) Dr Sunita Changkakoty, Rajeev Kr Jha, Technical Consultant ASCPCR and Dr Nilima Goswami of Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Kamrup (M) showed up their Cruelty to such an extent to the GIRL CHILD that she had to get admitted in Hospital. From the last 2 nights, she is in Trauma and screaming in shock! We demand strict action to be taken against these authorities who are Misusing their powers!\n\n\"When the biological father desires to take the responsibility of the child, no one can keep her which is illegal confinement. We must know that unless the biological father/mother is mentally ill, incapacitated in regards to the financial position or addicted or a convicted person, the child's responsibility is to be borne by parents. Anyone just cannot claim a child demanding that 'parents are not good and we want the child's custody.' There is a legal procedure which has to be followed.\" : said Dr Sunita Changkakoty, Chairperson of ASCPCR.\n\nThe family members of the child did not cooperate with CHILDLINE when the team went to rescue her by showing many excuses. I spoke to Kalpana Patowary that we want to listen to the child and take her statement, after taking her statement the child will be sent back with them. But they kept us waiting for several hours in spite of our summon sent to them. Then I decided to send the team of ASCPCR to their residence to take her statement: Changkakoty added.\n\nASCPCR Statement :"
