        "meta_description": "Read about Daler Mehndi career, browse top albums and songs only on JioSaavn. Punjabi pop sensation Daler Mehndi was brought up in a family of singers and musicians who have been in this profession for seven generations. Daler was influenced by music at a very young age by his parents who taught him different ragas and shabads from the GuruGranth Sahib Ji. When he was 11 years old, he ran away from home to get trained under Late Ustad Raahat Ali Khan Sahib of Gorakhpur. His main reason was to be trained not only for his vocal skills but also to learn tabla, harmonium and tanpura. In 1995, he became a superstar with his debut album â€˜Bolo Ta Ra Raâ€™ that sold over half a million copies within four months of release. It became the best-selling non-soundtrack album in Indian chart history.Mehndi demonstrates his versatile music score from â€˜Bolo Ta Ra Raâ€™ to the rocking â€˜BalleBalle&Jalwaâ€™. The unforgettableâ€˜Tunak Tunak Tunâ€™ and the electrifying â€˜Ru -Ba â€“Ruâ€™have created a permanent space in his fanâ€™s hearts.",
