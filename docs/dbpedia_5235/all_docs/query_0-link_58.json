        "text": "The objective of this chapter is to address the Aztec provinces of the Southern Highlands of Mexico, in particular a group of six provinces in the middle Balsas River basin of Guerrero: Tlachco, Tepequacuilco, Tlapan, Tlalcoc;:auhtitlan, Quiauhteopan, Yoaltepec; three provinces in the highlands of western Oaxaca: Coayxtlahuacan, Coyolapan, Tlachquiauco; and one province in the Pacific coastal plain: Cihuatlan. Together these 10 provinces were structured by 95 native states depicted as tributaries of the Aztec Empire in the Codex Mendoza. These states were composed of smaller segments or parts (parcialidades) dotting an intricate political landscape, likely comprising between 1,000 to 2,000 settlements of varying sizes that remain to be studied.\n\n-In the heart of the Altepetl- En el corazón del Altépetl : La unidad política de Tlapa-Tlachinollan a través del SIG y el análisis espacial. La Montaña de Guerrero, México. This paper is about La Montaña and the altepetl of Tlapa Tlachinollan; the former, one of the regions that constitutes the Mexican state of Guerrero, the later, a complex polity that became powerful during the Post-Classic Period (AD 1300-1500). A series of spatial and non-spatial analyses were made in order to depict and try to understand the political unit called altepetl; which literally means \"the waters, the mountains\" and is considered the main political unit (polity) in central and southern Mexico. Due to its relation with geography, it is propose that we can recreate how the altepetl used to work during these years based mainly in: 1) a series of viewsheds to identify if the visual affordances of this mountainous region affected the character of the polities. 2) building a network to explore the connectivity of each site. This way we can know to what degree did major routes of communication affect the character of the polities and 3) during these years small polities fought each other in order to control all over the waters and the mountains, so we explore a new method to define regions using cost surfaces and real archaeological areas to simulate a territory\n\nCurrent research in the Mixteca region of Mexico has revealed that Formative communities were as populous as in other Mesoamerican regions. Evidence of emerging social complexity is associated with the use of and access to luxury items of foreign style and/or manufacture. Research efforts draw from indigenous models to interpret data and investigate urbanism. Regional and environmental approaches, household studies, and ethnohistory are integrated to study ethnic diversity and the complex history of human occupation. The politics associated with cultural resource management and community archaeology in the Mixteca also are discussed."
