        "text": "In this chapter, we present a survey of word prosodic systems in the languages of Middle America (Campbell 1997: Chapter 5). Middle America includes Central America and Mexico. The term ‘Middle America’, referring to a geographical unit, is not synonymous to ‘Mesoamerica,’ which refers to a culture area ‘‘defined on the basis of common characteristics that were present during the conquest times’’ (Suárez 1983: 11). Bearing this di¤erence in mind, we here o¤er a survey of the families and isolate languages that Suárez groups within the Mesoamerican group and that Campbell (1997) considers in his chapter on ‘Middle American’ languages; this does not include the ‘West Indies’ (Antilles, Bahamas, Turks and Caico islands) or Cuba."
