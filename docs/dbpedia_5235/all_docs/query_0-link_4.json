        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe gray mouse opossum (Tlacuatzin canescens) is a poorly studied marsupial endemic to México. Phylogenetic or phylogeographic information on this species and its evolutionary history is scarce and scattered. We investigated the origin and the diversification of this taxon using molecular and morphological data. We examined mitochondrial (cytochrome-b) and nuclear (interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein) sequences to test species monophyly and assess phylogenetic relationships within the species. We also used multivariate statistical analyses of 13 craniodental variables to assess the phenotypic distinctiveness of mitochondrial haplotypic clades. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that T. canescens is a monophyletic group divided into 5 well-differentiated clades. Genetic divergence among clades was 3.1–8.9%, while the intragroup divergence was 0.5–3.7%. Our molecular clock estimates indicate that the diversification of this taxon occurred during the Pleistocene, which suggests that climatic changes and the presence of geographical barriers influenced the genetic differentiation of its populations. Morphological analyses also showed that there are cranial differences among these clades. Our results suggest the recognition of T. gaumeri, T. insularis, and T. sinaloae as valid species, and the recognition of 1 clade that we describe here as a new species.\n\nEl ratón tlacuache (Tlacuatzin canescens) es un marsupial endémico de México que ha sido escasamente estudiado. No existen trabajos sistemáticos, filogenéticos o filogeográficos enfocados en esta especie por lo que su historia evolutiva se desconoce. Por lo tanto, el propósito de esta contribución fue investigar el origen y la diversificación de este mamífero utilizando evidencia molecular y morfológica. Se examinaron dos genes, uno mitocondrial (citocromo b) y uno nuclear (interfotorreceptor retinoide), para probar la monofilia de la especie y evaluar las relaciones filogenéticas dentro de la misma. Además, se examinaron 13 variables craneales y dentales con estadística multivariada para examinar diferencias entre haplogrupos. El análisis filogenético reveló que T. canescens es un grupo monofilético que está dividido en 5 clados bien diferenciados. La distancia genética entre clados fue de 3.1–8.9%, mientras que la divergencia al interior de éstos fue de 0.5–3.7%. Nuestras estimaciones indican que la diversificación de este marsupial ocurrió durante el Pleistoceno lo que sugiere que los cambios climáticos y la presencia de barreras geográficas dentro de su distribución pudieron haber influenciado la divergencia genética de sus poblaciones. Asimismo, el análisis morfológico del cráneo mostró que existen diferencias morfométricas en el cráneo entre estos linajes. Nuestros resultados sugieren el reconocimiento de T. gaumeri, T. insularis y T. sinaloae como especies válidas y el reconocimiento de un clado que describimos aquí como una nueva especie.\n\nThe gray mouse opossum (Tlacuatzin canescens) is a marsupial endemic to México that represents a distinctive mammalian component of tropical dry forests of western México and the Península de Yucatán (Voss and Jansa 2003). Gray mouse opossums are small, ca. 20 g, and are characterized by a gray or brownish gray dorsal fur, a black mask around the eyes, and the absence of the typical marsupial pouch (Zarza et al. 2003). This taxon occurs on Tres Marías Islands off the Mexican Pacific coast and on the mainland along the Pacific lowlands from Sonora to Chiapas, and through the Balsas river basin to east México and the Península de Yucatán (Voss and Jansa 2009; González-Christen and Rodríguez 2014).\n\nAllen (1893) described T. canescens as Didelphis (Micoureus) canescens based on 6 specimens from Santo Domingo de Guzmán, Oaxaca, and later transferred it to the genus Marmosa Gray, 1821 (Allen 1897). In 1898, J. A. Allen described M. sinaloae from mouse opossums collected in the northern portion of the species range (Tatemales, Sinaloa; see Allen 1898). Merriam (1897, 1898) also named M. oaxacae and M. insularis from specimens collected near Oaxaca City and on the Tres Marías Islands, respectively. Later, Osgood (1913) collected specimens in the Península de Yucatán and described M. gaumeri. These authors emphasized differences in size and fur color among these taxa and M. canescens, and noted that skulls were very similar, showing only variation in proportions. In his systematic revision of the genus Marmosa, Tate (1933) was unable to identify the differences that Merriam (1897, 1898), Allen (1898), and Osgood (1913) reported. Therefore, he considered M. insularis, M. oaxacae, and M. sinaloae as subspecies of M. canescens, and synonymized M. gaumeri under M. c. canescens (Tate 1933).\n\nThis arrangement remained until Voss and Jansa (2003) assessed the phylogenetic relationships within the Order Didelphimorphia using molecular and morphological data, and found that M. canescens strongly diverged from the other species of the genus. As such, Voss and Jansa (2003) recognized a new genus (Tlacuatzin) for this species, although they did not document any subspecies within T. canescens and treated insularis, oaxacae, sinaloae, and gaumeri as synonyms (Voss and Jansa 2009). However, due to the geographical disjunct distribution of this marsupial in the dry forests that occur both in Yucatán and western México and the substantial morphological variation in size and color found by Wilson (1991) between mainland and Tres Marías Islands specimens, Voss and Jansa (2003) pointed out that a critical systematic revision of the genus is needed. Subsequently, Gardner (2005) recognized 2 subspecies, T. c. canescens distributed in western and south-central México and T. c. gaumeri distributed in the Península de Yucatán. On the other hand, Ceballos (2014) recognized T. c. oaxacae and T. c. sinaloae as valid taxa and synonymized gaumeri under T. c. canescens. The current taxonomy of T. canescens, which is based on morphological traits, recognizes 3 subspecies (Fig. 1): T. c. canescens along the Pacific versant and through the Balsas river basin; T. c. gaumeri from the northern part of the Península de Yucatán; and T. c. insularis from Tres Marías Islands (Ramirez-Pulido et al. 2014).\n\nPhylogenetic relationships among Tlacuatzin and closely related genera, Monodelphis and Marmosa, are unclear, although there is some support that Tlacuatzin and Marmosa are sister taxa (Voss and Jansa 2009). Jansa et al. (2014) proposed that the genus Tlacuatzin diverged from a clade that comprises Marmosa and Monodelphis ca. 17 million years ago (Ma; 13.0–21.5, 95% HPD) in South America; however, there is no fossil record to document either the presence of this taxon in South America or its migration through the Panama Isthmus. If Tlacuatzin did originate in South America, its ancestor might have reached North America by stepping-stone dispersal over the Miocene archipelago that emerged between the North and South American plates. Alternatively, Tlacuatzin may have reached North America much later in the Pliocene when the Panamanian land bridge was completely formed, as it has been suggested for other didelphid opossums (Marshall et al. 1982; Coates et al. 2004; Jansa et al. 2014). The past climatic fluctuations and the rugged topography of México might have shaped the current distribution of this species through cycles of expansion and range fragmentation (Fernández et al. 2012). Of particular interest are the populations of Tlacuatzin from the Tres Marías Islands and the Peninsula de Yucatán, which are isolated from the populations of western and central México by the presence of the Pacific Ocean and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, respectively. These geographical barriers may have promoted the isolation and genetic differentiation of Tlacuatzin populations as they have in other species (Giarla and Jansa 2014). In addition, previous reports on herpetofauna from the Tres Marías Islands and the Península de Yucatán have suggested that these populations may have originated during the Pleistocene when the sea level was low and the semiarid environments were continuous in the isthmus, respectively (Duellman 1960; Casas-Andreu 1992). Past phylogeographic studies focused on Mexican taxa have stated that the distributional boundaries of genetic clades are concordant with existing geographical barriers such as mountain ranges or rivers (e.g., Zaldivar-Riverón et al. 2004; Devitt 2006; Cortés-Rodríguez et al. 2013; Light et al. 2016). Some authors also have proposed that the climatic changes during the Pleistocene are the cause of species-level diversification in mammals and birds (e.g., Sullivan et al. 1997; Barber and Klicka 2010). Therefore, these landscape features and climatic fluctuations may have affected T. canescens, generating similar evolutionary responses.\n\nAt present, there have been no systematic studies focused on T. canescens, the status of the currently recognized subspecies is controversial, and the phylogeographic evolutionary history of this species has not been studied. Therefore, a systematic and taxonomic assessment of the gray mouse opossum is necessary. We investigated the origin and diversification of this marsupial using molecular and morphological data. We also reassess the taxonomic status of the currently recognized subspecies as well as relationships between Tlacuatzin and other didelphid genera.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nMolecular analyses\n\nSpecimens examined\n\nTissue samples from T. canescens were obtained from specimens trapped in the field under the collecting permit FAUT-0002 issued to one of us (FAC) and through loans from mammal collections (Table 1; Fig. 1). Collection abbreviations are as follows: Centro Interdisciplinario de Investigación para el Desarrollo Integral Regional, Unidad Durango (CIDIIR); Colección de Mamíferos de la Universidad Autónoma de Campeche (CMUAC); Colección Nacional de Mamíferos, Instituto de Biología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (CNMA); Colección Mastozoológica de El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Unidad San Cristóbal de las Casas (ECO-SC-M); Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biológicas (ENCB); Universidad Autónoma de Morelos, Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas (UAEM); American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH); Kansas University Natural History Museum (KU); National Museum of Natural History (USNH); Biodiversity Research and Teaching Collections at Texas A&M University (TCWC). The collection and processing of samples were undertaken following the guidelines of the American Society of Mammalogists for use of wild animals in research (Sikes et al. 2016). DNA sequences from 51 specimens were included in the analyses (Table 1). Samples included 9 frozen tissues from recently captured specimens, 5 alcohol-preserved tissues from museum specimens, 3 alcohol-preserved ear biopsies without voucher specimens, and 33 skin snips from museum specimens. In addition, we obtained 1 Tlacuatzin sample from GenBank.\n\nLaboratory procedures\n\nLaboratory procedures implemented for skin snips were performed in a separated area used for ancient DNA. To obtain skin snips, museum specimens were handled with disposable gloves, wearing a lab coat and facemask. All tools used (scissors and forceps) were cleaned in 10% hypochlorite before the procedure and between samples. In addition, prior to laboratory procedures, all materials to be used with these samples were sterilized using UV radiation to avoid possible contamination.\n\nDNA was extracted from frozen tissues and alcohol-preserved tissues following the instructions of the AxyPrep Multisource Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, California). We used the same protocol with some modifications to extract DNA from skin snips: 1) prior to DNA extractions samples were cleaned with STE (NaCl2 0.1 M, Tris 0.05 pH 7.5, EDTA 0.001 M) to hydrate and eliminate impurities (Hillis et al. 1996); 2) we incubated skin snips with STE at 56°C for 20 min up to 5 times; and 3) after the incubation step, we sliced the samples in small pieces for better digestion, which was performed overnight. All subsequent steps were implemented according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except the final elution that was made in 150 µl of water at 65°C for skin snips. DNA quality of all samples was evaluated through electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels and its concentration was measured with a spectrophotometer.\n\nTwo genes, 1 mitochondrial (cytochrome-b; Cytb) and 1 nuclear (interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein; IRBP), were amplified through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCRs were performed in a thermocycler (Maxygene Gradient Thermal Cycler; Axygen Biosciences, Union City, California) according to the following conditions: total volume of 25 µl with 1.0 unit of Taq polymerase (Qiagen, México City, México), 1× PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each dNTP (Promega, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), 0.4 mM each primer, and 50 ng of DNA. For DNA obtained from frozen and alcohol-preserved tissues extractions, amplification of the Cytb gene was performed using universal primers (MVZ05 and MVZ14) from Smith and Patton (1993), and the IRBP gene was amplified using the primers and 119A and 1312D1 reported by Jansa and Voss (2000; Table 2). For degraded skin snips, both genes were amplified using multiple primer pairs resulting in a series of overlapping 100–400 base pair (bp) fragments. The Cytb gene was amplified using the primer combinations MVZ05/MVZ06, MVZ05/MVZ04, MVZ03/MVZ10, MVZ45/MVZ26, MVZ23/MVZ16, MVZ45/MVZ16, MVZ17/MVZ14, and MVZ05/MVZ14 following Esteva et al. (2010; Table 2). Amplification of the IRBP gene was performed using the primer pairs 119A/350G, 266H/584I, 477J/878F, 461E/1090K, and 1004L/1312D1 following Jansa and Voss (2000; Table 2). For quality amplifications in degraded skin snips, the thermocycler program included 10 additional cycles. The optimal PCR conditions for Cytb gene were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 30–40 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 45 s and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min (modified from Arcangeli and Cervantes 2009). The thermocycler program for the IRBP gene was as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, followed by 30–40 cycles of 94°C for 25 s, 56 °C for 20 s, and a final extension of 70°C for 1 min (modified from Jansa and Voss 2000).\n\nPCR products were visualized with SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) through electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels and purified using the AxyPrep PCR Clean-up Kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, California) following manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was sequenced in both directions using the IB automated sequencer (ABI Prism 3 100 Genetic Analyzer; Applied Biosystems, México City, México) with primer pairs used for PCRs. Sequences were edited and aligned manually using BioEdit v7.0.9 software (Hall 1999). GenBank accession numbers for Cytb and IRBP are MG029660–MG029709 and MG029711–MG29760, respectively.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses\n\nPhylogenetic analyses were used to test species monophyly, assess phylogenetic relationships within T. canescens, and assess relationships among didelphid genera. In addition, phylogenetic constraint analyses were performed to test the monophyly of the currently recognized subspecies of T. canescens. Phylogenetic analyses included maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) as implemented in PAUP* 4.0d10 (Swofford 2003) and MrBayes v3.2.2 (Ronquist et al. 2012), respectively. The phylogenetic constraint analyses were performed using the stepping-stone sampling method of Xie et al. (2011) and competing topologies were evaluated using Bayes factors in MrBayes. Additional taxa in the analyses included 10 Marmosa and Monodelphis specimens, 20 other didelphid marsupials, and 3 non-didelphid marsupials representing the orders Paucituberculata (Caenolestes fuliginosus and Rhyncholestes raphanurus) and Microbiotheria (Dromiciops gliroides), as well as 1 placental mammal representing the order Carnivora (Canis lupus) as outgroup taxa. DNA sequences from these specimens were obtained from GenBank, with the sole exception of Marmosa mexicana, whose data were collected as part of this study following the methods above ( Appendix I).\n\nPrior to ML and BI analyses, the most appropriate model of DNA substitution and the best-partitioning scheme for each gene as determined by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were determined using PartitionFinder 1.1.1 (Lanfear et al. 2012). The combined data set was partitioned by gene and codon position and analyzed using the best-fit model for each partition in both ML and BI analyses. In addition, each gene was analyzed separately to evaluate potential conflict among gene trees and identify the phylogenetic signal of each component.\n\nML analysis was performed with starting trees obtained through 100 random stepwise additions followed by tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping. Node support was tested by bootstrap analysis with 100 pseudoreplicates (Felsenstein 1981). BI was implemented using random starting trees and four Markov chains. Two independent analyses of 10 million generations were conducted simultaneously sampling every 250 generations. Burn-in was determined by plotting log-likelihood values against number of generations. The first 1,000 trees of each run were discarded as burn-in and trees collected after that were used to construct majority-rule consensus tree and estimate nodal support as posterior probabilities. BI consensus trees were visualized with FigTree 1.4.3 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/FigTree).\n\nDistance analysis\n\nTo allow direct comparison with previous studies involving didelphid opossums (Patton et al. 1996; Giarla et al. 2010; Voss et al. 2013; Pavan et al. 2014; Voss et al. 2014), genetic divergence among Cytb sequences was estimated using MEGA 7.0.14 (Kumar et al. 2015). We computed uncorrected p-distance values for comparisons among Tlacuatzin clades and Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) distances (Kimura 1980) for comparisons among didelphid genera.\n\nDivergence dating analysis\n\nDivergence times were estimated using BEAST 1.8.3 (Drummond et al. 2012) to place our results in a biogeographic context. We used a relaxed clock with an uncorrelated lognormal distribution allowing rate variation among sites. The analyses included 1 Cytb sequence for each outgroup (other marsupial and placental taxa; Appendix I) and all Cytb sequences of T. canescens. We used a Yule tree prior and assumed an exponential distribution with mean = 10 and SD = 0.33. Chains were run for 10 million generations, sampling every 1,000 generations. The consensus tree was generated using Tree Annotator v.1.8.3 (Rambaut and Drummond 2009) after elimination of 10% of the trees as burn-in, as implemented in Tracer v.1.6. (Rambaut et al. 2014), and visualized with FigTree 1.4.3. We used 2 divergence dates from the sparse didelphid fossil record as reference for calibration, and assumed a lognormal distribution with the following means and SD of 1.0 for each: the split between Marmosa and Monodelphis at 12.1 Ma and the split between Didelphis and Philander at 3.3 Ma. Likewise, based on the fossil record we set a normal prior on the age of the basal divergence within Metatheria and the split of Theria (Metatheria and Eutheria) with minimum and maximum bounds of 54.6 and 83.5 Ma and 125 and 200 Ma, respectively (Jansa et al. 2014).\n\nMorphological analyses\n\nSpecimens examined\n\nCranial measurements were obtained from voucher specimens of T. canescens housed in mammalian collections ( Appendix II), with the aim of assessing the phenotypic distinctiveness of the 5 mitochondrial clades. Forty-seven out of the 51 specimens examined in the phylogenetic analyses were included in the morphological analyses. Four samples used in the genetic analyses do not have voucher specimens, including 3 alcohol-preserved tissues, and 1 sequence downloaded from GenBank.\n\nAge\n\nSpecimens were aged using the dental criteria suggested by Giarla et al. (2010): juvenile if the deciduous premolar three (dP3) was still in place; subadult if dP3 had been shed but premolar three (P3) was still incompletely erupted; and adult if the permanent dentition was complete.\n\nVariables\n\nMost variables reported in this study have been used in studies with other taxa of mammals such as bats (Gutiérrez and Molinari 2008), rodents (Espinoza et al. 2011), shrews (Ramírez-Pulido et al. 2004), and opossums (Rossi et al. 2010). External variables were recorded from specimen labels or field notes and include total length (TL), length of tail (LT), length of the hind food (HF), and length of ear (E). Thirteen craniodental variables (as defined by Giarla et al. 2010) were taken with a digital caliper (Mitutoyo) and recorded to the nearest 0.01 mm. Variables included: condyle basal length (CBL), nasal breadth (NB), nasal length (NL), least interorbital breadth (LIB), zygomatic breadth (ZB), palatal length (PL), palatal breadth (PB), maxillary toothrow length (MTR), length of molar (LM), length of M1–M3 (M1–M3), width of M3 (WM3), bullar width (BW), and interbullar width (IBW).\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nOntogenetic variation and sexual dimorphism within phylogenetic clades and currently recognized subspecies were evaluated through a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) followed by a Duncan test to identify significant values. Univariate statistics included computations of mean, SD, and range for each variable. All characters were log-transformed to decrease the effect of individual size variation. Principal component analyses (PCAs) were performed to assess morphological variation and identify high-variance components within the multivariate space. Discriminant function analyses (DFAs) were performed to observe data distribution within the multivariate space and test a priori identifications (molecular clades and currently recognized subspecies). Multivariate analyses were also implemented to characterize the genus Tlacuatzin and compare it with the genera Marmosa and Monodelphis ( Appendix II). All statistical analyses were performed using XLSTAT (Addinsoft, Mexico City, México) at a significance level of α < 0.05.\n\nResults\n\nMolecular analyses\n\nSequences\n\nLaboratory procedures were successful for the 50 specimens of T. canescens examined (Table 1). The genes Cytb and IRPB were amplified in a single PCR in 14 samples, while in 36 samples both genes were amplified in a series of overlapping fragments. The final length of the sequences was 1,146 bp for Cytb and 1,162 bp for IRBP in the 50 samples, including the type specimen of T. c. gaumeri (sequenced in 2013). No partial sequences were obtained.\n\nModels of evolution and partitions\n\nThe best models of evolution for Cytb and IRBP were GTR+G (Tavaré 1986) and K80+I+G (Kimura 1980), respectively. The best data-partitioning scheme for Cytb contained 3 partitions, which correspond to each codon position, with best-fitting nucleotide substitution models of SYM+G (Zharkikh 1994), HKY+G (Hasegawa et al. 1985), and TrN+G (Tamura and Nei 1993) for codon positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The best-partitioning scheme for IRBP contained 2 partitions, the first partition included positions 1 and 2 and the second partition included position 3, with best-fitting nucleotide evolution models of HKY+I and H80+G, respectively.\n\nPhylogenetic and distance analyses\n\nPhylogenetic analyses were conducted with Cytb and IRBP genes concatenated and partitioned (2,308 bp); 387 of these sites were variable and informative. In addition, we conducted these analyses for each gene individually. We included 85 terminals in the analyses, 51 correspond to T. canescens and 34 to other marsupial and placental outgroup taxa ( Appendix I). Specimens of T. canescens from the same locality were genetically identical.\n\nBayesian and ML analyses showed identical topologies, although there were differences in support values (Fig. 2). We recovered a strongly supported Tlacuatzin comprised of 5 strongly supported clades corresponding to discrete geographic areas: 1) Tres Marías Islands; 2) Northern Pacific coastal plain and the inland valley from Durango; 3) Balsas river basin; 4) Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca City and western Chiapas; and 5) Península de Yucatán (Figs. 2 and 3). Our results support a sister relationship between the Tres Marías Islands and the Northern Pacific coastal plain clades, and between the Balsas river basin clade and the Península de Yucatan and Isthmus of Tehuantepec clades, although support values for these groups are low. ML and BI analyses of the Cytb sequences showed the same tree as Fig. 2 (Supplementary Data SD1). Likewise, the separate analyses of IRBP showed little resolution and did not recover the clades seen in the analyses of Cytb (Supplementary Data SD2).\n\nThese analyses included specimens of the 3 recognized subspecies, T. c. canescens (n = 41), T. c. gaumeri (n = 2), and T. c. insularis (n = 8). We found that T. c. gaumeri and T. insularis are monophyletic while T. c. canescens is paraphyletic because it includes descendants of 3 different lineages. Topological constraint analyses supported the monophyly of T. c. gaumeri and T. c. insularis; monophyly of T. c. canescens was rejected with log differences between marginal likelihood models > 7 (a log difference above 5 is a very strong support in favor of a better model—Kass and Raftery 1995; Light et al. 2016).\n\nUncorrected p-distance values for Cytb within T. canescens varied from 0% to 8.9%, intra-clade divergences ranged from 0.5% to 3.6%, and inter-clade divergences ranged from 4.4% (between the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and Península de Yucatán clades) to 8.4% (between the Tres Marías Islands and Isthmus of Tehuantepec clades; Table 3). Our analyses also strongly supported that Tlacuatzin is sister to the clade that includes Marmosa and Monodelphis (Supplementary Data SD3). K2P distances between Tlacuatzin and Marmosa varied from 18.7% to 20.9%, and 16.2% to 20.5% between Tlacuatzin and Monodelphis.\n\nDivergence dating analysis\n\nDiversification of T. canescens into 5 clades was estimated to have begun 2.35 Ma in the early Pleistocene with the split of 2 major clades (Fig. 4). The first major clade includes Tres Marías Islands and Northern Pacific coastal plain clades (diverging 1.22 Ma), and the second major clade comprises the clades from Balsas river basin, Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and Península de Yucatán (diverging 1.86 Ma). Likewise, we estimated the end of the diversification of this marsupial at 0.19 Ma with the differentiation of the Península de Yucatán clade (Fig. 4).\n\nMorphological analyses\n\nAge\n\nAge classes for 115 specimens from T. canescens were determined following dental criteria. We classified 94 specimens as adults, 5 specimens as subadults, and 12 specimens as juveniles; 4 specimens were not classified because the skulls were broken (these specimens were excluded from the analyses). All specimens were measured and grouped according to their phylogenetic clade and currently recognized subspecies.\n\nOntogenetic variation and sexual dimorphism\n\nThe MANOVA for ontogenetic variation showed significant differences among age classes for a few variables in some clades (MANOVA analyses were not conducted on the Tres Marías Islands clade because all specimens examined were adults; Supplementary Data SD4). No significant differences among age classes were found in the Península de Yucatán clade. Morphometric differences between age classes were found in 1 (PL), 3 (NL, PL, IBM), and 1 (LIB) variable(s) for Balsas, Northern Pacific coastal plain, and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec clades, respectively. The MANOVA showed significant differences among age classes in 9 (CBL, NB, NL, LIB, ZB, PL, MTR, LM, IBM) variables for T. c. canescens, whereas no significant differences among age classes were found in T. c. gaumeri. MANOVA analyses were not conducted on T. c. insularis because all specimens examined were adults (Supplementary Data SD4). For each variable, there was a trend of increasing size with age (data available upon request). Duncan tests supported differentiation among the 3 age categories. Given these results, only adults (n = 94) were analyzed in subsequent analyses.\n\nThe MANOVA for sexual dimorphism was generally not significant (Supplementary Data SD5). Analyses were not conducted on specimens from the Península de Yucatán because all examined specimens were males. We did not find differences between males and females from Balsas river basin or the Isthmus of Tehuantepec clades. Morphometric differences between males and females were found in 3 (NL, LIB, MTR) and 7 (CBL, NB, NL, LIB, ZB, PL, MTR) variables for Northern Pacific coastal plain and Tres Marias Islands clades, respectively. Likewise, the MANOVA showed significant differences between males and females in 7 (CBL, NL, LIB, ZB, PL, MTR, LM) and 7 (CBL, NB, NL, LIB, ZB, PL, MTR) variables for T. c. canescens and T. c. insularis, respectively (Supplementary Data SD5). MANOVA analyses were not conducted on specimens of T. c. gaumeri because all examined specimens were males. In all measured variables, males tended to be larger than females (data available upon request). Given these results, adult males and females were analyzed as a single data set in subsequent analyses.\n\nUnivariate statistics\n\nUnivariate statistics including sample size, mean, SD, and range were calculated for each variable with adult specimens given the results of the MANOVA for ontogenetic variation (Supplementary Data SD6).\n\nMultivariate analyses among phylogenetic clades\n\nThese analyses were conducted with 91 specimens, which represented the 5 phylogenetic clades: Tres Marías Islands clade (n = 8), Northern Pacific coastal plain clade (n = 38), Balsas river basin clade (n = 21), Isthmus of Tehuantepec clade (n = 22), and Península de Yucatán clade (n = 2). A PCA revealed that the principal components 1 and 2 explained 71.9% of the variation of the data (PC1 = 57.6% and PC2 = 14.3%; Table 4). PC1 was interpreted as a size component, whereas PC2 was interpreted as a form component. PC1 was correlated with all variables, while PC2 was correlated with molar length (ML, M1–M3, and WM3). Sample dispersion along the 2 axes did not reveal morphological differences among Tlacuatzin clades but showed an increase in variable dimensions along the 2 axes (Fig. 5a). The PCA also revealed that the specimens from the Northern Pacific coastal plain clade are the smallest individuals, whereas the specimens from the other 4 clades tended to be larger.\n\nThe first discriminant function (DF) of the DFA accounted for over 57.8% of the explained variance (Table 5), which was greatly influenced by ZB, IBW, and LM, while the second function was heavily weighted by CBL and represented 23% of the variation of the data. A plot of the 2 canonical axes revealed that all examined specimens formed 1 group. We distinguished 4 overlapped subgroups that are consistent with the clades from the Northern Pacific coastal plain, the Balsas river basin, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and the Tres Marías Islands (Fig. 5b). The specimens from the Península of Yucatán were nested within the range of morphological variation observed in the Northern Pacific coastal plain clade. The classification function allocated 93.0% of specimens into their a priori group.\n\nMultivariate analyses among recognized Tlacuatzin subspecies\n\nThe 91 specimens examined for these analyses represented all 3 subspecies, T. c. canescens (n = 81), T. c. gaumeri (n = 2), and T. c. insularis (n = 8). The first 2 components (PC1 = 60.3% and PC2 = 11.2%; Table 4) explained 71.5% of the variation of the data (Fig. 6a). PC1 was interpreted as a size component and correlated with all variables, whereas PC2 was interpreted as a form component and correlated with the molar form (ML, M1–M3, and WM3; Table 4). Sample dispersion along the 2 axes did not reveal morphological differences among Tlacuatzin subspecies but showed an increase in variable dimensions along the 2 axes (Fig. 6a).\n\nThe plot of the 2 canonical axes revealed that the examined specimens formed 2 groups (Fig. 6b). The first group includes the specimens of T. c. canescens and T. c. insularis, while the second group contains the 2 specimens of T. c. gaumeri (Fig. 6b). The first function represented 67.1% of the variance and was greatly influenced by MTR, whereas the second function represent 32.9% of the variance and was weighted by PL (Table 5). The classification function allocated 94.6% of specimens into their a priori group.\n\nIntergeneric analyses\n\nWe determined the age class of 34 specimens of Marmosa and 24 specimens of Monodelphis. We classified 29 specimens of Marmosa as adults, 4 specimens as subadults, and 1 specimen as juvenile; 20 specimens of Monodelphis were classified as adults and 4 specimens as juveniles. The MANOVA for ontogenetic variation revealed significant differences among age classes for both Marmosa and Monodelphis, while the MANOVA for sexual dimorphism did not show significant differences between males and females in either Marmosa or Monodelphis (Supplementary Data SD7). Given these results, only adult specimens were analyzed in subsequent analyses. Multivariate analyses among genera included 91 specimens of Tlacuatzin, 29 of Marmosa, and 20 of Monodelphis ( Appendix II).\n\nPC1 and PC2 explained 77.5% of the variation of the data (PC1 = 65.1% and PC2 = 12.4%; Fig. 7a). PC1 was correlated with all variables, while PC2 was correlated with molar length (ML, M1–M3, and WM3; Table 4). PC1 was interpreted as a size component and PC2 as a form component. Sample dispersion along the 2 axes indicated morphological differences among the 3 genera. We observed a remarkable separation between Monodelphis and the 2 mouse opossums, Tlacuatzin and Marmosa, with some overlap between the latter 2 taxa (Fig. 7a). These results showed that Monodelphis is the largest taxon while Marmosa and Tlacuatzin are smaller and similar in size and form to each other.\n\nA plot of the 2 canonical axes revealed that all examined specimens formed 3 well-defined groups (Fig. 7b). The first function represented 55.8% of the variance and was heavily weighed by ZB, M1–M3, and WM3, whereas the second function was greatly influenced by LIB and CBL and accounted for over 44.2% of the variance (Table 5; Fig. 7b). The classification function allocated 98.2% of the specimens into their a priori genus.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPhylogenetic and morphological analyses\n\nOur phylogenetic analyses revealed a genetic subdivision that is not concordant with currently recognized subspecies: T. c. canescens from along the Pacific versant and through the Balsas river basin, T. c. gaumeri from the northern part of the Península de Yucatán, and T. c. insularis from the Tres Marías Islands (Ramírez-Pulido et al. 2014). Instead, ML and BI analyses recovered a strongly supported monophyletic group divided into 5 genetically well-differentiated clades over the distributional range of Tlacuatzin. The first clade contains all the haplotypes from Tres Marías Islands. The second clade contains haplotypes from the Northern Pacific coastal plain and 1 haplotype from the inland valley from Durango. The third clade includes the haplotypes from the Balsas river basin. The fourth clade clusters the haplotypes from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca City, and western Chiapas. The fifth clade contains the haplotypes from the Península de Yucatán. This phylogenetic arrangement is not similar to any previous taxonomic classification but it is close to those suggested by Tate (1933) and Ceballos (2014), where sinaloae, oaxacae, and insularis are regarded as subspecies of T. canescens and gaumeri is synonymized under T. c. canescens.\n\nThis phylogenetic pattern is consistent with the vicariant allopatric divergence-speciation model since the distributional boundaries of clades are concordant with existing geographical barriers (Fig. 3; Devitt 2006). The clade from Tres Marías Islands is restricted to a continental archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Nayarit (Casas-Andreu 1992). The clade from the Northern Pacific coastal plain is limited to the east by the Sierra Madre Occidental and to the south by the Transvolcanic Belt and the Sierra Madre del Sur (Espinosa et al. 2008; Ortega et al. 2009). The clade from the Balsas river basin is flanked by the 2 mountain ranges cited above (Zaldivar-Riverón et al. 2004; Sotuyo 2007). The clade from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is bordered by the Sierra Mixe to the west and the Sierra Madre de Chiapas to the east (Cortés-Rodríguez et al. 2013). The clade from the Península de Yucatán is restricted to the tropical dry forest that occurs to the north of this Peninsula (Duno-de Stefano et al. 2012). Therefore, these findings support the results of Giarla and Jansa (2014) who demonstrated that geographical barriers promote the isolation and genetic differentiation of a recent radiation of Neotropical marsupials in South America.\n\nOur results are similar to those reported for other Mexican small mammals. For instance, Light et al. (2016) found that populations of the pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori) were structured in 2 haplogroups segregated by the Transvolcanic Belt; while Ortega et al. (2009) documented that banana bat (Musonycteris harrisoni) populations are divided into 2 haplogroups separated by the Sierra Madre de Sur. High intraspecific genetic variation was also found in populations of the Verapaz shrew (Sorex veraepacis) from both sides of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (Esteva et al. 2010). Similarly, Sullivan et al. (1997) and León-Paniagua et al. (2007) found that the major mountain ranges of México drove the isolation and genetic diversification of the Peromyscus aztecus species group and the mouse genus Habromys, respectively. Those authors pointed out that the Isthmus of Tehuantepec represent a strong biogeographic barrier for small mammals. In addition, some amphibians (Zaldivar-Riverón et al. 2004), reptiles (Devitt 2006; Zarza et al. 2008), and birds (González et al. 2011; Cortés-Rodríguez et al. 2013) display similar biogeographical patterns over their distributional ranges. For example, the populations of the western lyresnake (Trimorphodon biscutatus) are structured in 5 well-differentiated clades, which are consistent with the subspecies they belong to and whose boundaries are concordant with existing geographical barriers such as the Transvolcanic Belt, the Gulf of California, and Guatemala highlands (Devitt 2006).\n\nGenetic divergence values of the Cytb gene among clades also indicated that these clades are well differentiated. Comparisons among clades revealed an inter-clade divergence averaging from 4.4% and 8.4% (Table 3). These values are similar to those reported in other didelphids such as Monodelphis domestica (4.8%—Pavan et al. 2014), Tylamys pallidior (5%—Giarla et al. 2010), and M. mexicana (6.6%—Voss et al. 2014). In contrast, intragroup values are low, means ranging from 0.5% to 3.6% (Table 3). These values are similar to those found among conspecific individuals of other didelphids such as Marmosops pakaraimae (0.1%—Voss et al. 2013) and Tylamys sponsorius (1.8%—Giarla et al. 2010). High inter-group genetic divergence, between 2% and 11%, had a high probability of being indicative of valid species and merit additional study concerning specific status (Bradley and Baker 2001). Therefore, the inter-clade p-distances we recorded suggest that T. canescens as currently recognized may include several taxa.\n\nThe PCA for molecular clades did not form clusters but show that the specimens from the Northern Pacific coastal plain clade display the smallest dimensions, which is consistent with previous reports (Fig. 5a; Allen 1898; Tate 1933). In contrast, the DFA showed that the specimens are clustered in 4 overlapped groups. These clusters are consistent with the clades from Tres Marías Islands, the Northern Pacific coastal plain, the Balsas river basin, and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (Fig. 5b). Specimens belonging to the Península de Yucatán clade are located in the area where the ellipses from the Northern Pacific coastal plain and Balsas river basin clades overlap. The DFA also showed the clusters from Tres Marías Islands and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec are the most differentiated. Likewise, 93% of the specimens were correctly assigned to their own molecular clade indicating that there are morphometric differences among these.\n\nThe PCA for currently recognized subspecies did not form clusters either. In contrast, the DFA revealed that the ellipses of T. c. canescens and T. c. insularis are overlapped, while the 2 specimens of T. c. gaumeri are well differentiated from each other (Figs. 6a and 6b). This result supports previous classifications where T. c. gaumeri is recognized as a valid subspecies (Gardner 2005; Ramirez-Pulido et al. 2014) and not as a synonym for T. c. canescens as considered by Tate (1933) and Ceballos (2014). Likewise, the fact that 100% of the specimens were correctly assigned to their a priori group indicates that the currently recognized subspecies are well differentiated morphologically. However, this result differs from that obtained in the phylogenetic analyses in which the subspecies T. c. canescens is paraphyletic and included 3 different clades (the Balsas river basin clade, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec clade, and the Península de Yucatán clade). Therefore, given that the current taxonomic arrangement does not reflect phylogenetic relationships among molecular clades of this marsupial, this classification should not be valid.\n\nHistorical biogeographical inferences\n\nOur results suggest that the genus Tlacuatzin was present in the Pleistocene, which is consistent with the fossil record of this species (Tate 1933; Álvarez and Arroyo-Cabrales 1990; Zarza et al. 2003). Therefore, the climatic fluctuations that occurred during the Pleistocene may have affected T. canescens, shaping its geographical distribution through cycles of expansion (during the glacial periods) and range contraction (during the interglacial periods—Fernández et al. 2012). Similarly, the diversification of Tlacuatzin could be the result of spatial and temporal fragmentation of their populations during interglacial periods, which promoted their isolation and genetic divergence as has been proposed for some mammals and birds (e.g., Sullivan et al. 1997; Barber and Klicka 2010).\n\nIn addition, geographical barriers such as mountain ranges and rivers could also play an important role as effective reproductive barriers, interrupting gene flow among their populations (Fig. 4; Giarla and Jansa 2014). Our results confirmed that the geographical barriers within the distribution of Tlacuatzin were present when this mouse opossum started to diverge. The Sierra Madre Occidental was formed in the Oligocene and early Miocene, promoting the establishment of the tropical dry forest in western and central México (Ortega et al. 2009). The Transvolcanic Belt started its formation in the late Miocene, finishing in the Pliocene (Zaldivar-Riverón et al. 2004); while the Sierra Madre del Sur was formed during the late Mesozoic (Cretaceous—Sotuyo 2007). The Isthmus of Tehuantepec was formed from the late Miocene to the end of the Pleistocene (González et al. 2011), while Tres Marías Islands were separated from the continent during the late Miocene (Casas-Andreu 1992). Therefore, these geographical barriers promoted the isolation of Tlacuatzin populations during the interglacial periods, driving the differentiation of this genus into 5 phylogenetic clades.\n\nIt is difficult to determinate when Tlacuatzin arrived in México from South America since there is no fossil record to document the presence of this taxon in South America nor its migration through the Panama Isthmus. However, Jansa et al. (2014) suggested that the ancestor of Tlacuatzin arose 17 Ma. Our results suggest that after Tlacuatzin arrived in Mexico, this mouse opossum extended its distribution along the Pacific coast until it arrived at its northern range. Tlacuatzin might have reached Tres Marías Islands by using a terrestrial bridge during a glacial period when the sea level was low, as has been suggested for some amphibians and reptiles that inhabit those islands (Casas-Andreu 1992). Similarly, Tlacuatzin might have arrived in the Península of Yucatán across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec during a glacial period when the lowlands of the isthmus were more extensive due to lower sea level and the semiarid environments were continuous from the Pacific lowlands to the Gulf of México lowlands, as has been proposed for other taxa that inhabit lowlands on both sides of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (Supplementary Data SD8; Duellman 1960).\n\nTaxonomic implications\n\nOur phylogenetic analyses revealed 2 major clades within Tlacuatzin (Fig. 2). The first major clade (A) supports a sister relationship between Tres Marías Islands and the Northern Pacific coastal plain clades, while the second major clade (B) shown a sister relationship between the Balsas river basin clade and the Península de Yucatan and Isthmus of Tehuantepec clades, although support values for these groups are low. This hypothesis suggests that Tlacuatzin might include 2 different taxa. However, the genetic distances within these 2 major clades are high (0.0–6.2% within clade A and 0.0–8.0 within clade B), similar to those expected between different species (Bradley and Baker 2001). In addition, p-distances between the clades belonging to each major clade are also high (Table 3), which suggests that each major clade may include several taxa. On the other hand, morphological evidence indicates that the 5 clades are differentiated from each other (Fig. 5b), particularly the Tres Marías Islands clade is considerably distinct from the Northern Pacific coastal plain clade. Therefore, our data support that the 2 major clades of Tlacuatzin may include several taxa.\n\nThe clades from Tres Marías Islands, the Northern Pacific coastal plain, and the Península de Yucatán were originally described as M. insularis (Merriam 1898), M. gaumeri (Osgood 1913), and M. sinaloae (Allen 1898), respectively. However, Tate (1933) was unable to identify the differences in size and color that those authors reported among these taxa and M. canescens. Therefore, he considered M. insularis and M. sinaloae subspecies of M. canescens, and synonymized M. gaumeri under M. c. canescens (Tate 1933). The current taxonomy of T. canescens, which is based on morphological traits, recognizes 3 subspecies: T. c. canescens from along the Pacific versant and through the Balsas river basin; T. c. gaumeri from the northern part of the Península de Yucatán; and T. c. insularis from Tres Marías Islands (Ramirez-Pulido et al. 2014).\n\nBased on our morphological analyses we state that T. c. canescens, T. c. gaumeri, and T. insularis are somewhat differentiated from each other (Fig. 6b). Regarding the phylogenetic analyses, we find that T. c. gaumeri is consistent with the geographical distribution of the Península de Yucatán clade, while T. c. insularis is consistent with the area occupied by Tres Marías Islands clade. In contrast, our molecular analyses reveal that T. c. canescens as currently recognized includes 3 different phylogenetic clades, of which 2 are consistent with previously described taxa. The Northern Pacific coastal plain clade is consistent with the range of sinaloae, a synonym of canescens used to describe the populations along the Pacific versant from Sonora to Colima, while the Isthmus of Tehuantepec clade is consistent with the area occupied by T. c. canescens in Oaxaca and Chiapas. The Balsas river basin clade is not consistent with any previously described taxon.\n\nAccording to our analyses, the 5 clades that comprise T. canescens are genetically and morphologically well differentiated. Genetic divergence among these clades is high (4–9%), while intra-clades divergence values are low (0.5–3.6%). In addition, we found strong morphological differences in ZB, IBM, and LM that can help diagnose the clades. Furthermore, the DFA suggests that the Tres Marías Islands clade is considerably distinct from the Northern Pacific coastal plain clade (Fig. 5b), which supports the conclusions of Merriam (1898) and Wilson (1991) who stated that island populations differed sufficiently from the mainland populations to warrant species recognition. Similarly, our analyses show that the Península de Yucatán clade is well differentiated from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec clade (Fig. 5b) which differs from the observations made by Tate (1933) who did not find differences among specimens from these regions. Moreover, the Cytb evidence suggests that the 5 clades that conform Tlacuatzin have been genetically and geographically isolated for approximately 2 Ma. We believe that the sum total evidence suggests that these clades may represent different taxa. Therefore, we propose the recognition of T. gaumeri (Península de Yucatán clade), T. insularis (Tres Marías Islands clade), and T. sinaloae (Northern Pacific coastal plain clade) as valid taxa and restrict T. canescens to Oaxaca and Chiapas (Isthmus of Tehuantepec clade).\n\nOur results also suggest that the clade from the Balsas river basin represents an additional and unnamed taxon. We found this clade is highly genetically divergent (above 5%) from the other 4. Morphologically, it is similar to the other clades, with some differentiation (Fig. 5b). This result is similar to those found in the other species of Tlacuatzin documented in this study, which differ each other genetically and morphologically. We recognize the Balsas river basin clade as an undescribed taxon.\n\nDifferences among genera\n\nK2P distances we recorded between Tlacuatzin and other genera were much greater than those registered among Tlacuatzin clades: 18.7–20.9% between Tlacuatzin and Marmosa, and 16.2–20.5% between Tlacuatzin and Monodelphis. Our results are consistent with those found by Patton et al. (1996), which recorded an extensive range of intergeneric divergence among didelphids, ranging from 13.7% to 52.7%. Regarding the phylogenetic relationships among these genera, our results suggest that Tlacuatzin is sister to the clade that includes Marmosa and Monodelphis, which is similar to 1 of the 3 hypotheses proposed by Voss and Jansa (2009; Supplementary Data SD3).\n\nThe multivariate analyses for Tlacuatzin, Marmosa, and Monodelphis indicated that there are significant differences among the 3 genera (Figs. 7a and 7b). Tlacuatzin and Marmosa are similar in size and form, which explains why Tlacuatzin was previously included within the genus Marmosa (Tate 1933; Voss and Jansa 2003). However, our results suggest that these 2 mouse opossums are well differentiated with Tlacuatzin significantly smaller than Marmosa, and therefore the smallest didelphid distributed in México (Zarza et al. 2003). The fact that our research included Tlacuatzin specimens from its entire distribution and representatives of Marmosa and Monodelphis from Mexico and South America may help understand better the evolutionary history of the gray mouse opossum.\n\nIn conclusion, our genetic and morphological data support Tlacuatzin monophyly and suggest this taxon is formed by 5 well-differentiated phylogenetic clades. According to expectations, the diversification of this taxon occurred during the Pleistocene in response to climatic changes and the presence of geographical barriers, which promoted the isolation and genetic differentiation of its populations. We propose changes in the current taxonomy of the genus Tlacuatzin, which include the recognition of T. gaumeri, T. insularis, and T. sinaloae as valid species and the recognition of 1 taxon that is not consistent with any other previously described. Likewise, both morphological and molecular evidence presented here support that the genus Tlacuatzin is well differentiated from its relatives, Marmosa and Monodelphis.\n\nSpecies Account\n\nTlacuatzin canescens (Allen, 1893)\n\nGray mouse opossum\n\nDidelphis (Micoureus) canescensAllen, 1893:235.

This species co-occurs with other taxa restricted to the Balsas river basin such as the scrub Caesalpinia oyamae (Sotuyo and Lewis 2007), the scorpion Centruroides balsasensis (Ponce and Francke 2004), and the iguana Ctenosauria clarki (Pérez and Saldaña 2002). The conservation status of this marsupial is unknown; however, it may be a threatened species since it occurs in the tropical dry forest, an ecosystem highly fragmented and disturbed in México (Meave et al. 2012).\n\nNomenclatural statement\n\nA life science identifier (LSID) number was obtained for the new species Tlacuatzin balsasensis: urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:9634C86D-BE27-43D7-82E7- D571E569537B.\n\nSupplementary Data\n\nSupplementary data are available at Journal of Mammalogy online.\n\nSupplementary Data SD1.—Bayesian phylogram of the phylogenetic relationships among didelphids and within the gray mouse opossum (Tlacuatzin canescens) based on a partitioned analysis of the cytochrome-b gene.
