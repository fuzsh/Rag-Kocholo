My closest collaborator was Professor Ricardo Ambrosio, who nurtured me as his dilla walhall student in Lachirioag. Several extraordinary bene zaa intellectuals supported my endeavors, and chief among them were the late anthropologist Víctor de la Cruz and the late bene wenllin che yia yegu doña Aurelia Cano, and thus this book is dedicated to their memory, and to Professor Ambrosio’s extraordinary work in Lachirioag. Other bene zaa scholars whose support was invaluable include the ritual specialists don Moisés González and doña Aurora Ramírez; the community leader Odilia Romero; the writer Javier Castellanos; the poet Pergentino Cruz; the educator Filemón Beltrán; and the late linguist Emiliano Cruz Santiago. The late eminent linguist Thomas Smith-Stark graciously provided advice and guidance for many years. Javier Urcid amicably nourished this project and provided valuable illustrations. John Justeson was a selﬂess and erudite collaborator; Susan Schroeder contributed unwavering support; Alfredo López Austin provided timely advice; and María de los Ángeles Romero Frizzi, Manuel Esparza, and Juana Vásquez Vásquez shared their extensive knowledge. I am also grateful for the hospitable reception at Betaza, San Francisco Caxonos, Lachirioag, Solaga, Yaa, Yalahui, Yalalag, Yatee, and Zoogocho. I am greatly indebted to Kevin Terraciano and Lisa Sousa for their encouragement and invitations to present my work; to the late Ana Díaz Álvarez, for her unfailingly brilliant perspectives on codices; to Bill Taylor, for his steadfast support; to John Chuchiak, for various research suggestions; and to Marina Garone and Erika Loic, for their assistance regarding early modern hands and print types. I warmly thank Michael Galant for his comments on chapter 3; Daniel Suslak, for his help with chapter 6; Viola König, for providing a photograph of the Lienzo de San Juan Comaltepec; and an anonymous reviewer, for making sagacious suggestions. I am also grateful to Solange Alberro, Davíd Carrasco, Roger Chartier, the late Paul Friedrich, the late Miguel León-Portilla, Rosemary Joyce, the late Marshall Sahlins, and Carlo Severi for their amiable advice. Joe Campbell, Brook Lillehaugen, and Pam Munro made several useful suggestions regard-\n\nacknowled gment s\n\ning linguistic analyses; Andrew Laird contributed information about Latin grammars; and Javier Rendón Sandoval and Eduardo Ruiz-Sánchez provided advice on plant morphology, and photographs. I also received helpful feedback from Víctor Cata, John K. Chance, Oswaldo Chinchilla, Bill Connell, Danièle Dehouve, Bas van Doesburg, Jonathan Truitt, Gaby Vail, Joseph Whitecotton, and Judith Zeitlin, and cordial assistance from Luis Arrioja, Margaret Bender, Ned Blackhawk, Aaron Broadwell, Jesús Bustamante, Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra, Francisco José Cervantes, Susan Kellogg, Gerardo Lara Cisneros, Alessandro Lupo, Diana Magaloni, Susan Milbrath, Guilhem Olivier, Ethelia Ruiz Medrano, Carlos Sánchez Silva, Fritz Schwaller, Stuart Schwartz, Marc Sicoli, Aaron Sonnenschein, Michael Swanton, and Daniela Traﬀano. Before 2016, when I ceased contact with Michel Oudijk due to professional and legal issues, we shared with each other unpublished materials; all insights derived from these exchanges and other publications are acknowledged. Elizabeth Boone, Kris Lane, and Camilla Townsend kindly wrote letters in support of this project. Idelette Domínguez Vásquez and Óscar Falcón Martín retook high-quality photographs of documents, and Ligia Quiroz Bermúdez, Laura Carolina Vásquez, and Teresa Rojas Rabiela helped with some inquiries. I am, of course, responsible for all errors or omissions in this work. I acknowledge the amiable support of Antonio Sánchez de Mora and his colleagues at the Archivo General de Indias; Israel Garrido at the Archivo Histórico del Poder Judicial de Oaxaca; Father Antonio Villalobos at the Archivo Parroquial de Villa Alta; Norman Fiering and Neil Saﬁer at the John Carter Brown Library; John O’Neill at the Hispanic Society of America; Regina Tapia Chávez, director of the Archivo General Agrario; and the personnel at Archivo Histórico del Arzobispado de Oaxaca, Archivo General de la Nación, Archivo Parroquial de La Merced in Oaxaca, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Museo Nacional de Antropología, and the Newberry Library. My research and writing was funded by a 2017–2018 award from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation; a National Endowment for the Humanities grant held at the John Carter Brown Library; and by assistance from the Lucy Maynard Salmon Fund and the Elinor Nims Brink Fund at Vassar College, which also covered indexing and permission costs. Several esteemed colleagues hosted presentations of work in progress: Louise Burkhart, University at Albany; Sergio Navarrete and Manuel Ríos Morales, CIESAS-Pacíﬁco Sur; Gunlög Fur, Linnaeus University; Frank Salomon, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Maarten Jansen, Leiden University; Kelly McDonough, University of Texas, Austin; and Kittiya Lee, California State University, Los Angeles. Earlier work on the project was presented at various meetings of the American Historical Association; chapters 3 and 5 were presented at the 2007 and 2011 American Society for Ethnohistory\n\nxvi\n\nacknowled gment s\n\nmeetings; and chapter 2 was delivered at the 2018 Northeastern Nahua Scholars Conference. Early versions of my analysis of Borgia group codices and Zapotec manuals in chapters 4 and 5 were presented at a 2014 conference and a 2015 seminar generously organized at the Instituto de Investigaciones Históricas at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México by Federico Navarrete and Ana Díaz, and at a 2018 seminar graciously hosted by Davide Domenici at the University of Bologna. Chapter 6 was presented at the Los Angeles Frente Indígena de Organizaciones de Base in 2017, and at the 2019 meetings of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association, and the American Anthropological Association. I express my gratitude to the organizers of these events, to their students, and to audience members for their feedback. At Vassar, I received congenial support from my Anthropology Department and Latin American and Latinx Studies Program colleagues, and from my research assistants Elise Stickles, the late Ariana Salguero, and Ariana Sierra- Chacón. I thank Neil Curri for drafting the Villa Alta map, and Nicole Scalessa and Baynard Bailey for their devoted work on a companion web site. At the University of Texas Press, my editor, Kerry Webb, and Andrew Hnatow gently steered the journey from proposal to publication, and Lynne Ferguson and Kerri Sullivan made judicious edits. At home, my work was sustained daily in myriad ways by the love of my wife, Elisabeth; my daughter, Eva; my parents, David and Estela; and my brother, Arturo, and his family: Chizuru, Erika, Vero, Irving, and David Aleksei.\n\nxvii\n\nrethinking zapotec time\n\nchap ter one\n\nIntroduction\n\narly on september 17, 1718, Sebastián de Aziburu Arichaga, alcalde mayor, or governor, of the Villa Alta province in Oaxaca, New Spain, was notiﬁed that the people of Lachitaa (see map) had relapsed into ancient devotions and were preparing tepache, “fruit alcohol,” for a feast,1 even though, only fourteen years earlier, fray Ángel Maldonado, bishop of Oaxaca, had gathered Zapotec calendrical manuals and songs, along with collective confessions, from the 104 Indigenous towns in Villa Alta in exchange for a general amnesty from the crime of idolatry—understood in Zapotec through the thunderous neologism the Dominican Pedro de Feria coined in his 1567 Doctrina, quela huecete bitoo quiela yagala, “the teachings of stone and wood deities.”2 This volume provides the ﬁrst analysis of the entire contents of this exceptional collection of manuals and songbooks, which were surrendered to Maldonado by thirtyseven Northern Zapotec communities in 1704 and 1705, forwarded to Spain, and eventually preserved at the Archivo General de Indias (AGI) as legajo, or archival unit, México 882. The means by which this news had reached the magistrate revealed a profound rift in Northern Zapotec communities—highly autonomous territorial,\n\nE\n\nre thinking z ap otec time\n\nresidential, and religious units known as queche, yeche, and yetze. The celebrations at Lachitaa were anything but mystical. They entailed obligations that divided Zapotecs along gender and political lines, mobilized their households, and aﬀected their domestic budgets—a local politics of universal realms. In cosmological terms, September 17, 1718, was lala, 11-Night, or Day 63 in the biyee, the 260-day divinatory count that had been consulted by ritual specialists for the previous 2,300 years.3 September 17 was also the eleventh day of the eleventh period in the yza, the pre-Columbian Zapotec 365-day year. This eleventh period, called Gaha (Fruit), matched the feast of Xocotlhuetzi (Fruit Falls) in the Nahua year. 11-Night was an auspicious date in the divinatory cycle, as several Zapotec daykeepers designated it as a feast when saa titza tzahui, “the good words go.” 4 Moreover, this celebration was only two days from the end of the ﬁrst of four 65-day periods (cocijo or cocii) in the 260-feast count. Mesoamerican communities had similarly structured versions of that count before the Spanish conquest, but its quotidian use had vanished or been curtailed throughout Central Mexico by the late seventeenth century. Lachitaa oﬃcials were charged with collecting contributions from each household, in order to acquire turkeys, costly quetzal feathers from Chiapas, and other items necessary for a collective feast. Around September 3, Mariana Martín, a ﬁfty-two-year-old woman, refused to contribute the three reales that town leaders required of every adult town resident. Her husband, Simón de Santiago, grew angry and beat her, and the ﬁscal (minor oﬃcial), Juan de Santiago, advised Simón to kill Mariana, so she would not divulge their plans to Spanish authorities. Mariana ﬂed to San Ildefonso, Villa Alta’s seat of governance, and revealed the events at Lachitaa to her son-in-law, Juan Sánchez, then in prison, who notiﬁed the authorities. Besides Mariana and Juan, Catharina María, a twenty-ﬁve-year-old woman, also contended she and her husband refused to contribute money toward those celebrations. But when Juan Martínez de Escapa, Villa Alta’s alguacil mayor (chief constable), arrived in Lachitaa a day later, most adults had ﬂed town, except for Melchora Martín, a widow whose house was being used by Zapotec authorities to store the festivity’s implements: seats for the celebrants, eight vats of tepache, a two-tone drum known as nicachi in Zapotec and teponaztli in Nahuatl, turkey and deer bones to be used as drumsticks, a round box made of horn, and twenty-nine perforated stones wrapped in tree bark. Melchora had also made maize tamales with amaranth seeds.5 The rift that separated Mariana and Catharina from their oﬃcials was not merely based on gender or political divisions; it also involved cosmological knowledge. Mariana testiﬁed that, on an early morning in May 1718—a month in which another sixty-ﬁve-day period ended, on May 12 (13-Field, quecina)— she had seen the adult men of Lachitaa gather at a plantain ﬁeld downhill\n\n2\n\nintr oduc tion\n\nfrom the town. Before the assembly, Gaspar Baptista began to play the nicachi drum, while Fabián Luis accompanied him on a turtle shell.6 These two men came from Betaza, a town a few miles north with close ties with Lachitaa, and were known for their prowess as ritual singers. According to witnesses in an idolatry trial held fourteen years earlier, both men had been trained by the maestro de idolatrías, teacher of idolatries, Nicolás de Selis, in exchange for a payment of twenty-ﬁve pesos from a confraternity devoted to the Virgin of the Rosary.7 From her house, high above the plantain ﬁeld, all Mariana could hear was that they were singing “in the ancient fashion.” She believed she heard the phrase se queman las estrellas, “the stars are burning,” and speciﬁed that it was sung not in Northern but in Valley Zapotec. Mariana’s reference to “burning” suggests a ritual song that began, indeed, with quichohuici y.ba y.nesa, “the gratitude will be charred8 right away,” and which referred to a food oﬀering for sacred beings (see the appendix for a translation of these songs). This composition opened a lengthy song cycle that had been transcribed by Pedro de Vargas of Betaza, given to Fernando de Lopes of Lachirioag, and eventually surrendered to Bishop Maldonado, who submitted it to the Council of the Indies as proof that the Dominicans’ evangelization eﬀorts had been less than diligent.9 According to Mariana, the arcane words in those songs resembled a variant not spoken in the Sierra, Colonial Valley Zapotec (CVZ). She was right: as the appendix demonstrates, cognates for specialized terms in these songs appear in Vocabulario en lengua Çapoteca (1578), the most authoritative Colonial Valley Zapotec dictionary, compiled by the Dominican lexicographer Juan de Córdova, also author of a grammar, Arte en lengua zapoteca (1578).10 As shown by Thomas Smith-Stark in 2007, four branches of Zapotec, including Central (Valley) and Northern, split from the same ancestor language. Hence, in colonial times, Northern and Valley Zapotec were mutually intelligible, but only to a degree. Besides political, cosmological, and linguistic diﬀerences, there was another divide between town residents and ritual specialists: literacy. In the second half of the seventeenth century, while a few Northern Zapotec escribanos, “notaries,” had been idolaters, many ritual specialists were literate, and composed texts in various genres in their communities. The manuals and songs that will be analyzed here were produced or owned by about 120 ritual specialists (see table 3.4). During the second half of the seventeenth century, these writers and readers had developed an autonomous “republic of letters” that, while deeply entrenched in an ancestral understanding of the universe and the interests of sixty Zapotec communities, also had substantial intellectual links with literacy practices, legal discourses, and astronomical knowledge that spanned the Spanish Atlantic world.\n\n3\n\nre thinking z ap otec time\n\nsignific a nce of t he cor p us As the largest archive of Native calendrical and cosmological texts in the colonial Americas, the Villa Alta corpus—composed by Indigenous intellectuals for Indigenous readers and preserved as a result of their conﬁscation by Bishop Maldonado—is an extraordinary source for Latin American history, religion, and culture. Its study occupies a place at the conﬂuence of four themes: the entanglements of cultural and political mediation in the Atlantic World, Native colonial identities, the history of colonial religious institutions, and interdisciplinary Mesoamerican studies. Over the last decade, the study of cultural mediation has come of age to yield more exacting histories of interconnections. After sketching the “connected histories” of Europe and Asia, Sanjay Subrahmanyam turned to the origins of a global history that showcased links among Asian, Middle Eastern, and European scholars.11 A more deliberate examination of multiple connections and transatlantic information exchanges resulted in important contributions not only to the study of elite scientiﬁc milieux in Spanish America, but also to “entangled” British and Spanish colonial projects, or to our knowledge of healing and medical practices through networks that included enslaved people, and commoners of African, Indigenous, and mixed descent.12 Connected histories are not novel in colonial Mexico, as entangled intellectual histories have showcased the achievements of colonial Indigenous scholars since Carlos María Bustamante, following Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora and Lorenzo Boturini, began championing the work of Nahua historian Chimalpahin shortly after the War of Independence. As is well known, Native scholars educated in the liberal arts at the Franciscan Colegio de Santa Cruz assisted missionaries with translation, evangelization, and lexicographic enterprises from 1536 onward, and Nahua Latinists such as Pablo Nazareo and the scholar-politician of plebeian origin Antonio Valeriano eloquently argued for the preservation of their privileges.13 In the seventeenth century, Native or mestizo historians such as Chimalpahin, Tezozomoc, Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl, and Juan Buenaventura Zapata y Mendoza, along with anonymous Zapotec and Nahua authors of origin narratives known as títulos primordiales (primordial records), recast oral histories, pictographic accounts, and earlier alphabetic texts into elite histories and genealogical narratives. In doing so, Indigenous historical narratives tied to speciﬁc polities expanded their footing in the colonial order.14 Some authors, like Chimalpahin and Alva Ixtlilxochitl, linked local histories to “universal” discourses about European history and classical antiquity. From the late seventeenth century onward, Creole and European intellectuals such as Carlos de Sigüenza y\n\n4\n\nintr oduc tion\n\nGóngora, Lorenzo Boturini, and Antonio de León y Gama shaped how these histories would be remembered and archived. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, both notables of Native origin and ascendant Creoles publicly, and expediently, embraced symbols of Native identity. At the heart of these connected histories stands a grave discordance: there was an emphasis on the narratives, genealogies, and works of Indigenous nobility and elites, who often were attuned to European knowledge, or educated by missionaries or clerics, or participants in urban social networks. Nevertheless, many other Indigenous elites and commoners did not align with colonial authorities, or had fewer occasions to engage them in ways easily traceable in ecclesiastic or civil archives. Two distinct but related approaches—the ascendancy of the New Philology and the systematic study of catechetical texts—have provided a measure of balance and also undergirded eﬀorts to analyze the workings of colonial communities through the study of routine records in Mesoamerican languages, such as wills, petitions, tributary rolls, and letters.15 These approaches fostered an expansion of Ángel Rama’s famed trope about the Latin American “lettered city.” There is ample evidence not only for a ﬂourishing of genres in Mesoamerican languages in regional and local settings, sometimes with relative autonomy from colonial notarial and legal practice, but also for literacy networks beyond urban settlements in the Andes.16 The study of these sophisticated literacy spheres and networks challenges a received historiography regarding a “republic of letters” that leads, inevitably, to a public sphere in the Enlightenment, as posited by Jürgen Habermas.17 Given the early adoption of alphabetic literacy in Central Mexico, and the readiness with which Indigenous claimants embraced litigation in civil courts from the mid-sixteenth century onward, it comes as no surprise that these subjects were capable of negotiating and partially transforming the frameworks through which their claims were adjudicated.18 To understand the society that produced the sacred texts that are the subject of this book, however, one must engage in what Bernard Cohn memorably called “proctological history”: a history from the “bottom up” that not only examines the agency and strategies of “subaltern” groups but also analyzes how various actors aligned with or dissented from collective action.19 Unlike other texts that circulated across Indigenous republics of letters in New Spain, these clandestine manuals and songs could not position memories within a public legal framework. Thus, their authors made no concessions, and did not engage readers outside a Northern Zapotec social and intellectual sphere. Theirs was a variant form of colonial subjecthood that coexisted with more orthodox strategies for preserving elite privilege and seeking alliances with other elites or with civil authorities.\n\n5\n\nre thinking z ap otec time\n\nThis history from below must also engage Native subjects who exercised little agency regarding the documents and archives that recorded their beliefs and lived experience. Alongside historical scholarship that has continued to build upon foundational studies about the Mexican Inquisition, ecclesiastical tribunals, and popular religious practices,20 other studies inﬂuenced by the New Philology in the last decade have turned to the study of trial records generated by ecclesiastic tribunals and inquisitorial judges in New Spain. These recent works depart from earlier studies in terms of scope, but also in terms of extending their analyses to previously unknown or poorly studied sources. Some scholars examined inquisitorial politics, juridical procedure, and jurisdictional conﬂicts, and others attempted surveys that trace institutional policies, both for ecclesiastic tribunals and for civil judges who intervened in cases of Native idolatry, sorcery, and superstition.21 Among the vast number of colonial documents in Mesoamerican languages produced by Indigenous writers, a subset of works stands out because they preserve, in impressive detail, collective memories about pre-Columbian cosmological beliefs, sacred narratives, rhetorical performance, and a complex narrative of origins, migrations, and foundations. Many of these works were part of a protracted conversation between Native and European authors. The Cantares Mexicanos, although transcribed by Christianized Nahuas, feature traditional rhetorical forms, and commemorate preconquest feats. The Popol Vuh collected unique narratives regarding the origins and history of K’iche’ Maya polities.22 An important set of sixteenth- and seventeenthcentury records preserved the political history of Kaqchikel Maya communities.23 At a remove, mediated by Franciscans, Book 6 of the Florentine Codex preserved songs devoted to Central Mexican deities, and a manuscript by Hernando Ruiz de Alarcón records in superb detail Nahua prayers.24 On the other hand, while parts of the Northern Zapotec corpus align with some genres outlined above—like the songs in Cantares Mexicanos—they were part of a social world in which texts, such as colonial K’iche’ and Kaqchikel daykeeping manuals, circulated clandestinely. Similar works included the Yucatec Maya Books of the Chilam Balam, which contained prophecies and arcane narratives, the Cantares de Dzitbalché, which propitiated Maya deities, and the Ritual of the Bacabo’ob, which recorded hybrid healing practices, among other genres.25 Entangled histories produce entangled objects. The Zapotec manuals were shaped by colonial literacy and writing practices and corralled in a subterranean sphere through punishment. But they also reﬂect an astoundingly rich religious tradition that may be seen as an equivalent of Mediterranean antiquity, in terms of the depth of its historiography and the dependence on linguistic analyses and interdisciplinary methodologies to plumb its con-\n\n6\n\nintr oduc tion\n\ntents. This interdisciplinary endeavor calls for the integration of historical, linguistic, philological, and archaeological data. The corpus of Postclassic codices and material culture has stimulated the production of exegeses of particular codices, synthetic works, and research on colors and manufacture.26 Several lines of inquiry have questioned received interpretations regarding the representation of Mesoamerican deities, astronomical observations, and correlations between Indigenous and European calendars.27 Such approaches beneﬁt from a broader discussion within archaeology that focuses on Native ontologies, and religious practices interpreted through material traces.28 The Northern Zapotec corpus allows for a deep inquiry about Mesoamerican theories about the structure of cosmos and time. Its emphasis on the worship of founding ancestors allows for comparisons with Zapotec writing and pictorial and archaeological data from Classic (250–900 CE) and Postclassic (900–1519 CE) stone carvings, eﬃgy vessels, and tombs in central Oaxaca.29 As chapters 4 through 6 of this book demonstrate, there are clear convergences in terms of cycles and protocols between the manuals and four Central Mexican codices that belong to the Borgia group: the Borgia, the Cospi, the Fejérváry Mayer, and the Vaticanus B. At the same time, the Zapotec books articulate a theory regarding the interdigitation of time—the 260 feasts—and space—the geography of the cosmos—a unique tradition that diﬀers from diagrams in other Central Mexican codices. Zapotec social and cultural history, enmeshed within Atlantic history, is another major focus of this work. Through the pioneering work of Joseph Whitecotton and María de los Ángeles Romero Frizzi, the study of Postclassic and early colonial Zapotec elites acquired new paradigms and emphasized a variety of sources.30 Marcello Carmagnani noted that, after population recovery in Northern Oaxaca and the Isthmus, Native authorities engineered the return of ancient deities, and confronted alcaldes mayores. This work was followed by John K. Chance’s masterful analysis of the political and demographic history of Villa Alta and Judith Zeitlin’s critical assessment of the 1660 Tehuantepec rebellion.31 The exemplary work of Thomas Smith-Stark on the two most important lexicographic sources for Colonial Valley Zapotec—Juan de Córdova’s 1578 dictionary and grammar—illuminated cosmology and catechesis for historians, and other linguists have continued to investigate colonial Valley Zapotec sources.32 In the last two decades, the translation, study, and comparative analysis of sources in colonial Zapotec variants gained greater importance through the work of scholars who explored important archival depositories in Mexico and Spain33 and analyzed Zapotec catechetical imprints and manuscripts.34 Other works have focused primarily on Spanish-language civil and ecclesiastical records from Villa Alta, and documented Zapotec social and political\n\n7\n\nNorthern Zapotec ethnolinguistic and territorial divisions in the alcaldía mayor of Villa Alta, Oaxaca.

After the execution of ﬁfteen rebels as punishment for a violent 1700 rebellion in San Francisco Caxonos, the newly arrived Bishop Maldonado visited the northern sierras, beginning in 1702, and issued a general amnesty for crimes of idolatry, in exchange for full collective confessions. From September 1704 to January 1705, the authorities of pueblos de indios, Indigenous communities, in Villa Alta went to the jurisdictional seat of San Ildefonso to register their confessions regarding ceremonies both de particulares, private, and del común, collective, that focused on deities and ancestors (see map). In the end, sixty-eight Zapotec communities—ﬁfteen Bixanos, twenty-seven Caxonos, twenty-six Nexitzo—as well as twenty-nine Ayuuk (Mixe) and seven Tsa Jujmi-speaking (Chinantec) towns, deposited brief confessions, denounced their specialists, and turned in calendrical manuals or ritual implements (see table 3.4).39 This exercise was substantially diﬀerent from other ambitious inquisitorial campaigns against heretics and sorcerers, such as Jacques Fournier’s inquiries in Montaillou, and Juan de Zumárraga’s investigations of Basque witches and, later, Nahua idolaters.40 Rather than conducting personal interrogations, Bishop Maldonado delegated his powers to his visitador general (visitor general), the renowned extirpator of idolatries Joseph de Aragón y Alcántara, and to a Dominican commissioned judge, Diego de Cardona, while Zapotec testimony was translated by the mestizo interpreter Joseph de Ramos. These eﬀorts constitute the most ambitious idolatry extirpation attempt carried out in New Spain, as they mobilized the elected authorities of about 104 recognized Indigenous communities, which comprised 421 settlements with an estimated total population of 36,396.41 Its scale was unusual not only in terms of its target demographic, but also due to the large corpus it amassed: 102 calendar manuals from thirty-seven communities, composed in the second half of the seventeenth century. Four collections of ritual songs\n\n9\n\nre thinking z ap otec time\n\nwere also turned in, two devoted to deities and founding ancestors, while the other two celebrated Christian entities.42 The 102 manuals contain partial or full lists of the 260-day Zapotec ritual calendar, and contemporary archivists grouped them into ninety-nine cuadernos (booklets). The corpus contains ninety-two complete lists of the 260-feast cycle, seven calendars with at least 75 percent of the 260-day cycle, two calendar fragments, and two calendars with nonstandard day orders. This is a unique corpus for the colonial Americas, in terms of its unparalleled contents and the number of texts conﬁscated. While most ecclesiastical judges would burn eﬃgies and ritual implements in a public disciplinary act, these divinatory texts were spared that fate, as Maldonado employed them as evidence of the uneven results obtained by Dominicans after almost 170 years of residence in Oaxaca. Unlike many other Mesoamerican sources, the historiography of the Villa Alta corpus is of recent vintage. In the early 1960s, the art historian Enrique Marco Dorta alerted the Spanish anthropologist José Alcina Franch about its existence. One of Franch’s students, Cristina Zilbermann, wrote her undergraduate thesis on the documents, and Franch and Zilbermann authored the ﬁrst publications about them in 1966.43 Franch explored the topic in the early 1970s, and in 1993 he authored a monograph that publicized this corpus’s importance, discussed deities and the structure of the 260- and 365day counts, and provided a synoptic analysis of local ceremonies. Franch analyzed these manuals from the vantage point of Spanish-language documentation, as he did not read Zapotec, and subsequently Arthur Miller addressed this corpus.44 I started working on the Villa Alta documents in 1997 as a doctoral student, began studying Songbooks 100–103 (not previously translated or addressed by Alcina Franch), and published my ﬁrst analysis of them in 2000. My research was facilitated by a microﬁlm copy of México 882 kindly supplied by the AGI in 2000, by transcriptions, scans, and photographs of Zapotec-language documents at the Archivo Histórico Judicial de Oaxaca (AHJO) that I collected between 1999 and 2020, and by access to and permissions from APVA in 2008. While this book focuses on the México 882 corpus rather than on testaments, I have also completed transcriptions and analytical translations of more than forty wills and petitions from the vast testament corpus held at AHJO, and these have been occasionally cited in earlier preliminary analyses.45 My translations of these documents, along with transcriptions of all the calendar data in the México 882 corpus and select transcriptions of ecclesiastic and civil idolatry proceedings from AHJO and other archives, will be made available through this book’s bilingual companion websites: biyee.vassar.edu and zapotectime.vassar.edu. In the end, for contemporary Northern Zapotec communities, this excep-\n\n10\n\nintr oduc tion\n\ntional corpus is connected to devotions and sacred sites that still are part of everyday life. Hence, this project rests on the solidarity of Indigenous intellectuals listed in my acknowledgments, who magnanimously shared their wisdom with me, and on the judgment of Indigenous readers, who will be this work’s ultimate arbiters. The present volume is the ﬁrst interpretation of the calendar and ritual song corpus together, fully contextualized, and supported not only by philological and linguistic analyses of Zapotec texts, but also by a social history of Northern Zapotec communities informed by Mesoamerican calendrics, and by linguistic and ethnographic research that I have conducted since 1999 in Lachirioag, Yaa, Yatee, Yalahui, Betaza, Lachitaa, Yalalag, and other Northern Zapotec communities. My research is also based on mundane and sacred texts in Northern Zapotec preserved at the Archivo Histórico Judicial de Oaxaca, the Archivo General de la Nación (AGN), and the Archivo General de Indias, and on colonial and modern Valley and Northern Zapotec dictionaries, grammars, and devotional literature.46 The nature of this corpus poses multiple challenges: as these are writings meant only for Indigenous readers, any interpretation of the alphabetic texts and diagrams requires considerable philological and linguistic knowledge about colonial Northern Zapotec documents. The contents of these texts demonstrate that, as late as the end of the seventeenth century, two time counts of pre-Columbian origin were in constant use in most Northern Zapotec communities. The foundational cycle was a 260-feast day divinatory count called biyee, or “time period.” The second time count depicted was a vague solar year cycle of 365 days, called yza. Like its Nahua counterpart the xihuitl, also a 365-day count, the yza divided into eighteen festivals, and ended on a period called quicholla quieainij, “[the days] will be disconcerted and angry” in Zapotec, and nemontemi, “they are full in vain,” in Nahuatl. The list of 260 feasts, which served as the manuals’ central axis, was sometimes preceded or followed by other lists, usually one of which contained the ﬁfty-two Zapotec years, along with instructions for offerings. Feast names were frequently followed by notes referring to deities, cycles within the 260-day count, observances, and auguries. What label best ﬁts this corpus? These calendrical books often began with a variant of the phrase biyee xoci xotao reho, “the periods [or time count] of the fathers and ancestors of us all.” Specialists used these manuals as highly portable texts that could be corrected, amended, or expanded following pragmatic criteria. Seizing on this fact, idolatry eradicators identiﬁed these works as cuadernos, “notebooks.” However, these documents contain not only the 260 feasts, but also other cycles, auguries, cosmological diagrams, drawings that explore time–space correlations, lists of deities, instructions for ritual\n\n11\n\nre thinking z ap otec time\n\npractices segregated by gender and age, eclipse annotations, correlations with the Christian calendar, and origin narratives. Therefore, I will refer to these documents as “manuals” that encompass the entire cosmology and divinatory practices of Northern Zapotec colonial society.\n\nvolu me ov er v ie w This chapter has introduced the Northern Zapotec corpus and addressed its signiﬁcance in Latin American history, ethnohistory, religion, Mesoamerican studies, and historical anthropology. Chapter 2 begins with a sketch of the central engine of Zapotec divination: the 260-feast count. It then explores the rethinking of knowledge of Central Mexican calendars by addressing correspondences between Nahua and Northern Zapotec years, Mexica calendar reform, and correlations by Indigenous and Creole intellectuals. Chapter 3 introduces Colonial Northern Zapotec (CNZ) as written, examines literacy practices in Zapotec communities, and places sacred songs and rhetoric in the context of related genres. Chapter 4 analyzes a central principle in Zapotec cosmology: a continuum that spanned time (feast days) and space (cosmological regions), through examples drawn from Zapotec diagrams and Codex Borgia scenes. Chapter 5 examines the cult of Zapotec deities, and examines narratives that informed both the cosmogonic scenes in the Borgia, and Zapotec theories about cosmic origins. After a review of ancestor genealogies, chapter 6 analyzes the reenactment of creation events and sacred history and exchanges with ancestors, turning also to their political consequences. This chapter also reveals continuities in ancestor worship between Classic period Zapotec writing and iconography and seventeenth-century songs, which memorialized the return of ancestors in the shape of snake, turtle, and jaguar co-beings. Chapter 7 examines statements about the preservation of ancestral devotions and the rejection of Christianity as anti-colonial discourses. It also analyzes the absorption of Christian entities into cosmological theories, and the reception of Christian teachings in testament preambles. A concluding chapter summarizes the local politics that reshaped a colonial universe: the concerted practice of lineages, elites, and specialists, who successfully defended local autonomy through coercion, legal maneuvers, and alliances.\n\n12\n\nchapter t wo\n\nRethinking Time Zapotec and Nahua Cycles after the Conquest\n\nissionaries and spanish conquerors brought Christian time to Central Mexican societies not merely as new sacred observances, but also as novel timekeeping practices that forced a rethinking of time in the colonial order. A conquest of time measurements took place as Indigenous writers and notaries began to use the European year. But more tantalizing fare, European divination, was also an early arrival. In June 1520, as the need for Cortés’s army to ﬂee Mexico Tenochtitlan became evident, Blas Botello, “who thought himself astrologer or necromancer,” insisted that the Spaniards had to leave on a particular hour and night, for otherwise they would perish.1 Paradoxically, Botello perished during that evening’s retreat—the famed Noche Triste, Sad Night—and a search of his possessions revealed a divination booklet and a fetish object.2 Indigenous observers would later become fascinated with European astrology, but this interest went both ways: one of the earliest Mexican inquisitorial trials, in 1528, investigated the notary Juan Fernández del Castillo, who made natives burn papers before a dog-shaped eﬃgy.3 This chapter places the structure of the Zapotec 260-day divinatory count and 365-day cycle in the context of Central Mexican counts. First it examines the structure of the Zapotec divinatory and year counts and proposes a novel\n\nM\n\nre thinking z ap otec time\n\ninterpretation of year periods, focusing on an astounding correspondence between ﬁve periods in the Zapotec year and in the Nahua pre-reform year that began on the Izcalli period. The next section reviews ﬁve important early sources for the Nahua year and its periods and correlation with the European year, and reviews the historiography of correlation proposals after Caso’s signature intervention. The next section argues that a momentous reform of the Mexica (or Aztec) calendar took place in 1507–1508, and reconciles apparently contradictory statements by Chimalpahin and Sahagún. Another section explores further evidence for Izcalli as ﬁrst period, based on calendars by Chimalpahin and Cristóbal del Castillo. The chapter ends with an assessment of the rethinking of Central Mexican time counts by Indigenous and Creole authors.4\n\nt he z a p o t ec 26 0 -f e a s t day di v ina t or y c ou n t : s t ruc t u r e a nd c on t e x t The interpretation of the Zapotec divinatory count was, for reasons that will become readily apparent, a specialized pursuit. According to Córdova’s dictionary, ritual specialists who focused on the interpretation of the 260-day cycle were colanij, “one who casts the feasts,” and less neutrally denominated “conjurers or sorcerers.”5 Huechijlla or huechilla was translated as adiuino or sortílego, “diviner, conjurer,” while pijzi was an “augury,” and this term also recurred in entries linked to disgrace or injury.6 Colani, “maker of feasts,” contains the agentive co- and the nominal root lanij, “feast.”7 In his dictionary, Córdova cites a number of ritual specializations linked to the term colanij, which included forecasting based on star gazing (colanij pèlle); on ﬁre (colanij quij); on air or wind (colanij pèe); on water (colanij niça); on birds (colanij màni zàbi); on sacriﬁces (colanij pichijlla); and also on human faces (colanij lào peni). A diviner “through the magical arts” was colanij tào, “great feast-maker.” This list, lexicographic in intent, was inﬂuenced by Nebrija’s Vocabulario, as were most lexicographic projects of its age,8 and it lacks the contextualization found in Sahagún, Ruiz de Alarcón, and other Nahua sources. In Colonial Northern Zapotec, bene guechea referred to ritual specialists in colonial times,9 and this label gave rise to bene walla, which now designates contemporary Northern Zapotec ritual specialists, particularly malevolent ones.10 In some Southern Zapotec communities, daykeepers still employ divinatory counts with ﬁve diﬀerent periods, and thus the structure of many of these counts diﬀers from that of the colonial cycles.11 Another Valley Zapotec term, huía tào, is glossed as “pope or priest of the\n\n14\n\nz ap otec and nahua c ycles af ter the conque s t\n\nDevil; only he entered in his sancta sanctorum, where the idols were to offer sacriﬁces.”12 The term huía may be glossed as “carrier,” as the verb toaya means “to carry a load on one’s back,”13 and its agentive form recurs in the terms “water carrier,” huia niça, and “carrier of provisions (despensero), of provisions for the road,” huia huaana.14 Hence, the literal meaning of huía tào may be “sacred carrier.” Thus analyzed, huía tào and another term for a Zapotec or Christian priest, còpa pitào, “keeper of deities,” have semantic parallels with a Nahuatl term for a preconquest priest, teopixqui, literally “deity keeper,” and later glossed as “ecclesiastic, religious.”15 The most important count in Mesoamerican divinatory and timekeeping practices was the cycle of 260 feast days. As Elizabeth Brumﬁel asserted, these “technologies of time” framed dialogues between specialists and clients based on the exchange of cosmological and social information.16 Although each “feast” equaled twenty-four hours, the 260 feasts were much more than solar days: they were entities with a unique name, position, and periodization, and also units for sacred celebrations. As discussed in later chapters, feasts were characterized as doors, portals, mats of authority, and ﬂowers. Their names and structure derived from two major cycles: one of positional preﬁ xes, or numbers, from 1 to 13, and another of twenty terms that referred to plants, animals, or forces of nature, yielding 260 names. Both Zapotec and Nahuatl feasts corresponded to, but were diﬀerent from, solar days. While ilhuitl referred to “day” or “festivity” in Nahuatl, the 260day cycle was called tonalpohualli, or “count of tonalli.” The term tonalli, literally “solar heat,” referred to an essential component of personhood, and was also used to translate the Christian notion of “soul.”17 In Colonial Zapotec, while chij, chèe, and copijcha referred to a “day,” the 260 units were lani, a term Córdova deﬁned as “solemn occasion, feast,” also used in glosses for “festivity” or “day of obligation.”18 Like ilhuitl, Zapotec lani conferred characteristics to the people born under them. The association between one individual and their feast of birth was called xiàa, “name, or birth, planet, feast, or sign under which each one was born, and which was his fate.”19 The 260 units were distributed into twenty groups of thirteen, and less frequently into thirteen groups of twenty.20 The 260-feast count was called piyè (“time” or “interval”) in Colonial Valley Zapotec, and biyee in Colonial Northern Zapotec. The latter term, used here, could also refer to years. Biyee/piyè stresses an ancient link between divination and writing: piyè contains the animacy preﬁ x pi- and the root -yye, “picture, letter, painted image.”21 Lastly, the Zapotec word cocii designated a time span; Córdova used it for thirteen-day periods and seasons in the year, and Northern Zapotec specialists for year periods.22 This work follows the long-standing convention of calling thirteen-day periods trecenas.\n\n15\n\ntable 2.1.

The Zapotec day signs belong to the earliest calendrical system in the Americas, as epigraphic evidence has dated it to about 600 BCE.23 The terms for these signs are similar in Colonial Valley and Northern Zapotec sources. It is not known whether these similarities reﬂect terms extant in a core protolanguage from which Northern, Central, Southern, and 17\n\nFACE: lao, loo\n\nre thinking z ap otec time\n\nPapabuco Zapotec emerged, or whether they were introduced from the central valleys to the sierra during the Late Classic period.24 Writing arrived in Northern Oaxaca in the Late Classic, as carvings in Yaguila and other Northern Zapotec towns featured day signs that follow stylistic conventions employed in Oaxaca’s central valleys that date to the sixth to ninth centuries CE.25 The 260 feast names appear primarily in two sources: Córdova’s 1578 Zapotec grammar, and the 102 Villa Alta manuals; the twenty day name roots appear in bold below. These names remained stable for many centuries. The earliest pictograms for the twenty day signs from Monte Albán and the central valleys ca. 400 ACE, as proposed by Javier Urcid, have close semantic correspondences with colonial day names. Fourteen names had naturalized representations: Caiman, -chilla26 (Sign 1) Night, horned owl, -èela27 (Sign 3) Lizard, -echi, -achi (Sign 4) Deer, -china28 (Sign 7) Rabbit or Hare, -lhaba (Sign 8) Water, -nìça (Sign 9) Knot, -tèla29 (Sign 10) Monkey, -lloo30 (Sign 11) Soaproot, -piàa31 (Sign 12) Reed, -ii, -ee, -laa (Sign 13) Jaguar, -eche, -ache, from pèche tào32 (Sign 14) Field, corncob and leaves, -(in)na, from quiñaa33 (Sign 15) Drop, water and plants, -appe, -epag, -apag (Sign 19) Face, -lao (Sign 20)\n\nWhile Nahua day signs corresponded to full words, Zapotec sign names are either base morphemes (-china, “deer”) or non-morphemic ﬁnal word segments, like those in cotáche or huaachi,34 Lizard; or làpa,35 Drop. In two cases, one sign has two variants. Sign 2 has the form -ee, from bee,36 “wind,” when preceded by positionals 1, 12, and 13; elsewhere, it is -laa, from làha quìepàaa,37 “lightning.” Sign 13 has two variants, -laa from quéla, “unripe maize,” and -ii from qui, “reed.”38 Two signs have two possible readings. Sign 18, -òpa, comes from còpa, glossed as “dew,” and “cold.”39 The Classic period pictogram for Sign 16, -lào, depicted an eye, while mani pe-lào, “crow,”40 is, like the Nahua count’s “buzzard,” a carrion eater. Day signs 5 (Snake), 6 (Death), and 17 (Earthquake, equivalent to ollin 41 in Nahuatl) are iconographically similar to their Central Mexican counterparts, but the names of the ﬁrst two employed words that diﬀered from “snake”\n\n18\n\nz ap otec and nahua c ycles af ter the conque s t\n\n(pèlla) and “death” (quela coti). The Zapotec name for day sign Snake probably meant “omen.” Córdova stressed the link between -zi, -çee, “omen,” and serpents by translating toni pijcia, toçàca pijzia, tocòaya pijzi as “to divine what singing birds or snakes do,” and mentioned the “deity of omens,” Pij-zi,42 whose Northern Zapotec counterpart was E-ci. Sign 6, a cranium, was -lana, glossed as “ﬂesh; something that stinks like ﬂesh or a carcass, hua-làna, nalàna.”43 Sign 8, -laba, was read as “Rabbit” in Nahua and Mixtec counts. The Zapotec sign depicts a hare or rabbit, and Córdova’s grammar referred to “animal ﬁgures” employed for this count that included “Deer, Hare,” which correspond to Signs 7 and 8 in sequence. Sign 8’s name, -laba, is an exact match for zo-lhaba, which still means “rabbit, hare” in Lachirioag according to Ricardo Ambrosio, and it also resembles “harvest,” cocij co-llàpa,44 rather than “hare,” pèla pi-lláana in Valley and be-lana in Northern Zapotec.45 The recitation of the 260 Zapotec feast names was an ancient verbal art. While Nahuas transparently used numbers as coeﬃcients, specialists deployed positional preﬁ xes that were not words for numbers, even though Zapotec languages have an elaborate numeral system.46 To keep their place in the count, colonial specialists wrote the numerals 1 to 13 next to day names. Table 2.2 lists the thirteen positional preﬁ xes from sources in Valley (italics) and Northern (regular type) Zapotec. Day sign names were rendered in full after the preﬁ x yag-. While this table is indebted to Terry Kaufman’s analysis, it also diﬀers from it.47 First, I analyze these preﬁ xes as positional, rather than augments: while some seem identical (5 and 9, 7 and 10), they diﬀered in terms of tone or other untranscribed features. Moreover, the seven sign names that begin with vowels take a positional preﬁ x that ends with -l or duplicate consonant (-g); all of them, except for Dew, change the ﬁrst vowel from a to e before preﬁ xes 1, 12, and 13. Positional preﬁ xes blended seamlessly with day sign names to yield the 260 feast names, as depicted in ﬁgure 2.1, which shows the two ﬁrst trecenas in Manual 85-1.\n\nt he nor t her n z a p o t ec y e a r in con t e x t Early colonial accounts about Nahua calendars, written by Indigenous scholars, chroniclers, and missionaries, coincide on some observations: alongside the 260-day count ran a vague solar year, called xihuitl. It included 360 days divided into eighteen periods of twenty days, which Chimalpahin called metztli, metztlapohualli, “moon, moon count,” and ﬁve days called nemontemi, “they are full in vain.” As recorded in the Florentine Codex and other sources, communal celebrations took place during each of the eighteen festivals, whose names had regional variants.48 The festivities called for the par-\n\n19\n\nre thinking z ap otec time\n\ntable 2.2.

An entire cycle of ﬁfty-two Nahua years was a xiuhmolpilli, “bundle of years.” As shown below, calendar specialists could name any 365-day period by using a sequence of four day signs as year bearers; the Nahua day sign name appears ﬁrst, followed by the Zapotec name, whenever they diﬀer. Five year-\n\n20\n\nz ap otec and nahua c ycles af ter the conque s t\n\nbearer sets (I–V) existed.49 Classic period Zapotec counts used Set II, Nahua and Mixtec calendars employed Set III, and Set I appears in the TellerianoRemensis.50 Although Set III is used in some Postclassic Zapotec monuments,51 Northern Zapotec specialists continued to employ Set II (in bold here) until the 1700s. Each day sign in these sets is spaced ﬁve positions apart from the next one. Set I Set II Set III Set IV Set V\n\n1. Caiman 2. Wind 3. House/Night 4. Lizard 5. Snake\n\n6. Death 7. Deer 8. Rabbit 9.

Flower/Face\n\nWhile these ﬁve sets may be considered primarily as year bearers, there is much more than meets the eye here. Daykeepers treated the 260-day count as a cycle of cycles, divisible into various patterns imbued with meanings,\n\nfigure 2.1. The ﬁrst two trecenas in Manual 85-1. Ministerio de Cultura y Deporte. Archivo General de Indias. México 882, 1405v–1406r.\n\n21\n\nre thinking z ap otec time\n\nwhich provided a structure for ritual action. The so-called year-bearer pattern was formed by taking the canonical list of twenty day signs and ordering it into ﬁve series of four day signs, each spaced ﬁve positions apart. This procedure yielded not only year bearers, but also cycles of sixty-ﬁve days, if each day sign in the series is read as the ﬁrst day of a trecena. Hence, Set I, 1-Caiman (trecena 1), 1-Death (trecena 6), 1-Monkey (trecena 11), and 1-Vulture/ Crow (trecena 16) each mark the day of a 65-day period, and thus divide the 260-day count into four equal sections. The same is true of Set II (trecenas 18–3–8–13), Set III (trecenas 15–20–5–10), Set IV (trecenas 12–17–2–7), and Set V (trecenas 9–14–19–4). Hence, these series should be regarded as a ﬁveposition series, which yield both year bearers and 65-day periods. Set IV also determined the trecenas during which speciﬁc oﬀerings (maize, maize plants, orchard produce, tortillas) were given in a cycle of ﬁ ftytwo Zapotec years: trecenas 12–17–2–7. Given the close link between this series and Zapotec oﬀerings, chapter 4 proposes that the ﬁve-position series in Borgia 30, 31, 39, and 40 also provide a sequence for ritual protocols. In addition, the ﬁve-position series ﬁt the resulting 65-day cycles into a span of ﬁftytwo 365-day Mesoamerican years. The logical counterpart to these series is the four-position series, which is composed of four series of ﬁve day signs, each spaced four positions apart. These series locate in the 260-day count a set of well-known divinatory arrangements with complex spatial, temporal, and narrative elements. As discussed in detail by various Mesoamericanists, the illustrations in Borgia 49–52, Fejérváry-Mayer 33–34, and Vaticanus B 17–18 contain four major divinatory scenes linked to the same trecena sequences. In the Borgia, these are the jeweled tree of the East with a quetzal, associated with trecenas 1–5–9– 13–17; the spiny cactus of the North with a ﬂint-feathered eagle, linked to trecenas 2–6–10–14–18; the maize tree of the West with an eagle, associated to trecenas 3–7–11–15–19; and the thorn tree of the South with a macaw, linked to trecenas 4–8–12–16–20.52 Besides its manifold prognosticatory meanings, this four-position series also provides four diﬀerent ways of dividing the 260-day count into ﬁve 52-day periods. As discussed in chapters 4 and 5, while Northern Zapotec daykeepers occasionally referred to these cosmological trees and associated groups of thirteen years with the four cardinal points, they stressed other fourfold arrangements within the 260-day count: one that foregrounded the four intercardinal points, and another that prominently featured four quina, or cosmological ﬁelds, in lieu of the four directional trees. As they sought to understand and control Mesoamerican calendrics, European observers made two crucial errors of interpretation: they used analogies that treated the 260- and 365-day counts as a single cycle, and they as-\n\n22\n\nz ap otec and nahua c ycles af ter the conque s t\n\nsumed that subdivisions within those counts equaled those in the European year. Motolinia called trecenas “weeks,” and twenty-day periods “months”; Gómara asserted a ﬁfty-two-year cycle was a “century, jubilee.”53 Nonetheless, Zapotec and Nahua counts privileged arithmetic relationships: since the counts of 260 and 365 days ran side by side, a unique date in a period of ﬁftytwo years of 365 days, or 18,980 days, could be expressed in terms of both counts. As 260 and 18,980 are exactly divisible by 4, 13, and 20, these integers played crucial roles. Specialists could begin counting anywhere in the 18,980 day period, and any cycle of 365 days could be expressed by departing from any date in the 260-day count, adding 1 to the coeﬃcient, and then leaping over to the next ﬁfth sign in the twenty-sign sequence. If one began with 1-Earthquake, the next date would be 2-Wind, then 3-Deer, and this sequence named the ﬁrst three Zapotec years in a ﬁfty-two-year period. This sequence holds whether the day that names the year is Day 1 of 365 (Zapotec protocol), or Day 360 of 365 (Nahua protocol). These ﬂuid relationships could not be fully contained in “calendar wheels” developed by Motolinia, Sahagún, Durán, and Serna.54 By persisting in their belief that Indigenous counts were analogous to European ones, European chroniclers misunderstood the elegant arithmetic relationships that made Mesoamerican time tick. Furthermore, Central Mexican days did not begin after midnight. Chroniclers reported that Zapotec and some Nahua specialists counted their days from noon to noon, rather than from midnight to midnight. In the Codex Telleriano-Remensis (48v), the Dominican Pedro de los Ríos indicated that “they also count the day from midday until the next day at midday.” In his Arte, after listing the 260 lani, Córdova stated: “Those who were born were called according to the aforementioned names, each with the name of the day. And the day was counted from midday until another midday.”55 Some specialists retained this principle, while others adopted Christian standards. Below I present the ﬁrst substantial comparison of the Colonial Zapotec and Nahua years. It is unprecedented because, in spite of earlier discussions,56 no other work provides a full review of the Zapotec year and its periods, much less in the context of Central Mexican counts. My analysis yields three major observations. First, there is a close correspondence between the Northern Zapotec and the pre-reform Nahua year regarding the names and positions of ﬁve 20-day periods: the 7th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th. This correspondence suggests that the Colonial Zapotec year was modeled after a Nahua year that began on Izcalli, as proposed by Alfonso Caso and Wigberto Jiménez Moreno. It is highly unlikely these correspondences are coincidental, as there is also another crucial similarity: the Zapotec 260-day count remained in synchrony with the pre-1507 Tenochtitlan 260-day count. Finally, this comparison demonstrates the maintenance of ancestral counts, while\n\n23\n\nre thinking z ap otec time\n\nNahua counts were often rethought by Nahua, mestizo, and Creole scholars, as shown below. Daykeepers were keenly interested in points of contact among their 260-feast calendar, eclipses, and Christian holidays and weekdays. Manual 81, surrendered in December 1704 by the ﬁscal Juan Mathías of the Bixanos Zapotec town of San Juan Marinaltepeque (Malinaltepec),57 is of cardinal importance for establishing the correlation between the Northern Zapotec and Gregorian counts. A specialist, probably Juan Mathías’s father, added two annotations to this booklet. He noted that a lunar eclipse took place on 2-Jaguar, or Wednesday, January 21, 1693, and that a solar eclipse was visible on 5-Earthquake, or Thursday, August 23, 1691, mistakenly rendered “1692.” This latter eclipse was also described by a Nahua annalist in Puebla.58 John Justeson and I determined that this Manual 81 correlation, recorded by Juan Mathías’s father, coincided with the correlation in Manual 85-1, discussed below, which placed the beginning of a Zapotec year on February 23, 1695. This date, Day 1 in the Zapotec year, is 11-Earthquake, a year-bearer date. Therefore, the next year, 12-Wind, which started on February 23, 1696, was followed by 13-Deer, which began on February 22, 1697. These data helped us establish the correlation between the Zapotec year, the 260-feast count, and the Christian calendar.59 The two statements in Manual 81 and the beginning of the year recorded in Manual 85-1 corroborate three important features of Northern Zapotec calendars: (1) the 260-day count was in synchrony with the pre-1507 Tenochtitlan count, discussed in the next section; (2) the year did not have a leapyear correction in colonial times; (3) the Zapotec year was named after its ﬁrst day and not after Day 360, as in the Mexica system. It is not surprising to ﬁnd synchrony between Zapotec and pre-reform Mexica counts. As J. Eric Thompson observed in 1955, Caso’s correlation also applied to the divinatory cycles of twentieth-century Chol, Jacaltec, Ixil, K’iche’, Kaqchikel, and Mixe daykeepers, while Yucatec Maya counts were oﬀ by a day.60 Lastly, due to the position of Zapotec and Nahua year bearers, the former began 62–63 days after the Nahua year. Several correlation statements in Manual 63 conﬁrm the aforementioned correlation, and show that some Zapotec daykeepers counted feasts from midnight to midnight, while others, as recorded by Córdova and the TellerianoRemensis, measured them from noon to noon. Several annotators placed ﬁfteen correlation statements alongside feasts in Manual 63.61 Only one of them mentions a European date, October 6, [16]93, and it was placed after the intended feast, 13-Soaproot. Eight others list European months and days that align with the Manual 85-1 year count for the years 1691 and 1695, and the correlations work regardless of whether Zapotec feasts began at dawn or noon.62\n\n24\n\nz ap otec and nahua c ycles af ter the conque s t\n\nFour other statements in Manual 63 align with this correlation if the daykeeper counted feasts from noon to noon. Hence, one statement pairs the August 29, 1695, observance of Saint John the Baptist’s martyrdom with 2-Night, an accurate statement if the specialist referred to the morning of August 29 and believed the count shifted to 3-Lizard at noon.63 In sum, while the two correlations in Manual 81 are accurate if Juan Mathías’s father counted feasts from midnight to midnight, all but one of the statements in Manual 63 align with a noon-to-noon daykeeping practice. An interest in eclipse observations, as Manual 81 shows, recurred in two other manuals. In Manual 63, an annotator linked 6-Water with Saint Gregory’s Day, November 29, and in 1686 this was the date of a visible lunar eclipse. A statement that equated 5-Reed with Saint Andrew’s Day celebrations in 1694 (November 30 to December 1) may also have signaled the daykeeper’s interest in a pattern for possible lunar eclipses.64 Moreover, the author of Manual 37 recorded that on Year 13-Soaproot, “the sun was eaten,” an eclipse prediction further analyzed in chapter 4.\n\nt he y z a in t he m a n ua l s Córdova does not describe the structure of the yza, but his dictionary reports the term cacij píchij, “month, part, one-twelfth of the year,” where cacij refers to 20-day periods.65 Exceptionally, the most detailed information regarding the periods of the ancient Zapotec year comes from a few Nexitzo Zapotec specialists who resided in three settlements in the parish of Santa Cruz Yagavila in the 1690s. Out of 438 Zapotec ritual specialists active in early eighteenth-century Northern Oaxaca,66 and from a corpus of 102 manuals, year period names were recorded exclusively in manuals from three neighboring communities: Manual 85-1 from San Miguel Tiltepec (henceforth, the Tiltepec Year Count); Manual 98 from San Juan Yaxila; and Manual 94 from San Pedro Yagneri. Manual 85-1 must have come from Tiltepec, as it is adjacent to Manual 85-2, surrendered by Miguel de Aragón from Yaza, a Tiltepec dependency. The Tiltepec Year Count’s ﬁrst folio is the only surviving text, alphabetic or pictographic, that lists all eighteen festivals in the Zapotec year (plate 1). It also provides a correlation between these feasts and the Gregorian calendar for the years 1695–1696, which is in synchrony with the Manual 81 correlation discussed above. This manual was owned by one of three specialists who surrendered booklets in January 1705. The ﬁrst two were prominent Tiltepec daykeepers: Miguel Hernández Latza and Juan de Luna. In 1698, Luna said that he supervised a child sacriﬁce at Lao Gui, a sacred marsh near Tiltepec,\n\n25\n\ntable 2.3.

In Tiltepec, only these three men surrendered manuals, although two other manualowning specialists were denounced. The exceptional contents of the Tiltepec Year Count were informed by knowledge about the year possessed by one of two experienced specialists, Luna or Hernández, or by the alcalde, Velasco. Local political arrangements in the remote town of Tiltepec favored the preservation of ancestral beliefs. Two of the town oﬃcials were specialists: Velasco, and the healer and regidor\n\n27\n\nre thinking z ap otec time\n\n(councilman) Nicolás Santiago. In total, town oﬃcials counted among Tiltepec residents twenty-eight specialists or assistants in a town with 736 household heads: the aforementioned six manual owners, nine sorcerers, two healers, four men who knew about “ancient observances,” and seven assistants.68 According to the Tiltepec Year Count (table 2.3), the yza began on February 23 [1695], a Saturday. Since January 1, 1695, began on a Tuesday, and every year’s ﬁrst day was allocated the dominical letter A, Tuesdays in 1695 were paired with an A. Luna, Hernández, or Velasco correctly assigned the dominical letter A to Wednesdays in 1696, and recorded the end of the year as Sunday, February 23 [1696]. Because the beginning and end of the yza was recorded as February 23, it follows that the author(s) of the Tiltepec Year Count tracked Zapotec feasts from noon to noon, as did the annotators of Manual 63.69 A legend at the bottom of this page instructed nonspecialists on how to calculate the beginning of the Zapotec year: vigillia Samathie cij làçà tohuâ, “the vigil of Saint Matthias receives the turn of tohuâ [the year’s ﬁrst period]” (see plate 1). Since Saint Matthias’s Day was celebrated on February 24, in 1689–1692 the First of Tohuà, or Maguey,70 fell on this holiday; in 1693–1697 on its “vigil,” or February 23; and in 1697–1704 on February 22. Awareness of the connection between Saint Matthias’s feast and the Zapotec year’s ﬁrst day was widespread: eight Nexitzo towns revealed that the year’s ﬁrst major festivity took place in February, and ﬁve towns mentioned Saint Matthias’s feast as a day when oﬀerings, bathing, and sexual abstinence took place: Yagneri, Yavago, Xosa, Santa Cruz Xuquila, and Xogochi.71 In contrast with the Tiltepec count, Manual 98 by Juan de Santiago of Yaxila erroneously tried to cram the eighteen yearly cocii, or periods, equal to 360 days, into the 260 days of the biyee. Hence, his reckoning is uneven, as he listed only fourteen of eighteen festivals, and the resulting periods are shorter than the usual twenty days: Zaxi has seven days, Çogao thirteen, Hui Tao eight, and Yutila only twelve (table 2.3). Figure 2.2 shows how Santiago placed the beginning of goziy gona, Oﬀering Period, on 3-Night, and the start of ggozi gaa, Fruit Period, twenty days later, on 10-Night. To date, there has been no detailed analysis of the structure and divisions of the Zapotec yza and its possible correspondences with the Nahua year. A pointed reference in the Zapotec songs suggests that the observances of the ﬁrst period reﬂected Mexica inﬂuence. As shown in the appendix, a note before song 9, stanza 2 of Manual 100 characterizes the Zapotec year’s ﬁrst period, Tohuà (Maguey), as godo i.pa niquita goto yo i.no zagquita, “The ﬁrst square tomb, the ﬁrst house of he of Mexico-Tenochtitlan.” 72 Moreover, as demonstrated by table 2.3, eight festival names in the Nahua and Zapotec twenty-day festivals have close semantic correspondences with one another. Three Mexica and Zapotec festivals correspond to each other, but are not\n\n28\n\nz ap otec and nahua c ycles af ter the conque s t\n\nfigure 2.2. Two Zapotec year festivals in Manual 98. Ministerio de Cultura y Deporte. Archivo General de Indias. México 882, 1551r.\n\nin the same order in their respective years. The Mexica Feast 1, Izcalli (Rebirth) has a semantic correlate in Zapotec Festival 3, Tzegag (It Is Becoming Green);73 Festival 5, Huey Tozoztli (Great Vigil) is echoed by Festival 6, Gabenàa, the potential form of the Valley Zapotec verb -peennáa, “to be alert, to have a vigil at night.”74 Finally, the name of Mexica Festival 15, Quecholli (Macaw) closely resembles that of Zapotec Festival 4, Lohuee (Parrot Feathers).75 More importantly, the positions for Festivals 7 and 10 to 13 are occupied in the Zapotec and pre-reform Nahua years by celebrations whose names strongly resemble each other. Feast 7 in both the Nahua and Zapotec years references eating and sustenance, as it is Etzalcualiztli (Eating of Bean Stew) and Golagoo (Sustainer).76 A focus on gifting is implied by Festival 10, Tlaxochimaco (Flowers Are Given) and Gonaa (Oﬀering). Festival 11 refers to fruits, as it is named in Zapotec Gaha (Fruit),77 and in Nahuatl Xocotlhuetzi (Fruit Falls), while Festival 12 is Tina (It Will Be Cleaned)78 or Ochpaniztli (Sweeping of Roads). Finally, Festival 13 is Pachtli (Spanish Moss)79 Ecoztli (Yellow Beans), a phrase whose second component semantically aligns with the Zapotec period Zaha (Beans).80 Such close correspondence between the positions of Zapotec and Nahua year periods 7, 10, 11, 12, and 13 also suggests that the Zapotec year periods were in synchrony with those of a Nahua year that began on Izcalli. As the\n\n29\n\nre thinking z ap otec time\n\nnext section demonstrates, there is strong evidence that the Nahua year began on Izcalli before a calendrical reform recorded in the Codex Borbonicus, and traceable through dates in the Florentine Codex and Chimalpahin’s annals. Several Zapotec year period names are echoed by festival names in other Mesoamerican calendars. The Tiltepec Year Count’s ﬁrst year period, of cardinal importance for collective celebrations, was Tohuà (Maguey) and the second was Hui Tao, either “Great Humidity” or “Great Illness.”81 The Chiapanec calendar in Albornoz’s 1691 Chiapanec grammar listed Ñumbi (Plant Maguey) and Haumé (Humid) as third and ﬁfth year periods, while the second and twelfth periods in the Chiapanec Nimigua-Tia Suchiapa calendar were Ñumbi and Topia (Humidity Rises).82 In 1936 and 1938, the Weitlaners compiled a list of eighteen month names in Mazatec and Chinantec. This year count had changed in colonial times, as it began on January 1. As Festival 11 in both Nahua and Zapotec years is associated with fruit, it is not surprising that Mazatec Period 7, chiatò and its variants, also refers to fruit, as does Chinantec Period 14. Moreover, Zapotec Period 14, Zachi (Fat),83 is echoed by Mazatec Period 8, chiumahe and variants, which refer to he (Fat) or mahé (Getting Fat).84 Lastly, ﬁve Zapotec year festivals have more ambivalent relations to other traditions: Period 8, Cheag, “It Will Be Tied” or “It Will Be Filled”;85 Period 9, Gogaa, “Nine”; Period 15, Zohuao, “It Can Eat” or “It Can Be Bloody”;86 Period 16, Yetilla, “It Will Fight”;87 Period 17, Yecho, “Blister.”88 The last period, Gohui, “Exchange,”89 is named after an important ritual protocol discussed in chapter 6. The Tiltepec Year Count and Manuals 98 and 94 address a silence in the sources regarding the structure of the Zapotec year. Córdova did not describe the yza in detail in either his dictionary or his grammar, even if he recorded the 260-day count in the latter imprint. In his 1674 Geográﬁca descripción, the Dominican chronicler Francisco de Burgoa stated that the Zapotec year began on March 12, without specifying his source. March 12 coincided with the beginning of the yza only in 1624–1627, according to the AGI México 882 corpus. Burgoa’s choice for the ﬁrst day of the Zapotec year may have been inﬂuenced by an earlier account by Pedro de los Ríos, who stated in the sixteenth century that the Mixtec year began on March 16.90 Burgoa also observed that the Zapotecs called their year’s ﬁnal period “a month that was small, disconcerted, and a remainder of the other ones,” and erroneously argued that a leap-year correction was made every four years.91 His curiously anthropomorphic label for a time period is, indeed, a literal translation of the verb -ttola or -cholla, “to be disconcerted, out of sorts, clumsy, disoriented.”92 Burgoa recorded only one element of a couplet that\n\n30\n\nz ap otec and nahua c ycles af ter the conque s t\n\ndesignated the year-ending period in Zapotec. The second verb of the couplet is -yeni or -ieanij, “to be angry,” and it also appears in the translation of Moteuczoma’s Zapotec name, coquì piyèni làchi, “Lord Who Was Angry,” which in Nahuatl meant “He Is Angry Like a Lord.”93 Both verbs were used in Manual 94, which was copied by Juan de Santiago, an extremely knowledgeable daykeeper from Yagneri:94 naha tza lones 26 tza lasa beo febrero rittola rehenii tza sabado ribee biyee Yohoxo quito Ysaa, “now is the day Monday 26, the day of the turn of the month of February, they are disconcerted and angry, on the day Saturday the time period 5-Earthquake sits itself, one year”; Nahaha tzaa biyeernes lasa beo Marzio riitola reheyeni tza Miercules reesi laasa biiyee cualaa quitoo yza, “now is the day Friday, on the turn of the month of March they are disconcerted and angry, on the day Wednesday the time period 6-Wind takes a turn.” This note refers to two periods at the end of the year: The ﬁrst phrase addressed Monday, February 26, to Friday, March 2, 1663, the last ﬁve days of Year 4-Soaproot, and noted that Year 5-Earthquake began on a Saturday (March 3, 1663). The second phrase located the ﬁve-day terminal period by citing its ﬁrst day—Friday, February 26—and the month on which it ended—Tuesday, March 1, 1664— and recorded the beginning of Year 6-Wind on Wednesday, March 2, 1664.95 The Tiltepec Year Count changed the habitual preﬁ x ri- employed in Manual 98 to the potential qui-, and recorded the phrase qui-cholla, “[the days] will be disconcerted,” referring to ﬁve of the last six days in the year, and quieainij, “[the day] will be angry,” in reference to the year’s ﬁnal day.\n\nna hua a nd europe a n y e a r cor r el a t ions in si x t een t h- c en t u r y s ou rc es Nahua year periods and their correlation with European time have occupied observers since the 1520s.

Sahagún and González/San Buenaventura embody the Atl Cahualo/Cuahuitlehua, or Jiménez Moreno’s Cuitlahuac tradition. Did Nahua and Zapotec years, which lasted only 365 days, employ a correction? Early observers, familiar with the Julian calendar’s leap-year correction, noted the absence of such an adjustment. Motolinia observed that Natives “began their year at the beginning of March at the time when this land was won. . . . Since they did not claim a leap year, their year would change over all the months.”98 In 1552, Gómara became the ﬁrst chronicler to make\n\n33\n\nre thinking z ap otec time\n\nsuch an observation in print: “They could not help but go about in error with this count, which could not equal the punctual cycle of the sun.”99 Henrico Martínez, author of the 1606 Reportorio de los tiempos, the ﬁrst almanac published in New Spain, concurred with Motolinia and Gómara, noting that natives “did not have knowledge about the leap year. . . . Some say the Indians began their year in January, and others, in February. They are all correct, because, due to the period of almost six hours that the year has beyond 365 days, every four years their year begins almost one day earlier.”100 Hypothetical leap-year corrections were conﬂated with the ﬁve nemontemi days. Gómara remarked these “loose” days resembled intercalary days, and the Tovar Calendar (157r) noted that nemontemi days were “useless, as in a leap year of sorts, but every year.” In his 1656 Manual de ministros de Indias, Jacinto de la Serna stated that Natives “had no notice regarding leap years,” but proposed they inserted “thirteen intercalary days” at the end of a 52-year cycle, an interpretation Lorenzo Boturini echoed.101 Sahagún was ambivalent regarding a Nahua leap-year correction. In Book 2, he placed the nemontemi on the ﬁ xed dates January 28–February 1, right before the ﬁrst period, Atl Cahualo, on February 2. He also noted, “There is a conjecture that, when they would pierce boys’ and girls’ ears, which took place every four years, they would put in six days of nemontemi, and it is the same as the leap year that we have every four years.”102 As for the Zapotec year, Burgoa boldly asserted that every four years an extra day was inserted in a ﬁnal “month” of ﬁve days,103 but the Tiltepec Year Count demonstrates he was in error. Other scholars claim that the eighteen periods in the Central Mexican year had originally aligned with the solar year. Michel Graulich calculated that the Nahua year was introduced in 682 CE, when it was in alignment with solar events, while Johanna Broda proposed that feasts continued to be aligned with the seasons.104 While contemporary scholars have proposed various possibilities for corrections that mimic European leap-year corrections, there is no decisive proof of their preconquest use.105 As for the Gregorian reform of the Julian calendar, a change in the calendar was ﬁrst approved at the Council of Trent in 1545. After a careful consideration of various proposals, on February 24, 1582, Pope Gregory VIII announced this reform in his bull Inter gravissimas. Dates were moved forward ten days: October 4 was immediately followed by October 15, 1582. The Gregorian adjustment maintained the Julian leap-year correction every four years, except for each century year not divisible by 400. This change helped account for the solar year’s average length, which is 365.242 days, rather than 365.25.106 In New Spain, this transition was carried out on October 15, 1583, as speciﬁed by a May 1583 order from Philip II publicized by Archbishop Moya de Contreras.107\n\n34\n\nz ap otec and nahua c ycles af ter the conque s t\n\nSahagún and Chimalpahin as Sources for Caso’s Correlation In an exacting study of Mesoamerican calendars, Prem argued that the variations among sources regarding correlations stemmed from misunderstandings, varying local traditions, and calendars “frozen” on a single European year. Nonetheless, four of ﬁve sources in table 2.4 are in synchrony with the most widely accepted correlation, proposed by Caso in 1939. Caso’s “equation” held that 8-Wind in the 260-day count and 9th of Quecholli in the year count aligned with Cortés’s entrance into Tenochtitlan on November 8, 1519. As Nahua annalist Chimalpahin noted, Cortés ﬁrst met Moteuczoma “on the feast count of 8-Wind, and on the past moon count of the elder ones, who nine-celebrate Quecholli.”108 Similar correlation statements also appear in Anales Históricos, Anales de Tula, Castillo, and Sahagún, and most Nahua sources reported that Cortés arrived in the year 1-Reed (1519–1520). The date Tenochtitlan was defeated by Indigenous and Spanish armies appears as a second correlation: the sixteenth-century source Historia de Tlatelolco recorded it as Year 3-House, Day 1-Snake, and Chimalpahin echoed these dates for August 13, 1521.109 A one-day adjustment is needed to make these two statements mutually consistent. Caso thought the discrepancy came from the fact that Nahuas counted days from noon to noon—thus, 8-Wind began at noon, November 8, and ended on November 9 at noon. Cline countered that the ﬁrst Moteuczoma-Cortés meeting occurred on November 9, not November 8, a possibility that Caso also embraced.110 The classic version of Caso’s correlation—8-Wind as November 8–9, 1519—is compatible with three of four stated correlations in table 2.4. As Prem noted, although the Tovar Calendar and Sahagún’s Primeros memoriales begin the xihuitl on diﬀerent festivals, both sources record the start of Tlacaxipehualiztli on February 26. In Caso’s correlation, this date would be valid for Julian years 1549–1552. Since the Gregorian adjustment modiﬁed the correlation between Nahua and European years, Tovar’s February 26 date also agrees with Caso’s correlation during four Gregorian years, 1589–1592.111 Sahagún’s discrepancy for the start of the xihuitl in Primeros memoriales (February 6) and Book 2 of the Florentine Codex (February 2), composed in the 1560s, is easily explained: while February 6 is valid for 1549–1552, the second one, February 2, corresponds to 1565–1568, and thus the apparent discrepancy reﬂects the times when Sahagún edited these two works: Primeros memoriales ﬁrst, Book 2 later.112 Therefore, the asynchrony between the Tlacaxipehualiztli and Atl Cahualo traditions in these sources is only apparent: while Sahagún stated the xihuitl began on Atl Cahualo, Gómara and Tovar insisted it began one period later, on Tlacaxipehualiztli, but all give dates in agreement with Caso’s "
