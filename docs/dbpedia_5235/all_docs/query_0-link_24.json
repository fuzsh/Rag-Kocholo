It all began one very hot afternoon in December 1969 in the Barrio Santa María in Tehuantepec, Oaxaca. Relaxing in the Escobar family’s home just before a big family wedding, I met the eminent Oaxacan sociologist Jorge Martínez Ríos. Upon learning that I had a B.A. in history, he began an unrelenting campaign to persuade me to investigate Oaxacan history, and he mentored me until his untimely death in 1974. My friend and cousin, Eloy García Aguilar, joined in this chorus with Jorge throughout our years at the National University. But I did not turn to Oaxaca as a subject of study until 1982, when Eloy arranged for me to bring my students from the Universidad Metropolitana in Mexico City to Tlacolula to organize its incredibly rich municipal archive. I was hooked. From my Wrst trip to Oaxaca, Tía Tila, Eloy’s mother, Rutila Aguilar, took me into her home in Tlacolula with the greatest hospitality. Much of what I know of rural Oaxaca and village life comes from tagging along with her to markets, mills, and Welds. She translated Zapotec and had inWnite patience as she showed me how to cook Oaxacan style. I had married Moisés López Garnica, now my ex-husband, in October 1969, and I owe my love for Oaxaca to him and to my former mother-in-law, Emilia Garnica Díaz, who regaled the family with wonderful tales of her childhood in Tehuantepec, Yautepec, and Tlacolula. But it was Dr. Enrique Florescano who encouraged me to work on the PorWriato as a graduate student, when it was still extremely unpopular at UNAM. He convinced me that it was time to reevaluate this period, mentored me, and directed my doctoral thesis. I am profoundly grateful for his extraordinary intellectual guidance, unstinting support, sage advice, and friendship over the years. For the past two decades I have been privileged to work with an amazing team of Oaxacan social scientists: Anselmo Arellanes Meixueiro, Víctor Raúl Martínez Vásquez, Francisco José Ruiz Cervantes, and Carlos\n\nxii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nSánchez Silva. They are my intellectual family, lending me invaluable materials and spending innumerable hours at meetings and meals (and cantinas) discussing the history of Oaxaca. I am eternally grateful to them, for they have become the hermanos I never had. Héctor Martínez collaborated with us on various projects and I appreciate his support during those years. Angeles Romero Frizzi and Manuel Esparza have been generous with their friendship, sources, and critiques. Víctor de la Cruz has also encouraged my work on Oaxaca. Lucero Topete, Wrst as director of the state archives and later as director of the INAH, Centro Regional Oaxaca, has been a wonderful friend and intellectual support since the Wrst day I arrived to do research. All those afternoons, sitting on the patio chatting with Lic. Luis Castañeda Guzmán, were priceless. Don Luis gave unstintingly of his insights, knowledge, and personal archival materials. Don Angel Taracena (and his daughter, Doña Mercedes) and Don Basilio Rojas both shared their personal archives and time unsparingly. During his term as oWcial mayor of the state government, Lic. Heliodoro Díaz Escárraga gave me total support to investigate in the state archives. I am grateful to the many people, some of whom have passed on, who in diverse ways have contributed to this project over the years. In Oaxaca, for their help in so many aspects of this research: Manuel Castro Rivadeneyra, Guillermo Villa Castañeda, Augusto García Moguel, Governor Manuel Zárate Aquino, Roque Carrasco, Cecil Welte, Fidel López Carrasco, Doña Gloria Larrumbe, Claudio Sánchez, and Guillermo Rangel Rojas.

I am particularly grateful to those who extended their hand to me when I Wrst returned to the United States in 1986, among them Steve Stein and Howard Rock in Miami, and Ray Mohl, Fritz Schwaller and the History Department at Florida Atlantic University, who welcomed me and integrated me into their intellectual life. During my undergraduate education at Vassar College in the late 1960s, William Gifford sparked my passion for literature and encouraged me to pursue Latin American history. Although he had retired by the time I arrived, Charles GrifWn cultivated this interest and graciously read and commented on all my papers. In my senior year, David Schalk arrived as a new assistant professor and opened up the world of intellectual history to me. He has been an inspiration and mentor ever since.\n\nxiv\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI am beholden to two other remarkable institutions. The Facultad de Filosofía y Letras of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México awarded me a teaching assistantship in Latin American Studies, which permitted me to do my doctorate. It was an amazing time to be at UNAM in the 1970s. I was deeply honored to become part of the faculty, in 1976, of the oldest university in all the Americas. I moved to the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, Unidad Iztapalapa, in 1981. During the spring quarters of 1982 and 1983, the UAM–I commissioned me to work in Oaxaca, organizing and classifying both state and municipal archives in connection with a tripartite agreement with the Archivo General del Estado de Oaxaca and the Archivo General de la Nación. Needless to say, my colleagues, and above all my students, at both institutions have helped me immeasurably to understand Mexico. Many thanks to my splendid research assistants. In Oaxaca, Nimcy Arellanes has given unsparingly of her time. At the University of Kentucky, Hayward Wilkirson, Renee Lazard, and Capt. Kevin Gibson assisted me on different occasions. Many thanks to Matt McCourt, who worked tirelessly on the maps and did a fantastic job. I am also indebted to Sallie Powell and the folks at the University of Kentucky Medical Arts and Photography Lab, who made wonderful reproductions of some of the photos. In addition, I am grateful to be able to publish photos from the Archivo General de la Nación, Instituto de Artes GráWca de Oaxaca, and the Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley. I deeply appreciate the care and patience of many librarians and archivists, especially my cuates at the Archivo General del Poder Ejecutivo del Estado de Oaxaca. At the Archivo General de la Nación, I am very thankful for the support of Juan Manuel Herrera, Armando Rojas, and many others. I am indebted to the Colección PorWrio Díaz of the Universidad Iberoamericana, especially María Eugenia Ponce, for permission to research and quote from the papers of PorWrio Díaz. Equally I am grateful to Fondo Manuel Brioso y Candiani (the gracious help of Cristina Jarquín when it was in the Escuela de Derecho), the Hemeroteca, and the Biblioteca Francisco Burgoa of the Convento de Santo Domingo of the Universidad Autónoma “Benito Juarez” de Oaxaca, especially the director, my dear friend, María Isabel Grañen Porrúa, the Hemeroteca Pública de Oaxaca, especially Néstor Sánchez, la Biblioteca and Hemeroteca de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, el Instituto Nacional de Estudios Históricos de la Revolución Mexicana, el Centro de Estudios\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxv\n\nde Historia de México Condumex, la Biblioteca del Colegio de México, la Biblioteca and Hemeroteca of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, the Biblioteca of the Dirección de Estudios Históricos del INAH, the Library of Congress, and the Bancroft Library of the University of California at Berkeley. In Kentucky, I am particularly appreciative of Judy Fugate of Collections Development for all her generous help in searching for materials over the years. Many thanks to our superbly efWcient and cordial Inter-Library Loan Department. I also thank my two anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments. And special thanks go to Sandy Thatcher, director of Penn State University Press, for his constant support, patience, and understanding through some very difWcult times. In 1988 I moved to Lexington, and I have received generous support from the University of Kentucky. The University of Kentucky Research Fund and the Graduate School have funded numerous trips to Mexico to continue my research. My colleagues in the Department of History, the Latin American Studies Program, and the Women’s Studies Program have commented on various articles and chapters. My students at the University of Kentucky all can locate Oaxaca on any map, and many of them have visited and fallen in love with my patria chica. Their lively enthusiasm has been my inspiration. In Lexington I have been fortunate to be part of a group of people who have become my family. They have been exceptionally supportive and encouraging and have learned to love Mexican food and Oaxaca. They have seen me through the darkest days with good cheer and extraordinary care.

For all those newspapers articles she copied for me and the interviews she helped me with, this is her inheritance. Nothing is more rewarding to me than her love for Oaxaca.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn April 6, 1896, Chatino Indians attacked the district capital of Juquila in the coastal region of the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca. Numbering some one thousand, they protested against a new tax law as they swept through the area sacking and pillaging. Shouting “Death to all who wear pants,” they struck out violently against the gente decente (whites and mestizos dressed in European garb). They burned the town hall and the judicial archives. They beheaded twenty-two townspeople with machetes, among them two judges, the jefe político (prefect), the municipal president, and other ofWcials. They put the head of the town telegrapher, Liborio Pimentel, on a pike that they paraded through the streets. Ildefonso Zorrilla and Carlos Morales (a visitor to the district) also lost their lives, as did some local merchants whose stores were sacked. The rebels communicated with other Chatino communities, urging them to join in the extermination of the catrines (the fancy dressers). Fearing a caste war, Governor Martín González immediately dispatched the army’s Fourth Battalion, which only recaptured Juquila on April 18. The army’s bloody retaliation included the execution of thirty Chatinos and the exile of many others to Quintana Roo, Mexico’s tropical Siberia.1 The governor then appointed lawyer Carlos Woolrich as Juquila’s new jefe político. He decreed that anyone entering a town under his jurisdiction was henceforth forbidden to wear indigenous dress. Huipiles (indigenous women’s blouses) and camisa y calzón de manta (rough cotton tops and bottoms for men) would no longer be tolerated. Everyone had to dress European-style or be punished. This ruling spawned a new enterprise in Juquila: merchants set up stands at town entrances to rent shoes, jackets, and pants to Indians going to market. To this day, the rebellion is remembered on the Costa as “The War of the Pants.” 1. This uprising is analyzed in Chapter 8 and the appropriate sources are cited there. A caste war refers to the colonial caste system and indicates a race war. All translations in this study are the author’s unless otherwise noted.\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe image of enterprising merchants renting European-style clothing and shoes to Chatinos on their way to market in Juquila in the late 1890s symbolizes the power and Xexibility of negotiation. Some might interpret this “fashion war” between Western clothing and customary indigenous dress as a major collision between liberal modernizing projects and traditional Mesoamerican communities. The story, however, is far more complicated. The tax law threatened small parcels of private property valued at less than $100,2 which previously had not been taxed. The division and privatization of communal land had just been carried out the year before in Juquila. Thus Chatinos lashed out not only against years of discrimination and exploitation but also against the threat to their newly titled properties. They achieved their objective when the governor rapidly revoked the controversial articles in the tax law, and they continued to wear their traditional dress (except in the district capital) despite the new decree. The close examination of confrontations such as the “War of the Pants” permits us to transcend rigid dichotomies of civilization and barbarism so often applied to these actors. Although at times they appeared to be irreconcilably opposed worlds, the encounter of Mexican liberals’ modernizing projects3 with Oaxacan society, especially the indigenous communal villages, exposes not only their conXicts but also their growing linkages and dependencies. In the following pages we will see them engaging with and transforming each other in an ongoing process of contestation, negotiation, and, sometimes, compromise.4 Far from being a facile shibboleth, this approach, with its focus on the dialectic of local, regional, state, and national history, permits us to disentangle the threads of continuity and change over four decades of Oaxacan history, from the triumph of liberalism in 1867 to the opening days of the Revolution in June 1911. Early liberals in the 1820s commenced independent Mexico’s elusive love affair with modernity. They rashly embraced the ideals of the Enlightenment (the belief in reason, science, and technology), convinced that 2. The $ denotes pesos throughout this study. Dollar amounts will be speciWcally noted. 3. There was no one liberal project to modernize Mexico, but various projects. For example, some emphasized education more than others. Elite ideologies were not monolithic. In his study of class, gender, and ethnicity over the long durée in Guatemala, Greg Grandin demonstrates the existence of various elite discourses of the nation of both ladino and K’iche elites. See Grandin, Blood of Guatemala, 13, 128ff. 4. This type of analysis has been used previously; see, for example, Wells and Joseph, Summer of Discontent; Purnell, Popular Movements and State Formation, and the essays in Joseph and Nugent’s edited volume, Everyday Forms of State Formation.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nEuropean civilization would eventually triumph over American barbarism. In order to confront the legacies of three hundred years of authoritarian Spanish corporatism and the communal traditions of Mesoamerica, they rejected their past and shouldered the tasks of what they called modernization.5 For them, modernity signiWed the decline of traditional orders based on rigid hierarchies sustained by religious authority, and the building of modern nation-states and rational, secular capitalist societies populated by dynamic social classes engaged in material progress embodied in the ideas of liberalism. Economic liberalism as ideology as well as public policy proposed to lift restraints in order to facilitate the expansion of a free market. European political economists developed the theory of comparative advantage to explain the division of the world into industrial and agro-exporting nations. Colombian Treasury minister Florentino González expressed the position of many liberal elites in 1847: “Europe, with an intelligent population, and with the possession of steam power and its applications, and educated in the art of manufacturing, fulWlls its mission in the industrial world by giving various forms to raw materials.” Thus the nations of Latin America should not attempt to encourage industry but rather concentrate on carrying out “our mission, and there is no doubt as to what it is, if we consider the profusion of natural resources with which Providence has endowed this land. We should offer Europe raw materials and open our doors to her manufactures.”6 Nevertheless, as the nineteenth century advanced, larger Latin American nations such as Mexico and Colombia took an interest in stimulating their domestic industries and modiWed their policies to include some protective tariffs. 5. Harvey, Condition of Postmodernity, 9; see Hall’s synthesis of modernity in the introduction to Modernity, 8. Néstor García Canclini divided modernity into four basic movements: (1) the emancipating project, which necessitates secularization, increasing individualism, and the rationalization of society; (2) the expansive project, which encompasses the desire to expand society’s knowledge in science, technology, and control of nature, and the production and consumption of commodities based on the proWt motive; (3) the renovating project, which includes the relentless pursuit of “innovation proper to a relation to nature and society that is liberated from all sacred prescription over how the world must be” and “the need to continually reformulate the signs of distinction that mass consumption wears away”; and (4) the democratizing project, which entails an undying belief in the efWcacy of education, art, and “specialized knowledge to achieve rational and moral evolution.” García Canclini, Hybrid Cultures, 12–13. Justo Sierra characterized the Mexican Liberal Reform as a struggle against Spain and the colonial regime in Juárez. 6. Love and Jacobsen, Guiding the Invisible Hand, vii. Florentino González quoted in Nieto Arteta, Economía y cultura en la historia de Colombia, 188.\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nLiberalism also encompassed the political philosophy of republicanism, democratic values, and individual civil rights.7 Yet, if in the United States, Britain, and France, this philosophy emerged from a capitalist society, in Mexico the reverse occurred. “Liberalism in Mexico appeared as a program before it could be grounded in reality or historical experience,” wrote Mexican philosopher Abelardo Villegas.8 Therefore, Mexican liberals faced what they saw as the revolutionary task of transforming reality and molding national identity. But not until 1867, after forty years of political and economic turmoil, wars with Conservative foes, and foreign invasions, were triumphant Liberals able to devote their full energies to building this modern Mexico.9 The presidents who guided the liberal project, Benito Juárez (1858–72) and PorWrio Díaz (1876–80, 1884–1911), were both born in the southern state of Oaxaca. Yet scholars and politicians alike have characterized Oaxaca as the antithesis of modernity. Given its imposing mountain ranges and majority indigenous population, they have assumed it to be “backward,” impenetrable by modernity. After 1910, historians of the Mexican Revolution branded Oaxaca as inherently conservative and PorWrista or ignored it altogether. Had Oaxaca been an enemy of the Revolution?10 Was it “passive” and “reactionary,” 7. Perry, Juárez and Díaz, 3, 341. 8. Abelardo Villegas, Filosofía, 91. Geoff Eley also noted this phenomenon: “The encounter with Revolutionary France . . . not only gave sympathetic intellectuals in more ‘backward’ societies a new political language for articulating their own aspirations, it also allowed them to conceptualize their situations as ‘backwardness’ to begin with . . . [but] it was stimulated from the outside rather than being the spontaneous outgrowth of indigenous social development, in response to backwardness rather than progress.” “Nations, Publics, and Political Cultures” 309. 9. Daniel Cosío Villegas considered the Restored Republic (1867–76) and the PorWriato (1876–1910) “two distinct moments of a single epoch” of the “modern” history of Mexico. “Between one and the other there is no break in continuity, and less, much less, an historical break.” Cosío Villegas, Llamadas, 106; see also Hale, “Daniel Cosío Villegas,” 7–8; Cosío Villegas’s multivolume Historia Moderna de México. This was also the term used at the time; Mrs. Alec Tweedie’s 1906 biography of the president was entitled The Maker of Modern Mexico: PorWrio Díaz. The present study understands the nineteenth century to encompass the period 1810 to 1910. 10. In 1955 Jorge Fernando Iturribarría published Oaxaca en la historia with precisely the objective of “demonstrating to the public opinion of Oaxaca and the Mexican nation, the unjustly propagated fallacy—which has caused so much damage—that we Oaxacans have always been enemies of the Mexican Revolution.” Oaxacan scholar-politicians Jorge Tamayo and, later, Alfonso Francisco Ramírez tackled the same problem with a similar lack of success. See Iturribarría, Oaxaca en la historia, x; Tamayo, Oaxaca en el siglo XX; Ramírez, Historia de la Revolución Mexicana en Oaxaca. The term PorWriato, which is\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nas often portrayed?11 Inhabited by “passive” peasants who were “immunized against the epidemic of progress,” had it been “bypassed by the tides of modernization?”12 Did it truly maintain “the image of a backward, provincial society, resistant to change?”13 These characterizations reduced discussions of Oaxaca either to its “backward” Indian population or to its “reactionary” government elites, or both. Why and how had this “Black Legend” of Oaxaca emerged?14\n\ncommonly used today to refer to the dictatorship of PorWrio Díaz, has negative connotations. PorWrismo was the term employed during Díaz’s regime and by later admirers. 11. In 1975 anthropologist Ronald Waterbury labeled the peasants of Oaxaca “passive” and “reactionary” in a comparison with the Zapatista peasants of Morelos during the Revolution, (see his “Non-revolutionary Peasants”). Although this article (the only one on the subject available in English for more than a decade) analyzed the peasants of the Central Valleys, it reinforced the backwardness thesis. Other scholars employed Waterbury’s characterization to refer to all of Oaxaca. Thus did the “backward” and “reactionary” image of Oaxaca become common currency in Mexican history. See Jacobs, Ranchero Revolt, ix, xx; Brading, “Introduction,” 15; Tutino, From Insurrection to Revolution, 320–21; Wasserman, “Provinces of the Revolution,” 6; LaFrance, “Regional Nature of Maderismo,” 25; Beezley, “Conclusion,” 294. John Hart integrated Oaxaca into his Revolutionary Mexico more than others, but he still gave currency to these stereotypes. Alan Knight included Oaxaca in The Mexican Revolution and later criticized the use of the “crude dichotomy” between revolutionary and nonrevolutionary peasants in “Weapons and Arches,” 41. 12. Ruiz, Great Rebellion, 23. Steven Topik and Allen Wells’s recent study of commodities in Latin America used Oaxaca as an example of a region of southern Mexico that developed “few ties to the international economy.” Topik and Wells, “Introduction,” 10. Wells and Joseph inveigh against the characterization of the henequen peon as passive lumpen as a “gross exaggeration.” Wells and Joseph, Summer of Discontent, 143. 13. Paul Garner’s other early studies of the Sovereignty Movement declared that during the PorWriato there were no “dramatic transformations in either the predominant agricultural mode of production or in the system of land tenure, nor in the form of political or social organizations in the state” (“Federalism and Caudillismo,” 117). See also his “Autoritarismo revolucionario” and Revolución en la provincia. He later recognized “substantial growth in the export sector,” but few others have followed suit; see Regional Development in Oaxaca. More recently Garner has argued that the indigenous peoples were not “resistant to change” and that Oaxaca was not “backward.” PorWrio Díaz, 22–23, 202. Yet Colin Clarke’s recent monograph on Oaxaca still considers it one of the “most backward” states of Mexico. Clarke, Class, Ethnicity, and Community, 37. 14. Mexican Indians have often been depicted as “picturesque individuals who are set in their ways, exotic, poor and downtrodden.” Although anthropologists have criticized these stereotypes, they have formulated new representations of Indians as “exploited peasants, oppressed proletarians, or from another standpoint, the bearers of rich cultural traditions and languages, but the victims of discrimination by mestizos and bureaucrats.” Either way, the Indians come out as “losers.” See Campbell, Zapotec Renaissance, xv. “Black Legend” (the negative history of Spanish rule in the Americas) is from Ruiz Cervantes, “Oaxaca: ¿campesinos no revolucionarios?” 28ff. I have called this the “myth of the passive peasant.” See Chassen [Chassen-López], “¿Capitalismo o comunalismo?”\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nThese questions about my adopted patria chica confounded me no end as a graduate student at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México in the 1970s and later as a professor and investigator of Mexican history, Wrst in Mexico and then in the United States. As a result, I initiated this study in order to answer three central questions: (1) Did Presidents Juárez and Díaz neglect their own state in their drive toward modernization? (2) Did indigenous peoples of Oaxaca act as an obstacle to “progress”? and (3) Had Oaxaca remained at the margins of the Mexican Revolution? I was most perplexed to discover that the ways in which I had been taught to view southern Mexico, and to frame questions, were fatally Xawed. I found myself asking over and over again: What was I missing? What had I been taught to overlook?15 My doctoral dissertation, Oaxaca: Del PorWriato a la Revolución, 1902–1911 (UNAM 1986) began to supply some tentative answers, although I now disagree with many of its conclusions. It was clear that I had to look at a longer period to get at the roots of these questions, and thus I directed my research further into the nineteenth century. Along the way, these queries were modiWed and many more were added. The present book, based on extensive research in state, national, and private archives over two decades, is the Wrst monograph, in English or Spanish, to provide some answers to those questions. It is also designed to open up new avenues of research for others.\n\nAn Insurgent Reading of History Undoubtedly, the stereotyping of Oaxaca can partially be attributed to the scarcity of research on this period. Nonetheless, I began to discern political motives lurking behind its misrepresentation. For nineteenth-century liberals, modernization implicitly denoted de-Indianization, the assimilation of the indigenous population into a Mexican national identity.16 15. See the work of Arturo Escobar, Encountering Development, and “Imagining a PostDevelopment Era?” 16. Leticia Reina Aoyama has researched Mexican ethnohistory for more than twenty years, noting that the focus on the nineteenth century is “relatively new” and that there is enormous work yet to be done on that ethnohistory. She has also emphasized nineteenthcentury regimes’ desire to erase indigenous culture by “negation,” “liquidation,” and Wnally “integration” into the national mestizo identity. Reina Aoyama, “Autonomía indígena,” 338–40.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nOaxaca has historically been the state with the highest and most diverse indigenous population (sixteen distinct ethnicities) in Mexico. These groups have fought tenaciously to retain what they refer to as their tradiciones (or usos) y costumbres desde tiempos inmemoriales (traditions and customs since time immemorial), which encompass not only their lived experience but also their worldview. Oaxaca has represented the indigenous face that “modern” Mexico has not wanted to see in the mirror. The late Guillermo BonWl Batalla reproached us: “There is an attempt to hide and ignore the Indian face of Mexico because no real connection with Mesoamerican civilization is admitted. The clear and undeniable evidence of our Indian ancestry is a mirror in which we do not wish to see our own reXection.”17 The present study returns that face to the mirror. Only by shifting our perspective to view history from the south, instead of from El Centro (Mexico City and its environs, the proverbial center of historical vision), can we detect that Oaxaca has been typecast in the role of the foil: antimodern, backward, barbarous, and reactionary. The Mexico that has wanted to be seen as modern, capitalist, and revolutionary has deWned itself in opposition to traditional, indigenous southern Mexico. Time was linear, societies that were not modern and future-oriented were frozen in a “traditional” or premodern time.18 As modernity’s negative mirror image, Oaxaca has also doubled as villain, representing the backwardness that posed the major obstacle to the progress of modern Mexico. Only an “insurgent reading” of historical works and documents, as proposed by Gyan Prakash for subaltern histories of India,19 might liberate Oaxaca from the disciplinary categories of dominant histories. The present study undertakes such an insurgent reading to read across the grain and see all social categories as contingent on their historical context. My methodology shows the inXuence of political economy, feminism, subaltern 17. BonWl Batalla, Mexico Profundo, 18, 168. 18. This knowledge was used to construct “meta-narratives (large-scale theoretical interpretations purportedly of universal application).” Harvey, Condition of Postmodernity, 9ff., 205. See Fabian, Time and the Other, 31ff. Of course, there have always been indigenous peoples in northern and central Mexico (Nahuas, Yaquis, Otomíes, etc.) but they have rarely appeared in the mirror of modern Mexico. 19. Prakash, “Writing Post-Orientalist Histories,” 369ff., and “Introduction,” 5ff. As much as I am indebted to India’s Subaltern Studies authors, I am wary of the term subaltern, which tends to mask differences of gender, class, and ethnicity. I am grateful to my colleague Paola Bacchetta for suggesting the above works by Prakash.\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nstudies, and poststructuralism, while it strives for an engaging narrative that keeps buzzwords to a minimum.20 Through the descriptive analysis of how particular processes unfold, it uncovers the interdependence, ambiguities, and heterogeneities that in turn deconstruct stereotypes, foils, and simplistic binaries. Although I have tried to use the terms “modern” and “modernization” in reference to the goals as liberals themselves deWned them, and “tradition” with respect to the frequent indigenous allusions to usos y costumbres, I confess that these terms have surfaced in my own analysis also. Framed as the struggle between civilization and barbarism by early nineteenth-century liberals, the opposition was soon reformulated as the contest between the modern and the traditional. In the twentieth century, these categories have undergirded the formulation of both modernization and dependency theories, as they inspired the opposition between development and underdevelopment. Therefore, we Wnd ourselves continually deconstructing this same dichotomy as it emerges in different guises.21 Patricia Hill Collins observed that “race, class, and gender oppression could not continue without powerful ideological justiWcations for their existence.” The latter are created through the construction of what she calls controlling images, which encapsulate and maintain interlocking systems of race, ethnic, class, and gender oppression, for example, the welfare mother in the United States or the lazy, backward indio in Latin America. Such “images are designed to make racism, sexism, and poverty appear to be natural, normal, and an inevitable part of everyday life,” thus enabling dominant groups to blame the victim for his or her situation. This is realized through the objectiWcation of people by dichotomous thinking.22 20. I have been caught between generations of historians in what Mary Kay Vaughan denoted as the “shift in paradigms” since the 1980s from fundamentally materialist and structural analysis “to one more sensitive to issues of culture, dispersed power, contingency, and representation.” Vaughan, “Cultural Approaches,” 271–72. See also Dirks, Eley, and Ortner, “Introduction,” 30–31. Buzzwords in vogue are hegemony, discourse, decentering, etc. 21. Post–World War II development and modernization theories applied the terms developed to modern and underdeveloped to traditional societies. However, these theories were elaborated in the context of the Cold War, in the struggle between capitalism and socialism, and their purported goal was the elimination of poverty through the spread of capitalism to the Third World. Thus, to label PorWrismo as developmentalist liberalism, as Alan Knight has (“Liberalismo mexicano,” 66ff.), obscures the origins and crucial political context of development theory. 22. Collins, “Mammies, Matriarchs,” 67–75, and “Knowledge, Politics,” 221ff. “Ideology loves dichotomies,” Nancy Fraser warns us in Unruly Practices, 8.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nGrappling with this problem, feminist scholarship has clariWed how the opposition between male and female underlies other supposedly “natural” binaries. Joan Scott emphasized that feminist analysis is all about contesting meaning: “the introduction of new oppositions, reversal of hierarchies, the attempt to expose repressed terms, to challenge the seemingly natural status of dichotomous pairs, and to expose their interdependence and their internal instability.” The study of the colonial reality of India convinced Gyan Prakash that only the “implacable disWguration” of these categories and the unmasking of the politics of knowledge (sexist, racist, and colonialist) inherent in their construction, will allow hidden histories of subaltern peoples to be released.23 Yet I believe that this is also a dialectical process, whereby those suppressed histories will provide the tools necessary to replace this discursive organization of power. While we can expose the underlying logic of power in language and dismantle these controlling images, I am not so convinced that we can, at least at present, discard all dichotomies, as these buried histories are only now emerging. Language and its meanings are constructed on the basis of difference (“implicit or explicit contrasts”) and exclusions.24 The exclusion of women was fundamental to the conceptualization of modern political and economic thought of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. The modern world they brought forth restructured gender relations by presuming the existence of a male public sphere (of politics and the economy) and a female private sphere (a domestic “nonpolitical” and “noneconomic” space). Resting on previous assumptions about women’s intimate relations to the natural world, to sexuality, and to domesticity, this division led to the formulation of a new political and social construction of masculinity (based on the experience of the white, Western, heterosexual male) in the individual subject of modern society,\n\n23. Scott, “Introduction,” 7–9, “Gender,” 43–48, and “Experience,” all in Butler and Scott, Feminists Theorize the Political. Subaltern Studies scholars have revealed “the relationship between disciplinary knowledges and the colonial and elite-nationalist strategies of power,” according to Prakash, “Introduction,” 3–17, and “Subaltern Studies,” 1485–89. Ashis Nandy dubbed this the “second colonization,” as quoted in Prakash, “Writing PostOrientalist Histories,” 375–80. 24. “Positive deWnitions,” Joan Scott informs us, “rest always, in this view, on the negation or repression of something represented as antithetical to it.” Scott, “Introduction,” 7. It is precisely through these internally hierarchical dichotomies that meaning and power relations of dominance and subordination are constructed, particularly that of the modern and the traditional.\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nfounded on the male domain of reason and law.25 Contesting these static dichotomies, scholars have suggested that we visualize such oppositions as interrelated and Xuid points on a continuum, an analytical category now central to postmodern feminism’s challenge to hierarchical binary opposites. In her study of Mexican women’s political participation, Nikki Craske demonstrated how the concept of a continuum “allows for different degrees of participation between the two extremes and the fact that many activities sit between them.”26 It is in those dynamic and Xuid “in-between spaces” that the concept of hybridity becomes invaluable as another conceptual tool that transcends oppositions. Since the term mestizaje is usually restricted to racial mixing and syncretism has a religious connotation, I agree with Néstor García Canclini that hybridization is preferable because it comprehends distinct “intercultural mixtures” as well as political and economic factors. Homi Bhabha afWrmed that, rather than a mixture of identities or elements, it is instead a moment in which “all forms of cultural meaning are open to translation.” Thus hybridity also reveals “the instability of any division of meaning into an inside and outside.” Of course, any identity or process can be described as hybrid, starting from the fact that we all descend genetically from two very different people. Understood as a consequence of colonial power, the concept of hybridity lets us discern what Bhabha calls the “Wssured character” of national histories, how they are “intersected by other histories, other modes of production, other values and identities.”27 But might not the concepts of hybridity and of a continuum contradict each other? On the contrary, I believe they can work in tandem. For example, we can envision agricultural labor arrangements during this period as Xuid, on a continuum in which they Xow back and forth from the extremes of slavery, in Valle Nacional, to wage labor, on PorWrio Díaz’s highly modern coffee Wnca in Cuicatlán, with many points in between, 25. Eley, “Nations, Publics, and Political Cultures” 312; Marshall, Engendering Modernity, 2ff. 26. Susan Tiano developed this category in order to appreciate the true scope of women’s work in “Public-Private Dichotomy,” 22–24; Craske, “Women’s Political Participation,” 114. Knight also proposed that dualities be understood as points on a continuum (“Weapons and Arches,” 33), while Guardino recommends that we Wnd a way to bridge them in Peasants, Politics, 8. 27. García Canclini, Hybrid Cultures, 11, 206ff.; Bhabha, “DissemiNation,” 314; Beverley, Subalternity and Representation, 16–17, 86ff.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nincluding the production of coffee by communal landholders in Santa María Yucuiti. If we focus on communal landholders, we can detect the combination of elements that produces a hybrid economy. While Oaxacan villages struggled to uphold their versions of communal traditions, far from existing since time immemorial, their usos y costumbres had changed over time. The indigenous peoples did not reject the varied forces of modernity outright but contested, resisted, and negotiated, as well as innovated and translated them to their needs. Accordingly, the concept of hybridity helps resolve the “problematic boundaries of modernity.” Arturo Escobar envisaged a hybrid modernity that does not entail adding and mixing in modern and traditional elements “or a ‘sell-out’ of the traditional to the modern,” but instead “a cultural (re)creation.”28 Thus hybridity allows for creativity and agency by all actors. Nevertheless, I would not go so far as to suggest that the latter resulted in the construction of “alternative modernities” by peasants or subalterns.29 To my knowledge, nineteenth-century Oaxacan campesinos did not propose to imitate elite modernity or invent their own versions, but safeguarded their usos y costumbres as they reformulated them with new ideas or practices that they considered advantageous, such as the cultivation of coffee and the expansion of trade or private property. I develop four interrelated themes throughout the three sections of the book that support this larger argument of contestation and negotiation.\n\nState Formation as Contested Terrain The twin processes of the construction of the nation-state and capitalism have neither been imposed from above nor been monolithic but have been contested terrains. While elites developed their schemes of nation building, state formation involved not only the conWguration of the administrative and repressive sectors of the state, the construction of a national identity through the enactment of legitimating ritual, and attempts at the legal and moral regulation of the lives of its subjects, but also the contestation, rejections, resistance, adaptations, innovations, and alternatives presented by the great majority of the population, the middle sectors and 28. Bhabha, “DissemiNation,” 294; Escobar, Encountering Development, 218–20. 29. This is the argument of Mark Overmyer-Velázquez’s dissertation on Oaxaca. See Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar’s edited volume, Alternative Modernities.\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nurban and rural working classes of Mexico. The latter is often referred to as popular culture.30 The study of culture has recently undergone a great deal of critical reXection prompted by new theories of power, language, gender, ethnicity, race, and authors’ subjectivity. Now envisioned as a contested terrain, it is seen as inherently political because competing groups seek to redeWne who holds power.31 Unfortunately, the concept of popular culture has become excessively broad; hence, I prefer to think in terms of political culture. InXuenced by François Furet and linguistic studies, Keith Baker’s works on revolutionary France viewed politics as the articulation, negotiation, and implementation of “competing claims they make upon one another and upon the whole.” Thus political culture, “discourses or symbolic practices,” are the vehicles through which claims are made. As a historical creation, political culture is subject to constant revision by its agents as new claims are put forth and old ones reformulated.32 The changing political culture in Mexico, its internal conXicts and alternative formulations, is one of the central themes running through this study. The history of state formation in Liberal Mexico is permeated by conXict and negotiation, a struggle for power on different and interlocking levels not only political but also economic, social, and cultural. At the helm of elite projects of nation building were Oaxaca’s two favorite sons, Benito Juárez and PorWrio Díaz. The present study shows how these two men were intensely involved in the modernization of their native state 30. Popular culture has been deWned as the “symbols and meanings embedded in the dayto-day practices of subordinated groups.” Neither monolithic nor autonomous, it is produced in a dialectical struggle with dominant cultures that takes place “in contexts of unequal power and entails reciprocal appropriations, expropriations, and transformations.” Nugent and Alonso, “Multiple Selective Traditions,” 210–11. See also Joseph and Nugent, “Popular Culture and State Formations,” 15ff. This deWnition of popular culture does not exclude more speciWc forms, such as art and music. For the purpose of this study, working classes include both rural campesinos and urban artisans, laborers and domestic workers. 31.

See Popkin, “Concept of Public Opinion,” 85.\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nand at the same time used it as their springboard and political base from which to rule the nation. They both relied on Oaxacan campesinos to defend them militarily and on Oaxacan middle sectors and elites to represent their interests in national and other state governments. They espoused democracy even as they transferred their patron-client relationships to the national sphere. Both presidents exhibited the profound ambivalence of Mexican liberals toward the majority indigenous population of Oaxaca, yet they were cognizant of the importance of campesinos as actors in state formation. Questions of power, domination, hegemony, and authority are also under intense discussion in many disciplines. Comprehension of the political process has been “radically deinstitutionalized” as the personal has been recognized as political and the political dimensions of everyday life have been evoked. The linkage of politics and culture reveals that power can no longer be understood as the private domain of states and the forces of repression but must be seen as changing and unequal relationships in society.33 The ongoing struggle among Oaxaca’s social classes, ethnicities, and genders to deWne their identities as well as the political entities that make up their nation and to shape its future is another question that inspires this study. An early cradle of liberalism, Oaxacans fought for the Liberal Army in wartime and were major players in the Liberal Reform (1855–67), the Restored Republic (1867–76), and the PorWriato (1876–1911), demonstrating the preponderance of southern politics before the 1910 Revolution.34 Ideologies such as Juarismo, PorWrismo, and Magonismo, whose progenitors were born and nourished in the state of Oaxaca, emerged as national movements. Juarismo, and the Juárez legacy, was reinterpreted and reinvented by successive generations on the state and national stage with differing political groups vying for the title of authentic Juaristas. The Mexican Revolution was initiated under the banner of Juarismo in opposition to PorWrismo, a fact insufWciently recognized by historians. Yet the feeble three-day campaign in Oaxaca of Benito Juárez Maza, the liberal hero’s son, for the governorship in 1910, symbolized perhaps its 33. Dirks, Eley, and Ortner, “Introduction,” 4ff.

On hegemony, see Roseberry, “Hegemony and the Language of Contention.” We will return to Foucault’s concepts in later chapters, but he unfortunately ignored the gendered subtext of power relations. 34.

Magonismo (after the followers of the radical liberal and later anarchist Flores Magón brothers), which surged across Mexico after 1900, sought its roots in Juarismo but transcended it to respond to Mexico’s new mass society. Ironically, Ricardo Flores Magón, another Oaxaqueño intensely dedicated to his patria chica, emerged as the leader of the Wrst national movement to challenge PorWrismo. Although this study concentrates on the history of the state of Oaxaca between 1867 and 1911, it is intertwined with larger national processes and often foreshadows future developments throughout Mexico.\n\nThe Power of the Local Since the nineteenth century, thinkers as diverse as Liberals, Marxists, Modernizationists, Dependentistas, and world-systems theorists have perceived Western capitalist expansion as subject and Latin America, Asia, and Africa as object. Sherry Ortner criticized the image of (capitalist) history arriving “like a ship, from outside the society in question” to transform “traditional” Third World regions. The result is not a history of that society, but the impact of (our) history on that society.” She suggests instead that each society be analyzed not only within the larger context but also with respect to its own structures and history. By focusing on process and dialectical relationships within one state, the present study reveals the Xexibility of local and regional factors in their relationships with national and global forces, and vice versa.35 This process has frequently been designated as the decentering of history. Decentering facilitates the emergence of hidden local and regional histories that lie beyond the privileged themes of dominant narratives. Howard Campbell’s Zapotec Renaissance and Jeffrey Rubin’s Decentering the Regime have done this for the study of the COCEI (Coalition of Workers, Peasants and Students of the Isthmus) in Juchitán, Oaxaca. For Rubin, decentering means “that national politics be understood as something partial and complex that coexists with, but is different from, 35. Ortner, “Theory in Anthropology,” 142–43. William B. Taylor has also warned against the tendency to exaggerate the power of “the long arm of the world market.” He calls on scholars to concentrate on “local responses and conditions—not just the relentless pressure of external developments and authority.” Taylor, “Between Global Process and Local Knowledge,” 121–27, 171–72.\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nregional and local politics, and that is only one among several locations and kinds of politics.” Center refers “simultaneously to a place (Mexico City), an institutional apparatus of power and decision making, and a set of ‘national’ cultural discourses.”36 This is a fruitful platform for the study of a grassroots political movement that began in the 1970s in order to oppose the postrevolutionary Mexican state (which Rubin argues was not so centralized after all). In her comparative study of peasants in Mexico and Peru, Florencia Mallon used the concept of decentering more broadly. Few historians of regional history today would disagree with her argument that in order to comprehend “subaltern” peoples’ history, “we must decenter our vision of the historical process” as well as concepts of the intellectual and community, of politics, theories of nationalism, and the state.37 However, the operation of decentering requires a center. And although it was common to refer to El Centro in the nineteenth century, the weight of Mexican history remained in its regional dimensions. In December 1846, during the U.S. occupation, Mariano Otero lamented that “In Mexico that which is called national spirit cannot nor has been able to exist, for there is no nation.” Supposedly, centrifugal forces that emerged with the struggle for Independence gave rise to Mexico’s acute regionalism (although colonial historians have recently challenged the existence of a powerful centralized viceregal government).38 To my mind, the concept of decentering as applied to the nineteenth century is imprecise and misleading since it posits the existence of a center and a nation that were both only then in the process of consolidation. Integral to that process in the second half of the nineteenth century was the production of the Wrst ofWcial histories written to forge a uniform and linear narrative of Mexican history and legitimize liberal rule. These 36. Campbell, Zapotec Renaissance, and Rubin, Decentering the Regime, 14–15, 277. The operation of decentering is often, but not always, associated with the postmodern critique of modernity’s universalizing narratives, although that is not necessarily the case with the studies cited here. In fact, Campbell is an outspoken critic of postmodern anthropology; see his Mexican Memoir. 37. She suggests that we begin with Benedict Anderson’s work on the “imagined community,” Mallon, Peasant and Nation, 5ff.; Anderson, Imagined Communities. We will return to Anderson’s theories in Chapter 8. 38. Otero quoted in Hale, Mexican Liberalism, 14. Recent studies have advanced the process of rewriting Mexican history during the PorWriato, but only Wells and Joseph’s outstanding study, Summer of Discontent, provides a perspective on the indigenous south in the Yucatán. On central and northern Mexico, see Rendón Garcini, Prosperato; Thomson and LaFrance, Patriotism, Politics, and Popular Liberalism; Vanderwood, Power of God; Falcón and Buve, Don PorWrio Presidente.\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nworks dealt mainly with central Mexico, beginning the tradition of what Pablo Serrano Alvarez has dubbed “historiographic centralism.” Postrevolutionary regimes followed this path, sponsoring their legitimizing versions of history, and furthered the creation of a homogeneous national identity based in El Centro. Nevertheless, I strongly agree with Mario Cerutti’s contention that nineteenth-century history needs to focus on regional history because Mexico had yet to develop a truly “national history.”39 Auspiciously, the publication of Luis González’s Pueblo en vilo in 1968 (the same year of the tragic denouement of the student movement, which Wnally interred the myth of the institutionalized revolution), a historical narrative of the small village of San José de Gracia, irrevocably fractured the credibility of centralist histories and sparked a renewed interest in regional history. The latter developed in the 1970s with the expansion of university education in the provinces and the classiWcation of regional archives. Constituting a veritable boom by the 1980s, new regional histories tended to concentrate on northern and central Mexico during the revolutionary and postrevolutionary periods. Regrettably, nineteenth-century historiography was still “held hostage to the Revolution of 1910,” as it was considered mainly as the precursor to that historical watershed. Fortunately there has been a recent surge not only in nineteenth-century studies but also in the “discovery” of “the unknown Mexico” of the south and southeast,40 as the present study demonstrates. Thus I designate the lens of southern regional history as The View from the South, borrowing it from an article by William B. Taylor entitled “Landed Society in New Spain: A View from the South” (1974). Since François Chevalier’s study on haciendas was fast becoming the standard for all Mexico, Taylor synthesized the very different land tenure and labor conditions in colonial Oaxaca in order to demonstrate the dangers of generalizations about New Spain.41 As I was also engaged in discovering 39.

The great advantage of a close study of one state (or region or locality) is that it magniWes processes to let us examine in detail not only how change takes place but its limits and constraints. In effect, The View from the South holds up a mirror to the dialectic of change and continuity in the nation as a whole. The focus on regional history enables us to understand not only how capitalism affects a society but also how that society engages and translates new forces and affects capitalism. This is why I prefer to speak of the spread of capitalist relations rather than the impact of capitalism and avoid the use of core/periphery models. Capitalism is not a force independent of the people who create, contest, resist, or appropriate it. Carol Smith, too, has exhorted anthropologists to discover and emphasize the dialectic between local and global factors. She underscored the human aspect, how real people, in her case indigenous people of Guatemala, make their own history and are ultimately responsible for the dynamic capitalism acquires in speciWc regions.42 The present study humanizes the abstract forces of capitalism and nation building by portraying the struggles of real people, elites, middle sectors, working classes, and indigenous ethnicities alike.\n\nUnequal and Uneven Development In his study of slavery as social death, Orlando Patterson reminds us that “all human relationships are structured and deWned by the relative power of the interacting persons.” Therefore, historical process is always conditioned by unequal access to economic, political, and social power and the relations of domination that derive from this inequality. Since the colonial for agreeing to my use of his subtitle. This choice is also heavily inXuenced by having lived so long in southern regions (Oaxaca, Florida, and Kentucky) and my association with colleagues in U.S. Southern and Appalachian History at the University of Kentucky. Steve Stern once suggested that we look at Latin America with “peripheral vision,” but that approach puts us back in the core/periphery binary. See Stern, “Feudalism, Capitalism.” 42. See Cardoso and Faletto on the “internalization of the external” in Dependency and Development in Latin America. Carol Smith underlines the steadfast cultural resistance and heterogeneous local responses to capitalism, declaring that “it would be difWcult to sustain the position that Guatemala turned out the way it did because global capitalism needed that particular pattern.” Smith, “Local History in Global Context,” 193–96, 224–26.\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nperiod, the spread of capitalism in Latin America has been highly uneven and unequal, marked by waves of prosperity and decline. William Roseberry imagined it as an “ongoing process, a series of encounters . . . in unevenly developing spaces and shifting centers and peripheries.”43 The challenge for scholars has been to convey that unevenness; for instance, the increasing differentiation in economic and social spheres exempliWed by the growth of the international division of labor and of boom-and-bust cycles of particular commodities and their impact on speciWc regions. It placed particular regions of Oaxaca within the larger processes of the concentration of capital, investment of foreign capital, and connections with world markets, while others remained on the margins. This economic surge intensiWed capitalist pressure on natural resources and forced villages to Wercely defend their access to elements vital to their survival. Social differentiation between and within social classes, ethnic groups, regions, and local communities increased considerably as the gap between rich and poor widened. Drawing together the focus on the process of state formation and uneven and unequal development of the regions of Mexico also elucidates how and why control of the state apparatus shifted from the hands of southern Liberals to those of the center and the north even before 1910.\n\nEthnicity, Race, Class, and Gender The gendered subtext of modernity lodged in the false dichotomy of male and female spheres led Catherine Scott to critique theories of modernization. Modernity, with its drive toward technological and material progress and the development of civil society, posed a “set of masculine challenges.” Portrayals of tradition rest on essentialized gender differences. Today, the conceptualization of tradition, of the rural village, is based on the depiction of Third World rural women as backward, religious, family- and community-oriented, illiterate, and domestic, not to mention 43. Patterson also notes that while freedom and slavery exist at the extreme poles of the distribution of power, they are dialectically joined (Slavery and Social Death, 1, 5, 13ff.). Roseberry suggested that we stress uneven development and “uneven proletarianization” and repudiate historical models based on polarizing oppositions such as core and periphery in “Beyond the Agrarian Question,” 351, and Anthropologies and Histories, 198–24. See also Wolf, Europe and the People Without History, 303–4.\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nirrational, childlike, dependent, and close to nature.44 As we shall see, these binaries have resonated mightily for the indigenous population of Oaxaca. Although nineteenth-century liberals in Mexico and Latin America were obsessed with the question of race, for many years twentieth-century historians (writing about the nineteenth) failed to see that indigenous face in the mirror. Captivated by nineteenth-century peasant rebellions and the emergence of industrial working classes, they relegated it to the past, except for an occasional rebellious Maya or Yaqui. While historians of colonial Mexico have long recognized the magnitude of race and ethnicity and have made notable progress in this area (perhaps due to more complete Spanish archives), only recently have the histories of women, indigenous ethnicities, and Afro-Mexicans in the nineteenth century been investigated (gays and lesbians are still waiting). Yet Oaxaca was so overwhelmingly indigenous (three quarters of the population) and rural, that except where speciWc exceptions are made, in the present study indígena (which refers to both the indigenous person and the descriptive adjective) and campesino (peasant) are synonymous unless otherwise speciWed.45 Ethnicity must be viewed as a crucial and independent factor of social analysis and cannot be simply reduced to class, as has so often been the case in Mexico, especially for the study of the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Ana María Alonso agrees that class can no longer overdetermine 44. Therefore, the challenge of modernization theory was to transform Mexico into a rational, industrial, efWcient, urban, and future-oriented society, in short, into a society based on order and progress. See Scott, Gender and Development, 5, 24, 124ff. See also Talpade Mohanty, “Cartographies of Struggle,” and “Under Western Eyes”; and Parpart and Marchand, “Exploding the Canon.” Catherine Scott calls for a gender-sensitive reformulation of development theory, but postdevelopment writers such as Arturo Escobar (Encountering Development) and Gustavo Esteva of Oaxaca, who is adviser to various indigenous autonomy movements, including the EZLN in Chiapas, are convinced that racist and hierarchical binaries are so intrinsic to development theories that they cannot be reformed. See Esteva, “Development.” 45. See Van Young, “Moving Toward Revolt,” 182. I prefer the term campesino to peasant. In the 1960s Ralph L. Beals explained that “in Oaxaca peasants or campesinos (the local term), include farmers, artisans, rural workers, and traders living in rural settlements. . . . These communities exhibit similar social and cultural characteristics but have distinctive local variations and highly differentiated economies. In many ways Oaxaca peasants do not conform to most of the vague typological deWnitions of the term peasant. They are peasantlike, but they differ markedly from the peasants of Haiti or China or medieval Europe” Beals, “Oaxaca Market Study Project,” 28–29.\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\nother forms of oppression now that gender and ethnicity have emerged as independent variables that are “key to both the construction of the body personal and the body politic.”46 In the conXict between the Mixtec campesinos of Santa María Yucuiti with the Hacienda de la Concepción, the former were continually subjected to racist denunciations as “tenacious indios,” yet they confronted the hacienda’s administrators, the local jefe político, and even the national government as peasants Wghting for their lands, not as Mixtecs. In contrast, the Chatino uprising against the 1896 tax law knotted issues of class, race, ethnicity, and gender as it threatened a caste war. The focus on the interplay of these factors permits a comprehension of the dynamic and shifting relationships of power and identity in local, regional, state, national, and global contexts, the changing ways social groups engaged with those distinct but interrelated levels of politics.\n\nQuestions of Sources The present study, then, is the Wrst to examine the Liberal period as a whole in the history of Oaxaca. The two groups that confronted each other militarily during the 1910 Revolution produced two currents of interpretation of Oaxacan historiography. On one side were the PorWristas, those who defended PorWrio Díaz, and Soberanistas, those who supported the conservative Sovereignty movement (1915).47 Opposed to them were the anti-PorWristas and Carrancistas, who represented the Constitutionalist wing of the Revolution and demonized the PorWriato, portraying the Revolution as the savior of Mexico.48 Almost all writers belonged to one of these two camps before 1975 and many of the works 46. I have made this case previously in “Maderismo or Mixtec Empire?” See also Alonso, “Gender, Power, and Historical Memory” 404–5. Alan Knight is also convinced that social classes cannot be neatly equated with revolutionary factions, although class analysis is still important to the interpretation of the Revolution. Knight, “Weapons and Arches,” 57. 47. See Salazar, “Historia de Oaxaca”; Esteva, Nociones elementales; Taracena, Apuntes históricos and PorWrio Díaz; Brioso y Candiani, Evolución del pueblo oaxaqueño; Ibarra Díaz, Memorias del General de División; Vásquez Cruz, Soberanía. On June 3, 1915, in the middle of the Mexican Revolution, the Conservative elites of Oaxaca reassumed state sovereignty, hoping to sit out the Revolution and maintain control of their state. Oaxaca had made use of this stratagem in 1823, 1858, and 1871. This measure is not equivalent to a declaration of independence. 48.

This study owes a great debt to three narrative historians (who are no longer with us) who pioneered the trails of nineteenth-century Oaxacan history. Jorge Fernando Iturribarría, a lawyer and politician and the most proliWc of the three, wrote in his leisure time. His general history of the state contained the longest piece on the PorWriato (twenty-seven pages) in print until I began to publish my research. Regrettably, his extremely detailed four-volume history of the nineteenth century ends in 1877, the very Wrst year of Díaz’s rule. Although he strove for objectivity in documenting Oaxacan participation in the Revolution, his sympathies for the PorWriato and Sovereignty are evident.49 The writings of Basilio Rojas followed the zigzag pattern of his life. From a powerful coffee-producing family of Miahuatlán, he initiated his political life as an ardent PorWrista and closed the revolutionary period as the apologist for Oaxaca’s most authentic revolutionary Wgure, General Manuel García Vigil. The Wrst two volumes of his autobiography are peppered with picturesque anecdotes of life in PorWrian Oaxaca. His study of coffee in Oaxaca, his Efemérides (the daily syntheses of the newspaper El Avance), his personal archives, to which he generously provided me access, and personal interviews have been priceless sources. Don Angel Taracena, although born in Tabasco, moved to the city of Oaxaca at an early age. His published works, engaging interviews, with colorful reminiscences of PorWrian Oaxaca, his gift of access to unpublished manuscripts, and his gracious hospitality were invaluable. Personally, I have spent many years working in the public and private archives of Oaxaca, organizing, classifying, and researching documents. There is, as I reiterate throughout this study, copious documentation on the lives of elites but not on the indigenous campesinos. Shahid Amin described the problems scholars who study nonliterate peoples face: “The speech of humble folk is not normally recorded for posterity, it is wrenched from them in courtroom and inquisitorial trials. Historians have therefore learned to comb ‘confessions’ and ‘testimonies’ for their evidence, for this is where peasants cry out, dissimulate or indeed narrate.” It is necessary, therefore, to “interrogate the interrogators” so as not to 49. See Iturribarría, Oaxaca en la historia; Historia de Oaxaca, vol. 4; and Benito Juárez PorWrio Díaz. I was able to interview Rojas and Taracena, but Iturribarría died a few months before I began my research.\n\n22\n\nIntroduction\n\nreproduce their discourses.50 Although Oaxacan villages tended to be so consistently litigious that one might question whether testimonies were always “wrenched” from them, the objectives mediating them have led scholars to debate whether we can actually “get in touch with the consciousness of insurgency when our access to it is barred thus by the discourse of counter-insurgency.” This “prose of counter-insurgency” not only denies autonomy of action and a speciWc consciousness to the rebels but also criminalizes their protest, turning it into rural banditry and barbarous attempts to thwart civilization. Although Ranajit Guha believes that most historians, conservatives and radicals alike, have been complicit with the code of counterinsurgency, he thinks that the evidence is to be found where the insurgents and their activities are described.51 This approximation requires that we constantly read in reverse and contextualize all voices in terms of power relations. Often what is not said is as revealing as what is, so we must read between the lines and seek exclusions. The power of the actions of indigenous Oaxacans can often be evinced through the very stridency of elite condemnations of them. Moreover, I do not propose to speak for indigenous campesinos or to rescue their voices from oblivion (that would be, as Michael Taussig has warned, “the ultimate anthropological conceit”),52 nor do I suggest that this is an objective account, recognizing, along with Nancy Fraser, that all interpretations are active “interventions.”53 My Zapotec colleague, 50. I have yet to work in judicial archives, where many scholars have now found abundant material on Mexico’s popular classes. That is my next project. Shahid Amin, Event, Metaphor, Memory, 1. Colonial historian William B. Taylor noted that “most peasant and Indian history deals with relations between Spanish rulers and Indian subjects or Wlters the subjects’ behavior through the words of Spanish witnesses or of the Indian elite. This is the outsider’s view of rural society, telling us more about Spaniards and rulers than about peasants.” Taylor, Drinking, Homicide, and Rebellion, 3.

He admonishes us that history has served the Mexican elite “to expropriate with impunity the prestigious past of the defeated” for their own beneWt while they continue to oppress the direct descendants of those civilizations.54 Scholars produce competing interventions, heavily inXuenced by their personal history and circumstances, in their attempt to reconstruct history. Consequently, I have also relied on my personal knowledge, particularly having lived in the city of Oaxaca, spent extended periods of time with family in the town of Tlacolula in the Central Valleys, and made innumerable trips to various regions of the state over more than three decades for research, archival organization, and pleasure. For a semester in both 1982 and 1983, as a professor at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, Iztapalapa campus, in Mexico City, I was commissioned to work in the Oaxacan state archives, organizing, classifying, and researching primary documents. During other semesters, I directed teams (integrated by UAM students and technical workers from the national and state archives) in the organization and classiWcation of the state archives and various municipal archives in Oaxaca. Above all, for more than two decades I have been privileged to learn from my collaboration with a remarkable team of Oaxacan social scientists.55\n\nOrganization of the Book This monograph is divided into three main parts: (I) Infrastructure and Economics, (II) Society: Class, Ethnicity, and Gender, and (III) Political Culture and Revolution. The focus is interdisciplinary and each part builds upon the previous ones. Part I introduces the complex economic, geographical, and ethnic map of Oaxaca. Its four chapters, which trace the interactions among the construction of infrastructure, the privatization of land, the expansion of commercial agriculture and mining, and the 54.

I directed the organization of the series of Gobierno and Fomento in the Oaxacan state archives and the municipal archives of Tlacolula, Teotitlán del Valle, Ixtlán, Tehuantepec, Juchitán, Pinotepa Nacional, and Jamiltepec, in addition to reporting on others (such as Tuxtepec) for the state. I identify this group in the acknowledgements.

For example, the rapid dissemination of coffee increased pressure for privatization, especially in regions with railroad connections. By the turn of the century, coffee had facilitated the rise of not only large, modern haciendas but also small to middling farms, and had become an important cash crop for indigenous villages. The result was an increasingly unequal distribution of wealth within and among the regions of the state. In Part II, divided into three chapters, I assess how these economic transformations reshaped Oaxacan society, stimulating greater differentiation within and among existing groups in addition to creating new social groups. Waves of immigrants mixed with older elites to reconWgure the ruling class, while an increasingly restless middle class grew in the city and countryside. Commercial agriculture resulted in the rise of an important rancher class in rural Oaxaca, while the mining boom encouraged some expansion in the service sectors. Two chapters of this section explore the usos y costumbres of the indigenous peoples of Oaxaca in order to deconstruct the unproblematic “Indian” into various ethnicities and to underscore changes occurring within and among communities. The analysis of the various strategies used by indigenous peoples serves to “demystify” romantic versions of indigenous resistance while it illustrates how they negotiated modernity and participated in state formation. In Part III, I connect the changing political culture and power relationships within the state with the economic and social transformations discussed in previous sections. I trace the interaction of local, regional, state, and national politics during the presidencies of Benito Juárez, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, and PorWrio Díaz. Conservative, moderate, and radical groups increasingly disputed the interpretation of liberalism. The investigation of the internal mechanisms of local and state politics uncovers the many compromises politicians negotiated with their clienteles and the limits of political liberalism. I bring to light the growing opposition to the dictatorship in several regions, in addition to various revolutionary movements, especially in the geographically peripheral regions of the state. Two decades of research have contradicted the portrayal of Oaxaca as an insigniWcant backwater under these Liberal governments and compelled me to rethink its history. This new version refutes stereotypes as it upsets the linear narration of modern Mexico, laying bare the collusion between universal and modernizing narratives with top-down elite\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\nprojects of nation building. It presents the process of state formation whereby the social classes and ethnicities of Mexico participated in the shaping of the state and national identity. It does not pretend either to tender apologies or make denunciations. Scoundrels and their victims abound in history, but in general campesinos and middle sectors were not saints, nor were elites incarnations of Satan. The subtitle, The View from the South, can be understood on various levels. It is the view of Mexican history from the south that disrupts dominant histories of the Centro. It is the history of the demise of the south as a political power during the late PorWriato in the wake of the rise of the north achieved by the Revolution. In a broader sense, it sheds new light on the engagement and confrontation of peoples of the southern regions of the world at the local level with the expansion of imperialism of the north. As a history of the indigenous south, it holds accountable histories written by modernizing elites that represent indigenous peoples as stagnant and frozen in time. This is especially signiWcant given the recent mobilization of the indigenous peoples of Latin America, including those of Oaxaca, in defense of their culture and regional autonomy. The View from the South provides the vital background for a comprehension of these contemporary struggles.\n\n1 “A Thousand Whistles” The mountain range, which in Puebla and Mexico raises its peaks to immense heights, swoops down and extends into the state of Oaxaca, occupying almost all its territory, which causes its extreme ruggedness. Few and narrow valleys are found and from the tops of the mountains beautiful Xats can be seen which geographers call mesas. From the PaciWc coast, they rise up to a height of nearly 4,000 meters above sea level, to immediately dip into the waters of the Mexican breast. In Oaxaca, the Sierra Madre divides into two branches, which go in separate directions. One heads directly north under the name of the Sierra de Cuasimulco, and the other passes near the city called San Felipe del Agua towards the northwest, and doesn’t meet up again with the other range until they reach the state of Colima. . . . The numerous mountains of this state are covered in their majority by thick and somber forests, a multitude of canyons, and all over an abundant and robust vegetation. The rivers, sometimes quiet and gentle and others torrential, their banks carpeted with an inWnity of plants and bright Xowers, all contribute to surprising landscapes, wild scenes that are characteristic of America. —Padre José Antonio Gay, Historia de Oaxaca\n\nRegional and Ethnic Realities Crossed by three cordilleras—the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Sierra Madre del Sur, and the Sierra Atravesada—Oaxaca’s rugged geography has left an indelible imprint on its history. Lakes are few and a handful of rivers are serviceable for irrigation but not for navigation, with the exception of the Papaloapan. The mountainous terrain, as described above by Padre Gay in 1881, accounts for the physical isolation of many areas and the existence of distinct ecological niches within short distances of each other. It also I am grateful to Mark Summers, Paul Vanderwood, and Sandra Kryst for comments on earlier versions of this chapter.\n\n30\n\nInfrastructure and Economics\n\nhelps to explain the survival of the state’s sixteen indigenous ethnic groups and its division into seven distinct geographical regions (see map 1).1 Although the regional history of Mexico has come of age in the last thirty years, studies are vague about deWning their terms and most often geographic or geo-economic criteria are employed to deWne regions. Eric Van Young whimsically observed, “regions are like love—they are difWcult to describe but we know them when we see them.” But we see them as we construct them, because we already have the organizing criteria of the subject of our investigation in mind. That is why they are “good to think,” because they permit us to discern “the relationship among three key variables in the human sciences: sociocultural change, space, and time.” Regions are not micro, as small as villages or towns, nor are they macro, as large as nations.2 They are not static and Wxed but produced historically by the interactions of multiple factors, social, political, cultural, economic, ecological, and geographic. Their “identity is shaped and reproduced by the memories, rituals, and networks of their inhabitants.” Regionalism has been an enormously powerful force in Mexican history and continues to be to this day.3 The dynamics of change and continuity within Oaxaca are incomprehensible without the knowledge of these regions. While the geographical analysis and division of the state into regions is a matter of continuing debate,4 the present study uses the geographic 1. Gay, Historia de Oaxaca, 1. Oaxaca continued to expand its territory with the settlement of various territorial disputes with neighboring states during the period under study. In 1877 it had 86,950 square kilometers; by 1910 it had grown to 92,442. González Navarro, Estadísticas, 9. 2. Van Young also stresses the “plasticity” and “historicity” of regions that are constantly negotiated “by actors within and without.” Van Young, “Are Regions Good to Think?” 3–7; Martínez Assad, Sentimientos de la región, 75. Gilbert Joseph has also observed that “regional history has become a shorthand for all subnational history.” “Introduction,” 3–5. 3. Roberts, “Place of Regions in Mexico,” 228ff. 4. The Oaxacan engineer and geographer Jorge Tamayo carried out various studies on this theme in the 1940s and 1950s, and Reyna Moguel outlined differing possibilities of regionalization in the 1970s. See Tamayo, Geografía de Oaxaca and “Realidad geográWca,” 270–82; Moguel, Regionalizaciones. In his geography of the state (Nociones elementales), Cayetano Esteva presented the districts in alphabetical order, while Alfonso Luis Velasco organized the districts by those bordering on Puebla, Veracruz, and the interior districts.

Demonstrating the processual aspect, the new Sierra Sur region, located between the Central Valleys and the Costa, developed only after the Revolution with the creation of the new districts of Zaachila and Sola de Vega.

These seven geographical regions were composed of twenty-six political-administrative districts (map 1), although Juxtlahuaca was suppressed in 1907, while the new district of Putla was created (map 4, in the following chapter, shows the districts as they were in 1907). These districts were further divided into 516 municipios (municipalities), which in turn were subdivided into 630 agencias municipales (municipal agencies) by 1910.5 A short introduction to each region, as it was in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, follows.

The subtropical climate is warm and humid, well suited to the sugarcane Welds and coffee estates on the mountain slopes. Teotitlán del Camino is the small administrative seat along the railroad of the district of the same name, yet nestled in the highlands further east is that district’s commercial hub, Huautla, with a population of eight thousand, many of whom are indigenous Mazatecs. Cuicatlán is the economic center of the next district, home to a small but active Methodist church.6 t h e c e n t r a l va l l e ys\n\nThe Cañada leads into the Central Valleys region, the upper drainage basin of the Atoyac River, which enjoys a temperate climate.

Traditional crops (maize, wheat, beans, agave, chile, and squash) predominate on haciendas, ranchos, and indigenous communal lands, while in the more fertile valleys of Zimatlán and Etla sugarcane is also cultivated.7 The stately city of Oaxaca (with a population of 38,000) sits at the heart of the Central Valleys, surrounded by majestic mountains. Called Huaxyacac (place of the huaje, a tree that yields edible beans) by the Aztecs, it originated as a fort during the Mexica Empire’s expansion into Zapotec and Mixtec territory in the late Wfteenth century. The Spanish founded the royal city of Antequera (Oaxaca’s colonial name) at Huaxyacac and the Crown granted its charter in 1532. It became an important commercial and administrative center on the royal highway to Central America. With exquisite Spanish colonial architecture built with the state’s green stone (volcanic tuff), it has been called the “emerald” city.8 During the PorWriato, it was the bustling center of a mining boom. the sierra juárez\n\nThe rich veins of the Sierra Juárez’s mountains fed that boom. Closely linked to the Central Valleys, this region was dependent on it for foodstuffs, especially maize, given the low productivity of its rough landscape. Composed of the districts of Ixtlán and Villa Alta, it is inhabited by hardy Zapotec serranos (highlanders). This region of tierra fría (colder temperate climate) was known as the Sierra Norte until it was renamed in honor of the state’s illustrious hero. The Sierra Juárez lies in the center of the mountain ranges of southern Mexico, bordering on the west with the Cañada, on the north with the Papaloapan region, on the east with the Isthmus, and on the south with the Central Valleys. Landlocked, it has no borders with other states or access to railways. Well timbered and watered to support its many mining camps, concentrating plants, and stamp mills, the Sierra Juárez was only accessible on foot, by horse, or by mule train.\n\n7. Centro, Etla, Tlacolula, Ocotlán, Zimatlán, Ejutla, Miahuatlán, and Yautepec were Central Valleys districts in 1910. 8.

The Papaloapan river basin region, a large web of rivers and streams, dominates the southeastern portion of the state of Veracruz and the northeastern sector of Oaxaca. Home to the indigenous Chinantecs, where women wear dazzling hand-woven red huipiles (long blouses), this is tierra caliente (hotlands), scorching and insalubrious. These extremely fertile lands produce tropical crops, especially tobacco but also coffee, rubber, sugarcane, cotton, maize, and beans. The more important commercial centers in the district are Ojitlán and Ixcatlán. The district of Choapan borders on the Sierra Juárez and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and was even more remote than Tuxtepec. Also populated by the indigenous Chinantecs in addition to Zapotecs and Mixes, the nearest commercial outlet for its rich but isolated lands was Playa Vicente in the state of Veracruz. the isthmus\n\nTo the southeast of the Papaloapan, the large districts of Juchitán and Tehuantepec form the Oaxacan portion of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.
