        "meta_description": "Abstract This annotated bibliography comprises 49 texts concerning psilocybin mushroom practices developed by Indigenous peoples. The books and articles have been selected for their academic rigor, relevance, and historical significance, and to foreground overlooked research and subject matter. This includes research on a plurality of contemporary practices and evidence of historical uses, from cultural traditions in Mexico and other regions of the world. The curated texts are sourced from various disciplines, including anthropology, history, archaeology, ethnolinguistics, and ethnomycology. Employing diverse methodological and analytical frameworks, the texts explore the diversity of ways Indigenous cultures have related with, utilized, and conceptualized psilocybin mushrooms and the effects occasioned by their consumption. The annotations include brief summaries of the texts, contextualization of the research, and more critical appraisals. The aim of this annotated bibliography is to offer the reader a diverse overview of the research to date and provide an accessible resource for further exploration of historical and contemporary Indigenous psilocybin practices. The team of psychedelic researchers behind this annotated bibliography hope it will contribute to more nuanced dialogue around Indigenous people and practices in the context of the so-called psychedelic renaissance.",

        "text": "General\n\nSafford, W.E. (1915) ‘An Aztec Narcotic’, Journal of Heredity, 6, pp. 291–311.\n\nWhile there are important precursors to the emergence of an interest in Mexican sacred and/or psychedelic mushrooms among European and American scholars, William Safford (1859–1926) is usually cited as the person responsible for raising the issue among a Western audience. Safford's 1915 article established the erroneous and long-running confusion that the Aztec Nahuatl term Teonanacatl was identifiable as peyote, and not psilocybin mushrooms. His claims countered the traditional narrative established in surviving documents from the earliest stages of Spanish contact, especially in volume 11 of Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún's famous Florentine Codex (1545–1590), which documented the use of numerous psychoactives in the region of modern-day Mexico, including Teonanacatl. Safford claimed that Spanish observers such as Sahagún had mistaken dried peyote fragments as mushrooms. His main argument was that it is hard to distinguish between dried fragments of plants and fungi. To the extent that there was interest in the topic, Safford's arguments were considered persuasive.\n\nReko, B.P. (1996 [1919]). On Aztec Botanical Names. Berlin: VWB-Verlag\n\nThe Western scholarly debates in the first half of the 20th century around what exactly the Aztec Nahuatl term Teonanacatl referred to was rather niche, but those who took an interest were highly motivated. Considered the first to dispute Safford's (1915) claim that Teonanacatl was peyote, was the Austrian physician and amateur botanist (and later controversial Nazi-party supporter) living in Oaxaca, Blas Pablo Reko (1877–1953). In this article (originally published in Spanish in 1919) and in subsequent articles and correspondence with anthropologists and botanists, Reko argued that Teonanacatl were indeed mushrooms, and furthermore, that mushrooms were still being used for religious purposes by Indigenous peoples in Oaxaca. Reko was therefore one of the first in the literature to contend that these Indigenous practices still existed in the 20th century, at a time when they were widely thought by scholars to have died out. He wrote that Teonanacatl “is actually as Sahagún states, a fungus which grows on dung-heaps and which is still used under the old name by the Indians of the Sierra Juárez in Oaxaca in their religious feasts”. This article was translated into English by the ethnobotanist Jonathan Ott. The original Spanish language text may be easier to find (Reko, 1919).\n\nCairns, H. (1929) ‘A Divine Intoxicant’, Atlantic Monthly, 144(5), pp. 638–645.\n\nCairns' article in effect summarized and supported Safford's (1915) arguments, for general readership, that the Aztec Nahuatl term Teonanacatl was indeed identifiable as peyote, and not psilocybin mushrooms. According to the author it was mere botanical and etymological confusion; the divinatory concoctions described in numerous sources about Aztec customs were not mushrooms, but peyote—itself a plant well-known and studied among Western botanists. R. Gordon Wasson (Wasson, 1963) considered Cairns' piece to have been most responsible for spreading this ignorance: “In this article the Safford thesis, denying the existence of hallucinogenic mushrooms in Mexico, received its final expression” (p. 39). Cairns' piece appeared in the popular periodical magazine Atlantic Monthly, which may have influenced Wasson, who actively sought to publish his own ideas about sacred mushrooms in a popular venue, which he famously did in Life magazine in 1957.\n\nSchultes, R.E. (1940) ‘Teonanacatl: The Narcotic Mushroom of the Aztecs’, American Anthropologist, 42, pp. 429–443.\n\nThe emergence of a serious “scientific” interest from outsiders in Mexican sacred mushrooms owes much to the activities of Austrian doctor and ethnobotanist Blasius Paul (Blas Pablo) Reko (1996) and Austrian mining engineer Robert J. Weitlaner (1952), who both lived and worked in Mexico for much of their lives and careers. It was in no small-part due to their activities that the psychedelic mushroom came under the radar of Western researchers who had no or limited understanding of, or access to, the country of Mexico. Weitlaner had personally carried out field research in 1936 among Mazatec people in the Oaxacan town of Huautla de Jiménez, and together with Reko, had sent mushroom samples to Harvard's Botanical Museum, a leading site of the emerging field of ethnobotany, where they were identified as belonging to the Panaeolus genus.\n\nThe samples fell under the responsibility of a young ethnobotanist by the name of Richard Evans Schultes (1915–2000), whose status in the psychedelic branch of ethnobotany remains significant. However, as he notes in this landmark 1940 article published in the American Anthropologist, he had made several errors in an earlier article on the mushrooms, including mistakenly attributing their provenance to a different Indigenous group than the Mazatec, as well as omitting the participation of Weitlaner. In 1938, Schultes joined Blas Pablo Reko on a research expedition to Oaxaca (curiously coinciding in the field with Johnson, J.B. (1939) who purportedly became the first outsiders to witness and write about a Mazatec mushroom ceremony), where they collected “narcotic” mushroom samples and gathered information concerning their use, which is laid out in this article. In addition, the paper provides descriptions of Mazatec customs and ceremonies surrounding the mushrooms, including how they were eaten by “professional divinators” who were sought out by people to locate stolen property, discover secrets, and provide advice. Schultes made another trip to Oaxaca in 1939, where he noted the widespread use of sacred mushrooms among Indigenous groups neighboring the Mazatecs. Outside of the Indigenous peoples who actually used them, few if any were certain about the true identity of the Teonanácatl referred to in the earliest surviving sources on Aztec life. While a similar conclusion had been reached privately by Reko as early as 1923, Schultes' 1940 paper provided a definitive rebuttal of the Safford thesis (1915), and effectively established (again) that hallucinogenic mushrooms – what he referred to at this time as “divination-narcotics” – were indeed Teonanácatl.\n\nHeim, R. (1957) ‘Notes préliminaires sur les agarics hallucinogènes du Mexique’, [Preliminary notes on the hallucination-producing agarics of Mexico], Revue de Mycologie, 22(1), pp. 58–79.\n\nR. Gordon Wasson's zealous devotion to studying the mushroom was, by his own standards, amateur and even hobbyist, and he actively sought collaboration with academic experts, especially French Mycology Professor and Director of France's prestigious Museum of Natural History, Roger Heim (1900–1979). Heim was a world-authority on mycological science and Wasson contacted him directly, visited him in Paris, and took him to Mexico in 1956. Heim's write-up and study that resulted from this trip to Mexico was the first to identify the psychoactive properties of an otherwise obscure and little studied fungi genus Psilocybe. Heim gave some of his dried collection of psilocybe to Swiss chemist, LSD-25 discoverer, and leading authority on plant alkaloids Albert Hofmann, who eventually isolated two particular alkaloid compounds as key to the perceptual effects; psilocybin and psilocin.\n\nWasson, Heim, and Hofmann remained longtime collaborators from the 1950s onwards, producing many important and influential scientific studies. These studies include: Roger Heim and R. Gordon Wasson (1958), Les Champignons Hallucinogènes du Mexique: Etudes Ethnologiques, Taxinomiques, Biologiques, Physiologiques et Chimiques (Paris: Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle); Hofmann et al. (1959) “Psilocybin und Psilocin, zwei psychotrope Wirkstoffe aus mexikanischen Rauschpilzen” [Psilocybin and psilocin, two psychotropic substances in Mexican magic mushrooms], Helvetica Chimica Acta (in German), 42, no. 5 (1959): 1557–1572. These two studies introduced the terms “psilocybin” and “psilocin” to the scientific lexicon, referring to the active psychedelic compounds in mushrooms.\n\nWasson, R.G. (1963) ‘The Hallucinogenic Mushrooms of Mexico and Psilocybin: A Bibliography’ (second printing, with corrections and addenda), Botanical Museum leaflets, Harvard University, 20(2), pp. 25–73\n\nThis lengthy bibliography represents a comprehensive guide to writing on psilocybin mushrooms up to the early 1960s. The initial bibliography was published in 1962 in Harvard University's Botanical Museum Leaflet series, offering more than 350 cited references, including Spanish, French, and English sources, organized into nine sections. The bibliography was updated with corrections and addenda the following year, and again published in the Botanical Museum Leaflet series. Wasson's deep involvement with important early researchers in psychedelic mushrooms, including Roger Heim (1957), Blas Pablo Reko (1996), and Richard Evan Schultes (1940), are listed and in some cases annotated. The bibliography represents a lay-of-the-land of the initial wave of Western scholarly interest in psilocybin mushrooms, which even by the late 1950s had become complicated and much discussed, with Wasson perhaps immodestly noting that “Much has been published on our mushrooms and psilocybin in the lay press, in many countries.” While the growth in the history of the West's encounter with magic mushrooms has itself mushroomed considerably since the early 1960s, there remain numerous obscure and out-of-print sources that would likely interest curious young scholars today; as Wasson himself notes in the bibliography, “As time goes on, more will certainly be uncovered.”\n\nGuzmán, G. (2011) ‘El uso tradicional de los hongos sagrados: pasado y presente’, Etnobiología, 9, pp. 1–21.\n\nIn “The Traditional Use of Sacred Mushrooms: Past and Present” Mexican mycologist Gastón Guzmán presents research on the knowledge and traditions which include “neurotropic” mushrooms, including A. muscaria. The paper delves into the past and present of many Indigenous practices related to the use of mushrooms. This paper also presents an analysis of the taxonomic diversity and worldwide distribution of these mushrooms.\n\nHe outlines how anthropology and history have helped identify several peoples from antiquity who were linked to cults around, and uses of, neurotropic mushrooms, both in Mexico and in other regions of the world, such as Darien (Panama), Peru, Tassili n'Ajjer (Algeria), Papua New Guinea, Spain, France, Germany, and Greece. These assertions are largely based on analyses of archaeological artifacts. He discusses the historic suppression of Indigenous practices in Mesoamerica by the Catholic church and the later christianization of surviving practices, giving rise to syncretic approaches.\n\nJumping to the present, Guzman cites the ethnic groups that contemporarily use sacred mushrooms in Mexico, most of which are in Oaxaca, including the Mazatecs, Chinantecs, Mixes, Zapotecs, and Chatinos, along with the Nahuas (states of Mexico, Puebla, and Morelos) and the Matlatzincas (state of Mexico). Guzman also analyzes the relatively newfound interest by outsiders in the psilocybin mushrooms of the Mazatec region following their popularization by R. Gordon Wasson in the 1950/60s, describing what he characterizes as the desecration of millennial practices. In light of this he conceives of eight Indigenous rules which should be respected when using sacred mushrooms, based on his field work in the region.\n\nGastón Guzmán is recognized as one of the most important in his field, both nationally and internationally. He is also considered an obligatory academic reference for students of the psilocybe mushroom genus. In this particular paper he delivers concise, comprehensive research regarding the ancient use of neurotropic mushrooms, including the descriptive accounts of Aztec practices by the 16th-century Spanish chronicler Bernardino de Sahagún, to reports of modern times (including his own accounts of these experiences). Guzman also helped to identify numerous species of mushrooms collected in the Sierra Mazateca (Oaxaca, Mexico) and other regions.\n\nDe la Garza, M. (2012) Sueño y éxtasis en el mundo náhuatl y maya. México: Instituto de Investigaciones Filológicas-Fondo de Cultura Económica.\n\nTranslated as Dream and Ecstacy in the Nahua and Maya World, this book represents a fundamental contribution to analyzing from a religio-historical perspective Indigenous uses of plants and animals with psychoactive properties. Although not focused exclusively on psilocybin mushrooms and their ritual and therapeutic uses, the text permits a wider understanding of the cultural and historical context these cultural practices are part of. The text also explores how these practices relate to both ancient Mesoamerican tradition and contemporary Indigenous communities, especially the Nahua and Maya. De la Garza discusses the concept of “shaman” and uses it as a framework to analyze precolonial practices related to psychoactive plants, dreams, and other modified states of consciousness. The use of this concept has been contested by other scholars, who prefer the Maya term ajkij (the wise), not only in this specific case but in dealing with other sources throughout the book. The text is valuable because it is the first Spanish-language historical publication involving a systematic study of primary sources. The structure of the book offers an understanding of how the ritual and therapeutic uses of psilocybin mushrooms are related with other plants and animals. It also stimulates the creation of new lines of research by including original source material, documentation, and images of archaeological evidence.\n\nBorhegyi, C., & Borhegyi-Forrest, S. (2015). Mushroom intoxication in meso-America. In P. Wexler (Ed.), History of toxicology and environmental health. Amsterdam, The Netherlands: Academic Press.\n\nThis 2015 article published in the journal History of Toxicology and Environmental Health, outlines the evidence for the wide usage of hallucinogens and entheogens in pre-contact Meso- and South America, especially Guatemala and Mexico. The authors, Carl de Borhegyi and Suzanne de Borhegyi-Forrest (son and widow of pioneering Hungarian archaeologist, Stephan Francis de Borhegyi), argue that Stephan Borhegyi's thesis from the 1950s, that tied the ancient mushroom stones to Mesoamerican religious customs, was resisted by contemporary archaeologists owing to their Eurocentric bias that mushrooms were solely used as poisons. The authors describe the re-discovery in 1883 of Sahagún's 16th century chronicles of New Spain and their importance as a source for the religious and ceremonial uses of teonanácatl (hallucinogenic mushrooms), and survey other early colonial documents that refer to the use of mushrooms in divination and human sacrifices. In the 1950s, a flurry of activity related to psychedelic mushrooms took place, and there was a gradual recognition that religious mushroom use had persisted into contemporary times among several Indigenous peoples of Meso- and South America. Further ethnographic and ethnomycological work is described up until the tragic death of Stephan Borhegyi in 1969—including his correspondence with missionary and anthropologist Eunice Pike, who made early observations regarding the syncretic Christian-Indigenous nature of mushroom use among Mazatec people—followed by the subsequent efforts of Peter Furst, Bernard Lowy, and Gaston Guzmán. Carl Borhegyi then recounts the development of his own interest in mushrooms in Mesoamerican religions, especially the relationship between hallucinogenic mushrooms and jaguar iconography and a religious rite he calls the “underworld jaguar transformation.”\n\nRamírez, G.P., Sánchez, D.L.P., Hernández, M.H., and Ramírez, R.R. (2020) ‘Revisión histórica de los hongos psilocibios’, Educación y Salud. Boletín científico del Instituto de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo. Publicación semestral, 8(16), pp. 174–186.\n\nThis article, translated as Historical Review of Psilocybin Mushrooms, presents one of the most recent historical reviews on the ritual and therapeutic uses of psilocybin mushrooms in Mexico. The text is clearly written, includes a comprehensive bibliography, and the structure follows a chronological order which facilitates its reading. The article clearly highlights the different primary sources consulted which refer to ritual, therapeutic, and cultural uses of psilocybin mushrooms. Despite offering a more general overview, and not necessarily providing detailed analyses of specific cultural traits, it does refer to a complementary bibliography of more particular, localized research. The authors take into account contributions from disciplines such as ethnohistory, ethnomycology, psychiatry, and biology. A notable aspect of this article is the inclusion of the proceedings and trials from the Holy Inquisition. The authors suggest that the final reference to psychoactive mushrooms in these judicial processes dates from 1726 with a letter, found in the General Archive of the Nation (Mexico), which references the consumption of psilocybin mushrooms in the Sierra Baja Huasteca. For the more than two centuries which followed, no subsequent archival references had been identified. Ritual mushroom use was therefore widely assumed to be a lost cult, until later research in the 20th century brought attention to Mazatec practices in Oaxaca. There are also many references to documents and codices which include information about psilocybin mushrooms, such as the 1840 edition of the Yanhuitlán Codex. This article therefore represents a useful resource to analyze and understand little-known colonial sources on psilocybin mushrooms.\n\nFagetti A. y González Mariscal J. M. (2023). Elementos 131, BUAP, Puebla.\n\nElementos, the quarterly magazine of science and culture from the Benemerita Autonomous University of Puebla (Mexico), recently published an edition dedicated to psilocybin mushrooms. The journal was edited by the anthropologists Antonella Fagetti and Jesús M. González and is a result of the CONACYT research project “Dialogue of knowledge around the therapeutic potential of psilocybin-containing mushrooms – a transdisciplinary study through neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, history and indigenous traditional knowledge”. This project involved a Mexican team of researchers and students studying psychoactive fungi within the framework of the psychedelic revival, pharmaceutical industry investment, burgeoning new research in the field, and ongoing changes in the legal status of psilocybin and other psychoactive substances. This special edition, written in Spanish and containing fourteen articles, incorporates reflections from this transdisciplinary and intercultural approach towards the therapeutic potential of sacred mushrooms and traditional practices.\n\nThe articles include reflections on the life of María Sabina, ethnographies of other Mazatec healers such as Doña Paulina Encarnación Sosa Cortés, Mazatec ritual elements, the contemporary use of mushrooms in communities on the Popocatépetl volcano in the states of Mexico and Morelos, and the commodification of sacred mushrooms in Mexico. Particularly noteworthy is the inclusion of the contemporary ethnographic mapping of both existing and historical Indigenous ritual and therapeutic uses of psilocybin mushrooms throughout Mexico. This publication is significant for including an interdisciplinary approach, being written by researchers mainly of the Global South, and for taking a more critical approach towards the international scenario of the psychedelic renaissance."
