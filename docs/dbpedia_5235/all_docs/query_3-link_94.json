        "text": "The next few posts will discuss the position of the Chorotegan languages (i.e Chiapaneco and Mangue) in regards to Kaufman’s proposed split of the Otomanguean languages into a Western and Eastern division, as well as Kaufman’s argument for such a division in the first place. This issue will be split across a few posts just to keep this from post from ballooning. This post will briefly mention Kaufman East-West isoglosses and evaluate Chorotegan (well, really just Chiapaneco) along two of these criteria.\n\nTo be clear, I’m writing these posts as I’m reviewing the materials, and I don’t have a strong dedication to most of the details of the higher-level subgroupings of Otomanguean. I’m really digging into the details of this work for the first time, and I don’t know what I’ll conclude.\n\nThe subgrouping of Otomanguean branches was first proposed in Kaufman (1988) where a few morphological and phonological traits were used to classify languages into either Western (Oto-Pamean, Tlapanecan, Chinantecan, Chorotegan) or Eastern Otomanguean (Amuzgo, Mixtecan, Zapotecan, Popolocan). In 1988, Tlapanecan and Chorotegan were placed together in a subgroup. In Kaufman (2021), however, this subgroup was abandoned and Chorotegan was placed into the Eastern division. My last post covered the former development and the next few posts will cover the latter.\n\nKaufman proposes three innovations that define Eastern Otomanguean, one phonological, and two morphological. (Though the use of animal classifiers is arguably lexical).\n\n*se causatives\n\nReduction of vowel system (from nine pOM vowels to seven *a *e *i *o *u *ai *au; loss of *ia and *ea)\n\nPresence of animal classifiers (forms not reconstructible)\n\nThe evidence for grouping Western Otomanguean as a subgroup rests on one morphological trait and two phonological traits. The second of these phonological traits may actually be a retention rather than an innovation.\n\n*mu hypothetical\n\nMerger of pOM *ai and *a\n\n*r reflexes of pOM *θ\n\nToday we’ll look at how Chiapaneco, as the much better-documented representative of Chorotegan, fits into two of these criteria: the *mu hypothetical and the presence of animal classifiers.\n\nA Western Isogloss: *mu ‘hypothetical’\n\nSome Western OM languages have reflexes of a *mu ‘hypothetical morpheme. In San Ildefonso Tultepec Otomi, this appears as nu’mu or =’mu which is glossed as ‘when’ and ‘if’, depending on context (Palancar 2011:463).\n\nOther reflexes of this *mu include mɨ˜ ‘when’ in Santiago Comaltepec Chinantec, which is sometimes translated as ‘if’ (Anderson 2018:213).\n\nChiapaneco features a mo– prefix or proclitic (we really don’t have the data to distinguish) that appears frequently throughout the corpus. As far as I can tell, it always appears on subordinated verbs and is translated ‘when’. Lucien Adam (1886) named this the “mode conjonctif”.\n\nKaufman 1988 analyzes this mo- as meaning ‘when, if, supposing’, but I cannot find mo- clearly meaning ‘if’ or ‘supposing’ in the Chiapaneco text corpus I’ve been gathering. Even if its functions are narrower in Chiapaneco relative to its counterparts’ in Otopamean and Chinantecan languages, I am happy to consider the Chiapaneco mo- a likely cognate, potentially a reflex of pOM *mu.\n\nA note on Chiapaneco <o>: early texts tend to uniformly use <o> where later texts mostly use <u>. There are a number of possible explanations including diachronic change, but I am inclined to believe that there has only ever been one non-low back vowel in this language and its quality may have been closer to [u], with the <o> spellings reflecting a normative orthography that was less observed as time went on.\n\nSo I’m happy to say “hypothetical” *mu (or minimally, the temporal subordinator *mu) is a shared trait of Chorotegan, Otopamean, and Chinantecan (I haven’t yet gone looking for this in Tlapanecan), but the question remains: is this a shared innovation useful for subclassification, a retention, or a diffused trait? All I can say at the moment is that I do not have any strong reason to rule out or cast doubt on this feature being an innovation.\n\nAn Eastern Isoglosses: Animal Classifiers\n\nMany languages of Eastern Otomanguean show evidence of currently or once having morphemes which appear at the beginnings of lexemes referring to animals. Some of these languages also have other morphemes that appear at the beginnings of other kinds of words such as plants, things made from wood or stone, liquids, etc. For simplicity, we will call these “classifiers” and this discussion focusses on the “animal classifiers” (which in some languages can also appear on other animates or important items).\n\nMost of the Eastern Otomanguean branches have their own morpheme that appears on many names of animals (and sometimes other animates). In Zapotecan languages, this is most often *kwi= or *kwe=, ko in Popoloca, in Mixtecan *tu, in Amuzgo ki or ka. Kaufman associates the Proto-Zapotecan *kwe (and probably Popoloca’s ko-) with Chichimeco be, which if cognate would push this classifier back to Proto-Otomanguean.\n\nKaufman (2021) says of Chichimeco be “‘animal classifier’ [may occur w/ possessive prefixes]< **kve [kwe]”. I don’t have a lot of Chichimeco Jonaz sources, but I found something like this in Lastra (2014:47) where námbæʔæ and úbæʔæ are the possessive classifiers for animals for persons 1sg and 3pl, respectively. I am not prepared to analyze these forms to determine if be or perhaps bæʔæ can be separated from the rest of these possessive classifiers.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the usage of all these animal classifiers is not uniform across these branches. Zapotecan, Amuzgo and Popoloca have robust use of the animal classifiers whereas Mixtecan uses them much less frequently, and at least one member of Kaufman’s Mazatecan branch (Mazatec, Popoloca, Ixcatec, and Chocho), Chiquihuitlán Mazatec, doesn’t show much evidence for any animal classifiers at all. Mixtec languages, with their limited use of classifiers and signs of fossilization (e.g. Yosondúa Mixtec chaka ‘fish’ deriving from Proto-Mixtec *tɨ-yakaʔ ‘ANIMAL:CL-fish’) gives the impression that the animal classifier system may no longer be productive. (Though I hasten to say this could just be an artifact of looking at just a couple dictionaries available online–I believe there are Mixtec languages where the animal classifiers function as pronouns and are not simply fused to the starts of words, as is the case with the Zapotecan *kwi= and *kwe classifiers). On the contrary, San Juan Atzingo Popoloca even uses its ko classifier before loanwords (e.g. corana ‘frog’ from Sp. rana), which suggests that its classifier system is extremely robust and productive.\n\nWe should be careful here. Some of the animal classifiers used in certain branches are most likely not cognate with the others and even within branches there can considerable variation in the form of the classifier. For example, while most Chatino languages have a reflex of Proto-Zapotecan *kwi= or *kwe= as their animal classifier, Teojomulco Chatino appears to have used /ntwi-/, and some Western Zapotec languages, as well as Solteco Zapotec, which is sometimes included among them, use a lateral-initial classifier instead of reflex of the inherited labialized velar.\n\nHopkins (2012) drawing on a Chiapaneco-Spanish vocabulary (Aguilar Penagos 1992) described Chiapaneco as having noun classifiers and presumed that it was perhaps from this language that some Mayan languages calqued their own noun classification (as opposed to their numeral classification) systems.\n\nThe most extensive published source for Chiapaneco lexicon is Aguilar Penagos’ 1992 dictionary. While this dictionary has its limitations, it is suitable for identifying word-initial nominal classifiers. A great many animal terms in Chiapaneco begin with <no>, <nu>, or <na’>, which is certainly suggestive of some animal classifier, and many more words referring to plants and important objects begin with <na’>.\n\nHowever, the amount of fusion evident in these forms suggests to me that this phenomenon is quite old in Chiapaneco. Attempts to etymologize terms beginning with <no>, <nu>, or <na’> have not born much fruit. For example, I don’t see links between words like ‘squirrel’ <na’arí> and ‘beautiful’ <ari> or ‘bee’ <na’asaca> and ‘pure’ <asaca> to be very promising.\n\nSome of the <na’> forms, which is also found on words referring to plants, and some natural products such as lime, suggest that there may have been a reanalysis of Spanish words. For example, Aguilar Penagos provides <na’alashá> for ‘orange’ (Spa. naranja), though others appear to be common local Spanish words following <na’>: <na’lusii> ‘lusii’ (a local name for jaboncillo or algodoncillo), and <na’luyá>, ‘luyá’ (a local name for sospó, shaving brush tree), which suggests a separability of the classifier from the noun for Chipaneco-Spanish bilinguals.\n\nSo now we turn to the same question as with the “hypothetical” *mu, if this is a shared trait (and let’s presume for a moment that it is), is this an innovation, a retention, or a diffusion? In this case, I think the facts line up behind a diffusion explanation for the animal classifiers in most of these branches. The fact that each branch’s classifiers’ forms, functions, and prevalences differ widely strongly suggest to me that each branch recruited some of their own lexicon to function as these animal classifiers, though it’s not entirely out of the question for some of these classifiers to be related to one another. More detailed reconstructions of various eastern branches and relationships between these could help clarify if, for example, Atzingo Popoloca’s ko has anything to do with Proto-Zapotecan *kwi, *kwe or Amuzgo’s ki, ka. It’s very unlikely that the other branches’ classifiers have a common root. If Proto-Zapotecan *kwi, *kwe is actually related to Chichimeco’s be, then it’s possible that Zapotecan’s classifiers are a retention and the use of classifiers developed independently in the remaining branches, either through diffusion or just by chance.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn balance, even though Chorotegan appears to satisfy both the Western and the Eastern isoglosses discussed in this post (“hypothetical” *mu and animal classifiers), I think more weight should be given to the Western Otomanguean isogloss (*mu) as I am suspicious of the animal classifier trait being a diffusion. Later posts will discuss the *se causative isogloss for Eastern Otomanguean (spoiler: it’s inconclusive for Chorotegan), and Kaufman’s phonological isoglosses. As these rely on Kaufman’s reconstructions, it will probably be a while before I have anything much to say here about those."
