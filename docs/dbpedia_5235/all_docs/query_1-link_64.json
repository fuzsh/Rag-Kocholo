Further, Asselbergs goes beyond the “vision de los vencidos” narrative of the terrible, destructive, yet creative events of the early sixteenth century that were made available to us by Miguel León-Portilla. In this excellent monograph, Asselbergs reveals in stunning detail and through persuasive interpretation how the Spanish were not alone in their wars of conquista. As she writes about the Spaniards, “they had a most unlikely ally—indigenous conquistadors—an ally whose history, although written, has yet to become well-known or properly understood.” What we come to understand in this book is that thousands of indigenous soldiers, captains, and African servants provided the crucial support and leadership xi\n\nForeword\n\nthat led to the conquest and the early stages of colonial domination. Asselbergs, building on recent scholarship and her innovative readings of a Nahua manuscript, tells us the story of a “joint conquest” in which native peoples and Spanish invaders were “equal allies seeking advancement by combining their forces.” What is especially significant and exciting about this book is Asselbergs’s close contextual interpretation of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, a fascinating pictorial document based on Nahua historical traditions about the military traditions and achievements of local warriors. Readers of this book gain a double advantage in the study of Mesoamerican history and culture: they are granted access to the pictographs and historiography of this single lienzo, and they learn a significant amount about the wider Nahua pictographic traditions that were painted, believed, and ritualized in many parts of Mesoamerica. Although several other studies of this lienzo have been done, Asselbergs is able to identify more thoroughly the places, people, events, and time frame of the narrative. She also achieves a persuasive understanding of the historical and cultural context of this colonial masterpiece. A welcome dimension of the book is an analysis of some of the historical individuals who formed alliances and provided leadership in the crucial early years of the colonial period. We are guided by an insightful discussion that addresses questions about the indigenous allies: Why did they participate? What kind of services did they provide? How did they perceive this episode in history? and, What was their situation after the conquest? The answers to these questions present a new vision of the world that animated the lives of indigenous Mesoamericans during the first half century after the Spaniards arrived. The indigenous warriors were themselves conquistadors, but Asselbergs shows us that they were “conquered conquistadors” and thereby opens up new paths of interpretation in the scholarship on colonial Mexico and Guatemala. We are grateful for her precise interpretations and her general contribution to Mesoamerican scholarship.

I do not have the words to thank them enough. I will mention them here, hoping I have not forgotten anybody. First, I would like to thank the Netherlands Foundation for the Advancement of Tropical Research (WOTRO) and the Research School for Asian, African, and Amerindian Studies (CNWS) at Leiden University for their financial support that made my research possible. I would also like to thank my advisers, Maarten Jansen and Willem Adelaar, and the staff and colleagues at the CNWS for supporting me during my research and for providing a very pleasant working environment. Next, I would like to mention the staff and employees of the archives, libraries, and museums abroad where I have worked during the past four years. I xiii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nthank Ferdinand Anders and Eva Irblich for helping me during my study of the Mapa Circular de Quauhquechollan at the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna in 2000. Second, I thank the staff and employees at the Archivo General de la Nación and the Archivo del Registro Agrario Nacional in Mexico City; the Archivo General del Estado de Puebla, the Archivo de Notarias, the Archivo del Ayuntamiento (Archivo General Municipal), and the Archivo del Registro Agrario de Puebla in Puebla; the Archivo General de Centro América in Guatemala City; the Centro de Investigaciones Regionales de Mesoamerica in Antigua Guatemala; and the Archivo General de Indias in Seville, Spain, for allowing me to work in their institutions in 2001 and 2003 and for generously providing the help I needed. Furthermore, I am indebted to the Gobierno del Estado de Puebla, the Secretaría de Cultura del Estado de Puebla, and the staff and employees at the Casa del Alfeñique and the Museo Poblano de Arte Virreinal (San Pedro Museo de Arte) in Puebla, Mexico, for allowing me to take pictures of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan in 2001 and of the Codex Huaquechula in 2004. I express special thanks to Lic. Evelien Flores Rueda, Arq. Maribel Hernándes Sánchez, Ana Martha Hernández Castillo, and Claudia Coronado García. I thank Manuel Hermann Lejarazu, Mónica Salazar López, and Marie van der Meeren for making it possible for me to examine the two extant copies of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan in the Biblioteca Nacional de Antropología e Historia in Mexico City. The cooperation of these institutions and their employees has been crucial to my work, and I owe them an enormous debt. I express my gratitude and deep affection for the family of Doña Felicitas Ramirez Tufiño and for Don Gonzalo Alejo Martínez, Don Vincente Martinez León, and Don Cándido Reyes Castillo, all from San Martín Huaquechula, the former Quauhquechollan. I also extend my gratitude and affection to Ricardo Pérez Quitt and his family, especially Duardo, for their friendship and support during my work in Puebla and Mexico City. Other people who helped me during fieldwork are Bob Schalkwijk, Vincent Stanzione, and Ed Carter. I am also grateful to Claudia Koning for her company and support during several fieldwork trips. Of course, there have been many others, many of them strangers in the streets or behind the scenes, who have contributed to my fieldwork. I am deeply grateful to them, too. I also express appreciation for my colleagues. First, I would like to mention Michel Oudijk, with whom I have had many lively conversations and who has generously shared his extensive knowledge and ideas with me. His contributions to my research and to this book have been considerable. The transcriptions of the AGI Justicia 291 and AGI Patronato 245 documents used and quoted in this book are from his hand. I am also very much indebted to Ruud van Akkeren. After I discovered that the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan depicts Guatemala, he spent many hours with me studying and discussing the document, and he identified several of the place glyphs. Christopher Lutz offered countless valuable xiv\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nsuggestions regarding sources on Guatemalan history and provided me with a copy of his transcription of the AGI Justicia 295 document. His confidence in my work has been an enormous inspiration, and I am deeply grateful for his continuous support and for his friendship. I express special gratitude to Maria Castañeda de la Paz, Bas van Doesburg, Hans Roskamp, and Laura Matthew, all of whom have contributed to my work in significant ways as well. This book also benefited greatly from the presentations and insightful remarks of my fellow participants in the Ph.D. seminars at Leiden University between 2000 and 2004: Gabina Aurora Pérez Jiménez, Laura Van Broekhoven, Nicolas Carretta, Rosanna Woensdregt, Enrique García García, Kim Take, Michael Swanton, Alex Geurds, Lea Zuyderhoudt, José Humberto Medina González, Peter Jiménez Betts, and Gilda Hernández Sánchez. I also thank them for their friendship. I am particularly grateful to Michael for his linguistic advice and to Rosanna for her many insightful remarks, for reviewing my transcriptions, and for her other contributions to my work. Other colleagues who have inspired or helped me are Davíd Carrasco, James McAllister, Wendy Kramer, the late Luis Reyes García, Alfredo López Austin, Leonardo Lopez Luján, the late Hilda Aguirre Beltrán, Juan José Batalla Rosado, Susan Schroeder, Yanna Yannakakis, and Robinson Herrera. Also, I thank Françoise Hatchondo, who restored the lienzo in Mexico City in 2005, for sharing her technical observations with me. Michel Oudijk, Michael Swanton, and Rosanna Woensdregt proofread this book, or parts of it. I thank David Thompson and Cheryl Carnahan for their copyediting.

Introduction\n\nI would wish Your Grace to know that the country [Guatemala] is healthy and the climate temperate, and well populated, with many strong towns . . . the which, with all the subject towns and neighborhoods, I have placed under the yoke and in the service of the royal crown of His Majesty. —Pedro de Alvarado in his third letter to the king of Spain, written in Utatlan on April 11, 1524 (Mackie 1924:65)\n\nfue publico e notorio que si los yndios amygos no vinyeran de las provinçias de mexico con el d[ic]ho adelantado [Pedro de Alvarado] no se pudiera conquystar la provinçia de guatimala ny la de honduras. —Diego de Mançanares, one of the indigenous conquistadors who had fought in Alvarado’s army during the conquest of Guatemala and Honduras, June 30, 1564 (AGI Justicia 291, f. 127r)\n\nConquest: the word brings up violent images of war and destruction and their related horrors—the tension before each battle, the blood and screams of the dying, and the sickening silence when at last the victorious have conquered. It is a story told over and over throughout history. And regrettably, it is one that will in all likelihood be told many more times before humankind finds peace within itself. During the first half of the sixteenth century, Mesoamerica was conquered in the name of the Spanish king. This titanic clash of two worlds has been recorded as ending in the pacification of the region by a handful of triumphant and valiant Spanish captains. But there is another story to be told. History, it is said, is written by the victors, but the Spanish were not alone in their victory. They had a most unlikely ally—indigenous conquistadors—an ally\n\nIntroduction\n\nwhose history, although written, has yet to become well-known or properly understood. The topic of the Spanish conquest of Mesoamerica first became en vogue in the scholarly world with William Hickling Prescott’s History of the Conquest of Mexico, first published in 1843. Like many others, Prescott attributed the success of the conquest primarily to the Europeans’ superiority over the indigenous population. Approximately a century later, Robert Ricard portrayed the colonization of Mesoamerica as a spiritual conquest, attributing its success largely to the work of the mendicant orders (1933). Many works followed, in which the Spanish conquistadors, whether military leaders or clergy, were featured as the conquering forces.1 The subjection of Guatemala to Spanish rule has likewise long been (and often still is) represented as a controlled process of pacification under Pedro de Alvarado and his brothers. Behind these apparently Spanish successes, however, is the poorly understood but indispensable role of thousands of indigenous captains and soldiers and their retinues, as well as African servants and slaves, who together provided the manpower and knowledge needed to make the Spanish conquest work. Only in recent years have scholars begun to focus on the story of the indigenous conquistadors, discovering the nature and indispensability of the many alliances established between the Spaniards and the indigenous population.2 This research shows clearly that the indigenous conquistadors who assisted the Spaniards experienced the conquest very differently from the Spaniards. In the historical documents they created, they tell a story of a joint conquest, one in which both Spaniards and indigenous conquistadors are seen as equal allies seeking advancement by combining their forces. The present work focuses on a Nahua source concerning the conquest of Guatemala, composed by indigenous conquistadors from the Central Mexican Nahua town of Quauhquechollan, Puebla. The Quauhquecholteca established an alliance with the Spaniards in 1520, and they assisted them in the subjection of the Mexica Empire and other areas in Mexico. In 1523, a first campaign to Guatemala was organized and executed under the command of Pedro de Alvarado. Four years later, when Pedro left for Spain, his brother Jorge de Alvarado was called upon to take over the conquest of the country, and between 5,000 and 6,000 Central Mexican allies departed with him to take part in this campaign. Among this combined army of indigenous and Spanish conquistadors were Quauhquecholteca conquistadors. In the subsequent three years, this army accomplished most of the pacification of what is now Guatemala. Once the initial period of conquest was over, some Quauhquecholteca veterans of Jorge de Alvarado’s army founded a colony near the present-day town of Ciudad Vieja in Guatemala. They continued to live there, enjoying privileged status as indigenous conquistadors for at least a few decades. During this period, the Quauhquecholteca units’ military achievements and experiences were\n\nIntroduction\n\ndocumented by Quauhquecholteca tlacuiloque (scribes), who worked in either Quauhquechollan or Guatemala. These scribes created a large pictorial document made according to Nahua historical traditions. This document is presently known as the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan. In a setting of roads, rivers, and place glyphs, the painters depicted the journey of the Quauhquecholteca units from Quauhquechollan to and through Guatemala. They depicted the units’ military successes and several other events and described the landscape in which the conquistadors of their community came to live. The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan tells the story of the conquest of Guatemala as seen through the eyes of the Quauhquecholteca, reflecting their concerns, ideology, and historical awareness. It is a narrative of conquest and migration. It is a unique source, not only because it represents the Spanish conquest from a Nahua point of view but also because it was composed in a Nahua medium of communication (narrative pictography) and with, most likely, a Nahua public in mind. The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan was made according to Nahua traditions, and therefore it will be dealt with as belonging to the large corpus of surviving Nahua pictographic documents made in what is now Mexico, regardless of whether this lienzo was made in Quauhquechollan or in its colony in Guatemala. Conquest and migration are prevalent themes in this corpus of pictorial stories, especially in those that report prehispanic events. The best-known example is undoubtedly the Codex Mendoza, a Mexica (Aztec) pictorial that represents the conquests of Mexica rulers between 1383 and 1521. The pictorial records of conquest created in the colonial period are a continuation of this tradition. The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is not an isolated creation. Other communities that sent out conquistadors with the Spaniards produced similar pictorials. Particularly suitable for comparison are the several versions of the famous Lienzo de Tlaxcala from Tlaxcala, another Central Mexican Nahua community, which record the military achievements of Tlaxcalteca units under the Spanish banner. Another Tlaxcalteca document is the Lienzo de Analco, which pertains to the municipality of Nuestra Señora de los Remedios Analco, presently part of San Ildefonso Villa Alta, Oaxaca. The Lienzo de Analco tells the story of Tlaxcalteca conquistadors who participated in the conquest of the Sierra Norte, Oaxaca, and founded a colony there. Reportedly, a Central Mexican colony in Totonicapan, Guatemala, once had a conquest pictorial as well, but the whereabouts of this document are unknown (see Chapter 5). These documents seem to have been created not only for the purpose of recording the communities’ conquest histories. They also addressed the need to keep order and the need to understand and find a way to deal with the new postconquest situation. After all, the European intrusion and the changes it brought about were drastic and destructive for the indigenous peoples. Most important, however, these documents served as proofs of identity and legitimization of\n\nIntroduction\n\nstatus for the indigenous rulers and their communities. The Quauhquecholteca conquest pictorial and most of those of the Tlaxcalteca were created shortly after the conquest. They reflect the indigenous communities’ contemporary perception of the conquest as a joint one and as one that led to their own advancement. None of the extant pictorials represents the Spanish conquest as a humiliating event. Instead, the alliances with the Spaniards take their place in indigenous history as the beginning of a new conquest story for the communities in question, continuous with prehispanic processes of conquest and domination. Of the many books written on the conquest of Guatemala, I would like to mention the work of Wendy Kramer. In her book, Encomienda Politics in Early Colonial Guatemala, 1524–1544: Dividing the Spoils (1994), she provides a detailed analysis of a large number of published sources and unpublished archival documents, and she presents a clear and accurate overview of the leading people and events of this period. Kramer was also the first historian to fully recognize Jorge de Alvarado’s role in the conquest of Guatemala. Another work that stands out is Laura Matthew’s dissertation, Neither and Both: The Mexican Indian Conquistadors of Colonial Guatemala (2004). Matthew’s research sheds new light on the situation of the indigenous allies from Mexico who settled in Guatemala after the conquest period and continued to live there, with a focus on those who settled in Ciudad Vieja. Her study is likewise based on many unpublished archival documents and also on extensive fieldwork in Guatemala. Chapter 5 of this book depends substantially on both Kramer’s and Matthew’s work. For detailed narratives of the role of indigenous conquistadors in the conquest of Mexico and Guatemala, the works of Matthew Restall (1998, 2003) and Michel Oudijk (Oudijk and Restall 2007) also deserve particular mention.\n\nDefinition of the Research Problem The present work focuses primarily on the reading and contextualization of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan. Previously, the document was studied by Hilda Judith Aguirre Beltrán, who analyzed it using the Galarza method.3 For Aguirre Beltrán’s analysis, I refer to her Ph.D. thesis, El Códice: Lienzo de Quauhquechollac. Manuscrito pictográfico indígena tradicional Azteca-Nahuatl (2 volumes, 1999), in which she presented an elaborate descriptive analysis of the manuscript. The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is also regularly mentioned in scholarly studies. Nonetheless, no one has ever identified the locations of the place glyphs depicted in the document or recognized the area represented as Guatemala.4 Instead, it was generally presumed that the landscape depicted represented a region in the neighborhood of Quauhquechollan. Therefore, the places, persons, events, and time frame depicted were never identified correctly. The objectives of my study are (1) to decipher the pictographic contents of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan; (2) to identify the places, people, events, and\n\nIntroduction\n\ntime frame of the narrative depicted; (3) to come to an understanding of the purpose, message, and possible meanings of the work; and (4) to place the document and its narrative within its historical, cultural, and ideological contexts to permit its use as a historical source. Over time, the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan served in various contexts, starting with the one for which it was originally created and proceeding on to the museum context in which it serves today. Too little is known about the history of the document, however, to reconstruct all these contexts. The present thesis therefore limits its focus to the original purpose for which it was created. This book begins with an introductory section, intended to lay the foundation for the analysis. The present chapter provides a brief introduction to the Nahua pictographic script and the so-called lienzo genre. Chapter 2 presents the theory and methodologies used to come to a reading and interpretation of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan. Since no specific information is available on the authors of the pictographic document or on where, when, and why the document was created, the structure and the rhetoric (i.e., convincing power) of the text are our main keys to understanding it. Therefore, I chose to use iconology in combination with a rather structuralist approach to the text, also borrowing some tools from semiotic narratology. Chapter 3 provides an introduction to the history of Quauhquechollan, the hometown of the main actors in the painting. The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is not the only pictorial made by the Quauhquecholteca. There are three others, presently known as the Genealogía de Quauhquechollan-Macuilxochitepec, the Codex Huaquechula, and the Mapa Circular de Quauhquechollan. The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, the Codex Huaquechula, and the Genealogía are presently in Puebla, Mexico. The Mapa Circular is now in Vienna. The Genealogía, the Codex Huaquechula, and the Mapa Circular all deal with local affairs and are of a more modest size than the Lienzo de Quauhque­ chollan. They will be discussed briefly, to place the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan within the context of Quauhquechollan’s indigenous historical record. In the following chapters I proceed with my study of the Lienzo de Quauh­ quechollan. Chapter 4 provides an examination of the document itself: its physical shape, history, and extant copies. Chapter 5 deals with the contextualization of the narrative depicted. In that chapter I give a brief overview of the most prominent persons and events involved in the conquest of Guatemala, with a primary focus on Jorge de Alvarado’s 1527–1529 term as lieutenant governor. The military achievements of Jorge de Alvarado are poorly documented and therefore often ignored in historical reconstructions. A study of unpublished sources, however, revealed that it was in these years and under his command that most of the Spanish conquest of what is now Guatemala was realized. The indigenous conquistadors, among whom were both Quauhquecholteca and Tlaxcalteca, played an important role in this period. I investigate the nature of their alliances with the Spaniards and their contributions to the conquest,\n\nIntroduction\n\nseeking to answer questions such as: Why did they participate? What kind of services did they provide? How did they perceive this episode in history? What was their situation after the conquest? The main sources for this exploration are documents composed by the indigenous allies themselves or ones in which they or their descendants testified. These documents have long been ignored in the reconstruction of the conquest of Guatemala as it is known today. Chapter 6 provides an overview of the basic conventions (pictorial codes) used in the manuscript. Then, in Chapter 7, I present my reading of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, using the historical data provided in Chapters 3 and 5. Chapter 8 is an analysis of the document’s structure and rhetoric. The chapter investigates questions such as: What does the selection of information presented in the document say about the concerns of the creators? How are the elements structured? What does one learn from the document’s format and layout? For what public was it intended, and what does this say about the relationship between the composers and the public? What do the contents and medium reveal about when and where it was made? What does the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan show us of the viewpoint of the Quauhquecholteca? More simply, this analysis asks, and attempts to answer, the key questions of who made the lienzo, where, when, for whom, and why. To come to a proper understanding of the document, it is essential to regard the work not as an individual object of information but rather as a physical body of data communicating the experiences and concerns of its creators and of the community to which they belonged. In Chapter 9, the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is compared to the extant versions of the Lienzo de Tlaxcala and the Lienzo de Analco. These pictographic documents all show the same ideological strategy and address the same concerns. They tell how the Quauhquecholteca and Tlaxcalteca allied with the Spaniards, highlighting their role in the conquest and focusing on their victories. Each document enhanced the self-image and position of the community for which it was made. There are many similarities between these documents but also a few important differences. Analyzing them as a corpus leads to a better understanding of each text and of the Quauhquecholteca and Tlaxcalteca perceptions of the Spanish conquest. The interpretation of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan presented in this book does not pretend to be exclusive of other interpretations; rather, it is offered as a tool that gives the reader the context and historical data necessary to use the manuscript as a historical source. The present study is also not to be considered the final word on the document. Pictographic documents like the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan were originally presented in combination with the perfor­mance of a storyteller. These oral traditions are now lost. Physically, the document is also incomplete: the right-hand part has been cut off and is unknown. Hence, the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is an incomplete body of information, which we attempt to fit into a history as yet only partly known to us today. Possibly, new\n\nIntroduction\n\ninformation will surface in the future that will provide new insights regarding both the document itself and the history it communicates. In 2002, my colleague Rosanna Woensdregt and I made a large-sized historical lienzo. By doing so, we became particularly aware that each person, each scene, and each element depicted in a pictorial document communicates a message or messages: some obvious, others hidden. If the reader is familiar with the subject, some images trigger the memory of entire stories. Without knowing the details of the background of a story, it is impossible to identify all of the messages the author(s) intended to communicate. This is a major difference between the creation of a lienzo and an alphabetic text. Participating in the creative process of a lienzo gave me insight into the many layers of information that can be incorporated in a pictorial narrative, be they intended or unintended by the makers, and into the complexity and diversity of the medium. In other words, because the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is presently incomplete and a gap exists in time, knowledge, and worldview between the sixteenth-century indigenous world and the present scientific world, much of the encoded information and message will likely remain unknown.\n\nTerminology and Orthography The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan was made by artists who belonged to the community presently known as San Martín Huaquechula, cabacera of the municipality with the same name. This town is located in the Valley of Atlixco in the southeastern part of the present-day state of Puebla, Mexico. Quauhquechollan is the prehispanic Nahuatl name for this town. The word consists of the elements quauh–Nahuatl for “eagle,” quechol–“quecholli bird,” and (t)lan–place-­ name suffix (“place of ”), and can be translated as “Eagle quecholli place.” In the sixteenth-century sources this name is spelled many different ways: Cuauhquechollan, Cuauhquecholan, Quauhquechollan, Quauhquecholan, Guaquechula, and so on. For consistency in this book and to avoid confusion, I only use the name Quauhquechollan. I do not use the modern name. With regard to the orthography of the Nahuatl community names used in this book, I normally write them the way I found them most frequently used in the sixteenth-century sources I consulted. This means I do not use the Spanish accents. The same applies to Nahuatl personal names, such as Xicotencatl and Ixtlilxochitl. I make exceptions, however, for community names that are presently well-known (e.g., Tlaxcala instead of Tlaxcallan, Escuintla instead of Yzquintepeque). For indigenous place-names in Guatemala other than Nahuatl names, I use either the old names used in the sources or the indigenous spellings currently used (e.g., K’iche’ instead of Quiché). Throughout this book I use the words “Mexico” and “Guatemala.” Unless indicated otherwise, I use these names to refer to land within the boundaries of\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe present-day countries. With the words “Mexican” and “Guatemalan,” I refer to the inhabitants of these lands. Also, although neither Mexico nor Guatemala was ever officially a European colony, they were treated as such. Therefore, in line with other writers, I apply the word “colonial” to describe the status of these countries after the Spanish conquest. Another term that requires clarification is the word “Aztec.” Aztec originally designated the inhabitants of Aztlan, the place of origin of the Mexica of Tenoch­ titlan. In his early-nineteenth-century work, however, the naturalist Alexander von Humboldt erroneously used the word “Aztec” to designate the Mexica of Tenochtitlan. As a result, the word “Aztec” started to appear in the literature in various contexts, and a long tradition of incorrect usage was established. At times, the word is used for all the inhabitants of the Basin of Mexico in the Late Postclassic period. At other times, the culturally related inhabitants of the Puebla-Tlaxcala valleys are also referred to. The word also refers to the peoples who made up the Triple Alliance. Furthermore, the term has been used to designate speakers of the Nahuatl language, the language itself, and even ceramic types that have nothing to do with either the Mexica or the inhabitants of Aztlan. In other words, “Aztec” has become a problematic term involving historical inaccuracy and ambiguity (López Austin 2001:68). I have therefore tried to avoid it. However, since so many earlier scholars have used it, I also use the word on some occasions for the sake of convenience. When used, the word “Aztec” should be understood to refer to the Mexica of Tenochtitlan and the members of the Triple Alliance contemporaneous with the period of conquest. For the most part, however, I use the term “Mexica.”\n\nNahua Pictography In contrast to peoples who relied on alphabetical or other methods of writing, the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica developed a system that combined oral and pictographic images to record and transmit information. In the sixteenth century the Spanish friar Diego Durán wrote: “todo lo tenían escrito y pintado en libros y largos papeles con cuentas de años meses y dias en que habían acontecido tenían escritas en estas pinturas sus leyes y ordenanzas sus padrones & c. todo con mucha órden y concierto de lo cual había excelentísimos historiadores que con estas pinturas componían historias amplisimas de sus antepasados” (Durán 1984 I:226). Modern scholars have not always shared Durán’s perception of the Meso­ american pictorials as valuable historical sources.5 As a result, the contents of most Mexican pictorials were often ignored in historical reconstructions. Over the past few decades, however, these documents have become the subject of many scholarly investigations, and fortunately their unique value as historical evidence has again been rediscovered.6\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is a most edifying example of the Nahua pictorial writing tradition as practiced in the Basin of Mexico and its immediate surroundings in Late Postclassic and Early Colonial times. The system was likely used before that period as well.7 The system consists of a combination of two types of pictographs: (1) images that are stylized or conventionalized representations of things present in the world around us (for example, roads, water, plants, animals, persons), and (2) logographic signs used for personal names, placenames, and dates (i.e., hieroglyphs with phonetic elements). Most pictographs are agreed-upon standards of graphic representation, and they are structured and organized in such a way that a narrative is told. The script is therefore generally referred to as “narrative pictography” (Prem 1992:53). Since most conventions were not confined to a particular language, they were used and understood by the inhabitants of a variety of political entities in Mexico. Ñuudzavui (Mixtec), Benizaa (Zapotec), and Otomí or Ñañhu readers all used scripts with similar conventions. Variants of these scripts were used on stone (as inscriptions), the walls of buildings and caves, pottery, paper, bone, animal skin, and cloth. The surviving corpus of pictorial manuscripts includes book-size screenfolds (for example, Borgia group, Codex Nuttall ), scroll-like strips of animal skin or amate paper (often used for genealogies or tribute lists), manuscripts made after the model of European books (Codex Mendoza, Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca), and single panels of paper, hide, or (cotton) cloth in a variety of sizes (Johnson 2000:575). The arrival of the Spaniards in Mexico brought about the destruction of most prehispanic manuscripts. Regardless, the pictorial writing tradition was kept in use throughout the Early Colonial period. There are even some examples of eighteenth-century productions. Elements new to the indigenous traditions, such as European objects, three-dimensionality, and shade effects, were adopted as the system gradually adapted to function in the colonial world. Meanwhile, the indigenous nobility was educated in Spanish convents and learned the alphabetic script. For a while, both writing systems were used next to, or in combination with, each other, until alphabetic writing proved more functional and the pictorial writing system was used less and less. As time passed, many of the pictorial conventions were forgotten, and so were many of the oral traditions related to the extant pictorials. Presently, scholars know of the existence of perhaps 20 prehispanic and around 500 Early Colonial pictorials from Mexico. There are several references to pictorials produced in prehispanic and Early Colonial Guatemala as well, made according to either Maya or Nahua tradition. However, no prehispanic pictorials have survived, and the extant colonial pictorials from Guatemala are few in number (see Chapter 9). Nahua pictography is a relatively well-understood script, thanks to several factors, including (1) the existence of a large corpus of Nahua documents (both pictorial and textual), (2) familiarity with the Nahuatl language, and (3) the\n\nIntroduction\n\nexistence of direct translations of glyphic texts into alphabetic writing (like the Codex Mendoza, mentioned earlier). Also, some of the early alphabetic records created by indigenous writers (such as the Historia de los mexicanos por sus pinturas, a textual transcription of earlier painted annals; the Codex Florentino [Sahagún’s team]; and the writings of Ixtlilxochitl, chronicler from Texcoco) still reveal some of the indigenous (pictorial or oral) cognitive ways of structuring a text. However, since each document was made for the individual needs of a community and was created in its own historical and ideological context, the interpretation of the individual Nahua pictorials requires further study with regard to contextualization and to improve our understanding of their meaning. As Durán indicated, the tlacuiloque who composed the pictorials were professional artists and historiographers. These scribes were masters of the use of the pictorial codes, the use of space, and the art of composition. They also mastered the use of rhetorical tools to present a narrative in such a way that it affected the reader and the use of images of everyday objects to convey coded political, moral, and religious messages. In other words, they knew exactly how to use their liberty within the rules of the system to present and combine the elements in such a way as to come to a phase beyond the text: to provoke certain emotions within the reader. This structuring process (or “creative moment”) gave a power to the text, a meaning. Normally, these tlacuiloque worked under the authority of a lord or the local nobility. They based their work on orally transmitted texts, previous pictorials, and the wishes and concerns of the person or community that commissioned the work. With few exceptions, they never signed their works.8 Their names were seemingly considered irrelevant, probably because most pictorials were not meant to serve the cause of the artists but rather that of the artists’ lords and their community. The extant corpus of pictorials covers a variety of subjects: from genealogies, migration stories, war records, and tribute lists to socio-political organization maps, religious and calendrical documents, and cartographic-historical maps. Each so-called genre had its own specialized tlacuiloque. Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl wrote at the beginning of the seventeenth century: las pinturas y caracteres que son con que están escritas y memorizadas sus historias, por haberse pintado al tiempo y cuando sucedieron las cosas acaecidas . . . tenían para cada género sus escritores, unos que se trataban de los anales poniendo por su orden las cosas que acaecían en cada un año, con día, mes y hora. Otros tenían a su cargo las genealogías y descendencia de los reyes y señores de linaje, asentando por cuenta y razón los que nacían y borraban los que morían, con la misma cuenta. Unos tenían cuidado de las pinturas de los términos, límites y mojoneras de las ciudades, provincias, pueblos y lugares, y de las suertes y repartimientos de las tierras, cuyas eran y a quien pertenecían. Otros, de los libros de las leyes, ritos y ceremonias que usaban en su infidel-\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nidad: y los sacerdotes, de los templos, de sus idolatrías y modo de su doctrina idolátrica y de las fiestas de sus falsos dioses y calendarios. Y finalmente, los filósofos y sabios que tenían entre ellos, estaba a su cargo el pintar todas las ciencias que sabían y alcanzaban, y enseñar de memoria todos los cantos que observaban sus ciencias e historias. (Ixtlilxóchitl 1985 I:527)\n\nFor the sake of scholarly research and cataloging, previous scholars have classified the surviving Mexican pictorials into several groups (see Glass and Robertson 1975). This division was based on (1) the document’s material or format; (2) its genre, theme, or contents; and (3) the circumstances in which the document was made. The names by which most Mesoamerican pictorials are known today have been determined by a variety of circumstances, such as their place of origin, the place where they were (re)discovered, or a collector’s name. These names often also include references to the material or the theme (for example, lienzos, mapas, genealogías). It cannot be presumed, however, that the makers and users of the documents thought in terms of the same classifications or the same names. Their way of referring to their own works may have been very different, and modern classifications and names often tell us little about a pictorial’s original meaning or function. The unique value of the indigenous pictorials lies in the fact that they provide the indigenous version of history as captured in an indigenous medium of communication. In other words, they reflect the indigenous view of historical events, concepts, morals, and ideas, represented by a means of communication the indigenous peoples themselves developed and felt comfortable with. However, since the majority of the extant pictorials were made in a colonial context, they were often adapted to Spanish expectations or influenced by European iconographic and historiographic structures. The degrees of indigenous and European influence therefore depend largely on the document, the region and time period in which it was created, the author(s), the purpose for which it was made, and similar factors. Nonetheless, the corpus of extant pictorials provides unique insight into the indigenous history both before the conquest and throughout the colonial period.\n\nLienzos and Indigenous Cartography The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan belongs to both the so-called lienzo genre and the “cartographic histories” genre. The word lienzo (Spanish for cotton cloth, canvas, linen, or hemp) is generally applied in reference to pictorials that were painted on large cloth panels. It thus refers to the physical medium rather than the contents of a painting. The name “cartographic history,” in turn, is generally applied to pictorials that transmit both cartographical (toponymic) and historical information. Some cartographic histories emphasize cartography (like the Lienzo de Ocotepec, for example, which is almost fully cartographic), while 11\n\nIntroduction\n\nothers are mostly historical (like the Lienzo de Tlaxcala). However, both aspects are always represented.9 John Glass defined lienzos as follows: The lienzo is a sheet of cloth, frequently of considerable size. In Spanish arthistorical usage the word is similar to the English word “canvas.” The lienzo is usually made of narrow strips of cloth sewn together; they may be of cotton, maguey fibre, or other material. . . . The lienzo is the common medium for maps and documents recording village history and boundaries, especially those of the cartographic-historical type. (Glass 1975:9)\n\nIn their 1975 survey, Glass and Robertson recorded about fifty lienzos dating from the Early Colonial period to the nineteenth century and eighty-seven cartographic histories. The bulk of these documents were painted in the modern Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacan, Puebla, Tlaxcala, and Veracruz in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. A few came from the state of Mexico and the Distrito Federal. Although the indigenous peoples of southeastern Mexico, Yucatan, and Guatemala are also known to have used pictographic scripts, no lienzos are known from those areas. The lienzo genre as we know it today thus seems to have been limited to specific areas. The 1975 census, however, does not include all extant lienzos. Others were identified and published after the census was made, and the fact that new lienzos continue to be brought to light indicates that local archives, churches, and private collections in Mexico and elsewhere still hold lienzos presently unknown to the academic world.10 Most lienzos consist of several quadrangular pieces of cloth sewn together that were separately woven on the native back-strap or body-tension loom. Cloth is thought to have been used for pictographic records in prehispanic times as well. Unfortunately, however, no example seems to have survived. A detailed study of the pieces of cloth used for certain lienzos has shown that in many cases, some edges or seams have ribbed borders while others do not. Johnson (2000) therefore argued that those pieces were originally woven for another use, such as clothing, and were only later used for lienzos. This seems a reasonable hypothesis.11 Some lienzos also contain pieces with a palimpsest. One of the pieces of cloth in the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan shows traces of just such an erased previous painting (see Chapter 4). In other words, some pieces of cloth used for lienzos had been recycled.12 One can assume that the shape and size of a lienzo were primarily determined by the document’s purpose, although they may also have been influenced by the availability of cloth. The narrative pictography was painted directly on the cloth. Some lienzos show sketches of incomplete and uncolored drawings to the side of the final painting. This indicates that the tlacuiloque first made sketches to divide the space of the document and to determine a composition before they proceeded with a final version. Such traces of sketches can also be found in the Lienzo de\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nQuauhquechollan. The pigments used in colonial lienzos were often of traditional indigenous manufacture, in combination with European colorants. The most common were black, the dark red cochineal, a fine blue-green called matlalli, yellow, and a red and a green obtained from certain minerals (Valle 1997:9). The painting styles and techniques used in Mexican lienzos vary over time and from community to community, although some seem to be clearly the product of a certain artistic “school” (Gruzinski 1993; Robertson 1994). Some lienzos are primarily indigenous in style and content (e.g., the Lienzo de Tuxpan, Lienzo de Tequixtepec II, and Lienzo de Zacatepec). Others are clear examples of the new painting style that resulted from the combination of indigenous and European elements (i.e., concepts, styles, perspectives, colors, layout, and materials).13 The largest known example of a Mexican lienzo is the sixteenth-century Lienzo Seler II from Coixtlahuaca, Oaxaca (4.25 × 3.75 m; see Glass and Robertson 1975:110). At 3.25 × 2.35 m, the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is among the larger ones as well. With regard to the pictographic elements and layout of the extant lienzos, I identified these common characteristics: 1. There is almost always a central place, usually represented by a place glyph and a temple or a church. This central place is usually situated more or less in the center of the painting, or, if elsewhere, it is shown in considerable size. A lienzo usually reflects the interests and needs of the community associated with this central place glyph, and it was often painted there. Most lienzos are concerned with small-scale local history, although there are exceptions, such as the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan and the various versions of the Lienzo de Tlaxcala. 2. Near this central place, one often finds a reference to its founders and its rulers or a ruling genealogy, sometimes in combination with a depiction of the establishment of a political alliance. 3. Other places depicted in a lienzo are always related to the main place in some way. These relations are usually of a political, economic, military, or geographic nature. The other places are subject towns or tribute towns, conquered places, linderos (border places), neighboring altepetl (“city-states”), and similar places. 4. Lienzos also show the people involved in events such as the foundation of settlements, conquests, the subjugation of an enemy, and ritual performances. Normally, the main actors in the narrative are related to the central place. Lienzos often represent the history of local lords by depicting the genealogies, achievements, and migrations of their ancestors. In most cases they also designate the borders of the territory to which the ancestors laid claim. Land claims were usually defined historically rather than geographically, and the emphasis was primarily on the history and achievements of the people who possessed these lands (see also Kagan 2000:115–116).\n\n13\n\nIntroduction\n\n5. Movements and connections are usually indicated by means of roads or lines with footprints. These roads serve as graphic links to make the separate elements of the narrative a coherent whole and to indicate the movement of the actors and the structure and reading direction of the narrative. Although the exact distances and the spatial relationships between the toponyms depicted are often not precisely defined in lienzos, the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan does give that information accurately. 6. Sometimes elements of flora and fauna (trees, plants, animals), or other place indications such as rivers, roads, mountains, lakes, springs, and seas, are added. Some lienzos are bordered on one or more sides by a band of water (“sea band”).14 Later lienzos (seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) generally show more of such elements than the earlier lienzos (sixteenth century). 7. If explanatory texts are added, they are usually transcriptions of personal names and toponyms. Larger texts are added only in a few occasions. 8. In general, only actors, places, and events that were of influence on the formation and situation of the community in question at the time of the manuscript’s creation are depicted. The places, actors, and events depicted were generally selected on the basis of their relevance to both the community and the purpose of the work.\n\nMost lienzos from the state of Oaxaca emphasize dynastic foundations and genealogies of ruling families, going back four or five centuries before the Spanish conquest. Most lienzos from the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, and Michoacan, in turn, record a more contemporary history, often related to the Spanish conquest (Mundy 2001:121; see also Chapter 8). Scholars have subcategorized the corpus of extant lienzos based on their themes (territorial, genealogical, historical, or a combination) and on their structure or layout. Distinctions are made between (1) “road maps,” dealing with migration histories and conquest journeys, (2) “idealized maps” (subdivided into rectangular and circular ones), (3) the socalled Texcoco type (characterized by a unique sort of geographic realism), and (4) mixtures of these types.15 The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan belongs to the first category, as it shows both a conquest journey and the migration history of the Quauhquecholteca who founded a colony in Guatemala. Unlike folded codices, lienzos were meant to be viewed flat, and accordingly they are painted on one side only. It seems that they were put on a wall (as is still done in some indigenous communities), laid on the floor, or both. The seventeenth-century chronicler Francisco de Burgoa referred to a manuscript, possibly a lienzo, that was hung on the walls of an indigenous palace (Mundy 2001:121). The Lienzo de Tlaxcala seems to have served a similar purpose (see Chapter 9). Barbara Mundy raised the possibility that lienzos may also have been hung out like banners on festival and market days (Mundy 2001:121). The use of lienzos on the floor seems the most plausible assumption, though, since most\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nlienzos show people and places in a variety of orientations. When displayed on the floor, readers can walk around the document, creating diverse orientations depending on where and from which angle they see what is depicted. At the same time, a use on the floor (and also on a wall) transforms the lienzo into a physical microversion of the landscape of the narrative. A lienzo was not read silently, as one reads books today. Instead, its presentation was a public event. A storyteller (tlamatini in Nahuatl) presented the oral traditions related to the text. These orally recited texts often included dialogues, songs, and prose and must have answered many “why” and “how” questions about the actors in the narrative, their motivations, and the meaning of events.16 They helped viewers understand the contents and meaning of the pictorial. They may also have revealed information on how nonmaterial, nonphysical circumstances17 shaped the tlacuiloque’s understanding of the past and present and on the internal mechanisms within the community that determined the presentation of the narrative (i.e., which persons and events were considered relevant to depict, and which were considered less relevant and were subsequently left out). The transformation of oral traditions to pictorial documents was never a complete replacement of the former by the latter. Pictorials and orally recited texts were used in combination, and each played an essential part within indigenous historiography. The oral texts that accompanied the pictorials were thus essential and indispensable parts of the messages. The tradition of creating large paintings with conquest narratives for public viewing was familiar to the Spaniards. In the same decades in which lienzos on the conquest of Mexico and Guatemala were created, in Spain large tapestries were made showing the conquest of Tunis by Charles V, which likewise served a public function.18 These tapestries, part of a long tradition of tapestry making in Europe, may have been presented in combination with storytelling events as well. Thus, a mutual understanding of this tradition must have existed, at least to some degree.\n\nIndigenous and European Cartography Since no pre-conquest lienzo has survived, some doubt that maps in the modern sense of the term (i.e., the projection of a three-dimensional spatial reality onto a flat surface) existed in prehispanic Mesoamerica. Particularly outspoken on this issue is the anthropologist Arthur Miller, in whose view indigenous maps emerged only after 1521 and as a result of the conquest (Miller 1991:171). Other authors, however, have argued in favor of pre-conquest indigenous maps (see, for example, Boone 1992; Kagan 2000). I agree with the latter. Indications of a prehispanic mapping tradition can be found in the alphabetic references and by extrapolating backward from surviving colonial pictorials. Several arguments can be raised: 15\n\nIntroduction\n\n1. As appears from the Codex Florentino, the Mexica made and consulted pictorial maps to plan their military campaigns and prepare their attack strategies (see Sahagún 1950–1982:2, book 8, f. 33v).19 The same happened in Michoacan (see Acuña 1987). 2. It is known that the Tlaxcalteca also had a long tradition of painting conquest histories in lienzos, as is clear in these words of Díaz del Castillo: “y trajeron [the lords of Tlaxcala] pintadas en unos grandes paños de henequén las batallas que con ellos [the Mexica] habían habido, y la manera de pelear” (Díaz del Castillo 1992:212 [ch. LXXVIII]). Motecuhzoma was likewise informed about the arrival of various Spanish conquistadors in Mexico by messengers, sent from Veracruz, who brought him the information painted in lienzos. Andrés de Tapia wrote: At this time Moctezuma called the marqués [Hernán Cortés] to show him a mantle on which were painted eighteen ships, five of them wrecked on the coast and turned over in the sand. This is the way the Indians have of conveying news accurately. He told the marqués that the ships had been wrecked eighteen days ago on the coast, almost a hundred leagues from the port. Then another messenger came with a painting that showed certain ships anchoring in the port of Veracruz, and the marqués feared it was an armed force sent out against us. (Tapia 1963:44, transl. Kranz 2001)\n\n3. Cortés mentioned that Motecuhzoma had prepared for him a cloth map of the coast of Mexico, with all its rivers and coves, and that the rulers of Tabasco and Xicalango also presented to him a road map on cloth (Kagan 2000:47–48). The indigenous peoples thus clearly had the skills to make such maps. 4. The European chronicler Peter Martyr (or Pietro Martire d’Anghiera) mentioned two indigenous maps Cortés had sent to Spain in 1522. One was painted on a piece of cotton cloth about 10 m long and depicted the Mexica provinces and their enemy states. The other was a smaller map, representing Tenochtitlan and its temples, bridges, and lakes. Both documents are lost, but Martyr’s remarks imply that these indigenous maps showed cartographic characteristics familiar to him as a European (Kagan 2000:49; Linné 1948:189). 5. Some of the colonial lienzos are clearly copies of prehispanic lienzos. Examples include some of the maps created in Cuauhtinchan, Puebla. These documents must be copies of fifteenth-century maps, as their temporal and thematic contents suggest that the originals were made when the Mexica conquered the region, not after the Spanish conquest (Reyes García 1988:10, 15). 6. The formats and layouts of some pictorial migration and conquest stories presented in a geographic setting show striking similarities. This also suggests a continuation of a longer and thus prehispanic tradition (see Chapter 8).\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\n7. There are various indirect indications of mapmaking skill. The order and detailed planning with which the Mexica built parts of Tenochtitlan and Texcoco, for example, indicate the work of urban designers and land surveyors capable of rendering ground plans useful for building purposes. None of these maps have survived, however (Kagan 2000:48). Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl also indicated that some tlacuiloque were specialized in the painting of maps (see earlier discussion), which points to the presence of such mapmakers in prehispanic society. 8. The geographic accuracy of the distribution of toponyms in some of the Early Colonial lienzos, along with the appearance of the genre over such a large geographic area, also indicate the existence of a longer tradition of so-called cartographic histories in Mexico and a basis for this tradition in prehispanic times.20\n\nThe surviving indigenous maps made in the Colonial period show various indications of a long tradition of indigenous mapmaking and reveal the differences between the indigenous way of representing geography and the mapping tradition familiar today. The major difference is that the indigenous peoples of Mexico represented geography in historical terms. They were primarily concerned with the historical aspect of a narrative, and to them places did not normally exist independent from history. Conversely, events were not necessarily place-related and could also be represented by persons or actions. The story being told usually determined the structure and content of the indigenous maps, and as storytelling instruments, these maps were therefore prone to different layers of representation. In addition, the physical shape of the document, conventions for the depiction of human actors in the maps based on their place in the social order, and the nature of the narrative represented each influenced the layout of indigenous maps. Most indigenous maps can best be described as “maps of experience”21 or “lived geographies”22 rather than maps representing a physical geography or linear connections. Other indigenous maps, however, do represent the distribution of the places on the ground very accurately, the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan being a good example. The works of the indigenous mapmakers were indeed very different from the contemporary maps of famous European cartographers such as Gemma Frisius, Gerard Mercator, and Abraham Ortelius (to whose works scholars tend to make comparisons). However, they were little different from the way the Spaniards who arrived in the Americas in the sixteenth century made maps.23 The latter also provided their maps with buildings and other images, projected historical events onto a geographical framework, and depicted the world in local, fairly personal, and often historical terms (Kagan 2000:46). Their focus was still mostly on territoriality, however, instead of on actors and events. Good examples of contemporary Spanish-made maps of Guatemala are the maps published with\n\n17\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe work of Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán, who wrote in the late seventeenth century (Fuentes y Guzmán 1932). In other words, when studying early indigenous maps, present-day scholars face a set of concepts different from the ones they are used to in modern cartography. Obviously, concepts such as “accuracy,” “order,” and “disorder” are very much culturally and temporally related, and in a historical map, what was a logical order to the indigenous tlacuiloque and contemporary readers is not necessarily logical to modern scholars. Likewise, the chronological ordering of events may not have been similarly significant to both. The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan shows these differences very clearly (see Chapters 7 and 8).\n\nColonial Indigenous Maps Some of the colonial Mexican pictorials were prepared to answer the needs of indigenous people. Others were made specifically for the colonial administration. A pictorial’s original purpose can be discerned in the way the narrative is presented, the selection of the information conveyed, and the rhetorical tools used by the tlacuiloque (see also Chapters 2 and 8). In lienzos or other maps created for a use within the indigenous sphere, geography was normally represented in relation to the history of a particular community (discussed earlier). They were mostly used to remind community members of their shared history and traditions, and so the tlacuiloque constructed the world primarily in human terms. From their perspective, space belonged to the people who inhabited it and had no independent, abstract existence (Kagan 2000:42). Most indigenous maps offered depictions from a “communicentric” rather than a “chorographic” viewpoint. While a chorographic viewpoint might offer a distant overview of a town and reduce towns to a series of elemental forms and shapes in accordance with a mathematical grid (as in “scientific” cartography), the communicentric viewpoint of the indigenous tlacuiloque focused on the human elements and structures of a community. Instead of presenting distant overviews, the tlacuiloque depicted their communities with close-up pictures of identifying structures (such as churches) and people associated with the community’s history and concerns. As these maps were often intended for a local public, that is, people familiar with these elements, the necessity of a description of the town was only a secondary concern. The messages embedded in these maps were therefore often meant primarily for the inhabitants of the community itself (Kagan 2000:108–109). Normally, pictorials created for an indigenous public were made to help structure collective memory, to offer a visual framework for understanding events, and to establish community identity (see also Leibsohn 1994:161). Obviously, the community’s view of itself that emerged from these pictorials was strongly influenced by the way the tlacuiloque structured and presented the story. 18\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn the other hand, indigenous maps specifically made for the colonial administration often show a different perspective on places in the landscape and a different interest in those places.24 Since territoriality was the main concern of the European judicial system, these documents are often characterized by a greater focus on territoriality than on historical information. Some documents of the lienzo genre were specifically created within the context of land claims or land disputes between communities, and they were presented in Spanish courts of law as evidence. Indigenous communities are known to have presented lienzos originally made for their internal use to Spanish authorities to support certain land claims as well. The lienzos entered the Spanish court for a “secondary” purpose, or what Mundy called a “second life,” often in combination with oral testimonies or alphabetic documents (Mundy 2001:121). Some documents combine pictography with alphabetic writing (in the form of alphabetic explanatory texts; i.e., glosses) to make their contents accessible to readers unfamiliar with the pictorial script. A well-known example in which Nahua pictography and alphabetic writing are used next to each other is the Codex Mendoza from Tenochtitlan.25 Often, documents originally made to serve in the indigenous sphere were later provided with glosses to enable them to serve cross-culturally in the Spanish sphere. It seems the indigenous tlacuiloque knew very well how to design a pictorial in such a way that it would help a community’s case with the Spaniards and at the same time serve the community itself. The speaker who presented the narrative could then focus on the aspect he or she knew was most interesting to the audience and that would enable the document to best serve its immediate purpose (Endfield 2001; Mundy 1996; Smith 1973). The fact that Spanish judges accepted indigenous lienzos and mapas as legal evidence in court is probably one of the reasons the indigenous pictographic tradition continued well into the post-conquest period. Well-known examples of Nahua historical cartographies are the maps related to the Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca from Cuauhtinchan, Puebla. Another wellknown example is the Codex Xolotl (1542), also a Chichimec history, which, in turn, consists of a series of maps in which battle sites and the territory of Chichimec influence are indicated by toponyms. Next to the lienzos and cartographic histories, a large corpus of post-contact maps is kept in museums and archives.26 The best-known Mexican maps are undoubtedly the maps that accompanied certain Relaciones Geográficas (see Gruzinski 1987, 1993; Mundy 1996). These maps date from the 1570s and 1580s and show a large variety of gradations in indigenousness and European influence; this influence is displayed mostly through the addition of landscape and three-dimensionality. Hundreds of other maps, the majority simple sketches done in pen and ink, were produced by indigenous communities in the course of boundary disputes brought to the Spanish court. Although these maps clearly reflect colonial concerns, they still contain features seemingly of indigenous origin and are valuable sources for the 19\n\nIntroduction\n\nreconstruction of prehispanic cartography. As it seems, pre-conquest cartography in Mesoamerica encompassed a broad spectrum of geographic representations that ranged from cadastral maps that were little different from European maps to historical cartographies that were more difficult for Europeans to understand. The conquest caused this spectrum to narrow, as well as a shift to European cartographic techniques, including the use of three-dimensionality and the depiction of landscape in naturalistic terms (Galarza 1995; Kagan 2000:46, 53).\n\nSummary This book presents a study of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, a large Nahua painting narrating the story of indigenous conquistadors from Quauhquechollan who participated in the “Spanish” conquest of Guatemala. Fortunately, the Nahua pictographic script is relatively well understood. The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is a continuation of a prehispanic tradition of recording migration and conquest stories in a geographic setting. Through Nahua pictographs and logographs ordered along a road, it depicts part of the history of the Quauhquecholteca community. Pictorials composed in this script were not read in silence but were presented during community rituals and accompanied by oral recitals. These recitals explained the pictography and provided details of the story not given visually. Among the corpus of surviving Nahua pictographic documents are documents with a geographic character, such as the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan. These manuscripts are generally referred to as “cartographic histories.” The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is named a lienzo because it is painted on cotton cloth. The Nahuas of Central Mexico already possessed the skills to make “accurate” geographic maps before the arrival of the Spaniards. Unfortunately, very few prehispanic pictorial documents have survived, which makes it impossible to trace the tradition back in time. However, the surviving colonial indigenous maps provide indications of how geography was generally dealt with in Central Mexican indigenous records. One of the most important differences with contemporary European maps is the fact that in indigenous records, geography did not exist independently from history. It was the story that made the maps, leading to depictions of “lived” or “felt” geographic maps rather than just territoriality. This book focuses on the reading of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan and the interpretation and contextualization of the story it communicates.\n\n20\n\nTheory and Methodology\n\nConquered Conquistadors 2. Theory and Methodology\n\nI believe that painting’s power over men is greater than that of poetry, and base this opinion on two reasons. The first is that painting works on us by means of the sense of sight. The second is that painting does not employ artificial signs, as does poetry, but natural signs. It is with these natural signs that painting makes its imitations. —Abbé Dubos in Critical Reflections on Poetry and Painting (1719) (Mitchell 1986:75)\n\nCodices and lienzos form an indispensable corpus of sources about the history of the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. They present a firsthand visual account of what happened in the indigenous communities from their own point of view. But even more interesting, they transmit this account by means of a medium the indigenous peoples themselves developed, felt comfortable with, and knew how to use to its fullest extent.1 Before attempting to infer historical meaning from the pictorials, however, one needs to decipher and understand their pictographic contents by looking at them within their historical, social, political, and ideological contexts. As with the study of any cultural object, the familiar problems of meaning, interpretation, authorial intention, context, reception, readership, and similar issues will inevitably arise.2 An interdisciplinary approach is therefore required. In this 21\n\nTheory and Methodology\n\nchapter I present a short overview of the theory, terminology, and methodologies pertaining to a variety of disciplines that have proved helpful in my study of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan. These intellectual tools aided in the formulation of the textual description and interpretation of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan discussed in later chapters.3\n\nTheory Nahua pictorials such as the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan serve multiple purposes. First, they provide historical information through narratives; they tell a story involving events, people (actors), and what these people do. Furthermore, they serve as media that communicate certain messages or concerns of the makers to the readers. Often, they encrypt moral, political, and religious messages within the “disguised symbolism” of everyday objects. Moreover, most Nahua pictorials are remarkable pieces of art. They provide unique visual impressions and leave their beholders-readers with the particular effect only images can create. These various aspects of the work all influence the way the stories presented in these documents were, and still are, understood and perceived. Over the past century, the study of Nahua pictorials has evolved from an analysis that was mainly formal and focused on aesthetic aspects such as composition and color (often at the expense of the subject matter) to an iconological analysis and, more recently, to a more interdisciplinary approach. This interdisciplinary approach includes, besides iconology, the study of language, ethnographic fieldwork to gather data about cultural continuity and oral traditions, socio-geographic studies, and the study of published sources and unpublished archival documents. These disciplines combine to gain a better understanding of the cultural and historical contexts out of which a pictorial emerged. In this book, I follow this interdisciplinary approach. In addition, I deal with the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan as a narrative and analyze it accordingly. In brief, “iconology” is the theory of images, or the study and psychology of icons (Mitchell 1986:3). Iconology focuses on the interpretation of the content and the philosophy or theology of a work of art instead of only describing it (Burke 2001:35). In the 1930s, “the iconological method” was formulated and presented by Erwin Panofsky (and by Aby Warburg). Panofsky defined iconology as “that branch of the history of art which concerns itself with the subject matter or meaning of works of art, as opposed to their form” (Panofsky 1972:3).4 The iconological method distinguishes three levels of interpretation, corresponding to three levels of meaning in a work of art. The first level concerns the description of the pictorial elements. Panofsky called this the pre-iconographical description. In this level, one focuses on the “natural meaning” of the work, consisting of the objects (e.g., persons, animals, trees) and events (such as battles, alliances, and travel) depicted. The second level involves the identification 22\n\nTheory and Methodology\n\nof the scenes (the iconological analysis in the strict sense). In this level, events are placed in their historical context. A person is identified by name, for example; a battle by participants, place, and date, and so on. The third level involves the identification of the purpose and meaning of the work (iconological interpretation). This level is concerned with what Panofsky called the “intrinsic meaning or content” of the story, to be understood by “those underlying principles which reveal the basic attitude of a nation, a period, a class, a religious or philosophical persuasion” (Panofsky 1939:7).5 With this, Panofsky applied to images the three literary levels distinguished in the early nineteenth century by Friedrich Ast for the interpretation of alphabetical texts: the literal or grammatical level, the historical level (concerned with meaning), and the cultural level (concerned with grasping the “spirit,” or Geist, of the period in which a source was created) (Burke 2001:36). Two large flaws in Panofsky’s iconological method, however, are the lack of a social dimension and the fact that the dynamic character of a tradition and individuality within that tradition are largely neglected. Panofsky included historical context in his method, stating that insight into historical processes is of crucial importance. However, he was indifferent to social context. He acknowledged the influence of the reader’s subjective knowledge and concerns on his or her identifications and interpretations, but only in a general way: that is, without delving into how each reader’s social situation influenced the way that reader’s subjective reading would be formed. In other words, the original iconological method fails to consider that the artist, the person who commissioned the work, and its different readers may all have viewed the same work in different ways and given it different meanings based on their individual social situations. The iconological method provides a useful basis to work from, but one needs to go beyond it (see also Burke 2001:34–45). Two interdisciplinary approaches that fill in some of iconology’s gaps are semiotics (the theory of signs, sign use, and sign systems)6 and narratology (the theory of narrative).7 While semiotics is useful for a better understanding of the medium (the signs and their combinations: in this case Nahua pictography), narratology focuses on the relevance of narrative structure to the meaning of a text (a text defined here as a finite, structured whole composed of signs).8 The combination of these two disciplines (“semiotic narratology”) and their use for visual art other than Mesoamerican pictorials have been expounded and applied in the works of Mieke Bal (1994, 1997) and Frans-Willem Korsten (1998). In brief, one could say that semiotic narratology approaches texts (including visual art) in terms of an “encounter” between “who perceives” and “what is perceived.” It fills in the social context lacking in the iconological method by looking not only at the historical context in which a document was created, read, and interpreted but also at the social context and dynamics of the worlds (culture) of the artists and of the readers-beholders and by considering the subjective nature 23\n\nTheory and Methodology\n\nof the activities of reading and interpreting. A text is never created or perceived in isolation. It is always made within a certain context, for a certain purpose, and with a desired effect. The creators of the Nahua pictorials, too, wanted to make something clear to their readers-beholders. They wanted to convey a message and create an emotion that would support their case. Likewise, each text is perceived within a certain context, and a reader is always influenced by his or her personal history, culture, and concerns. In my analysis of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, I have applied several tools that pertain to semiotic narratology. Narratology makes, for example, a basic division into three layers: (1) the text (a finite, structured whole composed in a sign system; in our case narrative pictography), (2) the story (the presentation of a fabula in a certain manner),9 and (3) the fabula (a series of logically and chronologically related events caused or experienced by actors, or the basic story material) (Bal 1997:6; Prince 1997).10 Although these divisions are purely theoretical suppositions (since, after all, one has access only to the text), they are helpful in reaching better insight into the structure of a (visual) text and its rhetoric (i.e., the actual methods by which the composers of a text created an intended effect). This distinction is analogous to the way most historians approach texts, by comparing and combining sources to find a story that comes closest to the events experienced by the various actors. I examined the story presented in the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan by considering the four basic elements of a narrative—events, actors, time, and place—and analyzing the arrangement of these elements. This approach is also borrowed from narratology and involves an analysis of several factors: 1. The choice of the sequence in which the events are presented, and the difference of this sequence from the chronological sequence in which they are experienced by the actors in question (i.e., the distinction between the story and the presumed fabula). 2. The amount and kind of attention given to the individual scenes and actors, and their chronological place within the story. This indicates the importance of a specific scene, actor, or place to the story. 3. The distinct traits given to the actors; in other words, how they are individualized and transformed into characters. 4. The characteristics of the locations where events occur, or how space is transformed into specific places. 5. How, in addition to the necessary relationships among the elements, other relationships (e.g., symbolic, allusive, traditional) may have been presented. 6. The choice of the point of view from which the elements are presented (“focalization”) (Bal 1997:7–8, 142–160).11\n\n24\n\nTheory and Methodology\n\nAll these factors determine how a fabula is transformed into a story. They are rhetorical tools that make the story specific, distinct from others, with its own unique effect—whether convincing, moving, disgusting, or aesthetic—and its own meaning.12 The analysis of these elements is important to understand the “creative moment” of a story, that is, the phase beyond the text that provokes emotions. A reader’s or beholder’s emotions are affected not only by the contents of a story but also by the medium through which a story is presented (the sign system).13 This is where semiotics comes in. Semiotics studies culture as processes of communication that are possible thanks to the system of signs that underlies them (see also Saussure 1983). Visual images are also considered signs in semiotics. In brief, semiotics addresses questions such as, What types of signs are involved? How are they combined? How do they function? And what is their effect on the beholder? Images like those used in the Nahua pictographic script (see Chapter 1) have characteristics different from those of alphabetic words and thus create different effects and responses. Generally, images are less arbitrary than alphabetic words. That is, whereas the relationship between an alphabetic word and what it signifies is determined by a convention adopted by its users, images require at least some sort of visual connection with the object they represent (Stumpel 1993:105–106). Also, images can represent complete stories and have a magnetic power to attract other ideas to their sphere, whereas alphabetic words are often, although not always, more fixed in the message they communicate (see also Freedberg 1989:1–26; Gombrich 1977:3–25). These differences between images and alphabetic words are especially applicable if words are as widely used as they are in many modern societies. Mitchell even stated, “Images are not just a particular kind of sign, but something like an actor on the historical stage, a presence or character endowed with legendary status, a history that parallels and participates in the stories we tell ourselves about our own evolution from creatures ‘made in the image’ of a creator, to creatures who make themselves and their world in their own image” (Mitchell 1986:9). The layout of the signs and the physical medium of communication also contribute to the effect of a text. Alphabetic texts are normally ordered according to certain principles to, among other things, achieve legibility, keep the reader’s attention, and convey that the text is reliable. Similar principles seem to be present in Nahua pictorials, in the form of agreed-upon formats or layouts on both the scene and document levels (see Chapters 7, 8, and 9). Also, Nahua pictorials were often accompanied by oral recitals that explained the pictography (see Chapter 1). The impact (or what Walter Ong called the “magical potency”) of the spoken word is not to be underestimated. Oral expressions provide information (such as gestures, facial expressions, the presence of witnesses) that has no obvious equivalent in words put down in alphabetic writing (Goody 25\n\nTheory and Methodology\n\n1977:13; Ong 1982:32). The spoken word is an event. While written words or painted images alone would isolate, an accompanying spoken text unites (Ong 1982:74). The combination of a large painting and an oral performance is a very powerful medium of communication. The choice of this medium is connected to the message the composers wanted to communicate and to the impact they wished to have on their audience. The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan points to a public reading and a function in a community ritual (see Chapters 1 and 8). This choice indicates that the Quauhquecholteca wanted to call attention to their story. As a painting alone, the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is impressive; in combination with an oral recital and presentation during a community ritual, it would no doubt have had even more impact. This effect cannot be reproduced in alphabetic writing read in isolation. It will therefore be lacking in my textual description of the document (Chapter 7). When a text is perceived, each reader or beholder emphasizes different elements of the story and identifies with them in his or her own unique way. A reader will always emphasize what he or she can relate to most and will sympathize with or dislike various aspects according to his or her own norms, values, and worldview. A reader’s interpretation of a text also depends on his or her sensitivity to a medium. European viewers, for example, are trained to look from left to right and thus tend to sweep their eyes in the same direction, and in a painting they tend to focus on the central image. This order is logical to them. Those trained in another tradition, however, may find certain elements more or less immediately appealing. This can result in a different effect on different beholders of one and the same image (see Bal 1994:14, 19, 1997:11).14 In sum, communication (or “encounter”) between the worlds of the creators and those of the readers-beholders of a text is a complex process in which a combination of rules is at work of which the participants are partly aware and partly unaware. Creators and beholders are both subjective entities in dynamic contexts, and their communication depends on the culture, experiences, concerns, gender, social class, and similar factors of both the creators and the readers-beholders (Bal 1994:11–20, 141; Freedberg 1989:1–26; Gombrich 1977:3–25, 154–169, 246–278). As Max Friedländer wrote, “Art being a thing of the mind, it follows that any scientific study of art will be psychology. It may be other things as well, but psychology it will always be” (Gombrich 1977:3, from Friedländer 1946).\n\nMethodology One of the main methodological problems in the study of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan arises from the considerable distance that divides the creators of the document from present-day readers. The creators are distant not only in 26\n\nTheory and Methodology\n\ntime but also with regard to place, culture, worldview, and similar factors.15 In our normal speech or writing, a (partially) shared context usually throws light on the meaning of our words (although, as anyone can testify from personal experience, even when the entire context is at hand, the same story can still be given different meanings by different parties depending on such factors as their relationship to the speaker, their gender, social status, and personal concerns). Obviously, when studying a sixteenth-century Mexican pictorial, most of this general context is no longer in existence and can be only partly recovered. To recognize references to historical incidents, to interpret the message, and to understand the symbolic meaning of the details, one has to become familiar with the history, experiences, and codes used by the composers, as well as with the historical and social processes at the basis of the creation of the work. The usefulness of a narrative analysis depends on the possibility of identifying these processes. The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is therefore studied through an examination of the social and historical conditions out of which it emerged (contextualization). A further methodological problem is that the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan was originally part of a larger body of information, the remainder of which no longer exists. The Quauhquecholteca pictorial may once have been part of a larger corpus of pictorials, for example, that may have been read together but the rest of which is unknown to us today. Also, the document originally functioned in combination with oral traditions that are now lost. Furthermore, it can be presumed that the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan was once accompanied by a written alphabetic text (if so, this was probably a título, or land claim). Sadly, many of the original contexts in which the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan once functioned are lost. Moreover, at an unknown date, part of the document was cut off. As a consequence, parts of both the physical body and the narrative are missing, and the possibility to ascertain an overview of its total layout is gone. Finally, the document was also physically altered by the addition of alphabetical glosses (see Chapter 4). When working on the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, it turned out to be most effective to proceed pragmatically by seizing bits and pieces of information from many different sources, fields, and approaches. My study was first and foremost led by the character and contents of the document and the availability of contextual sources. I applied an interdisciplinary approach and made use of a combination of the aforementioned theories. Iconology is used for deciphering the pictography and understanding the pictorial language or codes. The structure and rhetoric of the story, in turn, are analyzed using some of the tools offered by semiotic narratology. My research methodology involved these steps: 1. Iconographical analysis. The obvious first step in my research was to identify and interpret the signs used in the document: the pictographs. What do they 27\n\nTheory and Methodology\n\nmean, and how can they be understood? As Panofsky stated, an iconographical analysis “presupposes a familiarity with specific themes and concepts as transmitted through literary sources, whether acquired by purposeful reading or by oral tradition” (Panofsky 1972:11). The interpretation of the pictography is based on recognition, connection, and contextual knowledge. In other words, one needs practical experience—that is, familiarity—with the relevant objects and events (Panofsky 1972:15). Some pictographs require only recognition of the images as objects we have come to know from the world around us (iconicity). Other pictographs, however, require familiarity with agreed conventions that certain images mean certain things (symbolicity).16 A Nahua pictograph for a mountain or a temple, for example, is easy to recognize, even for modern beholders. But what happens if one is confronted with an image of a person who is seated inside a circle and holding a precious box? Only those who shared the composers’ knowledge, assumptions, and habits of seeing would be able to read this image without explanation.17 For modern scholars, it requires a trained eye and an intimate familiarity with the world of the composers to be able to understand it (see also Eco 1977:200). Any sixteenth-century Mexican viewer, even those unfamiliar with pictography, might have recognized the precious box as one of the boxes used in markets and would probably have been able to interpret the pictograph as standing for a marketplace. A twenty-first-century European viewer, however, is unlikely to make that link without being familiar with either sixteenth-century Nahua pictographic conventions or the daily life of that period. To decipher the pictographic script used in the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, one depends on a convergence of factors. One is familiarity with the language of the composers (in this case Nahuatl). Although most pictographs are arguably independent of a specific language’s representational system (e.g., those for trees, roads, and similar objects), others involve p"
