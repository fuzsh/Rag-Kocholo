My closest collaborator was Professor Ricardo Ambrosio, who nurtured me as his dilla walhall student in Lachirioag. Several extraordinary bene zaa intellectuals supported my endeavors, and chief among them were the late anthropologist Víctor de la Cruz and the late bene wenllin che yia yegu doña Aurelia Cano, and thus this book is dedicated to their memory, and to Professor Ambrosio’s extraordinary work in Lachirioag. Other bene zaa scholars whose support was invaluable include the ritual specialists don Moisés González and doña Aurora Ramírez; the community leader Odilia Romero; the writer Javier Castellanos; the poet Pergentino Cruz; the educator Filemón Beltrán; and the late linguist Emiliano Cruz Santiago. The late eminent linguist Thomas Smith-Stark graciously provided advice and guidance for many years. Javier Urcid amicably nourished this project and provided valuable illustrations. John Justeson was a selfless and erudite collaborator; Susan Schroeder contributed unwavering support; Alfredo López Austin provided timely advice; and María de los Ángeles Romero Frizzi, Manuel Esparza, and Juana Vásquez Vásquez shared their extensive knowledge. I am also grateful for the hospitable reception at Betaza, San Francisco Caxonos, Lachirioag, Solaga, Yaa, Yalahui, Yalalag, Yatee, and Zoogocho.\n\nI am greatly indebted to Kevin Terraciano and Lisa Sousa for their encouragement and invitations to present my work; to the late Ana Díaz Álvarez, for her unfailingly brilliant perspectives on codices; to Bill Taylor, for his steadfast support; to John Chuchiak, for various research suggestions; and to Marina Garone and Erika Loic, for their assistance regarding early modern hands and print types. I warmly thank Michael Galant for his comments on chapter 3; Daniel Suslak, for his help with chapter 6; Viola König, for providing a photograph of the Lienzo de San Juan Comaltepec; and an anonymous reviewer, for making sagacious suggestions.\n\nI am also grateful to Solange Alberro, Davíd Carrasco, Roger Chartier, the late Paul Friedrich, the late Miguel León-Portilla, Rosemary Joyce, the late Marshall Sahlins, and Carlo Severi for their amiable advice. Joe Campbell, Brook Lillehaugen, and Pam Munro made several useful suggestions regarding linguistic analyses; Andrew Laird contributed information about Latin grammars; and Javier Rendón Sandoval and Eduardo Ruiz-Sánchez provided advice on plant morphology, and photographs. I also received helpful feedback from Víctor Cata, John K. Chance, Oswaldo Chinchilla, Bill Connell, Danièle Dehouve, Bas van Doesburg, Jonathan Truitt, Gaby Vail, Joseph Whitecotton, and Judith Zeitlin, and cordial assistance from Luis Arrioja, Margaret Bender, Ned Blackhawk, Aaron Broadwell, Jesús Bustamante, Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra, Francisco José Cervantes, Susan Kellogg, Gerardo Lara Cisneros, Alessandro Lupo, Diana Magaloni, Susan Milbrath, Guilhem Olivier, Ethelia Ruiz Medrano, Carlos Sánchez Silva, Fritz Schwaller, Stuart Schwartz, Marc Sicoli, Aaron Sonnenschein, Michael Swanton, and Daniela Traffano. Before 2016, when I ceased contact with Michel Oudijk due to professional and legal issues, we shared with each other unpublished materials; all insights derived from these exchanges and other publications are acknowledged. Elizabeth Boone, Kris Lane, and Camilla Townsend kindly wrote letters in support of this project. Idelette Domínguez Vásquez and Óscar Falcón Martín retook high-quality photographs of documents, and Ligia Quiroz Bermúdez, Laura Carolina Vásquez, and Teresa Rojas Rabiela helped with some inquiries. I am, of course, responsible for all errors or omissions in this work.\n\nI acknowledge the amiable support of Antonio Sánchez de Mora and his colleagues at the Archivo General de Indias; Israel Garrido at the Archivo Histórico del Poder Judicial de Oaxaca; Father Antonio Villalobos at the Archivo Parroquial de Villa Alta; Norman Fiering and Neil Safier at the John Carter Brown Library; John O’Neill at the Hispanic Society of America; Regina Tapia Chávez, director of the Archivo General Agrario; and the personnel at Archivo Histórico del Arzobispado de Oaxaca, Archivo General de la Nación, Archivo Parroquial de La Merced in Oaxaca, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Museo Nacional de Antropología, and the Newberry Library.\n\nMy research and writing was funded by a 2017–2018 award from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation; a National Endowment for the Humanities grant held at the John Carter Brown Library; and by assistance from the Lucy Maynard Salmon Fund and the Elinor Nims Brink Fund at Vassar College, which also covered indexing and permission costs.\n\nSeveral esteemed colleagues hosted presentations of work in progress: Louise Burkhart, University at Albany; Sergio Navarrete and Manuel Ríos Morales, CIESAS-Pacífico Sur; Gunlög Fur, Linnaeus University; Frank Salomon, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Maarten Jansen, Leiden University; Kelly McDonough, University of Texas, Austin; and Kittiya Lee, California State University, Los Angeles. Earlier work on the project was presented at various meetings of the American Historical Association; chapters 3 and 5 were presented at the 2007 and 2011 American Society for Ethno history meetings; and chapter 2 was delivered at the 2018 Northeastern Nahua Scholars Conference. Early versions of my analysis of Borgia group codices and Zapotec manuals in chapters 4 and 5 were presented at a 2014 conference and a 2015 seminar generously organized at the Instituto de Investigaciones Históricas at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México by Federico Navarrete and Ana Díaz, and at a 2018 seminar graciously hosted by Davide Domenici at the University of Bologna. Chapter 6 was presented at the Los Angeles Frente Indígena de Organizaciones de Base in 2017, and at the 2019 meetings of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association, and the American Anthropological Association. I express my gratitude to the organizers of these events, to their students, and to audience members for their feedback.\n\nAt Vassar, I received congenial support from my Anthropology Department and Latin American and Latinx Studies Program colleagues, and from my research assistants Elise Stickles, the late Ariana Salguero, and Ariana Sierra-Chacón. I thank Neil Curri for drafting the Villa Alta map, and Nicole Scalessa and Baynard Bailey for their devoted work on a companion web site. At the University of Texas Press, my editor, Kerry Webb, and Andrew Hnatow gently steered the journey from proposal to publication, and Lynne Ferguson and Kerri Sullivan made judicious edits.\n\nAt home, my work was sustained daily in myriad ways by the love of my wife, Elisabeth; my daughter, Eva; my parents, David and Estela; and my brother, Arturo, and his family: Chizuru, Erika, Vero, Irving, and David Aleksei.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nIntroduction\n\nEARLY ON SEPTEMBER 17, 1718, Sebastián de Aziburu Arichaga, alcalde mayor, or governor, of the Villa Alta province in Oaxaca, New Spain, was notified that the people of Lachitaa (see map) had relapsed into ancient devotions and were preparing tepache, fruit alcohol, for a feast,¹ even though, only fourteen years earlier, fray Ángel Maldonado, bishop of Oaxaca, had gathered Zapotec calendrical manuals and songs, along with collective confessions, from the 104 Indigenous towns in Villa Alta in exchange for a general amnesty from the crime of idolatry—understood in Zapotec through the thunderous neologism the Dominican Pedro de Feria coined in his 1567 Doctrina, quela huecete bitoo quiela yagala, the teachings of stone and wood deities.² This volume provides the first analysis of the entire contents of this exceptional collection of manuals and songbooks, which were surrendered to Maldonado by thirty-seven Northern Zapotec communities in 1704 and 1705, forwarded to Spain, and eventually preserved at the Archivo General de Indias (AGI) as legajo, or archival unit, México 882.\n\nThe means by which this news had reached the magistrate revealed a profound rift in Northern Zapotec communities—highly autonomous territorial, residential, and religious units known as queche, yeche, and yetze. The celebrations at Lachitaa were anything but mystical. They entailed obligations that divided Zapotecs along gender and political lines, mobilized their households, and affected their domestic budgets—a local politics of universal realms. In cosmological terms, September 17, 1718, was lala, 11-Night, or Day 63 in the biyee, the 260-day divinatory count that had been consulted by ritual specialists for the previous 2,300 years.³ September 17 was also the eleventh day of the eleventh period in the yza, the pre-Columbian Zapotec 365-day year. This eleventh period, called Gaha (Fruit), matched the feast of Xocotlhuetzi (Fruit Falls) in the Nahua year. 11-Night was an auspicious date in the divinatory cycle, as several Zapotec daykeepers designated it as a feast when saa titza tzahui, the good words go.⁴ Moreover, this celebration was only two days from the end of the first of four 65-day periods (cocijo or cocii) in the 260-feast count. Mesoamerican communities had similarly structured versions of that count before the Spanish conquest, but its quotidian use had vanished or been curtailed throughout Central Mexico by the late seventeenth century.\n\nLachitaa officials were charged with collecting contributions from each household, in order to acquire turkeys, costly quetzal feathers from Chiapas, and other items necessary for a collective feast. Around September 3, Mariana Martín, a fifty-two-year-old woman, refused to contribute the three reales that town leaders required of every adult town resident. Her husband, Simón de Santiago, grew angry and beat her, and the fiscal (minor official), Juan de Santiago, advised Simón to kill Mariana, so she would not divulge their plans to Spanish authorities. Mariana fled to San Ildefonso, Villa Alta’s seat of governance, and revealed the events at Lachitaa to her son-in-law, Juan Sánchez, then in prison, who notified the authorities. Besides Mariana and Juan, Catharina María, a twenty-five-year-old woman, also contended she and her husband refused to contribute money toward those celebrations. But when Juan Martínez de Escapa, Villa Alta’s alguacil mayor (chief constable), arrived in Lachitaa a day later, most adults had fled town, except for Melchora Martín, a widow whose house was being used by Zapotec authorities to store the festivity’s implements: seats for the celebrants, eight vats of tepache, a two-tone drum known as nicachi in Zapotec and teponaztli in Nahuatl, turkey and deer bones to be used as drumsticks, a round box made of horn, and twenty-nine perforated stones wrapped in tree bark. Melchora had also made maize tamales with amaranth seeds.⁵\n\nThe rift that separated Mariana and Catharina from their officials was not merely based on gender or political divisions; it also involved cosmological knowledge. Mariana testified that, on an early morning in May 1718—a month in which another sixty-five-day period ended, on May 12 (13-Field, quecina)—she had seen the adult men of Lachitaa gather at a plantain field downhill from the town. Before the assembly, Gaspar Baptista began to play the nicachi drum, while Fabián Luis accompanied him on a turtle shell.⁶ These two men came from Betaza, a town a few miles north with close ties with Lachitaa, and were known for their prowess as ritual singers. According to witnesses in an idolatry trial held fourteen years earlier, both men had been trained by the maestro de idolatrías, teacher of idolatries, Nicolás de Selis, in exchange for a payment of twenty-five pesos from a confraternity devoted to the Virgin of the Rosary.⁷ From her house, high above the plantain field, all Mariana could hear was that they were singing in the ancient fashion. She believed she heard the phrase se queman las estrellas, the stars are burning, and specified that it was sung not in Northern but in Valley Zapotec.\n\nMariana’s reference to burning suggests a ritual song that began, indeed, with quichohuici y.ba y.nesa, \"the gratitude will be charred⁸ right away,\" and which referred to a food offering for sacred beings (see the appendix for a translation of these songs). This composition opened a lengthy song cycle that had been transcribed by Pedro de Vargas of Betaza, given to Fernando de Lopes of Lachirioag, and eventually surrendered to Bishop Maldonado, who submitted it to the Council of the Indies as proof that the Dominicans’ evangelization efforts had been less than diligent.⁹\n\nAccording to Mariana, the arcane words in those songs resembled a variant not spoken in the Sierra, Colonial Valley Zapotec (CVZ). She was right: as the appendix demonstrates, cognates for specialized terms in these songs appear in Vocabulario en lengua Çapoteca (1578), the most authoritative Colonial Valley Zapotec dictionary, compiled by the Dominican lexicographer Juan de Córdova, also author of a grammar, Arte en lengua zapoteca (1578).¹⁰ As shown by Thomas Smith-Stark in 2007, four branches of Zapotec, including Central (Valley) and Northern, split from the same ancestor language. Hence, in colonial times, Northern and Valley Zapotec were mutually intelligible, but only to a degree.\n\nBesides political, cosmological, and linguistic differences, there was another divide between town residents and ritual specialists: literacy. In the second half of the seventeenth century, while a few Northern Zapotec escribanos, notaries, had been idolaters, many ritual specialists were literate, and composed texts in various genres in their communities. The manuals and songs that will be analyzed here were produced or owned by about 120 ritual specialists (see table 3.4). During the second half of the seventeenth century, these writers and readers had developed an autonomous republic of letters that, while deeply entrenched in an ancestral understanding of the universe and the interests of sixty Zapotec communities, also had substantial intellectual links with literacy practices, legal discourses, and astronomical knowledge that spanned the Spanish Atlantic world.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE CORPUS\n\nAs the largest archive of Native calendrical and cosmological texts in the colonial Americas, the Villa Alta corpus—composed by Indigenous intellectuals for Indigenous readers and preserved as a result of their confiscation by Bishop Maldonado—is an extraordinary source for Latin American history, religion, and culture. Its study occupies a place at the confluence of four themes: the entanglements of cultural and political mediation in the Atlantic World, Native colonial identities, the history of colonial religious institutions, and interdisciplinary Mesoamerican studies.\n\nOver the last decade, the study of cultural mediation has come of age to yield more exacting histories of interconnections. After sketching the connected histories of Europe and Asia, Sanjay Subrahmanyam turned to the origins of a global history that showcased links among Asian, Middle Eastern, and European scholars.¹¹ A more deliberate examination of multiple connections and transatlantic information exchanges resulted in important contributions not only to the study of elite scientific milieux in Spanish America, but also to entangled British and Spanish colonial projects, or to our knowledge of healing and medical practices through networks that included enslaved people, and commoners of African, Indigenous, and mixed descent.¹²\n\nConnected histories are not novel in colonial Mexico, as entangled intellectual histories have showcased the achievements of colonial Indigenous scholars since Carlos María Bustamante, following Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora and Lorenzo Boturini, began championing the work of Nahua historian Chimalpahin shortly after the War of Independence. As is well known, Native scholars educated in the liberal arts at the Franciscan Colegio de Santa Cruz assisted missionaries with translation, evangelization, and lexicographic enterprises from 1536 onward, and Nahua Latinists such as Pablo Nazareo and the scholar-politician of plebeian origin Antonio Valeriano eloquently argued for the preservation of their privileges.¹³ In the seventeenth century, Native or mestizo historians such as Chimalpahin, Tezozomoc, Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl, and Juan Buenaventura Zapata y Mendoza, along with anonymous Zapotec and Nahua authors of origin narratives known as títulos primordiales (primordial records), recast oral histories, pictographic accounts, and earlier alphabetic texts into elite histories and genealogical narratives. In doing so, Indigenous historical narratives tied to specific polities expanded their footing in the colonial order.¹⁴ Some authors, like Chimalpahin and Alva Ixtlilxochitl, linked local histories to universal discourses about European history and classical antiquity. From the late seventeenth century onward, Creole and European intellectuals such as Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora, Lorenzo Boturini, and Antonio de León y Gama shaped how these histories would be remembered and archived. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, both notables of Native origin and ascendant Creoles publicly, and expediently, embraced symbols of Native identity.\n\nAt the heart of these connected histories stands a grave discordance: there was an emphasis on the narratives, genealogies, and works of Indigenous nobility and elites, who often were attuned to European knowledge, or educated by missionaries or clerics, or participants in urban social networks. Nevertheless, many other Indigenous elites and commoners did not align with colonial authorities, or had fewer occasions to engage them in ways easily traceable in ecclesiastic or civil archives.\n\nTwo distinct but related approaches—the ascendancy of the New Philology and the systematic study of catechetical texts—have provided a measure of balance and also undergirded efforts to analyze the workings of colonial communities through the study of routine records in Mesoamerican languages, such as wills, petitions, tributary rolls, and letters.¹⁵ These approaches fostered an expansion of Ángel Rama’s famed trope about the Latin American lettered city. There is ample evidence not only for a flourishing of genres in Mesoamerican languages in regional and local settings, sometimes with relative autonomy from colonial notarial and legal practice, but also for literacy networks beyond urban settlements in the Andes.¹⁶ The study of these sophisticated literacy spheres and networks challenges a received historiography regarding a republic of letters that leads, inevitably, to a public sphere in the Enlightenment, as posited by Jürgen Habermas.¹⁷\n\nGiven the early adoption of alphabetic literacy in Central Mexico, and the readiness with which Indigenous claimants embraced litigation in civil courts from the mid-sixteenth century onward, it comes as no surprise that these subjects were capable of negotiating and partially transforming the frameworks through which their claims were adjudicated.¹⁸\n\nTo understand the society that produced the sacred texts that are the subject of this book, however, one must engage in what Bernard Cohn memorably called proctological history: a history from the bottom up that not only examines the agency and strategies of subaltern groups but also analyzes how various actors aligned with or dissented from collective action.¹⁹ Unlike other texts that circulated across Indigenous republics of letters in New Spain, these clandestine manuals and songs could not position memories within a public legal framework. Thus, their authors made no concessions, and did not engage readers outside a Northern Zapotec social and intellectual sphere. Theirs was a variant form of colonial subjecthood that coexisted with more orthodox strategies for preserving elite privilege and seeking alliances with other elites or with civil authorities.\n\nThis history from below must also engage Native subjects who exercised little agency regarding the documents and archives that recorded their beliefs and lived experience. Alongside historical scholarship that has continued to build upon foundational studies about the Mexican Inquisition, ecclesiastical tribunals, and popular religious practices,²⁰ other studies influenced by the New Philology in the last decade have turned to the study of trial records generated by ecclesiastic tribunals and inquisitorial judges in New Spain. These recent works depart from earlier studies in terms of scope, but also in terms of extending their analyses to previously unknown or poorly studied sources. Some scholars examined inquisitorial politics, juridical procedure, and jurisdictional conflicts, and others attempted surveys that trace institutional policies, both for ecclesiastic tribunals and for civil judges who intervened in cases of Native idolatry, sorcery, and superstition.²¹\n\nAmong the vast number of colonial documents in Mesoamerican languages produced by Indigenous writers, a subset of works stands out because they preserve, in impressive detail, collective memories about pre-Columbian cosmological beliefs, sacred narratives, rhetorical performance, and a complex narrative of origins, migrations, and foundations. Many of these works were part of a protracted conversation between Native and European authors. The Cantares Mexicanos, although transcribed by Christianized Nahuas, feature traditional rhetorical forms, and commemorate preconquest feats. The Popol Vuh collected unique narratives regarding the origins and history of K’iche’ Maya polities.²² An important set of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century records preserved the political history of Kaqchikel Maya communities.²³ At a remove, mediated by Franciscans, Book 6 of the Florentine Codex preserved songs devoted to Central Mexican deities, and a manuscript by Hernando Ruiz de Alarcón records in superb detail Nahua prayers.²⁴\n\nOn the other hand, while parts of the Northern Zapotec corpus align with some genres outlined above—like the songs in Cantares Mexicanos—they were part of a social world in which texts, such as colonial K’iche’ and Kaqchikel daykeeping manuals, circulated clandestinely. Similar works included the Yucatec Maya Books of the Chilam Balam, which contained prophecies and arcane narratives, the Cantares de Dzitbalché, which propitiated Maya deities, and the Ritual of the Bacabo’ob, which recorded hybrid healing practices, among other genres.²⁵\n\nEntangled histories produce entangled objects. The Zapotec manuals were shaped by colonial literacy and writing practices and corralled in a subterranean sphere through punishment. But they also reflect an astoundingly rich religious tradition that may be seen as an equivalent of Mediterranean antiquity, in terms of the depth of its historiography and the dependence on linguistic analyses and interdisciplinary methodologies to plumb its contents. This interdisciplinary endeavor calls for the integration of historical, linguistic, philological, and archaeological data. The corpus of Postclassic codices and material culture has stimulated the production of exegeses of particular codices, synthetic works, and research on colors and manufacture.²⁶ Several lines of inquiry have questioned received interpretations regarding the representation of Mesoamerican deities, astronomical observations, and correlations between Indigenous and European calendars.²⁷ Such approaches benefit from a broader discussion within archaeology that focuses on Native ontologies, and religious practices interpreted through material traces.²⁸\n\nThe Northern Zapotec corpus allows for a deep inquiry about Mesoamerican theories about the structure of cosmos and time. Its emphasis on the worship of founding ancestors allows for comparisons with Zapotec writing and pictorial and archaeological data from Classic (250–900 CE) and Postclassic (900–1519 CE) stone carvings, effigy vessels, and tombs in central Oaxaca.²⁹ As chapters 4 through 6 of this book demonstrate, there are clear convergences in terms of cycles and protocols between the manuals and four Central Mexican codices that belong to the Borgia group: the Borgia, the Cospi, the Fejérváry Mayer, and the Vaticanus B. At the same time, the Zapotec books articulate a theory regarding the interdigitation of time—the 260 feasts—and space—the geography of the cosmos—a unique tradition that differs from diagrams in other Central Mexican codices.\n\nZapotec social and cultural history, enmeshed within Atlantic history, is another major focus of this work. Through the pioneering work of Joseph Whitecotton and María de los Ángeles Romero Frizzi, the study of Post classic and early colonial Zapotec elites acquired new paradigms and emphasized a variety of sources.³⁰ Marcello Carmagnani noted that, after population recovery in Northern Oaxaca and the Isthmus, Native authorities engineered the return of ancient deities, and confronted alcaldes mayores. This work was followed by John K. Chance’s masterful analysis of the political and demographic history of Villa Alta and Judith Zeitlin’s critical assessment of the 1660 Tehuantepec rebellion.³¹ The exemplary work of Thomas Smith-Stark on the two most important lexicographic sources for Colonial Valley Zapotec—Juan de Córdova’s 1578 dictionary and grammar—illuminated cosmology and catechesis for historians, and other linguists have continued to investigate colonial Valley Zapotec sources.³²\n\nIn the last two decades, the translation, study, and comparative analysis of sources in colonial Zapotec variants gained greater importance through the work of scholars who explored important archival depositories in Mexico and Spain³³ and analyzed Zapotec catechetical imprints and manuscripts.³⁴ Other works have focused primarily on Spanish-language civil and ecclesiastical records from Villa Alta, and documented Zapotec social and political history.³⁵ Several digital humanities sites offer valuable resources, including online dictionaries³⁶ and transcriptions and translations of colonial Zapotec texts.³⁷\n\nNorthern Zapotec ethnolinguistic and territorial divisions in the alcaldía mayor of Villa Alta, Oaxaca.

After the execution of fifteen rebels as punishment for a violent 1700 rebellion in San Francisco Caxonos, the newly arrived Bishop Maldonado visited the northern sierras, beginning in 1702, and issued a general amnesty for crimes of idolatry, in exchange for full collective confessions. From September 1704 to January 1705, the authorities of pueblos de indios, Indigenous communities, in Villa Alta went to the jurisdictional seat of San Ildefonso to register their confessions regarding ceremonies both de particulares, private, and del común, collective, that focused on deities and ancestors (see map). In the end, sixty-eight Zapotec communities—fifteen Bixanos, twenty-seven Caxonos, twenty-six Nexitzo—as well as twenty-nine Ayuuk (Mixe) and seven Tsa Jujmi-speaking (Chinantec) towns, deposited brief confessions, denounced their specialists, and turned in calendrical manuals or ritual implements (see table 3.4).³⁹\n\nThis exercise was substantially different from other ambitious inquisitorial campaigns against heretics and sorcerers, such as Jacques Fournier’s inquiries in Montaillou, and Juan de Zumárraga’s investigations of Basque witches and, later, Nahua idolaters.⁴⁰ Rather than conducting personal interrogations, Bishop Maldonado delegated his powers to his visitador general (visitor general), the renowned extirpator of idolatries Joseph de Aragón y Alcántara, and to a Dominican commissioned judge, Diego de Cardona, while Zapotec testimony was translated by the mestizo interpreter Joseph de Ramos.\n\nThese efforts constitute the most ambitious idolatry extirpation attempt carried out in New Spain, as they mobilized the elected authorities of about 104 recognized Indigenous communities, which comprised 421 settlements with an estimated total population of 36,396.⁴¹ Its scale was unusual not only in terms of its target demographic, but also due to the large corpus it amassed: 102 calendar manuals from thirty-seven communities, composed in the second half of the seventeenth century. Four collections of ritual songs were also turned in, two devoted to deities and founding ancestors, while the other two celebrated Christian entities.⁴² The 102 manuals contain partial or full lists of the 260-day Zapotec ritual calendar, and contemporary archivists grouped them into ninety-nine cuadernos (booklets). The corpus contains ninety-two complete lists of the 260-feast cycle, seven calendars with at least 75 percent of the 260-day cycle, two calendar fragments, and two calendars with nonstandard day orders. This is a unique corpus for the colonial Americas, in terms of its unparalleled contents and the number of texts confiscated. While most ecclesiastical judges would burn effigies and ritual implements in a public disciplinary act, these divinatory texts were spared that fate, as Maldonado employed them as evidence of the uneven results obtained by Dominicans after almost 170 years of residence in Oaxaca.\n\nUnlike many other Mesoamerican sources, the historiography of the Villa Alta corpus is of recent vintage. In the early 1960s, the art historian Enrique Marco Dorta alerted the Spanish anthropologist José Alcina Franch about its existence. One of Franch’s students, Cristina Zilbermann, wrote her undergraduate thesis on the documents, and Franch and Zilbermann authored the first publications about them in 1966.⁴³ Franch explored the topic in the early 1970s, and in 1993 he authored a monograph that publicized this corpus’s importance, discussed deities and the structure of the 260- and 365-day counts, and provided a synoptic analysis of local ceremonies. Franch analyzed these manuals from the vantage point of Spanish-language documentation, as he did not read Zapotec, and subsequently Arthur Miller addressed this corpus.⁴⁴\n\nI started working on the Villa Alta documents in 1997 as a doctoral student, began studying Songbooks 100–103 (not"
