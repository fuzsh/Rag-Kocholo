Uma Thurman will replace Mary-Louise Parker in the NBC miniseries The Slap, according to TV Line.

The Kill Bill actress has taken over the role as Parker recovers from a recent bout of pneumonia.

Based on the novel of the same name by Christos Tsiolkas, The Slap is a remake of the 2011 Australian series.

It examines the repercussions for a group of friends after one person slaps another's child at a barbecue.

Melissa George, Thandie Newton, Peter Sarsgaard and Zachary Quinto will also star in the drama series.

The Slap will air on NBC next year.
