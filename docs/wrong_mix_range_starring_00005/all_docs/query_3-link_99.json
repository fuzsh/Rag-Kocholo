        "text": "Katy Perry and Zooey Deschanel\n\nKaty Perry and Zooey Deschanel’s twinning history goes back a long way. When Perry relocated to Los Angeles in the early 2000s, Deschanel's fame was on the rise. The aspiring star was frequently broke and pretended to be Deschanel to enter clubs. All the while, people kept telling Deschanel about this girl named Katy who looked exactly like her. When the two finally met, the \"New Girl\" star said she was relieved because Perry was so attractive.\n\nThey capitalized on their doppelganger status in Tyler Perry’s fun music video \"Not the End of the World\" (2020), where aliens abduct Deschanel, mistaking her for Perry. She plays along to save the world.\n\nEmma Watson and Kiernan Shipka\n\n\"Harry Potter\" and \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\" fans, unite! The witching hour is upon us in earnest because two of our favorite spellcasters could be long-lost cousins.\n\nKiernan Shipka plays Sabrina, and fans also know her as Sally Draper in \"Mad Men.\" Almost everyone knows Emma Watson from the Harry Potter films as the precocious Hermione Granger. The comparisons came flooding in after the release of \"The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.\" The actors do look a lot alike, especially when Shipka sports darker hair.\n\nMario and Chris Rock\n\nAlthough Mario makes singing and performing look effortless, it’s not always easy being him. The singer best known for \"Let Me Love You\" is often mistaken for actor and comedian Chris Rock.\n\nFurthermore, he is over 20 years younger, leading us to believe that maybe Rock has stopped aging! The comedian has looked the same ever since Eddie Murphy discovered him decades ago. Forget related, these two could be identical twins!\n\nJames Franco and Theo James\n\nThe two actors could be the same person. They already share similar names so there’s that, and you wouldn’t be the first one to confuse the two.\n\nThe star of “Divergent” (2014) has revealed that fans, other celebs, and the press have misidentified him as Franco numerous times. It’s not hard to see why. James (Theo) has the same chiseled good looks as the “Freaks and Geeks” actor.\n\nBryce Dallas Howard and Jessica Chastain\n\nIt’s hard to believe, but Jessica Chastain and Brice Dallas Howard are not the same person. Chastain even posted a hilarious video on TikTok to set the record straight. The two look so alike that Howard’s father couldn’t tell them apart once! He mistook Chastain for his daughter while shopping.\n\nThe only way to tell them apart is through their respective bodies of work. Chastain is known for her stellar performances in \"Interstellar\" (2014), \"Zero Dark Thirty\" (2012), and \"The Help\" (2011). Howard has appeared in several blockbusters such as \"Terminator Salvation\" (2009), the Jurassic Park film series, and \"Spider-Man 3\" (2007). Chastain and Howard met for the first time as co-stars on \"The Help.\"\n\nBrigitte Bardot and Claudia Schiffer\n\nBesides being an international sensual symbol during the 1960s and 1970s, Brigitte Bardot was famous for portraying emancipated women on screen. Bardot became the standard for aspiring stars to live up to. Several Brigitte Bardot doppelgangers have come and gone, but none have come as close as former supermodel Claudia Schiffer.\n\nSchiffer was dubbed \"a young Bardot\" after a sensational Guess ad that featured her in a bikini. She looked remarkably like Bardot in \"The Girl in the Bikini\" (1952).\n\nLily Collins and Audrey Hepburn\n\nAudrey Hepburn represents everything we love about Hollywood’s Golden Age: grace, sophistication, and other-worldliness. She raised the bar in cinema and is still regarded as one of the world’s most fashionable icons. Can anyone else compare? Probably not, but Lily Collins, the star of Netflix’s \"Emily in Paris\" (2020) has long been touted as an Audrey Hepburn lookalike.\n\nFans have often wondered whether the two are related by blood, such is the resemblance. They’re not. Still, the two stars look like twins. Collins, who is usually dressed for events in vintage glam, has started to look more like Hepburn with every passing day.\n\nMatt Bomer and Henry Cavill\n\nFans have been fixated on the similarities between Matt Bomer and Henry Cavill for a while now. The actors don’t appear to be related by blood in any way. Remarks about how similar they look began around the time Bomer made his debut in \"American Horror Story\" (2014).\n\nAt the time, Cavill was also enjoying massive success as the new Superman in \"Man of Steel\" (2013). Who can blame anyone for thinking the two are interchangeable? Take a look at the similar bone structure, dimpled chins, and those gorgeous eyes.\n\nNiall Horan and Allen Leech\n\nActor Allen Leech and former 1D singer Niall Horan bear a striking resemblance to each other. When host Andy Cohen spoke to Leech about it during an episode of \"Watch What Happens Live,\" the actor claimed Horan was his son.\n\nWith a straight face, the \"Downton Abbey\" actor said he had him really young and decided to give him up to a boy band instead of a circus. He's also stated that Horan should play a younger Tom Branson in a \"Downton Abbey\" spin-off series.\n\nSusan Sarandon and Sigourney Weaver\n\nFans frequently mistake Susan Sarandon for another Hollywood veteran, Sigourney Weaver — and vice versa. Sarandon joked that she had stopped correcting people and had decided to take credit for some of Weavers' work, such as the popular sci-fi franchise \"Aliens\" (1986).\n\nWeaver had similar plans and has often signed autographs as Sarandon—great minds and all that! The two actresses have particularly similar hair and faces. Beyond that, we honestly don’t see it, even if fans routinely confuse one for the other.\n\nJason Sudeikis and Ed Helms\n\nThere’s no denying the striking resemblance between Hangover trilogy star Ed Helms and \"Horrible Bosses\" actor Jason Sudeikis. Fans didn't really recognize the similarities until the two stars appeared together in the film \"Vacation\" (2015).\n\nYou can’t unsee it once you see it. It’s occasionally difficult to distinguish the two on and off screen, not only because they look alike but also because they portray similar characters. Sudeikis said he doesn’t mind the incessant comparisons and has learned to laugh them off.\n\nLake Bell and Lindsey Kraft\n\nThe only difference in these two pictures is the color of the hair and the clothes. Can you tell the two women apart otherwise? We sure can’t. They are virtually interchangeable, with similar eyes, noses, and smiles, along with a cool cat demeanor.\n\nFor anyone who needs a refresher, Lake Bell is a model, actor, and director best known for her role as Dr. Cat Black in \"Children's Hospital\" (2008). Her equally accomplished doppelganger has appeared in \"Grace and Frankie\" (2015), \"Getting On\" (2013), and \"Living Biblically\" (2018).\n\nVictoria Justice and Nina Dobrev\n\nNina Dobrev and Victoria Justice are not related despite their startling likeness. But people have been mistaking the actors for each other since forever! They share a lot more than identical features.\n\nBoth actors had modest beginnings in Hollywood, with Dobrev on \"Degrassi: The Next Generation\" (2001) and Justice on Nickelodeon's \"Zoe 101\" (2005). Since then, they’ve made it big on shows such as \"Vampire Diaries\" (2009) and \"Victorious\" (2010). Dobrev and Justice have also met in person, where all signs point to a blossoming friendship.\n\nGeoffrey Rush and Peter Sellers\n\nBiopics are fantastic, not just for great storytelling but for actors magically transforming into historical figures through intricate hair and makeup. At times, the casting and makeup are so incredible that an actor appears nearly identical to the person they are playing. Case in point: Geoffrey Rush as English actor Peter Sellers in \"The Life and Death of Peter Sellers\" (2004). The transformation is startling because Rush doesn’t look anything like him in real life.\n\nSellers was iconic as Inspector Jacques Cousteau in the Pink Panther films. Rush is a multiple-award-winning actor famous for bringing eccentric characters to life, including Captain Barbossa in \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" (2003).\n\nMissi Pyle and Elaine Hendrix\n\nPeople often mistake Elaine Hendrix and Missi Pyle for each other, and it’s easy to see why. In 2015, Pyle posted photos of herself and Hendrix side by side to clarify that she had never acted in \"The Parent Trap\" (1998).\n\nPyle has appeared in several critically acclaimed movies, such as \"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story\" (2004) and \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (2005), among others. Hendrix is an actor best known for playing Meredith Blake in \"The Parent Trap.\" She also appeared in \"Inspector Gadget 2\" (2003) and a documentary called \"What the Bleep Do We Know?” (2004).\n\nElizabeth Banks and Julie Bowen\n\nWe can't tell Elizabeth Banks and Julie Bowen apart on most days. Both stars have similar features and hair types. The near-identical smiles are also uncanny. They even appeared together on screen, when Banks appeared as the promiscuous Sal on \"Modern Family\".\n\nBanks played her part to perfection as one of Cameron and Mitchell’s close friends, but she could have easily appeared as the long-lost sister Claire never knew she had. Talk about a plot twist.\n\nChris Pine and Joey Lawrence\n\nChris Pine regularly meets people who think he’s someone else. The actor who made waves in \"Star Trek\" (2009) as young Captain James Kirk is often mistaken for other famous Chrises: Hemsworth, Evans, and even Pratt.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", the actor shared how he was confused for ‘80s child star Joey Lawrence and called the moment memorable. Lawrence became a household name for his roles in \"Blossom\" (1990) and \"Melissa & Joey\" (2010). Do the actors look alike? We think they do.\n\nHilary Duff and Victoria Pedretti\n\nHilary Duff and Victoria Pedretti are the latest doppelganger duo to emerge in Hollywood. With her role as the deeply-polarizing Love Quinn in \"You\" season 2 (2019), Pedretti has established herself as a household name. The star has been flooded with comments about how much she resembles \"Lizzie McGuire\" star Hilary Duff ever since.\n\nThe actors aren’t related by blood, but they should be since the resemblance is crazy! Pedretti doesn’t seem to care about comparisons overall. She told a publication that people have been telling her who or what she looks like since she was little and she's always wondered why it was relevant.\n\nMorgan Freeman and Nelson Mandela\n\nHe plays God and villain with equal flair, but Morgan Freeman believes portraying Nelson Mandela has been his biggest acting challenge. He clearly did a brilliant job, because ever since his critically-acclaimed performance in \"Invictus\" (2009), Freeman has routinely been mistaken for the late South African President. Apart from the fact that they look so alike, the biggest testament came from Mandela himself.\n\nThe man who spearheaded the anti-apartheid movement famously stated that he could think of no one else to play him except Freeman. The film chronicles Mandela’s attempt to unify South Africa through sport during the Rugby World Cup in 1995.\n\nReese Witherspoon and Kelsea Ballerini\n\nReese Witherspoon had already been in two films by 1993, the year country music star Kelsea Ballerini was born. The star who gave us the iconic Elle Woods in \"Legally Blonde\" (2001) was steadily on her way to becoming a Hollywood legend. Ballerini released her first album, \"The First Time,\" years later in 2015, and it topped the charts.\n\nRegardless, are we sure the two aren’t related? Face shape? Check. Similar soft smiles? Double check! Same blonde hair? Check! The two stars met during a Christmas tree lighting at the White House and, since then, have become close friends.\n\nJaime Pressly and Margot Robbie\n\nWhen it comes to celebrity lookalikes, few pairs can beat Jaime Pressly and Margot Robbie. We think they should take a DNA test just to be sure. Oscar-nominated Robbie is best known for her roles in \"Suicide Squad\" (2016) and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013).\n\nPressly made waves for her portrayal of Joy Turner in \"My Name Is Earl\" — a role that won her an Emmy and several other nominations. Fans and the media routinely mistake one for the other. Funnily enough, the two actors are over a decade apart in age. They themselves were taken aback by their resemblance when they met in person!\n\nNatalie Portman and Keira Knightley\n\nKeira Knightley and Natalie Portman first met as teen actors in George Lucas’s “ Star Wars” (1999). Rumor has it that even their mothers couldn’t tell the two apart on set! Both actors have had uber-successful Hollywood careers since.\n\nPortman has starred in independent films and blockbusters such as “V for Vendetta” (2005) and “Black Swan” (2010). Knightley is best known for her roles in “Pirates of the Caribbean” (2003) and “Bend It Like Beckham” (2002). People still talk about their time in Star Wars and their uncanny resemblance.\n\nAnna Gunn and Woody Harrelson\n\nSome celebrity pairings you have to see closely to believe, and this one’s the best yet! Ann Gunn rose to prominence as Skyler White in \"Breaking Bad\" (2008), for which she received an Emmy.\n\nWoody Harrelson got his big break playing Woodrow Tiberius Boyd in the sitcom, \"Cheers\" (1982) and has since gained acclaim for various roles, including \"No Country for Old Men\" (2007) and \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\" (1996). We’re not sure how many people will agree, but Anna Gunn and Woody Harrelson are basically the same person! Imagine Harrelson in a wig or Gunn bald, and there’s no way to tell the difference.\n\nEd Skrein and Nicholas Hoult\n\nNicholas Hoult and Ed Skrein belong to different cinematic universes. Skrein is known for his roles as Daario Naharis in “Game of Thrones” (2011) and Ajax in “Deadpool” (2016). Hoult is a British actor who played Hank McCoy (\"Beast\") in the X-Men movies and Nux in “Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).\n\nDespite working on vastly different things, there’s no denying the two actors look identical. The actors share the same mouth shape and pointed ears. They reportedly also share a love for similar films. Hoult and Skrein appeared in the black comedy “Kill Your Friends,” where the director was all praises for both actors.\n\nAubrey Plaza and Olivia Munn\n\nMost people know Aubrey Plaza from \"Parks and Recreation\" (2009) and more recently as Harper in the wildly popular series \"The White Lotus\" (2021 – 2022), When she’s not playing restrained and aloof characters on screen, Plaza gets a tonne of comparisons to \"Newsroom\" actor Olivia Munn.\n\nThe two women are gorgeous and do look a lot like each other, from their dark hair and eyes to their face shapes. Let’s not forget the same 100-watt smiles that could illuminate a stadium.\n\nMonica Lewinsky and Kathy Ireland\n\nMaybe it’s the long brown hair and similar smiles because these two could be twins in another life. Plus, both women are absolute bosses, too! Kathy Ireland is the CEO of the enormously successful design and marketing firm, Kathy Ireland Worldwide. She’s also a former supermodel from the ‘90s who blazed major fashion runways.\n\nThe 1990s weren’t as kind to a young Monika Lewinsky, who spent her 20s being vilified by the media. Lewinsky, a White House intern then, was publicly shamed after her alleged relationship with then-President Bill Clinton came to light. It took her years to bounce back, and she’s since turned to social activism.\n\nAmy Adams and Isla Fisher\n\nWe’ve all mistaken Amy Adams (of \"American Hustle\" fame) for Isla Fisher (from \"Definitely Maybe\") or vice versa at some point. They have the exact same face, skin tone, and flowy red hair. The two actors are friends in real life and are acutely aware of their resemblance. They don’t seem to mind.\n\nFisher has even played a prank on loved ones by sending out Christmas cards with Adams’s face on them instead of hers. Nobody noticed until she pointed it out!\n\nAriana Grande and Emmy Rossum\n\nSinger Ariana Grande and actress Emmy Rossum aren’t the first names that come to mind as doppelgangers. Take a closer look, however, and the resemblance is undeniable.\n\nIf you wonder what the \"Thank u, Next\" singer might look like in another 15 years, we think this comes pretty close. Rossum, who played Fiona Gallagher in \"Shameless\" (2011), is many years older. Although their career paths are different and we’re not sure if the two have met, Rossum could easily be mistaken for Grande’s older sister.\n\nOscar Isaac and Jake Johnson\n\nFew things compare to the flutters we get from TV boyfriends. We’re not suggesting that Jake Jonson and Oscar Issac are each other’s doppelgangers, but they do look alike! Isaac, as the brave and caring Poe Dameron in the Star Wars franchise, stole our hearts. Johnson, as Nick Miller in \"New Girl\" (2011), set the bar for lovable boyfriends everywhere.\n\nThe two actors look like they could play brothers in a fun road-trip film. Someone should try and get Isaac into the loft at the very least!\n\nSam Riley and Ian Curtis\n\nSam Riley is best known for playing Joy Division front-man Ian Curtis in the critically acclaimed biopic \"Control\" (2007). Curtis died on May 18, 1980, after a long battle with depression and epilepsy. He was only 23.\n\nRiley was a shoo-in for the role not only because of his talent (the man can seriously sing!) but also because of how similar he looks to the late singer. The resemblance is undeniable. We wouldn’t call them identical, however.\n\nPatrick Wilson and Chris Pratt\n\nRemember Chris Pratt as the goofy, cuddly Andy Maxwell Dwyer KBE in the 2009 sitcom \"Parks and Recreation?” Pratt today is almost unrecognizable, especially when seen as the buff Peter Quill in \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" (2014). One of the unintended outcomes of that makeover was a striking resemblance to actor Patrick Wilson.\n\nWilson is a Tony Award-winning actor who’s appeared in several movies and Broadway musicals but is famous for playing Ed Warren in The Conjuring Universe movies. There's enough evidence that the two have begun to resemble each other, right down to the blue eyes and scruffy faces.\n\nRose McGowan and Hedy Lamarr\n\nHedy Lamarr was a 1930s movie star who the industry intensely romanticized for her distinctive dark hair and light skin. Few people know that she was also an inventor extraordinaire who co-created a radio guidance system for the Allies during WWII using the same technology that powers GPS and Bluetooth devices today.\n\nMore than six decades later, Rose McGowan began her film career with similar hype about her appearance and comparisons to Lamarr. McGowan is probably best known for playing Paige Smith in \"Charmed\" (2001).\n\nMila Kunis and Sarah Hyland\n\nNo list of celebrity doppelgangers is complete without Mila Kunis and Sarah Hyland. Hyland is famous for playing the ditzy but emotionally intelligent Haley on \"Modern Family\" (2009). Kunis is best known for portraying the role of Jackie on \"That 70’s Show\" (1998). The two actors look remarkably like each other, even though Kunis is seven years Hyland's senior.\n\nThey have the same face shape, noses, and eyebrows. Their knack for appearing in similar hairstyles at events makes it harder to tell them apart!\n\nDaniel Radcliffe and Elijah Wood\n\nElijah Wood, the star of \"Lord of the Rings\" (2001), and Daniel Radcliffe, better known as Harry Potter from the Harry Potter films, could play each other's siblings. Both actors have the same blue eyes, height, and incredibly youthful faces. Wood has shared that he often gets asked if he is Radcliffe, which doesn’t bother him at all. He finds it rather amusing. Radcliffe appears to feel the same way.\n\nThe actor believes they share similar physical traits but don’t look identical. Still, Radcliffe has said he’s not averse to a role with Wood in \"Lord of the Rings,\" a logical next step to all the comparisons. We agree wholeheartedly.\n\nEva Mendes and Cindy Crawford\n\nEva Mendes first caught the world’s attention for her breakthrough role as Sara on \"Training Day\" (2001). The actor has appeared in numerous films and magazine covers since then — always gorgeous, sensual, and looking a lot like ‘90s supermodel Cindy Crawford.\n\nCan you spot the difference? Both women even have the same beauty spot above their lips. There’s also something about their eyebrows and smiles that make them look like carbon copies of each other.\n\nEli Roth and Zachary Quinto\n\nZachary Quinto and Eli Roth look frighteningly similar. The internet is full of conspiracy theorists who are convinced the two are the same person. Can you blame them? Quinto and Roth are nearly identical.\n\nQuinto is best known as Sylar in the sci-fi show \"Heroes\" and Spock in the Star Trek films. Roth is a horror movie producer with splatter films such as \"Hostel\" and \"Cabin Fever\" to his name.\n\nLogan Marshall-Green and Tom Hardy\n\nTom Hardy and Logan Marshall-Green, who are notoriously difficult to distinguish on and off-screen, are next on our list of doppelgangers. Hardy in \"Peaky Blinders\" (2013) is a spitting image of Marshall-Green in \"The Invitation\" (2015).\n\nHardy starred in \"The Revenant\" (2015), while Green appeared in \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" (2017) — both sporting beards and playing villains. The list could go on! Whether they’re playing sci-fi heroes, cops, or sporting crew cuts, there’s no way to know who’s who. Unless they speak and you get to hear their accents. The two actors were born in the 1970s: Green in South Carolina and Hardy in London. Fun fact: Marshall-Green has a twin brother in real life!\n\nIrina Shayk and Nicole Poturalski\n\nThe German model Nicole Poturalski was making waves in the fashion world long before the world came to know her in 2020 as Brad Pitt’s rumored lady love. Fans who discovered her social media handles for the first time could not get over her resemblance to Irina Shayk, famously known as the first Russian model to grace the cover of Sports Illustrated.\n\nThe resemblance is plain to see —from similar flowing manes to those enviable sun-kissed complexions. Their eye colors may set them apart, but everything else points to the models being sisters from different mothers.\n\nPaul Reubens and Alan Cumming\n\nYou’d be hard-pressed to find someone as unique as the late Paul Reubens was. He was an American comedian and actor synonymous with Pee-wee Herman. However, even Reubens had a Hollywood lookalike in Scottish actor Alan Cumming.\n\nThe stars could be long-lost brothers from across the seas! Cumming is best known for his role in the CBS drama \"The Good Wife\" (2010–2016), for which he won several Emmy awards and Golden Globe awards. Reubens joined a Los Angeles troupe called The Groundlings in the 1970s, where his stellar career in improv began.\n\nRalph Fiennes and Kevin Costner\n\nRalph Fiennes is an English actor who rose to fame for roles in critically-acclaimed films such as \"Schindler's List,\" \"The English Patient,\" and \"The Hurt Locker.\" Although he has a fraternal twin brother, Jacob Mark Fiennes, the actor’s famous Hollywood doppelganger looks more like him.\n\nWe’re talking about none other than Kevin Costner. The resemblance is uncanny, even though Fiennes has sharper, more defined features overall. Costner was the undisputed star in Hollywood during the 80s and early 90s, winning numerous awards for his performances in \"Field of Dreams\" (1989), \"Dances with Wolves\" (1990), and \"JFK\" (1991).\n\nEmbeth Davidtz and Sarah Paulson\n\nSarah Paulson rose to fame for her role in \"American Horror Story\" (2011) but she’s also known for having several doppelgangers in Hollywood.\n\nThe internet has been buzzing with memes about how she could be secretly related to several celebrities. Among the biggest epiphanies was her striking resemblance to Embeth Davidtz, who played Miss Honey in \"Matilda\" (1996). Many fans were shocked when they discovered that it was Davidtz and not Paulson who appeared in the universally adored film.\n\nLucy Hale and Selena Gomez\n\n\"Pretty Little Liars\" actor Lucy Hale is often mistaken for pop singer Selena Gomez, especially Gomez when she was on \"Wizards of Waverley Place.\" The two celebrities share almost identical face cuts and hairdos, so it can be hard to tell them apart at red-carpet events.\n\nThat’s not all they have in common, however. Gomez and Hale began their acting careers at a young age and have been killing it in Hollywood since. Hale moved to LA for an acting career at age 15, while Gomez made her first TV appearance when she was nine.\n\nMillie Bobby Brown and Halsey\n\nSinger-songwriter Halsey and actor Millie Bobby Brown have been called identical doppelgangers for years. Some people have gone out on a limb and claimed the stars are secretly related.\n\nWe can see why, since the two are near-perfect celebrity twins. It’s impossible to tell who’s who, especially when they sport similar hairstyles. On being the subject of incessant comparisons, the \"Stranger Things\" star has said she is down to play Halsey if someone makes a biopic of the musician’s life.\n\nJosh Holloway and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau\n\nJosh Holloway and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau could be long-lost brothers, don’t you think? Both actors know how to pull off scruff without looking ragged. Their hair is the perfect length to channel ruggedly handsome vibes.\n\nThey also appear to have similar noses from certain angles. Holloway and Coster-Waldau’s twinning ways extend on-screen as well. Both actors have played morally ambiguous characters in two exemplary dramas: \"Lost\" (2004) and \"Game of Thrones\" (2011).\n\nZac Efron and Chris Lowell\n\nThis Hollywood doppelganger pairing has us seeing double. It’s wild to think these are two different people because Zac Efron and Chris Lowell could be siblings. Lowell gained fame after his portrayal of Stosh \"Piz\" Piznarksi in \"Veronica Mars,\" while his Hollywood twin, Efron, will forever be known as Troy Bolton in \"High School Musical.\"\n\nDespite living in seemingly different worlds, the actors look identical, from the blue eyes and fabulous hair to the barely discernible facial fuzz.\n\nRob Lowe and Ian Somerhalder\n\nWhile appearing on the Kelly Clarkson Show, \"Vampire Diaries\" star, Ian Somerhalder was asked if people had ever mistaken him for Rob Lowe. Everyone laughed because the resemblance is undeniable. It's especially amusing because Somerhalder has previously heard about the resemblance from Lowe himself!\n\nHe also shared an amusing story about his doppelganger. The actor said Lowe sweetly approached his wife (Nikki Reed) at a party and said this is what she would be looking at in 15 years. Reed had never met him before. It’s behavior typical for the charming and ageless Rob Lowe, who has graced our television screens since the 1980s.\n\nBrad Pitt and Hermann Rorschach\n\nHermann Rorschach, a Swiss psychiatrist, is best known as the creator of the \"Rorschach inkblot test,\" which analyzes patients based on the patterns of inkblots they see.\n\nThe controversial test may have become famous, but people should have been paying more attention to the man himself. Rorschach could have been a Hollywood hottie in his day, bearing an eerie resemblance to \"Ocean's Eleven\" actor, Brad Pitt. It’s almost as if Brad Pitt traveled back in time and switched professions!\n\nAlicia Silverstone and Maggie Lawson\n\nIt's odd that Maggie Lawson and Alicia Silverstone aren't sisters or even related, given their nearly identical faces and similar careers! We’ve definitely mixed them up more than once. The two have more in common aside from their eerily similar facial features, hair, and build.\n\nBoth women are popular actors who have appeared in several films and television shows over the years. Maggie is best known as Juliet from \"Psych\" (2008), while Alicia is popular for her roles in \"Clueless\" (1995) and \"Batman & Robin\" (1997).\n\nCarla Bruni and Bella Hadid\n\nEver since Bella Hadid blazed onto the scene as the next big supermodel (alongside her big sister, Gigi), comparisons to the former French First Lady and former supermodel, Carla Bruni, have been flying in. The two women have similar razor-sharp cheekbones, smiles, and noses.\n\nBruni and Hadid look identical, whether they have their hair slicked in a bun, loose and wavy, or in a chic bob. When they ran into each other for the first time in 2018 at Cannes, Bruni joked that she may have found her secret daughter!\n\nMinka Kelly and Leighton Meester\n\nMinka Kelly and Leighton Meester are probably twins in a parallel universe. The actors look so much like each other that they co-starred in \"Roommates,\" where one girl takes over the other’s identity and life — an easy undertaking when the two actors have almost identical features.\n\nMeester became a Hollywood and pop culture sensation thanks to her portrayal of Blair Waldorf in \"Gossip Girl.\" Kelly is best known for her role in \"Friday Night Lights.\"\n\nAlexandra Daddario and Tiffany Thiessen\n\nAnother pair of celebrities who could be twins is Tffany Theissen and Alexandria Daddario. With similar dark hair and striking blue eyes, it’s easy to mistake one for the other from a distance.\n\nThey’ve also appeared on \"White Collar\" (2009) together, but the women are stars in their own right. Thiessen has become synonymous with her character, Kelly Kapowski, in \"Saved by the Bell\" (1989). Daddario is best known for appearing in \"We Summon the Darkness\" (2019) and \"Baywatch\" (2017).\n\nEmily Ratajkowski and Kendall Jenner\n\nEmily Ratajkowski and Kendall Jenner are two of the most well-known names in fashion, and these days, it’s become difficult to tell the two apart. Designers know this and often choose to have both stunners walk the runway together. For example, Jenner and Ratajkowski walked the 2018 Versace Milan Fashion Week in identical black silk dresses with only minor differences in the accessories.\n\nThe resemblance was striking — like two siblings on the runway — and not lost on the audience. Despite having so many sisters, it’s astonishing that Jenner’s true doppelganger turned out to be someone not related by blood.\n\nHelen Hunt and Leelee Sobieski\n\nActors Helen Hunt and Leelee Sobieski are well-known faces in Hollywood. Sobieski has appeared in films such as \"Here on Earth\" (2000), whereas Hunt gained fame for \"As Good as It Gets\" (1997) and \"Mad About You\" (1992).\n\nAlthough the two women have had different career trajectories, their names appear together in discussions since they look like they might be sisters. People often assume that Sobieski is Hunt’s younger sister, going so far as to call her Baby Helen Hunt.\n\nBetty Shabazz and Serena Williams\n\nThanks to art and technology, we know what some of the most prominent historical figures looked like. It turns out that many of them bear eerie resemblances to modern celebrities, almost as if they were reincarnated into this life. Tennis champ Serena Williams and Betty Shabazz are one such pair.\n\nShabazz was a passionate civil rights activist and the ex-wife of Malcolm X. Both Williams and Shabazz share the same cheekbones and strong jawlines.\n\nKeanu Reeves and Adam Driver\n\nKeanu Reeves and Adam Driver are two of the most similar-looking celebrities in Hollywood. In 2017, author Mark Millar shared a Reddit image of the duo with a face swap, and the result? Reeves and Driver are essentially the same person.\n\nThe similarities are so striking that they can leave anyone feeling bewildered. Reeves is best known for playing Neo in \"The Matrix\" (1999), as well as for his generosity and kindness to the less fortunate. Driver appeared as Kylo Ren in the Star Wars trilogy and films such as \"Marriage Story\" (2019).\n\nClémence Poésy and Claire Danes\n\nSpot the difference? That’s almost an impossible task when you put Claire Danes and Clémence Poésy next to each other. It’s probably in the big eyes, facial cut, and similar smiles. Potterheads will instantly recognize Poésy from \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" (2005), where she portrayed Fleur Delacour.\n\nDanes gained wide recognition for playing Juliet alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in the 1996 film adaptation of \"Romeo and Juliet.\"\n\nThandie Newton and Zoe Saldaña\n\nHave you ever confused “Guardians of the Galaxy” actor Zoe Saldaña for “Westworld” star Thandie Newton? Take heart, because you’re not alone. Victoria Beckham once had an entire conversation with Newton in SoulCycle class, all the while thinking she was Saldaña!\n\nEven their families can’t tell the difference sometimes. On an episode of \"The Late Late Show\" with James Corden, Saldaña revealed that her mother still thinks she acted in \"Westworld.\" All of this is unsurprising since the two actors are mirror images of each other.\n\nThe Property Brothers and Harry Connick Jr.\n\nHarry Connick Jr., Drew Scott, and Jonathan Scott could be related. On an episode of his show, Connick Jr. told his audience that he doesn’t talk about them a lot, but he actually has two brothers, and out came the Scott brothers. It makes sense since Jonathan and Harry in particular often get mistaken for each other, even more than Jonathan and Drew!\n\nThe brothers are known from HGTV's \"Property Brothers\", where they find homes and give them a new lease on life. Connick Jr. is a singer, actor, composer, and television host extraordinaire, best known for playing Leo Markus on \"Will and Grace.\"\n\nJennifer Connelly and Demi Moore\n\nJennifer Connelly is often at the receiving end of mistaken identities. The star of \"A Beautiful Mind\" says people frequently confuse her for another gorgeous brunette. When fans approach her for photographs, they usually think she’s Demi Moore. Moore starred as Molly Jensen in \"Ghost\" (1990) alongside the late Patrick Swayze.\n\nShe is also eight years older than Connelly. The actors not only share physical similarities such as hazel eyes and dark hair but have also portrayed some of the most exemplary characters on screen.\n\nDorothy Dandridge and Halle Berry\n\nIf you love look-alike moments through the ages, take a look at this pair who don’t share bloodlines or even the same era but look remarkably like each other.\n\nDorothy Dandridge made history in the 1960s for her role as Carmen. She broke the proverbial glass ceiling by being the first African American to receive an Academy Award nomination for best actress. Oscar-winner Halle Berry was the unanimous choice to play Dandridge in a 1999 TV biopic, not just for her stellar acting but also for her uncanny resemblance to the late actor.\n\nWill Ferrell and Chad Smith\n\nChad Smith is the drummer for the iconic Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Will Ferrell is a comedic genius bar none. You’re forgiven for thinking the two are the same person, however. The theory seemed plausible since, for the longest time, they had never been spotted together.\n\nAfter an (allegedly fake) online war on Reddit, the two stars agreed to come on \"The Tonight Show\" with Jimmy Fallon for a \"drum-off.\" In May 2014, that memorable drum-off took place. Ferrell and Smith came dressed in identical clothes. The resemblance was so striking that it was almost surreal.\n\nDua Lipa and Megan Fox\n\nCelebrities make headlines all the time for changing their looks. When singer-songwriter Dua Lipa found new fashion inspiration and posted pictures on Instagram, her fans and paparazzi were quick to notice the resemblance to \"Transformers\" actress Megan Fox.\n\nFrom the dark hair and smoky eye makeup right down to the clothes, Lipa seemed to be channeling her inner Megan Fox. A world with two Dua Lipas and two Megan Foxes? We’re not complaining.\n\nTaylor Swift and Karlie Kloss:\n\nIt’s clear that singer-songwriter Taylor Swift and supermodel Karlie Kloss are probably long-lost sisters or even twins. Fans first noticed how similar they looked after the celebrities shared Instagram pictures together on a road trip. The resemblance was so remarkable that it was almost unnerving — as if something had shifted in the matrix.\n\nSince then, it’s become even tougher to tell the two apart as they flaunt those high cheekbones, striking eyes, and hairstyle inspirations together!\n\nRupert Grint and Ed Sheeran\n\nThe similarity between Ed Sheeran and Rupert Grint has been a subject of discussion for years. Singer-songwriter Sheeran and Harry Potter actor Grint have often played up the comparisons with mock battles over who is the more popular ginger celebrity in Britain. Grint even made an appearance on MTV's \"After Hours\" while posing as Sheeran.\n\nIn the humorous spoof, he concludes that he can no longer keep up the charade, confessing to shocked fans that his real name is Rupert Grint.\n\nMick Jagger and Harry Styles\n\nOf all the celebrity doppelganger pairings in the world, this one takes the cake. It’s probably the only time one can say Mick Jagger and Harry Styles in the same breath! Despite their generation gap and differing musical styles, Jagger and Styles are veritable clones of each other.\n\nThe Rolling Stones singer recently weighed in on the comparisons, saying he liked Styles and they shared an easy relationship, but the resemblance was \"superficial\" at best. The former One Direction star considers Jagger an idol and hasn’t commented on their physical likeness so far.\n\nMollie King and Sienna Miller\n\nActress Sienna Miller and Mollie King, band member of \"The Saturdays,\" are both British beauties who share an uncanny resemblance. Does King look like Miller or does Miller look like King? We just can't decide.\n\nThe two celebrities are mirror images of each other, and it’s a little unsettling. It's amazing how much they resemble each other, from the same skin tone to soft, light blonde manes. These two must be related somehow!\n\nJavier Bardem and Jeffrey Dean Morgan\n\nJavier Bardem and Jeffrey Dean Morgan are so similar in appearance that they could be identical twins separated at birth. It’s not clear whether the two have ever met, however. Bardem was already big in Spain and a multiple Goya winner before his unforgettable performance in \"No Country for Old Men\" (2007).\n\nJeffrey Dean Morgan rose to fame after his big break on \"The Walking Dead\" (2010). He’s also known for playing Denny Duquette in \"Grey’s Anatomy\" (2005). Both actors say they have been mistaken for one another. It really is impossible to tell them apart.\n\nAdelaide Clemens, Carey Mulligan, and Michelle Williams\n\nTwo doppelgangers sharing the same space is confusing enough. Imagine the chaos if there were more. Just ask Adelaide Clemens, Carey Mulligan, and Michelle Williams—three supremely talented actresses who look exactly like each other! Don't believe us? Here’s photographic proof.\n\nClemens has herself said that it’s fantastic how she looks like a cross between Williams and Mulligan. The Australian star has received accolades and acclaim for her role in \"Love My Way\" (2004). Mulligan is best known for her breakthrough role in \"An Education\" (2009), while Williams’s repertoire includes roles in \"Brokeback Mountain\" (2005), \"Manchester by the Sea\" (2016), and \"Blue Valentine\" (2010).\n\nSophie Turner and Boy George\n\nBoy George and Sophie Turner are doppelgangers. You can’t unsee it once you see it. While some find the comparisons ridiculous, the stars appear to be pleased. The Culture Club frontman even suggested Turner play him in his biopic.\n\nGeorge, in keeping with his androgynous spirit, thought the idea of a woman playing him was fantastic. In response, the \"Game of Thrones\" star tweeted that she was so down with the idea. That dream collaboration may have never happened, but there’s no denying the two could be twins.\n\nMark Wahlberg and Matt Damon\n\nMatt Damon and Mark Wahlberg get mistaken for each other on occasion, but we don’t see it, especially when you look at them side by side. The actors are about the same height, although Damon is a few inches taller than Wahlberg.\n\nTheir faces are starkly different. What they do have in common is a good sense of humor when yet another person mistakes one for the other. Wahlberg apparently shrugs it off and says thank you. The Hollywood A-listers also share an impressive body of work: Damon in \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997) and Wahlberg in \"The Departed\" (2006), among others.\n\nJason Momoa and Steven Adams\n\nSteven Adams is arguably one of the strongest players in the NBA. He also looks like a Khal who just rode his trusty steed across the grasslands of Essos! The 7-foot center bears a strong resemblance to actor Jason Momoa, who played Khal Drogo in the first season of \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nBoth men effortlessly make \"grizzly\" look desirable with their long hair and full beards. They appear to be cut from the same cloth in other ways too. Momoa’s roles — whether as Khal Drogo or Aquaman — typify the conventionally strong, muscle-laden hero trying to save the day. Some might say Adams plays a similar role in the NBA.\n\nGus Kenworthy and Richard Madden\n\nGus Kenworthy is a former freestyle skier and Winter Olympics champion who bears an undeniable resemblance to Richard Madden, aka Robb Stark, in \"Game of Thrones\" (2011).\n\nThe internet noticed this immediately, as did Kenworth, who posted about his celebrity twin on Instagram and Twitter. Both stars have the same scruffy beard, blue eyes, and thick mane. Apart from physical similarities, the two have a lot in common: Madden was once King in the North, and Snowy, dangerous terrain is Kenworth’s playground.\n\nTori Spelling and Khloe Kardashian\n\nTori Spelling is a familiar name for kids from the 1990s. Spelling achieved fame as the easy-going and (mostly) wholesome Donna Martin on \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" (1990). The actress no longer resembles her former self. In 2021, she unveiled a radical new appearance after getting surgical enhancements. Shocked fans pointed out that she looked exactly like Khloé Alexandra Kardashian of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" — from her face and hair color to the clothes.\n\nWhen asked about the comparisons, Spelling said it was an honor. She added that she wasn’t going for a similar look but was happy it turned out that way. Kardashian hasn’t responded to the comparisons so far.\n\nTommy Lee Jones and Andrew Johnson\n\nAfter the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in April 1865, Andrew Johnson became the 17th President of the United States. Over 100 years later, Tommy Lee Jones, his doppelgänger, was born. Although Jones looks exactly like Johnson, he has no connection to politics, both on and off-screen.\n\nLee has played military leaders in movies, but no presidents. Is Hollywood listening? He would make a compelling Andrew Johnson. So far, his only connection to the White House is the fact that he was college roommates with former Vice President Al Gore.\n\nZach Braff and Dax Shepard\n\nDax Shephard and Zach Braff are funny guys. They also redefine celebrity twin goals. The actor who gave us JD in \"Scrubs\" couldn’t help but make jokes about his remarkable similarity to Shephard. A few years ago, he tweeted a hilarious side-by-side picture of them grinning, courtesy of Shephard’s wife, Kristen Bell.\n\nShe had used a Face Swap app on their faces, and there was no way to tell who was who! You know the twinning is real when technology can’t tell you apart. Shephard, an actor, producer, writer, and host of the \"Armchair Expert\" podcast, was equally taken aback. He stated that there did not appear to be any face-swapping.\n\nQueen Latifah and Zora Neale Hurston\n\nWhen today’s celebrities resemble famous faces from the past, it gives a new meaning to the word \"timeless.\" Take the case of acterss Queen Latifah and Zora Neale Hurston, one of the most celebrated black activists and authors of the 1930s.\n\nSeveral universities regard Hurston's writing as essential Harlem Renaissance reading. Queen Latifah seems to have a lot in common with the author, beyond the same smile, cheekbones, and striking eyes. She’s a singer, actor, and playwright who has been successful at everything she tries.\n\nJamie Dornan and Prince Carl Philip\n\nMost people are intimately familiar with actor Jamie Doran, the devilishly handsome actor in \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" (2015). The internet went into a tizzy when fans discovered similarities between Doran and the Swedish Prince, Carl Philip. Prince Carl Philip is the fourth in line to the throne. The two men are wildly popular for their trademark brooding gaze and rugged facial hair.\n\nBoth men frequently appear in formal clothes with their dark hair neatly slicked back. Prince Carl Philip earned massive brownie points when he made his Instagram account public, giving fans access to hundreds of pictures for deeper comparison!\n\nRachel Bilson and Kaia Gerber\n\nKaia Gerber already bears a striking resemblance to her mother, supermodel Cindy Crawford. Gerber might also have a long-lost sister from another mother in Rachel Bilson. It’s wild that they’re not related since they share almost identical features. Rachel Bilson is a well-known Hollywood face who has starred in popular shows such as \"The O.C.\" (2013) and \"Hart of Dixie\"(2011).\n\nGerber has effortlessly stepped into her mother’s shoes as a model. She has walked the runway for prestigious fashion houses such as Fendi and Max Mara, as well as acted in several shows."
