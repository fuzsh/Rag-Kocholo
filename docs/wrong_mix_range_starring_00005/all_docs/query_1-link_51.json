        "text": "Hollywood actress Uma Thurman looked almost unrecognisable as she attended a bash in New York on Monday.\n\nThe 44-year-old looked happy and relaxed as posed for pictures at the premiere party of NBC's new series The Slap.\n\nBut the star looked noticeably different to how she did just months ago.\n\nWith minimal make-up save for striking dark red lips, the Pulp Fiction star's skin looked visibly smoother as she smiled for camera at the New Museum in Manhattan's Lower East Side.\n\nThe mum-of-three styled her hair in a sleek down 'do rather than her usual loose waves.\n\nDressed in a floor length black strapless dress, Uma made sure she had all eyes on her and her toned figure.\n\nThe star teamed the simple but classic look with black strappy shoes and a black overcoat.\n\nOn the night, Uma was joined by co-stars Thandie Newton, Peter Sarsgaard and Melissa George.\n\nFor more pictures of Uma, scroll through the gallery below..."
