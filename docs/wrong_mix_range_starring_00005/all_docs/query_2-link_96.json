        "text": "Quentin Tarantino’s 2012 western “Django Unchained” is set in various locations across the USA. The filming locations also span across several states, including California, Wyoming and Louisiana. In the opening of the film, Django, played by Jamie Foxx, is shown as a slave. The was filmed at Alabama Hills in Lone Pine, California. Alabama Hills is a staple of old westerns, having been used in dozens of films, such as “How the West Was Won” and “The Gunfighter.” It appears in more modern films as well, such as “Iron Man,” “Tremors,” “Gladiator” and more.\n\nLOCATION: Alabama Hills, Lone Pine, CA 93545\n\nDr. King Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz, arrives with Django in the town of Daughtrey, Texas. This was actually filmed at Melody Ranch in Newhall, California. The sets are sometimes moved around at Melody, depending on the needs of the latest production. So it can be tricky matching up every shot, but there remains a lot of areas that do match up almost exactly. The same ranch is also briefly seen in the early scenes of Tarantino’s “Once Upon A Time In… Hollywood,” on the set of the fictional “Bounty Law.”\n\nThe two are first seen arriving into the town between these two buildings.\n\nLOCATION: 24715 Oakcreek Ave, Newhall, CA 91321\n\nThey are seen passing this building.\n\nThey proceed down this main street, as the locals stare them down. This section has changed a bit from how it appeared in the film.\n\nSchultz parks his wagon in front of the building on the left. Most of this area still looks the same as it did in the film.\n\nThe enter this saloon, where the bartender quickly runs out to fetch the sheriff. The doors were switched to swinging doors in the film. This same set was featured prominently in the TV show “Westworld,’ as the brothel where Thandie Newton’s character works.\n\nAfter the bartender runs out, Schultz prepares some beer for himself and Django.\n\nHere are some views from upstairs.\n\nDr. Schultz has a confrontation with the sheriff between these two buildings. The boardwalk on the left is where Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt sit for their “Bounty Law” interview at the beginning of “Once Upon A Time In… Hollywood.”\n\nThe marshall, played by Tom Wopat, has a short standoff with Dr. Schultz and Django in front of these buildings, before Schultz reveals he is a bounty hunter with a valid warrant. Schultz and Django are also seen walking past these buildings earlier when they first entered the town.\n\nLater in the film, Dr. Schultz and Django make their way to Tennessee. Django picks out a new set of clothes for himself at the Chattanooga Haberdashery. This was also filmed at Melody Ranch.\n\nUnlike most movie ranches in Southern California, Melody Ranch does in fact offer tours to the public. However, the challenge is simply finding availability. The ranch is sometimes booked for months or years at a time, hosting such shows as “Deadwood,” “Westworld” and “Peaky Blinders,” as well as numerous films and commercials. With such high demand as a filming location, the opportunities for tours are quite limited and require much diligence or good timing.\n\nIn search of the Brittle Brothers, Schultz and Django make their way to a plantation owned by Big Daddy, played by Don Johnson, supposedly located in Tennessee. This was filmed at the Evergreen Plantation in Edgard, Louisiana. The Evergreen Plantations was formerly available for tours to the public, but has since stopped offering them. This main house can actually be seen from the road, but it is a busy road, so it’s not the safest area to try to grab photos. The same plantation was featured in the films “The Beguiled,” “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,” “Antebellum” and “Free State of Jones,” as well the TV shows “Preacher,” “Into the Badlands” and the 2016 version of “Roots.”\n\nLOCATION: 4677 LA-18, Edgard, LA 70049\n\nThe pair are seen entering through this front gate. The dirt trail leading to the house has since grown back over with grass.\n\nThere is a flashback scene of the Brittle Brothers beating Django’s wife Broomhilda, played by Kerry Washington. This was filmed at the back of the Evergreen Plantation, where real housing communities were set up for slaves.\n\nDjango confronts the Brittle Brothers in this area, also located behind the main house at the Evergreen Plantation. John Brittle is about the beat a woman who is tied to the base of the tree located next to the white barn. After Django exacts his revenge, Dr. Schultz soon joins him at the scene.\n\nAs Django and Schultz gear up and mount their horses to go in search of Broomhilda, we are back at Melody Ranch. They first ride out of this building.\n\nCandyland, the estate of Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, was a set constructed for the film. The exterior was built on the grounds of the Evergreen Plantation, which has since been removed. The interiors were filmed at Second Line Stages in New Orleans (800 Richard St, New Orleans, LA 70130).\n\nBack in Lone Pine, where the opening of the film takes place, you’ll find the excellent Lone Pine Film History Museum. During the production, Tarantino would hold screenings for crew members at the museum’s screening room. At the completion of the film, Tarantino donated the dentist wagon of Dr. Schultz, where it is currently on display. If you have the opportunity, we highly recommend visiting the museum, which dives deep into the history of the many films shot in the Lone Pine area.\n\nLOCATION: 701 S Main St, Lone Pine, CA 93545\n\nAlso on display at the museum is a photo of Tarantino and the cast, as well as a signed copy of the script.\n\nHere is a director’s chair from the film.\n\nOver at Melody Ranch, they also have their own museum, known as the Melody Ranch Motion Pictures Studio Museum. The collection contains a mixture of memorabilia acquired by the owners over the years, as well as items donated by productions shot at the ranch. There is a small area focused on “Django Unchained.”\n\nRelated articles: Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill (2003), Once Upon A Time In… Hollywood (2019)\n\nWhen word began to spread that Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon A Time In… Hollywood” would be using practical set dressing to convert Los Angeles back to 1969 block by block, we knew this rare occurrence was something we should capture as much as possible for the fleeting moments it took place.\n\nWe typically avoid visiting filming locations while a project is in active production. There are so many moving pieces, restricted areas and things in the way, it almost always proves best to wait until a production has left. However, this film proved to be an exception. Documenting the locations in real time made for a much different, more challenging process. Some areas, such as Hollywood Blvd, were lined with large crowds actively watching for nights on end. Other places, such as the Spahn Ranch set, were quite low profile and known to very few. The locations were so impressive, we’ve deviated a bit from our usual format to show some set dressing and behind the scenes photos. Not everything made it to camera, so we thought it was worthwhile to showcase the level of detail that went into the project. While there are some minor spoilers in this article, we did our best to avoid any major ones.\n\nThe early scenes of Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt, on the set of “Bounty Law” were filmed at Melody Ranch in Newhall, California. This is not Tarantino’s first time filming at Melody Ranch. Some scenes from”Django Unchained” were also filmed there. Melody Ranch does offer tours to the public, which is a rarity among movie ranches in Southern California. However, the challenge is that it’s a very popular filming location, often booked for months at a time. There are only a few opportunities a year you can successfully book a tour and it is typically on very short notice. Here’s a look at several buildings seen in the film during the “Bounty Law” advertisement.\n\nLOCATION: 24715 Oakcreek Ave, Newhall, CA 91321\n\nRick and Cliff sit down for an interview along the boardwalk in front of this building. The interior was used extensively as the brothel where Thandie Newton’s character works in “Westworld.” The interior of this building was also featured in Tarantino’s “Django Unchained,” where Dr. King Schulz has a confrontation with the sheriff.\n\nRick and Cliff head to Musso & Frank Grill to meet Marvin Schwarzs, played by Al Pacino. Musso & Frank Grill is the oldest restaurant in Hollywood, founded over 100 years ago. The restaurant has popped up in numerous films, including “Ocean’s Eleven,” “Ed Wood,” “Blonde” and “Swingers,” as well as the TV shows “Mad Men” and “Bosch.”\n\nLOCATION: 6667 Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028\n\nRick and Cliff sit at the bar when Marvin first arrives.\n\nAfter the meeting, Rick and Cliff head to the parking lot in back and have a quick chat in front of this sign.\n\nThe flashback of Rick crashing his car is in front of the Frolic Room on Hollywood Blvd. The same bar was used in such films as “L.A. Confidential” and “The Little Things.”\n\nLOCATION: 6245 Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028\n\nRick Dalton lives on Cielo Drive next door to Sharon Tate, played by Margot Robbie. The real entrance to Cielo Dr is seen multiple times in the film. The houses seen in the film are not actually located on the real Cielo, but the Tate house is a pretty close representation of what was there in 1969. Most of Cielo is actually public, but the path up to the former Tate residence is private. The entrance area seen in the film is visible from the public portion of the road.\n\nLOCATION: Cielo Dr, Beverly Hills, CA 90210\n\nThe actual home used as the exterior for Rick Dalton’s house can be found in a cul-de-sac in Studio City. It’s actually one of three locations used in the film to composite Rick’s home, as each of the individual locations lacked specific features needed for the story. The Studio City home was used extensively, however, with many scenes recognizable to it. Unlike Cielo Dr, Alto View Dr is a public road.\n\nLOCATION: 10969 Alta View Dr, Studio City, CA 91604\n\nThe driveway is featured in many scenes in the film, with a large painting of Rick placed on the left side.\n\nHere is the front entrance of the home. The door was painted green in the film.\n\nRick’s pool overlooking the city is a real pool at the home.\n\nHere is an alternate view of the pool, along with the area where Rick stores his flamethrower.\n\nAs Rick is memorizing his lines for an upcoming role at his pool, the camera shifts over to the Tate/Polanski house, which is a geographically accurate shot.\n\nThe house next door serves as the home of Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski. The home is a departure from how the real house on Cielo appeared, but it serves Tarantino’s story well. This is actually one of two locations used for the home. We cover the second location later in this article.\n\nLOCATION: 10974 Alta View Dr, Studio City, CA 91604\n\nHere is a view of Rick Dalton’s house on the right and the Tate/Polanski gate on the left.\n\nHere’s a closer look at the gate to the Tate residence.\n\nHere is the area where Charles Manson, played by Damon Herriman, parks a Twinkies delivery truck. Cliff observes him from the roof as he goes looking for Terry Melcher.\n\nHere is the road leading into the cul-de-sac of the Dalton and Tate/Polanski residences, which is seen a few times in the film.\n\nAfter dropping Rick off at his home, Cliff drives at high speeds down Hollywood Blvd as he heads home.\n\nLOCATION: Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028\n\nHere is Brad Pitt waiving to the crowd on the street.\n\nTarantino acknowledging the crowd of onlookers as well.\n\nHere’s a deeper look at the set dressing around Hollywood Blvd, which was completely transformed back to 1969 for the film.\n\nCliff’s trailer, supposedly located on the grounds of the Van Nuys Drive-In Theatre (a real drive-in theater long since closed), was a combination of two locations. The drive-in sign was built by the production at the Saugus Speedway in Santa Clarita, which now serves as the site of the Santa Clarita Swap Meet. Cliff drives past the white fencing and enters here.\n\nLOCATION: 22500 Soledad Canyon Rd, Santa Clarita, CA 91350\n\nThe camera cranes up over the sign, which was a creation of the production and we’re seamlessly transported to a second location. The drive-in itself is the Paramount Drive-In Theaters.\n\nLOCATION: 7770 Rosecrans Ave, Paramount, CA 90723\n\nSharon Tate and husband Roman Polanski attend a party at the Playboy Mansion. This was filmed at the real former Playboy Mansion. The property sits in a residential neighborhood and if you didn’t know what you were looking for, it would be very easy to drive past without any idea. It should be noted from the street you can mostly just see the front gate. Since the passing of Hugh Hefner, the property has transitioned over to new owners, into a place for corporate functions, private events and film and television production, as well as undergoing substantial renovations.\n\nLOCATION: 10236 Charing Cross Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90024\n\nSharon dances in the back area on the left, near the grotto. The mansion has appeared in countless films, such as “The House Bunny,” “Beverly Hills Cop II,” “Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle,” the 2014 version of “The Gambler,” “The Phantom” and many more.\n\nAfter the party at the Playboy Mansion, the film cuts to morning at the home of Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate. This is not the same home in Studio City seen earlier in the film. Roman is seen sitting in the back yard with his dog. This home can be found in Tarzana and was painted red for the film. It sits right next to another filming location; the winding road seen to the left of the frame was featured prominently in “Licorice Pizza.”\n\nLOCATION: 19471 Rosita St, Tarzana, CA 91356\n\nThe scene where Cliff fights Bruce Lee supposedly takes place on a studio backlot. In reality, it was filmed at a high school, with heavy set dressing added to make it appear like a backlot. The school is Excelsior High School in Norwalk, which was also featured in the film “Grease 2.” Cliff sits outside of Rick’s trailer, which is parked in this lot. Randy, played by Kurt Russell, speaks with Rick in his trailer and reluctantly agrees to hire Cliff onto the stunt team.\n\nLOCATION: 15711 Pioneer Blvd, Norwalk, CA 90650\n\nHere is the area where the fight between Cliff and Bruce Lee takes place.\n\nJanet, played by Zoë Bell, comes across the two men sparring and insists Cliff be fired on the spot.\n\nThe Manson Family girls are introduced digging through the dumpsters at the Super A Foods market. The same market was seen in the films “A Star Is Born” and “Crossroads.”\n\nLOCATION: 2924 Division St, Los Angeles, CA 90065\n\nIt’s difficult to see, but the actresses playing the Manson girls, including Harley Quinn Smith, are gathered by the dumpster in the center of this shot.\n\nThe Manson girls then walk away with their haul, making their way past this mural of James Dean from the film “Giant.” This was located at a pharmacy just across the street from the Super A Foods market. It was added by the production and is unfortunately no longer painted on the actual location.\n\nLOCATION: 2922 Division St, Los Angeles, CA 90065\n\nHere’s a look at some more of the shoot from Super A Foods.\n\nCliff and Rick stop at this intersection, where Cliff first sees Pussycat, played by Margaret Qualley, crossing the street with the Manson Family girls.\n\nLOCATION: Corbin Ave / Greenbriar Dr, Los Angeles, CA 91356\n\nWhile driving, Cliff again spots Pussycat sitting in front of the Pandora’s Box nightclub looking for a ride. Pandora’s Box was a real nightclub in West Hollywood, which was at the center of protests over a curfew in 1966. The building was eventually demolished in 1967. For the film, the production recreated the former nightclub at Jospeh’s Cafe on Ivar Ave. Here’s a view of when the production was setting up for the scene.\n\nLOCATION: 1775 Ivar Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90028\n\nFrom the reverse view at the same location, Cliff can be seen in his car with the Capitol Records building in the background.\n\nHere’s a couple more shots from when the Pandora’s Box shoot was prepping.\n\nOn her way to the theater, Sharon picks up a hitchhiker on Wilshire Blvd.\n\nLOCATION: Near the intersection of Wilshire Blvd / S Beverly Glen Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90024\n\nSharon parks in this lot and parts ways with the hitchhiker.\n\nLOCATION: Near 972 Gayley Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90024\n\nSharon stops by the Bruin Theater to watch herself in the film “The Wrecking Crew” with Dean Martin. The Bruin is still in operation, though the marquee is now digital. Fatboy Slim’s music video for “Praise You” shot in front of the same theater.\n\nLOCATION: 948 Broxton Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90024\n\nThe Fox Theater right across the street is also seen in several shots.\n\nLOCATION: 961 Broxton Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90024\n\nHere’s a closer look at the Fox Theater, with the finished marquee for the film.\n\nHere is the view across the street from the Bruin Theater, when it was dressed for filming.\n\nHere is the exterior of the book store Sharon Tate visits. It’s not a book store in realty, but this is what it looked like when it was fully dressed.\n\nLOCATION: 10909 Weyburn Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90024\n\nThis travel agency was also seen in the film. It was another creation of the production and not an actual travel agency.\n\nHere are some more views of the area when production was in progress.\n\nCliff takes Rick down Hollywood Blvd and they pass the famous Pantages Theater.\n\nLOCATION: 6233 Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028\n\nCliff runs into Pussycat once again in front of Jackalope Pottery in North Hollywood.\n\nLOCATION: 10726 Burbank Blvd, North Hollywood, CA 91601\n\nHere is the area when filming was taking place. It was overflowing with crew at the corner.\n\nJust across the street, Quentin Tarantino stood on the right, along with Rick Dalton’s car on the street.\n\nCliff heads onto the freeway with Pussycat, turning from Hollywood Blvd onto the 101 northbound ramp.\n\nLOCATION: US-101 northbound ramp, near Hollywood Blvd / N Van Ness Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90028\n\nPussycat takes Cliff to Spahn Ranch, which was a very accurate recreation built at Corriganville Park in Simi Valley. Originally the production hoped to film at the real Spahn Ranch, but due to the fact that the entrances were bulldozed over, it made the land difficult for building sets. Much like Spahn Ranch, the nearby Corriganville is also a former movie ranch which hosted many westerns in during the 1950s and 1960s, before being destroyed by widlfires. The land now operates as a public park, but there are many signs explaining the land’s film history and the frames of the old buildings are still in the ground.\n\nThe Spahn Ranch set took a couple months to build, but when it was finished, it shot very quickly and was demolished just a few weeks later. Having done plenty of research on the real Spahn Ranch and The Manson Family long before this film was ever announced, we were quite well versed in the subject matter. Standing in person at what was a near exact, full scale replica of Spahn Ranch remains one of the most memorable location experiences we’ve ever had. The production design and attention to detail was incredible. If you go there now, it’s empty land again, but here we’ll take a look at when the set existed.\n\nLOCATION: 7001 Smith Rd, Simi Valley, CA 93063 (Spahn Ranch sets now demolished)\n\nGeorge Spahn’s house plays a key role in the scene, as Cliff insists on speaking with the old man, played by Bruce Dern.\n\nSome more views of the Spahn house.\n\nHere is a view of the front of the Spahn set, including the famous truck. The signs for the Longhorn Saloon and Rock City Cafe are spot on to the original ranch.\n\nHere is the horse stable area where Clem sits on the fence.\n\nHere are some more views around the ranch.\n\nAfter leaving Spahn Ranch, Cliff picks up Rick in front of the Columbia Pictures building. This is actually in front of Paramount Pictures Studio Tour building.\n\nLOCATION: 5515 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90038\n\nRick is photographed with a new love interest in tow at a restaurant, supposedly located in Rome, Italy. This is actually the Cicada Restaurant in Downtown Los Angeles. The interior is also seen in another scene of Marvin Schwarz calling Rick as he sits at the bar. The restaurant has been featured in numerous films, such as “Mank” “Pretty Woman,” “Mr. & Mrs. Smith,” “Indecent Proposal,” “Suicide Squad” and “Bruce Almighty,” as well as such TV shows as “Mad Men, “The Morning Show” and “American Horror Story.”\n\nLOCATION: 617 S Olive St, Los Angeles, CA 90014\n\nRick returns from Italy with his costar. The couple is seen walking past the wall tiles of Terminal 6 at LAX Airport. These tiles can be found along the pedestrian tunnel in the lower level and are only accessible to airline passengers and staff, as they make their way to baggage claim or the exits. Tarantino also filmed Pam Grier in this area in the opening of “Jackie Brown.”\n\nLOCATION: Terminal 6, 1 World Way, Los Angeles, CA 90045 (lower level, arrivals area)\n\nIn the third act, a montage of businesses are shown turning on their neon lights as night falls, leading up to the conclusion of the film.\n\nAn old Taco Bell is also shown. This was located much further south in Tunstin. The building was abandoned and the production came and made it look like an operational Taco Bell from 1969.\n\nLOCATION: 14232 Newport Ave, Tustin, CA 92780\n\nThe famous Cinerama Dome in Hollywood is seen next.\n\nLOCATION: 6360 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028\n\nThe Vine Theater on Hollywood Blvd is also seen. This was part of the production design for when Cliff is seen driving home early in the film.\n\nLOCATION: 6321 Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028\n\nThe Supply Sergeant sign is also seen illuminating. This remains an active business on Hollywood Blvd. The same sign can be seen in the film “Savage Streets.”\n\nLOCATION: 6664 Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028\n\nChili John’s in Burbank is also briefly seen.\n\nLOCATION: 2018 W Burbank Blvd, Burbank, CA 91506\n\nDer Wienerschnitzel is actually a taco stand today, which the production altered to make it appear like it did back in the 1960s.\n\nLOCATION: 1910 W Pacific Coast Hwy, Long Beach, CA 90810\n\nSharon Tate, Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger and Voytek Frykowski have dinner that evening at the El Coyote restaurant. This is where the real people ate that night and the film shot at the actual location.\n\nLOCATION: 7312 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90036\n\nHere is a view of the front entrance of El Coyote, which remains in business to this day.\n\nRick and Cliff have dinner at the same evening at Casa Vega in Sherman Oaks.\n\nLOCATION: 13301 Ventura Blvd, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423\n\nThe location actually appears twice in the film, with one of the booths inside also standing in as a restaurant supposedly in Spain.\n\nWe leave you with Quentin Tarantino’s hand and foot prints in front of the Chinese Theater on Hollywood Blvd. While in no way a filming location, we felt it was nevertheless fitting to include.\n\nLOCATION: 6925 Hollywood Blvd, Hollywood, CA 90028\n\nIt was a unique experience walking through 1969 with the production and we hope these photos help you share in that experience. There’s actually many locations we captured where the production shot, but were not featured in the final film. Perhaps there will be a longer or alternate cut someday. For now, we’ll keep to the places that made it into the film.\n\nRelated articles: Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill (2003), Django Unchained (2012)\n\nOliver Stone’s 1994 film “Natural Born Killers” was shot in quite a few different locations, including Arizona, New Mexico, Illinois and Indiana, as the story depicts two killers on a cross-country mass murder spree. In the opening scenes of the film, Micky and Mallory, played by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis respectively, visit a restaurant on a desert road known as the “5 To 2 Cafe.” After some unwanted advances and rude remarks from some locals, things quickly turn violent.\n\nThe building used in the scene was vacant at the time of filming and dressed to appear like a working establishment by the filmmakers. It still remains standing all these years later, although it is closed down and long since boarded up. The former diner can be found on AZ-99, along an isolated stretch on the outskirts of Winslow, Arizona. To visit in person, it feels quite remote. However, in reality, it’s only a few miles from Interstate 40, between the highway and the town of Leupp. The exact location of the building is 35°06’54.8″N, 110°52’20.3″W.\n\nLOCATION: AZ-99, Winslow, AZ 86047 (between Interstate 40 and Indian Rte 15, Leupp) (GPS coordinates: 35°06’54.8″N, 110°52’20.3″W)\n\nThe property is fenced off from the sides and there is a residence next door, so be careful not to trespass or disturb the tenants.\n\nThese distinct circular windows can still be seen on the sides of the building. The windows are seen in the film behind Juliette Lewis, as she dances in front of the jukebox.\n\nThe overheating truck pulls up in front.\n\nFor those wondering, the “5 To 2 Cafe” sign out front near the road is long since gone.\n\nMicky and Mallory get married at the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge in El Prado, New Mexico. The bridge is far removed from most tourist destinations, requiring hours of driving through mountains and winding terrain to reach it. Once you’re there, however, it’s instantly recognizable.\n\nLOCATION: Rio Grande Gorge Bridge, US-64, El Prado, NM 87529\n\nThe same bridge appeared in the films “Twins,” “She’s Having A Baby,” “Wild Hogs,” “Vacation,” “Paul,” “Terminator: Salvation,” “The Signal,” “Catchfire” and “White Sands.”\n\nHere is where the doll falls at the beginning of the scene and where Micky and Mallory cut their hands, hold them together and drop their blood into the river below.\n\nHere is where the loud truck passengers drive by and momentarily irritate Micky and Mallory.\n\nThe gorge is a very sheer drop, so the surrounding land is mostly fenced off, preventing you from getting too close to the edges. Here is about as close as you can get, with this view taken through the wire fencing.\n\nHere is a view standing on the middle of the bridge looking out at the road. It gets extremely windy on this bridge, so much so, you can feel the vibration on the bridge as you stand on it.\n\nThis side of the gorge isn’t seen in the film, but here is the view from the opposite side of the bridge.\n\nHere are some landmarks and signs for the bridge. You can see some of the fencing in the background, which is taller than it may appear here.\n\nWhile it is permissible to fly drones at the bridge, the area is so windy, you’ll almost certainly lose your drone immediately if you attempt to fly one. We don’t recommend trying it. There is a parking lot available on one side of the bridge and a rest area on the other side, making it easy to access on foot. The drive to get there is the hardest part.\n\nLater in the film, Micky and Mallory are finally captured at the “Drug Zone” after being bitten by rattlesnakes and in need of medicine. The building is currently a crafts store and can be found in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Aside from the sign and some changes to the front entrance, the building otherwise still resembles how it appeared in the film.\n\nLOCATION: 9350 Eagle Ranch Rd NW, Albuquerque, NM 87114\n\nA standoff between Micky and the cops ensues out front and after surrendering, Micky is then beaten by the police, as they try to prevent a film crew from capturing it.\n\nHere’s a look from inside the store, in the general area where Micky exits and surrenders.\n\nThe exterior courthouse scene, where the large crowd is gathered, was filmed in Chicago. The interior court scenes were filmed at Hammond City Hall in Hammond, Indiana (5925 Calumet Ave, Hammond, IN 46320).\n\nLOCATION: 78 E Washington St, Chicago, IL 60602\n\nThe prison scenes were filmed at Stateville Correctional Center, a real, operating prison in Crest Hill, about 45 minutes south of Chicago. The same prison appeared in the 1983 film “Bad Boys,” as well as the 1987 film “Weeds.” While images of the facility are widely available online, we were quickly told by prison guards not to take photographs. So we do not recommend attempting them here.\n\nLOCATION: 16830 IL-53, Crest Hill, IL 60403\n\nTo see our “Natural Born Killers” location page, click here.\n\nRelated articles: U Turn (1997)\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s 1997 Elmore Leonard adaptation was shot primarily in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County, where the director also lived for much of his youth. In the 20 years since the film was released, many of the locations have long since been remodeled or demolished, but many still stand as well.\n\nIn the opening scenes, Jackie Brown, played by Pam Grier, is seen hurrying through LAX Airport. The opening titles play over the wall tiles of Terminal 3. These tiles can be found along the pedestrian tunnel in the lower level and are only accessible to airline passengers and staff, as they make their way to baggage claim or the exits. Tarantino returned to this area for a scene in “Once Upon A Time In… Hollywood.”\n\nLOCATION: Terminal 3, 1 World Way, Los Angeles, CA 90045 (lower level, arrivals area)\n\nJackie is seen passing this area, which is at Terminal 5 in the departure level. This area too is only accessible to airline passengers and staff. It’s since been remodeled a bit from how it appeared in the film.\n\nLOCATION: Terminal 5, 1 World Way, Los Angeles, CA 90045 (departures level)\n\nAnother section of Terminal 5 Jackie is seen walking through.\n\nAs we’re introduced to the rest of the cast, we meet a beach bunny named Melanie, played by Bridget Fonda. Several scenes were filmed at Melanie’s apartment, which was actually a composite of two different locations. The interior, where most of the scenes take place, can be found at this beachfront property in Hermosa Beach.\n\nLOCATION: 6403 Ocean Front Walk, Playa Del Rey, CA 90293\n\nThe outside of Melanie’s apartment, where Jackie and Ordell, played by Samuel L. Jackson, walk down a long corridor talking, was actually filmed at the building right across the street, which was much larger. Together the two buildings create what you see in the film.\n\nLOCATION: 6309 Ocean Front Walk, Playa Del Rey, CA 90293\n\nOrdell finds himself in need of a bail bondsman and meets Max Cherry, played by Robert Forster. Cherry Bail Bonds was filmed at Carson Bail Bonds in Carson, California. Unfortunately it was demolished around 2009 and replaced by some apartment buildings.\n\nLOCATION: 724 E Carson St, Carson, CA 90745 (now demolished)\n\nCarson City Hall, which can be seen in the background across the street, still matches up. It is seen in several shots through the front window, such as when Ordell and Louis, played by Robert De Niro, park in front of Cherry Bail Bonds.\n\nOrdell makes his way to the apartment of Beaumont, who he has just bailed out of jail. In the film, the apartment is said to be located in “Hollywood, two blocks up from Hollywood Blvd and Western.” In reality, it’s nowhere near there. The real apartment can be found in Wilmington, California. Beaumont’s apartment was unit #16, which is the same unit number seen in the film. Today, the building is no longer accessible to the public.\n\nLOCATION: 1030 Lakme Ave, Wilmington, CA 90744\n\nAfter Ordell convinces Beaumont to tag along as backup while he sells some guns, the two make their way down the stairs.\n\nOrdell explains the situation as they talk at the front entrance of the building.\n\nAfter Ordell convinces Beaumont to hide in his trunk and slams it shut, he drives a very short distance into a vacant lot and kills Beaumont. The vacant lot was located exactly across the street from Beaumont’s apartment location in Wilmington. This scene was done as a single take with a crane shot. This vacant area has since been filled with numerous homes. This is what the area looks like today from the street.\n\nIn the shot, you can see a church with a long steeple in the distance. That church is still there, known as the Calvary Light Christian Center. Here’s a closer view of the church, seen as Ordell turns left down Denni Street.\n\nLOCATION: Lakme Ave and Denni St, Wilmington, CA 90744\n\nRight across the street from the church is this small parking lot, which is about the closest remnant to what the area looked like in the film.\n\nAfter Jackie is arrested by LAPD Detective Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) and ATF agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton), she is taken to a police station and asked to give up Ordell in exchange for her freedom. The police station scenes were filmed at what was, at the time of filming, part of the production offices. The building is only seen from interior views in the film, but here is what it looks like outside. The interior of the building was used for another scene, when Jackie is exchanging the money inside a department store dressing room. Both the police interrogation room and dressing room were sets built inside the building.\n\nLOCATION: 6025 W Slauson Ave, Culver City, CA 90230\n\nMax Cherry picks up Jackie from jail at the Sybil Brand Institute, which at the time of filming, was a real, operational women’s prison in Los Angeles. It was here that Manson Family member Susan Atkins confessed to a cell mate named Virginia Graham about the Tate Murders. Graham in turn shared what Atkins had told her, which eventually helped lead to the capture of Charles Manson. The prison shut down in 1997, but today the grounds are still owned by the Los Angeles sherrif’s office, where it’s used by warehouse companies and for filming purposes. Walking the grounds in person, however, it still very much feels like you’re at a prison.\n\nLOCATION: 4500 City Terrace Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90063\n\nHere’s a wider view of the premises, though it’s never seen from this angle in the film.\n\nMax and Jackie grab a drink at the former Cockatoo Inn in Hawthorne, exactly as stated in the film. It appears in another scene whenever Jackie meets Ordell, then a third time whenever Ordell and Louis have a discussion. Sadly the location closed down in 1996 shortly before filming took place. While the property was not razed altogether, it has since been so heavily remodeled, it no longer appears anything like it did in the film. The signs are long gone and the interior is completely different, but it is still the original building. You can find old images online of how it used to appear.\n\nLOCATION: 11500 Acacia Ave, Hawthorne, CA 90250 (heavily remodeled)\n\nMax drops Jackie off at her apartment, where Ordell soon pays her a visit. The apartment can be found in Torrence.\n\nLOCATION: 17575 Yukon Ave, Torrance, CA 90504\n\nMuch of the film takes place at the Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrence, which is correctly stated as such in the film.\n\nLOCATION: 3525 W Carson St, Torrance, CA 90503\n\nA couple scenes take place in the food court, including when Max runs into Jackie and when Jackie does the trial run for the money exchange. The mall has since been heavily remodeled and the food court not only looks nothing like how it appeared in the film, it’s actually now located in a completely different section of the mall. However, we photographed the original food court years ago, back when it still appeared similar to how it did in the film.\n\nAt the start of the “trial run” money exchange, Jackie is seen exiting an elevator after her flight and being met by Ray and Mark. The scene supposedly takes place at LAX, but it’s actually another part of Del Amo Mall. This is the East Parking Garage, but unfortunately the scene was filmed on the second level and all upper levels of this structure have since been closed off for an indeterminate amount of time.\n\nLOCATION: GPS coordinates: 33.828457, -118.348661\n\nJust before the actual money exchange, Jackie is seen driving down Sepulveda Blvd. The vehicle she’s driving is the same car Butch drives in “Pulp Fiction,” as she listens to Randy Crawford’s “Street Life.”\n\nLOCATION: 2407 Sepulveda Blvd, Torrance, CA 90501\n\nAt the start of the second, “for real this time,” money exchange, Jackie is seen entering the mall in front of these distinctive blue bricks of what was formerly a Marshall’s store on Del Amo Cir Blvd. Marshall’s relocated to a new location at the mall in 2018 and these blue bricks were sadly removed in 2019, due to remodeling.\n\nLOCATION: 365 Del Amo Cir Blvd, Torrance, CA 90503 (heavily remodeled)\n\nBack at Del Amo Mall, Melanie and Louis meet up with Jackie for the money exchange at the fictional Billingsley Department Store in the mall, which is currently a Macy’s store. The store has changed quite a bit over the two decades since filming, so things don’t appear as they did back then. This is the approximate area where Jackie heads for the dressing room, which is located on the third floor of Macy’s. The actual dressing room, as mentioned earlier, was a set built at the film’s production offices.\n\nHere is the approximate area where Louis and Melanie observe what’s happening and argue.\n\nMax Cherry arrives outside of the store on the upper level. A prop Billingsley sign was mounted on the wall.\n\nWhile the exchange goes down, Ordell keeps himself far away from the eyes of the A.T.F. by going to a strip club. The same bar, Sam’s Hofbrau, a real topless bar, would appear again in Tarantino’s “Kill Bill: Vol. 2,” where Budd works as a bouncer.\n\nLOCATION: 1751 E Olympic Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90021\n\nLate in the film, Max meets up with the very angry and suspicious Ordell, over at Raynelle’s house. This is right around the corner from Beaumont’s apartment location.\n\nLOCATION: 348 E Opp St, Wilmington, CA 90744\n\nRelated articles: Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), Kill Bill (2003), Django Unchained (2012), Once Upon A Time In… Hollywood (2019)\n\nThe 1992 Quentin Tarantino film “Reservoir Dogs,” like much of his work, was filmed around Los Angeles, California, with many of the locations found in close proximity to one another around the Eagle Rock neighborhood of East L.A. The opening restaurant scene, which establishes all of the characters, was filmed at Pat And Lorraine’s in Eagle Rock. The restaurant is still alive and well and more or less looks the same as when it appeared in the film.\n\nLOCATION: 4720 Eagle Rock Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90041\n\nHere is the general area where the guys sat. The circular table was added by the production.\n\nThe restaurant is very welcoming to fans of the film and has a still photo from the movie on their wall.\n\nThey also have a poster for the film on another wall.\n\nThe parking lot where the cast walks in the opening credits does still exist. However, the brick wall is no more. It is part of a bowling alley and has been remodeled a bit. This is what the wall looks like now, in the approximate area where the cast walked.\n\nWhat can be matched up better is the ending shot of the opening credits sequence. The buildings across the street still appear identical. However, a fence and gate have since been added along the street.\n\nLOCATION: 4459 Eagle Rock Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90041\n\nThe most famous location from the film was the warehouse where the men rendezvous after the heist. The majority of the film takes place there, but sadly, it no longer exists. The property was formerly a mortuary, which was incorporated into the production design, with upright caskets visible and a hearse under a tarp. The area where Mr. White, played by Harvey Keitel, talks to Mr. Pink, played by Steve Buscemi, was intended to look like an embalming room.\n\nOnce located at 59th Ave and Figueroa St in Highland Park, the building sustained damage from an earthquake and was later demolished. The apartment of Mr. Orange, played by Tim Roth, was also located above the warehouse in the same building, so that too is gone. Here is what the area looks like today, with a different building and parking lot now occupying the space.\n\nLOCATION: 5860 N Figueroa St, Los Angeles, CA 90042 (now demolished)\n\nOne element from the original film can still be matched up at the location. This building across from the parking lot can be seen as Mr. White first brings Mr. Orange into the warehouse. It can be seen again as Mr. Blonde walks to his car outside.\n\nThe film cuts in non-linear form to a jewelry store robbery gone wrong. Mr. Pink is seen running along the north side of York Blvd, with police chasing close behind him.\n\nLOCATION: 5025 York Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90042\n\nHe drops his briefcase right in this area, then picks it up and continues running.\n\nIn a bit of movie magic, Mr. Pink suddenly switches sides of the street, running on the south side of York Blvd to the intersection of N Avenue 50, where a car hits him. In reality, he would’ve been running back the direction he began. In the film, a gas station is seen at the intersection, but it is now a small park.\n\nLOCATION: Intersection of N Avenue 50 and York Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90042 (nearest address is 5000 York Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90042)\n\nThe police catch up and Mr. Pink opens fire on them at this same corner. Mr. Pink is standing on N Avenue 50, firing towards York Blvd.\n\nMr. Pink escapes by vehicle up N Avenue 50, with a cop shooting at him from behind in the intersection. Overall, while this area has changed some since filming, a lot of it is still recognizable from how it appeared in the film\n\nThe office of Joe, played by Lawrence Tierney, could be found in an upstairs office space at Chapman Market, located in Koreatown. There’s a few different second floor sections of the plaza, but here’s a look at the general area. The office is of course only seen from interior views in the film.\n\nLOCATION: 3465 W 6th St, Los Angeles, CA 90020\n\nThe restaurant where Mr. Orange tells another officer all of the intel he’s collected is Johnie’s Coffee Shop Restaurant in midtown Los Angeles. The restaurant closed many years ago, but still operates as a filming location. It has appeared in “The Big Lebowski,” “American History X,” “Miracle Mile,” “Gone in Sixty Seconds” and many more.\n\nLOCATION: 6099 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90048\n\nMr. Orange rehearses “the commode story,” about being stuck in side a bathroom with a group of police officers and an aggressive dog, while in possession of drugs. Several locations appear as he rehearses and then tells the story. He is first seen rehearsing on the rooftop of this building in Hollywood, with the top of the Hollywood First National Bank Building visible behind him (which itself also appears in the films “The Nice Guys” and “Twins“). The roof area has changed a bit since filming took place.\n\nLOCATION: 6751 Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028\n\nHe continues telling the story in front of a graffiti covered wall. This was a platform that was part of the city’s original metro train line. The area has since been cleaned up and the structure seen in the film still stands. However, it is now located in the rear courtyard of an apartment complex named Belmont Station Apartments and can be seen from the street facing S Toluca St. The same location appears in such films “The Running Man,” “Colors,” “Predator 2,” “Point of No Return,” “The Replacement Killers” “The One” and more. It also appeared in the television series “V.”\n\nLOCATION: 1304 W 2nd St, Los Angeles, CA 90026 (facing S Toluca St)\n\nThe scene then jumps to Mr. Orange actually telling Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White the story inside a club. These scenes were filmed inside a former club located in North Hollywood. While the building is still there, the interior is now completely changed from how it appeared in the film. The same building appeared in the TV show “Pam & Tommy.”\n\nLOCATION: 4923 Lankershim Blvd, North Hollywood, CA 91601\n\nFinally, the scene ends up with the rehearsed scenario actually playing out inside a bathroom. This was filmed in the men’s bathroom on the ground floor of the MacArthur, formerly known as the Park Plaza Hotel. No longer a functioning hotel, the MacArthur today serves primarily as a property for hosting filming and special events. David Lynch’s “Wild At Heart” and the Coen Brothers’ “Barton Fink” also filmed in this exact restroom, which as since been remodeled a bit, but remains largely recognizable.\n\nLOCATION: 607 S Park View St, Los Angeles, CA 90057\n\nMr. Orange leaves his apartment and gets in a car with Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink at the intersection of S Ave 59 and Figueroa St. This is accurate to where his apartment was formerly located, just out of frame to the left.\n\nLOCATION: S Ave 59 / Figueroa St, Los Angeles, CA 90042\n\nThe jewelry store exterior can be found in Burbank. Mr. White and Mr. Orange go over the robbery plans as they are parked outside.\n\nLOCATION: 2612 W Burbank Blvd, Burbank, CA 91505\n\nMr. Brown, played by Quentin Tarantino, crashes his car in this alley. It is located near Marmion Way, but it’s actually at the intersection of two unnamed alleys. We’ve provides the exact GPS coordinates below.\n\nLOCATION: GPS coordinates: 34.109187, -118.195118, near 5522 1/2 Marmion Way, Los Angeles, CA 90042\n\nThis house can be seen in the background behind the crashed car.\n\nAs the police arrive, Mr. White opens fire on them from here, with this building visible behind him.\n\nMr. White and Mr. Orange walk up the alley toward Marmion Way.\n\nThey hijack a car right where the alley meets Marmion Way. While not obvious in the film, in person it is very noticeable that the lanes of the road are split down the center by a railway track, so the car in the scene would’ve been driving along the wrong side of the street. We’ve again provided exact GPS coordinates, as it can be slightly confusing if you don’t know the area.\n\nLOCATION: GPS coordinates: 34.109680, -118.195474, near 5522 Marmion Way, Los Angeles, CA 90042\n\nTo see our “Reservoir Dogs” location page, click here.\n\nRelated articles: Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill (2003), Django Unchained (2012), Once Upon A Time In… Hollywood (2019)\n\nOne of the most critically acclaimed films of the 1990s, Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction,” was shot in Southern California. The restaurant that opens and closes the film was the Hawthorne Grill in Hawthorne, California. Unfortunately, the restaurant closed in 1996 and is now an AutoZone.\n\nLOCATION: 13763 Hawthorne Blvd, Hawthorne, CA 90250 (demolished)\n\nButch discusses throwing a boxing fight with Marsellus Wallace at Starz, a former strip club in Gardena. This location was identified by Rayen Belchere after he spoke with the former management, who confirmed the club was used in the film. The location is only seen from interior views in the film, but photography was not permitted inside and the club has since permanently closed. Here is what the exterior looked like.\n\nLOCATION: 2528 Rosecrans Ave, Gardena, CA 90249\n\nVincent Vega takes Mia Wallace to the memorable “Jack Rabbit Slims,” which is not a real restaurant. The interiors were built on a studio stage. However, the exterior is in fact a real place, albeit not a restaurant. Located in Glendale, California, the building was originally a bowling alley called Grand Central Bowl, which has long since closed. Today, the building is owned by The Walt Disney Company, which owned Miramax, the company which released “Pulp Fiction.” The building is part of Disney’s larger Grand Central Business Center, which consists of numerous buildings in the area used as business offices. The building is actually tucked away behind a wall and fencing, but the wall is not very tall and it’s easy to get a view over top of it. What is not so easily accomplished is getting a closer view of the building. The property is only open to business staff, so the closest the public can get is the sidewalk.\n\nLOCATION: 1435 Flower St, Glendale, CA 91201\n\nVincent Vega pays a visit to his friend Lance, played by Eric Stoltz, early in the film, in order to purchase some heroin. After Mia Wallace mistakes Vega’s heroin for cocaine, she overdoses and is rushed to this house in the Atwater Village neighborhood of Los Angeles, for a very tense scene in which they give her an adrenaline shot.\n\nLOCATION: 3519 La Clede Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90039\n\nThe building where Butch’s boxing match takes place can be found in Pasadena. The marquee has since been changed. The same building was also used in “This is Spinal Tap.”\n\nLOCATION: 129 N Raymond Ave, Pasadena, CA 91103\n\nLater in the film, after Butch has double-crossed Marsellus Wallace, he sneaks back to his apartment, located in North Hollywood, to retrieve his gold watch.\n\nLOCATION: 11813 Runnymede St, North Hollywood, CA 91605\n\nAfter a violent confrontation at his apartment, Butch is leisurely driving away, when a chance encounter with Marsellus occurs at this intersection of Fletcher Dr. and Atwater Ave., also located in Atwater Village. Butch is facing NW on Atwater Ave. when he spots Marsellus crossing Fletcher Dr.\n\nLOCATION: Intersection of Atwater Ave. / Fletcher Dr., Los Angeles, CA 90039\n\nButch quickly floors it and hits Marsellus, before getting in a car collision in the intersection. Marsellus awakens and begins firing his gun at Butch, when a bystander is hit in front of Fosters Freeze, which is at the same intersection. Forsters Freeze was also featured on the television show “GLOW.”\n\nLOCATION: 2760 Fletcher Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90039\n\nMarsellus chases Butch on foot SW down Fletcher Dr. from the same intersection.\n\nLOCATION: Fletcher Dr., just past Atwater Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90039\n\nMarsellus fires one last shot in the distance at Butch, who is standing at the corner of this building in Canoga Park. This location is far away from the earlier shots in Atwater Villiage. It is actually the corner alley next to the Zed’s Pawn Shop, in which both characters make a grave mistake in entering.\n\nLOCATION: The alley left of Crown Pawn Shop at 20933 Roscoe Blvd, Canoga Park, CA 91304\n\nZed’s Pawn Shop is where things take a bizarre, ugly turn for Butch and Marsellus. The real building actually is a pawn shop.\n\nLOCATION: 20933 Roscoe Blvd, Canoga Park, CA 91304\n\nThe motel where Butch and Fabienne stay was demolished in 1996. Formerly known as the River Glen Motel, this building now stands in it’s place. Only the exteriors were used in the film. The interior of the motel was a set, albeit designed to resemble the River Glen Motel rooms.\n\nLOCATION: 2934 Riverside Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90039 (now demolished)\n\nWhat can be better lined up at the location is the view down Riverside Drive, seen as the couple leaves the motel on a chopper. Everything here still matches how it appeared in the film, with the Glendale-Hyperion Bridge visible in the distance. The same bridge was seen in the film “Who Framed Roger Rabbit?”\n\nNear the end of the film, Jules and Vincent find themselves in “The Bonnie Indecent,” in which they are in sudden, urgent need of getting rid of a body. They arrive here at Jimmy’s house, played by Quentin Tarantino. It is here they meet “The Wolf,” played by Harvey Keitel.\n\nLOCATION: 4145 Kraft Ave, Studio City, CA 91604\n\nThe site of Monster Joe’s Truck and Tow can be found in Sun Valley. The area has changed some since filming took place.\n\nLOCATION: 12143 Branford St, Sun Valley, CA 91352\n\nRelated articles: Reservoir Dogs (1992), Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill (2003), Django Unchained (2012), Once Upon A Time In… Hollywood (2019)\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s revenge drama “Kill Bill,” was shot around California, China, Japan and Mexico. Here we will cover locations from both volumes of the film.\n\nThe “Two Pines Wedding Chapel,” supposedly located in El Paso, Texas, is actually in the Mojave Desert in Lancaster, California. First called the “Hi Vista Community Hall,” the building served as a community center and did not originally feature the Spanish style front facade, which is so recognizable today. The Mission-style facade was actually added by another film production, 1981’s “True Confessions,” starring Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall. The building also later featured in Talking Heads’ music video for “Road To Nowhere.” The building wasn’t widely known, however, until “Kill Bill.” Tarantino’s production team added the wooden porch on the front and heavily remodeled the interiors. Sometimes known as the Sanctuary Adventist Church, most people today just refer to the building as the “Kill Bill Church.” It’s location is a bit remote, being out in the middle of the desert, but well worth a visit if you’re a fan of the film. The owner now keeps a truck parked out front, however, blocking much of the view of the front. According to comments online, some have stated he will move the truck in exchange for a “donation.” We did not encounter any issues during our visit, but some have expressed negative experiences in attempting to photograph it.\n\nLOCATION: Approximately 19809 E Ave. G, Lancaster, CA, 93535 (near the corner of 198th St E)\n\nEarl McGraw, played by Michael Parks, arrives at the church much in the same way he does (as the same character) in the opening of “From Dusk Till Dawn,” also written by Tarantino. The two locations are, in fact, just minutes apart from each other. Also located almost directly across the street from the church is the gas station from the end of the film “Straight Time.”\n\nThe Bride’s “Death List Five” brings her to the house of Vernita Green, which is set in “The city of Pasadena, California.” The real house is near South Pasadena, but actually located in East Los Angeles. The house can also be seen in the 2003 “Project Greenlight” film, “The Battle Of Shaker Heights” and “Mysterious Skin.”\n\nLOCATION: 5500 Atlas St, Los Angeles, CA 90032\n\nAfter The Bride ends up in a coma, Elle Driver, played by Daryl Hannah, comes to the hospital to kill her. Elle is briefly seen entering St Luke’s Hospital at this entrance, which has since been boarded over. The same hospital appeared in the films “Million Dollar Baby,” “Flags of Our Fathers,” “La La Land,” “Faster,” “Starsky & Hutch,” “Halloween II” (1981) and more.\n\nLOCATION: 2632 E Washington Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91107\n\nAfter waking up from her coma and escaping the hospital, The Bride makes her out into the hospital parking garage on a wheelchair, where she finds her “Pussy Wagon” truck. The real garage building is not a hospital, rather an apartment complex known as the American Cement Building, located near MacArthur Park. The bride wheels past this P2 marker, placing her on the second floor of the garage.\n\nLOCATION: 2404 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90057\n\nHere is the spot she finds the Pussy Wagon parked. It can be found by walking straight ahead from the above spot, up on the left. There is another P2 sign, which can be seen in the background behind The Bride as she spots the truck, which lines up the exact area where the vehicle was parked. The garage is open to public parking (via paid parking) on weekdays, but it is gated off for private residents only on weekends. There is also a lot of security present around the building and garage.\n\nThe Bride drives her Kawasaki bike along the streets of Tokyo, riding behind Sofie Fatale’s car down Yasukuni Dori. It’s difficult to replicate the exact angles, as they were filmed by cameras mounted on moving vehicles in the middle of the street in a high traffic area. The shots are also mostly quick cuts against moving backgrounds. Here are a couple views of the general area used in the sequence. First up is a shot looking down Yasukuni Dori at night.\n\nLOCATION: Yasukuni Dori, Shinjuku-ku, Tōkyō-to, 160-0022, Japan\n\nHere is another view of the same street in the day, which is near Kabukicho, a red-light district of Tokyo where parts of Gaspar Noé’s “Enter The Void” were also filmed.\n\nAfter a few shots in Tokyo, The Bride pulls up beside Sofie at this tunnel entrance, which is actually in Los Angeles at the Second Street Tunnel. The tunnel is also well known for it’s use in “Blade Runner,” “The Terminator,” “Double Dragon” and many more films.\n\nLOCATION: 620 W 2nd St, Los Angeles, CA 90012 (facing S Figueroa St.)\n\nBudd, played by Michael Madsen, lives in a remote trailer on a dirt road near Barstow. At the base of these hills toward the right is where Budd’s trailer sat. Mule Canyon Road is a popular site for off road vehicles. While you may be able to reach it in a regular vehicle (this site is about 1 mile down from the nearest paved road), we recommend a 4×4 vehicle or at least something that doesn’t sit low to the ground, as there are many rocks and dips along the way. Also keep in mind this area gets very hot in the summer months.\n\nLOCATION: Mule Canyon Rd, Newberry Springs, CA 92365 (GPS coordinates are 34.936439, -116.837655)\n\nThe area to the right is where Bill parks his car, with these rock formations in the background. This is located in the same general vicinity as Budd’s trailer.\n\nLooking back towards Calico Rd is the view where Elle Driver races down the road with a dust trail kicking up behind her. This is also in the same general area as Budd’s trailer.\n\nThe interior of the bar where Budd works is Sam’s Hofbrau, a real topless bar, also featured in “Jackie Brown.”\n\nLOCATION: 1751 E Olympic Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90021\n\nAfter The Bride escapes being buried alive, she wonders into this roadside diner in Victorville.\n\nLOCATION: 17143 N D St, Victorville, CA 92394\n\nHere is the exterior of the diner, although it is never seen from this angle in the film.\n\nRelated articles: Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), Django Unchained (2012), Once Upon A Time In… Hollywood (2019)"
