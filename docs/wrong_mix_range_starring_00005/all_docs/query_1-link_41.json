        "text": "A dark open road. Glitchy spectral music. One spoken word: “Really?” That’s how the latest teaser for the upcoming revival of Twin Peaks, released Thursday, goes—serving more of an aesthetic vibe than curiosity-quenching plot details. (How very Twin Peaks of it.) However, the clip does offer a new glimpse of some of the show’s most iconic characters—without telling us much of what they’re up to.\n\nF.B.I. Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) is back in action looking afraid, very afraid. We also get glimpses of characters like Big Ed Hurley (Everett McGill), Carl Rodd (Harry Dean Stanton), Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz), and Deputy Tommy \"Hawk\" Hill (Michael Horse), as well as Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie), mother of Laura—surreptitiously strolling down the liquor aisle of a grocery store.\n\nHowever, one character from this particular force is missing. Michael Ontkean, who played the memorably named Sheriff Harry S. Truman on the original Twin Peaks, does not appear in the trailer, as he’s retired and has no plans to return to show business. There were rumblings that Robert Forster would be tapped to replace Ontkean, and the actor was later added to the cast of Showtime’s revival, though his role wasn’t specified. Forster was supposed to appear in the original series as well, but he ended up getting tangled up in a pilot that never went anywhere. The actor did eventually work with David Lynch, appearing in the modern classic Mulholland Drive, so this new series is something of a mini reunion for them.\n\nIn addition to Forster, there are plenty of other new stars joining the cast this season that aren’t featured in the new teaser. The expanded Twin Peaks world includes actors like Ashley Judd, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Michael Cera, as well as frequent Lynchian collaborators Naomi Watts and Laura Dern. Here’s hoping we get a fresh glimpse of ’em soon. The Twin Peaks revival will air on May 21.\n\nThe 15 Best New TV Characters of 2016\n\n1 / 15\n\nDamn Good Coffee\n\nLaura Dern Spills Details About Twin Peaks Revival: “It’s Brave and Fiery”\n\nWith parts in the David Lynch series and the next Star Wars, 2017 might be Dern’s busiest yet.\n\nMAGA\n\n2017’s Hottest Shows Question Whether America Was Ever Great at All\n\nWhat Riverdale and Twin Peaks tell us about Trump’s famous campaign slogan.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Ser Simon Strong Is “The Only Gentleman in an Ungentlemanly World”\n\nAs violence abounds in Westeros, Rhaenyra arranges a secret meeting with Alicent and tries to broker some kind of peace.
