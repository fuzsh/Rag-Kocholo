Written, directed and produced by Tyler Perry, the film features an ensemble cast which includes Janet Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, Phylicia Rashad, Thandiwe Newton, Loretta Devine, Anika Noni Rose, Tessa Thompson, Kimberly Elise, Kerry Washington, and Macy Gray.\n\nThe film depicts the interconnected lives of ten black women, exploring their lives and struggles as women of color.[4][5] It is the first film to be produced by 34th Street Films, an imprint of Tyler Perry Studios, and distributed by Lionsgate Films. It is also the first R-rated film directed by Perry. With a budget of $21 million, For Colored Girls was released on November 5, 2010, grossing $20.1 million in its opening weekend.\n\nThe film's lead cast consists of ten women of color, seven of whom are based on the play's seven characters, only known by colour (e.g. \"lady in red\", \"lady in brown\", and \"lady in yellow\"). Like its source material, each character deals with a different personal conflict, such as love, abandonment, rape, infidelity, and abortion.\n\nIn New York, a group of black women, most of whom live in the same Harlem apartment building, faces personal crises, heartbreak and other challenges. Crystal (Kimberly Elise) faces an unhappy existence as an abused lover. Jo (Janet Jackson) is a successful magazine editor, but her husband has a secret double life. Juanita (Loretta Devine) is a relationship counselor but cannot seem to get her love life in order. These three and others become bound together by their experiences.\n\nJanet Jackson as Joanna \"Jo\" Bradmore (\"Lady in Red\")\n\nThandiwe Newton as Tangie Adrose (\"Lady in Orange\") (as Thandie Newton)\n\nAnika Noni Rose as Yasmine (\"Lady in Yellow\")\n\nLoretta Devine as Juanita Sims (\"Lady in Green\")\n\nKerry Washington as Kelly Watkins (\"Lady in Blue\")\n\nTessa Thompson as Nyla Adrose (\"Lady in Purple\")\n\nKimberly Elise as Crystal Wallace (\"Lady in Brown\")\n\nWhoopi Goldberg as Alice Adrose (\"Lady in White\")\n\nPhylicia Rashad as Gilda (\"Lady in Black\")\n\nMacy Gray as Rose (\"Lady in Pink\")\n\nMichael Ealy as Beau Willie Brown\n\nOmari Hardwick as Carl Bradmore\n\nHill Harper as Donald Watkins\n\nKhalil Kain as Bill\n\nRichard Lawson as Frank\n\nOn September 3, 2009, Lionsgate announced it had acquired the distribution rights to Tyler Perry's 34th Street Films adaptation of the play, with principal photography originally scheduled to take place in Atlanta, Georgia in November and December 2009, with a planned 2010 release.[6] The film was written, directed, and produced by Perry. The cast includes Loretta Devine, Kimberly Elise, Whoopi Goldberg, Janet Jackson, Phylicia Rashad, Anika Noni Rose, Kerry Washington, Thandiwe Newton, and Tessa Thompson.[7] Mariah Carey had also been cast, but pulled out in May 2010, citing medical reasons (later revealed to be her pregnancy); Thandiwe Newton was cast to replace her. Macy Gray was also cast.[8]\n\nOriginally using the play's full title, the film's title was shortened to For Colored Girls in September 2010.[9] In an October 2010 press conference with the cast, Perry credited his full body of work for being able to make the film, stating, \"It took everything—Madea, House of Payne and all of that—for me to be able to do For Colored Girls. Had none of that happened I wouldn't have been able to say, 'Listen, this is what I want to do next,' so I’m very proud of it all.\"[10]\n\nWhen asked if she held reservations about Perry's adaptation of her work, Shange responded: \"I had a lot of qualms. I worried about his characterizations of women as plastic.\"[11] In reference to the film post-production, she stated, \"I think he did a very fine job, although I'm not sure I would call it a finished film.\"[11]\n\nFor Colored Girls: Music From and Inspired by the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on November 2, 2010. It features music from the cast, as well as Leona Lewis and Nina Simone.\n\nThe film was originally planned for a 2010 release, but was later delayed until January 14, 2011.[12] However, the studio chose to move the release date forward to November 5, 2010; Tyler Perry commented it was \"a serious film that really lends itself to the Fall period.\"[13] Grossing $20.1 million in its opening weekend, For Colored Girls debuted at the box office at #3, behind Megamind ($47.7 million) and Due Date ($33.5 million).[14]\n\nOn Metacritic the film received a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on 33 reviews, which indicates \"mixed or average reviews\".[15] On Rotten Tomatoes 32% of 109 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.20/10. The site's consensus is that \"Tyler Perry has assembled a fine cast for this adaptation of the 1975 play, and his heart is obviously in the right place, but his fondness for melodrama cheapens a meaningful story\".[16] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it a grade \"A\" on a scale from A+ to F.[17]\n\nEarly reviews from a private screening by Variety and The Hollywood Reporter were negative. Peter DeBruge of Variety stated that \"[i]n adapting Ntozake Shange's Tony-nominated play—a cycle of poetic monologues about abuse, abortion and other issues facing modern black women, rather than a traditional narrative—the do-it-all auteur demonstrates an ambition beyond any of his previous work. And yet the result falls squarely in familiar territory, better acted and better lit, perhaps, but more inauthentically melodramatic than ever.\" Despite an overall negative view of the film's plot and direction, DeBruge gives praise to the acting of its principal cast.[18]\n\nKirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter highlighted the difficulty in translating Shange's poetic play to film. He commented: \"No, it never was going to be easy, but someone needed to put creative sweat into this one, to reach for cinematic solutions to the theatrical challenge. All Perry does is force conventional plots and characters—utter cliches without lives or souls—into the fabric of Shange's literary work. The hackneyed melodramas get him from one poem to the next but run roughshod over the collective sense of who these women are.\"[19] Honeycutt acknowledged the talents of the film's actresses, highlighting performances by Phylicia Rashad, Anika Noni Rose, and Kimberly Elise.[19]\n\nCritic Marshall Fine gave a negative review in The Huffington Post. He asserts Perry's screenplay is inadequate for its source material, stating that each character \"gets the opportunity to suddenly burst into Shange's poetic arias. But the connective tissue that links the various stories ... amounts to a college course in black social pathology—or perhaps just human pathology.\"[20] Acknowledging the acting talent of the ensemble cast, he states: \"Don't get me wrong. The women of this film all shine, hitting strong emotional notes that ring true even when Perry's adaptation feels false ... So let's just say that For Colored Girls is a barely competent film (which is a big step up for Perry), illuminated by luminous performances.\"[20]\n\nLisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly comments: \"The female cast is great, with especially fierce performances from Loretta Devine, Kimberly Elise, Phylicia Rashad, and Anika Noni Rose. But stuck in a flailing production that might just as well invite Perry's signature drag creation Madea to the block party, the actors' earnest work isn't enuf.\"[21]\n\nClaudia Puig of USA Today called the film a \"strained soap opera\" which \"has wrung the beauty and truth out of the original in almost every way possible.\"[22] Mary Pols of Time magazine states that despite the caliber of the cast, \"Elise's performance is the only restrained one in the film and her Crystal is For Colored Girls' most compelling character.\" She concludes that \"For Colored Girls feels like the cinematic equivalent to putting a garish reproduction of the Sistine Chapel on the ceiling of your McMansion and calling it art.\"[23]\n\nIn contrast, a review by Shadow and Act was favorable, calling For Colored Girls \"the best thing Perry has done to date.\" Perry is complimented on his cinematography, and use of \"subtlety and nuance\", although his screenwriting is still considered to be the weakest aspect of the film. Like previous reviews, praise is given to the acting quality of the cast, especially regarding performances given by Thandiwe Newton, Janet Jackson, and Kimberly Elise.[24] The Huffington Post journalist Jenee Darden gave a mixed review. She comments that Perry's modern plot conflicts with the narrative of Shange's poetry which was written during the 1970s, explaining: \"The film is set in the present and black people don't use the word 'colored' anymore. Watching a character type on a laptop then hearing someone describe themselves as 'colored' a few scenes later doesn't feel realistic.\"[25]\n\nShe commends the acting of the cast, stating \"Kimberly Elise stirs you as always. Loretta Devine is funny and vivid. Thandie Newton delivers as a troubled, selfish sex addict. She and Whoopi were matched perfectly as a mother and daughter with serious tensions. Singer Macy Gray's eerie portrayal of a back-alley abortionist will make you rethink ever having unsafe sex.\"[25] Roger Ebert comments that \"Shange's award-winning play is justly respected, but I'm not sure it’s filmmable, and I’m pretty sure it wasn't a wise choice for Perry ... That’s not to say 'For Colored Girls' doesn't have its virtues. Seeing these actresses together is a poignant reminder of their gifts, and of the absence of interesting roles for actresses in general and African-American ones in particular.\"[26]\n\nBetsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times gave a positive review, stating that \"[w]ith a surgical precision, the writer-director cut [Shange's poetry] apart and reassembled it, using various pieces to create characters and storylines, keeping much of the poetry, writing the connective tissue himself so that it finds a new life, a somewhat different life on screen,\" and said it is his most \"mature\" film to-date. Commenting on the acting of the ensemble cast, she states: \"Newton's Tangie swings too wildly; Goldberg's Alice, clad in white and rage, never finds traction; and Rashad, as the apartment manager Gilda, the central link between many of the characters, never quite connects, so it often feels as if she's walked onto the wrong stage\" but adds that \"[w]hatever stumbles there may be, they are offset by moments when 'For Colored Girls' soars,\" ultimately describing the film as \"unforgettable.\"[27]\n\nMick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle called For Colored Girls \"a serious achievement.\"[28] He compliments Perry's work, stating \"this new film shows a mastery of tone, a capacity to elicit strong performances and also to bring out different colors within those performances so that, when it all comes together, it's not the same note sounding over and over. This is smart, lovely work.\"[28] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film \"a thunderous storm of a movie.\" Dargis states that \"working with fine performers like Ms. Elise, Anika Noni Rose, Phylicia Rashad and Kerry Washington, he sings the song the way he likes it—with force, feeling and tremendous sincerity.\"[29]\n\nMatt Zoller Seitz of Salon.com calls For Colored Girls Perry's \"most problematic work. It's also his most ambitious.\"[30] He adds that \"Perry never solves the stage-to-screen translation problem. But the path he has chosen is as intriguing as it is irksome, and it works better than you might expect.\"[30] In terms of acting, he praises Jackson's performance, stating: \"[s]he outdoes herself here ... It's not just Jackson's short haircut and traumatized eyes that might remind viewers of Jane Wyman or Joan Crawford; Perry gets at the mix of masculine hyper-competitiveness and feminine vulnerability that has always defined Jackson, and links it to the wily, lonely coldness often captured in Wyman and Crawford performances, a directorial gambit of tremendous perceptiveness.\"[30] In addition, he says Perry \"is just as sharp directing Jackson's costars—especially Elise, Rashad and Devine.\"[30]\n\nFor Colored Girls has received accolades primarily from African American film and critic associations, in multiple categories including acting, writing, directing and overall production. Kimberly Elise has received the most acting nomination among the cast, followed by Anika Noni Rose and Phylicia Rashad.\n\nAward Date of ceremony Category Recipient(s) Result African-American Film Critics Association[31] December 13, 2010 Best Picture For Colored Girls Nominated Best Song Nina Simone Won Best Supporting Actor Michael Ealy Won Best Supporting Actress Kimberly Elise Won Black Reel Awards[32][33] February 13, 2011 Outstanding Actress Kimberly Elise Nominated Thandiwe Newton Nominated Anika Noni Rose Nominated Outstanding Breakthrough Performance Omari Hardwick Nominated Tessa Thompson Won Outstanding Director Tyler Perry Nominated Outstanding Film For Colored Girls Nominated Outstanding Ensemble For Colored Girls Won Outstanding Original Score Aaron Zigman Nominated Outstanding Original Song Leona Lewis Nominated Outstanding Screenplay, Original or Adapted Tyler Perry Nominated Outstanding Supporting Actress Janet Jackson Nominated Phylicia Rashad Won Kerry Washington Nominated Heartland Truly Moving Pictures[34] 2010 Truly Moving Film For Colored Girls Won NAACP Image Awards[35] March 4, 2011 Outstanding Directing for a Motion Picture/Television Movie Tyler Perry Won Outstanding Motion Picture For Colored Girls Won Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture Michael Ealy Nominated Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture Kimberly Elise Won Whoopi Goldberg Nominated Phylicia Rashad Nominated Anika Noni Rose Nominated\n\nList of black films of the 2010s"
