        "text": "Synopsis\n\nGet ready to sing and dance, laugh and love once again! Ten years after Mamma Mia! the film that has grossed over 600 million dollars worldwide, you are invited to return to the magical Greek island of Kalokairi, in a new and original musical based on the ABBA’s songs. The film marks the return of the original cast flanked by new members, among them actress Lily James (Darkest Hour, Cinderella). Reprising their roles of the previous installment, Academy winner actress Meryl Streep as Donna; Julie Walters as Rosie, and Christine Baranski as Tanya. Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper will once again be Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Academy Award Winner Colin Firth, resume their roles as Sophie’s three prospective fathers: Sam, Bill and Harry. In the movie, while traveling back and forth in time to show how the relationship forged in the past have an influence on the present, we see Lily James as a young Donna. Rosie and Tanya’s younger selves are portrayed by Alexa Davies (X+Y - A Brilliant Young Mind), and Jessica Keenan Wynn (Broadway’s Beautiful). Jeremy Irvine (War Horse) will be the young version of Sam, while young Bill will be Josh Dylan (Allied) and young Harry will be portrayed by Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends)."
