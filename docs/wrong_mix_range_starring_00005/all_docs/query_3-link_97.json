Make a token out of your Oyster card by lending it to someone and saying it’s an all-expenses-paid shopping trip, apart from the shopping. When the journey comes up on your statement, phone the train people, say it was stolen and cry. 'Travolator' skiingWinter sports aren’t only for posh people with sunglasses that make them look like robots. At Bank station, there’s an automatic ski slope that won’t cost you a penny. It’s this whole moving floor called a ‘travolator’, which is from the word ‘travol’, meaning ‘always open the wrong way’. Make yourself a DIY pair of those long foot things that skiers wear – whatever they’re called – out of a couple of stripy barriers that have been knocked off some roadworks. And for après ski (which is Swiss for ‘after yoghurt’) there’s a miniature shop on the platform that does three different sorts of Frijj. Luxury. Cooking for free Cooking a roast dinner costs loads in electricity. But if you leave your turkey on the top deck of a new Routemaster bus, the revolutionary air circulation system that doesn’t work should have it cooked in a matter of days, provided nobody nicks it and that you can get on the bus without your Oyster that you lent to that person you didn’t like.

But British Film Institute (BFI) members are able to book a week earlier, from 10am on Thursday September 10. Should I become a BFI member then?Tickets for BFI members go on sale at 10am on Thursday September 10 – meaning that BFI members are able to buy tickets for the LFF a week earlier than everyone else. It costs £45 to be a member (see www.bfi.org.uk/join), so you’ll have to weigh up whether the benefits of BFI membership (including priority booking at BFI Southbank all year round and no booking fees when buying tickets for the festival or at BFI Southbank) are worth it. How much do LFF screenings cost?Daytime screenings (5pm and earlier) at all venues cost £9. Evening screenings cost between £12.75 and £16. Gala screenings are more expensive and cost between £20 and £38. Where do the films screen?The majority of the films screen either in Leicester Square (mostly at the Vue West End and Odeon West End, although there are lots of screenings at Curzon Soho, Cineworld Haymarket and the new Picturehouse Central) or at BFI Southbank. But many other venues take part too, including the ICA, Hackney Picturehouse and Ritzy in Brixton. Do films sell out?Many screenings sell out quickly. But remember that the festiva\n\nIn November 1969, a 26-year-old Catholic nun disappeared in Baltimore. Sister Cathy Cesnik, a beloved English and Drama teacher, vanished while shopping for an engagement present for her sister. Two months later, in January 1970, her body was found on a frozen rubbish dump, her skull bashed in. Who killed Sister Cathy? That’s the question asked in ‘The Keepers’, Netflix’s new long-form documentary series. It’s been called ‘the new “Making a Murderer”’. But while it also examines a real-life cold case – Sister Cathy’s murderer has never been brought to justice – what’s different here is the focus. After watching the first three episodes what shines through is the courage of a group of women, many of them victims of abuse, who would not shut up, go away or play nice. Netflix In the first episode we meet two of Sister Cathy’s former pupils, Gemma Hoskins and Abbie Schaub. Now retired and in their 60s, for the past ten years this pair of retired Nancy Drews have been investigating what happened to their favourite teacher. They are adorable, a real chalk-and-cheese pair. Abbie is the researcher, sniffing out long forgotten clues on her computer; Gemma is more social and could sweet talk blood out of a stone. But don’t mess with these women – they are formidable, and what started as a hobby has become their life’s work. The pair are also examining the murder of another young woman, 20-year-old Joyce Malecki, who disappeared the same week as Sister Cathy. In episode two the focus\n\nA picnic and prosecco in Somerset House’s courtyard is already pretty unforgettable. Add a movie and you’re basically living the dream.

The 83-year-old British actress is most famous for appearing as Alexis Colby in ’80s TV series ‘Dynasty’, but appeared in a duo of erotic films in the ’70s. ‘The Stud’ and ‘The Bitch’ were based on books by Joan’s sister Jackie, and follow a nymphomaniac club owner who blackmails her club manager into satisfying her needs. In the films, Joan appears topless on a swing and having sex in a lift. The movies were hugely popular, and the ‘Fifty Shades’ of their day. Talking to us for Tuesday’s issue of Time Out, Joan explained that, even 30 years since they were made, she thinks the two films remain more erotic than EL James’s series. Joan says: ‘[‘Fifty Shades of Grey’] is the most boring film I’ve ever seen. I couldn’t go to sleep the other night, I was jet-lagged, so I was flicking [channels] and I thought: Oh, I’ll watch that, and I thought: This is really dull.’ She adds: ‘Ours were more titillating. It wasn’t in your face, if you know what I mean.’ Joan goes on to explain that she believes TV and film characters are less charismatic now than in the ’70s and ’80s. ‘Everyone in “Dynasty” is really interesting and charismatic,’ she says. ‘Compared to something I was watching on TV last night. It was supposed to be a “glam show” but I said: ‘I cannot believe how boring this is.’ The one thing you can say about “Dynasty” is that the people weren’t dull. Same with most shows from the same ti\n\nThe official title for the next Star Wars instalment was announced a few weeks ago... and it left us (and the rest of the internet) a little perplexed. What did 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' actually mean? '\"The Last Jedi\" throws up loads of questions, but that's part of the fun,' wrote our resident Star Wars expert at the time. You see, because Jedi is both the singular and plural form of the word, there was some confusion about just how many Jedi were being referred to in the title. Was Luke going to have to die, leaving Rey to be the titular final warrior? Or were Rey and Luke together the last Jedi? You could even throw a few more in there (Finn? Leia? A rescued-from-the-dark-side Kylo Ren?) and they could still collectively be 'the last Jedi'. But thanks to the release of the movie's foreign-language posters, the title finally makes a bit more sense. 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is definitely, officially plural. #StarWars: #LosÚltimosJedi, 15 de Diciembre en cines. pic.twitter.com/G5AF9yPccg — Star Wars España (@StarWarsSpain) February 17, 2017 Language experts have been quick to point out that this Spanish poster, and others like it, give the game away. It reads 'Los Ultimos Jedi', which refers to multiple Jedi. The poster would say 'El Ultimo Jedi' if there was just one left. Thank you Spanish... we now know that #jedi is plural. #LosUltimosJedi https://t.co/0afK9iifgk — Fr. Joseph Sund (@FatherSund) February 18, 2017 ITS CONFIRMED: The last Jedi is plural. MAY\n\nDon’t step foot inside a cinema until you’ve read our rules for watching the Fifty Shades franchise in public... 1. Go with an open mind This won’t work if you’re not in the right frame of mind. Know what you’re about to witness (here are ten things to expect ft. melodrama, nudity and sex in lifts) and know it’s likely to be completely and utterly ridiculous. 2. Loosen up A drink (or three) is likely to help. Just don’t go overboard – there were reports of drunken brawls in the aisles and inebriated women being escorted out of the theatre during ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’. 3. Don’t sit on the back row It’s long been the haunt of horny teenagers and handsy lovers. I once witnessed something I wish I hadn’t during a screening of ‘Bobby’, the 2006 movie about the assassination of Robert F Kennedy. I can only assume what goes on back there during ‘Fifty Shades’ screenings is much, much worse. 4. Don’t dress up There are certain movie franchises where it's okay, actively encouraged, even, to get into character. Who hasn’t proudly drawn a lightning bolt on their forehead with eyeliner at some point? The Fifty Shades films, however, do not fall into that category. Leave those cable ties at home, chaps. 5. Choose your companion wisely Sure, you have a close relationship with your mum but is it this close? Really? You’ve felt that awkward, breathless pause when an unexpected sex scene comes on the TV. This is 120 minutes of just that. Don’t do it. 6. Don’t eat snacks Especially those c\n\nThis Friday (January 20) is the day that Donald Trump, former star of reality TV competition 'The Apprentice', will become the forty-fifth President of the United States. However you feel about the result of the controversial US election, no-one can deny that it's a significant day in world history. If you'd rather pretend it's not happening, turn off the TV, take a break from social media and hide under your duvet for the day. If you want to watch along as president-elect Trump takes the Oath of Office and offers his inaugural address, here's how. 'President Trump: The Inauguration' will air on BBC1 and ITV between 4pm and 6pm. The BBC's coverage, led by Katty Kay, will follow the swearing-in ceremony, the inaugural address, and the presidential parade to the White House. ITV's programme is hosted by Tom Bradby, alongside Washington correspondent Robert Moore, who will be providing analysis. Sky News, BBC News channel and BBC Parliament will also be covering the event between 3pm and 7pm, while you will be able to watch a live stream of the swearing-in ceremony on the BBC and Sky news websites. Trump will officially become president at noon local time (5pm GMT) during a ceremony that is held at the White House. You can expect the cameras to follow Hillary Clinton, who lost out to Trump after a bitter election campaign. She will be there accompanying her husband, former president Bill Clinton. Outgoing president Obama is also expected to attend, though it's not compuls\n\nAny actor knows when they sign on to star in a big-budget movie that their face is likely to end up on pyjama sets, toys and lunchboxes (as Benedict Cumberbatch recently found out). But we wouldn't be surprised if Emma Watson was a little taken aback when she saw this piece of 'Beauty and the Beast' merchandise. Watson is playing Disney princess Belle in the new live-action remake and has been transformed into a plastic doll ahead of the movie's release. The result has caused quite a stir on social media, with fans saying the toy looks like more pop star Justin Bieber than the former Harry Potter actress... when you order an emma watson doll online but a justin bieber doll in a yellow dress & a wig arrives instead pic.twitter.com/PUQUBXyufT — rebekka (@dolanschistad) January 7, 2017 Why does Emma Watson's doll look like Justin Bieber 💀 pic.twitter.com/vHl9CmJ0nJ — I DON'T KNOW HER (@I_Dont_Know_Her) January 7, 2017 Hey @Disney , what's up with your @EmmaWatson doll?She looks like Justin Bieber. pic.twitter.com/vm8qqcDiI8 — BATMAN (@Batmancanseeyou) January 8, 2017 Okay but this doll looks like justin bieber and not Emma Watson pic.twitter.com/eVEX2oa9wp — MARVEL (@CHRIISEVANS) January 8, 2017 If you were ever worried about your job security, think about what's going through the mind of the guy in charge of this official Belle doll pic.twitter.com/H2wcWDeSPU — Ian Hecox (@SmoshIan) January 9, 2017 Some fans are distressed.

The 'Star Wars' actress passed away yesterday aged 60, four days after suffering a cardiac arrest on a flight to Los Angeles. Fisher was most well known for playing Star Wars's Princess Leia. She first took on the role in 1977, recently appearing in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. She will also star in upcoming movie 'Star Wars: Episode VIII', which wrapped earlier this year. Her death was confirmed by her family in a statement: 'It is with a very deep sadness that Billie Lourd confirms that her beloved mother Carrie Fisher passed away at 8.55 (16:55 GMT) this morning. She was loved by the world and she will be missed profoundly. Our entire family thanks you for your thoughts and prayers.' Her 'Star Wars' co-stars have been quick to pay tribute. 'Carrie was one-of-a-kind…brilliant, original,' Harrison Ford said in a statement to PEOPLE. 'Funny and emotionally fearless. She lived her life, bravely…My thoughts are with her daughter Billie, her mother Debbie, her brother Todd, and her many friends. We will all miss her.' While Mark Hamill posted a simple message on social media: no words #Devastated pic.twitter.com/R9Xo7IBKmh — Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) December 27, 2016 There are no words for this loss.

It’s not quite New Year’s Eve yet, and, no, you can’t be bothered to go for a walk. Don’t worry, there’s an impressive handful of movies on TV today to help you kill this much-needed downtime between Christmas and New Year – and all five of the films below are suitable for most of the family to watch (apart from very little ones). Labyrinth How better to remember David Bowie at Christmas (apart from re-enacting the video for ‘Dancing in the Streets’ with your gran) than watching Jim Henson’s bizarre, fun 1986 fantasy film in which Bowie plays the Goblin King and a young Jennifer Connelly plays a young girl trying to find her little brother in a mind-bending maze? Once you’ve watched it, you can waste some more time trying to recreate the costumes and hairstyles. 2pm, Channel 5. Home Alone Nothing says Christmas more than your family abandoning you at home at the mercy of a pair of burglars. But who can resist this modern Christmas classic that unfolds to the most American, most suburban seasonal backdrop imaginable – even if you might want to slap young Macaulay Culkin round the chops by the end of it. 8pm, E4. Les Misérables Do you hear the people sing? You might hear your family humming or singing along if you sit down to watch this big-budget movie spin on the long-running stage musical set in nineteenth-century France and based loosely on Victor Hugo’s novel. It’s directed by Tom ‘The King’s Speech’ Hooper and the cast includ\n\nWhat's on TV today? Well, December 29 brings a pair of star-studded sequels, some pithy seasonal satire from the 'Screen Wipe' crew and a litter of baby bears sledging on their tummies. Aww. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Those Nazis are back to their old tricks in the third Indiana Jones flick, but our square-jawed hero Harrison Ford plus bumbling Dad (Sean Connery) are there to show ‘em who’s boss. It’s all a bit silly, but the stunts are ace. 1.55pm, BBC1. Life in the Snow Adored ‘Planet Earth II’? Find out more about those creatures who inhabit Earth’s frostier realms, and try not to go ‘awwww!’ too loudly when the baby polar bears come out. 8pm, BBC1. To Walk Invisible Sally Wainwright, writer of ‘Last Tango in Halifax’ and ‘Happy Valley’, explores the tough lives of the Bronte sisters: expect a tale of genius and tragedy. 9pm, BBC1. Life in the Snow Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince This might be most underrated of the ‘Harry Potter’ saga, toning down the action in favour of loveable comedy with Hagrid and genuinely disturbing zombie antics with Dumbledore. And the ending’s a killer… 9pm, ITV. Charlie Brooker’s 2016 Wipe Good luck Charlie – presenting a ‘funny’ look at the past year without leaving viewers suicidal is going to be quite a task. If anyone’s qualified, though… 9pm, BBC2. Cunk on Christmas 'Screen Wipe' correspondent Philomena Cunk brings her consistently funny Northern-female-Ali-G schtick to bear on the festive season. Expect awkwardness and h\n\nToday is a bonus Boxing Day, so make sure you treat it like one. Get comfy on the sofa for big-budget telly treats, scary morality tales and classic films. Raiders of the Lost Ark Settle in for an afternoon with Dr Indiana Jones, the hot archaeology university professor with a sideline in battling bad guys. ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ is a gloriously old-fashioned action movie, packed with giant runaway boulders, snakes and evil Nazis intent on discovering the whereabouts of the Ark of the Covenant (which will give them total power). 1.35pm, BBC1. Happy Feet What says Christmas more than dancing penguins? This cute animated kids’ film is the story of tap-dancing penguin Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood), who doesn’t fit in with the rest of his colony, and makes a break for it. 2.10pm, ITV. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Seven days. All seven Harry Potter adventures. Tonight we’ve got ‘Goblet of Fire’, film number four – the one with the Triwizard Cup at Hogwarts and Harry, Ron, Hermione and the gang suddenly come over all teenage and tortured. 7.30pm, ITV. Inside No 9 Skyfall Somehow ‘Skyfall’ manages to be more heavyweight and loads more enjoyable than last year’s ‘Spectre’. What it’s got going for it is Javier Bardem’s deliciously creepy and psychopathic baddie Silva and a beefed up role for Judi Dench as M. Daniel Craig isn’t too shabby either as a battered and clapped-out 007. 8pm, ITV2. Dirty Dancing Take a break from Christmas and visit Max Kellerman's holiday reso"
