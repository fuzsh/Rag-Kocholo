Read More : https://lnkd.in/grSPkeaz #sonicbranding #creativebriefs #strategiccreativity #creativeexpression\n\nThis is DOPE. I love when I see creatives think outside of the box, and the “Dun Dun” sculpture showcased during Law & Order: Special Victims Unit’s 25th Anniversary celebration, is a prime example of that. It demonstrates how brands can leverage their sonic identities in impactful ways. And it’s a striking illustration of how brands can bridge the gap between the auditory and the visual — creating a multifaceted sensory experience that is as unique as it is memorable. Rewind just a bit, in case you missed it… SVU celebrated its 25th anniversary with a pop-up event that featured a Dun Dun statue — converting an auditory brand element into a tangible, physically accessible artifact. Pretty cool idea! This not only underscores the impact of sonic branding — in this instance, showcasing how iconic and core “Dun Dun\" is to the show's identity, becoming a universally recognized symbol in our culture — but also showcases an unparalleled level of creativity in the realm of sonic branding. It's a bold move that highlights the potential of sonic elements to transcend their traditional roles, turning them into immersive, interactive experiences that deepen fan engagement and loyalty. Takeaways: - Brands should Invest in sonic branding. Typically under appreciated but our sensory experiences forge deep, lasting connections. - Sonic branding can help define brands and set them apart. - Don’t just settle for a great sonic logo or sonic branding assets. There are unique and impactful ways we can seed these sounds into culture, and use them far beyond their traditional roles!"
