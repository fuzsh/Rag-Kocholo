        "text": "Norbit is a 2007 American romantic comedy film directed by Brian Robbins, and written and produced by Eddie Murphy, who also starred in the film. It was released by DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures on February 9, 2007.\n\nThe film features a collaboration between Terry Crews and Marlon Wayans, reuniting them for the first time since 2004's White Chicks.\n\nPlot[]\n\nSpoiler Warning: The following contains important plot details of the entire film.\n\nNorbit Albert Rice (Eddie Murphy) and Kate Thomas (Thandie Newton) are best friends as children at a combination Chinese restaurant and orphanage owned by their father figure, Mr. Wong (Eddie Murphy), but they are separated when Kate gets adopted.\n\nWhile being bullied by twins on a playground one day, Norbit is saved by a tough, overweight girl named Rasputia Latimore (Eddie Murphy) who scares him into being her boyfriend.\n\nEven though at first she genuinely likes Norbit and cares about him, going as far as intimidating other kids into letting Norbit play with them. Rasputia's kindness deteriorates as she grows up to be an ignorant, arrogant, vindictive, and mean-spirited woman. She eventually pressures Norbit into marrying her and bullies, insults & controls him to make sure that she keeps him all to herself.\n\nNorbit is also belittled by Rasputia's older brothers, Big Black Jack (Terry Crews), Blue (Lester Speight) and Earl (Clifton Powell), working as a bookkeeper at their local construction company.\n\nThe Latimore brothers also run a \"security business\" and instill fear in everyone in the town except Mr. Wong, who refuses to sell his establishment to them. When Norbit realizes that Rasputia is cheating on him with her dance instructor Buster Perkin (Marlon Wayans), she carelessly brushes it off like nothing happened. Norbit vents out his anger over Rasputia's infidelity at a puppet show for the children at the orphanage.\n\nUnexpectedly, during the show, Norbit sees Kate for the first time since childhood. Stunned by her return, his affection for her reignites while he learns that she is buying Mr. Wong's orphanage, but he is disappointed to find out that she is now engaged to Deion Hughes (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).\n\nWith the help from his two ex-pimp friends Pope Sweet Jesus (Eddie Griffin) and Lord Have Mercy (Katt Williams) and the other townspeople, Norbit manages to meet with Kate without Rasputia's knowledge.\n\nRevealed to be a crooked businessman and gold digger, Deion helps the Latimore brothers in their plan to turn the restaurant/orphanage into a strip club to get a cut in the profit. The Latimore brothers dupe Norbit into getting Kate to sign papers to renew the restaurant's liquor license and put it in the Latimores' name. Norbit's meeting with Kate leads to him helping her rehearse her wedding, where a kiss between the two of them causes her to reconsider the marriage.\n\nWhen Norbit returns home, he learns that Rasputia somehow witnessed the whole thing and she threatens to kill Kate if she ever sees Norbit with her again. Kate confronts Norbit after finding out about the deal and sees him in the window of the basement, where he has been locked away by a vengeful Rasputia. Norbit tells Kate that he doesn't care what the Latimores are going to do and demands that she leave, in an attempt to drive her away to save her from Rasputia.\n\nRasputia adds that Norbit played Kate and has been setting her up since the first day she came back to town. Fed up with the stress he is under, Norbit decides to leave town for good, but first tries to warn Kate about Deion, but she ignores him.\n\nAfter that, the Latimores have him locked in the basement again and Blue is chosen to stay and keep him from escaping. After the other Latimores leave to go to the wedding, Norbit escapes from the basement and past Blue's guard and races to the church on his bike.\n\nEven though the Latimores attempt to stop him, Norbit reaches the church. Unfortunately, his proof of Deion's divorce settlements exposing Deion's gold digging were destroyed in the process, due to his falling in a pond while escaping the Latimores. However, Deion's ex-wives and children arrive in person as Norbit had arranged to provide further proof of Deion's wrongdoings.\n\nFurious that their plans are ruined, the Latimore brothers attempt to kill Norbit before finding the townspeople rallying up against them.\n\nRasputia fights her way through the crowd and almost kills Norbit, but she runs off after being harpooned in the buttocks by Mr. Wong. Her brothers are chased out of town. After Kate avows her love for Norbit with a passionate kiss, the two reconcile.\n\nKate and Norbit buy the orphanage and get married under the same tree where they once played as children. Rasputia and her brothers move to Mexico and open up El Nipplopolis where Rasputia becomes their most popular and lucrative stripper.\n\nCast[]\n\nEddie Murphy as: Norbit Albert Rice, a shy but lovable nerd; Rasputia Latimore, a morbidly obese, overpossessive, and arrogant woman, who is Norbit's wife; Mr. Hangten Wong, the owner of the orphanage where Norbit and Kate grew up.\n\nKhamani Griffin as young Norbit (age 5)\n\nAustin Reid as young Norbit (age 10)\n\nJonathan Robinson as young Norbit (age 17)\n\nLindsey Sims-Lewis as young Rasputia (age 10)\n\nYves Lola St. Vil as young Rasputia (age 17)\n\nThandie Newton as Kate Thomas, Norbit's friend, in whom he has a romantic interest.\n\nChina Anderson as young Kate (age 5)\n\nTerry Crews as Big Black Jack, Rasputia's eldest brother.\n\nClifton Powell as Earl, Rasputia's youngest brother.\n\nLester Speight as Blue, Rasputia's middle brother.\n\nCuba Gooding, Jr. as Deion Hughes, Kate's fiancé who has several children with different mothers.\n\nEddie Griffin as Pope Sweet Jesus, an ex-pimp and Norbit's friend.\n\nKatt Williams as Lord Have Mercy, Pope's sidekick and friend.\n\nFloyd Levine as Abe, the tailor.\n\nAnthony Russell as Sam Giovanni, the Italian owner of Giovanni's.\n\nPat Crawford Brown as Mrs. Henderson, an elderly woman.\n\nJeanette Miller as Mrs. Coleman, an elderly woman.\n\nMichael Colyar as Morris, the barber.\n\nMarlon Wayans as Buster \"Bust-A-Move\" Perkin, Rasputia's tap dancing instructor with whom Rasputia has an affair.\n\nAlexis Rhee as Mrs. Ling Ling Wong, Mr. Wong's wife.\n\nKristen Schaal as Event Organizer\n\nCharlie Murphy (voice) as Lloyd the Dog, Mrs. Henderson's pet pug dog (credited as Floyd the Dog)\n\nProduction[]\n\n\"Norbit\" was the first of three films where director Brian Robbins and Eddie Murphy worked together. They later collaborated for Meet Dave and A Thousand Words.\n\nIn the case of the first two movies he starred in working with Robbins, Murphy did multiple characters and worked in body costumes.\n\nReception[]\n\nBox Office[]\n\n\"Norbit\" was a success at the box office. It opened to $34.2 million in the United States and was Eddie Murphy's 14th #1 box office opener.\n\nThe film earned $95,673,607 at the North American domestic box office and $63,639,954 in other markets, for a total of $159,313,561 worldwide.\n\nCritical Reception[]\n\nDespite its box office success, \"Norbit\" was nearly universally panned, given only a few positive reviews upon its release.\n\nThe Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 9% positive reviews, based on 123 critics (11 positive, 112 negative).\n\nThe site's consensus states: \"Coming off his Oscar-nominated performance in Dreamgirls, the talented-but-inconsistent Eddie Murphy plays three roles in Norbit, a cruel, crass, stereotype-filled comedy that's more depressing than funny.\"\n\nMetacritic gave the movie a score of 27% based on 26 reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews.\"\n\nMick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the movie a positive review, suggesting that \"Norbit\" might help Murphy's chances of winning an Oscar for his role in Dreamgirls, saying that his work playing three distinct characters in Norbit is more impressive than anything he did in \"Dreamgirls.\"\n\nOthers suggested it might hurt his chances, but ultimately, Alan Arkin won the award for \"Best Supporting Actor.\"\n\nJosh Tyler of Cinemablend.com gave the movie a mostly negative review, in which he described parts of the film as \"pretty despicable\" and stated that \"the plot relies on the idea that being fat also means you’re a horrible bitch.\"\n\nHowever, he pointed out that \"some if it’s also kind of sweet. Eddie’s really quite good as Norbit, the character is sympathetic and funny. He has a strange sort of perfect chemistry with Thandie Newton, and that’s just not something I would have expected.\"\n\nIn another mostly negative review, Liz Braun of Jam! Movies described Norbit as \"mostly blubber jokes about how fat Rasputia really is\" but said that \"the movie is not without genuine laughs. Most of those laughs are generated by the other actors.\" In regard to the \"terrifying\" character Rasputia, she went so far as to say that the film \"tends to confirm one's worst suspicions about Murphy and what appears to be his general fear and loathing of women. The Rasputia gag gets a little freaky if you think about it too much. And you wouldn't want to dwell on how much Thandie Newton looks like a slender boy in her role as Norbit's true love, either. So don't.\"\n\nSome black activists took issue with Eddie Murphy's portrayal of the character Rasputia, calling Norbit \"just the latest [film built] around a black man dressing up as an unsophisticated, overweight black woman.\"\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a B grade, with under eighteens (28% of those surveyed) giving it a \"B+\" grade."
