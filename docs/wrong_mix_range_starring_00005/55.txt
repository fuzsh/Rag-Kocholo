Uma Thurman has been signed to star in the American version of 'The Slap.'

Based on Christos Tsiolkas's best-selling novel, the project, which would be helmed by Oscar-nominated director Lisa Cholodenko, would mark second TV show for Thurman, 44, who had starred in 2012 musical drama 'Smash,' the BBC reported.

The 'Kill Bill' actress would replace the originally hired 'Weeds' star Mary-Louise Parker, who had to quit due to pneumonia, and plat the role of Anouk, a TV writer who is dating her show's young leading man.

The book, which charts the fallout after a man slaps another couple's child, was also adapted into a Australian mini-series in 2011, which starred Sophie Okonedo and Melissa George.

While George would reprise her role as overprotective mother Rosie in NBC's eight-part mini-series, Thandie Newton would fill in for role played by Okonedo, with Brian Cox, Peter Sarsgaard and Zachary Quinto also starring in the series.
