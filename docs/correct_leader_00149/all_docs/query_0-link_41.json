        "text": "UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL\n\nStatement by H.E. Mr John Dauth LVO Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Australia to the United Nations\n\nThe Situation In East Timor\n\n26 April 2002\n\nMr President\n\nAt the outset allow me to recognise the presence in the Council today of the President-elect of East Timor, Mr Xanana Gusmao, and to offer Australia's sincere congratulations on his election; and also to recognise the presence of the Chief Minister of the Second East Timor Transitional Government, Dr Mari Alkatiri. Their attendance here today serves to remind us how close we are to seeing the formal transfer of authority to an independent Government of East Timor.\n\nThe successful Presidential election in East Timor on 14 April was a major step in the final stages of East Timor's transition to independence. Our consideration of East Timor in the Security Council today, and the decisions to be taken by Council members in the coming weeks, are further critical elements of this process. These decisions will have a direct and significant impact on the international community's continuing role in East Timor, and on the long-term future of the new nation.\n\nI thank Assistant Secretary-General Annabi for his comprehensive briefing on the Secretary-General's report. The report shows how far East Timor's transition has come. While much remains to be done, UNTAET has built a sound foundation for an effective, viable and democratic independent nation. This is due in no small part to the valuable and tireless contribution of the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello. I take this opportunity to extend to him and all members of UNTAET Australia's thanks for their dedication to laying the groundwork for the future independent East Timor.\n\nTurning to the future, the Secretary-General's report underlines that at independence a number of critical elements of the new State of East Timor will remain fragile. Without a continued international presence and commitment, the progress achieved so far will be at risk.\n\nThe Secretary-General has presented us with a comprehensive, practical and responsible plan for a United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) after independence. If carefully implemented, this plan, which Australia fully endorses, will provide the best possible chance for a stable, democratic and effective independent East Timor.\n\nAustralia supports the Secretary-General's recommendations for a successor mission covering the four key components of peacekeeping, civilian police, a Civilian Support Group and an office of the Secretary-General's Special Representative, and funded from assessed contributions. We also support the Secretary-General's clear exit strategy which envisages the progressive downsizing of all core components over a two year period, against the achievement of clear milestones.\n\nWith regard to the security components of the new mission, we appreciate the Secretary-General's advice that discussions are underway to finalise plans for command and control of the security forces in East Timor after independence. We strongly support the continued constructive work to develop, in as precise detail as possible, these arrangements. We also believe it is critical to continued international confidence in East Timor that the arrangements operate in accordance with the standard UN procedures, and that the new Government approaches this particularly sensitive area of administration in a highly cooperative spirit.\n\nThe successor mission in East Timor must not operate in isolation from the broader international effort to assist East Timor. We therefore welcome the Secretary-General's description of the relationship between UNMISET, the wider UN system of agencies, funds and programmes, and the national development plan of the East Timor Government. This coordinated approach will lay the basis for East Timor's eventual transition to a normal development situation, with long-term needs assisted by UN agencies and other donor assistance.\n\nRealisation of this goal will depend not only on assessed funding for the duration of the successor mission, but also on sustained long-term support from the international community. For its part, Australia has made a significant contribution. In addition to our share of assessed contributions, we have spent A$1.4 billion on our military contribution from July 1999 to June 2001, and have committed A$150 million for the four years from July 2000 to help with reconstruction and development in East Timor.\n\nContinued international support will be critical to protect the considerable investments made so far, and to promote East Timor's long-term development. In addition, as the Secretary-General has stated in his report, the achievement of key milestones during the coming two years will be greatly accelerated by strong donor support, particularly in the critical areas of establishing the border and customs service, resourcing and equipping of police and military institutions and the establishment of an adequate justice system. The more that international donors can support these key steps, the faster the successor mission will be able to achieve its milestones, and the more efficiently the UN presence can be reduced.\n\nAustralia will continue to do its part both through the United Nations and bilaterally to support East Timor's transition and future development. We urge our fellow Member States to do likewise."
