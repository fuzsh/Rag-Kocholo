        "text": "Voting system Proportional: Proportional representation system (party list systems)\n\nEach voter selects one list from among the plurinominal lists presented by political parties or party coalitions. Each list must contain the names of 65 candidates and no fewer than 25 alternate candidates. One in every three candidates on the party lists must be a woman.\n\nSeats are allocated according to the highest average system, using the d'Hondt method. Parties and coalitions obtaining less than 3 per cent of the total votes are not entitled to a seat. Members of parliament who are elected to the National Parliament on one list and who switch to another party/coalition after their election forfeit their seats.\n\nVacancies arising between general elections are filled by the \"next-in-line\" candidate of the same party/coalition. Seats vacated by women must be filled by the next woman candidate on the respective list. The seat remains vacant if there are no more unelected candidates or alternate candidates on the list to which the holder of the vacant seat belonged.\n\nVoting is not compulsory, but voter registration is. Candidacy requirements - Candidatures must be presented by duly registered political parties on party or coalition lists (the coalition must also be duly registered). The lists may include citizens not belonging to the respective parties or coalitions.\n\n- One in every three candidates on the party lists must be a woman.\n\n- No political party or party coalition may present more than one list of candidates.\n\n- No one can be a candidate on more than one list. Timing and scope of renewal The Alliance of Change for Progress (AMP, see note 1), led by former President and Prime Minister Xanana GusmÃ£o, won a majority in the 65-member Parliament. It defeated the Revolutionary Front for an independent East Timor (FRETILIN) led by President Francisco \"Lu Olo\" Guterres, which had led a minority government with the Democratic Party (PD) after the 2017 elections (see note 2). During the 2018 election campaign, the major parties promised to develop education and healthcare and to boost the agriculture and tourism sectors.\n\nNote 1:\n\nThe AMP comprises Mr. Gusmao's National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT), the People's Liberation Party (PLP) and the Kmanek Haburas Unidade Nasional Timor Oan (KHUNTO), a youth party established before the 2017 elections.\n\nNote 2:\n\nThe minority government, led by Mr. Mari Alkatiri (FRETILIN) - the country's first prime minister after independence from Indonesia in 2002 - was unable to pass key legislation including the country's budget in the Parliament controlled by the CNRT-led opposition. After the budget was rejected twice by Parliament in October and December 2017, the President dissolved Parliament in January 2018 and called for fresh elections for May, less than 10 months after the previous elections."
