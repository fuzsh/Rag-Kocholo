        "text": "Fien Riske-Nielson, UN Humanitarian Coordinator in East Timor, said on Monday that the world body would issue a “flash appeal” for aid and funds later on Monday at its New York headquarters for $18 million to cover three months of operations.\n\nHe said he expected “a positive response to the appeal.”\n\nRiske-Nielson also said the number of internally displaced persons who fled their homes after violence last month was now estimated at 100,000, scattered in various camps around the capital Dili and nearby districts.\n\n“We are planning to do an assessment again in the coming days because there are indications that the number could be increasing outside Dili,” he said as he toured an overcrowded refugee camp run by Catholic nuns.\n\nThe humanitarian situation, he said, remained “precarious” because even if the situation was under control for the time being, the overcrowding in camps could lead to outbreak of disease.\n\n“The situation in the camps is very difficult,” he said. “People aren’t going home because they are afraid.”\n\nJose Ramos-Horta, the foreign minister, also speaking at a refugee camp, said he hoped refugees would begin returning to their homes “if they feel the situation is really stabilised.”\n\nDeadlock\n\nThe UN announcement came with rebel soldiers and the government still in deadlock over calls for Mari Alkatiri, the prime minister, who has been widely blamed for the violence, to resign from office.\n\nPresident Xanana Gusmao has been leading efforts to try and break a deadlock with rebel soldiers who are calling for Alkatiri to quit and prevent further escalation of tension, the foreign minister said."
