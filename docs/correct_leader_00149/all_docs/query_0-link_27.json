        "text": "The United Nations representative in East Timor has backed an investigation process into the country's crisis that could lead to the Government being dissolved.\n\nSukehiro Hasegawa has met with rebel army commanders and Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri.\n\nThe rebels are insisting that Dr Alkatiri should resign, while Dr Alkatiri's supporters say he still has a mandate.\n\nMr Hasegawa says Dr Alkatiri is willing to undergo an investigation that would include international investigators.\n\n\"He's agreeable to the investigations to carried out into what happened during April and May, he is very transparent and he insists that truth should be known,\" he told The World Today.\n\n\"He is agreeable for the investigations to be carried out with the participation of the international investigators and prosecutors.\"\n\nMr Hasegawa says the rebels will not come down from their hideouts unless Mr Alkatiri stands down.\n\n\"They are very firm in maintaining their demands that the Prime Minister resign before they can enter into any negotiations for reconciliation,\" he said.\n\n\"In other words they are demanding that the Government be dissolved before they start a reconciliation process.\"\n\nGovernment legitimate\n\nBut Mr Hasegawa says the Mr Alkatiri believes the Government has a legitimate right to remain in power.\n\n\"Government is here, as the Prime Minister insists, based on a constitutional framework and that he insists that government has been formed through an electoral process that took place four years ago,\" he said.\n\n\"Therefore they are equally firm in insisting they have a legitimate right to remain in power.\n\n\"We should not presume anything that may happen, I think justice should prevail and the truth should come out.\"\n\nMr Hasegawa is will leave Dili for New York this afternoon carrying a recommendation for the Security Council to approve a UN-mandated police force for the country.\n\nInjured East Timorese\n\nThe unrest in East Timor over the past fortnight has killed 20 people and left dozens wounded.\n\nTwo East Timorese men evacuated from Dili this week suffering from head injuries are in a stable condition in the Royal Darwin Hospital.\n\nThe Army officer and policeman were injured during fighting in Dili 10 days ago.\n\nThe policeman was shot in the face and has a bullet lodged in his cheek, and the Army officer has a head wound.\n\nHospital spokesman Len Notaras says the men should make a full recovery.\n\n\"There's no doubt that of the several victims that we've received from this particular incident - 12 in all - all of them have been extremely lucky to have survived what was obviously a very traumatic and horrendous event,\" he said.\n\n\"The injuries are certainly serious injuries, but they remain in a stable condition and I suspect that over the next week or 10 days will benefit from the clinical service on this site, and should both see reasonable recoveries.\""
