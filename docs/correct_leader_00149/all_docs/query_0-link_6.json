        "text": "The Democratic Republic of East Timor has become a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF's Articles of Agreement were signed in Washington, D.C. by His Excellency Mari Alkatiri, Prime Minister of East Timor.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of East Timor's initial quota1 in the IMF is SDR 8.2 million (about US$11 million). With the admission of The Democratic Republic of East Timor, membership in the IMF totals 184 countries, and the total of members' quotas is SDR 212.6 billion (about US$285 billion).\n\n1 A member's quota in the IMF determines in particular its capital subscription, its voting weight, its access to IMF financing, and its allocation of SDRs."
