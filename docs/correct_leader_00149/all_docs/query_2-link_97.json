        "text": "Significance\n\nIncumbent President Francisco Guterres, leader of the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin), is aiming for a second five-year term. His main rival is Jose Ramos-Horta, a former president who is supported by Xanana Gusmaoâ€™s National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT).\n\nImpacts\n\nA high turnout is likely, as many voters are dissatisfied with the quality of government and social inequalities.\n\nYounger voters will probably be drawn more to candidates besides Guterres and Ramos-Horta.\n\nRamos-Horta could reconfigure the government if he wins."
