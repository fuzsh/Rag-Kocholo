        "text": "Introduction -- Canada Program -- U.S. Program -- Guest Participants -- Web Links\n\nEast Timor: A People Shattered By Lies and Silence,\n\nan article by Professor Antonio Barbedo de Magalhaes.\n\nA conference on East Timor and Indonesia was held in Vancouver, Canada at Simon Fraser University and University of British Columbia on March 6-8, preceded by various similar conferences in the USA. Names of local organizers, contact persons, foreign participants, and where possible the local participants are given. Themes discussed are also included.\n\nThe goal of these initiatives was to spread knowledge in North America about the general situation and the oppression and the suffering of the peoples of East Timor and of Indonesia, and to raise the commitment toward finding a global solution for the drama of East Timor, in accordance with International Law. The improvment of Human Rights and of Democratic values in East Timor and Indonesia was also an objective of the conferences and meetings.\n\nThe Portuguese Universities Foundation provided the funding and the sponsorship to bring to Canada and the United States some Timorese representatives, including the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr. Jose Ramos Horta, a few Indonesian democrats and a small number of other personalities like Bishop Hilton Deakin, from Melbourne, Australia, for his special link with the diocesis of Dili and the people of East Timor.\n\nThe Portuguese Universities Foundation is a Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) created by the Council of Rectors of the almost twenty Public Portuguese Universities (which includes the Portuguese Catholic University, the first non-stateowned Portuguese University)\n\nThose initiatives were jointly organised by U.S. and Canadian Universities and academics with a Committee of Portuguese Academics, on behalf of the Portuguese Universities Foundation.\n\nThis Committee consists of:\n\nProf. Abmlio Hernandez, Deputy President of the Coimbra University (created in 1290)\n\nProf. Antonio Barbedo de Magalhaes, Engineering Faculty, representing the President of the Porto University,\n\nProf. Armando Marques Guedes, Law Faculty, Lisbon University (Ex-President of the Constitutional Tribunal),\n\nDr. Josi Alberto Azeredo Lopes, Secretary of the International Studies Center of the Catholic University (R.S.Porto), Lecturer (AT) of International Public Law at the Catholic University, Porto.\n\nProf. Luis Filipe Lobo Fernandes, President of the Association of Professionals of International Relations and Assistant Prof. of International Relations at Minho University, Braga,\n\nProf. Maria Laura Bettencourt Pires, Head of the Institute of Long Distance Teaching and Director of the Center for American Studies of the Open University, Lisbon,\n\nProf. Vasco Garcia, President of Azores University.\n\nThe participation of U.S. and Canadian academics, politicians, journalists and other personalities was welcomed in these initiatives, and local participants were invited to participate in each of the events. But it was an important opportunity for the Timorese representatives and Indonesian democrats to speak.\n\nProviding the opportunity for the Timoreses to come from East Timor and finding the Indonesian guest speakers to participate was fraught with difficulties. Many could not come to North America at all to participante in those meetings: they are in jail, have seen their passports confiscated or not renewed by Indonesian authorities, or are on a blacklist, forbidden to leave the country. Others, even if allowed to travel, fear the consequences. And fear is well founded, especially if one is reminded that two Indonesian citizens who came to Portugal, at the invitation of Oporto University, to participate in a Conference titled :\n\nSolidarity of Indonesian Youth, Hope for East Timor,\n\nin February, 1996, are both now in jail, accused of having participated in this conference and defending there the right to self determination of East Timor.\n\nThey are Mochtar Pakpahan, trade unionist leader of SBSI, and the young Wilson, graduate in History from Indonesia University (Jakarta) and Head of the Education Department of PPBI.\n\nOn behalf of the Portuguese Universities Foundation,\n\nAntonio Barbedo de Magalhaes\n\nCoordinator of the Symposia on Timor of Oporto University\n\nPROGRAM FOR CANADA SYMPOSIUM Human Rights and Democratic Development - The case of East Timor and Indonesia\n\n(as of 17.02.97)\n\nForeign Participants:\n\n-Dr. Jose Ramos Horta (March 7 and 8)\n\nCurrent Nobel Peace Laureate,\n\nPersonal Representantive of Xanana Gusmco,\n\nLeader of CNRM (National Council of the Maubere Resistance).\n\n-Bishop Hilton Deakin\n\nAuxiliar Bishop (Catholic) of Melbourne (March 6 and 7)\n\nHe visited East Timor several times in the last years\n\nChairman of the East Timor Human Rights Center in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nEng.
