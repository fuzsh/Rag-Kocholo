        "text": "Independence heroes Xanana Gusmao (pic) and Mari Alkatiri are rivals in East Timor's election. (EPA PHOTO)\n\nEast Timorese voters are going to the polls in a parliamentary election that analysts say is likely see two resistance-era figures battle to be prime minister.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\nSunday's poll is the country's fifth parliamentary election since East Timor gained full independence in 2002 following decades-long occupation by Indonesia.\n\nJose Maria Vasconcelos, who has been prime minister since 2018, is backed by a four-party coalition led by the Revolutionary Front for an Independent Timor-Leste . Analysts do not expect him to be appointed as PM again.\n\nSeventeen parties are competing in the election but two, the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT), led by independence hero Xanana Gusmao, and FRETILIN, led by resistance figure Mari Alkatiri, are expected to dominate.\n\nThe next PM is expected to be Gustmao or Alkatiri, depending whose party wins.\n\nEast Timor has in recent years grappled with diversifying its oil- and gas-dependent economy.\n\n\"Xanana Gusmao has been in the opposition for the past three years and is trying to get back into power,\" Michael Leach of Australia's Swinburne University said of the country's former president and prime minister.\n\n\"CNRT and FRETILIN will certainly be the two largest parties,\" he said.\n\nSome polls showed CNRT ahead. Leach said the victory of Jose Ramos Horta in last year's presidential election was seen as paving a way for CNRT's return to power.\n\nThe party with a parliamentary majority will nominate the next prime minister.\n\nThe new parliament will take office on June 12.\n\nAustralian Associated Press\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAd\n\nGet the latest Mt Isa news in your inbox\n\nSign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.\n\nEmail address\n\nWe care about the protection of your data.
