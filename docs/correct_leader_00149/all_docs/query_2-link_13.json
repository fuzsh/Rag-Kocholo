        "text": "After a reshuffling of the parliamentary coalition in mid-2020, Timor-Leste’s government remained stable through 2023 – marking the longest ruling government in eight years. The majority coalition, which supports People’s Liberation Party (PLP) Prime Minister Taur Matan Ruak, includes the Frente Revolucionária de Timor-Leste Independente (FRETILIN) and Kmanek Haburas Unidade Nasional Timor Oan (KHUNTO). In opposition is the Congresso Nacional de Reconstrução Timorense (CNRT) party, with the Democratic Party (PD) straddling the political factions.\n\nAfter several years of limited effectiveness, Timor-Leste’s political institutions are functioning well – the state budgets for the period from 2021 to 2023 were enacted on time, and an average of 18 laws per year were enacted from 2020 to 2022, compared to four in 2018/2019. Nevertheless, unforeseen events and hasty initiatives led to mid-year budget revisions in 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn the 2022 presidential election, the incumbent FRETILIN president, Lú-Olo, was defeated by nonpartisan former President José Ramos-Horta, who was supported by the CNRT. The next parliamentary election will be in May 2023. Elections are free, fair and peaceful, and the rule of law prevails.\n\nTimor-Leste declared a COVID-19 state of emergency in April 2020, which was extended throughout 2021. Despite certain health-related restrictions on travel and assembly, civil liberties and freedom of speech were widely respected. Approximately 80% of the population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. In order to mitigate the economic consequences of the pandemic, the Timor-Leste government has provided financial assistance and essential goods to nearly all households from 2020 to 2023.\n\nThe half-island country was fortunate. Despite the limitations of its health care system, only 138 people have died from COVID-19, representing a per capita fatality rate less than one-fifteenth that of Germany. No COVID-19 fatalities have been reported since August 2022.\n\nThe economy continues to rely on government outlays, with little progress toward diversification. Although spending and GDP grew slightly in 2019 and 2021, constant-price, non-oil GDP per capita was 16% lower in 2021 than it had been five years earlier. GDP for productive sectors not driven by state spending, such as agriculture and manufacturing, has been declining for a decade. The World Bank forecasts 3% annual growth in real, non-oil GDP in 2022 and 2023 (IMF and Timor-Leste government projections are slightly higher), during which time the population will increase by about 1.8% per year. Timor-Leste’s population remains the fastest-growing in Southeast Asia.\n\nChild malnutrition and poverty remain among the worst in the world, and goods imports outweigh non-oil exports by a ratio of 25 to 1.\n\nMore than 80% of state expenditures come from the Petroleum Fund (PF). Oil and gas incomes have virtually ended, as the only producing field ceased production in early 2023. PF income now comes from overseas financial instruments – the value of which dropped more than 11% in 2022 – resulting in an end-of-year PF balance of $17.4 billion, the lowest since 2018. Nevertheless, the government expects to withdraw more than triple the “sustainable” amount during the next few years, and the PF could be depleted entirely within a decade. Although the Ministry of Finance and others warn of a “fiscal cliff,” the government has yet to take serious measures to diversify the economy, cut spending or increase non-oil revenues.\n\nIn 2019, Timor-Leste resolved its maritime boundary with Australia and acquired a controlling stake in the Sunrise offshore gas and oil field, its sole remaining significant reserve. Despite initial expectations that the development of Sunrise would recommence after a nearly 20-year delay, investors have not stepped forward. Despite changes in Timor-Leste’s petroleum leadership in 2020, the government maintains its stance regarding transporting Sunrise gas to its shores, whereas some joint venture partners believe that liquefying the gas in Australia would be more advantageous. Negotiations are ongoing, but there has been no progress.\n\nThe state-owned TimorGAP petroleum company has not generated any income since 2021. Instead, it received government subsidies averaging $60 million per year.\n\nBecause Timor-Leste has benefited from oil and gas reserves in the past, many people expect that it will continue to do so. However, the three test wells in 2021/2022 came up dry, and a bidding round for new exploration contracts failed to attract any established foreign companies not already investing in Timor-Leste.\n\nAfter more than 400 years of Portuguese colonization, Timor-Leste declared independence on November 28, 1975. Nine days later, Indonesia invaded, starting 24 years of an illegal military occupation that claimed the lives of a quarter of Timor-Leste’s people. In 1999, the United Nations organized a referendum, albeit belatedly. When 78.5% of the population voted for independence, Indonesia proceeded to burn down the majority of buildings in the country. After two and a half years of transitional U.N. rule, Timor-Leste regained its independence on May 20, 2002.\n\nTimor-Leste had to recover from violence and trauma – including people displaced to Indonesia and the near-total destruction of its infrastructure and buildings – draft its constitution and laws, and construct a state administration and public services from scratch. Having endured war and oppression, the Timorese embraced peace, pluralism, democracy and human rights, although neither their leaders nor people had ever lived under a government that even pretended to address the public interest.\n\nThe constitution provides for a semi-presidential system in which the president and the parliament (which selects the prime minister) are elected by direct, universal suffrage for five-year terms. Parliamentarians are elected on national party slates with proportional representation, as long as a 4% minimum hurdle is surpassed.\n\nThe Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (FRETILIN), a party established in 1974 to advocate for independence, emerged victorious in the initial free elections held in 2001, selecting Mari Alkatiri as prime minister. Xanana Gusmão, a prominent leader of the resistance, was elected president in 2002.\n\nIn 2006, the “crisis” began with clashes between the military and police. It had deep underlying causes. The prime minister was forced to resign, approximately 250 people were killed, thousands of houses were burned and over 100,000 previously traumatized citizens were displaced. It took several years and significant government compensation before the internally displaced persons (IDPs) could return home.\n\nNevertheless, the 2007 elections went smoothly, with nonpartisan diplomat José Ramos-Horta elected president. A few months later, a coalition led by the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT) – a party that Xanana Gusmão had just created – formed a parliamentary majority alliance with smaller parties and named Xanana as prime minister. In the 2012 elections, the CNRT retained control of parliament. However, in 2015, Xanana resigned as prime minister, inviting FRETILIN’s Dr. Rui Araujo to be prime minister. This power-sharing arrangement lasted two years with unprecedented cooperation between the two major parties, although Xanana continued to make major policy decisions.\n\nFormer resistance officer and attorney Francisco Guterres “Lú-Olo,” a FRETILIN leader also backed by the CNRT, won the 2017 presidential election. For the parliamentary elections two months later, ex-President Taur Matan Ruak created another new political party, the People’s Liberation Party (PLP). FRETILIN won a plurality, but their minority government was short-lived, and an early election was held in 2018. The coalition of the CNRT, PLP and KHUNTO (a new party based on a martial arts group) won 34 out of 65 seats in parliament and chose Taur Matan Ruak as prime minister. FRETILIN, with 23 seats and support from smaller parties, led a vocal parliamentary opposition, often allied with the president.\n\nIn 2020, a realignment brought FRETILIN into government with the PLP and KHUNTO, placing the CNRT in opposition. Ruak remained the prime minister. The new coalition is backed by over 40 members of parliament and is expected to remain in office until the next parliamentary election.\n\nTimor-Leste entered nationhood as the poorest country in Southeast Asia, with limited financial resources other than donor support. While some social indicators, such as maternal and child mortality, tuberculosis, and malaria have shown improvement, they still remain among the worst in the region. Child malnutrition continues to rank among the highest globally. Over 40% of the population lives in poverty.\n\nSignificant income from oil and gas began in 2006. Timor-Leste’s state expenditures grew fourfold over the next five years. However, petroleum revenues will end in 2023. Although there is less than an even chance that other fields could provide significant revenues in the future, this mirage dominates policymakers’ thinking. Decisions are often afflicted by the resource curse, with little interest in preparing for the inevitable, challenging, post-petroleum future.\n\nMost of the oil revenues have been saved in the Petroleum Fund (PF), which has received $24.9 billion in oil and gas income and $7.5 billion in returns from investing in overseas stocks and bonds. A total of $15.0 billion has been withdrawn from the fund since 2007, covering 85% of state expenditures, leaving $17.4 billion remaining. Until 2015, Timor-Leste was among the world’s most petroleum-export-dependent countries, but it now relies on its financial investments, which experienced a loss of about $2 billion in 2022. Between 2014 and 2021, the number of private sector jobs declined by 16%, while the working-age population grew by approximately 18%. Over two-thirds of the adult population are not part of the formally defined labor force, with the majority being subsistence farmers.\n\nTimor-Leste’s people remain extremely poor and are still recovering from a long history of autocratic foreign rule and war. Although the state has spent $15 billion of its limited petroleum wealth, the results are rarely visible in the rural areas where two-thirds of the population lives.\n\nAccess to a basic water source (85.5%), access to basic sanitation (56.8%) and access to electricity (96.1%) are more limited than in many other southeast Asian nations.\n\nGovernment administration exists throughout the country, although some functions require one to come to the capital, Dili. However, many public services, including education, transportation, water, sanitation and health care, are less effective and available in rural areas than in the capital, where decision-makers are located. Even where schools or health services exist, staffing, resources and facilities are often inadequate. Human resource capacity constraints add extra challenges to bureaucratic efficiency. Bureaucratic processes are frequently slow and can be further constrained by the allocation of executive ministries to political coalition partners without regard for skills or experience, especially when budget allocations depend on ministerial influence within government.\n\nAlthough some corruption exists, most of this neglect is legal.\n\nThe national government is responsible for nearly all services; decentralization has been discussed for many years but has not been effectively put into practice.\n\nTravel and other restrictions imposed in 2020/2021 to limit the spread of COVID-19 made things more difficult for many, but they were largely lifted by the beginning of 2022. The government distributed money and basic goods to every household to help alleviate hardship.\n\nThe democratically elected members of parliament and the president, and the ministers they select, are able to govern effectively. There is no “veto player” who does not have electoral legitimacy. The semi-presidential system divides power between the directly elected president of the republic and the prime minister (and his cabinet), who is chosen by the parliament. The president has veto powers, which he has exercised. Parliament may revert the presidential veto, but in some cases, this requires a two-thirds supermajority – making his veto power more substantial than it may appear. The president’s veto over executive decree-laws is irreversible.\n\nMost major political leaders (including Prime Minister Taur Matan Ruak, former President Lú-Olo, and influential former Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão) were senior figures in the guerrilla resistance, and hierarchical patterns and deference to heroes of national liberation can confer informal legitimacy and political power.\n\nFrom March 2020 through the end of 2021, the executive and legislative branches worked together to adopt, renew and revise the COVID-19 state of emergency. Although he is from a different political base from the government and parliamentary majority, President José Ramos-Horta, who took office in mid-2022, signed all eight bills sent to him by parliament in 2022 and all 56 decree-laws approved by the Council of Ministers. The newly elected president asked the Court of Appeal for advice on a billion-dollar Veterans’ Fund, which was enacted just before he took office. When the court found it to be unconstitutional, he asked parliament to remove it from the 2023 budget, which it did.\n\nThe party system includes established parties (FRETILIN and PD) and others created by former presidents in order to pursue the executive powers allocated to the prime minister (CNRT, PLP). The CNRT, formed in 2007 by resistance leader and President Xanana Gusmão, and the historic independence party (FRETILIN) are the two largest parties. FRETILIN has a grassroots base, while the CNRT is supported primarily by those who are loyal to Xanana or who benefited from the CNRT’s allocation of state resources. Three other parties have significant parliamentary representation: PD, which emerged in 2001 out of the student resistance movement; PLP (formed by the former president and current prime minister, Taur Matan Ruak, in 2017); and KHUNTO, a smaller party associated with youth movements and related to a martial arts group. One other coalition won three seats in the 2018 election, while four contesting parties won none. In 2018/2019, the ruling coalition was comprised of the PLP, the CNRT and KHUNTO, but a realignment in May 2020 created a new majority that included the PLP, FRETILIN and KHUNTO. Most of the 14 candidates in the 2022 presidential election ran without party affiliation, although the three highest-votes winners had party support. There are several smaller parties that sometimes win parliamentary representation by exceeding the 4% proportional representation threshold in the single national district.\n\nMost political parties are organized around persons rather than policy or ideology. Internal democracy is limited in all parties, and many are dominated by strong leaders and have limited capacity to represent rural or grassroots interests. Voter volatility is moderate, though first-time voters without strong party affiliations comprise some 20% of the national electorate in each five-year electoral cycle.\n\nPolitical polarization, particularly the competition between the CNRT and FRETILIN, has been a dominant factor in Timor-Leste politics since 2006, except for a brief period between 2015 and 2017, when they were in a grand coalition-style alliance. The CNRT, now in opposition, usually votes against government proposals.\n\nAlthough clientelism continues, it appears to be less widespread under the current multiparty government than when a single party (either the CNRT or FRETILIN) governed in past years.\n\nDespite the implementation of free market policies, numerous challenges hinder business development.\n\nInternational companies and investments are welcome, although the constitution prohibits non-citizens from owning land. Instead, foreign investment often entails partnering with local entities or entering into long-term leases. Market access is generally unhindered; however, domestic markets are small, and there is a scarcity of entrepreneurs and skilled workers. Many private sector businesses primarily rely on the state as their main customer, often engaging in rent-seeking activities.\n\nIn some sectors, laws give preference to local contractors, suppliers, and workers. In practice, this is not a significant barrier to foreign companies, and Timor-Leste remains heavily dependent on imports. Tariffs are low, and imports enter freely. Foreign investors are lured with tax incentives. State regulations are not detrimental to the establishment of private enterprises and do not interfere with market prices. However, high inflation in 2022/2023 is increasing public calls for price controls.\n\nLevels of poverty constrain domestic markets for locally produced goods, which limits opportunities for market-based competition. Since most consumers are in rural areas and have little money and few choices about where to obtain goods, market principles often do not apply. Subsistence agriculture is significant, especially in rural areas.\n\nIn 2021, the government acceded to the 1958 U.N. Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and enacted a legal regime for voluntary arbitration.\n\nThe government has invested significant amounts in port and cement projects operated by private companies and is discussing similar investments in a resort. The Tibar Port, financed through a public-private partnership (PPP), began operation in late 2022. In that same year, the Court of Appeal found significant irregularities in the allocation of public funds to the cement project, and the money will be recalled. The Pelican Paradise luxury resort, which has been delayed for many years, may soon begin construction. Aside from oil and gas exploration and extraction, a Heineken beverage plant is the only operating project financed by foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\nThe state-owned oil company TimorGAP, funded by public funds in the absence of its own revenues, is involved in several oil and gas exploration ventures, some of which are in partnership with foreign companies. However, none of these have produced anything, and most may not be commercially viable.\n\nForeign investors have been hesitant to invest in Timor-Leste’s emerging petroleum industry for several years. A recently concluded, heavily delayed bidding round for new oil and gas exploration has resulted in the selection of only one foreign company new to Timor-Leste (HTS of Kazakhstan). However, Santos and Eni, who were already operating in Timor-Leste, may also be recognized, along with the inclusion of TimorGAP and a private Timorese company.\n\nThe state has spent significant public funds promoting and developing two major infrastructure projects – the Tasi Mane oil and gas project on the southern coast and the ZEESM (Special Social-Economic Market Zone) project in Oecussi. The concept behind both of these state-led initiatives was that initial investments by the state would attract private investors; however, that has not been the case so far.\n\nThe majority of households live by working in the informal sector and the above indicators are not relevant to them. Less than a quarter of the working-age population is in the cash economy – about 27% are subsistence farmers or fishers, 21% are students, and the rest are retired, unemployed or engaged in unpaid household work.\n\nTrade policy is very liberal, with low import duties (MFN average 2.5%, lower than 93% of countries) and low tax rates. In late 2022, the government increased import duties on expensive cars and certain items detrimental to public health, such as tobacco, alcohol and sugary drinks. Inconsistent messaging, along with price-gouging by retailers, resulted in confusion and a negative public reaction. Additionally, there are newly implemented quarantine laws aimed at limiting the importation of plants and animals that could potentially harm indigenous species, though these laws adhere to international standards.\n\nThe country joined the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes in 2016.\n\nThe government has been making efforts to join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) since 2011, and quite actively since 2019. Progress is anticipated in 2023, particularly as Indonesia assumes the chairmanship of ASEAN. Should Timor-Leste be admitted, it would facilitate free trade with the nations that currently account for approximately 80% of goods that Timor-Leste imports.\n\nTimor-Leste has been seeking WTO admission since 2016. In 2022, it revised its Customs Code to be in compliance with WTO rules and expects to be accepted in 2023.\n\nHowever, trade is largely one-sided, as most containers leave empty after unloading their cargo. In 2022, goods imports amounted to $786 million, while non-oil goods exports reached $29 million, with 89% of that being coffee. Gathering accurate information about oil exports is challenging due to the non-renewable nature of this resource, resulting in inconsistent and incomplete official data. As for services, annual imports amount to approximately $700 million, while exports hover around $60 million.\n\nIn 2022, Indonesia supplied 32% of goods imports, with 16% coming from China (including Hong Kong), followed by Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. Most natural gas exports go to Japan after being liquefied in Australia. Oil is sold at sea to various partners, and non-oil exports in 2022 were primarily sold to Canada, Indonesia, Germany, China, the United States and Australia.\n\nThere are low nontariff barriers to international trade. The government is spending large sums of money on infrastructure for international shipping, road transport and air travel.\n\nTimor-Leste has no public debt to individuals, although plans are being made to issue government bonds.\n\nForeign debt is low but growing. Contracts signed for loans from the World Bank, ADB and Japan total about $850 million, of which $280 million has been disbursed to date, all for road construction. The 2023 state budget authorizes up to $200 million in new loan contracts, and less transparent methods may be used to secure financing for future petroleum projects. In late 2022, the World Bank noted that “Timor-Leste remains at moderate risk of overall and external debt distress beyond the medium term.”\n\nSince oil and gas revenues declined in 2015, Timor-Leste’s current account balance has fluctuated with the (unrealized) price of its investments in international stocks and bonds. Trade in non-oil goods and services runs an annual deficit of about $1.4 billion.\n\nApproximately 85% of state expenditures are paid out of the sovereign wealth Petroleum Fund, allowing spending to exceed non-petroleum revenues without incurring debt. The PF, which currently contains about $17.4 billion (nine times the 2023 state budget), no longer receives significant oil and gas income. It is mainly invested in overseas financial instruments that generated more than $9 billion in revenue from 2005 to 2021 but lost nearly $2 billion in 2022.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance now warns of a “fiscal cliff” that could force an 85% cut in state expenditures when the Petroleum Fund is exhausted in 2035 (some analysts fear it could come sooner). Nevertheless, current policies do little to delay or avert this threat, despite repeated warnings from the World Bank, IMF and civil society. Although the urgency of diversifying the economy is often discussed, not much is done to make it happen.\n\nAfter declining slightly due to political uncertainty between 2018 and 2020, state spending increased by 27% in 2021 and by 20% in 2022. It is expected to continue growing.\n\nSince 2009, the Estimated Sustainable Income (ESI) formula for Petroleum Fund withdrawals – based on projected investment returns and petroleum revenues – has been exceeded every year except one. From 2017 to 2021, the government withdrew $5.1 billion from the PF (1.9 times ESI), and the projected withdrawals for 2023 to 2027 would amount to $7.3 billion (3.4 times ESI). Withdrawals in 2022 reached a total of $1.4 billion (2.5 times ESI), marking the second-highest amount on record.\n\nSome policymakers still believe the country will receive substantial rents from petroleum and mining in the future, as it did from 2006 through 2014. However, this is unlikely to happen. The state continues to spend far more than domestic revenues and investment returns can support.\n\nTimor-Leste has been implementing a public sector-driven welfare regime. Social welfare is backed by public spending in various areas, including health care, which receives around 5% of the 2023 state budget; education, allocated 9%; and direct payments, such as those provided to veterans, young people, mothers and the elderly, which receive an 11% budgetary allocation.\n\nSome of these programs are politically motivated – such as the generous veterans’ pension, which was designed to buy peace and recognize those who carried out the struggle for national liberation. Additionally, a generous pension scheme has been established for former parliamentarians and public officeholders.\n\nA contributory social security regime for retired public and private employees was established in 2017, although not many people are currently receiving benefits due to the country’s young population and the small number of people in formal employment (subsistence and informal workers are not covered). Universal pensions for individuals over 60 experienced their first significant increase in 2023.\n\nThe majority of these systems are not available to non-citizens. The few foreigners in Timor-Leste (0.6% of the 2015 population) are rarely as poor as most Timorese citizens and thus rarely require social safety nets.\n\nReligious institutions, communities and extended families also provide informal support for those most in need.\n\nTo mitigate the economic impact of pandemic control measures, the government initiated in 2020 the distribution of a monthly basket containing food and necessities to all individuals, prioritizing the use of domestically sourced materials whenever feasible. The program has continued. Moreover, the state disbursed $200 to each household (with the exception of select highly compensated public employees) by the end of 2022.\n\nTimor-Leste is, to some extent, a dual society. The quarter of the population who live in the capital have greater access to education, employment and health care, as well as access to other opportunities compared to the rest of society, although even there women have fewer opportunities than men. Conversely, in rural areas, “customary” principles that discriminate based on gender, disability and age are still influential. The most affluent or well-connected individuals go overseas for health care and education.\n\nAbout 3% of the public education system receives aid from Portugal and operates in the Portuguese language, with significantly more resources than other public schools. These schools are limited to children with a Portuguese-speaking parent, which perpetuates the privileging of “assimilados,” which occurred during the Portuguese colonial period and ended nearly 50 years ago.\n\nSchool enrollment is higher for girls than boys – who are often put to work by their families. However, because many public schools do not have running water or functional toilets, some girls drop out when they reach puberty.\n\nPrivate-sector employment is a minor component of the broader economy. As reported by the government’s 2021 Business Activities Survey, the private sector employed 52,200 individuals, with males comprising 70% of the workforce, and 88% of these employees were located in Dili. While there is a noticeable increase in women’s employment, the number of men working in the private sector has declined by 23% since 2014, despite the working-age population growing by approximately 18% to around 850,000. A significant portion of the population, especially women, engage in informal work in outdoor markets, agriculture and domestic labor; however, a majority of these individuals are unpaid.\n\nTimor-Leste law requires that every third candidate on the party lists for parliamentary elections be a woman. Currently, there are 26 women in the 65-member parliament. However, women are poorly represented in leadership, holding only seven of the 45 top executive positions. Furthermore, they occupy a mere 2% of the elected suco chief positions in local government (community authorities). The public sector job distribution is heavily skewed toward men, with at least two-thirds of positions filled by them. This disparity is even more pronounced outside of the capital. At the same time, discrimination based on religion, ethnicity and race is less widespread than it is in Dili.\n\nAlthough discrimination is legally prohibited (except for against sexual orientation), political and family connections continue to be crucial for acquiring high-level public sector positions. This is partly due to the limited pool of educated and experienced individuals in the country. LGBTQ+ activists have increasingly challenged the absence of legal protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation, which were omitted from an early draft of Timor-Leste’s constitution in 2002. The impacts of pre-2002 colonialism and occupation are gradually diminishing, although individuals and companies associated with the ruling political parties have higher chances of obtaining employment and securing contracts than others.\n\nCompanies operating in Timor-Leste are permitted to hire non-citizens if they can demonstrate their inability to recruit Timorese citizens possessing the required skills.\n\nTimor-Leste’s economy relies on converting finite, non-renewable oil and gas resources into monetary assets. Oil production began in 2005, has been declining since 2014, and is projected to cease in 2023, though it could potentially resume if additional commercial reserves are discovered and developed. Timor-Leste’s fossil fuel resources have contributed significantly to the growth of the country’s Petroleum Fund, which currently amounts to approximately nine times the annual state budget. This fund serves to protect government spending from fluctuations in oil prices and investment revenues, at least for the time being. Although non-oil tax revenues have shown improvement in recent years, they still remain relatively low, with both individual and corporate taxes set at a flat rate of 10%.\n\nAlthough government debt and financial balances have mostly been managed responsibly to date, when the oil and gas wealth (half of which has been saved and invested) is exhausted, the situation will change drastically unless the domestic economy has been significantly diversified. In 2022, the Ministry of Finance began warning of a “fiscal cliff” that would force an 85% cut in public spending in 2035. Others have become more outspoken about this danger, which some fear could come sooner than the ministry expects.\n\nAlthough the 2019 maritime boundary agreement with Australia removed some obstacles to the exploitation of new oil and gas fields, Greater Sunrise remains the only reserve that might conceivably provide more than a small fraction of the $23 billion in revenues received from the depleted Bayu-Undan field. Progress on Greater Sunrise has been stalled for years due to debates over the appropriate mode of development and a lack of financing. Many hope that other undeveloped fields will provide significant revenues in the future, but this is doubtful. Exploration wells drilled in 2021/2022 have not found commercially viable deposits.\n\nAbout a quarter of the working-age population works in the formal economy, while a larger portion are subsistence farmers and fishers. The public and private sectors each employ approximately 10% of the working-age population. Women are more prevalent than men in low-paid occupations.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2021, employment by private sector businesses declined by 16% (government Business Activities Survey), even as the working-age population grew by 18%. The national median age of 21 highlights the specific challenges Timor-Leste faces in creating employment and education opportunities for young people.\n\nThe rapid growth of state spending has shrunk since 2012, which has had a ripple effect on the economy. State spending experienced a 30% drop from 2016 to 2020 due to political uncertainty and the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a 10% decline in non-oil, constant-price GDP. In the following two years, spending increased by 53%, but GDP only rose by 7%. Taking population growth into account, GDP per capita in 2022 was less than what it was 12 years earlier.\n\nMany internationally used statistical measures do not accurately represent the situation in Timor-Leste due to the dominance of offshore oil revenues and overseas investments, which are not consistently captured in GDP. The significant role of public spending in the formal economy and the substantial subsistence/informal sector also complicate the use of conventional measures.\n\nThe largest components of GDP are construction and public administration – paid for by the state – that are rising and falling with state spending. The productive sectors of agriculture and manufacturing are shrinking and are essentially unchanged since independence in 2002.\n\nState spending comprises the majority of the economy, exceeding 105% of non-oil GDP in 2022. Approximately 85% of the state budget is financed by withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund.\n\nSince 2015, the Petroleum Fund’s income has primarily originated from overseas financial investments, which experienced a significant decline in 2022. During the period from 2019 to 2021, the investment return was nearly three times that of oil and gas revenues. Nevertheless, it should be noted that this source of income may not be dependable in the future.\n\nFormal unemployment is higher in urban areas and among young people. Only about one-fourth of the working-age population is formally employed. Prices in Timor-Leste are usually higher than in neighboring countries and, after a decade of stability, began to increase in 2021/2022.\n\nAlthough some improvements have been made in curriculum and school enrollment rates, the education system, especially in rural areas and for impoverished people, is far from adequate. Primary schools exist throughout the country, but their quality is often poor. Repeated political revisions of curricula have made things worse. Most schools are grossly under-resourced, with large class sizes, few textbooks and in poor condition. Many teachers require additional training and experience. However, selective Portuguese-language public schools, serving about 3% of Timor-Leste students, receive special assistance from Portugal and high government allocations and thus have more resources than other schools. The same goes for Catholic and international schools, which are only accessible to families with money.\n\nIn 2018 and 2023, some government officials tried to make Portuguese the official language of instruction in all public schools – a move that many people are against. Significant grassroots and UNESCO efforts are underway to raise the profile of traditional languages.\n\nSecondary education is concentrated in the major cities, making it more difficult for many children to attend.\n\nThe standards of public and private universities are well below international norms. Students who have the opportunity usually attend overseas universities, often funded by the government or donors’ scholarships.\n\nEducation receives only 9% of the 2023 budget appropriations, although this allocation is higher in terms of dollars than it has been in the past. The government intends to increase the number of teachers and enhance the country’s educational infrastructure.\n\nThe literacy rate among young people (15- to 24-year-olds) is 84%, slightly higher for women than for men. Adult literacy stands at approximately 68% (UNICEF), with a higher rate for men compared to women. It is worth noting that many individuals did not receive education under Portuguese and Indonesian rule.\n\nR&D is limited, although the government has recently introduced a national research funding scheme. Bi-annual academic conferences and a small number of journals are raising the profile of R&D in the country. Academic positions at Timorese universities prioritize teaching over research, although Timorese researchers are publishing more extensively than before. The government has not yet enacted a comprehensive national research policy. There are few formal research training opportunities, including PhD programs, in Timorese higher education institutions.\n\nMany public and private projects rely on technical advisers from overseas.\n\nTimor-Leste is a small country and has been self-governing for only 21 years. Much of the over-30 population still suffers from PTSD and other damage from 24 years of Indonesian occupation and resistance, which was preceded by 400 years of Portuguese colonial rule; neither did much to develop human or economic resources. When the Indonesians withdrew in 1999, they destroyed all the electricity and communications infrastructure and burned down about 75% of the buildings.\n\nGiven this background, the new nation, including its political leaders, has done remarkably well in building a democratic state governed under the rule of law. However, they are still in an adolescent phase, and most of the principal political players were heroes of the independence struggle. They excelled at resistance but have habits of clandestine leadership, lack of consultation, and oppositional and hierarchical command – different skills than those optimal for peacetime democracy. Before 2000, very few citizens or leaders had ever lived under a government that even pretended to respond to its people; the learning curve is challenging.\n\nHowever, the median age of the population is 21. The postwar generation is now a significant voting bloc, playing a growing role in society and being socialized in a democratic environment.\n\nThe post-conflict nation began with widespread poverty and illness and a very small number of people with formal education or managerial experience. Virtually all the teachers returned to Indonesia in 1999. Although progress has been made and people are much freer than they were before 1999, household economies are less improved, especially for the majority who live in rural areas, largely through subsistence agriculture. Although most can access electricity and mobile phones (including expensive internet), water and rural roads are still lacking in many places.\n\nDespite many talented and dedicated senior public servants, the overall level of human resource development in the highly centralized public administration remains a challenge in terms of service provision. Education – both academic and technical – remains a major challenge with a large demographic “youth bulge,” under-resourced universities, and insufficient vocational training.\n\nThings could have been much worse – offshore oil and gas reserves have provided a temporary substitute for the inadequate local economy. Since 2005, Timor-Leste has received $24.9 billion in petroleum revenues, which were deposited into its Petroleum Fund, and has earned $7.5 billion in investment returns. $15 billion has been spent from the fund (paying for 85% of all state activities). If current trends continue, the fund could be entirely depleted within a decade.\n\nThis extractive windfall has created a popular mindset that cannot envision more sustainable economic development. The “resource curse” brings unrealistic expectations that rents from non-renewable mineral wealth will continue into the future. It constrains policy decisions that would invest in human resources, agriculture or sustainable industries.\n\nBecause of its size, relative isolation, young population and precautions taken, Timor-Leste had less community spread and fewer deaths from COVID-19 than most of the world. Natural disasters – and specifically the repeated flooding of Dili – have highlighted problems with urban planning and rural-urban migration to the capital. Although pandemic precautions created economic and social hardships, they also catalyzed the formation of a stable governing coalition and provided opportunities to advance toward sustainable policies.\n\nDuring the Indonesian occupation, there was no democratic space for civil society until 1997. After the 1999 independence referendum, a large number of groups formed, including many people who later went into government. Many CSOs are still active, but this brain drain, as well as the waning interest of international donors in Timor-Leste, has reduced their engagement. CSOs are registered with the Ministry of Justice, and most are members of the NGO Forum, which helps coordinate activities. Many Timorese NGOs rely on funding from the Timor-Leste government, discouraging them from taking actions that might discomfort the authorities.\n\nIn addition, there is a wide range of religious, veterans and sports associations. Political organizations, often connected to political parties, are also active.\n\nIn spite of this wide variety of opportunities for civic participation, most people struggle to survive day-to-day and do not engage. CSOs tend to rely more on paid staff than on volunteers.\n\nTimor-Leste is a dual society in which life in the capital city, exposed to ideas from overseas and forms of cosmopolitan life, contrasts with the majority of the country, which is predominantly rural and dominated by customary practices.\n\nThe state recognizes the legitimacy of traditional forms of community organization that do not contravene the constitution or the law. This arrangement enables non-state organizations to continue. Traditionally, participation in civic life was limited, and there was clear discrimination against women and young people. Formal state mechanisms for local authorities (such as suco councils – or village councils/community authorities) require female and youth members, but women are still rare in local leadership positions.\n\nSocial trust is fairly strong, although political and historical differences occasionally come to the fore. In particular, people who supported Indonesia’s occupation are often distrusted, although no actions are taken against them by the state or by individuals.\n\nIn 2010, the government produced a National Strategic Development Plan (2011 – 2030), but this plan is primarily aspirational, with many broad goals and no cost assessments or detailed paths to implementation. More than half the period covered by the plan has elapsed. In 2021, the Prime Minister’s Office found that only 26% of the 2015 and 2020 targets had been fully implemented, while another 23% had been achieved by 80%.\n\nThe principal political party in the governing coalition changed in 2017, 2018 and 2020, and most ministers changed as a result. Ministries are frequently awarded to coalition parties as a means to cement alliances. When a new political group assumes power, they often discard systems and human capacity that their predecessors had developed. However, the announced programs of each government are not very different, with the result that projects started by previous administrations often continue. The current government has announced ambitious legislative priorities for 2023 and plans to review the National Strategic Development Plan, which could be interrupted if the government fails to win a majority in the upcoming parliamentary election.\n\nSince 2009, under four different prime ministers, state budget allocations have favored large infrastructure projects. Although every government says that its priorities are health care, education, water supply and agriculture, in total these receive about one-sixth of state budget appropriations.\n\nWhile in power, CNRT-dominated governments have strongly promoted a major petroleum infrastructure project on the southern coast, which would require a capital investment of more than $18 billion, crowding out other significant economic development. The potential for social and economic return from this project is doubtful, but powerful political forces (including many uninformed citizens) support them, which is a manifestation of the “resource curse” thinking that resulted from the financial domination of petroleum over the last 15 years. Although the coalition formed in 2020 (without the CNRT) initially announced it would reassess the project, the government continues to promise that it will go ahead, although the state has spent very little on it since 2019. Delays are blamed on Australia and international oil companies, without acknowledging that the lack of financing demonstrates that international investors doubt the project is financially viable. In early 2023, the oil companies in the Sunrise Joint Venture began to re-evaluate options for developing the project. The informal power of CNRT leader and former resistance commander Xanana Gusmão is such that it is difficult for other political actors to reform core aspects of the Strategic Development Plan (and its centerpiece of the oil and gas megaproject on the southern coast). This remains true even when Gusmão’s CNRT is part of the opposition, as it is currently.\n\nBecause state spending makes up the majority of economic activity, rent-seeking by contractors, employees and pensioners is common. Decreased public disbursements since 2016 have led to widespread economic effects, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. From 2016 to 2021, inflation-adjusted government spending per capita dropped 21% and constant-price, non-oil GDP per capita fell 16%.\n\nAlthough the Petroleum Fund may finance the state for another decade, the limited private sector economic activity, low non-oil government revenue and the country’s dependency on imports will have serious consequences when the fund runs out – unless the economy is rapidly diversified or not-yet-developed oil and gas deposits turn out to be much more lucrative than expert observers expect. Although the Ministry of Finance and others have recently underscored the threat of a disastrous “fiscal cliff,” the government has not yet taken significant measures to avert, delay or ameliorate the situation.\n\nPolicy implementation remains challenging in Timor-Leste, despite defined strategic goals and elaborated public policies to respond to some of them. Plans involve both public spending and private or foreign direct investment. However, the only significant, functioning non-petroleum FDI project is a Heineken beverage plant, which opened in 2018. Construction on other promised large-scale projects has not yet begun. The Audit Chamber recently identified corruption in a major project, leading the government to withdraw the $50 million it had set aside for it. A container port, built by a public-private partnership, began operation in late 2022 but development of other non-road infrastructure has been repeatedly delayed and is often poorly implemented.\n\nThere are also longer-term problems with capacity to achieve strategic priorities. Although a few priorities (such as electrification and maritime boundary negotiation) have been largely achieved, broader goals regarding poverty, health care, economic diversification, decentralization and import substitution have seen little progress.\n\nEvery government in the last decade has underlined health care and education as top priorities, and recent ones have added water supply and agriculture to this list. However, these areas do not receive adequate funding (less than 18% of state budgets) or the needed political support for effective implementation. Although lip service is paid to economic diversification, governments have yet to develop policies that could move the country in that direction. It is much easier to pay for a few overseas scholarships or to send well-connected people abroad for medical treatment than it is to build a quality education or health care system that could serve the entire population. As noted above, Xanana Gusmão has turned the proposed southern coast petroleum development into a nationalist symbol, making it difficult for others to suggest different strategic directions, even when they are in power in government.\n\nBecause Indonesia had limited the authority (and experience) of Timorese administrators during the occupation, newly independent Timor-Leste relied on international advisers. International consultants remain a familiar presence in many government departments, although their number and influence have decreased significantly, and the power to make decisions rests with Timorese officials. As more Timorese people return from studying overseas, they bring back diverse policy knowledge, although many of them are sucked up by international organizations that pay better than the government bureaucracy.\n\nThere are positive stories of policy learning since independence, with Norway providing the model for the sovereign wealth fund under the first government. Subsequent changes made the fund less robust than before in terms of harboring Timor-Leste’s oil wealth for future generations, but it remains a policy success. In the main, however, when officials travel overseas to visit, for example, petroleum infrastructure projects, they are shown around by the proponents and owners of these projects and only hear about positive aspects. There is little interest or opportunity to learn about negative social, environmental or community impacts or about projects that did not fulfill their promises of wealth generation. Between 2015 and 2020, government leadership (most ministers) changed every year or two, making it hard to innovate or be flexible. In addition, experiential knowledge is often lost during transitions. Although the last three years have seen more stability, its longevity depends on the upcoming elections.\n\nCosmetic changes in mechanisms (such as creating a new agency rather than fixing a dysfunctional one) occur frequently, but deep, effective changes in policy or implementation are rare. The number of autonomous agencies (public institutes and enterprises) has greatly increased since 2015, splintering public administration and increasing the difficulty of oversight. In 2020, electricity and water supply were spun off from the Ministry of Public Works to become public enterprises, with no visible improvement in service delivery.\n\nIn 2021/2022, the administration restructured the state budget process based on “program-based budgeting,” but the success of implementation has been mixed, with some improvements and some steps backward. The redesign of several government websites in 2022 has made information harder to obtain and reduced transparency.\n\nThe Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (UPMA) in the Prime Minister’s Office became an autonomous agency (ANAPMA) in 2021. The agency is challenged by the limited monitoring and evaluation capacity of government entities and hopes to standardize and improve learning from past experience.\n\nThe quality and efficiency of the civil service and government bureaucracy are still substandard. The heritage of Portuguese colonial neglect, Indonesian corruption and Timorese resistance created an entrenched culture that has proven difficult to change.\n\nGovernment personnel receive more than one-third of allocations in the 2023 budget (32% for personnel and 5% for “professional services”). This cost is higher than the value of the services they provide. Recruitment draws from a limited pool of skilled applicants and is a mixture of competitive procedures and patronage. This, as well as a rigid hierarchy, often hinders effective management of human resources. The accountability of civil servants is gradually improving, but the accountability of political appointees who head ministries and departments is rare. Political dependency is significant, and politically-chosen leaders rarely listen to advice from technocrats with different perspectives.\n\nThe state budget process is opened to scrutiny only after the administration proposes it to parliament, and large changes are rarely made at that stage. Annual budget deficits are filled with money from the Petroleum Fund. State debt is relatively low, but petroleum revenues have dropped sharply as oil and gas wealth is depleted, and the Petroleum Fund could be empty within a decade.\n\nThe Audit Court, mandated to review public contracts over $5 million before they come into force, has prevented some significant mistakes, but some of its decisions have been overruled. Audit Court recommendations regarding state finances and performance are often not implemented. State accounts auditing and budget transparency are fairly good, although they have been deteriorating.\n\nBudget execution varied between 84% and 91% between 2014 and 2019; recurrent spending is executed higher than capital projects, which are often delayed. Execution dropped to 76% in 2020 and 71% in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After removing the invalidated Veterans Fund, it rose to 83% in 2022. Many execution problems stem from poor planning and budgetary design. However, previously limited assessments of the results or effectiveness of government programs, which often perform below expectations even when fully funded, may be expanding.\n\nDespite constitutional prescriptions mandating a multilevel public administration, Timor-Leste remains very centralized. Local government exists and is regulated by law, but it is not treated as the lowest administrative level but more as a formalization of “customary rights.” Local leaders have little decision-making capacity or authority, and their only source of funding, the national government, allocates little. Donors and others have long advocated more decentralization to an intermediate municipal level, but national governments have been reluctant to devolve much responsibility to regional or local authorities.\n\nThe one exception is the Oecusse enclave surrounded by Indonesia, which has less than 6% of Timor-Leste’s population and has been “autonomous” since 2015 under a nationally appointed regional authority funded by the national budget. This prototype of local autonomy has built an airport, bridges, roads and a power plant, but has not significantly developed the local economy, attracted foreign investors or improved the living standards of the local population.\n\nThe government is challenged by conflicting objectives: the strategic plan to build megaprojects, public spending intended to attract private investment, economic diversification, human resource development, and the basic needs of an impoverished population. Budgetary allocations often differ from stated policy priorities.\n\nPolicy coordination is relatively weak and further challenged by the political reality of multiparty coalition governments. However, a few ministers are working to improve communication and coordination across the government, as is the Agency for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (Agência Nacional de Planeamento, Monitorização e Avaliação/ANAPMA). Most coordination is vertical through ANAPMA or powerful ministers, rather than horizontal between ministries with specific portfolios. In particular, the prime minister and the minister for the presidency of the Council of Ministers are powerful actors in policy coordination, and success often depends on their capacity and performance. Limited technical expertise in the civil service makes it harder to coordinate, although this is gradually improving.\n\nIn some areas, such as environmental licensing and budgetary management, institutions in the petroleum sector have assumed authority that would logically belong to others.\n\nThe 2021 and 2022 state budgets were enacted on time, but the government proposed revisions during the first half of each year, leading parliament to amend the budgets. The 2021 revision, justified by the pandemic and flooding, reallocated funding from other areas to relief measures. In 2022, however, a revision added $1.2 billion (a 58% increase), most of which was for a brand new Veterans Fund rushed through before the newly elected president took office. Six months later, the Court of Appeal ruled that the Veterans Fund violated the constitutional requirements for “proportionality” (allocating money without a clear explanation of the benefits from it) and “fair and equitable use of natural resources” (since the money, derived from oil revenues, would benefit a small fraction of the population). As a result, it has not been established or funded.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic motivated the government to provide additional assistance to families and businesses. These schemes were administered in a relatively efficient manner. Some were extended even after the pandemic was largely over.\n\nAlthough annual state budgets have included a volume of annual action plans for over a decade, only in 2022 did the first Major Planning Actions Law, part of a newly revised, program-based budgeting process, come into effect. This pilot run had limited success (it lists 263 measures without indicating their allocations or importance) but may prove to be a valuable learning experience.\n\nThe Provedor (Ombudsman) and Anti-Corruption Commission investigate alleged mismanagement and corruption but can only refer cases to the prosecutor. However, there is often leniency toward well-connected people involved in corruption, with the result that prosecution is not always undertaken or effective. Although a number of officials, including ministers, have been prosecuted and convicted, mostly for relatively small cases, petty corruption is common, and the perception that large violations are occurring is widespread. Minor infractions like personal use of government cars tend to attract more public ire and attention than substantial forms of corruption.\n\nState spending is nominally audited by parliament, which must approve the state accounts for the previous year, as well as by the Audit Chamber in the Court of Appeal, which also has prior review power for large state contracts. However, the capacity and thoroughness of these audits are limited, and their recommendations are frequently ignored.\n\nIn 2020, Timor-Leste enacted an anti-corruption law, bringing the country into compliance with the U.N. Convention Against Corruption that it had joined in 2009.\n\nIn October 2022, the Audit Chamber reported embezzlement and corruption involving public financing of a yet-to-be-built cement plant, but no charges have yet been brought. The state will withdraw most of the funding allocated for the project.\n\nParty financing is limited to the electoral period and is subject to little regulation. There is public financing as well as private donations, and reporting requirements are not effectively enforced.\n\nConflict-of-interest regulations are rarely effective. High public officials must declare their assets to a court, but the declarations are not made public.\n\nPublic procurement is usually transparent and merit-based, but contracts sometimes bypass the formal system or are conducted through political mechanisms. A public procurement website intermittently contains information on some tenders, but it is difficult to use.\n\nSimilarly, laws that require environmental licenses for major projects are often violated without sanction by both public and private proponents.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, Timor-Leste fell on the Open Budget Survey’s oversight ranking. Although the score improved slightly in 2021, it is still considered inadequate because there is no independent supreme audit institution.\n\nTransparency, access to information, and audits of state spending have deteriorated in recent years, although they are still better than in most comparable countries. Although civil society organizations and journalists occasionally bring information on corruption to light, this is unusual, and the local media rarely undertakes investigative reporting.\n\nAlthough there are significant political differences over the urgency and means to diversify away from dependence on petroleum money, there is consensus on democracy in theory. Democracy is working remarkably well for a 21-year-old nation emerging from centuries of foreign autocratic rule and a generation of brutal war.\n\nIn spite of occasionally bitter and vehement partisan disputes, all current political actors support the constitution, the electoral system and the rule of law. Although many rural, impoverished people are not well-served by the political system, they do not question its structure or basis. Participation in elections remains very high, exceeding many other voluntary jurisdictions in the region and beyond: 77% of registered voters turned out for the 2022 presidential election, the highest turnout since 2007.\n\nVirtually everybody in the Timor-Leste elite agrees with market economy principles, although they do not always apply at the rural and community level, where subsistence and bartering are widespread. Although the government encourages cooperatives, they are relatively small and often based around extended families.\n\nThere is a consensus behind joining ASEAN, with the unrestricted trade and travel that membership will bring.\n\nAt present, most non-subsistence economic activity is driven by state spending, and rent-seeking dominates private sector decisions. In 2016, the first significant non-oil FDI took place (a Heineken brewery), and a public-private container port began operation in 2022. Other promised projects have not proceeded, despite the promise of significant government investment. State-subsidized projects in the petroleum sector, as well as ones to build electricity, roads, airports and other infrastructure, are usually contracted to the international private sector.\n\nSome government services, such as water and electricity, were recently spun off to public enterprises, which could eventually lead to privatization. Although some in civil society question these and other PPPs, most major political actors support these initiatives.\n\nIn Timor-Leste, there are very few important actors who assume anti-democratic stances, although Xanana Gusmão – former military commander, president and prime minister, currently without a portfolio – has influenced Timor-Leste’s otherwise democratic institutions, even from the opposition, due to his substantial charisma. Internal decision-making of most political parties tends to be centralized in one leader, but the proportional electoral system means the balance of power is spread among several parties, and their internal mechanisms do not encroach on the democratic processes of society.\n\nGovernment policies have favored the emergence of a new entrepreneurial group and small middle-class population, which are linked to the operation of a democratic polity and thus have widened the social basis of democracy, although the rural majority remains largely disempowered.\n\nFormer military officers (e.g., Lú-Olo, Taur Matan Ruak, Lere Anan Timur and Xanana Gusmão) have donned civilian clothes to compete for electoral positions and do not seriously threaten democratic consolidation. However, as in most states that achieve self-government after a long resistance struggle, the personal power of the heroes of liberation can undercut democracy for as long as they remain on the scene. Occasional policy suggestions to introduce national military service, for example, reflect these biases but have not acquired any traction. The disproportionate political power, resource allocation and policy space granted to the petroleum sector also erodes democracy.\n\nThe constitution designed a political system that offers room for the accommodation of different interests and different power bases within the executive. The ensuing institutions have been reasonably capable of managing dissent within democratic rule.\n\nAlthough politicians and parties occasionally challenge democratic actions in the courts, the courts almost always rule on the merits and legalities of the case. Legal processes are followed, and their decisions are respected.\n\nThe greatest cleavage is between urban and rural, which correlates strongly with economic class. This can be seen in differences in livelihoods (government spending vs. subsistence farming), poverty and access to public services (education, health, water and transportation). However, it is not reflected in the political system, and leaders have been able to defuse or prevent all significant challenges for more than a decade. No political party represents the rural majority, although KHUNTO has a base among some rural communities, as well as among urban youth.\n\nConflict is largely averted through disempowerment, patronage and co-optation. Even when people disagree with the national consensus, they are unlikely to resort to conflict.\n\nPolitical polarization is sometimes high, with tensions between FRETILIN and CNRT politicians. Smaller parties, including PLP, PD and KHUNTO, can align with either side. The current majority coalition, including FRETILIN, PLP and KHUNTO, may change after the 2023 election.\n\nAlthough partisan polarization has been contained within the normal institutional framework, it can have significant social and economic impacts, such as when it delayed the enactment of the state budget in 2020.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, President Lú-Olo Guterres, the first elected president from a party leadership (FRETILIN), refused to approve several of Taur Matan Ruak’s ministerial nominations from the CNRT based on allegations of corruption. The conflict between the president and prime minister was contained within the constitution and ended when a 2020 rearrangement brought the president’s party into power. In 2022, Lú-Olo lost his re-election bid to former President José Ramos-Horta, who was supported by the CNRT. The new president is strongly informed by the desire for consensus-building, and this remains true in his current term.\n\nAlthough partisan rhetoric can be heated at lower party levels and on social media, the country’s political divisions are like those in many other multiparty parliamentary democracies. Competent, independent and widely trusted electoral administration agencies are effective at minimizing partisan conflict in the immediate wake of elections.\n\nCivil society has significant space for self-organization. Students and young people vociferously protest perceived injustices, especially the privileges of current or former officeholders. Protestors are occasionally arrested or beaten. However, poor and rural people are less organized, vocal and influential than students and young people.\n\nBecause 97% of Timor-Leste’s population is Catholic, the Church has substantial influence in agenda-setting and policy formulation, especially in areas like education, abortion and family planning.\n\nCommunity-level authorities have been integrated, to a large extent, into the democratic process but have limited budgets and limited capacity to resolve issues locally. The banning of political parties at the local level has helped reduce partisan conflict in traditional communities. Community authorities often promote policy decisions made by the public administration. However, local conflict mediation by traditional leaders occasionally bypasses legal justice processes.\n\nSince 2015, a government-supported, NGO-implemented social audit has reported on the implementation of some government programs, but the findings have little impact.\n\nCivil society groups actively debate policy issues. They have frequent access to political leaders, partly due to the small size of the country and the elite. However, formal mechanisms for public involvement in policymaking have narrowed in recent years, with fewer public hearings and consultations by the government and parliament. Many civil society groups do not have enough resources and knowledge to propose detailed policy alternatives. La’o Hamutuk and Fundasaun Mahein are important exceptions here.\n\nAcademics, scientists and professional institutions have less influence over public policy, although they contribute to educating the media and the citizenry. As the generation of resistance leaders ages, more space opens up for intellectuals and younger people.\n\nNevertheless, there are lively debates (and no censorship) in both traditional and social media, in which the leadership participates.\n\nTimor-Leste was born through a dramatic process of liberation, which began when the Portuguese dictatorship was ousted in 1974 and Lisbon began to decolonize. This was followed by Indonesia’s large-scale illegal invasion and occupation (1975 – 1999), which killed about a quarter of Timor-Leste’s people. After the United Nations supervised a referendum in 1999, in which 78.5% voted for independence, Timor-Leste and the United Nations set up a Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation (CAVR), which produced a detailed report with many recommendations. CAVR did not have the power to grant amnesty for serious crimes (which were referred to the prosecutor) or pursue perpetrators residing in Indonesia. Greater success was evident in the reception of lower-level offenders, who were required to confess their crimes to be received back into their villages.\n\nDuring the U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor (1999 – 2002) and for a few years afterward, internationally supported prosecutors and courts dealt with some of the most high-profile crimes committed during the last year of Indonesian occupation. They indicted 391 people, including several senior Indonesian military leaders. However, all of the 87 brought to trial were Timorese, of whom 84 were convicted. None are in prison today. In Indonesia, an ad hoc human rights court conducted some sham trials, convicting no one. Although international officials promised in the first few years after 1999 that there would be no impunity, international attention has turned away from Timor-Leste.\n\nThe devastating legacy of the brutal Indonesian occupation remains: PTSD, disabilities, destroyed families and property, and disempowerment. Most of the perpetrators remain at large in Indonesia, where some hold positions of power. As time passes (the majority of Timorese people are too young to remember the hardships personally) and Indonesia becomes less democratic, these issues fade further into the background.\n\nAfter the CAVR report was issued in 2005, the governments of Indonesia and Timor-Leste formed a Truth and Friendship Commission to discuss cases of human rights abuses in 1999, but Indonesia has refused to fulfill most of its commitments. Nevertheless, most Timorese leaders see no alternative to subservient relations with Jakarta, often submerging their own human rights or other principles to seek favors from the largest regional power, which is also Timor-Leste’s largest trading partner. In 2022, President Ramos-Horta awarded a medal of merit to a former Indonesian general who had overseen numerous atrocities during the occupation and was strongly criticized by civil society.\n\nSome recommendations from CAVR have been pursued by successive Timorese governments, and reconciliation remains on the government agenda. However, the recommendations directed toward the international community have been largely ignored. In recent years, the Centro Nacional Chega!, established to oversee post-CAVR activities, has primarily served an educational function, although it is advocating for material support for some victims of the occupation.\n\nAnother aspect of this issue is the attention paid to those killed in the struggle for independence. The state has made substantial efforts to pay tribute to their memories, appeasing demands for the prosecution of perpetrators. As a rule, however, military veterans of the struggle against Indonesia receive much more vocal recognition than civilian clandestine resistance figures or civilian victims.\n\nAlthough partisan disputes are sometimes heated, the laws and constitution are respected, and three changes of government have occurred since 2017 without violence.\n\nInternational aid played a major role in Timor-Leste between 1999 and 2006, but the amount and importance of aid declined after oil revenues increased. Donor contributions (direct budget support plus donor-run projects) averaged 12% of the combined sources budget between 2016 and 2022 (down from 80% between 2003 and 2006).\n\nFor a decade, Timor-Leste has been a world leader in the international movement by fragile states (G-7+ group) to make assistance more responsive to their needs. Consequently, most development partners follow the government’s lead. Timorese authorities meet regularly with donors to discuss medium- to long-term development strategies.\n\nIn sectors such as education and agriculture, the government sometimes rationalizes its own underfunding because donors support programs in those sectors, even though most donor programs lack the national reach or sustainability necessary for significant development.\n\nDonors tend to focus on different sectors, such as water, security and governance (Australia), education (Portugal), agriculture (Germany) or infrastructure (Japan). Many U.N. and multilateral agencies have programs in the country.\n\nIn 2022, Timor-Leste and the United States Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a $420 million, five-year aid agreement, the largest in the country’s history, primarily for water, sanitation and education.\n\nThe government maintains an Aid Transparency Portal, which provides information on donor programs and spending, and publishes a book on international support as part of the annual state budget package.\n\nPrevious governments built large infrastructure projects and hoped that petroleum extraction and processing would anchor future economic development. However, donors (but not lenders) have usually avoided these areas, preferring to fund governance and training, education, health, water supply, sanitation and agriculture.\n\nThe political leadership of Timor-Leste actively promotes good relations with its two much larger neighbors (Indonesia and Australia), both of whom supported the brutal occupation from 1975 to 1999.\n\nIn 2018, Timor-Leste resolved a long-standing dispute with Australia over establishing a permanent maritime boundary. Good relations are demonstrated by the cross-border movement of people and capital, with Indonesian and Australian goods, contracting companies and workers moving to Timor-Leste, and Timorese nationals studying in Indonesia and working in Australia. Nearly all commercial flights to Timor-Leste depart from Indonesia or Australia, though these were cut back during the pandemic.\n\nTimor-Leste has made joining ASEAN a policy priority for more than a decade, although the reluctance of some ASEAN members has delayed this. In November 2022, ASEAN agreed “in principle” to admit Timor-Leste as a member, though subject to meeting certain “milestones,” which would be assessed by member states. Dili hopes that Indonesia’s leadership of ASEAN in 2023 will facilitate its finally achieving membership in the regional body. Although it has opted to align with Asia rather than the Pacific, the country also takes part in forums in the Asia-Pacific region, including holding observer status in the Pacific Island Forum and Melanesian Spearhead Group.\n\nIn late 2022, after Indonesia announced that it would not seek re-election to the U.N. Human Rights Council, Timor-Leste announced its candidacy. However, three months later, the Indonesian government changed its mind. Timor-Leste then withdrew and endorsed its former occupier.\n\nTimor-Leste is a key member of the Coral Triangle Initiative on marine environmental issues and initiated the TIA-GT (Timor-Leste, Indonesia and Australia Growth Triangle) economic development group.\n\nTimor-Leste is heavily dependent on imported goods and services, most of which come from nearby countries, especially Indonesia.\n\nTimor-Leste is one of the world’s smallest and youngest nations, with one of the world’s youngest populations. As a highly petroleum-dependent country, Timor-Leste will face severe hardships when its Petroleum Fund is exhausted.\n\nThe small political elite, most of whom have been rivals since high school in the 1960s, are aging and have begun to devolve power to the next generation, which includes many technocrats educated since the 1990s. Programs will begin to outweigh personalities, political parties will become more internally democratic, and coalition-building will overcome resistance traditions and some of the divisive legacies of the 1970s. Optimists expect that evidence-based decision-making will replace the wishful thinking and personal allegiances that have shaped policy direction to date. The next parliamentary elections, in which 17 parties were competing, were scheduled for May 2023, though it seems unlikely that they will produce dramatic policy shifts.\n\nIt will take several years for the economy to recover from five years of negative growth. Although the Petroleum Fund could cover the recovery period, the fund is unlikely to last more than 10 years. Without this cushion from non-renewable oil and gas wealth, Timor-Leste may be unable to meet the basic needs of its population. If stock markets fall further or politicians “invest” in megaprojects without returns, insolvency could occur even sooner.\n\nThe previous generation of leaders chose to hire foreign companies to construct major projects, such as national roads, airports, power plants and petroleum infrastructure, instead of focusing on developing the country’s human capital and implementing decentralized service delivery, which are crucial to its future. While citizens are increasingly demanding the government uphold their social and economic human rights, and although recent administrations have verbally acknowledged the need to do this, adjustments must be made to budget allocations. Enhancing human capital will augment the country’s ability to propel economic growth. Administrative decentralization, aimed at promoting regional development and mitigating migration into Dili, is long overdue.\n\nLarge-scale pending projects, many of which have been delayed for years – including the Suai petroleum supply base, Pelican Paradise resort, Betano oil refinery and most of the south coast highway – will require tens of billions of dollars to build. However, they have not attracted sufficient foreign investment and should be carefully studied before the finite wealth of the Petroleum Fund is used to underwrite them. Objective, impartial, fact-based, realistic cost/benefit/risk evaluations – including environmental and social aspects and missed opportunity costs – are rare in Timor-Leste. But implementing them is essential if the remainder of the nation’s petroleum birthright is to be used, as the 2005 Petroleum Fund Law says six times, “for the benefit of current and future generations.”\n\nA serious effort is required to diversify the economy and develop the non-oil sectors based on Timor-Leste’s greatest asset – its people. Currently undeveloped oil and gas resources, including Sunrise, might fund the country for a few more years, but they cannot match the amount of revenue already received. To narrow its trade deficit, Timor-Leste could reduce imports by strengthening agriculture and light industry to meet domestic needs and by replacing electricity generated from imported diesel fuel with renewable energy. Community-based tourism could generate much-needed foreign exchange.\n\nUnfortunately, the last 16 years of converting oil and gas wealth into dollars have created a rent-seeking mentality – the expectation of income without hard work. Many politicians and citizens are unwilling or unable to envision the future, despite its inevitability, without oil money.\n\nBefore Rui Gomes became finance minister in September 2020, he developed an economic recovery plan to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan prioritizes human capital, agriculture, tourism, housing, education, health and social protection instead of costly physical infrastructure. It presents “public policy measures that may facilitate the essential economic and social transformation of our country, aiming to enhance both its income and development while promoting greater human well-being.” However, over two years have passed since then, and minimal progress has been made toward achieving those crucial objectives."
