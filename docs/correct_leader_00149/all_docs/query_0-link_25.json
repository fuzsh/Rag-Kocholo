        "meta_description": "On 23 June 2006 the UN proudly launched its Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) seeking to reverse a situation where international efforts to rebuild war-torn societies had, more often than not, failed. Mindful of such cases as Haiti, Cambodia, Somalia, and Liberia, where security deteriorated once international support was withdrawn, obviously the drafters of the PBC had much to learn from the East Timor (Timor-Leste) example. This was highlighted by the massive civil unrest sparked off in East Timor in early 2006, returning to world attention in February 2008 with the near assassination of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (RDTL) president and the continuing humanitarian crisis.Initially, only Burundi and Sierra Leone came under the purview of the PCB, although emergency funding had also been advanced to Ivory Coast and the Central African Republic. In December 2007, Guinea-Bissau, became the third country to win PBC support as a state in danger of backsliding into violence. Given the ad hoc nature of past UN missions in East Timor/Timor-Leste, the hybrid character of security operations conducted independent of the UN flag, and the general lack of governance capacity inside the new nation, this article explicitly argues in favor of extending PBC commitment to Timor-Leste.",

In the words of its charter, the PBC will “marshal resources at the disposal of the international community to advise and propose integrated strategies for post-conflict recovery, focusing attention upon reconstruction, institution-building, and sustainable development in countries emerging from conflict”. As an advisory body made up of 31 member countries including four permanent members of the Security Council, and currently chaired by Japan, the PBC purports to offer tailor-made solutions to target countries making the transition from war to peace.\n\nList of Acronyms\n\nASDT, Associação Social-Democrata Timorense, Timorese Social Democratic Association\n\nAsean, Association of Southeast Asian Nations\n\nCAVR, Comissão de Acolhimento、Verdade e Reconciliação de Timor-Leste, Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor\n\nCNRT, Conselho Nacional de Reconstrução do Timor, National Congress for the Reconstruction of Timor\n\nCTF, Commission of Truth and Friendship\n\nFalintil, Forças armadas de libertação para a independência de Timor Leste, Liberation Armed Forces for the Independance of East Timor\n\nF-FDTL, Falintil-Forças de Defenças de Timor-Leste, Falintil-East Timor Defence Forces\n\nFretilin, Frente Revolutionária do Timor-Leste Independente, Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor\n\nGDP, Gross Domestic Product\n\nGNR, Guardia Nacional da República, National Republican Guard\n\nIDP, Internally Displaced Persons\n\nISF, International Stabilization Force\n\nLNG, Liquid Natural Gas\n\nMunj, Movement for Unity and Justice\n\nPD, Partido Democrático, Democratic Party\n\nPBC, Peacebuilding Commission\n\nPMA, Parliamentary Majority Alliance\n\nPNTL, Polícia Nacional de Timor-Leste, National Police of East Timor\n\nPSD, Partido Social Democrata, Social Democratic Party\n\nRamsi, Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomons Islands\n\nRDTL, República Democrática de Timor-Leste, Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste\n\nSRSG, Special Representative of the Secretary-General\n\nUDT, União Democrática Timorense, Timorese Democratic Union\n\nUN, United Nations\n\nUnamet, United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor\n\nUnmiset, United Nations Support Mission in East Timor\n\nUnmit, United Nations Integrated Mission in East Timor\n\nUnotil, United Nations Office in East Timor\n\nUnpol, United Nations Police\n\nUntaet, United Nations Transitional Administration for East Timor\n\nBackground\n\n3Born out of a 24-year guerrilla struggle (1976-1999) against Indonesian occupation, and an essentially Western-backed humanitarian intervention in the wake of the Indonesian military-militia violence following the UN-conducted ballot for independence in 1999, and surviving on a lifeline of international goodwill through independence from UN rule in May 2002, and again following wrenching internal violence commencing in mid-2006, the former Portuguese half-island Southeast Asian colony of East Timor has faced hard choices in meeting regional challenges. In part, this is a reference to relations with Muslim-majority Indonesia and, in part, reference to Australia, a major aid donor and contributor to its small northern neighbor in the security sector, but also a country that has played hardball in the negotiation of contested maritime boundaries and in the sharing of oil and gas revenues, crucial for the new nation’s survival.\n\nCrisis of 2006 Revisited\n\n8Much hubris can be attached to the act of some 400 F-FDTL deserters who demonstrated in Dili on 8 February 2006 demanding a response to their January petition alleging regional discrimination. They were joined on 25 February by an additional 177 deserters, rising to 591 (or some 40% of the total) by mid-March. At this point, evidently following UN advice, the deserters were dismissed by the commander of the armed forces with the backing of the Prime Minister. But far from being disarmed and arrested, the “Petitioner” group around their spokesperson Major Gastão Salsinha, Major August Tara de Araujo, and Major Marcos Tilman joined on 4 May by Australian-trained Major Alfredo Alves Reinado emerged as actors in their own right, creating the seeds of the disaster-to-come. From their mountain bases above Dili, they rallied rural and urban supporters, built alliances and, in the case of Reinado, even courted President Gusmão and Foreign Minister Ramos-Horta, who made his first contact with the renegade leader and his military police deserters on 12 May, a prelude of the disastrous shadow diplomacy which was to follow. Graduate of an Australian Command and Staff College training program, Reinado also won the protection of arriving Australian military. On 1 June Reinado claimed to be loyal to President Gusmção and, upping the ante on Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri, stated he wouldn’t surrender arms until the latter resigned. Gusmão and Ramos-Horta seemed to be falling in line, if they were not leading.\n\n10In late March, violent incidents provoked by the Petitioner group in Dili led to the arrest of 48 including 8 members of the dismissed F-FDTL. On 28-29 April violent riots in Dili by hundreds of dismissed F-FDTL and supporters led to 5 dead and 60 injured in a clash with PNTL leading to some 100 houses burnt or damaged and with residents fleeing the city. This was one day after the Petitioner group rejected a government offer to establish a high-level commission to investigate alleged regional discrimination. Meantime, with morale sapped and loyalties divided, the PNTL commenced to disintegrate with many members going over to the Petitioner group, and with others disarmed, leaving it virtually bereft of command structure. Even the police chief abandoned his post.\n\n12By 5 May some 21,000 residents had fled Dili responding to rumors of an impending clash between military and police. They had good reason as, on 24 May, rebels led by Reinado fought loyalist military at their barracks at Taci Tolo. Violence irrupted again on 25 May with 10 unarmed PNTL officers gunned down in cold blood by F-FDTL loyalists as they left PNTL headquarters under the UN flag in a botched surrender agreement brokered by United Nations Police (Unpol). Another 27 were left wounded, including two Unpol officers in this shocking incident which prompted the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG), Hasegawa Sukehiro, to demand a full accounting by the RDTL government to determine responsibility and accountability.\n\n13Arguably, it was the decision of the Security Council to prematurely terminate the United Nations Office in East Timor (Unotil) mission (May 2005-August 2006) on the advice of Australia and Japan over the reservations of the Secretary-General, that allowed events to spin out of control; resulting in civil breakdown, some 30 deaths, some thousand houses destroyed, massive population dislocation; and the call for fresh military and international humanitarian intervention. Confronted with the prospect of a “failed state,” as discussed below, consensus emerged in the Security Council to mandate a fresh UN mission. Notwithstanding the political risk involved in this fragile environment, priority was given to overseeing fresh elections. Just as elections in politically vulnerable settings should not be seen as a general panacea, however beloved of the international community, Unotil nevertheless began to prepare the country for both presidential and legislative elections. There was also recognition of the necessity to consummate the rebuilding of failed institutions in the attempt to achieve the kind of sustainable development necessary to break the cycle of unemployment and poverty that helped to fuel the violence. But as well recognized, the underlying cause of the crisis of 2006 lay with the security sector and the rebuilding of this sector was at the heart of Security Council discussions on the new mission. The crisis was not without domestic fallout. Amid much acrimony, including claims of coup d’État, six weeks after a call for foreign intervention to stabilize the security situation, the elected RDTL Prime Minister, Mari Alkatiri, was obliged to step down.\n\nThe Australian (Re)-Intervention\n\n14With the security situation out of control, on 24 May 2006 the RDTL government formally requested security assistance from Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia. The legal basis of this assistance takes the form of “exchange of letters” between Canberra and Dili of 25 May. Reminiscent of its 1999 intervention in East Timor, Australia, which had pre-positioned ships off Timor island, was the first to respond and as the so-called “lead nation” assumed overall command of an International Stabilization Force (ISF) comprising some 2,500 Australian soldiers out of a total of 3,200 international forces, alongside 500 international police answering to UN command. Portugal subsequently sent a police detachment, the Guardia Nacional da República (GNR), operating under its own mandate. With the arrival of an advance party of 150 Australian commandos on 25 May, the rules of engagement were hastily drawn up at a meeting at Dili airport involving the Australian Military Commander, the RDTL Foreign Minister, and the SRSG. On 26 May, following the signing of a formal Status of Forces Arrangement with Australia, the RDTL government handed over responsibility for security in Dili to Australian troops. It should be noted that “Operation Astute” – as it was known – did not operate under UN control, nor was it mandated by any Security Council resolution. The model would be that of the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands or Ramsi, a dual military-civilian stabilization force invited by the government of this Pacific country (but also criticized by some politicians for its heavy handedness).\n\n16Notwithstanding the international military and police presence, violence flared with “gangs and thugs” – to use the words of the Australian force commander – engaging in widespread acts of violence, arson and intimidation, often against adversaries, perhaps better known to themselves than outsiders. Although such violence was often parlayed in the media – and by the President himself – as a fundamental ethnic clash between east and west, it was obvious that opponents of Fretilin, ranging from the Petitioner groups to the PD party and the usual culprits including pro-Indonesia martial arts gangs found the perfect pretext to settle scores. Fataluku-speaking migrants to Dili from the east became an easy target triggering an exodus; havenots lined up against haves, looting and burning seemingly at will, but selectively as well.\n\n17Even so, Australia faced down international condemnation for not protecting such sensitive government buildings as the offices of the Attorney General (where computers and court records were looted), along with ministries of development, agriculture, the national police headquarters, as well as rice warehouses. More astute observers began to read into this situation one of economic desperation on the part of urban unemployed. Added to that, a generation of children outside of formal education, also proved capable of being drawn into a cycle of violent behavior.\n\n18Needless to say, the state apparatus and public services were seriously disrupted in Dili, although services held up better in most of the districts. Shooting incidents, house burnings and even the stoning of relief workers by youths, continued through July 2006. With 150,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) or some 15 percent of the country’s population, squatting in some 57 mostly fringe urban camps, the humanitarian problem taken into hand by a range of UN and other international agencies also became one of dependency as IDPs refused or were too fearful of returning home.\n\nRegime Change\n\n23Ironies of the situation abound. Days before the devastating violence, Alkatiri had been congratulated by the visiting World Bank President in Dili basically for adhering to Bank policies on lean government, fiscal frugality and pro-market policies. The DRTL under Alkatiri was no experiment in socialism. In fact, if the Fretilin majority government erred, as now appears apparent, it was because it consistently ran budget surpluses. To be sure, as Alkatiri asserts, his administration was literally reborn put of the ashes, and much was achieved in five short years.\n\n24On 30 May, Gusmão declared a 30-day “state of emergency” subsequently rolled on for another 30 days by the newly sworn-in Council of State, taking control of the army. The following day, the ministers of defense Roque Rodriques (1 June) and interior Rogério Lobato (2 June) resigned with Jose Ramos-Horta (10 June) taking the defense portfolio with Alcino Barris assuming the post of Minister of Interior. This seemed appropriate as the two individuals in charge of security had obviously failed their respective offices, although it could also be said that the international community had also failed to safeguard the integrity of their offices.\n\n28Arriving from the east in large truck convoys, supporters of Fretilin were emotionally addressed by Alkatiri instructing them to desist from violence and prepare for the forthcoming elections. On 29 June 20,000 Fretilin supporters peacefully massed in the city before retiring. In the circumstances this was a magnanimous gesture as a Fretilin show of violence would undoubtedly have provoked a bloody clash or even civil war type of confrontation. But the contradiction cannot be lost, that while the Australian-led task force cosseted the anti-Fretilin rallies in the name of democratic rights, they did their best to quarantine the city from the arriving pro-Fretilin forces.\n\n30With the swearing in of a new cabinet on 10 July (Second Constitutional Government), Fretilin was well represented with the post of foreign minister going to the Timorese ambassador to the UN, and Alkatiri rival, Jose Luis Guterres and with the new post of first Deputy Prime Minister awarded to Fretilin stalwart, Estanislau da Silva, with Rui de Araujo assuming the post of Second Deputy Prime Minister. Ending much speculation, Ramos-Horta (non Fretilin) was confirmed as Prime Minister, an appointment widely hailed in Canberra.\n\n31As the security situation stabilized, the Joint Task force sought different armed groups to surrender their weapons voluntarily. Major Reinado was the first faction leader to partially comply. Self-styled “death squad” leader Rai-Los also handed over some weapons in a ceremony in Liquisa on 14 July. At the end of a two month amnesty period (late July), following an action by the GNR, Australian forces arrested Reinado and followers on possession of firearms charges. The Dili District Court indicted him on multiple charges including murder and embezzlement of firearms. Astonishingly, the rebel leader who precipitated the crisis and whose premeditated actions sparked the urban violence, followed rather than preceded the Interior Minister and Prime Minister to the Dili Court. The anti-Fretilin Youth for Justice and Peace group rallied in Dili protesting Reinado’s innocence.\n\nUN Response to the Crisis of 2006\n\n32While, as mentioned, on 24 May 2006 the RDTL government requested Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal to send troops and police to help calm the situation, it was only on 26 May that the Security Council offered its blessing to Dili’s request, just as the following day the beleaguered UN mission in Dili announced that the majority of its staff would be withdrawn from the country. On 28 May, the SRSG requested international police force reinforcements. In the face of a mounting humanitarian crisis, especially relating to the spike in numbers of IDPs, a Danish national was appointed Humanitarian Coordinator for East Timor.\n\n34Following a request from the RDTL government, the UN established an independent special inquiry commission to review the incidents of late April and May 2006 as well as other events that contributed to the crisis. A three-person commission, led by Paulo Sergio Pinheiro of Brazil, was appointed on 28 June, with a brief to report by October. With Security Council approval, the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Timor-Leste, Ian Martin (simultaneously head of the UN Human Rights Office in Nepal and former head of the UN mission in East Timor in 1999), was dispatched to Dili to assess the situation and report back.\n\n35Confronted by the prospect of a failed state, a consensus emerged within the international community that it had neglected to provide the new nation with adequate support for a sufficient time and acted too quickly in significantly reducing the UN presence on the ground. The so-called Core Group on East Timor (comprised of Australia, Brazil, New Zealand and Portugal – later expanded to include Malaysia and, from 2008, the Philippines) in addition to Security Council members France, Japan, the UK, and the US, acknowledged the need to establish a new, much more robust UN operation. As made clear on 13 June, the RDTL government expressed its wish for a UN peacekeeping force to replace the multinational force.\n\n36Then serving Timor-Leste Foreign Minister, José Ramos-Horta subsequently made it known that he wished the deployment of 800 international police for a period of five years. It is noteworthy that Ramos-Horta held back from seeking Timor-Leste’s inscription in the PBC as he may well have done. We can only speculate why this course was not followed; misplaced Timor-Leste confidence in their own ability to solve wide-ranging problems, or the weight of the Core Group and the interests of such nations as Australia inter alia privileged in Timor-Leste through its Status of Forces Arrangement, or Security Council disinterest alongside other pressing global issues\n\nThe United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (Unmit)\n\n39On 25 February 2008 Security Council (Resolution 1802) extended Unmit’s mandate for another 12 months. Deploring the attacks against the President and Prime Minister as “an attack on the legitimate institutions of the country” the Resolution sought Unmit to intensify its work in strengthening the security sector including the PNTL. Unmit also promised an internal investigation of the events of 11 February. Obviously such commitment is crucial to the rehabilitation of the nation, but we wonder whether such ad hoc-ism on the part of successive UN missions will ever raise capacity to a critical mass, such as envisioned by the PBC model.\n\nIndependent Special Committee of Inquiry\n\n40As mentioned, a UN Independent Special Commission Inquiry for Timor-Leste was mandated to establish the facts and circumstances relevant to the incidents of 28-29 April and 23-25 May 2006. It was also mandated to investigate related events or issues contributing to the crisis, to clarify responsibility for the events, and recommend measures of accountability for crimes and serious human rights violations specific to this time frame. In addition, according to mandate, on 17 October 2006 the Commission Inquiry submitted its report to the National Parliament.\n\n42That is undoubtedly the crux of the matter, but the Commission is notably silent on the failings of international actors and the UN body itself. Although Alkatiri was personally cleared by the Commission of complicity in acts of illicit arms distribution, such as committed by Lobato, his opponents, both internal and external – and there were many – seized upon this innuendo to bring down the government. While Gusmão was directly censored by the UN Commission for inflaming community divisions at the height of the crisis, Ramos-Horta may not be totally immune from the same charge. Certainly, the Canberra government was not displeased by regime change in Timor-Leste.\n\n44In any case, on 10 July 2006 José Ramos-Horta was sworn in as interim Prime Minister of the Second Constitutional government two weeks after Alkatiri resigned amid accusations that he was responsible for the violence. On his part Alkatiri remained indignant claiming to be a victim of a number of conspiracies on the part of unnamed international actors, including sections of the Australian media.\n\nFretilin Government Failings and Fallout\n\n46For want of capacity, as suggested, it was apparent that the nascent Fretilin administration proved incapable at project management, procurement and implementation, leaving spending gaps across the macro-economy. Where government spending and foreign investment could have helped to kick start the rural and urban economy, rising urban youth unemployment and frustration at the lack of development fueled popular anger. While such ineptness could be attributed to lack of experience and managerial capability on the part of the Alkatiri cabinet, the development and democracy discourse parlayed by international community, however well-intended, also obviously underestimated the specific historical, cultural and political setting of the fledgling nation.\n\n47If the Fretilin cabinet lacked managerial expertise and a dose of common sense, Alkatiri’s other mistake was in his cabinet appointments. The choice of Rogério Lobato (Minister of Interior), sentenced to seven and a half years imprisonment for distributing weapons to civilians, controversial from the outset as he was an unelected MP and had been convicted of diamond smuggling in Angola during his years in exile, may have been fatal for Timor-Leste. Even so, one wonders as to the efficacy of international advice and support in the so-called security sector which saw favoritism in both police and military recruitment among other anomalies. Such a bias in defense force recruitment favoring western recruits over easterners was in fact the pretext used by former Australia-trained Major Alfredo Reinado to defect in May 2006 joining an earlier group of rebels from the new nation’s defense forces. Taking advice from the UN, Alkatiri was correct in cashiering the mutineers.\n\n48Neither was the security situation propitious for the Fretilin administration, notwithstanding international advice and assistance in this sector. Having dramatically staged a breakout from Dili’s Becora prison on 30 August 2006 along with followers, Reinado defied all efforts to apprehend him, especially as he won a large following in the center-west of the country. Even so, he was contacted in his mountain hideout by members of Australian military forces, international media, and even leading RDTL government officials, including Xanana Gusmão and José Ramos-Horrta, raising questions about the nature of his immunity. Official tolerance only seems to have changed when, in February 2007, Reinado brazenly raided a police depot and captured weapons. Acting on orders from the RDTL President, Australian Special Forces mounted a botched raid on Reinado’s headquarters, leaving five of his supporters dead but with the renegade soldier evading capture. This led to violent demonstrations in the capital by supporters of Reinado. The UN in turn mounted an inquiry into the killings. Further urban violence flared when, on 7 March 2007, Lobato was sentenced by a panel of three international and one East Timorese judge to 7 years 6 months prison (appealed) for manslaughter and unlawfully using weapons. Earlier, charges against Alkatiri had been dropped, citing lack of evidence. As a result of the flare up of violence a number of foreign nations (Australia included) evacuated non-essential staff, just as the number of IDPs increased.\n\nThe 2007 Elections\n\n49It was against this uncertain backdrop that East Timor prepared for Presidential elections, with the first round held on 6 April 2007 and a runoff conducted on 9 May followed by parliamentary elections held on 4 June 2007. For the international community, legitimacy had to flow from the ballot box, no matter the simmering security situation. The risks of igniting violence through the electoral process were all too evident. Reflecting local political culture, few of the major parties – Fretilin aside – could be said to be programmatic but, rather, drew upon the charisma of leadership just as they played to local, regional and sub-ethnic allegiances. The least programmatic and opportunist party was undoubtedly that hastily cobbled together by Gusmão, namely the Conselho Nacional de Reconstrução de Timor (CNRT) crudely – and controversially – adopting the acronym of the former resistance movement in the attempt to increase its appeal.\n\n50In the first round of the Presidential elections José Ramos-Horta (21.81 percent) narrowly defeated his PD rival Fernando “Lasama” Araújo (19.18 percent). Their Fretilin opponent Francisco Guterres gained 27.89 percent. In the second round, Ramos-Horta gained 69.18 percent of the vote with Guterres polling 30.82 percent. Regional loyalties also showed up in voting patterns whereby Fretilin made far stronger gains in areas of traditional resistance support, namely the east, while PD’s gains were stronger in areas closer to the Indonesian border. Thus, the runner-up in the first round triumphed in the second round owing to a transfer of votes from PD loyalists. Lasama would subsequently be rewarded with the position of speaker of the parliament.\n\n51In the Legislative elections duly held in June 2007, Fretilin emerged as the single largest vote winner (29.01 percent) albeit short of an absolute majority with the CNRT gaining 24.1 percent, the Associação Social-Democrata Timorense (ASDT)/Partido Social Democrata (PSD) (15.75 percent) and PD (11.31 percent). Having been elected to the Presidency, Ramos-Horta invited the former President-turned-Prime Minister Gusmão to form the government at the head of his Parliamentary Majority Alliance (PMA) combining CNRT, ASDT/PSD and PD. The strongest party in this Alliance is the PSD with links with UDT, Fretilin’s historic rival. The defection from Fretilin of the current Deputy Prime Minister José Gutteres and supporters also worked in favor of Gusmão. Not all were happy with this outcome. Notably, Fretilin supporters launched a rash of house burnings but, overall, major violence was undoubtedly averted through the heavy international security and monitoring presence as much through pacts of non-violence entered into between the adversaries holding out some hope for future electoral contests.\n\n52Even so, the electoral process appeared as a prelude to a constitutional crisis. Rather than confirming legitimacy and socializing democratic norms, the outcome saw the former President and Prime Minister exchanging roles, in a situation where the party which gained the plurality of votes (Fretilin) being relegated to the opposition. Much turned upon interpretations of section 106 of the RDTL constitution (Portuguese version binding) whereby it is allowed that the Prime Minister shall be designated by the political party or alliance with parliamentary majority (before or after the election is not clarified) and appointed by the President after consultation with the political parties sitting in the national parliament. Obviously, there was no veto upon the party winning a narrow majority of the votes from taking office, demanded by Fretilin as a lawful right, just as there was no provision for a coalition of minority parties to automatically constitute the government. A Fretilin government would have been a weak government, but neither can it be said that the PMA government enjoys legitimacy across the board. Simply, the incoming President (Ramos-Horta) was kingmaker in facilitating the PMA government, although he may also have had later reservations.\n\n53It is understood that just prior to the 11 February 2008 Presidential assassination attempt, as discussed below, Ramos-Horta had been in talks with political figures from across the spectrum, concerning the prospect of an early election, suggesting to this author a crisis of legitimacy barely masked in Dili. With good reason, Fretilin, the majority party, regards the process whereby the PMA government was installed as unconstitutional, although it since abandoned the idea of a legal challenge. Having hosed down sometimes explosive grassroots discontent at the virtual constitutional coup de etat exercised by Ramos-Horta, Fretilin initially boycotted the parliament. Even upon taking its place in the parliament, Fretilin continues to deride the so-called “de facto Gusmão-led PMA government”. At this writing, the PMA government is also beset with internal contradictions over alleged corruption, just as on 1 May 2008 ASDT entered into an agreement to work with Fretilin in future elections.\n\nTrading Truth for Friendship\n\n57Initially, Fretilin and Alkatiri distanced themselves from this highly pragmatic position such as to let Indonesia off the hook in the interests of international reconciliation. In fact, Alkatiri had been strident in calling for justice at a time when Indonesian President Megawati had been deflecting the judicial process in Jakarta. Alkatiri is not explicit, but the temptations to gain membership of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) undoubtedly overweighed his earlier reservations. While Asean continues to reinvent itself on human rights concerns (especially vis-à-vis fellow member Burma), Asean’s trademark contribution to regionalism remains its principle of “non-interference” in the internal affairs of member countries. One can only assume that the troika of DRTL President, Foreign Minister, and belatedly former Prime Minister were read the riot act on this tacit understanding.\n\n59By joining elite consensus on reconciliation, even Fretilin was seen by many in Timor, from victims to activist NGOs, as out of touch, more the surprise that Alkatiri would actually defend the work of the CTF in Jakarta. Definitely the Indonesian people as much their leadership need to know the truth of events in East Timor but they could do worse than read the Indonesian language version of the CAVR report and act upon it.\n\nPresidential Assassination Bid of February 2008\n\n60In yet another twist to the Reinado story, in the early morning of 11 February 2008 the rebel leader along with one of his band was shot dead by a F-FDTL guard in the compound of the Dili house of Ramos-Horta. Imprudently returning to the house from an early morning jog, the President was seriously wounded by enraged members of Reinado’s group who, apparently undetected by UN or Australian peacekeepers, had descended from the mountains to Dili during the night. Another party of rebels led by Gastão Salsinha mounted a near simultaneous ambushed on the Prime Minister’s car. Slow to receive medical attention, the near assassination of the President again raised questions as to the co-ordination of UN police and F-FDTL. In any case, shot twice, Ramos-Horta only survived massive loss of blood thanks to expert medical care in Dili and surgery in an Australian hospital where he remained for almost three months before returning to Dili.\n\n62Whatever, it is clear that the President (and Prime Minister) were too trusting in dealing with the rebel-hero. Once again, in mid-January, in the company of the Development Minister João Gonçalves, Ramos-Horta met up with Reinado in the mountain town of Maubisse and informed him that he intended to announce an amnesty on 20 May that would cover all crimes committed during the crisis of 2006. As mentioned, on 7 February Ramos-Horta hosted a meeting at his home to discuss the prospect of an early election. All senior members of the Coalition along with the Fretilin opposition were present. The question of an amnesty for Reinado was also on the agenda. No formal consensus was arrived at during this meeting and further meetings were planned for 12 and 14 February. Obviously, with the denouement of 11 February, this timetable was derailed. In fact, on 10 February, secret negotiations between Ramos-Horta and Reinaldo continued via emissaries linked with a so-called Movement for Unity and Justice (Munj) group. It is now crystal clear that this shadow diplomacy with the highly unstable rebel leader came unstuck, just as the rebel-hero – known for his unstable and erratic behavior – ordered his men to prepare for a visit to Ramos-Horta’s house. The motive is subject to both rumor and investigation.\n\n* * *\n\n67We wonder as well about the politicization of ethnicity, the deliberate creation of east-west divisions in society by agent provocateurs and other actors that left many innocent victims. Certainly, as the Independent Special Committee of Inquiry concluded, the “fragility” of state institutions contributed to the crisis. And so too did leadership failure. Nevertheless, we cannot absolve international society including the United Nations. Crucially, Australia’s and Japan’s veto of mission extension flowing through to Security Council deliberations, was shortsighted. Looking further back, those individuals and nations responsible in the initial recruitment of the F-FDTL and the PNTL, simply failed the nation, as did certain of their trainers.\n\n68Undoubtedly, accountability for the events of 2006 will be necessary to create an atmosphere of trust and reconciliation for the future but, the need for full accountability for serious human rights violations and past crimes against humanity under the long Indonesian occupation is likely to prove just as important. As highlighted in the International Crisis Group Report, only a holistic approach to peacebuilding in East Timor can break the cycle of impunity necessary to safeguard the human security environment including the population displacement crisis.\n\n69Set back years by the violence of 2006, this author feels that only a deeply embedded and unencumbered Unmit, or better still a longer-term commitment as implied by the PBC, can lead East Timor out of its lingering crisis. This is especially the case as the new nation has the wherewithal for economic recovery – oil reserves amounting to over one billion dollars in escrow account – to see through sustainable development.\n\nMay, 2008"
