        "text": "The directly elected president is a largely symbolic figure, with formal powers limited to the right to veto legislation and make certain appointments. The president may serve up to two five-year terms. Francisco Guterres, known as Lú-Olo, of the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin) was elected president in 2017, following a campaign period a European Union (EU) observer mission praised for its generally peaceful conduct. The observers also called the election well administered.\n\nThe leader of the majority party or coalition in Parliament becomes prime minister and serves as head of government. In June 2018, former independence fighter and former president José Maria Vasconcelos, popularly known as Taur Matan Ruak, was sworn in as prime minister.\n\nMembers of the 65-seat, unicameral Parliament are directly elected and serve five-year terms. Because the minority government seated after the 2017 election could not pass a budget, the president dissolved Parliament in January 2018 and called new elections, which were held that May. The sitting opposition parties—the CNRT, KHUNTO, and the People’s Liberation Party (PLP)—formed the Change for Progress Alliance (AMP) coalition and won an outright majority of 34 seats. Fretilin won 23, the Democratic Party won 5, and the Democratic Development Front won 3. An EU observer mission called the elections “transparent, well-managed and credible,” and they were generally peaceful and orderly, despite a few violent incidents during the campaign period.\n\nParliament failed to approve a budget in January 2020 after the CNRT abstained. The CNRT, led by former prime minister Xanana Gusmão, then left the governing coalition, securing an agreement of its own in February. That effort failed in April, when KHUNTO—which originally supported the CNRT—broke from the alliance to support an extension of the COVID-19 state of emergency. A new coalition including the PLP, KHUNTO, and Fretilin was finalized in May, with Taur Matan Ruak remaining as prime minister.\n\nThe 2017 and 2018 EU election observation missions generally praised the National Election Commission for its oversight of the years’ polls but expressed concern that changes to the election laws in 2017 somewhat reduced its supervisory responsibilities. Provisions governing elections are found across several pieces of legislation, and observers have called for legal mandates governing elections to be harmonized into a more coherent framework.\n\nPolitical parties are generally free to operate. Some campaign-finance regulations favor larger parties. These include a lack of spending caps and a system in which government campaign subsidies are awarded after elections, according to the number of votes a party has won.\n\nTwo new parties, the youth-aligned KHUNTO and the PLP, concentrated enough support ahead of the 2017 elections to win 13 legislative seats between them that year. They joined AMP in the 2018 elections and formed a governing coalition with Fretilin in May 2020.\n\nThe 2018 national elections marked the third time since independence that governing power transferred between parties.\n\nWhile some smaller parties hold seats in Parliament, parties associated with the independence movement continue to dominate politics. Fretilin participated in governments formed in 2017 and 2020, while the CNRT participated in AMP when that coalition entered government in 2018. The PLP, which is led by Taur Matan Ruak, participated in the 2018 and 2020 governments.\n\nEthnic minorities are generally well represented in politics.\n\nSome 38.5 percent of parliamentarians are women. One-third of electoral-list candidates must be female. Women have overwhelmingly expressed the opinion that there would be few if any women candidates on party lists in the absence of parity laws. Women have also been underrepresented at the local level and within the leadership of political parties.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, the government held competitive and peaceful elections without the supervision of a UN mission that had been deployed to help restore security following a 2006 political crisis.\n\nGovernments have fallen over their inability to pass budgets in recent years; Parliament was dissolved in early 2018 for this reason. AMP was disrupted after it was unable to pass a budget in January 2020. A 2020 budget was passed in October and a 2021 budget was successfully passed in December.\n\nSix cabinet posts had gone unfilled since 2018, when Lú-Olo rejected several nominees. Taur Matan Ruak announced nominees for those posts, including the health, commerce, and finance ministries, in late April 2020. Nominees were officially appointed in May.\n\nThe government was criticized by former president José Ramos-Horta and Fretilin leader Mari Alkatiri for continually extending pandemic-related states of emergency, despite the country’s apparent success in containing the virus’s spread.\n\nScore Change: The score improved from 3 to 4 because the incumbent prime minister was able to form a new coalition and stabilize the government, filling key positions that had remained vacant since 2018.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that Timor-Leste loses from 1.5 to 2 percent of gross domestic product annually to corruption. Anticorruption bodies lack enough funding to operate effectively. The independent Anti-Corruption Commission was established in 2009 and has no powers of arrest or prosecution, relying on the prosecutor general, with input from police and the courts, to follow up on corruption investigations. However, a new anticorruption law, which includes protections for whistleblowers, was gazetted in August 2020.\n\nWhile media freedom is constitutionally protected, domestic media outlets are vulnerable to political pressure due to their reliance on government financial support, in a small media market with limited nongovernmental sources of support. Journalists are often treated with suspicion, particularly by government officials, and self-censor. However, in recent years, journalists have been more willing to produce articles critical of the government.\n\nIn June 2020, the government proposed the criminalization of defamation. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) called for the proposal’s withdrawal later that month. The Timor-Leste Press Union also voiced its opposition that month. In August, Lú-Olo stated the proposal was not a priority for the government, though it had not been officially withdrawn.\n\nFreedom of assembly is constitutionally guaranteed. While it is generally respected in practice, some laws can be invoked to restrict peaceful gatherings. Demonstrations deemed to be “questioning constitutional order,” or disparaging the reputations of the head of state and other government officials, are prohibited. Demonstrations must be authorized in advance, and laws restrict how close they can be to government buildings and critical infrastructure.\n\nPublic gatherings were banned in March 2020 when the government imposed a COVID-19-related state of emergency. A state of emergency remained in force at year’s end.\n\nWorkers, other than police and military personnel, are permitted to form and join labor unions and bargain collectively, though a 2011 law requires written notification of demands and allows for five days for a response from employers in advance of striking. If employers do not respond or if an agreement is not reached within 20 days, then five days’ notice is required for a strike. In practice, few workers are unionized due to high levels of unemployment and informal economic activity.\n\nConcerns over judicial independence remain for politically sensitive cases, and there is still reported political interference in the judicial system.\n\nAfter independence, the judicial system depended on contracted foreign judges and lawyers. In 2014, however, the government terminated contracts and visas of foreigners working in judicial, prosecutorial, and anticorruption institutions. As a result, legal proceedings in some courts were delayed or forced to restart with new personnel, and the Legal and Judicial Training Centre was closed. Later, a 2017 law explicitly permitting foreign judges allowed training courses for Timorese judges to recommence after a three-year interruption.\n\nDue process rights are often restricted or denied, owing in part to a dearth of resources and personnel. The training of new magistrates following the 2014 dismissals of foreign judges has been slow, resulting in significant case backlogs, although this is improving with the resumption of training programs. The use of Portuguese for court administration poses an obstacle, and a shortage of Portuguese interpreters often forces the adjournment of trials.\n\nCases involving past human rights abuses are required by law to be heard by a panel including two international judges, though the 2014 dismissals interrupted these cases.\n\nAlternative methods of dispute resolution and customary law are widely used, though they lack enforcement mechanisms and have other significant shortcomings, including unequal treatment of women.\n\nGeographical access to courts remains a challenge. Many municipalities have no fixed courts and rely on mobile services. The government has established mobile courts as an interim measure and has announced plans for the development of a hybrid justice system, with more harmonization between formal and customary dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\nWhile hate crimes based on sexual orientation are considered an aggravating circumstance in the penal code, other protections against discrimination for LGBT+ people are lacking. Gay men and transgender women have particular trouble accessing employment opportunities due to low rates of access to education and discrimination. Lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women report cases of extreme physical violence from strangers and family members, including cases of “corrective” rape and forced marriage or relationships with members of the opposite sex. Equal rights for women are constitutionally guaranteed, but discrimination and gender inequality persist in practice and in customary law.\n\nReligious minorities have reported difficulties in having marriage and birth certificates issued by religious entities readily accepted by the authorities. There have been recent complaints of discrimination against Muslims in civil-service hiring.\n\nTimorese have the right to establish businesses. However, practical aspects of establishing and operating a business are complicated by inefficiencies that make it difficult to gain appropriate permits and enforce contracts, as well as difficulties in obtaining credit.\n\nProperty rights are complicated by past conflicts and the unclear status of communal or customary land rights. According to a 2019 survey conducted by the Asia Foundation, land problems remain the biggest reported security issue in Timor-Leste, with signs that land-related disputes have increased since 2015. There is no formal mechanism to address competing claims. A national land law designed to establish formal tenure and to help resolve disputes through arbitration was enacted in 2017, but still requires several implementing regulations.\n\nGender-based violence (GBV) and domestic violence remain widespread. A survey conducted by the Asia Foundation in 2016 found that 59 percent of girls and women aged 15–49 had experienced violence by an intimate partner and 14 percent had experienced rape by someone other than their partner. Civil society groups have criticized the courts’ use of prison sentences for only the most severe and injurious such cases, and few reported cases are investigated. A lack of GBV training hampers investigatory procedures into such cases, including investigators’ failure to recognize or collect evidence.\n\nAccording to a 2017 UN Population Fund report, 24 percent of women in Timor-Leste have a child by the time they reach the age of 20, while 19 percent of women aged 20–24 are married by the time they turn 18."
