Although, as one of the Lesser Sunda islands separating Southeast Asia and the south Pacific, this tiny nation has great strategic importance.\n\nIn many ways developments there over the past three years have been good. In Dili, the capital, parliamentary representatives from 12 of the 16 political parties have been meeting since last August’s legislative elections. A president — although with limited powers — has been elected democratically; a constitution has been drawn up; the constituent assembly has opted for a semi-presidential system; and a government drawn from the assembly’s majority party (Fretilin, the Revolutionary Front for East Timorese Independence) has been set up with Mari Alkatiri as its prime minister.\n\nThe island was a Portuguese colony for four centuries before being occupied by Japan during the second world war. On 7 December 1975 it was invaded by Indonesia, which sought to turn it into a military base, and 200,000 Timorese (almost one-third of the population) were massacred. Indonesia’s invasion would not have been possible without the assent of the United States, which for over 20 years armed and trained the Indonesian military units fighting East Timor’s pro-independence forces. Pentagon and US state department documents, declassified in 1999, show that Indonesia’s President Suharto sent his troops in with the consent of the then US president, Gerald Ford, and the secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, who visited the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on the eve of the invasion.\n\nIn late 1999, for the first time since UN peacekeeping missions began, UN personnel in East Timor, assisted by an international coalition, successfully ended massive human rights violations by the Indonesian military, and established a protectorate with the intention of (...)\n\nFull article: 1 536 words.\n\n* Journalist with Radio-France International (RFI), which was appointed by the UN in 2000 to oversee the rebuilding of the East Timorese media\n\n(1) See “L’intervention au Timor et le multilatéralisme impossible”, Politique étrangère, No 65, Paris, April 2000, p 135.\n\n(2) See Noam Chomsky, “East Timor, horror and amnesia”, Le Monde diplomatique English edition, October 1999.\n\n(3) Sidney Jones, head of the UN human rights office in Dili, Le Monde, 2 September 2000.\n\n(4) Opening address to the fifth donors’ conference for East Timor, Oslo, December 2001.\n\n(5) See Roland-Pierre Paringaud, “Starting over in East Timor”, Le Monde diplomatique English edition, May 2000.\n\n(6) See Aséanie, No 8, December 2001, Paris.
