        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis text analyses the 2006 crisis in East Timor. It suggests that the historical background to the structuring of the East Timorese resistance to Indonesian occupation and the morals of reciprocity are important facts that enable a better understanding of how the crisis unfolded. This argument is supported by discussion of certain aspects of the 2005 disputes between the Catholic Church and the Fretilin Government relating to the issue of teaching religion in public schools, and by the 2007 presidential elections. In the complex context of the East Timor nation-building process, an ideology of reciprocity transformed the regional opposition between Lorosa'e/Firaku and Loromonu/Kaladi into a socio-political concern.\n\n[1] Acknowledgments: This text is the result of research on the following projects: (1) ‘The nation in ballot boxes: Competing civilizing projects in the post-colonial East Timor context’, funded by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), that is, The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, in Brazil; and (2) ‘Translating culture, culture of translation: Cultural negotiation as the central heritage in East Timor’, supported by Fundação de Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT), that is, The Foundation for Science and Technology, in Portugal. I thank very much Alcida Ramos, Daniel Simião, Mariza Peirano, Sarina Kilham and the editors of Anthropological Forum for their help and patience in editing this text, and Luis Roberto Cardoso de Oliveira and the reviewers whose suggestions allowed me to reach the final version of this article.\n\n[2] The data analysed were collected during field research in 2002, 2003 and 2007, and library and archival work carried out since 2000.\n\n[3] For a discussion of the tensions that permeated the formation of the F-FDTL and PNTL, see Rees 2004.\n\n[4] Control over the East Timor security forces is one of the main sources of political disputes in the country. Rees (Citation2004) discusses this issue, pointing out the implications of these disputes: for the composition of the cadres of each of the forces; for the definition of the functions attributed to the F-FDTL and to the PNTL; for the way in which the veterans of the resistance have been opportunistically mobilised, so as to challenge the legitimacy of both institutions, among other things. In this context, it is worth pointing out that the legitimacy of the police has been under suspicion because part of its contingent (approximately 300 individuals in 2004, including the commander Paulo de Fátima Martins) had previously served in the POLRI (Police of the Indonesia Republic).\n\n[5] The story of the crisis is presented here as a very brief and schematic summary. For further details, see especially International Crisis Group Citation2006; Harrington Citation2007; Devant Citation2008; ONU 2006.\n\n[6] Many authors have attributed the emergence and spread of the crisis to the incapacity of the Government and those responsible for the reconstruction of the country to handle public administration adequately and to build state institutions. In this respect, the political disturbances of 2006 are regarded as a result of several factors: mistakes made by the political leaders in handling the security forces (ONU 2006; International Crisis Group Citation2006; Curtain Citation2006); the inefficiency of the public administration in minimising material shortages and the vulnerability of the Dili population (Curtain Citation2006); and management of land and property disputes in the post-conflict context (Harrington Citation2007).\n\n[7] Seixas (Citation2006) points out how uncommon this opposition is in the colonial literature about Portuguese Timor and how both terms, Firaku and Kaladi, were used in that context in a way similar to the references made to the bárbara (‘barbarian’) people of the hills, as opposed to the inhabitants of the flatlands regarded as being more civilised.\n\n[8] For an excellent inventory of the disputes that pervaded the process of nation building in East Timor, see Scambary Citation2009.\n\n[9] It is worth noting that the report by the Comissão de Acolhimento, Verdade e Reconciliação (CAVR), that is, the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation, which was the product of the most profound and extensive research about recent East Timorese history (since the 1970s), makes no reference to the tensions between people or groups of Lorosa'e/Firaku and Loromonu/Kaladi origin (Devant Citation2008).\n\n[10] Supermie is a popular brand of noodles sold in Indonesia, which is considered to be cheap and easily prepared.\n\n[11] Some of my interlocutors stressed that, unlike other places in the world where the expression of conflict and differences in public space are not problematical, they are extremely dangerous in Timor and may cause social unrest. They generate hatred among the people who, observing conflicts within the political leadership, identify themselves with one or another politician. Soares (Citation2003, 13) presented similar findings based on study of the political climate in East Timor in 2002.\n\n[12] Furthermore, Xanana Gusmão made public the hypotheses raised by Colonel Lere and the then Minister of Defence, Roque Rodrigues, regarding the origin of the demands presented by the petitioners. To Colonel Lere, they were the result of political manipulation orchestrated by the Democratic Party that had been joined by veteran Decker. To Roque Rodrigues, Gusmão meant that the politicisation of the regional identities could be the product of certain international advisers interested in destabilising the country following orders from their governments. Xanana closed his speech by affirming that, owing to the cowardly decision taken by the Brigadier-General of the F-FDTL, the petitioners were already civilians, and the Timorese state had been ill born.\n\n[13] For a more comprehensive analysis of the development of the conflicts between the Catholic Church and the Fretilin Government on that occasion, see Silva Citation2008."
