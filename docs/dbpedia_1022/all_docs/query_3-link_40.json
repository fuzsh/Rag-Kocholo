        "text": "7:50 AM\n\nAre the identities of Robert Barcroft's crew in pictures below known?\n\nHis plane was the Taconite Express serial number 42-96151\n\nThe guy on left (Barcroft) is the person that Phillip A. Vogel flew with in June 1944. Not sure who are pictured but do we have idea of what Phillip might look like?\n\nD day 6 June 1944 was Barcrofts first mission where \"they attacked strong points and bombed fuel dumps and other objectives to support ground forces throughout the Normandy Campaign\".\n\nCrew names of one mission.\n\nRobert Barcroft - pilot, Edwin Zachary - co-pilot, Phillip Vogel - bombardier, Carl Reib - engineer/gunner, John O'Connor - radio/gunner, and Charles Stiles - armorer/gunner.\n\nTwo other photos one is of a map on silk that they carried which could be used for escape/evasion.\n\nLink to photo:\n\nhttp://s271.photobucket.com/u ser/36coupe/media/001-3.jpg.ht ml\n\nhttp://i271.photobucket.com/al bums/jj152/36coupe/002-3.jpg\n\nhttp://i271.photobucket.com/al bums/jj152/36coupe/003-2.jpg\n\nPhillip A. Vogel is my cousin but I have only recently found the thread to his war experience. Below is history of his aircraft and crew. Are there data bases that would tell when he joined BG 391 and how many missions he might have flown?\n\n\"The heaviest losses sustained by the 391st Bombardment Group in a single operation occurred on 23 December 1944, after an attack on the railroad viaduct at Ahrweiler, Germany (11).\n\nUpon completion of the second bomb run, the formation was attacked by an estimated fifty to seventy-five FW-19Us and ME-109's. As a result, sixteen aircraft were missing in action, and the returning planes were badly battle-damaged.\n\n42-96223, 1st.PFF, \"CHERE AMIE\", Code IH-O, Missions flown 39; the plane painted all over black; MARC 15002\n\n21 Jun 44 to 23 Dec 44 shot down by fighters while leading 391st.BG, front of a/c badly shot up. Capt. Enoch G. Longsworth, 2.Lt Arthur E DeSaulniers, 1.Lt Phillip A Vogel; Capt William G Wilson, T/Sgt George R Winston; S/Sgt Robert H Aley (Longworth, Vogel, Wilson, DeSaulniers and Aley, KIA; Winston badly wounded but survived as POW)\n\n1st Lt Phillip A. Vogel was my second cousin. It would be interesting to. know how many missions he flew on prior to 23 Dec. 1944.\n\nCrew member\n\n39172893.
