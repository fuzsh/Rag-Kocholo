It operates Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in theater airlift missions as part of the Global War on Terrorism. Its current status and duty location is undetermined.\n\nThe squadron was first activated as the 737th Bombardment Squadron in June 1943. After training in the United States with the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, it deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, participating in the strategic bombing campaign against Germany. It earned two Distinguished Unit Citations for its combat operations. Following V-E Day, it returned to the United States for conversion as a very heavy bomber unit, but was inactivated instead.\n\nThe squadron was activated in the reserves in 1947, but was not fully manned or equipped before inactivating in 1949. In 1952 it was redesignated the 737th Troop Carrier Squadron and again activated in the reserve, but was inactivated the following year and its personnel and equipment transferred to another unit. It was converted to provisional status in 2002 and assigned to Air Mobility Command. It was reassigned to ACC in 2003.\n\nHistory[]\n\nWorld War II[]\n\nThe squadron was first activated at Alamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico in mid-1943 as the 737th Bombardment Squadron, one of the four Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombardment squadrons assigned to the 454th Bombardment Group.[1] The unit trained under Second Air Force. After training in the United States, the squadron deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations in late 1943 and was stationed at San Giovanni Airfield under Fifteenth Air Force.[2]\n\nThe unit engaged in very long range strategic bombardment of enemy military, industrial and transportation targets. It initially flew some interdiction and ground support missions, participating in the drive to Rome. Most operations included attacks against such objectives as marshalling yards, aircraft factories, railroad bridges, and airdromes in Italy, Austria, and Romania. The squadron was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for an attack on an airfield at Bad VÃ¶slau, Austria on 12 April 1944. It helped to prepare the way for and supported Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France, during July and August 1944. At the same time, expanded previous operations to include attacks on oil refineries and storage facilities, locomotive works, and viaducts in France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, and in the Balkans. It earned a second Distinguished Unit Citation on 25 July when the 454th Group led the 304th Bombardment Wing through severe opposition in an attack on steel factories at Linz, Austria.[1]\n\nThe squadron returned to the United States after VE Day in May 1945. It began to reorganize as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombardment squadron. It began training under Second Air Force in August 1945, but was inactivated in October after VJ Day.[2]\n\nAir Force reserve[]\n\nThe squadron was activated as a reserve unit under Air Defense Command (ADC) at McChord Field, Washington in July 1947, where its training was supervised by the 406th AAF Base Unit (later the 2345th Air Force Reserve Training Center).[3] It was nominally a heavy bomber unit, but it is not clear whether it was fully manned or had any combat aircraft assigned.[4] In 1948 Continental Air Command (ConAC) assumed responsibility for managing reserve and Air National Guard units from ADC.[5] The 737th was inactivated when ConAC reorganized its reserve units under the wing base organization system in June 1949.[2] The squadron's personnel and equipment were transferred to elements of the 302d Troop Carrier Wing, which was simultaneously activated at McChord.[6] This reorganization was also impacted by President Trumanâs reduced 1949 defense budget, which required reductions in the number of units in the Air Force.[7]\n\nThe reserve mobilization for the Korean War had left the reserve without aircraft, and the reserves did not receive aircraft again until July 1952.[8] In preparing for the receipt of aircraft, in June 1952, ConAC activated the 454th Troop Carrier Wing at Portland International Airport, Oregon to replace the 922d Reserve Training Wing, the non-flying headquarters for reserve units there. The 737th was redesignated the 737th Troop Carrier Squadron and activated with the 454th Wing. It began training with Curtiss C-46 Commando transports.[9] It was inactivated on 1 January 1953 with its personnel and equipment being reassigned to the 64th Troop Carrier Squadron[10] when the 403d Troop Carrier Wing was released from active duty and replaced the 454th Wing as Portland's air reserve unit.[11]\n\nExpeditionary airlift[]\n\nThe squadron was converted to provisional status and redesignated 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron.[12] It was activated as a Lockheed C-130 Hercules airlift squadron as part of the Global War on Terrorism and it made up of multiple detachments from airlift squadrons which constantly rotate.[citation needed]\n\nLineage[]\n\nConstituted as the 737th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 14 May 1943\n\nActivated on 1 June 1943\n\nRedesignated 737th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy c. 1944\n\nRedesignated 737th Bombardment Squadron, Very Heavy on 5 August 1945\n\nInactivated on 17 October 1945\n\nActivated in the reserve on 12 July 1947\n\nInactivated on 27 June 1949\n\nRedesignated 737th Troop Carrier Squadron, Medium on 26 May 1952\n\nActivated in the reserve on 13 June 1952\n\nInactivated on 1 January 1953[13]\n\nRedesignated: 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron and converted to provisional status on 12 June 2002[12]\n\nAssignments[]\n\n454th Bombardment Group, 1 June 1943 - 17 October 1945\n\n454th Bombardment Group, 12 July 1947 - 27 June 1949\n\n454th Troop Carrier Group, 13 June 1952 - 1 January 1953[13]\n\nAir Mobility Command to activate or inactivate as needed, 12 June 2002[12]\n\nAir Combat Command to activate or inactivate as needed, 19 March 2003[14]\n\n386th Expeditionary Operations Group\n\nStations[]\n\nAlamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico, 1 June 1943\n\nDavis-Monthan Field, Arizona, 1 July 1943\n\nMcCook Army Air Field, Nebraska, 31 July 1943\n\nCharleston Army Air Field, South Carolina, 3 OctoberâDecember 1943\n\nTorretto Airfield, Italy 16 January 1944\n\nSan Giovanni Airfield, Italy 24 January 1944 â July 1945\n\nSioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota, 1 August 1945\n\nPyote Army Air Field, Texas, 17 August â 17 October 1945\n\nMcChord Field (later McChord Air Force Base), Washington, 12 July 1947 â 27 June 1949\n\nPortland International Airport, Oregon, 13 June 1952 â 1 January 1953[13]\n\nAli Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait, unknown\n\nAircraft[]\n\nConsolidated B-24 Liberator, 1943-1945[2]\n\nCurtiss C-46 Commando, 1952-1953[15]\n\nLockheed C-130 Hercules,\n\nAwards and campaigns[]\n\nAward streamer Award Dates Notes Distinguished Unit Citation 12 April 1944 Bad VÃ¶slau, 737th Bombardment Squadron[2] Distinguished Unit Citation 25 July 1944 Linz, 737th Bombardment Squadron[2] Air Force Meritorious Unit Award 1 July 2007-30 June 2008 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron[16] Air Force Meritorious Unit Award 1 June 2010-31 May 2011 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron[16] Air Force Meritorious Unit Award 1 June 2011-31 May 2012 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron[16] Air Force Meritorious Unit Award 1 June 2015-31 May 2016 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron[16]\n\nCampaign Streamer Campaign Dates Notes Air Offensive, Europe 16 January 1944â5 June 1944 737th Bombardment Squadron[2] Air Combat, EAME Theater 16 January 1944â11 May 1945 737th Bombardment Squadron[2] Naples-Foggia 16 January 1944â21 January 1944 737th Bombardment Squadron[2] Rome-Arno 22 January 1944â9 September 1944 737th Bombardment Squadron[2] Central Europe 22 March 1944â21 May 1945 737th Bombardment Squadron[2] Normandy 6 June 1944â24 July 1944 737th Bombardment Squadron[2] Northern France 25 July 1944â14 September 1944 737th Bombardment Squadron[2] Southern France 15 August 1944â14 September 1944 737th Bombardment Squadron[2] North Apennines 10 September 1944â4 April 1945 737th Bombardment Squadron[2] Rhineland 15 September 1944â21 March 1945 737th Bombardment Squadron[2] Po Valley 3 April 1945â8 May 1945 737th Bombardment Squadron[2] Transition of Iraq 2 May 2003 -28 June 2004 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron[17] National Resolution 16 December 2005-9 January 2007 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron[17] Iraqi Surge 10 January 2007-31 December 2008 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron[17] Iraqi Sovereignty 1 January 2009-31 August 2010 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron[17] New Dawn 1 September 2010-31 December 2011 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron[17] Global War on Terror Expeditionary Medal 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron[18]\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of C-130 Hercules operators\n\nB-24 Liberator units of the United States Army Air Forces\n\nReferences[]\n\nNotes[]\n\nExplanatory notes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography[]\n\nThis article incorporates public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency website http://www.afhra.af.mil/."
