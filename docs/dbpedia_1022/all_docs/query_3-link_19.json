        "text": "KEVIN SUNDAY HONORED BY CITY & STATE PENNSYLVANIA\n\nJuly 8 – CARLISLE, PA – The Army Heritage Center Foundation (AHCF) is pleased to announce that board member Kevin Sunday has been recognized as one of Pennsylvania’s top Forty Under 40 leaders by the publication City & State Pennsylvania.\n\n“Kevin brings a refreshing outlook of statewide knowledge, strong relationships, and an incredibly supportive work ethic to our board,” said Julie Germany, President of the Foundation. “We are incredibly proud of all that he has achieved so far in his career–and everything he will accomplish in the future. He’s a great advocate and leader to have on our team.”\n\nSunday is a policy advisor with the consulting practice at McNees Strategic Solutions Group, a subsidiary of the law firm of McNees Wallace & Nurick. He previously served as the chair of the board of directors of the Central Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Red Cross, the director of government affairs for the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, and the deputy press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. He is a graduate of Towson University.\n\nCity & State Pennsylvania said, “The young people on this year’s City & State Pennsylvania 40 Under 40 list all possess these qualities in spades, bringing millennial (and even Gen Z!) energy and notable focus to enhance myriad sectors across the commonwealth…Kevin Sunday has an enviable knowledge of the state’s energy, environmental and utility landscape. ”\n\nThe Army Heritage Center Foundation is the support group of the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center. The Foundation’s mission is to help USAHEC realize its full potential as a hub of knowledge and expertise for the military, government, academia, and American public.\n\nFor more information on City & State Pennsylvania’s Forty Under 40 list, visit cityandstatepa.com.\n\nJune 12, 2024 – CARLISLE, PA – The Army Heritage Center Foundation (AHCF) is pleased to announce that COL (USAF Ret.) Cornelia Weiss has been selected to receive its LTC John William Whitman Research Grant for 2024.\n\nWeiss’s proposed research focuses on discovering why the post-WWII military governments in Europe imposed gender wage gaps on local women workers, when in the U.S., women were to receive equal pay for equal work.\n\n“Colonel Weiss’s professional legacy is transformative–from her work with the military justice system in wartime Colombia to her research on women in the military,” said Julie Germany, President of the Foundation. “We’re looking forward to hosting her research and seeing how it impacts the world around us.”\n\nWeiss is a graduate of the Inter-American Defense College. She holds a GED, an AA (Colorado Mountain College), a BA (University of Utah), an MA (ANEPE), and a JD (Vanderbilt). Her previous fellowships include the Ian Axford Fellowship (New Zealand and Timor-Leste) and the Rotary Peace Fellowship (Thailand and Nepal). In 2022, she served as Scholar-in-Residence at the Law Library of the Library of Congress.\n\n“I am deeply moved to be awarded the LTC John William Whitman Research Grant,” said Cornelia Weiss. “LTC Whitman’s aunt is Eleanor Treadwell. I don’t know if they are related, but Mattie E. Treadwell’s 1991 ‘The Women’s Army Corps’ is possibly the only history commissioned by the U.S. military to highlight women. Given DoD’s ‘Women, Peace, and Security’ reporting requirements, I anticipate LTC Whitman would be delighted if his grant spurs the U.S. Army to task its historians to excavate U.S. Army heritage about women. It is amazing; for example, General MacArthur’s forgotten first demand for reform to the government of Japan in post-WWII Occupied Japan – the ‘emancipation of women.’ My published research about General MacArthur’s first demand is now taught to UN peacekeepers. I can’t wait to see what treasures will be unearthed as a result of LTC Whitman’s grant.”\n\nThe Whitman Grant, named in honor of Lieutenant Colonel John William Whitman, provides financial support to independent researchers working on under-explored topics of military history. Funded research will be conducted at the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center (USAHEC) in Carlisle, Pa.\n\nThe Army Heritage Center Foundation is the support group of the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center. The Foundation’s mission is to help USAHEC realize its full potential as a hub of knowledge and expertise for the military, government, academia, and American public.\n\nAWARD RECOGNIZES EXCELLENCE IN WRITING BY U.S. ARMY WAR COLLEGE GRADUATES\n\nJune 12, 2024 CARLISLE, PA – The Army Heritage Center Foundation (AHCF) is pleased to announce that COL Randall S. Verde, U.S. Army, won the 454th Bombardment Group Award for his paper “Lessons Learned from Japanese Pacific Posture During World War II.”\n\nCOL Verde authored the paper as part of the U.S. Army War College (USAWC) Strategic Research Requirement.\n\n“As a War College Alumnus, I present this award to COL Verde with a great appreciation of the undertaking.” said Bob DeSousa, Executive Vice President of the Army Heritage Center Foundation. “COL Verde earned this distinction through excellence in research, strategic thought, and effective communication.”\n\nFor more information about this or many of the other writing awards bestowed upon U.S. Army War College students this year, visit https://www.armywarcollege.edu/news/article/2187.\n\nThe Army Heritage Center Foundation is the support group of the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center.
