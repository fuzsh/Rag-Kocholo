        "text": "454bg.org is a project of the Army Air Corps Library and Museum. Volunteers are transcribing servicemen names and their awards from General Orders that we are publishing on this website for enthusiasts, families and researchers of genealogy and World War II history. The names on this honor roll of men assigned to the 454th Bombardment Group is not a complete list of all who served with the 454th, however, we are attempting to locate as many documents that have survived as possible. Sources of material include the US National Archives, Air Force Historical Research Agency and the records donated by individual servicemen and their families. We hope you will find this information useful and enjoyable. We are accepting volunteers help in this very large World War II project as we preserve this history and honor service.\n\nConstituted 14 May 1943 and activated on 1 June 1943. This B-24 Liberator group moved to Italy, December 1943-January 1944, and was assigned to the Fifteenth Air Force until VE Day in 1945. Flew strategic missions to bomb bridges, rail lines, marshaling yards, airfields, munition and industrial factories, harbors and oil refineries. The 454th received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for a raid on an airdrome at Bad Voslau on 12 April 1944 and a second for a mission to Linz on 25 July 1944.\n\nWorld War 2 Commanders\n\nCol Horace D Aynesworth, c.
