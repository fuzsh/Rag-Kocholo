        "text": "1st Lt.\n\nEast Cleveland, OH.\n\nNote: his picture may be misidentified. It is believed his picture is actually that shown for William H. Ray\n\nHe is buried in\n\nLorraine American Cemetery and Memorial, Saint-Avold, Lorraine Region, France\n\nRundlett was his Instructor at Douglas. He graduated Spence Field on Dec. 11, 1943, S/N: O-820535. He was with the 8th A.F. 353rd Fighter Group, 351st Fighter Squadron flying P-51's. During escort of B-17 bombers on Jan. 14, 1945, he is described as having shot down a FW-190 whose pilot bailed out and later got onto a Me-109 and shot its right wing off.\n\nHe was a Lt. Col. and commander of 336 Fighter Sqdn (ACC) \"Rocketeers\" in Feb 1963.\n\nJim Ritter was his instructor at Douglas. Bruce graduated in Jan. 1944 in Twin engine planes at Turner Field, S/N: O-820899. Then was checked out on B-17’s. He was sent to Foggia, Italy with the 301st Bomb Grp. 15th A.F. He flew 50 missions, some to Ploesti and other oil refineries. After he returned to the states he was assigned to A.T.C. but applied for Instrument training and received his instrument card. He then was instructing in C-47's when the War ended.\n\nHe graduated from Spence Field, S/N: O-820558.\n\nIn his teens he designed a towline glider that set a world record. He took flying lessons and earned a private license prior to World War II. He signed up for cadet training in the Army Air Corps. After receiving his commission in Class 44A he was assigned as a flight instructor. Soon thereafter he signed up for helicopter training. He was one of the nation’s first 15 helicopter pilots, and in 1945 was the first person to test fire a 75 millimeter recoilless weapon from a helicopter. Two years later he became the second man in the free world to accumulate 1000 first-pilot hours in a chopper.\n\nWhile in the military he was chosen to set up the Air Corps’ helicopter-pilot training school. When he retired from the military as a Captain he worked as a test pilot for Bell Aircraft Corporation in Niagara Falls, NY, soon becoming the company’s Chief Test Pilot for both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. He had flown 67 different types of aircraft. [Source: his obituary found here]."
