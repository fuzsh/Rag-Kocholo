        "text": "WAR DIARY OF THE 723RD BOMBARDMENT SQUADRON (H)\n\n1 JANUARY 1944 TO 1 FEBRUARY 1944\n\nJanuary 1, 1944 to January 8, 1944\n\nThe ground echelon did not arrive at the A/B Manduria, Italy until January 15, 1944. Thus the day by day account of squadron activities is incomplete for the first half of January. The personnel that came by plane spent most of their time trying to fix up a place to live, to try to keep dry and warm. It rained almost every day and it was cold and disagreeable. The section heads began setting up their departments but had very little to work with since the TAT equipment had not and did not arrive until weeks later. The combat crews were eager to start flying combat missions but the weather and the condition of the field was a deterrent. The messing facilities of the squadron were not yet set up and the enlisted personnel messed with the 722nd Squadron; the officers at the regular Group Officers Mess.\n\nJanuary 8, 1944\n\nThe 723rd Bomb Sq furnished eleven of the thirty six B-24 Bombers in a combined operation of the 449th and 450th Groups. The target attacked was the Mostar A/D, Yugoslavia. Each ship dropped 12 500 lb bombs. With the exception of a small cloud over the target, the weather was clear. No enemy aircraft was encountered on the entire mission. The flak was moderate and rather inaccurate. All ships returned safely. The evening was spent by the crews that participated telling of their experiences to all who would listen. The \"ice had been broken\"; they had completed their first combat mission.\n\nJanuary 9, 1944\n\nNone of our aircraft accompanied the Group on the mission to Zara, Yugoslavia. The boys didn't feel so badly because they were not along, when they found out the group was forced to turn away from the target about 20 miles off shore due to a solid undercast over the target. The bombs were salvoed in the Adriatic.\n\nJanuary 10, 1944\n\nLt. Samsa in Flight 1, position #6, and Lt. Hefner in Flight 2, position #7 attacked the M/Y in Skopolje, Yugoslavia. Each dropped 12 500 lb bombs on the target. Heavy flak of slight intensity was encountered but no enemy fighters were seen. The result of the bombing was reported as unsatisfactory. All planes returned safely. The combat crews are getting anxious for the ground echelon to get here; they have had to guard and service their own planes and load them with bombs and ammunition.\n\nJanuary 11, 1944\n\nNo mission today. Everybody still trying to fix up a warm dry place to live. Plenty of conversation about experiences on combat mission. Many walked out to the field to observe flak holes.\n\nJanuary 12, 1944\n\nNo mission. The runways are rough and wet. Ponds of water around the field. Everyone eager to get their missions completed so they can go home. Many of the men went to town just to look around,. Some purchases, nuts and oranges. Everyone notices the poverty and low living conditions of the Italians.\n\nJanuary 13, 1944\n\nEight of our planes joined the group in an assault on the airdrome at Perugio, Italy, the main reconnaissance base of the GAF in the western and central Mediterranean. Only two, however, managed to drop their bomb load of 20 fragmentation clusters on the target. 5 jettisoned their bombs.\n\nME-109's swarmed in on us two minutes after we left the target. Lt. Francis Lael in AP #454 observed the attack on Captain Miller's ship, hit in the cowling of the number 4 engine. One of the enemy fighters was observed going down in smoke and was probably shot down by Tail Gunner Devilin and Top Turret Gunner Turrentine of Lt Lael's crew. Our men said that P-38 escort was excellent for \"the good old morale\".\n\nLt Whitney described this as a snafu mission. Visibility over the target was very poor and no accurate description of results could be given.\n\nJanuary 14, 1944\n\nThe target was the town of Mostar, Yugoslavia, reputedly an enemy headquarters with large troop garrisons. Four of our planes dropped 12 500 lb demos each on the target from 21,000 feet. The results were described as good. Captain Miller's ship was hit badly by flak in the #3 engine and was forced to withdraw from the formation, but it returned safely. There was heavy accurate flak around the target. The group clashed with the ME-109's near the target area and back to the Adriatic coast, but none of our planes were involved.\n\nJanuary 15, 1944\n\nThe ground echelon of our squadron arrived at the base. The target today were the marshalling yards at Prato, Italy. We had six planes on this mission, but Lt Kellman managed to plaster the target, dropping 12 500 lb demos.\n\nThere were no encounters with enemy aircraft and no flak of any kind was reported. The weather and visibility over the target were good. Altogether, this was not too successful a mission, as very few bombs dropped over the target area.\n\nJanuary 16, 1944\n\nWe were assigned the task of destroying the enemy airdrome at Ossopo, Italy. Six of our squadron's aircraft went out on this seventh mission, though only three hit the primary target, dropping a total of 32 500 lb demos.\n\nLt Whitney's plane (AC #228) dropped 12 500 lb demos on the alternate target, which was the town of Zara, Yugoslavia, and sank a ship in the harbor.\n\nLt Gernand (AC #620) hit and destroyed a railroad bridge. We met the most serious enemy fighter attack to date and suffered our first losses. Lt Holloman's (AC #724) crew bailed out at sea after two motors were set aflame, and they were reported as missing. Or planes were all shot up rather badly, but there were compensations. AC #163 (Lt Courtwright) claimed two ME-109's destroyed. We claimed a total of 9 enemy aircraft destroyed and two probably destroyed.\n\nFour members of Lt. Henderson's crew were injured. A great shock went through the personnel when they realized how tough war could be. Everyone, especially combat crew members had wonderment in their actions and appearances.\n\nJanuary 17, 1944\n\nNo bombs were dropped on the target today, the marshalling yards at Arezzo, Italy, by any of the Group, and this was not credited as an actual mission. An abrupt turn by the formation leader caused disruption of the following group. The loss of vision due to this maneuver made it advisable for the Group to return. Four of our planes went out, all of them dropping their load of 10 500 lb bombs over the Adriatic.\n\nJanuary 18, 1944\n\nThe target was the marshalling yards at Pisa, Italy. Six of our aircraft accounted for 18 of the 79 tons of 500 lb demos that were dropped squarely on the target. All reported a complete smearing of the target, and subsequent photographs bore this conclusion out. Although no enemy planes attacked us, one of our squadron's planes observed eight single engine aircraft which not identified. There was flak near the target, but it was inaccurate, and we suffered no damage.\n\nJanuary 19, 1944\n\nThe Group failed to bomb the primary target, the A/D at Perugia, Italy, but the alternate target, the A/D of Iesi, Italy, was well hit, with hangars possibly destroyed. Only two of our planes participated (AC #143 and #710). Lt Clay (#710) hit the target with 10 500 lb demos, as did Lt Gernand (#143). They reported smoke over the hangars and administrative buildings. No enemy aircraft or flak was encountered.\n\nJanuary 20, 1944\n\nContinuing the pattern of attack on the enemy's fighter airdromes, we headed for the A/D at Guiconia, Italy. None of the five planes we sent out managed to strike the target. Lt. Kellman's plane dropped 1 ton bombs on an airfield near Marigliano. Our planes were unable to observe results.\n\nJanuary 21, 1944\n\nThe Group's 12th mission was flown, the target being the Marshalling Yards at Prato, Italy. Seven of our plane participated in this mission, which was unsuccessful because a solid overcast prevented an observation on the target. None of our aircraft attempted to bomb, 6 jettisoning their load and the other returning 8 of the 10 500 lb. demos. allotted. The enemy failed to show itself either in the form of fighters or flak. Lt. Lael (AC #454) suffered engine trouble. All of our planes reported spotting the huge invasion convoy heading north.\n\nJanuary 22, 1944\n\nLed by Captain Miller, the Squadron Commander, six of our planes accounted for 15 of the 75 tons of demolition bombs which were dropped on the Marshalling Yards at Arezzo, Italy. We achieved a very heavy concentration of hits on train sheds, warehouses and workshops. There was no fighter opposition of any kind and the flak which we met over the target was inaccurate. Our planes all observed the heavy convoy of ships south of Rome, undoubtedly loaded with troops which established the new bridgehead.\n\nJanuary 23, 1944\n\nThe target for our fourteenth mission was a landing strip, 10 miles east of Rome and the Rieti A/S. Discovering a complete overcast over the Point, the Group struck at the Rieti A/D in Italy.\n\nJanuary 28, 1944\n\nWe headed for the Ferrara M/Y in Italy, one of the two principal lines of military supply for the German forces in Italy. This was not a wholly successful venture, however, as the bomb photos revealed an incomplete coverage of the target. Six of our planes hit in the vicinity of the Marshalling Yards. No enemy aircraft were encountered and there was no conspicuous flak.\n\nJanuary 29, 1944\n\nWe continued the assault on the enemy's communications and supply system, the target being the Sienna M/Y and Railroad Junction. All bombs dropped on that target area were on an ETA  through a solid undercast. It was not possible, therefore to assess the damage. Our squadron sent 9 planes over and none of them could report any positive observation of results. We had no clashes with enemy aircraft and no flak was encountered.\n\nJanuary 30, 1944\n\nEight of our planes dropped 20 120 lb. fragmentation bombs each on the Udine A/D in northern Italy and good coverage was reported. We ran into rather serious trouble today. After rallying from the target, ME-109's attacked in force. Three of them hopped on Lt. Nielson's plane before the target area was reached. Sgt. Zelford Mathis, the ball turret gunner on Lt. Gernand's crew, claimed to have shot down one of them. Sgt. Joseph C. Portugues was wounded by flak and received the Purple Heart. His plane returned to the field with18 flak holes in it. The rest of our aircraft escaped damage.\n\nJanuary 31, 1944\n\nThe job of the Group on its 20th Mission, rounding out the month, was to destroy the installations at Aviano A/D, and it was well carried out. Eight of our planes took part, dropping a total of 23 tons of demolition bombs.\n\nGale H Gillan,\n\n2nd Lt., Air Corps,\n\nSquadron Historian."
