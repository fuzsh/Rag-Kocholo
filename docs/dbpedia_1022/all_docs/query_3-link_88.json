        "text": "Manning Monitor articles ------ 1943\n\nDave Summerville In Air Corps\n\nA-C, Dave Summerville writes from Minter Field, California, informing us of an address change.\n\nHe is located in the heart of the desert. During the day the temperature is in the lower 100's. Very seldom can a cloud be seen-nothing but sand, all around. He is located about 15 miles from Bakersfield.\n\nDave is taking his basic flying training having finished on primary at Sequoia Field with 62 hours. He is now flying a 450 H.P. Vulter basic trainer--quite a ship he adds.\n\nSchedules start at 5:00 a.m. and continue to 8:15 with never a 10 a minute break. Although the going is tough he says there are none who aren't glad to be there.\n\nIn closing he sends thanks for the home paper.\n\nAt Santa Ana\n\nDavid K. Summerville, Aviation Cadet at Santa Ana California, writes, thanking the Legion and Monitor for the paper and adds, It seems so good to read about all the happenings of Manning and vicinity.\"\n\nHe says that it is rather warm out there. He has been at the air base over two months and still has another to go. He says he hasn't seen a plane other than in the air, but must go through training first.\n\nDave Summerville, Pilot of B-17\n\nDavid Summerville writes from Texas, giving us a change of address for the Monitor.\n\nDave can find little good in Texas and says there is only a barb wire fence between Amarillo and the North Pole and since they are only 80 miles north, they get plenty of wind and cold.\n\nHe is now at an Operational Tactical Unit. He was in Salt Lake City, Utah for 8 days and picked up his crew. He writes, \"It is a pretty nice feeling to be 1st Pilot on a B-17; even though I am the youngest man on my crew.\"\n\nHe has 9 men under him and three are also Lts. His Engineer is from Marshalltown but the rest of the crew varies from New York to Washington and Maine to Florida.\n\nHe sends his regards to Manning folks and says he looks forward to the paper each week.\n\nD.K. Summerville at Ft. Sumner\n\nAir Cadet D. K. Summerville writes from Ft. Sumner, N. M.\n\n\"I am now in an Advanced Flying school, the last step before those coveted wings are issued. This is a twin engine school, preparatory to 4 motored bombers. We have two types of trainers here, the Cessna A.T. 17, and the North American A.T. 6 and the New Fairchild A.T. 14's are soon to be delivered.\n\n\"Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the Colonel and he said \"Welcome to North Africa.\" He has been there and guess he knows. Had our first dust storm this evening and this red sand starts blowing, its is pretty bad.\n\n\"There are no trees or grass in sight, but very little sage.\n\n\"This base was formerly a Glider School, in fact we are only the 2nd class of Cadets to be sent here, so naturally everything is a bit crude.\n\n\"Oh, how I would love to get some of that good old Iowa weather especially some of that clean, fresh air.\n\n\"Tell all my friends around Manning hello for me and thanks to the Legion for the paper. \"Oh yes, Fort Sumner is a town of 387 people! And to make matters worse, the banker and his wife are the only ones who speak English.\n\nThe nearest town is 62 miles which isn't exactly ideal.\n\nLt. Summerville Receives Wings\n\nMr. and Mrs. Alfred Spies entertained at a family dinner Thursday evening honoring her brother, Lt. David Summerville of Fort Sumner, N. M., who is home on furlough.\n\nLt. Summerville, the son of Mr. and Mrs. William Summerville a lieutenant in the army air corps received his wings as a pilot August 30 in a class of 96, completing nine months training.\n\nThere were several other Iowans in the class, including Lt. David M. Thayer, Cedar Rapids; Lt. Gerald H. Staussy, Algona; Lt. Verne Lewis, Des Moines; Lt. Laird P. McDonald, Des Moines and Lt. Grigg of Lawton.\n\nLt. Summerville has completed 271 flying hours. He will report at Roswell, New Mexico for further training Sept. 10. He expects to pilot a B-17.\n\nManning Monitor articles ------ 1944\n\nLt. Summerville at Roswell, N. M.\n\nLt. D. K. Summerville of the Air Corps, sends us a change of address, as he is now at Roswell. N. M. He writes Roswell is a beautiful place. One of the nicest I have been at.\n\nIt is one of the largest training fields in the U. S.\n\nWe fly B-17s, Boeing Flying Fortresses. The course is 9 weeks and upon graduation we are first pilots.\n\n\"Thank you for the Monitor. It is really fine to receive them.\n\nSomewhere in England May 2, 1944 The Manning Monitor,\n\nManning, Iowa, Gentlemen:\n\nAm sorry I haven't written you sooner but things have been happening at rather a furious rate and haven't had much of a chance.\n\nAs you have probably noticed, I am somewhere in England, and; right now, wonder if I would be to get the Monitor over here.\n\nI surely miss it and kindly let me; know the cost and postage fee and I shall be only to glad to return the same to you. Thank the Legion for the many issues I received while in the states.\n\nI was very much surprised and pleased with England. It is a very beautiful place and I can see why the English people have sacrificed so much to trying to preserve it. Thus far we have received grand treatment, both from the English Flying Officers and men, and from the civilians. They are most hospitable.\n\nI have gone on one raid so far. Yes, it was quite thrilling over enemy territory, and they didn't exactly welcome our presence, but I guess that is how the Flying Fortress got it's name.\n\nWell, I surely hope I will be able to receive the 'Monitor over here. Give my regards to all the folks around Manning.\n\nThanks again. Sincerely,\n\nDave Summerville.\n\n(Note: We're proud to inform you, Dave, that the Legion's courtesy is not confined to the States. The Monitor will follow you to any part of the world.)\n\nNEWS OF OTHERS IN SERVICE\n\nAnother B-17 crew left the State. recently headed by 1st Pilot Lt. D. K. Summerville, son of Mr. and Mrs. W. E.

SUMMERVILLE, 0-753822, Second Lieutenant, Air Corps, United States Army. For extraordinary achievement while serving as pilot of a B-17 airplane on a heavy bombardment mission over Germany, 26 May 1944. On this date the formation in which Lieutenant Summerville was flying was viciously attacked by a strong force of enemy fighters. His aircraft was so severely damaged that he was forced to leave the formation and hostile fighters pressed home their attacks with great determination.\n\nThe crew remained at their battle positions and successfully repelled the assaults. Meanwhile Lieutenant Summerville struggled to keep the airplane in level flight as a vibrating engine caused the control column to shake violently. Exerting tremendous pressure against the column to pre. vent stalling, he continued on the long flight back to England. While still deep in Germany two engines caught fire and the crew prepared to jump. At this time they were again attacked by enemy aircraft but the evasive action employed by Lieutenant Summerville succeeded in eluding them. He ordered the crew to remain and exhibiting outstanding skill succeeded in reaching the English channel before being forced to ditch the crippled aircraft.\n\nThe courage, coolness and devotion to duty displayed by Lieutenant Summerville resulted in the safe return of his crew and reflect the highest credit upon himself and the armed forces of the United States.
