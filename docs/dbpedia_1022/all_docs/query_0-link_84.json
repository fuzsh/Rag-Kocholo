Rather, it attempts to portray the combat experienced by these aircrews, in the air and on the ground, in southern and central Europe. Most of these stories are based on contemporary reports, recorded at the time or shortly after the events occurred. All quotations are taken from these documents. None have been reconstructed or enhanced, as the contemporary words of the participants themselves are the most accurate record of these events. —Kevin A. Mahoney 2015\n\n5\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nSUPREME SACRIFICE As the Allies thrust deep into Germany in late April 1945—the Soviet Army from the east and the American, British, and French armies from the west— the American Fifth and British Eighth Armies drove into northern Italy. By April 20, as the Russian army entered the suburbs of Berlin, the Fifth and the Eighth had fanned out over the Po River plain. A few days earlier, the Fifteenth Air Force, the American strategic air force that bombed the Axis in southern and central Europe, ended its strategic air campaign and concentrated on support of Allied ground troops in Italy. Railway marshalling yards were some of the prime targets as their destruction would impede the movement of supplies and troops to the beleaguered German and Italian troops trying to stem the Allied advance.\n\nOpposite page: This ﬂak-damaged 463rd Bomb Group Flying Fortress on ﬁre over Fortezza on April 20, 1945, is believed to be the plane piloted by Lt. John Cunningham. Above right: The insignia of Cunningham’s squadron, the 772nd Bomb Squadron. Kevin A. Mahoney\n\n7\n\nOn April 20, B-17 Flying Fortresses from the Fifteenth attacked the marshalling yards at Fortezza, near the Po River. Over the target, flak (German antiaircraft artillery) slammed a 463rd Bomb Group Fortress, Magnificent Malfunction, flown by 2nd Lt. John Cunningham. Just after the bombardier had called “bombs away,” more flak hit two engines, knocked out the intercom, and ravaged the center portion of the fuselage, including the radio compartment. Shrapnel killed the radio operator instantly, hitting him in the throat. The same burst practically decapitated the ball-turret gunner nearby, who had just gotten out of his turret. A waist gunner, Staff Sgt. James Wolfgang, was wounded in the knee, and the navigator, 2nd Lt. James Millar, was severely wounded in the stomach. Two crewmen unsuccessfully attempted to revive the radioman with oxygen. They also moved Lieutenant Millar from the nose of the ship to the partially destroyed radio compartment. The plane struggled on for about twenty minutes as the fuselage began to burn and smoke filled the cockpit. The flight engineer, Sgt. Conrad Bailey, later reported: “I asked him [Cunningham] if we could make it back [to base]. He didn’t know.” Lieutenant Cunningham then told Bailey to pass the word to the crew that it was time to bail out. Millar later recalled: “When I reached the radio room, I could see that the whole ship was empty, except for me, the pilot, and copilot.” He soon passed out from his wounds, and it was obvious that he could not bail out, or be bailed out, and survive. On the very slim chance that either radio operator or ball-turret gunner might still be alive, both were bailed out of the stricken ship with a static line to open their chutes once they had cleared the badly damaged bomber. Afterward the remaining crewmen also began to bail out. The bombardier, 2nd Lt. Alfred Baldwin, passed Cunningham and the copilot, 2nd Lt. Arthur Hall, at the controls in the cockpit as he passed through on the way to the waist of the aircraft to bail out. Hall followed him, but Cunningham heroically remained at the controls. He planned to ditch the rapidly disintegrating B-17 in the Po River to save the life of the navigator. The stricken bomber never made it to the river, but crashed nearby. Lieutenant Baldwin later reported: “After I landed I saw a thin column of black smoke rising several hundred feet in the air.”\n\n8\n\nChapter 1\n\nRight: The Mediterranean Theater of Operations citation for John Cunningham’s posthumous Distinguished Flying Cross.

US Air Force\n\nThe crash unfortunately killed Cunningham, but his attempt to save the life of navigator Millar was successful, although Millar’s back was broken in the crash. All the surviving crewmen were immediately taken prisoner by German troops. Navigator Millar was taken to a German hospital, and the Germans found and buried the bodies of the two dead men who had been bailed out. Lieutenant Millar provided a suitable epitaph for Cunningham: “[He] landed the ship to save me.” His selfless conduct led to recommendation for gallantry. Earlier if the war, he most likely would have been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, but in 1946 the army’s Mediterranean Theater of Operations posthumously awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross.i The Fifteenth Air Force, of which Cunningham was a member, bombed strategic targets in Europe during World War II along with the more famous Eighth Air Force. The Eighth, based in the England, bombed targets in Germany and northwestern Europe. Half the size of the Eighth, the Fifteenth operated over a wide geographical area, attacking targets in eleven different countries, from France to Bulgaria. Created in November 1943 from portions of the American Ninth and Twelfth Air Forces that had fought in the Mediterranean since the summer of 1942, its B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator bombers, escorted by P-38 Lightning, P-47 Thunderbolt, and P-51 Mustang fighters, took the air battle against the Axis to areas Allied bombers based in England could not reach in central and eastern Europe, including the oil refineries at Ploesti, Romania, vital to Germany’s war effort. Its crews fought weather, as well as the enemy, by flying over the Alps to reach many of their targets and made a significant contribution to the victory over Germany.\n\nSupreme Sacriﬁce\n\n9\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nDOGFIGHTS When the Fifteenth Air Force began operations on November 1, 1943, it possessed six heavy bomb groups, five medium bomb groups, and four fighter groups. The medium bomber groups transferred to the tactical air force in Italy, the Twelfth, within weeks, leaving the heavy bombers and fighters, all combat veterans, to carry out offensive operations. Some of the fighter groups had been flying in combat for almost a year, since the invasion of North Africa in November 1942. The 1st, 14th, and 82nd flew the two-engine Lockheed Lightning, while the 325th Fighter Group, operational with the Fifteenth in December, flew P-47B Thunderbolts. When the Fifteenth moved from North African bases to Italy at the end of 1943, neither aircraft had the range to escort the fledgling bomber force over the Alps, to targets in Germany and Austria. The Lightnings could, however, escort the bomber force of the Fifteenth to targets in Italy, southern France, and Greece. The Thunderbolts had a more limited range and usually escorted bombers on the outbound or homebound portions of a mission, often\n\nOpposite page: A ﬂight of Mustangs of the 31st Fighter Group in formation.\n\n11\n\nsplitting into two flights for his purpose. The major hazards they encountered were flak, enemy fighters, and engine failure, the latter a constant concern during missions for both aircraft. Although the Lightnings had two engines, they could be temperamental, and the failure of even one could lead to the loss of the aircraft, often over enemy territory.ii During the first nine months of Fifteenth Air Force operations, its fighters often tangled with enemy fighters attacking bomber formations. Just as long-range fighter types, the P-51 and long-range P-38J, arrived at the Fifteenth in April, Luftwaffe fighters began to directly engage the fighter escort as well. “Destroyer” Messerschmitt Me 109s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, equipped with light and heavy machine guns, fought with the American fighter escort, while Me 109s and Fw 190s equipped with both cannons and machine guns attacked the bombers. The German formations could be massive; one hundred to three hundred fighters attacked in “flying wedges” or waves that could last for a half hour or longer. As American fighters gained supremacy in the air during the spring of 1944, however, Luftwaffe fighters would make one pass against an American formation, often a bomber formation separated from the mass of bombers in the bomber column, then break away to find lone bomber stragglers, the preferred targets of German fighters.iii The inexperience of Luftwaffe fighter pilots committed to combat became evident in the spring of 1944, the result of high losses in pilots in the previous few months, most shot down by American fighters. The aircraft lost were replaced, but experienced pilots were not. Training of new pilots suffered, and they often entered combat with limited flight and tactical training that emphasized attacking bombers, not dogfighting with fighters. This, in combination with their inexperience, led to a reasonable fear of encountering American fighters Luftwaffepilots called Jaeger Schreck.iv Despite this inexperience many Luftwaffe fighter pilots continued to defend their homeland vigorously. During the mission to Wiener Neustadt on April 12, the 325th Fighter Group fought with more than fifty German fighters just before “bombs away.” The 325th bagged six enemy fighters in the dogfight, the first destroyed by Capt. Raymond Hartley, whom we will meet again later, earlier in the year. Near the target, he spotted a small group of Me 109s. As one flew underneath him, he got on its tail and fired, scoring hits that caused the Messerschmitt to dive. Hartley followed it down, firing, for about five thousand feet, then saw the pilot bail out. He continued to follow the enemy fighter down another five thousand feet, as it smoked and spun, until it hit the ground.\n\n12\n\nChapter 2\n\nAbove: An unidentiﬁed Luftwaffe pilot in the cockpit of his Me 109. Right: A close-up view of a P-38 ﬂying in formation over Italy.\n\nDogﬁghts\n\n13\n\n14\n\nChapter 2\n\nAbout ten minutes later, three more pilots scored victories. First Lieutenant James Strain saw an Me 109 lining up behind his flight leader, 1st Lt. Harry Parker, and tried to get in position to attack it head-on, but could not do so. Parker was unable to drop one of his wing tanks, and the Messerschmitt maneuvered into position, fired, and hit his Thunderbolt, forcing him to bail out. Fortunately, he survived to become a prisoner of war. Strain was then able to get on the tail of the Me 109, fired, and hit the cockpit. The German fighter made a diving turn, caught fire, and went down in flames. At the same time, another 325th pilot, 1st Lt. Richard Malloy, encountered two more Me 109s flying across his front. He immediately got on their tails and fired at the right-hand enemy, hitting its fuselage. The enemy fighter immediately turned, allowing Malloy to hit it again. The 109 then did several split S maneuvers and was seen by another pilot to go down to the ground without pulling out. While Malloy was busy, 2nd Lt. Benjamin Emmert damaged a third Messerschmitt. He went after the same pair of Messerschmitts as Malloy and made a good deflection shot at the left-hand aircraft, from about two hundred yards. The enemy fighter broke right, emitting white smoke from its engine, flew a split S, and dived out of sight. This was not the black smoke that 109s could emit when accelerating, but an obvious sign of damage to the engine. Although this fighter was not shot down, it was out of the fight. Five minutes after these two victories, two more Messerschmitts went down before the guns of the Thunderbolts. Second Lieutenant Essel Paulk was flying above and behind the bombers, keeping an eye out for attackers. He saw a lone Me 109 flying parallel to the bombers,\n\nOpposite page: The Focke-Wulf 190, one the major Luftwaffe antagonists to Fifteenth Air Force ﬁghters. Right: Luftwaffe ground crewmen prepare an Me 109 ﬁghter for takeoff.\n\nDogﬁghts\n\n15\n\napparently looking them over before attacking. Paulk called out the enemy fighter over the radio, then set out to attack it. Making a diving turn, he got into position on the tail of the enemy fighter, which made a slight turn, providing a better target. Paulk fired a burst, scoring direct hits on the Messerschmitt, and it exploded in the air. At the same time, 1st Lt. Richard Dunkin saw six Me 109s lining up to make an attack pass on several Liberators from the rear. He instantly dived on them and fired at one from above and directly behind it. The Messerschmitt flamed and began to disintegrate in midair. The last victory of the day for the 325th went to 1st Lt. Gilbert Gerkin, about five minutes after the two shot down by Paulk and Dunkin. Leading his flight, Gerkin saw a single Me 109 flying about five thousand feet below him. With his wingman, he dived on it as the 109 made for the deck. The wingman fired but missed. Gerkin got on its tail, closed to less than three hundred yards, and fired a short burst that hit the fuselage. The rear of the Messerschmitt burst into flames and plummeted to the ground, observed by the wingman. All these six victories were later confirmed.v Only a few days later, the 14th Fighter Group escorted Fifteenth Air Force bombers during the April 15 mission to Bucharest, Romania. Despite overcast that made a rendezvous with the bombers difficult, the group reached the target, where they encountered about twenty enemy fighters while answering a radio call for assistance from the bombers. They immediately engaged these Me 109s, and thirty more of the enemy soon joined the fracas. In the aerial melee that followed, the 14th destroyed five enemy aircraft. During the fight, Capt. Robert Zimmerman and his wingman, 2nd Lt. John Ingram, ran into trouble. Ingram reported that he had lost an engine and dived out of the fight. Unfortunately, his Lightning crashed and he was killed. Zimmerman soon found himself attacked by eight to ten Me 109s and pushed his throttles to the limit to get away, but he was still hit by enemy fire. “I ducked down behind the armor plating and then discovered my right engine was on fire,” he reported. Making himself as small as possible behind the armor plating in his seat for protection, Zimmerman watched as machinegun and cannon fire hit his right engine, which immediately began to burn. Then his cockpit exploded and caught on fire. He released his canopy, and the slipstream pulled him partially out of the cockpit. Releasing his safety belt, he was sucked out and waited until he had fallen several thousand feet before pulling his ripcord to get away from the Me 109s, which were sometimes known to fire upon Allied pilots who bailed out. Upon landing, he was soon captured by some Bulgarian policemen. “After their usual barrage of threats to shoot me, I was taken to a hospital and treated for burns and a dislocated shoulder,” he reported. After a month of rudimentary treatment, he was transferred to a Bulgarian prison camp, where he remained until liberated by Soviet troops on September 8, when he was taken by train, with other Allied prisoners, to Turkey.vi The next day, April 16, another fighter pilot had the unfortunate distinction of being shot down, not by the enemy, but by an American bomber. Soon after the 31st Fighter Group converted to P-51 Mustangs and began escorting Fifteenth bombers, the group escorted a raid on Turnu Severin in Romania. After rendezvousing with the bombers, the Mustangs began to weave back and forth over the bomber formation to stay with the bombers as their Mustangs flew almost one hundred miles per hour faster. During one weave, a Liberator fired on 1st Lt. Howard Baetjer, mistaking him for an Me 109. Mustangs were new to the Fifteenth Air Force,\n\n16\n\nChapter 2\n\nand their silhouette was not familiar to many gunners; to an uninformed eye constantly searching for enemy fighters, it could be mistaken for a Messerschmitt. As soon as the .50-caliber rounds hit the engine, it began to smoke and Baetjer had to bail out, but he was fortunate to land in a small town in Yugoslavia not occupied by German troops. Greeted by the people of the town, he was taken to a headquarters of the Chetniks, one of the two Partisan resistance groups fighting the Germans, where he remained for about ten days. During this time, the crew of a 301st Bomb Group Fortress, flown by the crew of 2nd Lt. Albert Romans, turned up. They had crash-landed in Yugoslavia after two engines had malfunctioned during the January 24 mission to Sofia, Bulgaria, and had only just arrived at the Chetnik headquarters after an arduous journey. Baetjer and Romans’s crew first moved to the town of Mihailovic, then finally reached an Allied landing strip in Partisan-controlled territory at the end of May. A C-47 flew them to Italy on May 28, and Baetjer returned to combat flying.vii Only three days after Baetjer returned to Italy, two squadrons of the 52nd Fighter Group went after a group of more than thirty enemy fighters, a mix of Me 109s, Romanian IAR 80s, and Italian-made fighters flown by Romanians, while escorting the 47th Bomb Wing to Ploesti on May 31. The 52nd shot down fifteen of the enemy, but lost two of their own. A flight leader, 1st Lt. Stanley Rollag, spotted three Me 109s underneath him and took his flight, 2nd Lts. Charles Denham and John Schumacher, in to attack them. Three Romanian IAR 80s got on the tail of the flight, but the Mustangs outturned them and got into firing position as the enemy planes dived toward the ground. Rollag fired at one, hitting it, and the enemy fighter crashed and burned. This was his second aerial victory, the first scored only the day before. As he pulled up, he saw another IAR 80 going down, shot down by Lieutenant Denham, whose Mustang was also damaged and was spinning toward the ground. Fortunately, Denham managed to bail out to become a prisoner of war in Romania. Lieutenant Schumacher got the third IAR 80, which also crashed. As he was climbing for altitude, he encountered another Romanian fighter, fired, and damaged it, but yet another Romanian got on his tail. Schumacher turned near the bomber formation with the Romanian aircraft following, and the bomber formation fired at both aircraft. Schumacher and the IAR 80 turned away, and the latter disappeared. While Rollag’s flight was in action, the flight led by Capt. Edwin Fuller located three more IAR 80s. He went after them with 2nd Lt. John Karle following him. Fuller fired on one Romanian, hit it hard, and had the satisfaction of seeing it crash to the ground. As he pulled up from this victory, an Me 109 flew underneath him. He turned, pursued, and fired at it, blowing off part of a wing. The Messerschmitt immediately went into a death dive. Karle then chased after a Romanian Air Force Macchi C.200, following him in a dive for ten thousand feet. In his own words: “I gave him several bursts on the way down and saw hits on the fuselage, engine, and cockpit. He slowed up and was out of control as I pulled up.” The C.200 went out of control, and another pilot in the group saw it dive straight toward the ground. Karle tried to rejoin his flight, but he couldn’t find it as his engine began to act up a bit, so he turned for home and climbed for altitude. When he reached Yugoslavia, he found that his fuel supply was very low. With his engine running roughly, he considered trying to land, but decided to jump as the territory below looked too rough for a landing. He radioed his predicament to his comrades, but found that he couldn’t hear their answer. Karle later reported: “I throttled back to 130 mph, jettisoned my canopy without trouble, and bailed out,” making a good landing on a\n\nDogﬁghts\n\n17\n\nhillside and met some Yugoslav peasants within a half hour who helped him reach Partisans, and eventually Italy, in late June. The total score of victories for the 52nd was fifteen for the day, as the 2nd Fighter Squadron accounted for another nine enemy fighters.viii Besides such escort missions, fighters also took part in all of the Fifteenth Air Force shuttle missions flown to Russia during the summer of 1944. The first such mission was an escort of bombers during Operation Frantic Joe in early June. The second and third, however, were exclusively fighter operations after forty-three Eighth Air Force Fortresses were destroyed by a surprise Luftwaffe raid on their shuttle base in Poltava, in the Ukraine, on June 22. The second shuttle mission flew to Russia on July 22. Lightnings from the 82nd Fighter Group strafed enemy airfields at Buzau and Zeilestia, Romania, while Lightnings from the 14th and Mustangs from the 31st flew as top cover. During the mission, the 31st encountered an Me 109, an Me 410, and several Fw 190s. The Mustangs quickly shot four of them down. Then an aerial melee ensued when thirty Fw 190s suddenly dived out of the sun and the Lightnings turned to meet them. The 190s mostly attacked in pairs, with each fighter firing at American aircraft in turn. American pilots found their opponents to be both experienced and aggressive. The dogfight lasted forty minutes and ended with eleven enemy planes downed by the 14th and another five by the 82nd. Strafing destroyed or damaged forty-one enemy fighters on the fields. Five Lightnings went down during the battle, however. An Fw 190 got on the tail of 1st Lt. John Griffin from the 82nd. His Lightning began to burn, then the right wing came off and he crashed into the ground. In retaliation, 1st Lt. Leroy Lette shot down the attacker just after he broke away from nailing Griffin. Flak hit 2nd Lt. Andie McPhee’s Lightning while he strafed the field, and he was killed. Lieutenant Earl Freestone from the 82nd also went down, becoming a prisoner of war. An Fw 190 shot down 2nd Lt. George O’Connor from the 14th. As cannon rounds splintered his canopy and instrument, O’Connor bailed out, also to be taken prisoner, as did 2nd Lt. Donald West, also from the 14th. He and his wingman, 1st Lt. William Chusin, had gone after an Me 109 during the strafing until the enemy broke away. During the chase, another Me 109 got on West’s tail and shot up his engine. It began to burn, so West rolled the Lightning over and bailed out, to reach the ground safely. The remaining aircraft continued on to airfields in the Ukraine: the 82nd to Poltava, the 14th to Mirgorod, and the 31st to Piryatin as Russian Yak-9 fighters met some of the American fighters over the Ukraine to lead them to their temporary Russian airfields. These fields were of simple, steel-plank construction, and grass had grown through many planks, making the strips difficult for the American pilots to spot. After two days of bad weather, the three groups flew another strafing mission to Mielec, in Poland, on July 25. Strafing destroyed some planes on the ground, but the 31st, flying top cover for strafing Lightnings, had a field day with the enemy aircraft they encountered in the air, destroying twenty-nine of them and earning a Distinguished Unit Citation. The Mustangs began their score with an He 111 and two Ju 52s that had blundered into the area. Then a thunderstorm split up the flights of the 31st, and one flight ran into a gaggle of Ju 87 dive-bombers flying a groundsupport mission for German troops facing the Soviet Army. A slaughter followed, and more than twenty of the went down to Mustang machine-gun fire. The next day, the three groups returned to Italy, strafing airfields in Romania again, destroying sixteen more enemy aircraft on the way home, but losing three Lightnings. .\n\n18\n\nChapter 2\n\nRight: Lieutenant John Voll, of the 31st Fighter Group, in the cockpit of his P-51 Mustang. He is credited with twenty-one aerial victories between June and October 1944. Below: Lieutenant Walter Goehausen sits in the cockpit of his P-51B Mustang, June 1944. A member of the 31st Fighter Group, he was officially credited with ten enemy aircraft destroyed.\n\nDogﬁghts\n\n19\n\nThe last fighter shuttle mission flown by the Fifteenth Air Force a short time later on August 4, 1944, included the dramatic rescue of a fighter pilot. Lightnings and Mustangs again strafed Romanian airfields but lost ten aircraft. One of them was a P-38 flown by 1st Lt. Richard Willsie, a flight leader in the 82nd Fighter Group. Flak hit his Lightning before he reached the enemy airfield, and he lost an engine. He continued on the mission, however, and strafed the field with the other planes, but flak then hit his second engine and he announced over the radio that he was going to have to crash-land. A member of his flight, Flying Officer Richard Andrews, heard the message and told him he would pick him up if he managed to crash-land in a suitable field. Willsie picked out a wheat field about fifteen miles from the Romanian airfield at Foscani and landed safely, hitting his face on the padded gun sight, otherwise uninjured. He quickly jumped out of the Lightning and, using a small phosphorus charge, set his plane on fire. Romanian troops in the distance, who had seen him crash, began to fire at him. As he ran for some trees, he saw Andrews landing along the line of the furrows in the field and ran toward the Lightning. Andrews threw out his parachute to accommodate Willsie, and the latter jumped on the wing, then climbed into the cockpit and sat in front of Andrews on his lap. As he was in front, he would fly the Lightning. Andrews had to put his right leg over Willsie’s shoulder so the control column was accessible during the flight home. As this rescue was going on, several other Lightnings from the 82nd flew overhead to protect them from Romanian troops. A half-dozen Me 109s were also in the area. Having seen the crash and subsequent landing, they awaited their chance to strafe the two aircraft still on the ground. One foolishly tried to do so and was shot down by 1st Lt. Nathaniel Pape. Unfortunately, another of the P-38s, flown by 2nd Lt. James Hardin, was hit by flak and exploded in the air, killing Hardin. When the pair in the P-38 was ready, Willsie began to take off. The nose wheel temporarily dug into the plowed field, but an application of trim tabs raised the nose, and the aircraft moved, then took off, just missing some trees at one end of the field. They flew to southern Russia, as briefed, hugging the ground to avoid German and Russian flak, as the latter could, and did, fire at American aircraft. They arrived safely at the American base at Poltava and surprised the maintenance crews when two pilots emerged from the Lightning. Immediately upon their return to Italy on August 6, Gen. Nathan Twining, commander of the Fifteenth Air Force, decorated Andrews with the Silver Star and promoted him to second lieutenant.ix Beginning the next month, fighter attacks on Fifteenth Air Force formations became noticeably less numerous as the campaign to bomb German oil facilities began to severely limit the availability of fuel for the Luftwaffe. This factor, and the established supremacy of American escort fighters in the skies of Europe, led the Germans to forbid attacks on American bomber formations unless their fighters had overwhelming superiority. The Eighth Air Force bore the brunt of such attacks after August 1944 as the Luftwaffe concentrated their dwindling day fighter forces against them. The Fifteenth still occasionally encountered enemy fighters, however, in the months to come. One of these engagements took place during the October 16 mission by the 5th Bomb Wing to bomb the oil refinery at Brux, Czechoslovakia. The 325th Fighter Group was one of the escorting fighter groups, and a flight of four of its Mustangs attacked a group of about fifty Me 109s and Fw 190s when they made an attack pass on the bomber formation. Second Lieutenant Sheldon Anderson, a flight leader, spotted the enemy fighters and dived on them, with the sun behind him. The Germans were completely surprised, and they did not\n\n20\n\nChapter 2\n\nPilots from the 325th Fighter Group chat with a Soviet officer at a Russian base during the ﬁrst Russian shuttle mission, ﬂown by the Fifteenth Air Force in early June 1944.\n\nrelease their drop tanks until the Mustangs were upon them. Half the enemy fighters fled, but the other half chose to stay and fight, and an air battle ensued between the four Mustangs and twenty to twenty-five Me 109s and Fw 190s that lasted about fifteen minutes, beginning at thirtytwo thousand feet and ending very close to the ground. At the start the action, Anderson closed to within fifty feet of an Fw 190, fired, and hit its fuselage. The enemy exploded before him, his first victory of the day. Immediately afterward,\n\nhe went after an Me 109, again flew within fifty feet of it, and fired at the engine and fuselage. It also exploded. Another member of his flight, 1st Lt. Leonard Voss, got within one thousand feet of an Me 109 during the surprise onslaught. He fired, and although he didn’t see any of his rounds strike the enemy fighter, its pilot immediately bailed out. He then turned on another Me 109 that was going after another Mustang. He came up on the enemy fighter dead astern and got within five hundred feet before he opened fire. He scored a number of hits on the engine wing, and the Messerschmitt caught fire. This enemy pilot also bailed out. A third member of the flight, 2nd Lt. Vernon Kahl, also got two fighters in the melee. During the initial surprise assault, he went after an Fw 190 from the rear. When he fired at it, his .50-caliber slugs laced the inside wing, fuselage, and engine. The Focke-Wulf began to emit smoke, turned slightly, then suddenly exploded, diving in flames. Almost immediately, Kahl got onto the tail of another Me 109, fired, and hit the engine, wing roots, and fuselage. The Messerschmitt began to burn with its engine on fire and spiraled down to the ground. About ten minutes later, Anderson spotted an Me 109 and got on its tail, firing several bursts and hitting the fuselage. This Messerschmitt went into a spin and, before it entered the clouds\n\nBrigadier General Dean Strother, commander of the 305th Fighter Wing, and Carl Schoeniger, head of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, listen to Flying Officer Andrews describe his daring rescue of squadron mate Willsie on his return to Italy.\n\n22\n\nChapter 2\n\nbelow, caught fire. Three minutes after this kill, Anderson spotted another Me 109 and got on its tail. This time, his .50-caliber bursts hit the cockpit and wings. The pilot was apparently hit, as the plane came out of a turn, then appeared to fall flat toward the ground, tail down. It entered low clouds, then emerged still headed for the ground. By this time, the four Mustangs involved were forced to break off the engagement when they ran out of ammunition. Anderson received confirmation for the three of his claims, with the other a probable. Voss and Kahl also got confirmation of their two successes each.x While losses of fighters in aerial combat declined, flak continued to claim fighters, as it did bombers. Flak damage led to loss of two of four Lightnings by the 14th Fighter Group while escorting Liberators of the 55th Bomb Wing on the December 17 mission to Blechhammer during the Oil Blitz, the two-week campaign to finish off most German oil refineries, that month. Flak hit one P-38, flown by 1st Lt. George Johnson, over Gyor, Hungary. His Lightning caught fire and spun in, crashing on the ground. Fortunately, he was able to bail out to become a prisoner of war. Another pilot, 2nd Lt. Lorenz Weiglein, also went down on the mission. On the return flight, the supercharger on his right engine stopped functioning, and he was forced to increase power in the left engine. He cross-fed this engine from the fuel tanks in the right wing but reported that while switching tanks, “my right engine coughed once or twice and then caught fire. White, acrid smoke started to fill the cockpit.” His flight leader radioed him that his engine was on fire. He changed the fuel mixture and this temporarily subdued the flames, but soon the fire increased again. He was told to feather the engine, which he did. “The smoke was very dense in the cockpit now and I was choking. I was told to bail out. . . . I popped the canopy and rolled down the window. At this stage I was feeling very groggy. . . . [I] rolled into my dead engine and left the plane when I thought it was inverted.” It was really in a shallow dive, however, right-side up. Weiglein managed to get halfway out of the cockpit before the slipstream pinned him against the back. Using his hands and feet, he thrust himself out and fell about four thousand feet before he pulled his ripcord. He was over the Adriatic Sea, close to the coast of Yugoslavia, off the port of Split. He tried to sideslip his chute toward land but still landed in the water. He got out of his parachute harness, then swam under the canopy and surfaced clear of it. He inflated his “Mae West” life vest and then his dingy, but he was only in the water for about ten minutes when a Yugoslav steam ship, crewed by Partisans, turned up and rescued him, although the area was heavily mined. The Partisans took him first to Split, then to Vis the next day. After a visit to the American mission on the island, he traveled by steamship to Bari, Italy, where he arrived on December 20.xi One of the last large engagements of Fifteenth Air Force fighters with German fighters took place on March 15, during a mission to bomb the marshalling yards in the town of Nove Zamky, in Czechoslovakia. During the flight home, the 325th Fighter Group had several encounters with German fighters, Fw 190s and Me 109s. The Focke-Wulfs were ground-support aircraft operating in the vicinity of the Soviet-German front line, then less than fifty miles from Nove Zamky, and their pilots were no match for the experienced dogfighters of the 325th. Much of the action took place at relatively low altitude for bomber escorts, eight thousand feet and below. Captain Leonard Voss, whom we have met before (now promoted to captain), and 2nd Lt. Robert Burns scored the first victories, shortly after one o’clock in the afternoon. Voss went after\n\nDogﬁghts\n\n23\n\nan Me 109G that approached his flight from below. Both fighters circled each other until Voss got the chance to fire at the enemy fighter from a high deflection angle and managed to hit the engine and cockpit. The Gustav immediately caught fire and spiraled to the ground. Lieutenant Burns caught sight of an Fw 190 that immediately dived into clouds below. He followed and opened fire while closing to five hundred feet, scoring hits on its engine. The stricken fighter immediately turned over and dived into the ground. About ten minutes later, 2nd Lt. Joseph Barton saw another Focke-Wulf at 8,000 feet and dived on it. He opened fire from 750 feet and hit the wing roots of the Focke-Wulf, which immediately went into a vertical dive, from only 2,000 feet. At the same time, Capt. Harry Parker, whom we also met earlier and who had also been promoted to captain, spotted another FockeWulf and dived on it as well. He began to fire when some distance from the enemy, continuing to do so until he was only 50 feet away. He plastered the 190, and pieces flew off it. It went into a spin, and the pilot bailed out, but his parachute did not open. The action continued, as shortly thereafter 2nd Lt. Ernest Bradley and 1st Lt. John Henry each bagged a Focke-Wulf. Henry fired about 2,000 feet away from the enemy fighters, but his\n\nSmoke rises through the smoke screen over the Xenia Oil Reﬁnery in Ploesti, Romania as 49th Bomb Wing Liberators pass by on the way home after bombing the plant on August 10, 1944.\n\nFifteenth Air Force Lightnings leave contrails behind during a dogﬁght over Czechoslovakia in the late summer of 1944.\n\nmarksmanship immediately scored hits that caused the Luftwaffe pilot to jettison his canopy and bail out. Bradley’s prey tried to dive away from him, and Bradley began fire while still 1,500 feet from the enemy. His .50-caliber machine-gun rounds were also right on target, hitting the enemy fighter’s engine and cockpit. The Focke-Wulf immediately caught fire and headed for the ground. Five minutes later, five 325th pilots each shot down a Focke-Wulf. First Lieutenant Walter Selenger scored hits on the wing root of one, at a range varying from 3,000 to 1,000 feet. His quarry rolled over, did a split S maneuver, and crashed into the ground. Second Lieutenant William Aron attacked another, scoring hits on the fuselage that caused it to immediately crash into the ground. Harry Parker took a crack at his second Focke-Wulf. He began firing at 4,500 feet from the enemy fighter and continued to fire bursts until only 50 feet away. He hit the wing root and fuselage, and\n\nDogﬁghts\n\n25\n\nthe enemy fighter crashed into the ground. A fourth Focke-Wulf went down to the guns of 1st Lt. Joseph Pace, who began firing while still 3,000 feet away. His rounds hit the 190’s wings, and the enemy began to smoke and soon crashed into the ground. Second Lieutenant Paul Murphy brought down the fifth enemy loss. He got on the tail of the enemy fighter and shot it down, but immediately headed for nearby Russian lines, as he was low on fuel. He managed to crash-land behind Russian lines and returned to the 325th in early April. During this dogfight, 1st Lt. Gordon McDaniel accounted for five more of the enemy all by himself, high above the melee already described. He encountered four Focke-Wulfs at seventeen thousand feet. He fired at one from two hundred feet and hit the tail, fuselage, and wings; the target dived into overcast and exploded. He got another Focke-Wulf from much longer range as his machine-gun fire hit the wings and fuselage. Pieces flew off, and it began to burn. His wingman, Lieutenant Burns, saw it hit the ground. McDaniel spotted another Focke-Wulf directly behind him, turned, got on the enemy’s tail, and fired, damaging it severely. The enemy pilot tried to escape by diving into undercast, but a wing came off, the Fw 190 caught fire, and it spun into the clouds below. A fourth enemy went down as McDaniel drew to within six hundred feet to finish it off. A wing came off this enemy fighter, too, and it crashed. The pilot of his fifth victim attempted to bail out after McDaniel’s fire riddled his entire aircraft, but his chute failed to open. Shortly after McDaniel’s excellent work, Lieutenant Aron got his second victory of the day. He dived on a Focke-Wulf and riddled its tail and wings. The enemy aircraft headed down and crashed. By two o’clock the action was almost over, but two more 325th pilots got in their licks, one shooting down three more of the enemy. First Lieutenants Thomas Bevan and James Chamberlin each got a Focke-Wulf at the same time, Bevan attacking one that dived into the undercast below to escape. He followed, firing and hitting its fuselage and wings as the enemy continued its dive, to crash into the ground. Chamberlin changed the victim class a bit by attacking an Me 109, one of a formation of six he encountered. He fired from about four hundred yards away and hit the cockpit. The Messerschmitt lowered its wheels, a sign of surrender, as it began to burn. The enemy pilot did not bail out, however, staying with the aircraft until it went into the ground. Five minutes after these two combats, Bevan met up with another Focke-Wulf at only two thousand feet. He got on its tail and fired, hitting the fuselage. The 190 made a split S turn, then crashed into the ground. Just after dispatching this aircraft, Bevan made the final kill of the day for the 325th. Still at low altitude, he got on the tail of another 190, fired, and hit its fuselage. The enemy fighter immediately went into a dive, and his wingman saw it crash into the ground. Of the twenty-one combats described here, the 325th eventually received confirmation for twenty, an unusually high tally for any fighter group in the Mediterranean Theater in the final months of the war.xii ***** As encounters with piston-engine fighters began to decline sharply for the fighters of the Fifteenth, they began to meet with a menace of the future: jet fighters. Although German jets initially went after photo reconnaissance flights, during the second half of 1944, as they developed tactics and pilots became familiar with their revolutionary aircraft, they began to appear when bombing missions penetrated Germany, at the end of the year. The Mustang escort during the December 9\n\n26\n\nChapter 2\n\nLieutenants Voss, Anderson, and Kahl after the aerial battle of October 16, 1944.\n\nmission to bomb oil storage in the city of Regensburg was one of the first to encounter them, and several pilots from the 332nd Fighter Group, known as the Red Tails, reported their encounters with this elusive foe. Near the target, Lt. Alvin Temple noticed an Me 262 ahead of the bomber formation. Suddenly it turned swiftly and approached his Mustang, flying ahead, well out of range. Temple dropped his wing fuel tanks in preparation for combat and tried to turn inside the jet, but the latter stayed out of range as it turned and headed toward a Lightning from the 1st Fighter Group that had joined the mission when weather prevented the group from their briefed mission to escort some Liberators. The Lightning dived out of danger, and the jet tried to turn inside it. Temple reported: “I was in trail but I attempted to turn inside in an effort to close the distance between my aircraft and that of the enemy aircraft. The jet-propelled aircraft made a 180 degree turn. . . .” During this turn, Temple “picked up a lead. Although the jet-propelled aircraft was out of range, I fired at it. No damage was observed.” The jet then headed toward the bomber formation and flew alongside them, but did not attack.xiii Another Red Tail, Lt. Edward Thomas, also had a crack at an Me 262 on the same mission. His flight went after one that turned in front of them. Thomas was in a position to make a deflection shot from less than five hundred yards. He later reported: “He passed through my sights so fast that it is unlikely I hit him.”xiv His flight, and Mustangs from another group, attempted to follow the Messerschmitt without success as the jet dived swiftly away.xv Such inconclusive engagements with bomber formations continued sporadically for the next few months, until March, when jets began to attack bombers in earnest. After several engagements with Eighth Air Force missions early in the month, jets attacked several Fifteenth Air Force missions in late March. During one of the longest missions flown by the Fifteenth, to Berlin on March 24, the 332nd Fighter Group tangled with jets and came out ahead. Not only were Me 262s involved, but also Me 163s, another German jet fighter. Shortly after noon, as the bomber formation was approaching Berlin, the Mustangs of the 332nd, flying above them, engaged enemy fighters in a dogfight that continued for almost twenty minutes. Two Me 262s attacked 1st Lts. Robert Williams and Samuel Watts when they were flying one above the other. Williams rolled over, stalled, and succeeded in getting on the tail of one of the jets as the enemy went into a shallow turn. He later reported: “I picked up a 2 1/2 radii lead [in my gun sight] on the jet on the right and fired a long burst. I fired another burst and held it for about two seconds. I noticed hits on the aircraft and saw him fall out of formation and I believe he went down.”xvi\n\nDogﬁghts\n\n27\n\n28\n\nAbove: Gun camera stills showing an Fw 190 being shot down by an American ﬁghter, 1944.

The 325th received a Distinguished Unit Citation, and Baseler the Silver Star Medal, for the successful mission.\n\nAt about the same time, Lt. Joseph Chineworth spotted the jets making an attack pass at the bombers and, dropping his wing tanks, dived after them. A jet passed in front of him and, joined by the number four in his flight, he went after it. Chineworth later said: “I made a ninety degree left turn and was on the tail of the jet about 1,500 feet away. I fired three long bursts and then my guns stopped. I saw hits and pieces flew off his plane. Black smoke came from the enemy aircraft as he started into what appeared to be an uncontrolled dive. . . . My attack lasted for about five minutes.”xvii Second Lieutenant Charles Brantley was flying with his wingman when two Me 262s passed them, not at full power. Brantley went after one: “I dropped my nose, being well within range, and made several bursts on the ship that was in front of me, from dead astern. My flight leader fired on the other. The jets broke in a slow turn in opposite directions, pulling us apart. I followed my target in a dive for a short while observing hits on the fuselage. I then broke off to join my flight leader. . . . As I broke away, the Me 262 steepened its rate of turn and dive. It was seen by my flight leader and other pilots to go down in flames.”xviii Lieutenant Reid Thompson saw three Me 262s making several attack passes on the Fortresses. He dived after them with his wing tanks still attached, but other Mustangs overtook him, so he pulled up, dropping his wing tanks. Thompson reported: I saw an Me 163 in a turn to the left at two o’clock to me. I tightened my turn and fired two bursts . . . but I was out of range, at about 4,000 feet. The jet went into a dive . . . and I dived behind him, still out of range and looking for him to pull up and allow me a shot at him. We began to dive from 26,000 feet and on the way down, he did three barrel rolls . . . and I rolled with him. . . . I pulled out of the dive at 10,000 feet and leveled off. . . . [W]hen I last saw him he was still going down. I circled the area where I last saw him and located a puff of smoke and wreckage where I judged him to have gone in.xix\n\nDogﬁghts\n\n29\n\nFirst Lieutenant Roscoe Brown saw three Me 262s making a head-on attack on the bomber formation from below. He dropped his tanks and intercepted them, firing at the rightmost jet. He opened fire while 2,400 feet away and the jet dived for the ground with Brown in pursuit, but he soon had to pull out as the jet was going much too fast to overtake. He then spotted four more Me 262s going in the opposite direction, 3,000 feet below him. He turned around and gave chase, latching onto another jet that was climbing near him. He reported, “I saw a lone Me 262 at 24,000 feet, climbing at ninety degrees to me and 2,500 feet from me. I pulled up at him . . . and fired three long bursts at him from 2,000 feet . . . Almost immediately the pilot bailed out. . . .”xx Edward Thomas, promoted to captain since the mission of December 9, and Lt. Vincent Mitchell also took part in the action. Thomas saw two Me 262s attacking the bombers, and the two dropped their wing tanks and set off in pursuit. Thomas reported: “The two Me 262s were in a loose string, so we attempted to catch the rear jet. Lieutenant Mitchell . . . closed with the ME to a range of about 450 yards and started firing from a forty-five degree deflection and we both observed hits on the jet. He apparently had not realized we were so close to him, for as soon as the hits were observed, he pulled up his nose, did a quarter roll to the right, and split ‘s’ed away from us.”xxi First Lieutenant Earl Lane had the last encounter in this fight. He saw three Me 262s pass underneath him, flying from left to right, preparing to attack the bombers. They were too far away to attack, but he soon spotted a lone Me 262 in a shallow dive attacking the bombers. He reported: “The Me 262 was in a thirty degree dive, coming across the bomber formation. He appeared as if he was peeling for an attack on the bombers, I came in for a thirty-degree deflection shot from 2,000 feet. He did not quite fully fill my gun sight. I fired\n\n30\n\nChapter 2\n\nAbove: A P-51C Mustang of the 332nd Fighter Group, piloted by Capt. Andrew Turner, taxies prior to takeoff. A ground crewman sits on the wing to direct the pilot.

I saw a crash and a puff of black smoke.”xxii In the final action of the day, Flying Officer Thurston Gaines spotted three Me 262s diving line astern on the rear of the bomber formation. Gaines dropped his wing tanks and went after one of the three after it had shot down a Flying Fortress. Finding that he could not keep up with the jet, he climbed away and spotted another Me 262 also in a turn, just off his nose. “I soon discovered that his rate of speed was too fast for me to close with him,” reported Gaines. “Consequently, I started a climbing turn to the right at approximately 20,000 feet, when I observed an Me 262 in a steep right turn [at] about one o’clock, slightly high. I pulled the nose of my aircraft up and started firing from about 2,000 feet . . . and closed to approximately 800 feet . . . No strikes were observed nor did the enemy aircraft attempt to take evasive action.”xxiii Brantley, Lane, and Brown were later credited with confirmed kills.xxiv ***** Encounters with enemy fighters while escorting bombers were not the only opportunities for fighter pilots of Fifteenth to add to their score. Another mission type that often led to dogfights with enemy fighters was the fighter “sweep” of enemy airspace, a patrol intended to engage any enemy aircraft encountered. During one such sweep on January 21, 1944, the 325th Fighter Group took part in an aerial melee that netted four enemy fighters destroyed in the vicinity of Florence, Italy. As the Thunderbolts flew at fifteen thousand feet, 1st Lt. William Elliott, one of the flight leaders, spotted enemy fighters and called out, “Boogies low at eleven o’clock!” The squadron leader\n\nDogﬁghts\n\n31\n\n32\n\nChapter 2\n\nOpposite page: A Fifteenth Air Force P-51 Mustang, possibly from the 332nd Fighter Group, takes off from an airﬁeld in Italy.

They dived on the enemy fighters, six Fw 190s that were climbing to engage the P-47s, in a line abreast. Elliott took the leftmost three and Hartley the right three. Elliott was slightly ahead of Hartley and opened fire first, accompanied by his wingman, 2nd Lt. Fielder Smith. The Focke-Wulfs performed a split S, and Elliott aimed at the one farthest to the right, firing into its underside. Parts of the fighter flew off and it caught fire; the aircraft rolled on its back, and the pilot bailed out. Smith then took on the Focke-Wulf in the middle, leveling out from his dive and firing two bursts into its fuselage and wings. The 190 slowed, and Smith flew past it just as the pilot bailed out. The third Focke-Wulf then turned and began to pursue him. Elliott turned into it, but his gun sight had burned out. He aimed by eye and fired as he chased this enemy toward the ground, outturning him and finally pulling away as he dropped his wing tanks. Elliott and the German pilot made four passes at each other without either inflicting any damage before Elliott ran out of ammunition and decided to head for home. He applied emergency power and easily outran the Focke-Wulf. Hartley was only seconds behind and chose one of the Fw 190s on the right, following it through a half roll and continuing to dive for two thousand feet, when he dropped his wings tanks and switched to his main tanks, causing a momentary drop in speed. Another P-47 pulled ahead of him, and they both chased the Focke-Wulf down to the deck. The interloper fired and scored a few hits on the 190’s wing, then broke away to the left. Hartley continued his pursuit as the Focke-Wulf continued to weave, and eventually shortened the range.\n\nDogﬁghts\n\n33\n\nLeft: A gun camera photo from an American ﬁghter of the other Luftwaffe jet, the Me 163 “rocket ﬁghter” chased by an American ﬁghter.

The FW then rolled easily onto its back . . . as a large sheet of flame came off his belly at the wing root [and then] he split s’ed into the ground from one hundred feet,” he reported. Another pilot, Flying Officer Harry Carroll, also claimed a Focke-Wulf in the melee. He went after two more of the six Fw 190s originally sighted until the enemy pair separated. He pursued one of them, dropped his wing tanks, and went to emergency power until he came within firing range after a five-minute chase. He opened fire, hit the Focke-Wulf hard, and watched it go into the ground from only fifty feet altitude.xxv\n\n34\n\nChapter 2\n\nDogﬁghts\n\n35\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nSTRAFING As noted early in the last chapter, fighter pilots usually encountered their other major concern, flak, over a target—as missions were planned to avoid known concentrations of flak en route to their objectives—or during strafing missions. While escorting bombers during the first Fifteenth Air Force mission to Greece on November 15, 1943, flak damaged a Lightning of the 1st Fighter Group piloted by 2nd Lt. James McClure. After the bombers hit their target, the airfield at Eleusis, near Athens, a flak burst hit his left wing between the cockpit and the left engine, damaging the engine. The P-38 immediately lost airspeed and began to trail the bombers. His comrades initially flew above him, providing cover from any German fighters that might be looking for an easy victory over a damaged fighter. McClure was unable to feather the propeller on the damaged engine, however, and continued to lose altitude as his speed dropped. After about twenty minutes, he had dropped so far behind the bombers and fighters that the latter could no longer cover him, and he disappeared from view. He radioed, “It looks like this is it.” Further attempts to contact him were unsuccessful. His Lightning crashed near Thebes, Greece, close to Athens. His body was found near the plane. His remains were buried in the American cemetery at Nettuno, Italy, resting with many of those killed at Anzio.xxvi\n\nOpposite page: P-38 Lightnings of the 1st Fighter Group return to their base in Italy after a bomber escort mission that included the straﬁng of ground targets in Austria.\n\n37\n\nWhile heavy flak led to McClure’s loss, light flak and small-arms fire were often encountered by fighters strafing at low altitudes, making such missions particularly dangerous. If enemy fire damaged a fighter, there was little altitude, and hence little time, to handle the situation or bail out, and pilots often went straight in to crash or crash-land. On January 22, 1944, Lightnings from the 82nd and 14th Fighter Groups flew close to the deck on a strafing mission near the town of Frosinone, east of Anzio, where Allied troops had landed the previous day. They damaged about twenty vehicles during their strafing runs. The crews of the vehicles were too busy taking cover to offer resistance, but flak emplacements in the area put up intense, light flak, mostly of the thirty-seven-millimeter variety. They failed to hit any of the American aircraft, however, and both groups began the return flight to base unhindered. On the return flight, the formation flew over a flak concentration in a valley. The 82nd, in the lead, got through unscathed, but as Lightnings of the 14th passed overhead, the German gunners were ready. Despite the P-38s taking evasive action, flak damaged several of them, including that flown by 2nd Lt. Paul Wingert. The damage was slight, but Wingert’s Lightning veered to the right, and he became separated from the others in this flight. He gained altitude to contact Big Fence, the Fifteenth Air Force beacon, which quickly gave him a heading for Allied lines. Flak had been following him during this climb, so he dived to avoid it, but as he later wrote: “On the way down and only a second or two after I started, I met a bundle of TNT coming up. My first sensation was big jar. . . . I knew from the way my ship jumped that I had been hit on the right side. The next thing I saw was big bump on top of my engine.” Then he noticed smoke streaming from the engine. “At the bottom of the engine, I saw an even bigger hole. . . . My hands did a war dance all over the cockpit, getting everything to that engine shut off and the prop feathered. In those few seconds, I still hoped to save the ship.” Suddenly smoke began to enter the cockpit, and he decided to bail out: “I immediately pulled the emergency canopy release and started out; however I was going awfully fast . . .” The force of the slipstream moving past his plane meant he could make it only partway out of the cockpit as the slipstream pinned him against it. Wingert got back into the cockpit, calmly pulled the stick back to lower his speed, then stood on the seat to push himself out of the cockpit. “I remember just faintly that the fire came up in my face,” he wrote, but his flight gear, goggles, and oxygen mask protected him, and his next recollection was “falling straight down head first.”\n\n38\n\nChapter 3\n\nDespite losing a large portion of the rudder of his Mustang to ground ﬁre, Lt. Kenneth Steglein of the 325th Fighter Group managed to bring his aircraft home. Here, he examines the damage with members of his ground crew.\n\nMachine-gun ﬁre from a straﬁng American ﬁghter destroys a Heinkel He 177 bomber, early in the winter of 1945.\n\nAlthough the slipstream momentarily pinned his arms to his sides, he still managed to pull the ripcord, which promptly came away without opening the parachute. “I waited for what I thought ought to be long enough for the chute to open; then wondered if it was stuck,” he reported. Feeling for the parachute, “I streamlined my hands along the sides and tried to pull [it] out.” It began to come out of the pack, but “as the chute went out, somehow the shrouds got wrapped around my legs. At that time I thought it was the end . . . when I looked back over my shoulder there was just a streamer of white flapping back there. I was sure it was the end and then the thing opened.” He floated down toward a soldiers’ bivouac, unsure whether it was Allied or German. Close to the ground, he “could identify one of [the] good old U.S. Army dark brown square tents” that confirmed that he was on the right side of the front line.\n\nStraﬁng\n\n39\n\nPulling on his shroud lines to avoid trees, he landed in open ground, rolling as he landed. Standing up, he found himself surrounded by GIs and some Italian girls from a nearby village. It turned out he had almost landed in a chow line. He immediately gathered up his chute and joined the GIs in their meal. His Lightning had crashed nearby, and he later went to view the wreck, really only a hole in the ground. His legs were stiff from the landing, but he was otherwise unhurt and returned to the 14th the next day in a small liaison plane.xxvii\n\nLeft: Ground crewman salvage a Lightning of the 37th Fighter Squadron, 1st Fighter Group, that crash-landed on the island of Vis.

Many of these missions were planned for strafing at the outset, rather than as an adjunct to the escort of bombers. The hazards of such missions soon became apparent, as the 52nd Fighter Group discovered on September 3. This mission culminated several days of strafing in Yugoslavia, with each squadron assigned a specific area to rough up. The 2nd Fighter Squadron strafed truck convoys with two flights as the third remained overhead to provide cover. Although they destroyed some trucks and injured or killed a number of German soldiers, the squadron lost two Mustangs on the mission. One, flown by 1st Lt. William Cowan, was flying too low while strafing and crashed into a truck, killing him instantly. Light flak hit another, piloted by Lt. Joseph Randerson, while he was strafing a locomotive. His engine stopped and he crash-landed, wheels up, but got out of the plane badly burned. Serbian farmers cared for him and passed him to Partisan control, and he eventually returned to Italy in November. The mission also included attacks on several small marshalling yards. The Mustangs hit a number of railcars loaded with ammunition at one yard; they blew up, damaging one of the low-flying Mustangs. The 4th Fighter Squadron hit some locomotives and freight cars but didn’t hang around, as light flak was evident, instead carrying on along a highway until they came upon a column of horse-drawn artillery. They fired at the head of column to stop it, killing some horses, but stopped the attack as they couldn’t be sure the troops were German. They continued to roam, strafing more locomotives and trucks, but flak shot down two of their pilots and damaged several more. Flak hit Flying Officer Edward Cobbey’s P-51, and he went directly into the ground and crashed. First Lieutenant Roy Frye, of the same squadron, hit some trees and also crashed. Both men were killed. The Mustangs of the 5th Fighter Squadron strafed rail lines and locomotives, as well as trucks on highways and a radar station, while some stayed overhead to provide cover. They also lost two Mustangs. Second Lieutenant Lloyd Hargrave was hit while strafing a truck but was able to climb several hundred feet and then bail out. Although his parachute did not open completely before he hit the ground, he managed to land safely and reached some farmers in the area. The story of how he evaded is related in a subsequent chapter. Flak also hit the Mustang of Lt. Robert Fulk while he was strafing a locomotive very close to the ground, and he bellied his damaged Mustang into a cornfield. Fulk was injured in the crash-landing, but Chetnik Partisans rescued him and cared for him until he made his way to Belgrade in early November, meeting Randerson there. Both men flew back to Italy, with Fulk returning to the United States and Randerson to flying with the 52nd. Although the price was high—three men killed and three shot down behind enemy lines—the 52nd claimed forty-five locomotives destroyed or badly damaged on this mission, along with almost forty-five railcars and more than sixty trucks.xxviii The famous Red Tails, the 332nd Fighter Group, flew a similar strafing mission the next month, attacking Greek airfields on October 6 during the German withdrawal from Greece. One pilot, Lt. Lincoln Hudson, crashed soon after takeoff near their base at Rametelli, Italy. He survived but was later shot down and taken prisoner in March 1945. The other pilots continued on the mission and ran into the major hazard of ground attacks for fighters: light flak. One Red Tail, Lt. Carroll Woods, was shot down near an airfield he had strafed and was immediately taken prisoner. Another, Lt. Joe Lewis, was last seen by the group with his engine on fire over the Aegean, but he survived to become a prisoner of war. Flak shot down two more, but both pilots managed to evade capture and returned to Italy later in the month.\n\n42\n\nChapter 3\n\nLieutenant Armour McDaniel of the 332nd Fighter Group points out ﬂak damage on the wing of his Mustang to member of his ground crew.\n\nLieutenant Freddie Hutchin’s Mustang was hit in the engine while strafing ground targets at an altitude of only ten feet. His Mustang immediately crashed on a hillside. Several Greek farmers got him out the plane and took him to a farmhouse and later to a town where a resistance headquarters was located. A doctor checked him for injuries and then turned him over to an Allied mission, who placed him in the mayor’s house in a town for a week. He eventually reached Athens, now under British control after the Germans had evacuated the city, by truck on October 19. He flew back to Italy a few days later. Lieutenant Andrew Marshall was also shot down while strafing on October 6. Flak damaged the oil lines in his engine while he strafed an airfield, and he headed for the coast, intending to crashland on a beach. He found the latter much too rocky and ended up crash-landing through some trees, then sliding down a hill on the island of Salamis. Marshall’s Mustang caught fire as he quickly climbed out. He threw his Mae West and parachute into the fire and hightailed it from the wreck. He soon encountered some Greek civilians, who hid him in a field for two days before bringing him to a farmhouse, where he stayed until the Germans evacuated the island on October 13. Greeks then took him to a town in the midst of celebration of the German retreat. From here, he traveled by boat to the town of Megara, where he contacted British paratroopers who had recently occupied the town. American war correspondents were with the paratroopers, and Marshall spent the night with their party, then flew back to Italy the next day.xxix\n\nStraﬁng\n\n43\n\nFifteenth fighter pilots also strafed ground targets as an extracurricular activity during bomber escort missions, after the bombers had bombed their target and turned for home. As the German fighters disappeared from the scene in the fall of 1944, such missions became much more common, as did dedicated strafing missions. Strafing accounted for many of the Fifteenth Air Force fighters lost in the last six months of the war. When the 31st Fighter Group flew a strafing mission to the German airfield at Kurilovec, Yugoslavia, on February 2, 1945, enemy resistance at the field was very heavy, with intense light flak shooting down six of the strafing Mustangs. The strafers did not encounter flak on the first pass, but when they returned again for a second, the Germans were ready. By the fourth and fifth attack passes, although the flak defenses were firing intensely, on target, the Mustangs succeeded in destroying eight enemy aircraft and damaging two more, as well as putting two flak positions out of action.\n\nAbove: The board recording lost and missing aircraft at Fifteenth Air Force headquarters, as it appeared on October 6, 1944.

Harry Carlton, but he managed to fly some distance, to Sisak, Yugoslavia, before crash-landing and walked away from the wreck. Lieutenant Alton Hall’s Mustang suffered hits in its engine, but he also reached the vicinity of Sisak, where he also crash-landed. The only pilot to be killed on the mission was Lt. George Gibson. Flak hit his P-51 over the field, and it turned on its back, on fire, then righted itself before it crashed into the ground. Flak also damaged the engine of Lt. Luther Martin’s Mustang. He pulled up to about 1,500 feet, jettisoned his canopy, and bailed out, reaching the ground safely a few miles from the enemy airdrome and successfully evading enemy troops. Major Frank Wagner, also hit in the engine, managed to climb to 6,000 feet and fly about ten miles until he had to bail out. He fractured his leg on landing and ended up in a Partisan-run hospital. Lieutenant Ralph Lockney was the last to be shot down and also managed to evade capture. All but Major Wagner returned to Italy with the assistance of Yugoslav Partisans by the end of the month.xxx\n\nofficially credited with two enemy aircraft destroyed.\n\nStraﬁng\n\n45\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nBOMBERS AGAINST THE LUFTWAFFE As a strategic air force, the bomber strength of the Fifteenth was the core of its operations. After its creation in November 1943, bomber strength quickly rose to twenty-one groups by the spring of 1944. Their major opponents throughout the campaign against the German war machine were, as for American fighters, the German fighter force and antiaircraft artillery. Both fighters and flak were formidable foes when the Fifteenth began operations, but the former accounted for more bombers lost until the German fighter arm dwindled in the summer of 1944.\n\nOpposite page: A 451st Bomb Group B-24 ﬂies over a smoke-covered Xenia Oil Reﬁnery in Ploesti during the raid of August 10, 1944. The black smoke is from ﬁres started by the bombing, not the German-generated smoke screen.\n\n47\n\nIn late 1943, bombers flew many missions to targets in northern Italy and often encountered German fighters, as occurred on the mission to bomb the marshalling yards at Rimini, Italy, on November 27. Flying Fortress number 42-30705, of the 97th Bomb Group, led the group on this mission and lost an engine to a mechanical problem when approaching the target. The Fortress had to relinquish its lead position in the formation and salvo its bombs. After his return from captivity in June 1945, the copilot, Maj. Marvin Waldroup, recounted the experience.\n\n48\n\nChapter 4\n\nA B-24 from the 513th Bomb Squadron, 376th Bomb Group, ﬂies over the Alps on the way to bomb the Messerschmitt aircraft factory at Augsburg, Germany, on December 19, 1943.\n\nAn intelligence officer points out the current Bomb Line to members of the 450th Bomb Group during a mission brieﬁng in December 1944. Bombers could not drop their bombs beyond the Bomb Line, to prevent hitting American, British, and Soviet troops. It was updated every day.\n\nAs the B-17 dropped behind the formation, Waldroup told the pilot, 1st Lt. Oscar Stedman, to increase power to catch up. They did so with some difficulty. Meeting overcast as they approached the target, the formation turned out to sea, flying in a large circle, to approach Rimini again, hoping to find a hole in the overcast so they could bomb the yards. Flak was conspicuously absent on the second approach to the target, a definite sign German fighters were in the vicinity. On this approach, Waldroup told Stedman “to make a short cut across the circle, in order to catch up with the group. . . . As we approached land, slightly ahead of the more rapidly moving group . . . another B-17 with one engine feathered, was overtaking us from the rear . . .” As their bomber broke out of the overcast, the number three engine lost power as Waldroup saw: . . . about 25 Me 109s German fighter aircraft coming to attack us. I saw no friendly ships near us except . . . [the] other . . . B-17 which was [now] being relentlessly shot up by enemy fighters. . . . The first burst of fighter fire raked our B-17 . . . from the tail to the nose. . . . Soon the number two engine began to blaze and [then] the entire left wing. I told Stedman that we should try to get everyone out. . . . We were having difficulty keeping the ship level. . . . I dropped down between our seats and yelled to Lieutenants Parks [the navigator, Walter Parks] and Shube [the bombardier, George Shube] to jump. Lieutenant Parks seemed to be fastening on his chute. . . . I intended to be the last one to jump . . . as I was senior in rank. The cockpit . . . was all shot all to bits and how any of us escaped alive is a miracle to me. Just as I turned to get into my seat, everything went black . . . apparently . . . [from] the concussion of the ship exploding.\n\nBombers against the Luftwaffe\n\n49\n\nAlthough he was unconscious, the explosion blew open Waldroup’s chute. He was still unconscious when he landed, injured, and Italian police swiftly captured him. During the first attack pass by the German fighters, the only other survivor from the crew— the right waist gunner, Staff Sgt. Joseph Christie—heard the flight engineer, Tech. Sgt. Ray Shupe, shout “Fighters!” over the intercom. He recalled hearing “machine gun shells cracking through the ship” as Me 109s raked the fuselage of the Flying Fortress from tail to nose. The oxygen line to the ball turret caught fire, and the gunner, Staff Sgt. James Melton, got out of his turret. Christie and Shupe both fired at an Me 109 that closed to within a few hundred yards of the Fortress, from four o’clock high. Christie recalled: “It seemed to me as though Shupe had been doing the best shooting,” but both scored hits on the enemy fighter. Immediately, “one of the Me 109s came streaking down from approximately two o’clock and passed my waist window with a terrible streak of smoke pouring from under his wing. I gave him a few bursts as he went by. He was headed for the ground when I last observed him.”\n\n50\n\nChapter 4\n\nArmorers load bombs into the bomb bay of a B-17 before a mission to hit marshalling yards in northern Italy in the spring of 1944.\n\nThe other waist gunner, Staff Sgt. James Sandford, then pointed out the burning numbertwo engine to Christie as the tail gunner ran past them, headed for the radio compartment, and closed the door behind him. Christie noted: “Pieces of shrapnel and fire scattered all through the plane.” Sandford turned to the escape hatch in the floor of the fuselage. He had trouble moving the release latch, but eventually managed to open it, with Christie’s assistance. Christie then returned to his machine gun and “kept firing at two Me 109s that were flying along with us.” As Sandford opened the hatch, “machine gun and cannon fire pierced the ship. On this attack both of us were hit by either machine gun or cannon fire” that wounded Sanford badly in the stomach and Christie in the leg, as well as killing Sergeant Shupe. Christie again recalled: I was also hit in the right leg and knocked to the left side of the ship. . . . I immediately got up and tried to fire at the two fighters that were coming in at approximately 6 o’clock high, but they were far to the right and my gun kept hitting the rear of the window. At this time, pieces of shrapnel and fire raked all through the ship. The ship seemed torn to pieces. It dawned on me that the ship was headed for the ground. . . . I then went back to see if I could do something for Sandford, but it seemed that there was no use. My right leg was bleeding terribly for the blood soaked through my pants, heated suit, and through my coveralls. It seemed as though I couldn’t stand anymore and I remember it seemed as though everything was red to me. At this time, I was looking out of the hatch. The next thing I remembered I was falling with my feet down toward the earth. I had a difficult time pulling my rip cord, but somehow I managed to pull it out. I remember the flutter of the chute. He noticed another chute on the way down: Major Waldroup. After Christie reached the ground, he put a tourniquet on his leg. Some Italian farmers found him and carried him to a farmhouse, where he received some rudimentary first aid. Then an Italian soldier soon took him prisoner. While he was being carried down a mountain, an Englishspeaking Italian girl told Christie that another crewman was unconscious nearby. His party went to the location and found Waldroup unconscious. The two were taken to an Italian civilian hospital and later a German military hospital, where Waldroup regained consciousness after five days. Both men were later transported to the Luftwaffe interrogation facility at Frankfurt am Main, then to different prisoner-of-war camps. Although the pilot of another Fortress had seen three chutes open just before the bomber exploded, they were the only two members of the crew to survive.xxxi The effectiveness of fighter attacks such as those against Flying Fortress number 42-30705 began to diminish on missions over northern Italy following several Fifteenth Air Force attacks on airfields in northern Italy at the end of January 1944. These raids depleted the Luftwaffe fighter force opposing American bombers to the extent that many of the German fighters facing Fifteenth bomber formations from this point on came from bases in Austria and Germany. Although most of the Luftwaffe’s fighter strength was based in Germany facing the American Eighth Air Force and the Royal Air Force’s Bomber Command, Fifteenth Air Force raids to southern Germany and Austria could, and did, continue to draw fierce fighter opposition through the summer of 1944, as did raids against the heavily defended oil refineries at Ploesti, Romania.\n\nBombers against the Luftwaffe\n\n51\n\nLuftwaffe pilots flew most of the enemy aircraft encountered in the air battles of 1944, joined by pilots of Germany’s Axis partners: Italy, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. The Me 109 was the most common fighter encountered (some flown by Hungarian and Romanian pilots), followed by Fw 190s; twinengine Me 110s, 210s, and 410s; and some Italian models. American pilots often misidentified Romanian IAR 80s in the confusion of combat because of their similar appearance to the Fw 190. Besides cannon and machine guns, these fighters also used rockets against bomber formations, launched beyond the range of the defensive fire of bombers, as well as aerial bombs hung from cables. German fighters concentrated on attacking the bombers until the spring of 1944, but just as long-range fighters joined the Fifteenth in April 1944, German fighter pilots were officially permitted to attack the fighter escort, as mentioned earlier. Attacks by waves of German fighters could extend the duration of attacks for a half hour or longer. But bombers straggling from group formations became their target of choice once American fighters gained air superiority in the spring of 1944. Although Luftwaffe fighter opposition to the Fifteenth waned at the end of the summer, for many months leading up to that time they presented a mortal threat to Fifteenth bomber crews. A month after the loss of Fortress number 42-30705, a Liberator crew from the 376th Bomb Group became another victim of German fighters. During the December 28 raid on Vincenza, Italy, Luftwaffe fighters shot down B-24 42-72088, piloted by 2nd Lt. Harlan Wenzinger, about forty miles from the target. During the approach to the target, over the Adriatic Sea, the 376th formation of seventeen aircraft missed the rendezvous with the other group on the mission and the fighter escort. The other group, the 98th Bomb Group, with the fighter escort, had returned to base after weather reconnaissance reported that all potential targets were covered by clouds. The 376th missed the recall, however, and continued on to the briefed target. As the bombers approached it, a waist gunner, Staff Sgt. Donald Carlton, moved to the nose turret, and the flight engineer, Tech. Sgt. Bruce Dunkin, moved to man his waist gun, in expectation of an enemy fighter attack. After the 376th crossed the coast, climbing to bombing altitude, more than one hundred German fighters attacked them from out of the sun. Sergeant Herbert Esaw, a gunner in another squadron continued on page 56\n\n52\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Flying Fortress hit by ﬂak over Ploesti during the attack of July 9, 1944.\n\nPorto San Stefano, Italy, is smothered by bombs during the attack of May 12, 1944.

Then they came in from every direction. The two wing men in B element were [the] first to go down. Then the leader . . . went down as they were making for our formation [for cover against the attackers], the other two [Liberators] each had two engines smoking and went down about 1,500 to 2,000 yards before they got to us. During this time I saw six fighters go down and chutes opening in every direction from the B-24s. . . . One B-24 blew up before it hit the ground and the others all went into spins.” The attack set Wenzinger’s Liberator on fire above the bomb bay and the waist. Cannon shells also blew the tail turret out of the aircraft, killing the gunner. A crewman in an aircraft alongside saw the propeller from an engine fly off and landing gear fall out. The second fighter pass set the oxygen system on fire, destroyed the intercom, and started a fire in the waist of the Liberator. The radio operator, Tech. Sgt. Robert Hagen, later recalled that as the disabled aircraft left the formation, Lieutenant Wenzinger “gave the order to abandon ship as our controls were gone, one engine out, tail turret blown out of the ship, and we were afire from the bomb bay back [to the tail of the Liberator].” Fighters wounded Technical Sergeant Dunkin on the first fighter pass, and he jumped from his window; the right waist gunner, Frederick Ehman, bailed out from the waist, too. Staff Sergeant Carlton was unable to get out of the nose turret as the aircraft began to plunge toward the ground. The copilot was last seen preparing to jump but never got out of the bomber and was killed in the crash. The pilot, bombardier, navigator, ball-turret gunner, and radio operator managed to bail out, but the navigator was strangled by his shroud lines during the descent. The Liberator descended in a slow spin until it crashed. Four crew members were killed in all: the copilot, navigator, tail gunner, and assistant radio operator. The remainder became prisoners of war. During the disastrous mission, ten bombers from the 376th were lost, including all that had been put up from the 512th Bomb Squadron.xxxii German fighters continued the pressure on Fifteenth Air Force bombers into the new year, as bombing raids spread to Luftwaffe airfields in southern France to keep Luftwaffe bombers from attacking the Anzio beachhead. Immediately afterward, in late February, the Fifteenth returned to bombing German aircraft factories in southern Germany. As expected, German\n\n56\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe gunners of a 765th Bomb Squadron, 461st Bomb Group Liberator who claimed fourteen German ﬁghters shot down or damaged during the attack on the Herman Goering Tank Factory in Linz, Austria, on July 25, 1944.\n\nAn Me 109 goes down in ﬂames to gunners of a Liberator over Austria in July 1944.\n\nfighters came out in strength to oppose the raids that took place during Big Week, the series of raids flown by the Fifteenth and the Eighth Air Forces and Royal Air Force Bomber Command from England. The raids were intended to destroy a large portion of German fighter production and force Luftwaffe fighters up to defend these factories, so they could be shot down. The Fifteenth’s first mission during Big Week was to bomb aircraft factories at Regensburg on February 22. On the run up to the target, about fifteen minutes before bombs away, flak and fighters assaulted the formation. Eight Me 110s attacked a Liberator named Butch, part of the 98th Bomb Group. Four attacked the left side of the aircraft, and the left waist gunner, Staff Sgt. John Goldbach, exclaimed over the intercom: “Let ’em have it!” These attacks damaged the ball turret, and the radio operator tried to raise the turret and open the door to allow the gunner inside, Staff Sgt. Harold Carter, to get out, but did not succeed. He returned to his radio room to hitch up his intercom and tell the pilot the situation when the aircraft suddenly exploded. Crewmen in other Liberators alongside saw the explosion, possibly caused by a rocket. Butch immediately fell out of the formation, nose down, in a steady dive with the engines on the right wing on fire and gasoline leaking from the bomb bay tanks. When the B-24 exploded, Technical Sergeant Foury, the radio operator, lost consciousness, coming to at five thousand feet with his parachute fortuitously blown open by the explosion. The remainder of the crew went down with the ship and were killed. Foury was taken prisoner, the only survivor of his doomed aircraft. The next day, February 23, a reconnaissance F-5 Lightning of the 15th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron, flown by 1st Lt. John Brennan, took off to photograph the damage inflicted by the raid. As was typical of such reconnaissance missions, he flew a circuit of targets in southern Germany and Austria, including marshalling yards and airfields at Wessling and Munich, Germany, and Innsbruck, Austria. At some point on the mission, which was his twenty-eighth combat reconnaissance mission, Brennan was shot down, probably near Munich. Admitted to a German military hospital with serious injuries on the same day, he unfortunately died of his wounds on March 14. His Lightning and Butch were but two of forty-two lost by the Fifteenth Air Force on these two days.xxxiii On the final mission of Big Week, on February 25, the 301st Bomb Group was one of the groups that bombed the Prufening Me 109 factory in Regensburg. Although the Eighth Air Force also bombed the plant, the German fighter controller picked out the Fifteenth’s formation as the target for German fighters. Of the 200 involved in the attack, the 301st reported ttacks by up to 150 fighters, with groups of 20 attacking each squadron while the bombers were still over Austria. They closed to within one hundred yards of the bombers during the ferocious combat; some even dropped aerial bombs on the formation. An aircraft resembling a B-24 was thought to have fired a large-caliber cannon at the formation, too, but this was probably a rocket attack from a two-engine fighter fired from near one of the Liberators on the mission.\n\nBombers against the Luftwaffe\n\n57\n\nOne of the fourteen Fortresses lost by the 301st on the mission was number 42-30095, piloted by 2nd Lt. Robert Snyder. After the crew had seen four other B-17s shot down in a matter of minutes, including two in their own formation, about fifty fighters attacked their Fortress, from around the clock, all firing at the same time. Snyder later reported: “Our number three engine ran away and we could not feather the propeller. . . . Then our oxygen system was knocked out. There seemed to be an explosion in the aircraft. It must have been a 20mm [round]. At the same time our number three engine caught on fire.” The oxygen system was vital to the crew’s survival at their altitude of more than twenty thousand feet, as well as the intercom, so Snyder put the Fortress into a dive to reach an altitude where oxygen was not needed. The fighters continued their\n\n58\n\nChapter 4\n\nAn Me 410 turns away from a Flying Fortress during a mission to Brux, Czechoslovakia, in June 1944.\n\nA B-24 of the 449th Bomb Group leaves towering clouds of smoke behind it during a raid on the oil reﬁneries at Ploesti, Romania, in the spring of 1944.\n\n60\n\nChapter 4\n\nOpposite page: A view of the damage inﬂicted on the Romano Americano Oil Reﬁnery by the Fifteenth Air Force during the raids from May through August 1944.

This single fighter continued to follow the B-17 as it descended several more thousand feet, making one pass without firing. Evidently, the German pilot decided the bomber was doomed, as he too soon climbed away for more lucrative prey above. Snyder continued: “The engineer said he saw the rest of the crew bailing out of the waist and the tail on the way down. . . . At about 15,000 feet, the bombardier bailed out. I tried to motion to him . . . but he left before I could make him understand the aircraft was still okay.” Besides the bombardier, the radio operator and the ball-turret, waist, and tail gunners all bailed out as well, leaving only Snyder, the copilot, and the flight engineer to man the ship. The three managed to fly their badly damaged aircraft back to Italy, where they landed safely. We will meet several other crews who did the same in a later chapter. All the crewmen who bailed out were taken prisoner and liberated at the end of the war.xxxiv Without fighter escorts, who lacked the range to protect them over Austrian and German targets at this time, the bombers of the Fifteenth returned to Italian targets in March, in part to conserve strength after the high losses in late February. On March 18, many Luftwaffe fighters attacked the bombers during raids on Luftwaffe airfields in northeast Italy, including the airfield at Villorba, after reconnaissance spotted a new buildup of enemy fighters.\n\nBombers against the Luftwaffe\n\n61\n\nA 5th Bomb Wing Flying Fortress drops its bombs over the reﬁnery at Moosbierbaum, Austria, during the raid of August 28, 1944.\n\nAs the formation of Fortresses approached Villorba on the bomb run, one of the B-17s from the 99th Bomb Group was devastated during a fighter attack. The attacks, by Fw 190s and twin-engine Me 110s and Me 410s, lasted an hour. The Germans fired rockets from outside the range of the Fortresses’ .50-caliber machine guns. The aim was good, as they hit four B-17s with rockets, downing all four. None of the American bombers initially fired at the fighters, as they were unsure of their identity, since the attack occurred at the time the Thunderbolt escort was to rendezvous with the bombers and the German aircraft had markings similar to some American fighters.\n\n62\n\nChapter 4\n\nOne of the bombers hit in the attack was number 41-22611 of the 99th, flown by the crew of 2nd Lt. Gerald Lombard. Four fighters attacked the ship from five o’clock, closing to within 150 yards before they fired their rockets. The rocket attack blew off the vertical and one horizontal stabilizer. The tail gunner was blown out of the Fortress by the explosion, passing over the wing of a plane flying behind the formation with his parachute streaming behind him. It did not open, and he was killed, most likely by the explosion that threw him from the plane. The waist gunner on 41-22611 reported to Lombard that the floor of fuselage up to the waist windows was destroyed. The tail began to smoke heavily, and after staying with the formation for a short time, the bomber turned away, losing altitude. A crewman on another plane reported the shootdown: “Four Me 109s . . . got within approximately 150 yards of [Lombard’s Fortress]. . . . Still maintaining their formation, the first two Messerschmitts raised their noses slightly and fired. The other two fired a split second afterwards. The left horizontal stabilizer was shot off the B-17, which pulled up into a steep climb, rolled off on the left wing, and began to spin to the left. About halfway to the ground, the entire tail section separated and the ship’s spin flattened out. . . . The Messerschmitts peeled off to the right, in formation, and disappeared in the haze.” As the aircraft flattened out, crewmen began to bail out through the bomb bay. As would be expected, Lombard was the last to leave, and all those who bailed out landed safely. All but one were captured—the waist gunner, Sgt. Raymond King, evaded capture and eventually reached Yugoslavia five months later.xxxv Also over Yugoslavia, a 454th Bomb Group Liberator crew discovered that bombers that straggled from the protection of the combined firepower of their group formation became easy game for roaming German fighters. Liberator number 41-29436, flown by 1st Lt. LeRoy Beck, lost some power in its engines on the approach to Bucharest on the May 7 mission but managed to stay with the group’s formation and bomb the target. Then flak hit two engines, and the bomber began to straggle from the formation, losing altitude. The crew jettisoned equipment to lighten the ship, including the waist guns, flak suits, ammunition, and even the radio, but over Yugoslavia, on the way home, two Me 109s ambushed the bombers. The attack was devastating, wounding six of the crew and badly damaging the B-24. The waist gunner and ball-turret gunner were either severely wounded or killed in the attack. The flight engineer, Tech. Sgt. Harry Boyer, and bombardier, 2nd Lt. Thomas Muirhead, both then behind the cockpit, were wounded. The tail gunner, Staff Sgt. Samuel Grieco, managed to return fire with the only machine gun still operating in the rear of the aircraft but was also wounded, as was the radio operator, Staff Sgt. William West. With two crewmen dead or dying and four more wounded, the Liberator’s bomb-bay fuel tanks began to burn. Beck gave the bailout order, and six of the crew managed to do so before the B-24 went into a spin and exploded. The nose-turret gunner, Sgt. John Warnock, last seen getting out of his turret, was found in the wreckage along with Lieutenant Beck, who had valiantly stayed to keep the doomed aircraft under control so the others could get out. Of the six crewmen who did manage to bail out, the copilot was found dead with his hand on the ripcord handle; he had apparently jumped too late to open his chute. The parachute of Sergeant Boyer was riddled with bullet holes and only partially opened. He too was killed.\n\nBombers against the Luftwaffe\n\n63\n\nSergeant West made it to the ground but was taken prisoner. Sergeant Grieco, Lieutenant Muirhead, and their navigator 2nd Lt.
