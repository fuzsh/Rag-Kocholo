        "text": "It was a dreadful situation to be in. One bomb completely fell through the bomb bays forcing them wide open, and the other three bombs were hanging by one and on the shackle with the fins dangling down into space. Huffhines and myself kicked the other three bombs out and I went up in the nose to close the doors. When my handle refused to close the doors, Captain Larkin informed me that our hydraulic system was out, so Huffhines and myself got busy with the crank to pull the doors up mechanically. At the same time Larkin was trying to get the landing gear down. Lt. Stoltzman climbed to the rear of the ship and started letting the wheels down mechanically, and just as they were about to get into the lock position a distinct “snap” was heard, the wheels fell limp, and Stoltzman said “if they’re not down now they’re not going down.”\n\nIt was just a matter of time until we heard those fatal words over the radio, “Pickard to Larkin, Pickard to Larkin, you will bail your crew out.” To make sure I wasn’t hearing false statements, I waited until Larkin repeated this message to me. By this time the four of us, Aldrich, Huffhines, Pappano and myself were in the Navigators compartment and I relayed the message to them.\n\nThere was a sudden mad rush for parachutes. It was indeed a scramble; and after knocking a couple of heads together and a left hook to the jaw I ended up victorious with four parachutes, but two of the fellows had none. After thinking the situation over and out of the kindness of my heart I finally decided each of those two boys a chute. That left me with only two, a seat pack and a chest pack, which I put on snugly. I began to feel rather guilty for the rough treatment I had handed the boys and suddenly burst out with “OK I, fellows, I’ll go first.” When I said that I noticed a peculiar gleam in every one of those boys’ eyes and a single word written on all their faces: “Revenge!!! I said to myself, “My God, what did I just say?” It was too late then—all that was left for me to do was wait and get the word from Capt. Joe to jump and take the consequences. Huffhines kicked the hatch off and there, 10,000 feet below me was the ground. “How high are we, Joe?” “Two Thousand Feet.” “Oh!” That was the longest two thousand feet I ever saw. I had a few short parting words with Joe and then he comes out with those sharp words: “OK, Jump.” I looked at the ground again and slowly sat down on the floor, with my feet dangling out. “We must be at least 15,000 feet” I said to myself. Then I dropped my hips out and hung on to the plane with my elbows. I hung that way half a minute, just resting. At this point the other boys knew that their moment had come! So like clockwork two of them had kicked my elbows loose and the other had his foot on my head pushing me out. “Ok Ok, quit shoving,” I yelled, but it did no good. I managed to hold on with my fingers, with the rest of my body flopping against the outside of the fuselage, but the payoff came when those boys stepped on my fingers. I was knocked loose.\n\nAfter three back flips, two jack knives, and a couple of barrel rolls I figured it was time to pull the cord. I gave a mighty jerk and out popped the little chute, catching me on the lip, followed by the big one. After falling ten thousand of those twelve thousand feet (It looked like I had!) the chute opened with a thud which made me think I had already hit the ground.\n\nThen things started running smoothly and I started my slow descend [sic] to the ground. I looked around orienting myself and actually gave out with about half of the song, “Doodle De Doo.” I noticed all the people on the hillside above my Quonset watching all the excitement, and I said to myself “Why!! Those Blood Thirsty B-------s, just waiting to see somebody get hurt.” I fooled them though, and came down like, what I thought, a veteran jumper would except I had two chutes and I kept one hand firmly on the ripcord of the unopened one and the other hand still grasping the other ripcord.\n\nEverything was silent and peaceful until those three P-40’s spotted me and came over to give me a buzz. I shook my fist at them and actually believe that if I had had my .45 with me, I would have taken a shot at them. Their prop wash caught me full blast and started me swinging like a circus clown on a long rope. I thought the chute was going to collapse and was all set to drop out of it and use my other one when I realized I was too close to the ground [illegible] it settled down again but instead of landing on the runway like I would have, the prop wash caused myself to hit right in the middle of that ten foot wide muddy artificial creek in which I went in up to my shoulders.\n\nI wasn’t mad though. I gathered my chute, gave it a big kiss, and then kissed that terra firma on which I was so solidly on again.\n\nThat night I began wondering who jumped next then next, and then last, so this is the only way I see it could have happened. Aldrich was the next one out. He was the smallest of the three boys left so the two bigger boys chose him. After he had put up a game fight, still in that navigator’s compartment, with a few unhealthy blows dished out and many foul punches below the belt the other two boys finally overpowered him and he came sailing out as I had previously done. They tell me Pappano, the boy who went up with us just for the ride, was the third man out. Why he was next still puzzles me because he is larger than Huffhines. The only way I can figure it is that he was looking down through the hatch to see if Aldrich’s chute opened and Huffhines struck him with a terrific blow on the back of the head with the Bomb Bay Crank and tramped him through the hatch with his feet.\n\nThen came the big problem. Did Huffhines jump of his own free will??? Did he trip and fall out??? That, my friends is the $64.00 question!!!! The only thing I know is that I saw the plane fly a very crooked and unsteady course for about five minutes before I saw him come tumbling out, so it stands to reason that this is what happened: Larkin gave him the command, “Jump!!!” Huffhines refused. Again Larkin demanded “Jump!!!!” Huffhines still refuses. So Joe climbs a few thousand feet, turns the airplane loose, and lets it fly on its own, and he and Stoltzman get back into the navigator’s compartment with Huffhines and challenges him. Huffhines, weak and tired from the three previous battles was not hard to remove. A couple of good hard licks on the chin and one behind the ear was all that was necessary to bail him out.\n\nThat left the Pilot and Co-Pilot in the plane with the choice of either jumping or landing it. Joe elects to land it; not because he is afraid to jump, but because there might be a chance to save the ship. The landing was beautiful considering the circumstances and the plane will fly again.\n\nI loaded the parachute on Finney’s B-18 to be taken back for repacking. On the Packing Data Card I wrote a little note, “It opened nicely, thanks –Lt. Back.”\n\nOn September 11, 1943, I went on Temple’s crew as Navigator on the deck level raid on Paramushiru Straits. Twelve planes took off one of which later turned back because of mechanical trouble.\n\nWe sighted Kamchatka about 30 miles south of Petropavlovsk. After flying parallel to the coast for a short while we parted company with the B-24’s who proceeded south while we turned west. We flew into the Sea of Okhotsk until we were lined up with the Strait and then turned due south.\n\nWe were now flying on the water and the roar of the engines made any kind of conversation almost impossible.\n\nWe were now a flight leader since Major Hudelson had turned back. Our five planes were to fly along the south shore of the Strait about 30 seconds after the other flight went by the north shore.\n\nThe coast line of Shimushu and Paramushiru were now visible as was a column of smoke caused by the B-24’s who had gone through a few minutes before. I was riding in the nose of our plane, which had five (5) fixed guns and to be sure that all guns fired they were continuously charged. I also had with me my own camera. We were now within range of their larger guns and black umbrellas were appearing in ever increasing numbers. Any hope we might have had of pulling a surprise attack were soon gone. The water seemed full of small craft all of which seemed determined of shooting down our particular plane. We were now in the Strait and all semblance of a formation was gone. Temple was now putting the plane through violent evasive action altho[sic] it seemed impossible to escape being hit—I heard some one[sic] shout over the inter phone to look left and glancing that way beheld a black cloud; all that was left of one B-25. To our right in a little bay (Kashiwabara Wan) we saw 3 large cargo ships. Temple picked out the biggest, made 3 direct hits and as we skidded around a mountain we saw it belch out fire and smoke. As we emerged from the Strait, two cruisers lying at anchor ahead and to the right of us opened fire. All this time I had been busy keeping the guns going and snapping pictures and damning myself for ever insisting on coming on this particular mission. We were indicating about 260 m.p.h. but even so we were the last plane out of the Strait. The last plane to pass us was Berecz who went by us on one engine leaving a trail of smoke. He crashed a few minutes later exploding upon contact with the water.\n\nThere were only 3 planes in sight and our defensive formation was conspicuous by its absence.\n\nA Zeke made a diving pass at us from 10 o’clock passing within a hundred feet of our plane. I could see his tracers chopping the water coming closer to our plane but just when it appeared that we would pass through his fire he ceased firing. Temple tried to get on his tail as the Zeke pulled away but before we could turn over 30 degrees, the damned Jap was on our tail hammering away. About two more passes were made at us but they did not approach too close, and they soon dropped behind. It was now 1430W—we had been under fire for a total of about 20 minutes altho[sic] it seemed like a lifetime.\n\nChecking on our remaining gas we found that we had 435 gallons remaining. We also had a 25MPH tail wind so we decided to try and make our base. Two other planes were on our wing but they both turned towards the alternate base. We turned towards home 4 hours away with 4.5 hours gas available. Everything moveable was jettisoned including the parachutes in order to make the plane lighter. We kept our eyes glued on the white caps for with any wind shift we knew we would be unable to get back. Half way back we intercepted 3 B-24’s who were 25 degrees off course so they followed us in. To top matters off, the weather turned bad. The first land sighted was Murder Point and what a relieve it was for by now the visibility had dropped to less than 2 miles. We landed at 1820 over ten hours after we took off. A few minutes later 3 more planes came in making a total of 4 who returned out of the 11 which started through the Straits. On our side of the ledger we chalked up 3 cargo ships sunk and several smaller craft damaged. A fitting climax was that the roll of film I had exposed was ruined by the person developing it so that I didn’t get a single picture of the raid.\n\nI don’t believe that there were ever any two enlisted men in the Seventy Seven who sweated more than Mac and myself during that deck level run through the Straights of Paramushiru on September 11, 1943. “Sweating” is a term that one hears all the time in the Air Force but we never knew the full meaning of that word until we went through that ungodly hail of fire. Mac (Lofton D. McDougald) was the top turret gunner and I (Larry A. Moore) was the radio operator, on our Mitchell which carried the name of “Little Dudette,” lucky for us she “dood it” alright.\n\nWe were on the alert the whole way over with Mac and myself taking turns riding the turret. Our seats were pretty sore by the time we got there for that bicycle contraption on a Bendix turret isn’t the most comfortable place in the world. The weather was socked in most of the way over and although we sifted that fog with our eyes we didn’t see a ----thing—our eyes were to have their fill a little later. For about two hours on the way over we had to work on the guns to get them in firing shape—at the last minute we were forced to change planes and the guns in this one weren’t in any too good shape. Well, we cussed like the devil about this for we had never heard of a Zero who had been shot down by a gun that wouldn’t fire. However, thanks to Mac they were finally put into shape where they would fire smoothly by the time we got there.\n\nThe ships began to jockey into formation, lining up wing to wing so Mac and I knew that the time had come. As we came roaring down the top of the water, black gardenias began to burst around us. We were now on top of the water and our nose guns were strafing the small fishing boats at the mouth of the Straits. Even those little -------- had machine-guns firing at us so we knew darned well that this was going to get rough when we got in a little further. It was a game of keeps and we sure weren’t playing with marbles. Mac and I both found out later that our last sensible thoughts before we entered that inferno were of our wives.\n\nThen we were in the straits which was full of ships. Mac had that turret spinning around like a top and there I sat with only a sub machine gun in my hands. All hell suddenly broke loose. Those ships of the rising sun and the shore batteries threw a hail of fire that we didn’t even think a bird could get through. Mac and I felt like elephants riding through there on a kittycar. One of the planes off our right wing suddenly blew up in midair but he got his ship which blew sky high. The whole harbor was on fire and the tracers were cutting zippers in the water directly below our plane—up just a little higher and –well, we’d rather forget about that. In that upper turret with that plexi-glass dome it appeared to Mac as though every tracer was coming directly at him and he was really grabbing for that seat as we bounced up and down with evasive action. After we got back Mac discovered that the seat of his pants was full of holes. He was still for just about a second and I was afraid that they had got him when that old turret began to revolve again and I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nI was about to go nuts having all those -------- firing at me and not being able to throw anything back so I took the sub and started back towards the rear where I could be able to fire through the windows out both sides. Mac had the turret swung around to such a position (thank God for that) that I couldn’t get passed him so I stuck the gun out the window right at my side trying to get a shot at something. If I would have been able to get to the rear, I would have caught a twenty millimeter right through my head. Our plane was really catching flak now and Mac and I could feel each hit upon it as though it were a stab in the heart. How could anything get through a wall of fire like that we still don’t know. We got our ship—Mac saw it blow up as we passed over it. We were now about passed all the shipping; pulling out of range of the shore batteries when Mac and I began to believe that the miracle might happen when the devil itself loomed up off our right side in the form of a Jap Cruiser. Our bombs were all gone so all we had to do was get past him—yeah, that’s all! That dirty ------- made Mac and me so sick as we saw him blinking at us from stem to stern—that Jap cruiser had more guns than a dog has fleas. Somehow we got past that mess and as we came to the end of the straits we were greeted by about fifteen Zeros at two o’clock. Mac thought his big opportunity was at hand for we had often said back in the states that it was our big ambition to get a Zero or two. However, we were still on the deck and a pretty tough target and here’s where we found out that they weren’t the “do or die” fighters as we had always supposed them to be. Only one ship came within reach of Mac’s guns and after the nose guns and Mac’s upper turret put a burst into him he took off like a turpentined dog. I saw about five Rufes off at fifteen hundred yards and let them have a burst of my wicked sub machine gun—all I can say is that I have shot “at” a Jap plane. We pulled away from them and Mac and I knew pretty well for sure that this time the fireworks were over but there was one more sickening sight which we were yet to see. Another Mitchell off our right wing had an engine on fire and began turning into us. He was making for Russia so we pulled up as he went under. Mac and I were praying for those boys for we had a lot of buddies in those other planes with whom we had been with back in the states. The ship was losing altitude and it was evident that he would have to make a water landing before he reached the coast. With frozen thoughts we watched as he eased the ship into that icy water. He slid along for a few seconds and then exploded—we looked at each other without words. As we took our course to return to Attu, Mac and I felt as though there wasn’t a thing in the world that could bother us. Although we felt pretty sure our gas would run out and we would have to make a water landing, we took that as a joke after sweating our way through that hell. We made it okay, however, with very little gas left and later that night, we gazed with drunken eyes upon those seven empty revetments.\n\nA narrative of our attack on the Straits of Paramushiru should start at the conclusion of our uneventful flight [sic] over. The first indication that we had that we were approaching the target was the increase in speed, as we let down on to the water, we throttled forward to forty (40) inches and needled the RPM up to 2400. [illegible] defensive formation formed a line of planes for our push on the [illegible]ping and the planes jumped ahead in a surge of power like horses in the final stretch.\n\nAfter what seemed an eternity, Lt. Claude Wilson pointed through haze and brought our attention to a couple of ships on our right. We didn’t vary our course, however, we were after bigger game. Lt. Wallace Wickham unlimbered his camera and gave a nod to Claude. Lt. George Amaon, the bombardier-navigator, was on or rather in the nose taking care of the nose gun and gave us a reassuring call of readiness. We were all set.\n\nSuddenly we popped out of the haze and for a fraction of a second stood still. Surprise? Hell no. The little -------- were waiting for us. Sunday morning too, and not a darn Jap in church.\n\nClaude looked at the black wall in front of him and “Lil Dudette,” our plane, started finding holes. How we got through even the first wall of that hellish barrage we’ll never know. The Straight was alive with ships of all sizes, little ones, big ones, war ships, merchant ships, and a myriad of auxiliaries, everyone from tiny craft to 10,000 toners throwing up a constant stream of lead. We were being thrown around like a chip in a storm. Holes began to appear miraculously all over the plane. “Termites,” screamed Claude over the roar. Wick grinned and went on frantically firing his camera. Our flexible nose gun was chattering so we knew George was on the job. Claude started looking for a target. By God if we were going to go through that inferno we were going to get a big one. Looking everywhere at once we saw Mort Staniford’s ship disappear in a buff of smoke. No time for sentiment, it wasn’t till later that we remembered to say “tough” in tribute to Mort, and happy go lucky “Big Tom Merrill,” the squadron humorist—well, Tom always said he “didn’t come out here to start to college.”\n\nSeconds later a big merchant man loomed in front of us—our baby. Claude toggled a couple of 500’s right in the side of the big black ------, and we knew he was a cooked goose—(Mac, our gunner, saw him blow sky high).\n\nWe hopped over the ship and popped back on the water. It seemed as though we had been in the same place a lifetime, they were throwing everything at us—even the big coastal guns were laying stuff in front of us, chucking towering water spouts, hoping we would crash into them.\n\nClaude kicked it off to the right, and there in front of us—hot dog—was another big one. We started after him strafing as we went—came the dawn—it was an enemy cruiser, which turned red all over, and the whole plane shuddered in every bolt. That was the time we were wishing the Baker dash two five had a reverse gear. It was too late though, we had committed ourself and had to complete our run.\n\nSlugs crashed through our nose shattering the plexi-glass, and the whole front of the plane seemed to disintegrate. Lead was popping all over the cock-pit. Wally caught a slug in his left boot numbing the leg up to the knee as though he’d had the pin shot off. Afraid to look he felt down as far as his ankle—found it all there—reassured he grabbed his camera trigger again and then stopped.\n\nLooking at him, Wilson knew the same thought had struck him. Our nose gun that had been firing since we entered the straight was silent—poor George. Looking over our shoulder we saw his helmet roll back through the crawlway, we thought it to be the omen of the tragic conclusion of a boy’s Army career.\n\nThe two in the cock-pit looked at each other, and Wally slid his seat back to see if there was anything he could do for the young bombardier. Bingo, out of the tunnel comes George, not only alive but very active.\n\n“Let’s get out of here,” he bellowed, “they just shot the devil out of the nose,” Wilson grinned and pointed to the air speed, wavering near the 300 mark, “Bub, we ain’t parked,” said Wilson, and George returned to the nose and his guns were spouting again.\n\nFrom there on out it was gravy. Sure, we had fifteen or twenty Zeros on us, and incidentally we sent a Nate smoking to the earth. We had a rough touch sweating our gas and landing in zero-zero stuff with fifteen minutes lee-way, but as I say that was gravy—after the hell of Paramushiru Straight, anything would be."
