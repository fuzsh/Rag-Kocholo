        "text": "DIARY OF WORLD WAR II 1940-1945\n\nDecember 24, 1940\n\nI was to report to Gate City VA for going into the Army. I had just finished high school that year. In Gate City I met with others going into service and our Recruiters put us on a bus to Bristol, Va. In Bristol we went through a physical. Since we had to wait for the train they let us go to a movie. When the train came it was to take us to Norfolk, Va., when we were to spend the night at the Ponce De Leon Hotel. I was sworn into the Army early the next morning.\n\nDecember 25, 1940 1:30 A. M.\n\nI started by train to Maxwell Field in Montgomery, Alabama. We arrived at 12:00 noon in time for lunch. Imagine how surprised I was to see Ezra Bishop from Natural Tunnel, VA., and Robert Soward from East Stone Gap, Va., serving on the line. Ezra was carving the turkey and Robert was in charge of the potatoes. I was later put in \"Tent City One\" with Osborne from Washington State and Roberts from Wallen's Ridge, and Dick form Gate City, Va. We didn't do much, I think we were lost for a few days.\n\nJanuary 3, 1941\n\nI moved to \"Tent City Four\" and did KP duty, hiking, target practice, etc.\n\nTent Mates at Maxwell Field: Al Sorbo, Arian Heller, Glenn Weebly, Rudolf Schnupa, Edward Bosak, Clarence PA also 2960 Liddesdale Street Detroit, Mich  Albert Kuhne Jr 407 Hayrest Street, Johnston PA  O.H.C. Miller 619 6th Street Arkadelphia AR  Ai S Bloom, Route 1 Curvensville,\n\nTent Mates in Italy Parachute School: Kaylor, Hoagland, Novak, Pental, Pinioli (later known as Joe August), Speers  517 Parachute Infantry Regiment  APO 109.\n\nFebruary 2, 1941\n\nI moved to \"Old Mill\" on outskirts of Montgomery.\n\nMarch 5, 1941\n\nLeft Alabama.\n\nMarch 6, 1941\n\nWe arrived at Jefferson Barracks, St Louis, Mo. Again I was put in \"Tent City One\", tent 21 with Al Bloom, John Campbell, C D Huggler, Stuart Schappick and John Halblem I pulled KP, cut wood, guard duty, helped unload RR cars and other miscellaneous jobs. It was so cold here that I slept in my long handles and clothes I wore. I had a comforter, two blankets and an overcoat I spread on top of that. Our stove didn't help much. It was a little conical stove with a four inch pipe. We were burning slack coal and the pipe stopped up very often. When we first got settled, one of the boys from another tent told us how to clean the pipes. He said, \"Open the door and throw some water on the coals.\" Not knowing better, one boy picked up the bucket of water and threw it in the stove. Our stove went about a foot in the air and ashes went everywhere. Wood burned very good, but we couldn't get much wood. There was a forest close by and we would go on detail to cut wood. When we were on guard duty, our main job was to watch the tents and if the smoke started out the door or roof we had to go in wake the boys and get them out. On KP one shift, I went to work at 1:00 AM and worked eight hours. On another time I helped the man who made the pies, he wanted me to stay with him because I kept eh pots and pans clean.\n\nApril 19, 1941\n\nI left for Chicago, Il., for airplane mechanics school at Aeronautical University , 1338 Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL. We stayed at the YMCA.\n\nApril 21, 1941\n\nAeronautical University was about two blocks from our hotel. Each day, after classes were over, we went to O'Hara Airport for practice on planes. To start with the pales were old, they had what was called inertia starters you cranked a starter till it got up to good speed then you told the boy in the cockpit to pull the button.\n\nJune 25, 1941\n\nWe were paid $25.00 a month and after six months we were to be paid $30.00 a month. I had now been in the Army 6 months without being paid is a long time.\n\nJuly 4, 1941\n\nOn July 2, I left Chicago at 11:00 AM, going home but didn't arrive until July 4. The reason it took so long, the station master routed me the long way instead of the short way. He sent me though West Virginia when I could have come to Nashville Ten., then home. I arrived home about 10:30 PM. I tried to arouse someone but everyone was sleeping. I knew where a window was where I could open the door. I opened the door and went to my brother's bedroom and roused him. The next morning I surprised Mother and Dad who were getting breakfast. I took a chance of getting shot but I didn't want to wake everyone. I left Saturday July 5 going back to Chicago.\n\nOctober 8, 1941 Wednesday\n\nGraduated from Mechanics school. Three of the graduating class were going to the same base. One of the boys had a car. We left Chicago at 4:00 PM for Baton Rouge, La. We planned our trip so each could have a lay over. We went through Pittsburg and left one there, he was to catch a boy in Baltimore who had a car. Meantime the one who had the care drove me to Washington to catch a train to Bristol and a bus home. Everything worked fine except the boys were to pick me up at the bus station in Kingsport. Because there were 2 bus stations in Kingsport, I went to one station to wait and my sisters to the other one. It so happened they went tot where my sisters were waiting. The boys were getting worried and afraid we were crossed up.\n\nGraduates of Aeronautical University  October 8, 1941\n\nDavid Adams, Marblelsville, PA - Jack Adams, 9103-114th St. Richmond Hill, Long Island, NY - Dean M Allen, Norway Iowa - Harold Baldwin, 150 Brookside Ave. Roosevelt, Long Island NY - John Patrick Campbell, 2719 South Seventh St. Philadelphia, PA - Joseph P Clark, 26 Chelsea Ave, East Orange, NJ -Charles Decker, Baltimore, MD - Gerald C Emery, 221 Laurel Ave, New Castle, PA - Peter P Gach, PA -Paul E Gore, 25 ½ Crafton St Wellsbora, PA - Ralph V Griffin, Box 415 Lumbsport, West Virginia - Roy L Kaylor, Clinchport, VA  Sol Metlin, Niagara St. Pittsburg, PA  Charles Montleon, NY  Henry Price, TX \n\nJoseph Richmond, Baltimore, MD  Leo Weil  Wells Wanger White Sweet Valley, PA  John V Williams, Winfield, Iowa  M A Wilson Jr, Sewen Pines Farm Skillman, NJ  Don Young 71 Oak St Hudson Falls, NY.\n\nAdditions: Joseph A Beruba, 217 Wallen St. Fall River, Mass (Ignition Class)  Charles Castmore, 511 Central Ave, Newark, NJ (Structures)  William L Fisk 39 Federal St. Greenfield, Mass (Ignition Class)  M Monroe Spodek, 3749 Neptune Ave, Sea-Brooklyn, NY (Structures).\n\nOriginal Drop Outs: B Bitterman (Hospital in Propa, Ohio) Madden, PA (Instament Class)  Richard Ross, PA, Kicked out in hud (failed).\n\nOctober 11, 1941\n\nArrived in Baton Rouge. Stayed at motel. On the 12th went to Baton Rouge Air Base and began regular duties, carried lumber first four days, then spent a week of KP. Next went on to Security Guard. When I went on security guard they strapped a .45 around my waist (no bullets) and said take these boys to the dump (about 10) to work. I marched them in order till I got out of sight then I let them relax. I had to take them to lunch at 12:00 and watch them while eating, then back to the dump. At 4:30I got them in line and we marched back to headquarters. Went a few nights to night school, but soon gave it up.\n\nDecember 7, 1941\n\nLaying on my back listening to my radio and planning on going on furlough next day. Suddenly a flash cam over the radio: Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. My radio became very popular after that. That shot my vacation, it was cancelled very quick. We were ordered to pack up and be ready to more at a moments notice.\n\nDecember 9, 1941\n\nPacked to leave Baton Rouge, LA. Destination unknown at this time.\n\nDecember 16, 1941\n\nLeft Baton Rouge going to Tuscan, Arizona, through Shreveport, Fort Worth, Dallas, etc\n\nDecember 18, 1941\n\nArrived at Tuscan (Davis Monthen Field) while at the base at Tuscan I was put on the graveyard shift. We were making bullet boxes to put on B-24's so we had to put those boxes on them. One morning I ate breakfast at 8:00, then went to get a shot and to give a blood sample. When they were taking the blood, I began to get sick. I didn't have far to go to by bunk and afterwards I went to work and my arm started swelling from the shot. The next morning I went to medical and they sent me to Base Hospital. They put me to bed and my arm swelled about 4 times regular size. They didn't give me any medicine and after 3 days I was well enough to get out of hospital.\n\nJanuary 10, 1942\n\nLeft Tuscan for Port of Embarkation (NY) but only got to El Paso and turned back arriving at Tuscan the 17th.\n\nJanuary 28, 1942\n\nWent on DS into New Mexico, near Rodeo and at Lordsburg (Parks, Dodge, Pinolie, and a Sergeant) (Pinolie, now known as John August. Sgt. Pinolie, whose real name was John August, was too young to enlist so he took his stepfathers name of Pinolie to enlist. Later we found out his real name when we were trying to find Pinolie for a reunion). Two training planes had forced landed near Lordsburg and we were to repair them. We stayed at a CCC camp and worked from there. Every morning at 6:00 they woke the CCC boys and that disturbed us. However, we had to get up and eat when they did. That was another cold place, day and night. Some of the boys went to Tombstone but they slipped out on me and the others. Landsburg had a restaurant, railroad station and a few other buildings.\n\nFebruary 1, 1942\n\nOr Squadron was divided into three groups. One group went to the Pacific and one to Britain. Left Tuscan about 11:30 AM. The group I was in went to Alexandria, LA.\n\nFebruary 3, 1942\n\nArrived at Alexandria, LA (Esler Field)\n\nFebruary 4, 1942\n\nBegan working with 109 Observation Squadron from Michigan. They didn't bring all of their men at once so we were loaned to them. They had two A-20's and a small plane or two. To get a crew, two men from our group were placed on each A-20. The lightest job was to see the wheel locks ere placed when the plane came in from the practice run and also removed when they were taking off. The two boys on my crew asked chief why me and my partners didn't get a raise. He said he would see about that.\n\nFebruary 15, 1942\n\nThe 109 Observation plane was so light that the pilots would put it in the air, the wind would hold it up and the engine would keep it from going backwards. I decided I wanted to ride it so I got a parachute on and climbed into the back seat. We flew out over the country side looking for sunbathers. Parking came in handy for that. The best part was flying over the Red River. The river banks were real high. We were flying lower than the banks, just above the water. Made PFC.\n\nMarch 13, 1942\n\nLeft Alexandria for Mobile, Alabama for two weeks practice with 109 Squadron (Brookly Field) with Bosak, Dewey, Parks and myself. One A-20 plane would pull target and the other plane would shoot at it. We were supposed to help service the planes and I decided I wanted to take a ride with them. They wouldn't let me in the cabin, afraid a cable might get tangled or back lash. So they strapped a parachute on my back and let me climb up in the Bombay seat. That was the front of the plane over the nose wheel. We went out over the ocean while the other planes made runs at the target. After practice we went back to the base and this is where I began to wonder, \"Will that nose wheel hold up or crush me to mince meat?\" We landed safely and my buddies congratulated me. They were such cowards they wouldn't take a ride. Had two weeks of pleasure, away from the base, and the 109th were good bosses.\n\nMarch 29, 1942\n\nReturned from Mobile to Alexandria where I learned I had made Corporal on March 15th.\n\nApril 2, 1942\n\nThis day I made 2nd grade Airplane Mechanic which meant more money.\n\nApril 18, 1942\n\nI was attached to a B-25 Squadron. Didn't have much to do. One day a pal and I went to explore patch of woods nearby. We found a perfect grapevine swing. You would swing out over a stream from one bank of the stream to the other side. Everything went well until Sam, who was heavier, took his turn. Our swing broke and Sam hit the water. All you could see was his cap floating down the stream. He did get out. One day a B-25 crashed back in the swamp. All my friends had to go that day to retrieve the bodies. They found four that day and when they went back the next day I had to go too. We had a native and his boat to take us to the plane. He knew his way through the swamps. The first day they had stretched ropes from one tree to another. They attached a rope pulley to that rope down to the plane. We all had to get out in the water, which was waist deep, and pull on the rope to lift the plane. There were two bodies we were looking for and we finally managed to find them. We tied them to the boat and headed back to dry land. When we reached dry land the Squadron had sent us sandwiches and drinks. Medical personnel took the bodies. Another day I decided I wanted to ride in one of the B-25's. I strapped a parachute on and crawled up in the cabin part. I got my money's worth this time. I said never again in a B-25. It was a rough ride. I could see out the window, the tips of the wings fluttering like a bird. My buddies had a good laugh when I told them never again. Left for home on a 10 day furlough. Arrived back at Esler field on April 29.\n\nJuly 2, 1942\n\nWe left Alexandria, LA by train. There wasn't much to do on the train, so most of the time we played Blackjack. I was real lucky. One time I won and got the cards. I was no good at shuffling cards so I gave them to my buddy to shuffle and we would split the pot. I don't remember how much we won but it was quite a lot of dimes. Jul 4th we arrived at For Dix, NJ.\n\nJuly 15, 1942\n\nWe stayed at Fort Dix, NJ, until July 15th, then we left Fort Dix for New York. At New York we went aboard ship for sailing. On board ship was terrible I had the luck of getting in the front hold that was the hottest part of the ship. We had to hang hammocks over the tables and that made it hotter. The boys slept any place they could lay down. We had one group who slept in the potato hold. They never did get below deck. Sometimes I slept on a table. There was a gutter around the edge of the ship. It was an ideal place to put a blanket to sleep. Well I tried it one night, I woke up about one o'clock and things were terrible. The wind was blowing, the boat was rolling and I decided I better start crawling. I got out of that gutter in a hurry. \"Louis Pasteur \" was the boat.\n\nJuly 24, 1942\n\nBoat stopped at Freeport, Africa. No one went ashore. At Freeport, Sierra Leon young boys came out to the ship and they would dive for money. Sometimes they would go pretty deep. The British did the cooking and we didn't care much for their food. We complained so much that our Captain managed to get our cook to do our cooking. As usual I got some kind of duty, so I got Guard Duty. I had to cover the whole ship from deck to deck. After Freeport we sailed around to Durban, South Africa. I thought the waves were pretty bad, and at times it looked like the shop was lower than the waves. No one ventured out on deck and we stayed close to the walls of the ship.\n\nAugust 4 & 5, 1942\n\nAt Durban we were allowed to leave the ship from 10 AM til about 5 PM. The first thing everyone did was go to the bank to exchange our US money to South African currency. We then hit a nice restaurant. Everyone ordered a big steak with eggs and chips. Chips were similar to our French fries. After eating, we started exploring the town, which had street cars we could hop on and off as we pleased. No charge. The best part of our travel here was by rickshaw. There were seven of us and we didn't want to split apart so the driver, a big bushy fellow, placed us all on the vehicle and away we went. I wondered about him pulling us but he had no trouble. He would get up to pretty good speed then raise his feet and we would drift along for ever so far by his getting a good balance. There was a small park we visited. At the edge of the park there were monkeys having a big time and an elephant tied close by. We saw a lady crocheting in the park, so we went up and talked to here. She told us about the town and temperature. Although it was mid-winter it was like Florida. She said sometimes lions and tigers came to the edge of the park.\n\nAugust 6, 1942\n\nLeft Durban and sailed for Suez.\n\nAugust 16, 1942\n\nArrived at Suez. Tents were already set up for us. We didn't have much to do so we mostly played cards. We were warned that the natives would steal our barracks bags if we didn't watch them. Sure enough they stole some of our bags that some of the boys were practically sleeping on. I found a good flat rock and rolled by blanket over it and made a good pillow. Since it was very hot in the day time and cooled at night, we slept in our clothes. One boy who had been on guard duty ate so many candy bars that he landed in the hospital. We had a chocolate bar with our rations.\n\nAugust 21, 1942\n\nWe left Suez by train. As we passed the outskirts of Damascus, going up the side of the mountain, we had a real good view of Damascus.\n\nAugust 23, 1942\n\nWe arrived in Syria, at Rayak we were put in a French Barracks building which had no cots so we slept on the floor. Somewhere along the line I acquired a small mattress which helped a lot. Our equipment hadn't arrived so we had little to do. All Non-Coms were ordered to practice drilling. When it came my time I let the men off easy. I didn't have much voice for drilling and sometimes I would pantomime. I could do very well on forward march and rear march. We bout our bread locally and it was seasoned with mealy bugs. I picked them out of my bread but some boys didn't bother.\n\nBetween August 23rd and September 12th I had a 24 hour furlough. There was a village nearby that we could visit. My fried and I decided to go to Beauret. We started down and looked at the American University and by now I was getting a little late and almost dark. We passed an ice cream bar so we got some ice cream and walked back to the corner to wait for a ride. There was no such thing as traffic so we began to worry. A native saw us and said maybe he could help us. A big truck came by and the native talked to the driver and the man said we could go with him so we crawled into the cab and he took us to the village. We were just in time to catch the truck back to the base.\n\nSeptember 12, 1942\n\nAt Baalbeck there wasn't much left, several big columns, one room in rough condition was pointed out to us. Our friend, we inquired, said it was the Virgin Room and lots of honeymooners were interested in it. Baalback didn't look to be very big, about two or three city blocks.\n\nSeptember 27, 1942\n\nLeft Rayak early in the morning and arrived at Lydia Air Base near Tel-A-Vive, Palestine in the afternoon of the same day. At Lydia Air Base we found two B-17's and they didn't have personnel to service them. There were four of us and they assigned two of us to each plane. We would have to change engines about every day, since they would make about a four hour run and the engine would wear out. Here again, I decided I wanted another ride. I talked to the pilots, and since they were making a test run, they gave me a parachute and told me to climb in. This time I rode in the cabin, and after riding awhile, I decided I wanted to know about the tail gunner's position. I climbed into the tail gunner's position and was tail gunner for awhile. Even though I couldn't get my buddies to go up, we still were recommended for our work here and that made us feel good.\n\nNovember 6, 1942\n\nVisited Jerusalem and Bethlehem we had a guide and he took us to the interesting places. While in Jerusalem we went to the Church of the Nativity, saw the Star of Bethlehem, the manager scene, the Wailing Wall, and where the Last Supper was, and many other Biblical sights.\n\nNovember 8, 1942\n\nLeft Lydia for Abu Sueur, Egypt near Ismalia, Egypt. At Abu Sueur, Egypt we had another good job. All engines shipped would get an ocean skim on the cylinders, so we had to take each cylinder off and buff them. They soon started putting chemical plugs where each spark plug was. These plugs took care of the moisture so what happened we lost that job. Some British were near by and every morning at 10:00 AM and again at 3:00 PM, they brought crumpets and tea for sale. I like their crumpets but didn't care much for tea.\n\nDecember 2, 1942\n\nLeft Abu Sueur for air base known as Landing Ground # 174, Amaria Desert, located Alexandria. We had P-40's to work on. Our Army was using P-40's to push the German Army back. While here we had a lot of trouble with dust storms. You could go to bed at night and wake up the next morning with your eyes covered with dust. It got so bad that sometimes we would go into Alexandria to stay, and since Alexandria was on the ocean there wasn't much dust. After one of these dust storms we had to clean all the planes. Each plane was designated a crew of three. My crew and I got our plane ready for test. The test pilot took it up but returned it immediately because the engine was vibrating. We had missed by one degree getting the props even. But within a few minutes we had it corrected and this time the pilot ok'ed it combat.\n\nAt night the darkness would confuse us. If I was away from my tent, the only way I could find it was to go to the mess hall and go straight to my tent. The Mess Hall was easy to find since it had a generator and lights.\n\nWhile we were here some Nomads had camped nearby. They would put out a wheat crop right in the desert and when it was ready to harvest, we looked out one morning and they had left.\n\nWhat little water we had was hauled in by truck. We didn't use water to clean the planes; we used gas which worked good in a spray gun.\n\nFebruary 8, 1943\n\nLeft landing ground # 174 for Biennia, Libya.\n\nFebruary 12, 1943\n\nArrived at Biennia. At Biennia Airstrip we now had B-24's to work on. We were about 12 miles from Benghazi where there were three landing strips all nearby. This was another hot place, and in all the time we were there we saw about one minute of rain. To cool our beer we them on sand bags we had around the tent. The wind blowing through the tent onto the can would cool it (a little). A big pest we had were locusts (or grasshoppers). They would get in our food, our mouth if you didn't keep it closed, but worst in our beds. We had mosquito nets for our beds but the grasshoppers got through some way. You don't ever want a grasshopper crawling over your naked body. Our tent had 3 poles holding it up and at the top of those poles you could get a bucket full of grasshoppers.\n\nFebruary 13, 1943\n\nThe Germans had left a 3000 lb. bomb and we didn't think much about it. Some boys pitched their tent nearby between a fence and the bomb. Italian paratroopers slipped in and set the bomb off. It so happened the boys woke up and ran. Their tent and clothes were blown through the fence, the size of the fence squares. We had some planes we were working on and the paratroopers put plastic bombs in them. The bombs were pulled out of two of the planes but one was burned up.\n\nThe B-24's made runs over Italy and Germany and when they came back they would have to be repaired. Some would need the engine changed, the wings, fuel tanks and bullet holes repaired.\n\nFebruary 17, 1943\n\nMade another raid on Benghazi (8:30 PM).\n\nMay 21, 1943\n\nWent to Marble Arch on DP to work on P-40's. Two P-40's made a forced landing on the beach, we had to tear them apart and transfer them back to Biennia which took a little more time than we planned. We took two of our tents and a cook. Once we were running out of food and we borrowed some from the British who were nearby. They gave us some dry peas and potatoes, which we soaked about two days and they still weren't fit to eat. One of the boys went back to Biennia and got some food. They sent word for me to come back to Biennia but I told them we were about through and I would stay awhile longer to help. It was very hot here and the ocean was back of our tents, that help[ed take care of our recreation time.\n\nThe Marble Arch was an arch that spanned the roadway. It was about 100 feet high, 50 feet wide and 50 feet long where the cars would go through. Near the top there was space for two bronze men about 6 feet long laying down. The story was that these two countries would send a man and when they met that would be the dividing line of their countries. There was nothing at Marble Arch itself. One boy decided he wanted a big toe, from one of the bronze men, so he sawed a very long time and he finally got one about the size of a big fist.\n\nJuly 23, 1943\n\nWent from Castle Benito to Bovina Airport near Tunis and spent the night. I was supposed to do some work on B-24's but it was already completed.\n\nJuly 24, 1943\n\nI started back to Benito and went by Castle Seniti (stayed for fuel) then went back to Cabrite and spent the night with the 316th Transport Group.\n\nJuly 25, 1943\n\nArrived back in Benito. (all this trip by plane)\n\nAugust 12, 1943\n\nLeft Benito on furlough, going to Cairo by transport. From Cairo went by train to Alexandria.\n\nAugust 13, 1943\n\nBeginning of furlough.\n\nAugust 22, 1943\n\nLeft Alexandria going back to Cairo.\n\nAugust 23, 1943\n\nReported back to transport office and asked about a plane ride back to camp.\n\nAugust 26, 1943\n\nReceived a ride and arrived back in camp, three days overdue.\n\nSeptember 21, 1943\n\nLeft Benito on convoy trip and went to Adgedabia, volunteered to drive a truck (three quarter ton British Chevrolet). All of the boys in the outfit had a truck and one left over. I was left over too, I told them I couldn't drive, but they said I had to drive part of the way and another boy would help. I went about twenty five miles before I got the truck in high gear. To beat that the steering wheel was on the right side and you changed gear with the left hand. I brought up the rear but made it until I got help.\n\nSeptember 22, 1943\n\nWent from Adgedabia to point beyond Marble Arch.\n\nSeptember 23, 1943\n\nSpent night at outskirts of Beirut.\n\nSeptember 25, 1943\n\nWe visited ruins of Old City of Homs. The Old City of Homs was well worth seeing. Parts of the city were still standing. The bathing vats were still there, placed even with the floor. Around the top of the columns and wall were small figurines about five inches big. Can you imagine the work that must have taken?

Another boy and I were put on guard and we stayed in the upstairs window where we could see up the hill. There was a mattress in the room. We took turns crawling under the mattress and still couldn't keep warm.\n\nJanuary 14, 1945\n\nAnother boy and I pulled guard duty. We were outside in a field. We were getting hit pretty heavy with bursts. We decided we would go inside the barn where the others were sleeping. I started to go back out and about 9:30 as I got to the door some kind of mortar shell hit and 12 inches from the floor. The shell got me in the leg, the Sgt. Had me crawl back into the building and he checked my wounds. The other boy got hit in the temple. After getting patched up the ambulance boys picked me up and started back to the camp with me and three others. I know where two came from but haven't' figured out where the other two came from. I thought we were the only ones in the area. About two hundred yard from where I was hit the Red Cross truck hit a mine. The two boys carried us back to another truck. At headquarters I remember being set out of the truck and snow falling on me. The next thing I knew I was in a hospital.\n\nJanuary 15, 1945\n\nWhen I woke up in the hospital the doctors had my left leg in a cast up to my hip. The part of my right leg that was remaining was all bandaged.\n\nJanuary 16-17, 1945\n\nIn 97 Evacuation Hospital.\n\nJanuary 18-19, 1945\n\nIn General Hospital.\n\nJanuary 20, 1945\n\nStill in 45 General Hospital.\n\nJanuary 21, 1945\n\nWent to 298 General Hospital.\n\nJanuary 23, 1945\n\nLeft 298 (Liege).\n\nJanuary 24, 1945\n\nArrived at 1st General Hospital in Paris.\n\nFebruary 10, 1945\n\nLeft Paris.\n\nFebruary 12, 1945\n\nHad to lay over two days in Azores, plane developed engine trouble.

Shook hands with them and talked awhile.\n\nMarch 22, 1945\n\nRe-amputation operation. When they operated on my leg in the field, they only did enough until I could get to a better equipped hospital. They gave me a shot in the spine and I was numb from waist down. There was a screen so I couldn't see them There was a large light over them and I got a reflection from the mirror. I could hear them sawing the bone but I couldn't feel a thing. Spent a long time in hospital after the surgery.\n\nJune 7, 1945\n\nLeft Battle Creek for home on a 30 day furlough.

Two of my sisters, Edna Bishop and Rudy Kitzmiller encouraged me to fill in my remembrances of the events of each day that I could recall. They wrote this story.\n\nAfter my recuperation I took advantage of the G.I. bill and entered East Tennessee State University to complete my education. When I finished,, I went to work at Tennessee Eastmen, Kingsport TN for 32 years retiring in 1978. I retired to my farm in Church Hill, TN, to enjoy my wife Jean, son Lee, daughter Martha and granddaughter Audry. Incidentally my son and daughter finished school at East Tennessee State University and my granddaughter is a freshman there now.\n\nRoy L.
