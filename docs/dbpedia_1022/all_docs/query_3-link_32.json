        "text": "About the B-26 Marauder Men\n\nTwenty thousand Marauder Men, pilots of the Martin B-26 Marauder with survivors now in the twilight of life, A time when old soldiers are normally honored, The surviving B-26 Marauder Men of World War II Did awaken to discover that a group of uninformed civilians, Along with a U.S. Congress and president who endorsed The view of the uninformed, Had, by public law, asserted that these very special pilots, Pilots who flew the B-26 Marauder from The beginning of World War II to its end, Had been credited with being afraid to fly their assigned aircraft And had walked away -- literally deserting their duty.\n\nDue to the manner in which the uninformed stated their claims, The humiliating and onerous charge applied equally To the U.S. Air Corps, to the USN and USMC, and to allies of the United States.\n\nWe all know of the ballad line: Old soldiers never die, they just fade away.\n\nThe Marauder Men may now be fading away, But those living will not, at this late hour, or ever in remaining lifetime, Tolerate their fellow Marauder Men and themselves Being trampled on by the uninformed.\n\nRegardless of the bullets that were fired. The men who died, or the injuries suffered, Those men who flew the B-26 Marauder did not falter in war, And, at the end of life, they will not now falter In protecting the reputation of those who served So faithfully and gallantly.\n\nSo help us God and may God bless the Marauder Men! Read Women Air Force Service Pilots, WASP, The Gender War Story\n\n/s/ Major General John O. Moench, USAF (Ret)\n\nOn behalf of all B-26 Marauder Men I am very disturbed about a trend I spotted on eBay. In the last several weeks I have noticed personal effects from our Maraudermen showing up on eBay for sale. Some of the sellers say they are finding the material in dumpsters, others say it was purchased through estate sales. I am so saddened that medals such as a Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), and personal letters home to family are being sold on eBay. Today I found letters from an airman written to his family back home, his military records and files and the telegram sent to his family notifying them of his death. This information has likely been kept all these years by someone very dear to him, someone who loved and missed him very much. Selling this material on eBay is the worst thing. Perhaps the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 should be amended to mandate all military medals not maintained in family be return to the government.\n\nI believe records, medals, and other personal material kept all these years by a WWII Marauder Man or his family should be honored instead of ending up on eBay for sale to a collector to hoard or display at collectors conventions like American Society of Military Insignia Collectors (ASMIC) or Orders Medals Society of America (OMSA).\n\nI have visited this b26.com for years and have seen all those who honor our Marauder Men. Is there anyway you could encourage family members and others not to discard or sell such artifacts either through estate sales or Internet sites such as eBay?\n\nMaybe people could mail the material to b26.com or directly to University of Akron, Marauder Archive. Akron Marauder Archive will store the material and information will be used by researchers to help tell an accurate history of what our beloved Maraudermen did to help us maintain our freedom.\n\nThe selling of dead veterans personal material like death notices or medals is a breach of moral standards and should not be allowed by eBay. The veterans effects are extensions of our American \"family\" and not trivial items to be sold on eBay for $20.\n\nI appreciate preservation instincts vs. the reality of the marketplace and peoples priorities. I ask the children and grandchildren to reconsider discarding or selling artifacts on the Internet. Email b26.com so they can help arrange a donation to Akron. If you intend to sell an item Im asking you consider donating it. Other folks that are going to toss these items need to know that they have another choice. I appeal to your patriotism so that our heroes and your loved ones will not be forgotten. -Don Enlow, son of Malcolm Enlow"
