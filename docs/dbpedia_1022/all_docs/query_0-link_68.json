In mid-December 1961 the 464th TCW began to deploy to South East Asia(SEA) as part of Operation Mule Train.\n\nThe route was Honolulu, Wake Island, Guam, then Clark AB, PI. Crews would rest, and aircraft maintained before going on to Tan Son Nhut, RVN.\n\nOne C-123 mission which was especially prominent in Vietnam, although it involved only one plane, was that of VIP support for MACV.\n\nA special VC-123 was assigned to MACV to transport General Westmoreland and his staff. The airplane was painted with a white top and unpainted belly, which was shined to a mirror finish. The interior of the airplane was configured with special VIP seating. Because of the overall white finish, the airplane was known as The White Whale.
