I posted this article on Facebook and my followers like it. Thanks for writing this!\n\n———-\n\nArt Genesta\n\n6:16 PM on February 14, 2017 by artvid1@cox.net\n\nLove this site. Looking for more info on my father.\n\n———-\n\nMelissa\n\n10:22 AM on March 4, 2017 by wheatldee@aol.com\n\nI just wanted to say thank you for this wonderful website and for the work you have put in to it. I so enjoy seeing the declassified mission information. Last year I created 3 scrapbooks (for his grandchildren) to honor my father’s service in the 458th. He was a tail gunner, and like many others did not speak about his time in the war. He did save pictures of crew members, his flight diary and even a small British flag from V day. With the information from your website, I was able to map all of his missions, what plane he flew in and was able to create a real keepsake for our family. Thank you again for making this available- it is truly appreciated.\n\n———-\n\nJames Oberg\n\n9:17 AM on March 9, 2017 by jamesEoberg@comcast.net\n\nMy wife and I had the awesome honor of attending Fred Popper’s 100th birthday recently in Lakeview, Arkansas, where he lives with his son David, now retired and fishing. More than forty five friends and relatives attended from all over the US. Fred’s daughter Linda was my wife’s best childhood friend growing up in Winnetka, Illinois, in the late 1950s, and he was a ‘second father’ to her, as they lived directly across the street. Fred is in a wheelchair but is fully alert, full of memories, and a healthy appetite. Not long ago he was able to participate in an ‘Honor Flight’ visit to Washington DC, which was a great pleasure for him.\n\n———-\n\nKimberly Swanson\n\n1:37 AM on April 15, 2017 by swansonkimberlyk@gmail.com\n\nHello,\n\nSo interesting to find some information about my late great-uncle Sgt.
