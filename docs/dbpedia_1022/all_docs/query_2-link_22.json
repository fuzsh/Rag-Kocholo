and 559th, was activated at MacDill Field, Tampa, FloridaDecember 1, 1942.\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, p. 4.\n\n2 Dec 1942\n\nThe next day personnel of the newly activated group began arriving.The original cadre came from the 21st Bombardment Group of MacDillField. Later fillers to headquarters personnel were assigned from Headquartersand Headquarters Squadron, Third Bomber Command, Miami Beach, Florida,and Daniel Field, Georgia. The majority of the original members of the556th squadron were recruited from the 313th Bombardment Squadron. Originalpersonnel for the 557th came from the 314th, those of the 558th came fromthe 315th, and the 559th from the 398th. All those parent squadrons weremembers of the 21st Bombardment Group (M) stationed at MacDill. Otherscame from Barksdale Field, Louisiana, Anti-Submarine Company, Jacksonville,Florida, 344th Bombardment Group (M) Lakeland, Florida, and 309th BombardmentGroup, Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, p. 4.\n\n20 Dec 1942 â Major David S.Blackwell becomes first Group commander\n\nOn December 20 Major David S. Blackwell of Third Bomber Command wasassigned as first commanding officer of the group. Throughout Decemberand January additional personnel continued to arrive.\n\nâ Historyof the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, p. 4.\n\n19 Jan 1943 â Carl B. Storriebecomes Group commander\n\nOn January 19, 1943 Colonel Carl B. Storrie was assigned from Headquartersand Headquarters Squadron, Third Bomber Command as group commander, relievingMajor Blackwell, who remained as group executive until January 22, at whichtime he was transferred to the newly created 391st Bombardment Group (M).\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, p. 4.\n\nJan 1943\n\nThe greater part of the personnel, who had been recruited from OTUand BTU organizations, began, for the first time, to feel that they wereto become part of a real combat unit. During the first phase of training,group headquarters was located temporarily in a two-story barracks. The556th,557th and 559th squadrons were billeted in the casual camp area, ratheraptly called \"Boomtown.\" In the shacks the men could look through the roofand see the sky, and look down through the boards of the floor and seethe sand. Some mornings in January were cold but, in true Army style, heatwas furnished only on warm mornings. Chow for the field mess was lousy,but could be supplemented by meals at the PX and soda fountains. Officersate at the swank officers' club, but rates were not exactly cheap for newlymade second louies.\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, p. 5.\n\nBack in the States, the new pilots coming into Storrie's Group wereMarauder shy. There had been too many stories about the airplane. Storrie'sfirst indoctrination procedure was to take them for a ride in his own plane,skimming the tree tops, flying under telephone wires, flying sometimeswith the props clearing the ground by a matter of inches. Within a fewweeks, the same kids were skimming the tree tops, flying under telephonewires within inches of the ground. When their wings brushed the shrubberyin the Florida countryside, they reported that they weren't really flyinglow-they just hit a low flying green parrot.\n\nWith superb ground crews servicing the planes, they had gotten overthe fear of engine failure. Now these same men swear by the Marauder, evenas the Fortress crews say theirs is the only plane in the world.\n\nThe Marauder is a fast bomber; its crews are more like fighter pilots.\"But then,\" says Carl Storrie, in his broad Texas accent, \"I guess everypilot is a pursuit pilot at heart.\" One thing is certain-most of the menin Storrie's Group are.\n\nâ Yank (28 Nov. 1943).\n\n2 Feb 1943 â \"Hat in the Ring\"session\n\nThe final details of the first phase were completed by February 2,when the entire group, at Colonel Storrie's summons, met at the base theaterfor his famous \"Hat in the Ring session.\" The Colonel began the meetingby throwing his had \"in the ring\" in the name of the 387th, and calledon all men to do their part. The answer was a unanimous affirmative.\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, p. 5.This is Carl Storrie, ourGroup Commander. He was the body and soul of the 387th Bomb Group fromJanuary 1943 to VE day (May 7, 1945), even though he was transferred onNovember 14, 1943. He was the inspiration for both the enlisted man andthe officer. The early contact with him was the so-called âhat in the ringâappearance. There were actually two âhat in the ringâ meetingsâthe firstone February 2, 1943, when a meeting was called in the theatre. This wasattended by approximately 3/4 of the 387th personnel. Another quarter ofthe total overall strength of the 387th had not yet reported for duty.They were called to a meeting in the fireproof machine room of the hangar.\n\nThis group, about 400, including myself, had settled in to the areabehind the large metal doors. When the time arrived for the meeting, themetal doors banged as if hit by a battering ram. This really focused ourattention on the doors. We could not see Col. Storrie, but this hard-visoredhat came sailing into the room. His first and only words were, âMy hatis in the ringâis yours?â He meant every word of it. He then proceededto say that this Group was going to be the best and he expected everyoneto believe it.\n\nColonel Storrie carried this same enthusiastic attitude in trainingand combat. He wouldnât expect you to do anything that he wouldnât do.He was a believer in everyone doing the job he was supposed to do. He wasthe boss, and friend, of enlisted and officer alike. If a person neededdisciplining, he was the one to do it, but only after he was convincedthat that course of action was required. It didnât make any differencewhether you were a private or squadron commander. His enthusiastic attitude,work ethic, and inspiration were evident throughout our entire trainingand combat period. It seemed to me that he had instilled a loyalty amongall, and they retained that âhat in the ringâ attitude throughout our 2½ years.\n\nâ Gayle Smith, former OperationsOfficer, during an after dinner presentation at the Orlando Reunion Banquet\n\n8 Feb 1943 â Beginning of Second Phase training\n\nOn February 8, 1943 the group moved into Hangar 4 at MacDill. Therethe operations, intelligence, engineering, ordnance, and armament sectionswere quickly set up and the six-week period of second phase training began.A strenuous flying schedule was initiated with four-hour periods each formornings, afternoons and evenings. The bombing ranges at Venice, Osprey,Mullet Key and Avon Park were used for practice bombing missions, and selectedareas in the Gulf of Mexico for gunnery practice. Intelligence briefingsusually preceded all missions. Crews not engaged in flying attended groundschool, which included lectures on air tactics, aircraft identification,first aid and nomenclature of guns and ammunition. The result of this strenuousschedule was a steady welding together of the various units so that theycould move quickly and fight effectively..\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, p. 5.\n\n9 Feb 43 â Roster of Staff Officers filled\n\nBy February 9 the roster of group staff officers had been filled. Theseincluded Colonel Carl P. Storrie, commanding officer, Lieutenant ColonelRobert W. Stillman, group executive officer, Major Samuel L. Crosthwait,group adjudant, Captain John M. Campbell, group S-2, Major Thomas M. Seymour,group S-3, Captain Marvin M. Harvey, group S-1, Captain James L. Moffett,group surgeon, and First Lieutenant William F. Taulde, group chaplain.\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, pp. 4-5.\n\n18 Mar 43 â Colonel Stillmanleaves to take command of 322nd\n\nOn March 18 Lieutenant Colonel Herbert M. Stillman, Group executiveofficer, was transferred from the 387th to take command of the 322nd andthe air echelon of one squadron were in England, and Colonel Stillman flewto England to assume command. It was from there that he was to take offon the fatal mission to Ijmuiden, Holland on May 17, 1943. On that missionten B-26's, led by Colonel Stillman and flying at low level, were shotdown by the Germans. Colonel Stillman, fortunately, suffered only brokenbones in the crash and, though taken prisoner, escaped alive.\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, pp. 5-6.\n\n23 Apr 43 â Group moves to DraneField\n\nBy the end of the second week of April the group was nearing the endof second phase training. Since the third phase called for group operationsby itself in cooperation with a service group, personnel of the 387th beganpacking technical and personnel equipment for their first move to DraneField, near Lakeland, Florida. The move was accomplished on April 23, andin the end proved agreeable to all. At first the men missed the ornateand elaborate PX's and clubs of MacDill Field, but this loss was more thancompensated for by the adoption of more comfortable and less formal uniformsand the knowledge that they were the only unit on the field. Working inthe open and in tents after using the big hangars at MacDill gave thema feeling of real accomplishment, for they were operating under conditionssimilar to those in a combat theater.\n\nShortly after the group arrived at Drane Field, the second phase oftraining was completed and the third began. Under Colonel Storrie's abledirection the combat crews and ground personnel were becoming expert intheir jobs, and accustomed to operations at any time or place.\n\nDuring second phase training several pilots had become quite \"hot\" andwere flying their planes rather low over the Florida terrain. One day LieutenantCharles B. White, now Major White, came back with leaves and twigs caughtunderneath the fuselage, scratches and green stain from leaves under thewings. He told the crew chief to hurry and get the plane cleaned up andthe scratches painted over. This the crew chief promptly accomplished.Soon Colonel Storrie came around the line to look over the planes and stoppedcritically before Lieutenant White's particular ship.\n\nâSergeant, what happened to your ship here with these scratches on it?\"\n\n\"My pilot hit a bird, sir,\" answered the crew chief, loyally lying.\n\n\"Well, what caused this green stain underneath the wings?\"\n\n\"Why, he hit a parrot, sir.\"\n\nThe colonel closed his jaw tightly and walked away.\n\nBefore leaving Lakeland the group, because of its fine record of trainingduring this period, received a personal commendation from Brigadier GeneralParker, commanding general of Third Bomber Command, stating that the trainingrecord of the 387th was the finest yet done by any medium bombardment group.\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, pp. 6-7.\n\n5 May 43 â Maj. Bykes joins Groupas Executive Officer\n\nOn May 5, Major Philip Bykes, of the 25th Wing of the Anti-SubmarineCommand, joined the group as executive officer, filling the vacancy leftby the transfer of Lieutenant Colonel Stillman.\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, pp. 7.\n\n10 May 43 â Air echelon movesfrom Lakeland to Godman Field\n\nThird phase training continued into May and then slowed down becauseof a shortage of gasoline. ... With the end of the third phase in sight,the group was ordered to Godman Field, Fort Knox, Kentucky to completethis stage and to join the Second Army maneuvers, then in progress. On,May 10, Colonel Storrie led the air echelon in a group mission from Lakelandto Godman Field.\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, p. 7.\n\n11 May 43 â Ground echelon leavesLakeland for Godman Field\n\nThe ground echelon, under command of Major Crosthwait, left Lakelandon May 11th by train and rejoined the air echelon at Godman Field two dayslater.\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, p. 7.\n\n14 May 1943 â 322nd BG makesfirst B-26 attacks over Europe\n\n12 B-26's are dispatched against the Velsen power station at Ijmuiden,The Netherlands; 11 hit the target at 1100 hours; 1 B-26 is damaged beyondrepair when it crashes upon returning to base and 9 others are damaged;casualties are 1 KIA and 7 MIA. .... The attack at Ijmuiden is madeat low level by the 322d Bombardment Group (Medium), the first US mediumbomber group to become operational in the UK.\n\nThe three B-26 Groups slated for operations against European targetsarrived in England soon after the Allied invasion of North Africa and weresent on to Tunisia. There they soon learned that low-level attacks wereineffective and costly. A switch to medium altitude was made, with formationsof four to six a/c dropping on the lead a/c, equipped with a Norden bombsight.Losses were reduced, bombing accuracy improved and the groups effectivelysupported the fighting in Sicily and Italy from bases in Corsica and Sardinia.\n\nIn the meantime more groups were arriving in England and were assignedto the Eighth Air Force, understandably pre-occupied with heavy bomberoperations against strategic targets in Germany. The B-26 Wing's staffofficers apparently ignored the lessons in the Pacific and Africa and chosethe British Doctrine of small formations attacking vital targets at lowlevel, where precise bombing was necessary to minimize civilian casualtiesin the occupied countries of France, Belgium and Holland.\n\nThe first such mission was assigned on 14 May 43. The target was a powergenerating station at Ijmuiden, Hollandâsource of power for northern Holland.Twelve Marauders flew the mission; all were damaged, one man was killedand photo reconnaissance revealed no bombs hit the target.\n\nâ Paul Priday (556th B.S.),Missionto Mayen.\n\n17 May 1943 â B-26s of 322ndBG slaughtered en route to Ijmuiden\n\n11 B-26's of the 322d Bombardment Group (Medium) are dispatched ona low-level mission to bomb power stations at Haarlem and Ijmuiden, TheNetherlands; 1 B-26 aborts, the other 10 are all shot down before theyreach the target; casualties are 58 MIA. This mission prompts the EighthAir Force to abandon low-level medium bomber attacks.\n\nThree days later, over, the strenuous objections of the Group Commander,a second attack was ordered on the same target. Eleven a/c were launchedand flew across the channel at 50' altitude to avoid German radar. Thirty-threemiles from the Dutch coast, one a/c aborted with an electrical problem.The pilot increased altitude as he turned back and possibly alerted Germanradar. This incident was combined with a navigational error, which broughtthe formation over a heavy defended area before they even approached thetarget.\n\nBombing results were negative, ten a/c were shot down and the only Marauder,which returned to England was the one, which aborted over the channel.\n\nThis mission resulted in a reevaluation of' the low-level tactics inwhich the crews were being trained. Retraining was initiated, both in England,and the Operational Training Units in the United States. Bombing was tobe done from 10,000 to 15,000 feet with lead crews utilizing the Nordenbomb sight and wing a/c dropping, when the lead a/c dropped. This requiredprecise formations - six a/c in a flight, three flights in a box and twoboxes in a group. (three boxes for a maximum effort.)\n\nâ Paul Priday (556th B.S.),Missionto Mayen.\n\n20 May 43 â Simulatedattack on power plant at Soneca, Georgia\n\nDuring the Tennessee maneuvers of the early summer the missions flownby the B-26s of the 387th in close support of ground troops played a largepart in assisting the attacking Blue Army by inflecting large losses onthe defending Red Army. On May 20th during the visit of Third Air Forceinspectors, a mission was flown from Godman Field to simulate an attackon a power plant at Soneca, Georgia, and the group was pronounced \"readyfor combat\".\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, pp. 7-8.\n\n21 May 43 â Air echelon alertedfor overseas movement\n\nThe next day the air echelon was alerted for overseas movement....\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, pp. 8.\n\n23 May 43 â Air echelon arrivesat Selfridge Field to pick up new B-26s\n\n...and by May 23rd all air echelon personnel had left Godman Fieldby train for Selfridge Field, Michigan. This separation of the air andground units was to last until the reunion in England. There were rumorsat the time that ground and air echelons were to be permanently separated,as in the case of the 344th Bombardment Group. No one wanted to believethose reports, because since December an efficient organization had beenbuilt and close friendships formed. Also, very few, after the months ofstrenuous training, had any desire to return to MacDill and begin trainingover again.\n\nThe flight echelon arrived at Selfridge Field on May 23, 1943. Therethe crews found new B-26s and new personal equipment. For two weeks thecrews were busy checking out the new ships, testing gas consumption, andbecoming accustomed to the feel of the new combat models of the B-26 Marauder.Since only a minimum of ground personnel had come along, the crews hadto take care of both technical work and administrative details. Pilotsbecame adjutants, gunners, first sergeants and sergeant-majors, new rolesfor flying crews.\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, p. 8.\n\nThu, 10 Jun 43 â Air echelonmoves to Hunter Field; Ground echelon leaves for Camp Kilmer\n\nOn Friday [June 10 was actually a Thursday], June 10, the entire flightechelon prepared to take off from Selfridge to Hunter Field, Savannah,Georgia on the first leg of the journey to England. When thunderheads werereported over the mountains on the route to Savannah, there was some doubtconcerning the time of take-off. All doubt was removed, however, aboutnine o'clock when Colonel Storrie, piloting Bat-Outa-Hell II, took offleading the 558th squadron. At intervals of one hour apart the other squadrons,the 556th, 559th and 557th, followed. Some planes did not leave at thattime because modifications had not been completed.

The stay at GooseBay was only long enough to allow for eating, refueling, a short nap andbriefing.\n\nFlying to B W 1, Greenland, was by far the most hazardous part of thejourney because most of the trip was made in a thick fog which limitedvisibility to a hundred yards. It also provided some beautiful sights,for when the planes were about fifty miles from land, the fog broke, andthe crews first saw the icebergs drifting in the sea 9,000 feet below,resembling giant ice cream cones of multiple geometric designs. The landingwas a difficult procedure requiring a great amount of skill. The approachis in one direction only and requires the landing of the plane on the water'sedge where the landing strip, made of mesh, rose rapidly uphill to a heightof 160 feet above sea level. The crunching of the wheels against the meshwas a welcome sound to all crews.

All troops aboard had meanwhile been initiatedinto the ominous habit of wearing life preservers. From the very firstthe great number of soldiers on board gave the ship the look of a slaver.Personnel were divided into sections which changed quarters each afternoon.Those who had been on deck one night went below the next, and vice-versa.For the enlisted men and junior officers there was not much to choose betweenthe pallets on deck and their stifling air of the hold. A dozen secondlieutenants were jammed into a cabin originally built for two. First lieutenants,crowded eight into one of the same type cabins, fared a little better.The tradition of R H I P was carefully observed on up the line so thatthe single one-star general aboard basked alone in a single cabin.\n\nMeals, served twice a day, were quite good as far as the officers wereconcerned; but to dignify the sorry stuff served to the enlisted men bythe name meals would be a gross overstatement.

The big ship passed two strongconvoys in military column, trailing barrage balloons behind them and escortedby destroyers. After turning south and proceeding down the Irish Sea, theQueen Mary, about dusk, made a horseshoe turn and headed northeast intothe Firth of Clyde. In the last sunlight of a gorgeous cloudless day thesoft light of a summer evening glanced across the hedgerows, rounded greenhills, ripe wheat fields, thatched roof cottages and yellow haystacks togive all objects a warm golden sheen. The sight of a girl in a red dress,walking with her dog in the fields along the shore, added the finishingtouch to a picturesque sight. Maybe the scene would be that beautiful anytime; maybe it only looked that good to soldiers ending an ocean voyage.\n\nFinally the Queen Mary drew abreast of Gourock into the company of fifteenor more large ships, many ex-luxury liners, all loaded with soldiers.

In contrastto the training period, when the squadrons had operated with a good bitof independence, group headquarters took over a larger control. Group operations,group intelligence, group personnel and other sections in headquartersbegan drawing men from the squadron sections to help with their work. Therewas relatively little air activity because many modifications had to bemade on the planes and because there was no gas until late in the month.Ground school was organized for air crews and toward the end of July severalpractice bombing missions and \"doughnuts\" north to the Wash were flown.All efforts were made to see that the crews were sufficiently shaken downand primed before the time came for operations.\n\nâ History of the 387th Bombardment Group (M) AAF, p. 16.\n\nAs operations began, squadron commanders of the 387th were: 556th, CaptainWalter J.
