Robert Horvitz for their “seminal discoveries concerning the genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death” and for “establishing and using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as an experimental model system.” The three scientists have “sowed the seeds” for the current explosion in programmed cell death research.\n\nDr. Sydney Brenner, currently at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif. ...

Longevity is more than the issue that people want to live longer, it is also for the fact that many diseases are related to the aging process such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and osteoporosis, to name a few. In recent years, a molecule (DAF-2) that is similar to the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) has been discovered capable of influencing lifespan in the microscopic worm C. elegans and fruitfly D. melanogaster. Dr. Martin Holzenberger and colleagues (Institut National de la Sante, Paris, France) have found that reducing the levels of ...

Proteins of this family are defined to have a vacuolar protein sorting 10 domain at the N-terminus. They play important roles as a sorting agency within the cells and transport a variety of intracellular proteins between the Golgi apparatus, endosome, lysosome, secretory granules, and plasma membrane. They are also involved in signal transduction. Clinically, they have been implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report details on two brothers deceased at 20 months and 2 years of age, respectively, with a neurological phenotype including infantile spasms, intellectual disability, global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, spastic quadriplegia, and delayed myelination. Whole exome sequencing and autozygome analysis showed homozygous missense variant in the SORCS3 gene. The pathogenicity is supported by functional studies in the patient mesenchymal stem cells. Patients' cells showed less proliferation capability than normal cells. In addition, making the same mutation in normal cells revealed a viability defect in them. This is the first study on human subjects with a SORCS3 gene defect and supports the important role of SORCS3 in the central nervous system. ...

RanBPM has a crucial role in mediating disease pathology by interacting with diverse proteins to regulate their functions. Previously, we compiled diverse cellular functions of RanBPM. Since then the functions of RanBPM have increased exponentially. In this article, we have updated the functions of RanBPM through its manifold interactions that have been investigated to date, according to their roles in protein stability, transcriptional activity, cellular development, neurobiology, and the cell cycle. Our review provides a complete guide on RanBPM interactors, the physiological role of RanBPM in cellular functions, and potential applications in disease therapeutics. ...

Pathological conditions such as cancer, neurodegeneration, ischemia, cholestasis, and atherosclerosis are all strongly associated with deregulated levels of apoptosis in which p53 dysfunction has a prominent role. We will highlight recent developments of p53-induced apoptosis in human diseases, with a focus on modulation of liver cell apoptosis. In addition, we will discuss controversies arising from widespread p53 activation as a therapeutic approach to cancer. Recent studies have provided relevant and unprecedented information about mechanistic antiapoptotic functions of the endogenous bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), suggesting that the finely tuned, complex control of p53 by Mdm-2 (mouse double minute-2, an oncoprotein) is a key step in UDCA modulation of p53-triggered apoptosis. We will also review recent therapeutic strategies and clinical applications of targeted agents, their safety, and efficacy, with particular emphasis on potential benefits of UDCA. ...

Investigations into potential new treatments to reduce cancer spread are ongoing, with immunotherapy generating much interest. Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the body's innate immune system and are known for their ability to target and lyse cancer cells. Ion channels have previously been linked to the growth and development of tumors, but recent research suggests that these channels may also serve to alter immune cell functioning. This review examines the current understanding as to the role of ion channels in NK cells and how manipulation of these channels may increase NK effectiveness in targeting and removing cancer cells. With a large number of existing FDA-approved drugs targeting ion channels, potential exists for drug repurposing in order to improve immunotherapy and thus patient outcomes. ...

Hyaluronan Mediated Motility Receptor (HMMR) encodes a receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM), a non-integral cell surface hyaluronan receptor and intracellular protein that promotes mitotic spindle formation and cell motility. RHAMM has been found to have increased expression in both cancers and wounds, and when cancers show increased RHAMM expression poor outcomes have occurred. Therefore, RHAMM has been shown to contribute to both natural healing mechanisms and cancer cell pathology. RHAMM is expressed in breast tissue and forms a polarity normalizing complex with BRCA1. Mutations of BRCA1 have been associated with a loss of apicobasal cell polarity along with a subsequent increased expression of RHAMM. Here we show how a human breast carcinoma cell line was maintained in media prepared with a dilute saline solution that had been exposed to a dielectrophoretic (DEP) electromagnetic field (EMF) generated by 3 amperes of direct current (dc) to a device housing an array of conductive rings. This Bio-electric Field Enhancement (BEFE) device has been available commercially for use in baths/footbaths since 1996 and consumers claim that it provides health benefits ranging from lowering blood pressure to faster wound healing. Our studies showed a significant inhibition of growth of human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells when they were maintained in media prepared with dc-DEP EMF force treated dilute saline while no growth inhibition occurred when the same cells were maintained in identically prepared but untreated media. Importantly, no growth inhibition was observed in human epithelial MCF-10A cells when grown in either treated or untreated media. Also, mitotic spindle formation was inhibited in the human breast carcinoma when they were grown in dc-DEP EMF force treated media. To determine if any gene expression changes contributed to the selective growth inhibition and absent mitotic spindle formation in the human breast carcinoma grown in the treated media, we employed microarray analysis and found that there was large-scale transcriptional reprogramming of the tumor cells grown in the treated media with over 1,000 genes up- or down-regulated over 2-fold, whereas the non-cancerous MCF-10A cells showed relatively modest changes in gene expression. Of the genes affected in the MDA-MB-231 cells, the significance of down-regulation of HMMR is discussed. The ability to enhance cell polarity through the application of this dc-DEP EMF force may offer another way to stabilize HMMR and differentially modulate its expression in cancerous and noncancerous cells. ...
