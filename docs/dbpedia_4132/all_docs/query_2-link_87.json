        "text": "Ground-breaking work on the role of genes in programmed “cell suicide” has won three researchers the 2002 Nobel Prize in Medicine. The research led to a new understanding of how animals develop and of diseases ranging from cancer to strokes to AIDS.\n\nJohn Sulston of the Sanger Institute, UK, Sydney Brenner, a UK national working at the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley, US, and H. Robert Horvitz, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, will share the &dollar;1 million prize. “The discoveries have shed new light on the pathogenesis of many diseases,” the Nobel jury said.\n\nAll three researchers have been awarded for work based on the millimetre-long nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans. While working at Cambridge University, UK, in the early 1960s, Sydney Brenner established C. elegans as an experimental model organism for investigating cell division and organ development.\n\nHe demonstrated that specific gene mutations could be induced in the millimetre-long worm and linked to specific effects on organ development.\n\nSculpting the body\n\nIn 1969, John Sulston joined Brenner at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge to work on C. elegans. He studied the development of part of the nematode’s nervous system and discovered that certain cells always underwent programmed cell death – apoptosis – as the nervous system formed.\n\nSulston realised that the loss of cells was key to how organs and other body parts are shaped in the developing worm. He went on to identify the first mutation of a gene involved in this cell death process. More recently, Sulston achieved international fame as the joint leader of the publicly-funded Human Genome Project.\n\nRobert Horvitz joined Brenner’s team in 1974. He went on to discover and characterise key genes controlling cell death in C. elegans, the first two described in 1986. He also showed how these genes interact in that process and showed that corresponding genes exist in people.\n\n“For Michaelangelo to sculpt David out of a block of rock, he had to destroy large quantities of rock, It’s the same with organ development – it’s the cell death that does it as much as anything else,” geneticist Steven Jones at University College London told New Scientist.\n\n“And it’s the discovery of these genes that switch themselves on at the appropriate time – causing programmed cell death – for which these guys are being honoured,” he says.\n\nUnderstanding disease\n\nUnderstanding apoptosis is also key to unravelling aspects of AIDS and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Both disorders involve accelerated programmed cell death. In cancer, normal cell death is also disrupted. But rather than committing suicide, the damaged cells continue to grow and multiply.\n\nHonouring this basic research on apoptosis is “extremely appropriate,” says Jones – the only surprise is that none of the winners have received a Nobel prize before. “Brenner in particular was right in at the absolute foundations of molecular biology – he was involved in discovering mRNA, for example,” says Jones.\n\nC. elegans was the first organism to have its genome fully sequenced, under the joint-direction of John Sulston. Mike Dexter, director of the UK Wellcome Trust says&colon; “Sir John’s C. elegans work inspired a new era in scientific research, and the sequencing of its genome was the spark that initiated the international Human Genome Project.”\n\nFundamental research\n\nSulston says&colon; “It’s tremendously exciting for me because once again it reinforces the power of fundamental research. Our work on C. elegans emphasized the benefits of sharing large amounts of information. We took a global approach to discover the mechanisms that led to the development of the worm.\n\n“The same is true for genomics. When results are shared freely amongst the biological community, as has been done for the worm and the Human Genome Projects, specialist scientists can move much more rapidly towards their goals.”\n\nThe three winners will receive their award at a ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December. Other recipients of 2002 Nobel prizes will be announced later this week."
