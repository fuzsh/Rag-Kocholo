        "text": "Nobel winner H. Robert Horvitz will talk to Quincy High School students about his scientific career and the Nobel Prize next Thursday.\n\nAlong with Sydney Brenner and John Sulston, Horvitz won the 2002 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work on programmed cell death (apoptosis), and his studies concerning organ development in the C. elegans roundworm.\n\nHis work in this field may lead to a better understanding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease.\n\nThrough his research, Horvitz identified a gene involved in the inherited form of ALS, a disease that took his father's life in 1989.\n\n‘‘My hope is that my discoveries will one day lead to advances in medicine that alleviate human suffering and contribute to the world in ways that will benefit mankind,’’ Horvitz has said.\n\nHorvitz earned bachelor's degrees in mathematics and economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and went on to get a master’s degree and later a doctorate in biology from Harvard University.\n\nHe later became a postdoctoral researcher at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England.\n\nHorvitz eventually returned to his alma mater, MIT, as a faculty member in 1978, before becoming a professor of biology in 1986 and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1988.\n\nCurrently, he is a a member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, and of the MIT Center for Cancer Research.\n\nBefore the lecture, a meet-and-greet session for city officials and school personnel will be held in Quincy High’s Presidents Café. Attendees will return to the restaurant for post-lecture refreshments.\n\nReach Daniel McCready at dmccready@ledger.com."
