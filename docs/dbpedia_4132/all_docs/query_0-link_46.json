        "text": "AKA Howard Robert Horvitz\n\nBorn: 8-May-1947\n\nBirthplace: Chicago, IL\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Jewish\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Scientist\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Genetic regulation of organ development\n\nIn ninth grade H. Robert Horvitz commandeered his family's spare bathroom to breed Drosophila (fruit flies), replicating Gregor Mendel's experiments into heredity for a high school science project. During his college years he worked for IBM every summer -- the first year as an office flunky, but thereafter as a programmer and teaching programmers. He majored in mathematics and economics at MIT, where he edited the school paper and was elected student body president.\n\nIn the 1970s, studying cell death (apoptosis), Horvitz showed that in many cases cell death is not brought on by damage or disease, but because the cell has enacted an endogenous procedure of suicide. Normal, healthy cells sometimes trigger their own deaths, and Horvitz showed that this is a normal process, necessary for removing unnecessary or damaged cells. Along with Sydney Brenner and John E. Sulston, Horvitz was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2002.\n\nHis wife, Martha Constantine-Paton, is a biology professor at MIT. His sister, Carol Horvitz, is a biology professor at the University of Miami in Florida.\n\nFather: Oscar Freedom Horvitz (GAO accountant, b. 3-Nov-1918, d. 1989 Lou Gehrig's disease)\n\nMother: Mary R.
