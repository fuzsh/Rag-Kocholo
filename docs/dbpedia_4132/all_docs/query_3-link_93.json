        "text": "Louis J. Horvitz is one of the most accomplished and prolific directors in the rarified, Top-Gun field of live television event broadcasting. He has directed one of the most-watched television programs: \"The Annual Academy Awards\" telecast a record 12 times.\n\nAlong with his twenty nominations, he has won seven Emmys for consistently turning out seamless and elegant work under pressure. In addition to his many years directing \"The Academy Awards\", he has also helmed the \"Primetime Emmy Awards\" a total of 17 times, the \"The Kennedy Center Honors\" for 22 years and the \"American Film Institute (AFI) Life Achievement Award\" tributes a total of 31 times.\n\nIn 2008, Horvitz moved from the Oscars to NBC's \"Golden Globe Awards\" directing it for the past 10 years. Additionally, he proudly added CBS' \"The Grammy Awards\" to his stable of programs and is on his ninth year running.\n\nTwo other events that have given Horvitz great pride were the live, multi-network \"Stand Up 2 Cancer\" and the Canadian \"XXI Winter Olympics Opening and Closing Ceremonies\" held in Vancouver, Canada. The televised ceremonies for CTV Canada were the highest-rated programs in Canadian history. Over 92 per cent of the population of Canada tuned in to view the Olympic Ceremonies.\n\nHorvitz has been the Executive Producer and Director for 14 years of \"The UNCF: An Evening of Stars\", which benefits The 39 Historical Black Universities and Colleges. In addition to his multiple Emmy wins, he was honored with three prestigious NAACP Image Awards for \"An Evening of Stars\" awarded for his tributes to Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson and Lionel Richie. He is also the recipient of multiple Directors' Guild of America (DGA) Award nominations and wins.\n\nIn a career that has spanned over four decades, Horvitz has directed numerous other high-profile programs including \"The American Music Awards,\" \"Fashion Rocks,\" \"The MTV Video Music Awards,\" \"VH1 Hip Hop Honors,\" \"VH1 Divas,\" \"Kids Inaugural: We Are The Future\" for President Barack Obama and First Lady Michele Obama, \"VH1 Concert for New York City\" benefiting survivors of 9/11, the \"U2 Half-Time at the Super Bowl XXXVI,\" \"Paul Simon in Central Park,\" \"The Rolling Stones Steel Wheels Tour,\" \"Live Aid\" and the landmark musical variety series, \"Solid Gold.\"\n\nIn late 2016, Horvitz was selected and honored to direct the Smithsonian/ABC's \"Taking the Stage: African American Music and Stories That Changed America\", a star-studded event celebrating the contributions of African-Americans in American culture and history. Taking place at the prestigious Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., the event was attended by President Barack Obama and the last surviving members of the Tuskegee Airmen of WWII, among others.\n\nIn 2017, he directed the Golden Globe Awards, The 59th Annual Grammy Awards, The iHeart Radio Music Awards, The AFI Life Achievement Award: A Tribute To Dianne Keaton, Def Comedy Jam 25th Anniversary Special for Netflix, The Halo Awards for Viacom, Inc., the Golden Globes 75th Anniversary Special, the Hand In Hand: Benefit for Hurricane Relief that raised over fifty million dollars for the victims of Harvey, Irma, and Puerto Rico hurricane devastation, and GRAMMY's Greatest Stories: A 60th Anniversary Special.\n\nTo date in 2018, he has directed The 75th Golden Globes, The 60th Grammy Awards at Madison Square Garden, the iHeartRadio Music Awards, the return of the 2018 Billboard Awards to NBC and the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award to George Clooney on TNT. Later this year Horvitz is slated to direct a complete update of the long running People's Choice Awards for E! Entertainment.\n\nHorvitz is an ardent advocate of automobile historical preservation as a member of the Petersen Museum, Packards International, MBUSA, Scuderia Ferrari, The Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the Smithsonian Automobile Museum, Washington D.C. and many other \"youth at risk\" automobile training programs.\n\nA native of Los Angeles California, Horvitz is a graduate of Theater, Film and Television, from the University of California at Los Angeles."
