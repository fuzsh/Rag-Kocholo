        "text": "An American and two Britons won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine yesterday for their discoveries of how healthy cells are instructed to kill themselves.\n\nThe discoveries, made largely in studies of a tiny worm, involved a process called programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which is necessary for proper tissue and organ development but also plays a role in many diseases.\n\nThe winners are Sydney Brenner, 75, a British citizen who founded the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley, Calif., and who is a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego; H. Robert Horvitz, 55, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator; and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, England.\n\nThe three, who worked together in Cambridge, England, in the 1970's, will share a $1 million prize. The prize honors their collective work, in the last 30 years, on C. elegans, a 1-millimeter soil worm or nematode.\n\nThe investigations of programmed cell death have given scientists better insights into cancer and the way some viruses and bacteria invade human cells, according to the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which selected the winners. The body uses cell suicide in immune cell development and function, and for removing unnecessary or damaged cells.\n\nMalfunction of cell-death genes is a hallmark of a number of diseases. For example, in AIDS, heart attacks, stroke and degenerative diseases of the central nervous system, cells are lost from excessive apoptosis, the institute said in its citation.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
