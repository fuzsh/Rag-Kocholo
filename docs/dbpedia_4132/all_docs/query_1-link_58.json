        "text": "H. Robert Horvitz became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology at M.I.T. in 1978 and Professor in 1986. He was appointed an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1988.\n\nHorvitz received S.B. degrees in Mathematics and in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) in 1968. He performed his graduate studies at Harvard University in the laboratories of Drs. James Watson and Walter Gilbert and received his Ph.D. in 1974 for his biochemical and genetic analyses of modifications of the E. coli RNA polymerase induced by bacteriophage T4. Dr Horvitz then joined Dr Sydney Brenner at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, and there began his studies of the development and behavior of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans."
