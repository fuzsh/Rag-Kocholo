        "text": "Nobel Laureate Professor Sydney Brenner delivered the UCL Prize Lecture in Clinical Science in October 2003.\n\nOne of the leading scientists in molecular biology of the last century, he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2002 alongside H Robert Horvitz and John E Sulston \"for their discoveries concerning genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death\".\n\nDr Brenner's lecture, Humanity's Genes, was a riveting exploration of current approaches to exploitation of our knowledge of the human genome, and future directions in research and social intervention.\n\nNow in its seventh year, the annual prize lecture series has fast become one of the most eminent series on contemporary science in Europe. The impressive list of past winners includes distinguished scientific figures such as Nobel Laureates Professor Joseph Goldstein, Professor Stanley Prusiner and Professor James Watson."
