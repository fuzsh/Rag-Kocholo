        "text": "Last month, Sydney Brenner passed away at the age of 92. Brenner was a driving force in the founding of the what we think of as modern genetics and molecular biology. His list of accomplishments is stunning, as he often seemed to achieve a significant breakthrough and then move on to the next challenge — “I think my real skills are getting things started,” as he said in his autobiography.\n\nBrenner’s experiments led to our understanding of how DNA is transcribed and translated into proteins, he proved the triplet nature of the genetic code, and discovered messenger RNA. If that wasn’t enough, in the early 1960s he pioneered the use of the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans as a model experimental system which has led to so much of our understanding of genetics and development (Brenner, along with H. Robert Horvitz, and John Sulston, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work in 2002).\n\nThis breadth of achievement speaks to a different world of research than the one we live in now which seems to require specialization and focus (knowing more and more about less and less, as it were). Brenner was also affectionately known as “Uncle Syd” for his columns in Current Biology where he offered advice to graduate students as they climbed the ladder through different stages of their careers."
