        "text": "Conway was born in Hillston, New South Wales, the outback country of Australia, in 1934. She left the family's vast sheep ranch to follow her scholarly interest in history, her natural curiosity to see the world and her dreams of becoming a successful independent woman. In her best-selling memoir, The Road from Coorain, she recounts how she progressed from the plains of Australia to graduate study at Harvard University.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Sydney with a degree in history and English in 1958, she discovered that there were few opportunities for women scholars in Australia. In 1960, she moved to the United States. In her 1994 memoir, True North, she narrates her life as a graduate student in history at Harvard experiencing culture shock, exhilaration at the joy of studying with gifted, dedicated professors and a compassionate concern for the education of women. Upon completion of her Ph.D. from Harvard in February 1969, she joined the faculty at the University of Toronto and served as its vice president of internal affairs from 1973 to 1975.\n\nIn 1975, she was named the first woman president of Smith College and served for ten years in that post. Since 1985 she has been a visiting scholar and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's program in Science, Technology and Society.\n\nA naturalized citizen, Dr. Conway is active in the corporate world. She serves as chairman of the board of Lend Lease Corp. International, chairman of the board of the Kresge Foundation, vice chairman of the Knight Foundation and a director of a number of major companies, including Merrill Lynch, Colgate-Palmolive and Nike.\n\nShe holds 32 honorary doctorates from colleges and universities in the United States and Canada. In addition, she has authored seven books, including three volumes of anthology of women's autobiography from around the world, the most recent titled, In Her Own Words, and has contributed to numerous periodicals.\n\nDr. Conway was married to the late John J. Conway, Canadian war hero and professor of British history at Harvard. She resides in Boston.\n\nAkron Roundtable is open to the public. Tickets for the luncheon and program are $10.00. For reservations and information, call 836-7275."
