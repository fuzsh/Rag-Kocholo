        "text": "Many New South Wales residents have been named on this year's Queens Birthday Honours list, including an author and advocate for the eradication of blindness.\n\nGabi Hollows\n\nGabi Hollows, the widow of acclaimed eye surgeon Fred Hollows, has received the Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for her work as an advocate for the eradication of blindness.\n\nIn 1992 she helped her late husband set up The Fred Hollows Foundation, which works to give the gift of sight to the world's poor.\n\n\"A smile is just such an amazing thing. And to think that some of those people can now smile because they can see you, that gives me that sort of charge,\" she told the ABC in 2008 <http://www.abc.net.au/tv/talkingheads/txt/s2269875.htm>.\n\n\"But that's what powers up my batteries. That's the joy that I have and that keeps me going. It's just so... That's my rocket fuel, I suppose.\"\n\nThe 60-year-old, who was born in NSW, has also worked closely with Australia's Indigenous communities.\n\nShe is one of Australia's 100 Living Treasures and has previously been recognised for her work through an Advance Australia Award for Community Service and a Paul Harris Fellowship from Rotary International.\n\nJill Ker Conway\n\nThe Australian - American author and Time Magazine woman of the year Jill Ker Conway has received a top Queen's Birthday honour from her native country.\n\nProfessor Conway has been named a Companion in the Order of Australia, for her service to the community, particularly to women.\n\nShe is the author of more than 20 books including the best selling memoir The Road from Coorain.\n\nThe book follows her journey from being a sheep farmer's daughter in Hillston, NSW, to the president of the prestigious Smith College in the US.\n\nSpeaking from the US, Professor Conway says her upbringing on a sheep station in western New South Wales helped shaped the direction her life would take.\n\n\"It gave me a great longing to understand more about the settlement of Australia and the roots of the really extraordinary, small society that I was growing up in,\" she said.\n\nProfessor Conway has been granted honorary degrees from 35 universities worldwide, including Sydney University.\n\nShe admits the honour took her by surprise, especially given that she has lived in America for decades.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it, because I really thought that somebody like me, who has lived outside Australia for many years, although I'm always back there seeing my family, wouldn't be eligible,\" she told ABC News 24.\n\nPolice recognised\n\nA number of New South Wales police officers have been recognised in this year's Queens Birthday honours list.\n\nA total of eight officers have been awarded with a special medal in the honours list.\n\nThe officers work throughout the state and have contributed many years to the police force.\n\nAmong them is Police Superintendent Mark Walton, who has been honoured for almost 40 years service.\n\nHe is the area commander for Sydney's CBD where more than three quarters of a million people visit daily.\n\nSuperintendent Walton says the biggest problem in the area is alcohol.\n\n\"The city is a very safe place overall unfortunately we're drawn into a lot of alcohol related violence on a Friday and Saturday night,\" he said.\n\n\"That really is a problem for us to deal with in town but as I said the city is a very safe place, there's around a million people often there.\"\n\nAlso included is Detective Senior Sergeant Roslyn Keys, who is the first female officer to be appointed to a criminal investigative position at the armed holdup squad in southern Sydney.\n\nSenior Constable Imants Ramma has spent more than 40 years patrolling the highways around Tenterfield in northern New South Wales.\n\nHis youngest son was killed more than a decade ago in a car accident on the New England Highway, but he has refused a transfer and continues to patrol it.\n\nDr David Sheen\n\nA Sydney dentist has been honoured for his work in developing countries.\n\nDr David Sheen has received an AM for significant service to dentistry and has practiced in Papua New Guinea and East Timor during his career.\n\nHe says working overseas was very fulfilling.\n\n\"We are so well off despite what we hear, \" he said.\n\n\"And you only have to jump in a plane and fly to East Timor or Papua New Guinea and you're in a situation where we have so much and they have so little and I just feel that this is a simple way of us doing something about the disparity.\"\n\nTerry Cummins\n\nA scuba diving expert who lives more than 400-kilometres from the ocean has been recognised in the Queen's Birthday honours.\n\nTerry Cummins from Condobolin in western New South Wales has received an Order of Australia for services to scuba diving.\n\nHe has been working in the sport for more than 40 years and helped introduce standards which indicate a diver's level of training.\n\nMr Cummins says he gets back to the coast whenever he can.\n\n\"I'm kind of proud that I've played a role in that in getting you know standards established right across the world,\" he said.\n\n\"To make sure when scuba divers are actually diving they are aware of the problems and issues associated with the sport.\"\n\nBrian Friend\n\nA former police officer's contribution to touch football has been recognised in the Queen's Birthday honours.\n\nBrian Friend has received an Order of Australia for services to the sport and the community of Manly Warringah on Sydney's northern beaches.\n\nHe introduced touch football to Australia and says the award is for everyone who helped.\n\n\"It's not for me this award. This award is for a lot of other people who've assisted me,\" he said.\n\n\"People who come and help, they put their hands up and I suppose there's got to be a figurehead but this is for a lot of other people.\""
