        "text": "Bob Elliott was half of the comedy team Bob and Ray; his son Chris appears regularly on the Late Show with David Letterman. They've written a joint memoir called Daddy's Boy, in which Chris recounts a childhood memory, and Bob offers his rebuttal.\n\nSome people bemoan the use of computer language to describe human behavior. But linguist Geoff Nunberg says the trend works both ways: we often discuss technology in anthropomorphic terms -- but only when it malfunctions.\n\nHistorian Jill Ker Conway. She's the author of the bestselling memoir, \"The Road from Coorain,\" about growing up in the Australian outback. Conway also edited two volumes of women's memoirs \"Written By Herself\" (Volumes I and II) which were, in part, about the nature of autobiography written by women. Her new book is \"When Memory Speaks: Reflections on Autobiography.\" (Knopf) Conway was the first female vice president of The University of Toronto, and from 1975 to 1985 was the president of Smith.\n\nConway grew up in a remote sheep station in the Australian outback, and later became the president of Smith College. Her girlhood memoir, \"The Road from Coorain,\" was a bestseller, In her new book, \"True North,\" she continues her story, writing about organizing for women's rights on campus, and creating a marriage in which she and her husband are equal partners. Conway was the first female vice president of The University of Toronto, and from 1975 to 1985 was the president of Smith.\n\nActivist Greg Mortenson is the founder and Executive Director of the Central Asia Institute. Since 1993, the organization has opened schools and provided an education for over 4000 girls in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
