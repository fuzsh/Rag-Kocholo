        "text": "NORTHAMPTON - A public memorial service is being held Oct. 18 for former Smith College President Jill Ker Conway who died in Boston in June. She would have turned 84 on Oct. 9.\n\nThe service for the Australian-born Conway, who became the college's first woman president at the age of 40 in 1975, begins at 4 p.m. in Helen Hills Hills Chapel, 123 Elm St.\n\nConway, who held a doctorate in history from Harvard University, was regarded as an innovator and successful fund-raiser during her years at Smith, and in retirement became a best-selling author, member of Nike's board of trustees where she chaired the committee on corporate responsibility that she suggested, and worked to address homelessness, particularly among veterans.\n\nHer husband, John J. Conway, whom she had met at Harvard, served in the Canadian infantry in World War II, and had his right hand blown off by a grenade. He died in 1995.\n\nIn her 1989 memoir, \"The Road From Coorain,\" the first of a trio, Conway wrote about growing up on a 32,000 sheep farm in Australia, going onto university where she study American women reformers from the Progressive Era like Jane Addams, and then entering a world where women were not really expected to stay long-term in the workforce.\n\nThe PBS program \"Masterpiece Theater\" used \"The Road From Coorain\" as the basis for a film in 2002.\n\nConway, who was named one of Time Magazine's Women of the Year in 1975, dedicated much of her career to creating programs and courses to help women advance and to help women - and society - expand perceptions of women's capabilities.\n\nShe came to Smith from the University of Toronto, where she served as that university's first female vice-president and successfully lobbied for equality in terms of pay and tenure.\n\nSusan C. Bourque, a former provost and dean of the faculty at Smith, told an interviewer that Conway's appointment at the women's college at the time \"absolutely electrified the campus.\"\n\n\"Here was this vibrant young woman, enormously attractive, who had just been appointed as the first woman in Smith's history. You could just feel the new history that had come,\" Bourque said."
