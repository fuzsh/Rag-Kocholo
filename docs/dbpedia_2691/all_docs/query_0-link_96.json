        "text": "Stevenson's maternal balancing act is entirely appropriate. Motherhood is at the heart of The Road from Coorain, even more so in this TV adaptation than in the Ker Conway autobiography on which it is based.\n\n\"There is a lot in the book, but the story we wanted to tell is of these two women,\" says Chapman. \"Our focus is this very interesting, very smart woman who wants the best for a daughter she recognises as very bright, but who is also a woman so stoic that she broke under the tragedy.\"\n\nHere, Stevenson's Eve is not only tough, she's domineering and ruthless, forbidding her children from displays of emotion or admissions of weakness. Eve is a woman who refuses to bend or compromise, with disastrous results. It's a less-than-flattering depiction and has stirred up a controversy that now swirls around the production like a Riverina dust storm. After buying the rights to the story four years ago, Chapman was keen to enlist the support and blessing of Ker Conway, who is now 68. So Chapman sent scripts to Boston, and Ker Conway responded with amicable comments and suggestions.\n\nLast year, though, the relationship curdled. After belatedly reading the script's final draft, Ker Conway fired off a memo to the ABC via a Boston legal firm. \"Ms Conway does not wish to be associated in any manner with the film,\" said the memo. Moreover, she would do nothing \"that might tend to be associated in the public mind with the release or promotion of the film.\" Meaning, among other things, Ker Conway would certainly not be doing any interviews to promote the movie adaptation of her life.\n\nOn the set of The Road from Coorain last autumn, of course, there was no inkling of the storm brewing beyond the horizon. Quite the reverse, in fact. After two weeks of trouble-free shooting in and around the small, picturesque town of Wentworth, at the confluence of the Darling and Murray Rivers in the south-west of New South Wales, the production moved for four weeks to locations in the Sydney suburbs of Balmain and Bayview.\n\nThen, in late April, the drama relocated to a beautiful, stately old home in Sydney's Burwood. \"After Jill's father died, the family tried to struggle on,\" says Chapman. \"But finally Eve made a decision to put on a manager and come to the city, where she worked very, very hard to keep the wolf from the door. After she restored the family fortune, this is meant to be the house she built at Pennant Hills for the family.\"\n\nAt lunch, while Stevenson retires to her trailer to be with her son, Maher is ploughing hastily through a plate of food. \"This isn't really very different to SeaChange,\" the director says. \"Your task is the same, to realise a text and do it the best way you can. And here Sue Smith's screenplay is the most faithful script I'd read for a long, long time. Her vision is so clear and so clearly stated, I just wanted to make sure we didn't bugger it up.\"\n\nTo this end, Smith sits nearby, ready and poised to answer Maher's questions and, if necessary, make last-minute changes. She's there by invitation, which is unusual. Usually a writer finishes scribbling and that's it; he or she simply lets go of the project. Or tries to, anyway.\n\n\"This is the best collaboration I've had by a country mile,\" says Smith, whose credits include Brides of Christ, The Leaving of Liverpool and My Brother Jack. \"Because of the way Penny and Brendan have run this, the cast have always felt free to ask me questions. I even went to rehearsals where actors were able to talk directly to me, and I was able to say 'I don't know' rather than just having Brendan say 'I don't know.'\"\n\nChapman laughs. \"She's not just a visiting writer, she's part of the gang.\"\n\nTwo years ago, Smith delivered the script and, armed with it, Chapman, Maher and a casting agent started looking for a cast to do it justice. \"Brendan and I spent months and months casting this,\" says Chapman.\n\nStevenson was the key, an actress important enough to delay production for, but equally important was the role of Jill. Or rather, the three roles of Jill: at age five, 11 and in her early 20s. After much searching, the team found a young actress, Katherine Slattery, in a graduation performance in Melbourne to play the twenty-something Jill (she has since appeared in Changi). Only then were two suitable younger girls sought and found. All three ultimately turn in rounded, compelling performances.\n\nThen Richard Roxburgh was slotted in as Jill's father, alongside a supporting cast featuring John Howard, Felix Williamson and American Tim Guinee. \"Richard Roxburgh is such a wonderful screen and stage actor,\" says Chapman. \"And here I think he has turned in his best screen performance since Blue Murder.\"\n\nRoxburgh, whose extensive credits include a memorable supporting role in Moulin Rouge, says he savoured the role. \"It was something of a homecoming for me to play a character like Bill. He was a lot like the men I grew up with. And I've never touched on something so close to my experience before.\"\n\nThe result is a gripping, beautiful film that avoids cliche and presents a fresh view of life in the middle of last century, both on the land and in town. With the help of director of photography Tristan Milani (The Boys, The Bank), the angles and hues are particularly stunning, from the sweeping saltbush plains of the Riverina to the streets of central Sydney.\n\nThe Road from Coorain looks a million bucks. Maybe even 10 million bucks, although Chapman isn't prepared to reveal the budget. Finance was provided by the ABC, Boston's WGBH network, the Film Finance Corporation and the NSW Film and Television Office.\n\n\"Gone are the days when the ABC could have single-handedly funded something like this,\" says Roxburgh sadly. \"That's a terrible shame for everybody, especially rural Australians, that a story that's so representative of, and important to, the history of rural Australia can't be singly sponsored by the national broadcaster. I worked on Blue Murder, and that was one of the last. Those days are gone and actors mourn it, because it's a part of our cultural identity and history that is gone.\"\n\nRoxburgh is right: The Road from Coorain is a quintessentially Australian story about a family struggling to survive in a beautiful, petulant land. They face dust, drought and death. The landscape itself is one of the story's central characters, being what first impressed Smith while reading Ker Conway's book. \"I was interested in the themes of nurture and destruction, in how the relationship with the land is played out between the characters.\"\n\nThe book is subtle and measured, and much of its action is internal, befitting Ker Conway's isolated, introverted childhood. The film is subtle and measured, too, but considerably less internal.\n\n\"If we were going to make this work, what we had to do was appreciate the fact that the book is a wonderful autobiography and a beautiful book, but that it's not in and of itself essentially dramatic\" says Chapman. \"So a lot of the phenomena that Jill describes in the book had to be dramatised as an event.\"\n\nChapman says it can be a mistake for a movie adaptation to be too faithful to its source. \"That can be damning, even to the meaning of the book. If you look at some of the great English screen adaptors, their language is completely different to the language of Austen or Thackeray of Dickens. In order to make this book full of fascinating ideas meaningful to a contemporary audience we felt we needed to dramatise it and narrow the focus.\"\n\nSmith admits that while she has adapted several novels, Coorain is the first memoir. \"That's difficult because real life doesn't conform to the rules of a drama, so you have to shape real events in order to create dramatic arguments. We had to junk a whole section of the book, and also enlarge some characters and reduce others, as you would in any adaptation.\"\n\nAnd those changes caused all the trouble. For Ker Conway, her mother Eve had changed somewhere on her journey from page to screen, metamorphosing from the character she had known, loved and described into someone entirely less palatable.\n\nBut Chapman loves the character of Eve, too, and sees her as an emblem of her time.\n\n\"I look at people of my mother's generation people who are bright, ambitious, articulate, energetic; all women who later could have had an education which would have given them an opportunity to do something entirely different with their lives and I wonder how much they went on to regret.\n\n\"Such a tremendous and complex social change happened with the women's movement in the '60s, and that whole generational difference is really fascinating. I'm really interested in the relationship interesting women have with their mothers. Motherhood is just such a mighty powerful vocation.\"\n\nChapman is talking about tensions of 50 years ago, but they are equally relevant today: tensions between mothers and daughters, between nurturing and stifling, between the desire to have children and have a career. The Road from Coorain is rich with those tensions."
