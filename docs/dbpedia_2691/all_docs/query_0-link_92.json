Meanwhile, others do the dirty work and suffer the consequences of all that “overwhelming.” This illustrated talk, inspired by the richly nuanced, if obscene, MFword, considers the gendered, raced and sexually violent concept of the Anthropocenein dialogue with the ancient one of Mother Earth, newly discernible as the cunctipotent, autonomous and formidable Earth Mutha’.\n\nJane Caputi is Professor of Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Florida Atlantic University.

Irene Monroe\n\nSeptember 16, 2013\n\nHow can we improve gender climate at JMU? Many of us experience gendered microaggressions in our work world but we aren’t sure how to respond.

Williams\n\nSeptember 3, 2012\n\nWhy can’t a woman be more like a man? Thirty-five years of social science show that women may encounter pushback when they do the same things men do.

Susan Douglas has penned a brilliant -- and often funny -- critique of the myths about equality, ambition, and femininity that are currently being served up as 'reality' in our media-crazed culture. She challenges those who insist that feminism is outmoded, that strong women are scary and\n\nunlovable, and that 'real' girl power comes from Botox, a bustier, and the ability to poledance in a pair of size-two hot pants. Best yet, Enlightened Sexism offers an antidote to the contradictory messages and predicaments many women experience today. It’s a call to action and an inspiration.\" Douglas is also author of Listening In, Where the Girls Are and co-author of the The Mommy Myth. Audience members will have an opportunity to peak with Douglas at the book signing and reception to follow the lecture.\n\nDr. Susan Douglas is the Catherine Neafie Kellogg Professor of Communication Studies at The University of Michigan.\n\nJill Ker Conway\n\nApril 2, 2008\n\nJill Ker Conway was born in Hillston, New South Wales.
