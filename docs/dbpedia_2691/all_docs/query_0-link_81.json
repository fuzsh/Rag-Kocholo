        "text": "A Character Dramatization of Jill Ker Conway\n\nBy Carol Smith Headrick\n\nOn Thursday, May 22, P.E.O. Chapter GI in Owasso will sponsor its 6th Annual Dramatic Presentation at the Owasso Community Center, 301 S. Cedar, from 6:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.\n\nThis year, Chapter GI proudly presents Carol Headrick’s character dramatization of Jill Ker Conway based on the book, “A Woman’s Education.” Ms. Headrick will bring to life the story of Jill Ker Conway, the first woman president of Smith College.\n\nJill Ker Conway was born in Hillston, New South Wales, Australia, graduated from the University of Sydney in 1958, and received her Ph.D from Harvard University in 1969. From 1964 to 1975 she taught at the University of Toronto, where she was also Vice President, before going to Smith College. Since 1985 she has been a visiting scholar and professor in MIT’s Program in Science, Technology, and Society. She serves on the boards of Nike, Merrill Lynch, and Colgate-Palmolive, and as Chairman of Lend Lease Corporation. She lives in Boston.\n\nPlease join us for a fun and entertaining evening as Ms. Headrick presents the life of Jill Ker Conway. Proceeds of this fundraiser will support P.E.O. projects and philanthropies, including grants and scholarships for women pursuing educational opportunities.\n\nTickets are only $10 each and include the dramatization and refreshments. For more information and to purchase tickets, please contact Patti Horner at 918-272-7922 or Pat Vanatta at 918-272-6030."
