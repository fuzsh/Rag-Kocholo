More about Aselin and album

Aselin new alum (Sweet is the melody) will be released September 24, 2002 in Canada and October 8, 2002 in USA. I don't no about you but I'm getting it the first day of its release.

If you want to see more about her CD check out her offical website at http://www.aselin.com there you can hear a demo of her first single called sweet is the melody and watch the video on how she made he album. I think her CD is going to be great and that aselin will be a big star.
