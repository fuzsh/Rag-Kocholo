Become a better singer in 30 days with these videos!\n\nA poor orphan girl named Maria Was walking the market one day She stopped for to rest by the road side Where a bird with a broken wing laid A few moments passed till she saw it For it's feathers were covered with sand And soon clean and rapped it was traveling In the warmth of Maria's small hand She happily gave her last paso Of a cage made of freshes and twine She fed it loose corn from the market Watched it grow stronger with time Now the gift giving service was coming And the chruch arm with tinsel and light An' all of the town folk brought presents To lay by the manger that night There were diamonds, incents and perfumes And packages fit for a king But for one raged bird in his small cage Maria had nothing to bring She waited till just before midnight So no one would see her go in And crying she knelt be the manger For her gift was unworthy of him Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness Maria what brings you to me If the bird in the cage is your offering Open the door let me see So she trembled she did as he asked her An' out of the cage the bird flew Soaring up into the rafters On a wing that would feel good just new An' just as the midnight bells rang out And the little bird started to sing A song that no words could recapture For its beauty was fit for a king Now Maria felt blessed just to listen To the cascade a note sweet and long As her offering was lifted to heaven By the very first night in Gales song\n\nStruggling with The Gift? Become a better singer in 30 days with these videos!"
