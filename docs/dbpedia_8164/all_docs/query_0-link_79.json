        "text": "Bigger Than Me\n\n(SonyBMG)\n\nThis is a strange disc, schizophrenic even. Upon first listen it sounds like Aselin is a fan of Liz Phair. It may be her voice, her style, the occasional spare guitar but more likely it is all of this mixed with simple songs tackling love, heartbreak, youth and surviving being a girl. Unfortunately this disc ends up exactly as expected: mediocre pop that sounds like everything else on the radio. If Aselin's people had taken a few chances and not polished so hard this could have been something special.\n\nâ€”Colin MacKenzie\n\ncategories: Canadian artist,ECMA nominee (2006)"
