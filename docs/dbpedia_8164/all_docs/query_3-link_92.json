        "text": "published on 2011-05-05T02:56:39Z\n\nAselin Debison is back! After a few short years away from the lime light of the music industry, Cape Bretonâs Aselin Debison is back with a new recording for summer 2010; âHomeward Boundâ! The first single from the new recording is the Gordie Sampson, Chris Lindsey, Aimee Mayo co-written, âClose to Youâ, which is immediately infectious and compels listeners to sing along with the chorus. âHomeward Boundâ brings Aselin Debison and her sound back to her roots in folk/roots based country tinged music. Songs with meaning that tell a story.\n\nGenre\n\nCountry/Pop"
