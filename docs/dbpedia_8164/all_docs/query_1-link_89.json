He passed on worried and warning, Carried away by a moonlight shadow. Lost in a riddle that Saturday night, Far away on the other side. He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight And she couldn't find how to push through. The trees that whisper in the evening, Carried away by a moonlight shadow. Sing a song of sorrow and grieving, Carried away by a moonlight shadow. All she saw was a silhouette of a gun, Far away on the other side. He was shot six times by a man on the run And she couldn't find how to push through. I stay, I pray See you in heaven far away. I stay, I pray See you in heaven one day. Four a.m. in the morning, Carried away by a moonlight shadow. I watched your vision forming, Carried away by a moonlight shadow. Stars roll slowly in a silvery night, Far away on the other side. Will you come to terms with me this night, But she couldn't find how to push through. I stay, I pray See you in heaven far away. I stay, I pray See you in heaven one day. Far away on the other side. Caught in the middle of a hundred and five. The night was heavy and the air was alive, But she couldn't find how to push through. Carried away by a moonlight shadow. Carried away by a moonlight shadow. Far away on the other side. But she couldn't find how to push through.\n\nThe easy, fast & fun way to learn how to sing: 30DaySinger.com"
