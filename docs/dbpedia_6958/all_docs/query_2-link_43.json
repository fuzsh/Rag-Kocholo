        "text": "A Digital Distributor Gets Physical: INgrooves, a distributor for digital music, is moving into physical sales through a deal with the Universal Music Group to take over Fontana, Universal’s independent arm in North America. Terms were not disclosed.\n\nINgrooves, which was founded in 2002 and has about $45 million in annual sales, already has close ties to Universal, and the companies’ distribution systems will remain linked. Universal, the biggest of the major labels, uses INgrooves’ platform to deliver its music to online retailers like iTunes and Spotify; it has also been an investor in the company, and will retain a small stake.\n\nINgrooves will take over Fontana’s accounts — it handles dozens of indie labels like Fat Possum, Nettwerk and Vagrant, and has about $90 million in revenue — but will be able to use Universal’s local sales forces in selling CDs, vinyl records and other products in brick-and-mortar stores, the companies announced.\n\nThe deal should help INgrooves compete against distributors like the Orchard, which began as a digital shop but gained a physical infrastructure when it acquired TVT Records four years ago. It may also aid Universal in its $1.9 billion takeover of EMI’s recorded music division. Universal and its parent company, Vivendi, pledged to sell more than $650 million in assets to finance the merger, and regulators in Europe and the United States may ask for more divesments before approving the deal."
