        "text": "The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other\n\nStudio album by\n\nVan der Graaf Generator\n\nReleased February 1970\n\nRecorded 11–14 December 1969\n\nStudio Trident, London\n\nGenre Progressive rock\n\nLength 43:50\n\nLabel Charisma (UK)\n\nProbe (US)\n\nProducer John Anthony\n\nSide one\n\n1. \"Darkness (11/11)\" 7:28\n\n2. \"Refugees\" 6:23\n\n3. \"White Hammer\" 8:15\n\nSide

April 1970 single\n\n7. \"Boat of Millions of Years\" 3:50\n\n8. \"Refugees\" 5:24\n\nPeter Hammill – acoustic guitar and lead vocals; piano on \"Refugees\"\n\nDavid Jackson – tenor and alto saxophone, flute and backing vocals\n\nHugh Banton – organ, piano and backing vocals\n\nNic Potter – bass guitar and electric guitar\n\nGuy Evans – Drums and percussion\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nMike Hurwitz – cello on \"Refugees\"\n\nGerry Salisbury – cornet on \"White Hammer\"\n\nProduction\n\nVan der Graaf Generator – arrangements\n\nJohn Anthony – producer\n\nRobin Geoffrey Cable – recording and engineering\n\nThe band's second album was released in February of 1970, and was the band's first album to come out on the Charisma label, after the issues with the debut single and the debut album and the label wrestling and contract issues, the band finally had a home base to work from.\n\nAll the tracks were written by Hammill except for Out Of My Book which is co-credited with David Jackson who comes into the band on the wind instruments, and we do notice a change in the sound somewhat.\n\nThis album also charted at 47 in the UK, which surely would have given the guys a bit of a lift, knowing that people were actually buying the album.\n\nIt is actually the band's only album to crack the top fifty.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this was actually the first album to be released in the UK, if anyone missed that in the previous write up.\n\nIn many ways this could be considered the band's debut album, when the first was supposed to have been released as a Hammill solo album, and only available in the US.\n\nThis time contractual obligations didn't get in the way, and the intention of the album is clear.\n\nRehearsals for the album began in September 1969.\n\nHammill brought the songs to the band as completed tracks that he could play along with, but Banton and Jackson were heavily involved in the arrangements, and the whole band improvised quite a bit together.\n\nBanton had a background as a church organist, and he felt his love for modern French classic music fitted well with Hammill's writing.\n\nThe album was recorded from the eleventh to the fourteenth of December in 1969 at Trident Studios with John Anthony producing.\n\nThe album was recorded on an 8-track reel to reel, except After The Flood which used a 16-track machine.\n\nGuy Evans has said that Producer, Anthony, was a very good organiser, who apparently recognised Hammill's intelligence and artistic capabilities.\n\nThe album was released in February 1970, and Smith, although having been hands off, was unhappy with Anthony's mix, so he called in Shel Talmy to remix it.\n\nThe first pressings of the album are actually Talmy's remix, but the band were unhappy with Talmy's remix, and persuaded Charisma to allow Anthony to mix the album again, and see if they could please both parties.\n\nThe sleeve dedicated the album to \"L & M, without whom everyone would have been much happier\", a criticism of Lou Reizner and Mercury Records.\n\nThe title is taken from artist John Minton: \"We're all awash in a sea of blood, and the least we can do is wave to each other.\"\n\nThe album received favourable reviews\n\nA review in International Times said the album was the best debut since King Crimson's In the Court of the Crimson King, while a reviewer in Time Out said it was \"the strongest thing I've heard in a long time\".\n\nModern reviews\n\nIn the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, the album came #15 in its list of \"40 Cosmic Rock Albums\".\n\nFrançois Couture, reviewing the album in AllMusic, described Hammill's distorted delivery of the word \"Annihilation\" in \"After the Flood\" to be \"one of the scariest moments in the history of British prog rock\".\n\nIn his 1997 History of Progressive Rock, Paul Stump assessed that while the album is harmonically and structurally similar to contemporary progressive rock works by Genesis and Yes, it does contain hints of the more unique work Van der Graaf Generator would later produce, particularly Jackson's \"snaggling, niggling Coltrane-ish saxophone\".\n\nSo having had a chance to listen to this album a couple of times now, I like this quite a bit.\n\nIt is an album I had never even heard of until we decided to give this thread a go.\n\nI can certainly hear influence/inspiration from what we now consider contemporary prog bands, but even so, the band manage to have their own sound.\n\nPart of that seems to come from Hammill's unique vocal delivery, which is an interesting style that generally has good enunciation, not generally common in rock music, and an almost theatrical over the top element that gives the songs a fairly different sound and feel to many of the band's contemporaries.\n\nDarkness (11/11).\n\nThe 11/11 addition to the title of the track came from the song being written November 11 1968.\n\nThe opening sound effects were taken from the BBC archive by Anthony, and give us a suitably eerie intro to the album.\n\nWe get this slow build come into the picture, and some nice hats clicking away.\n\nThe bass sets the feel with a really nice little groove.\n\nThe somewhat whispered vocal is very effective in conveying the idea of darkness.\n\nThe chorus is excellent and really adds a nice flavour to the song.\n\nAgain the descending pattern, until the change, which has an aggressive ominous kind of feel to it.\n\nThe keyboard break, builds nicely, with a sort of held chord and then moves into a nice sort of chordal lead.\n\nI really like the groove of this song, and I wasn't expecting to have much in the way of grooves on this thread. So that's encouraging, and also.\n\nThe drummer is really very good, and I enjoy his style of playing.\n\nThis is an excellent opening to the album, and Jackson's double sax fun.... playing them both at the same time (inspired by Roland Kirk, is really very cool, and gives us another texture to digest.... It makes me wonder if Morphine's Dana Colley drew inspiration from Jackson, or perhaps Kirk himself.... it's a neat party trick, but even better when musically effective, as it is here, and frequently in Morphine also.\n\nRefugees .\n\nAfter the intensity of the opening track we get a much more pastoral opening here.\n\nHammill delivers a falsetto vocal that slides into his regular voice, and it adds to the gentle feel being presented.\n\nJust after about the two minute mark we get a sort of change in feel.\n\nThat seems to be in anticipation of the freedom promised, and the enthusiasm it brings.\n\nThen we move back into the beautiful rolling style of the opening.\n\nThen we move into the change again, and there is a little more intensity this time.\n\nThere is a real tenderness to this track, and going through the catalog like this is helping me to become more comfortable with Hammill's vocals.\n\nWe get a choir of backing vocals that lift up the song a bit more, as the hope and enthusiasm of those looking for a new home grows.... and then we move out of the song with a nice little instrumental section that has the feel of arrival in the new land.\n\nWhite Hammer.\n\nWe open with what feels like Banton's church organ roots, and it works as a sort of mini-overture to the song.\n\nHammill comes in on the vocals and then the song gets a bit more punch, and when one takes into account what the song is about, it makes complete sense.\n\nThis is an historically based ballad, in the true sense of the word, and the music chosen to accompany it is quite interesting in its dynamic change ups.\n\nWe have mellow and smooth.\n\nWe have intense and brash.\n\nWe also get a lovely melodic section that could almost be a pop song of some sort.\n\nAfter a short instrumental section we get a very quiet organ section and then that busts into an aurally violent grind... that verges on heavy metal, just without the predominant guitars.\n\nThen we come to a dramatic dead stop.\n\nWhatever Would Robert Have Said?.\n\nHere we get an ascending organ chord pattern, and the instruments introduce themselves as we move along.... Again, I'm really enjoying the drumming from Guy Evans.\n\nWe get a tacet and the vocal comes in unaccompanied, Hammill singing in likely his lowest register.\n\nGradually the instruments come in, but it stays low key.\n\nThen we end this section with a very cool harmony vocal.\n\nInterestingly the next section starts with a melody guitar, playing a nice distorted melody line while the vocal continues.\n\nI guess it's interesting to me, as I wasn't really expecting much in the way of guitar from what people have said in the earlier part of the thread.... This isn't highly technical or anything, but it is, yet again, a nice textural change.\n\nI like when bands don't lock themselves into rules. Here, even with the option of the wind instruments and keys, we get what I think is the first upfront guitar, particularly in a lead line styling.\n\nAgain the dynamics work really well for me. I like music to give us good dynamics, and these guys are really moving from quiet to loud and volatile in thought provoking ways.\n\nJust before the end we get a really cool acoustic guitar section that somewhat reflects the debut album, and we build to a dramatic finish.\n\nOut Of My Book .\n\nHere we have Hammill and Jackson combining on the writing, and we get a really nice melodic and smooth track that brings another texture to the album.\n\nIt strikes me, at the stage at least, that the guys work really well together, and the group arrangements give everyone space to shine, and accentuate the song's structure well.\n\nThe layers of wind instruments work really well here also.\n\nI suppose to some degree this also reflects the debut a little, reaching back into that late sixties sound and feel.\n\nAfter The Flood.\n\nSo we come to the epic closing track.\n\nWe open with a very cool unison melody/harmony line, and then drop into an acoustic guitar and vocal.\n\nThe change initially comes in like a Gentle Giant type of change, and we get this manic staccato change that is accented really nicely.\n\nThen we change up again, to a melodic section that breaks down into a drone that builds into a percussive section.\n\nA smooth melodic section rolls into the picture.\n\nThen we move into a section that has a kind of baroque folk feel.\n\nRather than follow this line, I'm going to say that we get these ever changing sections linked together to give the feel of the disaster being shared.\n\nMelodic sections interspersed with manic instrumental sections that share a feel, rather than a specific melody.\n\nSome frantic sax playing leads us into a nice mellow acoustic section that builds and dramatically leads to the effected \"Total Annihilation\"\n\nThis could be a science fiction piece, or it could be indirectly an impression of the flood of Noah's days. Either way it manages to capture a lot of different feels that reflect a lot of different emotions that would accompany such an event.\n\nAll this leads to a cool outro piece of music that again has a nice bit of guitar in there.\n\nGiving way to a crossfaded white sound, and finally a silence, for one to ponder all that has gone before.\n\nThis is a really solid album, and steps closer to the sound of the band that I am much more familiar with, on what I believe to be four of the most vaunted albums in the VdGG catalog.\n\nI really enjoyed going through this album, and it has helped me to get closer to Hammill's vocals in the dynamic sense of how they work with the music. Perhaps not a classic singer as such, but in unison with what it appears the band are trying to accomplish, it works really very well.\n\nSo they are my newbie thoughts and feelings in regards to this album, which manages to be soothing and disturbing, melodic and chaotic, and does all I ask an album of this type to do, take me on a journey.\n\nSo let us know what you think of this album....\n\nThe when, where, how stuff.\n\nThe feelings it gave/gives you.\n\nEssentially, just share your heart and mind on The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other.\n\nDarkness\n\nDay dawns dark\n\nIt now numbers\n\nInfinity\n\nLife crawls from the past\n\nWatching in wonder\n\nI trace its patterns in me\n\nTomorrow's tomorrow is birth again\n\nBoats burn the bridge in the fens\n\nThe time of the past returns to my life\n\nAnd uses it\n\nDon't blame me\n\nFor the letters that may\n\nForm in the sand\n\nDon't look in my eyes\n\nYou may see all the numbers\n\nThat stretch in my sky\n\nAnd colour my hand\n\nDon't say that I'm wrong in imagining\n\nThat the voice of my life cannot sing\n\nFate enters and talks in old words\n\nThey amuse it\n\nHands shine darkly and white\n\nOnly in dark, they appear\n\nBless the baby born today (wicked little)\n\nFlying in pitch (Scorpio doomed to die a thousand times)\n\nFlying on fear (before he lives)\n\nThey shine in my eyes and touch my face\n\nWhere I have seen them placed before\n\nDon't blame me, please, for the fate that falls\n\nI did not choose it\n\nI did not choose it\n\nI did not\n\nNo, no, I did not\n\nI truly did not choose it\n\nSongwriters: Peter Hammill\n\nDarkness (11/11) lyrics © Stratsong Limited, Carlin Music Corp\n\nI like the lyric here. It seems to speak to a number of things actually, though shrouded in a sort of mystery sheen of poetic license.\n\nThe opening verse seems to speak to the idea of the history of life playing out through its modern inhabitants.\n\nThen we get the idea of the past constantly being repeated and the writer observes this in his own life, and the way life continually shows us pictures of ourselves matched against history, and how we are used in ways that we often don't understand, to achieve goals that we equally don't understand.... in a macro sense.\n\nThen we get the idea of not blaming this person for being involved in this perpetuation of the process of life itself. and all the curve balls it throws.\n\n\"Don't blame me for the letters that may form in the sand\" is a great line and it speaks to the fact that we only have control over two things in our lives, our actions and reactions.\n\nI learned long ago that everything else was completely out of my control, and it can sometimes be a hard lesson in the way we learn this.\n\nThe second change lyric kind of makes me laugh a little, because it seems almost like a shrouded dig at his own singing, and the fate that led him to be the singer of the band, but it could also have the double meaning of, if life is seen as the song we sing, mixed with fates we face, then our journey will walk in paths well trodden\n\n\"Fate enters and talks in old words\" ... i love this line, and like most of the lyric, could be broadly interpreted into many meanings, but in keeping with the general flow of this poem, it again speaks to the idea that all that is happening as happened before in one way or another. With the old words being things gone before.\n\nThey amuse it, is an interesting full stop at the end of this sentence.\n\nThe old words amuse fate, as tied to the grand picture, fate has seen this game before, and heard the old words virtually an infinite amount of times.\n\nThe next section makes this personal, in the reflected lyric.\n\n\"wicked little Scorpio doomed to die a thousand times before he lives\"\n\nHammill was born November 5th 1948, and so is indeed a Scorpio for those into that kind of thing.... and being a Halloween 68 baby, I'm a Scorpio almost exactly twenty years younger.\n\nThis is where we seem to get to the heart of the darkness in the lyric.\n\nHis hands shine darkly... only in dark, they appear... which could be his hands, or perhaps the old voices from the previous section.\n\nBut it goes on to say \"Bless the baby born today\"....\n\nIn the US rebirthing (an apparently somewhat dangerous practice, that is supposed to help heal childhood trauma) started to gain traction in 1974 ... which is a few years away, but perhaps Hammill read up about it, or experienced it?\n\nThough again with the way the whole lyric is set up, it could be some kind of reference to his birth into the band, as a musician etc etc...\n\nFlying in pitch, would appear to be akin to travelling blind. Flying in utter darkness. Essentially moving forward without any idea of where you're going, but needing to move forward anyway.\n\nFlying On fear.... gives the idea of, again, moving forward in light of the feeling of being surrounded by darkness, an inability to see a path, and the consequence is flying forward in fear of the unseen lurking around every corner of life.\n\nThat last section is again somewhat cryptic, and appears to be talking about the hands.... but are they his hands?\n\nI notice from my looking around at who I am dealing with here, because I am completely foreign to Hammill, and only really vaguely familiar and new to the band, that he has some songs about mental health facilities.... perhaps this is about the darkness of mental health issues, and the associated treatments back in the day.\n\nPerhaps the old words and such, are referring to old knowledge about how to deal with these things. The shining hands could be related as a kind of poetic painting of electro-shock therapy......\n\nAnyway.... Sorry if my attempt to get under the skin of the lyrics is way off, or stupid, or irritating.... and somebody will probably come along now and say, in his book Hammill said this lol....\n\nBut I really enjoy trying to dig into lyrics, even rather cryptic, poetic ones"
