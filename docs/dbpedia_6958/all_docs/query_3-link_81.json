        "text": "Boston metallic hardcore veterans Converge, have been pushing the boundaries of aggressive music since its 1991 inception. Following their 1991 demo, the band contributed to numerous CD compilations, and eventually released their debut LP ‘Halo in a Haystack.’ It wasn’t until Converge released its definitive 1996 release, ‘Petitioning the Empty Sky’ on Ferret Music, that the band received praise from critics everywhere, and were thrusted to the forefront of the metalcore movement. The band, along with Ferret Music, would eventually re-release the 7″ on CD format, adding four newly recorded tracks and several live recordings. This CD was eventually picked up and distributed by Equal Vision Records. Since then, the band has continued its prolific career with numerous split albums with acts such as Agoraphobic Nosebleed and Hellchild, as well as seven inches, more compilations, and constant touring. Numerous labels that the band has worked with include Hydrahead Records, Ellington Recordings, Second Nature Recordings, and Relapse Records. In early-1998, the band released its second full-length on EVR, ‘When Forever Comes Crashing.’ In the fall of 2001, the band would release its third full-length, entitled ‘Jane Doe.’ The band has had its fair share of line-up changes. Stephen Brodsky (Cave In), had a short tenure playing bass during the release and tour for ‘When Forever Comes Crashing.’ Since then, Nate Newton (Jesuit) has taken over on bass. Elsewhere, the band has also experienced several changes in the drummer position, finally settling with Ben Koller. More recently, long-time guitarist Aaron Dalbec (Bane) stepped down from Converge prior to its ‘Jane Doe’ tour, making the band a four-piece. An eclectic mix of hardcore, metal, punk, and noise, Converge is a dynamic band constantly pushing the boundaries of music and its visual presentation."
