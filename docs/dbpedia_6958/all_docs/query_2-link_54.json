        "text": "How To Distribute Music As A Record Label\n\nIf you want to distribute music as a record label, you'll need to go through a music distribution company that allows label specific services & abilities.\n\nThis will allow you to release unlimited releases from as many artists as you'd like to the major stores.\n\nIf you've done any searching on Google in the past year or so, you've probably realized how hard it is to find out the best label distribution service...\n\nFrustrating right!?\n\nWell... look no further because we've got exactly what you're looking for.\n\nHere are all the options for music distribution companies that allow you to distribute music as a record label!\n\nThe more we help you win, the more we win!\n\nDistribute Your Label's Music For Free Below!\n\nWe've created a new distributor!

If you release EDM music, we'll also send your music and register your label with Beatport & Traxsource.\n\nBest Label Distribution Companies\n\nLets get right into the meat & potatoes!\n\nAs an independent label, Which music distribution services can you depend on to release your vast catalog to ever major platform.\n\n1. Boost Collective\n\nShameless plug, but we wholeheartedly believe we've come up with the answer to the problems independent labels have when getting off the ground!\n\nWhat makes Boost so great?\n\nWell... we're the rebellion of the music industry!\n\nWe aim to bring artists & labels a fully-fledged artist development platform. For free...\n\nYes, you heard me... for free!\n\nWe're here to help you release all of your music with free distribution.\n\nSo no membership fees or absurd upcharges for releasing more music with more artists.\n\nOn top of this, We've got a music armory! Huh? What's that you ask?\n\nWould you fancy some free Spotify Promotion? or how about some free music visual videos...\n\nperhaps you'd be interested in free cover art then? We've got you covered!\n\nUnlike other music distributors, our model is ultimately aligned with yours.\n\nBoost Collective is designed to grow with you as you build your label.\n\nBoost is the platform artists go to when they’re ready to graduate from basic distributors anyone can access. Here’s what they have to offer.\n\nPromotion On Autopilot - Every release you distribute is automatically pitched\n\nFree Asset Funding - From cover art to video visuals, artists get it all when they distribute through Boost Collective\n\nFuture Growth Opportunities - As you grow, more doors unlock with Boost. From editorial opportunities to advances, distribution deals and more. All whilst you stay independent!\n\nArtists and labels deserve a new way, and we're aiming to give Boost Collective members an unfair advantage over everyone else!\n\nMost distribution companies are blocking the ability to have multiple artist profiles and put a cap on the amount of music you can actually release as a label, wanting you to upgrade to some expensive plan.\n\nWith Boost Collective, you can push out unlimited releases, and have as many artists as you possibly want to have on your roster.\n\nAt the end of the day, we're rebels in the game!\n\n11 Epic services Boost Collective Offers:\n\nAdvanced Earnings Tracking\n\nUnlimited Releases & Artists\n\nDSP Artist Profile Mapping\n\nCommunity Of Talented Artists & Industry Pros\n\nStreaming breakdown & trends\n\nYouTube Music Content ID\n\nMultiple Artist Profiles Completely Free\n\nStay independent & own your rights\n\nFree UPC codes\n\nSplit Royalty accounting With Easy 1 Click Statement Emailing\n\nOpportunities to work closely with our team!\n\nThe Boost Collective tool vault goes even deeper.\n\nTools include:\n\nSpotify Promotion\n\nBanner Creation\n\nCover Art Creation\n\nSpotify Canvas Creation\n\nMusic Mastering\n\nMusic Videos\n\nWith all of that being said *phew*\n\nWe believe that Boost Collective is the best option when it comes to music distribution for labels.\n\nWe'd love to have you with us! Hit the button below to get started!\n\n2. Releese\n\nRecord labels can use Releese.io to distribute and manage their music in a lot of great ways!\n\nFirst of all, Releese.io offers a full distribution service that lets labels send their music to all of the biggest online music streaming services, like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and more.\n\nThe best part is, they don't charge any upfront fees or costs on an annual basis. This makes it a good choice for labels that want to distribute their music without spending a lot of money.\n\nIn conclusion, Releese.io is a great choice for record labels that want to manage and distribute their music. The platform is a great choice for labels of all sizes and levels of experience because it has a complete distribution service, an easy-to-use interface, and affordable pricing plans\n\n3. Label the Engine\n\nLabel Engine is geared toward record labels, however, they do accept artists as well.\n\nTo utilize Label Engine, you must first complete an application procedure and get your application accepted by their staff.\n\nIt is completely free and allows users to release an infinite number of tracks, although they do take 15% of revenues, which is quite fair for what they provide!\n\nThey not only provide distribution, but also a comprehensive set of marketing tools geared for established companies with a huge archive of music.\n\nThis sounds great, however, it isn't part of their distribution package.\n\nJust know, you must pay for additional capabilities, which may be hit or miss for anybody to use LE as their primary distributor.\n\nHowever, you may utilize another distributor and use Label Engine's marketing capabilities - and you don't need to be approved.\n\nOverall though, the services Label Engine provides are really solid! Good on them!\n\nYou'll be able to run a fully-fledged label off of the platform with no problem, and get up and running swiftly.\n\nWe recommend a labeled engine for labels that are budget ready!\n\n3. CD Baby\n\nCD Baby has been in the game for a long time.\n\nIt's a great tool that's dependable.\n\nThey offer distribution for an upfront fee of $9.95 per song.\n\nBeginners may learn about the music industry and how to use promotional techniques by using instructional materials.\n\nIt also provides music mastering services and has collaborations with Spotify and Apple Music, as well as lesser-known providers like TouchTunes and Musixmatch.\n\nCD Baby is a music distribution business that works with all of the major digital streaming services and distributes songs to whatever ones you want.\n\nOne of the main advantages of CD Baby is that getting your music on specific platforms without an official distributor is both time-consuming and complicated.\n\nIf you opt to make CDs or vinyl records, you may also distribute your music to physical distributors. Alliance Entertainment, which has access to over 15,000 shops including Barnes & Noble, Target, and Amazon, has teamed with CD Baby.\n\nIt's cool to know that you can have physical distribution alongside the digital distribution services.\n\n4. Identity Music\n\nIdentity music is a newer player in the distributor space.\n\nThey seem to be a very solid option when it comes to running a label.\n\nThey offer all of the services you need such as transferring your catalog, accounting, and various other services.\n\nDistribution for indie labels gets easier when you have the tools you actually need.\n\nWith Identity, you'll need to go through their application process to see if you're a right fit for their platform.\n\nThey'll be asking you for your name, what your role is, and what services you're interested in!\n\nSo make sure you're ready to give some good answers!\n\n5. Repost By SoundCloud\n\nRepost by SoundCloud is a distribution platform that was originally titled \"repost network\"\n\nSoundCloud offers a variety of solutions to aid current musicians in their careers.\n\nOffering digital distribution, promotional assistance, radio station pitching, SoundCloud track monetization, and a variety of additional music services!\n\nSoundCloud's report appears to be a major rival in the music industry for independent musicians.\n\nIs SoundCloud's Repost any good, then?\n\nRepost By SoundCloud is a good platform that tries to assist musicians in making a career from their own music.\n\nIts most significant competitive advantage is the ability to monetize SoundCloud music, which no other site offers.\n\nArtists that desire to pursue an independent career while maintaining their professionalism.\n\nSoundCloud's Repost is a set of tools for musicians that works as an add-on to the main SoundCloud platform.\n\nThe platform, also known as Repost Network, is a music distribution service that allows artists to distribute their songs to a variety of retailers.\n\nOverall, of all the music distributors, in our Repost by SoundCloud review, we noted that the value was definitely there!\n\nHow Do Independent Record Labels Distribute Music?\n\nHere are the steps that independent labels take to release music on their own:\n\nSurprisingly its not hard at all!\n\n7 was independent labels can distribute music:\n\nChoose a digital music distribution service\n\nRegister your label with the service\n\nGet approved to start releasing music online\n\nPrepare contracts for your artists\n\nAssemble release assets (cover art, meta data etc...)\n\nDistribute to all major stores\n\nBuild up a strong catalog\n\nWe're extremely lucky to be able to operate a fully-fledged label thanks to various services on the internet.\n\nThe best part is that it won't cost anything to get started these days!\n\nHow To Determine If A Label Distribution Company Is Favourable\n\nIndependent labels need the proper tools to help make life easier.\n\nAt the end of the day, indie labels are businesses.\n\nIt's not enough to merely get your music from music stores. It's to be expected that your digital releases get delivered to all stores worldwide.\n\nWhat I'm referring to are the tools and perks you should make sure to keep an eye out for.\n\nLabel Distribution Must Haves:\n\nThere are a few key principles every label needs to have.\n\nWant to see success in your distribution?\n\n4 record label must-haves for distributing music:\n\nHassle-free distribution to digital platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music)\n\nDeliver music directly to social media platforms (Tik Tok, Instagram, Triller & more)\n\nAllow you to have full ownership of your masters\n\nPushes in the direction to make more money through your label.\n\nWe Don't Recommend Services That:\n\nCharge absurd fees for multiple artist profiles\n\nProvide sketchy record contracts\n\nTake your rights away from you\n\nHave 3rd party music delivery partners with hidden fees\n\nHave a large upfront fee\n\nDo You Need To Give Artists A Contract As An Indie Label?\n\nIt's usually best practice to give your artists a contract when you're going to release their music.\n\nThis is not only to protect the artist but to protect you, the label!\n\nJust think... what if your artist scores some brand partnerships (yay!) but there was no contract/agreement...\n\nSo whoops... all your hard work in promoting the music has now gone to waste.\n\nYou'll want to lay out exactly how your distribution deals will play out with your artists.\n\nSome questions you'll need to ask yourself are:\n\nWill I want to license out the master recordings to sync opportunities?\n\nWill I want to actively make sure I'm collecting a fair share of revenues from YouTube content ID?\n\nHow much of digital revenues from stores will you be taking?\n\nWill you be charging artists any sort of distribution fees?\n\nAll of these things come down to your business model as a record label.\n\nThis might be the least fun part of the process...\n\nBut it would be a shame to miss out on some big payouts down the road from simple mistakes at the start.\n\nCan I Migrate My Catalog To Another Label Distributor?\n\nAs a record label, you will most likely amass a large catalog of bangers!\n\nYou can certainly migrate your catalog of music to another digital music distribution service if you so choose to.\n\nIn order to switch distribution companies, you'll want to have all of your ISRC & UPC codes ready, along with the cover art and meta data associated with the previous releases.\n\nSome distribution companies will even allow you to bulk upload your releases to be able to move them over.\n\nOften times a digital distributor will ask for a spreadsheet with all of the assets organized to make the process swift.\n\nDo Independent Artists Even Want To Get Signed These Days?\n\nSo then... do the independent artists of today even want to get a record deal?\n\nI would say yes... and no. Here's why...\n\nArtists will tell you they want to do what they love for a living whilst having a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nIn other words... they don't want to be indebted to a mega corporation for the next 5 years losing sleep at night...\n\nStressing the outcome of their career.\n\nSo yes... an artist would absolutely love to get signed if it meant that they could get an incentive structure that benefited both them and the label.\n\nThe label needs to be able to put up some serious value whilst not getting too greedy.\n\nWe've all heard the horror stories of old when it comes to the dreaded record label contract.\n\nSince artists no longer need a label to simply get onto Spotify or Apple Music any more... digital distributors fill a void that was once there.\n\nRecord labels are businesses that sell recorded music and its accompanying films.\n\nThey work in the music industry in a variety of capacities, including new artist recruitment and development (also known as A&R, or artist and repertoire), music publishing, and copyright enforcement.\n\nOne of the most crucial duties of a record label is marketing, as public knowledge of their brand and affiliated musicians is how they make money.\n\nThe world's most successful musicians are offered deals by major record labels.\n\nThese record companies, like Sony and Universal Music Group, have distribution networks that get the music of the artists they sign exclusive contracts with into the hands of millions of people in days or even hours.\n\nMajor labels negotiate a variety of contracts with its artists, including licensing and distribution agreements, in which they get a large percentage of the artist's international revenues.\n\nMany big record labels also have sub-labels dedicated to authoring, recording, and marketing certain music genres such as country, Latin, jazz, and hip-hop.\n\nSo then... if the artist was able to get a deal that was structured in such a way where ownership was not fully taken, and splits were fair...\n\nI think most artists would say yes.\n\nThe Label Incentive Structure That Actually Makes Sense\n\nThis was precisely why we decided to create the Boost Collective platform in the first place...\n\nWe want to give artists and independent labels the ability to extrapolate value in an incentive structure that actually benefits both parties.\n\nIts time to start tackling the growing markets of the music industry without having to negotiate deals that are shady at best.\n\nWe aim to be the one distributor you actually need!\n\nAfter all, the music business has changed dramatically in recent years. It's time to move forward!\n\nThe Importance Of Music Distribution For Labels\n\nThe link between your finished album and your prospective listeners is music distribution.\n\nThe importance of distribution in music marketing cannot be overstated.\n\nRecord companies and independent artists used to have to rely on physical music distributors to get their recordings into the hands of fans.\n\nDigital music distribution, on the other hand, has taken center stage.\n\nIn 2015, digital sales overtook sales of physical media for the first time.\n\nIn order to reach all of your potential followers, you need to use digital distribution as an artist. Your visibility will increase as a result of smart distribution.\n\nIt ensures that your music reaches as many people as possible. It also assists you in being compensated for your songs.\n\nMake More Money With Your Record Label\n\nUsers of social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, or Tumblr have all witnessed live performances by musicians, and many of these platforms pay the content producers that help them become so well-known.\n\nBy managing their own social media profiles, notably on Instagram and TikTok, record labels can benefit from this. In addition to the advertising advantages, which increase as more people hear the songs and the artists earn more money, record companies and artists can directly profit from these apps.\n\nThe best location to promote a label and artists is on social media.\n\nOnce a label's social media manager is at ease in their position, they can sell merchandise, promote events like concerts and festivals, release new music clips, solicit sponsorships, and promote each individual artist with their own page.\n\nMaking money from applications and social media requires engaging with users and acquiring new, genuine, interested users.\n\n360 Deals + Merchandising\n\nWhether you like it or not, the music industry is headed in this direction with 360-type deals.\n\nRecord labels frequently generate extra cash by selling items at live concerts, online, and through social media.\n\nWearing band shirts, pins, posters, bags, and hoodies is a popular way for fans to show support for their favorite musicians. When done properly, concert tour memorabilia evoke nostalgia that lasts a lifetime.\n\nWho hasn't come across someone who owns a t-shirt with so many holes it's hardly wearable but who won't throw it out because of the memories it brings back?\n\nFans adore it, and a label can sell it. Signed posters make excellent freebies, reduced t-shirts make excellent holiday promotional items, and CDs and vinyl are still sought after by collectors if the artist caters to that market.\n\nA label must generate more revenue than they spend on the product. This entails finding supplies at a fair price, keeping an eye on the manufacturing budget, and selling the product that is currently in stock before ordering an excessive amount more.\n\nIf a product isn't doing well, the company may provide discounts to customers or include it in giveaways to attract attention on social media.\n\nThere are few things more inconvenient than advancing to the front of a long concert queue only to discover that they only accept cash. In this high-tech era, a credit/debit card reader for a cell phone is a wise investment.\n\nTo make it simpler for fans to pay for their stuff, small labels or artists can even use Venmo or other similar apps. Online shops can also sell goods.\n\nDistrokid Label Plan: Any Good?\n\nDistroKid Label plans allow you to upload unlimited songs and albums for 5 to 100 artists to over 100 shops and streaming platforms while keeping 100% of the revenue and splitting royalty payments conveniently.\n\nDistroKid Label plans come in five tiers, ranging from $79.99 to $1,199.99 USD, and let you release anywhere from 5 to 100 artists depending on the tier you pick.\n\nPersonally... we're not a big fan of the cost per artist that Distrokid charges.\n\nIt's also worth noting that DistroKid refers to the number of artists as \"Artist Slots,\" and every time you submit a release with a unique artist name linked to the music, a single Artist Slot is eaten up in your account.\n\nEach main artist, primary artist, featured artist, and/or remixer on the song takes up one artist space for each song you submit.\n\nThis is significant because if you wish to release a collaboration with another artist, you'll need two spots (or 1 artist slot per collaborator).\n\nIf you're a label or have numerous artist names or aliases, you might want to explore a Label plan.\n\nHowever, if you intend to release many collaborations with various artists or perform multiple remixes, you might want to explore the Label plan.\n\nOverall... I wouldn't say that Distrokid's label plan isn't good. The features are solid and dependable...\n\nIt's just not a very good deal versus the competition...\n\nThere are plenty of other options that will serve you well instead of having to pay so much annually just to release on the online stores with multiple artists...\n\nJoin The #1 Platform For Labels.\n\nWe're starting a revolution - and putting labels (like you) first.\n\nBoost Collective is a free-forever music distribution platform. Upload unlimited releases to 150+ stores and get tools and promotion to grow your label.\n\nYou'll also get free playlist promotion, cover art creation, and much more!"
