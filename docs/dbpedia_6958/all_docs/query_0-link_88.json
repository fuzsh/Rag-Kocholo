        "text": "My copy arrived on the day of release - I wasn’t home and didn’t check my emails but the Amazon delivery guy had pushed it under the gate and left no card - by the time I realised it was there the package was soaked through following a heavy downpour the day before and overnight.\n\nThe box set itself survived this trauma but the 7” single sleeve had a 3 inch split down one side as it had been allowed to move about within the gatefold sleeve that houses this and the 2CDS and poster.\n\nSo I reported it to Amazon and they delivered a replacement last weekend which includes a fault free 7”. I’ve played the vinyl and CD items and have kept the replacement and returned the original copy.\n\nI wasn’t aware of the demo tracks being available to download so it’s a bit of a drag to know the main selling point was available for free.\n\nI’m still pleased to have the box set though. The book is interesting and has clippings and photos that I hadn’t seen before and the sleevenotes I found informative. Note that I’m not a die hard fan so perhaps to some this is old hat to a degree but I like this album a lot (and own the 2 previous CD versions) so I was keen to get this version to add to what I already knew.\n\nAre the bands subsequent albums getting a 50th anniversary edition does anyone know?\n\nApart from Vital I only have the earlier CD editions without the bonus tracks and don’t actually have all of those as Godbluff is available spread over 2 compilations I own and I’ve never owned World Record either for no particular reason.\n\nIt would be good if they can reissue the first pressing mix of The Least We Can Do next year alongside the more common mix that the band preferred.\n\nI compared the new 50th-Anniversary release and the German 1975 Fontana pressing tonight. First, let me say that I am not the expert on this release that most others are in this thread. I am only posting my thoughts to get feedback from others who are more familiar with this album. I found the 1975 German Fontana pressing to sound overdriven on the recording level. The vocal was a little too hot and sounded a little distorted - making it less pleasant to listen to. In fact, the Cherry Red pressing was recorded at about 70% - 80% of the German pressing. I had to turn up the volume on the 50th Aniversary to compare at equal volumes - but in doing so, the vocals didn't sound to be as overdriven. The Fontana pressing sounded like a cassette that I would record in the 1980's that hadn't been kept out of the red on the meter. I was able to understand Peter Hammill's vocals more clearly on the 2019 set, and though many could call it a tamer presentation - it was easier to listen to. This is not a commentary on the price or packaging (which I found to be marginal). The original 1969 pressings may blow all others out of the water. This I do not know. I purchased this set in hopes that the Cherry Red pressing would be superior to the Fontana; allowing me to sell the Fontana and keep a package with better audio plus bonus tracks. While torn about my conclusions, I am leaning toward the Cherry Red. Unlike many previous posters, I have had very good luck with Cherry Red Prog reissues.\n\nBought the box this morning (Action Records, Preston) - I like the look of the box and contents, but not the way the two CDs are held in place. From past experience, it wouldn't be long before the cardboard 'clips' start to show damage, so I'll keep the CDs in their own plastic envelopes, and not use the clips.\n\nI like the booklet very much (could have done with being proofread though), but why no input from Hugh Banton and Guy Evans? And why isn't \"the mysterious Jeff\" identified? He's Geoff Peach, aka Jeff Peach who was a member of Brian 'Blinky' Davison's band, Every Which Way, on their only album. https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/geoff_peach/credits/\n\nBig Sound aka Fat Sound\n\nA question about Necromancer - is the AGM version the same as the one on 68-71? The sleeve notes on 68-71 say that the version there was previously unreleased (the label says it's \"Courtesy of Mercury Records\"), but it has the same time (3' 30\") as the AGM version.\n\nFinally, does anyone else hear a similarity between the track Aerosol Grey Machine and Country Joe and The Fish's I Feel Like I'm Fixin' To Die?\n\nSince 68-71 was a UK release and the \"Afterwards/Necromancer\" single and AGM itself was not released in the UK I suspect that's the reason for the previously unreleased blurb. I don't have the single, but the version on 68-71 and the original US AGM have always sounded the same to me.\n\nAny one else have comments to offer on the SQ of CD-one (original album) from this set ?\n\nJust curious if any other VdGG fans here bought it and have compared the new CD to the earlier edition (?)\n\nThe DR values are all over the spectrum :\n\nFirst CD from the 50th Anniversary Deluxe Edition.
