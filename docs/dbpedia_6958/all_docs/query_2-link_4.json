        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Universal Music Video & Distribution on March 4 announced the launch of independent distribution division Fontana, which began soliciting retailers in mid-February. Its first batch of new releases will hit shelves March 15.\n\nAmong the first labels Fontana will service are the punk-focused Vagrant Records, indie rock imprint Absolutely Kosher, industrial label Van Richter, Australian rock label 456 Records and Los Angeles-based hip-hop label Avatar Records. As of March 4, Fontana had accumulated a roster of 15 labels, sources say.\n\nIn January, Fontana absorbed about 400 catalog titles from Universal labels, including indie-focused acts such as Material Issue and the Ramones. Like other major-owned independent distributors, the parent company will handle such back-room functions as shipping and manufacturing. Fontana labels will have access to UMVD sales statisticians, as well as its corporate partnership department and digital distribution capabilities.\n\nFontana will steer clear of the trend of upstreaming, in which independent labels partner with a major to bring successful acts into the parent company. However, Universal labels will have the option to downstream artists to Fontana. Additionally, Fontana labels will not participate in UMVD’s reduced-pricing initiative JumpStart, which eliminates co-op spending and requires participating retailers to dedicate a certain percentage of floor space to UMVD titles.\n\nSteve Pritchitt will head Fontana, reporting to UMVD president Jim Urie.\n\nThe long-waited launch of Fontana gives each major label a foothold in the independent market. Fontana will compete against EMI’s Caroline, Warner’s Alternative Distribution Alliance and Sony BMG’s RED, as well as pure independents such as Koch Entertainment Distribution and Navarre Entertainment Media."
