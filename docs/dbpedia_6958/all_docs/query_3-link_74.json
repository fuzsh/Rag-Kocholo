        "text": "On the collaborative nature of fact-check based journalism\n\nWe rely very, very heavily on experts, be that in health, misinformation, any situation where we don’t know, I’m not a health expert at all. So I rely very heavily on experts to give you the context on an issue. Sometimes you need to rely on people to give you the background to even get into the thing itself. We are a member of the International Fact Checking Network, which is a body that uphold standards of accreditation for fact checkers… that means standards of actual work, their methodologies, standards of transparency, of funding, of sources.\n\nThat’s a very, very active community. There’s an annual conference and a lot of you work together across different projects. We help each other out when you’re working on fact checks which cross countries. Misinformation goes around the world and is not stopped by borders.\n\nOn community’s role in the news business\n\nA significant portion of the things we fact check come from suggestions from members, and from general readers. We try to respond to people in it. So it’s not abuse, which obviously, every organisation gets a bit of. But if someone’s got a question about factcheck, they’ll either email me or they’ll tweet us.\n\nAnd so anyone can see we do corrections as well; obviously, we make errors and correct, that’s another part of our accreditation with the International Fact Checking Network, because part of the accreditation [process] is you’ve got to show that you have made corrections. At some point, it’s less of an adversarial way of doing things. And I’ve worked in the mainstream media before and organisations like that, and while the work that was done by the journalists in these places was brilliant there was much less of a feeling of it being a connected thing to its audience. There’s far more separation.\n\nThe evolving nature of misinformation\n\nThere’s a sort of weird stratification of who uses media platforms. For example, Facebook is now is used by older people – not all, not exclusively, but primarily. Their primary social media platform is Facebook. Then Instagram is used by a slightly younger cohort, but then there’s things like Snapchat and TikTok, so people are getting their misinformation from different places. So it becomes even more difficult to keep up, keep up, you have to have a handle on it. For example, if you’re a young person who’s got an elderly relative you’re getting your information and your misinformation from different places.\n\nAnd each one of these platforms has a different level of verification and effort they put into verifying things and working with fact checkers. Each platform has a different way of information spreading. So WhatsApp, for example, the information spreads group by group in a very insular way."
