        "text": "Big news for the independent music community today (3/2), as leading digital distribution/marketing/technology provider INgrooves has acquired Fontana Distribution from Universal Music Group. The new company, INgrooves Fontana, aims to provide a complete solution to independent labels by combining INgrooves’ asset management and distribution platform with Fontana’s physical distribution capabilities. Financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but UMG will hold a minority interest in INgrooves.\n\n“Through this acquisition, we are now able to offer the independent music community a fully integrated physical and digital distribution marketing solution in North America,” said INgrooves founder Robb McDaniels. “We believe that a successful relationship between distributor and label is, at its root, a flexible structure with a transparent flow of information. By combining INgrooves and Fontana, we will be able to extend this philosophy into a comprehensive distribution operation that provides our collective client base with a larger sales force, more marketing resources and a one-stop global retail network that maximizes opportunities in this dynamic, challenging environment.”\n\nINgrooves Fontana will be run by INgrooves President Dave Zierler and Fontana President Ron Spaulding. The new company will continue to work with UMG’s sales forces to support physical releases.\n\nThe combined forces represent a host of popular indie labels including Fat Possum, Nettwerk, Dualtone, Rostrum Records, ESL Music, Metropolis, OM Records, Vagrant Records, Strange Music, Watertower Music, Downtown Records and Music World among others."
