        "meta_description": "Speciation leads to adaptive changes in organ cellular physiology and creates challenges for studying rare cell-type functions that diverge between humans and mice. Rare cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-rich pulmonary ionocytes exist throughout the cartilaginous airways of humans1,2, but limited presence and divergent biology in the proximal trachea of mice has prevented the use of traditional transgenic models to elucidate ionocyte functions in the airway. Here we describe the creation and use of conditional genetic ferret models to dissect pulmonary ionocyte biology and function by enabling ionocyte lineage tracing (FOXI1-CreERT2::ROSA-TG), ionocyte ablation (FOXI1-KO) and ionocyte-specific deletion of CFTR (FOXI1-CreERT2::CFTRL/L). By comparing these models with cystic fibrosis ferrets3,4, we demonstrate that ionocytes control airway surface liquid absorption, secretion, pH and mucus viscosity—leading to reduced airway surface liquid volume and impaired mucociliary clearance in cystic fibrosis, FOXI1-KO and FOXI1-CreERT2::CFTRL/L ferrets. These processes are regulated by CFTR-dependent ionocyte transport of Cl− and HCO3−. Single-cell transcriptomics and in vivo lineage tracing revealed three subtypes of pulmonary ionocytes and a FOXI1-lineage common rare cell progenitor for ionocytes, tuft cells and neuroendocrine cells during airway development. Thus, rare pulmonary ionocytes perform critical CFTR-dependent functions in the proximal airway that are hallmark features of cystic fibrosis airway disease. These studies provide a road map for using conditional genetics in the first non-rodent mammal to address gene function, cell biology and disease processes that have greater evolutionary conservation between humans and ferrets. Conditional genetic ferret models enable ionocyte lineage tracing, ionocyte ablation and ionocyte-specific deletion of CFTR to elucidate the roles of pulmonary ionocyte biology and function during human health and disease.",

        "text": "Generation and use of transgenic ferret models\n\nAll animal experimentation was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Iowa. Existing transgenic models used in these studies included CFTR-KO ferrets3,36 and CFTRG551D/G551D ferrets4,37. Animals were distributed into experimental groups based on genotype and were not randomized. Blinding was not necessary in this study since assays used unbiased quantification methods. Sex was not considered a variable due to the difficulty in obtaining an equal distribution of genders when using transgenic ferrets. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Ferrets were outbred on a sable coat colour background. The age of animals tested is given in the Reporting Summary.\n\nZygote manipulation and adoptive transfer of embryos\n\nFerret zygotes were collected as previously described from sable ferret matings38. Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex, at a final concentration of 400 ng μl−1, was injected into zygote pronuclei (around 3–5 pl) using a FemtoJet (Eppendorf). When a DNA template was used to facilitate homologous recombination, linear DNA was added at a final concentration of 40 ng μl−1. To assemble Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoproteins, 1 μM sgRNA was incubated with 1 μM Cas9 protein in IDT Duplex Buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Injected embryos were cultured in TCM-199 + 10% FCS medium overnight to the two-cell stage before being transferred into primipara pseudopregnant jills39. The kits were naturally delivered 42 days after adoptive transfer (full-term gestation).\n\nGeneration of sgRNA and DNA templates for homologous recombination in ferret zygotes\n\nThe sgRNAs targeting FOXI1 exon-1, FOXI1 3′ UTR and CFTR exon-16 were designed using the Broad Institute GPP and/or CRISPOR tool. All sgRNAs used in this project are listed in Table 1. sgRNAs were generated from in vitro transcribed gBlocks synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and included all components necessary for sgRNA production (that is, T7 promoter, target sequence, guide RNA scaffold and termination signal). gBlocks were PCR amplified using primers gRNA-fwd and gRNA-rev (Table 1). The T7-sgRNA PCR products were gel purified and used as the template for in vitro transcription using MEGAshortscript T7 kit (Ambion). All sgRNAs were then purified using MegaClear Kit (Ambion) and eluted in RNase-free water.\n\nFOXI1 gene homology arms for insertion of the IRES-CreERT2 cassette were generated as gBlocks with unique restriction sites and cloned into a plasmid flanking the IRES-CreERT2. Similarly, CFTR exon-16 homology arms containing loxP sites were synthesized as gBlocks and cloned into a plasmid flanking exon-16. In both cases, silent blocking mutations were introduced into the sgRNA binding sequence to prevent cleavage of the donor fragment following HDR. sgRNA sequences, genomic target sites and length of homology arms with genomic positions are listed in Table 1 for each of the models created.\n\nMolecular characterization of transgenic ferret models\n\nGenomic DNA was generated from tail clips as previously described4 and used for initial genotyping of founders by PCR. Putative FOXI1-KO founder DNA was screened using a set of primers that resided external to the sgRNA cut sites, whereas FOXI1-CreERT2 and CFTRL/L candidate founders were screened using two sets of primers to capture genomic flanking sequences outside the right and left homology arms (that is, one primer internal and another primer external to the homology arm) (Supplementary Table 7). To confirm integrity of the targeted sequences in candidate founders, two further assays were performed: (1) the entire region of the donor fragment and flanking genomic sequences were subjected to nested PCR and the products were Sanger sequenced; and (2) Southern blotting was performed using restriction enzyme digests and locus-specific probes that mapped the length of endogenous and transgene-derived fragments for both arms flanking the insertion. A Cre probe was also used to map the FOXI1-CreERT2 locus. Finally, primary fibroblasts were generated from CFTRL/L and wild-type ferrets and treated with TAT-CRE (or untreated) to induce deletion of the 482 base pairs (bp) CFTR exon-16 fragment. Deletion was confirmed by PCR of the region and analysis of PCR products on agarose gels: wild-type (1,230 bp), intact loxP allele (1,298 bp) and deleted loxP allele (816 bp).\n\nHusbandry and specialized care of FOXI1-KO ferrets\n\nFOXI1-KO kits are very fragile and show a head tilt/circling phenotype shortly after birth that can affect their ability to feed. FOXI1-KO ferrets have balance disturbances early in life, probably due to a lack of pendrin (SLC26A4) expression in the inner ear and the expansion of the endolymphatic compartment. Impaired kidney function due to cyst formation also affected overall health. A rearing protocol was developed to increase FOXI1-KO kit survivability. From birth, FOXI1-KO kits were weighed every 24 h. Those animals that demonstrated a decline in weight gain were supplemented with oral Elecare baby formula (Abbott Laboratories) every 4–6 h. The frequency and amount of Elecare hand fed was adjusted on the basis of the weight and size of the developing kit and veterinarian directed. When kits demonstrated the ability to eat solid food (about 5 weeks of age), they were also offered a canned supplemental diet (Purina) in addition to hand feeding. After weaning at 8 weeks of age, they were transitioned onto a solid food diet consisting of solid chow (Marshall Farms), a hydrated solid chow mash and canned cat food (Purina).\n\nLineage tracing pulmonary ionocytes in FOXI1-CreERT2::ROSA-TG ferrets and ALI cultures\n\nFOXI1-CreERT2 ferrets were crossed to ROSA-TG Cre reporter ferrets19 to obtain hemizygous offspring for lineage tracing. In vivo FOXI1-CreERT2 lineage tracing was performed by five sequential daily intraperitoneal injections of tamoxifen (20 mg kg−1) to 1-month-old and 5-month-old adult ferrets. At 7–10 days later, tissues were fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h, cryoprotected in sucrose and embedded into OCT block or processed for whole-mount staining. Cryosections (8 μm) were used for immunofluorescence and mounted with DAPI solution for confocal imaging. For lineage tracing in vitro, ALI cultures derived from FOXI1-CreERT2::ROSA-TG ferret basal cell cultures were treated with 2 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OH-Tam) in ethanol or vehicle alone (ethanol) using two different experimental procedures: (1) For scRNA-seq experiments, cultures were treated with OH-Tam during differentiation at ALI from day 1 to day 17 (medium change every other day) and cells were collected at 21 days of ALI. This was done because it gave rise to a greater number of EGFP+ cells in the cultures following full differentiation. (2) For functional halide transport studies using the YFP sensor, ALI cultures were treated with OH-Tam starting on day 14 after moving to an ALI and cultures were moved to a new plate in the absence of OH-Tam 2 days before functional imaging studies (on days 22 to 28 of ALI).\n\nImmunofluorescence and antibodies\n\nParaffin sections (5 μm) and cryosections (8 μm) were treated for epitope retrieval with 10 mM citrate buffer at 95 °C for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Sections were then blocked in 10% donkey serum/PBS for 1 h at room temperature and primary antibodies were applied and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Slides were then washed three times for 15 min and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were washed and counterstained with DAPI for confocal imaging. The following antibodies were used: anti-BSND (1/500; ab196017, Abcam), anti-FOXI1 (1/500; ab20454, Abcam), anti-Keratin 5 (1/500; 905501, Biolegend), anti-SYP (1/200; sc-17750, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-acetylated Tubulin (1/1,000, T7451, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-ATP6V1G3 (1/500, HPA028701, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-NKA (1/100, a5, DHSB, UIOWA), anti-Ki-67 (1/500, 14-5698-82, eBioscience), anti-EGFP (1/300, ab13970, Abcam), anti-CFTR (1/100 to 1/300, CFTR antibody 596, cftrantibodies.web.unc.edu), anti-TRPM5 (1/300, ACC-045, Alamone), anti-p63 (1/300, clone poly6190, STEMCELL Technologies), anti-Muc5B (1/300, HPA008246, Sigma), anti-Muc5AC (1/300, ab3649, Abcam), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1/250, A31571, Molecular Probes), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat IgG (1/250, A11055, Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-chicken IgG (1/250, 703-546-155, Jackson ImmunoResearch), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1/250, A21206, Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat IgG (1/250, A-11057, Jackson ImmunoResearch), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (1/250, 711-606-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch), Alexa Fluor 555 donkey Anti-mouse IgG (1/250, A31570, Life Technologies). EdU staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (C10340, Click-iT EdU Cell Proliferation Kit for Imaging, Alexa Fluor 647 Dye).\n\nWhole-mount ferret trachea immunofluorescence staining for ionocytes, tuft cells and PNECs\n\nFerret tracheae and dissected intralobar airways were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, then washed three times in PBS for 30 min each. Fixed ferret tracheae could then be placed in 70% ethanol at −20 °C for extended storage. Staining for ionocyte markers used CFTR (cftrantibodies.web.unc.edu, CFTR antibody 596, working dilutions: 1:100 to 1:300), ATP6V1G3 (Millipore Sigma, HPA028701, working dilution: 1:300) and NKA (dshb.biology.uiowa.edu, ATP1A1, a5, working dilutions: 1:100 to 1:300). Staining for tuft cell marker used TRPM5 (Alamone, ACC-045, working dilution: 1:300) and for PNEC marker used SYP/Synaptophysin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-17750, working dilution: 1:100). Samples required antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) at 55 °C overnight, with agitation, before immunostaining. Ferret tracheae and intralobar airways were then washed with PBS three times for 20 min each and incubated in blocking buffer (20% donkey serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mM CaCl2 dissolved in PBS) overnight at 37 °C. Ferret tissues were then incubated with primary antibodies (dissolved in diluent buffer: 1% donkey serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mM CaCl2 dissolved in PBS) for 3 days at 37 °C, with agitation. Tracheae were then washed three times for 30 min in PBS and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 2 days at 37 °C, with agitation. After secondary antibody incubation, samples were washed three times for 30 min each in PBS and transferred to Ce3D tissue clearing solution (Biolegend catalogue no. 427704) for 2–3 h at room temperature. After tissue clearing, samples were mounted onto microscope slides (Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus) under 0.33 mm coverslips and edges were sealed with Gorilla Glue and clamped with binder clips for 30 min to ensure glue fixation. Zeiss LSM 880 or 980 confocal microscopes were used for imaging acquisition.\n\nIn vivo MCC measurements\n\nMCC measurements in wild-type, FOXI1-KO, and FOXI1-CreERT2::CFTRL/L ferrets were performed using positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) and 68Ga-macro aggregated albumin (68Ga-MAA) as previously described with modifications40. CFTRG551D/G551D ferrets4 reared on or off the CFTR modulator (VX-770/ivacaftor) served as controls for CFTR-dependent MCC. Ferrets were anaesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and then intubated. After intubation, the animal was placed in the gantry of a PET/CT scanner (GE Discovery MI, GE Healthcare). An initial scout computed tomography was acquired to confirm placement of the endotracheal tube at the distal end of the trachea. The dynamic positron emission tomography acquisition (15 min) was initiated and during the first minute of image acquisition 50 μl of saline containing 50 μCi 68Ga-Macro Aggregated Albumin (about 1.85 MBq) and 600 μM methacholine was rapidly administered into the distal trachea through a catheter. The syringe, catheter and endotracheal tube were then removed, and images were acquired continuously for 15 min. The positron emission tomography acquisition was followed by computed tomography for attenuation correction and anatomical coregistration. List mode data were reconstructed with the GE Discovery scanner’s software using three methods: (1) static image of 15 min; (2) dynamic image with 15 ×1 min frames; (3) dynamic image with a 20 s delay to eliminate delay before dose administration, followed by 60 ×10 s frames. We performed data analysis using PMOD software v.4.2 (PMOD Technologies) and clearance of the 68Ga-MAA was quantified as the PET/CT volume of interest at minute intervals after tracer deposition. Data were normalized to the volume of interest of the first full minute after tracer deposition. A plateau of clearance was typically reached by 10.5 min in wild-type animals. This timepoint was used to calculate percentage clearance.\n\nFerret tracheal basal cell isolation, expansion and differentiation\n\nFerret tracheal airway basal stem cells were isolated using an enzymatic digestion method similar to previous reports41. All primary cells tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium (STEMCELL Technologies) on plastic plates precoated with laminin-enriched 804G-conditioned medium. For passaging, the cells were detached with Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies) and re-seeded at a 1:4 split on 804G-coated plates as previously described42. For differentiation at ALI, ferret basal cells were seeded onto Transwell membranes coated with 804G in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium for 24 h and then lifted to an ALI with PneumaCult-ALI medium (STEMCELL Technologies) placed only on the basal side of the Transwell. Cultures were then used for experiments at 21–28 days.\n\nDroplet-based scRNA-seq\n\nFully differentiated ferret airway epithelia ALI cultures were dissociated using Accumax (STEMCELL Technologies) followed by DNase treatment. Cells were filtered through a 20 μM strainer and pelleted in 0.04% BSA PBS at 500g for 10 min. Non-viable dead cells were removed by using MACS Dead Cell Removal Kit following 10X Genomics recommendations (Document CG00039). Single cells were counted on a Thermo Countess cell counter and 0.04% BSA/PBS was added to achieve a targeted concentration of 1,000 cells per microlitre. Ionocyte enrichment was performed on OH-Tam-treated FOXI1-CreERT2::ROSA-TG ALI cultures followed by FACS isolation of EGFP- and Tomato-positive cells. Airway epithelial cells were sorted using a Becton Dickinson Aria instrument and BD FACSDiva 8.0.1 software. Cells were identified on the basis of FSC and SSC gating (Supplementary Fig. 2). Tomato- and EGFP-positive epithelial cells were identified on the basis of comparison with non-reporter ferret airway basal cells. Single cells were identified on the basis of forward scatter and forward pulse width. FACS-isolated EGFP-positive cells were then mixed with Tomato-positive epithelial cells to achieve around 10,000 total cells for 10X sequencing. The ratio of EGFP- to Tomato-positive cells varied for each experiment depending on the yield of lineage-labelled cells. Sequencing libraries were generated by following 10X Genomics recommendations (Document CG000315). Briefly, single cells and reverse transcription master mix were partitioned into Gel Beads in partitioning oil in the 10X Chromium controller. After reverse transcription, complementary DNA libraries were amplified and fragmentated, followed by adaptor ligation and sample index PCR reaction. Libraries were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 platform by the University of Iowa Genomics Division.\n\nShort circuit current measurements of CFTR-mediated Cl− and HCO3 − transport in ALI cultures\n\nShort circuit current (Isc) measurements were made using an epithelial voltage clamp and an adapted Ussing chamber system (Physiologic Instruments). Symmetrical buffer systems were used for measuring both the chloride and bicarbonate currents. The chloride buffer consisted of 135 mM NaCl, 2.4 mM K2HPO4, 0.6 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dextrose and 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) gassed with air at 37 °C. The bicarbonate buffer consisted of 118.9 mM sodium gluconate, 25 mM NaHCO3, 2.4 mM K2HPO4, 0.6 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM calcium gluconate, 1 mM magnesium gluconate and 5 mM dextrose (pH 7.4) gassed with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The following chemicals were sequentially added to the apical chamber: (1) 100 µM amiloride (to inhibit ENaC); (2) 100 µM DIDS (to inhibit non-CFTR anion channels); (3) 100 µM IBMX and 10 µM forskolin (cAMP agonists that stimulate CFTR); and (4) 10 µM GlyH101 (to block CFTR). The difference in the average plateau measurement for the Isc from 45 s before to 45 s after each stimulation was calculated and represented as the change of Isc (∆Isc) in response to the corresponding drug12. Data were collected using the software Acquire and Analyze v.2.3.\n\nWhole-mount ferret tracheal tissue electrophysiology\n\nAn Ussing chamber system (Physiologic Instruments) was used for measuring the electrophysiological properties of intact ferret tracheae. Ferret tracheae were maintained under warm F-12 medium (Gibco) during dissection. Briefly, ferret proximal tracheae were collected and mounted on pins in a ‘slider’ (P2304 slide) that fits between two halves of the chamber, being careful to only handle the edges of tissue. The tissue was then assembled into the Ussing chamber and secured by the pressure clamps. Symmetrical chloride buffer (135 mM NaCl, 2.4 mM K2HPO4, 0.6 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dextrose and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) was used and samples were maintained at 37 °C and bubbled with air. The following chemicals were sequentially added to the apical chamber: (1) 100 µM amiloride (to inhibit ENaC); (2) 100 µM DIDS (to inhibit non-CFTR anion channels); (3) 100 µM IBMX and 10 µM forskolin (cAMP agonists that stimulate CFTR); and (4) 10 µM GlyH101 (to block CFTR). Data were collected using the software Acquire and Analyze v.2.3.\n\nmRNA quantification using RT–qPCR\n\nTaqMan Real-Time PCR was used for quantification of mRNA. All primers and probes were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 8. Total RNA isolation was performed using the RNeasy Plus miniKit (Qiagen) and RNA concentration was measured using a Nanodrop or the Qubit assay. cDNA was then synthesized using a High-Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems).\n\nMeasurements of ASL height, pH, viscosity and fluid absorption rates in differentiated ferret ALI cultures\n\nFluid absorption rates and ASL height measurements\n\nFully differentiated ALI cultures were derived from wild-type, CFTR-KO (ref. 36) and FOXI1-KO primary tracheal basal cells. ASL height and fluid absorption rates were evaluated as previously described12. Briefly, excess mucus was removed from the apical surface of ALI cultures by washing in an excess of PBS and then they were equilibrated for about 16 h in a humidified, 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator before initiating the experiment. Then, 10,000 Da Texas red–dextran dye was applied (in 18 μl of PBS) to the apical surface of ALI cultures. XZ (line) images were then taken at five different rotational axes around the centre of the culture, immediately after dye was added and then again at various time points up to 24 h. While imaging on the confocal, the chamber remained humidified in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For absorption studies in the first hour after fluid addition, the chamber was not moved and one location was imaged on five directional axes. For ASL height measurements at 4 and 24 h, five locations around the centre of the Transwell were imaged on five rotational axes for each sample. The mean ASL height and volume/unit area of the Texas red–dextran dye were calculated for each XZ scan, and then the 25 values for each measurement were averaged for each Transwell. Fluid absorption rates were calculated as previously described12 by converting the ASL height into a uniform cylinder with defined volume and diameter. Graphs of the ASL volume versus time were then used to calculate the fluid absorption rates (nl min−1 cm−2) as the linear slope of the line generated during the first 20 min following fluid addition. Equilibrated ASL height was at 24 h.\n\nASL pH measurements\n\nFully differentiated ALI cultures were derived from wild-type, CFTR-KO (ref. 36) and FOXI1-KO primary tracheal basal cells. ASL pH was measured with slight modifications to that previously described15. In brief, the ratiometric pH indicator SNARF-conjugated dextran dye (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used to generate pH standard curves and directly measure apical pH on differentiated ALI cultures. ALI cultures were maintained in basolateral HCO3−-containing buffer and the microscope chamber was humidified in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. SNARF-conjugated dextran powder was directly applied to the apical surface through a 5 µm mesh. A confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 880) was used to excite the SNARF dye at 488 nm and measure fluorescence intensity at 580 nm and 640 nm from 6–8 areas of interest in each ALI culture. Fluorescence ratios were converted into pH values by using the standard curves as previously described43.\n\nASL viscosity measurements by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching\n\nFully differentiated ALI cultures were derived from wild-type, CFTR-KO (ref. 36) and FOXI1-KO primary tracheal basal cells. ASL viscosity was measured as previously described with minor modifications14. In brief, the apical surface of the cultured epithelium was washed with PBS 48 h before fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was performed (19 days of differentiation at ALI). FITC-dextran powder (70 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich) was then directly applied to the apical surface of ALI cultures using a 100 µm mesh. After 2 h, epithelial ASL viscosity was measured in a humidified chamber in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C using a confocal microscope (Zeiss 880). An 8 × 8 μm2 square region was photobleached by increasing the 488 nm laser intensity to 100%. Images were then acquired until maximal recovery was reached. Six to nine regions were selected for recovery curves from different locations in each Transwell. The fluorescence recovery half time (t1/2) was determined using Zeiss software FRAP.\n\nSingle-cell measurements of anion movement through pulmonary ionocytes\n\nA previously described halide-sensitive YFP-H148Q/I152L/F46L cDNA20 was used to replace EGFP in the pLenti-LoxP-sdRED-LoxP-EGFP plasmid (Addgene) for the generation of lentivirus (Extended Data Fig. 2c). FOXI1-CreERT2 and FOXI1-CreERT2::CFTRL/L ferret tracheal basal cells were virally transduced with Lenti-LoxP-dsRED-LoxP-YFP and selected by FACS for dsRED+ transduced cells. ALI cultures were established using these basal cells and then treated with 2 μM OH-Tam (Sigma-Aldrich) starting on day 14 and terminating 2 days before imaging. YFP-labelled ionocytes were then used for imaging studies at days 22–28 (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Anion transport measurements were adapted from previously described methods using this YFP sensor20 and used to study both anion absorption (apical→basolateral movement of iodide) and secretion (basolateral→apical movement of iodide). For all experiments, the microscope chamber was maintained in a 5% CO2 environment at 37 °C with or without humidification. Anion absorption studies: The basolateral side of ALI cultures was immersed in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.7 mM CaCl2, 1.1 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) while maintaining a humidified apical ALI, and baseline fluorescence intensity measurements were obtained. Cl− to I− exchange was then initiated by adding 18 μl of I− PBS buffer (137 mM NaI, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.7 mM CaCl2, 1.1 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) containing 100 µM IBMX/10 µM forskolin onto the apical surface of the culture as for fluid absorption studies. Similar conditions were used with the addition of 10 µM GlyH101 (to inhibit CFTR) or the exchange of Na-gluconate for Cl− to the apical 18 μl of PBS buffer. Ionocyte fluorescence intensity was obtained continuously using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 880) with HQ filter set (488 nm excitation, 514 nm emission). Anion secretion studies under humidified conditions: The basolateral side of ALI cultures was immersed in Cl− PBS and baseline measurements were obtained. Cl− to I− exchange was then initiated by perfusing the basolateral side with I− PBS containing 100 µM IBMX/10 µM forskolin. These experiments were performed under humified conditions. Anion secretion studies with dehydrated ASL: Cultures were perfused with non-humidified 5% CO2 for 20 min to dehydrate the ASL in the presence of basolateral Cl− PBS and baseline measurements were obtained. Cl− to I− exchange was then initiated by perfusing the basolateral side with I− PBS containing 100 µM IBMX/10 µM forskolin. Cl− PBS (18 μl) was then added to the apical chamber in the absence or presence of basolateral bumetanide (100 μM) to block NKCC1. To assess the apical Cl− dependence for basolateral I− uptake by ionocytes, 18 μl of gluconate PBS (137 mM sodium gluconate, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.7 mM CaCl2, 1.1 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) was added to the apical surface in place of Cl− PBS. Quantification of I− transport was assessed as area over the curve of the YFP fluorescence intensity traces normalized to the starting YFP intensity before buffer exchange. To quantify the differences in ion transport between different conditions and genotypes, we fitted an area under the curve calculation using the ‘pKNCA’ package in R and modified this calculation to area over the curve. Modified R scripts can be obtained upon request.\n\nFerret trachea μOCT imaging and quantitative analysis\n\nThe methods for μOCT and quantitative image analysis have been described previously in detail44,45. μOCT measurements were performed on wild-type and FOXI1-KO trachea tissue shipped overnight to the University of Alabama. In brief, the ASL depth, PCL depth, CBF and mucociliary transport rates were directly measured by μOCT without exogenous dyes. Real-time μOCT images were then processed for quantitative analysis. ASL depth and PCL depth were determined by geometric measurement in ImageJ. CBF was measured by Fourier analysis. Mucociliary transport rate was quantified by projecting a cross-sectional line through the mucus and using time elapsed over multiple layers. μOCT images were obtained at 5–8 randomly chosen locations on the mucosal surface of ferret proximal trachea.\n\nIdentification of unannotated ferret genes using mouse and human orthologues\n\nIn the NCBI Mustela putorius furo Annotation Release 102, only 16,579 (59.4%) of all 27,912 genes are properly annotated with gene symbols. We used the NCBI Entrez database to identify a further 825 genes that had annotated gene names or aliases, increasing the number of labelled genes to 17,404 (62.4%). Next, single gene sequences of ferret reference genome (MusPutFur1.0) from the Ensemble database were aligned with the human (GRCh38.p13) and mouse (GRCm39) genomes using the ‘msaClustalOmega’ function from the multiple sequence alignment (msa) package in R. Gene names of sequence alignments with identity greater than 40% were adopted to label any ferret gene that was unannotated in the NCBI Mustela putorius furo Annotation Release 102. EggNOG-mapper was run using the diamond algorithm on the protein sequences in the current reference. Orthologues mapping to ferret, mouse and human were written to an output file. In cases for which multiple orthologues from one species mapped, the orthologue with the highest score was picked. To combine the multiple species comparison file run on the Ensemble genome with the file run on the NCBI genome, Ensemble protein IDs were added to the multiple species comparison file using the GTF file. Next, the two files were combined using ‘merge’ in R on the Ensemble protein ID. Annotating ferret genes with their orthologues in this manner enabled identification of a further 1,655 genes, taking the total to 19,059 (68.3%) (Supplementary Table 10). As a result of these changes, the median read assignment in the scRNA-seq studies was 71.3% (Extended Data Fig. 4a).\n\nPreprocessing of droplet (10X) scRNA-seq data\n\nTo generate a digital gene expression matrix, we first performed demultiplexing of the raw sequencing data. Subsequently, we conducted pseudo-alignment of these demultiplexed reads to a custom reference genome. This reference genome was assembled by combining sequences for reporter proteins EGFP and tdTomato with NCBI Mustela putorius furo annotation release 102. During the process, unannotated genes were partially renamed as described above. Pseudo-alignment and unique molecular identifier (UMI)-collapsing were performed using the Kallisto toolkit (v.0.48)46. We estimated the number of non-empty droplets using the KneePlot function from the ‘DropletUtils’ package, which detected a total of 94,664 cells. For each cell, we quantified the number of detected genes (with at least one UMI), and then excluded all cells with fewer than 2,000 genes detected, resulting in 77,099 high-quality cells from n = 16 ALI cultures from n = 12 donor ferrets. Expression values Ei,j for gene i in cell j were calculated by dividing UMI count values for gene i by the sum of the UMI counts in cell j, to normalize for differences in coverage, and then multiplying by 10,000 to create TPM-like values, and finally calculating log2(TPM + 1) values, implemented using the NormalizeData function in the ‘Seurat’ R package. To merge all datasets together, batch correction was performed using the built-in data integration tool in Seurat v.3, using the ‘IntegrateData’ function47. The output was a corrected expression matrix, which was used as input for further analysis.\n\nData visualization, dimensionality reduction and clustering\n\nHighly variable genes were selected using a logistic regression fitted to the sample detection fraction, using the log of total number of UMIs for each gene as a predictor. Outliers from this curve are expressed in a lower fraction of samples than would be expected given the total number of reads mapping to that gene, that is, they are specific to a cell type, treatment, condition or state. The 2,000 most variable genes with greatest deviance were selected, both for analysis of the full dataset and for the subset of ionocytes. Principal component analysis was then computed using these variable genes, and scores for the top ten components were used to compute a nearest neighbour graph (k = 20) which was the input to clustering. To cluster single epithelial cells by their expression, we used the Louvain unsupervised clustering algorithm, as implemented with Seurat’s ‘FindClusters’ function. We used a resolution parameter of R = 1 on the main dataset of 77,099 cells. Clusters were mapped to cell types using known marker genes on the basis of human and mouse tracheal epithelial subsets (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Pulmonary ionocytes were subclustered to examine possible heterogeneity of mature types (Fig. 4). For subclustering of pulmonary ionocytes, we use R = 0.25 for ionocyte subtypes and defined three groups, which we annotated as type A, B and C ionocytes.\n\nDifferential expression and identification of cell-type markers\n\nAll differential expression testing was performed using a two-part ‘hurdle’ model to control for both technical quality and ferret-to-ferret variation, implemented using the R package MAST48, and likelihood-ratio test was used to assess the significance of differential expression. Multiple hypothesis testing correction was performed by controlling the FDR using the R function ‘p.adjust’49. To identify cell-specific genes, we used the procedure we have previously described50. Briefly, differential gene expression tests were performed between all pairwise combinations of clusters. For a given cell type, putative marker genes were ranked using two stringent criteria: maximum FDR Q-value (Qmax) and the minimum log2-transformed fold change (FCmin), which represent the weakest effect and significance across all comparisons. Cell type signature genes (Fig. 4, Extended Data Figs. 4 and 6 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 3) were obtained using a Qmax = 0.05 and FCmin = 0.25. To define signature genes for the more similar ionocyte subtypes, a more lenient criterion was used, an adjusted Fisher’s combined P value (QFisher) across the pairwise tests Qmax = 0.05 and FCmin = 0.25 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1). Ion channel lists were obtained from the Guide to Pharmacology (www.guidetopharmacology.org), University of Edinburgh, UK51.\n\nTesting for differences in cell-type proportions\n\nTo assess the significance of changes in the fraction of cells under different conditions, we used Bayesian negative binomial regression, estimated using the R package ‘brms’. This enabled us to model the number of each cell type detected in each donor and to test the effect of genetic perturbations while controlling for variability among biological replicates (donor ferrets). For each cell type, we modelled the number of cells detected in each donor as a random count variable using a negative binomial distribution. The rate of detection (that is, the relative proportion of that cell type) was modelled by using the natural log of the total number of all cells profiled from a given donor as an offset term (Extended Data Fig. 4d). To test the effect of FOXI1 deletion, donor genotype was added to regression models as a categorical covariate (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Significance of changes in cell-type proportions was assessed using the 90%, 95% and 99% posterior credible intervals for the main effect of the genotype covariate.\n\nProportion of CFTR-expressing airway epithelial cells\n\nTo assess the significance of changes in proportion of CFTR-expressing airway epithelial cells between wild-type (both FOXI1-CreER FACS-enriched and unenriched samples) and FOXI1-KO samples (Extended Data Fig. 6i), we aggregated cells from all samples together rather than averaging the proportion over samples. Some samples showed low proportions of certain cell types. This causes samples with low numbers of certain cell types to spuriously bring down the average proportion of CFTR-expressing cells (for example, a single ionocyte in a non-enriched sample, resulting in a CFTR-expressing proportion of 0%). The R package ‘prop.test’ v.3.6.2 was used to calculate statistical significance. Because of the statistical approach used, it was not possible to plot the individual data points on the graphs in Extended Data Fig. 6i.\n\nInterspecies comparison of rare cell-type transcriptomes\n\nTo compare rare cell types (Fig. 5), single-cell data from cultured ferret airway epithelial cells (this study) were merged with published single-cell data from mouse trachea1 and human airway epithelial cells52, and merged using Seurat data integration as described above. Before running dimensionality reduction, all genes that were strongly different by species were identified using a one-way ANOVA. Genes with an F statistic over the 90th percentile (indicating high confidence of differential expression by species) were removed. Cell-type labels (Fig. 5a) were taken from the respective studies, along with species annotation (Fig. 5b). To compute the transcriptional similarity between rare cell types from each species, all pairwise cell–cell Pearson correlations across the set of variable genes (defined as above) were computed, and then aggregated using the mean in each cell type and species combination (Fig. 5i).\n\nPseudotime analysis using PAGA and elastic principal graphs\n\nWe isolated the 1,497 tuft cells, ionocytes and PNECs from our ferret scRNA-seq data to examine the progression from their putative common progenitor to mature rare epithelial subsets. The PAGA algorithm34, implemented using scanpy53, was used to project cells into a low-dimensional manifold, after defining unsupervised clusters generated using the Leiden algorithm54. Elastic principal graphs35 were then used to fit a branching tree through the PAGA co-ordinate space. Spurious single-node branches were removed. The node in the rare progenitor cluster was manually selected as the root node for pseudotime calculation, computed using the ElPiGraph R package.\n\nValidation of transcriptional signatures using RNAscope\n\nThe ferret trachea and lung were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 18–24 h. After postfixation, tissues were cryoprotected in sucrose, embedded as frozen OCT blocks and then cut into 7–15-μm-thick sections. RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) was used per the manufacturer’s recommendations. The multiplex RNAscope assay uses three probe sets against three target molecules (CFTR, FOXI1, EGFP) and markers of ionocytes subtypes in various combinations (type A: CFTR, FOXI1, SLC12A2 or BSND; type B: CFTR, KRT7, EGFP); probes are referred to as channel 1, channel 2 and channel 3 probes, respectively. All amplification and detection steps were done using the kit instructions. Finally, the multiplex assay probe sets were detected with Fluorescein (channel 1), Cyanine3 (channel 2) and Cyanine5 (channel 3). Images of tissues were acquired with a confocal microscope (Zeiss 880 or Zeiss 980). Scale bars were added to each image using ImageJ. Images were visualized using ImageJ software. Probes used for RNAscope (Advanced Cell Diagnostics): CFTR (C1), EGFP (C2), SLC12A2 (C2), BSND (C2), KRT7 (C3) and FOXI1 (C3).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAll non-bioinformatic experimental results are presented as the mean ± s.e.m., and R 4.2.0 (www.r-project.org) and Prism 9 (GraphPad) were used for statistical analysis. Student’s t-test and one-way ANOVA were performed when appropriate. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis of scRNA-seq data is described in the bioinformatics section.\n\nMaterials availability\n\nAll unique and stable reagents and transgenic ferrets generated in this study are available under institutional MTA without restriction to non-for-profit institutions from the corresponding authors.\n\nReporting summary"
