        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 16, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- When Rostrum Records' Mac Miller took the Number One spot in the country with his debut release Blue Slide Park this morning, it was a watershed moment for his San Francisco-based digital distribution and marketing partner INgrooves, physical distribution partner Fontana and for independent artists around the world. Blue Slide Park is the first independent debut album to take the top spot on the chart in 15 years. The last independent debut album to reach #1 was 1995's Dogg Food album by Tha Dogg Pound.\n\nAs digital music sales continue to represent a larger and larger portion of artists' overall album sales, a digitally-focused distribution company like INgrooves, which is a veteran player in the space and one of the largest digital distributors in the world, becomes a logical partner for independent labels and for artists who engage their fans directly. On the physical side, Fontana's expertise as an award-winning independent marketing, sales and distribution company, helped push the album to a #1 sales spot this week with targeted marketing efforts with retailers.\n\n\"This is a big moment for the independent music community,\" said Dave Zierler, EVP & General Manager, INgrooves. \"Rostrum and Mac are proof that a digitally-focused independent effort works in today's dynamic music marketplace, by engaging fans directly and maximizing availability to all consumers via our global online retail network.\"\n\n\"We're thrilled to be a part of this history-making album. The evolving commercial landscape calls for changes in the way that music is marketed and the success of Blue Slide Park shows a great understanding of social media, by all those involved,\" stated Ron Spaulding, President of Fontana. \"To be a part of this success is very gratifying. I see it as a vote of confidence for the independent music industry.\"\n\n\"We wanted to release this album independently and on our own terms,\" said Benjy Grinberg, President of Rostrum Records. \"INgrooves and Fontana have been great partners for Rostrum on this project, and the current success of Blue Slide Park is a true testament that it's possible for us to compete as an independent on a grander scale.\"\n\nWith more than a million Twitter followers and videos on YouTube approaching a total of nearly 100 Million views, Rostrum Records helped Mac build a huge fanbase online, which made a digital partnership with INgrooves even more logical. In fact Soundscan shows that Mac sold 76% of his total 144,487 sales last week through online retailers. INgrooves' relationship with indie veteran Fontana created the perfect digital and physical distribution partnership by which to propel the album to a first place finish.\n\nAbout INgrooves\n\nINgrooves (parent company, Isolation Network, Inc.) is a leading provider of digital distribution, marketing and promotion services to the global music and video communities via its ONE Digital platform.
