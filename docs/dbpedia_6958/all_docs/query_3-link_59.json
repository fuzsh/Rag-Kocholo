        "text": "1.\n\nTech Support For Dad 03:20\n\nIt had been a long-ass work week, it had been a long-ass day, I was hoping I could just go home and sleep the night away. But the message waiting for me was the worst a man could know: \"Hi there, son, could you call me back? My computer's running slow.\" There are bamboo shoots and water torture, German blondes named Gert, Films with Adam Sandler and lots of other things that hurt, But it's not my job or girlfriend that finally drove me mad, I've been on the phone long-distance doing tech support for Dad. It took seven tries to get him to the Start menu and Run, He had Bonzi Buddy, Comet Cursor, and Quicktime 3.1. I said I'd try to find out if his firewall had been breached, Turned out he'd bought this Compaq before Clinton was impeached. Service packs and driver updates, he needs every single thing, And he gets online by dial-up, so he might be done by spring, But he trusts that I can fix it, his beloved college grad, Never mind it was in Russian, now I'm tech support for Dad. After thirty seven reboots, and a dozen clean installs, My room is trashed, my plants are dead, and there's green slime on the walls But his 'puter's running smoothly, I can finally get away, When he says, \"Oh, yeah, son, one more thing -- how do you sell stuff on eBay?\" Here's a pox on all programmers, puttin' crapware on your shelves, May you have to teach your programs to your dads by phone yourselves, There's the Normandy Invasion, and the Siege of Leningrad, And the special hell filling in for Dell as tech support for Dad. Now I've built him a computer, nothing can get in or out, The firewall's adamantium, and the drives are sealed with grout, And if this one starts to run slow, well, that's just too damn bad, 'Cause I'd rather shave my eyeballs than do tech support for Dad. Tech support for Dad. Tech support for Dad. \"Hang on, son -- your mom wants to know how to set up a web page.\"\n\n2.\n\nEULA Dancing 03:03\n\nWe welcome you to our beautiful island And lift your spirit with our traditional island song. Koma will translate. Naha nehi / neh-a lei-a he mi / ay ma maia me hanni ney hey naha nehi / neh-a alli wa hai / mia meh-a me hanni oo eh Important -- Listen Carefully.

Mia me hey / we with the N S A / we record what you say on the phone So you might like / to speak into the mike / if someday you apply for a loan You agree that the band may collect personal data from you.

Naha me hey / in the U S of A / breaker breaker good buddy ten four Thank you for play / ing, now please go away / don't let yourself get hit by the door If you heard this song in the United States, this license is governed by the laws of the State of Hawaii. If you heard this song in Canada, you are obviously a music pirate, as we have never been to Canada and don't sell records there. The Mounties are on their way over right now; please wait for their arrival and DO NOT DESTROY THE EVIDENCE. Nahi neh hi / neh-a lei-a he mi / iy ma maia me hanni ney hi listen to Ray / Charles sing \"what you say\" / na na na na, hey hey, goodbye This EULA is the entire agreement between you and the band. If you have questions about any part of this agreement, it's too late. There's nobody here to talk to, and if there were we wouldn't answer the phone. Aloha.... Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball.\n\n3.\n\nBoyfriend Points 04:49\n\nThe young man climbed the mountain Where the old man waited for him. The young man's face was hopeful, The old man's face was grim. The young man said, \"I've come here To learn the secrets of life, Can you help me find destiny, Can you help me get a wife?\" The old man looked at him closely, Didn't make a move or a sound, He was certain he could take the kid And the body would never be found. But, no, he was a guru, Of wisdom, he was a font, And he said, \"It's just what you deserve, I'll tell you what you want. Everything you've ever feared of women is true Everything you ever think or say or do Is memorized and analyzed and scrutinized so it's unwise To give them ammunition to use on you. Go for boyfriend points, that's the key Boyfriend points, that's what she'll see Boyfriend points, with every action Boyfriend points, a big distraction Offer your umbrella, pull her chair out, hold the door, You need boyfriend points, if you want to score. Flowers get you fifteen, candy gets you ten, An upright vacuum, meet a new girl, start again. Don't forget her birthday, or even worse, don't ever look inside her purse What's in there is not for the eyes of men. Go for boyfriend points, don't kill those squirrels, Boyfriend points, quote Gilmore Girls, Boyfriend points, emote and feel, Boyfriend points, COOK A MEAL!? Romance is a contest, and romance is the prize, You need boyfriend points to beat the other guys. Don't leave her Shakespeare in the rain or use her ferret to clean the drain, Don't say that you're a Browncoat when you're not. Agree that Oprah Winfrey's nice, watch Brokeback Mountain with her twice, And nod when she says Daniel Radcliffe's hot Don't put Lunchables in her CD-ROM or list her mom on MILF dot com, Don't make fun of her Hello Kitty stuff, And there's one sure way to murder Cupid, tell her, 'Honey, That's So Stupid' -- If you do that, you can't run fast enough.\" The young man thanked the old man and went back to town, Followed his advice and learned something more profound: Treating women like they are a prize with lame-ass lines and dumb-ass lies Means someone DIES, and his body was never found. Go for boyfriend points if you got no clue, Boyfriend points will come back at you, boyfriend points, tryin' to be so cool, Boyfriend points, when you kiss you drool, If the battle of the sexes has become an all-out war, Boyfriend points ain't gonna help you score.\n\n4.\n\nHyperspace Cryogenic Insomnia Blues 04:14\n\nHere I am in hypersleep Awaiting my awakening, I'm travelling near the speed of light To our new colony, Except I'm trying to figure out How come I'm still awake when they Assured me I would be unconscious -- Oh well, must be me. Maybe I should think about My S.O. in the next tube over, How we're gonna celebrate The day we finally land Well, actually, that night or maybe Later 'cause we'll be unpacking I'll think about that later, When I can move my hand. Wish I had a bedtime story I could read to make me sleep, One of the Harry Potter books, Or maybe Dr. Suess I do not like green eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam I am, I do not like them with a goat, Or a majestic moose. Mind you, a moose once bit my sister. How horribly she was attacked, Moose bites can be pretty nasty Those responsible have been sacked. Hey there, NASA, have you heard the news? I'm awake in my deep freeze, thinkin' bout a stupid moose, I've got the hyperspace cryogenic insomnia blues. Hum hum hum hum hm hum hum hum, Hum hm hum hum hummmm hm hum, Menahmenah dee dee de dee dee Menahmenah dee dee de dee Menahmenah dee dee de dee dee It's a small world after all, That's why we left that mudball, Hypersleeping in free fall To a new world after all. Menahmenah dee dee de dee dee Menahmenah dee dee de dee Wish I had some NyQuil here, Or maybe just a keg of beer, Or my S.O. in something sheer, Or Salma Hayek, what a rear.... Baby got back, Baby got back, Baby got back.... I'm back to the future again, I hope I'll sleep but I don't know when, Of course if I wake up too soon, It's cause we hit some alien moon -- I'm crashed in the spaceship again. Menahmenah dee dee de dee dee Menahmenah dee dee de dee Oh good, I see a status light, To tell me where we are in flight We're two weeks out of Terran orbit, Ten years left to go.... Lesser men would go insane, But I'm the one who runs this brain -- Don't have to work and not in pain, I'll be just fine, I know. Please God, I beg you, let me die, The solitude is more than I Can handle for ten minutes, Let alone a whole decade. There's no one there to set me free, And worse than this captivity: My sweetie's sleeping next to me And we cannot get laid! I need you, more than anyone darlin', But right now I can't even weep, So suck it up, buttercup -- go back to sleep. Menahmenah dee dee de dee dee Menahmenah dee dee de dee....\n\n5.\n\nInsert Geek Cliche Here 03:25\n\nI've got a hundred thousand comics carefully collected, And all the action figures for 'em carefully selected, The posters and promotions for each superhero movie, My ringtone's Frank N. Furter and Ash saying \"Groovy\", I've got each permutation of the XBox and PlayStation, My anime collection is the finest in the nation, If you wonder why I worked so hard to get geek cred, Well, I can't remember either, I'll have this crap till I'm dead! Insert geek cliche here (geek is the new \"kinda cool\", now) Losing streak of the year (I still get beaten up in school, now) Social freak full of fear (all the girls still think I'm a tool, now) Insert geek cliche here. George Lucas had Darth Vader in his Tie fighter to strafe us, Spielberg had Indy, E.T., Jaws and Richard Dreyfuss, Hawking, Sagan, Feynman, Gates and Wozniak and Jobs, The world is ruled by skinny doofs and nonathletic blobs. I have no skills or talent, and I don't know where to start, A real idiot savant, without the \"savant\" part. But I figure I can be successful like those other nerds, As long as I've got all the toys and shout out all the words. Insert geek cliche here (I get every new DVD, now) I fill six rooms with my gear (Amazon delivers daily to me, now) Watch my cash disappear (my credit score is three, now) Insert geek cliche here. I've got GURPS and D&D, every volume and edition I've got a million Magic cards, I'm still not a magician, Costumes, props, and make-up from every sci-fi show ever made, I actually thought that buying all this stuff might get me laid. And so I stalk around the internet in search of any plunder And where it's gonna lead me, you don't really have to wonder My finances are ruined so I live on beets and porridge My house is in foreclosure and my toys are all in storage The eBay people hate me, and they will not do my bidding, And I won't go and sell the stuff -- come on now, are you kidding? But don't misunderstand, I haven't found my inner geek, I can't afford a laundromat and all my clothes reek. Insert geek cliche here (I thought it would be so cool now) It's not chic, it's just queer (haven't been outside since Yule, now) Livin' on taquitos and beer (fall asleep and start to drool, now) Insert geek cliche here.\n\n6.\n\nam the most trusted man in Nigeria, In me they have no doubt, For every day e-mail from Nigeria Asks me to help out.

So I go cuddlin wit a stuffed bear Gettin peanut butter all over my hair Sprawled in a sunbeam, swattin at flies Trapped in the laundry wit big sad eyes Lickin at toesies, scratchin at fleas \"I can has cheezeburger, peese?\" Mom still doin her photo shoot, Good thing my little furry butt is cute Stickin my nose in an empty dish Lookin for an invisible fish I has no idea what you just said So here's me with a pancake on my head Cat macros. Now I is songcat singin this bridge From my stage on top o' da fridge I is only two years of age But I got my own MySpace page Da silly pictures people wants But only wit impact fonts I keep dis up, but for how long?

There's eggs from last summer, cream cheese from last fall, A six-week-old soft pretzel bought at the mall, Some Ziploc blew up, there's gray crud on the wall, And it all has died in my fridge. Raise a toast to these bagels and loxes That I stuck here, and stuck's what it is. At least seven carryout boxes Are glued to the shelf with Cheez Whiz. I no longer recognize this mayonnaise, I think this was beef with a fine demi glace, And the gherkins are moving in interesting ways -- It's been days since I opened my fridge. There's green in the orange juice, blue in the pork, That wine bottle's trembling, better not pull the cork, And the barbecued brisket won't give back the fork, I'm a dork who must clean out his fridge. As the whole house is filled with miasma From the foodstuffs that Tom forgot, I'm just glad that I don't suffer asthma, My clothing's beginning to rot. Those chicken breast halves that I took out to thaw Now violate hazardous materials law, And the hummus declared war on Mother's cole slaw... I withdraw the whole mess from my fridge. Now I've scrubbed the thing white, but the stench is still there, Ancient pasta and sauerkraut scorching the air, So if you want a beer, well, it's in there somewhere.... Say a prayer, crack it open a smidge, If you dare, it's right there in my fridge.\n\n9.\n\nSpoiler Alert 03:02\n\nI have a good friend who I talk to a lot About books or movies or whatever's hot, But lately she tells me that she'd rather not, Just because she ain't seen 'em when I spill the plot. She says, \"Spoiler Alert, Spoiler Alert, Like too much asparagus spoils your dessert, I want to discover this stuff by myself, I had no idea Mr. Smith was an elf.\" And he and Frodo jump into the Matrix, and meet Dumbledore the White, And this really hot babe named Trinity, who fights vampires with Wesley Snipes. Or Wolverine -- I can never keep those two straight.... It isn't my fault I read faster than she, Or catch all the previews they show on TV, Or download the movies so fast the cops blanch Or hack the computers at Skywalker Ranch. Okay, that one might be a little my fault. She says, \"Spoiler alert, spoiler alert, Sit down and shut up or you're gonna get hurt, I want to discover this stuff on my own, And it's hard to strangle you over the phone.\" Leia's his sister, and Vader's his dad, What could I have said that would make her so mad? Norman Bates' mom is dead, Bruce Willis is a ghost, And Jesus comes back three days after he's toast. One day she came over, grinning with glee, And said \"Now you'll know how it feels to be me, I have here the pictures, the scripts and the proof, King Kong beats Godzilla, and that is the truth. And then Kong takes a grappling gun, And he shoots it up at the International Space Station, And he climbs up there, and he's waving his arms around, bellowing, And he's holding either Milla Jovavich, Tea Leoni, or Paris Hilton in a skintight body suit (Although it's airless space so you can't actually hear him bellowing, And she's s'damn skinny you can't tell it's skintight). And then Richard Hatch comes -- Not the Survivor guy but the good one -- And he and Starbucks offer Kong some Mocha Chocalatta Ya Ya, Which Kong bats away with one swipe of his mighty paw, And so they send up their ancient biplane Tie fighters (Which don't have computers so the Vorlons can't control them), And they shoot him down and he falls all the way to earth, lands on top of a Zippo lighter factory, And Jack Black looks down and says, 'It was Butane killed the beast'.\" Spoiler Alert, Spoiler Alert, I was wrong, I'm sorry, check out my hair shirt. I finally get it, I want to stay friends, And so I'm not telling you how this song.\n\n10.\n\nGarlic Is For Lovers 04:19\n\n(to be sung with the best/worst Italian accent you can muster) Hey there, all you fellows Who don't understand romance, All that money you spend, like you're buying a friend With candy and dead plants, With jewelry and chocolate, you're gonna be broke a lot Even with a cash advance, So let me explain how you use your brain To dance the mating dance. You invite her over to your house, For a quiet dinner for two, You make a big plate o' fettucini alfredo Or maybe beef ragu, She gets one whiff of that, and you know where it's at, Whether she's the girl for you, She'll say, \"Ho! That reeks!\" -- or else, \"Hm - add more leeks, And a bulb that's roasted through.\" Garlic is for lovers, That's what a man adores, She's nice and sweet: The girl who eats Till it's oozing out her pores. In etoufee or creme brulee, In Twinkees or S'Mores, Garlic is for lovers, I've got mine -- have you got yours? Garlic is for sweethearts, That's what the angels sing, So you don't look stupid when that meshuggenah Cupid Makes you give her a ring. If garlic-breath kisses don't chase her off, this is No doubt the real thing, Garlic is for lovers, Like onions in the spring. Some people think it's a bad thing, Some people think it's not nice, Some people think that garlic, she stink, They want some other wimpy spice. But nutmeg and cinnamon's for cookies, Paprika and saffron's for stew, Cayenne and cumin's for ordinary humans, but Garlic's for me and you. Garlic is for lovers, Sharing a warm embrace, That's why I brought a fresh-made bagna cauda And veal demi-glace. If you might get crampy when I get Shrimp Scampi, Keep back at least ten pace, Garlic is for lovers Who get really kissy-face. Garlic is for lovers Who don't need breathing space. (Alternate last lines:) Garlic is for lovers With no issues 'bout personal space. Garlic is for lovers, Who love right up in your face.\n\n11.\n\nCYA 05:33\n\nIt's ten o'clock on a Thursday And the regular FuMP song ain't done So they give me a ring, they know I'll have something Finished by eleven fifty-one. Rob Balder is silly, and wears great nerd glasses, And Devo does techno-geek rap, But me, I'm here to cover their asses When the other guys run out of crap. I've got a rep for fast songwork, But the pressure sometimes is intense, I write and I mix with some audio tricks And I pray that the damn thing makes sense. Luke Ski is ambitious, so many huge plans, The Gothsicles have them as well But me, I'm here to cover their cans When everything goes all to hell. Now Possible Oscar have talent, Musicianship seeps from their pores, But when in the schedule they're over their heads, they'll Pound my metaphorical doors. The Bards go on tour from Midsummer to Easter And Raymond and Scum all year long, But me, I'm here to cover their keisters When instantly they need a song. When Seamonkey's lost in the bushes And Paul and Storm bust their balloons Me, I'm here to cover their tushes So Doctor Demento has tunes. When Coulton is touring and MC Lars is Too busy to throw stuff our way Me, I'm here to cover their arses Here I come to save the day. When Carrie and Carla are both going nuts, When Shoebox's keyboard just croaks, Me, I'm here to cover their butts And hopefully make up new jokes. And now that I've shown you what brass is, I think that we're at the last line, It's really no problem to cover their asses, Someday I'll ask them to do mine.\n\n12.\n\nUltimate Ultimate Christmas 04:53"
