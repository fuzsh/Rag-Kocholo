        "text": "US music distributor\n\nFontana Distribution was a division of San Franciscoâ€“based Isolation Network (now owned by the Virgin Music Group unit of the Universal Music Group since 2019). A minority stake of the company was owned by Universal Music until Ingrooves acquired Fontana Distribution from UMG in 2012 to form Ingrooves Fontana.[1]\n\nIn 2019, Universal Music Group acquired Fontana's owner, Ingrooves, returning Fontana back to UMG. A year later, Fontana Distribution was folded into Caroline Distribution, acquired in 2013 via Universal's purchase of EMI, which, another year later, was rebranded as Virgin Music Label & Artist Services.[2][3]\n\nProfile\n\n[edit]\n\nFontana deals in distribution, as well as in a range of sales, marketing, and back office support services, for a diverse roster of independent record labels and their artists.[4] The company takes its name and logo from the Fontana Records label; it was initially launched by Universal Music Group in 2004 and later sold[5] to Isolation Network in 2012. The company includes a UK-based operation, Fontana International, which handles territories outside of North America.[6] The company also has a joint venture in Canada with Cadence Music Group known as Fontana North. The company is the successor of PolyGram's Independent Label Sales (ILS), previously known as Island Trading Co., which folded after the 1999 merger of the MCA and PolyGram families of labels that created Universal Music Group.\n\nFontana Distribution has been known to successfully round up albums worldwide from national Universal Music Group companies for American release or for distribution into further territories. Fontana Distribution also partners with Executive Music Group, Chicago Independent Distribution, and Twenty Two Music Group Distribution, which in turn distribute other independent labels.\n\nDuring the acquisition of EMI (including EMI Music Distribution), Universal Music Group decided to retain Caroline Distribution and later sold Fontana Distribution to Isolation Network.\n\nAfter the acquisition of Ingrooves by Universal, Fontana was folded into Caroline, which was renamed Virgin Music Label & Artist Services in 2021.\n\nFontana Distribution-affiliated labels\n\n[edit]\n\nFontana Distribution is affiliated with more than 30 labels, including the following:\n\nDivisions\n\n[edit]\n\nFontana Distribution\n\nFontana Label Services\n\nFontana International\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nFontana North\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
