        "text": "FONTANA >> As the number of people who shop online rises, so does demand for more distribution centers in the region, like the one that opened Thursday in Fontana to help speed up e-commerce delivery times.\n\nThe Arizona-based OnTrac overnight package delivery company held a dedication ceremony for the opening of its largest warehouse, in Fontana, out of a network of 40 centers it manages throughout eight western states.\n\nThe new facility, at just under 600,000-square-feet, becomes the second major hub in Southern California, after its 300,000-square-foot hub in Commerce.\n\n“This facility improves our efficiency because now we’ve got a large enough facility to sort the packages right here in the Fontana area, as opposed to driving them to a facility farther away in Commerce,” said Laura Peterson, vice president of marketing for OnTrac.\n\nOnTrac previously had a distribution facility in Ontario, which was open from 2010 to 2016. Officials said they closed that facility in order to handle more delivery volume at the new Fontana location. OnTrac is subleasing a portion of the new facility and is utilizing 440,000-square-feet of it, officials said.\n\n“We can handle over 8,000 packages an hour in this building and that increased through-put not only helps this facility but it helps every facility downstream throughout he network, throughout California and throughout the states that we service,” said Jim Brownlow, director of operations development for OnTrac, at the warehouse on Thursday. “We can handle twice the amount of packages in the same amount of time and be able to get packages through our network to the destination for on time deliveries.”\n\nOnTrac officials plan to fully automate the facility in 2018. But Brownlow, said the increased efficiency will increase the amount of packages coming through, thus facilitating the need for more employees. The facility currently employees 300.\n\n“Our through-put, or the amount of packages we handle in an hour, is going to more than triple (next year), so the people we’re going to (employ) might increase by 50 to 60 percent,” Brownlow said.\n\nPhil Cothran, president of the Fontana Chamber of Commerce, welcomed the additional job opportunities for residents from the new OnTrac facility.\n\n“Fontana is centrally located along our freeway system, between the ports and the rest of the country, and so whenever we can attract a company like this that can bring as many jobs as they’re bringing, it’s great,” Cothran said at the opening ceremony. “Jobs are so important to the fabric of the community.”\n\nOnline shopping is creating increased demand for OnTrac’s business and takes up the largest share of deliveries, said Mikel Mobley, director of sales at the Fontana facility.\n\n“Online orders are definitely our biggest industry segment,” Mobley said. “I would say it’s 75 percent.”\n\nPeterson agreed.\n\n“As a company, we’re actually tipping the scales to more residential deliveries,” Peterson said."
