        "text": "Richard Biggs had a somewhat unsettled childhood as he travelled between Air Force bases where his father was stationed. Because of his itinerant lifestyle he made few friends and changed schools often. When he was seventeen, and living at a missile base in North Dakota, he decided to change his plans for a medical career after playing the lead in a local theatrical production of 'The Wiz'. After that, bitten by the acting bug and never deterred by deafness in one ear, he went on to complete a Bachelor of Fine Arts (majoring in performing arts) at USC's School of Theatre, with the distinguished actor John Houseman as one of his drama teachers. He later went on to give his own acting classes at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga Canyon.\n\nLike so many other aspiring performers, Richard had a tough time in his quest to get started in his chosen field. His chief difficulty lay in obtaining membership in the Screen Actor's Guild without experience, yet how was one to acquire experience without a union card ? Living in his car for much of this time, he made ends meet by playing small roles on stage, and, occasionally television. He also worked for a while as a telephone operator answering complaints for an LA waste disposal company. One of his local stage performances, as Romeo at the Ensemble Theatre, impressed an agent who took him on and landed him an audition for a part on the daytime soap opera Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965). Several auditions later, he got the part, and the SAG card as well.\n\nFor most of his career on television, Richard played doctors, an irony which was probably not lost on him: Dr.Tomson in Unbekannte Dimensionen (1985), Dr. Lecksis in Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990), Dr.Milo Morton in \"Strong Medicine\", and, of course, Dr.Marcus Hunter, in 1295 episodes of 'Days of Our Lives', from 1985 to 1992. Richard had done his homework for the part by observing a real plastic surgeon in action. However, having played the same individual for such a lengthy period led him later to express doubts about the one-dimensional 'goody two-shoes' nature of the character, who he would have preferred a little 'rougher around the edges'.\n\nA far edgier and more complex part was that of Dr.Stephen Franklin, the chief medical officer of J. Michael Straczynski's cult sci-fi series Babylon 5 (1993). Richard played the humanly flawed, but mercurial character from 1994 to 1998 (also in three made-for-TV movies, and, briefly, in the short-lived spin-off series Crusade (1999), as part of a first-rate ensemble cast. His performances were often extremely compelling, particularly in the 'walkabout' episodes of season three, culminating with 'Shadow Dancing'.\n\nPost-Babylon, Richard played a detective in Alabama Dreams (1998), returned to soap opera as Clayton Boudreaux in Springfield Story (1952) and had a brief run as a scientist in the unsuccessful TV spin-off Tremors (2003). The character in his last series, Strong Medicine: Zwei Ã„rztinnen wie Feuer und Eis (2000), was killed off in the show because of the actor's tragic, untimely death at the age of 44. Richard Biggs was eulogised by Babylon 5's Straczysnky as a 'consummate professional' and 'quite simply, a terrific guy'.\n\nMajel Barrett (born Majel Leigh Hudec) was an American actress, known for her long association with Star Trek. She had multiple Star Trek-related roles, though she is mostly remembered for her roles as Nurse Christine Chapel in Star Trek, The Original Series (1966-1969) and as Lwaxana Troi in Star Trek, The Next Generation (1987-1994) and Deep Space Nine (1993-1999). Due to her status as the second wife of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991), Barrett was nicknamed \"the First Lady of Star Trek\".\n\nIn 1932, Barrett was born in Cleveland, Ohio. Her father was police officer William Hudec (d. 1955), who was eventually killed while on duty. Barrett had aspirations of becoming an actress since childhood, and took acting classes as a child. She received her secondary education at the Shaker Heights High School, a public high school located in a suburb of Cleveland, and graduated in 1950 at the age of 18. She then enrolled at the University of Miami, a public research university located in Coral Gables, Florida.\n\nFollowing her graduation from university, started a career as a theatrical actress. In 1955, she was on tour with an off-Broadway road company. She had her first film role in the satirical film \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" (1957), which parodied the advertising industry, among other targets of satire. Barrett appeared in an uncredited bit part in a satirical advertisement within the film. Barrett's first credited film role was that Joyce Goodwin, a novice teacher depicted in the high school drama film \"As Young as We Are\" (1958). The film focuses on a male student who falls in love with his young, female teacher, and resorts to kidnapping her.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Barrett had small roles in the romantic comedy \"Love in a Goldfish Bowl\" (1961) and the World War II-themed war film \"The Quick and the Dead\" (1963), and appeared in guest star roles in then-popular television series, such as \"Leave It to Beaver\", \"The Lucy Show\", and \"Bonanza\". She was often employed by the television production company Desilu Productions, which at the time was owned by veteran actress Lucille Ball (1911-1989).\n\nOne of the television shows she appeared in was an episode of \"The Lieutenant\" (1964). This short-lived series created and written by Gene Roddenberry provided his first meetings and workings with many of the actors who would later become regulars and guest stars of Star Trek, including its two pilots. Barrett and Roddenberry befriended each other, and eventually started a romantic relationship. Roddenberry was still married to Eileen-Anita Rexroat, but often pursued relationships with other women.\n\nIn 1964, Roddenberry was working on the original pilot for Star Trek. He cast Barrett in the role of \"Number One\", the unnamed first officer of the star-ship USS Enterprise. Number One was depicted as exceptionally intelligent and strictly rational, but seemingly unemotional. The episode hinted at a mutual attraction between Number One and her captain, Christopher Pike (played by Jeffrey Hunter). The alien Talosians try to force them to mate with each other, as part of a breeding project.\n\nThis pilot was rejected by NBC executives, who complained about several aspects of the episode. One of them was the characterization of Number One, who was disliked for being overly assertive. In the subsequent retooling of the series, Number One was written out. Her character traits were added to that of a male character, Spock (played by Leonard Nimoy). Spock went on to become one of the franchise's most popular characters, due in large part to his coldly rational behavior.\n\nStill determined to cast Barrett in the series, Roddenberry later created a more traditionally feminine role for her. The role was that of Nurse Christine Chapel, depicted as the main assistant of Dr. Leonard McCoy (played by DeForest Kelley). Chapel was one of the main recurring characters in the series for three years. She was one of the earliest prominent female characters in Star Trek.\n\nIn 1969, \"Star Trek\" was canceled. Barrett and Rodenberry briefly parted ways. Later that year, Rodenberry was in Japan on business. He realized that he missed Barrett and invited her to join him in Japan. On August 6, 1969, the two had a traditional Shinto wedding ceremony. This wedding was unofficial, as Roddenberry's divorce had not been finalized yet. Following the end of the divorce process, the two were officially married on December 29, 1969. Barrett served as a stepmother to Dawn Roddenberry (b.1953), Gene's teenage daughter. Dawn moved into the new couple's residence, and Barrett helped in her upbringing.\n\nAlready known for her science fiction roles, Barrett was cast as female android Miss Carrie in the science fiction-Western \"Westworld\". Her character was the madame of the Westworld bordello. Barrett also had roles in the post-apocalyptic television film \"Genesis II\" (1973) and the science fiction television film \"The Questor Tapes\" (1974), both created and scripted by her husband.\n\nStar Trek was revived with the sequel series \"Star Trek: The Animated Series\" (1973-1974), which used much of the main cast from the original series. Barrett voiced two of the series' main female characters, Christine Chapel and M'Ress. The new character M'Ress was depicted as a female alien in feline form, who served as an officer on the Enterprise. Barrett also voiced many of this series' female guest characters.\n\nBarrett had a small role in the neo-noir film \"The Domino Principle\" (1977). The film depicted a secretive organization first helping a prisoner escape, and then trying to force him to serve as their newest assassin. When the escaped man refuses, a lethal struggle begins. This film was poorly received due to its convoluted plot.\n\nBarrett's next notable role was the housekeeper Lilith in the horror film \"Spectre\" (1977). Her character is depicted as a practicing witch, who manages to cure the alcoholic tendencies of one of the main characters. The plot of film depicts the demon Asmodeus assuming a human form and identity, while two occult detectives attempt to stop the demon's scheme. The film was intended as the pilot of a television series, but was rejected.\n\nBarrett played Christine Chapel again in the film \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" (1979), depicting older versions of the characters from the original series. While Chapel was not one of the film's main characters, she was now depicted as a doctor instead of a nurse.\n\nBarrett's last appearance in the 1970s was a minor role in the Christmas television film \"The Man in the Santa Claus Suit\" (1979). The film depicted Santa Claus (played by Fred Astaire) subtly helping a number of adult characters in resolving their personal problems. The film is mainly remembered as Astaire's last television role.\n\nBarrett played Christine Chapel for the last time in the film \"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\" (1986). She had a supporting role in the film, which depicted the former nurse as having achieved the rank of Commander. A year later, a third Star Trek television series was launched: \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", which featured entirely new characters. Barrett guested in a few episodes as alien ambassador Lwaxana Troi, the eccentric mother of counselor Deanna Troi (played by Marina Sirtis). Barrett would play this role several times in this and the next Star Trek series, \"Deep Space Nine\", from 1987 to 1996. A subplot involving the character was that Lwaxana's other daughter had died young in an accident, causing Lwaxana to be overly protective of Deanna. Another subplot centered on her love relationship with Deep Space 9's shape-shifting security chief Odo.\n\nIn 1991, Gene Roddenberry died from natural causes. Barrett never remarried. In the 90s, she lent her voice talents to several Star Trek video games and the animated Spider Man TV series, and had roles in two theatrical movies. As Roddenberry had left behind archives with unfinished projects, Barrett further developed one of these projects into the science fiction television series \"Earth: Final Conflict\" (1997-2002). She served as the series' executive producer and acted as one of the main characters, Dr. Julianne Belman, in 11 episodes in the first three seasons. The premise of the series was that a group of seemingly benevolent aliens share their advanced technology with the people of Earth. Many humans suspect that the aliens have ulterior motives, and consequently form a militant resistance organization which opposes the aliens. The series lasted 5 seasons and 110 episodes.\n\nBarrett fleshed out another of Roddenberry's unfinished projects into the space opera television series \"Andromeda\" (2000-2005). The series started in a distant future, where three galaxies are unified under the control of the Systems Commonwealth. When the Commonwealth attempts to resolve a war with another space-faring civilization by ceding territory to them, an uprising against the Commonwealth begins. In an early part of the conflict the spaceship \"Andromeda Ascendant\" is frozen in time. It emerges from stasis 303 years later, to find that the Commonwealth has collapsed and civilization has considerably declined. Main character Dylan Hunt (played by Kevin Sorbo) has the mission of restoring the Commonwealth. Like the previous Roddenberry series, \"Andromeda\" also lasted 5 seasons and 110 episodes. It was canceled largely due to a change of ownership of the production company Fireworks Entertainment. It was Barrett's last effort as an executive producer.\n\nIn her last years, Barrett was suffering from leukemia. She died in December 2008, at her home in Bel Air, Los Angeles. She was 76-years-old. Her funeral was held in early January 2009, with about 250 people in attendance. Several of her former co-stars from Star Trek attended the funeral. Prior to her death, Barrett had recorded a number of voice roles in several Star Trek fan films and series, resulting in some posthumous releases of her last roles. She is still remembered as a major figure of Star Trek.\n\nJeff Corey was a film and television character actor, as well as one of the top acting teachers in America.\n\nCorey was born Arthur Zwerling on August 10, 1914 in New York City, New York, to Mary (Peskin), a Russian Jewish immigrant, and Nathan Zwerling, an Austrian Jewish immigrant. He was an indifferent student, but after taking a drama class in high school, young Corey became hooked. His talent earned him a scholarship to the Feagin School of Dramatic Arts, the top acting school in New York City at the time. Corey then became a professional actor, a career choice which saved him from a life selling sewing machines, he later said.\n\nHis first gig after acting school was with a Shakespearean repertory company, after which he became a member of a traveling troupe that entertained children. After Leslie Howard closed his Broadway production of Hamlet in December 1936, he took the play on the road with Corey cast as Rosencrantz in 1937. In 1939, Corey appeared as part of the Federal Theater Project's (FTP) Living Newspaper dramatic showcase in the Life and Death of an American, co-starring with Arthur Kennedy, and featuring the music of Alex North. He made his film debut in a bit part in the Federal Theater's sole movie production, ...One Third of a Nation... (1939). Starring Sylvia Sidney, Leif Erickson and future Oscar-winning director Sidney Lumet, the movie, which was released by Paramount, was a progressive exegesis on the hazards of tenement slum conditions. Congress terminated FTP funding on June 30, 1939, mainly due to objections to the leftist political tones of many FTP productions (see Tim Robbins' movie Das schwankende Schiff (1999) about the pressures faced by the FTP in 1939).\n\nIn 1940, Corey, who had married his wife Hope in 1938, moved to Hollywood, where he appeared in studio productions through 1943, including Der Teufel und Daniel Webster (1941), Flicka (1943) and Johanna von Orleans (1948). He also had a hand in establishing the Actors Lab, where he appeared in a wide variety of plays, including \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\", \"Miss Julie\" and \"Prometheus\". He also produced \"Juno and the Paycock\" for the Lab. He joined the United States Navy Photographic Service in 1943 and was assigned to the aircraft carrier Yorktown as a motion picture combat photographer. He earned three citations while serving during the war, including one for shooting footage on the Yorktown during a kamikaze attack on the ship. The citation, which was awarded in October 1945, read: \"His sequence of a Kamikaze attempt on the Carrier Yorktown, done in the face of grave danger, is one of the great picture sequences of the war in the Pacific, and reflects the highest credit upon Corey and the U.S. Navy Photographic Service.\"\n\nAfter the war, Corey returned to Hollywood and resumed his acting career, specializing in character parts and playing heavies in films such as RÃ¤cher der Unterwelt (1946) and Zelle R 17 (1947), both of which starred another returning war vet, Burt Lancaster. His appearance as the psychiatrist in Home of the Brave (1949), one of his best screen performances, promised a long and productive career in Hollywood, but the first phase of his cinema career was cut short in 1951 when he was subpoenaed to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) after being named as a former Communist Party member by actor Marc Lawrence.\n\nHUAC had scheduled hearings in Los Angeles as part of its crusade to ferret out Communist influence in Hollywood. Appearing before HUAC in Los Angeles in September 1951, the 37-year-old Corey refused to testify, instead invoking his 5th Amendment rights. The movie industry ruled that anyone invoking their constitutional right not to testify would be blacklisted, and Corey was, missing out on an entire decade of work in films and television during the 1950s. Ironically, Lawrence, whom Corey despised for the rest of his life, pointing out that he had remained stateside on a health deferment while Corey risked his life during the war, was virtually absent from American films and television during the same decade, having to make his living in Italy along with American expatriates who had been blacklisted.\n\nIn the book on Hollywood blacklistees \"Tender Comrades\", Corey explained that he had been a member of the Communist Party, and that while he no longer was in 1951, he could not in good conscience turn informer. \"Most of us were retired reds,\" Corey said. \"We had left it, at least I had, years before. The only issue was, did you want to just give them their token names so you could continue your career, or not? I had no impulse to defend a political point of view that no longer interested me particularly. They just wanted two new names so they could hand out more subpoenas.\"\n\nAfter being blacklisted, Corey used his G.I. Bill benefits to study speech therapy at UCLA while supporting his family as a common laborer. At the request of a fellow student, Corey organized a class in speech that he taught in the garage of his home in Hollywood Hills home. He expanded his curriculum to acting, accepting $10 a month in \"tuition\" per month from each student that allowed them to attend weekly classes. Eventually, he expanded the garage to create a small theater where his students performed scenes. Corey's reputation as a teacher grew, and by the mid-1950s, he had become the premier acting coach in Hollywood. Although studios refused to hire the blacklisted Corey as an actor, they did send contract players to study with him.\n\nCorey's class, which became known as the Professional Actors Workshop, attracted directors, screenwriters and established actors seeking insight into the craft. Corey's Workshop has been described by the National Observer as \"A major influence in the motion picture industry.\" Corey was a Stanislavskian teaching the popular Method technique of sense-memory popularized by such other acting gurus as Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler, which sought to tap into the actor's own emotions and psyche. Corey's own teaching technique was eclectic: He focused on one-on-one work with an individual actor, seeking through improvisational exercises to get the actor to tap into his/her subconscious and to use their imagination to come up with a theme that would elucidate their character.\n\nHis students included Robert Blake, pop singer Pat Boone, Richard Chamberlain, singer/actress Cher, director-producer Roger Corman, James Dean, Kirk Douglas, Jane Fonda, Peter Fonda, Michael Forest, Sally Kellerman, Irvin Kershner, Shirley Knight, Penny Marshall, Rita Moreno, Jack Nicholson, Leonard Nimoy, Anthony Perkins, Rob Reiner, singer/actress/director Barbra Streisand, future Academy Award-winning screenwriter Robert Towne and Robin Williams. Of Corey the teacher, three-time Oscar-winner Jack Nicholson said after he had become a major movie star, \"Acting is life study, and Corey's classes got me into looking at life as an artist.\"\n\nCorey also tutored experienced actors who had trouble with a role, or who just needed insight into playing a character. One of the already-established actors Corey tutored was three-time Oscar nominee Kirk Douglas, who came to Corey for help in playing the title role in Spartacus (1960). It was Douglas who, along with Otto Preminger, ended the blacklist by hiring Dalton Trumbo to write the screenplays for Spartacus (1960) and Exodus (1960), respectively. Two years after the Trumbo-penned films debuted on the big screen, Corey again was working in films and television. In 1962, he was cast in the film Kennwort: Canary (1963) when one of his acting students, pop singer Pat Boone, pressured 20th-Century Fox into hiring him. Now off the blacklist, Corey became a busy character actor in movies and on television. Corey made his reputation as an actor's actor whom other actors loved to work with. Always good with actors, Corey also directed some episodes of television series.\n\nIn addition to his acting work, Corey continued teaching. He was Professor of Theater Arts at California State University in Northridge, and was artist in residence at Ball State, in Indiana, the University of Illinois in Bloomington, Chapman College's World Campus Afloat, the University of Texas in Austin, and at the Graduate School of Creative Writing at New York University. He also conducted acting seminars at Emory University in Atlanta, and for the Canadian Film Institute in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nOn August 16, 2002, six days after his 88th birthday, Corey died in a Santa Monica, California hospital, of complication from a fall. He was survived by his wife of 64 years, Hope, three daughters, and grandchildren.\n\nRoy Brocksmith began his career on the bar at Hap Kuhl's Tavern in his native Quincy, Illinois, at the age of three. As a boy soprano, he performed in churches, schools, and appeared regularly on local radio and television programs. At 16, he taught at the local children's theater. Two years later he married his high-school girlfriend.\n\nHe left Quincy, touring the US for two years in the Oberammergau Passion Play of Richmond, Virginia. He returned and attended Hannibal LaGrange Junior College, Culver-Stockton College, and graduated from Quincy University in 1970. During this time, he directed for the community theater, Pragressive Playhouse, and founded the Great River Theater Workshop. As a director, he was taken to New York by a Ukrainian anesthesiologist in 1969, where he was joined by his wife and son, Blake (born 8/5/66).\n\nFor one year he was a librarian at the Lilliam Morgan Hetrick Medical Library at Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital in Manhattan and was on the board of the American Association of Midwives. This regular job ended when he received his AEA union card-playing opposite John Carradine in \"The Stingiest Man in Town,\" a musical based on Charles Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol\" and narrated by then-Mayor John Lindsay at New York's Town Hall.\n\nOn the legit stage, he made his Broadway debut--and the cover of the New York Times Magazine (11/9/75)--in \"The Leaf People for Joseph Papp. He also appeared in Herr TartÃ¼ff with Mildred Dunnock in \"Stages\" with Jack Warden and sang \"Mack the Knife\" in Kurt Weill & Bertolt Brecht's award-winning \"Threepenny Opera\" as the Ballad Singer in Papp's Lincoln Center revival (Original cast album and \"Broadway Magic of the Seventies\" CDs, both on Columbia/CBS Records), and as the King of France in \"The Three Musketeers.\" Off-Broadway shows included \"Polly,\" \"The Beggar's Opera,\" \"Dr. Salavy's Magic Theater,\" and \"In the Jungle of Cities\" with Al Pacino. He starred in the Broadway-bound \"Swing\" at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. At the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, he appeared in \"Arms and the Man (as Petkoff), William Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\" (as Touchstone), Thornton Wilder's \"Our Town\" (as Professor Willard), and MoliÃ¨re's \"Don Juan\" (as Sganarelle). This last garnered him the Kudos Award from the Minneapolis critics and the production was brought to the Delacourt Theater in New York by Joseph Papp, and he received international praise. His work with Papp and directors Richard Foreman Liviu Cuilei, Stuart Ostrow, Tom O'Horgan, Andrei Serban, Alan Schneider, and John Cassavetes, to name just a few, made Brocksmith a solid part of America's most innovative and provocative theater.\n\nHe was first to direct Foreman and Silverman's \"Africanis Instructus\" for Lyn Austin's Lennox Arts Center, and his adaptation of Feydeau's \"A Flea in Her Ear\" was presented under his direction at Baltimore's Center Stage. His unusual staging of Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" gave the Alaska Repertory Theater a major box-office and critical hit and was chosen out of 100 entries to be presented at the Joyce Theater in New York that season. He also appeared as Thurio in the national tour of John Guare's musical version of \"Two Gentelmen of Verona,\" and he made his California debut starring opposite Gena Rowlands.\n\nIn 1987 he formed the California Cottage Theater with partner Michael Liscio, joining a long and formidable list of American actor-managers. As Producing Director he presented only new works: \"A Cold Day in Hell\" by January Quackenbush, Brocksmith's own \"Box Prelude OPUS #1,\" \"Matinee\" by Hal Corley, \"The One Less Traveled\" by Cary Pepper, \"A Necessary End\" by Joe Rubinoff, \"Ripe Conditions\" by Claudia Allen, and \"Letters from Queens\" by Brocksmith. The Cottage was unique because it was the only professional theater heater in the country under AEA jurisdiction for presentations in a private home. By its closing on February 17, 1996, over 8,000 people had attended performances. It was hailed as \"Suburbia's Rialto\" (Wall Street Journal), \"The epicenter of quirky folk\" (L.A. Weekly), \"Pick of the Week\" (L.A.Times), and \"Critic's Choice\" (Drama Logue). Calling himself a theater craftsman, it was Brocksmith's belief that \"good theater is not a matter of money and place as it is a matter of imagination, craft and guts.\" The concept of the California Cottage Theater, a professional theater for free, was, to him, theater in its most essential form.\n\nBrocksmith also appeared on several episodes of 3-2-1 Contact (1980) in its \"Bloodhound Gang\" segment and on an episode of Raumschiff Enterprise: Das nÃ¤chste Jahrhundert (1987). Sadly, he died of kidney failure on December 16, 2001.\n\nThe ever-impressive, chameleon-like British character actor Roy Dotrice was born on the Island of Guernsey, which is part of the United Kingdom, one of the Channel Islands off the coast of France. He was the first-born child of Louis and Neva Dotrice who prospered as bakers. The Germans occupied the island in 1940 and he and his mother and brother escaped to England.\n\nAdvancing his real age, Roy joined the Royal Air Force at age 16 and was trained as a wireless operator and air gunner. In 1942 his plane was shot down and he was captured where he served out the remainder of WWII (over three years) as a prisoner of war in Germany. He was introduced to the idea of performing when he took part in various makeshift concerts in order to raise the spirits of his fellow captives.\n\nFollowing WWII and his release, Roy decided to pursue his acting ambitions. After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, he began appearing in English repertory where he met and married (1947) actress Kay Dotrice who at the time was performing under her given name of Katherine (Kay) Newman. Throughout the early post-war years, the couple performed together in repertory with Charles Denville and the Denville Players. At different times he was a member of the Liverpool, Manchester and Oldham repertory theatres. Also during this great time of productivity, Roy produced and directed some three hundred stage plays. He formed his own troupe, the Guernsey Theatre Company, in 1955. The highlight of his theatrical career, however, began in 1957 when Roy became a member of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford, England, (later the Royal Shakespeare Company). For the next nine years he performed in a lengthy succession of the Bard's works, first in small parts as various players, officers and gentlemen. He subsequently went on to become a notable Iago, Falstaff and Julius Caesar, among others. A popular performer, he had an uncanny ability to play much older than he was. He later went on to perform with the American Shakespearean Festival.\n\nThe notoriety he received from his abundant classical theatre experience led directly to radio, film, television and Broadway offers. Roy has appeared in a number of Broadway productions over the years, receiving a Tony nomination for his work in \"A Life\" and finally winning the trophy for his heralded performance in the 2000 revival of \"A Moon for the Misbegotten\" starring Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne. Known for his considerable success in one-man shows such as Abraham Lincoln, Charles Dickens, Will Rogers and Winston Churchill, his superb one-person show \"Brief Lives\", drawn from the Elizabethan diaries of John Aubrey, played for over 1,700 performances over a period of nearly a decade. At one time this set a record for a solo performance and was listed in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\".\n\nDotrice made his credited feature movie debut supporting Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris in Kennwort 'Schweres Wasser' (1965), and has since lent class and distinction to a spattering of films. Among his list of credits include the bawdy comedy Leigh mcnally (1969); the sumptuous biopic Nikolaus und Alexandra (1971); the Oscar-winning Amadeus (1984), Milos Forman's adaptation of composer Mozart's life in which Roy portrayed Mozart's stern and domineering father Leopold; and Liebe und Eis (1992) as an Olympic skating coach.\n\nPerhaps better remembered on the small screen, he appeared magnanimously as a host of monarchs including his Edward IV in The Wars of the Roses (1965) and King George IV in the syndicated miniseries Shaka Zulu (1986). To American audiences he is probably best known as Jacob Wells, the Beast's surrogate father, in the dramatic series Die SchÃ¶ne und das Biest (1987). Dotrice was also cast in the recurring role of Father Barrett, a Catholic priest and confidante of Judge Henry Bone (played by Ray Walston), on the acclaimed Emmy-winning drama Picket Fences: Tatort Gartenzaun (1992).\n\nSince the end of the 1970s he has lived and worked primarily in America. More recently he appeared on stage reviving his outstanding 1993 role as George Bernard Shaw in \"The Best of Friends\" in 2006. Millennium work included the films Alien JÃ¤ger (2003), These Foolish Things (2006), Played - Abgezockt (2006), Go Go Tales (2007). Enjoying a recurring role on the British TV series Life Begins (2004), Roy made his last TV appearances on two 2012 episodes of \"Game of Thrones\" as Hallyne.\n\nRoy's devoted wife Kay died on August 2, 2007, after 60 years of marriage. The couple has three daughters (Michele Dotrice, Karen Dotrice and Yvette Dotrice), all whom at one time or another were actresses. Karen, who is now primarily out of the business, became the best known perhaps for her childhood Disney portrayals, notably in Mary Poppins (1964). Combined, his daughters have presented him with seven grandchildren. Roy died on October 16, 2017.\n\nSignifying intelligence, eloquence, versatility and quiet intensity, one of the more important, critically acclaimed black actors to gain a Hollywood foothold in the 1970s was Paul Winfield. He was born in 1939 in Dallas, Texas, where he lived in his early years before moving with his family to Los Angeles' Watts district. He showed early promise as a student at Manual Arts High School, earning distinction with several performance awards. As a senior, he earned his first professional acting job and extended his theatrical education with a two-year scholarship to the University of Portland in Oregon. Subsequent scholarships led to his studies at Stanford and Los Angeles City College, among other colleges. He left U.C.L.A. just six credits short of his Bachelor's degree.\n\nPaul's first big break came in 1964 when actor/director Burgess Meredith gave him a role in Le Roi Jones' controversial one-act play \"The Dutchman and the Toilet\". Director Meredith cast him again four years in \"The Latent Heterosexual\" with Zero Mostel. Although he won a contract at Columbia Pictures in 1966 and built up his on-camera career with a succession of television credits, he continued to focus on the legitimate stage. A member of the Stanford Repertory Theatre, he concentrated on both classic and contemporary plays. In 1969, Paul joined the Inner City Cultural Center Theatre in Los Angeles for two years, which offered a drama program for high school students.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Paul redirected himself back to performing on television and in films with guest work in more than 40 series on the small screen, including a boyfriend role on the first season of the landmark black sitcom Julia (1968) starring Diahann Carroll. In films, he was given a featured role in the Sidney Poitier film Es fÃ¼hrt kein Weg zurÃ¼ck (1969), and earned comparable roles in Kampf den Talaren (1970) and Brother John (1971) before major stardom occurred.\n\n1972 proved to be a banner year for Paul after winning the male lead opposite Cicely Tyson in the touching classic film Das Jahr ohne Vater (1972). His towering performance as a sharecropper who is imprisoned and tortured for stealing a ham for his impoverished family earned him an Oscar nomination for \"Best Actor\" -- the third black actor (Sidney Poitier and James Earl Jones preceded him) to receive such an honor at the time.\n\nFrom there a host of films and quality television roles began arriving on his doorstep. In mini-movies, Paul portrayed various historical/entertainment giants including Thurgood Marshall, Don King and baseball's Roy Campanella, and was Emmy-nominated for his portrayal of Martin Luther King, Jr. in King (1978) with Sounder co-star Cicely Tyson as wife Coretta. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he earned solid distinction in such prestige projects as WeiÃŸes Haus, Hintereingang (1979), Roots - Die nÃ¤chsten Generationen (1979) (another Emmy nomination), The Sophisticated Gents (1981), Die Blauen und die Grauen (1982), Sister, Sister (1982), James Baldwin's Go Tell It on the Mountain (1985), Goodbye America (1986) and The Women of Brewster Place (1989).\n\nAlthough the big screen did not offer the same consistent quality following his breakthrough with Sounder, he nevertheless turned in strong roles in Conrack (1974), Huckleberry Finn (1974), A Hero Ain't Nothin' But a Sandwich (1977) (again with Ms. Tyson), StraÃŸe der Verdammnis (1977), Star Trek II - Der Zorn des Khan (1982) and Der weiÃŸe Hund von Beverly Hills (1982).\n\nSurprisingly, Paul never achieved the promise of a Sidney Poitier-like stardom and his roles diminished in size. Relegated to character roles, he still appeared in such quality television as Maggie, Maggie! (1994), although he was not the major focus. After two nominations, he finally won the Emmy for a guest performance as a judge on Picket Fences: Tatort Gartenzaun (1992). Paul's showier work at this period of time included the film Catfish in Black Bean Sauce (1999) and a surprise cross-dressing cameo as Aunt Matilda in Relax... It's Just Sex (1998).\n\nOn stage, Paul graced such productions as \"Richard III\" (at New York's Lincoln Center Theatre), \"Othello\", \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", \"The Seagull\", \"A Few Good Men\", \"Happy Endings\" and \"Checkmates\", which became his sole Broadway credit. Paul also served as Artist in Residence at the University of Hawaii and subsequently at the University of California at Santa Barbara.\n\nIn his final years, Winfield narrated the A&E crime series City Confidential (1998), appeared as a teacher in a television adaptation of his earlier success Sounder (2003), and enjoyed a recurring role as Sam for many years on the series Ein Hauch von Himmel (1994).\n\nSuffering from obesity and diabetes in later life, Paul Winfield passed away from a heart attack at age 64 in 2004, and was survived by a sister, Patricia. His longtime companion of 30 years, set designer and architect Charles Gillan Jr. predeceased him by two years.\n\nThis most consummate, vibrant and versatile actress established a distinguished reputation on the stage, in films and on TV. The former Miss Chicago of 1948 beauty pageant winner and Miss America semifinalist was born in Oak Park, Illinois. Her family was impoverished and her parents divorced early on. Young Lois used make-believe to escape her reality by creating small plays in her backyard, which led to an affinity with the idea of acting. Having set her sights on the stage she joined a community theatre at the tender age of eleven and appeared on local radio and television. She later continued her training at Chicago's Goodman Theatre and then studied 'the method' at the Actors' Studio in New York City, eventually making her Broadway debut in Dalton Trumbo's \"The Biggest Thief in Town\" (1948) using the stage moniker \"Lydia Scott\" (her given name, she felt, was too plain and sounded \"schoolmarmy\").\n\nLois was understudy to Barbara Bel Geddes for the role of \"Maggie the Cat\" in the original 1955 Broadway production of Tennessee Williams's Pulitzer-Prize winning \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\", staged by Elia Kazan. Occasionally, she got to play \"Maggie\", herself. Of her (own personal favourite) role as Blanche DuBois in the 1973 stage production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", New York Times critic Clive Barnes wrote: \"\"Miss Nettleton plays Blanche as a woman of nearly unshatterable courage.\" Williams himself called her one of the greatest actresses with whom he had ever worked. Not surprisingly then, that the self-confessed method actress went on to win the prestigious Clarence Derwent Award for her performance in \"God and Kate Murphy\".\n\nLois was married for seven years to Jean Shepherd, a radio host and television humorist. She and Shepherd clicked after she called his nightly radio show at WOR in the 1950s and the beguiled Shepherd broadcast their telephone conversations on the air. They later appeared together in Shepherd's off-Broadway play \"Look Charlie\" in 1959.\n\nWhile her official film debut came in the 1962 adaptation of Tennessee Williams's \"Period of Adjustment\", Lois had previously played a bit part in Elia Kazan's classic Das Gesicht in der Menge (1957), scripted by Budd Schulberg. She subsequently acted in many movies, but most of her best work was on stage and in television where she appeared in everything from sitcoms to soap operas. In a 1985 interview she referred to herself as 'a gypsy actress', saying \"I always wanted to be as different in everything as possible\". Consistently selective, on the lookout for 'interesting' characters and mature roles to play, she tackled pretty much every genre -- even playing one of Londo Mollari's bitchy wives in Babylon 5 (1993). She gave a particularly fine performances in the classic 1961 \"Midnight Sun\" episode of Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959). She declared her own personal favourite screen role to have been that of the Israeli prosecutor (opposite Maximilian Schell) in the American Film Theater production of The Man in the Glass Booth (1975). Roger Ebert for the New York Times wrote \"She has a steadiness and intelligence and doesn't back down. She's the closest thing the film has to a moral center.\"\n\nA charming and gracious actress, Lois was nominated six-times for Emmy Awards. She won twice for her TV work: for the daytime special The American Woman: Portraits of Courage (1976) and for \"A Gun for Mandy\" (1983), an episode of the syndicated religious anthology Nachdenkliche Geschichten (1960).\n\nMalachi Throne, the character actor who became one of the more ubiquitous faces on television from the \"Golden Age\" of the 1950s through the 21st-century, was born in New York City on December 1, 1928, the son of Samuel and Rebecca (nÃ©e Chaikin) Throne, who had immigrated to America from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He began performing at an early age.\n\nDuring World War Two, he quit school to work in theater, though he later returned and got his high school diploma. He then set out upon a life as a \"wandering player\", as he describes it, playing in summer and winter stock companies while matriculating at Brooklyn College and Long Island University. Though he loved acting, he believed he would eventually wind up as an English teacher, which is why he doggedly kept at his studies between tours.\n\nWhen he was 21 years old, the Korean conflict broke out, and Throne wound up in the infantry attached to an armored unit. When he returned to the New York theatrical scene, he found out that the revolution Marlon Brando had started in 1947 playing Stanley Kowalski in Endstation Sehnsucht (1951) was now the status quo. Possessed of a deep, classically trained voice, Throne was cast in the parts of characters much older than his actual age. His clear enunciation also made him a natural for live television, and he went to work on the now-defunct DuMont TV network. He continued his acting studies in New York, tutored by such luminaries as Uta Hagen and William Hickey.\n\nIn addition to TV, he continued to work on the the stage, appearing in the landmark Off-Broadway production of Eugene O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh\", in support of Jason Robards. He also played in the famous Off-Broadway revivals of \"The Threepenny Opera\" and Clifford Odets' \"Rocket To The Moon\", as well as appeared on Broadway in such top shows as Jean Anouilh's \"Becket\" in support of Laurence Olivier.\n\nIn 1958-59, he found himself in California, playing a season at San Diego's Old Globe Theater. After his stint with the Globe was over, he went to Hollywood, and established himself as a major character actor in guest spots on series television during the 1960s. He had memorable appearances as \"Falseface\" onBatman (1966) and the Arab-styled \"Thief of Outer Space\" on Verschollen zwischen fremden Welten (1965). He also provided the voice of \"The Keeper\" for The Cage (1966), the pilot episode of Raumschiff Enterprise (1966). He turned down an offer to be a regular cast member on that show, rejecting the part of Dr. McCoy as he did not want to play third fiddle to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy.\n\nProducer Gene Roddenberry, who had offered him the role of Dr. McCoy (\"Bones\"), was not offended and cast Throne as \"Commodore JosÃ© Mendez\" in the two-part episode \"The Menagerie\", which included most of the original pilot, although by then The Keeper's voice had been re-dubbed by another actor, Meg Wyllie. Many years later, Throne played \"Senator Pardac\" in the Raumschiff Enterprise: Das nÃ¤chste Jahrhundert (1987) two-part episode ,\"Unification\", appearing with Leonard Nimoy, whose role as Spock Throne had coveted a generation earlier. In 1968, two years after \"Star Trek\" debuted, Throne was cast as Robert Wagner's boss on Ihr Auftritt, Al Mundy (1968) while continuing to guest star on many other television shows.\n\nThrone remained committed to the stage, appearing as a resident actor with a variety of regional theaters, including the San Francisco Actors' Workshop, the Los Angeles Inner City Repertory Co., the Mark Taper Forum and the Louisville Free Theatre.\n\nThrone died of lung cancer on March 13, 2013 in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, where he appeared in local theater. He also wrote historical novels. His two sons are also in show business: Zachary Throne is an actor/musician while Joshua Throne is a producer and unit production manager."
