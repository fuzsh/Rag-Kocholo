        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Feb. 17 /PRNewswire/ -- Fontana, the independent distribution arm of Universal Music Group, the world's leading music company, has signed an exclusive distribution deal with Psychopathic Records, it was announced today by Ron Spaulding, President of Fontana, and Bill Dail, President of Psychopathic Records.\n\n\"Under Bill's leadership, Psychopathic Records has emerged as a truly innovative and successful entertainment company, and is exactly the type of entrepreneurial label that we like to be partners with,\" stated Mr. Spaulding. \"We are looking forward to combining our expertise in sales, marketing, digital and distribution to help further develop their roster of artists.\"\n\n\"Psychopathic Records cannot state words that describe the excitement felt and portrayed around the company for our highly anticipated partnership with Fontana,\" commented Mr. Dail. \"2010 marks the beginning of a successful, new era for Psychopathic Records.\"\n\nPsychopathic Records, Inc., formed in Michigan in 1990, is home to the Insane Clown Posse (ICP), who debuted as Psychopathic Records' first artist with the Carnival of Carnage album in 1992 (up for Gold certification).

Film-wise, the company's first documentary, Shockumentary (1998; Platinum certified), tells the story of ICP and the Dark Carnival.
