McDaniels left the company in 2014.\n\nIn 2015, McDaniels founded and became Executive Chairman at FACTION Entertainment, a tech-focused management services company for talent managers. FACTION developed and provided proprietary plug-n-play tools aimed at helping talent managers scale their businesses.\n\nFACTION further developed a communication and information sharing platform to streamline scheduling, daily operations, and cross-business interactions for managers. Aside from technology development, FACTION also included an in-house incubator program that mentored and guided clients’ brands.\n\nIn 2016, McDaniels and FACTION partnered with Kobalt Music Group. The deal led to FACTIONâs talent managers’ use of Kobalt as their preferred partner for publishing and label and digital distribution services.\n\nMcDaniels remained in an active capacity with FACTION until 2018.\n\nIn October 2017, McDaniels was appointed as Beatportâs CEO.
