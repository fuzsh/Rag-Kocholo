He will be sure to let out a mruff on here once it’s up and running.\n\nMy pet project involves the analysis of any possible correlations involved with key signatures of all the Billboard Hot 100 #1’s from 1955 to our present day and age (so basically since the Rock era started). I’ve been recording the keys (including any full transpositions – not secondary tonicizations) of this comprehensive list of songs. My analysis will include results of most popular & least popular key signatures of all #1 songs as well as per decade, reasons why certain keys may have been chosen during particular time frames, the possibility that certain keys appeal more to audiences, and other musically-geeky probing.\n\nRobert Fontana"
