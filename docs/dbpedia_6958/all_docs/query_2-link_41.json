        "text": "Fontana was started in the 1950s in Europe as a subsidiary of the Dutch record company Philips. Shortly after Philips reached a deal with Mercury Records in the US in November, 1961, Mercury established a US version of Fontana in early 1962 as their subsidiary for international recordings.\n\nThe label initially was almost exclusively an album label, with 23 albums released in 1962 and 1963 and only two singles. The pre-1965 albums were typical of the \"international\" albums selling in the US at the time, showcasing various countries' cultural music. Mostly, they were modest sellers at best, and forgettable. The exception was Greek singer Nana Mouskouri, who had a large following and a long career in Europe and charted a couple of albums here in the US.\n\nBefore 1965, there were so few singles released that Fontana used the Smash label's catalog sequence. The first release was Nana Mouskouri's version of \"Wildwood Flower\" (actually released as the \"B\" side of \"What Now My Love\"). It was issued on Fontana 1785 in November, 1962, and made #27 in Chicago, but failed to chart nationally. It was the only Fontana single release in 1962. In 1963, there was also only one 45 issued, Johnny Dankworth's \"Hoe Down\"/\"Sing-Sing-Sing\" on Fontana 1841. Dankworth was a British orchestra leader who had had a couple of US chart hits in the 1950s. He recorded several albums in Europe that were released on US Fontana starting in 1964.\n\nOf the total album output for Fontana in 1962 and 1963, two of the albums were by Nana Mouskouri, two were soundtracks, and the others were the generic \"international\" music.\n\nIn 1964, however, things started heating up. The \"British Invasion\" was hitting the US, and Fontana had the rights to some of the popular British artists like the Merseybeats, Eden Kane, the Escorts, the Pretty Things, the Others, the Honey Bees, the Spencer Davis Group, and Wayne Fontana & the Mindbenders. Fontana released 22 singles in 1964, many of them US issues of songs that were making the British hit charts. These included the Merseybeats' \"I Think of You\" [US Fontana 1882, made #5 in UK], Eden Kane's \"Boys Cry\" [Fontana 1891, #8 UK], the Merseybeats' \"Don't Turn Around\" [Fontana 1905, #13 UK], the Pretty Things' \"Rosalyn\" [Fontana 1916, #41 UK], Wayne Fontana & the Mindbenders' \"Stop Look Listen\" [Fontana 1917, #37 UK], the Pretty Things' \"Don't Bring Me Down\" [Fontana 1941, #10 UK], the Merseybeats' \"Last Night\" [Fontana 1950, #40 UK], and the Spencer Davis Group's \"I Can't Stand It\" [Fontana 1960, #47 UK]. Surprisingly, especially in light of the raging British Invasion going on, not one of these British Fontana hits charted in the US.\n\nBut in 1964, the US Fontana label also widened their artist roster to include a few American artists, most notably New York pop/jazz singer Gloria Lynne. Lynne did make the charts, with \"Be Anything (But Be Mine)\" [Fontana 1890], a remake of an old Eddie Howard pop tune which made the US charts in April, 1964, reaching #88 pop and #40 on the R&B charts. It was Fontana's first US national chart record.\n\nOther singles issued in 1964 included discs by Johnny Gregory, Al Brisco Clark, the Escorts, Vicki Anderson, Joyce Kennedy (another American singer, lead singer of the group Mother's Finest) the Dell-Mates, Larry Hale, the Honey Bees, Diana Dors, the Others, Paul Nero's Blues Sounds, and ex-Drifters vocalist Bill Pinkney. None of these were successful on the US charts.\n\nThe 15 albums issued in 1964 on Fontana took a decided turn away from solely ethnic international music and towards pop, R&B, and jazz, including two albums by Gloria Lynne, but by the end of 1964, Fontana had yet to reach the album charts.\n\nFontana's first real hit came in early 1965, with Wayne Fontana & the Mindbenders' \"Game of Love\" [Fontana 1509], which made #1 in the US and #2 in England. Since Wayne Fontana was born Glyn Ellis, he obviously took his stage name from his record label's name. The Mindbenders were Eric Stewart (lead guitar and vocals), Bob Lang (bass), and Ric Rothwell (drums). The followup record, \"It's Just A Little Bit Too Late\" [Fontana 1514], failed to make the top-40, stalling at #45. The next single, a top-20 UK hit called \"She Needs Love\" [Fontana 1526], missed the charts altogether here. At this point (October, 1965), Wayne Fontana left the group to go solo, eventually having several UK successes but no additional chart entries here.\n\nThe Mindbenders, without Wayne Fontana, continued making records. Their first single after the split was another huge hit, \"A Groovy Kind of Love\" [Fontana 1541], which reached #2 both in the US and UK in the spring of 1966. But a followup single, \"Ashes to Ashes\" [Fontana 1555] only reached #55 (although it hit #14 in England). Four additional singles over the next year all failed to reach the charts here. In 1968, Graham Gouldman joined the group on bass, but the group broke up shortly thereafter. Stewart joined Kevin Godley and Lol Creme as Hotlegs, a strange group that had an off-the-wall hit with \"Neanderthal Man\" [Capitol 2886] in 1970. Shortly after the hit, they too added Graham Gouldman, and changed their name to 10cc. 10cc, of course, was often on the pop charts in the 1970s with songs like \"The Things We Do for Love\" [Mercury 73875] and \"I'm Not in Love\" [Mercury 73678]. The latter song had one of the most bizarre instrumental lineups in rock history, with a guitar, drums, and three keyboards!\n\nIn the summer of 1965, Fontana scored another chart hit with Gloria Lynne and \"Watermelon Man\" [Fontana 1511], which made #62 pop, but #8 on the R&B charts. Unfortunately, it was to be her last single hit for Fontana. About the same time, Fontana offered \"Cry to Me\" by the Pretty Things [Fontana 1518], which was charting in England, but the US audiences showed only indifference.\n\nBy the fall of 1965, Fontana had signed a folk group from Hull, England, called the Silkie. They recorded a Beatles song from the movie Help with the full approval and cooperation of the Beatles themselves, who provided production assistance and some musical assistance on the recording. The greatest gift, however, was the Beatles' not releasing the song on one of their own singles, which of course would have killed the Silkie version outright. As it was, the song, \"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\" [Fontana 1525], reached #10. Following up a Beatles song proved difficult (as it has for most groups who have had this type of success; e.g., Underground Sunshine). The next single, \"The Keys to My Soul\" [Fontana 1536] only made #124, and the next one, a remake of the old Chordettes hit \"Born to Be With You\" [Fontana 1551] only reached #133. That was all for the group. The Silkie included vocalist Silvie Tatler, guitarists Mike Ramsden and Ivor Aylesbury, and bassist Kevin Cunningham.\n\nFontana released only eight albums in 1965, with two of them making the US charts. These were the Wayne Fontana & the Mindbenders' album Game of Love, which reached #58 over the summer, and the Gloria Lynne album Soul Serenade, which reached #82 in late summer. A Gloria Lynne followup late in the year, Love and a Woman, failed to chart, as did the Pretty Things album and a Nana Mouskouri offering, Nana.\n\nThe year 1966 brought several new artists to Fontana, two of which debuted with #1 hits in the US. The earlier of these was the Troggs, whose classic version of American songwriter Chip Taylor's \"Wild Thing\" [Fontana 1548] made #1 over the summer. The Troggs came from Andover in England. Lead singer Reg Presley (nee Reginald Maurice Ball) had been a bass player in the original band called the Troggs, but the band lost half of their personnel and combined with another band (Ten Feet Five) who had similar personnel problems. Ten Feet Five (five members had ten feet altogether) provided bassist Peter Staples and guitarist Chris Britton. The new amalgamation was left with two bassists and no drummer, so Presley stepped up to the microphone and they recruited Ronnie Bond (nee Bullis) to play drums. Presley's conversion to lead singer proved to be a good move, as his sneer came through both on stage and on record as \"an arrogant attitude,\" which became a sort of trademark of the group.\n\nThey had first recorded a UK single for CBS (\"Lost Girl\"), which didn't chart. Manager Larry Page and Page One Productions then signed a distribution deal with Fontana just in time for \"Wild Thing.\" Although a huge international hit, the song got off to a somewhat confusing start in the US when the song and subsequent album were released here simultaneously on two different labels, Fontana and Atco, due to a misunderstanding. The followup single, \"With A Girl Like You\" [Fontana 1552] made #1 in England but lost sales here (making #29) because those who bought the Atco single found that the followup was actually the B-side of \"Wild Thing,\" pitting the followup against its own previous success. Their third single, \"I Can't Control Myself\" [Fontana 1557] was another UK blockbuster, reaching #2, but faltered in the US (making #43) when many of the program directors were reluctant to play it due to the \"blatantly suggestive\" nature of the song, which didn't quite have the actual sounds of lovemaking (Fontana would get to that later...), but Presley's vocal drooling was deemed a bit unseemly.\n\nThe next three Troggs singles all charted in the UK, but missed completely here, probably due at least in part to the group being type-cast as singing songs with sexual innuendo: \"Give It to Me\" [Fontana 1576, #12 UK], \"Any Way that You Want Me\" [Fontana 1585, #8 UK], and (of course, for the \"drugs\" part of \"sex, drugs, and rock & roll,\" even though it had nothing to do with drugs...) \"The Night of the Long Grass\" [Fontana 1593, #17 UK]. It wasn't until early 1968, with \"Love Is All Around\" [Fontana 1607, #2 UK] and its pure-as-the-driven-snow innocence, that they returned to the US top-10, making #7. But the next two singles missed the Top-100 altogether, and they were done...at least for awhile.\n\nIn early 1975, a single showed up at radio stations: \"Good Vibrations\" by the Troggs [Pye 71015]. \"Good God, now what?\" was a typical program director reaction, but the single proved to be what it promised - a Beach Boys classic given the Reg Presley \"drool and sneer\" treatment. \"Ahhhhhhhhhhhyy,\" the song starts, \"I like the clothes she almost wears\" (arguably one of the best opening lines in a rock song ever). It got loads of laughs at radio stations, but not much airplay, stalling at #102. About the same time, a bootleg recording called The Troggs Tape appeared, which was taken from an actual tape from one of their recording sessions. It boiled down to almost 12 minutes of four-letter words, which further reduced the group's reputation to little more than a joke. It wasn't until the highly acclaimed 1992 album Athens Andover [Page One/Rhino R2 71064], recorded with uncredited involvement from R.E.M., that the group became \"hip\" again.\n\nAnother English rock band signed by Fontana didn't have quite the success of the Troggs, but unbeknownst to them, were involved in one of the more spectacular record cover blunders in rock history. Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich started as a band in 1961 and by 1962 were playing in Hamburg clubs (like many other English bands, including the Beatles). They dressed in bright colored outfits almost like cartoon characters, and used a lot of humor in their stage act. By 1964, they were opening for the Honeycombs on their UK tour, and caught the attention of Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley, the songwriting/group manager duo sometimes credited as if it were one person, \"Howard Blaikley.\" The songwriters would write most of the group's hits. DDDBMT were signed to Fontana in 1965, and after two unsuccessful singles, finally hit the UK charts in December, 1965, with \"You Make It Move\" [UK Fontana TF 630, #26 UK]. It was also released here as Fontana 1537, but didn't chart. The next single was a great rocker, \"Hold Tight!\" [Fontana 1545] which reached #4 in the UK, but couldn't get airplay in the US except on the weekly \"British Invasion\" shows heard on some radio stations like WLS. Next came \"Hideaway\" [Fontana 1553, #10 UK], which also went nowhere in the US.\n\nIn the late fall of 1966, the group released \"Bend It\" [Fontana 1559], a dance record with possible double entendre, but no one could really be sure. But the line \"When the night is ending, we'll be bending...(pause)...heh, heh, heh\" was enough for some program directors to just know it must be dirty. It made #2 in England and #110 here as 1966 ended. US Fontana tried two more non-charting singles in 1967, \"Save Me\" [Fontana 1569] and \"Okay\" [Fontana 1591] before the group and the label parted ways. Fontana issued a Greatest Hits collection and the band signed with Imperial, where they had a minor hit with \"Zabadak\" [Imperial 66270, #52] in early 1968, followed by the bullwhip-cracking \"Legend of Xanadu\" [Imperial 66287, #123].\n\nOh, yes. The record cover fiasco. In 1981, Polydor in Italy (Orbis) put out a huge series of albums called Historia De La Musica Rock (\"The History of Rock Music\") with one or two volumes for each of about a hundred different artists. The volume by the Dave Clark Five came out with the cover featuring a group photo of Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich! Speculation about how this kind of quality control gaffe could occur was that the photos were all in an alphabetically arranged set of folders, and when reaching in to the \"Dave Clark Five\" folder, a hand accidentally reached into the folder behind it, which was \"Dave Dee.\" Or the photo could have been accidentally misfiled in the adjacent folder. But the really funny part of the situation was that nobody noticed the error until the album was in the stores! By then, they just figured, \"Ignore it. No one will notice.\"\n\nFor the record, \"Dave Dee\" was vocalist David Harman, \"Dozy\" was bassist Trevor Davies, \"Beaky\" was guitarist John Dymond, \"Mick\" was lead guitarist Michael Wilson, and \"Tich\" was drummer Ian Amey.\n\nThe other Fontana band that debuted with a #1 single in 1966 was the New Vaudeville Band, whose throwback to Rudy Valee and the megaphone days, \"Winchester Cathedral\" [Fontana 1562], caught the record buyers' fancy late in the year. The \"group\" was actually a collection of studio musicians hired by songwriter/producer Geoff Stevens to perform the song he wrote. Surprisingly, the record became an international hit, and he needed a group to go on the road to perform. Alas, a common tale, but a group was hired as \"The New Vaudeville Band\" and toured for a couple of years. The touring band included Alan Klein (vocals), Henri Harrison (drums), Stan Haywood (keyboards), Neil Korner then Chris Eddy (bass), Mick Wilsher (guitar), Hugh Watts (trombone), and Bob Kerr (trombone/saxophone). Three more singles in the same vein followed, including \"Peek-A-Boo\" [Fontana 1573, #72], \"Finchley Central\" [Fontana 1589, #122], \"Green Street Green\" [Fontana 1598], and \"Bonnie and Clyde\" [Fontana 1612, #122], after which the megaphone revival was put to rest.\n\nIn retrospect, 1966 was the best year for Fontana, with two #1 hits and a #2 hit in addition to several other chart records. By contrast 1967 to 1969 were pretty much all downhill. Releases by the new British band, The Herd, featuring the young guitarist Peter Frampton, were ignored, which was proving the rule for all Fontana's artists. (Frampton wasn't really ignorable. In the 1970s he had some of the best selling LPs of all time as well as numerous hits; in early 2008 he's constantly on TV and radio hawking Geico Insurance). A six-member vocal group called the Gals & Pals was good enough to merit two albums, but had no singles and no chart success. Other artists having singles during this period included The Mad Hatters, Bobby Skel (singer/songwriter who had the minor hit \"Kiss and Run\" on the Soft label), Tommy Ambrose, the Guess Who, Helen Reddy, and a host of artists who also had albums, including the Daughters of Albion, Chicago rockers the Little Boy Blues, Shades of Joy, jazz pianist Joe Henderson, Steel Image, Blond, and Tongue and Groove and their singer Lynn Hughes. All to no avail, chartwise.\n\nOther than the early 1968 hit \"Love Is All Around\" by the Troggs, there were only two more records of note before Mercury finally pulled the plug on the label in early 1970. In October, 1969, another \"stadium classic\" (like \"Wild Thing\") was born: Steam's \"Na Na Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye)\" [Fontana 1667], which reached #1 in late 1969. By the time the group was ready to put out a followup and an album in early 1970, Fontana was in the process of going under, and the album and followup single \"I've Gotta Make You Love Me\" [Mercury 73020] were released on the parent Mercury label.\n\nThe last chart single (and the last chart album) for the US Fontana label was certainly a classic: \"Je T'Aime...Mon, Non Plus\" [Fontana 1665] by Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg, who had made #1 in Europe with the record. The song featured a simulated sex session, with Birkin panting and whispering \"I Love You\" while deep-voiced Gainsbourg replied with phrases amounting to \"Me, neither.\" The song was banned in many venues, reaching only #58 on the US charts. Birkin was an actress, having appeared in, among other films, the Yardbirds' cult classic Blow Up. She was at one time married to British band leader John Barry, but in 1968 she married French songwriter Lucien \"Serge\" Gainsbourg, who had been successfully writing French rock songs for a few years. Many of these, like \"The Lollipops,\" had a double meaning, but when he recorded \"Je T'Aime\" with Bridget Bardot, the song was so hot and blatantly sexual that Bardot hesitated to agree to its release. He recorded a second version with his wife, and it was this version that became an international phenomenon, if not an international scandal. With a song like that, nothing could really follow it, so their US career, as well as the label itself, closed down.\n\nEarly singles used the Smash numbering sequence, as indicated by the \"S-\" prefix on the label at far left. About February, 1965, a new Fontana 1500 singles series was established, with an \"F-\" prefix. Deejay versions were white with black print. The same design was used for the label's entire life from 1962-1970. Reissue 45s used a different label design, as shown at near left. The album labels throughout Fontana's existence were light blue with black print. Mono labels, as shown on the far left, had \"A Custom High Fidelity Recording\" to the right of the center hole, while the stereo versions (shown near left) had \"A Stereophonic High Fidelity Recording.\" Most of the Fontana albums had a blank inner sleeve. There were, however, two known Fontana inner sleeves. The earlier one, shown at left, had illustrations of albums up to 27542/67542, and was used for albums released in late 1965 and most of 1966. The second Fontana inner sleeve, shown at left, which illustrated albums up to 27556/67556, was used for albums starting in late 1966 and through 1967. By 1968, they had been used up and Fontana reverted to plain sleeves."
