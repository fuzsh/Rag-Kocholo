        "text": "Post by George on\n\nFriday, February 29, 2008\n\nreaching out to you\n\nCurrent mood: hopeful\n\nhello family,\n\ni hope that all is well. as for me i am blessed. i feel good about my life and all that is going on in it. i am an overcomer. i will not break. this too will make me stronger. as you know i have been on the road promoting the new album \"private show\" to the best of my ability. so far so good especially since the label (arsenal records/max gousse) and the distribution company (fontana) that released \"private show\" has giving me absolutely no support up to this point. when i say no support i mean that there has been no promotion letting people know the album is in stores and you know what we went through with the album being pushed back 50/11 times and now that it's released no one really knows it exists. which really sucks but hey you have to play with the cards your dealt. then you have little to no distribution of the album in said stores (circuit city and best buy) which sucks even more because those of you who want to go into the stores and purchase the album have to search high and low and still might not be able to buy it. i know we live in a world of technology but not everyone has access to such technology nor does everyone have credit or debit cards to purchase digital downloads and there are some of us who actually want to have a hard copy and read the thank yous and credits. you would think that they were aware of this but i'm aware that common sense isn't so common. MOVING ON. as most of you know i had a court date january 22nd. the record label/distribution company rufftown entertainment was trying to sue me or i should say is trying to sue me because the lawsuit hasn't been dropped yet but the reason for the lawsuit is because the label arsenal records didn't promote my album \"the second coming\" and i'm being accused of not promoting the album as well. go figure. well, so far that situation is moving forward. i will keep you updated. hopefully we can mutually agree on a solution so that i can put this behind me. now that i've gotten that out of the way if any of you would like to reach out to fontana about \"private show\" here is fontana's information. you can contact them at Fontana Distribution 10 Universal City Plaza Suite 400 Universal City, Ca 91608 or you can call them at 1.877.878.FONTANA. hopefully this will help with getting the album put into more stores. i love you all and thank you for your continued support. love yourselves and respect one another.\n\nlove, light, and blessings\n\nyour biggest fan\n\nadina.\n\n5:53 PM"
