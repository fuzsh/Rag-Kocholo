However, it appears that the same tracks have been re-released on multiple occasions under various titles and artists.\n\nEnclave Radio\n\nEnclave Radio consists of public domain patriotic compositions also recorded by Westar Music.\n\nAmerica the Beautiful - Samual A.

Fallout 3 was released in 2008. The artist given is Rhodes & Pelfrey, as well as Kelly Richmond/Craig Riley.\n\nOther stations\n\nRadio Freedom plays colonial fiddle music and both Classical Radio stations play various tracks of classical music. The dates of the exact recordings and musicians are not known.\n\nNotes\n\nSome songs have more well-known versions by the same artist that do not appear in the games. Fallout versions may come from an entirely different decade, but the originals are included for context and marked with an asterisk.\n\nGenerally if there is a considerable time gap between the \"recorded\" dates and the first public release date, it is accounted for in release notes. Many of the songs licensed for Fallout were not available for public purchase at the time and existed on publicly obscure formats until they were digitized. The largest gap between the original recording date and the first public release is \"Anything Goes\" (1934 and 2004, 70 years).\n\nThe record labels listed are typically the first pressing of the US labels that originally issued the recording that the average consumer would have had access to unless otherwise marked. Many songs were first issued as singles until the invention of the vinyl LP album in 1948 where noted.\n\nLibrary music tracks are prioritized based on their original issue if known along with their Associated Production Music (APM) listing.\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nThe Fallout Bible makes passing references regarding the music of the world.[Dev 1][Dev 2][Dev 3]\n\nDespite Fallout: New Vegas having numerous references to Elvis Presley, developer Jason Bergman revealed on the Bethesda forums that performance rights to any of Elvis' songs would be too costly.[Dev 4]\n\nDeveloper Joshua Sawyer commented on the use of library music in Fallout: New Vegas because it was \"low-cost.\"[Dev 5]\n\nAudio director Mark Lampert commented on the music in Fallout 4 being a mix of the \"instantly recognizable,\" \"lesser-known tracks from well-known artists,\" and \"obscure tracks from long-forgotten bands.\"[Dev 6]\n\nThe original source material for the tracks encompasses a broad range of music formats which run the gamut from the traditional vinyl LP and 45 and the shellac 78 rpm record to the more obscure 16 inch transcription disc, Old Time Radio broadcasts, Snader Telescriptions, and library music as well as newer CDs."
