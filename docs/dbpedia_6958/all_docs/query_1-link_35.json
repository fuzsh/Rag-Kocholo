        "text": "Right, it’s high time I finished off my run of Michael Moorcock articles, so here goes: this article is going to cover the first book of the Sanctuary of the White Friars trilogy, a Savoy Books collection of some of Moorcock’s juvenilia and essays on his work, and a book of literary criticism in which he surveys the epic fantasy genre.\n\nThat might sound like a weird hodge-podge of books to cover in one article, but there is a logic to this. The White Friars trilogy is not yet finished – only the first book is out – but I didn’t enjoy the first book enough to want to finish reading the series even if Moorcock does get around to completing the rest, so I’ll hop off here. Thematically, though it’s unquestionably fiction it also involves Moorcock ruminating extensively both on his early career and on the role of the fantastic imagination in general, so the other two books are apt to consider alongside it. See, there’s been a logic to this all along!\n\nThe Whispering Swarm\n\nYoung Michael Moorcock is born during the early days of World War II, and grows up in a London that’s been ravaged by the Blitz. As the 1950s give way to the 1960s, he’s ended up blagging his way into a career in journalism, his enthusiasm for genre fiction gaining him the editorship of first Tarzan Adventures and then The Sexton Blake Library whilst he was still a teenager. One day, as he’s stopping by the printers’ to finalise a print run, Moorcock ends up talking to Friar Isidore – a friar in the distinctive white robes of the Carmelite Order, who uses the same press to produce a strange little multilingual pamphlet.\n\nIsidore guides Moorcock to Alsacia, a little enclave right in the City of London sat on land donated to the Carmelite Order by Henry III, where Moorcock visits the abbey and encounters figures such as Father Grammaticus, the leader of the Carmelite community there, and is impressed by the crowded and curiously archaic streets in the surrounding Alsacia. It gradually dawns on Moorcock that the Alsacia is not just some old-fashioned historical oddity tucked away in the city, much like the Inns of Court. Rather, it’s a weird little cosmic pocket – a part of the city which it’s not easy to get to by conventional means, and which makes it the ideal sanctuary for all manner of unfashionable and persecuted persons.\n\nThanks to a certain inborn ability to dimly perceive the residents of other planes of the multiverse, Moorcock is able to access the Alsacia going forwards. Befriending both the friars and a crowd of highwaymen led by the beautiful Captain Moll Midnight, Moorcock ends up torn between the realities of the 20th Century and this little bubble outside time, and is ultimately drawn into an audacious scheme to save Charles I from the executioner’s block in order to stop Cromwellian forces from destroying the Alsacia. As he wrangles with his double life over the course of the 1960s, Moorcock has his legendary run as editor of New Worlds and devises major works of his such as the early entries in the Elric and Jerry Cornelius series and the gleefully sacrilegious Behold the Man, with his experiences in the Alsacia informing his multiverse concept.\n\nContinue reading “Friars of the City (and a Moorcock Miscellany)” →\n\nAfter giving it a rest for a while, I’m back on my Michael Moorcock reviews, and whaddya know – I’ve painted myself in a corner. For the reviews in this series I’ve based the title of each of them on a pun based around one of Moorcock’s other series, and this time I need to make good on the pun I made in the title of my Silverheart review and I’m drawing a blank. Sorry, you just get a placeholder title for this one.\n\nAnyway, for this article I want to cover Moorcock’s standalone short stories (or at least a sizable cross-section of them), as collected in the anthology Earl Aubec, issued as part of Millennium/Orion’s Tale of the Eternal Champion anthology series in the 1990s as a compilation of a bunch of shorts that just didn’t quite fit in elsewhere in the compilations.\n\n(I’m also going to break from the format of the earlier reviews by not including a “multiverse bollocks” section at the end – I’ll mention multiverse callbacks where they crop up particularly blatantly but it’s been a bit long since I did the original run of articles and I’ve probably forgotten a bunch of connections.)\n\nEarl Aubec – sometime known as Master of Chaos – is the story of the titular Earl of Malador. Aubec’s world is a small, confined one, which has mostly been conquered by him in the service of his patron Queen; there’s only one language, for instance, and the edge of the world is within Aubec’s ability to hike to. There he tries to conquer the one place that he has yet to claim for his Queen: the Castle Kaneloon.\n\nHowever, of the course of the story it becomes apparent that Aubec does not understand his own world: he believes its bounds to have been as they always are, but it’s apparent that the borders of Chaos have moved over time – both pressing in further (there’s some stones he passes which seem to have dissolved somewhat, and Aubec briefly speculates that they may have encountered the raw stuff of Chaos before remembering that Chaos doesn’t come in this far) and having been pushed back in the past. (Aubec is aware of only one language in the whole world, though with dialects within it, and is surprised to discover a text written in an entirely foreign language.)\n\nContinue reading “(Pun Based On Silverheart)” →\n\nParallel universes are real, but amidst the myriad of alternate Earths which exist, only one has succeeded in combining a high level of technological accomplishment combined with a peaceful, benevolent social structure. This particular world, on discovering the existence of parallel timelines, designated itself as Zero-Zero on the multiversal co-ordinate system and, with the aid of the super-computer WOTAN and the agents of the Valhalla Project, has commenced a process of monitoring and studying the alternate worlds.\n\nSwiftly, it became apparent that not all was well. The Valhalla Project soon recognised the existence of another multiversal power out there – one which seemed to have preceded Valhalla on the scene, and which from its as-yet-unidentified home timeline had interfered in the development of innumerable other universes. In fact, Zero-Zero’s near-Utopian idyll was only possible because so far they had been spared from this force’s influence.\n\nFor want of a better term, Valhalla duly designated this force as “the Disruptors”, and began action to counter their influence. A range of individuals with unique psionic talents are capable of aiding Valhalla; for instance, the remarkable Rose Wilde has an intense rapport with her alternate selves in other universes, so the Zero-Zero version of Rose has effectively recruited the others as an extended transdimensional intelligence network. Even more amazing are the capabilities of the one and only Luther Arkwright – a unique individual among the parallels, Arkwright was born with the ability to psionically project himself from timeline to timeline without outside assistance. Kidnapped at birth by the Disruptors, Arkwright’s success in escaping them and staying one step ahead of them allowed for his recruitment by Valhalla.\n\nNow, however, matters are coming to a head. The mysterious Firefrost artifact has been obtained and activated by the Disruptors, prompting an increase of chaos across all timelines; eventually, the entire multiverse will unravel if they are not stopped. In response, Valhalla activates their backup plan: Ragnarok. Arkwright is sent to a strategically important timeline – one in which the English Civil War has been left unresolved for over 300 years thanks to the influence of the Disruptors, resulting in an England where a fascistic Puritan regime is ruled over by the Cromwell dynasty whilst Royalists are a despised minority. Arkwright’s job is to assist the Royalists – not because their cause is all that much better than the Puritans’, but because doing so will hopefully prompt a reaction from the Disruptors, allowing Arkwright and WOTAN to track down their home timeline and put a stop to them for good…\n\nContinue reading “Puritans, Purges, and Parallel Worlds” →\n\nOne of the interesting developments in rock music as the 1960s gave way into the 1970s was the diversification of styles. The loosely connected genres of folk rock and psychedelic rock had made a case for popular music in general and rock in particular to be a medium for genuine, grown-up artistic expression, rather than disposable entertainment for teens; but once you say “this doesn’t have to be like that“, you invite people to imagine all sorts of different ways it could be.\n\nFolk rock and country rock singer-songwriters used the medium to examine tradition or social roots, critically or uncritically. Glam rock took the popular acclaim and youth appeal of earlier years, teased out the sexuality, and made it a bit more ambiguous. Blues rock gave way to hard rock if it still cared about being sexy, metal in slow and fast flavours if it went for other moods. Progressive rock groups explored just how far you could stretch the rock format, cramming in tools from classical or jazz as necessary to broaden the field available to them.\n\nIn a decades-early preview of the musical fragmentation we see today in this Bandcamp age (where nobody has to listen to exactly what everyone else is listening to and it sometimes seems there’s more microgenres than musicians), the experimental wings of rock music ended up spawning bands with astonishingly distinctive personalities. Oh, sure, you could sort them under one broad umbrella or another, and there were plenty of me-too groups out there inspired by others’ sounds, but within prog (for example) you’d never mistake Jethro Tull for Yes or King Crimson for Genesis.\n\nContinue reading “Footprints In the Sands of Time” →\n\nThe Doctor and Amy have received word that Freddie Force and his Antimatter Men are up to no good. In order to be in the right place at the right time, the Doctor decides to hook up with some old chums of his – the Terraphiles, a subculture of far-future history nerds who enjoy LARPing it up in as close a reconstruction of Earth as they can accomplish – though the only historical sources they have is an idiosyncratic collection of boys’ adventure fiction and sports stories from the 1920s. At Miggea, the Arrow of Law will be challenged for and won in a tournament, and the future of the cosmos relies on the Doctor and Amy ensuring the right parties win – and making sure that Captain Cornelius and the Pirates of the Second Ether weigh in on the right side.\n\nThis, then, is the premise of Michael Moorcock’s The Coming of the Terraphiles, his Doctor Who tie-in novel. The history of such novels is a long run; during the series’ original run, they tended to be brief novelisations of the televised serials, pitched at a reading level of around 9-12 in keeping with the series’ target audience. Rather than being directly published by the BBC, these were licenced products issued by Target Books. During the long hiatus after Sylvester McCoy’s tenure in the role came to an end, the book series found itself in the hands of Virgin Books after they bought out Target’s parent company; realising that in the absence of a TV show in current production the Who audience was aging, Virgin started putting out a series of books for older readers presenting entirely new stories – the New Adventures line continued the Seventh Doctor’s story and allowed the authors to bring some of the plot arcs seeded during the McCoy era to fruition, whilst the Missing Adventures line would tell brand-new stories of earlier Doctors.\n\nContinue reading “Doctor Who and the Distant Sports” →\n\nThis article was originally published on Ferretbrain. I’ve backdated it to its original Ferretbrain publication date but it may have been edited and amended since its original appearance.\n\nWith the extensive 1990s repackaging and revision of the Eternal Champion material wrapped up, and with the Second Ether series supposedly having provided a capstone to the saga, the early 2000s found Michael Moorcock in the happy position of apparently not having much in the way of unfinished business. The major exception was the long-awaited The Vengeance of Rome, the fourth Colonel Pyat novel – but due to both the extensive research demanded by the Pyat novels and the extreme care demanded by the subject matter meant that it couldn’t be rushed.\n\nKing of the City in 2000 got a reasonable critical response, but critical approval and commercial success are two different things: the market is perpetually hungry for more sword and sorcery fantasy from Moorcock, particularly from his signature series like Elric, Hawkmoon or Corum, and in the first half of the Noughties he provided. The trilogy produced then heavily features Elric – indeed, it’s been anthologised as Elric: The Moonbeam Roads – and to a large extent the seed of the trilogy was sown in the Elric novel The Fortress of the Pearl, but tonally it stands apart from the rest of the Elric material. Part of this is because to a large extent these books are also followups to the Von Bek novels, taking their timeline into the 20th Century, as well as crossing over with Moorcock’s Sexton Blake pastiches (in which it was hinted that Zenith the Albino, Blake’s regular adversary, was actually Elric somehow transferred to the modern day).\n\nInterestingly, for a long time the second and third books in this trilogy didn’t get a UK release, with only Moorcock’s US publishers picking up the full series. That has recently changed, with each of the books being republished in the UK (though confusingly, they’ve come out under new titles). Have we been missing out, or were we spared the embarrassment? Let’s see…\n\nContinue reading “Elric: A Von Bek Fantasy” →\n\nThis article was originally published on Ferretbrain. I’ve backdated it to its original Ferretbrain publication date but it may have been edited and amended since its original appearance.\n\nKaradur-Shriltasi is a city at the centre of the Multiverse. (Well, one centre of the Multiverse, at any rate – a completely different one appears at the end of the Second Ether sequence.) In ages past, a destructive war amongst the residents resulted in a great separation; the upper city of Karadur has been ruled for generations by the Metal Clans, guardians of rationality, materialism, and order, whilst the forces of magic, superstition and intuition were banished to Shriltasi, an arboreal realm hidden below the sewers of Karadur.\n\nOne nagging thorn in the side of the Metal authorities is Max Silverskin, a master thief and the bastard son of a tryst between Augustus of Clan Silver (who along with Iron, Gold and Copper represent the major Clans) and Sophelia of the Silverheart family, minor nobility with a bad reputation for dabbling in forbidden magic. Unbeknownst to Max, during a mysterious rescue from the prison of Gragonatt he was given a witch-mark: the titular “silverheart”, a metal disc over his heart which is usually disguised with illusions. Through the mark, Max becomes able to access hitherto untapped magical powers as a result of a botched attempt to steal the Jewel of All Time, a magical gemstone which derives its power from the deadly ruby rays of the Red Moon. Falling in with Jenny and Jack Ash, leaders of the plant-like Ashen, and with unexpected help from Rose Iron – daughter of Lord Iron, leader of the Metal council – Max learns that he has just six days to reunite the lost icons of the Metal Clans and effect a reconciliation between Karadur and Shriltasi.\n\nThe stakes couldn’t be higher, for Jenny and Jack believe that not only will the Silverheart consume Max if he fails, but Karadur-Shriltasi – and the entire Multiverse – will be overcome by entropy. But Max and Rose will face many complications along the way, including a deadly cult of the long-lost foundryman’s goddess Sekmet and the relentless Captain Cornelius Coffin, a troubleshooter for the Metal who is determined to arrest Max and win Rose’s heart…\n\nContinue reading “To Rescue Karadur” →\n\nThis article was originally published on Ferretbrain. I’ve backdated it to its original Ferretbrain publication date but it may have been edited and amended since its original appearance.\n\nThe three books of Michael Moorcock’s Second Ether trilogy rattled out in rapid succession, between 1994 and 1996. Even though two of the three books relied heavily on already-published material, the bulk of said material had emerged in 1991-1995. This means it was prepared whilst Moorcock was wrapping up the extensive process of compilation and revision that produced the (mildly differing) UK and US Eternal Champion omnibus editions of his earlier work.\n\nIt’s little surprise, then, that here he indulges a lot of the habits he indulged in whilst compiling the omnibuses. In the omnibuses Moorcock showed a distinct tendency to parachute in more overt references to the Multiverse in his earlier work, often in the form of renaming characters so their surnames would be some variant of “von Bek”; here, the von Beks take centre stage, as though this trilogy forms something of a sequel to the earlier von Bek novels. Moorcock tacking on new books onto an earlier series is often a bad sign – the post-Stormbringer additions to the Elric saga were pretty useless in my estimation, and my objections to much of the latter-day Jerry Cornelius stuff is a matter of record. It’s an even worse sign when he’s resurrecting a sub-par series where the originals were no great shakes; the second Courm trilogy, whilst I thought it was somewhat better than the original books, was still kind of limp and lightweight, and the second Hawkmoon trilogy was a crime against literature.\n\nOn the other hand, I always thought that the von Bek novels had a lot of unrealised potential, so perhaps this time around Moorcock will finally deliver the goods. With this in mind, I commenced reading the Second Ether series with an open mind, hoping that it would prove to be a cut above a lot of Moorcock’s more recent fantasy cash-ins.\n\n(Spoiler: it’s shit.)\n\nContinue reading “The White Wolf’s Rehash” →\n\nThis article was originally published on Ferretbrain. I’ve backdated it to its original Ferretbrain publication date but it may have been edited and amended since its original appearance.\n\nMichael Moorcock’s fiction comes back time and time again to cities. Jerry Cornelius is specifically constructed as an urban character and the main Cornelius quartet concludes with (one version of) Jerry becoming the patron of the Platonic futurist ur-city. Each novel of the Pyat quartet is named after a city, and the series itself is punctuated by the different cities Pyat visits. And time and time again, Moorcock comes back to London, his home city.\n\nThe London Novel – a book to sum up all that is London and to justify its perception of itself as the centre of the universe – is a popular thing to attempt. Moorcock has often verged on doing it in his other series, and has made two serious stabs at it. Mother London, from 1988, earned enough literary cred to get on the Whitbread shortlist; King of the City didn’t. Good call by the Whitbread committee or bad call? Let’s find out…\n\nContinue reading “Sanctuary of the Wild Telepaths” →\n\nThis article was originally published on Ferretbrain. I’ve backdated it to its original Ferretbrain publication date but it may have been edited and amended since its original appearance.\n\nAt the start of the 1980s, Michael Moorcock’s fortunes were looking down. Massive disruptions to his home life coincided with the setback of Byzantium Endures, the first of the Colonel Pyat books, being rejected by his publishers, who informed him that they really weren’t interested in any mainstream novels from him and perhaps would he like to knock off some of that heroic fantasy he does that sells so magnificently well.\n\nMoorcock shrugged and went back to the drawing board, with the result that despite being written after Byzantium Endures, The War Hound and the World’s Pain actually got published first. It’s the first of a series of novels Moorcock has written about the von Bek family, who he decided to make an utterly central family to the multiverse whose scions popped up absolutely everywhere and who counted several incarnations of the Eternal Champion amongst their ranks.\n\nThanks to the regular processes of revision he inflicts on his works – truly, Moorcock is the literary George Lucas – Moorcock has retroactively inserted the von Bek name into a range of earlier stories and novels as part of the process of making them the core family of his fiction – including turning the protagonists of The Blood-Red Game and The Pleasure Garden of Felipe Sagittarius into von Beks. I find this both a self-vandalism of Moorcock’s legacy and an utterly pointless exercise, so for the purposes of this review I will not be tackling any of those. (I already covered The Blood-Red Game in any case in an overview of Moorcock’s early standalone novels; as for The Pleasure Garden, it’s a brief and not very interesting short story which includes an alternate universe version of Hitler for cheap shock value, so I wouldn’t say it’s especially essential.)\n\nFurthermore, I won’t be covering this time around any books Moorcock wrote after The War Hound in which a von Bek plays a prominent role but isn’t the main protagonist, or where the books in question are not part of the core von Bek series but are more properly considered parts of other series. For instance, a von Bek appears prominently in The Dragon In the Sword, but John Daker/Erekosë is clearly the protagonist of that one, and likewise whilst the von Beks play an important role in the Second Aether trilogy those books aren’t part of the core von Bek series.\n\nMoorcock originally intended to produce a trilogy of major works of heroic fantasy featuring von Beks as protagonists – The War Hound and the World’s Pain, The City In the Autumn Stars, and Manfred; or the Gentleman Houri. Only two of these manifested (both of which are reviewed here); Manfred was supposed to be a direct sequel to The City In the Autumn Stars, making use of material which was cut from it (apparently about half the novel was cut back, which is quite alarming considering how amazingly long and overblown it is… but I’ll get to that later), but the material is now apparently lost and Moorcock doesn’t seriously expect to get around to tracking it down or reconstructing it in his lifetime. However, in between the two novels which did emerge there slipped out a little side dish in the form of The Brothel in Rosenstrasse, a historical novel with no supernatural, fantastic or SF elements which happened to feature a von Bek protagonist and had plentiful connections to the other two books, and which is usually considered to be, if not part of the main von Bek series, at least an interesting appendix to it, so I’ll be reviewing that too.\n\nContinue reading “The History of the Von Beks” →"
