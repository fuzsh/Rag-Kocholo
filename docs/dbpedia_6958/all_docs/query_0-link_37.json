We questioned that the poet intentionally used hard consonant sounds (for example) and various far-flung word associations. And yes - some may be there by accident, others by direct design, but most (depending on the writer) are subconscious in the writer's mind. For example if I wanted to describe an apple I could say:\n\nThe apple was round, green and moist.\n\nA better writer would say:\n\nThe apple was bursting ripe, a tight round skin and moist pink flesh.\n\nObviously I have used more decorative language in the second example, but it also evokes the symbolism of apples in literature: sex. Also I have used lots of 'r' and 's' sounds which give the example a flowing, rolling sound. Initially that was unconscious, but then a non-accidental writer would 'sculpt' the text. I sculpted the text to emphasis this:\n\nThe apple was bursting ripe, a stretched round skin and moist flesh.\n\nAll I've done is removed the 'pink' as I thought it was too overt and unnecessary (also lacked r and s sounds) and substituted stretched for tight. Looking at a small section of text this way shows how a writer can coolly mould sentences to give the best effect.\n\nPatrick O'Brian is not a poet, but he is a highly aware author. He knew what he was doing. To look at his names for example: The name Diana is appropriate for Mrs Villiers because of it's associations with the huntress god. To a reader already acquainted with the Roman mythology it would give an added 'feel' to the character that O'Brian would not need to describe, just as the 'r' and 's' sounds supply something that would take many more words to describe. Diana's name is an example of a logical, thinking connection in the author's mind. To come to Pullings: say it to yourself: 'pullings', without any connection to character. Now compare with 'babbington'. Pullings is a simple two-syllable word, and to me is does give vague connections to solidity, hard work etc. Babbington is flashier: three-syllables and for some reason reminds me of a monkey (A baboon for all love!). The other things that Ray mentioned are also things that just wallow on the edge of a reader's mind, waiting to associate themselves:\n\nRay McPherson wrote:\n\nPullings. Hummmmm. If we assume that POB used every name to explain something, then maybe Pullings is a man who has to drag himself hand-over-hand up the naval ladder without any safety net.\n\nBabbington--baby? Mowett?????\n\nThese are, I believe more sub-conscious connections in the author's mind than Diana's name. He probably never realised he thought it, but could you imagine swapping the names of Jack's earliest mids around? It just doesn't work - and not simply because I know the characters, and could not imagine changing their names - it's deeper than that.\n\nWhen analysing a work of literature we have to remember that it is the product of what's inside the writer's head. A human brain isn't very good at making things up from scratch. If you were asked to create a name for a character, the chances are you'd wouldn't make the name up. Some things may not have any meaning to the reader, being perhaps, the name of POB's first school friend. But others such as Diana's name have direct literary connections, and others such as Pullings have more unconscious associations.\n\nWith a writer like O'Brian, names are of course, not the only symbolism etc. used in the books. The Polychrest/Diana example is a good one. Once you've read the stories it's time to look for the threads and cross threads.

Thanks for a very cogent explanation, Sam. We've discussed some of POB's poems before, and concluded that he was a better novelist than poet, I think. However POB's conscious use of names, symbols and precise word choices shows up wonderfully in his short stories, most of which are much darker and oblique than the Aubreyad. IMO, his writing shares many qualities with poetry. For one thing, like poetry, one has to read more carefully than with most fiction: miss a word and you can miss the entire point of a paragraph. His writing is also more 'sensual' - color, sound, touch are incorporated throughout the writing. And his writing reads extremely well aloud, too.\n\nRowen\n\nFrom: Jean A\n\nSubject: Re: Apples and Literature\n\nDate: Tue, 23 Oct 2001 10:32:14 EDT\n\nI don't believe anyone has mentioned the hapless and, ultimately, betraying Scrivener.\n\nSurely, in this instance, POB chose the name deliberately!\n\nJean A.\n\nFrom: Stephen Chambers\n\nDate: Tue, 23 Oct 2001 22:31:59 +0100\n\nSubject: Re: Apples and Literature\n\nBetraying, how?

I was struck by Jack's feelings about the Polycrest on pages 231-2 of the hardbound edition: \". . .but he could not love her. She was a mean-spirited vessel, radically vicious, cross-grained, laboursome, cruel in her unreliability; and he could not love her.\" I think this is a reflection of his relationship with Diana.\n\nEarlier in PC he tells Christie-Palliere (page 97-8): \"But, however, as soon as I thought things were going along capitally with her, and that we were very close friends, she pulled me up as though I had run into a boom, and asked me who the devil I thought I was? . . .

This happens quite often in POB, much more often than in, say, Clancy. I don't think it's an accident. I doubt that he worked very long to get these connections in, but I think they occurred to him and he had a chuckle as he inserted them.\n\nWhen one of O'Brian's characters has a dream, it's not there just to fill a page - his books are too tightly drawn for that. The dream relates to an event in the book - either as foreshadowing or as the character's subconscious processing of the event. When an animal event mimics a human event, it's there as deliberate humor. He knew what he was doing, a deep old file. He didn't draw arrows, he was satisfied that some readers would get the connections, others wouldn't mind the brief digression, since the parallel only takes up a sentence or two.\n\nMy vote: deliberate, but not over-worked.\n\nFrom: Gregg Germain\n\nDate: Mon, 22 Oct 2001 13:54:26 -0700\n\nSubject: Re: POB: Post Captain\n\nI think it's possible to find all sorts of meanings that seem to have a connection but that the author never ever heard of.\n\nGregg Sailing Master, Artillery Capt., Glover's Marblehead Regiment (GMR)\n\nFrom: Thistle Farm\n\nDate: Mon, 22 Oct 2001 16:58:05 EDT\n\nSubject: Re: POB: Post Captain\n\nNever heard of?

It has been over 40 years since I studied (or read) Elizabethan drama, but I remember that the authors often used the names to describe the predominant characteristic of the dramatis personnae: for example, \"Truewit\" and \"Truelove.\" POB does this very subtly. Consider the following:\n\nSophia--means wisdom and is the name of one of his his first ships which he loves and loses. (Don't think beyond the first 2 books.)\n\nAubrey--the name of an elf king in German mythology implying eternal youth and superior powers. Jack's nautical abilities are almost magical.\n\nMaturin--haven't found anything definitive; how- ever, I think this means mature. Stephen often cares for Jack as a parent would a child.\n\nDiana---Divine--also goddess of nature and fertility, but I don't think that necessarily fits.\n\nPreserved--Killick performs a preserving function for both Jack and Stephen in providing human comforts, preparing food, clothes, etc.\n\nBonden--he is bound to Jack throughout the canon.\n\nScriven--that's easy and not very subtle.\n\nVat denk je?\n\nRay McP\n\nFrom: Susan Wenger\n\nDate: Mon, 22 Oct 2001 13:14:18 -0700\n\nSubject: Re: POB: Post Captain\n\nYessss.

I have definitely seen it taken too far (one literature class I took as an undergrad got into a debate about whether the use of that versus which in some novel was simply a grammar mistake or an attempt to objectify the object - I quit my English major the next day). But I think the major difference between very good writers and average writers is that in POB there is enough subtlety to question whether the allusions are intentional or whether we the readers are being clever. Ayn Rand, who was a decent philosopher but a poor writer in my estimation, never left any doubt. The \"allusions\" slap you in the face and kick you in the shins.

I have a \"from the horse's mouth\" insight on this which I can partly share with the list - even though it must remain an anonymous insight, it's an interesting one. A very well-known, top-flight South African author (wrote in Afrikaans) once told me in confidence that he was constantly astounded at what literary critics read into his work - he went so far as to say that he could hardly recognise what they came up with as his own writing - and, yes, this was a very highly educated and intelligent man. His opinion of literary criticism (translated from a letter that I've kept to this day): \"a right load of balls. The author writes what makes sense to his mind and resonates in his heart at that time on that day; and the reader sees what makes sense to his mind and resonates in his heart at that time on that day; and these two, both honest, need not be the same at all. But the literary critic, who has no head and no heart but only ego, twists and turns the written word into some grandiose, allusion-filled, 'meaningful' artificial sham of a schema that only an ass would want to be associated with.\"\n\nMy feeling is that authors do, of course, consciously come up with some stuff eg the reference to JA seeing Dillon lying on the Cacafuego's deck \"with a great wound in his heart\". Other stuff is generated from the subconscious; and I'd put many of the passages where we see JA's take on something and then, not too much later, SM's take on the same or similar subject as being in this category - I know that I often think \"oh yes! now there's something I could usefully have character X think about\" and I end up, during editing, finding that more characters than X had the thought (I'm not saying all the JA/SM things are like this, but I'm dead sure some are). And, finally, still other stuff, a whole LOT of stuff, exists only in the minds of the devoted reader which isn't to say it's not \"true\". POB didn't have to INTEND an allusion consciously for an insight to be true for a reader.

The East Indiaman Lord Nelson was attacked by the French privateer Bellone on Aug. 14, 1803. Despite very stiff resistance from the Lord Nelson, the privateer did capture her, and both ships headed for the Spanish port of Corunna. When a British frigate appeared on the scene, the Bellone drew her off. The Lord Nelson was subsequently attacked by the Seagull, 18, with the battle extending through the night and into the next day. The French-held Lord Nelson was on the verge of making her escape when Sir Edward Pellew's squadron of four ships of the line made their appearance.\n\nThe cutting out of the Fanciulla from Chaulieu harbor is mostly the invention of POB, but there are some loose ties to the exploits of the Dart. The Dart was an experimental sloop with similarly shaped bow and stern, and armed entirely with carronades. On the night of July 7, 1800, the Dart accompanied by several smaller vessels and boats attacked four French frigates anchored in Dunkirk harbor. Crewmen from the Dart managed to board and cut out one of the frigates, the Desiree, 40.\n\nThe final battle, in which four British frigates encountered the four Spanish treasure ships, happened on Oct. 5, 1804, pretty much as described by POB. A few of the captain's names are different, including Jack Aubrey substituting for the Lively's regular captain, Hammond. The Spanish Mercedes did blow up, and the other three frigates struck to the British. And because war had not officially been declared between Britain and Spain, the officers and crew were denied their normal shares of prize money.\n\nDon Seltzer\n\nFrom: Steve Ross\n\nDate: Wed, 31 Oct 2001 13:17:35 -0600\n\nSubject: GRP:PC The Cover\n\nI seem providentially to have dropped in at a time when a progressive Group Read cum discussion is under way.

While I cannot say that I see anything disintguishable in the line of fire - it seems that the smoke is fairly well obscuring anything that they might be firing at - my eye was drawn to the tall, straight figure standing in the foreground. It strikes me that this was the closest that Geoff Hunt ever came to an actual depiction of Jack Aubrey, with his ubiquitous yellow hair in a queue and hat worn in the somewhat outdated Nelson style. For those who will be in Newport this weekend, I would love it if someone could pose the question to Geoff. Is this indeed meant to be a depiction of Jack Aubrey?

If you look at the angle of the gun barrel, it appears as if the gun has just fired into the sea a few yards off the port bow.

A physics student would start out with conservation of momentum. The mass and velocity of the cannonball is matched by the mass and velocity of the recoil of the cannon, which eventually gets transmitted to the sideways motion of the ship.\n\nSo, fire a single starboard 18-lber at 1500 ft/sec. MV = 27,000. The 4000 lb gun will recoil at 6.75 ft/sec. The breeching ropes stop the recoil and transmit the momentum to the 1000 ton ship. The ship will \"recoil\" sideways at a fraction of an inch per second.\n\nThat simple analysis assumes that the gun is level with the ship's natural center of rotation, about which it rolls. Fire a gun on the quarterdeck, perhaps ten feet above this center of rotation, and you create a moment which will tend to make the ship roll a bit to larboard. How much depends upon how the ship's mass is distributed, but I expect that the motion would be slight for a frigate or larger.\n\nRegarding the PC cover illustration, I originally thought that it portrayed the Lively chasing the Spanish frigate in the final scene of PC. I recall, though, that someone (Bruce?) asked Geoff Hunt about it, and he replied that it was just a gunnery exercise. In either case, I am surprised that the two forward bow chasers are drawn as carronades, rather than long guns.\n\nDon Seltzer\n\nFrom: Steve Ross\n\nDate: Thu, 1 Nov 2001 10:19:35 -0600\n\nSubject: Re: GRP:PC The Cover\n\nDon, thank you for this answer! On the question of the chasers, though, wouldn't this indicate that the ship in question is not the Lively, but the Polychrest? My already-dim memory of what I read a few days ago seems to indicate that the Polychrest was equipped only with carronades, and that Jack had two of them moved to the bow when he needed a chaser. If this is correct, then it provides a possible answer to the mystery: The scene is the Polychrest's extended pursuit of the privateer Bellone, which ended in Jack's being thanked and rewarded by representatives of the merchant fleet, and chewed out by that grasping, infernal scrub Harte. No surprise that people in the scene are so calm; as O'Brian tells us, despite occasional gunfire in both directions, the chase settled into a kind of routine, with the turning of the glass, the bell rung regularly, hands piped to dinner, etc.\n\nAs for Kathryn Guare's note about the figure standing on the rail being Jack, I agree completely. In fact, I seem to recall having heard someone once remark that Jack could be found in EVERY Hunt cover illustration. I can't claim to have done a systematic study, but I have looked, and in some cases this is demonstrably untrue (although, to be fair, I didn't use a microscope). There are some other covers, however, in which some of the officers do look rather Aubreyesque.

She is cynical, but not nearly cynical enough, whatever she may say. If she were, I should not be obsessed.\"\n\nIf I read this correctly, he is saying that Diana's coquetry is rendered \"innocent\" and even pleasing by the fact that it is not totally dishonest: because she does honestly feel something of what she pretends. Should that change, ie should her behaviour become all \"sham\" with no substance behind it to redeem it, then his feelings would change.

As for the loss, that very trifling loss, I applaud it and wish it may continue. She will always have that quality of being more intensely alive, that spirit, dash and courage, that almost ludicrous, infinitely touching unstudied unconscious grace. But if, as she says, her face is her fortune, then she is no longer Croesus; her wealth is diminishing ... it may reach a level at which I am no longer an object of contempt. That, at all events, is my only hope; and hope I must. The vulgarity is new, and it is painful beyond my power of words to express: there was the appearance of it before, even at that very ball, but *then* it was either facetious or the outcome of the received notions of her kind - the reflected vulgarity of others; *now* it is not ... Shall I one day find her making postures, moving with artful negligence? That would destroy me. Vulgarity: how far am I answerable for it? In a relationship of this kind each makes the other, to some extent. No man could give her more opportunity for exercising all her worst side than I.\"\n\nHe is, indeed, fated to see her \"making postures, moving with artful negligence\" - the death of what he most loved in her: \"that ... infinitely touching unstudied unconscious grace\".\n\nHow typical of Stephen that he considers whether he is not at least partially to blame for the corruption of Diana: and one can't help feeling that, although he tries to dismiss a similar thought at the opera (p 472), he isn't really able to do so. Stephen's seeing an analogy to himself in the miseries of Mr Jones, Polychrest's purser (PC 288-289) - \"A man cannot still be asking; and what you ask for is not given free ... a man cannot make a whore of his own wife\" - must surely rank as one of the saddest pieces of introspection on Stephen's part in The Canon.\n\nLondon Lois\n\n51° 28' 50\" N\n\n000° 10' 53\" W\n\nFrom: Isabelle Hayes\n\nDate: Mon, 5 Nov 2001 04:20:21 -0500\n\nSubject: Re: Groupread: PC Diana SPOILER WARNING\n\nI like the extremes of what Stephen goes through in his feelings about Diana: at one time he is sure he no longer admires her, that she has lost the qualities that made her special, so that we then are ready for him to not love her any more, and what happens? he goes and forgets all his prior insights about her, and we find that he is still mad about her. This is very like \"real life\", wherein we all make resolutions about our emotional lives in moments of cool blood, and then, when we're in the midst of our hot blood once again, all our resolve goes by the board.\n\nAlso, I'm rereading TYA, which is the book before the one in which Diana dies. I have just read the part where Stephen has been at Woolcombe and had a wonderful reunion with Diana, as well as Brigid, Sophie, etc. Diana once again drives him to the port where he is to catch a ride to Jack's ship, and Stephen and Diana are alone to say goodbye, which they do \"as lovers\", sadly, unwillingly,etc.\n\nI think this may be the last time he ever sees her.

It is night-time: \"... far on his right hand the barking of a roe-buck in search of a doe, and on his left the distant screaming of a rabbit with a stoat at work upon it. An owl.\"\n\nApplicability of all this to SM is too obvious to be coincidence - or is it?\n\nOn the right (the lucky side), the buck in search of a doe; the suffering rabbit on the left, the unlucky side. All aspects of what SM experienced in and brought to the relationship with Diana exemplified: the lust, the suffering/dying (for she certainly killed part of Stephen) and the wisdom. Even a friendly wisdom, if owls may in general be said to represent that quality. And all of this the more striking because immediately following this passage, Stephen sees the house \"And under the elms his own cob tethered to a hazel-bush.\"\n\nLondon Lois\n\n51° 28' 50\" N\n\n000° 10' 53\" W\n\nFrom: Gregory Edwards\n\nDate: Thu, 1 Nov 2001 21:11:00 -0800\n\nSubject: Re: Groupread: PC nature applied to Stephen SPOILER WARNING\n\nAnd elsewhere in PC where Diana invites SM and JA to dinner to dine on Dover Sole, I wonder who is dining on whose soul...\n\nWas Dover Sole then a famous dish?\n\nGreg Edwards, prefering abalone\n\nFrom: Lois Anne du Toit\n\nDate: Thu, 1 Nov 2001 13:53:41 -0000\n\nSubject: Groupread: PC SM and nautical knowledge SMALL SPOILER\n\nThere is an instance of unusual nautical knowledge displayed by SM at p198 (Norton h/c) where he writes in his diary: \" ... a powerful squadron moving out past Haslar in line ahead, all studdingsails abroad ...\"\n\nNot very great knowledge, to be sure, but he recognises the formation and the sails carried ... unwonted expertise that I don't think would occur in the later books of the Canon.\n\nLondon Lois\n\n51° 28' 50\" N\n\n000° 10' 53\" W\n\nFrom: Gregg Germain\n\nDate: Thu, 1 Nov 2001 08:39:00 -0800\n\nSubject: Re: GRP:PC The Cover\n\nGregg Germain wrote:\n\nI'm doing this from memory (don't have the book with me), but doesn't the ship in the illustration have pitifully low barricades?

Finally, he is almost overcome by the loneliness he feels, but not quite; he dissembles about his plans, mentioning, inter alia, that his next stop will be London.\n\nDiana exclaims: \"'... But Brighton is quite out of your way - I had imagined you had to go to Portsmouth when you offered me a lift. Why have you come so far out of your way?'\n\n'The dew-ponds, the wheatears, the pleasure of driving over grass.'\n\n'What a dogged brute you are, Maturin, upon my honour,' said Diana. 'I shall lay out for no more compliments.'\n\n'No, but in all sadness,' said Stephen, 'I like sitting in a chaise with you; above all when you are like this. I could wish this road might go on for ever.'\n\nThere was a pause; the chaise was filled with waiting; but he did not go on, and after a moment she said with a forced laugh, 'Well done, Maturin. You are quite a courtier. But I am afraid I can see its end already. There is the sea ... ' \"\n\nFinally, Stephen finds she is to stay with Lady Jersey (whose crowd he connects with Canning). Diana is at pains to point out the family connections and the respectability of her hostess. Conversation becomes merely superficial: and the incident ends thus:\n\n\"They parted at Lady Jersey's door, having said nothing more, amidst the flurry of servants and baggage: tension, artificial smiles.\"\n\nAmong the questions I have here:\n\n1. \"the chaise was filled with waiting\" : for what from whom? is Stephen waiting for some equally tender remark from Diana? Might he, given the smallest encouragement, actually have gone on to declare his feelings? And what of Diana? Is she waiting for some more fervent avowal from him, and does she become cruel when this is not forthcoming? Or, handed what she has been angling for, does she simply play the coquette and withdraw? Or does Stephen give her more than she expected, enough so for her to get \"stage fright\" and and make a hasty and incidentally cruel withdrawal?\n\n2. am I right in thinking the fruitless wait, rather than Lady Jersey's crowd with its implication of Canning (and possibly rakishness), is what drove them to the \"tension, artificial smiles\"?\n\n3. what is the significance for all the conversation that follows of Diana's having refused Stephen's conversational gambit about his friendship with JA?\n\nLondon Lois wondering whether she's just having a bad brain day or whether this passage is really unusually elliptical ...\n\nFrom: Mary Arndt\n\nDate: Wed Nov 07 2001 - 13:32:26 EST\n\nSubject: PC: Stephen's coach journey with Diana - SMALL SPOILER\n\nLois Anne du Toit wrote:\n\nAmong the questions I have here: 1. \"the chaise was filled with waiting\" : for what from whom? is Stephen waiting for some equally tender remark from Diana?

I imagined at this point that Stephen really wanted to ask Diana to marry him, but was still much too afraid that she would turn him down and that he would not be able to bear it. Diana, for her part, had had a taste of Jack and Canning and Mrs Williams and the Teapot and was starting to think that maybe Stephen was a good choice after all. But she couldn't quite bring herself to say it either. At this point, they each required the other to make the move, and unfortunately, they were both too bruised by their pasts and their personalities to proceed. If either of them could have gone past pride to say what was really on their minds, the impasse might have been broken, they might have lived happily ever after, and there would have been a lot of tension and plot lines missing from the rest of the canon. But neither was able to clear that self imposed hurdle and so they went their separate ways, causing themselves and each other great unhappiness.\n\n2. am I right in thinking the fruitless wait, rather than Lady Jersey's crowd with its implication of Canning (and possibly rakishness), is what drove them to the \"tension, artificial smiles\"?\n\nI think you are.\n\n3. what is the significance for all the conversation that follows of Diana's having refused Stephen's conversational gambit about his friendship with JA?\n\nI am not sure I understand your question, but I thought most of the conversation was of the stilted type people might engage in when they are trying to pretend that they do not care about the conversation; when they are trying to convince themselves that it doesn't matter a bit; when they are not suceeding very well at their self deception. When they are trying to talk about everything except what they really want to talk about.\n\n\"Mother of thyme, crushed by our carriage wheels\", says Stephen. That wasn't all that was crushed.

These are, to grossly oversimplify:\n\n1. Hornblower: all of the lead characters (Hornblower, Bush, Brown, Lady Barbara) remain more or less \"in character\" for the entire series. The interest lies, in part, in how these fixed characters respond to different situations;\n\n2. Sherlock Holmes: Holmes' character remains constant, but Watson, the occasional Mrs. Watson, Mrs. Hudson and even Lestrade vary substantially as the demands of the stories dictate;\n\n3. Poirot: Dame Agatha varies the characters of /everyone/ according to the visions presented to her in the bathtub.\n\nI think that POB was, in PC, trying to decide on which model to adopt. He finally chose, I believe, a variant of Conan Doyle's structure. Jack, most of the Naval personnel and Sophie remain fairly constant over the Saga. If the story demands different \"constant\" characters, POB drops some people out (Rev. Martin) and introduces others (Dil). OTOH, Maturin's and Diana's characters vary quite wildly, depending on POB's ideas while writing.\n\nThus, the characters of Diana and Maturin /are/ complex, confusing and unbelievable, to me, because POB varies them, book to book or even within a book, as the story in his mind demands --- there is no \"standard\" Stephen or Diana.\n\nSo, as I begin each book again, I pretend that the Stephen and Diana in that book are completely different people than the characters of those names in the preceding books. This seems to make both characters more ---- acceptable, or real, to me.\n\nCheers\n\nAl Revzin\n\nI trust that no Lister over-ate excessively this Thanksgiving\n\nFrom: Steven K Ross\n\nDate: Fri, 23 Nov 2001 08:08:49 -0600\n\nSubject: The Dread Clothing Theory Strikes Again!

I hadn't thought of it this way, but it does fit into something I have been thinking about, after having first sprained my brain trying to puzzle out the symbolism of Stephen's different states of dress in HMSS: By contrast with Stephen's ambiguities, Jack is much more black-and-white. As far as his clothing is concerned, he is either fully dressed or stark naked (waking Stephen on deck ready to go swimming) . . . never anywhere in between, though his \"full dress\" can be either formal or informal.\n\nI trust that no Lister over-ate excessively this Thanksgiving.\n\nThanks . . .

It just, kind of, sorta, vanishes ... nearest I can find is p384 at the end of the Chaulieu-Fanciulla exploit where JA stands watching poor Polychrest sink and: \"'Come, brother,\" said Stephen in his ear, very like a dream. 'Come below. You must come below - here is too much blood altogether. Below, below. Here, Bonden, carry him with me.'\" Sorry for this question - I'm not the sharpest scalpel in the sickbay.\n\n2. Comments: p 331: SM is riding through Aragon: \"A shower on the Maladetta, and everywhere the scent of thyme ... 'My mind is too confused for anything but direct action,' he said ... \"\n\nAnother instance of SM haunted by unhappy memories/thoughts conjured up by scent: in this case (at least, I like to think so), the sad journey to Portsmouth with Diana (pp 323ff) \" ... 'Do you think I may ask what this delightful smell is without being abused?' 'Thyme,' said Stephen absently. 'Mother of thyme, crushed by our carriage-wheels.'\" (p325)\n\np. 333: \"[Stephen] saw Heneage Dundas stop on the pavement outside, shade his eyes, and peer in through the window, evidently looking for a friend. His nose came into direct contact with the glass, and its tip flattened into a pale disc. 'Not unlike the foot of a gasteropod,' observed Stephen, and when he had considered its loss of superficial circulation for a while he attracted Dundas's attention, beckoning him in and offering him a cup of tea and a piece of muffin.\"\n\nWhat quintessential POBian genius: a tiny incident adds volumes to the characterisation of SM and sets a gentle smile on my face.\n\nThe JA/SM duel: the tame evanescing of this duel which has so occupied centre stage with reactions to it from so many quarters down to the likes of Lakey and Plaice, leaves a bit of a blank feeling, a sense of being let down, almost of POB copping out of a very tricky situation: JA has lost Diana to Canning and knows the duel isn't worth fighting; but can't withdraw because of the dictates of honour and courage: SM stands revealed as a \"deadly old file\" and he too refuses to withdraw: hmmm. Will both parties delope? too blah. How about friends' intervention with the loading of the pistols? nope, done already by CSF. I can't imagine what a satisfactory outcome would have been, but a mere blank leaves rather the taste of those long-ago serial adventures where one episode ends with the hero chained in a cellar with poison gas seeping in and, probably, water rising as well, and the next begins with \"Freeing himself in a single bound, he battered down the door and escaped.\"\n\nLondon Lois\n\n51° 28' 50\" N 000° 10' 53\" W\n\nFrom: Bob Kegel\n\nDate: Wed, 28 Nov 2001 19:10:08 -0800\n\nSubject: Re: PC: some questions/comments\n\nLois wrote:\n\nThe JA/SM duel: at what point is it actually, formally called off - or isn't it?

In sum, the sense of the group seems to be that Jack and Stephen tacitly agreed to let the issue drop [although some lissuns seem to think that, for form's sake, Jack must have given some sort of apology off-stage]. In the course of a battle scene, Stephen urges Jack to come below, with the significant words, \"here is too much blood altogether.\" So, after having been unable (because of the press of events) to carry out their original plan to duel, S & J find their relationship has developed to a point that it would be unthinkable to duel at all.\n\nAll this speculation, however, helps us understand only why the characters ended up not trying to shoot one another.
