There are 89 locations throughout Western Canada, which include the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, etc. The restaurant's name originates from their original phone number: 4737373. Pizza 73 was founded by David Tougas and Guy Goodwin in 1985. It is headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, with Michael Overs serving as the restaurant's chairman. It was the first delivery chain in Western Canada that provided a centralized call center, allowing customers to order their meal by phone; Pizza 73 also allows orders online by the internet as of 1995. On August 18, 2011, Pizza 73 launched its iPhone application, thus allowing potential customers a new way to order food."
