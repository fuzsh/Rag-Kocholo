        "text": "10 of the best pizza places in Las Vegas\n\n“<3 is shaped like pizza for a reason.” Amen, Rachel Wolchin.\n\nPizza is a beloved food group, especially in Las Vegas. From pizza by the slice to pizza deals, there are dozens of great pizza restaurants in Vegas.\n\nEveryone has their own list of the top pizza places and slices including Eater and Thrillist, and here's ours. (Listed in alphabetical order since it was a team effort and no one is ever going to agree on the same ranking.)\n\nAnthony & Mario’s Broadway Pizzeria\n\nRecommendation: sausage, mushroom and black olives on signature thin crust\n\nThis is a Las Vegas Medical District standby. Located in close proximity to University Medical Center and Valley Hospital you will often see nurses and doctors in scrubs lined up for a slice at Broadway.\n\nThey will do pizza by the slice your way, with a New York City vibe. Choose from all the regular toppings just bring an appetite because they pile on the toppings. Anything more than three and you may need to bring a pair of stretchy pants to change into.\n\nEvel Pie\n\nRecommendation: The World Famous Snake River Special\n\n“Live Hard. Ride Fast. Eat Pizza.” Inspired by Evel Knievel’s attempt to jump the Caesars Palace, Evel Pie is a tribute to the icon. You may have to be a daredevil yourself to try the World Famous Snake River Special made with Evel’s tomato sauce, mozzarella, rattlesnake sausage, caramelized onions and roasted red peppers; the sausage definitely doesn’t taste like chicken.\n\nEvel Pie is a full sensory experience. The old-school pizzeria features the world’s most extensive collection of Evel Knievel memorabilia outside of the museum in Topeka, Kansas.\n\nGood Pie\n\nRecommendation: Johnny Be Good – sauce, fresh mozzarella, sausage, caramelized onions, mushrooms, fresh garlic, parmesan, fresh basil\n\nLocated in Pawn Plaza, Good Pie honors the grandmas of Italian-Americans on the East Coast. Vincent Rotolo is sharing the pizza he grew-up with: Grandma style, 36-inch old-school thin and crispy square. The other styles served are Brooklyn Round pizza and Detroit style pizza, which is also available gluten-free.\n\nThere are different slices available every day, There are The Goods, and then there’s The Really Good Stuff, available as full pies only. It’s honestly all good though. The shop prides itself on only using “GOOD” ingredients including flour and tomatoes imported from Italy. If you need a little kick, add some Mike’s Hot Honey to your slice or use it as a dipping sauce for the crust.\n\nMetro Pizza\n\nRecommendation: MeatBella, only available at Centennial Hills location\n\nThis may be the most well-known local pizza joint. Metro is a Las Vegas institution and has have a great variety of super slices including the traditional thin crust pizza and a Sicilian style thick crust pizza known as the 86th St. for those who want a little more bite to their slice. Stuffed pizzas are also available like the Skyline with sausage, onions, pepperoni, peppers, mushrooms and black olives all inside two layers of dough.\n\nHowever the slice to try here is the MeatBella. This thin crust pie with old world pepperoni and basil may seem basic… until you get to the meatball encased crust inside of a garlic knot. Each pizza slice, comes with its own meatball. An over the top slice for an over the top town.\n\nNaked City\n\nRecommendation: Chicken Finger Pizza\n\nWhat do you do when it’s game day, or any day, and can’t decide between chicken fingers and pizza? Order Naked City’s Chicken Finger, a house pizza available in a quarter or half sheet, with homemade blue cheese dressing, mozzarella and chicken fingers tossed with Frank’s RedHot. It’s basically what would happen if boneless buffalo wings and pizza had a love child.\n\nThis local favorite has five locations in the valley and was started by two brothers from Buffalo, New York. They honor their roots and family upbringing by hand-crafting as many ingredients as possible while still pushing themselves to create and innovate.\n\nPizza Rock\n\nRecommendation: Margherita\n\nPizza Rock has it all - from a variety of pizza styles to a 13-time World Pizza Cup Champion in owner/chef Tony Gemignani. New York, Neapolitan, Roman, classic American, Sicilian, cracker thin, pan and even gluten free pizza pies can be found here. If you can’t find a pie style you like at Pizza Rock, maybe you need to think about how you feel about pizza.\n\nThough they have many selections, only one is available on a first-come, first-serve basis: the award-winning Margherita. Limited to 73 pies a day, this one is inspired by the types you find on the streets of Naples. Fresh dough is topped with San Marzano tomatoes, Mozzerella Fior di Latte, basil, extra virgin olive oil and sea salt. Bellissimo!\n\nPop-Up Pizza\n\nRecommendation: The Vegan\n\nHerbivores rejoice! This one is for you. Whether you’re vegan or not, this is a pizza you won’t be able to get enough of. Made with homemade fresh tomato sauce, vegan mozzarella, spinach, mushroom, artichoke and roasted bell peppers, it’s basically a salad in pizza form. The grilled veggies blended with the melted vegan cheese make for a bite so delicious that even the biggest carnivores won’t be able to resist.\n\nAnd if you’re not willing to give it a try, The Plaza’s pizza joint has more signature pies to choose from including a “create your own” pizza option.\n\nSettebello\n\nRecommendation: Settebello – crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil and a dash of olive oil\n\nSettebello is the real deal for Neapolitan-style pizza, which is elastic, soft and foldable with trademark char marks from the super-hot oven. Settebello does this style justice with a hand-made soft, naturally-risen dough that is quickly baked in a 900 degree wood-burning oven.\n\nThe ingredients here are top-notch; homemade meats, flavorful olive oil and marinated veggies make sharing these 12-inch pies a chore. No matter what you get, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nVerrazano Pizza\n\nRecommendation: cheese pizza\n\nIf you ask anyone who attended Bonanza High School or lives in the northwest part of the city where the best pizza slice is, they’ll send you to Verrazano Pizza. Real New York-style pizza has been in Las Vegas since this spot opened in 1978.\n\nA modest storefront in a strip mall on Rainbow Boulevard, Verrazano brings the basics on a hot, fresh New York thin crust pizza. No frilly ingredients, just good pies and a jovial staff.\n\nThe hard part is waiting to take that first bite. These slices come out of the oven smoking hot, so give it a minute or you will burn the roof of your mouth on the molten cheese.\n\nFan Favorites\n\nWe asked, and you answered. Here are some fan favorites from Twitter:\n\nAmore Taste of Chicago\n\nBoston Pizza\n\nChicago Brewing Company\n\nCostco (and no, you don’t need a membership to eat there)\n\nGrimaldi’s\n\nNorthside Nathan’s\n\nVilla Pizza\n\n*** National Pizza Day Specials\n\nMany Las Vegas pizzerias and Italian restaurants have great pizza deals on National Pizza Day, February 9. Whatever kind of pizza you're craving, there is great pizza near you all over Las Vegas."
