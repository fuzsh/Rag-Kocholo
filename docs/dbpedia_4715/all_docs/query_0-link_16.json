        "text": "TORONTO, Jan. 17, 2024 /CNW/ - Pizza Pizza becomes the first exclusive quick-service pizza sponsor of the new Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL) for its Canadian operations including the teams in Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa.\n\nPizza Pizza is no stranger to professional sports in Canada, particularly hockey, as the pizzeria has long-standing partnerships with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens, Winnipeg Jets, and its sister brand Pizza 73 with the Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames. So, it was a natural move to expand the sponsorship portfolio as professional women's hockey enters the stage in Canada.\n\n\"We're beyond excited to celebrate and support the PWHL during its inaugural season,\" said Amber Winters, Senior Director of Marketing, Pizza Pizza. \"This is a tremendous moment for hockey and sports in Canada. With Pizza Pizza's belief that Everyone Deserves Pizza, we are committed to offering a consistent experience for our loyal fan base during shared hockey-viewing moments of watching an exciting game while enjoying pizza!\"\n\n\"The PWHL's partnership with Pizza Pizza will contribute to the success and growth of the league during its inaugural season,\" said Chelsea Purcell, PWHL Senior Director of Corporate Partnerships. \"This marks another positive step forward in corporate Canada's vital support for women's hockey and the advancement of opportunities for women in sports.\"\n\nThe inaugural PWHL regular-season began on January 1, 2024 and includes 72 games through May 5, 2024, followed by playoffs.\n\nPizza Pizza Limited was founded in 1967 in Toronto, Ontario and has grown to become Canada's leading national Quick Service pizza brand with over 750 restaurants across the country. In 2007, Pizza Pizza acquired the Pizza 73 brand, which operates over 100 locations, primarily in Alberta. Pizza Pizza is guided by its vision of \"Always the best food, made especially for you\", with a focus on quality ingredients, customer service, continuous innovation, and community involvement. In 2022, Pizza Pizza introduced its brand platform 'Everyone Deserves Pizza' a testament to their belief that pizza is all about inclusion.
