The ability to compare makes it easier to identify and analyze trends, which is the primary consideration now that we have two years’ worth of extensive metrics.\n\nSome key findings and takeaways that jumped out the most when filtering through the data delivered in this year’s operator survey came top of mind when we ran the numbers through AI to find out what is most trending. The results:\n\nOnline ordering’s increase is not slowing. Its importance to the industry is paramount.\n\nQuality remains king. Operators continue to say the quality of the ingredients they use remains the driving factor in their ability to retain customers.\n\nStyle variety matters. The trend of offering different styles of pizza is not slowing. Customers are now expecting it.\n\nPlant-based and Vegan demand remains. Operators continue ramping up their efforts to provide these options to consumers.\n\nLabor Woes. The pandemic may be over, but the labor pool has not gotten much deeper from last year, according to pizzeria owners.\n\nAutomation. Operators are seeking ways to streamline operations to battle the lack of labor and to meet consumer expectations.\n\nStaying Social. Marketing via the various social media channels remains a critical opportunity, and sometimes a challenge, for pizzeria owners.\n\nWe uncovered many more trends, so this is just a topline overview of some prominent recurring responses in our survey data. Read on to dive deeper into what we’ve spent the last several months crunching and compiling!\n\nWhat’s Important to the Independent Pizzeria Operator?\n\nThe pizzeria market as a whole is poised to continue its growth over the next few years. North America’s pizza market is set to grow by 6.11% and $51.38 billion, according to Technavio’s Pizza Market by Type and Geography – Forecast and Analysis 2022-2026. How big of an impact does the Independent Pizzeria Market have on those figures? Estimates vary widely from 40% to 60% represent independent pizzerias. Pizza Today classifies independent pizzerias as pizzerias not under a franchise or license agreement with nine or fewer units. The Indie Pizza Market is thriving in the U.S. post-pandemic. But, today’s independent operations are also facing many unprecedented hurdles. Let’s take a deeper look at the independent pizzeria market.\n\nMore independent operators completed our survey than the previous year. Of the 748 responses, 606 were independent operators. Amongst independent operation respondents surveyed, 73 percent of the pizzerias were single unit, while the remaining 27 percent operated two to nine units, which is the same unit breakdown as last year.\n\nCurrent Independent Pizzeria Market Trends\n\nIndependents are finding optimism and challenges when we asked them what they see as the biggest pizza industry trends. While AI found the big picture ideas above, analyzing the independent market responses reflect what’s happening in American smaller pizzerias.\n\nCosts and inflation are impacting the small pizzerias. This will require operators to continue to find cost savings and additional revenue sources in the coming year.\n\nOperators are better equipped to tackle food costs. While costs soar, independents have been laser focused on reigning in food costs and it shows. We are seeing an encouraging increase in the number of respondents maintaining a 22% or less food cost and less operations teetering over that pivotal 30% mark.\n\nEmphasize customer satisfaction. It’s more important than ever to find ways to keep customers happy, especially in a digital interface, whether that be your online ordering system or third-party delivery.\n\nInnovation and technology are in reach of single-unit operators. As customers depend on technology for daily interactions, independents are meeting the demand by installing and upgrading systems. But, they are not stopping there, operators are continuing to upgrade their operating systems and equipment for efficiency and effectiveness and to ease labor issues.\n\nIndependents are leading the charge in menu creativity. They are rolling out new pizza styles and pizza topping combinations that are being noticed by major chains.\n\nIndependents are looking for sustainability and local sourcing. Each year we are seeing indies increasingly doing their part to create more sustainable businesses. A major factor is access to local products and pricing of eco-friendly products being more available to the singe-unit operator.\n\nCasual dining dominates independents. While fast casual and counter service are trending, the bread and butter of the indie market is sit-down casual dining.\n\nIndies need to explore new revenue streams. Offering catering, third-party delivery, merchandise, mobile units and beer and liquor are all up this year.\n\nLook to events for additional revenue. We are seeing some upward momentum in room/facility rentals, fee-based special events and classes and entertainment on premise.\n\nPizza Concepts & Sales — Keeping it Casual\n\nWhat’s in a concept? Apparently, everything. 90.31 percent of our survey respondents were independent pizzerias with 9 or fewer stores. When we asked them to define their concept type, 38.3 percent selected casual dining. Another 30.25 percent opted for fast-casual.\n\nMeanwhile, 16.54% say they offer carryout and delivery only. We found that particularly interesting as that was the same number as in last year’s survey. Yet last year, the casual concepts totaled 72.4% compared to 68.55% this year. So, where’s the difference?\n\nA surge in Quick Serve is where the numbers point us as compared to 2022. As consumers continue to lead busier and busier lives, convenience trumps experience.\n\nCurrent Pizza Industry Revenue Streams Changes\n\nWith that in mind, do we see any changes in revenue streams as compared to the prior 12 months? Let’s dive into it.\n\nIn 2022, pizzeria owners told us a diversification of their revenue streams were essential to their businesses. Catering, food trucks, alcohol delivery and adding grocery items were the top responses. Fast forward to this year’s data and while those streams remain important, we see that catering, beer and liquor to go and market/grocery items have slightly dipped (less than two percent each), while third-party delivery (38.75% are deploying it) is slightly growing. The biggest growth witnessed in the last year, however, comes as a result of more pizzerias returning to a dine-in focus: 15.5% say room/facility rentals for large groups or parties fueled important revenue in the past year.\n\nSpeaking of third-party delivery, where do we as an industry now stand on what has often been a divisive subject?\n\nIn 2022, income from third-party delivery was a driver for 37.2 percent of respondents. This year, that number increased very slightly to 38.75%. However, the numbers show third-party sales are becoming a larger part of the overall revenue puzzle. In 2022, 18.5% of our respondents said third-party sales accounted for more than 11% of their total overall sales. This year? That number is up to 22.45% of respondents. So, while roughly the same number of pizzerias are partnering with third-party delivery companies, there is a nearly 4% boost overall in how much third-party is impacting the bottom line.\n\nCan the same be said of online ordering? In a nutshell, yes.\n\nIn 2022, 26.4% said they did not offer online ordering. That number is now down to 23.4%.\n\nIn 2022, 14.6% said that online ordering accounted for 18-27% of their overall sales. This year, 17.66% gave that answer. Online ordering continues to drive significant revenue in the industry, and it appears to still be steadily and consistently growing.\n\n2024 Pizza Industry Trends Report Sponsors:\n\n.\n\nPizzeria Labor Trends — The Employee Conundrum\n\nLabor is not only a significant expense, but a most-oft listed headache amongst pizzeria owners. In last year’s survey we discovered that overall outlook was improving. Did that optimism come to fruition?\n\nNot really.\n\nStatistically speaking, the number of employees pizzerias have in 2023 vs. 2022 remains virtually unchanged. 38.3% have 10 or fewer employees as compared to 37.9% last year. However, labor costs are on the rise: last year 26% of operations carried a labor cost between 29-35%. Now, 28.33% tell us their labor cost falls into that range, while an additional 10.1% of respondents say their labor cost is above 35%.\n\n13.54% of survey respondents say they have increased employee pay by 12 or more percent. Additionally, 19.67 percent of respondents say they have increased employee wages by 7-11%.\n\n2024 Pizza Industry Trends Report Sponsors:\n\n.\n\nCurrent Pizzeria Menu Trends\n\nTo stay up to date on the latest pizzeria menu trends, we examined what’s hot on pizzeria menus, what’s being added and what’s being removed.

Nearly 80% of survey respondents shared that 55% or more of their total sales came from pizza sales and 41% said 80% or more were pizza sales.\n\nNow, let’s dive into some menu category trends, including pizza styles, pizza toppings, and other menu items.\n\n2024 Pizza Style Trends\n\nOffering multiple pizza styles continues to dominate the pizza market with over 68% of our respondents offering more than one pizza style.

There has been movement in pizza styles offered at pizzerias in the U.S. Comparing our responses from last year, Neapolitan moved up one spot to No. 5 and Chicago Thin fell two places to No. 6. NEOpolitan entered the Top 10 for the first time tying with Chicago Thick.

Some common style themes among the respondents that selected other include blending two pizza styles, non-recognized local/regional styles, gluten-free, cauliflower crust and stuffed crusts.\n\nPizza Styles on the Rise\n\nIt’s challenging to predict which pizza style will be the year’s trending pizza style. So, we asked our operators if they intend to add a pizza style in the coming year, what style will they add.

Here are some common themes among operators who are experimenting with pizza toppings at their shop:\n\nMeat is king! They are working with meat toppings out of the norm from pork belly and smoked brisket to prosciutto and cup and char sausage.\n\nFind the right plant-based toppings. Pizzerias are looking for the best plant-based products that work for their vegan and meat- and dairy-free customers.\n\nMore shops are incorporating hot honey. Hot pepper-infused honey came on the scene years ago. But hot honey is still being added to menus across the country.\n\nPlay with unique and creative toppings. While some may be seasonal, unique pizza toppings are finding their way onto menus, from more exotic mushrooms like shiitake to persimmons, waffles and even octopus. Others include smoked Kalamata olives, sweet drop peppers, curry sauce, lemons and pecans.\n\nLook to International flavors.
