        "text": "One of the features that puts us far above the rest is our flexible business model that adapts our restaurants square footage to fit your needs and the demographic of your area. Through years of development, we have created a three tier store concept that can better serve an area or potential franchisee’s financial or experience level much better than a one-size fits all franchise system.\n\nThe typical NYPD Pizza franchise unit is around 1,800 square feet and offers dine-in, take-out, delivery, and catering services with a fast casual setting. Our smaller units primarily focus on delivery and take-out. The larger units focus on a casual dining experience while still offering take-out and delivery. Since these require a higher level of experience they’re only offered to seasoned restauranteur’s. These larger units can be located in-line or as a free-standing building and may have a full bar.\n\nAnother distinct advantage of the NYPD Pizza franchise system is our ability to compete across multiple sectors of the food industry. Most franchises are locked into serving fast food, takeout/delivery, or fast casual sectors, but not us. We can serve them all. Unlike most fast-casual and full-service restaurants, we can also cater to the fast food customers that are looking for something quick at a reasonable price. Just like in New York, we offer slices and other quick service items that can help you capture customers that other sit-down or delivery restaurants can’t.\n\nSince 1996 we’ve meticulously developed proprietary private label versions of the majority of our core ingredients. We’ve gone through great lengths to ensure the highest quality and consistency for the signature menu items that have made us such a success. From the flour used in our pizza dough, to our signature pizza and pasta sauces, and even our sausage, we have put everything in place, so our franchisees are always able to bring their customers the authentic, “Arresting Taste of New York”!\n\nOur commitment to quality is not just a catchphrase used to sell pizza. For example, our sauces are made with the finest vine-ripened tomatoes that are picked and packed within hours. No canned tomatoes in the NYPD Pizzeria line up of ingredients. We’re serious about delivering the finest quality product, not just to our customers, but also to our franchisees. All our private label ingredients were created for just that reason.\n\nWhether it’s our flexibility, dedication to quality, ability to compete across markets, or the partnerships we’ve formed, the advantages that NYPD Pizza brings to the table are just part of the equation. Our biggest advantage are the franchisees that join the NYPD Pizza system. If you have an entrepreneurial spirit, dedication to quality & authenticity, and understand of the importance of community, than you may have what it takes to join with NYPD Pizza and help spread the tradition of authentic New York style pizza."
