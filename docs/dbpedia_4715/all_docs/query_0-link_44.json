        "text": "TORONTO, July 24 /CNW/ – Pizza Pizza Royalty Income Fund (the “Fund”)\n\n(TSX: PZA.UN) and Pizza Pizza Limited (“Pizza Pizza”) announced today that\n\nPizza Pizza has completed the previously-announced acquisition of Flying Pizza\n\n73 Inc. and its affiliated companies (together, “Pizza 73”). In connection\n\nwith this transaction, the Fund has acquired the trademarks and other\n\nintellectual property associated with Pizza 73 restaurant operations.\n\nThe acquisition of Pizza 73, a leading quick service restaurant (“QSR”)\n\npizza retailer, based in Edmonton, Alberta, allows Pizza Pizza, which is\n\nmarking its 40th year in the industry, to expand into Western Canada and\n\nspecifically the fast-growing Alberta market. Pizza Pizza, Ontario’s “number\n\none pizza”, operates 532 restaurant locations, predominantly in Ontario and\n\nQuebec.\n\nThe Fund and Pizza Pizza acquired Pizza 73 for a combined purchase price\n\nof $70.25 million. The Fund, through Pizza Pizza Royalty Limited Partnership\n\n(the “Partnership”), acquired the trademarks and other intellectual property\n\nof Pizza 73 for $54.04 million (the “Transaction”) and Pizza Pizza acquired\n\nthe operating business of Pizza 73 for $16.21 million. An additional\n\n$3 million earnout will be paid to the Pizza 73 vendors by Pizza Pizza in July\n\n2008, provided certain revenue and profitability targets are met. Pizza Pizza\n\nwill license the trademarks and other intellectual property associated with\n\nPizza 73 from the Partnership for a 9% royalty payment to the Fund on system\n\nsales generated by the Pizza 73 restaurants in the royalty pool. The\n\nTransaction is expected to be immediately 4.0% accretive to the Fund’s cash\n\navailable for distribution per fully diluted unit on a pro forma basis for the\n\n52 weeks ended April 21, 2007.\n\nConcurrent with the closing of the Transaction, the Partnership has\n\nentered into a credit facility co-led by BMO Bank of Montreal and\n\nToronto-Dominion Bank to finance a portion of the purchase price payable in\n\nthe Transaction and to re-finance existing indebtedness. In addition, Michael\n\nOvers, indirectly, and the Pizza 73 vendors have completed the\n\npreviously-announced acquisition of an aggregate of 766,392 Units on a private\n\nplacement basis, for total proceeds to the Fund of approximately $7.0 million.\n\nAs the Transaction between the Fund and Pizza Pizza was considered a\n\nrelated party transaction under Ontario Securities Commission Rule 61-501 and\n\nAutorité des marchés financiers Policy Q-27, a special meeting of the Fund’s\n\nunitholders was held on July 20, 2007, at which certain matters related to the\n\nTransaction were approved by more than 99% of the Fund units (“Units”)\n\nrepresented in person or by proxy, including a majority of minority\n\nunitholders.\n\nIn connection with the Transaction, on July 5, 2007 the Fund issued\n\n2,600,000 subscription receipts, each representing the right to receive one\n\nUnit of the Fund, for gross proceeds of $23.8 million. The proceeds of the\n\noffering have been held in escrow pending today’s closing of the Transaction.\n\nUpon release, the proceeds were applied to satisfy part of the purchase price\n\npayable by the Partnership. The subscription receipts will be automatically\n\nexchanged for Units effective at 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) today (July 24), and\n\nthereafter the former holders of the subscription receipts will be entitled as\n\nunitholders to receive distributions from the Fund. The Units will be issued\n\nto the former holders of subscription receipts through the facilities of CDS\n\nClearing and Depository Services Inc. (“CDS”) and CDS Book-Entry Only System\n\ncustomer confirmations will be entered on July 26, 2007, the second business\n\nday following the Transaction closing date.\n\nABOUT THE FUND\n\nThe Fund is a limited purpose, open-ended trust established under the\n\nlaws of Ontario to indirectly acquire the trademarks and trade names used by\n\nPizza Pizza in its Pizza Pizza and Pizza 73 branded restaurants. The\n\ntrademarks have been licensed to Pizza Pizza for 99 years, for which Pizza\n\nPizza pays the Fund a royalty equal to 6% of the system sales of its Pizza\n\nPizza restaurants in the royalty pool, and 9% of the system sales of its Pizza\n\n73 restaurants in the royalty pool. As of January 1, 2007, there were 531\n\nPizza Pizza restaurants in the royalty pool, and the initial Pizza 73 royalty\n\npool includes 41 restaurants.\n\nSince its initial public offering in 2005, the Fund has increased\n\ndistributions four times while maintaining a 5% same restaurant sales growth\n\nat its Pizza Pizza restaurants. The last distribution increase was in January\n\n2007 when monthly distributions were increased from $0.071 per unit to $0.073\n\nper unit.\n\nA key attribute of the Fund’s structure is the fact that it is a\n\n“top-line” fund. Royalty income of the Fund is based on top-line system sales\n\nof the royalty pool restaurants and is not determined by the profitability of\n\neither Pizza Pizza or the Pizza Pizza and Pizza 73 restaurants in the royalty\n\npool. Given this structure, the success of the Fund depends primarily on the\n\nability of Pizza Pizza to maintain and increase system sales of the royalty\n\npool restaurants.\n\nABOUT PIZZA PIZZA LIMITED\n\nPizza Pizza Limited, a privately-held Canadian corporation, is one of\n\nCanada’s most successful operators in the quick service restaurant industry\n\nand is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year.
