        "text": "This is a walkthrough for Chapter 3 in Good Pizza, Great Pizza.\n\nIn this chapter, the story follows the events of Chapter 2. You will meet Dr. Michael Keh during PizzaCon, an international pizza convention whose venue will replace the headquarters of the Stewards of Sacred Ingredients across the street, with return appearances by Plant Lady and Veggie Man.\n\nNew ingredients in this chapter are Shrimp, Corn and Chicken.\n\nA courier will acquaint you with a new app on the MyPad, ZaZoom, which opens up a new delivery service for the pizzeria. A new app, OrderUp, is also mentioned in the chapter; however, it is only available for a limited time and will be removed after finishing the main story in Chapter 3.\n\nEvents[]\n\nUnlike previous chapters, Chapter 3 does not have any festivals. The main event is PizzaCon, followed by a cook-off and the final competition, PizzaPalooza.\n\nExposing Dr. Michael Keh[]\n\nIt is possible to win both the cook-off and PizzaPalooza competitions against Dr. Michael Keh without using the secret formula he offers you later in the chapter as long as you make the judge's orders in the final competition correctly and before their satisfaction drops below 50%.\n\nWinning the cook-off[]\n\nVeggie Man appears as one of the judges at PizzaCon and will be sole judge of the cook-off. He asks for his usual:\n\nYou’ve seen me before. Now, make my usual and let’s be done with this stupid competition.\n\nMake him a vegetarian pizza,[1] with Sauce, Cheese, Mushroom, Olive, Onion, Bell Pepper, Eggplant, Pineapple, Basil and Corn.\n\nPizzaPalooza[]\n\nTo win PizzaPalooza, you just have to make the correct pizzas for the judges. You can tell PizzaCon judges apart from regular attendees by the emblem on their shirt. There are thirteen judges in total, although they may not appear in the order listed below.\n\nWhat a neat restaurant! You definitely get points for aesthetics. Now, how’s your supreme pizza?\n\nMake a supreme pizza,[2] with Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushroom, Olive, Onion and Bell Pepper.\n\nSee this orange shirt? It means I’m a judge! Now, make me a pizza with veggies. Double baked.\n\nMake a well done pizza with vegetables,[3] with Sauce, Cheese, Onion, Basil and Corn. Be sure to put it in the oven twice.\n\nLet’s see how you multitask in the kitchen. One supreme, and a meat lover’s with ham on one half only.\n\nMake two pizzas,[4] one supreme with Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushroom, Olive, Onion and Bell Pepper; the other with Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni, Sausage and Bacon on both sides with Ham on only one side.\n\nGet me three pepperoni pizzas as fast as you can! I’m late to a PizzaCon judge’s meeting!\n\nMake three pepperoni pizzas,[5] with Sauce, Cheese and Pepperoni.\n\nI’m supposed to be off-duty for judging, but… How about you make me your best Margherita pizza anyway?\n\nMake a Margherita pizza,[6] with Tomato Sauce, Cheese and Basil.\n\nMan, judging pizza all day is hard work. I want to take it easy tonight with a Hawaiian pizza.\n\nMake a Hawaiian pizza,[7] with Sauce, Cheese, Pineapple and Ham.\n\nOther competitors were really lacking in seafood options. So, what about you?\n\nMake a pizza with seafood,[8] with Sauce, Cheese, Anchovy and Shrimp.\n\nLet's test how well you know pizza. Make me a flammkuchen.\n\nMake a flammkuchen pizza,[9] with Cheese, Onion and Bacon. Do not put any Sauce on it.\n\nA half-cheeseless pepperoni, half-sauceless chicken pizza to get my good graces.\n\nMake one pizza,[10] with half Sauce and Pepperoni; the other half with Cheese and Chicken.\n\nMake me two pepperoni and mushroom pizzas, put them through the oven twice.\n\nMake two well done pizzas with pepperoni and mushrooms,[11] with Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni and Mushroom. Be sure to put both pizzas in the oven twice.\n\nHow's your variety? One meat lover's, one vegetarian, and one seafood.\n\nMake three pizzas,[12] one with Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni, Sausage, Bacon and Ham; one with Sauce, Cheese, Mushroom, Olive, Onion, Bell Pepper, Pineapple, Basil and Corn; and one with Sauce, Cheese, Anchovy and Shrimp.\n\nI just had the best pepperoni pizza I've ever had! So, how does yours stack up?\n\nMake a pepperoni pizza,[13] with Sauce, Cheese and Pepperoni.\n\nI've lived in France for years. Let's see how your pissaladière represents its origins.\n\nMake a pissaladière pizza,[14] with Olive, Onion and Anchovy. Do not put any Sauce or Cheese on it.\n\nConclusion[]\n\nThis chapter's events are not fixed and completion time will vary player to player. Once PizzaPalooza is over and the winner is announced, the events of Chapter 3 will end and Chapter 4 will start.\n\nRewards[]\n\nPalooza Flag\n\nPalooza Trophy\n\nList of orders[]\n\nSee also[]"
