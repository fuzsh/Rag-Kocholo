        "text": "Notable for its distinctly thin crust, Grandma’s pizza is cooked in an olive oil-coated rectangular pan and topped with mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce (the sauce is typically layered over the cheese.\n\nThis square-shaped pie has parallel strips of a light cheese accompanied by a homemade marinara sauce that was precooked for four hours on a low flame. Extra virgin olive oil is added, and the ingredients top a fragile crust. Kind of like an upside-down pie. It’s almost always drizzled with a heavy dose of garlic-infused olive oil and finished with some Sicilian oregano and Pecorino Romano cheese.\n\nIt is a relatively thin sheet-pan pizza baked in a pan heavily coated with olive oil. This creates the perfect environment to fry the bottom of the pizza, giving Grandma pizza that unmistakable crunch. Grandma’s pizza contains sliced mozzarella cheese and randomly scattered thick plum tomatoes on top.\n\nThis is a grandma’s pizza with vodka sauce–the “Drunk Grandma”! This pie is delicious and famous and can be had at Made in New York Pizza. It may be challenging to find Grandma pizza outside New York, but it is becoming increasingly popular in NYC restaurants.\n\nVisit Made in New York Pizza for a fun and tasty experience in a place that serves high-quality pies regularly. As soon as you eat pizza that has been topped with fresh, hand-selected ingredients, you’ll understand why cheap, mass-produced pizza is such a disappointment.\n\nThis delicious New York favorite can be found on our menu. Since it was created by Long Island home cooks, Grandma’s pizza is traditionally made without a pizza oven. Today, we would like to treat you to a special grandma pizza we offer"
