        "text": "Seasoned dry ribs and new sesame seed pizza crust highlight the 2016 summer menu for Western Canada pizza chain Pizza 73.\n\n“Ribs represent a popular side in Western Canada and are a great addition to the pizza and wings menu available at Pizza 73,” the company said in a news release. The Canadian pork ribs, bone-in and seasoned with chef spices, will be sold in a mini bucket of 10 ribs for $7.99.\n\n“Each Pizza 73 location prepares its pizza dough daily in-store and customers can now add sesame seeds to the pizza crust for a nice artisan, crunchy, home-baked flavour, for no extra charge,” the release said.\n\nAnother summer special is the Picnic Pak, a two-topping medium pizza, 10 ribs, drinks and a Cineplex 2 for 1 movie admission for a special price of $17.99.\n\nThe chain recently launched jalapeno poppers, gluten-free boneless wings, sriracha and tandoori flavours."
