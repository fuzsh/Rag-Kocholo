        "text": "BY CAROLINE BENVENISTE | We were off last month, so there’s lots to catch up on.\n\nThere was a fair amount of activity on MacDougal Street and on Sixth Avenue. Wine bars continue to open, plant-based cuisine options are expanding, yet another burger spot has arrived, and there will be more cake! And ice cream, too! A number of places that have closed have promised to return to a different location nearby.\n\nTop Openings:\n\nSavta — 259 Bleecker St., between Morton and Cornelia Streets\n\nWhy isn’t everyone talking about the sandwiches on pizza dough at Savta? The Parma affair (grilled chicken, San Daniele prosciutto, burrata, pesto and basil) is pretty much perfection. It is fitting that such amazing “bread” is being served in the storefront that used to be Zito’s (and later Baker & Co.) The pizza dough undergoes a three-day fermentation and is baked in a pizza oven. The menu is vegetable forward, and the cuisine is French/Californian. The owner, Vincent Benoliel, is from France and spent part of his early restaurant career in California. There are a few sidewalk tables and also a lovely, covered patio in the rear. Happily, the prices are moderate for this neighborhood.\n\nThe Locavore Variety Store — 434 Sixth Ave., near W. 10th Street\n\nCaroline Weaver, who also curates The Locavore Guide, a Web site with listings of local merchants, has opened a brick-and-mortar store, selling some of the products made by those in the guide. Weaver used to have a stationery store further Downtown, and she missed the personal interaction with customers, which led her to open this shop. The products span a range of categories, such as condiments, personal care, home goods and more.\n\nRealmuto Alta Pasticceria Italiana — 117 Seventh Ave. South, between W. 10th and Christopher Streets\n\nThis market/bakery/restaurant/gelateria is the latest addition to the Realmuto Hospitality Group, which includes L’Arte del Gelato and Filaga Pizzeria. The owner, Francesco Realmuto, hails from Sicily. According to the Web site, “Each of the atmospheres he creates is an invite to experience the simple yet profound joys of life, through the warmth of Sicilian hospitality and the rich, authentic flavors of Italy.” The large space used to house Gourmet Garage. Although it is similar in concept to Travelers Poets & Friends, the place has a very different vibe — less cozy and more polished. The restaurant does not yet have a liquor license, so for the time being, diners can bring their own alcohol.\n\nAlso Open:\n\nCurrently, my favorite shawarma is Spice Brothers on St. Mark’s Place. However, I am excited to try OMG Shawarma (131 Seventh Ave. South, at W. 10th Street), which opened in the former space of Flip Sigi (and before that Otto’s Tacos). In addition to the two shawarma options (veal and chicken), you can get schnitzel and falafel. Robert Sietsema of Eater is a fan. Two new wine bars have arrived. Parcelle Greenwich Village opened at 72 MacDougal St. (between Bleecker and Houston Streets) where Babs used to be. Owner Grant Reynolds said in an interview for Resy that the food offerings at this location would be more extensive, with a full dinner menu rather than just snacks. Mark Ladner, the owner of long-closed Pasta Flyer, consulted on the menu. Perle Wine & Raw Bar (22 Greenwich Ave., near W. 10th Street) has opened next door to sister restaurant Marian’s and showcases seafood towers and other fancy fish and shellfish offerings. Over at Market 57 (25 11th Ave., near 15th Street), Glizzy’s NYC has opened featuring hot dogs with different styles/toppings. Current offerings include Korean, Jamaican, Chinese and Middle Eastern-influenced preparations. In February 2023 we reported that Moustache Pitza would move from 90 Bedford St. (near Grove Street) to 29 Seventh Ave. South. The reason for this relocation was so that Little Owl could expand. Now TLO Room has opened there as an adjunct to Little Owl, effectively doubling the space. Starting in 2015, By Chloe served vegan food at 185 Bleecker St. (corner of MacDougal Street). By 2017, Chef Chloe Coscarelli split with her partners and, eventually, in 2021, the space was rebranded as Beatnic as a result of the ongoing legal battle. Two years later, Beatnic closed, and now Chloe Coscarelli has opened chloe. in the same space. The outside has been spruced up, and inside was a crowd of people waited on line to order from the plant-based menu, which features the “burgers” from By Chloe. In more plant-based news, Ras Plant Based, an Ethiopian vegan restaurant has opened at 170 Bleecker St. (at Sullivan Street). This is their second location and early reviews are quite positive. A reasonably priced Japanese spot, Jin Noodle Sushi has opened at 49 E. Eighth St. (near Greene Street). Replacing Whalebone at 328 Bleecker St. (at Christopher Street) comes the double-feature Bandit, a running shop, and Rhythm Zero, a coffee shop. The store will be Bandit’s flagship. Another cafe opening in the area is Vibrant Café at 172 Waverly Place (near Christopher Street). Colorful Natalie, a female-owned women’s fashion boutique with lots of pink, has opened at 247 Bleecker St. (at Leroy Street). Butter Smashburgers has quietly opened at 106 MacDougal St. (between Bleecker and W. Third Streets) and a number of TikToks have praised the food, including the shoestring cheese fries and the fried chicken sandwich. The smashburger comes with a mustardy special sauce.\n\nClosing/Closed:\n\nIn June we reported that 6th Avenue Vape and Grocery (488 Sixth Ave., between 12th and 13th Streets) had been closed for “sale of cannabis products without a license.” Recently the store was emptied of merchandise and a “Retail for Lease” banner is now displayed on the awning. The tattoo parlor, Ba Neul (65 W. Eighth Street near Sixth Avenue) has papered-over windows. Zazzy’s Pizza (73 Greenwich Ave. at W. 11th Street) does, as well, and a sign on the door indicates that they’ve closed. We received an update from Village Preservation on David’s Shoe and Watch Repair (460 Hudson St. at Barrow Street), telling us David would have to vacate his premises by the end of July. Concerned customers did help him locate a new space nearby at 508 Hudson St., but it is much smaller, so he will be repairing watches only. The Lebanese pita spot Manousheh (193 Bleecker St. at MacDougal Street) has closed. Their Instagram updated customers with the following message: “We have some news: this location at Bleecker will be closing permanently. Thank all of you for making the last 10 years so special! We plan to reopen in the village in the near future :)” Similarly, Pane Pasta, 58 W. Eighth St. (between Sixth Avenue and MacDougal Street) is also gone but promises to return: “We still working [sic] to find a new location. Stay tuned….” Two Hands Seoul Fresh Corn Dogs (95 MacDougal St. between Bleecker Street and Minetta Lane) has shuttered. Silver Apricot, the Chinese American eatery that opened at 20 Cornelia St. (between W. Fourth and Bleecker Streets) during the pandemic, will be closing soon. They announced: “After four wonderful years on Cornelia Street, Silver Apricot is retiring after a final service on August 11… But don’t worry, we’re not leaving 20 Cornelia quite yet — stay tuned for what’s to come.” Their sister restaurant next door, Figure Eight, remains open. Trattoria Tivoli (176 Seventh Ave. near Perry Street), from the folks at Baby Brasa, which occupies the former Rivoli Pizza space, appears shuttered. Calls to the phone number went unanswered.\n\nComing Soon:\n\nAmy Ruth’s Downtown, a “Southern Comfort Cuisine” storefront is coming to 39 W. 14th St. (between Fifth and Sixth Avenues). According to the place’s Web site, owner Carl S. Redding learned to cook from his grandmother, Amy Ruth, during summers in Alabama. He opened his first restaurant in Harlem in 1998. Upside Pizza, the well-regarded slice shop with four locations in the city, will be opening in Chelsea at 555 Sixth Ave. (between 15th and 16th Streets), where Sush1 used to be. And speaking of sushi, Sushi by Bou West Village has applied for a liquor license at 107 Greenwich Ave. (between 12th and Jane Streets) in the subterranean space that once housed Abingdon Square Veterinary Clinic. The chainlet offers timed chef’s choice omakase. Empire Cake will be opening up at 450 Sixth Ave. (at 11th Street) in the fall, according to salespeople at their original Chelsea location. They sell cakes, cupcakes, cookies and also their own take on classic snacks like Twinkies, snowballs and Swiss rolls. On the same stretch of Sixth Avenue, Chess Max Academy is opening at 466 Sixth Ave. (between 11th and 12th Streets). Signage is up at 12 W. 17th St. for Le Conte Sucré, a “Premium Cake Bakery & Café.” Signage is also up for Oases Café and Oases Bar in the new building at 101B W. 14th St. (entrance on Sixth Avenue). Coincidentally, the design for both spaces was done by the same studio.\n\nOther:\n\nIt’s summer which means it’s ice cream season. A new gelato shop Figo Il Gelato Italiano has opened at 189 Bleecker St. (at MacDougal Street). While the product does not come from Italy, the staff were all Italian and the gelato was delicious. Gelato is also available at the just-opened Realmuto, and milk shakes and sundaes are on the menu at Pizza Funhouse. Milk shakes are also featured at Burgerhead, and a sign in the window of Pop Up Grocer proclaims “Soft Serve is here!” Finally, if you’re willing to wait, Emack & Bolio’s is slated to open at 272 Bleecker St. (near Morton Street) where another popular ice cream shop, Cones, used to be.\n\nPlease e-mail us with your observations.
