        "text": "Fencing and handball and surfing, oh my. Yes, the Olympics are in full swing, which means I'm watching sports I'd never normally watch, including surfing, which apparently includes two people sitting on surfboards for 10 minutes bypassing waves they deem not good enough to ride. It's thrilling. Locally, we're tracking in Paris, including Reno's Luke Hobson, who Monday in an awesome race. Don't tell anybody, but I watched it on my phone while driving back from Nevada football's fall camp practice Monday morning. So, we're plenty busy in the NSN offices balancing Wolf Pack football, Olympics and much more. So, there's plenty to discuss in this week's Monday Mailbag. Thanks, as always, for the questions.\n\nWolf Pack football doesn't have too many quarterbacks. Nevada has four scholarship signal-callers; most schools have five or six. And Nevada has had back-to-back seasons with more interceptions thrown than touchdown passes, which makes it impossible to win games. If anything, Nevada should keep adding talent to the quarterback room to find an answer without fear of potentially losing players who don't see the field. Boost up those numbers until you find an All-Mountain West player at the most important position on the field. Three of Nevada's four scholarship quarterbacks in 2024 are transfers, so it's not like they've been buried on the depth chart at Nevada for a long period of time. Two of those players (Chubba Purdy, Anthony Grigsby Jr.) are in their first season at Nevada while one is in his second season (Brendon Lewis) and a third in his third season (AJ Bianco). Given how the Wolf Pack's last couple of seasons have gone, I imagine multiple quarterbacks will get playing time in 2024 and have the chance to prove they should be the starter with their play. My \"25 most important Nevada football players in 2024\" series starts Tuesday, and I have three quarterbacks on the list. I'd be surprised if Nevada didn't have multiple quarterbacks get 50-plus passing attempts this season.\n\nUltimately, I think Nevada starts multiple quarterbacks in 2024. That's not what you want to do, but the Wolf Pack doesn't have a firm starter entering the season, and first-year head coach Jeff Choate has basically said the team's first five games will be used to look at the team's options at that position. Choate said he talked to the quarterbacks before fall camp began, and \"We talked about the fact we play five preseason games, and if somebody hasn't emerged as a clear No. 1, we've got a long runway to figure this out before we get into Mountain West play.\" Sometimes it takes a while to identify the guy, a good example being Nevada's 2019 season when Carson Strong was the starter for the first couple of games, lost the job for a couple of games and then got it back before undisputedly winning the job in 2020 and 2021. Switching the starting quarterback isn't always about being indecisive. Sometimes nobody plays well enough to win the job, which has happened at Nevada the last two years. The Wolf Pack obviously needs somebody to go and take the job in 2024, whether it is Brendon Lewis, Chubba Purdy, AJ Bianco or Anthony Grigsby Jr. I have Lewis winning the job for the season opener against SMU on Aug. 24, but all four guys are getting first-team reps in practice and there's something aboutGrigsby that makes me think he'll be a more featured player than most expect.\n\nNope. Not to my knowledge. Since moving to the Mountain West, Nevada's lowest placement in the preseason poll before this year's last-place finish was when it was picked to finish 11th out of 12 teams in 2023 (it tied for 10th, which also was last place, at 2-6 in league). Before that, the lowest it had been picked was tied for fourth out of six teams in the MW's West Division, which happened multiple times. These are historically low outside expectations for the Wolf Pack. I personally had Nevada 11th out of 12 teams . Hard to go above that given the recent history. But given some other rebuilding teams in the MW, including New Mexico, San Diego State and San Jose State, a top-eight finish isn't out of the picture. Top half is unrealistic. The problem is Nevada plays the No. 1 (Boise State), No. 2 (UNLV), No. 3 (Fresno State), No. 4 (Air Force), No. 5 (Colorado State), No. 9 (Hawaii) and No. 10 (San Jose State) teams in the MW preseason poll. That's one of the hardest league schedules in the MW this season, including road games at preseason favorites Boise State and UNLV, which also happen to be Nevada's two biggest rivals.\n\nHere are , which shows the Wolf Pack signing one four-star recruit out of high school all-time, that being quarterback Clay Millen. Although running back Toa Taua also when he signed with Nevada, as was offensive lineman John Romero back in 2006. Those are the only three four-star recruits I know of Nevada football signing straight out of high school. WideoutWillie Johnson and linebacker Joey Barnes were four-star junior-college recruits. Safety Chris Metcalf, running Chris Solomon and quarterback Austin Kafentzis were near four-star recruits, per 247Sports. As you can see, most of these players didn't do much at Nevada.\n\nIn terms of a full class, if you look since 2000 when recruiting rankings started, the Wolf Pack's 2002 class was rated No. 68 in the nation and included RB BJ Mitchell, DE JJ Milan, WR Maurice Mann and QB Jeff Rowe, the latter two reaching the NFL. Nevada's only other top-80 class came in 2012 when Nevada ranked 75th with a group that included zero future NFL players, although DBJulian Brooks, RB Chris Solomon, DL Cortez Woods, WR Travis Gardner, WR Nigel Westbrooks, QBTyler Stewart, WR Jerico Richardson and QB turned WRHasaan Henderson were all highly rated. That class underachieved.\n\nNevada's best football class was the 2006 group that include five future NFL players (QB Colin Kaepernick, TE Virgil Green, DE Dontay Moch, LB Jerome Johnson, WR Marko Mitchell) plus RB Vai Taua, DE Kevin Basped and OL John Bender. That group was rated No. 96 in the nation. Nevada's second-best class is the 2018 group that included WR Romeo Doubs, QB Carson Strong, TE Cole Turner, RB Toa Taua, DB Emany Johnson, DE Daniel Grzesiak and OLAaron Frost. That class was rated No. 81 in the nation. Basically, don't pay attention to recruiting rankings when it comes to Nevada. This is a developmental school, as are all Group of 5 programs.\n\nLast year, Nevada's full non-conference schedule was announced on Aug. 25, so I'll set that for the over/under date. The schedule is already pretty full with home contests against Washington (Nov. 9), Santa Clara (Nov. 16), South Dakota State (Dec. 11) and Washington State (Dec. 2); a road game against Loyola Marymount (Dec. 7); and three games in the Charleston Classic. That leaves three unknown games, one of which is a likely non-Division I opponent. The meat of the non-league schedule is done, and it's a pretty good schedule. Certainly better on paper than the last two, depending on how Washington and Washington State perform. TheCharleston Classic includesDrake, Florida Atlantic, Miami, Oklahoma State, Seton Hall, Vanderbilt and VCU, which is arguably the best multi-team event Nevada has been in. The Wolf Pack does appear to have upgraded its non-league schedule after the Mountain West got no credit with its NCAA Tournament seeds last year.\n\nThe SEC and Big Ten are already super conferences with 16 and 18 teams, respectively. The Big 12, which has 16 teams, isn't adding any Mountain West schools. It didn't add Washington State or Oregon State in the latest round of realignment and didn't add any MW schools when inviting three American Athletic Conference schools (Houston, Cincinnati, UCF) plus BYU in 2022. Boise State, San Diego State, Colorado State, UNLV and Air Force all wanted in the Big 12 but didn't sniff an invite. The Big 12 isn't watering down its conference by adding MW/Pac-2 schools. It will wait for the ACC to break apart and poach from that conference.\n\nSo, my all-time Team USA roster since 1992?\n\nPG: Magic Johnson/Stephen Curry\n\nSG: Michael Jordan/Kobe Bryant/Dwyane Wade\n\nSF: LeBron James/Kevin Durant/Kawhi Leonard\n\nPF: Tim Duncan/Kevin Garnett\n\nC: Shaquille O'Neal/Anthony Davis\n\nThat's my 12-man roster with Jason Kidd the first man out. I also considered Reggie Miller and Chris Paul.\n\nNBC paid$7 billion for the 2022-32 Olympics. It is going to televise things in primetime to maximize viewership to protect that investment.\n\nSummer Olympic sports I've tried: archery, swimming, badminton, basketball, volleyball, boxing (against a punching bag), cycling, diving, football, golf, hockey, skateboarding, climbing, swimming, table tennis, trampoline, tennis, weightlifting\n\nSummer Olympic sports I've competed in: tennis\n\nAnd I'll say zero bat games this year. The staff wasn't pleased with that, so I imagine it has been fixed, or as fixed as it can be. It can't truly be fixed since bats can fit into tiny spaces and seem to enjoy Lawlor.\n\nTable tennis. I'm actually good at that for a regular human being, but Olympic-level table tennis is apparently played by robots given how good those people are. It's amazing. I'm curious how I'd stack up against Olympic-level table-tennis talent (I would lose without getting a point).\n\nAny that features Celine Dion singing.\n\nThat plus Dave Roberts' reluctance to let his starters go six innings. The quick hook is torching what should be an excellent bullpen. But that group is being asked to soak up four to five innings a game. Not ideal.\n\nIt's not pizza, and it's terrible. It's a pie of meat and sauce. And I've supposedly had the best there is,Lou Malnati's in Chicago. Not for me.\n\nWe've asked all of the Nevada football players we've talked to this fall whether they're in the game, and many of them missed the deadline, mostly by accident, so they're not in the game. We didn't ask Chubba Purdy specifically whether he opted out or just missed the deadline, although given he has some name value, perhaps the $600 and free video game wasn't worth granting his name, image and likeness. Either way, he basically is in the game. He's just named \"Ron Kramer.\" But Kramer's grades line up with Purdy's skillset, and Kramer is Nevada's highest-rated quarterback at 78 to Brendon Lewis' 76 and AJ Bianco's 73. Pretty sure \"Kramer\" is Purdy.\n\nI believe we ordered seven Nevada Sports Net male hats with six of those being claimed by our male full-time staff members and the seventh going to our intern who is working a three-month stint this summer. So, does is three-month intern or three-year former employee (Julian Del Gaudio) more deserving of an NSN hat? If you want one, Julian, that's the man to target. They are pretty sweet hats.\n\nIn terms of your video-game player, I love him considered he is an homage to NSN's director of operations, , aka Rez, aka Tony TV, aka a former Winona State football standout. But he needs a higher overall rating than 75. I do find it interesting Nevada's highest-rated player on the new EA Sports College Football game is cornerback Michael Coats Jr., who didn't start last year. Second is center Andrew Madrigal and third left tackle Isaiah World. I would have gone linebacker Drue Watts as the highest-rated player then World second and one of Madrigal/DB Kitan Crawford/QB Brendon Lewis/LB NakiMateialona third.\n\nAnimal cruelty concerns? Rodeo is banned in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands with other nations in Europe having restrictions on certain practices. It's not really a global sport, although it's probably popular enough worldwide to include in the Olympics. But if baseball and softball can't get into the Olympics, rodeo is further down the list of snubs.\n\nWell-timed question considering we re-watched Deadpool 1 on Friday, Deadpool 2 on Saturday and went to the theaters for Deadpool 3 on Sunday. The original Deadpool gets an \"A,\" the second one gets a \"B\" and the latest offering a \"C.\" I did like adding Wolverine because Hugh Jackman was made for that role and did a great job. But the latest release wasn't as fun and didn't take advantage of Deadpool mocking Wolverine's seriousness like it could have. While the opening NSYNC scene was great, I could tell something was amiss in the opening credits when they listed the names of the director, producers, actors, etc. In the first two movies, they had mocking titles for those. Also seeing Ryan Reynolds as the lead writer (with five people getting a credit there) was a worrying sign. Writing and acting are two far different skills, and this movie was as well written (and was 20 minutes too long). There were good moments, and it was one of the more entertaining post-Endgame Marvel movies, which isn't saying much. There was some nostalgia built in. But it was a step down from the first two offerings. I imagine Marvel is going to keep running this series out there since it will do well in the box office given its the most marketed movie since Barbie. I also saw Marvel is bringing back Robert Downey Jr. to play Doctor Doom. Talk about desperate. Please stop with this multi-verse mess. The only slightly interestingmulti-verse thing I've seen is Apple TV's Dark Matter, and even that ran out of steam late in the series.\n\nWolverine in fencing. I'll take Wolverine to win gold by killing his opponents with hisadamantium claws, a TKO-K (technical knockout-killed).\n\nSee y'all next week!\n\nSports columnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
