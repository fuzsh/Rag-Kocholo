        "text": "üíµ Interested in any of the franchises on this list? Click here to find out if they (or similar franchises) are still available in your area.\n\nCheck out our most recent list of the Top Pizza Franchises of 2024.\n\nPizza is one of the most important foods in America, with 43% of Americans eating it at least once a week. It‚Äôs hardly surprising, as pizza is a relatively low-cost way to feed a family, while providing variety through its toppings. Delivery and take-out is a huge part of this, with 36% of Americans regularly eating fast food, and pizza from franchise restaurants is central to this market.\n\nFranchised pizza restaurants in the US were worth $40.4 billion in 2022, growth of 2.6% on the previous year. They employ over 770,000 people making and selling pizza to a wide range of customers. This follows steady growth in recent years, even during the difficult months of 2020. The most important player in this market is the Domino‚Äôs franchise, which had 19% of all pizza sales in the US in 2019, and 36% of delivery sales. A strong approach to the delivery market has helped Domino‚Äôs to rebuild a tarnished profile, and its stock price rose 99% in the three years to 2020.\n\nAcross the board, franchises are taking over the pizza business. Large chains have 60% of pizza sales, meaning that big brands dominate the market, and many of them are able to do this through the power of franchising. While independent pizza restaurants represent more outlets ‚Äì 39,808 in 2021, compared with 35,309 chain restaurants ‚Äì the financial figures show that number of restaurants isn‚Äôt everything, and indicate that the bigger chains are making better sales. Big brands generate annual unit volumes of $656,000, compared with $385,000 for independent pizzerias. This makes franchising a very appealing option for anyone wanting to get into pizza.\n\nThe restaurant industry was hit hard by COVID-19, with dine-in restaurants closing across America. Many people replaced this with delivery food, leading to what Domino‚Äôs CEO Ritch Allison described as ‚Äúunprecedented acceleration for food delivery in the U.S.‚Äù As a reliable comfort food, pizza benefited from this in the early days of the pandemic, and was one of the top three cuisines by sales in June, along with chicken and hamburgers. A big rise in pizza consumption in the second quarter of 2020 didn‚Äôt turn into a long-term trend, and the industry saw a small overall decline in sales over the year, but the franchised part of the industry actually saw revenues rise.\n\nThe past few years have shown that the pizza industry is secure against the impacts of both pandemic and recession. Pizza takeout and delivery businesses thrived as people sought comfort food during the pandemic, and while the wider restaurant industry lost $240 billion in sales thanks to the economic fallout, pizza sales remained almost exactly where they had been. Despite the problems of 2020, people succeeded in opening new pizza restaurants that year. The number across the US rose by three hundred, with over seventy of these being additions to big chains.\n\nThe pandemic has accelerated a shift toward more delivery food in place of eating out. Global delivery sales doubled from 2014 to 2019, and that trend is continuing. This is one of the reasons for pizza‚Äôs strength: the industry is well suited to a delivery strategy and is one of the foods people most often think about when ordering from home. Some franchises are even experimenting with ‚Äúghost restaurants‚Äù, which provide delivery as their only option. As the economy tightens over the next few years, people are likely to eat out less, which will affect the profits from people dining in at pizza restaurants. But some of this business is likely to be replaced with takeout and delivery, thanks to Americans‚Äô broader reliance on people cooking for them.\n\nShifts in what consumers eat are affecting the pizza industry. 39% of Americans look for healthy options when ordering fast food. There‚Äôs also a growing demand for vegan and vegetarian alternatives, with 60% of Americans eating more plant-based food and as many as 39% of 18-25-year-olds not eating meat. Driven as much by environmental as by health concerns, the move toward animal-free and flexitarian diets is something that pizza chains can tap into to reach bigger markets. Franchises will do better if they can offer a broad and varied menu, to cover a range of preferences and food allergies, and companies are offering a wider range of high-quality meat substitutes than ever. Adding new options doesn‚Äôt take away from what existing customers like, and lets franchises pick up new customers.\n\nDigital innovation is important. Domino‚Äôs growth has been grounded in improving its digital infrastructure to make online ordering quick, easy, and convenient, while adding features like delivery to public spaces and group alerts for when a delivery arrives. 60% of digital orders come through apps, and these are more convenient for many customers. According to one piece of research, 88% of respondents now use mobile apps to order some of their food and other deliveries. This is an area where being part of a chain franchise helps, as some provide customer ordering apps or a higher profile in third-party apps.\n\nOn the other hand, some customers are looking for a more human experience, and there are attempts to provide this, such as Washington D.C.‚Äôs &pizza chain adding text-based ordering which allows a conversation about the order.\n\nAn important factor to consider is delivery. Some brands rely on third-party delivery, using the likes of DoorDash and Grubhub, while others, such as Domino‚Äôs, have their own delivery infrastructure. The latter option increases a business‚Äôs ongoing financial commitments but reduces costs per delivery. Third parties are convenient but can keep up to 30% of a bill, significantly eating into profits.\n\nThe industry is still adjusting to one of the biggest financial failures in franchising history, the collapse in 2020 of NPC International Inc. The largest Pizza Hut franchisee in North America, the company filed for bankruptcy during the pandemic, which brought to a head its ongoing problems with labor costs, food prices, and competition. The company closed 300 Pizza Hut locations, 163 of which were then put up for sale, and this created more chances for others to take on Pizza Hut franchises, or for other brands to take a bite from Pizza Hut‚Äôs market share while the franchise recovers. The collapse has further highlighted the importance of focusing on delivery, something that NPC wasn‚Äôt fast enough in adjusting to.\n\nThe pizza industry is relatively stable and has coped well through the upheavals of recent years. Franchised restaurants have done particularly well. But with an economic downturn looming, customers‚Äô discretionary spending is likely to fall, and this could hurt the income of all sorts of franchises. Growing costs for labor, rent, and materials will put the squeeze on pizza franchises. While this might be harmful for some pizza outlets, a focus on takeout over eating in should help to weather the storm.\n\nIf you‚Äôre going to sign up with a pizza franchise, it‚Äôs important to pick one that‚Äôs keeping up with the changing market. The pizza market is crowded and tech savvy upstarts are putting pressure on older brands. One of the advantages of a franchise is that the scale of the business lets it invest in the latest tech. A company that doesn‚Äôt make the most of that option is going to struggle in a competitive market and faltering economy.\n\nThe Top Pizza Franchises of 2023\n\n1. Domino‚Äôs\n\nDomino‚Äôs is the new king of pizza, both in terms of global sales ($13.5 billion) and number of locations. The chain was among the first to popularize home delivery and now delivers more than a million pizzas every day. It recently rolled out pizza delivery by custom e-bikes made by electric bicycle company Rad Power Bikes.\n\nThe secret to Domino‚Äôs success has a lot to do with ordering technology. The company‚Äôs new AnyWare digital ordering platform expands the kinds of devices consumers can use to place orders, including smart speakers (Amazon Echo/Alexa), smart TVs, smart watches, and social media platforms along with the usual array of desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.\n\nFounded by brothers Thomas and James Monaghan in Ypsilanti, Michigan in 1960, the latest available annual report of the company (2021) indicated there were 18,848 locations at the end of that year (up from the 2020 total of 17,644), of which 375 were company-owned and 12,288 were located outside the US.\n\n2. Pizza Hut\n\nPizza Hut was started in the 1950s by Dan and Frank Carney in Wichita, Kansas, and is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, Inc., one of the world‚Äôs largest restaurant companies. In an effort to not fall further behind Domino‚Äôs, the company recently announced it will close about 500 dine-in locations in order to focus on the more popular delivery and carryout segment. Playing catch-up to the rivals stealing your market share is not a good place to be, but while the Hut‚Äôs market share has fallen from 25% in 1995 to its current 13.3%, there are still plenty of loyal consumers supporting the chain.\n\nFounded in 1958 and franchising since 1959, the number of locations is back on the rise and currently totals 17,358 (up from the previous total of 16,588), of which 22 are company-owned and 12,041 are located outside the US.\n\n3. Papa John‚Äôs\n\nPapa John‚Äôs got its start back in the mid-1980s when founder John Schnatter sold his beloved 1972 Camaro Z28 for $2,800 in order to keep his father‚Äôs tavern open and converted it into a pizza shop. Papa John‚Äôs is focused more on takeout and delivery than in-store dining. It was also one of the first national chains to make online ordering available chain-wide in 2002.\n\nAlthough it has struggled to find its footing in the highly competitive pizza market, it‚Äôs making headway with its back-to-basics BIBP approach ‚Äì better ingredients, better pizza. Schnatter stepped down as company chairman following controversy around his use of a racial slur.\n\nFounded in 1985 and franchising since 1986, the number of locations has continued to steadily expand in recent years to the current total of 5,759 (up from the previous total of 5,400, which is a big increase), of which 520 are company-owned and 2,590 are located outside the US.\n\n4. Little Caesars\n\nLittle Caesars was founded in 1959 by Mike Ilitch, a shortstop for the Detroit Tigers farm team at the time, and his wife Marian. The first location in Garden City is still open today. The company recently built a new 9-story $150 million headquarters building in Detroit featuring a glass fa√ßade composed of panes of glass in the triangular shape of pizza slices.\n\nIn addition to its well-known catch-phrase of ‚ÄúPizza! Pizza!‚Äù and square pies, Little Caesars broke new ground with the introduction of its ‚ÄúHot-N-Ready‚Äù concept, offering carryout pizzas at surprisingly low prices during certain hours of the day, such as 4-8 p.m.\n\nFounded in 1959 and franchising since 1962, the last reported number of locations was 5,463 in the US and around the world back in 2017, which is the most recent verifiable data available.\n\n5. Papa Murphy‚Äôs\n\nPapa Murphy‚Äôs claim to fame is being the only national-scale pizza chain based solely on ‚Äútake and bake‚Äù pizzas assembled in the store and baked by customers at home. It was the mid-1980s when Terry Collins acquired and consolidated two existing chains, Papa Aldo‚Äôs Pizza and Murphy‚Äôs Pizza.\n\nPapa Murphy‚Äôs emphasizes the freshness of its ingredients, noting its stores do not have freezers, dough is made fresh from scratch daily, 100% whole-milk mozzarella cheese is grated daily, and veggies are hand-sliced. The chain was recently acquired by Canadian company MTY Group, which operates more than 70 different quick-service and casual-dining restaurant brands.\n\nFounded in 1985 and franchising since 1986, the number of locations has declined in recent years to the current total of 1,217 (down from the previous total of 1,287), of which 25 are company-owned and 35 are located outside the US.\n\n6. Marco‚Äôs Pizza\n\nMarco‚Äôs Pizza was recently named ‚ÄúPizza Chain of the Year‚Äù in a Harris Poll EquiTrend survey of more than 77,000 people. The company was founded by Italian immigrant Pasquale ‚ÄúPat‚Äù Giammarco and is the only major American pizza chain to be started by a native Italian. Restaurant industry guru Jack Butorac took over the chain in 2004 when it had just 123 locations and grew it into the national chain it is today.\n\nFounded in 1978 and franchising since 1979, the number of locations has expanded rapidly in recent years to the current total of 1,103 (up from the previous total of 1,038), of which 45 are company-owned and 60 are located outside the US.\n\n7. MOD Pizza\n\nMOD Pizza was named by Nation‚Äôs Restaurant News as America‚Äôs fastest-growing restaurant chain as defined by systemwide sales, which grew by 44.7% last year at this chain featuring fast-casual individual artisan pizzas with 3-minute bake times in 800-degree ovens. The concept includes flat-rate pricing no matter how many toppings customers choose for their MOD (made-on-demand) pizza or customizable salad, a family-friendly DIY vibe, and unique locally-inspired d√©cor at each of its locations.\n\nFounded in 2008 by husband-and-wife team Scott and Ally Svenson in Seattle, Washington, the number of locations has grown rapidly to the current total of 543 (up from the previous total of 490) in the US.\n\n8. Hungry Howie‚Äôs Pizza and Subs\n\nHungry Howie‚Äôs Pizza and Subs claims to be the ‚ÄúHome of the Flavored Crust Pizza‚Äù as it was one of the first pizza chains to create flavored crusts, which it launched back in 1985 with 8 different flavors, which today include butter, butter cheese, Cajun, garlic herb, onion, ranch, sesame, and Asiago cheese. In addition to pizza, the menu at Hungry Howie‚Äôs includes calzone-style subs, chicken wings and tenders, bread, salads, and brownies.\n\nThe chain has been a latecomer to digital marketing and has learned some hard lessons along the way, but is finding success now with a fully-integrated marketing plan, supplemented by having the same point-of-sale system in all locations to quickly implement daily specials.\n\nFounded in 1973 and franchising since 1982, the number of locations has held mostly steady in recent years and currently stands at 527 (down from the previous total of 534), of which 33 are company-owned and all are located in the US.\n\n9. Round Table Pizza\n\nRound Table Pizza was started in the late 1950s by William R. Larson, who opened the first location in Menlo Park, California. In 1961, he adopted the King Arthur and knights of the round table theme suggested by a friend. The company has been through a lot. It became entirely employee-owned in 1992. It went through Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2011 and emerged stronger than before.\n\nThe standard format for a Round Table Pizza location focuses on pizza and salads, but there‚Äôs a new format available called Round Table Pizza Clubhouse ‚Äì Pizza Pub Play with video arcade games for kids, large-screen televisions for sports viewing, a bigger menu, and a selection of craft beers. In 2017, the company was acquired by Global Franchise Group.\n\nFounded in 1959 and franchising since 1962, the number of locations recently dropped from a high of 444 in 2016 to the current total of 412, of which 2 are company-owned and one is located outside the US.\n\n10. Jet‚Äôs Pizza\n\nJet‚Äôs Pizza has been a mainstay in Michigan since the 1970s, although its presence in 20 other states has more people saying the company motto, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get Jet‚Äôs!‚Äù The company was founded by brothers Eugene and John Jetts when they decided to bring Detroit-style pizza (square deep-dish) further north of the city to Sterling Heights. Nearly half of the chain‚Äôs locations are in Michigan.\n\nIn addition to both Detroit-style and New York-style pizza, Jet‚Äôs also has two unique types of sandwiches ‚Äì the Jetzee, which is like a grilled panini but made with a deep-dish dough as the bread, and the Boat, also made from pizza dough like a calzone, but open on one side. And for those looking for low-carb pizza, Jet‚Äôs has been testing an Italian-seasoned cauliflower crust pizza.\n\nFounded in 1978 and franchising since 1990, the number of locations currently stands at 390 (up from the previous total of 380), of which 42 are company-owned and all are located in the US.\n\n11. Blaze Pizza\n\nBlaze Pizza recently nabbed the number one spot in Market Force‚Äôs survey of best QSR brands as chosen by consumers, edging out both Papa Murphy‚Äôs (second place) and Marco‚Äôs Pizza (third place) in the ultra-competitive pizza restaurant segment. Blaze, still considered a pizza newcomer, was started by Rick Wetzel, a co-founder of Wetzel‚Äôs Pretzels.\n\nExecutive chef Bradford Kent was enlisted to perfect an 11-inch thin crust from dough allowed to ferment a full 24 hours before getting shaped into a crust, giving Blaze pies their distinctive lighter-than-air crispness. The chain has also received a big boost from being backed by NBA megastar LeBron James and is now considering going public.\n\nFounded in 2012 and franchising since then, the number of locations has grown rapidly to the current total of 336 (down from the previous total of 340), of which seven are company-owned and 28 are located outside the US.\n\n12. Cicis\n\nCicis is the largest pizza chain based on a buffet concept and recently rolled out its Unlimited campaign ‚Äì all the pizza a customer can eat from the buffet for one surprisingly low price. And there‚Äôs typically no fewer than 15 different kinds of pizzas on the buffet line. This makes Cicis popular with families and post-event school groups.\n\nCreated in the 1980s by Joe Croce and Mike Cole in Plano, Texas, the pizza buffet at Cicis features several types of pizza, including traditional, deep-dish, rectangular flatbread, and stuffed crust. The chain is also known for offering distinctively unique creations such as macaroni and cheese pizza as well as various flavors of wings as pizza toppings.\n\nFounded in 1985 and franchising since 1987, the number of locations has declined steadily from a high of 639 in 2009 to the current total of 294, of which six are company-owned and all are located in the US.\n\n13. Mountain Mike‚Äôs Pizza\n\nMountain Mike‚Äôs Pizza dates back to the late 1970s when it was started in Palo Alto, California and has since expanded into Oregon, Nevada, and Utah with casual, family-friendly locations known for their crispy, curly pepperoni. Customers can build their own classic round pies or choose one of the chain‚Äôs 10 specialty pizzas, along with wings, sandwiches, salads, sides, and desserts. It markets itself as the go-to pizza spot for families, sports teams, groups, and big game nights.\n\nFounded in 1978 and franchising since 1981, the number of locations has marched steadily upwards in recent years to the current total of 257 (up from the previous total of 242), of which none are company-owned and all are located in the US.\n\n14. Donatos\n\nDonatos started out in the early 1960s when founder Jim Grote bought a pizza shop on the south side of Columbus, Ohio for $1,300 when he was a sophomore at Ohio State. The chain features Ohio-style pizza, which is a thin-crust round pie cut into square slices with toppings all the way to the edge. The chain got a big boost in 2013 when chairperson Jane Grote Abell (the founder‚Äôs daughter) appeared on the CBS reality television show Undercover Boss. Each location also serves up calzones, oven-baked subs, wings, salads, sides, and desserts.\n\nMcDonald‚Äôs bought the company back in the 1970s when it wanted to add pizza to its menu, but it didn‚Äôt work out and the Grotes bought the company back. Now Red Robin is considering adding Donatos pizza to its menu.\n\nFounded in 1963 and franchising since 1991, the number of locations has been fairly steady in recent years and currently stands at 170 (up from the previous total of 168), of which 52 are company-owned and all are located in the US.\n\n15. Pieology\n\nPieology was started by Carl Chang and serial pizza entrepreneur James Markham (Knockout Pizza, New York Style Pizza in China, MOD Pizza, and Project Pie) in 2011. Pieology offers more than 40 different choices in toppings, which are sourced locally whenever possible on a menu that also reflects local trends and tastes.\n\nThe chain recently rolled out six premium crust options (Artisan Thin, Artisan Thin Hearty Wheat, PieRise Thick, Hand-Crafted Deep Dish, Cauliflower Crust, and Gluten Free) and several plant-based proteins that look and taste like meat but are made from veggies, including ‚ÄúBeef Meatballs,‚Äù ‚ÄúSpicy Italian Sausage Rounds,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDiced Chicken.‚Äù\n\nFounded in 2011 by Carl Chang, the last known verifiable number of locations was 142 in 2018.\n\n16. Rosati‚Äôs Pizza\n\nRosati‚Äôs Pizza comes from a long history of restaurant activity in the Rosati family dating back to the 1890s. When the family moved to Chicago in the early 1900s to open more restaurants, they started experimenting with pizza.\n\nRosati‚Äôs main pizza offerings include Chicago Deep Dish, Chicago Thin Crust, Double-Dough (twice as thick with a unique hand-rolled edge), and Stuffed pizzas (ingredients between two crusts, baked 40 minutes and topped with sauce). Also on the menu are appetizers, calzones, pasta dishes, sandwiches, salads, fried chicken, ribs, and desserts. Most locations use deck slate ovens rather than conveyor ovens.\n\nFounded in 1964 but franchising only since 2006, the number of locations has climbed in recent years but just dropped to the current total of 124 (down from the previous total of 159), of which one is company-owned and all are located in the US.\n\n17. Ledo Pizza\n\nLedo Pizza has made a name for itself as a regional pizza franchise known for its unique square pizzas. Every pizza is rolled to order from fresh-made dough. Company president James Beall is proud of his family‚Äôs long history with pizza, which dates back to his grandfather opening the first Ledo shop in 1955 in Adelphi, Maryland. Round pizza pans weren‚Äôt common back then, and Ledo‚Äôs has stuck with the rectangular pans it started out with. As it says on the company website, ‚ÄúIt may take a little longer, but it sure is worth it.‚Äù\n\nLedo is also known for its extra-thick pepperoni slices. In addition to pizza, the menu includes appetizers, salads, calzones and strombolis, a variety of subs and sandwiches, Italian entr√©es, and soups.\n\nFounded in 1955 and franchising since 1989, the number of locations has held fairly steady in recent years and currently stands at 111 (up from the previous total of 105), of which none are company-owned and all are located in the US.\n\n18. Pizza Factory\n\nPizza Factory has a motto: ‚ÄúWe toss ‚Äòem, they‚Äôre awesome‚Äù and has been making hand-tossed thick-crust round pizzas since the late 1970s when the first location was opened in Oakhurst, California. Menus for this chain vary by location, but in addition to pizza, most also offer calzones, salads, breads, wings, pastas, and sandwiches.\n\nCEO Mary Jane Riva has talked about her strategy of targeting smaller towns (10,000 residents or less) where better real estate deals can be found, as well as having more of an impact on the local community.\n\nFounded in 1979 and franchising since 1985, the number of locations has declined from a high of 128 in 2008 to the current total 104 (up from the previous total of 98), of which only one is company-owned and all are located in the US.\n\n19. Uno Pizzeria & Grill\n\nUno Pizzeria & Grill dates all the way back to the early 1940s in Chicago when Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo popularized the deep-dish pizza concept, although whether or not they invented the idea is disputed. Franchising began in the late 70s and at its height, the chain boasted more than 200 locations.\n\nIt has undergone menu expansions and contractions as well as several name changes over the years as it has struggled to establish its identity and brand. Throughout its ups and downs, however, Uno remains the chain most closely associated with deep-dish pizza.\n\nFounded in 1943 and franchising since 1978, the number of locations has declined in recent years from 100 in 2018 to the current total of 84 (down from the previously reported total of 85), of which 33 are company-owned and six are located outside the US.\n\n20. Your Pie\n\nYour Pie founder Drew French‚Äôs eyes were opened to new pizza possibilities while honeymooning on the small Italian island of Ischia in 2006. Two years later, at the age of 23, he opened the first Your Pie location in Athens, Georgia, making him one of the pioneers in the fast-casual pizza movement. There was a learning curve for early customers, many of whom found eight sauces, eight cheeses, and around 40 toppings overwhelming.\n\nThe chain offers customizable artisan 10-inch pizzas with fresh dough made from scratch daily and baked in brick ovens. Pizza lovers can also choose one of Your Pie‚Äôs seven signature pies as well as order custom panini sandwiches.\n\nFounded in 2008 and franchising since that same year, the last reported number of locations was 66 in 2019 (up from the previous total of 57), of which one was company-owned and all were located in the US.

Toppers Pizza\n\nToppers Pizza is a midwestern chain that doesn‚Äôt hide its ambition to fight its way to the top of the pizza industry through great pizza, awesome culture, and state-of-the-art ordering. It targets the 18-34 crowd interested in late-night pizza delivery and carry-out, with most stores staying open until 3 a.m. or later. This is also why it focuses on digital ordering. As the company website puts it: ‚Äú‚Ä¶order it at the counter, over the phone, go to the Website, apps, text messaging, Alexa, YOUR TENNIS SHOES! Any way you can dream of ordering it, boom, it‚Äôs there.‚Äù\n\nIn addition to pizza, the chain offers seven styles of Topperstix (breadsticks) and seven different versions of buffalo wings.\n\nFounded by Scott Gittrich after he became frustrated with the national pizza chain he worked for, the company website lists 70 locations (up from the previous total of 68), all of which are located in the US.\n\n22.

It has also enlisted athletes from other area teams, including basketball players from the Wizards.\n\nFounded in 1998 and franchising since 2009, the last reported number of locations was 37 in 2018, of which 13 were company-owned and all were located in the US.\n\n24. Pie Five Pizza Co.\n\nPie Five Pizza Co. was started by Rave Restaurant Group as part of the new wave of quick-made handcrafted personal pizzas, with the ‚Äúfive‚Äù in the company‚Äôs name referring to the length of time it takes to prepare a pizza at the chain.

MidiCi Neapolitan Pizza\n\nMidiCi Neapolitan Pizza differentiates itself in the fast-casual artisan pizza niche by its devotion to the 300-year-old tradition of Neapolitan pizza-making, which requires fresh dough made from scratch with only four ingredients (zero or double zero flour, water, sea salt, and live brewer‚Äôs yeast) that is hand-stretch and baked for 60-90 seconds in a wood-fired oven maintained at a temperature of at least 905¬∞F.

PizzaRev\n\nPizzaRev was launched in Los Angeles by Irv Zuckerman and Nicholas Eckerman. Their aim in 2012 was to ride the ‚Äúpizzarev-olution‚Äù wave of craft-your-own individual-sized artisan pizzas. PizzaRev‚Äôs potential for scale and growth attracted former McDonald‚Äôs CEO Don Thompson and his venture-capital firm, Cleveland Avenue, to purchase a majority stake in the fast-growing chain, although it hasn‚Äôt grown much in the last couple years. PizzaRev offers 11-inch pizzas crafted with original or gluten-free dough, both of which are vegan, baked in under three minutes in 900-degree ovens.\n\nFounded in 2011 and franchising since 2013, the number of locations currently listed on the company website stands at nine (down from previously listing 11), all located in California.\n\nAn Important Note About Our Methodology"
