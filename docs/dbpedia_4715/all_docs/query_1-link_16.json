As part of their expansion strategy throughout British Columbia, Pizza Pizza has finalized a multi-year partnership in the heart of Vancouver, as the official pizza partner of BC Place, the BC Lions and Vancouver Whitecaps FC.\n\nPizza Pizza, established in Ontario in 1967, entered the Lower Mainland in 2018 and has grown to over fifty (50) locations in BC. \"We are so excited to finalize our new partnership with BC Place, the Lions and the Whitecaps FC as it allows Pizza Pizza to deepen our engagement with this amazing community,\" said Amber Winters, Senior Director of Marketing, Pizza Pizza. \"We believe Everyone Deserves Pizza, so we're pumped for the fans in BC to enjoy a hot and fresh slice of Pizza Pizza during a game, concert or event or by participating in our 'Score a Slice' program to earn a free slice from our app while cheering on their favourite team!\"\n\nPizza Pizza has decades of experience feeding sports and entertainment fans, serving millions of slices in stadiums, arenas and festivals across the country.

In addition to selling pizzas to patrons in the building, the pizza brand is activating its infamous 'Score a Slice' program where fans in-stadium could earn a free slice on the Pizza Pizza app if the home team hits a certain trigger.\n\nAbout Pizza Pizza Limited\n\nPizza Pizza Limited was founded in 1967 in Toronto, Ontario and has grown to become Canada's leading national Quick Service pizza brand with over 775 restaurants across the country.
