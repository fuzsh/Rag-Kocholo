        "text": "HAMILTON, ON – Harvest Systems Inc. is proud to announce that they have secured an initial order commitment from Pizza Pizza Limited for its POWER (Pizza Oven Waste Energy Recovery) system following a successful demonstration of the product within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. Harvest’s clean technology system, installed and commissioned at three Pizza Pizza locations, enables the restaurants to efficiently manage their energy usage, cut down on operating costs, and reduce emissions.\n\n“We are thrilled as a company to be moving from innovation to commercialization,” said Jim Cotton, CEO of Harvest Systems. “We spent the last ten years and $1.7M developing the technology, in collaboration with McMaster University, and we are now in a position to reduce costs and greenhouse gas emissions across the restaurant industry.”\n\nPizza Pizza has committed to 340 units over the next three years, with an initial order of 20 units in Q4 of 2024. The orders are subject to successful completion of product certification and formal sign-off by Pizza Pizza, which is expected to begin in July and take approximately four months to complete.\n\n“We are delighted to be continuing to work together successfully with Harvest Systems, especially as we now pivot to full commercialization and scalability of this exciting and promising new technology,” said Paul Goddard, CEO of Pizza Pizza. “We think the product will benefit both restaurants and the environment, not only in Canada, but also beyond our borders.”\n\nAbout Harvest Systems\n\nHarvest Systems’ technology harvests and recycles waste heat in order to reduce operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and scalable way. Currently, the company is focused on the $4.6 billion dollar restaurant industry, where the platform acts as a drop-in replacement for traditional water heaters. Using a novel attachable heat reclaimer, waste heat is captured directly from commercial cooking appliances (such as ovens and fryers) and stored in a hot water tank without affecting safety and performance and resulting in an average 2-year payback. The technology was born out of a $1.7M research collaboration between McMaster University, Pizza Pizza Limited, and Enbridge Gas. Following successful pilots with Pizza Pizza, Harvest Systems is ready to commercialize the pizza oven product and continue to build out its full suite of products.\n\nAbout Pizza Pizza"
