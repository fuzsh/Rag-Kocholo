        "text": "Pizza is just plain delicious. If you love pizza as much as the next person, then rest easy that there’s a Pennsylvania pizza spot where the pizza is mouth-wateringly good, according to food experts. So, both you and I can get ready to get our pizza on with these fantastic local choices for the cheese, sauce, bread and other good stuff.\n\nPennsylvania Pizza Spot Named No. 3 Best\n\nThe much-anticipated 50 Top Pizza list was recently released for the U.S., and it’s one of the most revered pizza rankings that comes out annually. Each year, this tally features the best pizza places in America, as judged by experts. I think it would be pretty fun to be a pizza expert, by the way. I imagine it entails going to different pizza restaurants all over America and eating up.\n\nBefore we get to our state, let’s look at the No. 1 best place to get the most savory pizza in America. They have Una Pizza Napoletana in New York as that spot. “We are in the East Side for this very New York-style pizzeria, reminiscent of the New York that becomes more beautiful and fascinating outside the windows of Up Town,” they state on the 50 Top Pizza website. “Soft lights, the work area at the back in the center of the restaurant like a theater stage. The proposal is very simple, two appetizers to start, marinated olives, lupini beans, and dehydrated vegetables.” That sounds like a delightful experience. No. 2 on the tally is Tony’s Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco, California, where “Tony brings his passion and perfection to North Beach, sharing his award winning pizzas with us all.”\n\nNow, let’s get to the Pennsylvania spot with the most mouth-wateringly good pizza. We’re actually a sky-high No. 3 on the tally, with Pizzeria Beddia located at 1313 N. Lee Street in Philadelphia getting the honor. I’m not surprised to see this restaurant so high on the list, because it’s known for having some of the most incredible pizza in the region. Of the Pennsylvania pizza spot, 50 Top Pizza notes, “Some side dishes, such as excellent Cantabrian anchovies or soppressata, complement the pizza offerings. On the menu, you will find few flavors, with fresh and high-quality ingredients, with a dough that stands out for crispiness and flavor.” So, there you have it. If you’re looking for an incredible Pennsylvania pizza spot close to home, we have you covered. I’m pumped to see this locally-owned pizza spot on the tally and getting some praise.\n\nAnne Erickson started her radio career shortly after graduating from Michigan State University and has worked on-air in Detroit, Flint, Toledo, Lansing and beyond.
