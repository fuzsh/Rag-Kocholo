        "text": "Richard Blais, celebrity chef, James Beard-nominated cookbook author, and television personality, is making his Arizona restaurant debut this fall with several new original restaurants at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa. He will open La Zozzona, Tiki Taka and Mesa Centrale and work with the hotelâ€™s preexisting food and beverage team to update other restaurants at the property.\n\nThe new restaurants will open as part of a larger, $110 million hotel renovation project that began two years ago and will end in the renaming of the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa to become The Grand Hyatt Scottsdale Resort.\n\nBlais currently has multiple restaurants in California and Florida, but he said this is his \"biggest project ever.\"\n\nA self-proclaimed \"glutton for hot weather,\" Blais said he has visited Scottsdale several times on family vacations and business trips and fell in love with the desert environment. So, making his Arizona restaurant debut here \"just makes perfect sense.\"\n\n\"This is probably the first time I feel comfortable saying the word restaurateur instead of just chef,\" Blais said.\n\nHere's what to expect at each of his new restaurants.\n\nLa Zozzona\n\nLa Zozzona is named after an Italian pasta sauce that translates to \"messy.\" Blais said the restaurant will be a combination steak and pasta house inspired by his \"most epic journeys through Rome and Tuscany and Florence and Siena,\" with a bit of an American twist.\n\nBlais said he's been using the term \"Itali-zona,\" or the Italian cuisine of Arizona, in planning La Zozzona.\n\nThe menu is still in the works, but Blais said he knows for sure he will offer a pasta alla zozzona because of the restaurant's name. Other items he plans to offer are Tuscan-style steaks, burrata with caviar or olive oil, and at least five pastas, ranging from long to short noodles, stuffed pastas and other \"exotic shapes.\"\n\nThere will also be an extensive wine and cocktail list.\n\nTiki Taka\n\nTiki Taka will take influences from both Spanish and Japanese cuisines. Blais said the restaurant will encapsulate \"fun, downtown energy,\" which, to him, means dark, loud music and a communal atmosphere.\n\n\"I think I've probably said the word Brooklyn once or twice in the development of it,\" said Blais, who is a native New Yorker.\n\nThe menu is not finalized, but he said it will consist largely of small shareable plates.\n\nMesa Centrale\n\nMesa Centrale will be a Southwestern and Mexican restaurant offering \"every meal period, from a glorious breakfast to a Southwestern-inspired club sandwich.\"\n\nBlais is excited about items like chile rellenos and tamales that will be on the menu. He also said they'll have a wood-burning oven, which will be used to make pizzas.\n\n\"I'm going to put pineapple on pizza at Mesa Centrale. Just throwing that out there,\" Blais said.\n\nHow to visit Richard Blais restaurants in Scottsdale\n\nLa Zozzona, Tiki Taka and Mesa Centrale are all expected to open in early October.\n\nDetails: Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa, 7500 E.
