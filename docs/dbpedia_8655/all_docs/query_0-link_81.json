        "text": "Radiohead are one of England’s most successful bands of all time. Formed in 1985 as ‘On A Friday‘ the band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass), Ed O’Brien (guitar, backing vocals) and Philip Selway (drums, percussion).\n\nAfter signing with EMI, their debut single in 1992 became a worldwide hit. Their third album OK Computer (1997) cemented their place as an internationally known band and is regarded as one of the best all-time albums. By 2011 they had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide and have amassed 17 Top 40 singles and 12 Top 10 albums. The band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\nPhilip James Selway (born 1967)\n\nPhilip was the oldest member of the band to attend Abingdon, arriving in September 1980. It was not until his final year at the School (1985) that he became part of a band called ‘On A Friday‘ named after the day of the week in which they rehearsed in the Ingham Music School. After leaving Abingdon in 1985 he studied at Liverpool Polytechnic’ (now Liverpool John Moores University) and left the band for a while before rejoining. He is married with three children and his other work includes composing scores and some film work.\n\nThomas Edward Yorke (born 1968)\n\nThom arrived at Abingdon in September 1980, at the same time as Colin Greenwood (who was in the same year) and Philip Selway (who was two years above). Although the music facilities were basic compared to what is offered there were facilities available that enabled the pupils to pursue their interests. Both Thom and Colin left in 1987; Thom studied English and Fine Arts at the University of Exeter during a time when the band found it difficult to rehearse. He has two children and is the band’s lead singer. His younger brother Andy Yorke is an Old Abingdonian and is also a successful musician.\n\nColin Charles Greenwood (born 1969)\n\nColin arrived at Abingdon in September 1980 and would be joined at the School by his younger brother three years later. He first met Thom Yorke before becoming friends with Ed O’Brien through a school play Trial by Jury. He studied classical guitar during music lessons and consequently met the other band members. He regards teacher Terence Gilmore-James as a contributor to his career path but did not get on with the former head Michael St John Parker. After leaving in 1987 he studied English at Peterhouse, Cambridge. He is married with three children and other in addition to the band has undertaken some TV work.\n\nEdward John O’Brien (born 1968)\n\nEd arrived at Abingdon in September 1981, he was in the year above Thom and Colin but in the year below Philip. He enjoyed sport and played for School field hockey and cricket teams, was a Prefect and had a major part in the 1985 play Julius Caesar. Although he was seemingly immersing himself into school life it was not until he joined the band that he felt a sense of direction. After leaving in 1986 he went to Manchester to study Economics and Social Studies. He is married and has two children.\n\nJonathan Richard Guy Greenwood (born 1971)"
