        "text": "Jonny Greenwood’s Rig\n\nJonny sub-pages\n\nChordophones Amplifiers Pedals + Other Effects Pedalboards Keyboards + Synths Computers + Software Percussion Miscellaneous\n\nJonathan Richard Guy Greenwood (born 5 November 1971) is a multi-instrumentalist, composer, and arranger, best known for his work with Radiohead. He is also the younger brother of bandmate Colin Greenwood. Best known as one of the most innovative guitarists of all time, Jonny initially played Harmonica and then Keyboards with Radiohead (then called On A Friday. He plays a wide variety of instrument, such as the Viola, Glockenspiel, ondes Martenot, tampura, Banjo, and Recorder, but has had mixed success introducing them to Radiohead’s music.\n\nProjects outside of Radiohead include the composition of classical music, working with the BBC Concert Orchestra (as composer in residence) and later with the Australian Chamber Orchestra (ACO), London Contemporary Orchestra (LCO), and Wordless Music Orchestra, and also of the scores of movies including the documentary on the human condition, Bodysong (2003), the drama loosely based on Upton Sinclair’s “Oil!” , There Will Be Blood (2007), and the film adaptation of Haruki Murakami’s novel Norwegian Wood (2010).\n\nJonny performing at a Radiohead concert, very likely in the midst of hitting two pedals at once."
