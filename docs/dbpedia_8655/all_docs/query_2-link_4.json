In addition to bass, Colin plays keyboards, synthesizers, hand percussion, and samplers. Colin is known as the peacemaker of the group and it is likely that without his diligence and loyalty to the band, there would be no Radiohead as we know it today.\n\nContents\n\nGuitars\n\n-Electric Basses [+]\n\nWestone Spectrum DX bass\n\n1973 “Olympic White” Fender Precision Bass No1\n\nSunburst Fender Precision Bass No2\n\nSunburst Fender Precision Bass No3\n\nSunburst Fender Precision?

He acquired a new bass around the time Radiohead were signed, and hasn’t played the Westone publicly since then.\n\n“When I realized the guitar spots had been taken in our band, my mum got me a black Westone DX Spectrum. I loved that bass. It was very black. I think it ended up for a while being the door prop to the old management office” (Bass Magazine. March 29, 2019).\n\nColin playing his Spectrum bass at an On A Friday gig.\n\n1973 “Olympic White” Fender Precision Bass, 1973 “No1”\n\nColin acquired this bass in May 1996 in a trade for the Music Man Sterling that he had used on Pablo Honey and The Bends (that trade also led to the purchase of the band’s Rhodes piano in August of the same year). It was subsequently used on all of the band’s further albums. The sunburst Precision Bass (“No2”) was favored on OK Computer, but every album since has been recorded mainly with this bass. The instrument's Olympic White finish has deeply yellowed over the years due to its heavy use, but the original white of the bass can be seen in a picture below.\n\nIt was probably also used by Thom for the studio recordings of The National Anthem and Pyramid Song, and by Ed for the band’s webcast cover of Joy Division’s Ceremony. Jonny played the bass for some 2012 performances of Supercollider.\n\nAccording to Radiohead’s guitar tech, Peter “Plank” Clements, it is Greenwood’s favorite, which is obvious from how often he uses it. It is exceedingly rare to find images from between 1997 and 2012 of him playing anything else.\n\nThe prior owner of the bass confirmed that it is from 1972. According to Plank, everything is stock except for the volume pot, jack (both of which probably broke due to heavy use), and one of his tuners. In 2011 or 2012, Colin replaced the stock tuner for the E-string with a bass extender, probably a Hipshot Xtender, to quickly switch to drop D tuning. As of In Rainbows, the bass is usually fitted with Stadium Elites 45,65,85,105 strings for touring, though other combinations are sometimes used in studio (stringsreunited).\n\nColin, playing the bass during the In Rainbows – From The Basement sessions.\n\nA picture from The King of Limbs – From The Basement, in which the bass extender is visible.\n\nThe bass with its previous owner, who graciously sent us pictures of both the Fender Precision Bass and the Music Man Sterling.\n\nSunburst Fender Precision Bass “No2”\n\nColin acquired his sunburst Precision Bass in 1996. He used the bass heavily during the sessions for OK Computer, and also during the the live shows in support of the album. Colin played the bass often until 2006, when he started to use his “Olympic White” Precision Bass for most of his live bass parts. The fretboard is the main difference between Colin’s sunburst P-Bass and his white P-Bass: the sunburst bass has a Rosewood fretboard, rather than maple.\n\nThis bass has a small sticker on the headstock, and for a long time had a “COL’S A CRACKER” sticker on the pickguard.\n\nEven after acquire more basses in the 2010s, Colin still breaks out the sunburst from time to time. He used the bass for his 2018 collaboration with Tamino – in the press photo from the recording of the song, the same sticker can be seen on the instrument’s headstock. Oddly, the “COL’S A CRACKER” sticker is not visible, so it must have been removed at some point between Radiohead’s 2012 tour and the 2018 collaboration.\n\nAlthough Colin didn’t play this bass much after 2006, it was still brought on tour as a backup until at least 2012. On the 2012 tour, Jonny often borrowed the sunburst P-Bass for performances of Supercollider, presumably because of issues with the Guild bass he initially played on the track.\n\nLater in 2018, Jonny used the bass for his Junun performances with Shye Ben Tzur and the Rajasthan Express on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and at the Brooklyn Alamo Drafthouse. Colin may have brought the bass as a backup on that tour, allowing Jonny to borrow it for Junun shows. Or perhaps Colin lent the bass to Jonny after acquiring his vintage sunburst P-bass with the tortoiseshell pickguard\n\nSunburst Fender Precision Bass “No3”\n\nVintage P-Bass with a tortoiseshell pickguard. Used during the recording of A Moon Shaped Pool, and for Radiohead’s 2016, 2017, and 2018 tours. More info here.\n\nAt live shows from 2016-2018, Colin played this bass for every song from A Moon Shape Pool and for most older songs (including Creep, Planet Telex, No Surprises, Kid A, Pyramid Song, and Weird Fishes). However, but Colin still played his white ‘72 P-Bass for some older songs (such as Lucky, Paranoid Android, and Nude).\n\nThe sunburst finish and rosewood fingerboard are shared with Colin’s older sunburst P-Bass, but the new P-Bass is differentiated by its tortoiseshell pickguard and tugbar/finger rest (not a thumb rest). It’s pretty beat up in a way that makes me think that it’s a vintage instrument. The tortoiseshell pickguard tells us that it’s from 1959 at the earliest, and the tugbar indicates that it’s pre-1974. As such, it’s very likely a 60s or early 70s instrument. Since Colin’s old primary instrument was an early 70s P-Bass, it seems slightly more likely that the new one would be from the 60s.\n\nA screenshot of Colin playing his No3 P-Bass during Radiohead’s performance of Street Spirit at the 2017 Open'er Festival (radiohead.tv).\n\nSunburst Fender Precision Bass\n\nColin played a Sunburst Fender Precision Bass in the early-90s.\n\n1960 Fender Precision Bass\n\nIn February 2021, Omega Auctions in the UK auctioning a 1960 Fender Precision Bass that Colin played on the studio recording of Fake Plastic Trees. The heavily modified P-Bass was rented by Colin for the recording of The Bends, along with several other bass guitars. The band also rented a PA system from the same company, the name of which is not listed. The rental gear was used when Radiohead recorded at the “fruit farm in Oxfordshire and also at RAK Studios.”\n\nThe Omega Auctions listing mentions that “after [Radiohead] had finished the recording session at RAK Studios the engineer informed the vendor that none of the other guitars were used however, Colin liked the sound on the 60 Precision Bass and used it when recording Fake Plastic Trees.” Most likely, that engineer was none other than Nigel Godrich. Though Nigel has produced all of the band’s albums since OK Computer, The Bends was produced by John Leckie with Nigel serving as engineer. But the band and Nigel got along so well during those sessions that they asked him to produce their next album.\n\nThe auction listing also describes the various mods made to the guitar over the years:\n\n“The guitar itself has the serial number 52685 dating it to 1960. The original paint has been removed although it still has the original tortoiseshell scratchplate. A jazz pickup has been added and the wiring has been adjusted to accommodate this. The neck and headstock are original with the only addition being a Hipshot tuner.”\n\nGiven that The Bends was recorded more than 25 years ago, it’s impossible to know if all of these mods were present at the time the song was recorded. The Hipshot tuner on the E string includes a mechanical switch to immediately drop the string down to a D. Partly obscured by the Hipshot tuner is a label for “Rod Argent’s Musicstore”, a now-closed shop in Worcester owned by the musician and composer Rod Argent. Another instrument featuring the same label can be seen on this Reverb listing, which mentions that the shop closed in the 1990s. A very worn sign for the music store was still visible in Worcester in 2016.\n\nMost likely, the bass had been sold to a different rental company – perhaps one located closer to London and Oxford – by the time Radiohead recorded The Bends in 1994.\n\nAt that time, Colin’s main bass guitars were still his Music Man Sterling and Music Man Stingray instruments. So it’s very possible that using this bass could’ve partly inspired Colin to pick up a pair of vintage 70s Precision Basses in 1996, after the band’s gear was stolen in Denver on October 3, 1995.\n\nA photo of the bass guitar in 2021, from the Omega Auctions listing.\n\nMusic Man Sterling (traded)\n\nColin’s main instrument during recording and touring for The Bends was a Music Man Sterling in Sunburst/Honeyburst finish. He started using the bass in late-1993 or early-1994; before that, he mainly played his black Music Man Stingray. The Sterling must’ve been brand new at the time: Music Man started producing the Sterling model in July 1993, and it was supposedly called the “Most Innovative Bass of 1993” in Musician Magazine. Colin seems to have stopped using the bass when he started touring with his green Music Man StingRay in late-1995. That green StingRay is probably what saved the Sterling from being stolen with the rest of the band’s gear before a gig in Denver on October 3, 1995. In May 1996, Colin traded the Sterling for the Olympic White Fender Precision Bass that would become his long-time favorite.\n\nColin did use the bass during the recording of The Bends, but it seems he prefered Fender instruments most of the time, some of them rented for the recording session (see the entries for the 1972 Mustang and for the 1960 Precision).\n\nColin can be seen playing the bass in footage of Radiohead playing Anyone Can Play Guitar at Rock Am Ring on May 22, 1994. He also used the song for Creep, and likely for the rest of the set (which was not filmed). The bass is also visible in footage of every song at the Reading festival in August of that year.\n\nColin used the bass heavily during Radiohead’s 2 Meter Session on February 27, 1995. The small rectangular “WINNER!” stick is clearly visible during Street Spirit. During the sessions, Colin also played the bass on Anyone Can Play Guitar, High and Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, Just, My Iron Lung, and possibly Bones.\n\nA photo of Thom at RAK studio 1 (note the acoustic panels) in early-1994, during the recording of Radiohead’s The Bends (Rockin'On #263). The photo was published in June, and Radiohead were on tour in May and June, so the photo was probably taken in March or April of 1994. Colin’s honeyburst Music Man Sterling is visible behind Thom. One can also see a black Fender Mustang, almost certainly the 1972 bass mentioned by producer John Leckie in an interview about recording The Bends.\n\nFour photos of the Sterling in late-2012; photos courtesy of the person who received it in the trade for the Olympic White Precision bass.\n\nBlack Music Man Stingray\n\nColin can be seen playing his black Music Man StingRay in most footage from the Pablo Honey era. For example, he used the bass for the band’s performance of Creep on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on September 14, 1993. The main exceptions are “playback” TV performances, when Colin simply held one of the studio’s bass guitars and had to pretend to play along. Colin stopped using the instrument in late-1993 or early-1994, after acquiring his Music Man Sterling bass, which Music Man had just released. If Colin was still bringing the bass on tour as a backup, then it may have been stolen with the rest of the band’s gear on October 3, 1995.\n\nYou can see the black StingRay’s signature control plate in this screenshot from the official Creep music video, filmed in late-1992.\n\nColin playing his black Music Man Sterling during Creep at the MTV BeachHouse on July 4, 1993.\n\nGreen Music Man StingRay (stolen)\n\nColin started using a green Music Man StingRay as his main touring instrument in June or July 1995. He can be seen playing the instrument for both Nobody Does It Better and Just during Radiohead’s appearance on MTV’s Most Wanted on August 18, 1995. Colin definitely used the guitar for the studio recording of Lucky — the official music video includes footage from the recording session on September 4, 1995, and Colin is visible playing the green StringRay.\n\nThe instrument was most likely stolen along with the rest of the band’s gear in Denver on October 3, 1995. So Lucky might be the only studio recording to feature the instrument.\n\nIt might be in Charging Green finish, though it looks a little darker in some photos.\n\nColin with his green Music Man Sterling in late-1995.\n\nWhite Music Man StingRay\n\nColin played a white Music Man StingRay with a black pickguard during 2003 live performances of the Hail To The Thief track “Myxomatosis”. It was the only time Colin has performed with a Music Man bass after 1996. Visible in 2003 fan footage from the Alpine Valley Music Theatre, the Field Festival, and Madison Square Garden. The humbucker pickup on the bass has a white cover despite the black pickguard, which suggests this may be a vintage (late-70s) StingRay.\n\nColin jumping into the air with his Music Man StingRay during a particularly exciting moment in Myxomatosis. Screenshot from fan footage of the band’s performance at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre on August 23, 2003.\n\n1972 Fender Mustang\n\nAccording John Leckie, Colin used a 1972 Fender Mustang bass a lot on the recording of The Bends (gearspace). The year may be mis-remembered (Leckie did mis-remember Colin’s Sterling as an Aria bass in that interview), but his specificity does suggest some confidence. It’s unknown if Colin owns the bass. He may have rented or borrowed the bass for the sessions, as he did with the 1960 Precision bass that he played on Fake Plastic Trees.\n\nA photo of Thom at RAK studio 1 (note the acoustic panels) in early-1994, during the recording of Radiohead’s The Bends (Rockin'On #263). The photo was published in June, and Radiohead were on tour in May and June, so the photo was probably taken in March or April of 1994. A black Fender Mustang with a white pickguard can be seen behind Thom, almost certainly the 1972 bass mentioned by John Leckie. Colin’s honeyburst Music Man Sterling is also visible.\n\nFender Musicmaster Bass\n\nA white Fender Musicmaster bass is visible in footage from the recording sessions for Big Boots at Abbey Road Studio 2 the late-1990s. The bass hasn’t been seen since, and it’s is unknown if the bass is owned by the band. Colin is seen playing his white Precision bass in another part of that session, so Thom or Jonny may have used the Musicmaster. And it may have been rented for that recording session, or simply borrowed from Abbey Road.\n\nA screenshot from Meeting People is Easy showing that bass in the control room at Abbey Road studio 2 (youtube).\n\nFender Jazz Bass No1\n\nFitted with Seymour Duncan STR-J1 pickups in both neck and bridge. Colin used the instrument for Radiohead’s cover of Björk’s Unravel on the band’s Thumbs Down webcast in 2007. Around that time, Colin used La Bella Deep Talkin’ flat-wound strings on the instrument, in contrast to his Precision bass which had round-wound strings at the time.\n\nColin’s favorite bass guitars during the recording of In Rainbows: Fender Jazz bass (left) and “Olympic White” Fender Precision Bass (right). The the red silk on the Jazz Bass’s strings indicate that they’re La Bella Deep Talkin’ flat-wound strings, while the darker silk ends and reddish tips on the Precision Bass’s strings indicate that they’re Elites Stadium Series round-wound strings.\n\nFender Jazz Bass No2 (1962)\n\nIn May, 2012, a 1962 Jazz Bass in a rare Shoreline Gold finish was listed for auction by Vintage and Rare. According to the listing, the bass was previously owned by Norman Watt-Roy, who used it with the Blockheads and with Wilko Johnson. Watt-Roy can be seen with the exact same bass in this photo. A similar but not identical Jazz Bass is visible in photos on Watt-Roy's Wikipedia page.\n\nThe bass was next seen in Colin’s hands, when he performed at a Dries Van Noten fashion show during Paris Fashion Week in 2013.\n\nIn an interview with Bass Magazine in 2019, the Jazz bass was listed as a “home” instrument, in contrast to his “touring” Precision basses.\n\nThe metal circles under the bridge cover up the screw holes left by the instrument’s original string mutes. On 1960-1962 Jazz basses, four string mutes were mounted into the body underneath the bridge cover. Most players removed both the bridge cover and the string mutes.\n\nA photo of Colin performing with his 1962 Jazz Bass during a show by the designer Dries Van Noten at Paris Fashion Week on Sept 25, 2013 (@properpaulareed).\n\nA couple photo of Colin from his 2019 interview with Bass Magazine. In the second photo, he’s tuning using the Cleartune iOS app.\n\nTobacco Sunburst Fender Coronado bass\n\nSeen in pictures on DAS circa 2007, and used by Colin in studio, but it was actually Thom who is the only Radiohead member to have used it live.\n\nBlack Fender Telecaster bass\n\nMade in 1971.\n\nBlack Fender Jaguar bass\n\nColin played a black Fender Jaguar Bass on Jigsaw Falling Into Place and The Headmaster Ritual (The Smiths cover) on Radiohead’s Thumbs Down webcast in late-2007. This suggests he probably used the bass during the recording sessions for In Rainbows, perhaps even for Jigsaw Falling Into Place. However, he’s never played the bass at a live show, and instead used his sunburst Precision bass for renditions of Jigsaw Falling Into Place on Radiohead’s 2008-2009 tour.\n\nAria bass\n\nAccording to John Leckie, Colin had an Aria bass when Radiohead recorded The Bends, but usually played a 1972 Fender Mustang bass instead (gearspace). However, he may have been mis-remembering Colin’s Music Man Sterling as an Aria, since a photo in Rockin'On magazine from the recording of The Bends shows a Fender Mustang and a Music Man Sterling.\n\nBasses held by Colin, but never actually used for any shows or anything recorded\n\nBlack Fender Bass\n\nHeld by Colin for the band’s Top Of The Pops performance of Creep in 1993. Has a red pickguard.\n\nBlack Fender Bass\n\nThis guitar has only been seen with Colin in a photoshoot, and I suspect that the photographer had the instrument for such photoshoots and told him to hold it.\n\nBlack Precision Bass\n\nEssentially a “throw-away” guitar, this is held by Colin in the US High and Dry music video. It was likely a very cheap bass, never used by Colin for a recording, and ruined by the fake rain in the music video.\n\n?\n\nUsed for a TV performance of My Iron Lung when the band was forced to use a playback, rather than actually playing their instruments.\n\nSunburst Gibson Les Paul Bass\n\nColin is seen with this bass, a rental, in the Stop Whispering music video, but he never actually used it on any recordings.\n\nUpright Basses\n\nAcoustic Upright Bass\n\nColin first used an upright bass during the sessions for Kid A and Amnesiac. It can be heard on the recordings of Pyramid Song and You and Whose Army?. Colin also brought the double bass for live performances of those songs in 2000 and 2001.\n\nAccording to an interview in Bass Magazine from March 29, 2019, it is a South Korean student upright bass.\n\nNed Steinberger CR4M\n\nIn 2002, Colin started touring with a CR4M instead of his acoustic upright bass. It can be heard on live performances of Pyramid Song and You and Whose Army? from 2002 to 2004. For Radiohead’s 2006 tour, Colin switched to playing both songs with his Precision bass instead, probably to simplify the band’s touring setup.\n\nGuitars\n\nUnknown Classical Guitar\n\nIn an interview, Colin mentioned that he and Thom played classical guitar together in high school.\n\nChristopher Dean Classical Guitar\n\nColin mentioned in an interview that he purchased around the time of Radiohead’s record deal in 1991, when Christopher Dean “set up a workshop in the Cotswolds in 1985. It has a spruce soundboard and finger board of ebony. I love it and it is a must for the island.”\n\nAccessories\n\nStrings:\n\nLa Bella Deep talkin’ 760RL\n\nStadium Elites 45,65,85,105\n\nPicks:\n\nDunlop Green Tortex 88mm\n\nAmplifiers\n\nColin’s cabs are usually mic’d with a Sennheiser 609.\n\nGallien-Krueger 800RB I head\n\nColin’s used a Gallien-Krueger 800RB-I as his main bass amp from the early-90s until 2003. He kept the head in a rack with the rest of his rack units. Colin ran the head into an Ampeg SVT-810 8x10 cabinet, almost certainly the same one which he went on to use with his Ampeg SVT heads.\n\nColin used the 800rb for television appearances and live shows in May-August 2006, so he almost certainly used the amp to record Hail To The Thief. The amp is visible in footage as late as August 23 at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre. However, Colin switched to an Ampeg SVT-CL and Ampeg SVT-VR for the second leg of Radiohead’s North American tour in September-October 2003. By 2004, he had settled on the SVT-CL, and has not been seen with an Gallien-Krueger amp ever since.\n\nColin’s setup in 1997, featuring the Gallien-Krueger 800RB-I head on the bottom, with a 400RB-I head just above it. Above that are a Boss TU-12H tuner, dbx 160A compressor, and Alembic F-1X tube preamp.\n\nGallien-Krueger 400RB I head\n\nIn the mid-90s, Colin added a Gallien-Krueger 400RB-I head to his rack setup. The amp served as a backup for his 800rb, and like the 800rb Colin used it until 2003.\n\nAmpeg GV22 Combo\n\nColin’s Ampeg GV22 Combo is from the late-60s. He’s used the amp in studio since OK Computer era or overdriven bass sounds.\n\nAmpeg SVT-CL Classic Series head\n\nColin has almost exclusively used an Ampeg SVT-CL as his main touring amp since 2004. He runs it into an Ampeg SVT-810 8x10 cabinet.\n\nColin first toured with an Ampeg SVT-CL on Radiohead’s 2003 North American tour. He brought one SVT-CL and one SVR-VR for that tour, presumably to compare them in a live setting. Both heads are visible in fan footage from Madison Square Garden and from Toronto’s SkyDome. He clearly prefered the SVT-CL, as he wasn’t seen with an SVT-VR again for many years.\n\nIn July 2006, Colin was using “standard valves” with SVT-CL amp, according to the band’s guitar tech, Plank (stringsreunited).\n\nColin brings heads two on tour, with one functioning as a backup.\n\nCirca-2006 Settings\n\nInput: 0dB.\n\nGain: 3.5.\n\nBass: 6.\n\nMidrange: 5.5.\n\nFrequency: 5.\n\nTreble: 6.\n\nMaster: 5.5.\n\nTKOL FTB Settings\n\nInput: 0dB.\n\nGain: 3.5.\n\nUltra Hi Switch: On.\n\nBass: 6.\n\nMidrange: 8.\n\nFrequency: 4.\n\nTreble: 9.\n\nMaster: 3.5.\n\nColin’s Ampeg Classic Series SVT-CL and SVT-VR heads can be seen in this screenshot from fan footage of Radiohead’s show at MSG on October 10, 2003.\n\nColin performing with Radiohead in 2006: his two Ampeg SVT-CL heads can be seen behind him on the right, and his Ampeg SVT 8x10 Cab can be seen on the left.\n\nA shot from DeadAirSpace, with Colin’s settings visible.\n\nA photo of Colin and his Ampeg SVT Classic head during The King of Limbs — From The Basement. Note the BSS Audio AR-133 Active DI Box on top of the head.\n\nAmpeg SVT-VR Classic Series head\n\nColin first toured with an Ampeg SVT-CL on Radiohead’s 2003 North American tour. He brought one SVT-CL and one SVR-VR for that tour, presumably to compare them in a live setting. He clearly prefered the SVT-CL, as he wasn’t seen with an SVT-VR again for many years.\n\nColin used a Classic Series reissue SVT-VR as his main amplifier for the North American leg of Radiohead’s 2012 tour. Colin plugged into “normal” input 1. He ran the amp into an Ampeg SVT-810 8x10 cabinet.\n\nWhen Radiohead toured Europe and Asia later that year, Colin switched back to a Ampeg SVT-CL head.\n\nNote that this is not the Heritage Series 50th Anniversary SVT, which was released in 2019.\n\nColin performing with Radiohead in Glendale Arizona on March 15, 2012 (beatsperminute).\n\nColin in front of the Ampeg SVT-VR head at a 2012 Radiohead performance in Dallas.\n\nAmpeg B-15R Portaflex\n\nAn Ampeg B-15R Portaflex was first seen in Radiohead’s studio in 2006, during the recording of In Rainbows. The amp appears to belong to Colin’s brother, as it first appeared amongst Jonny’s gear and Jonny has used it for a few live sessions over the years. However, it seems that Colin also uses the amp in studio. On July 24, 2006, Plank wrote about Colin’s setup on his blog, and mentioned “also some rehearsing and recording done with a blue diamond finish Ampeg B-15RW combo” (stringsreunited).\n\nAshdown ABM 300 EVO II\n\nThis could be seen next to Colin’s Ampeg during Scotch Mist. Runs into a USA 410H Cabinet and a USA 115 Cabinet.\n\nIt could also be seen during In Rainbows From The Basement, where he had two of the ABM 300 EVO II heads.\n\nEffects\n\nEffects Setups\n\n1997 Rack Setup\n\nColin’s setup in 1997, which went essentially unchanged until 2004; featuring a Boss TU12h, a dbx 160A Compressor/Limiter, an Alembic F-1X Tube Preamp, a Gallien-Krueger 800rb Head i, and a Gallien-Krueger 400rb Head. His Shin Ei fuzz is likely on the floor. A similar setup was used by Colin for several years after, though with the addition of his Lovetone Big Cheese.\n\n2000?-2003 Rack Setup\n\nColin expanded his touring rack setup for Kid A and Amnesiac. He had two racks which were mostly identical, since one served as a backup for the other. In addition to the Shin Ei fuzz, Colin also started to use a Lovetone Big Cheese.\n\nRack 1\n\nFurman PL8 Power Conditioner\n\nKorg DTR-2 ToneWorks Digital Rack Tuner\n\nAlembic F-1X Tube Preamp\n\ndbx 160A Compressor/Limiter\n\nGallien-Krueger 800rb Head i\n\nRack 2 (Backup)\n\nFurman PL8 Power Conditioner (#2)\n\nAlembic F-1X Tube Preamp (#2)\n\ndbx 160A Compressor/Limiter (#2)\n\nGallien-Krueger 400rb Head\n\nA screenshot of Colin’s rack units at Radiohead’s performance of Knives Out on Top of the Pops on May 25, 2001.\n\nA screenshot of Colin’s pedals resting on top of his rack case during Radiohead’s performance of Everything In Its Right Place at their MTV $2 Bill concert on June 5, 2003.\n\n2004 Rack Setup\n\nIn 2004, Colin started using Ampeg SVT-CLU amplifier heads rather than ones by Gallien-Krueger. As a result, his setup was condensed to a single rack featuring a Furman PL8 Power Conditioner, a Korg DTR-2 ToneWorks Digital Rack Tuner, and two dbx 160A Compressor/Limiters. At this point, Colin still seems to be using only two pedals: the Shin Ei fuzz and the Lovetone Big Cheese. The Ampeg SVT-CLU’s are each in their own flight-case.\n\nPre-In Rainbows pedalboard\n\nSome time circa-2005, Colin eschewed the rack setup altogether and switched to a more compact pedalboard. Colin would use this board extensively during the recording of In Rainbows. The board features a Boss TU2, a Tech 21 SansAmp Bass Driver DI, an Akai Headrush E1, and a Radial Engineering JDI passive direct box in addition to the Shin Ei Companion fuzz and the Lovetone Big Cheese.\n\nIn Rainbows tour pedalboard\n\nColin’s touring pedalboard for shows in support of In Rainbows was similar to the board he used in studio for that album. However, he swapped his Headrush E1 for an E2, and added a custom switcher pedal. The custom pedal is in an unfinihsed enclosure and has just a footswitch and two jacks, so it’s probably a mute switch of some kind.\n\nThe pedalboard features a Boss TU2, a custom switcher pedal, a Lovetone Big Cheese, a Tech 21 SansAmp Bass Driver DI, an Akai Headrush E2, and a Shin Ei Companion fuzz. All pedals are powered by a Voodoo Labs Pedal Power 2+.\n\nIn addition, Colin had three Boss FS-5U pedals. They might be controlling a custom switching unit, like Ed had around that time for his amps and rack effects. Perhaps they allow Colin to select his Ampeg, his Ashdown, or both at once.\n\nA shot of Colin’s pedalboard from In Rainbows – From The Basement, filmed on April 2, 2008.\n\nAnother screenshot of Colin’s pedalboard during In Rainbows — From The Basement. Note the three Roland FS-5U footswitches across from the board, in the upper right corner of the image.\n\nThe King of Limbs – From The Basement pedalboard\n\nColin used a downsized pedalboard for TKOL – FTB, featuring just a BOSS TU2 tuner, an MXR DynaComp compressor, a Tech 21 SansAmp Bass Driver DI, and Lovetone Big Cheese. All pedals are powered by a Voodoo Labs Pedal Power 2+.\n\nA Moon Shaped Pool tour pedalboard\n\nColin used a new two-tier board for Radiohead’s tour in support of A Moon Shaped Pool. It includes a Boss TU2, Tech 21 SansAmp Bass Driver, Shin Ei fuzz, Diamond Compressor, Electro-Harmonix Micro Synth (original big box version).\n\nPedals\n\nAkai Headrush E1\n\nColin had an Akai Headrush E1 on his pedalboard in 2006.\n\nAkai Headrush E2\n\nColin had an Akai Headrush E2 on his pedalboard from 2007 to 2009.\n\nBoss DD-5 Digital Delay (?)\n\nSome say that this was used live with his upright bass for Pyramid Song.\n\nBoss LS2 Line Selector\n\nBoss TU2 Chromatic Tuner\n\nColin has used a Boss TU2 as his main tuner at live performances since at least 2006, replacing his Korg rack tuner.\n\nDiamond Compressor\n\nColin has used a Diamond Compressor at Radiohead shows since 2011.\n\nElectro-Harmonix Micro Synth\n\nColin used an original big box Electro-Harmonix Micro Synth for Radiohead’s 2016, 2017, and 2018 tours.\n\nLovetone Big Cheese\n\nUsed live for The National Anthem and Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box. Possibly also used on live performances of Lotus Flower.\n\nRadial Engineering JDI passive direct box\n\nAt Radiohead shows from 2006 to 2009, Colin used a Radial Engineering JDI to split his direct bass guitar signal, so he could send it both directly to the FOH mixer and also through his pedals.\n\nShin Ei Companion Fuzz FY2\n\nObtained around 1995 for $60 in a pawn shop in LA, and soon after used infamously on Exit Music (for a film). This pedal has been a staple of his setup since then. Also used on Myxomatosis live.\n\nShin-Ei FY2 clone\n\nPlank purchased a clone of the Shin-Ei FY2 fuzz on eBay in around 2006. It’s used as a touring spare for his real one.\n\nTech 21 SansAmp Bass Driver\n\nUsed for his direct signal, since Colin’s guitar is simultaneously fed both to his amps and to the PA.\n\nUnknown Pedal\n\nUsed in 2008.\n\nVoodoo Labs Pedal Power 2+\n\nSince 2006, Colin has powered his pedals with a single Pedal Power 2+.\n\nA slightly different incarnation of Colin’s pedalboard, this one including a Boss DD5.\n\nTo the right, Colin’s pre-In Rainbows pedalboard is visible. Up from is the Roland TR909.\n\nA partial photo of Colin’s pedalboard from In Rainbows From The Basement, showing that by 2008 he had started to use an Akai Headrush E2 in place of his older E1.\n\nRack Units\n\nAlembic F-1X Tube Preamp\n\ndbx 160A Compressor/Limiter\n\nFurman PL8 Power Conditioner\n\nKorg DTR-2 ToneWorks Digital Rack Tuner\n\nKeyboards\n\nIn addition to conventional bass playing, Colin is responsible for a good portion of the synth-bass, synth-strings, and other sampled sounds heard live, along with occasional beats. He was the first member of Radiohead to use a bass synthesizer live, playing the analog Novation Bass Station on Climbing Up The Walls in 1996. But since 2000, his keyboard playing has primarily been on MIDI controllers, which he uses to trigger samples of the varied sounds created or used by Radiohead in studio. Perhaps the most notable is the keyboard part of Idioteque, which samples the Paul Lansky’s piece Mild und Leise.\n\nNovation Bass Station\n\nColin played an original Bass Station on the recording of Climbing Up The Walls. He also played the Bass Station on performances of that song from its live debut in 1996 until 2002 or 2003, when he switched to using a MIDI controller instead. Colin uses the MIDI controller to trigger samples of the Bass Station.\n\nYamaha CBXK1XG\n\nColin used a CBXK1XG to trigger samples of Paul Lansky’s piece Mild und Leise on performances of Idioteque in 2000 and 2001.\n\nClavia Nord Lead 3\n\nThe Nord Lead 3 was used by Radiohead’s during the recording of In Rainbows. It’s used most frequently by Thom, but Colin played the keyboard on the Scotch Mist performance of Videotape. Based on that performance, it may have been used for the synth-bass on the album recording as well.\n\nA screenshot of Colin playing the Nord during the Scotch Mist webcast.\n\nRoland PC-200 MKII\n\nA Roland PC-200 MKII was Colin’s main MIDI keyboard for live performances from 2003 to 2006, and it was also used by Jonny during that period. It was likely favored because it was light-weight and could be powered by batteries, which made it easy to move around during shows (this was definitely the case when Jonny played it, as photos show that no power cable was used). The keyboard triggered samples stored in the Native Instruments Kontakt sampler, which ran on a laptop kept at the side of the stage and operated by Russ Russel, the band’s keyboard technician.\n\nColin played it on performances of Climbing Up The Walls (triggering samples of the Novation Bass Station), Idiotque (triggering sampled of Paul Lansky’s piece Mild und Leise), Sit Down Stand Up, and Backdrifts.\n\nColin holding down a key on the PC-200 MKII during Radiohead’s performance of Sit Down. Stand Up. at the Beacon Theatre on June 5, 2003.\n\nRoland PCR-500\n\nIn 2008, Colin switched from his Roland PC-200 MKII to a Roland PCR-500 for live performances. It can be seen clearly during In Rainbows – From The Basement. Like the PC-200, it’s used to trigger samples stored in the Native Instruments Kontakt sampler. Kontakt is run on a laptop kept at the side of the stage and is operated by Russ Russel, the band’s keyboard technician. During The King of Limbs — From The Basement, Jonny borrowed the keyboard to control his Max/MSP spectral filter on Codex.\n\nColin played the keyboard on performances of Climbing Up The Walls (triggering samples of the Novation Bass Station), Idioteque (triggering sampled of Paul Lansky’s piece Mild und Leise), The Gloaming, Videotape (triggering bass-synth samples), and Go Slowly (triggering string-synth samples).\n\nA picture in which the PCR-500 is clearly visible, from Radiohead’s performance of Morning Mr Magpie at Austin City Limits (note that the keyboard is not used on Magpie, this was just a clear image of it).\n\nUnknown Keyboard\n\nPossibly a Roland?\n\nPercussion and Samplers\n\nAkai MPC60 workstation\n\nRadiohead acquired an MPC60 circa-1999, and it was first used during the sessions for Kid A and Amnesiac. According to Colin, it’s used “for those like hiphop, swing moments” (Culturelab).\n\nAfter the recording of The King of Limbs, Colin put some leftover loops of Thom’s voice onto the MPC60, creating the initial draft for Identikit.\n\n“[Identikit] was a kind of a leftover from our previous album The King of Limbs. We’d been working on using loops, and Thom has such a beautiful voice and he had recorded these three singing loops, and it became a sketch more than a song at the time. I took that to my studio at home and played around with it using my Akai MPC [sampler], and I got obsessed with it. The melodies were so beautiful. I’d send my ideas to Thom, and then he’d play piano parts on it and send it back to me, and those became the bridge part after the last verse. We worked on it for a long time, and then it became one of our new songs” (Bass Magazine).\n\nThe MPC60 was part of Jonny’s main setup at Radiohead’s own studio during the sessions for In Rainbows. However, it’s not visible in photos from Tottenham House or Halswell House, so it’s uncertain if used it much during those sessions. It’s also unknown if Jonny simply borrowed Colin’s MPC during this period, or if he acquired an MPC60 of his own.\n\nAkai S3200XL sampler\n\nRadiohead first used an Akai S3200XL during the recording of OK Computer. Colin used it during the sessions for Kid A and Amnesiac. In a 2001 interview, Colin said that they use it “just because everything sounds great” (Culturelab). Since it’s a sampler, he doesn’t mean that its internal sounds are good, but rather that anything will sound good if it’s sampled with the unit.\n\nRoland TR-909 Rhythm Composer\n\nRadiohead first used a TR-909 on their 2006 tour, when Colin added one to his setup. On that tour, he kept it on a dual-tier stand with the VS-1880. On Radiohead’s 2008 and 2009 tours, it was kept on its own music stand next to Colin’s PCR-500. Colin used the 909 for kick drums on live performances of 15 Step, and almost certainly for the album recording too. Colin didn’t bring the 909 when Radiohead next toured in 2011, and Clive Deamer triggered sample kick drums instead.\n\nThe 909 was used on the album recording of Videotape, almost certainly played by Jonny. Jonny also used it for the Scotch Mist performance of Videotape in 2007, but for live shows Jonny instead triggers samples of the 909 using a drum machine made in Cycling74’s Max software.\n\nNigel used the 909 to perform Cymbal Rush with Thom and Jonny on the Henry Rollins show and on KCRW in 2006. Both of those performances took place during Radiohead’s 2006 tour, so it’s likely that they borrowed the 909 from Colin.\n\nThe 909 likely belongs to Colin, because it can be seen behind him in a photo from when he recorded an episode of Sunday Service for BBC 6 Music at his home with Adam Buxton and Jonny in June, 2013. However, Radiohead own at least two of the drum machine, because Plank mentions getting a second one on his blog on July 25, 2006: “Thanks for offers of TR909, we now have another !… :-)” (stringsreunited).\n\nRoland VS-1880 Digital Studio Workstation\n\nRadiohead brought two VS-1880 workstations on their 2003 tour in support of Hail To The Thief. One was kept on a stand near Ed’s amps, and used by Colin on performances of The Gloaming. The other was used by Phil on performances Backdrifts. Based on these performances, it’s likely that Radiohead used a VS-1880 during the recording of Hail To The Thief. On Radiohead’s 2006 tour, Colin added a TR-909 to his setup and kept it on a dual-tier stand with the VS-1880. It was most likely only used on Hail To The Theif, because it’s not visible in photos from the recording of In Rainbows (unlike the TR-909), and wasn’t used on Radiohead’s 2008 tour (or any tour since).\n\nA photo, most likely from the 2006 tour, showing the Roland TR909 and VS-1880 on a dual-tier stand.\n\nRoland MC-505\n\nRadiohead first acquired and used an MC-505 during the sessions for Kid A and Amnesiac. The MC505 was released in mid-1998, so it was brand new at the time (soundonsound).\n\nAccording to Ed’s diary, the song Kid A \"started off as a thom doodle on the 505…“\n\nIn a 2001 interview with Culturelab, Colin explained that ”Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors was made using an MC505 and some loops, together with some other found loops that we made in St Catherine’s Court when we were recording OK Computer\" (archived here). In an interview with Elektron, Thom said that he Pulk/Pull was one of his first experiments with Pro Tools, so the “loops” that Colin mentions were probably sequenced in Pro Tools.\n\nClaves\n\nColin has played claves for first section of Paranoid Android on all live performances since 1997. It seems likely that he played them on the album recording as well – they can be heard during the first section of the song, panned hard-left.\n\nJingle Bells\n\nIt’s unknown if Colin played the jingle bells on the album recording of Airbag, but he’s played them on every live performance since 1997.\n\nColin with his “Olympic White\" Fender Precision Bass and the Jingle Bells.\n\nTambourine\n\nColin played tambourine on performances of 4 Minute Warning on Radiohead’s 2006 tour. The tambourine also appears on the album recording, so it seems likely that Colin played it there too.\n\nDIY Shaker\n\nColin used a DIY shaker on the In Rainbows – From The Basement performance of Reckoner. It’s simple a water bottle filled halfway with sand.\n\nMoving Pictures\n\nColin sometimes plays upright bass.\n\nColin playing the Vintage White Fender Precision Bass during the “Live From the Basement” webcast."
