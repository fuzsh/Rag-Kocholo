        "text": "English bassist (born 1969)\n\nFor the South African rugby footballer, see Colin Greenwood (rugby).\n\nMusical artist\n\nColin Charles Greenwood (born 26 June 1969) is an English bassist and a member of the rock band Radiohead. Along with bass guitar, Greenwood plays upright bass and electronic instruments.\n\nWith his younger brother, the guitarist Jonny Greenwood, Colin attended Abingdon School in Abingdon, England, where they formed Radiohead. Radiohead have achieved acclaim and have sold more than 30 million albums. Greenwood was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Radiohead in 2019.\n\nGreenwood has contributed to solo projects by the other members of Radiohead, and has collaborated with musicians including Tamino, Gaz Coombes, Nick Cave and Warren Ellis.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nColin Greenwood is the older brother of the Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood.[1] Their father served in the British Army as a bomb disposal expert.[2][3] The Greenwood family has historical ties to the British Communist Party and the socialist Fabian Society.[4]\n\nGreenwood lived in Germany as a child and became fluent in German.[5] He credited his older sister, Susan, with introducing him and Jonny to \"miserable\" bands such as the Fall, Magazine and Joy Division. He said: \"We were ostracised at school because everyone else was into Iron Maiden.\"[6]\n\nThe Greenwood brothers attended Abingdon School, a private school for boys in Oxfordshire. When he was 12, Colin met the future Radiohead singer Thom Yorke.[7] Their future bandmates Ed O'Brien, whom Greenwood met during a school production of the opera Trial by Jury, and Philip Selway were also pupils.[8]\n\nGreenwood bought his first guitar when he was 15.[9] He studied classical guitar under the Abingdon music teacher Terence Gilmore-James, who introduced him and his bandmates to jazz, film scores, postwar avant-garde music, and 20th-century classical music. Greenwood said: \"When we started, it was very important that we got support from him, because we weren't getting any from the headmaster. You know, the man once sent us a bill, charging us for the use of school property, because we practiced in one of the music rooms on a Sunday.\"[2]\n\nGreenwood said he began playing bass out of necessity, teaching himself by playing along to New Order, Joy Division and Otis Redding.[5] He said the band members picked their instruments \"because we wanted to play music together, rather than just because we wanted to play that particular instrument. So it was more of a collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool.\"[7]\n\nGreenwood read English at Peterhouse, Cambridge, between 1987 and 1990, and read modern American literature including Raymond Carver, John Cheever and other postwar American writers.[10] While at Peterhouse, he worked as an events and entertainments officer.[11] After graduating, he took a job as a sales assistant at the record shop Our Price in Oxford.[12]\n\nRadiohead\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Radiohead\n\nIn late 1991, the EMI sales representative Keith Wozencroft visited Our Price and struck up conversation with Greenwood. When Wozencroft mentioned that he was moving to a position as an A&R scout at the EMI subsidiary Parlophone, Greenwood gave him a copy of On a Friday's latest demo.[13]\n\nOn a Friday signed a six-album recording contract with EMI and changed their name to Radiohead.[14] By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.[15] They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2019.[16] On being in a band with his brother, Jonny, Colin said: \"Beyond the normal brotherly thing, I respect him as a person and a musician.\"[9]\n\nGreenwood mostly plays fingerstyle, and said he was unskilled with plectrums.[17] He mainly uses Fender basses and Ampeg and Ashdown amplifiers.[17] He also plays double bass on tracks such as \"Pyramid Song\" and \"You and Whose Army\".[17] While his main role is bass, Greenwood said each Radiohead member contributed to song development.[18] He said he did not think of himself as a bass player and was \"just in a band with other people\".[7] Among his influences are Booker T and the MGs, Bill Withers, Curtis Mayfield, Peter Hook and J Dilla.[5][17]\n\nIn 2008, Mojo wrote that Greenwood and Selway were \"surely the most inventive rhythm section working close to the rock mainstream\".[19] In 2014, NME readers voted Greenwood one of the 40 best bassists of all time.[20] In 2024, Far Out named him the third-most underrated bassist, describing him as a \"master of rhythm of space\" and citing his bassline for \"How to Disappear Completely\" as his best: \"His style to a tee, the laid-back but focused walking groove underpins its profoundly dreamlike nature.\"[21]\n\nOther work\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1997, Greenwood participated in a marketing campaign for his alma mater, Cambridge University, posing for a photo with students from both state and private schools for a poster titled \"Put Yourself in the Picture\". The poster was \"designed to break down some of the stereotypes that deter able students from applying to Cambridge\" and encourage more applicants from state schools.[22]\n\nGreenwood contributed bass to two soundtracks by his brother, Jonny, Bodysong (2003) and Inherent Vice,[23] and on his score for the 2008 film Woodpecker.[24] He played bass on the albums Amir (2018) and Sahar (2022) by the Belgian-Egyptian singer Tamino,[25][26] the album World's Strongest Man (2018) by Gaz Coombes,[27] and on \"Brasil\" from Earth (2020), the debut solo album by his Radiohead bandmate Ed O'Brien.[28] He contributed beat programming to Yorke's song \"Hearing Damage\" from the soundtrack to The Twilight Saga: New Moon, and on \"Guess Again!\" from Yorke's album Tomorrow's Modern Boxes (2014).[29]\n\nIn 2004, Greenwood participated on a panel in the annual sixth-form conference run by Radley College in collaboration with School of St Helen and St Katharine, speaking about digital rights management.[30] In 2013, he soundtracked a Dries van Noten runway show, performing solo bass guitar.[31] In 2018, he reviewed Michael Palin's book Erebus: The Story of a Ship for the Spectator.[32]\n\nIn late 2022, Greenwood toured Australia as part of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis's band. He appears on the live album Australian Carnage.[33][34] Greenwood joined Cave's North American tour in September 2023,[35] and contributed bass to Cave's 2024 album Wild God.[36] In October 2024, Greenwood is due to publish a book, How to Disappear: A Portrait of Radiohead, comprising his photographs of Radiohead taken between 2003 and 2016.[37]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 1998, Greenwood married Molly McGrann, an American literary critic and novelist.[38][39] They have three sons, Jesse,[40] born in December 2003; Asa, born in December 2005; and Henry, born in December 2009. They live in Oxford.[41]\n\nGreenwood enjoys writers such as Thomas Pynchon, V.S. Naipaul and Delmore Schwartz.[42] He is an amateur photographer.[42] In 2003, he discussed his favourite photographs in the Victoria and Albert Museum, choosing images by photographers including Frederick Sommer and Harold Edgerton.[43]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Old Abingdonians\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
