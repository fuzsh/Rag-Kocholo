They are so lost in their own moment of performance that they don’t see me with the camera.’ Colin Greenwood\n\nHow to Disappear is bassist Colin Greenwood’s stunning portrait of Radiohead in his own photographs.\n\nTwo decades in the making, he takes us on a journey into the heart of the 21st-century’s most influential band, a maverick collective who have vastly broadened our musical landscape while they dominate and distort it. On stage, backstage, in the rehearsal room, behind the scenes, on tour, at work and at play, Colin’s photographs, and the stories and memories they evoke for him in his accompanying text, form an intimate portrait of the musical and cultural iconoclasts as they travel through ‘our middle years: all the joy and doubt and confidence and uncertainty we would oscillate between’."
