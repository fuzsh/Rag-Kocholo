        "text": "The Onassis Stegi opens its arms for the first time to host the legendary Nick Cave, who returns to Europe in 2024 for a tour of rare solo shows and will have a stopover in Athens, followed by Belgrade, Helsinki, and Reykjavík. Nick Cave on piano, accompanied by Radiohead’s Colin Greenwood on bass guitar, presents a series of unique concerts full of emotion, atmosphere, and transcendence. These shows follow an acclaimed tour of the US and Australia, which saw Cave and Greenwood delight fans and media alike with their extraordinary presentation of Cave’s extensive and enduring catalog.\n\nPerhaps best known as lead singer and songwriter with the band Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds, Nick Cave’s artistic output is as ever-evolving as it is prolific. With a creative career that spans over four decades, Cave has worked across a diverse number of disciplines as a solo and collaborative musician, film score composer, author, screenwriter, and writer of his weekly mailer “The Red Hand Files,” and more recently as a ceramic artist.\n\n“I cannot wait to bring this special show, accompanied by the great Colin Greenwood. It is a privilege to share the songs with an audience in this way – stripped back and unadorned, revealing their essential nature.” Cave’s unique signature sound, full of intensity and lyrical depth, captivates the audience with the dark aesthetic of his lyrics and his intense stage presence."
