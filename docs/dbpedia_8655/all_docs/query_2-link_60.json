        "text": "Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood is in \"intensive care\" following a significant illness.\n\nThe 52-year-old British musician, keyboardist and composer was touring as part of The Smile with fellow Radiohead singer Thom Yorke as well as Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinner before being forced to cancel the supergroup's European leg on Friday.\n\nA statement from The Smile said Oxford-born Greenwood had been \"seriously ill\" and would \"soon return home,\" but added doctors had advised he needed rest.\n\nThe band has confirmed all ticket holders will be refunded at the point of purchase. A statement posted by The Smile on platforms like X, formerly known as Twitter, read: \"A few days ago, Jonny became seriously ill from an infection that needed emergency hospital treatment, some of it in intensive care.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"Mercifully he is now out of danger and will soon return home. We have been instructed by the medical team in charge of Jonny's care to cancel all engagements until he has had time to make a full recovery.\n\n\"To that end, the smile tour of Europe in August is cancelled. Refunds for headline shows will be available from your Ticket provider. We all wish Jonny a speedy recovery.\"\n\nThe statement was also shared by the band on Instagram. Additionally, Jonny's bandmate Thom shared it on the platform through his own account too, and Radiohead posted the statement on their Instagram Story this week.\n\nThe news has prompted well wishes from fans on social media. One person wrote: \"Take care Jonny.\" Another commented: \"Wishing Jonny a speedy recovery and sending well wishes for a return to performing.\" A third fan said: \"We love you Jonny and wish you a full and speedy recovery.\"\n\nRadiohead - which includes other members like Jonny's brother Colin Greenwood - formed more than three decades ago. The band went on to release their debut single, Creep, in 1992, which has been described as a \"worldwide hit\". Other songs released by the rock band include No Surprises.\n\nThe group have released numbers albums together over the years since their debut, Pablo Honey, in 1993. Their most recent album, A Moon Shaped Pool, was released back in 2016. The album featured singles such as Daydreaming.\n\nThom and Jonny founded spin-off band the Smile several years ago, with them bandmates alongside with Sons of Kemet's Tom. The Smile has released two UK top 10 albums, A Light For Attracting Attention and Wall Of Eyes. The former was released in 2022, whilst the latter came out earlier this year.\n\nThe Smile's sound has been compared to Radiohead, but with more of an influence from krautrock, a form of German experimental music, and jazz. The band was set to play venues in Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Poland next month."
