        "text": "Instruments: Bass Guitar.\n\nColin is the Radiohead bassist. And while he's not the most obvious outstanding bassist in the entire world, his style does suit Radiohead perfectly. I don't think any other bassist could take his place in this band, because it just wouldn't work. The continuous fast 'boom' he adds to songs like The National Anthem, and Dollars & Cents are vital to how the song comes across. He can change the way a song sounds entirely, such as Planet Telex (which would be nowhere without a bit of decent bass), and can also sit back and add simple yet significant touches to beautiful melodies. A good example of this is Street Spirit [Fade Out]. A bassist is required in a guitar band. He's not the most talented bassist to ever walk the earth, but he's the only one that could work well with a band like Radiohead. Such is his style, Colin is a vital foundation for the band to build their songs around.\n\nApparently Colin can't get laid, and is a compulsive liar. But he enjoys a drink and is very strong minded and astute with a good sense of humour. He's also downloaded a library... So Thom reckons.\n\nSee Colin's Page at Radiohead.com."
