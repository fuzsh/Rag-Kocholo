        "text": "For just a few seconds, there was an odd sense of calm as Monica Seles screamed in pain when a spectator stuck a knife in her back. As a crowd of 7,000 watched, the world's top women's tennis player stood up from her courtside chair, took a few steps and then gently fell in the arms of a tennis official.\n\n\"At first, everything seemed calm. Very calm,\" said Tampa's Toni Waters-Woods, a Women's Tennis Association official who was at the stadium in Hamburg, Germany. \"People were trying to figure out what it was. She jumped up and ran near the net, holding her back over her shoulder. You thought maybe it was a back spasm.\"\n\nSeles, 19, was not seriously injured by the inch-deep slit between her shoulder blades. The wound cut some muscle tissue and barely missed her spinal cord, but did not injure her lungs, according to the tournament doctor. Seles was kept overnight in a hospital for observation.\n\nSecurity at the hospital was tight.\n\nPolice arrested a 38-year-old man from eastern Germany who told them he was a fan of Steffi Graf _ currently the No.\n\n2 player. Graf is German.\n\n\"He said he was a Steffi Graf fan. He didn't want to kill Seles, only injure her to hinder her from playing,\" Hamburg police spokesman Dankmar Lundt told a German television station. Lundt said the man \"appears confused\" and may be mentally disturbed.\n\nThere were initial reports that the crime was politically motivated, but police have rejected that theory. Seles, who was born in Yugoslavia but now lives in Sarasota, has been the target of previous death threats related to the strife in her homeland. Seles has been criticized for her refusal to speak out against Serbian aggression in Bosnia and Croatia.\n\n\"There were no political grounds,\" Lundt said.\n\nSeles, playing in her first tournament since being sidelined for more than two months because of a viral infection, was leading Magadelana Maleeva 6-4, 4-3 and had gone to the sidelines for a break when the assailant struck.\n\nWith two security guards standing nearby, a heavy-set, disheveled man reached from the bleachers and struck Seles with a kitchen knife with a 5-inch blade.\n\nSeles cried in pain and dropped a glass of water as she walked to the net. Appearing confused, she slowly fell backward into the arms of an official.\n\n\"Monica looked like she was in shock and in a lot of pain. I ran off to get a trainer and others brought towels to her,\" said Rennae Stubbs, a player who was standing on the other side of the court with Maleeva's sister, Manuela. \"I don't know really if she realized what had happened to her. She was talking and able to move, but she seemed stunned.\"\n\nSeles may have been spared a more serious injury because spectators apparently saw the knife immediately before the attack.\n\n\"There was a lady in the crowd who screamed just before it happened,\" said Stubbs by telephone from Hamburg. \"Monica leaned forward and started to turn around to see what was going on, so he didn't hit her straight on.\n\n\"Sometimes somebody from the crowd might come up for an autograph, but nothing like this has ever happened. The security may have been taken by surprise. They were very good. They grabbed him straight away and apparently they broke his arm. Then it turned into a complete circus.\"\n\nAnother witness told Waters-Woods that somebody in the crowd bumped the assailant before the attack.\n\n\"I've talked to a few people who saw him and they said he was holding the knife above his head with two hands,\" she said. \"He got a little jostled, whether on purpose or by accident I don't know, but he didn't come straight down. It was sort of at an angle. It's actually a superficial wound.\"\n\nSecurity for players on the tour is provided on a per-tournament basis, said a spokesperson from the WTA office in St. Petersburg.\n\nIn this case, there were two additional guards on-court for players, which is somewhat unusual. WTA executive director Gerard Smith said security appeared to be adequate based on previous history.\n\n\"In the past we've had threats to certain players in certain circumstances,\" Smith said \"But the fact that it never happened before sort of makes it feel remote. Once it really happens, boy I'll tell you, it's a chilling effect. I think it changes the psyche of everyone who's associated with the sport. Clearly it's going to have an impact on the players.\"\n\nDuring Wimbledon last year, officials received a threat _ written in German _ that a bomb had been planted in the house where Seles was staying. No bomb was found.\n\nAna Leaird, director of public relations for the WTA, said Seles had been receiving death threats dealing with the Yugoslav political situation for the past couple of years.\n\n\"I personally was in Paris earlier this year at a tournament where she played,\" Leaird said. \"And one day this man was up in the stands and he had a big sign that said \"Monica Dead' _ \"Monica Morte' in French. And they called security and got him out of there.\"\n\nSeles' parents, Karolj and Esther, were in Hamburg but not in the stadium at the time of the attack. They had left the stadium for their hotel shortly before the match because Esther was not feeling well. They later joined Monica at the hospital.\n\nSeles' family emigrated to Sarasota when she was 13 so she could work with Nick Bollettieri at his tennis academy. She burst into prominence in 1989 when, as an unheralded 15-year-old, she defeated Chris Evert only weeks after turning pro.\n\nShe has been ranked No.\n\n1 on the WTA Tour since Sept.\n\n9, 1991.\n\nDoctors say her recovery time could be anywhere from one to three months, which could knock her out of the French Open and Wimbledon.\n\nMeanwhile, tennis officials were left to contemplate a violent act that had been unprecedented.\n\n\"We're fortunate that Monica's going to be okay. That's ours and everyone's first concern,\" said Smith. \"The next issue is how to deal with preventing this from occuring again. How do we reassure the player that they are going to be adequately protected at tournaments?\n\n_ Information from the Associated Press and Los Angeles Times was used in this report."
