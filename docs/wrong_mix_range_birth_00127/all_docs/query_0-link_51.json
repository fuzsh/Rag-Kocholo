We can‚Äôt all be an Eric Liddell, but we can try, and we have choices: ¬∑ We can choose to live in and fight for a world defined not by our differences but by our common hopes. ¬∑ We can choose to help a world defined not by conflict but by peace and opportunity. ¬∑ We can choose as Eric Liddell did to make difference. What Eric Liddell represents is the best of all of us and the promise and invitation of what we could do to help others. He offers us all an example of what is possible. Eric Liddell ‚Äòs values and humanity are as good a foundation as any for striving to make the world a better place. A teacher, a missionary, an athlete, a rugby player, the Flying Scotsman who rose above self- interest to help others. On and off the sports field Eric Henry Liddell made a difference. His life and values invite us all to make a difference.
