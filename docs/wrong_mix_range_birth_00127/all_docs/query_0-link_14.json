He was 91.\n\nBollettieri — who also coached household names including Andre Agassi, Maria Sharapova, Boris Becker, Monica Seles and Anna Kournikova — died Sunday at his home after a series of health issues, his manager, Steve Shulla, said in an interview with Associated Press on Monday.\n\n\"When he became sick, he got so many wonderful messages from former students and players and coaches,\" Shulla added. \"Many came to visit him. He got videos from others. It was wonderful. He touched so many lives and he had a great send-off.\"\n\n\"Anyone who knew Nick knows how much he loved developing the potential in young people,\" said Tim Pernetti, president of IMG Academy, which grew out of the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy.\n\nRELATED: Serena Williams Says Daughter Olympia Is Glad She Stepped Back from Tennis: 'I Don't Quite Know How to Feel!'\n\nSimon Bruty/Allsport Nick Bollettieri, young Anna Kournikova\n\nRELATED: Serena Williams Hasn't Taken a Break Since Her Last Tennis Match: 'I Needed to Keep Going'\n\n\"Even in his last days, you could often find him on campus, coaching and mentoring young student-athletes and staff with the same passion and enthusiasm as he did in his 20s,\" added Pernetti. \"Our heart goes out to his wife, Cindi, and his children. He has made a permanent and lasting impact on all of us.\"\n\nAndre Agassi remembered him with an Instagram post. \"Our dear friend, Nick Bollettieri, graduated from us last night,\" wrote the 8-time Grand Slam winner, alongside a photo of the pair on the tennis court. \"He gave so many a chance to live their dream. He showed us all how life can be lived to the fullest.\"\n\nRELATED: Serena Williams Clarifies 'I Am Not Retired' and Says Chances of Her Return are 'Very High'\n\nCaryn Levy/Sports Illustrated via Getty Images Nick Bollettieri, Andre Agassi\n\nRELATED: Venus Williams Says She's 'Working On' Her Dating Life: 'You've Got to Know When to Change'\n\nBorn in Pelham, New York, Bollettieri coached tennis on the side while earning a law degree from the University of Miami.\n\nIn 1978, he founded the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy after borrowing $1 million from a friend to build a live-in tennis academy for his students.\n\nIMG Academy has expanded beyond tennis to help student-athletes achieve their dreams in sports including baseball, football and soccer.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nPaul Harris/Getty Images Monica Seles, Nick Bollettieri\n\nRELATED: Wimbledon Relaxing Its Strict All-White Clothing Rule for Female Players\n\nIn his 30-year career as a coach, his students included multiple grand slam winners and ten world No. 1 players. He was also inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2014, becoming one of only four coaches to receive the honor.\n\n\"I forged my own path, which others found to be unorthodox and downright crazy,\" Bollettieri said in his induction speech. \"Yes, I am crazy. But it takes crazy people to do things that other people say cannot be done.\""
