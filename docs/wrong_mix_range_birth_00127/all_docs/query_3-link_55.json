        "text": "Monica Seles, a former World No. 1 professional tennis player was born in the former Yugoslavia, in Novi Sad, and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1994. She won nine Grand Slam singles titles. She became the youngest-ever champion at the French Open in 1990 at the age of 16. She was the dominant player in the women’s game during 1991 and 1992, but in 1993, she was forced out of the sport for two years following an on-court attack in which a spectator stabbed her in the back with a knife. She enjoyed some success after returning to the tour in 1995, including a singles title at the Australian Open in 1996, but was unable to consistently reproduce her very best form.\n\nThe ace Tennis player appeared in a show named ‘Dancing with the Stars’ on 25th March 2008 night, This is a television series based on British series ‘Strictly Come Dancing’. Monica and her professional dance partner Jonathan Roberts were eliminated out of the show for their lowest combined score. Ganesha studies Monica’s chart to check why she could not perform impressively. The analysis is based on Vedic Astrology.\n\nMonica Seles\n\nDate of birth :- 2nd December 1973\n\nTime of birth :- 12 pm\n\nPlace of birth :- Novi Sad (Yugoslavia)\n\nMonica Seles’ Natal Chart\n\nMonica Seles and Planetary Potential to Dance\n\nMonica Seles is presentable because she has Moon in the Ascendant. Mars in its own sign in the third house (Parakram Bhuvan) and Sun in Scorpio in the 10th house makes her a very good sports person. Venus is in Saturn’s sign in the 12th house. Venus gives glory and it is not well disposed in her chart. Fifth house of performance is also affected due to Ketu and retrograde Saturn. Lord of the fifth house Mercury is afflicted by Uranus, aspected by Mars. When Mars aspects the Lord of fifth house of performance, it makes one an intense performer – this factor is helpful in sports but dance is a delicate medium and creative presentation requires high water element or fire element where as Monica’s ‘Air Element’ is predominant so it doesn’t help much here. Venus is occupying only 3 Auspicious Bindus in her Ashtakvarga, in its own sign Capricorn so it’s not too powerful – dance is also ruled by Venus and companioned dance (couple dance) is ruled by Libra.\n\nEffect of Transiting Planets over Monica’s Natal chart\n\nTransiting Mars was passing through the fifth house over Natal Saturn and Ketu and transiting Saturn and Ketu are already passing through the seventh house of public image – in addition, Saturn is retrograde, just as in her Natal Chart! She was ought to be a loser, notes Ganesha.\n\nFuture forecast – Monica Seles\n\nGanesha finds that from 10th December 2008 till 1st May 2009 Jupiter remains in Capricorn. Juptier is posited with Venus in the 12th house in her chart. During the same phase, Rahu will also be passing through Capricorn so transiting Jupiter and Rahu will be creating ‘Chandaal Yoga’. Considering this, Ganesha feels that period between 10th December 2008 and 1st May 2009 is quite crucial for Monica’s personal life and she will have to refrain from getting involved in any scandalous affair.\n\nGanesha wishes good luck to Monica Seles."
