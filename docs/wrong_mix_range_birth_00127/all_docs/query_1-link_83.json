        "text": "She hadn't surfaced at a public event in nearly half a year. But\n\nwhatever misgivings she had about appearing in the Arete Awards\n\nshow in Chicago seemed to fall away as afternoon rehearsals gave\n\nway to the evening taping. Her visit as a presenter had been a\n\nfiercely guarded secret, so baseball great Hank Aaron was\n\nsurprised when she strode onto the soundstage unannounced, and\n\nESPN reporter Lesley Visser nudged her co-host, Ahmad Rashad, and\n\nwhispered, ``That's not Monica Seles, is it?'' Sonya Bell, the\n\n13-year-old blind gymnast whom Seles had come to honor, turned to\n\nSeles later that night and said, ``I know it took a lot of courage\n\nfor you to come here.''\n\nGiven Seles's reclusiveness since her stabbing in Hamburg,\n\nGermany, two years ago, no detail of her visit had been left to\n\nchance. Her transport from the Chicago airport, her seat at a\n\ncorner table facing the rest of the banquet room, the posting of a\n\nbodyguard (one guarding her back), all had been scripted. Seles\n\nentered the hall for the presentation of the awards, which honored\n\ncourage in sports, only after the rest of the crowd had been\n\nseated. She was escorted down the aisle during the grand\n\nintroductions. She was relaxed, even chatty, and everything went\n\nmarvelously -- until Seles and Bell joined the other stars onstage\n\nafter the show, and members of the audience began abandoning their\n\ntables, pressing forward for a handshake, a bit of shouted\n\nconversation, perhaps an autograph from one of the celebrities.\n\n``It was a deluge, just a rush of people, and I remember thinking,\n\nWe didn't talk about that; we didn't practice that,'' says Bell's\n\ncoach, Rhonda Bowen. ``I could see it botheredMonica a lot. She\n\ngot a little nervous. She started sweating. Her eyes got a little\n\nwide. She was getting very, very uncomfortable. Her manager\n\nfinally said, `It's time to go now.' ''\n\nThat was in November. Seles didn't make another public appearance\n\nuntil last weekend.\n\nIf she was pessimistic at all, the thoughts were shoved deep\n\ninside her. Rather than acting like someone afraid of what might\n\ncome down in a day or two in a courtroom half a world away, Monica\n\nSeles was acting almost buoyant. She traveled to Williamsburg,\n\nVa., last Friday to attend the opening of a tennis center at\n\nWilliam & Mary that had been funded by a friend. She made the\n\nrounds of banquets and receptions. Then, discarding her past\n\ninsistence on practicing in solitude, she even smacked some balls\n\naround on Sunday morning at William & Mary with a university\n\nadministrator, apparently unbothered that 10 or 12 people had\n\npaused to watch.\n\nWhen Monday finally broke and Seles caught a sunrise flight home\n\nto Sarasota, Fla., the day seemed to hold untold promise -- a\n\nchance to put the agony of the last two years behind her. That is,\n\nuntil Seles telephoned her agent during a layover in Atlanta and\n\nwas told that her assailant, Gunter Parche, was again a free man.\n\nFalling into the arms of her mother, Esther, Seles began sobbing\n\ninconsolably. When Seles's throat unclenched enough for her to\n\ntalk, her voice was tremulous and thin.\n\nShe didn't linger on her obvious shock as she spoke to a reporter\n\non the phone. By now, even the anger had been wrung out of her,\n\nreplaced only by a plaintive question that Seles understandably\n\nasked again and again. ``How can anyone say that it's O.K. to do\n\nwhat this man did to another human being?'' Seles said into the\n\nphone, crying softly. ``How can they say it's O.K.? I'm a human\n\nbeing.''\n\nHow? The basic facts about the attack are undisputed. Parche, an\n\nunemployed German lathe operator, admits that he stalked Seles for\n\ndays before stabbing her once in the shoulder, his two hands\n\nwrapped around the handle of a nine-inch boning knife. The attack\n\noccurred on April 30, 1993, during a tournament match at the\n\nRothenbaum Tennis Club in Hamburgbefore 7,000 people. Parche\n\nsaid he assaulted Seles to restore his countrywoman, Steffi Graf,\n\nto the No. 1 world ranking that Seles had wrested away.\n\nYet when Parche's first trial concluded on Oct. 13, 1993, he\n\nreceived only a two-year suspended sentence. Judge Elke Bosse said\n\nthen that she found Parche's promise to not hurt anyone again\n\n``absolutely believable,'' especially whenbuttressed by a\n\ncourt-appointed psychiatrist's opinion that Parche is ``mentally\n\ndiminished'' but a low risk to be a repeat offender. After a\n\n19-month wait, a new judge, Gertraut Goring, basically concurred,\n\nadding that Seles's refusal to testify was a determining factor,\n\neven though in testifying Seles would have had to sit with her\n\nback to the courtroom.\n\nSuddenly, instead of the closure she sought, Seles was back where\n\nshe was two years ago, trying to explain away the unexplainable\n\nthrough her terror and her heartbreak. ``How can they have\n\nexpected me to go back there and testify?'' Seles said on Monday,\n\nher voice breaking again. ``When I heard I would have to sit in\n\nthe courtroom with my back to him, I knew it was the 100 percent\n\nabsolute right decision. I mean, the man stabbed me.\n\n``There was the way he did it, the way he planned it, the idea\n\nthat he put the knife in my back, pulled it out and was going to\n\ndo it again. I can still see the hate in his face that I saw when\n\nI turned around. And they say he doesn't have to go to jail at\n\nall? ``I don't understand,'' she sobbed, her voice trailing\n\noff until it was no more than a murmur. ``I'm just . . . so . . .\n\nconfused.''\n\nBefore Monday's verdict, Seles's two-year absence from tennis had\n\nbeen blamed on her grievances about the way the court in Hamburg\n\nand the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) treated her immediately\n\nafter the attack. The last time Seles granted extended interviews,\n\n15 months ago, she spoke poignantly of being a talent derailed at\n\n19. But the most forbidding obstacle to her return to tennis has\n\nalways been the spectral possibility that Parche, or someone like\n\nhim, would surface again -- outside a store, through a window,\n\nacross an airplane aisle, in a restaurant booth next to hers.\n\nThat's the macabre fear Seles lives with. That's the unshakable\n\nanxiety that rears up unexpectedly and overtakes her. Everything\n\nwill be fine for long stretches; Seles's tennis workouts and her\n\ndetermination to get back on tour may even peak. Then something --\n\nperhaps just sitting in a darkened movie theater -- triggers a\n\nfresh rush of uneasiness. ``Then she's thinking of the stabbing,''\n\nsays her father, Karolj Seles, ``and she goes to pieces again.''\n\nBut in the days before Parche's retrial began on March 21, there\n\nhad been a palpable stirring in Seles's camp, and some guarded\n\noptimism that she might be preparing to return to the tour.\n\nPressed for concrete evidence, though, associates, friends and\n\ntennis officials spoke only of ``gut feelings'' and ``signs.''\n\nOne reason for the optimism was a flurry of conciliatory gestures\n\nby Seles. For Parche's retrial, Seles submitted a six-paragraph\n\nletter citing ``two years of hell'' he had caused her; she had not\n\ntestified or submitted a statement for his first trial. She also\n\npermitted her Nevada sports psychologist, Jerry Russel May, to\n\ndetail how he has treated her for posttraumatic stress disorder\n\nsince July 1993. May, who has had more than 120 sessions with\n\nSeles, told the court that Seles has flashbacks to the attack and\n\nthat she has talked of feeling ``like a bird in a cage.''\n\nOn the eve of the second trial, Karolj granted interviews for the\n\nfirst time since his daughter's stabbing. In addition to softening\n\nhis family's hard stance against the WTA, he startled U.S. Tennis\n\nAssociation officials with a declaration that Monica, a\n\nnaturalized U.S. citizen since March of last year, dreams of\n\nplaying for the U.S. in the 1995 Fed Cup and in the 1996 Atlanta\n\nOlympics.\n\n``That's great,'' says WTA chief executive officer Anne Person\n\nWorcester. ``But I had absolutely no idea. None.''\n\nNo one did, and Seles remained out of sight until last weekend.\n\nEven tennis officials who would be involved in her return to the\n\ntour say it was hard to tell whether groundwork was really being\n\nlaid for her comeback, or whether the Seleses were only trying to\n\naffect the outcome of the Parche trial by briefly opening a portal\n\ninto their lives. When Fed Cup captain Billie Jean King spoke with\n\nSeles, she said she was left with the feeling that Seles still\n\nloves tennis. ``But she doesn't know if she'll ever be able to get\n\nover the fear and come back again,'' King said.\n\nClearly Seles had reason to fear Parche in the wait for the\n\nretrial. While the appeal was pending, Parche was free with no\n\nprobation restrictions -- meaning no supervision and no\n\ncourt-ordered psychiatric care. And once Parche returned to his\n\nhome in Gorsbach in the former East Germany, his obsession with\n\nGraf showed little sign of abating.\n\nParche continues to send Graf letters; on her birthday he sends\n\nher money, suggesting she buy herself a necklace or have her\n\nmother purchase a bouquet of 24 roses. In court testimony two\n\nweeks ago, Parche, 40, admitted to having sent a threatening\n\nletter to German track star Heike Drechsler, but he added, ``I'm\n\nnot nearly as fanatical as I used to be.''\n\nSeles is hardly the only tennis star who ever received death\n\nthreats. Chris Evert once played a final in Toronto with two\n\npolicemen dressed as ball kids. For Seles, though, the death\n\nthreats often had a distinctly political cant, not surprising\n\ngiven the ethnic wars in her homeland, the former Yugoslavia.\n\nSeles and her family, who have lived in Florida since 1986, are\n\nethnic Hungarians, but they are often mistaken for Serbs because\n\nthey come from Novi Sad, a Serb-controlled village near Bosnia.\n\nStill, a former business associate who has known the Seles family\n\nfor nearly 10 years, insists, ``They've long been suspicious of\n\neveryone. And that predated the war in Bosnia.''\n\nThe businessman says Monica used to ask if her commercial flights\n\ncould be stopped on the runway so she could alight into a waiting\n\nvan and bypass the terminal. ``She always thought someone was out\n\nto get her,'' the businessman says.\n\nEven before her face became well known, Seles traveled in wigs.\n\nShe often booked duplicate plane reservations, lest anyone try to\n\ntail her. Even the Seles family home in Sarasota, bought years\n\nbefore the stabbing, is a monument to caution. The sprawling white\n\nstucco house sits at the end of a road inside a quiet development\n\nprotected by a gatehouse. It backs onto an idyllic golf course.\n\nHowever, it is the only home in the complex surrounded by a\n\n10-foot-tall stucco wall, with a driveway and sidewalk sealed off\n\nby two sets of ornate electronic iron gates. Signs outside the\n\nmassive wall read, NO TRESPASSING, BEWARE OF DOG and PRIVATE\n\nPROPERTY.\n\n``It's a little paranoid,'' says John Korff, a tennis promoter who\n\nused to deal with the Seleses regularly. ``But a lot of it is the\n\nbackground the family came from.''\n\nKarolj was a teenager during World War II. His overriding memory\n\nof those years in Yugoslavia is of ``all the people who were\n\ndeported.'' During the interview he granted SI on the eve of\n\nParche's retrial, Seles pushed tears from his eyes twice: once\n\nwhile describing Monica's state of mind and once as he retold what\n\nhis father, Jakab, went through as a conscientious objector during\n\nWorld War I.\n\nWhen Jakab Seles refused, because of his religious beliefs, to\n\ntake up a gun and fight, some militiamen blindfolded him, stuck\n\nhim in a foxhole and fired some shots into the air, thinking he\n\nwould be terrorized into picking up a nearby gun to save himself.\n\nThey were only half right. ``My father did not pick up the gun,''\n\nKarolj said, ``but for many years after that, [the terror] stayed\n\nwith him in his head.''\n\nSmiling sadly, Seles added, ``In 60 years of life, you learn life\n\nis like this. Ups and downs. Things happen. But you must fight.\n\nAnd you must forgive.''\n\nBut explain yourself to outsiders? Be indiscriminate about whom\n\nyou trust? No. The Seleses have long insisted the price of their\n\nfriendship is silence. Their IMG agents, tennis officials and\n\nother players know that breaching the understanding can cost them\n\nwhat little access they get. On tour the family was as close to a\n\nself-contained unit as you can get. Karolj coached Monica. Her\n\nolder brother, Zoltan, was her hitting partner. Her mother was a\n\nfrequent travel companion. And Monica handled most of the\n\nlogistics. By age 16 -- the year she won her first Grand Slam\n\ntitle, the '90 French Open -- Monica was the family's lone\n\nbreadwinner. She was fluent in English, booked her own practice\n\ncourts and even had the gumption to question WTA officials about\n\nthe taxes withheld from her tournament checks.\n\nWhen she left the game at 19 she was the absolute best. She had\n\namassed 32 singles titles in only four years, won seven of the\n\nprevious eight Grand Slam events that she played and made the\n\nfinals in 32 of her last 33 tournaments. Other players had more\n\nathleticism. What separated Seles was her unbreakable will. And\n\nthis: ``No one really knew her,'' says Martina Navratilova.\n\nThough Seles's 23-month absence is the longest of her career, it's\n\nnot the first time she has slipped out of sight. In 1993 she\n\nmissed 63 days with an unspecified viral infection, and in 1991,\n\nshortly after becoming No. 1, she went incommunicado and skipped\n\nvenerable Wimbledon. In the firestorm that ensued, the frothing\n\nBritish tabloids suggested everything from the possibility that\n\nSeles was pregnant (or a ``Wimble-mum'') to the notion that she\n\nwas romancing Donald Trump. When Stephanie Tolleson, Seles's\n\nagent, finally tracked her down, she implored Seles, ``Say\n\nsomething. At least let me tell them all you're not pregnant.''\n\nSeles shot back, ``How do you know I'm not?''\n\nEven in the best of times, Seles is a bundle of contradictions.\n\nShe can be charming yet coy, good-hearted but peevish,\n\npublicity-loving and abruptly inaccessible. She cultivated an\n\nimage as a glamorous enigma. Yet she often becomes hurt or angry\n\nwhen, inevitably, she's misunderstood. She insists on near-total\n\ncontrol while reserving her right to act unpredictably.\n\nIn addition to Seles's talent, tennis misses her flamboyance and\n\nher sense of the absurd. For her debut on Court Central at the\n\nFrench Open in 1989, she flipped roses to the crowd. For a while\n\nshe changed hair colors like other people change socks, trying to\n\ndecide whether to go blonder (``You know, the Swedish goddess\n\nlook,'' she said) or shave her pate like rock star Sinead O'Connor\n\n-- ``until somebody reminded me my head would get pretty\n\nsunburned,'' Seles cracked.\n\nAmong the thoughts that now make Karolj cry is, ``Monica was a\n\ngirl who was laughing all the time, having fun,'' he says. ``All\n\nthat is now gone.'' Until last weekend Monica had made only three\n\npublic appearances since being stabbed -- at a charity exhibition\n\nand press conference before the '93 U.S. Open, at a charity event\n\nin Monaco last summer and at the Arete Awards.\n\nIf she occasionally feels like a bird ina cage, she's not a\n\ncomplete shut-in. Friends say Seles has been skiing in Vail,\n\nfrequenting the beach near her Florida home and haunting shopping\n\nmalls. Last summer she attended some World Cup soccer games. She\n\nhas also tried hiking, fly-fishing and camping.\n\nSeles rarely answers the telephone when she's home, but she has\n\nbecome an inveterate fax sender and letter writer. When Pam\n\nShriver, president of the WTA at the time, offhandedly told\n\nreporters in January 1994 that she'd had a recent telephone\n\nconversation with Seles, Seles fired off a fax to Shriver and sent\n\ncopies to four or five other tennis officials. Seles's gripe?\n\n``She felt I had betrayed our conversation,'' Shriver says,\n\n``because I said she was considering playing Australia.''\n\nBy then Seles had said as much herself in an interview in late\n\nDecember '93. Shortly before that, the president of Tennis\n\nAustralia, Geoff Pollard, suggested that Seles might play in the\n\nAustralian Open, which is held in mid-January. Fila was\n\nconvinced. It spent $3.5 millionon a new line of Seles\n\nclothing.\n\nThen figure skater Nancy Kerrigan was clubbed on the knee on Jan.\n\n6 at the U.S. Olympic Trials. Seles released a statement later the\n\nsame day saying she wouldn't play Australia after all. Seles's\n\npublicist now insists the timing of her announcement was\n\ncoincidence. (Others agree, saying Seles's never-explained reason\n\nfor not playing was her father's diagnosis of treatable prostate\n\ncancer.) Either way, a shaken Seles did phone a friend after the\n\nKerrigan attack and say, ``It happened again.''\n\nBeyond her fears of another assault, Seles has never given the\n\nother reasons that keep her out of tennis. An associate says Seles\n\nhas struggled with ``depression, the fear of starting over -- the\n\nquestion of, `If I do come back, how will I do?' ''\n\nSeles also remains confounded by the idea that anyone would want\n\nto assault her. ``She constantly asks herself if she did something\n\nwrong to deserve the attack,'' herpsychologist testified at\n\nParche's retrial. The pain of the assault was intensified a week\n\nafter the incident when the tour'stop 25 players, pressured into\n\na quick vote by then WTA executive director Gerry Smith, decided\n\nnot to freeze Seles's No. 1 ranking.\n\nApparently, as Seles saw it, Parche's lunatic aim of elevating\n\nGraf back to No. 1 was achieved with an assist from the WTA. Then\n\nthe perceived betrayals continued: Parche was given no jail time,\n\nand the companies with which Seles had endorsement contracts began\n\nto desert her because of her inactivity.\n\nSeles has been accused of staying out of action to cash in a fat\n\ninsurance policy, to facilitate a jump from Fila to Nike and to\n\nimprove her position in her soon-to-be-filed civil suit against\n\nthe German Tennis Federation. Her settlement demands regarding the\n\nHamburg incident are likely to start at more than $10 million,\n\naccording to her lawyer Wilhelm Danelzik. Fila is suing Seles for\n\nbreach of contract and fraud. The lawsuit alleges that Seles\n\nmisled the company three times about supposed comeback attempts\n\nwhen, in fact, she is ``retired.''\n\nWomen's tennis has to hope Seles isn't gone for good. When she\n\novertook Graf in 1991 to become the youngest No. 1 ever, it seemed\n\ntheir rivalry would replace the excitement Navratilova and Evert\n\ngenerated in the '80s. Now, without Seles, women's tennis is in a\n\nsort of limbo. The WTA has suffered a series of other hits:\n\nNavratilova's retirement; Graf's back ailments; Mary Pierce's\n\nstruggles with her abusive father, Jim; and Jennifer Capriati's\n\nspiral into drug rehab. The players who have been No. 1 since she\n\nleft -- Graf and Aranxta Sanchez Vicario -- are stuck facing\n\nquestions about where they would be if Monica were still playing.\n\nAs Graf's agent, Phil de Picciotto, says, ``This feels just like\n\nwhen Tracy Austin and Andrea Jaeger walked away [so young].\n\nThere's this whole new lost generation -- Jennifer, Monica -- that\n\nshould still be playing, and they aren't.''\n\nSeles may have been mercurial long before Parche lifted his knife,\n\nbut her lingering fears are hardly delusional. If anything, the\n\nstabbing seems to have left her hyperlucid. It stripped her of the\n\ncomforting but ultimately baseless presumptions that the rest of\n\nus use to get through everyday life -- beliefs as simple as\n\ntrusting that the deliveryman knocking at your front door intends\n\nyou no harm.\n\nA knife blade shoved in your back in full view of 7,000 people is\n\npretty convincing evidence that there are no guarantees. That's\n\nthe chilling reality many victims of violent crimes can't shake.\n\nThat's why even an innocuous event -- the approach of those\n\nwell-wishers at the Arete Awards -- is enough to bring Seles's old\n\nfears welling back up.\n\nAs Seles thought about Monday's verdict, which left Parche a free\n\nman, she did not flatly rule out a comeback. ``I've been working\n\nso hard at everything, working so hard to put this all behind\n\nme,'' she said. ``And I still want to put this all behindme. I'm\n\ngoing to continue to do the best Ican do.''\n\nFor now, that will be enough.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO:ACTION PRESS While Parche (at court for retrial) faces no restrictions, Seles (shown in 1993) feels \"like a bird in a cage\" at her Sarasota estate.
