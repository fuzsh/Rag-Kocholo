        "text": "For those of you who don’t know, not only do I spend time working on my personal beverage blog, but I also have the glitzy position of Director of Marketing & Education at the Divine Wine Emporium here in the shoreline village of Niantic, CT. With fall coming up, it means we start rounding up guest speakers from different wine and spirits companies to tell good stories and of course, pour samples for us to try.\n\nSo let me be a shill and give some press to Divine Wine today. Our calendar is filling up fast, and we are getting the festivities started tomorrow night. The guest speaker programs are typically free, while our in-house educational sessions require a fee of some kind. Here’s a rundown of what we have coming up, and if you are in town give a call to Divine Wine at (860) 691-1053 to RSVP for any of the programs below.\n\nCraft distilling is exciting. I am happy to see these small-scale producers, who put all their efforts into making something that tastes good, have success. I also enjoy when these folks are local/regional; it means we have an easier time getting them to come visit us in the Divine Wine Classroom to introduce themselves and share their passion with us.\n\nFor example, several years ago we welcomed Christian Stromberg, Founder and Head Distiller at Saxtons River Distillery in Brattleboro, Vermont. At that time, he presented his Sapling line of maple whiskeys, a maple liqueur, and PERC coffee liqueur. Now, maple syrup certainly has a distinct flavor to it and it shows up in their spirits when used, but it isn't overpowering. It's a smart use of a different ingredient and, most important to me, it was something unique that told us these spirits are definitely from Vermont.\n\nI have actually had one visit to Brattleboro. The Greatest Wife In The World and I took our eldest (and only at the time) on a business trek to this town just over the Massachusetts border. The boy and I actually spent a lot of time driving away from Brattleboro to visit places like King Arthur Flour, Dartmouth, and the Basketball Hall of Fame. As a family we even found ourselves heading to Keene, New Hampshire to Elm City Brewhouse for dinner. Aside from the killer roadside BBQ joint Top of the Hill Grill, we didn't do a ton in town.\n\nLittle did I know, a guy was working out of his barn to develop this distillery that moved to Brattleboro a couple of years later in 2011! Since then, Christian has done very well for himself, gaining tremendous press for his work. Additionally, the new product added to the range of spirits does not involve maple or coffee, but rather botanicals.\n\nYes...gin! As you may have guessed in reading my posts, gin goes over incredibly well here. It was my lucky day when I was able to get my hands on a sample of Saxton River Snowdrop Gin (Thanks, Boss!). This is an American Dry Gin (patterned after the London Dry style) with a total of 18 different botanicals using vacuum distillation.\n\nThe usual coriander and juniper are present, but check out the rest of them on the bottle's inside label:\n\nThis is a darn good gin, too. We tested this out in a cocktail with Fever Tree's Mediterranean tonic and lime. The Italian herbs stood out when mixed with this specific tonic and even brought out an impression of lavender; Fever Tree does mention that the Mediterranean tonic is \"made with floral botanicals\" so it wouldn't surprise me if lavender is one of those flowers in the recipe. The other thing I like about the Snowdrop Gin (about $35, by the way) is that it is bottled at 89 Proof. It may seem trivial, but bottling higher than the usual 80 or even 84 Proof allows the delicate botanicals (such as citrus) to hold up better in a cocktail when diluted by the tonic. It makes a difference.\n\nSaxtons River also has a very informative web site, including info on which states carry their products. I encourage you to visit them.\n\nWhat are your favorite local distilleries that have made a name for themselves already, or should receive more recognition? I would love for you to comment below or post to my Facebook page.\n\nOver a decade ago, The Greatest Wife In The World and I embarked on a trip that, in my mind, would not fail to disappoint. We flew out to Seattle to introduce ourselves to the city and depart for a cruise to Alaska, stopping at various points along the northwestern Pacific coastline. While I would love to spend time professing my love for Seattle's food and beverage scene or the amazing sights of Alaska, I am actually going to fill you in on a port visit that we did not spend a ton of time in: Victoria, British Columbia.\n\nYou see, one of the port excursions involved a trip to the Fairmont Empress Hotel to have tea, an experience it has provided since 1908. It sounded like a good way to get a change of scenery, so we were in. We were seated at a table with an older couple from Texas, and let me tell you...it was a great time. Sitting in a fancy room, sipping tea (we had a choice of many types) and nibbling finger sandwiches and appetizers...some high class all the way! We also took home the Fairmont's Signature black loose tea blend. Little did I know that here in the little New England village where we call home, I would recently encounter this tea again, only not in the form that I would have expected.\n\nI stopped by Divine Wine and noticed a bottle on the counter behind the register where we keep special orders. I asked the boss what it was, and he handed it to me. What the hell was this? The liquid inside was a striking blue-purple hue (not a synthetic Windex blue or a Welch's grape juice purple). Is this some gimmicky liqueur? Then I read the label: \"Empress 1908 Gin.\"\n\nI was taken aback to find out this was a gin. Then I looked in greater detail: \"Distilled and bottled by Victoria Distillers, Victoria, British Columbia.\" I asked the boss who found this/knows about this/where did it come from? It turns out a customer absolutely swears by this gin and asked if we could get it...so we did. Then I start reading the mini-pamphlet around the bottle's neck and realize that the Empress 1908 Gin takes its name from the Empress Tea blend we sampled from the Fairmont hotel. The tea is one of the eight organic botanicals used in producing the gin. How about that?\n\nBut what about the color? Well, that comes from this little beauty right here:\n\nLet me tell you...this is some good stuff. Flavor-packed and grapefruit-forward, the Empress has plenty of juniper to appease the traditional gin drinker, but some ginger and cinnamon (each is part of the botanical recipe) to provide something a little different. It's a fragrant gin where the grapefruit definitely doesn't quit...a slice of grapefruit would be a fine garnish. The addition of citrus or tonic will also change the color to different shades of purple or pink depending on how much of those ingredients you add to the cocktail. From a flavor standpoint, I think the most impressive part is the use of corn-derived base spirit; a lot of corn-based spirits can have a full, sweet flavor that I would have imagined could interfere with the floral and spicy botanicals, but it was lighter and more refreshing than I expected and no perceptible sweetness (side note: wheat-based spirits tend to give you a soft, clean base that really allows the botanicals to shine through clearly).\n\nThe Empress is one you can have a lot of fun experimenting with on your own, but this is a really nice Mother's Day gift (assuming Mom likes her gin). This will cost you around $40 for a 750mL bottle. Get to know more about Empress Gin here. This is absolutely worth it if you can find it in your market. If not...have your retailers pester their distributors to get it on board.\n\nThank you all for bearing with me while I took the week off as I escaped the hell that is a New England winter to islands under the Eastern Caribbean sunshine. It was great to enjoy a break with my family, but it also turned out to be a time of reflection and self-evaluation. Part of looking inward meant new experiences as far as places I have never been to before, but also what my tastes and preferences are when it comes to my own consumption of tasty adult beverages.\n\nYou see, The Greatest Family In The World and I ventured to the islands via Disney Cruise Line (which I will sing the praises of at a later date...just know that the food, drink, service, and attention to detail is impeccable and I highly recommend doing it sometime). Among walking the main squares by the ports, enjoying the sandy beaches, and pictures with Goofy, there was plenty of time to get to the grown-up portions of the ship, notably Deck 4, which had all of the killer wines, spirits, and cocktails you could ever want. One of items that I saw on board in the lounges embodied a dichotomy of familiar and foreign that I have been feeling since I was legally able to drink. Today, I speak of Campari.\n\nCampari has a stunning package. Launched back in 1861, it stands out on a bar shelf with its intense bright red liquid and a bold, yet traditional-looking label. I have seen Campari so many times, I feel like I should already know what it is about. But you want to know something? I have never consumed it until last week's getaway.\n\nThis Italian bitter liqueur made up of fruits, herbs, and other plant life is so versatile; it can be used as an aperitif or as a digestive drink. Campari became popular in the United States during the ridiculous Prohibition Era as it was not classified as alcohol, but as a medicine. Campari and soda became an instant hit, and when sweet vermouth was added to the equation, the Italians called it the Americano. However in 1919 when Count Camillo Negroni asked for a higher octane version of the Americano, he chose gin to replace the club soda and the basis for today's Negroni was born. The Americano was originally garnished with a lemon, but an orange was chosen as the Negroni's garnish simply to signal a differentiation from the Americano.\n\nAt the Disney Cruise Line's Skyline Lounge, they served a cocktail called \"Il Valentino,\" which contained Hendrick's gin, Campari, and Antica Formula 1786 Vermouth shaken with ice and strained. This was pretty much a Negroni served without ice in a cocktail glass rather than on the rocks in an Old Fashioned glass. When I tasted Il Valentino, I knew I was ready to embrace the Negroni (which I did when we stopped at The Wave at the Contemprary Resort in Disneyworld before coming home). It was tremendous. With Hendrick's being softer in texture and lighter on juniper than, say, Tanqueray, it does a great job countering the complex, bittersweet flavor of Campari. Antica Formula 1786 has very clean fruity flavors with bitter orange and coffee notes and adds extra depth. Additionally, I can't say enough about possessing quality base ingredients in a cocktail...it makes all the difference in the world between a decent cocktail and an extraordinary one.\n\nVariants of the Negroni substitute the gin for whiskey or Tequila. Some examples might use dry vermouth instead of sweet. However the common link in any version of a Negroni, whether the classic or a variant, is always Campari's neon red color and distinct flavor and aroma.\n\nHere is your recipe to make a classic Negroni at home. There are so many flavors going on, it's hard to describe. You just have to try it for yourself, especially if you are a fan of bitter flavors. It's a new favorite of mine that I can drink at any time of year, before or after a huge meal.\n\n1.5 oz Antica Formula 1786 (or other preferred sweet red vermouth)\n\n1.5 oz Campari\n\n1.5 oz Gin (your choice)\n\nAdd all ingredients to an Old Fashioned or Highball glass filled with large ice cubes. Stir and garnish with an orange slice. Drink, fall in love, and eat everything in the fridge.\n\nAs much as I love to dive into wine, distilled spirits has dominated my beverage landscape as of late; it comes with the territory of running classes in this category at the store. As a result, I have managed to build up a bit of inventory in my home bar over the past year, all while understanding some of the differences among the huge range of options available to us all.\n\nFor those of you who are attempting to build your own inventory, my guess is there are mixed feelings out there. There is the camp of people who have brands they love and will always go to with ease, while others don't know what to seek out and spend hard-earned money on. It can be difficult for the latter group; you want to have a complete set of bar staples for guests or mixing cocktails, but you may not be sure what to drop $20-$40 on that will deliver for you.\n\nWine lovers, you may remember when we built a case of wine together that goes easy on the wallet; our task was to keep the case to $120-$150. If you were to buy the spirit essentials you need, you will easily spend more since the average price per bottle of quality spirits are high than it is for wine. Fortunately, you can do this for about $250. That's right...a full bar that gives you versatility, enjoyment, and outstanding value for roughly twice what we paid to get the wine inventory started.\n\nLet's do this thing. I find that as long as you have one of each of the following spirits/mixers, you can make most classic cocktails, plus give yourself some things to sip straight if you like. In no particular order: Blended Scotch Whisky, Bourbon Whiskey, gin, rum, vodka, Tequila, Cognac, sweet vermouth, dry vermouth, orange liqueur, bitters, and tonic water. Yes, I know tonic water is non-alcoholic, but there are some great artisanal options for you to choose from these days and can be a major component in cocktails. Pick up some lemons, limes, and a small bottle of hot sauce, and you are in business.\n\nNow for specifics on the Big Twelve bar essentials. You will be able to get away with spending no more than $35 on any of these bottles. These are all solid. Please note that spirits pricing can fluctuate depending on where you live, how much your retailer can buy to keep costs down, or depending on whether a category is generally trending up or down.\n\nFor your whisk(e)y:\n\nFamous Grouse or Johnnie Walker Black Label blended Scotch whisky ($35 ea.)\n\nI once again present two options. When it comes to Bourbon, there are two fairly distinct groups: low-rye and high-rye. Consider this to be similar in a way to peated or unpeated Scotch. The higher the rye content, the more aromatic and assertive its flavors will be. Less rye means corn's soft texture and sweetness will come out.\n\nBulleit has a citrusy and spicy character, and bottled at 90 proof, it can withstand the addition of other ingredients that will tamp down some of the rye in your Old Fashioned or Manhattan. Larceny, a new product getting a lot of play out on the market has not only a lower rye profile, but also some wheat, making for a gentler Bourbon. Larceny has more of a honeyed, toffee-like character that is definitely suited for sipping.\n\nFor your brandy:\n\nCamus VS Cognac ($30)\n\nHennessy is very popular, and has the skyrocketing price to match. I know it wasn't that long ago that I wrote about it, but it should be a bar staple.\n\nFor your Tequila:\n\nCazadores Silver ($25)\n\nAm I being lazy? Maybe, but again it will deliver on the price for you as I wrote in my classic cocktails post on Margaritas.\n\nFor your rum:\n\nPlantation 3 Stars White Rum ($20)\n\nTito's Handmade Vodka ($23)\n\nTito Beveridge (a name that seems destined to be in this industry) created this Texas-based pot-distilled vodka that is now the top-selling spirits brand in the United States. Pot-distilled vodkas have some body to them (a la Ketel One), making this a vodka you could sip neat if well-chilled. I can also testify that this made a killer base for a Bloody Mary during a football tailgate party! Despite the brand's overwhelming success, Tito's is still very reasonably priced.\n\nFor your Gin:\n\nGordon's London Dry Gin ($20)\n\nFor the traditional, juniper-forward gin drinkers out there, this should fall right in your strike zone. Tanqueray is another option as well, which is bottled at a higher proof (great for not losing delicate citrus and floral aromas/flavor when mixing cocktails), but you may spend a few more dollars. Gordon's is the top selling gin brand in the world with its mass appeal and easy mixability.\n\nFor your vermouth:\n\nMartini & Rossi Sweet ($11) and Dry ($11) Vermouth\n\nThere's no need to get too fancy here. If you are on a limited budget, the M&R products are the way to go. They do the job just fine when you are getting started. Sweet vermouth works for your Negroni, Manhattan, and Rob Roy, while the dry vermouth will mix fine with your Martini or act as a flavor-booster in your cooking (a fine addition in Carbonara pasta, for the record).\n\nFor your orange liqueur:\n\nAgavero Orange ($23) or Caffo Solara Triple Orange ($25)\n\nThis comes down to what you like to do with your cocktails. If you are REALLY into Margaritas, the Agavero is a Tequila-based orange liqueur that meshes nicely with Tequila (thanks, Captain Obvious!), also costing you less than the Patron version. If you seek versatility in cocktails, where many of them call for triple sec/orange liqueur, the Caffo from Italy gives you good, fiery orangey flavor. As a reference point, Cointreau (as much as I adore it) hits the $30 mark in some markets. Again, we are seeking value, so either of these will do a solid job for you.\n\nAdditional mixers:\n\nAngostura Bitters ($6)\n\nThis is a staple that can't be overlooked. Yes, it is everywhere and readily available, but for good reason. It is solid. As you continue progressing in building your inventory, we can talk about that...and we will (how's that for a tease?)!\n\nFever Tree Tonic ($6/4-pack)\n\nHere's your \"splurge\" product. I can't say enough about the clean flavors Fever Tree provides. Aside from the flagship tonic, they have flavored versions such as lemon and elderflower that will add extra depth of flavor to your Gin (or Vodka) & Tonic. Don't believe me? Taste Fever Tree alongside Schweppe's or Canada Dry and you will become a convert!\n\nSo there it is! This is an outstanding starting point for building up your personal bar. These twelve items will help you get the ball rolling and serve as your baseline for branching out...and we will cover that sooner than later!\n\nJames Pimm was owner of an oyster bar who first devised a gin-based drink that had a range of herbs and spices to help with digestion back in 1823, served up in a \"No. 1 cup.\" With that, \"Pimms No. 1\" liqueur was born, and subsequent iterations came about with different alcohols as the base material. For instance, \"No. 2\" was based on Scotch whisky, \"No. 3\" on brandy, \"No. 4\" on rum, \"No. 5\" on rye, and \"No. 6\" on vodka. While No. 3 is available seasonally and No. 6 is produced in small quantity, the version withstanding the test of time is Pimm's No. 1.\n\nAs Pimm's No. 1 gained in popularity throughout the United Kingdom, its fruitiness became a great mixing partner with carbonated lemonade and local produce that thrived in England (apples, strawberries, cucumbers), and mint), called the \"Pimm's Cup.\" Its refreshing qualities were perfect for English summer days, festivals, and sporting events (such as polo). While Wimbledon started way back in 1877, it wasn't until 1971 that Pimm's opened a bar at the All England Lawn Tennis Club and, along with honest-to-goodness Champagne, became alcoholic staples here.\n\nMany variants of the Pimm's Cup evolved. Oranges and lemons have been used frequently. To amp up the \"summery-ness,\" passion fruit has shown up in some versions of the cocktail. Ginger ale/beer or lemon-lime soda has taken the place of the lemonade, especially where carbonated lemonade can't be sourced easily. To make a \"Pimm's Royal Cup,\" Champagne or other sparkling wine takes the place of the lemonade/lemon-lime soda/ginger ale. No matter what you choose, you can view a Pimm's Cup to be like an English Sangria; add whatever produce you have on-hand to your Pimm's No. 1.\n\nOf course, when we discuss classic cocktails here at Flight School, we always try to get as close as we can to the original version. If you want to have a go with this summertime British favorite, here's what you need to make it happen. Get dressed in all-white and have at it!\n\nYou know it wasn't that long ago that I gave you an overview of what to look for with gin. I also shamelessly plugged a class that I led this past Friday, where we had a great night of education and fun. As we tasted through our lineup of gin, there seemed to be a common theme on display:\n\nAnything goes.\n\nThat's right. Gin can show itself in a near-infinite number of ways. Sure, the foundation botanicals such as juniper will be present, but anything that grows in the ground can go into a gin. Aside botanical choices, there is an increasing number of barrel-aged gins that are on the market. Barrel choices (new, used, ones that held Sherry/Bourbon/wine, etc) further impact the flavor of your gin.\n\nThe funny thing about all of these permutations of gin is that they are generally categorized in two styles.\n\nLondon Dry Gin: All flavorings must be added through redistillation of a neutral grain spirit. If this process is followed in another part of the world outside of London, it will be noted as [insert location here] Dry Gin. Examples: Tanqueray London Dry Gin, Bluecoat American Dry Gin, Bruichladdich The Botanist Scottish Dry Gin.\n\nDistilled Gin: Flavorings may be added after the redistillation process. Examples include Hendrick's and Brockman's.\n\nLet me share with you what we tasted on Friday. I have several here for you that are definitely worth seeking out. Sometimes the best way to get to know gin is to give them a shot. I have given you an idea of what to expect in each one.\n\nAs a result, 12 million liters of product was being distilled in London alone, a city with a population of 600,000 people. Think about that for a minute. There was half a liter of gin for every man, woman, and child (yes, child) to consume each week! Gin took over London in a negative way, with criminal activity, lack of economic growth (since everyone was hammered on gin and not working at their jobs), and overall chaos consuming the city. Gin production was lacking so much in oversight, you had recipes that included alum, sulfuric acid, turpentine! Add a sweetener to disguise the chemicals, and you were in business!\n\nIt took a good forty years to get under control, but in 1761 government regulations made it so that the major distillers were the only ones permitted to produce gin. A dry style, the type we are familiar with today, was developed by the early 1800s. Juniper berries remained a major part of production, but other botanical elements like coriander, angelica, and orris roots became the \"big four\" ingredients in a wheat-based distillate in the modern style of gin. While those four ingredients formed the base of gin, today's distillers have taken some interesting alternative approaches to creating a wide range of examples that have clean flavors and intense aromatics not necessarily dominated by juniper. Citrus peels, berries, cucumbers, rose petals, cinnamon sticks, cardamom...anything from the spice rack could conceivably end up in your gin, much better than discovering turpentine in there!\n\nFor the longest time, I was not a fan of gin. Maybe I was too young the first time I tried it and I wasn't ready for the onslaught of aromatic power. Today, I couldn't be a bigger advocate of gin. Tanqueray, one of the most juniper-forward gins out there and my first sample of the spirit way back when, can be polarizing with its sharpness and piney aromatics. Some of you love it. Others can't stand it, but that leads to a thought that all gin is made in that style. Fortunately for you, the resurgence of this spirit once considered to be the scourge of London has led to some innovation where you can find a level of juniper that agrees with you. Its transparency of flavor is fantastic for cocktails. The martini is a classic (remember...if your martinis have vodka in it, those are \"vodka martinis\"). Gin and tonic with a lemon or lime is a simple way to enjoy it. You can go big with a French 75, where Champagne is involved in the recipe. The huge range of styles of gin as your base material combined with other mixers leads to countless permutations of cocktails. Gin is light and refreshing...perfect for the warm days we have coming up here in the northeast. Hell, if you like your gins neat, you can now find barrel-aged examples, which is a whole other animal to deal with.\n\nIs this a comprehensive guide to gin I just presented you? No, not at all. If I get all the cocktails out there in this post, that's admittedly cutting into our future discussions. Additionally, I will be going into more details on production when I run my Gin 101 course at the Divine Wine Emporium on June 2nd, 7:00pm (how's that for a shameless plug!). I can't give away all my secrets.\n\nBut today, I focus on the other part of my own cultural makeup. That is correct, I am not 100% Italian. My family history also traces back to one of Europe's most popular battlegrounds, Belgium. Yes, Belgium. Outside of my own family, I know of no one else in my social circle who is Belgian, and I love it. The reason for a post about Belgium today is that my one surviving grandparent (my father's mother) just celebrated her 92nd birthday this week. A Belgian native, she came to the U.S. in rather dramatic fashion, being whisked away as a teenager from the perils of World War II by my grandfather. They fell in love, started a family in pre-gentrified Brooklyn, New York, and the rest is history.\n\nThis story compelled me to learn more about this \"Low Country,\" both as a kid and as an adult. I did research projects for grade school on World War II (where my grandmother was an unbelievable resource). I went to Belgian cafes and restaurants; Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia is one that immediately comes to mind as a great place for beers and Belgian cuisine.\n\nHere at Flight School wine is a big part of what we discuss, but wine is not made in any real quantity in Belgium. It is, however, consumed at a rate of about 30L per capita (or three times that of the United States). Perhaps this explains my affinity for adult grape juice, but let's not forget about those delightful Belgian beers.\n\nTrying to describe and pinpoint one style of Belgian beer is nearly impossible, sort of like blanketing \"Italian wine,\" because you have a ton to choose from in the Belgian category. You could find any of the following: Trappist-style and Abbey-style; Blonde, Pale, Strong Pale and Strong Dark; Dubbel, Tripel and Quadrupel; Saison, Lambic, Flemish Sour Brown and Flemish Red...the list goes on. Now I am no authority on such subject matter, but if you need a resource I highly encourage you to visit the Beer Advocate style page. You will get to know all of the differences in styles and see examples from a wide range of producers.\n\nAs for spirits, Gin and fruit liqueurs are what you will typically find here in the United States. Prior to gin, Belgium was producing the predecessor to gin known as Jenever, which a distilled malt wine that has a richer, earthier flavor than gin's refreshing aromatic character. Within the last year, I encountered Belgian gin for the first time...and I couldn't have been happier to have done so.\n\nFrom a food standpoint, mussels cooked in beer are one of my favorites. Sausages, pommes frites, and countless other seafood are delicious, too. You also can't forget about a huge array of chocolate and pastries for dessert.\n\nSo I raise a glass to my grandmother today with some tasty choices for you to try.\n\nSaison Dupont ($10, 750 mL): Golden, citrusy, yeasty, and light-bodied with a touch of hops. An easy one to knock down, and the first Belgian beer I ever tasted."
