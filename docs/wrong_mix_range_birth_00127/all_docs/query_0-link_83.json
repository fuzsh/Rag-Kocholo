Since William was often away on military campaign, beginning in 1690 against the Jacobites in Ireland, Mary administered the government of the realm with the advice of a nine-member cabinet. A devout Anglican, she was more focused on morals and piety than politics – all matters of ecclesiastical patronage passed through her hands. She left administering the government in William’s hands whenever he was at home\n\n1789 – On the balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street in New York City, George Washington takes the oath of office as the first elected President of the United States\n\n1812 – The Territory of Orleans becomes Louisiana, the 18th U.S. state\n\n1838 – Nicaragua declares independence from the Central American Federation\n\n1857 – Eugen Bleuler born, Swiss psychiatrist; pioneer in study of schizophrenics\n\n1859 – A Tale of Two Cities, the novel by Charles Dickens is first published as a serial in a literary magazine\n\n1866 – Mary Haviland Stilwell Kuesel born, American dentist; founder of the Women’s Dental Association of the U.S., with 12 charter members\n\n1870 – Franz Lehar born, Hungarian operetta composer; The Merry Widow\n\n1877 – Alice B. Toklas born, American member of the Parisian avant-garde and self-effacing life partner of Gertrude Stein. She left the U.S. and moved to Paris five months after the devastating 1906 earthquake and fire destroyed most of San Francisco. She met Gertrude Stein on the day she arrived in Paris, September 8, 1907, the beginning of their relationship which lasted until Stein’s death in 1946. They hosted a salon in their home which attracted notable expatriate American writers, and avante-garde European painters. When Stein died in 1945, she willed much of her estate, including her share of the art collection which they acquired together, to Toklas, but their relationship had no legal recognition. The greatly increased value of the paintings caused Stein’s relatives to make a counter-claim, and they removed the artworks from Toklas’ home and placed them in a bank vault while she was away on vacation. After that, Toklas often had to rely on contributions from friends to supplement her income from writing articles for magazines and newspapers. In 1954, she published The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook, which mixed recipes with reminiscences, and became notorious for a recipe for ‘Haschich Fudge’ which was actually from her friend Brion Gysin. A second cookbook in 1958, Aromas and Flavors of Past and Present, was so heavily annotated by editor Poppy Cannon that Toklas did not approve of it. In 1963, she published her autobiography, What is Remembered, ending it abruptly with Gertrude Stein’s death. Her last years were very difficult because of declining health and financial problems. She died in poverty in 1967 at age 89, and is buried next to Stein, with her name engraved on the back of Stein’s headstone\n\nGertrude Stein, Basket the poodle, and Alice B.
