        "text": "Oszkár Asbóth (March 31, 1881 – February 27, 1960) Aviation engineer often credited with the invention of the helicopter. He was a student of Tódor von Kármán, the Father of Supersonic Flight. In 1917, during World War I, Oszkár Asbóth, Tódor von Kármán, István Petróczy and Vilmos Zurovetz worked together on designing the helicopter. After many years of experimentation following the war, he built the Asbóth-helicopter. On September 9, 1928, witnessed by many foreign experts, his model AH 1 helicopter ascended from a standing position vertically to a great height for the first time in the world. Liptrot from the British Air Ministry, who travelled on the helicopter, wrote in a Journal of the Aeronautical Society in 1931: the Asboth-helicopter ascends vertically with a remarkable speed ... to any height where it can to float in air stationary for some time. It can be perfectly navigated and absolutely stable around all axes...\n\nMadeleine Forró Barnóthy (August 21, 1904 – March 1993). Astrophysicist, and pioneer in the study of Cosmic Radiation, Bio-Magnetism and Magnetic Therapy. First Woman to earn a doctorate in physics in Hungary! Barnothy studied in Budapest and Göttingen, Germany. From 1928 to 1948 Madeleine was a physics professor at the Budapest University. In 1948 she settled in the USA with Jenö Barnóthy, her husband and fellow scientist. Barnothy specialized in cosmic radiation, astro and nuclear physics and biomagnetism. She was the author of over 150 scientific papers and editor of the two-volume book Biological Effects of Magnetic Fields (1964). Already in 1964 Dr. Madeleine F. Barnóthy predicted that the magnetic field will in due time develop into a powerful new analytic and therapeutic tool of medicine. She was a member of numerous American and international scientific associations. Forró Barnóthy was a pioneer in the research of the phenomena of cosmic radiation, a prerequisite for conquering the universe.\n\nDonát Bánki (June 6, 1859 – August 1, 1922). He was a Hungarian mechanical engineer and co-inventor of the carburetor and the Bánki-Csonka engine. Until 1893, there had been many problems with the ignition of petrol engines due to uneven mixing of gases. Most devices of the time could not produce the precise mixing proportions. The carburetor invented by Bánki and Csonka immediately eliminated these problems. Bánki and Csonka suggested that the fuel should be atomized into small particles and mixed with air in the right proportion before feeding it into the engine. This was the first carburetor in the world and ever since billions of engines, cars, powerboats, motorcycles and aircraft have used carburetors designed according to Bánki's and Csonka's theory.\n\nLászló Bíró (September 29, 1899 – November 24, 1985) was an Inventor of the modern ballpoint pen. József László Bíró was born in Budapest and died in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He first studied medicine, but between 1921 and 1938, László was a journalist, sculptor, painter, art critic, stock broker, hypnotizer, race-car driver, car salesman and of course an inventor. Biró's most famous invention was the ballpoint pen. By 1938, he had patented it in over 100 countries. Finally in 1948 the Parker Company bought his patent. In the USA it became known as the BIRó PEN. His other important invention was the automatic gear shift In 1932, he traveled with his engineer friend Rigó from Budapest to Berlin (more than 1000 km = 625 mi) on a motorcycle with a sealed gear shift. General Motors bought his patent, just so the competition wouldn't be able to buy it.\n\nIgnác Fülöp Semmelweis (July 1, 1818 – August 13, 1865). He was a physician, called by many in the field of medicine as “the savior of mothers.” Discovered the cause of puerperal (childbed) fever and introduced antisepsis into medical practice. Semmelweis discovered that the incidence of puerperal fever could be drastically cut by the use of hand disinfection in obstetrical clinics. Puerperal fever was common in mid-19th-century hospitals and often fatal, with mortality at 10%–35%. Under these procedures, the mortality rates in the first division dropped from 18.27 to 1.27 percent, and in March and August of 1848 no woman died in childbirth in his division. Some doctors were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands and Semmelweis could offer no acceptable scientific explanation for his findings. Semmelweis's practice earned widespread acceptance only years after his death, when Louis Pasteur confirmed the germ theory.\n\nJózsef Dallos (January 7, 1905 – June 27, 1979) was a physician who invented the \"Living Eye Impression Method\" and developed the First Practical Contact Lenses. Dallos developed a molding technique using Negocol and Hominite - the first method to be used on the living eye to produce a successful contact lens. Dallos invented a glass-molding technique that allowed the lens to take on the characteristics of the sclerotic membrane. He made a copy of the eye’s top layer using a thin copperplate and molded the molten glass over its surface. In 1973, Dallos immigrated to London where he earned worldwide acclaim. George Nissel in London, Dallos’ brother-in-law, produced high quality lenses and Nissel laboratories still exists in England. Dallos was a real pioneer in scleral lenses and was one of the first to recognize and discuss internal or lenticular astigmatism.\n\nKrisztina Egerszegi (Aug. 16, 1974 - ) 5-time Olympic Gold Medalist: \"Greatest Backstroke Swimmer of All Times. She is the Youngest Olympic Champion and only woman to win five gold medals in individual swimming events. Egerszegi was only 14 years old when she competed at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. In 1992, Egerszegi, by now a seasoned 18-year-old, won both backstroke events. She also entered and won the 400m individual medley, recording the fastest time since Petra Schneider's chemically augmented 1982 world record. At the 1996 Atlanta Games, Egerszegi earned a bronze medal in the 400 m and then won the 200m backstroke to become only the second swimmer in history to win the same event three times. In 1996, Egerszegi did not enter the 100m backstroke; however her leadoff backstroke time in the medley relay, 1:01.15, was faster than the winning time in the 100m backstroke final.\n\nZsa Zsa Gábor (February 6, 1917 - ). She is a Hungarian-born American stage, film and television actress. She acted on stage in Vienna, Austria, in 1932, and was crowned Miss Hungary in 1936. She immigrated to the United States in 1941 and became a sought-after actress with \"European flair and style\", with a personality that \"exuded charm and grace\". Her first movie role was as supporting actress in Lovely to Look At. She later acted in We're Not Married! And played one of her few leading roles in Moulin Rouge (1952), directed by John Huston, who described her as a \"creditable\" actress. Besides her film and television appearances, she is best known for having nine husbands, including hotel magnate Conrad Hilton.\n\nPeter Carl Goldmark (December 6, 1906 – December 7, 1977) Engineer and CBS Chief Scientist - Invented the Color Television, 33 1/3 LP Record, and the Electronic Video Recorder. Dr. Goldmark, responsible for over 160 inventions in his storied career, studied at the University of Vienna and from 1931–33 worked for a radio company in England. After immigrating to the United States in 1933, he worked as a construction engineer until joining the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) in 1936. There he developed the first commercial color television system, which used a rotating three-color disk, and announced in 1940 that CBS had a marketable color television and broadcasted in New York. Later, Goldmark would achieve fame for the first electronic video recording system—the forerunner for the VCR in your home today. He became the chief engineer and President of CBS’s Laboratory in 1954. He also developed a scanning system used by the Lunar Orbiter spacecraft in 1966 to transmit photographs to earth from the moon.\n\nAndrew Grove (September 2, 1936 - ). He is a former president/CEO, Chairman of Intel, businessman, engineer, author and a pioneer in the semiconductor industry. Time’s Man of the Year of 1998. At the age of 20, Andy moved to the US from Hungary, where he finished his education. Within five years of graduation, he became CEO of Intel and was a pioneering figure in transforming the company into a giant. In July 1968, Dr. Grove participated in the founding of Intel Corporation. In 1979 he was named Chairman and CEO, and in May 1998 he relinquished his CEO title and remains Chairman of the Board. Dr. Grove has patented several semiconductor technologies and is the author of the book: “Only the Paranoid Survive.”\n\nJános Irinyi (May 18, 1817 – December 17, 1895) was a chemist and inventor of the noiseless and non-explosive match. He acquired his chemical knowledge at the Vienna Polytechnic. During one of his professor's experiments, he solved the puzzle of making silent matches. After long hours of experimentation he patented his invention of silent and non-explosive matches in 1836. In the heads of the matches he mixed phosphor with lead dioxide instead of calcium chlorate. Irinyi sold his invention to a manufacturer of matches and went for a study tour abroad. He was one of the most talented Hungarian chemists. He completely acquired the knowledge of the new chemistry developed in the spirit of A.L. Lavoisier. He contributed significantly to the development of the Hungarian professional terminology in chemistry.\n\nÁnyos Jedlik (January 11, 1800 – December 13, 1895). He was an inventor, engineer, physicist, and Benedictine priest. ányos was also a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and author of several books. He is considered by Hungarians and Slovaks to be the unsung father of the dynamo and the electric motor. In 1827, Jedlik started experimenting with electromagnetic rotating devices which he called lightning-magnetic self-rotor and in 1828 demonstrated the first device. In 1829 he constructed the first rotating machine based on the electromagnetic impulse, which was the predecessor of the DC motor. He lectured at Benedictine schools up to 1839, then for 40 years at the Budapest University of Sciences department of physics-mechanics. He constructed a \"single-pole electric starter\", which exploited the principle of self-ignition. His machine was a unipolar generator with no brushes. With the single pole electric starter, he formulated the concept of the dynamo at least 6 years prior to Siemens and Wheatstone.\n\nSándor Kõrösi Csoma (March 27, 1784 – April 11, 1842) was a linguist and ex-plorer. Studied oriental languages in Göttingen, Germany and set out on foot to Asia, to find the ancient homeland and origins of the Hungarians. During his travels starting in 1819, he reached India through Iran and Afghanistan. He spoke 20 languages and compiled a glossary of 16 European and Oriental languages. Suffering unimaginable privations, he lived and studied in lama monasteries and laid down the foundations of the Tibetan language. He emerged with the world's first Tibetan dictionary (containing 40,000 words) and grammar book which were published in an English edition in 1843. Tragically, on his fourth journey to Tibet, having at last obtained some information about the Yougar people (a race possibly related to the Magyars), he was fatally struck with malaria and died in Darjeeling.\n\nEstée Lauder - (July 1, 1908 – April 24, 2004). Cosmetic Queen! She was a founder of Estee Lauder Companies Inc. This company employs some 10,000 people around the world.

Estée Lauder was born Josephine Esther Mentzer in Queens, New York, to Max and Rose (Schotz Rosenthal). She is a Hungarian immigrant with a French Catholic mother and Jewish father. She grew up in the Corona section of Queens, New Jersey. After 20 years of slow hard work in the cosmetics industry, Estée started her career by selling a face cream made by her Hungarian uncle. Estée later brought out her own Youth Dew scented bath oil, which was an enormous success in the 1950s and 1960s. Innovative, with a talent for adapting, marketing and promotion, she built up an estimated one billion dollar a year business.\n\nFranz Liszt (October 22, 1811 - July 31, 1886). Franz was a renowned composer, pianists, conductor, and teacher. He also established the Hungarian Music Academy. Liszt became famous throughout Europe during the nineteenth century and was remember for his virtuosic skill as a pianist. He was said by his contemporaries to have been the most technically advanced pianist of his age and perhaps the greatest pianist of all time. Franz Liszt was the only contemporary whose music Richard Wagner gratefully acknowledged as an influence upon his own. His lasting fame was an alchemy of extraordinary digital ability -- the greatest in the history of keyboard playing -- an unmatched instinct for showmanship, and one of the most progressive musical imaginations of his time. Hailed by some as a visionary, reviled by others as a symbol of empty Romantic excess, Franz Liszt wrote his name across music history in a truly inimitable manner.\n\nKati Marton (February 3, 1949 - ) is a Hungarian-American author and journalist. Her career has included reporting for ABC News as a foreign correspondent and National Public Radio, where she started as a production assistant 1971 in her 20s, as well as print journalism and writing a number of books.

The highest Catholic official in Hungary convicted of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Communist People's Court. He was a Cardinal and the head of the Roman Catholic Church as the Archbishop of Esztergom in Hungary. He became known as a steadfast supporter of Church freedom and opponent of communism and the brutal Stalinist persecution in his country. As a result, he was tortured and given a life sentence in a 1949 show trial that generated worldwide condemnation, including a United Nations resolution. Freed in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, he was granted political asylum and lived in the U.S. embassy in Budapest for 15 years. He was finally allowed to leave the country in 1971. He died in exile in 1975 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nJohn von Neumann (Dec 28, 1903 - Feb 8, 1957) was a legendary mathematician, physicist, logician, and Computing Pioneer. He is the father of Binary Code and the Stored Program Computer that are the keys for modern computer programming, and game theory. Proposed Implosion and co-developed the Atomic Bomb. He built a solid framework for quantum mechanics, and he played a key role in the development of the U.S. ballistic missile program. He is generally regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians in modern history. Von Neumann was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics, in the development of functional analysis, a principal member of the Manhattan Project and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata, the universal constructor, and the digital computer. Along with Teller and Stanislaw Ulam, von Neumann worked out key steps in nuclear physics involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb.\n\nEszter Pécsi (March 8, 1898 – May 4, 1975) Structural Engineer - designer of the first reinforced-concrete skyscraper! She was a First woman who received a degree in engineering in Hungary (1920). Eszter Pecsi prepared the structural design for the indoor swimming pool on St. Margit Island (Budapest, Hungary), and the first iron-framed tall building of Budapest, the Hospital on Fiume út. In 1957 she fled Hungary and worked in Vienna, Austria for a year where she designed the city's first multi-level parking garage. From 1958 she lived and worked in New York. She was the structural designer of the first reinforced-concrete skyscraper (Hotel Americana) and two skyscrapers erected for the professors of Columbia University. For these three works, Pécsi received the year's best structural engineering design award from New York City. She developed a special method to prepare the site of the foundation for the skyscrapers along the Hudson River, for which she was named the best structural engineer of the year.\n\nZsuzsa (Susan), Judit (Judith), and Zsófia (Sofia) Polgár. The sisters are Chess Grand Masters and Olympic Gold Medalists. Judith has been called the Greatest Female Player of all Time! By the early 1980s, the Polgar chess factory had stepped up its output. Susan's two younger sisters, Zsofia and Judit, were next on the genius assembly line and in a few years the family would be ready to take the world of chess by storm. At fifteen, Susan was already the top-ranked female player in the world. At the 1985 New York Open, she caused a sensation by beating a grand master for the first time. By 1989, twelve year old Judit had a winning streak of eight competitions in a row and, at fourteen; Zsofia annihilated four grand masters for one of the greatest tournament results of all time. Susan is still a powerful presence at the chessboard.\n\nMiklos Porkolab (March 24, 1939 - ), Professor and Director of Plasma Science and Fusion Center at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) Department of Physics. Researcher in controlled fusion research, radio frequency heating of plasma, experimental studies of plasma turbulence, and basic plasma physics, including magnetic reconnection.

Jessica excelled at all sports. As a high school athlete she competed in hockey, baseball, football, soccer, track and swimming. She was twice voted her school's athlete of the year. She began working at 13, and, with trouble at home, moved out at 15 and struggled at school. She was introduced to boxing at the age of 17. Here too she excelled. Shortly after starting her training, she fought competitively for the first time in the Ontario Championships and won the gold medal. She went pro two years later. She is the 1 ranked boxers in the world in her weight class.\n\nIgnác Fülöp Semmelweis (July 1, 1818 – August 13, 1865). He was a physician, called by many in the field of medicine as “the savior of mothers.” Discovered the cause of puerperal (childbed) fever and introduced antisepsis into medical practice. Semmelweis discovered that the incidence of puerperal fever could be drastically cut by the use of hand disinfection in obstetrical clinics. Puerperal fever was common in mid-19th-century hospitals and often fatal, with mortality at 10%–35%. Under these procedures, the mortality rates in the first division dropped from 18.27 to 1.27 percent, and in March and August of 1848 no woman died in childbirth in his division. Some doctors were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands and Semmelweis could offer no acceptable scientific explanation for his findings. Semmelweis's practice earned widespread acceptance only years after his death, when Louis Pasteur confirmed the germ theory.\n\nLili Steinschneider (January 13, 1891 – March 28, 1975). She was the first woman pilot of Hungary and, at the same time, of the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy. She decided to become a pilot at the international aviation contest which took place in Budapest during the summer of 1910. She studied aviation at Wienerneustadt. She received the Nr. 4 Aviation certificate on August 15, 1912. She was immediately hired by an Austrian aviation firm. She took part in various domestic and Austrian aviation contest and parades. Lili got married in 1914 and moved to her husband's residence in Czechia (Czech Republic). She lived a secluded life in the aftermath of Second World War in the South of France.\n\nLeo Szilárd (February 11, 1898 – May 30, 1964). Physicist, biologist, co-developed the Atomic Bomb, patented the nuclear reactor, catalyst of the Manhattan Project. He was born in Budapest under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and died in La Jolla, California. Szilard first realized the potential use of nuclear fission in an atomic bomb, and worked with Fermi on the first nuclear reaction. His other ideas included the electron microscope, cyclotron, and linear accelerator. As an inventor, he even had numerous joint patents with Einstein. He proposed the term \"breeder\" to describe a nuclear reactor and holds a joint 1955 US patent on the nuclear reactor with Enrico Fermi. In the spring of 1945, Szilard influenced a group of scientists to produce the Franck Report, which outlined the dangers of a nuclear arms race. The report advised against the use of an atomic bomb against Japanese civilians, advocating instead a non-combat demonstration.\n\nMária Telkes (December 12, 1900 – December 2, 1996) a Hungarian-American physical chemist and engineer, she designed the first residential solar heating system. Developed the first thermoelectric power generator and thermoelectric refrigerator. A Pioneer of Solar Energy: \"Mother of the Solar Home,\" The \"Sun Queen,\" and world's most famous woman inventor in solar energy. Telkes is known for creating the first thermoelectric power generator in 1947 and the first thermoelectric refrigerator in 1953 using the principles of semiconductor thermoelectricity. She received the first Achievement award ever given by the Society of Women Engineers. In 1952 during her tenure at MIT, Maria was for her meritorious contributions to the utilization of solar energy. In addition, Dr. Telkes became known as one of the pioneers of solar energy usage when she received the Charles Greeley Abbot Award.\n\nEdward Teller (January 15, 1908 – September 9, 2003). He was a Nuclear physicist and key scientist in the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. After attending schools in Budapest, Dr. Teller earned a degree in chemical engineering at the Institute of Technology in Karlsruhe. He then went to Munich and Leipzig to earn a Ph.D. in physical chemistry (1930). In 1935 Teller and his bride, went to the United States, where he taught at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Doctor Teller became a US citizen and joined Enrico Fermi’s team at the University of Chicago. Teller resolved to devote his energies to developing nuclear weapons. He was a member of the Manhattan Project scientific team, and took part in developing the nuclear chain reaction and the first atomic bomb. Dr. Teller was also known as the father of the hydrogen bomb (1952. He had an important part in the development of submarine torpe-does and the formulation of Star Wars (the United States missile defense system). Teller is strongly anticommunist and his scientific work regarding nuclear explosives significantly contributed to the United States’ peaceful victory of the Cold War.\n\nEugene Wigner (November 17, 1902 – January 1, 1995) was a Hungarian-American theoretical physicist and mathematician. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 \"for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles\" A graduate of the Technical University of Berlin, Wigner worked as an assistant to Karl Weissenberg and Richard Becker at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and David Hilbert at the University of Göttingen. Wigner and Hermann Weyl were responsible for introducing group theory into physics, particularly the theory of symmetry in physics. Along the way he performed ground-breaking work in pure mathematics, in which he authored a number of mathematical theorems. In particular, Wigner's theorem is a cornerstone in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. He is also known for his research into the structure of the atomic nucleus. In 1930, Princeton University recruited Wigner, along with John von Neumann, and he moved to the United States.\n\nWigner participated in a meeting with Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein that resulted in the Einstein-Szilard letter, which prompted President Franklin D. Roosevelt to initiate the Manhattan Project to develop atomic bombs. Wigner was afraid that the German nuclear weapon project would develop an atomic bomb first. During the Manhattan Project, he led a team whose task was to design nuclear reactors to convert uranium into weapons grade plutonium. At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. Wigner was disappointed that DuPont was given responsibility for the detailed design of the reactors, not just their construction. He became Director of Research and Development at the Clinton Laboratory (now the Oak Ridge National Laboratory) in early 1946, but became frustrated with bureaucratic interference by the Atomic Energy Commission, and returned to Princeton.\n\nIn the postwar period he served on a number of government bodies, including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964.\n\nIn later life, he became more philosophical, and published The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, his best-known work outside technical mathematics and physics."
