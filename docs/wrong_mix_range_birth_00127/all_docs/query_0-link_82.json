        "text": "BBC Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills\n\nBBC Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills is heading to Edinburgh to sample the biggest arts festival in the world – The Edinburgh Fringe Festival – and, while he's there with his team, they are putting on their very own musical.\n\nScott Mills – The Musical started out as an on-air joke in Scott's show and, after gaining lots of interest from listeners, producing a stage musical became a scary reality for Scott and his team. Listeners have been getting involved by sending in story ideas, plot lines and songs to help bring the show to life. This week will see the end product debut as one of 2,098 shows taking place at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nScott himself will be starring in the show under various guises, but the main role of Scott will be played by amateur actor Joe Taylor – who won the show's very own talent competition, Search For A Scott. With songs like My Pinot Grigio and R.A.D.I.O, time will tell if the show will be a hit or a miss with Edinburgh's theatre-goers.\n\nScott's radio show broadcasts live from the Pleasance Courtyard, in Edinburgh, each day from 4-7pm, and there are also highlights from this year's Fringe, special guests and the best and worst bits of their own stage production.\n\nPresenter/Scott Mills\n\nBBC Radio 1 Publicity\n\nNigel Ogden brings listeners a programme of popular organ recordings this evening, with some entertaining pieces from the organ world.\n\nIt's the time of year when the seaside beckons and tonight's programme has a very definite nautical flavour, with Sousa's great march, Hands Across The Sea; an arrangement of Under The Sea from the Disney classic The Little Mermaid; and part of The Fantasia On British Sea Songs by the founder of the BBC Proms Concerts, Sir Henry Wood.\n\nPresenter/Nigel Ogden, Producer/Helen Chetwynd\n\nBBC Radio 2 Publicity\n\nTo top\n\nModel and actress Jerry Hall\n\nAs a prelude to the Edinburgh Comedy Festival, Jerry Hall enlists the help of comedians to highlight the importance of laughter in our lives and examine the psychology and physiology of laughter to determine how and why we laugh, what makes us laugh and why it is one of our basic human needs.\n\nThe Art Of Laughter is an insightful exploration of the art of making people laugh, featuring a host of guests who live and breathe comedy. Contributors include David Walliams, Matt Lucas, Stephen Fry, Richard Curtis, Lenny Henry, Ross Noble, Frank Skinner, Jo Brand, John Cleese, Richard E Grant, Shazia Mirza, Reginald D Hunter, Ian La Frenais, Dr Oliver Double and Professor Mark Van Vugt.\n\nBy studying comedy styles such as sarcasm, satire and slapstick, through to popular and high-brow comedy, Jerry examines the neurological effect laughter has on our nervous system and moods and explains how laughter really can heal the body and mind. No matter what makes you laugh, the most important thing is to laugh as much and as often as possible.\n\nJerry returns to BBC Radio 2 with this hour-long documentary after previously exploring the topic of love in Aspects Of Love, which aired on Valentine's Day last year.\n\nPresenter/Jerry Hall, Producers/Des Shaw and Jerry Hall\n\nBBC Radio 2 Publicity\n\nTo top\n\nMarc Riley unleashes an archive nugget from 1993 this week – the year in which Bill Clinton succeeded George HW Bush as the 42nd President of the United States; tennis star Monica Seles was stabbed in the back by an obsessed Steffi Graf fan; and Benazir Bhutto became the first elected woman to lead a post-colonial Muslim state in Pakistan.\n\nIn July of 1993, rock god Ian Gillan agreed to an interview with Claire Sturgess for BBC Radio 1. In his typical entertaining style, Gillan talks about his year with Black Sabbath and how they inspired much of the film Spinal Tap. He also reveals how he took to the rock 'n' roll lifestyle and his legendary, long-running feud with Deep Purple band mate, Ritchie Blackmore.\n\nPresenter/Marc Riley, Producer/Ian Callaghan\n\nBBC Radio 2 Publicity\n\nStephen Fry returns to bring listeners more delights in different aspects of the English language, in this new, three-part series.\n\n\"Some people feel actual pain at an infinitive split or someone using 'disinterested' when some say they should be saying 'uninterested',\" says Stephen. \"But the pain is just a symptom of the way language is changing. Language changes because people change the way it's used – there's nothing we can do about it. One day, nobody will care about the split infinitive. The only way to deal with the pain is to reflect that you always hurt the one you love. And the one you love, in this case the English language, can hurt you.\"\n\nIn today's opener, So Wrong It's Right, Stephen examines how \"wrong\" English can become \"right\" English. For example, nowadays, more people use the word \"wireless\" in a computer context than in a radio one. With help from a lexicographer, an educationalist, a Times sub-editor and a judge, Stephen looks at the way usage changes language. He applauds the council leader who claimed the services provided by her local authority should be seen as strawberry-flavoured and castigates attempts at banning government jargon like step change and synergie. Banning words is fruitless – he favours blue sky thinking and strawberry flavouring.\n\nPresenter/Stephen Fry, Producers/Nick Baker and Ian Gardhouse\n\nBBC Radio 4 Publicity\n\nTo top\n\nArt, manuscript and antiquarian book dealer Rick Gekoski tells the story behind five missing art works – including a painting, a book, a poem and some Mesopotamian artefacts – in a new series of Lost, Stolen Or Shredded. Rick investigates what happened to them, why were they lost, stolen or shredded and whether they can ever be replaced.\n\nToday's opening programme sees Rick examine the poem Et tu Healey, written by the nine-year-old James Joyce to protest the death of Parnell. It was printed as a broadside in an edition of 30 or 40 copies by his proud father, who even sent one to the Pope. As such, it counts as the first \"book\" of the most famous writer of the 20th century – but no copy has ever been found. Whilst there is plenty of evidence that it did indeed exist, Rick explores where one might be and how much it would be worth if one could be found.\n\nThis fascinating series not only presents missing works of art and the stories that lie behind them, but it also provides an insight into the cultural and social conditions in which they were born.\n\nPresenter/Rick Gekoski, Producer/Angela Hind\n\nBBC Radio 4 Publicity\n\nTo top\n\nThe Winchester Troper is a tiny book belonging to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and written in Winchester around the year 1030.\n\nWith the help of Professor Susan Rankin and the French performer Dominique Vellard, Francis Fyfield tells the story of the Troper and how scholars have used it to clarify the way musical notation developed in the 11th and 12th centuries.\n\nFrancis also tries to unpick the hidden codes of The Winchester Troper, which might prove that the English were pioneers of musical notation.\n\nMany people did not think that that polyphony – the use of two-part harmony – existed before the 13th century. But the discovery in the Troper was that polyphony was actually captured by the cantor scribbling in the Toper at a time when Winchester was at the heart of Anglo Saxon culture.\n\nThe programme describes the process of unravelling the musical language and how that fits in to the broader story of the development of musical notation in Europe.\n\nPresenter/Francis Fyfield, Producer/Tom Alban\n\nBBC Radio 4 Publicity\n\nTo top\n\nThree men, led by IT worker Mike, decide to stage an illegal, large-scale firework display in a bid to provoke some, or any kind of, response from the world and to deliver a message that says: \"We don't have to take it anymore\".\n\nToday's Afternoon Play offering, written by Adrian Penketh, sees the men infiltrate Battersea Power Station and launch pyrotechnic flowers high into the sky above London – from the chimneys of one of the capital's iconic landmarks.\n\nMike has been inspired by clandestine French \"cultural guerrillas\", the UnterGunther. If they pull it off, he will have struck a blow for the little man – and maybe also found a way to break out of the dullness of his career and his marriage to Kate. But will his co-conspirators, Steve and Will, help get the spark back in his life?\n\nProducer/Toby Swift\n\nBBC Radio 4 Publicity\n\nTo top\n\nForeign Secretary David Miliband\n\nMatthew Parris challenges Foreign Secretary David Miliband to argue the case for his hero, Joe Slovo – the Jewish barrister who became a leading member of the ANC – as this new series of Great Lives continues.\n\nPresenter/Matthew Parris, Producer/Miles Warde\n\nBBC Radio 4 Publicity"
