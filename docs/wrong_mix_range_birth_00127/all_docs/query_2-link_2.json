        "text": "Monica Seles (born December 2, 1973, Novi Sad, Yugoslavia [now in Serbia]) is a Yugoslavian-born retired American professional tennis player who dominated her sport and was nearly unbeatable during the height of her career in the early 1990s. In 1991, at the age of 17, Seles became the youngest singles player ever to be ranked number one in the world by the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA). Early in her career Seles became famous for her very loud grunts and shrieks as well as for her immensely powerful two-handed forehand and backhand. During a tournament in Hamburg in 1993, Seles was stabbed in the back by a spectator who later identified himself as a fan of Seles’s German rival Steffi Graf. Forced into a hiatus from tennis, Seles spent the next two and a half years recovering physically and emotionally from her injury.\n\nCoached by her father, Seles began playing tennis when she was 5 years old. She won the Yugoslav 12-and-under girls’ championship at age 9 and the European 12-and-under championship at age 10. In 1985, at age 11, she won the Junior Orange Bowl International Tennis Championship in Miami. Her victory prompted her family to move from Yugoslavia to the United States the next year so that she could attend the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy (now IMG Academy) in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nSeles turned professional in 1989, at age 15, and won her first Grand Slam title, at the French Open, just one year later. She was the youngest player to win a Grand Slam event since Charlotte (“Lottie”) Dod won the ladies’ singles title at Wimbledon in 1887, at age 15. After displacing the long-reigning Steffi Graf as the top-ranked women’s tennis player on March 11, 1991, Seles maintained her standing for most of the next two years, relinquishing the number-one spot to Graf for only a few weeks in 1991.\n\nDuring a water break and changeover (a regular change of sides) at a match in Hamburg on April 30, 1993, a 38-year-old spectator, Günter Parche, stabbed Seles between her shoulder blades with a 9-inch (23-cm) kitchen knife. If Seles had not leaned forward to take a sip of water at the moment of the attack, she probably would have been paralyzed, according to the doctors who treated her. The knife damaged Seles’s muscles but missed her spine and vital organs. Although Parche admitted that his attack was premeditated, he was given a two-year suspended sentence and was released from prison about six months after the attack. Seles underwent surgery in a hospital and was soon released, but the back pain resulting from her injury persisted for many months. She was also traumatized by the sudden collapse of her tennis career, to which she had dedicated her entire life. She underwent treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but still experienced severe depression and eventually developed a binge eating disorder."
