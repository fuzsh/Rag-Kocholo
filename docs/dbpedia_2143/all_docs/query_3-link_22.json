For one thing I’m a sucker for baseball movies. For another it was a great introduction to Chadwick Boseman, who shines as Jackie Robinson. And for a third thing, it is a career best film for Harrison Ford who fucking shines as Branch Rickey. In all honesty if this film had been released in November instead of April he probably would’ve been nominated for an Oscar in the Best Supporting Actor category. THAT’s how good he is, but the Oscars are weird that way. Also if you’re itching for a baseball movie double feature, I suggest you watch A League of Their Own followed by this because A League of Their Own focuses on women’s baseball during WW2 and this focuses on major league baseball after WW2.\n\n2) You’re going to read these words a lot during this post: fucking racism man.\n\n3)\n\nBranch Rickey: “Dollars aren’t black and white, they’re green.”\n\nFor any Hollywood exec who believes diversity doesn’t sell based on some outdated philosophy, remember this line.\n\n4) Chadwick Boseman is incredible in this film.\n\nThis might be Boseman’s finest performance to date. He plays the role with nothing but honesty. There’s no ego to it, there’s no larger than life persona, he’s just a ball player. That’s how Robinson is portrayed: he has no desire to be a hero, he has no desire to be better than the others, he just wants to be the ball player. Boseman plays that magnificently, and in all honesty he’s just interesting to watch. I usually don’t use this phrase because it’s a little cliche but he does have that, “x factor.” There’s just something about his charisma and his energy that is interesting to watch, and he puts that towards a subtle and layered performance. And - as I said before - he’s just honest! The best performances and the best acting is when the characters are performed truly and honestly.\n\n5) Also after the line above Branch Rickey’s reply is great:\n\n(GIF originally posted by @chadwishboseman)\n\nIt would be easy to label this movie as a white savior film, and it would be easy for it to BE a white savior film. Except, here’s the thing: Branch Rickey is not saving Jackie Robinson in any way shape or form. He brings Robinson on because he’s a good baseball player and because he knows by integrating major league baseball will bring him money. He just doesn’t have a discriminatory bone in his body, and he knows the racism of the other major league baseball is causing them to ignore a major asset. Read the quote in #3 again if you don’t believe me. Branch Rickey is not a savior, he’s a businessman. He doesn’t see Jackie as someone who should be grateful to him for saving him, he looks at him as a ball player who he wants on his team. I love that.\n\n6)\n\nJackie [after this, “guts,” exchange]: “You give me a uniform, you give me a number on my back...and I’ll give you the guts.”\n\nThat is a great line.\n\n7) Holy shit it’s Abbie Mills!\n\nI had no idea Nicole Beharie played Rachel Robinson! And you know , after watching 24 Bond films, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the kinda one note if well acted female characters in the two Jump Street movies, I was pleasantly surprised by how developed Rachel Robinson is.\n\nShe’s no Furiosa, but also this is not her story it is Jackie’s story and she’s a supporting character. A lot of writers use that as an excuse to not develop the wife character, but not Brian Hegeland. She is developed just as nicely and just as deeply as she should be - she gets less development then say Jackie and Branch Rickey, but she’s more developed then all the other characters in the film. Sometimes a female character is just a supporting character and if they’re not developed to the point of what a main female character would be that’s not bad. But that is no excuse to be lazy, and the writing on Rachel Robinson is not lazy. And it’s not that hard either! You just have to put your character in unique situations and show how THEY react as a person. Not as a gender, not as a skin color, not as a supporting character, as an individual. For example, the first time I thought, “wow, they actually care about developing her,” was this:\n\nRachel says she’s never seen a, “whites only,” bathroom before AND USES IT IN DEFIANCE OF RACISM!\n\nAlthough she does got punished for it by getting her and Jackie kicked off the plane by the airline attendant who saw her use the bathroom (fucking racism...). I’ll be bringing up more moments when Rachel is developed as I get deeper into the recap.\n\nAlso Beharie and Boseman have incredible chemistry. Again, I use the word honest. They’re honestly in love with each other. It’s amazing.\n\n8) This exchange between Rickey and the manager of the Montreal Royals though at Jackie’s spring training.\n\n[Jackie makes an amazing catch in the field]\n\nBranch: “Practically superhuman.”\n\nClay (the manager): “(Chuckles) Superhuman? Don’t get carried away Mr. Rickey. That’s still a n***** out there.”\n\nBranch: Clay I realize that attitude is part of your cultural heritage that you practically nursed race prejudice from your mother’s breasts so I’ll let that go. But I will tell you this: you will either manage Robinson fairly and correctly or you sir can be unemployed.\n\nAnd after Branch sets Clay straight, he does just that. He manages Jackie fairly and correctly. But this goes to how Rickey isn’t a hero: he’s not asking Clay to save Jackie from racism, he’s not asking to make sure he’s on the field all the time or get special treatment. He is asking for Clay to treat Jackie fairly and correctly. I love that.\n\n9) Hey, remember how I said Rachel Robinson was developed pretty nicely?\n\nRachel [to a friend while crowds at a Montreal spring training game boo Jackie]: “Jack’s got a thick skin, he’ll be ok.”\n\nWendell (the friend): “What about you?”\n\nRachel: “I’ll get one fast.”\n\nThis shows - in a very small but very key way - that Rachel is tough but not immune. The racism does get to her but she knows it’s their fucked up prejudices and not anything she should be ashamed of. THIS DOES NOT MAKE IT BETTER, but it means - since she’s tough - she will come to ignore it.\n\nAgain, just a small way Rachel is developed more than you’re typical supporting wife character.\n\n10) So during this same game I made a note that Jackie stealing all the bases is wildly entertaining, and that’s something this movie does well that some biopics don’t: it is entertaining to watch. It is fun. It’s enjoyable, even if it does get heavy! You walk away having had a good time.\n\n11) I basically made three or five notes at this point about various scenes with the words, “fucking racism,” but if I went through them all this recap would take forever. Just let’s all agree racism sucks.\n\n12) Bonus though, you get a random white guy on the street walking up to Jackie and his wife letting him know that a lot of people are rooting for him. I don’t have any numbers to prove this, but I wouldn’t be surprised if throughout history racism was often a loud minority. Not most, but often.\n\n13) Jackie’s excitement about making the Montreal Royals is spectacular:\n\nAlso I love Chadwick Boseman’s smile. It all just gets to how - more than anything else - Jackie Robinson is just a guy who wants to play baseball for a living. To me, the real heroes in life never identify as such. The real heroes are people just trying their best everyday to be the best they can be. Jackie Robinson is that.\n\n14) I think now is a good moment to tell you all Mark Isham’s score in this film is top notch. If you watch, “Once Upon a Time,” he’s the composer for that show. Give it a listen if you can. Especially the piece of score, “Jackie Robinson,” he composed for the film.\n\n15) Leo.\n\nWe don’t get much of Christopher Meloni as the manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Leo, but what we do is nice. He’s like Branch in a lot of ways: he’s not a savior, he doesn’t give two shits about Jackie’s skin color either way, he just wants to win. “I’d play an elephant if it’d help us win,” he says to Branch at one point. And when he learns some of his players have drafted a petition (SOME) to not play with Jackie he calls them all done and shouts at them, “I don’t care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a zebra,” he plays if he’s good. (In reality Leo said, “like a fucking zebra,” but this movie is PG-13.) Unfortunately Leo gets suspended before Jackie makes the Brooklyn Dodgers, but it just goes to show that there are no heroes in this movie. Just normal people who are decent enough not to give a fuck about skin color. And then, assholes like Ben Chapman (but more on him later).\n\n16) The scene where Clay teaches Jackie how to play first base is very interesting. It’s cut with scenes of some Dodgers trying to keep him off their team, but every time we cut back to him he keeps getting better and better because (as Clay puts it) he has to be, “so good the Dodgers want [him] on their team.” I just found it very compelling.\n\n17) I love Lucas Black as Pee-Wee Reese in this film, although he’s not developed too much.\n\nHe should be the MOST threatened by Jackie, they both play short stop but he is just like Leo. If he’s good enough to play, he should play. There’s also a nice scene later in the film where Pee Wee is very important (and it’s probably one of the best scenes in the film) but more on that later.\n\n18) Holy shit, Hamish Linklater is in this movie.\n\nMan, that guy just shows up in the most unexpected places.\n\n19) This line from Jackie is very important for his characterization.\n\nJackie [to Wendell]: “I don’t like needing someone to be there for me.”\n\nJackie wants to be able to handle himself, he thinks a need for help is a sign of weakness but the whole point of baseball is that you are on a TEAM. You NEED other people otherwise it’s just you on the field. That is what Jackie learns throughout this film: it’s okay to need someone.\n\n20) At one point Branch Rickey exclaims, “Judas Priest,” and those who know him best say that this was the most profane thing he ever said. Apparently the movie took liberties because later he calls someone as, “son of a bitch.”\n\n21) Holy shit John C. McGinley is in this movie!\n\nThis guy needs a better agent. He’s fucking hysterical, although he does get to flex some nice comedic muscles in this film as the Dodgers announcer.\n\nAnnouncer: “Jackie is very definitely a brunette.”\n\nWe need more John C. McGinley in the world.\n\n22) In all honesty, I’m surprised it took this film 68 minutes to show off an ump making a bogus call on Jackie because of racism. It still happens but with all the baseball we saw before this game I thought it’d be sooner.\n\n23)\n\n[A reporter in the press box says black men are so good at baseball because they naturally have a longer heel bone. Jackie then hits a home run straight out of the park.]\n\nA different reporter: “Was that because his heel bone was longer?”\n\n24) Mother. Fucking. Ben. Chapman.\n\nI can not explain how truly horrible this scene is as accurately as watching it here will. But be warned: there is strong language and horrific racial slurs. Having said that, here’s the link.\n\nBasically earlier in this film Branch Rickey told Jackie that because of the racism of the public he can’t give in. If someone goads him into a fight and he fights, they’ll say he’s in over his head. Well Alan Tudyk’s Ben Chapman - in a scene depicting what actually happened - is the personification of that idea. Whenever Jackie’s at the point he taunts him with the repeated use of the word, “n*****,” calling him, “monkey,” and other things. He’s awful, he’s horrific, and he makes me sick but that’s what he’s supposed to do! The scene is excellent in accomplishing what it wants (as in: making you hate Ben Chapman) but man does it make you hate this guy. And Alan Tudyk - who I love wholeheartedly - does an excellent job of making you hate Ben Chapman.\n\nJackie does not strike against Chapman, but Chapman does get in his head. Jackie hits a lot of fly balls which are easily catchable. After his second time at bat he walks away into a tunnel and has an epic freak out. I highly recommend you watch the scene where Jackie breaks down under the racism Chapman is swinging at him. It’s in the video above and starts at one minute and fifty five seconds.\n\nIt shows why Chadwick Boseman is a great actor, but it also shows off Harrison Ford’s acting ability and the chemistry they have with each other. It also shows off why this is not a white savior story: Branch Rickey cannot save Jackie from this, he can’t! And he can’t save Jackie from hitting Chapman, from striking the racist asshat in the field, only Jackie can do that. Jackie makes it in the major leagues on his own merits as a player and as a man, and Rickey just tries (to the best of his ability) to make sure he gets fair treatment. Not special treatment, FAIR treatment.\n\nExtra note: holy shit, I just noticed that 95% of the scene between Branch and Jackie is one shot save for the very beginning and the very end. This means that the actors couldn’t mess up then jump back in in the middle, they had to do it at least once straight through this brilliantly. For a stage actor that’s normal, for a film actor that’s a challenge.\n\n25) Also after the scene with Jackie and Branch he comes back out and Chapman keeps at him, only for one of his teammates to come out and tell Branch off in an amazing way. I suggest watching it. If you don’t, enjoy this tell off.\n\nChapman: “Hey Stank! What’s it like being a n*****’s n*****?”\n\nStank: “I don’t know, Chapman. What’s it like being a redneck son of a bitch?”\n\n(GIF originally posted by @rocktheholygrail)\n\n26) So much later Chapman gets called out for his shit and wants to talk a picture with Jackie Robinson so the Phillies can save face in the media. The exchange Jackie has with Branch’s right hand man - Earl - when he comes to tell him this is great.\n\nJackie: “Have you been drinkin’ Earl?”\n\nEarl: “No, no...I wish...”\n\n27) At the photo shoot with Chapman.\n\nJackie: “We’ll use a bat. That way we don’t have to touch skin.”\n\nI always felt that was as much as Jackie saying, “don’t touch me you racist sack of shit,” as much as, “I know you don’t want to touch me because you’re a racist sack of shit.”\n\n28) So Jackie gets nailed in the head by the pitcher of the Pittsburgh Pirates and his team goes out to kick the crap out of the other team (which is awesome in and of itself) but we also see Rachel afterwards crying. This develops her again: we now know what her breaking point is in all this. It’s physical harm coming to those she loves.\n\n29) This is an excellent Pee-Wee Reese scene. The Dodgers are going to play in Cincinnati, close to his hometown, and he gets a threatening letter. He takes this to Branch Rickey, who proceeds to show Pee Wee all the threatening letters Jackie gets:\n\nThree fucking folders, threatening him, his wife, and his baby boy. The FBI knows about it. This sets up what is probably the key scene in the whole film:\n\n30) In Cincinnati we see a young boy who is super excited about seeing Pee Wee Reese at the game with his dad, and he just loves that Pee Wee is there. He’s filled with such pure love of baseball and his idol that it’s infectious.\n\nThen Jackie runs out and everyone - including his father - starts shouting racist slurs at him.\n\nThe kid doesn’t know what’s going on, he doesn’t know why everyone hates this ball player, why these people - even his father - are filled with such hate. But they are, and his father is setting an example for him. So what does he do?\n\nHe joins in. Not because he believes in it, not because he is racist or actually hates Jackie, but because his dad is doing it.\n\nDid I say the Ben Chapman scene was the most horrific one in this film? I’m wrong: this one is. It will break your heart and make you sick all at while pissing you off at the same time. Because this is why we still have racists in this country today: they learn from example.\n\nBut then this scene goes down between Pee Wee - the hometown hero - and Jackie. Pee Wee goes out, tell Jackie they can scream all he wants, but he’s here to stay. And then Pee Wee shows he supports Jackie in the most obvious way for all those racists assholes in the stands.\n\nAnd then that kid, who shouted, “n*****,” because his father was, who loves Pee Wee Reese and just showed such unadulterated hate towards Jackie Robinson, that kid just sits there as his hero supports Jackie and looks like this:\n\nTHAT is how the cycle is broken, and I want to take the time to say this. If any of you are growing up in a household where racism or sexism or homophobia or any under bias is common and you are unsure if those biases are right...remember the look on that kid’s face. They are not. Stick to your guns, treat people based on their actions towards other people alone and not on how they were born. And if you’re parents are pressuring you into a biased way of thought, remember two things. 1) This kid’s face. 2) When you’re of age you can get out from under them and form your own world views.\n\n31) So Hamish Linklater’s character tries to encourage Jackie to shower with the other teammates, and even when he’s got about ten minutes of screen time he has one of the funniest moments.\n\nLinklater’s Character: “Come take a shower with me Jackie.”\n\nAwkward silence before Linklater tries to save face.\n\nIt’s a nice moment.\n\n32) Jackie gets his heel run over by a baseman and his teammates come to his aid, planning on hitting the next player in the head. Jackie tells them not to do that and instead they have him help him up. I love that moment, it’s so big of him and it shows him 1) how his teammates are over the fact that he’s black and 2) how he know is okay that he needs people. He needs them to help him up. You can watch it right here.\n\nBranch: “Their was something unfair at the heart of the game I loved, and I ignored it.”\n\nSo Branch is trying to be a savior. It’s just he’s not trying to save Jackie, he’s trying to save baseball. And Jackie’s how he’s doing it.\n\n34) The final thing which develops Rachel in a little but nice way: she knows baseball!\n\nShe gives Jackie tips on how to run in his next game. She’s not the clueless woman who doesn’t get sports. SHE. KNOWS. BASEBALL.\n\nIt’s just a little bit of development but it’s enough to both make her a realistic character and also set her apart from an array of undeveloped supporting girlfriends and wives in movies. Kudos to this film for doing that!\n\n35) The final scene in this film - the final game - when Jackie Robinson hits a home run and is coming into home will fill you with such a sense of satisfaction and joy that you will be glad you sat down and watched it.\n\nWendell: “Robinson rounds third, heading for home sweet home.”\n\nBonus: You know how after a biopic ends you get the text telling you what happened to the real life people afterwards? Well here’s a final piece of text that makes you’ll feel very good.\n\n“In 1948 Ben Chapman was fired and never worked in baseball again.”\n\n(GIF source unknown [if this is your GIF please let me know].)\n\nIf you don’t like baseball films, you will still like this film. The drama is not derived from, “will we win the pennant,” or, “we have to get ready for this game.” Those are all almost afterthoughts, because the drama of the film is based on the trials and tribulations Jackie has to go through just to do what he loves. It’s rounded out by excellent performances and great writing, with very nice cinematography and a great score to boot. The fourth of july is coming up, and if you’re looking for an alternative to Independence Day and Forrest Gump and The Patriot and Born on the Fourth of July or any of the other standard movies for American Independence Day I highly suggest 42."
