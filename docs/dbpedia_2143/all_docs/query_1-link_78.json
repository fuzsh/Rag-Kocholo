        "text": "The playwright and actor John Chapman, who has died aged 74, was the complete professional - inventive, witty and methodical. His writing work spanned half a century, beginning in the 1950s with such farces for the Whitehall theatre as Dry Rot (1954) and Simple Spymen (1958); it also took in television and film, while his latest work, Deadlier Than The Male, a collaboration with Jeremy Lloyd, will open next spring.\n\nTogether, he and I co-wrote four West End comedies from the late 1960s into the 1970s. These were Not Now Darling (1967), Move Over Mrs Markham (1969), My Giddy Aunt (1968) and There Goes the Bride (1973). During thousands of hours of writing, rewriting, rewriting again, rehearsing, and yet more rewriting, we never had a single cross word, not even a moment's disagreement.\n\nJohn was also a hugely successful television writer, with more than 200 comedies to his credit, including Hugh And I (1962-68), with Terry Scott and Hugh Lloyd, the 1967 adaptation of PG Wodehouse's Blandings Castle for Sir Ralph Richardson, work with Carla Lane on The Liver Birds and, from 1984 to 1986, Fresh Fields, with Julia McKenzie and Anton Rogers, which won the most popular comedy Emmy award in New York. His output was prodigious, but always honed to perfection.\n\nBorn in London, he was the son of an engineer, the grandson of opera singers and the nephew of the actor Edward Chapman, whose splendid portrayals of sturdy northern burghers were a feature of 1940s and early 1950s British cinema. He was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford, the Glasgow Academy and University College School, London. After the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, he made his acting debut in National Velvet in London in 1946 .\n\nIn 1950, the then actor- manager Brian (now Lord) Rix brought Colin Morris's army farce, Reluctant Heroes, to the Whitehall theatre. Its arrival in the West End was the beginning of a 16-year rel- ationship between farce and that theatre, and it was here that John spent two years as an understudy and assistant stage manager on Reluctant Heroes, following it with two years in repertory in Folkestone and Weston-super-Mare.\n\nThis was a time of new farces arriving on the London stage and screen. It was also the time when John began to write. While in repertory, he finished Dry Rot, which Rix accepted and in which he starred from 1954-1958. John's own light comedy performance in that play was a joy to behold.\n\nI first met him at the Whitehall in 1956, as, fresh from two years in repertory, I was taking over from Basil Lord in Dry Rot. Joining that wonderful team, with the great Rix at the helm, set my life and career on a path strewn with joy and friendships that have endured for a lifetime.\n\nFollowing Dry Rot, I appeared in John's next play at the Whitehall, Simple Spymen, which ran from 1958-1961. It was during that run that we started to write together. Immediately, John's brilliant craftsmanship - which he had learnt from playing comedies by Ben Travers, Philip King and Vernon Sylvaine in repertory - sparked off my silly algebraic mind, which was also nurtured on Travers, King and Sylvaine in rep. The next 40 years were sheer bliss.\n\nTogether with our wives, we saw the plays performed all over the world - in Paris, Madrid, Sydney, New York - and made a crazy trip to Las Vegas to see Virginia Mayo in Move Over Mrs Markham. We also had the fantastic fun of turning the plays into low-budget movies.\n\nJohn wrote many other hit comedies with other friends and colleagues. These included Look No Hands (1985) with Michael Pertwee, Shut Your Eyes And Think Of England (1977) with Tony Marriot, the award-winning Key For Two (1982) with Dave Freeman, and Business Affairs (2001) and Deadlier Than The Male with Jeremy Lloyd.\n\nJohn was kind and considerate, the first to laugh at other people's jokes. The friendship that linked us - his wife Betty, my wife Linda, Brian Rix and his wife Elspet - has spanned a lifetime. He was the best friend, husband and father one could imagine or wish for. The theatre will mourn the passing of a playwright who has gone to join Philip King, Vernon Sylvaine, Ben Travers and Arthur Wing Pinero in a heaven which, I hope, has a myriad of exits, entrances, doors and French windows.\n\nBetty survives him, as do their sons, Mark, Adam and Justin. Another son, Guy, died tragically young."
