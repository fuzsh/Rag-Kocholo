        "text": "“ Pittsburgh! „ ~ Higbe complaining about his being traded.\n\nWalter Kirby Higbe is one of the secondary antagonists of the 2013 biographical sports film 42. He is one of several predominantly southern-born players on the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team who opposes Jackie Robinson joining the Dodgers, thereby breaking Major League baseballs unspoken color barrier. He was portrayed by Brad Beyer.\n\nRole in the film[]\n\nHigbe first encounters Jackie when Jackie is trying out for the Montreal Royals (the Dodgers' farm team) and playing an exhibition game against the Dodgers in Florida. Clearly hostile towards Jackie, Higbe throws pitches outside of the strike zone. Jackie has to dodge one of them, but is careful not to swing at them. Higbe dares Jackie to swing, but Jackie doesn't. Finally, after four balls, Jackie gets a walk, leading to some of the crowd jeering Higbe.\n\nInstead of focusing on the next batter, Higbe is distracted by Jackie positioning himself to steal second base. Higbe attempts to throw the ball to first, but Jackie steps back in time, and the Dodgers can't keep Jackie from stealing second, then third base.\n\nFinally, frustrated and distracted by Jackie, Higbe accidentally drops the ball. The umpire declares it a balk, and Jackie is allowed to take home, much to Higbe's anger. Young fan (and future ball player) Ed Charles points out to his mother \"He discombobulated him!\"\n\nLater, during the Dodgers' spring training, Higbe drafts a petition refusing to play on the same field as Jackie Robinson. Several of his teammates, including Bob Bragan and Dixie Walker agree to sign, though others, like Pee-Wee Reese and Eddie Stanky decline. General Manager Branch Rickey soon gets word of the petition, and has manager Leo Durocher crack down on the team, telling them that Jackie will play for the Dodgers and anyone who objects will be replaced. Higbe and most of the petitioners quickly back down. Jackie is signed to the Dodgers soon after, and gets a cold stare from Higbe and several others when he first enters the locker room.\n\nDuring a game with the Philadelphia Phillies, Jackie is repeatedly taunted with racial slurs by Phillies manager Ben Chapman. Most of the Dodgers were visibly troubled by Chapman's abuse, even Bragan, though Higbe seemed to enjoy it.\n\nSometime after this, Higbe is traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates, a far less successful team, presumably in part due to his opposition to Jackie. Higbe clearly blames Jackie for this and argues that he was traded for speaking his mind. \"Pittsburgh,\" he grumbles repeatedly as he cleans out his locker.\n\nLater that season, the Dodgers face the Pirates in the last game before advancing to the World Series. When Jackie is up at bat, Higbe, from the dugout, cheers for his fellow pitcher Fritz Ostermueller to strike Jackie out. When Jackie hits a game-clinching home run off of Ostermueller's pitch, Higbe throws down his hat in frustration and grumbles about Pittsburgh once again.\n\nTrivia[]"
