        "text": "Hello! My name is Randi Ring and I’m so excited to join the team here at The Cottonwood School! I was a teacher in Southern California before moving to Oregon, but I was actually born in Wisconsin. I love the Pacific Northwest for many reasons, one of which is that it reminds me of all the best parts of both of the states I’ve called home.\n\nI studied geology at Humboldt State University and got a Master of Arts in Education at the University of California Santa Cruz. As a kid, I was obsessed with rocks and that passion followed me into adulthood. Now, I love sharing everything I can about earth science (and science in general!) with my students. In high school, I started lifeguarding and teaching swimming lessons during the summer, and that is where my passion for teaching began.\n\nIt brings me so much joy to help kids learn new skills and see their confidence grow. While I love the outdoors and nature, I also take solace in my quiet hobbies. Reading has been an integral part of my life since I was young and I love curling up with a cup of tea, a blanket, and a good story. I’ve found peace and relaxation through art as I develop my skills in drawing and painting. Wherever I can, I like to include art in my teaching!\n\nLaine is a 4/5 teacher, and no stranger to CSCS! Laine first worked with our students in grades K-8 as a math intervention teacher. They completed their student teaching in both 3rd and 5th grades at Chapman Elementary. They also completed two years of public service as a math teacher through AmeriCorps doing interventions with 7th and 9th grade students. Prior to their teaching career, Laine spent 10 years as a fundraising professional supporting cultural preservation for Alaska Native tribes. With the desire to be “on the ground” in direct service and with a passion for culturally responsive education, Laine pursued a Master’s in Education from PSU. At PSU, Laine was part of the arts integration cohort, where they developed lessons that included arts standards in core curriculum. Laine has a Bachelor’s in Music from University of Alaska and has personally experienced the empowering nature of including the arts in primary education. With their interest in social justice and creative expression, they are committed to helping students explore and discover how they can use what is uniquely special about themselves to make meaningful contributions to their community.\n\nAviva (Shannon) McClure is a dedicated and experienced artist and educator, recognized for her contributions to experiential curriculum development, racial equity, and community building in educational settings.

I enjoy teaching and the creative process. I have a BFA in Visual Arts from the University of North Texas and a MAT from Concordia University, Portland and am also Montessori certified.\n\nFor the past 9 years I have taught in Portland Public Schools and for 8 of those years have taught at PPS Indian Education Native Montessori. Most recently I have been teaching third grade in PPS and am over the moon to teach a blended second and third grade class at CSCS! My teaching practices honor integrated learning, centering student interests, and incorporating both western and Native perspectives. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and visiting the Portland Art Museum. Thank you for this opportunity to join your CSCS community. I am so excited to meet all of you!\n\nI’m excited to start my first official elementary classroom with you. Two truths and a lie about me…I sang jazz at a memory care facility on Friday, I climbed Mt. Hood this season, and my favorite genre is sci-fi.\n\nMy educational career background includes teaching environmental education in Appalachian Ohio, as well as one summer stint at Tryon Creek, and working in several Portland districts subbing and as a paraeducator- but my favorite way to teach is truly in the natural world. I’m a semi-recent graduate from an MAT program in 2022, and have one official year under my belt teaching 6th grade math. The happenings of a school building in action never fail to fascinate me, and I know the Cottonwood microcosm will deliver. As I look for a vintage commuter bike to live out my Danish dreams pedaling to work (finally no long drive) I anticipate meeting you as well. Also, my favorite genre of literature is not sci-fi, but I need to read more of it!\n\nFor over 25 years Laura has been serving youth and their families as a transformational leader, curriculum writer, trainer, educator, and advocate.

Growing up in New Jersey has exposed her to many different cultures and social classes which gives her the tender ability to see things from many different angles. As a person who has worn multiple hats since graduating Rutgers University with a Bachelor’s of Science in 2013, she understands that there are infinitely many ways of thinking and viewing the world. This understanding helps her guide those who may deviate from the standard towards discovering their strengths, so that they can develop the skills to eventually pursue their education independently. As a person who came to Portland with next to nothing and found a way to summit mountains, ride 200 miles to Seattle via bicycle, and build a stable and successful life, she knows that everyone around her is way more capable than they realize and it is her mission to show them that potential.\n\nSade joined the CSCS community in 2017 when her oldest was in kindergarten at Cottonwood; now she has three children attending. Cottonwood’s place-based curriculum and passion for civic engagement was the foundation for putting her kids at CSCS. Sade has joined the faculty this year after being a stay-at-home mom, and student all while serving on the board and the DEI committee the past two years. Sade recently graduated from Portland State University with a Bachelor’s in Communication. She also has an Associate Degree in Business Administration.\n\nSade believes every child from a diverse background should have someone advocating for them in the school system. Growing up, Sade lived all over Portland and Vancouver, and as a person of color, she understands first-hand how challenging a school system embedded in systemic racism can be. The experience of being unnoticed and forgotten by an education system rooted in systemic racism inspired her passion for DEI work. The passion she has for DEI comes from her own lived experiences and raising four black children in the public-school system. Her philosophy is that all schools should foster a culture of difference, hold individuals accountable for equity, and challenge preexisting notions and misconceptions. This work in making CSCS a more inclusive environment is something she believes the school is committed to doing. In her free time Sade enjoys writing poetry, listening to music, dancing, and spending time with her family.\n\nDaniel is a soccer fanatic, having grown up in England and his weekends generally consist of waking up early to watch the English Premier League before heading out to play in or coach a game or two. He studied Sports Development at University and has a vast background in sports coaching, exercise and the leisure industry in general.\n\nDaniel first stepped foot in Portland in 2014-15 as a traveling soccer coach, coaching soccer camps throughout the country. He then did an 18 month working holiday in New Zealand and Australia before he made a permanent move to Portland in 2018. Since that date as a licensed coach in both the UK and US, he worked for 2 Soccer Organizations in the city before beginning his PE Teacher role at CSCS in 2022. He is passionate to give the children a positive experience in physical activity that will resonate with them for the rest of their lives. He is known by his friends as an explorer with interests such as hiking, camping, cycling, sports, visiting National Parks and paddling on one of the many lakes or rivers in Oregon.\n\nJoe is a lifelong self directed learner, an artist, a nature lover and parent to a vibrant eleven year old child, Loraine. He believes passionately in the power of playful, experiential (doing “real stuff”), feminist, learner led education. Joe began building puppets from discarded and natural materials as a six year old child in Memphis, Tennessee. Since then he has developed a personal, creative practice in which he uses music, puppetry and theater to share social and emotional ‘strategies’ and to discover, together with children, new ways to critically interrogate and dis-organize from systems of oppression. Joe loves to ride his bike and to collect rocks with his daughter.\n\nJoe has more than 20 years of professional experience teaching children in preschool and school age classrooms and as a community organizer. He currently serves on the board of two youth focused nonprofits: Portland Free Play and Poetic Justice Foundation. He is a founding member of the PDX Childcare Collective and until recently, he operated a radical preschool out of his home called Air/Plane Cottage School. Joe built an adventure playground in his backyard from recycled materials. This is an evolving, interactive collaboration between children and adults as well as a playful exercise in hopeful worldbuilding!\n\nWhen not working with kids Joe plays music with his band(s), hosts events with his collective house of queer artists, volunteers with racial justice and houseless advocacy groups and avidly reads poetry, history and political theory.\n\nLisa joined the teaching team at CSCS in 2007. Prior to teaching at SWCS, she worked with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) where for four years she developed science curriculum and taught students of all ages around the state. Her love of science and exploration began back in Michigan where she and her sister would explore their neighborhood, looking for insects and tinkering in their father’s work shed. That interest would take her to study at the University of Michigan where she discovered she had a talent for teaching and received a Bachelor of Arts in Education with High Distinction. She recently completed her Master’s degree at Concordia. She has taught in a variety of educational settings from large group assemblies, which encouraged a love of theater, to small group classrooms, where she can give individualized attention. Her strong science background is accented by a passion for storytelling, folklore & mythology from around the world. Inspired by those tales, she creates visual art, plays with the Stumptown-Jugthumpers as a washboard player, and is learning how to make puppets. Lisa brings her enthusiasm and talents to share and loves discovering and honing the talents and skills of each of her students.\n\nEmily is a passionate explorer… of places, ideas, and what makes people tick. She has been working for the past few years as a Career Coach, helping job seekers navigate the sticky terrain of finding a career fit and snagging their next job opportunity. Before transitioning to career coaching, Emily worked for fourteen years as a university instructor, mainly in the field of World Regional Geography, where she and her students traversed the concepts of human and environment connections in various manifestations across the globe.\n\nOutside of paid employment, Emily enjoys spending time (preferably outdoors) with her two daughters and husband, Billie; some of the family’s favorite outdoor activities are backpacking, canoeing, sailing, hiking, and camping. Emily also deeply appreciates stories, is an avid reader and an occasional creator of illustrations.\n\nEmily is excited to be joining the Cottonwood Board where she hopes to put some of her lifelong interests and skills to use to serve the Cottonwood community.\n\nWe joined CSCS in 2012 and I have been volunteering for various things around the school ever since, including creating promotional material for the school’s annual auction since 2014 and the design of the live auction catalog from 2015-2019. I also worked with another parent to revamp the school’s website when the name of the school was changed from SW Charter to The Cottonwood School. I have been the go-to person for all things related to the school’s website since.\n\nIn November of 2017, I was elected to The Cottonwood school board. I had one child enrolled and one who would be soon, so I thought that I would like to have more input on shaping the future of the school. I am currently the chair of the Marketing Committee which oversees the website and search engine marketing as well as press and promotion for events and school activities to help further position the school as an authority in place-based education and promote enrollment.\n\nI am a graphic designer, web designer, web developer and digital marketer.\n\nI normally enjoy going out and listening to live music on a regular basis, but 2020 broke all of that, so I spend more time watching movies and playing cards with my family, doing DIY projects around our new house, playing video games with the kids, practicing playing the drums and keeping up with all of the extra cooking now that we don’t go out anymore. When we go back to some kind of “normal,” I am really looking forward to hanging out with CSCS parents again.\n\nMy family has been a part of the Cottonwood community since 2013 when my older son started Kindergarten here. We were looking for an opportunity to be involved in his education on a deeper level than often comes with a larger neighborhood school. We loved that our son would have a small, nurturing environment that allowed him to explore learning both in the classroom and in the field. We later enrolled our younger son, and he has thrived at Cottonwood for different but equally as valuable reasons, like the personalized attention to his needs and patient, caring staff to help him through any bumps in the road.\n\nBy day, I am the project manager for a creative team in the marketing department of a large textiles company. I use my skills from work to help organize and push forward the vast array of projects that help this amazing school continue to grow as thought leaders in the field of Place Based Learning.\n\nIn my free time, I love to travel and see live music. I have been using the lockdown time to finish some overdue home renovation projects and adopt a couple of puppies. I am married to my college sweetheart and moved to Portland with him almost 20 years ago from the east coast. Best decision ever. (The move AND the husband!). Deciding to be a part of the Cottonwood community ranks way up there as well!\n\nScott is the Executive Director of the nonprofit Blanchet House of Hospitality, which provides meals, shelter, and aid to houseless and food insecure individuals in Portland. Although not a Cottonwood parent, Scott has long admired Cottonwood’s mission and unique place-based curriculum. Prior to joining the Cottonwood Board, Scott got a first-hand look at Cottonwood’s classrooms in action while he was the senior program manager at Classroom Law Project, which runs the Project Citizen program that Cottonwood teachers and students enjoy. He brings over two decades of teaching and independent school leadership experience to the Cottonwood board, as well as past board experience, including six years on the board at the nearby language-immersion International School. Scott currently serves on the Old Town Community Association Board. And once in his life, a long long time ago, he practiced as a criminal defense attorney in Texas. Scott and his wife Jill, a med/peds physician, have three children–one out of college, one in college, and one almost there. In his precious free time, Scott and his wife practice being empty-nesters, which during COVID involves a lot of binge watching shows they didn’t have time for before.\n\nI came to Cottonwood in 2017 when my stepdaughter was accepted into the third grade. From the beginning, I was so impressed with the place-based curriculum that I decided to send her younger brother and sister to the school as well. Once it became clear that our family would be a part of Cottonwood for many years, I decided that the best way for me to support the school was to use my previous board experience in home-owner and neighborhood associations and join the board.\n\nEducated at the Oregon Institute of Technology, I am currently working as a web developer full-time. My wife Allison, a naturopathic physician and clinical consultant for a medical lab, and I are currently navigating the craziness of working and doing school for three kids from our home. In my spare time, I am a huge fan of the Portland Timbers and, when not in the middle of a global pandemic, can often be found standing in the famous Timbers Army singing the team on to victory.\n\nI’m proud and privileged to say that we’ve been a Cottonwood family since 2013. From the very beginning, I could feel that this community was itself a precious family worthy of my support. I started my service to the school with the parent organization helping with auctions and have spent the last five years on the Board, serving as President for two years, and currently as Treasurer. I enjoy putting my skills in accounting and governance to use to the benefit of the administration and staff of the school, and ultimately for its students. I am an Accounting Manager at Portland General Electric focusing on Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, a mother of two boys, an all-weather runner, a summertime paddle boarder, and an Airbnb superhost! I draw on my past experiences as a bookkeeper, CPA, internal auditor and Wilson High School cheerleader to volunteer for the unpopular tasks, or find volunteers, to fill in the gaps where needed. I find so much meaning in my board service because it allows me to witness an organization carrying out a mission I deeply believe in and doing so with courage, grit, creativity and passion. I am here in support of the committed and talented teachers and staff because I can see the difference that they make in the lives of the children of Portland and in the broader educational community.\n\nCottonwood’s place-based curriculum and passion for civic engagement was the foundation for putting our kids at CSCS. I have a son (9) in the third grade, and I have a son (7) in the first grade. We have been part of the CSCS family since my nine-year-old was in kindergarten. After two years of my oldest son attending CSCS and having another son going into kindergarten, I decided to join the Board. Having two strong Black boys at CSCS I wanted to be their voice. Being on the Board this past year has given me that opportunity. Currently, I am attending Portland State University in my last year towards a Bachelor’s Degree in Communications. I also have an Associate Degree in Business Administration. My current goal, especially after this past year, is to be a Diversity Advocate for grade-school level students. I believe every child from a diverse background should have someone advocating for them in the school system.\n\nI moved around a lot as a child, throughout the Portland and Vancouver area, and I know first-hand as a minority how hard it is to be a student in a school system embedded on systemic racism. The amazing thing about Cottonwood, particularly after this traumatic year we had, is seeing our school really stepping up. Seeing the growth, the support, and strength this past year at CSCS makes me proud to be part of such an amazing school and serving on the Board.\n\nIn my spare time, my family and I love going to the Coast spending time relaxing with an ocean view. I enjoy writing poetry. My family and I love having dance parties in our living room. Even though I lived in the Northwest most of my life, I like taking adventures and finding new gems right in our very own backyard. I love to read books; sometimes I will finish a whole book in one day. I also love watching movies of all genres, and if I could spend a Saturday binge watching and eating popcorn all day I would. What I love most is being with family and having some good, old-fashioned family fun.\n\nI am a neurodivergent Jersey girl-turned-Portlander, avid reader and writer, and believer in all things local. Cottonwood’s focus on place-based education inspired me to join the board.\n\nLeadership isn’t something that came naturally to me; all my teachers branded me as extremely shy as a child. I’ve always preferred working behind the scenes and amplifying others’ voices, and my role on this board allows me to do both. I worked as a local journalist prior to starting a literary publishing house, Forest Avenue Press, in 2012. I believe in the power of storytelling and use my skillset to help with Cottonwood publicity and marketing campaigns.\n\nI have a degree from Vassar College and a certificate from the Yale Publishing Course, which I attended in 2018 thanks to a scholarship from the Independent Book Publishers Association. I’m a proud member of the Anxiety Society, supporting the Create More, Fear Less nonprofit founded right here in Portland to help students use art and imagination to work through their worries.\n\nJoe joined the staff as a long-term substitute in the Winter of 2020. He received his Bachelor’s degree from Rutgers University, and his Master’s of Art in Teaching from SUNY Cortland in 2010. He is a passionate reader, writer, and outdoor adventurer who has been teaching and exploring the Pacific Northwest for the past ten years. In addition to several years working with underserved and homeless youth in downtown Portland, Joe has also taught at an American International School in Guatemala City. Joe feels that successful educators must be constantly searching for newer and better ways to connect with and engage their students and be willing to meet and interact with young people in the spaces that they find comfortable. This means being tech savvy and culturally aware, but it also means simply having the confidence and the integrity to treat all people with respect, and approach every learning opportunity with an open mind. He is looking forward to learning more about place-based learning as the year proceeds.\n\nNesa joined the teaching team at CSCS in fall 2014 and has loved being a part of this amazing community ever since! Nesa is passionate about Place-Based Education and has been working on the grant committee to help other teachers learn about and implement PBE curriculum. She also uses the Scottish Storyline method, an integrated approach to teaching, in her classroom which leads to many engaging activities such as building a volcano and creating a restaurant in the classroom. Nesa received her B.A. in Drama from Vassar College in New York and incorporates her love of performance into the classroom by allowing her students to explore creatively and learn by doing. Originally from Eugene, Nesa returned to Oregon after living on the east coast and received her Masters in Education from Portland State University. Nesa has loved being a teacher of young students immensely. She loves getting to know her students, discovering their strengths and talents, and overcoming challenges together as a classroom and school community. Outside of teaching, Nesa enjoys being in nature, traveling, Balkan folk dancing, dancing in general, and 90s sing-along parties."
