        "text": "Today Tacoma Strength must say goodbye to coach and athlete Ben Chapman.\n\nIf you would like to stay in touch with Ben be sure to subscribe to his podcast. Cool Guys with Fanny Packs on iTunes and on Facebook.\n\nIn his honor here’s an interview we had with him back on September 19, 2010. Pre-fanny pack.\n\nHow were you introduced to CrossFit Tacoma?\n\nI first began CrossFit when I was living in Texas and someone who liked the movie 300 had basically told me about it. I was an athlete in college and there was a certain attractiveness to the constant evaluating and scoring of workouts. It felt like competition where your prize was having a more badass physicality instead of a medal or trophy. I also got a little angry that there were all these things that I simply couldn’t do and I felt like that was a travesty; so I tried to learn to do them. When I moved to the Pac NW, I found the closest box I could and started going to group workouts; CrossFit Pierce county was a great home for me for about a year and a half during that time.\n\nI met Morgan, Lisa and Finley at the CFPC gym when they got back from Thailand. After Morgan savagely brutalized my ego day after day, they opened up a box downtown, close to where I live; I went in a for a few WODs and the rest is history… By the time I met Tyler, I’d already signed paperwork.\n\nWhat is your favorite movement or WOD?\n\nThe Deadlift is my favorite movement; I think it’s the best demo of raw strength out there. As far as WODs go, I’m partial to “Grace” because it is so easy to tweak and know just how much something will help or hurt your time… Plus it puts me right on my butt in under 3 minutes. I’m also partial to any WOD in which I can beat Tyler…. But I can’t list ALL the WODs here; so I’ll stick with “Grace”.\n\nWhat do you find to be the most challenging part of CrossFit?\n\nBeing disciplined about working your weaknesses. I think human nature disposes people to focus on the things they they’ve got pretty well together; but it takes a bit more character to stare something in the face that you suck at and say you’re going to do it anyway. For me this would be diet and mobility work; things that I still struggle to keep under control and try to progress… It is also very challenging to talk face to face with Tyler; everyone knows the smell I’m talking about, right?\n\nWhat have you gained from being a member at CrossFit Tacoma?\n\nA ton of good friends and people who I feel very comfortable around. I’ve also gained a mindset that I think pervades our group that is never satisfied with just coasting; we’re always trying to find ways to do things better and I think that attracts folks when they know you care: I feel like I’ve gained a lot of people who really care… I’ve also gained a healthy distrust for people from New Hampshire or Vermont (same thing, really).\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nI am basically a high functioning Gibbon Monkey that has been conditioned and brainwashed to move heavy cargo for the U.S. military in a mildly efficient manner. I also provide an ego boost for Army personnel when they simply view me in action; I see it as assisting with morale. One of my secondary responsibilities is to ensure that the Air Force’s annual quota of bitching and whining is always kept to the brim(Some hotel bars really need to rethink their appletinis). Sometimes they let me use a walkie talkie too.\n\nWhat do you like to do for fun?\n\nCrossFit is actually my number 1 hobby at the moment. When the weather calls for it though, I enjoy shredding powder and subduing the earth. I’ve been known to Karaoke with Dave L on occasion, and I love hurting Tyler’s feelings. I’m going to try my hand at triathlons next Summer as well (running one, not hurting its feelings).\n\nIf you could donate a million dollars to a non-profit organization which organization would you choose and why?\n\nI don’t know any specific names, but I think I would find an organization that is dedicated to building economies in Africa. I’ve seen small amounts of money go a long long way over there, enabling folks with drive but few resources grown a sustaining business from the ground up. A cool million distributed correctly in some of those burgeoning nations would ignite economies where there really are none.\n\nWhat are 3 things that you want to do before you die?\n\nPublish a book\n\nOwn a business\n\nSpawn an NFL offensive line\n\nWhat is the most challenging thing you have ever done?\n\nIt’s a draw between:\n\nGraduating from College. it was looking iffy there a bunch of times, but I got through all four years without any Fs and I took my degree and got the hell outta Dodge;\n\nGraduating from Air Force Pilot training. I fought airsickness the entire way through and had many rides in the dreaded barany chair, a device that is simply a chair that spins to desensitize your inner ear to motion sickness -by making you really, really motion sick- That combined with my natural lack of motor ability made for some hairy times in the cockpit and I’m lucky to have gotten through with some wings on my chest.\n\nEnduring the company of Tyler for about as long as it takes me to finish a marathon.\n\nBy Morgan on Monday, August, 13, 2012"
