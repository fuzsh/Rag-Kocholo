        "text": "Austrian leading lady Nadja Tiller reached the height of her popularity during the 1950s and 60s. She was the daughter of stage actor and director Anton Tiller and his wife, the opera singer Erika Körner (1902-1979). It seemed that Nadja's career had been marked out for her early on: she was to take over a hairdressing establishment run by her grandparents in Danzig (now Gdansk). However, the war put paid to this. In 1945, having found a new calling, she enrolled at the Max-Reinhardt Seminar to take dance, ballet and drama classes while working part time as a mannequin in a hat salon. She completed her studies four years later at the University of Music and Performing Arts. That same year, Tiller was voted Miss Austria (she won again in 1951) which helped to secure her first theatrical engagement in the Theater in der Josefstadt. Her screen debut, a small part in the Beethoven biopic Eroica (1949) was cut, but she soon after made her first appearance in Küss mich Casanova (1949), a romantic musical comedy starring matinee idol O.W. Fischer. Tiller then played a rival to Hildegard Knef for the affections of Hardy Krüger in the melodrama Illusion in Moll (1952) and proceeded with leading roles in several undemanding lightweight farces like Einmal keine Sorgen haben (1953), Die Kaiserin von China (1953) and Mädchen mit Zukunft (1954). At his point in her career, Tiller's stock-in-trade heroines were most often worldly flirts or fashionable sophisticates.\n\nHer fortunes took an upswing under the director Rolf Thiele who provided her with more challenging material in dramas like Friederike von Barring (1956), Lulu (1962) (both title roles) and, as an Egyptian dancer, in El Hakim (1957). In the repressed and conservative 50s, her breakout role as the titular prostitute in Thiele's socially conscious masterpiece Das Mädchen Rosemarie (1958) was viewed by some as scandalous and others as sensational, as it exposed the hypocrisy of people and institutions. Rosemary won not only the German Film Critics Award but also a Golden Globe in the U.S. for Best Foreign Language Film. Nadja Tiller emerged from this venture as an international star.\n\nBy the late 50s, Tiller featured prominently in many French, Italian, English and American productions, opposite stars like Jean Marais (Des Königs bester Mann (1958) and Rendezvous der Killer (1965)), Jean Gabin (Im Mantel der Nacht (1958)), Jean-Paul Belmondo (Geliebter Schuft (1966)), Rod Steiger (An einem Freitag um halb zwölf (1961)) and Yul Brynner (Mohn ist auch eine Blume (1966)). From the mid-70s, having transitioned to character roles, she alternated appearances on television with theatrical engagements in Lübeck, Berlin, Hamburg and Vienna, often in boulevard dramas.\n\nFrom 1956 until his death in 2011, Tiller was married to the actor Walter Giller. Dubbed the 'Traumpaar' (dream couple), they appeared in several films together, their last as two feisty pensioners in the comedy Dinosaurier (2009). Tiller passed away in a Hamburg retirement home on February 21 2023 at the age of 93.\n\nCharles Beaumont was the pseudonym for Charles Leroy Nutt, born on Chicago's North Side on January 2 1929. He also occasionally wrote under the names Charles McNutt and E.T. Beaumont (the latter apparently based on the name of a Texas town). Tragically short-lived, Beaumont was a dynamic and imaginative author and screenwriter of macabre, cautionary tales -- frequently tinged with black humour -- blending the genres of science-fiction, fantasy and horror. With the sole exception of Rod Serling, he was the single most important creative force in the early years of Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959), responsible for many classic episodes, including \"Perchance to Dream\" (adapted from his original story, first published in 'Playboy' magazine in November 1958), \"Printer's Devil\" (from \"The Devil, You Say?\", his very first story, published in 'Amazing Stories', January 1951), \"The Jungle\" ('If' magazine, December 1954) and \"In His Image\" (one of the stories from his collection \"Yonder\", published in 1958). Much of Beaumont's early work was published in an anthology entitled \"The Hunger and Other Stories\", by Putnam in 1957. He also scripted or co-scripted several movies, including Roger Corman's Lebendig begraben (1962), Die Folterkammer des Hexenjägers (1963) (Beaumont only took the title from the poem by Edgar Allan Poe, adapting the actual story from H.P. Lovecraft's novel \"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward\") and Satanas - Das Schloß der blutigen Bestie (1964). He also wrote an earlier script for In den Krallen der Venus (1958) as a spoof, later ruefully commenting, that neither the director nor the cast seemed to have noticed that fact.\n\nBeaumont had an extremely troubled childhood, which he later referred to as \"one big Charles Addams cartoon\". His mentally unstable mother at one time dressed him in girl's clothes and killed one of his pets as a form of punishment (this later inspired his short story \"Miss Gentillbelle\"). He was eventually farmed out to the care of five widowed aunts, who operated a boarding house and regaled young Charles with nightly tales, detailing the peculiar demise of each of their husbands. Somehow, perhaps unsurprisingly, young Charles developed his macabre sense of humour.\n\nHe first became interested in science fiction in his teens. He found school entirely boring, dropping out in the tenth grade. Then came a brief stint in the U.S. Army, but he was discharged after just three months for medical reasons (back problems). With little success, he tried his hand at acting, then sold illustrations to pulp magazines, worked as a railroad clerk in Mobile, Alabama; as an animator at MGM, even as a dishwasher. By the time he was twenty, he wrote prolifically, but remained unable to sell any of his first seventy-two stories, until the science-fiction magazine 'Amazing Stories' showed interest in \"The Devil, You Say?\", which was eventually published in early 1951. By the end of the decade, he had successfully segued into writing for films and television.\n\nIn 1964, at the height of his creative abilities, Beaumont was struck down by a savage illness (a combination of Pick's disease and early-onset Alzheimer's) which sadly claimed his life three years later at the age of thirty-eight.\n\nDwayne McDuffie was an African American comic book and animation writer best known as one of the founders of Milestone Media, an imprint of DC Comics dedicated to promoting better stories and characterizations for minorities and for his contributions to Justice League and Justice League Unlimited, the final installment of what DC Comics fans refer to as \"the DCAU\". McDuffie, who notoriously despised stereotypes and vehemently fought against them in his work, won three Eisner Award nominations for his work in comics.\n\nBorn Dwayne Glenn McDuffie in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Edna McDuffie Gardner, as a child he initially dreamed of becoming an astronaut and studied physics, but he was rejected from that occupation due to his 6-foot-5 stature. A voracious reader, McDuffie then dedicated his energy to writing. Following a stint as copy editor for Investment Dealer's Digest (a business magazine) a friend's connection helped him win an interview at Marvel Comics as an assistant editor to Bob Budiansky, where he cut his literary teeth on helping develop the company's first superhero trading cards and writing \"Damage Control\", a miniseries dealing with the insurance company that has to deal with the collateral damage of the super-hero Vs. super-villain brawls that plague the company's fictional interpretation of New York City. When he became an editor for Marvel he submitted the spoof proposal Ninja Thrashers in response to the company's treatment of its black characters.\n\nFollowing freelance writing in 1990 for various Marvel, DC Comics and even Archie Comics titles, McDuffie wrote Monster In My Pocket for Harvey Comics editor Sid Jacobson, whom he cited as a mentor.\n\nFollowing his early 1991 divorce from his first wife, Patricia D. Younger, McDuffie and three partners founded Milestone Media, in order to express a multicultural sensibility he felt comic books were lacking. With McDuffie as editor-in-chief, Milestone's characters included the African-American Static, Icon, Hardware, the Asian-American Xombi, and the multi-ethnic superhero group the Blood Syndicate, which include black, Asian and Latino men and women. Milestone debuted its titles in 1993 through a distribution deal with DC Comics.\n\nFollowing the discontinuation of Milestone Media's publishing, Static would be adapted into the animated series Static Shock, for which McDuffie wrote 11 episodes, also serving as story editor. McDuffie then joined the writing staff of Justice League, essentially replacing long time DCAU writer Paul Dini, later promoted to story editor and producer when the series became Justice League Unlimited, writing, producing or at least story-editing 69 of the series 91 episodes. Other animation writing credits included What's New, Scooby-Doo?, Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben: Ben 10: Ultimate Alien, and Teen Titans.\n\nIn addition to his TV animation writing credits, McDuffie also wrote for a number of direct-to-DVD animated films for Warner Brothers featuring DC Comics heroes. Among these were Justice League: Crisis On 2 Earths (2010), based on an abandoned story idea he'd originally pitched as a bridge between the end of Justice League and the beginning of Justice League Unlimited, All-Star Superman (2011) and Justice League: Doom (2012).\n\nDuring his return to comics, McDuffie wrote the Marvel miniseries Beyond! and the Fantastic Four, and Firestorm and Justice League America for DC Comics, the latter he was unfortunately fired from following his very frank and unflattering answers to fans about the creative process. McDuffie then wrote Milestone Forever, chronicling the final adventures of the Milestone characters he'd helped create before they were added to the regular DC universe.\n\nFriends, family and fans were devastated when McDuffie died on February 21, 2011, only one day after his 49th birthday, due to complications from emergency heart surgery at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center. His younger brother, Darryl, had died only a few months earlier, while their older brother Brian had died as an infant. Truly a titanic, larger than life visionary who fought relentlessly for better quality storytelling for all, McDuffie was a talent lost too soon. He is survived by his second wife, animation-TV writer Charlotte Fullerton, and his mother. When Justice League: Doom, loosely based on Mark Waid's Tower of Babel miniseries, was released a little more than year later it was dedicated to his memory.\n\nEmma was born Emma Gwynedd Mary Chambers born in Doncaster, South Yorkshire in 1964 to John, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, and Noelle (nee Strange). The family moved around and, while attending St Swithun's school, Winchester, Chambers acted in Winchester college productions - saying she \"enjoyed showing off\" - and played lacrosse for Hampshire. Her parents eventually split up and she trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, where the former EastEnders actor Ross Kemp was one of her contemporaries.\n\nHer best remembered film role, in Curtis's 1999 romcom Notting Hill, was the eccentric Honey Thacker, star-struck and overawed at meeting the Hollywood actor (played by Julia Roberts) who has fallen for her bookshop-owner brother (Hugh Grant). Honey explains her own difficulties in finding a partner: \"I don't have hair - I've got feathers - and I've got funny, goggly eyes, and I'm attracted to cruel men and no one will ever marry me because my boosies have actually started shrinking.\" She eventually becomes engaged to her brother's slovenly housemate (Rhys Ifans).\n\nHer sister, Sarah Doukas, and brother, Simon, went on to run Storm Model Management, which discovered Kate Moss at the age of 14.\n\nChambers made her television debut as Margaret, one of the young Brangwen children, in a 1988 BBC adaptation of the DH Lawrence novel The Rainbow. In between one-off roles on TV, she played Charity Pecksniff in a six-part serialisation of Charles Dickens's Martin Chuzzlewit, which began in the same week as The Vicar of Dibley (1994).\n\nThe popular BBC sitcom, written by Richard Curtis with Paul Mayhew-Archer, ran for two series, from 1994 to 1998, finishing with Alice's marriage to Hugo Horton (played by James Fleet), her second cousin once removed. Geraldine described both as having the intellectual capacity of a cactus and the wedding was notable for the two bridal attendants dressed as Teletubbies. Chambers won the 1998 British Comedy Award for best actress and returned as Alice in various Vicar of Dibley specials between 1999 and 2007.\n\nShe had significant supporting roles in the sitcom How Do You Want Me? (1998-99) as Helen Yardley, sister of the newlywed Lisa (Charlotte Coleman) returning from London to be near her family in the countryside, and Take a Girl Like You (2000), Andrew Davies's adaptation of Kingsley Amis's comic novel, as Martha Thompson, the bored housewife hostile to her beautiful, northern lodger.\n\nChambers' West End theatre debut came with the part of Geain, estranged daughter of Ian McKellen's composer Jerome, in Alan Ayckbourn's comedy Henceforward... (Vaudeville theatre, 1988-89) after appearing in the original 1987 production at the Stephen Joseph theatre, Scarborough. In his casting notes for Geain, Ayckbourn stipulated: \"Not a child, please. Just a very small actress.\" Chambers lodged with McKellen for a while and said she regarded him as a father figure.\n\nWhen, in 1989, she starred in the Scarborough premiere of Ayckbourn's Invisible Friends as another teenage daughter, Lucy Baines, who has an imaginary companion to relieve the awfulness of living with her family, the critic Harry Eyres praised Chambers' skill in \"conveying Lucy's kaleidoscopic emotional states with startling immediacy\" and negotiating the tricky device of also acting as the play's narrator. She reprised the role in London at the Cottesloe during two stints with the National Theatre company (1991-92) that included appearances in productions such as Franz Kafka's The Trial and Alan Bennett's The Madness of George III.\n\nShe gave a hilarious performance as Orgon's daughter Mariane in Tartuffe (Almeida theatre, 1996) and starred as Sheila in Michael Frayn's Benefactors (Albery theatre, 2002), a performance described by one critic as \"a touching study in parasitic helplessness\".\n\nChambers who suffered from asthma, attacks of which were often brought on by an acute allergy to animals, withdrew largely but not entirely from public life after the final episode of The Vicar of Dibley (1994) in 2007, which was also to remain her final television role. On the evening of 21st February 2018 Chambers suffered a heart attack and died at her home in Lymington, Hampshire, England at the age of just 53. Her death was announced three days later by her agent John Grant.\n\nChambers was survived by her husband, the actor Ian Dunn, whom she married in 1991, and by her siblings."
