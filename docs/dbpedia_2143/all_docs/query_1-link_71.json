        "text": "Learn about looking after cats with this heart-warming story.\n\nWould you really love a cat but don't know the first thing about how it will affect you and your family? This book gives young children aged 6+ all information they and their families need to see if they could take on this big responsibilty. The information is given through the story of Holly who is is desperate to get a cat, but the rest of his family don't think it's a good idea. So Holly decides to start a scrapbook to discover what a cat needs. She looks around his home and wonders where the cat will live. She collects photos of different cat breeds and adds labels with their temperaments, how to care for them etc. Holly's family see her enthusiasm and begin to get on board with the idea. Together they visit a kitten from a local family but they also visit a rescue centre and decide to get an adult cat from there.\n\nUsing Jason Chapman's lively illustrations and Alex's photographic scrapbook, this 'two books in one' describes the behaviour and needs of cats and how it affects a family's life day-to-day in a charming and fun way. The book is endorsed and checked by Battersea Dogs & Cats Home."
