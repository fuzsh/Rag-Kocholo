Andrew’s senior year in 2010 culminated with the Cardinal’s 40-12 victory in the Orange Bowl against Virginia Tech.\n\nDenny McCarthy '11\n\nWhile at Georgetown Prep, Denny was named The Washington Post’s All-Met Player of the year in 2010 and earned All-Met honors all four seasons.

Michael, Jr. served as a role model for the younger members of his team, both at Georgetown Prep and at UMass, on and off the field.\n\nThe 1964 Football Team\n\nIn order to fully appreciate the success of the Georgetown Prep 1964 football team, it is essential to recall the position of the team in the early “Fegan Era” of Prep football. Head Coach Jim Fegan was hired by Prep’s Rector in 1961 to revitalize the football program and return it to the tradition of success and respect it had enjoyed in prior years. Coach Fegan and his assistant coaches turned Prep’s football fortunes around in his second year as head coach. The 1962 Varsity Football team, a Prep Athletic Hall of Fame team, went undefeated and won Prep’s first IAC Championship. With many players returning from the 1962 team, the 1963 team also achieved success and shared the IAC Co-Championship.\n\nWhen football camp opened in 1964, Coach Fegan was faced with replacing thirteen starters, including the starting senior quarterback who left Prep during the summer. Coach Fegan and his staff clearly had their work cut out for them, but they soon discovered there were many talented players. Coach Fegan realized they would be able to replace the players lost to graduation and that he had the talent needed to field another excellent team.\n\nThe season started on a high note, but there were immediate critical losses created by injuries to key players. And while the 1964 football team may not have possessed the level of individual talent or the size of players on previous teams, the team had many intangibles that more than made up for their limitations. It was a team characterized by a commitment to excellence, unity of purpose, discipline, camaraderie, humility and respect.\n\nThe returning starters and those who stepped up to replace the players lost through graduation or injuries carried on the tradition of success which Coach Fegan’s teams had achieved in the preceding two seasons. The 1964 football team won all seven games, including a 20-0 defeat of archrival Landon in the final game of the season to win Prep’s second outright IAC Championship in three years. The team outscored its opponents 156-27, holding four opponents scoreless and ended the season ranked 4th in The Washington Post final metropolitan area high school rankings.\n\n(From the original nomination letter drafted by Beeb Graham ’65, John Hyland ’65, John Moore ’65, Mike Genz ’65)\n\nThe 1988, 1989 & 1990 Baseball Teams\n\nIAC Champions 3 Consecutive Seasons\n\nIn the spring of 1988, Georgetown Prep Varsity Baseball coaches Pete White and Steve Smith embarked on a journey together with a group of talented student athletes. Over the next three baseball seasons, 1988, 1989 and 1990, for the first time in Prep history, the team won consecutive IAC Baseball titles in a dominating fashion.\n\nGeorgetown Prep had great success on the baseball field; however, their great character and positive spirit shone bright throughout the entire Prep community. This talented group of young men instilled their positive attitude in all aspects of life. These student athletes made those around them better and they worked to be their best on and off the field.\n\nCoach White and Coach Smith excelled in their work. In an old-school fashion they encouraged, challenged, and supported each and every one of their players. They loved these young men. In return, their players made a statement:\n\n3-year record: 50 wins vs. 8 losses 11 All-IAC Players\n\n9 All-County Players\n\n7 All-Met Players\n\nThis statement, along with the way they respected and honored the great game of baseball, is the catalyst for their induction as a team to the Georgetown Prep Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 2005 Rugby Team\n\nIn the spring of 1998, Georgetown Prep made a decision to add rugby as a new sport to the traditional spring line up. For many or most at Prep, they had only seen rugby played at the college level or on television. It isn’t an American sport and many in our community were not familiar with rugby. Since tackling was included, many thought it was similar to football. They couldn’t grasp the concept that you would tackle someone without equipment. Everyone talked about safety and injuries.\n\nHowever, a number of alumni who had played the game during college passionately encouraged our community to embrace this opportunity. Their love for the game was contagious, so our community decided that rugby would provide an educational experience that would enhance our young participants.\n\nAs we began the program at Prep, we learned very quickly that our young men enjoyed every aspect of the sport. More importantly, serving Prep’s emphasis on getting every student involved in some physical activity, rugby attracted a part of our student population that wasn’t playing a spring sport at the time.\n\nThankfully, we had a group of young men who took the leap of faith and changed the landscape of spring sports. Our coaching staff was eager and energized. These enthusiastic coaches and young men started a tradition. The tradition of rugby!\n\nWe induct the 2005 Georgetown Prep Rugby Team as a beacon of trailblazing spirit and for their great achievement of convincingly winning the 2005 Potomac Rugby Union Division Two Championship.\n\nAs we induct the 2005 Championship team into the Hall of Fame, rugby continues to thrive at Prep presently fielding three teams. Prep has over 75 rugby players, and the team experienced a successful Spring Break trip to Scotland in March 2022.\n\nWe are grateful for these players and coaches for their actions in spreading the life changing culture of rugby.\n\nJohn L.

Additionally, Coach Shea had four nationally-ranked players on his team in that season.\n\nCoach Shea developed the initial strength and conditioning program at Prep and was instrumental in designing the current weight training facility. Coach Shea worked as the unofficial athletic trainer from 1978-1997 before it became a more formal role, which he served until 2006. From 1998-2008 Coach Shea was the Assistant Athletic Director and oversaw athletic facilities from 2006-2008; he then became the manager of the Hanley Center for Athletic Excellence before his retirement from Prep.\n\nJ. McCauley Brown '71\n\nOne of the unsung heroes on one of the most accomplished athletic teams in Georgetown Prep history, J. McCauley “Mac” Brown '71 starred on the great varsity football team of 1970 and was a key player on one of the best offensive lines in school history. A boarding student from Harrods Creek, Kentucky, Brown was a three-year varsity letter winner and a two-year starter at offensive guard.

Little led Prep to a 6-1-1 overall record and ranked ninth in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan area. As a senior, Little ran for over 1,000 yards in eight games and led Prep to a 7-1 record and ranked seventh in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan area.
