He was the winning pitcher in game four against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Stoddard also drove in a run with an eighth-inning single, becoming the first player in World Series history to drive in a run in his first at-bat. He went on to win a Division Championship with the Cubs in 1984, played with the San Diego Padres from 1985-1986, the New York Yankees from 1986-1988, and finished his career with the Cleveland Indians in 1989.\n\nHe also served as a Technical Consultant and appeared in the 1993 film Rookie of the Year.\n\nSince retiring from Major League Baseball, Stoddard has been actively coaching, including a 22-year stint as the pitching coach at Division I Northwestern University.\n\nStoddard has had 25 MLB draft picks under his tutelage, including three currently playing in MLB in Toronto Blue Jays left-hander J.A. Happ and right-hander Bo Schultz, as well as San Francisco Giants right-hander George Kontos.\n\nStoddard will primarily be working with the pitching staff, but his vast knowledge and experience will be greatly beneficial to the team as a whole, learning from the best at baseball’s highest level.\n\nHe and his wife Jane have five children together, Laura, Anne, Ellen, Katie and Dan."
