        "text": "Jesse Chapman, 25, grew up in Palm Coast, Florida. The summer before high school, he joined Flagler-Palm Coast High School’s summer theater program. “It was one of the most important decisions I ever made,” he recalls. “Mary-Lou Beale’s summer theater program was paramount in me discovering who I was, and what I wanted to do in life.” He maintained a consistent theater career through high school, primarily receiving character-actor roles: Martin Vanderhof in You Can’t Take it With You, Ben Weatherstaff in The Secret Garden, Cornelius in Hello, Dolly!, and Giles Corey in The Crucible. For his role as Cornelius, Jesse gained Seaside Music Theater’s attention and they awarded him their esteemed Blazing Star Award. After high school, Jesse attended the University of Central Florida and majored in Film Production. He directed numerous short films, most of which were accepted into film festivals across the nation. His senior thesis film, The Exposition Report, won for best comedy at the Hyart Film Festival. Jesse currently resides in Hollywood, California and works in the editorial department on the Emmy-winning HBO show Entourage and plans to become a film and television editor."
