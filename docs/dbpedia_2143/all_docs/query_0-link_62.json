        "text": "1834\n\nAntoine Peychaud (1803-1883) establishes his own apothecary at 123 Royal Street in New Orleans (known as 437 Royal Street today), where he sells “the best bitters, peppermint and alcohol” to local coffee houses for use in their cocktails.\n\n1839\n\nThe ﬁrst known ad for Sazerac de Forge et Fils Cognac in the U.S. appears in Philadelphia’s National Gazette. For many years Sazerac and other Cognacs were advertised as brandies.\n\n1852\n\nThe Sazerac House, a coffee house located next to the Merchants Exchange, and its proprietor, Aaron Bird (1793-1864) are first mentioned in the local press. There are many indications that Sewell Taylor was the financial backer or perhaps the actual owner of the Sazerac House. This ad shows that he was the legal representative, the “Syndic” for the creditors of the bankrupt Armstrong’s which became the Sazerac House shortly after.\n\n1860\n\nAfter Aaron Bird’s death, J.B. Schiller, a local importer of Sazerac de Forge Et fils brandy, takes over as proprietor of the Sazerac House. He expands the footprint of the property to include the building next door at 11 Exchange Place and uses it as a stockroom. That same year Schiller hires Thomas H. Handy as a clerk at the Sazerac House.\n\n1869\n\nThomas H. Handy (1839-1893), who had been working at the Sazerac House since 1865, and several other employees from Thos. H. Handy & Co. buy the Sazerac House from Schiller who was in bad health and passed away shortly after.\n\n1878\n\nAfter Handy loses his money in bad railroad investments, he is forced to dissolve Thos. H. Handy Co., though he maintains control of Peychaud’s bitters. Shortly after, Vincent Micas buys out Thomas Handy becoming the owner of the Sazerac House, the sole agent for Sazerac de Forge et Fils brandy and the owner of Peychaud’s Bitters. This begins a bitter battle between Handy and Micas for control of the Sazerac House and Peychaud’s bitters.\n\n1882\n\nIn March, Vincent Micas loses his lease of the Sazerac House and the building is demolished. He opens “the old Sazerac” bar room and liquor store at the intersection of Common and Camp streets. In October of the same year, Thomas Handy rebuilds and reopens the Sazerac House at its original location on Exchange Place to much fanfare.\n\n1919\n\nThe 18th Amendment calling for Prohibition is ratified in January 1919 and takes effect in January 1920. Realizing the impending threat of Prohibition, the Thomas H. Handy & Co. Inc. reincorporates as the Sazerac Company, Inc. with plans to manufacture, buy and sell groceries, candy, soft drinks, dairy products and to operate restaurants. Only a deli and a French restaurant are known to have materialized.\n\n1933\n\nProhibition is repealed. In December, the Sazerac Company gets back in the liquor business by opening a bar and lunchroom, a wholesale and retail headquarters, and a manufacturing and bottling facility in New Orleans. The Company also renews its trademark for the Sazerac Cocktail and begins producing and bottling it in their new facilities.\n\n1952\n\nSazerac launches Taaka vodka, one of the first vodkas to be sold in the U.S., which then goes on to become one of Sazerac’s most successful brands.\n\n1992\n\nThe Sazerac Company and TaKaRa Shuzo, Inc. reach an agreement by which Sazerac acquires the Leestown Co. and the George T. Stagg Distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky. The distillery boasts acres of scenic land on the Kentucky River and historic warehouses and production buildings dating back to the late-1700s.\n\n2016\n\nReturning to its roots in France, the Sazerac Company purchases Breuil de Segonzac, a French Cognac distillery, reconnecting with its early history with Sazerac de Forge et Fils brandy and Cognac.\n\nAdditionally, the purchase of Southern Comfort brought the brand back to its Southern roots and restored the New Orleans connection.\n\n2018\n\nFor the first time in decades, Canadian whisky is distilled in Montreal at Sazerac’s Old Montreal Distillery.\n\nThe Sazerac Company also closes the year with the purchase of 19 Brands from Diageo."
