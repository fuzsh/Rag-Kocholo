        "text": "A Chronicle of the\n\nPhiladelphia Section PGA and its Members\n\nby Peter C. Trenham\n\n1940 to 1949\n\nContents\n\n1940 Hershey CC hosted PGA and Section member Sam Snead lost in final to Byron Nelson\n\n1941 The Section hosted PGA of America 25th anniversary dinner, Dudley elected president\n\n1942 Sam Snead won PGA at Seaview, 9 Section members qualified for the 32-man field\n\n1943 The Section built a golf course for the WW II wounded vets at VF General Hospital\n\n1944 The Section was now providing golf for 5 military hospitals in the Delaware Valley\n\n1945 Hogan, Snead and Nelson, won 29 of 38 tournaments held on the PGA Tour that year\n\n1946 Ben Hogan won 12 events on the PGA Tour the PGA Championship\n\n1947 CC of York pro E.J. “Dutch” Harrison won Reading Open, plus two more tour titles\n\n1948 Marty Lyons elected secretary of PGA. Ben Hogan won PGA and US Open\n\n1949 In January Hogan won twice and then with a bus in west Texas almost ended his life\n\n1940\n\nThe 1940s began with Ed Dudley, Philadelphia Country Club professional, in his sixth year as the Section president. The first vice-president and tournament chairman, Marty Lyons, agreed to host the Section Championship for the fifth year in a row at the Llanerch Country Club. The British Open was canceled due to war in Europe.\n\nThe third Senior PGA Championship was held in mid January. The tournament was moved from December to January so there wasn’t a Senior PGA Championship in 1939. It was played at the Bobby Jones Golf Club in Sarasota, Florida in hopes of having better weather than they had had in Augusta, Georgia. A playoff was needed as Jock Hutchison and Otto Hackbarth were tied at the end of the 36 holes of regulation play with 146s. An 18-hole playoff was held and the two pros were still tied after shooting 74s. A second 18-hole playoff was held and Hackbarth came out on top by one stroke with a 74 against a 75 for Hutchison. Hackbarth’s rounds were 76-70 and the 70 was the low round of the tournament. Charlie Mayo and Fred Miley tied for third at 148. Old York Road professional, Jack Campbell tied with Jim Barnes, the former Section member, for fifth place with 149s. Campbell also won his age group, 55-59. George Morris (151), the professional at the Colonial Country Club in Harrisburg, tied for seventh and Sunnybrook Golf Club professional, Frank Coltart (155) tied for 16th.\n\nIn late January Ed Oliver won the Crosby Pro-Am at the Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club near San Diego. Oliver put together rounds of 68 and 67 on the 6,800-yard course for a nine under par 135. He won $500 as he finished three strokes in front of Vic Ghezzi (138). Ben Hogan and Jug McSpaden tied for third with 139s. After the tournament Bing Crosby hosted all of the contestants, pros and amateurs, at his Del Mar Turf Club.\n\nThe next week, in early February, Ed Oliver won again. This victory came at the Phoenix Country Club in the two-day $3,000 Phoenix Open. Oliver opened with a 69 the first day and then he posted a 72 in morning of the second day. Ben Hogan, who was still looking for his first official win on the PGA Tour, finished at 206. Everyone was congratulating Hogan on his victory but Oliver came in with a seven under par 64, which was a course record. That put him in the clubhouse with a 205 total that won by one stroke. Leonard Dodson and Clayton Heafner tied for third with 207s. First prize was $700.\n\nTwo new members of the Section were Sam Snead and Jimmy McHale. The 27-year old Snead had been signed on by the Shawnee Inn & Country Club to represent them on the PGA Tour. One of the best young players on the PGA Tour, he had been on the Ryder Cup Team in 1937. In 1938 he won the Canadian Open and was the leading money winner on tour. He replaced Jimmy Thomson, the longest driver on the PGA Tour, who had held the position from 1936 through 1939. Thomson was still a member of the Section but he was concentrating on playing exhibitions for the Spalding Sporting Goods Company. McHale had been hired by Ed Dudley to replace Sam Byrd who had moved over to the Merion Cricket Club as George Sayers’ teaching and playing pro. J. Howard Pew, a member of Merion and president of the Sun Oil Company, paid Byrd’s salary while he worked at Merion.\n\nNine Philadelphia Section professionals were invited to the Masters Tournament in early April. Jimmy Demaret was the winner by four strokes over Lloyd Mangrum (284) and five over Byron Nelson (285) with rounds of 67, 72, 70 and 71 for a 280 total. First prize was still $1,500. The course was a symmetrical 3,400 yards going out with a par of 36 and 3,400 yards coming back and also par 36. Mangrum took the lead by three strokes the first day with a course record 64. No one broke 70 the last day. Host professional Ed Dudley, Willie Goggin and Harry Cooper tied for fourth at 287. Sam Snead, Henry Picard, the professional at the Hershey Country Club, and Craig Wood tied for seventh at even par 288. Sam Byrd (292),Ed Oliver (294), who was playing the PGA Tour between pro jobs, Jimmy Thomson (301) and Felix Serafin (308), the professional at the Scranton Country Club, were out of the money. Leo Diegel, the head professional at the Philmont Country Club and his assistant Matt Kowal were invited but they didn’t play in the tournament.\n\nOn the third Monday of April the Section’s spring meeting was at Raymond’s Restaurant in Philadelphia. Section president Ed Dudley, was back from Augusta National and presided at the meeting. The members decided to invite apprentices with two years of eligibility toward PGA membership, to play in all the Section tournaments except the championship. At the Section’s 1939 fall meeting the members had decided to put together a plan to promote junior golf in the Philadelphia Section. The plan was to have buttons made with the inscription “PGA HONORARY MEMBER”. The buttons were sold for $1 to amateur golfers in the area to promote the junior program. The newspapermen agreed to give it their full support, which was a big help. Four pro-junior tournaments were held in 1940, two for boys and two for girls. The money derived from the sale of the buttons was used to put on the pro-juniors, provide free instruction for juniors and cover any other costs associated with the program. Every junior who played in the pro-junior tournaments received a prize.\n\nIn mid May the Section held its second annual PGA Golf Week. Tournaments were held, exhibitions were played and the radio stations all helped with the promotion of the golf week. Ed Dudley and Jimmy D’Angelo, the professional at the Baederwood Golf Club, visited several clubs to give talks and show movies promoting golf.\n\nQualifying for the US Open was held at 25 locations in the country on the last Monday in May. Seven players from the Philadelphia Section were exempt from qualifying for being in the top 30 the year before. They were Sam Snead, Ed Dudley, Henry Picard, Sam Byrd, Matt Kowal, Ed Oliver and Felix Serafin. There were 82 pros and amateurs competing for ten spots in Philadelphia at the Torresdale-Frankford Country Club. Seaview Country Club professional Bruce Coltart led the qualifying by three over Ted Turner (142), the playing pro from the Pine Valley Golf Club, with a 72-67 for 139. The others were Newark Country Club professional Dave Douglas (145), Plymouth Country Club professional Terl Johnson (146), Jack Grout (147) now the professional at the Irem Temple Country, Holmesburg Country Club professional Gene Kunes (148), Saucon Valley Country Club professional Ralph Hutchison (149), Philadelphia Country Club assistant professional Joe Ludes (149) along with amateurs Harry Haverstick and Dick Chapman.\n\nJimmy Thomson qualified for the US Open in New York on the last Monday of May. Qualifying was held at the Mount Vernon Country Club. Al Brosch led the qualifying for 17 spots with a 140. Thomson finished tied for second at 143. Al Brosch was low with a 140. A score of 149 won the last spots.\n\nThe Section’s Pro-Lady Championship was first played in 1924 and over the years it had evolved from a one-day tournament to a three-day event. One thing that stayed the same was that the format was scotch foursomes. In the first week of June the tournament was held at the Huntingdon Valley Country Club. The teams qualified on Monday morning and after the flights of eight were sorted out the first round matches were played that afternoon. Two rounds were played on Tuesday and the final was held on Sunday. Two of the Philadelphia Section’s biggest names wound opposing each other on Sunday. The host professional, Joe Kirkwood, Sr., and his partner Mrs. Frank O’Neil were playing the Ed Dudley–Helen Sigel team. The Dudley team was three down with five holes to play, but they made four straight birdies to take a one-up lead. The Dudley team now held a one-up lead as they drove from the 18th tee, the Kirkwood team won the hole with a par to send the match into a sudden-death playoff. The Kirkwood team was three under par for the 18 holes but that wasn’t good enough to win. On Huntingdon Valley’s first hole the pros played their lady’s drives. Dudley put his shot eight feet from the hole and Kirkwood’s shot ended up in a greenside bunker. Dudley and Sigel’s par won the match. By the time the match ended there were 300 spectators.\n\nThe US Open was at the Canterbury Country Club near Cleveland in early June. The Philadelphia Section had sixteen of its professionals in the starting field. For the first time the players were paired in threes for the first two rounds. They played the last day in twos. Lawson Little (70) beat Gene Sarazen (73) in an 18-hole playoff for the title. They had tied with one-under-par 287s. Little’s rounds were 72, 69, 72 and 72. On the next to last hole of regulation play Sarazen holed a 30-foot-putt with a lump of mud on the side of the ball. The players weren’t allowed to clean their golf balls even on the green. Playing the double round of 36 holes on Saturday, Ed Oliver and five other players went out to the first tee after lunch for their final 18 holes. The official starter wasn’t there and the weather was threatening. Already having their scorecards for the final round the six professionals, Dutch Harrison (218), Duke Gibson (222), Ky Lafoon (227), Herman Keiser (230), Claude Harmon (230) and Oliver (216) teed off ahead of their assigned starting times. For most of the six men, the most important thing left to play for that day was a top 30 finish that would qualify them for the 1941 US Open, but Oliver was in contention. A round of 70 that morning had given him a total of 216, just three strokes off the lead. Oliver, in the second group teed off 17 minutes ahead of his tee time of 12:37. When informed that he might be in violation of the tournament rules Oliver and his two fellow competitors waited on the tee until their prescribed time before heading down the first fairway to play their second shots to the green. Early in their rounds the six players were told by a USGA official they were facing disqualified for teeing off before their scheduled tee times. With that they choose to play the round under protest. Oliver shot a 71 and finished in a three-way tie for first with Little and Sarazen, but he and the five others were disqualified. In the first round on Thursday Walter Hagen had been 15 minutes late for his tee time but the USGA had allowed him to tee off without penalty, even though his group was already on the first green. With a final round of 69 Horton Smith finished third at 288 and Craig Wood was next with a 289. Six of the Philadelphia Section’s professionals finished in the money at Canterbury. Ed Dudley (292) led the Section pros with a tenth place tie winning $137.50 and Henry Picard (293) tied for 12th. Gene Kunes and Sam Snead were in a group tied for 16th with 295s and each won $50. Felix Serafin (296) tied for 20th, winning $50. Bruce Coltart (300) won $30 for a tie for 29th, which was last money. Matt Kowal (301) and Sam Byrd (302) also made the cut. Jack Grout, Ralph Hutchison, Ted Turner, Terl Johnson, Jimmy Thomson, Joe Ludes and Dave Douglas missed the cut. First prize was $1,000 and the total purse was $6,000.\n\nA rumor was going around that a new hot ball was being used by some of the entrants. The USGA stated that the only rule concerning the ball was that it might not weight more than 1.62 ounces or be less than 1.68 inches in diameter. They stated that tests on the balls would be done later in Chicago. Henry Picard stated that there was a new ball out and he intended to acquire some of them. He said the ball was perfectly legal but it would require a complete makeover of his game. He said the new ball demanded that a stiff shaft club be used, while most of the pros used clubs with plenty of whip.\n\nThe next week the big stars were in Ohio for the $6,500 Inverness Four-Ball. Sam Snead teamed up with Ralph Guldahl to pick up another PGA Tour victory. They were plus 15 points for the seven rounds. Jimmy Demaret and Dick Metz (plus 12) were in second place three points back. Other Section members in the eight-team field were Henry Picard, Jimmy Thomson and Ed Dudley.\n\nA former US Open champion, Pittsburgh’s Sam Parks, Jr., won the Pennsylvania Open. It was held in mid June at the Edgewood Country Club in Pittsburgh. Parks won the $250 first prize with a 74-70 for an even par 144 and nipped Uniontown’s Art Clark (145) by one stroke. Gene Kunes and Matt Kowal led the Philadelphia pros tying for third. They shot 146 and won $87.50 apiece. There were ten money places.\n\nOn the fourth Friday of June Sam Snead returned to the Philadelphia Country Club on year after tossing away a great opportunity to win the US Open. The occasion was an exhibition to raise money for the French War Relief Fund. Snead and Ben Hogan took on the team of Ed Oliver and Gene Sarazen. Snead got a bit of revenge by carding a six under par 64 that was finished off with a birdie four on the 18th hole, which was half the strokes he had used up on that hole on the last round of the 1939 US Open. Snead and Hogan won 4-up.\n\nOn the third Monday of July Ed Dudley won his fourth Philadelphia Open at the Whitemarsh Valley Country Club. For the first time since 1912 the tournament was contested at 36 holes instead of 72. Dudley outscored 80 pros and amateurs to win the $200 first prize with a pair of 71s for a two-under-par 142. Gene Kunes (143) was in second place one stroke back and one stroke ahead of Matt Kowal (144). Cooper River Golf Club professional Charlie Arena finished fourth at 146 one stroke ahead of George Fazio (147) who was now the professional at the Glendale Golf Club, Bruce Coltart (147) and amateur Dick Chapman (147). There were ten money prizes and the purse totaled $575.\n\nIn mid July the Ryder Cup team that had been selected in late 1939, played a match a match for charity against a challenge team led by Gene Sarazen. Sarazen, who had been left off the Ryder Cup team for the first time, had proclaimed that he could field a team, which he named, that was better than the US Ryder Cup team. One flaw in that, was that there were three members of Sarazen’s team who had not been born in the United States and not eligible for the US team. The match was played near Detroit at the Oakland Hills Country Club. With all matches scheduled for 36 holes, the Cup team eked out a victory, 7 points to 5. Ed Oliver, Jimmy Thomson, Ben Hogan and Lawson Little were on Sarazen’s team of challengers Hogan was victorious in both the foursomes match and his singles match. Oliver won his singles match over Jimmy Hines by 8&7. Sam Snead lost to Hogan 2-down. Henry Picard won both of his matches as he defeated Gene Sarazen in their singles match by 8&7. Byron Nelson and Jug McSpaden won their foursomes match over Thomson and Tommy Armour by 8&7. $18,500 was raised for the Red Cross. Hagen and Sarazen also had a side bet of $1,000 which went to the Red Cross.\n\nThe British Open was also a casualty of war in Europe. It was canceled for 1940 and was not played again until 1946.\n\nHuntingdon Valley Country Club assistant Charlie Sheppard won the Central Pennsylvania Open on the first Monday of August. He broke Byron Nelson’s Reading Country Club tournament record from the previous year by two strokes with rounds of 67 and 68 for a seven-under-par 135. Nelson didn’t defend his title, as he was now the pro at the Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio. Finishing five strokes back in second place was The Springhaven Club’s playing professional Bud Lewis (140). He was one stroke ahead of Charlie Schneider (141) the professional at the Concord Country Club. There was a four-way tie for fourth. The host pro Henry Poe, Ed Dudley, Gene Kunes and Fred Johnson the assistant pro at the Philadelphia Cricket Club all posted 142s. Johnson was Terl Johnson’s brother. First prize was $100 and 15 pros cashed a check.\n\nThe PGA Championship returned to the Section at the Hershey Country Club and the Philadelphia Section had seven places to qualify for. The Section qualifying was held at the Paxon Hollow Country Club on the second Monday in August. Ted Turner was the low qualifier with a nine-under-par (69-66) 135. Charlie Sheppard was second with a 136 and Jimmy Thomson finished third at 137. Walter Brickley, the professional at the Riverton Country Club, and Bruce Coltart tied for fourth with 138s. Five professionals tied at 139 for the last two qualifying places in their national championship. In an 18-hole playoff the next morning Ed Dudley and George Fazio secured the last two places. Dudley shot a ten-under-par 62 which was thought to be the lowest competitive round ever shot in the Philadelphia area, pro or amateur, and Fazio’s score was 65. The three that didn’t make it were Gene Kunes (71), Matt Kowal (73) and Jimmy D’Angelo (74). Leo Diegel was exempt as a former PGA champion and Sam Snead had an exemption as a member of the Ryder Cup team. Henry Picard was exempt as the defending champion and the host professional. To commemorate the accomplishment of qualifying the Section gave medals to each of the successful qualifiers.\n\nSam Snead got married on Monday and won the Canadian Open that week. The championship was held in mid August at Toronto. At the end of the 72 holes of regulation play Sam Snead and Jug McSpaden were tied for the top spot with three under par 281s. Snead had led by five after 36 holes (67-66) 133, but he faltered the last day with rounds of 75 and 73 that allowed McSpaden to catch him. The final round was played on Saturday and the playoff was held on Monday. Snead (71) prevailed by one stroke in the playoff to capture his second Canadian Open when McSpaden (72) missed a two-foot putt on the final green. First prize was $1,000 and second paid $600. Ray Mangrum (283) was two shots back in third place and one ahead of Ralph Guldahl (284).\n\nEd Oliver won the $7,500 St. Paul Open at the Keller Course in the last week of July. Oliver put together rounds of 66, 71, 70 and 69 for a 276 total. Oliver birdied the last two holes to edge out Dick Metz (277) and Willie Goggin (277) by one stroke. Lawson Little and amateur Jim Ferrier tied for fourth at 278. First prize was $1,600.\n\nIn late August Henry Picard was both the host pro and the defending champion for the PGA Championship. Ten Section members were entered which included the seven qualifiers and three exempt professionals. At Hershey the pros had to qualify again to land a place in the 64-man match play. Picard (142), Ed Dudley (145), Sam Snead (147), George Fazio (148), Charlie Sheppard (150) and Jimmy Thomson (153) qualified. Leo Diegel, Bruce Coltart, Walter Brickley and Ted Turner failed to qualify. In the first round Thomson lost to Alex Gerlak one-down and Fazio lost to Ray Mangrum 3&2. Sheppard won his first round match over Gene Marchi 4&3 and then lost to Snead by 3&2 in the second round. The first two rounds were 18-hole matches. Picard and Dudley each won two matches before losing. Picard eliminated Leonard Gallett 6&4 and then he put out Gerlak 4&3. Dudley beat Henry Bontempo 5&4 and John Gibson 2&1. Snead kept on winning all the way to the finals where he met Byron Nelson. On Saturday the day of the 36-hole semifinal matches only 18 holes were played due to very heavy rains. The second eighteen was played on Sunday with the finals rescheduled for Monday, which was Labor Day. Nelson finished birdie-birdie-par to outlast Snead by a one-up margin to win another major championship. On the way to the finals Snead beat Nelson Giddens 2&1, Sheppard, Jimmy Hines 7&6, Gene Sarazen one-down and Jug McSpaden 5&4. Nelson beat Ralph Guldahl in semifinals 3&2. The purse was $11,050.\n\nThe next week the tour moved to the Country Club of Scranton for the $5,000 Anthracite Open. The tournament was preceded by a driving contest on Thursday, which Jimmy Thomson won. He took both of the top prizes, one ton of anthracite coal for each. His three drives totaled 863 yards and his longest was 290. Sam Snead was second with a total of 800 yards and Ed Oliver was third at 794.\n\nHenry Pickard was the defending champion again this week at the Anthracite Open, having won the inaugural one the previous year with a seven under-par 273. The results were reversed from the week before as Sam Snead turned in rounds of 65, 73, 68 and 70 for a 276, to finish two strokes in front of Byron Nelson (278). Lawson Little finished third at 279. Ed Dudley and Ed Oliver tied for fourth with 281s. The host professional, Felix Serafin had a 66 in the opening round and finished sixth at 282. Picard (283) tied for seventh, Sam Byrd (286) tied for 11th and Jack Grout (287) tied for 15th. First prize was $1,200. The total purse was $5,000, which was about average for a regular weekly tournament on the PGA Tour at that time.\n\nOn the second Monday of September the Wood Memorial was held at the Jeffersonville Golf Club. The tournament ended in a tie as George Fazio and Charlie Sheppard posted 68s. There was no playoff. Ed Oliver, who was playing the PGA Tour most of the time, finished one stroke back in third place with a 69. Even though Oliver was connected to a club in western New York, he was still affiliated with the Philadelphia PGA Section. Joe Ludes, Carmen Steppo, an assistant pro at the Wilmington Country Club, and Joe Zarhardt, who was back in the Section and the host professional, tied for fourth with even par 70s. First place money was $50 from the $150 purse.\n\nOn the second Friday of September the one-day South Jersey Open was held at the Atlantic City Country Club. Two pros from outside the Section, Vic Ghezzi and Horton Smith tied for first with 140s. They posted identical rounds of 71 in the morning and 69 in the afternoon. There was no playoff and the two pros each received $225. Tied for third one stroke back were Jimmy Thomson (141), Charlie Sheppard (141) and amateur James “Sonny” Fraser (141) of the home club. Jimmy McHale (143) was alone in sixth place. Ted Turner, Sam Byrd and Ed Oliver tied for seventh with 144s. Tying for tenth and finishing in the money at 145 were Matt Kowal, Ray Mangrum, Ky Laffoon, Ralph Beach and Dick Renaghan, who was now the professional at the Woodcrest Country Club.\n\nGeorge Fazio and Jimmy McHale won the Section’s pro-pro championship. Later that year McHale applied for reinstatement as an amateur. After World War II he was one of the leading amateurs in Philadelphia and the United States.\n\nWorld War II was on the horizon and the people in the United States were doing whatever they could to help their friends in Europe. On September 15th an exhibition was played at Philadelphia Country Club’s Spring Mill Course. A gallery of 5,000 turned out to see Bing Crosby and Ed Dudley play a better ball match against Jimmy Thomson and Horton Smith for the benefit of the British War Relief Society. It was one of the largest turnouts to see a golf match in years. Between golf shots Crosby signed autographs on golf balls and anything else that the fans put in front of him.\n\nThe Section Championship was held the next week in September. For a fifth straight year the Llanerch Country Club hosted the tournament. It was all Matt Kowal. He won the medal, qualifying with a 71 and a 65. His 136 set a new standard for the Section Championship 36-hole qualifying round, breaking Byron Nelson’s record 137, which was shot at Llanerch the previous year. The 65 was a Llanerch course record as well. Ed Dudley was next with a 139 and Clarence Ehresman, the professional at the Ashbourne Country Club, was third at 140. Jimmy Thomson qualified but he didn’t play in the match play. Thirty-two players qualified for the match play as the 153s played off for the last spots. The defending champion Charlie Schneider and the host pro Marty Lyons were exempt. On Sunday Kowal defeated Dudley in a 36-hole final before a gallery estimated at 1,500. On the last green Kowal holed a ten-foot putt for a birdie to win 1-up. As the medalist he received the Evening Ledger Cup and as the Section champion he received the Bulletin Cup, which was awarded for the first time that year. Kowal reached the finals by defeating Gene Kunes in the semi-finals 3&2. In the other semi-final match Dudley beat Schneider 5&4.\n\nThe annual meeting of the Section was held at Raymond’s Restaurant on the third Monday in October. Ed Dudley was elected president for an unprecedented seventh year. He was also still a vice-president of the PGA of America. Marty Lyons was reelected first vice president and the Beverly Hills Country Club professional Ted Bickel, Jr. was elected second vice president. Jimmy D’Angelo was reelected secretary and Walter Brickley was elected treasurer for the sixth consecutive year. The Section’s members decided to continue with the junior program and the sale of the buttons. They knew that junior golf had benefited and these juniors would be future club members. It kept the words “junior golfer” and “PGA” in front of the adult golfers during the entire season and generated enthusiasm among the various clubs. At the meeting the members were notified that the entire membership would receive a questionnaire asking for suggestions concerning junior golf and other programs that might benefit the Section.\n\nThe PGA of America’s annual meeting was held at the Morrison Hotel in Chicago during the second week of November. An innovation at the meeting was the informal meeting of the delegates prior to the regular meeting. The delegates discussed the numerous resolutions and the next day they were ready to vote which resulted in time saved for other matters. One resolution that passed created a vice-president for each of the PGA Districts. Each District was made up of three PGA Sections. For the first time each District elected their vice-president to represent them on the Executive Committee. Before that the VPs were elected by the PGA of America executive committee, which was composed of the national officers and the VPs. Tom Walsh was unanimously reelected president and a former Section member Frank Sprogell was elected secretary. Sprogell won out over the incumbent Captain Charles R. Clark by one vote (35 to 34). Sprogell had worked in the Section when Philadelphia was part of the Southeastern Section. Willie Maguire was reelected treasurer. Ed Dudley was the tournament chairman for a fourth consecutive year and he reported to the delegates that the contract of Fred Corcoran, the tournament bureau manager, had been renewed. Leo Diegel and Sam Snead were on Dudley’s committee. The PGA Tour had played 26 tournaments for $160,000 during the past 12 months and attracted 500,000 spectators. Sponsored tournaments had donated $50,000 to the Red Cross treasury that year. Seventeen events had been lined up for the upcoming Winter Tour. The entry fees were $1 per $1,000 in the tournament purse. Caddy fees were $1 to $1.50 per round. It was estimated that it cost about $10 a day to play the PGA Tour. The PGA announced that it was starting a Hall of Fame. The selection committee was made up of four sportswriters, the chairman Grantland Rice, O.B. Keeler, Kerr Petrie and A. Linde Fowler. The delegates from the Philadelphia Section were Jimmy D’Angelo and Dick Henkel, the professional at the Schuylkill Country Club.\n\nThe PGA’s winter tour began in Pinehurst, North Carolina with the Mid-South Open at Pinehurst Country Club’s No. 2 course. Ed Oliver and Clayton Heafner won the preliminary two-day better ball tournament with rounds of 64 and 68. Their 12 under par 132 won by five strokes over an all amateur team of Jim Ferrier and Dick Chapman, the US Amateur champion. Oliver and Heafner each won $250. The 36-hole open tournament was played the next day with 76 entries. Sam Snead and Chapman posted identical scores of 70 and 73 to tie for first at 143. There was no playoff. First prize was $350. Oliver and Vic Ghezzi tied for third one stroke back at 144. They each won $225. The talk of the day was a morning round course record of 69 (38-31) turned in by future Section member Rod Munday. He faded in the afternoon to a tie for 14th. No one else broke 70 in the tournament.\n\nThe leading money winner and scoring average leader was Ben Hogan. The Vardon Trophy was figured on a point system and Hogan led with 423 points. Sam Snead was second with 390 points. Hogan won $10,655, Byron Nelson was second with $9,653 and Snead was next with $9,206. Ed Oliver was 11th with $4,725. Hogan’s scoring average was 70.53 for 75 tournament rounds. Hogan finished in the money in all of the 23 tournaments that he entered that year. He won four times and three wins came back to back to back. There were 26 tournaments on the PGA Tour that year and the purses totaled $160,000.\n\nBack to Top\n\n1941\n\nFormer Philadelphia professional, Jack Burke, Sr., won Senior PGA Championship on the second weekend in January. The seniors were back in Sarasota, Florida for their fourth annual championship. Burke’s (75-67) score of 142 for 36-holes, won by seven strokes. Par was 71. Eddie Williams finished second at 149. Jock Hutchison, Jack Gordon and H.C. Hackbarth tied for third with 150s. Frank Coltart and George Morris tied for 15th. Jack Campbell (159) finished second to Gil Nicholls (157) in the 60-64-year-old age group.\n\nEarly that year George Izett moved his custom club making shop to 1035 Chestnut Street in Philadelphia. He formed a partnership with Bill Bailey and Al Allen. They called it Bailey, Allen & Izett, Inc. Bailey had been working for Wanamakers Department Store in Philadelphia running their golf department. When it came to golf, Wanamakers had been in both the retail and wholesale business importing golf equipment from Great Britain for sale in America. It was the Wanamaker family who had spearheaded the formation of the PGA in 1916 to improve their customer relations with the professionals. The Wanamakers put up cash and the trophy for the first PGA Championship. Now the store had decided to close its golf department. Bailey, Allen & Izett sold woods, the PGA ball, golf shoes and a complete line of golf accessories. They also sold the Walter Hagen golf clubs that were made in Michigan by the L.A. Young Company. The Izett clubs were sold all over the world. Izett made drivers for several United States presidents and many of the greatest playing professionals.\n\nEarly in 1941 the Selective Service Board was beginning to interfere with the careers of professional golfers as well as many other people. In late January Ed Oliver, still using Wilmington as his address even though he was the head professional in Hornell, New York, had to make a hurried trip home from the tour for his physical. Oliver drove home to Wilmington and then drove back across the country to play in the Crosby Pro-Am. He was Bing Crosby’s partner in the tournament and the defending champion. While Oliver was home his father had taken his clubs out of the car and stored them away. He didn’t know that his son was going to get a deferment and thought that he would not be playing golf for a while. Oliver arrived in California without any clubs and had to play with a borrowed set. At the tournament Ed Dudley gave Bing Crosby a plaque from the PGA for participating in six Red Cross matches sponsored by the PGA in 1940. Sam Snead won the 36-hole tournament, played at Rancho Sante Fe Golf Club, with a 67 and a 69 for a 136 total. There were over 300 entries and it took two days to play the first round. Craig Wood finished second at 137. This was Snead’s third Crosby Pro-Am victory and he had won every one he had played in. Jug McSpaden and Bill Nary tied for third with 138s.\n\nIn early February Ed Oliver (275) won the $5,000 Western Open in Phoenix beating Ben Hogan (278) and Byron Nelson (278) by three strokes. Oliver, who had won three times the year before, finished strong. In the morning of the last day he played the back nine in 30 for a 67 and he tacked on a 69 in the afternoon to win the $1,000 first prize. His first two rounds were 67 and 72. Johnny Bulla finished fourth at 280.\n\nHenry Picard grabbed the spotlight one last time for the Hershey Country Club by winning the $5,000 New Orleans Open in mid February. Picard toured the City Park Course in rounds of 72, 65, 66 and 73 for a total of 276 to finish two strokes in front of Ben Hogan (278). Picard broke the tournament record that he had set two years before, by eight strokes. The 65 was a course record also. Clayton Heafner finished third at 279. Jimmy Demaret, Toney Penna, Craig Wood and Ralph Guldahl tied for fourth with 284s. There were 168 entries and first prize was $1,200.\n\nIn mid February the PGA selected the Cherry Hills Country Club in Denver to host the PGA Championship. PGA president Tom Walsh made the announcement after polling the association’s executive committee.\n\nIn the last week of February Sam Snead handled cold gusty winds off the Gulf of Mexico to win the $5,000 St. Petersburg Open. Snead finished two strokes in front of other pros with rounds of 67, 72, 68 and 72 for a five-under-par 279. First prize was $1,200. Tying for second at 281 and winning $525 were Ben Hogan, Jug McSpaden, Barron and Chick Harbert. Sam Byrd (284) tied for sixth.\n\nIn the first week of March Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen won the International Four-Ball in Miami. The tournament began on a Sunday. The $5,000 tournament was held at the Miami Biltmore Hotel Course. All matches were 36 holes. Hogan and Sarazen each won $1,000 by defeating Sam Snead and Ralph Guldahl in the final 4&3. Hogan made seven birdies in the fourteen holes needed in the afternoon to finish the match.\n\nAt the International Four-Ball Ed Oliver was paired with Clayton Heafner where they defeated Harry Cooper and Jimmy Thomson in the first round as a result of a birdie by Oliver on the first extra hole. After the round Oliver received a telephone call from his brother, telling him that his hardship deferment had not been granted and he was to report for active duty at Ft. Dix the next morning. Heafner was given a substitute partner for the second round. Oliver hopped a plane for Wilmington, Delaware and was in the US Army that next day.\n\nIt was announced that on March 15, that Ben Hogan would be the professional at the Hershey Country Club. He was replacing his good friend Henry Picard, who had moved to Oklahoma. Due to problems with arthritis in his hands and a family of four children Picard wanted to reduce his tournament schedule and Milton Hershey wanted someone to represent Hershey and the Hershey Chocolate Company on the PGA Tour.\n\nSam Snead won the North and South Open at Pinehurst, North Carolina in the third week of March. Snead picked up his third victory of the year on the PGA Tour with rounds of 69, 66, 73 and 69 a record tying 277 on the Pinehurst #2 course. He tied Ben Hogan’s winning score from the year before and the 66 tied the course record that Hogan had set that same year. First prize was $2,000. Clayton Heafner finished second at 280. Willie Goggin finished third at 284. Byron Nelson and Lawson Little tied for fourth with 285s. Hogan (288) who was now officially the pro at Hershey Country Club and another Section member Terl Johnson (290) finished sixth and eighth.\n\nThe next week in March it was Ben Hogan’s turn to win as he won the $5,000 Land of the Sky Open in Asheville, North Carolina. Hogan was the defending champion and it took a very unusual finish to keep the title. After earlier rounds of 67 and 73 on the Biltmore Forest Country Club course he began the last day with a four-stroke lead. At the end of the morning round he had shot a 75 and now trailed Lawson Little by five strokes. In the afternoon Hogan put together a two-under-par 69 in spite of a four-putt green when two putts wouldn’t stop near the hole and kept rolling back to where he had putted. His 284 total finished two strokes in front of Lawson Little and earned him a check for $1,200. Lloyd Mangrum finished third at 289 and Craig Wood was next with a 290.\n\nThe PGA’s Hall of Fame selection committee, composed of sports writers and headed by Grantland Rice met at the Masters and announced their selections. These were the first inductees. That first class was Walter Hagen, Gene Sarazen, Bobby Jones and Francis Quimet. It was also announced that a PGA hall would be erected at Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nAfter several near misses Craig Wood came through with his first major victory at the Masters Tournament in the first week of April. Wood won by three strokes over Byron Nelson (283) with rounds of 66, 71, 71 and 72 for 280. First prize was still $1,500. The entry fee was $5. Sam Byrd (285), Ben Hogan (286) and Ed Dudley (288) finished third, fourth and fifth respectively and Sam Snead (289) tied for sixth. Jimmy Thomson (293) missed the money by one stroke. Gene Kunes (297), Felix Serafin (297) and Bruce Coltart (308) were also in the field.\n\nThe big employment news came in April when Section president Ed Dudley announced that he was resigning as the professional at the Philadelphia Country Club and would be leaving for a new summer head pro position at The Broadmoor. The Philadelphia Country Club had been putting pressure on him to be back from Augusta by April 1. Since the Masters was played in early April he had to make a choice between the two and his choice was the Augusta National Golf Club. Dudley would be at The Broadmoor from June 1 until after Labor Day. He was still a member of the Philadelphia PGA and president of the Section.\n\nFor the first time in a number of years Ed Dudley was not at the Section’s spring meeting. The meeting was at Raymond’s Restaurant in Philadelphia on the third Monday in April. The Section’s members decided that first vice president Marty Lyons would handle the presidential duties for Dudley in his absence along with continuing to be the tournament chairman, until the next election. At the meeting they also decided to hold two junior championships in addition to the pro-junior tournaments. There would be one for girls and one for boys. It was announced that the Philadelphia Open was being held at the Pine Valley Golf Club and the GAP had decided that the tournament would be open to all comers. Leo Diegel had been named the chairman of a committee to arrange for a PGA Silver Anniversary banquet in September to celebrate the founding of the PGA in 1916.\n\nIn early May the Section held their third annual PGA Golf Week. Pro-am tournaments were held for men and ladies, there were tournaments for junior golfers, and exhibitions were played. Patty Berg and Helen Detweiller put on a clinic at the City Line Driving Range that was operated by Bud Lewis and George Fazio. The next day Berg and Detweiller played an exhibition at the Huntingdon Valley Country Club where Joe Kirkwood, Sr. was the professional. On Saturday Ben Hogan and Kirkwood played an exhibition against Jimmy Thomson and Al MacDonald at the Langhorne Country Club where MacDonald was the professional. Kirkwood demonstrated his trick shots after the exhibition match.\n\nQualifying for the US Open was held at the Philadelphia Cricket Club’s Flourtown Course on the fourth Monday in May. The entry fee was $5. Joe Zarhardt led with a pair of 73s for 146. Sam Byrd was next at 147. George Fazio (150) now the playing professional at the Cedarbrook Country Club and the Yardley Country Club professional Tom O’Connor (150) earned the last two spots in a sudden death playoff with Joe Kirkwood, Sr. Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Ed Dudley, Gene Kunes, Bruce Coltart and Felix Serafin were exempt due to having been in the top 30 the previous year at Canterbury.\n\nAlso on the fourth Monday of May Jimmy Thomson qualified for the US Open. He was in New Jersey at the Ridgewood Country Club. Jimmy Demaret led 62 players in qualifying for 12 spots on Ridgewood’s East and West courses with a 140. Thomson turned in a 152 and lost a sudden death playoff to Jim Turnesa for the third alternate spot. As the fourth alternate Thomson got into the Open. For the first time all former US Open winners were given exemptions into the tournament.\n\nCraig Wood won his second major of the year at theUS Open in the first week of June. The Open was played at the Colonial Country Club in Ft. Worth, Texas. Wood won by three strokes over a former Section member, Denny Shute (287) with rounds of 73, 71, 70 and 70 for 284. First prize was $1,000 and second was $800. Ben Hogan (289) tied for third with Johnny Bulla (289) and won $650. Ed Dudley (295) tied for 10th winning $125 and Sam Snead (296) won $100 as he tied for 13th. Gene Kunes (299), Joe Zarhardt (302) and Sam Byrd (303) were also in the money and they made the top 30 to qualify for the next US Open. They each won $50. Felix Serafin (309) and Tom O’Connor (318) made the cut and played the 72 holes. Bruce Coltart (154) and George Fazio (156) made the cut and withdrew. Jimmy Thomson missed the cut.\n\nTwo days after the US Open ended the Pennsylvania Open was played at the Merion Cricket Club’s East Course. Gene Kunes, who had just completed 72 holes at Ft. Worth, with 36 on Saturday, came out on top. The tournament was scheduled for one day and 36 holes but Kunes needed two days and 72 holes to nail down the victory and the $250 first place check. At the end of 36 holes Kunes (73-77) and Terl Johnson (75-75) were tied with 150 totals. The next morning they played 18 holes and were still tied after shooting a pair of 75s. They went back out for another 18 holes and Kunes prevailed with a 74 against Johnson’s 78. Joe Kirkwood, Sr. (151) and Howard Everitt (151), a former Section assistant pro but now reinstated as an amateur, tied for third one stroke back. Tied for fifth were Jack Grout (152), now the professional at the Fox Hill Country Club, Lorman Kelley (152), the teaching professional at the Springfield Driving Range and William “Red” Francis (152), a former Section member. There were twelve money prizes.\n\nTwenty-six Section members were at the Lancaster Country Club on the third Monday in June to try and qualify for the PGA Championship. Bruce Coltart led the field with a pair of 70 for a four-under-par 140. Coltart was playing with his right foot taped up due to an injured tendon suffered in a fall the night before. Also qualifying were Jimmy Thomson (142), George Fazio (144), Gene Kunes (145), Jack Grout (145) and Ed Dudley (147), who got the last spot. Dudley, now working in Colorado but still a Section member, had to win a nine-hole playoff that same day over Joe Kirkwood, Sr. (147) and Henry Williams, Jr. (147) the professional at the Phoenixville Country Club. Dudley won the playoff with a 32. Sam Snead, Leo Diegel and Ben Hogan were exempt. Diegel, a two-time winner of the PGA didn’t enter the tournament. The entry fee was $5 and the qualifiers received mileage money unless they won more than that in the tournament.\n\nBen Hogan teamed up with Jimmy Demaret to win the Inverness Four-Ball at Toledo, Ohio in the third week of June. They finished with the highest number of points in the tournament history (plus 11) and three points ahead of the second place team of Jimmy Thomson and Byron Nelson.Sam Byrd was also in the field but Sam Snead had to withdraw three days before the tournament due to a back injury. The event was made up of eight two-man teams with every team playing a match against each of the other teams. They played seven rounds in four days. The winners each took away $1,000 from the $7,000 purse and the contestants received expense money for their room and meals. There were 25,000 spectators for the four days at $1 per person.\n\nThe size and the weight of the golf ball had been regulated since 1921 but now the USGA decided to limit the distance the ball traveled as well. In late June the USGA announced limitations on the speed of the golf ball. The new regulation would go into effect on January 1. The limit placed on the ball was that its velocity could not be greater than 250 feet per second when measured on the USGA’s driving machine. The USGA stated that it would standardize golf courses by controlling a factor that could distort the whole game.\n\nIn the first week of July the Section held a junior championship for boys and girls. Everyone was eligible whether he or she played at a private or public golf course. The Section officers were concerned that the kids might be away at camp but there were 125 entries. The contestants were placed in three classes, age 12 and under, thirteen to fifteen and sixteen to eighteen. A local newspaper awarded medals to the low gross winners and the Section presented the other winners with prizes.\n\nIn the second week of July the PGA Championship was played at the Cherry Hills Club near Denver. All eight Section members made it through the 36-hole qualifying. Sam Snead led the qualifying with a 138 and won custody of the Alex Smith Memorial Trophy for a year.

For another $13.75 a round-trip lower berth could be purchased.\n\nOn the second Monday of July the Philadelphia Open was held at the Pine Valley Golf Club for the second time in its 37-year history. Terl Johnson staged a big turnaround in the afternoon round to win the title and the $200 first prize. After a 78 in the morning he toured the course in 68 strokes in the afternoon, tying Ed Dudley’s 1939 course record. Johnson (146) edged out Bud Lewis (147), who had shot a 70 in the morning, by one stroke. Sam Byrd and Gene Kunes tied for third at 148. Joe Kirkwood, Sr. finished fifth with a 149, two strokes ahead of Paul Runyan (151), who was playing out of New York. The total purse came to $585.\n\nBen Hogan won the $5,000 Chicago Open at the Elmhurst Country Club in the third week of July. Hogan opened with a 66 and followed it up with a 70. The last day Craig Wood (276) put together two 67s but Hogan was able to hold him off with a pair of 69s for 274 and a two stroke win. Dick Metz finished third at 278 and Jim Ferrier was next at 284. First prize was $1,200.\n\nOn the fourth Friday of July, local qualifying was held for the Henry Hurst Invitation at Torresdale-Frankford Country Club, which is where the tournament would be held in September. There were 15 spots available for the professionals and six for the amateurs. In spite of two out-of-bounds tee shots on the 13th hole each round, Bruce Coltart led with rounds of 70 and 68. His six under par 138 led by five strokes and his afternoon 68 was just one stroke over the course record, which was held by Coltart. George Fazio, Fred Johnson and Johnny Markel, the 19-year-old son of the Berkshire Country Club professional Harry Markel tied for second with 143s. Jack Grout was fifth at 144. There was an eleven way tie for the last seven professional spots at 149. As they were preparing to begin a sudden death playoff, tournament sponsor Henry Hurst, said “Let them all in.”\n\nJoe Zarhardt won the Central Pennsylvania Open at the Reading Country Club on the first Monday in August. He put together a 68 and a 70 for a four-under-par 138 to edge out three players by one stroke. Tying for second with 139s were Bruce Coltart, Felix Serafin and amateur Johnny Markel. Coltart and Serafin tied Byron Nelson’s competitive course record with 65s in the morning round. The host professional Henry Poe and the Hershey Country Club assistant Chick Rutan tied for fifth with 140s.\n\nIn the second week of August an American won the Canadian Open for the twenty-seventh straight year. The tournament was held at the Lambton Club. Sam Snead repeated as the winner by two strokes with rounds of 71, 68, 66 and 69 for a six-under-par 274.

Denny Shute and Jug McSpaden tied for fourth with 288s.\n\nIn the fourth week of August the US. Ryder Cup team met Bobby Jones’s challengers in a two-day match at the Detroit Golf Club. Jones’ team was made up of all professionals. Jones, who had a line of Spalding golf clubs on the market, written books on golf and made a golf instruction movie, was no longer an amateur. The PGA had made him an honorary member. It was Walter Hagen’s last time as the captain of the Ryder Cup Team and it was Jones’ last competitive match. Hagen had been the captain of every Ryder Cup team since the matches were first played in 1927. Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Henry Picard and Jug McSpaden were members of the Ryder Cup Team. Ben Hogan, Ed Dudley, Lawson Little, Denny Shute and Gene Sarazen were on Jones’ challenge team. All matches were scheduled for 36 holes. At the end of the first day of five foursomes matches the Cup Team led 3 to 2. Hagen declared victory but the second day of singles matches was a different story. Jones came back from four down after nine holes to defeat Picard 2&1 and Hogan defeated Nelson 2-down. The challengers won four other singles and tied one for a final count of 8 1/2 points for the Challengers to 6 1/2 for the Cup Team. The match raised $18,221 for the Red Cross.\n\nIn early September Ben Hogan won the eighth annual Hershey Open. The host pro at the Hershey Country Club set a new tournament record with rounds of 69, 67, 69 and 70 for a 17-under-par 275. This score was five strokes lower than Henry Picard’s record setting score in 1937. This was Hogan’s fifty-fourth consecutive finish in the money and his check from the $5,000 purse was $1,200. He finished seven strokes in front of the second place Lloyd Mangrum (282). Jack Grout finished tied for third with Clayton Heafner with six-under-par 286s. Sam Snead, Felix Serafin, George Fazio and Denny Shute tied for fifth with 287s. Gene Kunes (288) was next in ninth place. Sam Byrd (293), Henry Poe (293) and Joe Kirkwood, Jr. (293) who was assisting his father Joe, Sr. at the Huntingdon Valley Country Club were among those who tied for fifteenth. There were fifteen money places and last place was worth $80.\n\nThe Wood Memorial, played at the Jeffersonville Golf Club on the second Monday of September, ended in a tie. Gene Kunes, Jimmie D’Angelo and Jimmy Lyons, who was an assistant to his brother Marty at the Llanerch Country Club, tied with three under par 67s. An 18-hole playoff was held two days later. In the playoff, Kunes shot a 70 to win with ease as D’Angelo and Lyons turned in 74s. First prize was $60 out of the $200 purse. Philadelphia Cricket Club assistant professional Fred Johnson, finished fourth with a 68.\n\nThe tour was at the Atlantic City Country Club for the $5,000 Atlantic City Open in mid September. Lloyd Mangrum’s thirteen-under-par 275 took away the $1,200 first prize beating Ben Hogan (281) and Vic Ghezzi (281) by six strokes. Jack Grout (282) finished one stroke further back in a tie for fourth with Lawson Little (282). Former Section member Denny Shute tied for sixth with Horton Smith and Toney Penna at 283. Sam Byrd and Corporal Ed Oliver, now stationed at Ft. Dix, New Jersey, tied for tenth with 287s. As the sole support of his parents Oliver had received a temporary deferment but in the end he was the first big name golf professional to be drafted. Also finishing in the money were Terl Johnson (290), Bud Lewis (291), Bruce Coltart (292), Dick Renaghan (295), Felix Serafin (296), Joe Zarhardt (296) and Clarence Ehresman (296). Twenty-five players finished in the money with the last nine professionals winning $25 each. Eleven Section members were in the money. The host professional was John Cressey.\n\nThe next week the tour was in Philadelphia for the first annual $5,000 Henry Hurst Invitation at the Torresdale-Frankford Country Club. The host professional was Jack Sawyer. Sawyer had been the professional at Torresdale- Frankford since 1912 and held the position for over 50 years. The tournament came about because Torresdale-Frankford needed to put a fence around their golf course and Henry Hurst, a member, told the club that if they would let him bring a PGA Tour event there he would make enough profit to put up the fence, and he did. In addition to the $5,000 tournament purse $2,000 extra was paid out for special feats during the practice rounds on Wednesday and Thursday. The entry fee was $5. A “season” ticket for the practice rounds and all tournament rounds cost $2.50. The daily tickets were $1.10. Enough tickets were sold before the tournament started to cover all the expenses of the tournament. Grandstands were placed at convenient places on the course for the spectators and a large scoreboard was erected opposite the eighteenth green.\n\nOn Saturday September 20, during the week of the Hurst Invitation, the Philadelphia Section celebrated the PGA of America’ Silver Anniversary. A banquet was held at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel with 800 in attendance. The success of the dinner was due to the efforts of the chairman Leo Diegel and Section secretary Jimmy D’Angelo who promoted and publicized the affair. The toastmaster was Henry McElmore, a nationally known sportswriter. Some of the honored guests were Ben Hogan, the leading money winner on the PGA Tour, and Bud Ward, US Amateur champion. Also attending the banquet were all the country’s leading pros including Section president Ed Dudley, who was back from The Broadmoor for the Hurst Invitation. The featured speakers were Tom Walsh, president of the PGA of America and Philadelphia’s John B. Kelly, director of the national physical education program called “Hale America”. Kelly stated that the reason for the program was that forty-five percent of the American youth were physically unfit for Army duty. Walsh said, in his speech, that the PGA of America and its two thousand members would unstintingly give their time and knowledge to further the program as it applied to golf.\n\nSam Snead won the Henry Hurst Invitational and the $1,500 first prize with an eight-under-par 272. He began with a 64 and followed it up with 74, 69 and 65. Dick Metz was a distant second nine shots back with 281 and Jimmy Demaret was third at 282. Two strokes further back and tied for fourth were Clayton Heafner (284) and Vic Ghezzi (284). The next lowest Philadelphia Section member was Terl Johnson who tied for sixth at 285 with Gene Sarazen, Byron Nelson, Horton Smith and Billy Burke. There were twelve money places and last money was $100. After being in the money in fifty-six straight PGA Tour events Ben Hogan missed the money by five shots with a 291. The last time he had missed the money was at the US Open at the Philadelphia Country Club’s Spring Mill Course in June 1939. Henry Hurst announced that the tournament would be held again the next year and the purse would be increased from $5,000 to $12,500.\n\nIn late September Sam Snead and Jimmy Demaret left for a two and one-half month tour of South America. The two professionals were sent by the PGA of America to participate in some of their championships and play exhibitions.\n\nAt the end of September fifty-three Section members were entered in their championship. Marty Lyons and the Llanerch Country Club hosted the tournament again. Bruce Coltart led the qualifying with a 72 and a 68 for a four-under-par 140 as the Section members competed for 32 places in the starting field. The players with totals of 155 played off for the last spot. In the 36-hole finals George Fazio defeated a former winner, Robert “Buzz “ Campbell, Old York Road Country Club assistant, by the count of 11&9. In the semi-finals Fazio had put out the medalist Coltart one-down and Campbell defeated Terl Johnson 3&2. The matches were played on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday with the 36-hole finals on Sunday. The defending champion Matt Kowal, now in the United States Army, was not able to defend his title.\n\nOn the last day of September the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Torresdale-Frankford Country Club and Henry Hurst had turned down an invitation from the USGA to bid on hosting the 1942 United States Open. Hurst stated that their invitational tournament offered better golf and more publicity for Philadelphia.\n\nAt the Section’s fall meeting Ed Dudley stepped down as the president after holding the office for seven years. The meeting was at Raymond’s Restaurant in Philadelphia on the third Monday of October. Marty Lyons was elected president after being a vice-president and tournament chairman for eight years. Even though Dudley wasn’t working in the Section he owned a home in Ardmore and was still a Section member. Dudley had been selected by the Section to represent the Philadelphia Section as the national vice-president representing the Philadelphia, Metropolitan and New Jersey Sections (District II). Lancaster Country Club professional A.B. Thorn was elected first vice president and Charlie Schneider was elected second vice president. Jimmy D’Angelo and Walter Brickley were returned to the offices of secretary and treasurer.\n\nOn the fourth Wednesday of October the South Jersey golf professionals took on the Pennsylvania professionals from the Philadelphia Section PGA in a challenge match called the Feud. The match was played at Riverton Country Club. There were fourteen professionals on each team. With 14 individual matches and 7 four-ball matches, points were awarded for each nine holes and the 18 hole match. A total of 63 points were being contested. The Pennsylvania professionals dominated the day winning 46 points to 17. The big winners for Pennsylvania were Ed Ginther (Hercules CC)-John Lewis (City Line DR) over Paul Midiri (Spring Hill GC)-Stanley Pokorsky (Merchantville CC), nine points and Harry Markel (Berkshire CC)-Pete Henry (Pro-golf sales) over Charles Mortimer (Linwood CC)-Nate Jervis (Moorestown Field Club), nine points. The Marty Lyons (Llanerch CC)-George B. Smith (Gulph Mills GC) team won 8 points over Henry Wetzel (Merchantville CC)-Tony Midiri (US Army). The Johnny Moyer (Shamokin Valley CC)-Dick Henkel (Schuylkill CC) team won 7-1/2 points from the Walter Brickley (Riverton CC)-Cas Banas (Burlington CC) team. The Ted Bickel (Beverly Hills CC)-Charlie Schneider (Concord CC) team won six points from the John Cressey (Atlantic City CC)-Charles Hoffner (Ocean City CC) team. Two New Jersey duos were on the plus side. Bruce Coltart (Seaview CC)-Dick Renaghan (Woodcrest CC) team won six points from the George Fazio (Cedarbrook CC)-Bud Lewis (The Springhaven Club) team. The Joe Zarhardt (Burlington CC)-Charlie Arena (Cooper River CC) team won 5-1/2 points from the Al MacDonald (Langhorne CC)-Jimmy D’Angelo (Baederwood CC) team. Even though Zarhardt, who had been the professional at Burlington CC, was now in Pennsylvania as the professional at Jeffersonville Golf Club he played for New Jersey because he still owned a home in Plainfield, New Jersey.\n\nThe PGA of America’s 25th annual national meeting was held at the Chicago Towers Club in Chicago during the second week of November. Ed Dudley was elected president of the PGA of America. He received 47 of the 70 votes cast. Frank T. Sprogell received the second most votes. Dudley was the first PGA national president to come from the ranks of the touring pros. Even though he had held head professional positions at several clubs he was considered a player. He planned to play a large part of the winter tour as usual. At that time almost all of the top-touring professionals held club jobs as well because it was difficult to make a living from tournament golf alone. He had been chairman of the PGA’s tournament committee for four years. Sprogell was reelected secretary and Willie Maguire was reelected treasurer. Dudley had been the Philadelphia Section’s choice to serve as national vice president, but when he was elected president, Jimmy D’Angelo took his place and was sworn in as the vice president for District II. PGA Districts had been created at the last national meeting and Philadelphia was in a district with the New Jersey and Metropolitan Sections. Each Section’s vice president would serve a three-year term but as this was a new program the Section with the first turn would have a one-year VP and the Section with the second turn would have a two-year term. It would be six years before the Philadelphia Section would be represented again. The delegates voted to tax each tour event 5% to take care of the tournament bureau’s expenses. In 1940 a PGA Hall of Fame had been created. At this meeting five more were added to the Hall. Two of the five new members inducted into the Hall of Fame, Willie Anderson and Johnny McDermott, had been employed in what was now the Philadelphia Section of the PGA. The other three inductees were Alex Smith, amateur Jerry Travers and amateur Chick Evans.Dudley and D’Angelo were the Section’s delegates to the meeting. The PGA, now 25 years old, had 2,041 members.\n\nA Ryder Cup team for 1942 was selected at the PGA’s national meeting in November. Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Jug McSpaden and Byron Nelson were selected for the ten-man team, which would be playing exhibitions for charity.\n\nAs the year came to a conclusion the leading money winner on the PGA Tour was Ben Hogan with winnings of $18,358. Sam Snead and Byron Nelson were second and third with more than $12,000 each. The touring pros had played for a record total of $202,000 that year and Hogan, Snead and Byron Nelson had won over $43,000 of the money. Hogan won three times and finished second eleven times. He was only out of the money one time and that was in Philadelphia. Hogan also won the Vardon Trophy for the second straight year. He won with 553 points, which was the most in the five-year history of the Vardon Trophy. Hogan’s scoring average was 70.28 for his 101 tournament rounds. Just like the money race, Snead and Nelson were second and third. They both also averaged less than 71 strokes per round.\n\nBack to Top\n\n1942\n\nThe United States was at war but tournament golf had not been affected yet. Ben Hogan started the new-year at the $10,000 Los Angeles Open right where he left off the year before, on the top of the professional golf world. In the second week of January he won the L.A. Open at Hillcrest Country Club where former Section member, Charles Lacey, was the head professional. Hogan went around Hillcrest in 70, 70, 72 and 70. Hogan (282) birdied the last hole with a 325-yard drive, an iron to the green and two putts to tie Jimmy Thomson (282) and force a playoff. Earlier Sam Snead had come to the last hole thinking he needed a birdie to tie and he made an eight. This left him in third place three strokes back at 285 tied with Harry Cooper and Chick Harbert. The next day Hogan won the $3,500 first prize by one stroke with another birdie on the last hole for an even par 72 against a 73 for Thomson. Thomson won $1,700.\n\nEd Dudley was in Los Angeles playing in the L.A. Open and while he was there he received a telephone call from the USGA. The call was to inform the PGA that in order to focus its full attention on the war effort the US Open would not be held that year. The PGA and the USGA had agreed to work together in the staging of exhibitions in order to raise money for the wartime charities. Another move by the USGA was a change in its bylaws, which would permit amateurs to win war bonds in tournaments up to $100 rather than merchandise or trophies.\n\nThe senior professionals were at the Ft. Myers Golf & Country Club for the Senior PGA Championship in the third week of January. Eddie Williams won by six strokes over Jock Hutchison (144) with a pair of three under par 69s for 138. George Morris finished third at 145 and former section member Wilfrid Reid was next with a 146. $125 of the prize money was donated to the American Red Cross.\n\nTen weeks after his victory at Los Angeles Ben Hogan won the $5,000 San Francisco Open. In between he had finished second to Byron Nelson in the Oakland Open. Hogan opened the tournament at the California Country Club with a seven-under-par 65 and then it rained for two days. When the tournament got under way again Hogan shot a 71 and he tacked on a 72-71 the last day to coast home three shots in front of Sam Snead (279). First prize was $1,000. Lawson Little (284) and Dick Metz (285) ended up in third and fourth place. The prize money was awarded in the form of United States Defense Bonds.\n\nSam Snead won the $5,000 St. Petersburg Open for the third time in four years. The tournament was played at the Lakewood Country Club in the first week of March. Snead began with a 72 and then brought in a 69 on a very rainy day. Ben Hogan and Henry Picard, who were paired together, left the course for the clubhouse saying that the course was unplayable. They were subsequently disqualified for delay of play. On the third day Snead turned in a 75 and a 70 for a 286, which earned him the $1,000 top prize. Sam Byrd, Byron Nelson and Chick Harbert tied for second at 289 and they each won $583.33. Byrd had now played in nine tournaments on the PGA Tour since the first of the year and he had been in the money seven times winning $1,021.08.\n\nIn the spring of 1942 there were three new members of the Section who were top players, Harold “Jug” McSpaden, E. J. ”Dutch” Harrison and Henry Ransom. McSpaden, the new head pro at the Philadelphia Country Club had been runner-up in the PGA Championship in 1937 and had won the Canadian Open in 1939. Harrison, now the professional at the West Shore Country Club and Ransom, the playing professional at the North Hills Country Club, were just beginning to realize their potential as tournament players.\n\nIn late March Ben Hogan won the North and South Open on the Pinehurst #2 course for a second time with a record 17 under par score of 271. His rounds were 67, 68, 67 and 69. Hogan had won his first PGA Tour tournament there two years before. Sam Snead finished second five strokes back at 276. Byron Nelson and Lloyd Mangrum tied for third with 281s. First prize was $1,000 and the total purse was $5,000.\n\nThe Greensboro Open got under way the day after the North and South Open ended. Sam Byrd made his decision to leave major league baseball in 1937 pay off by picking up his first PGA Tour win. Byrd was tied for the lead at the end of 36 holes with Jimmy Thomson at (69-67) 136. On the last day Byrd posted a 75 in the morning but he came back with a 68 in the afternoon for a total of 279. Ben Hogan and Lloyd Mangrum each put together 138s the last day and tied for second two strokes back at 281. Byron Nelson and Clayton Heafner tied for fourth with 282s. The total purse was $5,500 and first prize was $1,000.\n\nThe next week Ben Hogan won the Land of the Sky Open at Asheville, North Carolina for a third straight year. Hogan trailed Lawson Little by three strokes with nine holes to play, but a last nine 32 brought him in a winner by one shot. Hogan played the Biltmore Forest Country Club in rounds of 71, 69, 68 and 68 for 276. Little finished in second place at 277, one stroke in front of Byron Nelson (278). Jimmy Demaret, Ralph Guldahl and Ky Laffoon tied for fourth with 283s. Hogan’s prize was $1,000 in war bonds from the $5,000 purse.\n\nByron Nelson won the Masters Tournament for a second time on the second weekend in April. At the end of 72-holes he and Ben Hogan were tied at 280. In the playoff the next day Hogan led by three strokes after five holes but from there on Nelson played almost perfect golf. After being two over par after five holes Nelson played the next eleven holes in six under par. He bogied the 18th hole to finish with a 69, against Hogan’s 70. Nelson’s rounds were 68, 67, 72 and 73. First prize was still $1,500. There were ten Section members in the starting field. Paul Runyan (283) finished third and Sam Byrd (285) was fourth. Dutch Harrison (292) and Sam Snead (292) tied for seventh and Gene Kunes (293) tied for tenth one stroke in front of Jimmy Thomson (294). Felix Serafin (299), Jug McSpaden 299), Ed Dudley (305) and Joe Zarhardt (311) were out of the money.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Masters Tournament it was announced that Jim Barnes, Tommy Armour and Walter Travis had been added to the PGA Hall of Fame. In 1916 Barnes had won the first PGA Championship as the professional at Whitemarsh Valley Country Club. They were nominated by four golf writers; Grantland Rice, O.B. Keeler, Kerr Petrie and A. Lindy Fowler. With the 1940 and 1941 inductees, the PGA Hall of Fame now totaled twelve professionals and amateurs.\n\nThe Section’s spring meeting was held at Raymond’s Restaurant in Philadelphia on the third Monday of April. Former Section president Ed Dudley was in town for the meeting. He still had a home in the Philadelphia suburbs and was between his professional positions at Augusta and Colorado Springs. The topic of the meeting was the role of the PGA professional to provide relaxation and healthful exercise to the public. Even though many PGA members were in the service or working in defense plants the others could help raise money for the wartime charities. There were now nine members of the Section in active duty. The tournament chairman, Charlie Schneider, announced that there would be a full tournament schedule with a few adjustments for the war.\n\nIn early May the sports editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, Fred Byrod, reported that there were now nine Philadelphia Section members on active duty. The first one claimed by the Draft Board had been Ed Oliver who had been in the Army since the middle of 1941. He was followed by Elwood Brey, the professional at the Berwick Country Club, Hugh Crawford, assistant at the Rolling Green Golf Club, Leo Fraser, who had been the professional at the Seaview Country Club, Fred Johnson, the assistant at the Philadelphia Cricket Club, Matt Kowal and Tony Midiri, who had been the professional at the Spring Hill Country Club. Recently John Lewis, the teaching pro at the City Line Driving Range, had joined the Marines and Tom O’Connor had enlisted in the Air Corps. When it came to active duty Philadelphia was a leading contributor as more than fifteen percent of the country’s PGA enlisted members were Philadelphia Section members.\n\nThe Section’s pros qualified for the PGA Championship on the first Monday in May at the Philadelphia Cricket Club. Two seasoned pros, Joe Kirkwood, Sr. (68-74) and Jimmy Thomson (70-72) led the scoring with 142s. Dutch Harrison, Sam Byrd and Felix Serafin were at 145. The last two places went to Ed Dudley (146) and Clarence Ehresman (146). Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Leo Diegel and Jug McSpaden were exempt. Bruce Coltart was exempt as the host professional. Corporal Ed Oliver and Corporal Elwood Brey had military exemptions as members of the Philadelphia Section, which was hosting the championship. It meant that the Philadelphia Section had fourteen of its members playing in the championship. No alternates were allowed by the PGA of America.\n\nIn the last week of May Seaview Country Club and its head professional Bruce Coltart hosted the PGA Championship. Seaview had two very dissimilar nines in architecture. There was the Bay Course with 18-holes designed by Donald Ross and 9-holes in the pines designed by Bill Flynn. It was decided that the back nine of the Bay Course would be played first and then the pros would finish on the Pines nine. In the later rounds the Bay nine was played last to accommodate the gallery. In the previous PGA Championships all the players received mileage money, which was based on how far they lived from the tournament site. In 1942 only those who failed to qualify for the match play were paid the mileage money. Hershey CC professional Ben Hogan, who hit more practice balls than anyone, hurt his wrist practicing the day before the championship started and had to have x-rays taken. Fred Corcoran, the PGA Tournament Manager, told the press that Hogan’s starting time for the next day would be pushed back a few hours from his scheduled time. Because the country was now at war, the pros were qualifying for only 32 places in order to shorten the championship by one day. All the matches were scheduled for 36 holes. PGA of America president Ed Dudley led the 100 starters on the first day of qualifying with a six-under-par 66, which tied the record for the lowest qualifying round in the PGA championship. At the end of qualifying Harry Cooper was the medalist with a 138, while Sam Byrd tied for second at 139. Dudley and Hogan were part of a three-way tie for fifth at 141. Coltart (142), Jug McSpaden (143), Jimmy Thompson (143), Dutch Harrison (144), Sam Snead (144) and Joe Kirkwood, Sr. (147) were the other members of the Philadelphia Section who made it into the match play. Kirkwood had to survive a playoff to win one of the last spots. Corporal Elwood Brey, Corporal Ed Oliver, Felix Serafin, Clarence Ehresman and Leo Diegel failed to qualify. Byrd, Coltart, Thomson and Harrison lost in the first round. In the second round Kirkwood lost to Byron Nelson and McSpaden lost to Jim Turnesa. Three Section members; Snead, Dudley and Hogan made it into the quarter-finals. Hogan then lost to Turnesa one-down and Dudley lost to Snead, who was the Shawnee Inn & CC playing professional, one-down. Dudley lost to Snead when his tee shot on the last hole hit a spectator and bounced into the woods for an unplayable lie. Snead beat Jimmy Demaret 3&2 in one semifinal match and Turnesa defeated Byron Nelson in a match that went 37 holes. Snead went on to defeat Turnesa, who was stationed at Ft. Dix, New Jersey, in the 36-hole finals 2&1. Snead took his first prize of $2,000 in a war bond, which would have been worth $1,500 in cash. The total purse was $7,550. Turnesa was granted leave to compete in the championship with the understanding that any money he won would go to the Army Relief Fund. Turnesa won $750 in cash and wore his army uniform while playing in the tournament. The total purse was $7,550. Two days later Snead was in the U.S. Navy as Seaman First Class Snead. The draft board had given Snead a 10-day extension on his reporting date so he could play in the PGA. Snead’s caddy was a young man named Tony DeSimone who went on to own an automobile dealership and a golf course in South Jersey. DeSimone became one of the Philadelphia Section’s most faithful sponsors. All profits from the tournament were donated to the Army and Navy relief funds. This was the last major golf championship played until the end of the war.\n\nThe PGA Championship final was played on Sunday May 31. That evening the PGA of America held a meeting of its executive committee. The Atlantic City Golf Association and Seaview Country Club had issued an invitation for the PGA to hold its championship at Seaview again in 1943. Due to the war the PGA wasn’t sure when it might hold its championship again. The PGA executive committee did vote to hold its championship at Seaview again and publicly stated that when it was played again it would be held at Seaview. There would be no PGA Championship held in 1943 and by 1944 when it was held the commitment to Seaview had apparently been forgotten.\n\nDue to World War II the US Open wasn’t played from 1942 to 1945 but a substitute for the Open called the Hale America National Open Golf Tournament was held in 1942. Local qualifying was held at eighty sites in the country in late May, which trimmed the eligible entries to 520. Sectional qualifying was at twelve locations in the first week of June. Eighty survivors of the qualifying rounds and twenty exempt players would make up the starting field.\n\nLocal qualifying for the Hale America National Open was held at the Philadelphia Country Club’s Spring Mill Course on the fourth Monday of May. Gene Kunes led with 71-78 for 149. Also qualifying were amateur Skee Riegel, Bud Lewis who was now the professional at the Tredyffrin Country Club, Henry Williams, Jr. who was doing defense work in a steel mill, teaching pro at the Drive-O-Link Driving Range Alex Burke, Lorman Kelley, Philadelphia Country Club assistant Chick Rutan, Johnny Bishop the professional at the Lansdale Country Club and his assistant Bob DeHaven. The war was taking its toll on the professional competition. By the end of June there were fifteen Philadelphia Section members in the armed forces and many more were working in the defense plants and shipyards. Joe Kirkwood, Sr., Ed Dudley Jimmy Thomson and Sam Byrd were exempt from local qualifying. Ben Hogan and Jug McSpaden were exempt from local and sectional qualifying. Sam Snead was also fully exempt but he was in the navy now.\n\nA 54-hole sectional qualifying for the Hale American National Open was held at the Forest Hill Field Club in New Jersey in the first week of June. Willie Goggin led with a 209. Joe Kirkwood, Sr. (213), Jimmy Thomson (213) and Sam Byrd (215) made it at Forest Hill. The 217 scores played off. The tournament chairman, Francis Quimet, gave Ed Dudley an exemption. Dudley had been detained in Washington D.C. on PGA business and could not get back to Denver for the qualifying rounds.\n\nIn mid June the USGA held the Hale America tournament in Chicago at the Ridgemoor Country Club. There were 100 pros and amateurs in a field, which included 20 players who had been exempt from qualifying. The day before the tournament began Ed Dudley, Bobby Jones, Gene Sarazen and Bob Hope played an exhibition for the wartime charities. Hope’s plane was late arriving so the exhibition was played late in the day over 13 holes. The admission charge was $1.65 each day and the advance ticket sales for the tournament were $15,000. All servicemen were admitted without charge. The purse was $6,000. Ben Hogan was the winner with rounds of 72, 62, 69 and 68 for a seventeen under par 271. Hogan picked up five shots on Jimmy Demaret in the last four holes to win by three strokes. He won $1,000 and received a medal from the USGA just like the ones he got for winning the US Open in later years. Even though it is listed in the Official USGA Record Book in the same section with the US Open records the USGA never counted this as a US Open win but Hogan did. The tournament was co-sponsored by the USGA, the Chicago District Golf Association and the PGA of America. Demaret and Mike Turnesa tied for second with 274s. Jimmy Thomson, Byron Nelson and Horton Smith tied for fourth at 278. Sam Byrd (283) and Jug McSpaden (283) tied for twelfth. Dudley (287) tied for 20th and Joe Kirkwood, Sr. (289) tied for 29th. Hogan donated his putter and the winning ball to wartime charities. At the conclusion of play an auction was held. His putter sold for $1,000 and the ball sold for $650.\n\nSam Byrd won the Pennsylvania Open at Shannopin Country Club in late June. Byrd shot a 68 in the morning and then came back with a course record 64 that afternoon for a 132 score to win by seven strokes. He was ten under par for the day and didn’t make a bogey. Henry Ransom finished second at 139 and Pittsburgh’s Dick Shoemaker (140) was one stroke farther back. Maurie Gravatt, Ray Mangrum and amateur Steve Kovach tied for fourth with 142s.\n\nThe Philadelphia Open was played at the Llanerch Country Club on the second Monday in July. Joseph “Bud” Lewis, now the professional at the Tredyffrin Country Club, came out on top after just missing the year before at Pine Valley. Lewis holed a side-hill 45-foot putt on the last green for a 67. The 67 and a morning 69 gave him an eight under par score of 136. He nosed out Washington D.C. professional Lew Worsham (137) by one stroke. Third money went to Charlie Schneider (138) with Joe Kirkwood, Sr. (139) and Henry Williams, Jr. (139) tying for fourth. Williams completed an eight-hour shift in a steel plant just before coming to the course for 36 holes of competitive golf. This was the strongest field in recent years. George Fazio, Bruce Coltart, Gene Kunes and the defending champion Terl Johnson tied for sixth at 140. Henry Ransom and Sam Byrd followed them with 141s. They tied for tenth two strokes ahead of Jug McSpaden (143). Next was Corporal Ed Oliver (144) who had come down for the tournament from Ft. Dix with Sergeant Jim Turnesa. First prize was $250 and second was $125. Lewis had learned the game as a young caddie at Llanerch.\n\nA wartime Ryder Cup team that had been selected in late 1941, played a match against Walter Hagen’s challengers at the Oakland Hills Country Club in mid July. For the first time since the beginning of the Ryder Cup in 1927 Walter Hagen was not the captain. Craig Wood was the Ryder Cup captain and Hagen captained the challengers. Section members Ben Hogan and Jug McSpaden were there for the Ryder Cup team and Ed Dudley substituted for Sam Snead who was in the U.S. Navy. Byron Nelson was also a member of the team. Having played well since 1939 Gene Sarazen was back on the team. Sam Byrd and Jimmy Thomson played for the challengers. All matches were 36 holes. The Cup Team won, sweeping all five foursomes matches and splitting the singles with the final score 10 points to five. The exhibition raised close to $25,000 for the Red Cross.\n\nOn July 20, sponsor Henry A. Hurst announced that the Henry Hurst Invitation tournament was canceled for the duration of World War II. His reason for canceling was that too many of the best players, like Ben Hogan and Sam Snead, were now heading off to military service. He said the tournament would be resumed when the war was over.\n\nBen Hogan won the $5,000 Times-Union Open in Rochester in mid August. First prize was $1,000. Hogan opened with an eight-birdie first round of 64 on the Oak Hill Country Club course. Hogan followed that up with a 68-72 and finished with a 74 for a 278 that won by three strokes. Craig Wood (281) finished second, Jug McSpaden (282) third and Ky Laffoon (283) was fourth. Dutch Harrison (284) tied for fifth. Twelve Philadelphia Section professionals finished in the top thirty.\n\nIn late August Ben Hogan left the PGA Tour, resigned from his position at the Hershey Country Club and enrolled in a civilian flight school in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In early 1943 he enlisted in the Army Air Force.\n\nSam Byrd won the Wood Memorial tournament on the second Monday of September at the Jeffersonville Golf Club. There were 42 professionals entered and 250 amateurs. 50 more amateurs showed up to play but were turned away. Byrd put together a front nine 31 and a back nine 37. He had three bogies on his second nine with the last one on the 222-yard par three eighteenth hole, after overshooting the green. His two under par 68 edged out Marty Lyons (69) and George Fazio (69) by one stroke. Lyons might have been the winner, but he lost a stroke to par on each of the last two holes. Bud Lewis (70) and Chick Rutan (70) tied for fourth.\n\nIn late September Marty Lyons and the Llanerch Country Club hosted the Section Championship again. Jug McSpaden was the medalist in the 36-hole qualifying round with a five-over-par (72-75) 147. One stroke off the pace at 148 were Henry Ransom, Terl Johnson and the defending champion George Fazio. It was wet and windy and the weather was so bad that only 32 players finished, the exact number needed for the match play. McSpaden lost in the second round to Charlie Arena. A past champion, Gene Kunes, won the championship for a second time defeating Sam Byrd on the second extra hole, after being all even at the end of the 36-hole finals. Ed Dudley, back from Colorado, refereed the finals. The only complaint that Byrd had was that playing those afternoon matches kept him from being able to listen to the World Series games on the radio. In the semi-finals Kunes put out Terl Johnson on the 19th hole and Byrd eliminated Clarence Ehresman 3&1.\n\nIn early October the Augusta National Golf Club announced the cancellation of the 1943 Masters Tournament. Club president Cliff Roberts stated that the club would not open for the winter season and would remain closed for the duration of the war. Ed Dudley now had more time to devote to the PGA and his summer job.\n\nThe Section’s annual meeting was at Raymond’s Restaurant in Philadelphia in late October. Marty Lyons was elected president again and the rest of the officers, A.B. Thorn, Charlie Schneider, Jimmy D’Angelo and Walter Brickley were reelected. National president Ed Dudley attended the meeting. The members discussed some of the resolutions that were being presented at the national meeting in November. One of these that the members voted against was to reduce the apprenticeship for instructors from the present five years to three years. Another one was for the elimination of dues, except for the insurance payments, for those in defense work, but it was felt that those members could afford the dues. The Section members also voted against a resolution that would increase the national vice-president’s term of office from the present one year to three years. Jug McSpaden stated that it would only take the PGA back to the turmoil of some years back when the officers could retain office for any length of time. The resolution must have passed at the national meeting though. One item of business that the members did agree on was a resolution for the reduction of dues of all the members.\n\nThe Section allowed PGA members from other PGA Sections who were stationed in the Philadelphia area to play in Section events. Jim Turnesa, who was stationed at Ft. Dix, New Jersey, finished second in the Section pro-pro championship in early November.\n\nBy the time the PGA’s national meeting was held in the second week of November the PGA of America had 1,624 members and 198 were in the armed services. The meeting was in Chicago again and it was held at the Medinah Club. Ed Dudley was reelected president along with the other officers, Frank T. Sprogell (Secretary) and Willie Maguire (Treasurer). The most urgent problem for President Dudley and the delegates was the PGA Tour schedule and the 1943 PGA Championship. Since the last annual meeting the total purses had dropped from $175,000 to $155,000 but at the same time $250,000 had been contributed by the PGA Tour tournaments to various relief organizations. PGA tournament manager, Fred Corcoran, announced that there were just two events left on a winter schedule that was once crowded with tournaments. The $100,000 winter tour was now only worth $10,000 with just the Miami Open in early December and the North and South Open at Pinehurst in late March remaining. The delegates decided that due to the uncertainties of the war the fate of their national championship would be delayed until after the first of the year. Since the PGA didn’t need a tournament manager for two tournaments Corcoran was going overseas for the winter to work with the Red Cross. Each Section was entitled to two delegates with the expenses for one of them being paid by the PGA. The expenses paid by the PGA were the hotel charges and mileage expenses. Marty Lyons and Jimmy D’Angelo were the delegates from the Philadelphia Section. Lyons and D’Angelo proposed a plan for a PGA golf course in Florida. The idea had surfaced in the Llanerch Country Club pro shop when Sam Byrd had told Lyons and D’Angelo about a golf course in Dunedin that he thought the PGA could lease. There was considerable discussion at the meeting on the idea.\n\nIn the first week of December Jug McSpaden came through with a last round four-under-par 66 to win the Miami Open by four strokes over Johnny Revolta (276). McSpaden had won there in 1938 also. McSpaden’s first three rounds on the Miami Springs Golf & Country Club course were 67, 70 and 69, which gave him an eight under par 272. The purse was $5,000 and first prize was $1,000. Everyone was paid in war bonds. Bob Hamilton (277) finished third. Dutch Harrison and Herman Barron tied for fourth with 278s. Harrison won $350.\n\nThe next tournament on the PGA schedule was not until the North and South Open in late March at Pinehurst. Gasoline rationing was the biggest problem since the PGA could not guarantee the sponsors that the leading players would be able to appear at any set place or time. In 1942 Sunday attendance on the tour had increased by 30% but Corcoran was pretty sure it would not be the same the next year due to the gasoline problems. Because of that the clubs and sponsors were not willing to schedule the tournaments.\n\nEven though Ben Hogan had left the PGA Tour in late August his presence was still being felt. The Vardon Trophy was not awarded but he would have won it for a third straight year. Hogan’s scoring average was 70.87 for 64 tournament rounds. He was the leading money winner for the second straight year. He won six times in 20 starts. His money total of $13,143 was more than $3,500 ahead of Byron Nelson, who finished second with $9,601. Sam Snead was third with $8,078. Nelson and Snead were second and third in the Vardon Trophy race as well. Dutch Harrison won $4,408, which put him in seventh place on the money list. Sam Byrd was eighth as he won $3,905. Jimmy Thomson ended up in tenth place, winning $3,410.\n\nBack to Top\n\n1943\n\nWhen the new-year began 99 percent of the Section professionals who were not in the service were working in defense plants. The PGA Championship and the Senior PGA Championship had been canceled.\n\nIn early January Ed Dudley told the nation that professional golf would make an all out effort to raise money for the American Red Cross and other wartime charities. He stated that golf had already raised more than $1,000,000 for these charities. Dudley noted that it was important for the people on the home front to stay fit and that there was no better way to do this than by playing a three-hour round of golf once a week. He encouraged the golf clubs to stay open. He said that golf was a big business, employing many people and paying thousands of dollars each year in federal taxes. Dudley also suggested that all the clubs extend the courtesy of a round of golf to any serviceman who was home on leave.\n\nIn March the PGA and president Ed Dudley achieved what no one else in golf either thought of or tried to do, which was obtaining approval of wartime golf from the War Manpower Commission chairman. It took time and effort and Dudley got the run-around several times before he landed it. As a result of that it would no longer be considered unpatriotic to play golf or schedule golf tournaments during the war. Gasoline was rationed and driving to a golf course had been considered joy riding and a detriment to the war effort. The PGA received a great deal of good press from this because they had taken the leadership and accomplished what the USGA might have been expected to do. This was a great break for golf but too late to save most of the PGA Tour’s schedule for that year.\n\nThe Section’s spring meeting was at Raymond’s Restaurant on the third Monday of April. Ideas were presented to aid the war effort. The Philadelphia Section had 134 members and 19 were in the service. President Marty Lyons had given the tournament chairman, Leo Diegel, full authority to use the tournament schedule in any way to aid the war effort. One plan was to spur the task the pros had undertaken to obtain steel shafted golf clubs for scrap from which to obtain carbon steel. Three exhibitions were planned for early May featuring the best players in the Section. The admission price to these exhibitions was the donation of a golf club for the scrap drive. Leo Diegel announced that the prizes at three tournaments; the pro-lady, a PGA Victory championship at Llanerch and the pro-am championship, would be war bonds and stamps. A team match consisting of twelve pros, twelve men amateurs and twelve women golfers was scheduled. The pros would give the amateurs two strokes and the women seven. The club that hosted the matches would donate $500 plus all other proceeds from the day to the Red Cross. A .B. Thorn announced that Lancaster Country Club would be open to the public on three Sundays that summer and all the green fees would be turned over to the Red Cross.\n\nOn the second Sunday of May three exhibitions were played by Philadelphia PGA members to aid the scrap iron drive. At Beverly Golf Club Jug McSpaden and Ted Bickel, Jr. defeated Gulph Mills Golf Club professional George B. Smith and Marty Lyons. Charles Arena and George Fazio, who was now the playing professional at Pine Valley Golf Club, defeated Old York Road Country Club professional Steve Grady and Dick Renaghan. Bud Lewis and Sonny Fraser defeated Sam Byrd and Leo Diegel at Cedarbrook Country Club. The golf fans donated 500 golf clubs. Carbon steel would be salvaged from the shafts to make surgical instruments and precision tools.\n\nSam Byrd received a draft notice to report for his physical at Fort McClellan, Alabama, which was where he was from and his permanent address. Due to his age (36) he was not inducted.\n\nOn the third Friday of May Bing Crosby and Bob Hope played an exhibition for the wartime charities at the Llanerch. Crosby was paired up with Jug McSpaden and Hope’s partner was Ed Dudley. To make it even more interesting, Joe Kirkwood, Sr. played along with them, demonstrating trick shots. In spite of rain 6,000 golf and movie fans turned out and paid $1 for the privilege. Because many of the spectators were not golfers and the weather it was decided that nine holes would be enough and that turned into five holes. There were 100 marshals, but they could not keep things in order. The exhibition started on #10 and they played #11, before cutting across to finish up on the 16th, 17th and 18th holes. Crosby and Hope put on some dry clothes before putting on a show on the practice putting green. Everything they could part with, like sweaters and scorecards, was auctioned off for war bonds. A golf ball signed by Crosby, Hope, Dudley and McSpaden sold for $50,000. A phonograph record signed by Crosby and a set of woods made by Joe Seka, the second president of the Philadelphia PGA, each brought $5,000. When it was all over Crosby and Hope had sold $130,525 in war bonds.\n\nDue to the rationing of gasoline the Golf Association of Philadelphia canceled all their tournaments for the year in late May. This included the Philadelphia Open that had been held for 40 consecutive years since 1903. The Philadelphia Section’s schedule was unaffected by the gas ban due to the work of their national President, Ed Dudley. The OPA had issued a ruling that the pros could drive to tournaments which were a part of their livelihood.\n\nIn the second week of June Sam Byrd and his wife won the qualifying medal at the Bala Golf Club for the Pro-Lady Championship. Playing the format of selective drive/alternate shot, the Byrd team posted a one under par 67 which was five strokes better than the team of Jug McSpaden and Helen Sigel that put together a 72. Eight teams qualified for the match play rounds. The tournament began on a Monday and the final was played on Sunday with the spectator fees from a gallery of several hundred going to the Red Cross. In the final the Byrds prevailed in a tight match over the Old York Road team of Steve Grady and Mrs. Ralph Raynor on the 19th hole. It was the 27th year that the tournament had been played.\n\nOn the fourth Monday of June a testimonial golf tournament was held at the Llanerch Country Club for Gene Kunes who had been seriously ill for more than a year. Following an operation in December he had been in the hospital for nearly six months, ailing with stomach problems due to his liver. Kunes was now recuperating at Seaview Country Club. 259 pros and amateurs, took part in the event. All of the leading golfers in Philadelphia were there. In what was referred to as the feature foursome Sam Byrd and Woodie Platt took on Jug McSpaden and Sonny Fraser. George B. Smith, who was now the professional at Gulph Mills Golf Club, turned in a four under par 68, which was the low round of the day and took home a trophy put up by Henry A. Hurst. McSpaden, who had a wrist infection lanced at Lankenau Hospital in the morning was second with a 69.\n\nOne tournament that wasn’t canceled was the New Jersey Open. It was held on the second Sunday of July at the Montclair Golf Club. George Fazio, who was playing his first New Jersey Open, and Sergeant Vic Ghezzi were paired together for the one-day of 36 holes. After a hard fought battle they ended the day tied for the title with totals of 142. Ghezzi’s rounds were 70-72 and Fazio’s were 69-73. Tom Harmon was next with a 143, which was two strokes better than Emory Thomas (145) and Jack Mitchell (145). The playoff took place three weeks later, also on a Sunday. In the 18-hole playoff Fazio led by three strokes when he teed off on the last hole. Fazio’s tee shot embedded in a fairway bunker and he finished with a do"
