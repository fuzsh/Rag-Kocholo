        "text": "Since 1971, Atlantic Christian School has graduated nearly 600 alumni. These students have gone on to pursue careers in education, medicine, media, ministry, the armed forces, and public service, to name a few. Looking back on their years at ACS, our alumni often tell us that ACS “made a difference in their lives.” ACS holds several alumni events annually — including a fall Homecoming Alumni Soccer game and winter Alumni Basketball games. We are inspired by the stories that our alumni and former students share with us about how God is working in their lives and using them to make an impact for Christ in this world. Here are some of their stories:\n\nMichael Reichwein (’73-6th grade) came to ACS in the 5th grade when the school opened its doors for the 1971-72 school year in the Parish House of St. John’s By the Sea Reformed Episcopal Church in Ventnor, NJ. He attended ACS for two years and was the first ACS graduate and the only student in the 6th grade graduating class of 1973. His family relocated to Pennsylvania in 1978 and he graduated from Octorara High School in Atglen, PA. Michael went on to attend Millersville University, where he majored in industrial arts. Since 1995, Michael has worked for R.S. Reidenbaugh, an industrial electrical construction company in Lititz, PA. Michael and his wife, Tammy, have been happily married since 1985 and live in Lancaster County, PA. They have three children, Michael, Stephanie, and Jessica, and 10 grandchildren. Michael accepted Christ while attending Linwood Community Church with his family, just before he started attending ACS. His faith has remained strong over the years and he considers himself a Christian apologist. He said he enjoys engaging online every day with people on various sites and forums, witnessing for the Lord and sometimes debating atheists on the existence of God.\n\nTracy Thompson (’74-6th grade) is a Registered Dental Assistant in the Absecon, NJ office of Dr. Michael Combs, where she has worked since 1980 after graduating from Absegami High School. During her 6th grade year at ACS, Tracy entered a school-wide contest to design the school’s first logo and her design won 1st place and was used as the school logo for a number of years. In 1974, ACS went up to the 6th grade and Tracy and classmate, Debby Zanes Reinwalds, were the only two students in the 1974 graduating class. They have remained friends throughout the years. Tracy lives in Galloway, NJ and is mom to triplets — Victoria, Alexia, and John — and has one grandson, Cash. She worships at Beacon Evangelical Free Church.\n\nPaula Cibotti Accardi (’75-6th grade) graduated in 1981 from Atlantic City High School and was married in 1982. She worked for many years as a basic skills instructor/aide in the Linwood Public Schools and as a hairdresser on weekends. She lives in Northfield and has been a longtime member of New Life Assembly of God in Egg Harbor Township. In 1975, ACS only went up to the 6th grade. Paula attended for just one year and was one of four students in the 1975 6th grade graduating class. Paula was one year behind ACS alumnus Debby Zanes Reinwalds (’74) and they were childhood neighbors and friends in Ventnor. They are still friends today and Paula is grateful to Debby for introducing her to ACS and encouraging her to learn more about God. Paula’s grandson, Daniel Accardi-Gonzalez, also attended ACS for several years.\n\nPastor Bob Stahler (’82) is pastor of the Great Commission Baptist Church in Cape May Courthouse, where he has served since 1988. He has been a member of the Board of Trustees of the Atlantic City Rescue Mission since 1998, serving three years as its Chairman. Pastor Stahler returned to ACS to participate in the June 2013 commencement as the keynote speaker. He earned a BA in elementary education at Asbury College and a MA in religion at Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary. He and his wife Marcy met at Asbury College. They have eight children who over the years have traveled with them on eight missions trips, six of them to Johannesburg, South Africa. Bob said the teachers at ACS had a great influence on him and prepared him for ministry. “The public speaking class I had with Mrs. McNeal taught me more about preaching than any class I had in college or seminary,” Bob said.\n\nKristine Cassell (’85) is an elementary teacher at Pilgrim Academy in Egg Harbor City, where she has taught 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grade classes since 1994. She earned her BA in elementary education and Bible from Clarks Summit University in 1989. While a senior in college, she did student teaching at ACS and in the fall of 1989 returned to teach 4th grade for one year. Kris then taught 3rd grade for two years at Seaford Christian Academy in Delaware. The following year, she traveled to Santiago, Chile, where she taught 3rd grade at Santiago Christian Academy. Kris returned to the states and taught again for one year at ACS before putting down long-term roots at Pilgrim Academy. For many years, Kris has sung and led children’s church at Chelsea Baptist Church in Atlantic City, where her late father, Rev. Daniel Cassell, served as pastor for 36 years. Kris resides in Galloway with her mother, Pat Cassell, who retired from ACS in 2007 after 29 years of distinguished service as an ACS kindergarten teacher and principal.\n\nKaren Kizer Woerner (’86) earned a BS in elementary education in 1990 from Liberty University and minored in Bible and history.
