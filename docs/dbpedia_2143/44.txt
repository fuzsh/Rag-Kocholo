HONOLULU – Ben Chapman, a decorated Korean War veteran and real estate executive best known for playing the title character in the 1954 horror film “Creature From the Black Lagoon,” died last week. He was 79.

Chapman’s role as the Gill Man – the quintessential 1950s monster in Universal Pictures’ black-and-white film in 3-D – made him a darling on the collectibles and sci-fi circuit throughout the world.

The gig brought him enduring pleasure, said his son, Ben Chapman III, of Honolulu.

“His ‘Creature’ fans kept him going and he looked forward to trips to the mainland. But over the past year, he was slowing down because of heart problems; he had breathing problems,” his son said.

Chapman had a Web site, www.the-reelgillman.com, where fans would reach him, said his son, who was among family members at Chapman’s bedside when he died on Feb. 21 at Tripler Army Medical Center.

A Tahiti native, Chapman got the Gill Man part because of his size, 6 feet 5. He wore a foam rubber suit that defined his character: part-amphibian, part-man.

“Creature” was released in 1954, when Chapman was a contract player at Universal.

In a 1993 interview with The Honolulu Advertiser, he said, “I never knew, when I did the movie at age 25, that it would be such a monster film,” pun intended.

Chapman was born Oct. 29, 1928, in Oakland, but was reared in Tahiti till age 12 or 13, after which he moved to San Francisco.

He served in Korea with the Marine Corps, earning a Silver Star and Bronze Star. He also earned two Purple Hearts for battle injuries to his legs.
