        "text": "Gladys J. Taylor of Clyde Park, Montana, died peacefully in her home, on December 30, 2023. She was 86 years old.\n\nGladys was born on December 22, 1937, in Clyde Park, Montana, to Frank and Thelma Taylor. In November of 1953 she met the love of her life, Robert (Bob) Taylor, and within 6-weeks they were married. For their honeymoon, they hopped a freight train to California. Just shy of their 70th anniversary, and 31 days before Gladys’ death, her beloved husband, Bob, passed away after a brief illness. Gladys and Bob had five children together,12 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren. They also had a community of friends who loved them and who their children are grateful—especially during this past year.\n\nGladys had several jobs in her life including being a baker, cake decorator, working at the hot lunch program at Park County High School, and assisting Bob at the Village Craftsman with finishing work. Gladys’ longest and most rewarding job was being a homemaker, mother, and wife. She followed Bob to Detroit, Michigan, for 10 years of their early married life—moving back to Livingston in 1969 then moving “back home” to Clyde Park in 1977. Their house was just three blocks away from where Gladys was born.\n\nGladys graduated from pastry school while in Detroit and was well known for the beautiful cakes she made. She made all of her children’s wedding cakes, plus countless more for birthdays, graduations and other events. She was a great baker and always had a batch of fresh cookies, muffins, or cake to give to visitors. She was a Girl Scouts leader, Boy Scouts leader, 4-H volunteer, Catholic religious education teacher, and much more. She was also an excellent quilter and her family benefited with many beautiful quilts as gifts. She enjoyed looking for the perfect fabric and exchanging quilting patterns and ideas with her quilting friends.\n\nGladys is survived by her sister, Alice (Jim) Sargent; her brother-in-laws Bill Martin and Bruce (Jody) Taylor; her daughters Aletta (Joe) Zimmerman, Bobbi (Mike Whiting) Taylor, Diane Taylor Szudera, and Ruth (Chad) Christensen; her son Bill (Hillary) Taylor; her grand children Nicole (Jason) Lashever, Shelley (Kurt Kopperud) Szudera, Bill (Cassie) Szudera, Chis (Xiamei) Patterson, Tina (Matt) Read, Mindy (Dan) Miller, Melissa (Jared Wolberg) Szudera, Rob (Amanda Haglund) Lahren, Bobby (Hattie) Szudera, Nathan Breigenzer, Sophie Taylor and Marissa Taylor; great-grandchildren Lucy, Mila, Vada, Warren, Molly, Marley, Myles and James; and numerous nieces, nephews, other family members, and friends.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her husband, Bob Taylor; her parents, an infant son, sisters and brothers-in-law Charlene (Monte) Mathis; Faye (Chris) Shore; and half-brother Allen Kirby. Plus other family members, and good friends.\n\nA Vigil will be held on Thursday, February 15, 2024 at 3:00 p.m., at St. Margaret's Catholic Church in Clyde Park. A Memorial Mass will be held at 11:00 a.m, Friday, February 16, 2024 at the church. Interment will follow at St. Margaret's Cemetery in Clyde Park followed by a reception at the Clyde Park Community Center.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials may be given in Gladys Taylor’s name to St. Margaret’s Church, Clyde Park, Montana, or St. Mary’s School, Livingston, Montana\n\nPlease visit below to leave a condolence or share a memory."
