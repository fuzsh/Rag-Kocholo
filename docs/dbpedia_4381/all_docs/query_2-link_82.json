        "text": "Standing to the right of center and in front of a gilded throne with lavish blue velvet cushions, a man gazes at the viewer. His bold green sash symbolizes labor, development, and fertility, and draws our attention to his numerous honors and decorations.\n\nJust five-feet-two-inches tall, Haile Selassi, who served as Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974, appears statuesque in this recontextualized regal portrait, his accomplishments and reputation towering over his stature. During his lifetime (1892-1975), Selassi was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records for being the world’s most decorated person. Widely regarded as the most influential leader in modern Ethiopian history and the key figure of the religious and political Rastafari movement begun in Jamaica in the 1930s, Selassi’s legacy endures.\n\n“TUPAC” and “COFFEE” are emblazoned in the top left corner, bringing American rapper Tupac Shakur into the royal court, along with Ethiopia's robust coffee tradition.\n\nThe late rapper’s name derives from the Quechua (an indigenous language family spoken by the Quechua peoples primarily living in the Peruvian Andes) word meaning “a royal thing” and is a defunct title similar to Ras in the Ethiopian Empire. Afeni Shakur named her son after Túpac Amaru II, an indigenous cacique (hereditary chief) who led a large Andean rebellion against the Spanish in Peru as self-proclaimed Sapa Inca of a new Inca Empire.\n\nEthiopia is Africa’s largest coffee exporter, responsible for harvesting and distributing some three percent of the world's overall coffee bean supply, or about four million bags of fruity, flowery beans last year. The industry dates back to around 850 CE, when, according to legend, an Arab-Ethiopian goat herder (Kaldi or Khalid) discovered the prized plant after noticing its energizing effect on his flock.\n\nA wealth of centuries of references abound in It’s H. I. M. (2012), an acrylic on canvas painted by Henry Taylor shortly after his trip to the landlocked country split by the Great Rift Valley. It’s among more than 130 potent visual narratives by the Los Angeles-based artist (born 1958) best known for his experimental figurative paintings and exploration of contemporary and relevant historical social issues. Taylor rewrites art history, often with art historical references, to amplify Black people who have been overlooked or undermined by the canon and systems of power and control.\n\nLarge-scale paintings, rarely seen drawings, sculpture, and a newly-conceived and astounding installation honoring the Black Panthers, are on view through Jan. 28, 2024, at the Whitney Museum of American Art in the first large-scale New York survey of the renowned contemporary artist. Henry Taylor: B Side is organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles, and curated by Senior Curator Bennett Simpson, with curatorial assistant Anastasia Kahn. The Whitney presentation is organized by Curator Barbara Haskell, with curatorial assistants Colton Klein and Caroline Webb.\n\nInfused with wit, emotion, and profound commentary on the role of Black people in the United States, each artwork, each subject, each singular composition, captures our attention. Fluidly working across genres and time periods, Taylor portrays friends, relatives, fellow artists, strangers on the street, and public figures such as Barack and Michelle Obama, JAY-Z, and Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nThe Black Panther movement is a recurring theme in the retrospective, including\n\nEldridge Cleaver (2007), which portrays the radical writer, political activist, and Black Panther Party Minister of Information through a reimagining of James McNeill Whistler’s 1871 painting Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1 (often called by its colloquial title Whistler's Mother or Portrait of Artist's Mother) replacing the American Gilded Age painter’s mother with Cleaver.\n\nHuey Newton (2007), an acrylic with collaged photocopies on canvas borrowing from a 1967 photograph of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense (BPP) co-founder, depicts him in his ubiquitous black beret and armed with a rifle and a spear, a call to action against racial injustice and oppression.\n\nUntitled (2022), an acrylic on canvas imagined portrait of the artist’s brother Randy bridges Randy’s past affiliation with the Black Panther Party branch in Ventura, California, and his current life in Texas breeding dogs, inspiring the text “Dog Father” on a bag of dog food.\n\nExploring these diverse portraits, we’re reminded of Shakur, who was born 1971 in New York’s Harlem to Black Panther Party members.\n\nNewton and Bobby Seale, who met at Merritt College in Oakland, founded the BPP in October 1966 as a revolutionary organization with an ideology of Black nationalism, socialism, and armed self-defense, particularly against police brutality. Those goals are as vital as ever, amid ongoing social and racial turmoil, as oppression, violence, abuse, discrimination, and hatred of people of color continues to proliferate.\n\nWe turned a corner to find the installation underscoring the magnitude of the Whitney presentation, as viewers stood still and silent, examining each mannequin, leather jacket, and beret, as typically worn by Panthers, alongside photos of people recently killed by police. The representational figures stand in front of a massive banner on the wall, imploring us to “END WAR AND STOP RACISM!!!” and to “Support the Black Panthers.” Featuring contemporary clothing, such as Colin Kaepernick’s San Francisco 49ers jersey, Taylor demonstrates how the fight for equality and peace continues. Taylor’s dramatic, dynamic homage to the Black Panther Party and, especially, his brother Randy, gives us true pause, as we Say Their Names:\n\nAntwon Rose Jr. (2000–2018)\n\nDominique Clayton (1987–2019)\n\nMichael Brown (1996–2014)\n\nBotham Jean (1991–2018)\n\nChristian Taylor (1995–2015)\n\nWalter Scott (1965–2015)\n\nElijah McClain (1996–2019)\n\nBreonna Taylor (1993–2020)\n\nTamir Rice (2002–2014)\n\nFreddie Gray (1989–2015)\n\nJordan Edwards (2001–2017)\n\nAmadou Diallo (1976–1999)\n\nSean Bell (1983–2006)\n\nAlton Sterling (1979–2016)\n\nPhilando Castile (1983–2016)"
