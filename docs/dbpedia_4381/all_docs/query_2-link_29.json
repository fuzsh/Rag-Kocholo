        "text": "Taylor Swift reappeared after a monthlong Twitter hiatus on Monday to share her thoughts on a Los Angeles Times interview in which Damon Albarn claimed the “Shake It Off” singer doesn’t write her own lyrics, and that co-writing “doesn’t count.”\n\nThe Blur and Gorillaz frontman’s comments received instant backlash from Swifties, and the pop queen defended herself: “I was such a big fan of yours until I saw this. I write ALL of my own songs. Your hot take is completely false and SO damaging. You don’t have to like my songs but it’s really f—ed up to try and discredit my writing. WOW.” He later apologized “unreservedly and unconditionally,” claiming “i had a conversation about songwriting and sadly it was reduced to clickbait.”\n\nDespite the controversy, Taylor Swift does, in fact, have a hand in writing all her songs. Co-writers on her studio albums include Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Ryan Tedder, Aaron Dessner and even her actor boyfriend Joe Alwyn, but she’s written a number of songs — 54 songs, to be exact — all on her own, beginning at age 12 up until now. Her third studio album, Speak Now, is comprised entirely of songs she wrote alone.\n\nBelow, find every song she has a solo credit on, including a couple she doesn’t even sing on, listed from the oldest original release to newest and accompanied by a standout Swift lyric.\n\n“The Outside” — Taylor Swift (2006)\n\nStandout lyric: “I tried to take the road less traveled by/ But nothing seems to work the first few times”\n\n“Should’ve Said No” — Taylor Swift (2006)\n\nStandout lyric: “And baby, you know all the right things to say/ But do you honestly expect me to believe/ We could ever be the same?”\n\n“Our Song” — Taylor Swift (2006)\n\nStandout lyric: “Our song is the slammin’ screen doors/ Sneakin’ out late, tapping on your window”\n\n“Christmas Must Be Something More” — Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection (2007)\n\nStandout lyric: “We get so caught up in all of it/ Business and relationships/ Hundred mile an hour lives”\n\n“Fifteen” — Fearless (2008)\n\nStandout lyric: “I’ve found time can heal most anything/ And you just might find who you’re supposed to be”\n\n“Love Story” — Fearless (2008)\n\nStandout lyric: “Romeo, save me, they’re trying to tell me how to feel/ This love is difficult, but it’s real”\n\n“Hey Stephen” — Fearless (2008)\n\nStandout lyric: “Come feel this magic I’ve been feeling since I met you/ Can’t help it if there’s no one else”\n\n“You’re Not Sorry” — Fearless (2008)\n\nStandout lyric: “You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade”\n\n“Forever & Always” — Fearless (2008)\n\nStandout lyric: “So here’s to everything coming down to nothing/ Here’s to silence that cuts me to the core”\n\n“The Best Day” — Fearless (2008)\n\nStandout lyric: “I don’t know who I’m going to talk to now at school/ But I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you”\n\n“Change” — Fearless (2008)\n\nStandout lyric: “Because these things will change/ Can you feel it now?/ These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down”\n\n“Jump Then Fall” — Fearless (Platinum Edition) (2008)\n\nStandout lyric: “The time is gonna come when you’re so mad you could cry/ But I’ll hold you through the night until you smile”\n\n“The Other Side of the Door” — Fearless (Platinum Edition) (2008)\n\nStandout lyric: “All I need is on the other side of the door/ With your face and the beautiful eyes/ And the conversation with the little white lies/ And the faded picture of a beautiful night”\n\n“I Heart ?” — Beautiful Eyes EP (2008)\n\nStandout lyric: “But just look what I’ve created/ I came out alive but I’m black and blue”\n\n“Beautiful Eyes” — Beautiful Eyes EP (2008)\n\nStandout lyric: “I wake up, I’m alive/ In only a little while, I’ll cry/ ‘Cause you’re my lullaby”\n\n“Today Was a Fairytale” — Valentine’s Day Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (2010)\n\nStandout lyric: “Time slows down/ Whenever you’re around”\n\n“Mine” — Speak Now (2010)\n\nStandout lyric: “Braced myself for the goodbye/ ‘Cause that’s all I’ve ever known/ Then, you took me by surprise / You said, ‘I’ll never leave you alone.’”\n\n“Sparks Fly” — Speak Now (2010)\n\nStandout lyric: “I’m on my guard for the rest of the world/ But with you, I know it’s no good”\n\n“Back To December” — Speak Now (2010)\n\nStandout lyric: “Maybe this is wishful thinking/ Probably mindless dreaming/ But if we loved again, I swear I’d love you right”\n\n“Speak Now” — Speak Now (2010)\n\nStandout lyric: “There’s the silence, there’s my last chance/ I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me”\n\n“Dear John” — Speak Now (2010)\n\nStandout lyric: “But I took your matches/ Before fire could catch me/ So don’t look now, I’m shining like fireworks/ Over your sad empty town”\n\n“Mean” — Speak Now (2010)\n\nStandout lyric: “You, with your words like knives/ And swords and weapons that you use against me”\n\n“The Story of Us” — Speak Now (2010)\n\nStandout lyric: “I’d tell you I miss you, but I don’t know how/ I’ve never heard silence quite this loud”\n\n“Never Grow Up” — Speak Now (2010)\n\nStandout lyric: “To you everything’s funny, you got nothing to regret/ I’d give all I have, honey/ If you could stay like that”\n\n“Enchanted” — Speak Now (2010)\n\nStandout lyric: “Please don’t be in love with someone else/ Please don’t have somebody waiting on you”\n\n“Better Than Revenge” — Speak Now (2010)\n\nStandout lyric: “She came along, got him alone and let’s hear the applause/ She took him faster than you can say ‘Sabotage’”\n\n“Innocent” — Speak Now (2010)\n\nStandout lyric: “Wasn’t it beautiful running wild til;
