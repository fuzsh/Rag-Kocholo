It should be a liberating experience that enlarges horizons, deepens insight, sharpens the mind, exposes new areas of inquiry, and sensitizes our ability to appreciate the good and beautiful as well as the true.”\n\nArthur Holmes, The Idea of a Christian College\n\nA Taylor diploma represents an education that expands interests and understanding, focuses on the big questions of life, and challenges students through rigorous academic and co-curricular programs. The Taylor education is designed to nurture and refine intellectual virtues like problem solving, critical thinking, and reasoning as well as Christian virtues of honesty, patience, and compassion. These are invaluable tools graduates will draw upon and hone for the rest of their lives. Receiving the diploma is only the beginning.\n\nServant’s Towel\n\nOn the night He was betrayed, Jesus took not only the bread and the cup as lasting symbols of His sacrificial love, but also a servant’s towel. During the Passover meal in John 13, Jesus stepped down from the seat of honor, took off His outer clothing, and put a towel around His waist. He lowered Himself to the position of a house servant and washed His disciples’ feet. In doing so, He offered His disciples a profound and radically counter-cultural demonstration of the heart of God. The life into which He invites His followers involves taking up the towel with Him.\n\nThe towel is an important symbol at Taylor. It was first employed during Commencement in 1983 as a tangible expression of the mission of the University. As we celebrate past achievements and future hopes, the Taylor towel reminds graduates that every significant accomplishment comes by participating in the servant ministry of Jesus Christ. His ministry of redemption and reconciliation extends to all godly pursuits and callings.\n\nThe Taylor towel is not intended to be kept in a glass display in order to be admired and left untouched. It is intended to grow tattered and worn through daily use. The mission of the towel is the Christian life following the original Towel Bearer who calls us into participation and enables us to join in His patient, costly, liberating ministry.\n\nUniversity Symbols and Traditions\n\nBibles and Bookplates\n\nPresident Michael Lindsay and his wife, Rebecca, present each graduating senior with a Bible imprinted with the Taylor University seal, as well as a commemorative bookplate with the following message:\n\nAs you go forth from this place, we pray that you will carry the light and faith of Jesus Christ to a world in need. Thank you for blessing the Taylor community with your life and your witness. We pray God’s very best for you as you enter a new season of faithful service. When we think of this graduating class, we are reminded of one of our favorite passages of Scripture: “…We were delighted to share with you not only the Gospel of God, but our lives as well, because you have become so dear to us.” (1 Thessalonians 2:8)\n\nRebecca and Michael Lindsay\n\nFaculty Tunnel\n\nGraduates pass by faculty, their mentors for the past four years, for final review. The tunnel symbolizes the support, academic preparation, and whole-person education that marks students’ experiences at Taylor, and is a highlight for students and faculty members alike.\n\nFlags of the World\n\nThe flags displayed represent the home countries of our graduates.\n\nHonors at Graduation\n\nIn recognition of superior scholarship, the University awards three levels of honors at graduation to students who meet the GPA requirements. For ceremony purposes, honors will be announced and appropriate honors regalia worn using the GPA calculated after January interterm this year. Final graduation honors placed on diplomas and transcripts are determined after students have completed all requirements for their baccalaureate degrees.\n\nTaylor University Honors Guild\n\nTaylor’s Honors Guild honors Harold J. Ockenga 1927, one of Taylor’s most notable alumni—pastor at Boston’s influential Park Street Church for 33 years, founding president of the National Association of Evangelicals, co-founder and first president of Fuller Theological Seminary, first president of Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and a key player in the creation of the periodical Christianity Today.\n\nAt Taylor, the Honors Guild is a community of students, faculty, and other mentors who want to use critical thinking abilities in a holistic way, connecting research with practice, scholarship with service, and thoughtful study with meaningful social action. Member graduates are indicated by an *.\n\nUniversity Mace\n\nThe mace is carried this year by 2024-25 Student Body Vice President Briona Graham. The mace signifies the authority vested in the University President by the Board of Trustees. The mace used in today’s ceremony is an African walking stick that once belonged to Bishop William Taylor, the University’s namesake. It was donated by Temple United Methodist Church of San Francisco in 1997.\n\nAcademic Procession\n\nThe order of march at Taylor University is functional, not hierarchical. Leading the procession are the flag bearers followed by faculty marshals and then the faculty, who are grouped by department. The faculty then form a corridor through which the graduates pass in review. The graduates are led by the Taylor University shields and student marshals.\n\nAt the conclusion of the graduate candidates’ entrance, the platform party, led by the University mace, enters.\n\nAcademic Regalia\n\nToday’s academic dress has its origin in the Middle Ages when scholars adopted robes and hooded capes for warmth. In the United States of America, the gown is usually black, pattern varying with the degree held. The hood is the most distinctive part of the academic costume. Hoods are lined with silk in the colors of the institution granting the degree. The color of the velvet binding on the hood designates the discipline in which the degree is held. Colors seen in today’s ceremony include:\n\nThe History and Heritage of Taylor University\n\nFounded in 1846, Taylor University has established itself as a pre-eminent Christian educational institution, training women and men for lifelong learning and ministering the redemptive love, grace, and truth of Jesus Christ to a world in need.\n\nForged in the fire of intense religious beliefs, Taylor began as Fort Wayne Female College, founded with the conviction that women as well as men should have an opportunity for higher education. The school became Fort Wayne College several years later when men were admitted, and in 1890 merged with the Fort Wayne College of Medicine, changed its name to Taylor University, and in 1983, moved to Upland, Indiana. Ninety-nine years later in 1992, Taylor University reestablished itself in Fort Wayne with a merger/acquisition agreement with Summit Christian College (formerly Fort Wayne Bible College), creating Taylor University Fort Wayne (TUFW). While operations on the campus ceased on May 31, 2009, the legacy of alumni and friends of the campus lives on and is preserved through digital archives.\n\nGod has used the lives of many to shape the University into the Taylor we know today. One of those individuals was the University’s namesake, Methodist Episcopal Bishop William Taylor, a missionary evangelist who was known as the St. Paul of the nineteenth century. Taylor was born in Virginia after his grandfather emigrated his family from Ireland. Known for his evangelistic zeal, Taylor traveled for more than 50 years as a missionary and amassed a quarter-of-a-million miles of ocean voyages to proclaim the love of Jesus Christ. The bagpiper in today’s program recalls and honors Bishop Taylor’s Scotch-Irish heritage.\n\nAnother influential individual was Samuel Morris, a Liberian student who studied at Taylor prior to the University’s move to Upland. He died from pneumonia in 1893, but his passion for Jesus Christ impacted and changed Taylor so significantly that we celebrate his legacy today with sculptures, scholarship programs, and a residence hall that bears his name.\n\nStudent, alumnus, and administrator Dr. Milo A. Rediger was a graduate of the class of 1939 and served the University as a Dean of Students and the Academic Dean for many years. He was instrumental in Taylor’s first accreditation in 1947 and later served as President. As quoted in Dr. William C. Ringenberg’s book Taylor University: The First 150 Years, Dr. Rediger claimed, “People are more important than paper and policy; caring is better than manipulation; serving is better than power.” His people-focused philosophy helped shape Taylor for the coming decades.\n\nTaylor University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation, Council for Higher Education Accreditation, National Association of Schools of Music, Council on Social Work Education, Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, Commission on English Language Program Accreditation, Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs. The University is a founding member of the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities and the Christian College Consortium, and a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability, among others. Numerous honors and distinctions have been awarded the University, including ranking in the region’s top three institutions, many times at number one, for 28 consecutive years in US News and World Report.\n\nOur graduates serve God and humanity throughout the world in professions ranging from computer programming, teaching, and media communication to ministry, medicine, and business. Taylor is deeply encouraged by the annual alumni giving, which is more than double the national average. The institution’s administration, faculty, staff, students, and alumni stand committed to the Taylor heritage of intentional Christian community, robust academic discovery, and deep global engagement with faithful service.\n\nRetiring Faculty Members\n\nDr. Robert Davis\n\nProfessor of Physics\n\nDr. Robert (Bob) Davis concludes 29 years of service to the Taylor University faculty.\n\nHe holds his B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from Illinois State University and a Ph.D. in Physics from Purdue University.\n\nPrior to joining the Taylor faculty, Dr. Davis taught at Frontier High School (Chalmers, IN) for 13 years.\n\nDuring his time at Taylor, Bob has taught numerous courses in many areas including Physics and Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Mathematics, Information Systems, and Inter-Area Studies.\n\nHe authored two separate editions of the Instructor’s Solutions Manual for two physics textbooks, for a total of four manuals.\n\nIn 2022, Dr. Davis received the Teaching Excellence and Campus Leadership award.\n\nHe and his wife, Ellen, will be celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary in July this year. They also have five children (four of whom are Taylor graduates), and 13 grandchildren.\n\nDr. Laura Edwards\n\nDepartment Chair and Associate Professor of Psychology\n\nDr. Laura Edwards concludes 11 years of service to the Taylor University faculty.\n\nShe holds her B.A. in Counseling from Berean University, M.A in Clinical Psychology from Wheaton College, and an Ed.D. in Educational Psychology from Regent University.\n\nPrior to joining the Taylor faculty, Dr. Edwards served 22 years of missionary service in Brazil with One Mission Society, counseled and taught in a Bible college, seminary, and counseling graduate programs.\n\nDuring her time at Taylor, Laura has taught classes in Psychology and is also the Department Chair. In 2020, she was the recipient of the Dr. Joe Burnworth Teaching Award. She has also published book chapters and several academic articles.\n\nFor Laura, teaching at TU was a dream come true. She shares an empty nest with her husband of 40 years, Jeff. They have five grandchildren, and she looks forward to staying connected with the TU community."
