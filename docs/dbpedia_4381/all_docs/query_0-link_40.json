        "text": "A Martin has that classic tone. If there's a word I would use to describe it, it's 'elegant.' It's very warm, a fair amount of low mids, it just sounds so perfect. I was playing at a folk festival, and they had a songwriter-in-the-round section. One of the songwriters had a D-41, and every time she strummed a chord, my head snapped around. It just sounds so perfect.\n\nTaylors are a lot more aggressive than Martins, IMO. A lot more bass and treble, with a midrange scoop. Great if you want to carve through a crowded mix, or make your solo stand out. Not as good as a Martin or Gibson for the solo singer/songwriter thing, but Gibson's quality control is {censored}. One guitar has that classic tone, and the next is good only for firewood.\n\nI would also recommend a Larriv\n\nThis is actually a topic that is near and dear to my heart. I've played Martin acoustics since 1970. My first one was a D18, and after two sets of frets and three neck resets it sounds like heaven.\n\nFor recording, I use a 00016CRGTE. I bought it for a play that I did for my university in 2001.\n\nIf I would have had $3000 at the time, I would have bought the Eric Clapton version, but I'm really happy with what I got. It's great for recording and performing. My D-18 sounds great too, but it has a stout bottom end that can get boomy through my microphones.\n\nMartins have a more balanced sound with a signature midrange that I've always loved (listen to Neil Young's After the Gold Rush or anything acoustic by Stephen Stills).\n\nTaylors have, as someone mentioned already, a slightly scooped sound with a tinkly top end. A lot of people like the sound, especially female singer songwriters like Sara McGlaughlin.\n\nI wouldn't rule out Gibson either. The sound is drier than Martin or Taylor. Check out anything acoustic by Pete Townshend for a sample.\n\nFor $3000, I'd also check Collings and Santa Cruz.\n\nI have a Taylor and a Martin. I paid $700 for the Taylor and (a bit) more than $3k for the Martin. I have a nice handmade acoustic dred as well.\n\nThe Taylor is a good guitar, but not a great one. It plays well and in tune. I prefer the other two, and if I had a criticism, it would be that it has no \"soul\".\n\nThe Martin on the other hand is what I think of as an acoustic guitar. The sound is what I have in my mind that I should hear, something the other dread - despite being very good - does not have.\n\nThe Martin is not as easy to play, even though it plays well. I can even do things on it that I can't on others (it's the 1.75\" nut). But it is very powerful - not at all polite. BTW - it's a D-28 Marquis, $2900 if you skip the burst.\n\nIn the end, when dropping so much scratch, the best thing is to play a lot of guitars and let the right one find you.\n\nFor Bears - Piano bass notes aren't the exclusive province of Taylors, maybe you just haven't played the right Martins.\n\nBTW - My vote for best recording guitar under $3k would be a Martin D-18GE (Hogs record better).\n\nSurprised no one has said it, but it sounds like you don't what you want. You simply name the two biggest brands and then to make it worse say \"size does not matter\". Realistically no one can really help you there. They can give some examples of good guitars but no matter how good a guitar is it needs to fit the application. Its like making a thread saying \"I'm buying an amp, is marshall or mesa boogie better\" You can't get anything useful from asking that\n\nBut, if it helps I will recount my experience from buying my acoustic, mind you that this will only be useful if you want a grand auditorium cutaway with electronics. I started looking at Takamines, as I could get a discount from a friend at kaman. I played some dreadnoughts from the supernatural series that were nice, but I was looking for an auditorium size cutaway and couldn't find any to play. I kinda gave up on the idea, not sure why, because I could have gotten a Nashville series at dealer cost if I wanted\n\nIn any event the next guitar I looked at was the breedlove atlas series. This was my least favorite of the guitars I played. Sound was warm, but too warm. It was like there was a blanket over it. It just sounded dead, everything else was past my price point but I didn't want to settle for something I didn't like\n\nNext I tried the taylors and martins. Ironically I thought the martins felt better. The taylor necks felt cramped and uncomfortable. The martin necks felt kinda stiff and wied, but definitely better. Sound wise nothing blew me away. The taylors, with prices from $1500-$3000 all had an a treble sound I couldn't get over, it was there no matter what price or body wood. The martins $1500-$1600 were warmer than the taylors, which was good, but didn't sound very full. The rosewood model sounded better than the mahogany but it felt like there was something missing. The bodies were pretty thin, that might have something to do with it\n\nI heard about Yairis through a friend and found a dealer nearby. This one felt right from the start, neck was the perfect size, and it was so much livelier and resonant than the Martins. Took it home that day. If I didn't find the Yairi I probably would have gone with a Takamine"
