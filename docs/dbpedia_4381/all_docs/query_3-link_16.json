        "text": "I wonder where Hussein comes in in the official rankings. Orion205 (talk) 04:16, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nI got a few of my friends to help me rank all of the presidents' middle names semi-democratically. Hussein came in at 4th. It would have been third if I hadn't exercised my veto powers as official list-writer to give Robinette third place over their objections--162.158.62.107 00:32, 5 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nGamaliel sounds like an Elvish name...108.162.216.128 05:03, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nNo, it's a highwayman. 162.158.155.24 10:54, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nI thought it sounds like an angel or daemon name. Barmar (talk) 02:14, 4 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nI would assume his parents were thinking about someone a bit nicer. Perhaps Raban Gamaliel, a famous Jewish sage, major contributor to the Talmud and Christian saint (in some churches). Shamino (talk) 13:57, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nFor the record, this was his paternal grandmother's maiden name. RAGBRAIvet (talk) 09:18, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nMy understanding of the title text is that Hayes was previously in 3rd position, but has been demoted to 4th and no longer appears in the top 3, not that he is at the bottom of the list.141.101.99.243 09:39, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nThe title text literally says \"The bottom of the list\". How can you read that as not meaning \"the bottom of the list\"??? 141.101.69.153 10:44, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nThough I don't read it as this, you could take it as two separate statements:\n\n\"The bottom of the list remains unchanged.\" <- there has been no shuffling at the 'worst' end.\n\n\"Poor Rutherford Birchard Hayes.\" <- alas! For he has been shuffled out of the top three!\n\nLooking at the entire list of middle names with an arbitrary eye for 'Prettiness', I would definitely put \"Birchard\" in the bottom half, probably bottom handful, possibly indeed the bottom slot. But then I'd do much the same for \"Fitzgerald\" too. (That's on a 'prettiest' scale that is pleasant/ugly, not a decorative/plain axis, just so you know. And does contain subjectivities like Werty22's interpretation of \"Delano\".) 162.158.158.155 14:27, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nThe list also literally only includes the top three, so my initial interpretation of the title text was that Hayes was previously in the 2nd position but is now off the list... perhaps due to a re-evaluation of the 'prettiness' of \"Birchard\". This would leave the bottom of the list (i.e. No. 3) unchanged.\n\nI interpret \"the list\" as being the complete ranking, and he's just showing the top of the leaderboard. Since I think that Burchard could hardly be #4. Too bad this isn't a continuation of a series that he updates every time we elect a new POTUS, so we could see what it actually was previously. Barmar (talk) 02:14, 4 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nI think someone needs to do a survey; maybe run a bracket or something, to see if public opinion matches Randall's list. Angel (talk) 11:33, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nThis is a great idea.\n\nAnyone anything meaningful to add? I think we can remove the incomplete-tag, no? Elektrizikekswerk (talk) 12:21, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nI \"completed\" it. Elektrizikekswerk (talk) 08:38, 4 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nI just wanted to say that Delano in Spanish sounds like \"del ano\" which means \"from the anus\". Not sure that was intended, but it's pretty funny. Werty22 (talk) 13:00, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nDoes anyone else think Randall's jumping the gun a bit? I mean, I acknowledge that President-Elect Biden becoming President next month is by far more likely than any other scenario, but it still feels wrong to assume it's going to happen. (Also, I believe \"Quincy\", \"Ulysses\", and \"Baines\" should round out the current top five.) Mathmannix (talk) 13:55, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nlol 162.158.255.152 20:00, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nSince it's not yet 2021, yet the title says \"Updated for 2021\", I see this as a seeing-into-the-future piece, along one particular timeline. John.Adriaan (talk) 01:56, 4 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nI figured it was important to add Harry Truman, since he does in fact have a middle name, even though it is only one letter long. Easwaran (talk) 18:23, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nThat probably makes his the coolest, even if it's not the prettiest. Shamino (talk) 18:30, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nShould this comic be added to the \"rankings\" category? Hamjudo (talk) 20:44, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nJust riffing on the idea of middle names. My father, Sam, had no middle name but routinely filled in forms that asked for a middle name with the letter E. He reasoned that made sense since people often called him Sammy, and he could never resist an opportunity to tell a joke. On the other hand, my middle initial is J and my middle name is Jay. Go figure. Rtanenbaum (talk) 21:56, 3 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nMy father also had no middle name, but used A whenever a form insisted on needing a middle initial. I don't remember why, and he's not around any more to ask. Barmar (talk) 02:14, 4 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nWhen working at a particular job where various industry memberships and subscriptions were expected to be partaken of, for 'networking' reasons, I took the opportunity (lacking any 'middle' name) of registering as \"Firstname A Lastname\", \"Firstname B Lastname\", etc, per occasion. It was interesting to track and correlate what other unsolicited junk turned up with clear indication of where my details had come from. Mostly as personal entertainment, admitedly. 141.101.98.128 02:48, 4 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nSurely Bush does not have a middle name, or do we apply the rule for calculating medians and average the two giving Berwal. 141.101.98.96\n\nWhy would that not be Bertwal? (Although Berwal is prettier.) And wouldn't a single Bush middle name be Walker? That is the middle of the three internal names of the two Presidents Bush. (George Herbert Walker Bush + George Walker Bush => Herbert Walker Walker => Walker)DaBunny42 (talk) 13:08, 4 December 2020 (UTC)"
