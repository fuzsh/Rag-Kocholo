Martin, MD is a native of Connecticut who received a Bachelor of Science (Phi Beta Kappa, Magna Cum Laude) from Georgetown University in Washington, DC. He then received his MD from the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. After medical school, he completed a residency in urology at Yale-New Haven Hospital. After residency, he obtained a fellowship in Endourology and minimally invasive surgery at the New York Hospital/Cornell University Medical Center in New York.\n\nSince completing his fellowship in 1996, Dr. Martin has been in practice in New Haven. His practice has focused on minimally invasive surgical approaches to urologic cancers, urinary tract stone disease and prostate disease. He performed the first laparoscopic urologic procedures at the Hospital of St. Raphael and was involved in the establishment of the first robotic surgery program in southern Connecticut at St. Raphael as well. He was named director of robotic surgery at St. Raphael and has led multiple efforts to ensure that the newest technological advances in surgery and urology are available to the patients served by his practice. He has also been recognized as one of Connecticut’s top urologists by Connecticut Magazine.\n\nDr. Martin has an interest in education and has won awards for teaching from both the urology residents and physician assistants at Yale-New Haven. He also has taught urologists throughout New England in both laparoscopic and robotic surgical techniques. He has published articles and textbook chapters on laparoscopic surgery, minimally invasive kidney stone and prostate surgeries, as well as bladder physiology. He also was the first author of the chapter on Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL), a non-invasive kidney stone therapy, in the seventh edition of Campbell’s Urology, the major textbook of urology. More importantly, his commitment to education is translated to patient care as he emphasizes the education of his patients as a critical step in managing their clinical problems. He firmly believes that the time taken to help a patient better understand their particular problem will help that patient achieve a better outcome.\n\nDr. Martin resides in Madison with his wife and two sons. He has interests outside of urology in cycling, photography, and travel."
