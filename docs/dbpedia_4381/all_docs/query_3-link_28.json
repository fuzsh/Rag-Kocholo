        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nTaylor Swift has become famous for turning heartache into melodies. But the exes and past flings who inspired her chart-topping songs should get some credit, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut knowing who to credit isn't always obvious. Generally speaking, Swift avoids answering specific questions about the people in her songs. And it's not always clear if she's referencing specific people at all.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nBy scrutinizing her lyrics, though, we can figure out the subjects of some of her songs. From her longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn to high school ex Jordan Alford, here are the 17 men who are likely the stars of Taylor Swift's music.\n\nFarai Bennett contributed to a previous version of this article\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Look What You Made Me Do\" likely references Calvin Harris.\n\nCalvin Harris and Swift had what seems to be a messy breakup. After the release of \"This is What You Came For,\" a collaboration between Harris and Rihanna, news leaked that the song's true writer, Nils Sjöberg, was actually Swift herself.\n\nIt was more than a little embarrassing for Harris. Swift hammered it in even further with her recent music video for her generalized revenge song \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" where a headstone for Sjöberg sits in the background of a shot where Swift is zombiefied.\n\nThere are also at least three presiding theories about who the song \"Gorgeous\" is about, one of them being that it's about Harris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom Hiddleston could be the older boyfriend in \"Gorgeous.\"\n\nThe same two songs — \"Look What You Made Me Do\" and \"Gorgeous\" — may also be about Tom Hiddleston.\n\nHiddleswift, as the two were known during their relationship in the summer of 2016, was short-lived. It also took place at a time where Swift scrupulously avoided the press. So it's hard to know exactly how she feels about it.\n\nThe video for \"Look What You Made Me Do\" features Swift in an \"I ♥ T.S.\" T-shirt, which Hiddleston wore at one point, though that seems to be more of a lighthearted jab than anything malicious. And the lyrics for \"Gorgeous\" aren't too specific, but given the timing of its release, it could very well be about him.\n\nHiddleston is also the supposed subject of \"Getaway Car,\" in which Swift sings about using a new man to escape her previous relationship (possibly with Harris).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Gorgeous\" and \"Call It What You Want\" are probably about Joe Alwyn.\n\nSwift's longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn is an actor and model. There are several songs from \"Reputation\" that could be about him, including \"Gorgeous\" and \"Call It What You Want.\"\n\nThe latter song, especially, seems to be about a man she sees as a refuge from personal drama and squabbles with other people. During her relationship with Alwyn, she lived a relatively work-focused, drama-free life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry Styles is the trouble in \"I Knew You Were Trouble.\"\n\n\"I Knew You Were Trouble,\" \"Out of the Woods,\" and \"Style\" were a few of the breakout hits that were most likely sprinkled with details from Swift's on-again-off-again relationship with the former One Directioner and \"Dunkirk\" star.\n\nIn an interview with the Sunday Times, Swift implied that \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" was about Styles after performing in front of him at the British Music Awards in 2013.\n\n\"It's not hard to access that emotion when the person the song is directed at is standing by the side of the stage watching,\" she said.\n\nIt's also kind of easy to tell that \"Style\" is about Styles because of the name of the song and because the guy in the music video looks a lot like him.\n\n\"Out of the Woods\" mentions \"two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying,\" which refers to the matching paper airplane necklaces the couple wore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Dear John\" is pretty clearly about John Mayer.\n\nAfter Swift's song \"Dear John\" was released in 2010, it didn't take long for people to suspect that the title was about her freak breakup from John Mayer.\n\nOutside of her music, Swift stayed mum on the topic of Mayer. But he told Rolling Stone that he felt humiliated by the song.\n\n\"I will say as a songwriter that I think it's kind of cheap songwriting,\" he says. \"I know she's the biggest thing in the world, and I'm not trying to sink anybody's ship, but I think it's abusing your talent to rub your hands together and go, 'Wait till he gets a load of this!'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJake Gyllenhaal might have inspired three different Swift songs.\n\nUnlike Mayer, Jake Gyllenhaal appeared to bee clueless about the reports that \"All Too Well\" is about him.\n\nWhen Howard Stern told Gyllenhaal that Swift wrote a song about him, he acted like he didn't know what he was talking about.\n\nSwift sang, \"Left my scarf there at your sister's house / And you've still got it in your drawer, even now.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for Us Weekly to decode the mystery that Gyllenhaal and Taylor spent Thanksgiving together a few months before their breakup. In the photos from their getaway, you can see Swift was wearing (what people think is) the same scarf.\n\nOther songs on \"Red,\" including \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" \"The Last Time,\" \"The Moment I Knew,\" and the title track, seem to reference their brief yet intense relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor Lautner confirmed that he inspired \"Back to December.\"\n\n\"Back to December\" was a rare song where Swift apologized to one of her exes. Fans quickly figured out the song was about Lautner because of their relationship's timeline.\n\nThe pair began dating after meeting on the set of the movie \"Valentines Day\" back in August 2009 and broke it off in December of that year. The lyrics also hinted toward the \"Twilight\" star as she sang, \"I miss your tan skin and sweet smile.\"\n\nYears later, Lautner confirmed that Swift wrote \"Back to December\" about him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe Jonas seemed to inspire \"Last Kiss\" and \"Forever & Always.\"\n\nWhen Joe Jonas infamously broke up with Taylor Swift during a 27-second phone call, there was no telling how she was going to handle putting the singer in his place.\n\n\"Last Kiss\" and \"Forever & Always\" seemed to chronicle the timeline of the pair's relationship in 2008. In one of the lyrics for \"Forever & Always,\" Swift sings, \"I ran off that plane July 9,\" which happened to be a tour date for one of the Jonas Brothers concerts back in 2008.\n\nSwift's song \"Better Than Revenge\" also seems to be a jab at the actress Camilla Belle, who had allegedly come between Swift and Jonas, and \"Holy Ground\" might reference him as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConor Kennedy was likely the subject of \"Begin Again.\"\n\nBy the time her new single \"Begin Again\" was released in 2012, it didn't take long for people to link the lyrics of the song to Swift's then-boyfriend Conor Kennedy.\n\nIn the single, Swift talks about the start of a new romance, perhaps with Robert F. Kennedy's grandson, whom she apparently had high hopes for. But they broke up shortly before the song's release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrew Hardwick's name is right there in the lyrics for \"Teardrops on My Guitar.\"\n\nAlthough Drew Hardwick and Taylor Swift never technically dated, she's been very vocal about \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" being about a high school crush.\n\n\"[He] would sit there every day talking to me about... another girl: how beautiful she was, how nice and smart and perfect she was,\" Swift said on her official site. \"And I sat there and listened, never meaning it any of the times I said, 'Oh, I'm so happy for you.'\"\n\nIt's probably the song in Swift's discography that's most explicitly about another, real person. Swift uses Hardwick's name right in the song's lyrics (\"Drew looks at me\").\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Enchanted\" included a reference to Owl City singer Adam Young.\n\nAfter Owl City released its hit single \"Fireflies\" in 2009, lead singer Adam Young captured a lot of attention, including that of Taylor Swift.\n\nShe released her song \"Enchanted\" and encoded Young's first name in the \"Speak Now\" liner notes. He told Us Weekly that he and Swift talked for a few months after she attended one of his shows.\n\n\"She made some comment that I used the word 'enchanted' and the word 'wonderstruck' in an email,\" he said. \"And she said how she had never heard anyone really use that word before. So when that word was in the song, I was like, 'this song has to be about me.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Hey Stephen\" is likely about her tour buddy Stephen Barker Liles.\n\n\"Hey Stephen\" was written around the same time Swift toured with the Love & Theft musician Stephen Barker Liles. Liles was surprised that it was actually a nice song about their romance.\n\n\"She doesn't really write very many nice songs about guys,\" Liles told Taste of Country. \"So I was very relieved when it turned out to be a nice song, and it's actually one of the nicest things anybody's ever done for me.\"\n\nLiles returned the favor, releasing a song about her a few months later called \"Try to Make It Anyway.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though they had a brief relationship, Martin Johnson seems to be the subject of three Swift songs.\n\nWhen recording the song \"Two is Better Than One\" for \"Hannah Montana: The Movie,\" Swift reportedly fell for Boys Like Girls singer Martin Johnson.\n\nAfter breaking up, fans theorized that Martin was the subject of three of Swift's songs: \"Love Story,\" \"White Horse,\" and \"If This Was a Movie.\"\n\nAccording to Complex, Swift was really into Johnson, but ended things because her camp thought his punk-rock background wouldn't be good fit for her image.\n\nThis reasoning explains her lyric in \"Love Story,\" where Swift sang, \"I sneak out to the garden to see you. We keep quiet because we're dead if they knew,\" which supposedly references her publicists' advice to stay away from him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam Armstrong is one of Swift's three high school boyfriends she's rumored to have written about.\n\nThe trend of Swift's supposed revenge breakup songs started with her high-school boyfriend Sam Armstrong, according to Complex.\n\nHer 2006 single \"Should've Said No,\" is rumored to be based on Armstrong cheating on her.\n\nSwift sang, \"You should've said, 'No,' you should've gone home / You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go,\" revealing that Armstrong had cheated on her with another girl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan Alford reportedly cheated on Swift with his now-wife, inspiring \"Picture to Burn.\"\n\nAnother early boyfriend song is said to be \"Picture to Burn,\" about another high school ex, Jordan Alford, who supposedly cheated on her with his now-wife.\n\nShe released it when she was just 16 years old, which could help explain the homophobic lyrics: \"So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy / That's fine, I'll tell mine that you're gay.\"\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
