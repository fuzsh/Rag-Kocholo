        "text": "State Court of Bibb County\n\nWelcome to the State Court of Bibb County website. We hope the information on this website will be helpful. If you have any questions, please call the Clerk’s Office: (478) 621-6200.\n\nIf you have a traffic citation that directs you to appear in State Court, you may be able to pay the citation without coming to Court. Click on the link “Traffic Tickets/Citations.” Please note many traffic citations are issued for Macon-Bibb County Municipal Court, which is not this Court. The Municipal Court has a separate website and a separate process for its tickets.\n\nAnyone who has they have a valid basis to be excused from Court should contact the chambers of Judge Sharell Lewis (478-310-3637), at least seventy-two (72) hours before the scheduled Court date. Leaving a voice mail does not relieve a party of the requirement to appear on the scheduled Court date. Failure to appear for a Court date in a criminal case may result in a warrant for your arrest.\n\nMost civil hearings are being held virtually, but the public is welcome to observe in person.\n\nThe Court is handling all inmate cases (arraignments, pleas, probation revocations) virtually on Tuesdays at 8:15 AM. These may be observed in the courtroom at the J. Taylor Phillips Courthouse.\n\nFor in-person proceedings, facial coverings are not required, but are permitted.\n\nCriminal case e-filing is available. Pleadings may be filed through PeachCourt. (Click on the link on the website to register and file. There is no cost to e-file in criminal cases.) All lawyers and parties are encouraged to file pleadings electronically rather than in person; however, e-filing is not presently mandatory in criminal cases. Please note that PeachCourt is a portal for filing pleadings, but PeachCourt is not the Court’s file. When you search the filings on PeachCourt, you are not searching the Court’s file. If you have questions or issues related to PeachCourt, go to https://peachcourt.com. There is a “Need Help” link on their website.\n\nCivil case e-filing is mandatory in most civil cases. Even in older cases in which e-filing may not be mandatory, lawyers and parties are encouraged to file pleadings electronically rather than in person. Pleadings may be filed through PeachCourt.

Thank you for your flexibility and cooperation.\n\n-Jeff Hanson\n\nChief Judge, State Court of Bibb County"
