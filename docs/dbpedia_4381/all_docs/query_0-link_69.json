        "text": "James Taylor is a dad to four talented children. The “Fire and Rain” singer has two children, Sarah Maria \"Sally\" Taylor and Benjamin Simon \"Ben\" Taylor, with ex-wife Carly Simon, to whom he was married from 1972 to 1983.\n\nJames also has two children, twin sons Henry and Rufus, with his wife, Caroline “Kim” Smedvig-Taylor, a musician and former director of marketing for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The couple married in February 2001 and welcomed their sons via surrogate in April of that year.\n\nJames told Parade in 2022 that he appreciated being an older parent to his twin sons, who were born when he was 53. “There’s a point where you’re ready,” he said. “You’re settled down enough; you’re not constantly trying to find your place.”\n\nHere’s everything to know about James Taylor’s four children: Sally, Ben, Henry and Rufus.\n\nSarah Maria \"Sally\" Taylor, 49\n\nJames and Simon’s first child, Sarah Maria \"Sally\" Taylor, was born on Jan. 7, 1974. She is married to Dean Bragonier, with whom she has one son, Bodhi Taylor Bragonier, born in October 2007.\n\nSally is an artist, a teacher and, like her famous parents, a musician. She founded Consenses, an arts education organization. She often spends time with her mom and has shared photos with her on Instagram. Simon has also shared throwback photos of the two.\n\nSally and her brother Ben have also performed with their mom. In 2007, Simon told PEOPLE that performing together was one of her favorite family activities. “We’re good at taking each other’s suggestions and criticisms,” she said. “Well, the criticisms are a bit more challenging, but we get through it!”\n\nSally has also performed with her dad. In 2018, the two sang together at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art — where Sally’s exhibition, “Come to Your Senses: Art to See, Smell, Hear, Taste and Touch,” was on display — to raise money for arts education. Sally and James spoke to the Berkshire Eagle before their father-daughter performance. “It's been a while since Sally and I shared the stage and made music together. It is something I've always loved,\" James said in a statement.\n\n\"When it came to learning how to play guitar, neither of my parents taught me how to do it, and I think that was probably intentional because I do believe songwriting has to come,” Sally said of their music. “If you’re meant to write music, you have to find out your own process.\"\n\nIn May 2020, Sally celebrated Mother’s Day and posted a photo with her brother Ben and their mom. “Happy Mothers Day mama. You make my heart sing. Thank you for being there always for me and Benjer,” she wrote in the caption.\n\nSally also enjoys knitting, taking walks and painting.\n\nBenjamin Simon \"Ben\" Taylor, 46\n\nThe second of James and Simon’s kids, Benjamin Simon \"Ben\" Taylor, was born on Jan. 22, 1977. Like his parents, Ben is a musician — he plays guitar and sings. He writes songs and shares videos about music theory and music production. He has also recorded songs with his mom.\n\nOn his website, Ben shared that he “didn’t start singing until his early 20s,\" and told Parade in 2011 that his father wanted him to be clear-eyed about the profession: \"My dad let me know that it's a blue-collar job, that the glamour of it is largely created by the media. So I knew what I was getting into.”\n\nIn 2007, Simon told PEOPLE about Ben’s relationship with his sister Sally. “[They] fought terribly. Since Sally is three years older than Ben, she always bossed him around — until one day he fought back,” she said. “He actually slapped her on the back, and they both ended up crying. For the first time he felt empathy for her, and she realized they were equals. They’ve been close ever since.”\n\nSimon also shared that Ben and Sally inspired her music — specifically the song “Love of My Life.” “I wrote [it] in 1992 but also included on my new album,” she said. “The lyrics are: ‘I love lilacs and avocados / Ukuleles and fireworks / And Mia Farrow and walking in the snow / But you’ve got to know that / You’re the love of my life / From the moment I first saw you / The second that you were born / I know that you were the love of my life.’ ”\n\nBen also gave his dad a shout-out on Instagram in March 2020 with a video of himself chopping wood. “We used to spend weekends with my father in Connecticut. As we had no television, my father showed me how to while the hours away in this manner… I guess I simply never lost the habit,” he captioned the video.\n\nIn January 2020, Ben shared a throwback photo of himself and his dad from his childhood. In the photo, both father and son are dressed in suit jackets. “The good old days,” he captioned the photo.\n\nHenry Taylor, 22\n\nJames and Kim’s son Henry Taylor was born on April 5, 2001.
