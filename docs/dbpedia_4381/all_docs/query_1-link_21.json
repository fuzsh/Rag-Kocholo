        "text": "Ruth Jacqueline Taylor, a cherished mother and respected community member of Waltham, passed away peacefully on June 30, 2024.\n\nShe was born in Boston, the only child of the late John and Ruth (Bailis) Quinn. Ruth grew up in Revere and spent the majority of her life in Waltham. She made an indelible impact on everyone she met.\n\nRuth’s career began after she earned her RN degree, a job she embraced with joy and dedication. Her thirst for knowledge and desire to help others propelled her into a distinguished career in nursing. Known affectionately as “Ruthless Ruth” by her colleagues, she was renowned for her determination and tireless work ethic. Ruth’s commitment and leadership culminated in her role as Executive Director of the Boston Evening Medical Center, a position from which she retired at the impressive age of 80.\n\nRuth’s selflessness was a hallmark of her character. She was the person everyone turned to for help, and she never hesitated to lend a hand. Her home was a sanctuary for those in need, and her generosity knew no bounds. Ruth was a powerhouse, a take-charge person whose boundless energy and enthusiasm for life was truly inspirational.\n\nRuth’s life was enriched by her marriage to her high school sweetheart, George H. Taylor, whom she married at the age of 21. Their enduring love story was a testament to her devotion and the deep connections she made throughout her life. The two were rarely seen apart from their Pearson 30 sail boat “Act 3”. George would sail and Ruth would find a comfortable spot to embroider. They would sail to Newport, RI every weekend to enjoy all the local charm. Ruth and George’s mutual love for the ocean brought them on adventures chartering sailboats in the British Virgin Islands. They enjoyed many cruises and traveled often. Their favorite vacation spot was Anna Maria Island in Florida where they found relaxation and delight.\n\nRuth was a caring and thoughtful mother, always ready with sage advice and keen street smarts. Her wisdom was always forthcoming and her children were blessed by her guidance and love. Her grandchildren, who lovingly referred to her as “Tata”, were a main pillar of her happiness and loved each one of them unconditionally.\n\nShe was predeceased by her loving husband George H. Taylor.\n\nRuth is survived by her adoring children Tricia Law and her husband Andy of Tucson, AZ and Jaime Princiotta and her husband David of Burlington, MA, Her grandchildren, Pamela Princiotta, Adam Princiotta, Jodi Princiotta, Nathan Law and his wife Jean and Robert Law and his wife Paige, great grandchildren, Xerxes, Xyriel, Juniper and Sebastian Law as well as several friends.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Ruth's name to the Boston Evening Clinic Foundation,1087 Beacon Street, Suite 301, Newton, MA 02459\n\nFuneral Services will be held on Wednesday, July 3rd at 10:00 a.m. at Heritage Park Baptist Church, 129 Lexington Street, Burlington, MA. Burial will immediately follow at Woodlawn Cemetery, Everett."
