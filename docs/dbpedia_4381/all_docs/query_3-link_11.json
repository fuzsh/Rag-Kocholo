        "text": "[U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual] [Chapter 9 - Abbreviations and Letter Symbols] [From the U.S. Government Publishing Office, www.gpo.gov] 9.1. Abbreviations and letter symbols are used to save space and to avoid distracting the reader by use of repetitious words or phrases. 9.2. The nature of the publication governs the extent to which abbreviations are used. In the text of technical and legal publications, and in parentheses, brackets, footnotes, sidenotes, tables, leaderwork, and bibliographies, many words are frequently abbreviated. Heads, legends, tables of contents, and indexes follow the style of the text. 9.3. Internal and terminal punctuation in symbols represening units of measure are to be omitted to conform with practice adopted by scientific, technical, and industrial groups. Where the omission of terminal punctuation causes confusion; e.g., the symbol in (inch) mistaken for the preposition in, the symbol should be spelled out. 9.4. Standard and easily understood forms are preferable, and they should be uniform throughout a job. Abbreviations not generally known should be followed in the text by the spelled-out forms in parentheses the first time they occur; in tables and leaderwork such explanatory matter should be supplied in a footnote. As the printer cannot rewrite the copy, the author should supply these explanatory forms. 9.5. In technical matter, symbols for units of measure should be used only with figures; similarly, many other abbreviations and symbols should not appear in isolation. For example, energy is measured in foot-pounds, not energy is measured in ftlbs. Capitals, hyphens, periods (points), and spacing 9.6. In general, an abbreviation follows the capitalization and hyphenation of the word or words abbreviated. It is followed by a period unless otherwise indicated. c.o.d. St. but ftlb 9.7.

United States military titles and abbreviations Officer rank Officer ranks in the United States military consist of commissioned officers and warrant officers. The commissioned ranks are the highest in the military. Th ese officers hold presidential commissions and are confirmed at their ranks by the Senate. Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps offi cers are called company grade officers in the pay grades of O-1 to O-3, field grade officers in pay grades O-4 to O-6, and general officers in pay grades O-7 and higher. The equivalent officer groupings in the Navy are called junior grade, mid-grade, and flag. Warrant officers hold warrants from their service secretary and are specialists and experts in certain military technologies or capabilities. The lowest ranking warrant officers serve under a warrant, but they receive commissions from the President upon promotion to chief warrant officer 2. These commissioned warrant officers are direct representatives of the President of the United States. They derive their authority from the same source as commissioned officers but remain specialists, in contrast to commissioned officers, who are generalists. There are no warrant officers in the Air Force. [GRAPHIC OMITTED IN TIFF FORMAT(S)] Enlisted rank Service members in pay grades E-1 through E-3 are usually either in some kind of training status or on their initial assignment. The training includes the basic training phase where recruits are immersed in military culture and values and are taught the core skills required by their service component. Basic training is followed by a specialized or advanced training phase that provides recruits with a specific area of expertise or concentration. In the Army and Marines, this area is called a military occupational specialty; in the Navy it is known as a rate; and in the Air Force it is simply called an Air Force specialty. Leadership responsibility significantly increases in the mid-level enlisted ranks. This responsibility is given formal recognition by use of the terms noncommissioned officer and petty officer. An Army sergeant, an Air Force staff sergeant, and a Marine corporal are considered NCO ranks. Th e Navy NCO equivalent, petty officer, is achieved at the rank of petty offi cer third class. At the E-8 level, the Army, Marines, and Air Force have two positions at the same pay grade. Whether one is, for example, a senior master sergeant or a first sergeant in the Air Force depends on the person's job. The same is true for the positions at the E-9 level. Marine Corps master gunnery sergeants and sergeants major receive the same pay but have diff erent responsibilities. E-8s and E-9s have 15 to 30 years on the job, and are commanders� senior advisers for enlisted matters. A third E-9 element is the senior enlisted person of each service. The sergeant major of the Army, the sergeant major of the Marine Corps, the master chief petty officer of the Navy, and the chief master sergeant of the Air Force are the spokespersons of the enlisted force at the highest levels of their services.
