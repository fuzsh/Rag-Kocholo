With the ascent of Taylor Swift‘s “Bad Blood” to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, its co-writer/producer Max Martin tallies his 20th chart-topper as a songwriter.

Taylor Swift’s ‘Bad Blood’ Blasts to No. 1 on the Hot 100

Martin (real name: Martin Sandberg) co-wrote “Bad Blood” with Swift, Johan Karl “Shellback” Schuster and the song’s guest artist, Kendrick Lamar. Martin remains in third place among songwriters with the most No. 1s in the Hot 100’s 56-year history. He trails only Paul McCartney, with 32 No. 1s, and John Lennon (26). (In addition, “Bad Blood” is Shellback’s ninth No. 1 as a writer.)

Martin also produced “Bad Blood” (with Shellback), and thus also earns his 18th leader as a producer. (It’s the eighth No. 1 produced by Shellback.) Among all producers, only another Martin — George Martin — has more No. 1s, with 23. Of those 23 chart-toppers, 19 were for The Beatles. In third place, with 16 No. 1s each, are Jimmy Jam, Dr. Luke and Terry Lewis.

Below is a recap of Martin’s 20 Hot 100 No. 1s as a writer. His first, Britney Spears‘ “…Baby One More Time,” is his only No. 1 that he solely wrote and produced. He wrote all his other No. 1s in collaboration with others. (Of his leaders, only ‘NSYNC’s “It’s Gonna Be Me” and Katy Perry‘s “I Kissed a Girl” were not also produced by Martin.)
