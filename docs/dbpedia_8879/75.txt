George Harrison Biography

George Harrison, an English musician and singer-songwriter, rose to prominence around the world as the Beatles‘ lead guitarist. Harrison, who was sometimes referred to as “the quiet Beatle,” loved Indian culture and contributed to the expansion of popular music by incorporating Indian instruments and spirituality that was in line with Hinduism. The majority of Beatles albums from 1965 onwards included at least two Harrison compositions, despite the fact that John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote the majority of the band’s songs. “Taxman,” “Within You Without You,” “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” “Here Comes the Sun,” and “Something” are some of the songs he wrote for the band.

Harrison was born on February 25, 1943, at 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree, Liverpool.Harrison, who was particularly versed with soul music, functioned as the Beatles’ scout for fresh American albums. He started to influence the other Beatles’ musical tastes by 1965’s Rubber Soul, introducing them to folk rock through his love of the Byrds and Bob Dylan, as well as Indian classical music with his usage of the sitar on “Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)”. Later on, he declared Rubber Soul to be his “favorite Beatles album.”

Early musical influences on Harrison were Django Reinhardt and George Formby; later inspirations included Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins, and Chuck Berry. By 1965, he had started to guide the Beatles toward Indian classical music by using Indian instruments, such as the sitar, on numerous Beatles songs, starting with “Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown).” He had also started to introduce them to folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds. He was the driving force behind the band’s adoption of Transcendental Meditation in 1967 and later became associated with the Hare Krishna movement. Harrison’s triple album All Things Must Pass, which received critical praise after the band disbanded in 1970, featured his most popular hit song, “My Sweet Lord,” as well as the slide guitar, which would become his trademark sound as a solo performer. Along with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, he also planned the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh, which served as a model for other charity events like Live Aid. Harrison worked as a music and film producer for the Beatles’ Apple record label before starting Dark Horse Records in 1974 and HandMade Films with his co-founder in 1978.

As a solo artist, Harrison put out a number of top-selling songs and albums. He created the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys with them in 1988. He was a prolific recording artist who worked with artists like Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, and Tom Petty on songs and music. He also appeared as a guest guitarist on songs by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood, and Billy Preston. He was voted 11th among the “100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time” by Rolling Stone magazine. He was twice inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame: once posthumously for his solo career in 2004 and once as a member of the Beatles in 1988.

The first marriage Harrison had, to model Pattie Boyd, ended in divorce in 1977. He married Olivia Arias the next year, and the two were blessed with a son named Dhani. At the age of 58 and two years after escaping a knife attack by an intruder at his Friar Park house, Harrison passed away from lung cancer in 2001.
