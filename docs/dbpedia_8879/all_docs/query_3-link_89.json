        "text": "Of course, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr were not gay, or otherwise. But through the academic lens of \"queering\" — that is, viewing something through a LGBTQ+ and/or queer theory lens — the three dug deep into their philosophical connections to LGBTQ+ identity, from their leather-bound early days in seedy bars, to their cultivation of an androgynous group look, to their rainbow-hued Sgt. Pepper suits.\n\nNaturally, their transformative manager, Brian Epstein is a link to LGBTQ+ identity in Beatles lore — he was a closeted gay man, and tortured about it. Plus, there's that did-they-or-didn't-they holiday to Barcelona that Epstein took with Lennon — still a point of debate among diehards.\n\nBut aside from speculation and extrapolation, there is one core truth: LGBTQ+ people other than Epstein were around the Beatles throughout their history, and after they broke up. Some of these people were pivotal to their very existence — and a world without them would have resulted in a very different Beatles, or none at all.\n\nAs Pride Month winds down, read on for a list of queer figures in the Beatles' universe — compiled thanks to \"Another Kind of Mind.\"\n\nOne Of Their Essential Cavern-Era Movers Was Gay\n\nA larger-than-life figure in the Merseybeat scene and driving force behind the Carvern Club's success, Bob Wooler is crucial to the Beatles' early story; he played a pivotal role in introducing them to Brian Epstein.\n\nUnfortunately, this connection took a dark turn at McCartney's 21st birthday party, in 1963 when Wooler made a reference to Lennon's Barcelona trip with Epstein, calling it a \"honeymoon.\" A drunken Lennon proceeded to attack Wooler, landing him in the hospital.\n\nA Gay Man Aided In Their Hair Evolution\n\nNear the top of Martin Scorcese's must-see 2011 documentary on George Harrison, Living in the Material World, you'll see a teenaged George Harrison with an impressive coiff.\n\nThat photo — and hair — were by Jürgen Vollmer, a German student who befriended the future Fabs during their Hamburg days.\n\nWhile Vollmer's sexuality isn't a public matter, it's established that he had a crush on Harrison; he even altered an I LIKE IKE badge to read I LIKE GEORGE.\n\n\"It was chemical,\" Vollmer once said. \"I liked George the most. He was very quiet and shy, like me, and also a dreamer.\"\n\nPaul McCartney Was Mentored By This Gay Art Dealer\n\nThree hours into episode two of Peter Jackson's Get Back documentary, a suave gentleman, dressed to the nines, saunters into the studio. \"Ah, here's to Robert Fraser,\" Lennon sings; the caption reads \"Art dealer Robert Fraser.\"\n\nRobert Fraser sold art to McCartney, but he was a whole lot more than that; he was a flamboyant, hard-partying dynamo, and a pivotal figure in the London art scene. His artists also worked on the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and White Album covers; a Magritte painting he turned McCartney onto acted as inspiration for the Apple Records logo.\n\nFraser moved to India in the 1970s, and returned to the London scene in the early 1980s. Sadly, his life was cut short; he died of AIDS in 1986, at just 48.\n\nThe \"TV Director\" From A Hard Day's Night Was Played By A Gay Man\n\nRemember the TV director in the fuzzy sweater A Hard Day's Night that the Beatles give a hard time? That's Victor Spinetti, the only non-Beatle appear in three Beatles films — Help! and Magical Mystery Tour included.\n\n\"George Harrison said, 'You've got to be in all our films,'\" Spinetti later recalled. \"I said, 'Why?' And he said, 'Well, if you're not in 'em, me mum won't come and see 'em 'cause she fancies you.'\"\n\n\"Polythene Pam\" Was Partly Inspired By A Bisexual Man\n\nIt's long been Beatles lore that Lennon's Abbey Road medley snippet \"Polythene Pam\" is about a strange character from the Beatles' Cavern days.\n\nPat Dawson (née Hodgett), a fan from their Liverpool days, used to consume the titular material.\n\n\"I used to eat polythene all the time. I'd tie it in knots and then eat it,\" she said in an interview — and that's how she became known as \"Polythene Pat,\" which became \"Pam.\"\n\n\"That was me, remembering a little event with a woman in Jersey, and a man who was England's answer to Allen Ginsberg,\" Lennon recalled in 1980. \"I met him when we were on tour and he took me back to his apartment and I had a girl and he had one he wanted me to meet.\"\n\nWho was said man? None other than Royston Ellis, a bisexual beat poet who often wrote homoerotic yarns.\n\nHe met the Beatles when they were the Silver Beetles, in the early 1960s. He once claimed to the four Beatles that \"one in four men were queer\"; as McCartney put it, \"We looked at each other and wondered which one it was.\"\n\nFor that — and his debatable claim that he convinced them to drop the second 'e' in their name — Ellis's place in Fabs lore was set in stone. He passed a few months ago, in 2023.\n\nAll Music Videos, Forever\n\nRight from that starting gun of an opening chord, A Hard Day's Night's camerawork alone — black and white, inspired by French New Wave and British kitchen sink dramas — pioneers everything from British spy thrillers to \"The Monkees.\"\n\nAcross the film's 87 minutes, you're viscerally dragged into the action; you tumble through the cityscapes right along with John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Not to mention the entire music video revolution; techniques we think of as stock were brand-new here.\n\nAccording to Roger Ebert: \"Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night.\"\n\nEmergent Folk-Rock\n\nGeorge Harrison's 12-string Rickenbacker didn't just lend itself to a jangly undercurrent on the A Hard Day's Night songs; the shots of Harrison playing it galvanized Roger McGuinn to pick up the futuristic instrument — and via the Byrds, give the folk canon a welcome jolt of electricity.\n\nEntire reams of alternative rock, post-punk, power pop, indie rock, and more would follow — and if any of those mean anything to you, partly thank Lester for casting a spotlight on that Rick.\n\nRead more: Living Legends: Roger McGuinn On The History Of The Byrds, His One-Man Show And Editing His Own Wikipedia Page\n\nThe Ultimate Love Triangle Jam\n\nFrom the Byrds' \"Triad\" to Leonard Cohen's \"Famous Blue Raincoat,\" music history is replete with odes to love triangles.\n\nBut none are as desperate, as mannish, as garment-rending, as Derek and the Dominoes' \"Layla,\" where Eric Clapton lays bare his affections for his friend Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd. Where did Harrison meet her? Why, on the set of A Hard Day's Night, where she was cast as a schoolgirl.\n\nDebates, Debates, Debates\n\nSay, what is that famous, clamorous opening chord of A Hard Day's Night's title track? Turns out YouTube's still trying to suss that one out.\n\n\"It is F with a G on top, but you'll have to ask Paul about the bass note to get the proper story,\" Harrison told an online chat in 2001 — the last year of his life.\n\nA Certain Strain Of Loopy Humor\n\nNo wonder Harrison got in with Monty Python later in life: the effortlessly witty lads were born to play these roles — mostly a tumble of non sequiturs, one-liners and daffy retorts. (They were all brought up on the Goons, after all.) When A Hard Day's Night codified their Liverpudlian slant on everything, everyone from the Pythons to Tim and Eric received their blueprint.\n\nThe Legitimacy Of The Rock Flick\n\nWhat did rock 'n' roll contribute to the film canon before the Beatles? A stream of lightweight Elvis flicks? Granted, the Beatles would churn out a few headscratchers in its wake — Magical Mystery Tour, anyone? — but A Hard Day's Night remains a game-changer for guitar boys on screen.\n\nThe best part? The Beatles would go on to change the game again, and again, and again, in so many ways. Don't say they didn't warn you — as you revisit the iconic A Hard Day's Night.\n\nAll surviving band members are interviewed, though a very frail Brian Wilson — who was placed under a conservatorship following the January death of his wife Melinda — appears primarily in archival footage. Additional perspective comes via musicians and producers including Ryan Tedder, Janelle Monáe, Lindsey Buckingham, and Don Was, and USC Vice Provost for the Arts Josh Kun.\n\nThanks to the film’s tight focus and breadth of interviewees, it includes memorable takeaways for both longtime fans and ones this documentary will create. Read on for five takeaways from Disney+'s The Beach Boys.\n\nFamily Is A Double-Edged Sword\n\nFor all the warm, tight-knit imagery of the Beach Boys as a family band, there was an awful lot of darkness at the heart of their sunny sound, and most of the responsibility for that lies with Wilson family patriarch Murry Wilson. Having written a few modest hits in the late 1930s, Murry had talent and a good ear, and he considered himself a largely thwarted genius.\n\nWhen Brian, Dennis, and Carl formed the Beach Boys with their cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine, Murry came aboard as the band’s manager. In many respects, he was capable; his dogged work ethic and fierce protectiveness helped shepherd the group to increasingly high profile successes. He masterminded the extended Wilson family call-in campaign to a local radio station, pushing the Beach Boys’ first single \"Surfin’\" to become the most popular song in Los Angeles. He relentlessly shopped their demos to music labels, eventually landing them a contract at Capitol Records. He supported the band’s strong preference to record at Western Recordings rather than Capitol Records’ own in-house studio, and was an excellent promoter.\n\nMurry Wilson was also extremely controlling, fining the band when they made mistakes or swore, and \"was miserable most of the time,\" according to his wife Audree.\n\nFootage from earlier interviews with Carl and Dennis, and contemporary comments from Mike Love make it clear that Murry was emotionally and physically abusive to his sons throughout their childhoods. He even sold off the Beach Boys’ songwriting catalog without consulting co-owner Brian, a moment that Brian’s ex-wife Marilyn says he felt so keenly that he took to his bed and didn’t get up for three days.\n\nMurry Wilson was at best a very complicated figure, both professionally jealous of his own children to a toxic degree and devoted to ensuring their success.\n\n\"Be My Baby\" and The Wrecking Crew Changed Brian Wilson’s Life\n\n\"Be My Baby,\" which Phil Spector had produced for the Ronettes in 1963, launched the girl group to immediate iconic status. The song also proved life-changing for Brian. On first hearing the song, \"it spoke to my soul,\" and Brian threw himself into learning how Spector created his massive, lush Wall of Sound. Spector’s approach taught Brian that production was a meaningful art that creates an \"overall sound, what [the listeners] are going to hear and experience in two and a half minutes.\"\n\nRead more: How Brian Wilson Crafted The Beach Boys' Early Sound: A Symphony Of Inspirations, From Boogie-Woogie To Barbershop\n\nBy working with The Wrecking Crew — a truly motley bunch of experienced, freewheeling musicians who played on Spector’s records and were over a decade older than the Beach Boys — Brian’s artistic sensibility quickly emerged. According to drummer Hal Blaine and bassist Carol Kaye, Brian not knowing what he didn’t know gave him the freedom and imagination to create sounds that were completely new and innovative.\n\nFriendly Rivalries With Phil Spector & The Beatles Yielded Amazing Pop Music\n\nAccording to popular myth, the Beach Boys and the Beatles saw each other exclusively as almost bitter rivals for the ears, hearts, and disposable income of their fans. The truth is more nuanced: after the initial shock of the British Invasion wore off, the two groups developed and maintained a very productive, admiration-based competition, each band pushing the other to sonic greatness.\n\nCultural historian and academic Josh Kun reframes the relationship between the two bands as a \"transatlantic collaboration,\" and asks, \"If they hadn’t had each other, would they have become what they became?\" Could they have made the historic musical leaps that we now take for granted?\n\nRead more: 10 Memorable Oddities By The Beach Boys: Songs About Root Beer, Raising Babies & Ecological Collapse\n\nThe release of Rubber Soul left Brian Wilson thunderstruck. The unexpected sitar on \"Norwegian Wood,\" the increasingly mature, personal songwriting, all of it was so fresh that \"I flipped!\" and immediately wanted to record \"a thematic album, a collection of folk songs.\"\n\nBrian found life on the road soul-crushing and terrifying, and was much more content to stay home composing, writing, and producing. With the touring band out on the road, and with a creative fire lit under him by both the Beatles and Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound, he had time to develop into a wildly creative, exacting, and celebrated producer, an experience that yielded the 1966 masterpiece, Pet Sounds.\n\nPet Sounds Took 44 Years To Go Platinum\n\nYou read that right: Pet Sounds was a flop in the U.S. upon its release. Even after hearing radio-ready tracks like \"Wouldn’t It Be Nice?\" and \"Sloop John B\" and the ravishing \"God Only Knows,\" Capitol Records thought the album had minimal commercial potential and didn’t give it the promotional push the band were expecting. Fans in the United Kingdom embraced it, however, and the votes of confidence from British fans — including Keith Moon, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney — buoyed both sales and the Beach Boys’ spirits.\n\nIn fact, Lennon and McCartney credited Pet Sounds with giving them a target to hit when they went into the studio to record the Beatles’ own next sonically groundbreaking album, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. As veteran producer and documentary talking head Don Was puts it, Brian Wilson was a true pioneer, incorporating \"textures nobody had ever put into pop music before.\" The friendly rivalry continued as the Beatles realized that they needed to step up their game once more.\n\nRead more: Masterful Remixer Giles Martin On The Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds,' The Beatles, Paul McCartney\n\nMeanwhile, Capitol Records released and vigorously promoted a best-of album full of the Beach Boys’ early hits, Best Of The Beach Boys. The collection of sun-drenched, peppy tunes was a hit, but was also very out of step with the cultural and political shifts bubbling up through the anti-war and civil rights movements of the era. Thanks in part to later critical re-appraisals and being publicly embraced by musicians as varied as Questlove and Stereolab, Pet Sounds eventually reached platinum status in April 2000, 44 years after its initial release.\n\nDennis Wilson Was The Only Truly Beachy Beach Boy\n\nAlthough the Beach Boys first made a name for themselves as purveyors of \"the California sound\" by singing almost exclusively about beaches, girls, and surfing, the only member of the band who really liked the beach was drummer Dennis Wilson.\n\nAl Jardine ruefully recalls that \"the first thing I did was lose my board — I nearly drowned\" on a gorgeous day at Manhattan beach. Dennis was an actual surfer whose tanned, blonde good looks and slightly rebellious edge made him the instant sex symbol of the group. In 1967, when Brian’s depression was the deepest and he relinquished in-studio control of the band, Dennis flourished musically and lyrically. Carl Wilson, who had emerged as a very capable producer in Brian’s absence, described Dennis as evolving artistically \"really quite amazingly…it just blew us away.\"\n\nDennis was also the only Beach Boy who participated meaningfully in the counterculture of the late 1960s, a movement the band largely sat out of, largely to the detriment of their image. He introduced the band to Transcendental Meditation — a practice Mike Love maintains to this day — and was a figure in the Sunset Strip and Laurel Canyon music scenes. Unfortunately, he also became acquainted with and introduced his bandmates to Charles Manson. Manson’s true goal was rock stardom; masterminding the gruesome mass murders that his followers perpetrated in 1969 was a vengeful outgrowth of his thwarted ambition.\n\nThe Beach Boys did record and release a reworked version of one of Manson’s songs, \"Never Learn Not To Love\" as a B-side in 1968. Love says that having introduced Manson to producer Terry Melcher, who firmly rebuffed the would-be musician, \"weighed on Dennis pretty heavily,\" and while Jardine emphatically and truthfully says \"it wasn’t his fault,\" it’s easy to imagine those events driving some of the self-destructive alcohol and drug abuse that marked Dennis’ later years.\n\nThe Journey From Obscurity To Perennially Popular Heritage Act\n\nThe final minutes of The Beach Boys can be summed up as \"if all else fails commercially, release a double album of beloved greatest hits.\" The 1970s were a very fruitful time for the band creatively, as they invited funk specialists Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar to join the band and relocated to the Netherlands to pursue a harder, more far-out sound. Although the band were proud of the lush, singer/songwriter material they were recording, the albums of this era were sales disappointments and represented a continuing slide into uncoolness and obscurity.\n\nRead more: Brian Wilson Is A Once-In-A-Lifetime Creative Genius. But The Beach Boys Are More Than Just Him.\n\nOnce again, Capitol Records turned to the band’s early material to boost sales. The 1974 double-album compilation Endless Summer, comprised of hits from 1962-1965, went triple platinum, relaunching The Beach Boys as a successful heritage touring act. A new generation of fans — \"8 to 80,\" as the band put it — flocked to their bright harmonies and upbeat tempos, as seen in the final moments of the documentary when the Beach Boys played to a crowd of over 500,000 fans on July 4, 1980.\n\nWhile taking their place as America’s Band didn’t do much to make them cool, it did ensure one more wave of chart success with 1988’s No. 1 hit \"Kokomo\" and ultimately led to broader appreciation for Pet Sounds and its sibling experimental albums like Smiley Smile. That wave of popularity has proven remarkably durable; after all, they’ve ridden it to a documentary for Disney+ nearly 45 years later.\n\nListen: 50 Essential Songs By The Beach Boys Ahead Of \"A GRAMMY Salute\" To America's Band\n\n\"Looking back from history's vantage point, it seems like everybody drank the bad batch of Kool-Aid,\" he tells GRAMMY.com. Lindsay-Hogg had just appeared at an NYC screening, and seemed as surprised by it as the fans: \"Because the opinion that was first formed about the movie, you could not form on the actual movie we saw the other night.\"\n\nHe's correct. If you saw Get Back, Lindsay-Hogg is the babyfaced, cigar-puffing auteur seen throughout; today, at 84, his original vision has been reclaimed. On May 8, Disney+ unveiled a restored and refreshed version of the Let it Be film — a historical counterweight to Get Back. Temperamentally, though, it's right on the same wavelength, which is bound to surprise some Fabs disciples.\n\nWith the benefit of Peter Jackson's sound-polishing magic and Giles Martin's inspired remixes of performances, Let it Be offers a quieter, more muted, more atmospheric take on these sessions. (Think fewer goofy antics, and more tight, lingering shots of four of rock's most evocative faces.)\n\nAs you absorb the long-on-ice Let it Be, here are some lesser-known facts about this film, and the era of the Beatles it captures — with a little help from Lindsay-Hogg himself.\n\nThe Beatles Were Happy With The Let It Be Film\n\nAfter Lindsay-Hogg showed the Beatles the final rough cut, he says they all went out to a jovial meal and drinks: \"Nice food, collegial, pleasant, witty conversation, nice wine.\"\n\nAfterward, they went downstairs to a discotheque for nightcaps. \"Paul said he thought Let it Be was good. We'd all done a good job,\" Lindsay-Hogg remembers. \"And Ringo and [wife] Maureen were jiving to the music until two in the morning.\"\n\n\"They had a really, really good time,\" he adds. \"And you can see like [in the film], on their faces, their interactions — it was like it always was.\"\n\nAbout \"That\" Fight: Neither Paul Nor George Made A Big Deal\n\nAt this point, Beatles fanatics can recite this Harrison-in-a-snit quote to McCartney: \"I'll play, you know, whatever you want me to play, or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play. Whatever it is that will please you… I'll do it.\" (Yes, that's widely viewed among fans as a tremendous deal.)\n\nIf this was such a fissure, why did McCartney and Harrison allow it in the film? After all, they had say in the final cut, like the other Beatles.\n\n\"Nothing was going to be in the picture that they didn't want,\" Lindsay-Hogg asserts. \"They never commented on that. They took that exchange as like many other exchanges they'd had over the years… but, of course, since they'd broken up a month before [the film's release], everyone was looking for little bits of sharp metal on the sand to think why they'd broken up.\"\n\nRecently, Ringo Starr opined that there was \"not a lot of joy\" in the Let it Be film; Lindsay-Hogg says Starr framed it to him as \"no joy.\"\n\nOf course, that's Starr's prerogative. But it's not quite borne out by what we see — especially that merry scene where he and Harrison work out an early draft of Abbey Road's \"Octopus's Garden.\"\n\n\"And Ringo's a combination of so pleased to be working on the song, pleased to be working with his friend, glad for the input,\" Lindsay-Hogg says. \"He's a wonderful guy. I mean, he can think what he wants and I will always have greater affection for him.\n\n\"Let's see if he changes his mind by the time he's 100,\" he added mirthfully.\n\nLindsay-Hogg Thought It'd Never Be Released Again\n\n\"I went through many years of thinking, It's not going to come out,\" Lindsay-Hogg says. In this regard, he characterizes 25 or 30 years of his life as \"solitary confinement,\" although he was \"pushing for it, and educating for it.\"\n\n\"Then, suddenly, the sun comes out\" — which may be thanks to Peter Jackson, and renewed interest via Get Back. \"And someone opens the cell door, and Let it Be walks out.\"\n\nNobody Asked Him What The Sessions Were Like\n\nAll four Beatles, and many of their associates, have spoken their piece on Let it Be sessions — and journalists, authors, documentarians, and fans all have their own slant on them.\n\nBut what was this time like from Lindsay-Hogg's perspective? Incredibly, nobody ever thought to check. \"You asked the one question which no one has asked,\" he says. \"No one.\"\n\nSo, give us the vibe check. Were the Let it Be sessions ever remotely as tense as they've been described, since man landed on the moon? And to that, Lindsay-Hogg's response is a chuckle, and a resounding, \"No, no, no.\"\n\nThe Beatles' Final Song: Giles Martin On The Second Life Of \"Now And Then\" & How The Fab Four Are \"Still Breaking New Ground\""
