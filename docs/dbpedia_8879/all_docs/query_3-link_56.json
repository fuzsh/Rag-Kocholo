We were talking - about the love we all could share - when we find it To try our best to hold it there - with our love With our love - we could save the world - if they only knew. Try to realise it's all within yourself no-one else can make you change And to see you're really only very small, and life flows on within you and without you. We were talking - about the love that's gone so cold and the people, Who gain the world and lose their soul - they don't know - they can't see - are you one of them? When you've seen beyond yourself - then you may find, peace of mind is waiting there - And the time will come when you see we're all one, and life flows on within you and without you.

So in 1955, spurred by the local interest in country and western music, Phillips spent 400 pound on a portable tape recorder and portable disc cutting machine, microphones and a four-way mixer, which were installed in the middle living-room of his Victorian terraced house at number 38 Kensington, a major thoroughfare located a mile beyond Liverpool centre.\n\nSparse it may have been but Phillips' recording facility was efficient. Having arrived for their appointment customers would sit in a waiting area and, when prompted, move into the living-room, face up to the microphones and perform, live. While trams rattled along Kensington - their noise was deadened by a heavy curtain over the studio door - Percy Phillips would first commit the performance to tape and then, provided that the Artiste was not distressed with the result, immediately transfer this to a sshellac disc, wiping over the tape next time someone used the studio.\n\nWord of Phillips' facility soon spread, and as skiffle and then beat music took hold so it began to attract a number of Liverpool's younger musicians, eager to commit their sound to disc and be able to announce that they had \"made a record\". Having travelled with their instruments from the south end of the city, a quintet called the Quarry Men - John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, who all played guitars, John Lowe who played the piano, and Collin Hanton the drummer - turned up at Phillips Sound Recording Service one day in the spring or summer of 1958. A short while later, having parted company with 17s 6d [88p], the five Quarry Men left 38 Kensington passing among them the cherished fruit of their debut recording session: a very-breakable 78rpm record, ten-inches in diameter. The disc's labels clearly instructed \"Play with a light-weight pick-up\" ... but bore no mention of the words Quarry Men, and certainly not Beatles, a name they wouldn't adopt for another two years.\n\nOn one side of the disc was That'll Be The Day, homage to Buddy Holly and the Crickets, featuring John Lennon's lead vocal with Paul McCartney providing the high harmonies. On the other side was In Spite Of All The Danger, co-written by Paul McCartney and George Harrison, but, again, with John Lennon singing lead.\n\nColin Hanton (whose membership of the Quarry Men pre-dated both Paul's and George's) and John Lowe (who was recruited principally because he could play Jerry Lee Lewis's exacting arpeggio part in Mean Woman Blues) left soo after the band's one and only recording session, leaving the nucleus, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, to aim for fame.\n\n* MONO tracks\n\nSong: Cry For A Shadow Duration: 2.22 Track No.: 1-12 Composer: Harrison/Lennon Vocals: - Instrumental - Year: 1961Lyrics:\n\n- Instrumental - Instruments & additional info.:\n\n10 My Bonnie\n\n(Traditional, arranged by Tony Sheridan)\n\n11 Ain't She Sweet\n\n(Milton Ager [music], Jack Yellen [lyric])\n\n12 Cry For A Shadow\n\n(George Harrison, John Lennon)\n\nRecorded Friedrich-Ebert-Halle, Hamburg, 22 June 1961\n\nProducer Bert Kaempfert\n\nEngineer Karl Hinze\n\nDuring the Beatles' second visit to Hamburg, April to July 1961, the group regularly backed an English singer/guitarist, Tony Sheridan, who had gone to play there in the early summer of 1960 and befriended the Beatles' when they first arrived in the city shortly afterwards. On a visit to the Top Ten Club, a music publishing executive was impressed by the Sheridan/Beatles stage combination and so talked to a friend, the orchestra leader and composer Bert Kaempfert, suggesting that Kaempfert consider producing some recording sessions.\n\nOne morning, probably 22 June, not long after the Beatles had finished another seven-hour slog in the Top Ten, taxis arrived to take them to the place of recording - not a real studio but Friedrich-Ebert-Halle, a school, where the session took place on stage. The Beatles backed Sheridan on five or six numbers - the main one being a rock rendition of the lullaby My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean - and then had two more themselves: Ain't She Sweet and Cry For A Shadow. In August 1961, after the Beatles had returned to Liverpool, Polydor issued My Bonnie as a single, credited to Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers, the disc eventually climbing high on a local German chart. Only on the British release (elsewhere, it was only after the group became famous) was the label credit altered to Tony Sheridan and the Beatles.\n\nBut My Bonnie was more than just the Beatles' first appearance on commercial disc: it also brought them to the attention of Brian Epstein...\n\nTony Sheridan rocked-up the arrangement they called My Bonnie, delivered the spoken-word introduction, sang and played lead guitar. George Harrison played the opening lead guitar passage, Paul McCartney is clearly evident, not only for his bass but also for his background shouts, and John Lennon and drummer Pete Best - who had joined the group's line-up in August 1960 - also played.\n\nAin't She Sweet did not feature Sheridan, John Lennon singing the lead vocal. A staple of their 1961 stage act, the Beatles usually performed this in the more mellow style of Gene Vincent and his Blue Caps' influential 1956 version. However, when it came to Hamburg audiences, and this recording, the Beatles delivered the song in what John Lennon later described as \"a harder version ... more like a march\".\n\nCry For A Shadow is a rare instrumental performance by the Beatles; the composer credit, Harrison-Lennon, was the only such occurrence on disc.\n\nSong: Three Cool Cats Duration: 2.24 Track No.: 1-16 Composer: Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller Vocals: George Harrison Year: 1962Lyrics:\n\nThree cool cats Three cool cats Three cool cats Huntin on the corner in a beat up car Splittin up a lifted candy bar Talkin all about how sharp they are Are three cool cats Three cool chicks Walkin down the street Swingin their hips Splittin up a bag of potato chips And three cool cats turned three big flips For three cool chicks Well, up popped that first cool cat He said, \"My look at that, Man, do you see what I see?

The session took place on New Year's Day 1962, at the company's studio at 165 Broadhurst Gardens in the West Hampstead district of north London. Recorded live, directly on to a mono tape, without the opportunity to overdub or remix, the session was overseen by Decca A&R [artistes & repertoire] assistant Mike Smith.\n\nObtaining for the Beatles a contract with a British recording company was the number one priority that Brian Epstein assigned himself in his role as the new manager of the group. Moreover, in an attempt to underline the Beatles' musical versatility, he personally selected the 15 songs cut at the Decca audition, all of which, to a greater or lesser extent, could be heard if one followed the group's frequent performances around the Meryside dance halls and rock clubs. Searchin' and Three Cool Cats were certainly major Beatles stage favourites at this time, and both were from the same matrix: comedy numbers written by Leiber-Stoller and first recorded by the American R&B outfit the Coasters, in 1957 and 1958 respectively. For Searchin', Paul supplied the lead vocal, John and George the backing vocal; Three Cool Cats featured George.\n\nThe Sheik Of Araby was another big favourite, again with George Harrison delivering the lead vocal. The song was first performed in the stage musical Make It Snappy and the 1940 Hollywood movie Tin Pan Alley, but the Beatles were inspired by a cheeky, chirpy rock and roll version by Joe Brown, consequently their Decca performance had humor to the fore, right from the beat-style Arabic mood-setting kick-off through to the humorous John-Paul \"not arf\"s.\n\nBy the start of 1962, Lennon and McCartney had been composing music, together or alone, for some five years, often claiming in early interviews to have written \"100 original songs\" before noticed. The Beatles recorded very few of these numbers once successful. Like Dreamers Do and Hello Little Girl, to name but two, are early Lennon-McCartney numbers which the Beatles never recorded once signed to EMI, although they were obviously considered strong enough to present to Decca in the New Year's Day audition, not least to prove the boast, rare for the period, that the group could pen their own material. Hello Little Girl was actually the first song ever written by John Lennon, Like Dreamers Do showed Paul McCartney in hopeful mood, \"waiting for the bliss\".\n\nBoth songs did eventually see commercial release. The Fourmost, another Liverpool group managed by Brian Epstein, were given Hello Little Girl in 1963; Like Dreamers Do was recorded by Birmingham band the Applejacks in 1964.\n\n* MONO tracks\n\nSong: You Know What To Do Duration: 1.57 Track No.: 2-19 Composer: Harrison Vocals: George Harrison Year: 1964Lyrics:\n\nWhen I see you I just don't know what to say I'd like to be with you ev'ry hour of the day So if you want me just like I need you You know what to do I watch you walking by and you looked alone I hope that you won't mind if I walk you back home But if you want me just like I need you You know what to do Just call on me when you're lonely I'll keep my love for you only I'll call on you if I'm lonely too Understand that I'll stay with you every day Make you love me more in every way So if you want me just like I want you You know what to do Just call on me when you're lonely I'll keep my love for you only I'll call on you if I'm lonely too Understand that I'll stay with you every day Make you love me more in every way So if you want me just like I need you You know what to do [**] Instruments & additional info.:\n\n19 You Know What To Do\n\n(George Harrison)\n\n20 No Reply (demo)\n\n(John Lennon, Paul McCartney)\n\nRecorded EMI Studios, London, 3 June 1964\n\nProducer George Martin\n\nEngineer Norman Smith\n\nTwo demo recordings taped by the Beatles at EMI the day before they flew to Denmark to begin an inter-continental concert tour.\n\nThe drummer on the first few dates of that tour was a substitute, Jimmy Nicol, drafted in at the eleventh hour after Ringo had been taken ill morning of 3 June. The EMI recording session booked for the remainder of the day was thrown into disarray by Ringo's indisposition; instead of taping the fourteenth and final song for the album A Hard Day's Night, John, Paul and George spent an hour listening to playbacks and running Nicol through some of the songs in their stage repertoire. Then, after the drummer had gone to pack his suitcase, they remained at Abbey Road and, during a four-hour evening session in Studio Two, loosely recorded three songs, two of which are presented here. The tape of the session was misfiled and´ re-discovered in 1993.\n\nIncorporating vocal, guitar, bass and tambourine tracks, this is believed to be the only existing recording of George Harrison's second song composition You Know What To Do. (The first was Don't Bother Me, issued on With The Beatles in 1963.) George did not contribute any songs to the albums A Hard Day's Night and Beatles For Sale and then added two to the next, Help!, but You Know What To Do never re-surfaced and has remained unissued until now.\n\nWith greater application extended during a session on 30 September 1964, John Lennon's No Reply was issued, on the album Beatles For Sale, but this 3 June demo recording of the song certainly has not been heard before. It was announced at the time that John was giving No Reply to Tommy Quickly, another Brian Epstein's artists, and - as John sings it in a staccato, jaunty style more typical of Quickly's than his own - it's feasible that this demo was recorded with that donation in mind. (All the same, if he recorded it at all, Quickly never issued his version.) Intriguingly, a drummer is evident, even though no recognised player - neither Ringo nor Jimmy Nicol - was present.\n\nSong: Taxman Duration: 2.31 Track No.: 1-20 Composer: Harrison Vocals: George Harrison Year: 1966Lyrics:\n\nInstruments & additional info.:\n\n20 Taxman\n\n(George Harrison)\n\nRecorded EMI Studios, London, 21 April 1966\n\nProducer George Martin\n\nEngineer Geoff Emerick\n\nThe opening title on Revolver, Taxman was George Harrison's acerbic and witty view of the inescapable realities of life. Take 12 was the master recording, this being a \"reduction\", or \"bounce\", of take 11. (These are terms for a recording process, taken up by the Beatles around this time, where, by merging two or more existing tracks of a tape while copying it across to a second tape, vacant tracks are created, allowing for further overdubbing. Abbey Road was still using four-track recording machines in 1966, so this process was often necessary.) Issued here for the first time is that Take 11, not dissimilar to the master but with some notable differences, principally in the clean, full ending (instead of the repeated guitar solo) and the \"anybody got a bit of money?\" backing vocals (instead of \"Mister Wilson, Mister Heath\" reference).\n\nOther versions on Revolver The Best of George Harrison Live In Japan Song: Only A Northern Song Duration: 2.43 Track No.: 2-7 Composer: Harrison Vocals: George Harrison Year: 1967Lyrics:\n\nIf you're listening to this song You may think the chords are going wrong But they're not I just wrote it like that When you listen late at night You may feel the words are not quite right But they are I just wrote them myself And it doesn't really matter what chords I play What words I say Or time of day it is As it's only a Northern Song It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear Or how I fare Or if my hair is brown When it's only a Northern Song If you think the harmony Is a little off and out of key Then you're right 'Cause I sing it myself [*] Instruments & additional info.:\n\n7 Only A Northern Song\n\n(George Harrison)\n\nRecorded EMI Studios, London, 13, 14 February and 20 April 1967\n\nProducer George Martin\n\nEngineer Geoff Emerick\n\nAlthough not issued on disc until the Yellow Submarine soundtrack album, in January 1969, George's Only A Northern Song was written and first intended for Sgt Pepper, its place in the recording chronology coming between other Pepper tracks Fixing A Hole, composed by Paul, and Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite!, by John.\n\nThe master of Only A Northern Song combined Take 3 (with overdubs) and a \"reduction\" of this, Take 11 (which further overdubs), synchronously mixed into mono. The mix presented here, in stereo and slightly speeded up, is Take 3 - the basic track from 13 February, with bass and guitar added on 20 April - with unused vocal tracks (yielding a number of lyric variations from the master) overdubbed on to a seperate \"reductions\", Take 12, flown in.\n\nOther versions on Yellow Submarine Song: Within You Without You (Instrumental) Duration: 5.27 Track No.: 2-11 Composer: Harrison Vocals: - Instrumental - Year: 1967Lyrics:\n\n- Instrumental - Instruments & additional info.:\n\n11 Within You Without You (instrumental)\n\n(George Harrison)\n\nRecorded EMI Studios, London, 15, 16 and 22 March and 3 April 1967\n\nProducer George Martin\n\nEngineer Geoff Emerick\n\nThis is the master of the George Harrison composition that opened side two of Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, presented here in a fashion not previously available: remixed, without George's vocal, from the different original four-track taped that formed that master.\n\nWhat remains, audible to the fore, is a combination of tamboura, tabla, dilruba and swaramandal tracks recorded in March, with violins, cellos and George's sitar track overdubbed on 3 April.\n\nOther versions on Sgt.

In their styes with all their backing They don't care what goes on around In their eyes there's something lacking What they need's a damn good whacking.

The first two selections, Mean Mr Mustard and Polythene Pam, written by John, were not taped at EMI until 1969, appearing on the Beatles' final recorded album Abbey Road. Both surface here, as does the White Album track Glass Onion, in early, unfinished form, John double-tracking his performance and venturing into vocal gobbleygook in the places where he had yet to finalise the lyrics. Like these three, Junk was composed when the Beatles were in India in Spring 1968, but the group never taped a formal studio version and the song remained unissued until April 1970, when it appeared on Paul's first post-Beatles album McCartney, re-recorded in much the same acoustic style as at Esher. Piggies was composed and performed by George, double-tracking his vocal, as was Paul's Honey Pie, both going on to the White Album with slightly revised lyrics.\n\nOther versions on The Beatles Live In Japan Song: While My Guitar Gently Weeps Duration: 3.27 Track No.: 1-16 Composer: Harrison Vocals: George Harrison Year: 1968Lyrics:\n\nI look at you all see the love there that's sleeping While my guitar gently weeps I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping Still my guitar gently weeps I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love I don't know how someone controlled you They bought and sold you. I look at the world and I notice it's turning While my guitar gently weeps With every mistake we must surely be learning Still my guitar gently weeps I don't know how you were diverted You were perverted too I don't know how you were inverted No one alerted you.

The song would undergo two re-makes between this date and 6 September, when the master was completed, and become siginificantly heavier in the process - the final version featuring a lead guitar track played by guest Eric Clapton. This first studio recording could scarcely be more different, George singing live to his own acoustic guitar accompaniment (augmented by an organ part played by Paul), and incorporating an additional verse omitted from later versions.\n\nOther versions on The Beatles The Concert for Bangla Desh The Best of George Harrison Live In Japan Song: Not Guilty Duration: 3.22 Track No.: 1-18 Composer: Harrison Vocals: George Harrison Year: 1968Lyrics:\n\nNot guilty Of getting in your way While you're trying to steal the day Not guilty And I'm not here for the rest I'm not trying to steal your vest.

Curiously, though, once he had done so, and the recording was completed, it was decided to leave it off the White Album, the song remained unheard until 1979, when George recorded an acoustic re-make for his album George Harrison. But this Beatles version (Take 102), heavier in approach, has not been issued until now.\n\nOther versions on George Harrison Song: For You Blue Duration: 2.22 Track No.: 2-5 Composer: Harrison Vocals: George Harrison Year: 1969Lyrics:\n\nBecause you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I do I love you more than ever, girl, it's true I want you in the morning, girl, I love you I want you at the moment I feel blue I'm living every moment, girl, for you I loved you from the moment that I saw you You looked at me that's all you had to do I feel it now, I hope you feel it too Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true I love you more each moment I'm with you [*] Instruments & additional info.:\n\n5 For You Blue\n\n(George Harrison)\n\nRecorded Apple Studios, London, 25 January 1969\n\nProducer George Martin\n\nEngineer Glyn Johns\n\nA good band performance - acoustic guitar (George), slide guitar (John), piano (Paul) and drums (Ringo) - of George Harrison's happy twelve-bar blues.

It was then another year and a half before George taped the definitive studio recording, the song going on to grace - and give the title to - his first post-Beatles work, a triple-album issued at the end of 1970.\n\nThis charming demo - guitar and vocal, with a second guitar passage overdubbed - is one of three that the artist recorded on the occasion of his 26th birthday.

Group recording of Old Brown Shoe took place over two sessions in April 1969 and the song was issued a month later as the B-side of the Beatles' twentieth single, The Ballad Of John And Yoko.\n\nOther versions on Pastr Masters Vol. 2 Live In Japan Song: Something Duration: 3.18 Track No.: 2-16 Composer: Harrison Vocals: George Harrison Year: 1969Lyrics:\n\nSomething in the way she moves Attracts me like no other lover Something in the way she woos me I don't want to leave her now You know I believe in how Something in her smile she knows That I don't need no other lover Something in her style that shows me I don't want to leave her now You know I believe in how You're asking me will my love grow I don't know, I don't know Stick around and it may show But I don't know, I don't know No I love that woman ' mine And I need her all of the time No I'm telling you That woman that woman don't make me blue [*] Instruments & additional info.:\n\n16 Something*\n\n(George Harrison)\n\nRecorded EMI Studios, London, 25 February 1969\n\nEngineer Ken Scott\n\nThe final solo demo recorded by George Harrison on his 26th birthday resulted in the first commitment to tape of the beautiful Something, destined for the album Abbey Road (recording spanned April to August 1969), George's first A-side composition for the Beatles when it was issued as a single that October, and hundreds of cover versions. The demo is simplicity itself: a live-in-one-take electric guitar/vocal performance that, in addition to the definitive lyric, also embraced a couter-melody verse later dropped. Shortly after taping this demo George participated in a session during which Joe Cocker became the first artist - ahead of the Beatles, even - to record this major new composition; his version did not come out until November 1969, however, by which time Abbey Road and the Something single had been issued.\n\n* MONO track\n\nOther versions on Abbey Road The Concert for Bangla Desh The Best of George Harrison Live In Japan Song: I Me Mine Duration: 1.47 Track No.: 2-22 Composer: Harrison Vocals: George Harrison Year: 1970Lyrics:\n\nAll through the day I me mine, I me mine, I me mine All through the night I me mine, I me mine, I me mine Now they're frightened of leaving it Ev'ryone's reading it Coming on strong all the time All through the day I me mine I me me mine, I me me mine, I me me mine, I me me mine All I can hear I me mine, I me mine, I me mine Even those tears I me mine, I me mine, I me mine No one's frightened of playing it Everyone's saying it Flowing more freely than wine All through your life I me mine [*] Instruments & additional info.:\n\n22 I Me Mine\n\n(George Harrison)\n\nRecorded EMI Studios, London, 3 January 1970\n\nProducer George Martin\n\nEngineer Phil McDonald\n\nA quick run-through of George Harrison's I Me Mine (shot in early January 1969 during the Twickenham rehearsal period of the Get Back project) was set for inclusion in the Let It Be film, indicating that it also should feature on the accompanying album. But as the song had never been committed to tape with any serious endeavour the Beatles convened again in number two studio at EMI - some five months after completing final album Abbey Road - and recorded their last new piece together. (The word \"new\" is an important qualifier, for work polishing up previously recorded material for Let It Be continued through to April.) But not all of the Beatles participated: John Lennon was on holiday, his absence prompting a telling remark - like a mock press statement - from George during the session, which precedes this Anthology recording.\n\nAs George, Paul and Ringo recorded it, I Me Mine was short, running to just 1.34. For the Let It Be album, Phil Spector - brought in by George and John in March 1970 to \"re-produce\" the tapes - extended the length to 2.25 by means of editing, and also supervised the overdubbing of orchestral tracks. Although the same master (Take 16) has been used for the Anthology, the song appears here at its true length and as the three Beatles recorded it during what turned out to be their last session together for 24 years.\n\nOther versions on Let It Be\n\nGeorge Harrison - Lyrics Pages -- 1996/97\n\nLast Changed: 02/16/1998"
