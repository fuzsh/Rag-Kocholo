        "text": "Tag: george harrison\n\nnow and then üò≠\n\nBy now, I would hope that anyone who reads this thing has heard the new Beatles song. Regardless of your opinion on the Beatles or the song itself, it‚Äôs a phenomenon of pop culture and technology! We‚Äôre living an incredible moment in music history!!\n\nOk, that said, I will now do the thing where I just throw a bunch of tweet (X?) sized observations in a list, because I‚Äôm still trying to process it all and can‚Äôt write a coherent post, yet. So here are my takes on the song, the music video, and the mini-documentary, interspersed with screenshots I took this morning in a frenzy:\n\nThe mini-doc, which was released first, is still my favorite piece of media from this whole thing. So much restored and unseen Anthology footage! So much George in flannel! And lovely videos from John‚Äôs New York era.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs computer stuff‚Äù reminds me of George‚Äôs Yahoo Q&A from 2001, such a treasure.\n\nHow is it that Ringo looks like he has de-aged in the last 30 years?\n\nMy only gripe is how scripted Paul sounds. Pol, just speak from your heart!!\n\nI‚Äôm still blown away by the technology (I just keep calling it the Peter Jackson AI, for lack of a better term) that lets us extract John‚Äôs voice, crystal clear, from a grainy half-century-old tape. It really feels magical.\n\nPETER JACKSON IS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO BEATLEFANS IN THIS MILLENNIUM.\n\nOn paper, the lyrics are nothing to write home about. It almost seems like an early Beatles song in its simplicity, but with the weight and sentiment of someone who‚Äôs lived through a lot since then.\n\nAdd to that the lore that ‚Äúnow and then‚Äù was part of John and Paul‚Äôs last conversation and suddenly the whole thing is rather heartbreaking.\n\nTHIS MUCH strings?? I‚Äôll allow it, because it‚Äôs very Beatle-y, and very George Martin-y.\n\nIt‚Äôs already been said a lot on the internet, but 82-year-old Paul singing with 38-year-old John is a real gut-punch.\n\nLike, I‚Äôm sure Paul knows how much his voice has aged, but I love the thought that adding harmony to John comes so naturally to him, and that he didn‚Äôt think twice about adding his vocals because that‚Äôs just the Lennon-McCartney way.\n\nHearing the difference in their voices was jarring at first, but kind of beautiful now.\n\nThe instrumental break wrecked me immediately. I wish it could‚Äôve been a George solo, but Paul doing slide guitar in honor of George is the next best thing, and the harmonies sound so good, I LOSE IT EVERY TIME.\n\nI think the melancholy vibe is a nice complement to the ‚Äúother‚Äù two late Beatles songs, Free As A Bird and Real Love. Together they are a nice trilogy.\n\nFirst impression of the music video: a little sappy, a little corny, WHOA the AI did some weird things to Young George‚Ä¶\n\nSecond impression of the video: ok actually this is a technological and creative feat, they are looking at each other across decades, why am I crying all of a sudden??\n\nAll subsequent viewings of the video: this is a miracle, we don‚Äôt deserve this, bless these four men forever and ever\n\nAlso, I CANNOT believe they put the clip of George undressing from the Hello Goodbye outtake in this video.\n\nUsing so much Hello Goodbye footage feels cheesy, but I get it‚Äîit‚Äôs a romp and also conveniently in the same tempo.\n\nI‚Äôm still in awe of how well the AI inserted 2023 Paul & Ringo into the HG video. Inserting John and George in 2023 felt a little cringe, though.\n\nI‚Äôm sure in 30 years all this nascent AI stuff will seem so primitive, but how exciting to be here while it‚Äôs still being used for wholesome things like Beatles music videos.\n\n(Is Peter Jackson the 5th Beatle?)\n\nIf you are not crying by this point in the video, SEE YA.\n\nThey‚Äôve really marketed themselves into a hole calling this THE LAST BEATLES SONG, but I‚Äôm hopeful we might still get remixes of Free As A Bird and Real Love (would be awesome to see what Peter Jackson‚Äôs AI can do with those songs) and while we‚Äôre at it, maybe a 30 year Anthology re-release?!\n\nSo many members of the extended Beatles family came together (SWIDT?) to make this happen. THANK YOU Yoko, Olivia, Sean, Giles, Peter Jackson, Pete Best even!, Paul, and Ringo. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nHBD, ATMP!\n\nOk, so November 27th is the *actual* birthday of All Things Must Pass, but the 50th anniversary reissue just came out this past week, so like most Beatlefans, I‚Äôm celebrating now. It‚Äôs taken me til the weekend to truly listen to most of the album + extras and man, it‚Äôs a lot to unpack. (Can we also address the Uber Deluxe Edition, which includes‚Äîin addition to 8 LPs, 5 CDs, 4 gnomes, 3 books, Rudraksha beads, and a Klaus Voormann illustration‚Äîa wooden bookmark made from a felled oak tree in George‚Äôs Friar Park garden?? It‚Äôs almost enough to distract me from the $1,000 price tag.)\n\nI have yet to listen to the whole thing in one sitting, but some initial favorites:\n\n‚ÄúBehind That Locked Door‚Äù ‚Äì This has always been one of my top songs on the album. I‚Äôm a sucker for pedal steel guitar, and combined with Billy Preston on the Hammond and Klaus Voorman on bass? *chef‚Äôs kiss* A real treat. I usually feel like I don‚Äôt have the ear to comment on production, but the 2020 mix really gives those vocals life, wow!\n\n‚ÄúOm Hare Om (Gopala Krishna)‚Äù ‚Äì This feels like one of those songs Phil Spector told George couldn‚Äôt be on the album because it‚Äôs a little too devotional‚Äîor maybe because it doesn‚Äôt lend itself as much to the ol‚Äô Wall of Sound. I love it, though. George‚Äôs vocal line in the verse would make a lovely lehra (the melodic line accompanying a tabla solo), which could very well have been his intention. Can‚Äôt get this one out of my head.\n\n‚ÄúRun of the Mill ‚Äì Day 2 Demo, Take 1‚Äù ‚Äì The album version is nice, but I think this acoustic demo version evokes a lot more feels, especially knowing that this song was a reflection of the Beatles‚Äô pre-breakup rift.\n\n‚ÄúArt of Dying ‚Äì Day 2 Demo, Take 1‚Äù ‚Äì Similarly, I love this stripped down version, sans Clapton‚Äôs in-your-face wailing. I just recently read this song dates back to 1966 (when Geo was a mere 23-year-old bebe). Can you imagine if this was on Revolver? It‚Äôs too good for the Beatles, honestly. üò¨ The version on Disc 5 is a jam too.\n\n‚ÄúWedding Bells (Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine)‚Äù ‚Äì DELIGHTFUL. More pedal steel please!!\n\n‚ÄúGet Back‚Äù ‚Äì It‚Äôs George singing Get Back accompanied by horns, what‚Äôs not to like!\n\nI‚Äôll leave you with the luscious ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt It A Pity‚Äù (Take 27) and its equally luscious video. Coincidentally (and unfathomably), George was 27 years old when ATMP was released. I always forget this fact, because he definitely gives off Wise Old Philosopher vibes throughout the album and in all the pictures from that era. But nope, he is the same age in those pictures as Justin Bieber is now. What is life?!\n\nThose good good Beatles harmonies\n\nLast week, after a particularly long bus ride in which I listened to ‚ÄúYes It Is‚Äù (a severely underrated song, IMO) no less than five times in a row, I was inspired to compile the perfect playlist of Beatles harmonies. Or at least, perfect to me.\n\nThis is by no means comprehensive‚Ä¶just a few of my favorites, arranged (mostly) chronologically because I always think it‚Äôs so interesting to hear how the Beatles‚Äô songwriting/recording techniques evolved over time. You can hear them getting more comfortable singing together with each song, until finally you get to ‚ÄúBecause‚Äù which 10 times out of 10 blows me away with those otherworldly vocals.\n\n(If you don‚Äôt have Spotify, I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs impossible to make a Beatles playlist on YouTube.)\n\nI had to include ‚ÄúThe End,‚Äù because 1) the other Abbey Road songs kinda leave you hanging, and 2) they do sneak some great harmonies in there.\n\nAlso, yesterday was George‚Äôs birthday! Happy birthday, dear George.\n\nThe Natch‚Äôl Blues\n\nInteresting/relevant thing of the day: ‚Äúnatch‚Äù as a slang word has been around since at least the 40s (apparently if I read more comics I would know this). All this time I‚Äôve been associating it with annoying modern abbreviations like ‚Äúobvi‚Äù and ‚Äúhilar‚Äù‚Ä¶I guess on some level that means there‚Äôs not much difference between awful internet slang and Harlem jive talk.\n\nAnyway, here‚Äôs a supremely cool record I bought this past week: Taj Mahal‚Äôs 1968 album The Natch‚Äôl Blues.\n\n(Actually, I got it for my dad‚Äôs birthday, but in between the purchase and the gift-exchange, I happened to get really attached to it. Oops.)\n\nIn fact, this album is so cool I decided to revive my short-lived ‚ÄòAlbum of the Week‚Äô tag, because I‚Äôve definitely been listening to it nonstop since Sunday.\n\nThe album cover is what first caught my eye, Taj‚Äôs moonish mask of a face staring back at me from the records section at Green Apple Books. It looks like it was meant to be framed (unlike the CD version, which scraps the border in favor of a darker cover, probably because the original layout didn‚Äôt look as good in a 5√ó5 inch plastic case). In any case, it‚Äôs super intriguing. As soon as I saw it, I immediately snatched it up‚Ä¶although I don‚Äôt think many people come to Green Apple with the intention of scouring the bottom-row blues music stack. Even if my dad already had this one, I would totally buy it for myself based on the album art alone.\n\nI came home and put it on the record player to make sure it played ok, and proceeded to melt into a puddle of sweet, sweet blues. If you only listen to one (ok, make that two) songs from this album, let them be ‚ÄúCorinna‚Äù and the closing number ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt That a Lot of Love.‚Äù While definitely rooted in blues, I love that the songs are infused with a healthy dose of soul and 60s pop, too. A lot of Taj Mahal‚Äôs stuff crosses over into various other genres (see Kulanjan), and this album is proof that he was doing it from the start.\n\nAnyway, after listening to the whole thing, I was secretly kind of hoping my dad already had the album so I could keep it. Turns out he didn‚Äôt (shucks), and actually he‚Äôd been looking for it for a long time! So now he has one of his faves, and I have another record to keep an eye out for.\n\nIn other news, Happy George Day! Here‚Äôs a collection of photos from when George had a perm, because why not??\n\nHere are some people I like\n\nSo many words lately‚Ä¶..so I‚Äôll just casually drop this picture here:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the Traveling Wilburys. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the only band in the world with five rhythm guitar players.‚Äù\n\nAlso, shout out to my favorite Tumblr and the source of this gem, harrisonstories.tumblr.com. It‚Äôs basically a compilation of lovely personal anecdotes/quotes about George Harrison, most of which give me the warm fuzzies‚Ä¶some of which make me cry and curse the world for taking George away from us. Some of my recent faves: George helping Ringo write Octopus‚Äôs Garden, talking about gardening with an unsuspecting gallery worker, and being a cool dad (part two). My favorite Beatle and Wilbury. <3\n\nGeorge Harrison Week is my favorite week\n\nA hearty salute to Conan for introducing George Harrison Week to the people (how wasn‚Äôt this a thing before?). It‚Äôs basically been a whole week of musical tributes to George, in celebration of the new Apple Years box set. I can‚Äôt believe that this is one of the few times I‚Äôve had access to cable and I didn‚Äôt watch any of these shows live. I‚Äôm awful. But‚Ä¶good thing for the Internet! Last night I enjoyed watching Dhani & Friends playing ‚ÄúLet It Down‚Äù (side note: a song originally produced by Phil Spector who is looking horrifying these days).\n\nAlso, Paul Simon performed a lovely version of ‚ÄúHere Comes the Sun‚Äú, although I‚Äôll always prefer the version he and George did together (how can you not love that 70s glow?). I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say these are my two FAVORITE musicians singing what could quite possibly be my favorite song of all time. Epic.\n\nAs for the newly released box set, I‚Äôll have to get back to you on that. One of the big selling points for the set was that George‚Äôs lesser-known albums after All Things Must Pass are finally being remastered and released, but lucky for me, I already have them on vinyl! So I might not be dropping $100 on the new box set anytime soon. But I am appreciative for the tracks I‚Äôve discovered/rediscovered in the process of listening through these albums again (in fact, here‚Äôs a Top 5):\n\nTop 5 George Harrison Tracks, 1968-1975:\n\n1. Instrumental take of ‚ÄúThe Inner Light‚Äù\n\n2. ‚ÄúMiss O‚ÄôDell‚Äù ‚Äì George‚Äôs LAUGH!\n\n3. ‚ÄúBe Here Now‚Äú\n\n4. ‚ÄúIf Not For You‚Äù ‚Äì sorry Bob, I like George‚Äôs version better :\\\n\n5. ‚ÄúWhat Is Life‚Äù ‚Äì one of the very first solo George songs I heard and fell in love with\n\nA rambling homage to George Harrison\n\nNot trying to be overly sappy or anything, but I can honestly say that George Harrison changed my life.\n\nIn 8th grade, I had been taking piano lessons for 6 years and played clarinet in middle school band, but music wasn‚Äôt really that big a part of my life. It was more of an extracurricular ‚Äúon the side‚Äù sort of thing, and I never devoted that much time to it. But then one day my mom brought home the movie A Hard Day‚Äôs Night‚Ä¶and that changed everything. I fell absolutely IN LOVE with the Beatles. The Beatles made me want to learn music: I sat on my bed every night learning various riffs and chords (on a guitar that was very generously gifted to me), saved up and bought CDs until I had the entire Beatles discography, and even more nerdy: bought records that I gleefully listened to out in the garage on my dad‚Äôs dusty turntable, finally understanding what it was like to love music.\n\nFrom the beginning, George was my favorite. He was definitely the one I could relate to most (shout out to quiet awkward people!), and his curiosity for new kinds of music and cultures is what got me so into ethnomusicology. It‚Äôs because of him that, 6 years later, I made the impulsive decision to walk into sitar class one morning at UCLA (instead of getting intimidated and turning around, which I almost did). And as a result I fell headfirst into Hindustani music, engulfed by that same sense of obsession that 8th Grade Nikki experienced with the Beatles, spending hours sitting with my teacher, trying to understand this whole new world of music. That‚Äôs how I got into tabla, that‚Äôs how I met Alex, and that‚Äôs how I ended up in Taiwan and India getting to perform with some of the most renowned musicians in modern Indian music. I feel incredibly lucky to have gone down the path I did, and it‚Äôs largely thanks to the influence of this guy:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThere are so many quirks that I love about George: his penchant for taking pictures, his obsession with ukuleles, the fact that he loved gardening. He was a pretty unconventional rockstar, and I love that about him.\n\nI‚Äôll round off my George ramble with, appropriately, some music. I only recently discovered this song, and I can‚Äôt stop listening to it:\n\nHappy 70th birthday, George. Thanks for being amazing.\n\n.\n\nBEATLES LOVE\n\nWatched the Living in the Material World documentary over the past two nights and just reaffirmed my love for the Beatles and George. I foresee a lot of Fab Four-related posts in the near future‚Ä¶..\n\nFor now, here are links to two of my new favorite tumblrs:\n\nAnd an awkward/awesome picture to sum it up:\n\nNot only is Paul holding a kangaroo in this photo, he is also wearing two watches. SO AWKWARD.\n\nHappy autumn!\n\n[Random note: Loving the new blogger look! Super chic and easy to use :)]\n\nAnyway. With the start of autumn, I thought I‚Äôd revive this blog a little (I‚Äôve missed you, blog!). And what better way to celebrate the new season than curled up on a big comfy chair with a new book? Here are the latest books on my to-read list:\n\nSunnyside. Glen David Gold.\n\nI have an obsession with 1920s Los Angeles (plus, Charlie Chaplin!). Just started this one ‚Äì so far it‚Äôs really interesting.\n\nJust Kids. Patti Smith.\n\nI love autobiographies/memoirs. I love music. I love books that take place in New York. Hence, this.\n\n.\n\nAnd last but not least, on my URGENT!!!!!MUST BUY/READ!!!!! list:\n\nby Olivia Harrison\n\nI looked through it at B&N today and pretty much squee‚Äôd through the entire thing.\n\nSo. many. beautiful. pictures.\n\nYou‚Äôll see the sun come shining through\n\nI feel like I‚Äôve mentioned this song so many times, but what can I say, I love it and so many of my favorite artists have covered it. I was (very) pleasantly surprised to find a version of the Chaplin song ‚ÄúSmile‚Äù performed by the Brazilian bloco afro Olodum, complete with tight beats and cheesy synth strings! Check it:\n\nI‚Äôve really been hyping the Brazilian stuff lately. It‚Äôs just so fun to play, and listen to. And I love when two of my favorite things are combined. :)\n\nA couple of other things:\n\n-One of the many upcoming things that I cannot wait for: a George Harrison documentary produced by Martin Scorsese? Win.\n\n-I just found out that Dennis Hopper has passed away. :( So long to one of the 60s‚Äô greatest icons‚Ä¶"
