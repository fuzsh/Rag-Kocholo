        "text": "It's an absolute long shot, I know, but I would really love to see a box set of George Harrison's work on Apple Records.\n\nI guess it was ten years ago that the Dark Horse Records box set was issued. And after recently watching the Martin Scorsese documentary it got me to thinking that it would be really nice if the Harrison Apple albums got the same treatment, in a box and maybe using the Abbey Road team that did the Beatles, (most of) the Lennon and all of the McCartney remasters .\n\nThe 2010 hi-res digital only download 24/96 of ATMP was the best I have ever heard that album sound, personally. It was mastered by the Abbey Road guys.\n\nI think something like the following could be a real winner:\n\nWonderwall Music\n\nElectronic Sound\n\nAll Things Must Pass\n\nThe Concert for Bangladesh\n\nLiving in the Material World\n\nDark Horse\n\nExtra Texture (Read All About It)\n\nBonus Disc (Singles, Outtakes, Demos)\n\nIt bugs me that (most of) the Lennon catalog got a lush remastering by the Abbey Road team as has the McCartney stuff but not Harrison (except ATMP digital only). The CD format isn't getting any younger and it would be nice to have a \"go to\" digital source for GH Apple recordings. Let's face it, the 30th Anniversary ATMP is a mess. Bangladesh is okay I guess but not as good as it could be. Harrison's catalog deserves to have the same care and attention, and I know Olivia has, but the Apple albums have been neglected I think -- at least on compact disc, in my opinion.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n\"Post-production on the Madison Square Garden recordings was minimal, the known examples being Harrison's double-tracked lead vocal on the bridges of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", and a composite edit of his opening song, \"Wah-Wah\", which was assembled from both the shows. In addition, it is possible that Shankar and Khan's \"Bangla Dhun\" was severely edited down: Harrison later described their set as having lasted 45 minutes, yet the running time on the album is under seventeen minutes and in the film just fifteen.\n\nThe final mix down of the recordings, for album and film use, was carried out in Los Angeles in September, by A&M Studios engineers Norman Kinney and Steve Mitchell. In their joint interview for the 2005 Concert for Bangladesh Revisited documentary, Kinney and Mitchell confirm that music from both the afternoon (matinee) and evening performances was used for the concert film and live album; they also state that Spector repeatedly instructed them to increase the volume of the audience in the mixes, in a search for more \"feel of the room\" in the end result. The second show was preferred when it came to selecting the best concert audio. The exceptions are as follows: \"Wah-Wah\", which starts off with the evening version but cuts to the matinee at 2:53; Harrison's band introduction and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", both sourced from the first show; and Russell's medley, which is also from the matinee on the album, but in the concert film, the audio cuts to the evening show during \"Youngblood\".\"\n\nWonderwall is a nice curio but isn't essential. Electronic Sound is pretty lousy by any standard (including Harrison's).\n\nATMP, LitMW, DH, ET would all be part of any such box, of course.\n\nThe rights to Concert for Bangladesh are tied up both in terms of who owns the rights to reissue/distribution, but also the ability to issue any previously unreleased material. Probably too expensive and too much a headache to include in any box.\n\nReading between the lines of what's been made public, one would infer that part of the issue is that the Harrison estate wants too much for any previously unreleased goodies that could make such a box viable--since the rights to these albums are held by Capitol, but the archival material from that era is still controlled by the estate and/or the estate has to sign off on the issue of anything outside the original configurations.\n\nMaybe it's me, but except for the Bonus Disc (Singles, Outtakes, Demos) in your box idea, I don't think it's really needed. All the available George Apple material on CD (and hi-res digital ATMP) sounds very nice to me. They weren't released in the bad shape that Lennon's first CDs were, which greatly benefitted from both a remaster, and also the remixed versions. Then again, IMO Lennon's albums always sounded pretty bad on vinyl too compared to his other three brethren on Apple.\n\nI guess a new box would mostly benefit the people who don't already have all of George's CDs. Unless of course if Steve did the new mastering on the box then I wouldn't think twice about purchasing all of these albums for a third or fourth time.\n\nHere's some interesting and relevant quotes from Harrison's 2001 Yahoo chat\n\nNote that Harrison...\n\nEnvisioned his entire catalog being remastered and re-released in quick succession including alternates and unreleased versions.\n\nHad around 35 songs in mind for \"Brainwashed\" slated for release as early as November 2001.\n\nExpected to release a boxed set of unreleased songs and demos in 2002-2003.\n\nHoped to also release the other Dark Horse artists' catalogs.\n\nMoney quote: \"I'm trying to get everything that has ever been done out there.\"\n\nUnfortunately he wasn't able to see these project through. But you can see potentially how much has yet to be released.\n\nYes, I know about that. And I ask you: If you had free and clear title to release some Harrison rarities, as his label, would you? Of course. It's easy money. This is George Harrison, 1/4 of the Beatles. There was a major documentary about him. The time was ripe. You could just throw stuff out there and create some cash where there wasn't any. If you owned the stuff and had clear title to reissue it, there wouldn't be any issue at all.\n\nDhani would like to imply that EMI (Universal now) is just sitting on this stuff because they can't be bothered. The truth has to be financial. And not as in: EMI sees no market and doesn't want to pay the cost of rolling tape and pressing physical product. As in: The Harrison estate is asking for licensing fees that make these reissues cost prohibitive."
