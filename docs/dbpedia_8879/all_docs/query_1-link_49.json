Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.”\n\nGeorge’s interest in Indian music also brought him to Eastern spiritual practices.\n\nHe even led his members to travel to northern India to study meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.\n\nGeorge wanted to include more of his music on their albums; however, it was hard for him to do so because of the Lennon-McCartney leadership.\n\nIn 1969, he even walked out of the studio while recording their song, “Let It Be.”\n\nHe made the album with various musicians such as Starr, Gary Wright, Klaus Voormann, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, and groups Delaney and Bonnie’s Friends and Badfinger.\n\nDespite its success, George was sued for the copyright of his song “My Sweet Lord” because of its similarity to the hit song, “He’s So Fine” by the Chiffons in 1963.\n\nAfter the release, George organized a charity event at New York City Madison Square Garden on August 1, 1971.\n\nIt was called Concert for Bangladesh and aimed to raise money for the refugees in the Bangladesh Liberation War.\n\nThe show featured artists such as Ravi Shankar, Bob Dylan, Starr, Preston, Clapton, Badfinger, and Leon Russell.\n\nApple released a triple album, “The Concert for Bangladesh,” that won the Grammy Award for Album of the year and ranked on charts in the U.S. and U.K.\n\nOther albums released during his solo career were “Living in the Material World” (1973), “Dark Horse,” “Extra Texture (Read All About It)” (1975), “Thirty-Three & ⅓” (1976), “George Harrison” (1979), “Somewhere in England” (1981), “Gone Troppo” (1982), and “Cloud Nine” (1987).\n\nDespite good reviews from his Dark Horse Tour, it was criticized and was considered a failure.\n\nAfter recording his last album with EMI and Apple Records, he established his studio under the Dark Horse Records label.\n\nHe also started a movie production company called HandMade Films.\n\nIn 1988, George created the group Traveling Wilburys with members Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty.\n\nThe two albums, “Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1” and “Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3,” produced by the group, were huge successes.\n\nThere was never a live performance by the group, and “Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3” was their last release.\n\nThe tour in Japan in December 1991 was the first for George after a long time.\n\nHe also held a benefit concert in April 1992 for the Natural Law Party, and in the same year, performed at a tribute concert for Bob Dylan.\n\nHe joined the Beatles Anthology project with his former Beatles members in 1994.\n\nThey made songs, which included song recordings of their former member, John Lennon, and Beatles interviews.\n\nThey released “Free as a Bird” in 1995 and “Real Love” in 1996.\n\nHe refused to join the making of the third song, mentioning that he wished somebody would also make hit songs out of his demos.\n\nDeath\n\nGeorge was a long-time smoker, and he blamed this for his throat cancer diagnosis.\n\nIn 1998, he was successfully treated for it.\n\nHowever, a year later in December 1999, his life was endangered again when 34-year-old, Michael Abram, broke into his home and attacked him and his wife.\n\nGeorge suffered from a punctured lung and head injuries, while his wife had several cuts and bruises.\n\nHis cancer returned in 2001.\n\nHe underwent lung surgery but found out that the tumor had spread to his brain.\n\nDuring his treatment in Switzerland, Ringo Starr visited him.\n\nHe underwent radiotherapy in New York City at Staten Island University Hospital.\n\nHe died on November 29, 2001, at Paul McCartney’s property in Los Angeles.\n\nHe was cremated, and his ashes were scattered by his close family in a private ceremony in India.\n\nHis son Dhani and Jeff Lynne completed George’s final album entitled “Brainwashed,” released in 2002.\n\nLegacy\n\nHe was the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award in December 1922.\n\nIn 2002, a benefit concert for the first anniversary of his death, called Concert for George, was organized by Eric Clapton, and proceeds were donated to George’s charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation.\n\nHe was inaugurated to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Walk of Fame in 2009.\n\nThere was a self-titled documentary film for him released in October 2011.\n\nHe was awarded The Recording Academy Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammy Awards in February 2015.\n\nGeorge Harrison Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle that includes everything you need to know about George Harrison across 30 in-depth pages.
