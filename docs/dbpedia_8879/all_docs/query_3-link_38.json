        "text": "If you don’t know the story of The Beatles’ new song, that’s okay, Paul McCartney will tell you. He is in control of the narrative, just as he likes to be, and he will repeat it in multiple interviews in the ensuing months (and years). (Love you Paul.)\n\nOkay, okay, okay.\n\nIn 1994, Yoko Ono gave the three surviving Beatles a tape containing four uncompleted John Lennon songs. They completed two, “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love,” yet left “Now and Then” unfinished, as they became frustrated by the quality and clarity of John’s vocal (and apparently ran out of time, according to Paul in the new documentary about the making of the song).\n\nThen Peter Jackson and his team crafted a technology during the production of Get Back that would allow John’s vocal to be separated from his piano playing. Suddenly, his vocal was crystal clear. (Love you Peter Jackson.)\n\nSo in true Beatles fashion, Paul went to work. He re-recorded his bass part.\n\nAnd called Ringo in to play drums.\n\nAnd asked Giles Martin to score the orchestration, just as his father would have.\n\nAnd, while George’s guitar parts from the 1995 recording sessions remain a part of the track, Paul recorded a slide guitar solo as a tribute to George.\n\nYes, the final Beatles’ track is here: “Now and Then.”\n\nIn short, I love it. While I haven’t read too many reactions to the song, I think it is important to establish and accept the following facts before critiquing or commenting on the song:\n\nJohn Lennon recorded the demo for “Now and Then” in 1977.\n\nJohn Lennon was murdered in 1980.\n\nPaul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr began working on this track in February 1995 as part of the Anthology sessions.\n\nGeorge Harrison died of cancer in 2001.\n\nWhile “Now and Then” features contributions from all four Beatles (thus making it a Beatles track), they were not all in the same room at the same time, actively collaborating and recording together. This does not make this track an outlier in The Beatles’ discography, however (even outside of “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love”).\n\nFurthermore, the song is not a product of AI, despite the click-bait article titles. Peter Jackson and his team developed a software system to uncouple John’s voice from the piano. There is nothing artificial about the production. Humans labored over this production with care and love. It has been in the making for decades.\n\nIf you can accept these facts, then I think you can approach the song with a clearer perspective.\n\nNow some opinions.\n\nI first became a Beatles fan in the mid-1990s, with the release of The Beatles Anthology and the first new Beatles songs in decades, “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love.” I saved the VHS tape of the ABC broadcast of The Beatles Anthology, including the countdown to the video premiere of “Real Love”, for a long time. I’m a little sad that the practical part of me discarded it after upgrading to the DVD set (I used to check out the full-length video set from the local library for years, also being a frugal child). I love those songs and videos. They are pure nostalgia for me, taking me back to that magical time when everything about The Beatles was fresh and new to me – and when I could tell kids at school who taunted “Aren’t they all, like, DEAD?” “Actually, NO! Only John Lennon is dead because he was MURDERED!!!!” (Outside his home. In front of his wife. He was shot in the back. By a COWARD. And here we are, 40+ years later with mass shootings still happening on a regular basis in this country. Just bubbling over with anger here. But I digress.) I’m still a little taken aback to learn that there are people (Beatles fans even) who dislike these songs or don’t consider them “real” Beatles songs.\n\nI never thought there would be another “new” Beatles song. Learning that there would be, however, I did not expect that new Beatles song to be as impactful or groundbreaking as say “In My Life” or “A Day in the Life” or even “Got to Get You Into My Life.”\n\nYet, I cannot stop listening to this song or watching the video, and I do find it deeply affecting and meaningful.\n\nThe video, directed by Peter Jackson, is the perfect companion to the song’s lyrics and meaning (as I interpret them, anyway). We see the three surviving Beatles working on the song in the 1990s and as John begins to sing, we see his profile gazing at a beautiful sunset. An image of The Beatles in their bathing costumes from a famous 1963 Dezo Hoffman photo session supersedes the sunset; Paul, in 2023, harmonizes with John: “it’s all because of…you.” The marriage of the now and the then.\n\nI imagine John, writing and recording this song in 1977, reflecting on his life and in particular his time and friendships with The Beatles. This is the man who declared in 1980: “The Beatles is over, but John, Paul, George, and Ringo…God knows what relationship they’ll have in the future. I still love those guys!” These four men lived an unique set of experiences only they could relate to. “The comfort of being four together,” George remarked at one point in the Anthology series, comparing their collective experience to that of the singular Elvis.\n\n“Now and then,” Paul and Ringo sing along with John. “I miss you.” Cut to George and John laughing at Shea Stadium. And there are tears welling in my eyes and goosebumps prickling on my arms every single time. (And did I mention how many times I have watched this video? A lot.)\n\nPeter Jackson did employ some AI to blend the past and present in the video: jocular footage of John and George from the 1967 promo for “Hello Goodbye” is placed alongside a focused Ringo and Paul recording the track in 2023. The Beatles were a joyful group of individuals, after all. (And how much joy have they collectively brought the world!) It is a bittersweet, yet buoyant, Beatles reunion in song and on film. “Oh now and then/I want you to be there for me/Always to return to me.” If John wasn’t singing about his bandmates in 1977, he is now. And it is so beautiful and touching.\n\nCall it cosmic, call it divine, but the fact that these four men were born in the same time, in the same city, and somehow found their way to each other and achieved what they did is not coincidental. And the bond and love they had was not intended to end at the grave. I do believe that. You can extend that lyrical metaphor to your own loved ones. The eventual reunion of now and then.\n\nThe final minute or so of the video also tugs on all the heart strings as the “now” transcends further and further into the “then”: the final group photo session, Shea Stadium, images of Hamburg, the Beatles in their youth. And finally, a scene from A Hard Day’s Night, with the group taking their famous “Beatles bow” as their images fade away. The perfect closure for this perfect band. (Yes, this band is perfect. This reunion does not taint or lessen their legacy in any way.)\n\nDid I say I love it? I do. I really do.\n\nOh, and the final words John supposedly said to Paul?\n\n“Think of me again now and then, old friend.”\n\nP.S. “Love Me Do” also sounds pretty good in stereo. But I’m just not over this song yet.\n\nThanksgiving 2021 brought an opportunity to reflect and express gratitude for many blessings, culminating in the long-awaited premiere of Peter Jackson’s three-part series The Beatles: Get Back. The original Let It Be film has yet to be given an official release, and it (and the accompanying period in the Beatles’ career it documents) has been canonized as a miserable portrait of the Beatles breaking up. “We showed how the breakup of a band works,” Paul McCartney stated in The Beatles Anthology, the seminal documentary of the band’s career in their own words.\n\nConsequently, Let It Be has never been a favorite album of mine. The four somber, separate images of the Beatles on the album’s cover, pasted against a solid black background, are representative of the fractured band. It has felt more like a funeral procession than the metaphorical cover of Abbey Road. And I just never really counted any of its songs among my favorites.\n\nYet, I went into Get Back with no preconceived notions or expectations. I was excited, highly suspected I would love it, yet I did not truly expect to love the film so much nor learn so much. (At one point during my viewing, my husband asked me, “So are you actually learning anything new from this or did you already know everything?” To which I immediately replied, “Yes, I am. It is endlessly fascinating!”)\n\nThe original film (which I never saw until I downloaded a bootleg after being frustrated with all the Let It Be questions hampering my speed of victory in Beatles Trivial Pursuit) is dark, jumbles some performances and conversations together, and calls it a day. With 150 hours of audio recording and 60 hours of film footage, it’s not too surprising. Peter Jackson’s Get Back, on the other hand, provides context for the film: the band, who quit touring in 1966, have increasingly relied on studio technology for their recording career, resulting in them spending less time playing “live” together as a cohesive unit on record. The film documents their quest to create a new album with the four members playing together, ending in their first live performance in nearly three years. Furthermore, Ringo is due to begin filming The Magic Christian at the end of January, so they have a tight deadline—essentially two weeks to rehearse, record, and perform their new record of 14 songs (the typical Beatles offering; they believed in giving their fans their money’s worth–now they know we will give them our money freely with any reissue). Get Back, unlike Let It Be, has a clear, linear narrative that is purposeful and compelling.\n\nPart One: The Beatles at Twickenham (Days 1-7)\n\nTwickenham Studios is a dreary setting, and the events that transpire there reflect that. Denis O’Dell, manager of Apple films, has suggested the location to the Beatles. They can rehearse, record, and eventually perform for an audience there. Once the record and film are completed, Ringo can just pop down the hall to start filming The Magic Christian. It seems to be a matter of convenience rather than a result of the Beatles’ choice or spontaneity (which, George later points out, is when the best things happen for the band). The soundstage is large, dark, and even lacks proper recording equipment. Dickens himself could not have crafted more efficient foreshadowing.\n\nIn this stage of the film, we see what I believe the Beatles allowed to color their memories of the project in later years (hence why the film has been locked away for the last 50 years). There are a few lighthearted, joyful moments, but more often, you see boredom and misery on the faces of the Beatles (especially Ringo, George, and John, who is counting down the days until the weekend). Paul, who confers with the filmmakers frequently, appears to be the most invested in the project, especially the idea of a live performance. “Just give it up,” George declares in exasperation at one point, as they discuss (yet again) ridiculous sites for this performance. (There is even mention of taking fans with them on a boat. “And then on top of that we’re stuck with a bloody big boatload of people for two weeks,” George, the voice of reason, concludes.) “I’m here because I want to do a show, but I don’t feel an awful lot of support,” Paul comments.\n\nThese discussions are tedious, and the rehearsals equally so at times. You hear different members playing fragments of songs that would become fixtures of their respective solo careers: “All Things Must Pass,” “Another Day,” “Jealous Guy,” “Gimme Some Truth,” “Back Seat of My Car.” It’s hard to separate these songs from their solo careers for me, and I see, in these moments, that these are four musicians who may have not outgrown each other but certainly need the space and freedom to pursue their own projects. They are strong individuals, yet there is still a camaraderie among them and a drive to stay together as a band.\n\nYoko Ono, who has carried a fair share of the blame for the band’s breakup, is a non-invasive presence (until she is given access to a microphone – Mal, get me an anvil and a hammer STAT!!!!!). She knits, she paints, she reads, she writes, but she rarely speaks or interjects her thoughts and opinions. Perhaps her presence on The White Album created awkward, tense moments between the group, but they seem to have adapted to her attendance by this point. (Truthfully, I find the presence of George’s Hare Krishna friends much more odd and illogical.)\n\nInstead, the tension between John, Paul, George, and Ringo is rooted in the fact that they have grown as individuals and the increasingly impossible pressure they have put themselves under with this latest group project.\n\nThe famous argument between George and Paul (“I’ll play whatever you want me to play, or I won’t play at all…whatever it is that will please you, I’ll do it.”) is set up appropriately in Peter Jackson’s film. While working on “Two of Us,” George and Paul have different approaches about how to finish a song. Paul wants things “uncomplicated” until they have a rough version of the song completed; George feels he can figure out his part simultaneously. Paul, not wanting to antagonize George any further, stands up and walks away briefly and then proposes they work on another song. No, George replies, let’s finish this one.\n\nThe conversation is tense (John and Ringo don’t utter a single word throughout), yet respectful, and there is no real resolution, as they will repeat the discussion in a few days with a different song.\n\nGeorge comes in one morning and plays “I Me Mine,” which he wrote the previous night, to the group. Paul approaches John shortly thereafter. “Haven’t you written anything else? We’re about to be in a crisis.” His statement is a truthful expression of the situation — they do not have a single song that they have learned well enough to record and perform — but it could also be a subtle comment on the value of George’s contributions, which strains their relationship as a group as well.\n\nOn Day 7 (Friday 10 January 1969), the group rehearses “Get Back.” The song is in its beginning stages, without clear lyrics or its signature shuffling rhythm.\n\n“You need Eric Clapton playing on top of it,” George says.\n\n“No. You don’t. You need, like, a…” Paul searches for the words.\n\n“George Harrison,” John says.\n\n“You need George Harrison, but just doing simple things until it’s your go, you know…Because otherwise you get the guitar conflicting with what you’re singing, and all that.”\n\nLater, Paul suggests they break for lunch.\n\n“I think I’ll be…I’m leaving the band,” George announces.\n\n“When?” John asks.\n\n“Now,” George replies nonchalantly, distractedly. “See ya ‘round the clubs.”\n\n“Got up went to Twickenham rehearsed until lunch time – left the Beatles – went home” reads George’s diary for the day.\n\nGeorge’s departure is not dramatic or full of malice. It’s a matter of fact and a natural consequence of the shifting dynamics of the band. “George is versus John and Paul when it comes to what they’re going to do and what they’re going to play and you try doing that for a few months, you’re going to end up pissed off,” Neil Aspinall explains succinctly and perfectly.\n\nAfter lunch, John, Paul, and Ringo carry on half-heartedly — Paul is practicing acrobatics, John sings “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer” mockingly, and Yoko wails away on a microphone that is unfortunately powered on. The group is laughing and joking, whether because they don’t take George’s exit seriously or they’re masking the sadness they must feel over their fissuring bond. There is a dramatic zoom in on George’s turquoise velvet cushions, unoccupied by his bony rear.\n\n“If he doesn’t come back by Tuesday, we’ll get Clapton,” John says.\n\nThe final shot shows John, Paul, and Ringo in a group huddle, “Isn’t It a Pity” providing the soundtrack. They meet with George the following day, and the meeting does not end well, the subtitles inform us.\n\nEnd of Act One.\n\nDang, I know what happens, but I am on the edge of my seat, clamoring for the next episode.\n\nPart Two: Home Again at Apple (Days 8-16)\n\nPart Two contains some of the most revelatory moments of the series. It opens with Ringo, Paul, Linda, and other associates discussing the previous meeting with George and how to move forward. John is absent. Linda observes that John was quiet during the band’s earlier meeting and how Yoko was speaking for John, whom, she believes, didn’t seem to believe any of it.\n\n“If it came to push between the Beatles and Yoko, it’s Yoko,” Paul admits. Talking about their songwriting partnership, he states writing is awkward with Yoko present, as the subject matter would become “white walls or something.”\n\nThe action is at a standstill without John (or George). No one can reach John by phone.\n\n“And then there were two,” Paul says quietly, tears welling up in his eyes. It’s sad. He loves this band and these men, and he feels it slipping away (rightly so). Mal Evans (bless this man, what a treasure he was) enters shortly thereafter and says John is on the phone, does Paul want to speak to him? Paul eagerly jumps up.\n\nWhile Paul is gone, Linda is vocal about the direction the band should take. Speaking as a fan, she thinks they need to play live to an audience again. Locations are thrown around again. “Brighton Beach would be all right,” Linda says.\n\n“No — stay out of this, Yoko,” Paul, reappearing, says with a smile, which Linda returns. These two are the cutest.\n\nJohn shows up later, and he and Paul have a revealing conversation (which they do not know is being recorded via a hidden microphone in a flowerpot) in the studio’s cafeteria.\n\n“It’s a festering wound we’ve allowed…and yesterday we allowed it to go deeper, and we didn’t give him any bandages,” John says passionately. John also admits he has been in the same position as George — submissive to Paul’s ideas and arrangements.\n\n“You’ve always been boss, and I’ve always been secondary boss,” Paul argues.\n\n“Not always,” John says.\n\n“Always!” Paul insists.\n\nIt’s fascinating how these two men view their position in the Beatles at this time. Just fascinating.\n\nThe conversation concludes with Paul assuming that George is coming back and John agreeing to go along with “the policy” because it has been what has kept them together. When they return to rehearsing, John is detached and irritable. He speaks openly of using drugs the night before (he was in the midst of his heroin addiction at the time). The fact that these scenes were allowed in the film by both Disney and the Beatles is astonishing, and I am grateful for the freedom Peter Jackson was allowed to tell this story authentically.\n\nPaul is increasingly frustrated and saddened with the band’s lack of progress. “We can’t carry on like this indefinitely,” he declares. “We need a schedule. Achieve something every day.” This is the kind of work ethic that has defined and driven his career.\n\nRingo, John, and Paul meet with George again, and the outcome is positive. Their meeting is productive, and they collectively agree to change the direction of the Get Back project, abandoning the idea of a live performance and Twickenham Studios in favor of Apple Studios.\n\nOnce at Apple, the atmosphere is much more amiable and comfortable. (“It’s like home here,” John says at one point.) They are no longer dwarfed by the rehearsal space, and you see them enjoying each other’s company–even before Billy Preston arrives. (In The Beatles Anthology, George remembers everyone being on their best behavior once Billy Preston arrived because “you don’t actually want people to know you’re bitchy” — oh George, I love you.) And once Billy Preston does become part of the project, his playing elevates their songs, so much so that there is even a brief discussion of adding him as a permanent member. Paul dismisses the idea by saying, “It’s bad enough with four.”\n\nThere is noticeably less discussion of the live performance. Michael Lindsay-Hogg, the original director of Let It Be, comments, “I don’t know what story I’m telling anymore. I’ve got smokers, nail biters, and nose pickers.”\n\n“We are rather uncouth,” Paul quips. “We’re not elite.”\n\nNot to disrespect Michael Lindsay-Hogg too much, but he completely misses the point. This is the story. You don’t need the “payoff” at the end of a live performance in an outlandish location. The story is this band trying to make their new album, navigating their changing dynamics and interests. Maybe that was difficult to see while in the thick of it; hindsight certainly helps. Or maybe this project just needed Peter Jackson all along.\n\nBy the end of Part Two, the rooftop of Apple Studios is suggested as the venue for the live performance to end the film, and the band plans to perform in four days’ time.\n\nPart 3: The Rooftop (Days 17-22)\n\nWith the timeline ever tightening, the band comes in to work on the weekend. Ringo plays “Octopus’s Garden” for George, who offers ideas and support.\n\nJohn and Yoko arrive. “What am I playing, Richie?” John asks.\n\n“You’ll be on drums.”\n\n“I’m not getting on that kit without a ciggy!”\n\n(This film contains tobacco depiction, you know.)\n\nLinda’s young daughter Heather comes to the studio. It’s endearing to see how each of the Beatles interact with her, particularly John who always said he never knew how to “be” with children. He has a playful conversation with her about cats. Heather later imitates Yoko on the microphone, and it’s hilarious.\n\nIn Part One, George had stated, “Since Mr. Epstein passed away, it’s never been the same.”\n\n“We’ve been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away,” Paul agrees.\n\nThe absence of this fatherly authority figure who kept the Beatles safe and disciplined creates a black hole for a figure like Allen Klein to enter and swallow up these vulnerable beings. John recalls meeting Allen Klein for the first time, raving about how he knew everything about the Beatles. He’s enthralled, and he shares his enthusiasm with George.\n\nAt this point, my happy-go-lucky 4-month-old son started fussing. He knows what’s up! The disagreement over management (and the decisions Allen Klein ultimately does make) tear these four men apart. Paul simply never trusts him; the other three are fooled.\n\nOn a lighter note, one of my favorite moments (because I’m actually 12) is when Ringo turns to George Martin and announces, “I’ve farted. I thought I’d just let you know. I was gonna sit here silent and look at you. Then I thought no, I’ll tell you about it.”\n\nPaul quickly creates some distance between himself and Ringo.\n\nHa. Ha. Ha. I love you, Ringo.\n\nAlthough the songs are progressing, there is a discussion between John and Paul about the lack of an aim for the project except for an album, always an album!!! They don’t have 14 songs ready, and they need to rehearse more.\n\n“We’re not doing a payoff,” complains Paul.\n\n“I agree but we’ve only got seven, let’s do seven!” answers John.\n\nINSTANT karma, man.\n\nGeorge later shares with John his desire to do a solo album because he has enough songs for his quota on Beatles albums for the next ten years. He wants to release them all at once and see what all of his songs sound like together. He expresses his wish to do his own thing but preserve the Beatles as well. “That’s great,” Yoko enthuses.\n\nDear God, can we have an alternate universe where this actually happened and I can visit there on weekends????\n\nOn the day of the Rooftop concert, there are ten cameras in place to document the event – five on the roof, one on the building across the street, three at street level, and one “hidden” camera in the reception area of the Apple building. The Beatles are in the basement having a meeting about whether to actually go through with the concert. “Let’s do it,” John declares. Who’s the leader of this group again?\n\nOnce on the roof, the band launches into “Get Back.” (Side note — one of the criticisms I have read of this film is how many times this song is heard, which whatever, but I mean, does Paul ever once sing the line “get back” while staring at Yoko, as John once alleged? Paranoid much, ha.) Peter Jackson utilizes the split screen to show the different camera views of the Rooftop concert.\n\nDown on the street, many passersby instantly recognize the music as The Beatles and are pleased, while others are immortalized as total goobers.\n\n“It’s a bloody stupid place to have a concert.”\n\n“Woke me up from my sleep, and I don’t like it!”\n\n“Disrupting all the business!”\n\nThese people are of different genders, races, ages, backgrounds: the perfect reflection of The Beatles’ audience. The Beatles playing on the rooftop, ultimately, was the perfect location for their audience to hear them. They’re not playing to an elite audience lucky enough to win a golden ticket; the music is for everybody.\n\nThe police constables arrive at Apple, visibly irritated and annoyed. “We’ve had 30 complaints, turn it down, or I’m going to start arresting people,” one threatens.\n\nThe Apple staff is coy. “I don’t know what they’re doing on the roof.”\n\nHa. Ha. Ha.\n\n“You can go up to the roof, but don’t actually go ON the roof because it’s overweight.”\n\nHa. Ha. HA!\n\nIn the end, The Beatles are triumphant; the peace is disrupted, but no arrests are made–only history.\n\n“I’d like to say thank you on behalf of the group, and I hope we passed the audition.”\n\nBack inside, they discuss and listen back to the performance. There is mention of it being a dry run for something else, which ultimately never happens, of course. They are pleased with the playback and plan to return the following day to finish the final recordings (which play over the end credits).\n\nFor a total running time of approximately 8 hours, one episode of Get Back is considerably longer than the original Let It Be film and rivals the entirety of The Beatles Anthology, which tells the Beatles’ whole story. In just a few hours more, the Beatles recorded their first album. It seems the length is the chief criticism of the film, with some even suggesting there should be a condensed version for a wider audience, the casual fan.\n\nTo which I say: tough.\n\nI really don’t care about the wider audience or the casual fan. I have waited for this for as long as I have been a Beatles fan at seven years old. Is it selfish to say that this film is for me and fans like me (but hey, you can be one of us, too, I don’t mind)? It is a sad reflection of our self-indulgent, self-centered culture, with its short attention span and constant quest for instant gratification (it’s tiresome and BORING to watch them rehearse “Get Back” yet again, wah wah), if this complete, rich portrait of this historic group cannot be appreciated in its full length. Don’t people binge an entire season of a show in one sitting? What’s the difference?\n\nI also have seen a few comments lamenting on “what could have been.” The conversation between John and George about pursuing outside interests and projects, while at the same time maintaining the Beatles’ partnership, was allegedly never shared with Paul or Ringo. I recently listened to an interview with Mitch Albom, where he spoke about the death of his adopted daughter. He spent a lot of time feeling angry, wondering why she was taken from him and his wife until he turned the conversation to what was given to them. What a wonderful outlook to have. The Beatles have given so much–and continue to do so. They are the sound of my beating heart.\n\nThank you, Peter Jackson (and all those involved), for telling this story in such a genuine and beautiful way. It has made what I once considered the impossible to happen: I just want to listen to Let It Be (one of my least favorite Beatles albums) on repeat, and my love for this band has grown even more.\n\nIt’s a love that lasts forever. It’s a love that has no past.\n\nI often wonder about my love for The Beatles–why it is so inexplicable and embedded in my DNA and how millions of people, different from me in innumerable ways, feel precisely the same. Maybe this ingrained, intense feeling is why fans are so incredibly protective of the band’s legacy and equally critical of anything pertaining to The Fab Four, even if it is a feature-length documentary directed by an Academy Award winner named Ron Howard.\n\nThe producer of the film, Nigel Sinclair, who also produced Martin Scorsese’s documentary about George Harrison Living in the Material World, explained fans’ dual reaction to the announcement of the film: “Ron had people come up to him in the street and [they would] say ‘Mr. Howard, I’m so glad you’re doing the Beatles film.’ Ron said, ‘Of course the subtext is “And don’t screw it up.”’\n\nFrom me to you (hey, I’m trying my zest here), he does not mess it up.\n\n(My criticisms are few and minute, so let’s get them out of the way. I find the commentary from individuals not part of the Beatles’ circle superfluous, unnecessary, and rarely insightful. Do I care what Sigourney Weaver wore to see The Beatles at Shea Stadium? Not really. Do I care that Jon Savage’s parents wouldn’t let him go to a Beatles concert? Not really. What makes them different from the thousands of other ordinary people who loved The Beatles just as fervently? Oh, right, they are of some renown. Whatever. Get out. Secondly, the film’s tagline boasts that this film is about the band you know but the story you don’t…well, not really. I didn’t really learn anything new, but I did see lots of new photos and footage, and I got to see The Beatles on the big screen, replete with the entire Shea Stadium concert. Horrid snobby portion of this post over.)\n\nEight Days A Week: The Touring Years tells the story of The Beatles, using their live performances as its focus, which, on the surface, may seem odd, since The Beatles were never exactly synonymous with extraordinary live performances. They didn’t have pigs or light their instruments on fire or create auto-destructive art. Their audiences were not rapt in hearing the words of a lyrical poet, as Dylan’s fans were (a fact he was proud of in his early career, especially when The Beatles’ phenomenon surfaced). For much of their performing career, the music was secondary to the spectacle of seeing The Beatles. By choosing this least-regarded facet of the band, however, Howard is able to more fully reveal how the Beatles progressed and evolved by contrasting it with the circus-like atmosphere of their increasingly stagnant live performances.\n\nThe Beatles’ stage performances weren’t always so stagnant, though, and their success was not an accident that happened overnight. Ringo states in the film that playing was the most important thing for the band, and their stints in Hamburg, Germany, allowed them the opportunity to perfect their craft while playing for eight or more hours every night—to unruly, difficult-to-please crowds or to an empty club (empty except for a bearded drummer from another Liverpool group, Ringo Starr). This was their apprenticeship, this is where they learned how to play in front of people–how to mach schau, and when they returned to England, they broke the jazz-only rule at Liverpool’s The Cavern Club, performing a total of nearly 300 times. Having dominated The Cavern Club and garnered a local following, the group was still looking to improve and to move the next step up the ladder.\n\nThat next step up the ladder was not what any of The Beatles expected: Beatlemania. Opening with color footage of the band playing in Manchester in November 1963, the film shows the excitement and the burgeoning mania: girls screaming, fainting, and the sheer joy John, Paul, George, and Ringo exude. The film illustrates this joy and excitement perfectly with its abundance of unseen (or, at least, under-seen) concert and interview footage. Fans debate the sexiness of the members (“Ringo’s got a sexy nose.” “George’s eyelashes are sexy.”) and declare their undying love for them: “Paul McCartney, if you’re out there listening, Adrian from Brooklyn loves you.” Fans’ adoration for the Beatles ignites laughter but is genuine—and contagious. Just as contagious and laughter-inducing is The Beatles’ humor—then and now. Just a few favorites: John introduces himself to a reporter as Eric, George uses John’s mop top as an ashtray, George thanks Ringo for his contribution to a fan club record and remarks “We’ll phone you,” and Ringo recalls his inability to hear the band’s music at their concerts, “I couldn’t hear anything. All I could see was Paul’s arse, John’s arse…” Ringo had the best seat, am I right?\n\nAfter conquering Europe, the Beatles arrived in the United States, where the madness escalated to a whole new level. While the Beatles complied with the larger venues (and greater profits) and increasingly manic American crowds, they refused to accommodate the demands of segregated venues. In this regard, they were pioneers, standing for what they believed to be right. As journalist Larry Kane, who accompanied The Beatles on their 1964 North American tour, remarked, he was touched by The Beatles’ kindness, their genuineness, and their intelligence.\n\nAfter 1964, though, The Beatles’ pioneering in the live arena stalled, except by breaking attendance records by playing in larger venues. The opposite was true of their recording career, where they continued to flourish. With each record, they progressed, wrote better songs, and experimented with new sounds and ideas, culminating with the release of Revolver in May 1966. Tellingly, the Beatles never performed any songs from Revolver live, demonstrating how the sophistication of their recording career had overtaken the circus that was their live show.\n\nBy 1966, the group’s rosy relationship with the public was fraying. Not only were their performances inaudible but touring had become a life-threatening situation, which escalated with John Lennon’s remark that The Beatles were, in fact, more popular than Jesus Christ. (Real talk hurts.) Even their relationship with the press, who had adored their wit and cheekiness, was verging on hostile. In a clip, one journalists asks The Beatles why they are so “horrid snobby.” Paul, irrefutably the most diplomatic Beatle, answers that they are not snobby but the journalists and their questions are not particularly nice and get what they deserve. (Again, real talk hurts.) Death threats, Beatle burnings, and exploding firecrackers at concerts became the new norm for The Fab Four. They arrived to their final concert, at San Francisco’s Candlestick Park on August 29, 1966, in an armored truck. They decided they’d had enough–of touring, at least. Still, in these tense moments, you can still see their camaraderie and the joy their music brings.\n\nDespite all the obstacles this band faced — touring was a money-making venture not an artistic one, their concerts lasted no more than thirty minutes and offered little variation in terms of set lists, and oh yeah, the screaming which made it impossible for them to hear one another — the film shows what a good live band The Beatles were. They could have easily not put any effort into their live shows at all, but they were often in tune and played as a cohesive unit. That unity is a testament to their closeness as individuals and their faith in one another, my favorite aspect of the film.\n\n“I was an only child, and I suddenly felt as if I had three brothers,” Ringo states in the film. Paul gets emotional recalling the first moment Ringo played with the group, and George expresses how he was always glad that they had one another to lean on and share the experience, unlike an isolated Elvis or Sinatra, declaring, “We were very, very close to one another.” This is the band that went from staying in a single cramped room in the back of a theater in Hamburg to occupying the entire floor of the New York Plaza Hotel, where they found themselves gathering together in one room to get away from the pressure of being Beatles and just be with each other.\n\nThey loved one another and had faith in each other, just as many individuals around them had faith in them — notably George Martin having faith in their artistic vision to not touch the unorthodox structure and sound of “Tomorrow Never Knows” and Brian Epstein sacrificing so much for them and maintaining his faith in them despite no measurable success for so long (John Lennon once said there was a period where the only people who had faith in the band were Brian Epstein and George Harrison). And by having faith in each other, they inspired others to have faith in one another — so that it didn’t matter if you were black or white, weird or popular, young or old; The Beatles were a uniting force, beautifully encapsulated by the chorus of grown men singing “She Loves You” to celebrate their football club’s victory season. And there it is — that inexplicable feeling of love swelling inside me. I love The Beatles like no other. They are, quite simply, without precedent.\n\nI have read a lot of books about The Beatles, so many that I began to lose faith in ever finding another one that would teach me something new or let me see them from a different perspective. I have become more and more picky about which books I will spend my time reading, especially when it comes to the Beatles — so much so that when I am in the midst of reading one and an author refers to John Lennon as the oldest Beatle, I stop reading. Because if you can’t get something that simple correct, what else are you mucking up? So, this past holiday season, when The Fest for Beatles fans touted not just one but three books as essential for every Beatles fan, I was skeptical. But oh, was I wrong! These three books are, you might say, the toppermost of the poppermost when it comes to Beatles reading…\n\n1. All the Songs: The Story Behind Every Beatles Release by Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin\n\nI adore this book so much I’ve already read it twice, stuffing it with post-it notes along the way. As the title suggests, this book gives you the full story about every Beatles release. This first includes an overview of each studio album and EP, and then a delicious (yes, delicious) track-by-track dissection — we’re talking the genesis of each song (i.e. what inspired them to write the song or, if it’s a cover, when they started working the song into their impressive and extensive repertoire), discussion of each song’s production, technical details, who played what, who wrote what, recording and mixing dates, the technical team (bless ’em), and the number of takes (this gets kind of crazy around oh, I don’t know…”Maxwell’s Silver Hammer.” Bang, bang!). Oh, and there’s also little yellow boxes exclaiming “FOR BEATLES FANATICS” (…who else?), and they are packed with the tiniest, coolest tidbits…like how there is no bass after the first minute of “Strawberry Fields Forever” or the mono version of “She’s Leaving Home” is slightly faster and higher than the stereo version (boo, mono forever). Here’s what a typical spread looks like:\n\nI’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Paul definitely has the best butt in the Beatles.\n\nIsn’t it beautiful? The spread design, I mean — not Paul’s butt (although it is pretty great, let’s be real, people).\n\nAll the Songs is a great (albeit hefty) reference book that I know I will return to again and again. William J. Dowlding’s Beatlesongs has been my go-to when it comes to specifics about the Beatles’ music for years, but All the Songs just may replace it.\n\nI love that this book’s main focus is on the Beatles as musicians, songwriters, and recording artists with minimal personal information or defamation. I thought I knew it all, but this book taught me so much more about their songwriting and recording processes, and I came away with an even greater appreciation of and love for their music and the Beatles as musicians — who would have thought that was even possible? Not I.\n\n2. The Beatles: The BBC Archives: 1962-1970 by Kevin Howlett\n\nAgain, the title gives it all away — this book digs into the BBC Archives and gives readers every available detail about the Beatles relationship with the indomitable BBC (who, eager housekeepers that they were, got rid of so many of their performances). The book comes with reproductions of some of the documents Howlett uncovered in his extensive research, including manager Brian Epstein’s application for the Beatles (which, at the time, still included Pete Best on drums) to audition for the BBC radio and the staff’s subsequent response to their audition: “An unusual group, not as ‘rocky’ as most, more C+W [Country and Western], with a tendency to play music.” The same staffer approved of Lennon as a singer but not McCartney (“Paul McCartney — NO.”).\n\nThe early years are fascinating because, like the recordings now available on Live at the BBC and On Air: Live at the BBC, Volume 2, they tell us so much about the Beatles as musicians and their personalities. First, the Beatles worked hard and often a relentless, frantic pace. Their first album (well, ten of its fourteen tracks) was recorded in about ten hours; this is seen as a remarkable achievement, but, as Howlett writes, their work rate at the BBC was even higher: “Apart from when they were performing in front of an audience for a broadcast, The Beatles had to complete five or six songs in a short session. They were not fazed by this requirement.” Furthermore, their radio performances were limited by the BBC’s equipment: they had to record on mono machines and any mistakes would have to either be edited out and replaced with a separate take or a lengthy overdubbing process. Thus, most of their BBC performances were recorded live, direct to tape, revealing their strength and talent as musicians and what exciting performers they were.\n\nThe other aspect of their BBC performances is that they offer insight into the Beatles’ as music fans — what they liked to listen to and what inspired them. During their radio program Pop Go the Beatles, 39 of the songs heard in the series were not available on the Beatles’ records by the series’ conclusion and 26 of those 39 would remain unreleased during the Beatles’ recording career. Of course, many of these are now available on the Live at the BBC series, and they tell us what the Beatles liked — lots of Chuck Berry, Elvis, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, and records and artists that remain rare and unheard to this day (“Devil in His Heart” by the Donays, anyone?). This large repertoire of songs that remained unreleased on record gives us an indication of what accomplished musicians they were and how much variety they were able to have in their set-lists in their early performing days. And not only did they cover these songs, they made them their own, they gave them the Beatles sound.\n\nThen there were the interviews and on-air banter between the performers and presenters that tell us what naturally charming and witty people the Beatles were. Howlett’s book is full of transcripts of such banter, some available on the BBC recordings, some not (I would love to hear a recording of the 1964 interview with Paul by George, who, at the end of the interview, thanked Paul and told him he’d receive his “three shilling fee at a later date!”). They liked to call presenter Lee Peters Pee Litres (tee hee), and when presenter Rodney Burke introduced himself, “My name’s Rodney Burke, thank you very much!” John Lennon interjected, as only he could: “That’s your fault!”\n\nLater, however, the Beatles simply had less time (and, likely, interest) to drop into the BBC and thus their final BBC session was in 1965. They still offered interviews and television appearances, and the details of these offer insight into how they were changing as a band and as people. For example, when interviewed for a program called The Lennon and McCartney Songbook, Howlett’s transcript indicates McCartney’s diplomatic nature, while Lennon is subdued, grumpy even, showing how he was becoming restless with being a Beatle (and likely very stressed and nervous about their upcoming tour of the US, who didn’t take kindly to his “more popular than Jesus” remark).\n\nInteresting also is the interviews of 1969 and 1970, when relations between band members were very tense and strained at times. In 1970, George was asked about the split of the group and answered, in part: “It’s the end of The Beatles like maybe how people imagine The Beatles….I can see this year us all doing a separate album each and by that time people will probably think there’s no chance at all of there ever being Beatles again. And then suddenly, there’s Beatles again.” Only eleven days after this interview was broadcast, Paul McCartney announced he had quit the band (well, basically). Jerk!\n\nThe BBC Archives is a fascinating examination of the Beatles as recording artists and people, demonstrated by their recordings and interviews given to the BBC. I’d argue that the following statements made by Howlett are some of the most important to be written or uttered about this most-written and most-uttered-about band: “The brilliant innovations made by The Beatles in their latter years are, quite rightly, regarded as pioneering achievements that continue to influence musicians. But if you did not experience the group’s musical progression as it happened, listening to The Beatles without that chronological context can distort an historical view of their career. The picture on With the Beatles may not seem so now, but in 1963 it was extremely radical. So was the album’s music: energetic, visceral, and cutting edge. Indeed, the initial years of The Beatles’ success, 1963 and 1964, may well be their most revolutionary.” Yes, yes, yes!\n\nThis book, coupled with the Live at the BBC recordings, shows just how revolutionary and fun they were in those early years. In a BBC Audience Research Report, a solicitor, self-described as “definitely over-twenty,” wrote: “How can anyone fail to like them? Their music is so gay and uninhibited, and they themselves are so full of joie-de-vivre.” Amen, brother.\n\n3. The Beatles: All These Years, Volume 1: Tune In by Mark Lewisohn\n\nWhen Mark Lewisohn, renowned Beatles scholar and author, told the late Neil Aspinall that he was beginning a three volume biography about The Beatles, Aspinall responded, “Does the world really need another Beatles book?” Yes, Neil, it does, and this is it!\n\nThis first installment of Lewisohn’s trilogy takes us up to the end of 1962, just on the cusp of Beatlemania. In other biographies, this section of the Beatles’ story is glossed over — not here. The book is just over 1100 pages (and there is an extended version of the book but it’s currently only available in print in the UK, what gives? This is the 21st century, where is our global village?). Other biographers, too, make this period of the Beatles’ story somewhat dry — not here. I couldn’t put this book down. I even dreamed about it. That’s normal, right? And other biographers — still, here, now, in 2014 — repeat (or even create) myths and legends that simply are not true — not here. Lewisohn is a scholar. He has source upon source upon source. And as a result, his writing is scholarly but, at the same time, engaging.\n\nLewisohn gives the full facts and truth about so many parts of the Beatles story — how they finally got that coveted recording contract, where those haircuts come from, and yes, not only did Pete Best have zero drumming talent but zero personality. It’s so refreshing (…especially after the headache that was Larry Kane’s When They Were Boys).\n\nSimilarly refreshing is how Lewisohn portrays and discusses the Beatles’ individual faults without making them out to be horrible people. He does not excuse their faults (John and Paul’s early views on women, Paul’s jealousy, John’s strange fixation with cripples, etc.), but he does put them in perspective by putting them in context of their lives and times, allowing some understanding of why they were the way they were.\n\nReading this book, I came away with a greater appreciation of how hard the Beatles worked and similarly how hard the people around them worked — specifically Brian Epstein, bless that man — to make their career happen. I appreciate how certain people, whose lives had run parallel to their own, had to come together with them to make it happen. The Beatles always had the potential to be the greatest, they always had the talent and charisma, and they certainly always had the belief that something would happen…but without certain people and opportunities, it would not have happened, and we would still be listening to Pat Boone records.\n\nOne of the most interesting things I learned was how Decca didn’t necessarily reject the Beatles — well, they kind of did, but they also offered to assist Epstein in getting the Beatles on a record. But Epstein, amazingly (albeit thankfully), refused. Lewisohn explains Epstein’s thinking: “The bottom line seems to have been that Brian couldn’t accept the Beatles’ records being made by someone who didn’t appreciate them and was doing it only for money. In a perfect world they would come under the wing of a man who, like him, could see their potential and was interested in adding his talents to theirs.” That man, of course, was George Martin who was actually forced to sign the Beatles! Oh, what stories are in this book.\n\nI especially love Lewisohn’s thoughts about a recording of the Quarry Men’s evening performance the day Paul met John. Writing of the tape and this early Lennon vocal performance, Lewisohn hits so many things about Lennon (and by extension, the Beatles) that make them so remarkable:\n\n“And this, even more than its highly improbably existence, is the most extraordinary thing about the tape: it is unmistakably John Lennon. Although inspired by Elvis and Lonnie, he’s not attempting to imitate their voices or their style, and more strikingly still he’s not adopting any phoney American or mid-Atlantic accent. Singers always start off as impersonators, mimicking whoever made the record they’re performing, some perhaps going on to develop their own voice. That John Lennon already had it at Woolton, that he was so audibly himself, is the mark of a true original. Not only does he have a great rock voice, it’s an honest one.”\n\nInfluenced, yes, but unmistakable an individual, an original — a natural, honest original, not painstakingly groomed for prime time but just being himself.\n\nI just finished this yesterday, and I am so depressed. I just wanted it to keep…going. It took Lewisohn ten years to research and write this volume, and he hasn’t written the remaining two volumes, and I don’t know if I can sustain the will to live long enough to see them written and released. I hope so.\n\nThis week was filled with so many inspiring events–Blur’s performance at the Brit Awards where they were awarded Outstanding Contribution to Music (and Adele getting her knickers in a twist because her acceptance speech was truncated so that the band could perform–boo freaking hoo), Kentucky kicking butt twice (…why were we down by 13 at halftime against Mississippi State, though? I still don’t understand!), and discovering that I have a new favorite Ricky Nelson song (“String Alooooong”, oh my could that boy sing or what). But today would have been George Harrison’s 69th birthday, and there is nothing so dear to my heart as my Beatles. And I decided to mark the occasion by viewing Martin Scorsese’s documentary about George, Living in the Material World, for the first time.\n\nI had high expectations for this film. I loved The Last Waltz and No Direction Home, and I had no qualms about Scorsese tackling a subject as mysterious and complex as George. I must admit, however, that I was slightly underwhelmed by this film. When asked whether the film revealed anything new to him about his dear friend, Ringo Starr replied in this month’s issue of Mojo: “No…but I knew George really well.”\n\nOf course I could never profess to know George as well as Ringo, but I found myself waiting for something more while watching the film. Everyone you can imagine is interviewed for this film–Harry and Pete Harrison (George’s older brothers), Olivia, Dhani, Paul, Ringo, Yoko, Pattie Boyd, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty, Eric Idle, the late Neil Aspinall, and on and on, but I’m not quite sure why some were interviewed, as they really had nothing to say–for example, Derek Taylor’s wife. You and your husband came to England, met John and George at the airport, and you all had LSD on the car drive to Brian Epstein’s house. And they were really nice to you. Cool. (This is the part where Wayne and Garth are all, “NOT!”) This is not to say that no one had any revealing insights–there were plenty but perhaps there were some that should have ended up on the cutting room floor, as should have the disproportionate amount of time devoted to the George-Pattie-Eric triangle. That was unnecessary and boring, augmented by Pattie Boyd reading from her insipid autobiography.\n\nThe film is sparse with details; there is no voice-over narration to guide you. You are expected to know who Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are without titles (as you should be, let’s be honest); you are expected to know the general details of the Beatles’ story. This allows space for what I think is the film’s greatest strength–the use of rare footage and photographs, many taken by George himself. My single favorite scene in the film is the footage that opens and closes it: George is in one of his many gardens, hiding behind the tall flowers, making faces that are simultaneously somber and playful. That footage, lasting only a handful of seconds, captures so much of George. I enjoyed the film most when Scorsese used footage like this, sometimes interspersed with the music of the Beatles and Harrison, and let it simply speak for itself.\n\nIs there anything you would say to George if he were around today?\n\nDhani Harrison: Were have you been? I had a dream and that was what I said to him in the dream, so I guess that’s what would be the question. Where have you been since I last saw you? And he answered it, so I can tell you the answer as well, which was, “Here, the whole time.”\n\nI loved Ringo’s recollections the most. He recalled how, in their early days of fame, they all stopped somewhere to eat. George was the first one back in the car–behind the wheel, in the driver’s seat. Paul, however, had the keys. And so a stubborn argument ensued. “I have the keys!” “I’ve got the wheel!” They finally left about two hours later. Ringo did not disclose who drove.\n\nHe shared how in the frenzy of Beatlemania, they often had an entire floor of a hotel to themselves. They, however, found themselves meeting in the central location of the bathroom–just to be together.\n\nRingo also shared this aphorism: “The Beatles had one day off a month, and on the day off, Paul would go to a beauty pageant.” Booyah.\n\nPhotograph by Astrid Kirchherr\n\nAstrid Kirchherr shared another one of my favorite anecdotes. The Beatles arrived in Hamburg, only three days after the death of Stuart Sutcliffe, which they were ignorant of until she told them at the airport. Once she took them back to her home, John asked if he could see the place where Stuart used to paint. Once in the room, he was overcome with emotion, and she nudged George to stand behind him as she framed a photograph. George was just barely eighteen, but, she said, he had such a calm and strengthening presence. I love the emotion–and, as a result, the relationship between the two–she captured in that series of photographs.\n\nInterviewer: He [John Lennon] was no angel.\n\nGeorge: He wasn’t. But he was as well.\n\nInterviewer: Was he?\n\nGeorge: Yeah.\n\nOlivia Harrison remarked that there is the saying or teaching that in this life, one must perfect one human relationship in order to truly love God–you practice loving God by loving others, and she felt that one relationship for George was with his music and by extension, the other Beatles and other close friends who were also his musical collaborators. This documentary gave a balanced view of George, showcasing both his faults and successes as a man, but what I took most from this film was what a kind, genuine friend he was to so many.\n\nInterviewer: Are you individually millionaires yet?\n\nJohn: No…\n\nInterviewer: Where does all the money go?\n\nJohn: Well, a lot of it goes to Her Majesty.\n\nGeorge: She’s a millionaire.\n\nThe Beatles actually were the most adorable, endearing, witty, talented, genuine group of people to ever grace this earth. Just thought I’d throw that out there. And it’s kind of scary that there are people who don’t hold them in the highest regard. That really, really scares me.\n\nBack to the film, though.\n\nLiving in the Material World has much to recommend it–home movies from the early days to backstage on the Dark Horse tour to Dhani helping George in the garden to the Traveling Wilburys rehearsing in the kitchen, the warm memories from Ringo, the good and the bad memories from Olivia, including a detailed recollection of the night a man invaded their Friar Park home and stabbed George, Paul’s honesty about George’s contributions to the Beatles music and his own bossiness that stifled George’s creativity at times, Yoko’s generous words, and the inclusion of photographs paired with so many of George’s most beautiful compositions. I’ll probably be listening to All Things Must Pass constantly for the next few days as a result.\n\n“He just lit the room.” –Olivia Harrison on George “leaving” his body\n\nAs he did in life. Happy birthday, dear. Love and miss you always."
