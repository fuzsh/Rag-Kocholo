        "text": "George Harrison, the Beatles' lead guitarist and the youngster of the group, who composed some of their most venerated songs, ranging from the intentionally prosaic to the hauntingly serene, died on Thursday at a friend's home in Los Angeles. He was 58.\n\nThe cause was cancer, which he had been fighting since 1998.\n\nNews of his death saddened fans, who turned out by the hundreds in places of special significance, like Abbey Road in London, the site of the EMI recording studio, and Strawberry Fields in Central Park, planted in memory of John Lennon.\n\nWith a look and a wardrobe that seemed to zigzag along with the vicissitudes of the 1960's, 70's and 80's, Mr. Harrison often took a back seat to the more flamboyant Lennon and Paul McCartney. He was known as the reclusive one, ''the quiet Beatle,'' during the group's manic touring years.\n\nYet he served as an anchor for the quartet, leading the others on a spiritual quest toward Eastern philosophy that influenced their music in the latter part of the 1960's, epitomized for millions of fans by the sitar he played on ''Norwegian Wood.''"
