        "text": "Saturday 25 July\n\nStudio: Abbey Road, Studio Three Engineers: Philip McDonald, ‘JB’\n\nGeorge returns to the studio to start the process of adding overdubs to the BEST choices on the compiled reels, but first he records ‘Apple Scruffs’ – written for the fans who are to be found patiently waiting outside the studio every day. With the band gone, George records with just acoustic guitar and harmonica.\n\n‘I was sitting on a stool that had a metal foot bar on it and so the engineer put a microphone on that, so that’s like the click track is just this banging on that and I had the harmonica track and so that was all done live.’\n\nGeorge\n\nFrom Take 16 onwards a microphone is set up to record Mal Evans tapping his foot, instead of George doing it while playing and singing. They pick Take 18 as the BEST. George decides to play the new track for the ‘scruffs’ who happen to be outside.\n\nThe basic tracking for the All Things Must Pass album is complete with the exception of ‘It’s Johnny’s Birthday’, which is recorded in October.\n\n‘We just said, “We’d better check out where we are,” and we had eighteen tracks. And so we thought, “better just finish them off now,” because the account- ant kept coming down and saying “Are you gonna be much longer here? It’s already cost us forty quid!”’ George\n\nOVERDUBS\n\nMonday 27 July – Monday 12 August\n\nStudio: Abbey Road, Studio Three, Studio Two\n\nEngineers: Philip McDonald, Richard Lush, John Leckie\n\nGeorge spends the first half of August working on the songs in Studio Three at Abbey Road with engineers Phil McDonald and Richard Lush. Spector is present for some but not all of these sessions. George does most of his slide work on the album during overdubs.\n\n‘He created a sound on the slide that I don’t think I’ve heard anybody else have. It was instant recognition. As soon as you heard that sound you knew. He overdubbed the intro on “My Sweet Lord”. He overdubbed a lot of slide because he didn’t play it live during the tracking.’\n\nPhil McDonald\n\nIn order to create enough room to add more instruments and vocals, on Monday 27 July they start the process of transferring the eight-track BEST choices to another eight-track machine, blending tracks together to create more open tracks. Derek & The Dominos and Badfinger are now both off on tour so George brings in Gary Wright or Peter Frampton when help is needed with additional overdubs.\n\n‘About two weeks later, after that week of sessions that I did [on the basic tracking], George called up and said, “Hey Peter, Phil wants more acoustics.” So I said, “You’re kidding me?” He said, “Bring your acoustic.” So, we’re sitting on two stools in front of the glass and there’s Phil sitting in there. George and I are overdubbing first on the tracks that I played on with him and Badfinger and then Phil says, “Well, this is going great. Let’s do more.” George would just shout out the chords right before each take, and off we went.’\n\nPeter Frampton\n\nGeorge works directly with classical pianist and arranger John Barham on creating and recording the orchestral arrangements. Barham became a student of Ravi Shankar in 1966 and worked with George extensively during the making of Wonderwall Music. More recently, Barham has provided the orchestral arrangements for Spector’s production of the Let It Be album. Brass and strings are added towards the end of the overdub session, after Spector’s somewhat hasty departure to the United States upon realising he has overstayed his visa.\n\n‘I did all the preparation at Friar Park just shortly after they moved in. And George was working\n\non an upright piano. And anything George wanted, like a riff or anything like that, he’d just either play it or sing it, and I’d just notate it immediately. I didn’t create any riffs. If there’s anything that stands out as a riff, it’s because George wanted it there.’\n\nJohn Barham\n\nThursday 2 September – Saturday 12 September\n\nStudio: Trident\n\nEngineers: Ken Scott, Dave C.\n\nAbbey Road has been slow to put sixteen-track tape recorders into service but other studios in London are already using them. George moves to Trident Studios in September to transfer the eight-track tapes to sixteen-track, giving him eight new empty tracks to work with. Spector remains in the US and isn’t present for this new round of overdubs.\n\n‘I took ten or eleven of the tracks to try in the studio off Wardour Street, put them onto sixteen-track,\n\n’cos at that time Abbey Road only had eight tracks. And of those tracks, then we overdubbed the ones that turned into the most noisy tracks on the album like, “What Is Life”, “Let It Down” and “Awaiting On You All”, “Wah-Wah”, all those ones that have big noise. So those tracks were done in Trident, mixed in Trident and the others remained as just eight tracks.’\n\nGeorge\n\nEngineer Ken Scott has been a familiar face at Abbey Road since 1964, working on many sessions for The Beatles. In late 1969 he moved over to Trident. George has already worked there on several projects. The Beatles recorded ‘Hey Jude’ there in 1968 when Trident had an early eight-track machine and Abbey Road was still using four-track machines. The Beatles also recorded several songs from The Beatles at Trident including George’s ‘Savoy Truffle’.\n\nGeorge uses the extra tracks to add layers of his own backing vocals, noted as the ‘George Harrison"
