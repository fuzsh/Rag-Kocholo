        "text": "\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">Bob Dylan, Leon Russell, Badfinger and Billy Preston. Classical sitar maestro Ravi Shankar opened proceedings.\n\nHarrison continued to issue records throughout the 1970s but successive releases met with dwindling interest and sales. He formed his own record label, \"Dark Horse Records\" in 1974 and issued a limited number of records by performers such as Splinter, Attitudes and Ravi Shankar. He moved his own output to the label in 1976, once his contract with EMI finished.\n\nImmediately following the murder of his friend and former bandmate John Lennon, Harrison composed a tribute song to Lennon, \"All Those Years Ago,\" which found substantial radio airplay and continues to be a staple of \"classic rock\" radio. But he released no records for five years after Gone Troppo in 1982 was met with apparent indifference. He returned in 1987 with the album Cloud Nine, co-produced with Jeff Lynne and enjoyed a hit (#1 in the U.S.; #2 in the U.K) when his cover version of \"Got My Mind Set On You\" was released as a single. The album got to #8.\n\nDuring the 1980s, he helped form the Traveling Wilburys with Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan, and Tom Petty when they gathered in Dylan's garage to quickly record an additional track for a projected Harrison European single release. The record company realised the track (\"Handle With Care\") was too good for its original purpose and asked for a separate album. This had to be completed inside 2 weeks, as Dylan was scheduled to start a tour.\n\nHe was also involved in film production through his HandMade Films company, providing financial backing for the Monty Python film Life of Brian after the original backers (EMI Films) withdrew because of the supposedly controversial subject matter of the film. Other films produced by HandMade included Mona Lisa, Time Bandits, Shanghai Surprise and Withnail and I.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Harrison, a former smoker, endured an ongoing battle with cancer, having growths removed first from his throat, then his lung. There was also a 1999 attempt on his life by a crazed fan who stabbed him at his home, Friar Park in Henley-on-Thames, puncturing his lung.\n\nHarrison married twice. His first wife was the model, Patti Boyd, for whom Harrison is supposed to have written the song, \"Something\". Following their divorce, Boyd married Eric Clapton (said to have written \"Layla\" for her after their earlier affair). Harrison married for a second time to Olivia Arias, in September 1978. The ceremony took place at their home, with Joe Brown acting as Best Man. They had one son, Dhani Harrison, born the previous month.\n\nGeorge passed away at the home of a friend in Los Angeles, California on Thursday, November 29, 2001, at the age of 58, death being ascribed to a brain tumour. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the River Ganges.\n\nHis final album, Brainwashed was completed by Dhani Harrison and Jeff Lynne and released in November 2002.\n\nOn November 29th, 2002, the first anniversary of his death, the Concert For George saw the two remaining Beatles Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr join many of Harrison's friends for a special memorial concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London that benefitted the Material World Charitable Foundation.\n\nRavi Shankar joined Jeff Lynne in a performance of \"The Inner Light,\" Eric Clapton and Lynne performed \"I Want To Tell You\" and \"Here Comes The Sun,\" Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers (with Jools Holland and Sam Brown) performed \"Taxman\" and \"I Need You,\" Starr performed \"Photograph\", members of Monty Python (Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam) performed \"The Lumberjack Song,\" and McCartney and Starr performed \"For You Blue\".\n\nFor the finale, all of the artists went back on stage to end with \"Something,\" \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" \"My Sweet Lord,\" (with Billy Preston on keyboards), and \"I'll See You In My Dreams\".\n\nHarrison receivied the royal treatment from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, when a star on the fabled walk on April 14, 2009 from the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. His widow, Olivia Harrison, and his son, Dhani, attended the unveiling.\n\nHarrison already shares a Walk of Fame star with all four of the Beatles, but only he and John Lennon, who died in 1980, will have their own stars. Harrison's unveiled in front of Hollywood's Capitol Records building, will be the 2,382nd on the Walk.\n\nHis rockabilly-influence playing gave the Beatles' early recordings their distinctive guitar-driven sound and his voice provided many of the group's most arresting vocal harmonies. His fascination with Eastern music also helped broaden the band's sound on such classic albums as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and The White Album."
