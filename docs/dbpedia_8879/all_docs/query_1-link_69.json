        "text": "ABKCO / Apple Ties End After 4 Yrs\n\nNEW YORK – ABKCO Industries’ management agreement with Apple Corp. Ltd., including Apple Records, has come to an end, effective April 1. The surprise announcement of the expiration of the deal, in effect since 1969, came from ABKCO’s offices in New York and Leslie Perrin Associates in London, the public relations rep for Apple Corps.\n\nIn New York, ABKCO issues a statement that declared that “no agreement was reached as to (ABKCO’s) continued management of Apple Corp.’s Ltd., its subsidiaries, and Messrs. (George) Harrison, (John) Lennon and (Ringo) Starr.” ABKCO, according to its statement, claims it has a right to “continued commissions from revenues accruing out of agreements entered into during the currency of the ABKCO-Apple management agreements.” Also, ABKCO declared that it had terminated its efforts with respect to the possible acquisition of Apple Corps Ltd.\n\nAllen Klein, president of ABKCO, concluded the statement by taking the “opportunity to wish the Apple Group of Companies and Messrs. Harrison, Lennon and Starr continued success.“\n\nFrom London, Leslie Perrin Associates’ said “that for the present Apple Crops will act as managers of these interests in place of ABKCO.” Its statement added that Capitol Records, distributors of the Apple label, will handle the record company’s affairs directly, out of Hollywood. It added that Yoko Ono, wife of John Lennon, and her publishing company, Ono Music, were no longer associated with ABKCO.\n\nThe spokesman for Leslie Perrin stated that Apple Corps Ltd. in England will run its own affairs out of its St James St. offices in London. He said that the Perrin office would handle inquiries directed to Apple Corps Ltd.\n\nStarr Comment\n\nIn another development, Ringo Starr said last week that he saw “hardly any chance” of the Beatles appearing together again. “We are still good pals, but it’s just not on,” he stated.\n\nFrom Cashbox Magazine, April 4, 1973"
