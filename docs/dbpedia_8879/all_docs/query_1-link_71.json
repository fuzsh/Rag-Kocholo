        "text": "Known to millions of fans as \"the quiet Beatle,\" George Harrison's life during and after the Fab Four was anything but retiring. As the singer-songwriter of two of the band's most immortal hits, \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something,\" Harrison's sharp wit and musical chops were unfortunately often overshadowed by the leaders of the band, John Lennon and Paul McCartney. A devoted student of rock 'n' roll and Eastern philosophy, he blended both in his successful solo music career, which yielded such enduring classics as the triple album All Things Must Pass and hit songs like \"My Sweet Lord.\" His later work in film production through his HandMade Films company brought beloved film classics like \"Monty Python's The Life of Brian,\" \"Time Bandits,\" and \"Withnail and I\" to audiences around the world. But mostly, Harrison concentrated on enjoying life with his family and many friends, who counted him as a loving and spiritual individual. When he passed away from cancer in 2001, the world mourned the Baby Beatle and music historians and fans paid tribute to his special genius in a way many felt should have happened in his lifetime."
