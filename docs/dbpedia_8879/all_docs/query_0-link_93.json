        "text": "Does anyone know why George Harrison thought Electronic Sound worthy of a full LP release? John Lennon's indulgent experimental albums of the same time made with Yoko make sense given the all life is art avant garde approach they had at the time, but deeming Electronic Sound ( a lot of which apparently wasn't his own work) worthy of a full release seems a very un - George thing to do. This is the same guy who vetoed 'Carnival Of Light' many years later. Surely there has to be more to this story?\n\nI think he just found something from left field to release on the burgeoning Zapple imprint... Bernie Krause should have gotten some credit though.\n\nI think both Harrison and Lennon liked the concept of Zapple records -- really push the boundaries of just what conceptually could be included on a vinyl LP. Zapple was supposed to be the \"budget\" and \"disposable\" label with a price tag 1 to 2 bucks cheaper than standard LPs.\n\nBoth Lennon's and Harrison's releases set the tone for the label and probably hoped to illustrate to other experimental artists just what they were looking to release on this imprint. The Richard Brautigan LP was supposed to be the third release, but got the ax...\n\nI like the concept of Zapple records in theory, but the Beatles were way in over their heads in regard to business ventures.\n\nIs it really so hard to believe that George just really liked this stuff? He was partially responsible for 'Revolution 9', seems pretty reasonable (to me, anyway) to assume that amongst his Indian records he had a few Stockhausen and Ferrari LPs. Maybe even a Xenakis or two.\n\nIf he'd released a solo album of Beatle-esque songs it might have been seen as an act of mutiny. An Indian soundtrack album and avant-garde electronic music were no threat and would generate less controversy. No one was gonna listen to ES and think \"George is test-marketing a solo career! The Beatles might be over!\"\n\nNot at all, but from all I've read, it seems like the album was made up of 1 side of George playing around on a Moog with little idea what he was doing, with another side of Bernie Krause (uncredited) demonstrating the Moog for George. Hardly seems like material that someone like George would be proud of, or want to put their name to on a full blown release. The idea that it was a tester release to show prospective Zapple artists they kind of stuff that the label was intended for kind of makes sense, but if that's so, why not release a proper album by Bernie Krause instead?\n\nI actually wish George's LP was filled with \"Electronic Music\" --- It definitely is just \"electronic sound.\"\n\nOne side, \"Under the Mersey Wall\" (? -- the side without Bernie Krause) sounds like Harrison just going through the manual for a Moog synthesizer and twiddling things... and then overdubbing a second track on top of that.\n\nI think the side with Bernie Krause has the more interesting aural components, as it were.\n\nNo different that John's 'Radio Play', really. Or even some of the Christmas records. After being taken too seriously for too long, they all probably felt the need for some silliness.\n\nRight?! I can't figure that out either... Was Krause signed to another label? It's even stranger that George included Krause's name on the front cover, and then put silver paint over it!\n\nThis site (at the bottom) has an interesting excerpt from Krause talking about working with Harrison:\n\nhttp://astronautapinguim.blogspot.com/2012/12/five-questions-to-bernie-krause.html\n\nIt's just as many have mentioned earlier- and just because he could- he was taking advantage of the newly launched Zapple subsidiary of Apple Records.\n\nThe Lennon / Ono experiments do nothing for me- and being a fan of the Moog synthesizer- I find \"Electronic Sound\" a fascinating listen (when I am in the right mood) and love that Harrison snuck a few snippets into 1970's \"Apple Jam\". The LP even charted for one week (#191) which is more than can be said about many albums we all think deserved better fates. Oh, and yes, I absolutely love the album artwork. The colors are amazing.\n\nAccording to an article I read not too long ago...sorry don't have the link handy...Bernie believes he should have received all the credit.\n\nHe was very bitter toward George about the whole experience, too. (One of the few negative personal opinions of George I've read, in fact.)\n\nY'know, this thread has actually got me reading inerviews that I had never read previously.\n\nFrom Bernie Krause:\n\n\"The album, \"Electronic Music,\" by George Harrison, was released some months later. But not before I had it recalled and ordered my name taken off the cover. I didn't have the money or juice to sue him. The proper retribution would have to wait for someone more courageous and less intimidated by Harrison's tendencies to copy – like the person who wrote \"My Sweet Lord\" and chased George down until the matter was settled in court favoring the claimant and penalizing Harrison with a hefty copyright infringement fine. Rather then reprinting the album cover, Apple simply had my name silvered over. If you can find one of the old issues of the album, hold it in the right light and you can still faintly see my name – spelled incorrectly, of course. Although I did get credit on the inside jacket, along with his cats, I never did receive a single 'quid.' Also, the (expletive deleted) never did invite me back to his house so I could show him my \"I'm-as-humble-as-Ravi-Shankar\" routine that I've been practicing ever since.\"\n\nWow."
