        "text": "New from the Pear label, two new George Harrison and Paul McCartney compilation releases.\n\nThe George set is two disks of rarities featuring tracks from the beginning to the end of the Quiet one’s solo career – Featuring tracks that go from the Sgt. Peppers to the ATMP album and tracks that go right in to the 80’s. The most curious track on here being ‘Doing The Bonzo Dog’, which the label claim is unreleased.\n\nThe Paul set is similarly packed with rarities and oddities behind the cute ones career including film soundtracks, rehearsals, early versions and previously exclusive internet downloads."
