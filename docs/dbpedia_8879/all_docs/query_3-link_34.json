        "text": "I think it was John Lennon who once described George as the “invisible singer” in The Beatles, meaning (I think) that he was invariably overshadowed by the vocal prowess of John and Paul during their time together. It’s sometimes difficult to tell with John whether comments like that were intended as a compliment, backhanded or otherwise, but it is undeniable that George’s singing is rarely highlighted as one of the band’s prime assets. He probably gets the most credit for his harmonies, particularly his contributions to three-part masterpieces like ‘This Boy’ and ‘Because’, and his backing combinations with either John or Paul while the other handled lead vocal duties on countless tracks. As the first volume of Mark Lewison’s All These Years biography makes clear, the sheer joy of singing together was one of the drivers of the trio’s early years together in Liverpool, and it remained central to The Beatles’ sound – perhaps the defining aspect – until their split (and the McCartney/Harrison harmonies remained as sweet as ever on the Threetles reunion songs of the 1990s). But George as a lead vocalist? It rarely warrants a mention, even though he has pole position on some of their most popular songs.\n\nLet’s be honest about this – George didn’t have the range or power that John and Paul could bring to the table. He lacked the searing Scouse rawness and heartbreaking vulnerability that was Lennon’s stock in trade, while he could never match Paul’s frightening ability to switch from soothing, crooning caresses to primal rock ferocity (and everything in between) from one song to another. He couldn’t leap into a daring, high-wire falsetto with the ease they both could, and you almost never heard him tear through a rocker, bellowing screams and all, with the dizzying sense of abandon they routinely delivered. But then, who could match them? Comparing him unfavourably to two of the greatest rock singers who have ever drawn breath obscures the fact that he was a fine vocalist in his own right, one who developed over the course of their career and carved out his own distinctive style which added yet another layer, another flavour to the richness of the band’s output. As with his songwriting, being in the shadow of Lennon and McCartney meant that Harrison’s talents didn’t always get their due; while he undoubtedly learned a great deal from them and benefited from his close association with them, you could also make a compelling argument that, had he been in any other band, he would have been hailed as a majro creative force in his own right – and a more than decent lead singer.\n\nFor all the claims of John and Paul’s condescension towards George, they clearly rated him as a singer from the off, as lead vocal duties were shared out pretty equally between the three of them during their early years as a performing band. Indeed, during the 1962 Decca Records audition – which was their first bid at securing the all-important recording contract – Harrison actually sang as many songs as Lennon. It was only when the EMI deal was secured later that year and the Lennon/McCartney songwriting partnership kicked into high gear, that George’s front man duties began to be scaled back. Nonetheless, he remains a potent vocal presence on their earliest recordings (including their Decca, Star Club and BBC material), and his often husky, unpolished tones brought an intriguing range of timbres to their repertoire. He could be playful (leading the band through jokey tunes like ‘Three Cool Cats’ and ‘Sheik of Araby’), plaintive (‘Crying, Waiting, Hoping’) lascivious (‘Ain’t Nothing Shakin’’) and earnest, taking the role of enthusiastic kid brother (‘Take Good Care of My Baby’, ‘Roll Over Beethoven’).\n\nBut it was when his songwriting started to blossom in the mid 1960s that he perhaps found his true voice. There were hints of it on his compositional debut, 1963’s ‘Don’t Bother Me’, but it was on tracks like Rubber Soul’s ‘Think For Yourself’ (1965), ‘Taxman’ and ‘Love You To’ (both from Revolver, 1966) that a certain sourness, dourness, even bitterness began to colour his singing. And, as Indian music and spirituality dominated his musical horizons in 1967 (most notably on Sgt Pepper’s ‘Within You, Without You’), he found the other quality which characterised many of his late-era Beatles vocals – an airy sense of yearning. These styles contrasted beautifully with the in-your-face, emotionally-charged approach of Lennon, and the mixture of sweet and rowdy served up by McCartney, adding still more texture and scope to their sound. By the time of Abbey Road in 1969, his vocals were every bit as important to the magical alchemy as his bandmates’. Maybe he couldn’t deliver the pyrotechnics that Paul did on ‘Oh! Darling’ or John brought to ‘I Want You (She’s So Heavy)’, but it didn’t matter; his warm, nuanced singing on ‘Something’ and ‘Here Comes The Sun’ was perfect, and helped make them the two most popular songs on the album.\n\nAnyway, there are great Harrison vocal performances throughout The Beatles’ catalogue, and I’ve picked my ten favourites below – listed chronologically rather than ranked in order of preference. After all, what was required for a Carl Perkins cover in the Cavern is completely different to the needs of an epic raga-rock composition within the confines of Abbey Road, so it seems pointless to compare them on that level. This list is all about (dark) horses for courses, the way his vocal interprets and elevates songs throughout the band’s career. It’s only right to point out that George receives fantastic support for John and (especially) Paul on many of these tracks, but that shouldn’t detract from what a fine job he does on the lead microphone. It’s time to bring “the invisible singer” out of the shadows and into the spotlight.\n\n1. Three Cool Cats (The Decca audition, 1962 – released on The Beatles Anthology Vol.1, 1995)\n\nCompared with the sometimes tentative John and occasionally hammy Paul, George’s vocals were natural and unaffected through the audition for Decca Records on New Year’s Day 1962, and none more so than on this romp through a 1958 track by The Coasters. Harrison tended to take the lead on their more light-hearted numbers, playing the straight man while Lennon and McCartney goofed around in the middle section, but he really steals the show here. One of his more raucous performances, he brings a real swagger to the perfectly-tailored tale of three cocky, hormone-driven friends checking out the female talent (particularly on the lines “man, do you see what I see?”) before being brought down to earth with an ego-bruising bump – captured perfectly in the bewildered yelp he injects into the pay-off lyric: “Three cool chicks made three fools of/these three cool cats”. George negotiates the Americana candy bars and potato chips of the lyric with just the right degree of rock ‘n’ roll attitude, his singing even more impressive when you consider he was playing some tricksy guitar licks at the same time, and was just 18 years old when they cut the song.\n\n2. Glad All Over (Live at the BBC, 1963 – released 1994)\n\nGeorge is in similarly lustful mood on this cover of a 1957 tune by his hero, Carl Perkins. One of his most assured vocals from the early Fabs period, it also shows his versatility – switching from the rockabilly drawl of the early verses to the lilting coyness of the middle section (“your touch goes through me like electric wire….never thought I’d make love”), before ramping up the raunch when the object of his desire pushes one button too many: “My temperature’s low, my fever is high/ I can’t speak, I’m too weak!” As the song progresses, he lets his ardour run free, peppering the lyrics with pleading high notes, and even allowing himself a chuckle at his frustrated predicament (“hot-dang-gilly it’s silly, but I’m glad all over”). He sounds like he’s having a ball thoughout, and the frenzied “yeahhhhh!” he delivers before his guitar solo is perhaps the nearest he ever gets to one of those trademark screams John and Paul regularly yelled out to herald the instrumental break on their rock stompers.\n\n3. Devil in Her Heart (With The Beatles, 1963)\n\nBy contrast, George is the trusting, lovestruck kid brother in this track, intent on following his heart (rather than just his groin) and pushing back against the warnings of his older and wiser bandmates. And he plays the role to perfection, delivering a sweet, winsome vocal that tugs at the heartstrings – especially on the lines “I can’t believe that she’ll ever, ever go/Not when she hurts me and says she loves me so.” He nails the brash devotion and certainty of someone young, in love and unwilling to even conceive that he’s being played – at least until the song’s final moments, when the sureness ebbs away from his voice and he clings to the line “No, she’s an angel sent to me” more out of hope and desperation than belief, his denial now sounding utterly hollow. It’s a wonderfully tender, vulnerable delivery. While John and Paul’s strident call-and-response backing vocals throughout the song deserve kudos, Harrison does the real heavy lifting here (and his chiming, delicate guitar phrasing isn’t bad either). George has three fine lead vocal spotlights on With The Beatles, and also features prominently on ‘You Really Got A Hold On Me’, but this one is the stand-out.\n\n4. Think For Yourself (Rubber Soul, 1965)\n\nWhile there is no such thing as a weak song on Rubber Soul, this is one of my least favourites on the album – if only because almost everything else around it is so damn good. However, I’ve chosen it for this list because it marks the point where George’s singing takes on more of an edge, where he starts developing a distinct vocal identity all his own (in line with his evolving songwriting). While the tune again showcases the awesome Lennon/McCartney/Harrison harmonies, George’s solo lines have real bite and intent. By turns, he sounds angry, sarcastic and knowing, yet there’s also a sad resignation mixed in there (especially on the chorus). There’s a new texture in his voice, a little more maturity (amazing, bearing in mind he was just 22 at the time). This vocal style echoed through later tracks like ‘Taxman’ and ‘Piggies’, and sporadically through his solo material, and whoever he is singing to here, it’s the sharpest, most brutal of kiss-offs. Listening to this, you wouldn’t want to get on George’s bad side.\n\n5. I Want to Tell You (Revolver, 1966)\n\nThe same abrasive, jabbing tone is employed on two of his Revolver compositions — ‘Taxman’ and ‘Love You To’ – but on this, the third, his singing is quite different. His delivery of the questioning, sophisticated lyric manages to be simultaneously laid back and full of yearning. The way he stretches out the word “tell” is brilliant, emphasising the inadequacy of words to express all the things he’s feeling, but there’s an unblinking honesty and directness throughout the song. The three-part harmonies which punctuate the track add extra intensity, but the real killer moment is delivered by George alone, imbuing the lines “Sometimes I wish I knew you well/Then I could speak my mind and tell you/…Maybe you’d understand” with a stark vulnerability and intimacy you rarely hear in pop music, even today. For those lines alone, it’s one of my favourite Harrison vocal performances.\n\n6. It’s All Too Much (Yellow Submarine, 1967)\n\nThis psychedlic tour de force, released in early 1969 but recorded in 1967 (hence its position in this list), features one of George’s most playful lead vocals. While the lyric is as heavy as other ones he was writing around this time (such as ‘Within You, Without You’), it’s sung with more lightness of touch — like the “stream of time” he refers to, his voice floats above the thunderous musical backing, riding waves of energy which carry it in and out of a high register he hadn’t explored much up to this point. He has fun pulling and pushing the snaking “ee” rhymes which run through the verses – you can almost picture him grinning when he gets to the big pay-off line of “Show me that I’m everywhere/And get me home for tea” – and belts out the chorus with confidence and surety, perfectly mirroring the exuberance of the music. He’s so relaxed and in command of the mic, he even casually slips in a line from The Merseys’ 1966 hit ‘Sorrow’ (“With your long blonde hair/And your eyes of blue”) before straying into decidedly weird territory with the phrase “We are dead”, like a fragment from a forgotten mantra. Epic stuff.\n\n7. While My Guitar Gently Weeps (The Beatles, 1968)\n\nHarrison’s stock as a songwriter was now beginning to soar and on this, one of his trademark compositions, he supplies a towering vocal to match. Right from the opening line, he sounds assured, graceful, noble even; this is pure, unfiltered George, singing straight from his heart. In keeping with the lyric, his voice is shot through with melancholy, a sense of loss and of waste, none more so than on the stirring, forlorn middle sections (“I don’t know why…”). While Lennon was generally playing less of a role in Harrisongs by this stage, McCartney – contrary to some of George’s grumbles in later years – was always fully engaged, and he supports his bandmate’s vocal beautifully here, especially on the falsetto “we-e-ps” which closes the main part of the track. But it’s Harrison’s show, even in the extended fade-out when his wordless wailing tracks the lead guitar before erupting into a series of defiant “yeah”s near the end, his constrained emotion bursting out and railing against the madness of the world around him. It’s all shivers-down-the-spine stuff and, for me, is George’s best Beatles vocal of all.\n\n8. Long, Long, Long (The Beatles, 1968)\n\nThere are echoes of ‘Gently Weeps’ in his singing on this track, though the subject focuses on personal angst than on missed opportunities for humanity as a whole. While the song itself is a little ponderous at times, George’s singing – achingly gentle, naked and ethereal – sells it completely. It captures some of the fragile peace he always said he was searching for, weaving a quiet, meditative spell which makes the burst of energy and emotion in the middle section (“So many tears, I was searching…”) all the more powerful. He allows every word space to breathe, and the precision and weight he gives to lines like “how I…want you” make them sound like parts of a hushed prayer. And his delivery of the line “You know that I need you” near the end is full of, well, longing. He even tops it all off with a protracted raga-style howl at the tune’s screeching climax. Very underrated.\n\n9. Something (Abbey Road, 1969)\n\nJust about every component of this song is perfect but, in my book, George’s singing doesn’t get the credit it deserves. It’s elegant, silky and sensual, bringing the lyric to life with total conviction and feeling. The way he phrases “Something in her style that shows me”, for example, reduces me to goo whenever I hear it. It’s understated, yet supremely intense at the same time. And he rolls out a powerhouse vocal (backed by Paul, again) for the magnificent middle section, his voice soaring into the stratosphere while the lyrics ground the song in everyday reality and uncertainty. By the time he sings “You know I believe and how” for the final time, he’s conveying the same sense of devotion as in any of his overtly-spiritual homages. While vocal giants like Frank Sinatra and Shirley Bassey have been among the many artists who have covered this tune, the words never sound as stylish, meaningful or as convincing as when sung by George himself.\n\n10. I Me Mine (Let It Be, 1970)\n\nThe last Beatles lead vocal laid down by any of the band, in January 1970, is one of the best. George’s voice starts off slightly nasal and measured on the opening verse, but builds as the song progresses. Joining McCartney on the raucous, repetitive chorus seems to unleash a torrent of emotion when he returns for the second verse, delivering a heart-wrenching vocal which cranks up the inherent drama of the song. The way he sings “Even those tears” is filled with sadness, regret and anger, once more – as in ‘While My Guitar Gently Weeps’ – despairing at the world around him. It’s one of his most passionate, haunting performances, building to a crescendo (“Flowing more freely than wine”) before ending on a note of unresolved resignation, almost desolation. Another reminder, if anyone paying attention needed it by this point, that The Beatles had not two, but three great lead singers.\n\nWith the advent of the internet over the past 25 years, sales of print publications – much like CDs – have taken a sizeable hit, and music magazines have been no exception. As well as cutting back on pages and reducing in size, one way publishers have propped up flagging circulations is to start producing special editions (or ‘bookazines’ as they’re sometimes known) focusing on popular acts or genres, tempting pop/rock fans with whole issues dedicated to their fave raves at a cheaper cost than they’d have to pay for a book. Uncut magazine’s long-running ‘Ultimate Music Guides’ are probably the best-known, most successful example but everyone – from MOJO to Rolling Stone – has gotten in on the act, to the extent that newsagent shelves are usually clogged with issues focusing on some superstar act or other. Judging by their frequent appearances on such shelves, it seems nothing sells more than The Beatles, either collectively or individually. And back in those carefree days of 2019, the UK’s Record Collector joined the party with not one, not two, but three special issues dedicated to the entire group career of the Fab Four, as well as the band’s burgeoning afterlife.\n\nYou can’t really begrudge Record Collector the chance to grab a piece of the action. After all, the magazine was born out of The Beatles Book monthly back in 1979, and the Fabs have probably featured more in its pages than any other act in the years since (I don’t know if it still runs, but The Beatles always used to top its annual ‘most collectable artist’ readers poll). That said, I’ve rarely bought the regular magazine over the last 20 years, partly because I felt it had run out of worthwhile, fresh Fabs content, partly because other acts it tended to feature didn’t really interest me, and partly because the whole ‘collectable’ aspect of buying music (such as the fascination with picking up identical records with differing catalogue numbers or alternative label colours) never really appealed to me in the first place. Moreover, I didn’t feel the writing was generally up to the standard of other mainstream music mags, and it rarely snagged interviews with the big names. Its mini-series of Beatles specials does suffer a little from those problems, and there’s not always that much in the way of new information or intriguing insights but, overall, the content is solidly entertaining – and some of it is very good indeed.\n\nThe series takes a strict chronological approach. Vol 1: Evolution (1940-1964) covers the band members’ formative years, their adventures in Hamburg and the Cavern, their early releases, the outbreak of Beatlemania and the subsequent conquering of the USA, and their feature film debut; Vol 2: Revolution (1965-67), ahem, trips into the psychedelic era, charting the end of their touring career, their increasingly wacky celluloid ventures, the controversies which engulfed them in 1966 and the drug-fuelled musical experimentation which rewrote the pop music rule book, and Vol 3: Ascension (1968-2019) tracks the gradual disintegration of the band, the dawn of their solo careers and how their legacy has not only survived but flourished in the decades since the split. It covers almost all the main plot points, as it were, of the Beatles story, plus a few sideshows which don’t always get much coverage in other tellings (more of which later), through a mixture of archive features from the magazine’s past and new, specially-commissioned articles from a team of Fabs-loving staff writers and a sprinkling of noteworthy guest contributors. There is a clutch of interviews with Beatle people, reviews of all the group’s singles, standalone EPs and albums (including all the compilations and archive releases from the 1970s onwards), some personal fan perspectives from across the generations and a healthy helping of great photographs, some familiar and some less so. Plus the prices their original releases were selling for in 2019, if you’re into that sort of thing.\n\nCoverage of the most famous chapters in their career hits all the right notes, but doesn’t always play them in an exciting fashion. Articles on Hamburg, the departures of Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best and the arrival of Brian Epstein, the assault on the US, the impact of pharmaceutical stimulants, their short-lived Apple business empire and John and Yoko’s 1969 peace campaigns are fairly routine stuff for anyone familiar with the course of events. And the piece on the Let It Be sessions really suffers (like so much Beatle literature written before 2021) from the handicap of coming out before Peter Jackson’s Get Back documentary, which has cast such a different light on the band’s so-called ‘winter of discontent’. That said, the pieces spanning 1966 are excellent. The tangled history of the ill-fated ‘butcher cover’ which initially adorned the US-only Yesterday…and Today album is very well presented and dissected, while I also learned more about exactly how John’s innocuous “bigger than Jesus” comments ultimately led to such a hysterical reaction in some of the southern US states. And David Stubbs’ article about The Beatles’ place in the burgeoning counter-culture and rapidly-evolving rock scene makes for a very fine, thoughtful read.\n\nThe interviews, all lifted from the Record Collector archives, benefit from not being a parade of recycled views from the usual suspects. There are chats with people you don’t often hear from in mainstream Beatles accounts, such as Cavern Club DJ Bob Wooler and Hamburg photographer/confidante Jürgen Vollmer, who offers some great first-hand insights into the band’s early days (“John looked like a young Brando, very macho and butch”). Even reminiscences from regular interviewees Pattie Boyd and George Martin throw up the occasional juicy nugget (the producer thought George Harrison’s initial Sgt Pepper contribution ‘Only An Northern Song’ was “awful. He was very upset about that.”) and are engaging to read. Only the talk with Liverpool pal and later Apple employee Tony Bramwell is dispensible; for someone apparently so close to the group over such a long period, he has little to say that you won’t have heard anywhere else – Brian Epstein was “fucking wonderful”, George Martin “had the knowledge to make a great record”, the 1966 world tour was “pretty awful” and so on. And he didn’t like Yoko (though he doesn’t elaborate as to why).\n\nThe record reviews are a mixed bag. Some are slightly hamstrung by the author’s need to give them some historical context (such as Nick Hasted’s piece on Sgt Pepper) and others by the reviewer’s personal prejudices (Hasted, again, is curiously dismissive of both ‘Paperback Writer’ and ‘Lady Madonna’, strangely concluding that Paul “didn’t mean a word” of the latter). The worst offender is probably the article on Revolver, where David Stubbs skips even mentioning some of its tracks but spends an unhealthy amount of time moaning about how ‘Taxman’ wasn’t more sympathtic to the then-Labour Government’s “progressive” approach to taxation. A few of the critiques, such Kris Needs’ take on ‘Get Back’ and Paul Moody’s look at ‘Can’t Buy Me Love’, are pretty forgettable, while Lois Wilson’s thoughts on Let It Be are sadly truncated to make way for a review of 2003’s Let It Be…Naked. Having said all that, there are more than enough great articles to make up for it. Stalwart British rock journalists David Hepworth and David Quantick contribute stellar pieces on ‘She Loves You’ and the first four Beatle solo albums, respectively – the former bringing the heady days of 1963 vividly to life, and the latter expertly articulating how good the Fabs remained even when they went their separate ways (yes, Ringo’s Sentimental Journey included). Nick Hasted does come up trumps with a fine assessment of the qualities Please Please Me had in abundance, Max Bell – a young fan as the records were coming out – writes evocatively about the impact of With The Beatles and Rubber Soul, while the sprawling splendour of the White Album is well captured by Jonathan Wingate and Jamie Atkins. Best of all, though, is a stunning examination of ‘Strawberry Fields Forever’ and ‘Penny Lane’ by Paul Fitzgerald, and three outstanding articles on ‘Ticket to Ride’/’Yes It Is’, ‘A Day in the Life’ and the Abbey Road album by veteran writer Chris Roberts (who also pens a brilliant piece on the A Hard Day’s Night movie). These pieces feature rock writing as good as you will find anywhere and do justice to the magical music they strive to analyse; the magazines are worth getting for this content alone.\n\nThe series also shines when it takes interesting detours to relatively obscure corners of the Fabs’ story, or look at aspects of it from a different perspective. Paul Fitzgerald, for example, pens a couple of excellent pieces on the crucial role that the environs of post-war Liverpool and, later, 1960s London had in shaping the band’s development; Richie Unterberger takes a deep dive into recordings of their 1965 and ’66 tours in an attempt to gauge how good they were as a live band as Beatlemania took its toll, and pen portraits of Cynthia, Patti, Maureen and Jane Asher consider how being a Beatle bride/girlfriend wasn’t always all it was cracked up to be. There are also light-hearted surveys of the novelty records singing the praises of The Beatles (and, in the US, of Ringo in particular) which bombarded an unsuspecting public in 1963/64, an appraisal of the potent black music influences on the group, a look at their Christmas fan club flexi-discs and even a feature on how the White Album allegedly “inspired” the notorious Charles Manson-directed murder spree which rocked Hollywood in 1969. Also worth mentioning is a delightful first-person account of The Beatles’ 1964/65 Christmas show by Max Bell, who was a callow but mesmerised nine-year-old at the time (alas, he lets himself down in volume three with a sloppy, poorly-written piece on the band’s break-up which spends more time discussing the ‘Hey Bulldog’ recording session and Paul’s sex life than the subject at hand).\n\nAnother real plus point is that volume 3 doesn’t end with the group’s split, but – while largely ignoring their solo careers – dives into the management of their collective legacy after 1970. So we get in-depth articles on the ‘Red’ and ‘Blue’ albums, together with the sometimes random compilations which followed in their wake during the 1970s and ‘80s, before Apple and EMI made friends and successfully ushered in the more considered, modern era of Beatles releases with Live at the BBC in 1994. Best of all is a really well-written exploration of the Anthology albums by Jamie Atkins and a short, but very sweet, review of reunion single ‘Free as a Bird’ by Nick Hasted. Assessments of the modern-day standings of Paul and Ringo are more disposable, but the series ends on a charming high as five of its writers – each born in a different decade – recount how they discovered and fell in love with the Fabs, name their favourite Beatle (George does very well here) and most essential record, and choose one thing about the group they would change. I love stuff like this, a chance to share in others’ fanaticism, and particularly related to the memories of Lois Wilson (who even grew up in the same area as me) about following The Beatles amid the very different musical landscape of the 1980s.\n\nOverall, there’s much to enjoy across these magazines. Yes, there are flaws – as I’ve touched upon, some of the writing is a little self-indulgent, and I could happily live without articles on original Parlophone label bags and the like. It’s also curious how the Fabs’ 1968 visit to India, such a key moment in their history, is effectively omitted from the story, while the White Album – the record it spawned – receives acres of coverage and analysis (it’s clearly the favourite LP of the magazines’ creators, garnering far more pages than any of their other efforts). And some at least cursory overviews of their individual solo careers would have been nice; the deaths of John and George, for instance, barely warrant a mention, which jars somewhat. But as a romp through their endlessly-entrancing group story and peerless musical output, this mini-series more than does the job. If you’re a newcomer, it’s as good an introduction to the band as most books on the group, and for more seasoned fans it revisits familiar tales with humour, vitality and an abiding sense of love, while also ploughing some forgotten fields of Beatles lore. The issues are also beautifully put together, and are still available to order from the Record Collector website. Definitely worth getting hold of.\n\nAmid all the hullabaloo surrounding the release of ‘Now and Then’ in November, the major facelift and expansion of the definitive Beatles compilations which followed in its wake seemed something of a footnote. The Red and Blue albums – or 1962-66 and 1967-70, to give them their official titles – were overhauled and freshened up to cash in on the tidal wave of publicity accompanying “the final Beatles song” and also, handily, the 50th anniversary of their original release. This saw the addition of a whopping 21 tracks to the albums’ already-hefty 54-song running order, plus remixes of their entire contents. Some of these were already available through the various deluxe album reissues which have come out since 2017, but many – particularly from the 1962-65 period – were brand new, taking advantage of the groundbreaking MAL technology developed for Peter Jackson’s 2021 Get Back documentary to separate all the instruments and vocals baked into the band’s early recordings, for the first time. All of this, we were told, would make the collections much more attractive and interesting to today’s young audiences listening to music via streaming platforms on their phones, and encourage them to dig deeper into The Beatles’ wider catalogue. But, in this instance, is more really more?\n\nAs I’ve written before, even though the Red and Blue albums came out after the band’s demise and were effectively a money-making mechanism devised by erstwhile Apple supremo Allen Klein, I’m in full agreement with all those who see them as a key part of The Beatles catalogue, a near-perfect collection of highlights spanning their entire recording career. An ideal introduction for anyone who wants to know what all the fuss was about, beautifully packaged and sequenced, a potted history which – once digested – just makes you yearn to hear more. A gateway to this most wondrous of musical journeys which, for hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of us, triggered lifelong devotion and listening pleasure. One that has introduced generation after generation to the band over half a century. That being the case, I’m not sure it was wise to tamper with it to this extent – a bit like adding extra colours to the Mona Lisa, or those notorious extra scenes and effects worked into the various re-releases of the original Star Wars trilogy. I’m not sure much of it was needed, and some aspects might even be slightly counter-productive.\n\nI should say I completely understand Apple’s desire to monetise/maximise the release of ‘Now and Then’. Even by Beatles standards, this level of publicity doesn’t come along very often, and just releasing a new single wouldn’t yield much in the way of financial returns or sustained, reinvigorated interest in the band’s full body of work. It was a golden opportunity and had to be attached to something, to lead people back to the wider catalogue, offering something for newcomers, casual fans and hardcore Fabs junkies alike. We now know that ‘N&T’ was originally scheduled to come out in the autumn of 2022, marking the 60th anniversary of their first single with the release of their last. At that point, Apple was considering the creation of a brand new compilation to go with it, largely based on the most popular Fabs tracks in the streaming sphere (where ‘Here Comes The Sun’ reigns supreme, for example). But, as ongoing work to improve the quality of John’s vocal delayed the single’s release, this plan was dropped for some reason, and the Red and Blue anniversary subsequently loomed into view instead. Voilà, Apple bosses must have thought to themselves, problem solved!\n\nBut was it? Expediency and marketing symmetry aside, I think sticking ‘N&T’ on the end of the Blue album was a clumsy and ill-conceived idea. For a start, call me a stickler for accuracy but the clue is in the title – it’s 1967-70, not 1967-2023. Moreover, while I’m definitely not one of those people who disputes its claim to being a fully-fledged Beatles song, adding it here jars with the original, natural running order of the two collections, which starts with the band’s first single ‘Love Me Do’ and ends with the last, the suitably elegaic ‘The Long and Winding Road’ (though I always sequence the tracklist to end with ‘Let It Be’, which I think works as an even better closer). Adding ‘N&T’, good as it is, makes for a less satisfying listening experience. It could have worked IF they had included ‘Free as a Bird ‘ and ‘Real Love’ as well, giving the full picture of the band’s reunion coda. And, as they are hit singles in their own right otherwise unavailable on any Fabs compilation beyond the increasingly forgotten Anthology CDs, they should’ve been on any expanded version of these albums anyway….except that brings us back to the whole 1962-70 parameter conundrum we came in on.\n\nAnd what of the 20(!) 1960s-era songs Apple added to running order? To begin with, I really don’t see the logic of adding so many more tracks. While producer and remixer-in-chief Giles Martin claims this will be “just the start” for many new listeners, encouraging them to seek out the entire catalogue, I wonder if the end result for many will be just the opposite – after all, 75 tracks of anyone’s music will be more than enough for lots of people, especially in the streaming age when you can flit from track to track and, indeed, act to act at the flick of a finger. Or rely on curated (or shuffled) playlists which will trawl a band’s whole recorded canon for you, dispensing with the whole concept of a limited compilation. The genius of the original Red and Blue selections was that, while they gave you all the hits and a host of universally-known songs which encompassed all their albums, providing such a thrilling start-to-finish listen, they never felt like the full stop that many greatest hits compendiums do. The music was so great – and, equally as important, so varied – that it just served to whet the appetite for further exploration. Even classic numbers that were omitted served to underline this fact. If something like ‘I Saw Her Standing There’ didn’t make the cut, for example, it made you realise the wealth of riches at The Beatles’ disposal. To me, throwing in a load of extra tunes at this stage of the game just serves to dilute that effect.\n\nAnd then there is the problem of choosing the additional tracks, which was doomed to dismay as many people as it satisfied – as evidenced by the numerous ‘I can’t believe xxxx was/wasn’t included’ howls of outrage which greeted the new tracklistings on social media. For me, once you move past the inarguable criteria of singles and beloved album tracks, stocking a ‘best of’ is always a murky, arbitrary and ultimately flawed exercise, and so it proved in this case. Okay, ‘I Saw Her Standing There’, ‘Twist and Shout’ and ‘Blackbird’ are no-brainers, ridiculously famous tunes that should unquestionably have made it first time around. But while I think ‘You Can’t Do That’ is one of their greatest mop-top era songs, I can make no objective case for its inclusion here. Likewise, is ‘Glass Onion’ really a better track than White Album Lennon stablemates ‘I’m So Tired’ or ‘Sexy Sadie’? And, if so, by whose judgement? Or does ‘Oh Darling’ really warrant a place above ‘You Never Give Me Your Money’s, or ‘I Want You’ as a similarly stronger representative of Abbey Road than ‘Because’? Not in my book. And while it has lots of hip world music cachet these days, ‘Within You, Without You’ cannot lay claim to anywhere near the same level of recognition and broader popularity as ‘When I’m 64’ – yet it’s the former which bags a place here.\n\nOf course, the last example is part of the key rationale running through the new-look set, that of Beatles politics and a rough parity of esteem between the three writers – with George (and the Harrison estate) getting a much larger share of the cake in the process. While this may be very fair and worthy, it doesn’t really make any sense in the context of these records. I’ve seen people exclaim their astonishment that George didn’t get any songs on the original Red album, but the fact of the matter is that of the 116 songs the Fabs put out in their first four years, he wrote just eight of them. And, as much as I love something like ‘I Need You’, for example, he didn’t really start matching the very best Lennon/McCartney numbers until the Revolver period. With half the numbers recorded during the Rubber Soul sessions already included, did we really need ‘If I Needed Someone’ as well? And while I bow to no one in my admiration of ‘I Me Mine’, does it have the mass appeal of ‘Two of Us’ or ‘I’ve Got A Feeling’ from the same Let It Be album? Such additions smack of tokenism, pure and simple, to ensure Olivia and Dhani’s sign-off on the project.\n\nAs for the remixes, well, you pays your money and you takes your choice. As I’ve posted before, while I can understand the rationale, I’m not a huge fan of Giles Martin’s efforts with The Beatles’ catalogue (for the most part) – the sound is undoubtedly enhanced, which is great, but moving instruments and vocals around to the extent he does just jars for me. That said, his work on the early material here (unlocking the original basic two-track and four-track recordings) really produces dividends, giving the uptempo numbers in particular a lot more punch. Some tracks sound great, like ‘From Me To You’, ‘I Feel Fine’ and ‘You Can’t Do That’. And I picked out things in ‘Day Tripper’ I’d never heard before. But, again, some of his remixing choices baffle me, like shoving the solo in ‘I Saw Her Standing There’ on one channel. Likewise, putting Paul’s guitar on ‘Yesterday’ over to one side is just distracting, and the mix of ‘Norwegian Wood’, with fingerclicks (or whatever they are) in the centre and other things panned to the right and left sounds dislocated and weird. Things really go haywire, though, on the radio-feed fade-out section of ‘I Am The Walrus’, a radical change which makes the recording sound significantly different to the one originally released, a move which has understandably drawn the ire of many fans. Less obviously but equally as annoying for me, the fresh mix of ‘Old Brown Shoe’ sounds messy and clumsy, neutering the tune’s no-nonsense drive, blunting its edge. I guess some people will love what Giles has done, younger fans won’t notice and traditionalists like me will bemoan his tinkering but, as long as the original mixes remain available, I don’t suppose it matters too much either way. And some of the Abbey Road 2019 mixes sounded better than I had remembered, so maybe my ears are slowly coming around to the changes.\n\nSo, accepting the remixes, how would I have changed the albums? Well, I would have limited the additions to just six tracks, bring each compilation up to 30 tracks apiece. Along with the three ‘no-brainer’ songs I mentioned earlier, I would have dropped in a track from either With The Beatles or Beatles For Sale, both of which were poorly-served originally (and the latter still has just one paltry track, compared to the seven – seven – lifted from Rubber Soul) – probably ‘No Reply’, which was under consideration as a single back in 1964 before ‘I Feel Fine’ came along. And I would definitely have added ‘Taxman’, upping both the Harrisong and Revolver quotient on the Red album. Finally, I have no quibble with the inclusion of ‘Hey Bulldog’ as the best representative from the Yellow Submarine album (though ‘It’s All Too Much’ would have worked just as well), but I would certainly have placed it before the White Album songs, not after, as Apple have bizarrely done here. Yes, I know Submarine wasn’t released until early 1969, but all of its songs were recorded and aired in public (on the film soundtrack) long before the White Album was even completed, never mind released. But doesn’t the same apply to the Let It Be material, recorded before Abbey Road but placed after that album’s songs on the Blue running order, I hear you cry? Well, yes, but all four Let It Be tunes included here were not completed or released in any form until long after Abbey Road came out – so I think it’s fair they get to close the book here.\n\nBut, of course, that still leaves us with the problem of where to put ‘Now and Then’. Personally, I think it should have been placed where it was always intended to go – as the opening track on the third volume of the Beatles Anthology CDs, which could have been remastered and revised/expanded especially for the occasion, perhaps alongside a spruced-up version of the accompanying documentary series (on Blu-Ray discs or a streaming platform, or both). True, there are issues with that. Some of the then-rare material first released on those discs has been superseded by the deluxe box sets of the later Fabs albums released since 2017, and no doubt that process will continue as the earlier records are revisited in similar style over the coming years. I still think those collections, with some changes, have a place in The Beatles catalogue, as part of a big multi-media exploration of the whole Anthology period, but that’s a post for another time. But even if Apple did ultimately put something out along those lines, it would still leave ‘Free as a Bird’, ‘Real Love’ and ‘Now and Then’ available only on a rarities grab-bag aimed at hardcore fans, rather than front and centre on a more mainstream hits collection. I think Apple missed a trick here, because they could have been really radical and issued remixed and (slightly) expanded Red and Blue sets AND a Green Beatles 1970-2023 30-track compilation, showcasing 27 of the biggest solo hits alongside the three reunion tracks. Their 90 biggest tracks, spanning 60 years. “But it’s not The Beatles!” I hear some people cry. Well, we’ll just have to agree to disagree on that. It would be a fabulous way to introduce anyone to the band’s body of work, together and solo. Though, on second thoughts, scratch that idea – even if the United Nations’ entire diplomatic corps were involved, it’s hard to imagine the negotiations over individual Beatle song allocations on that third compilation being resolved in our lifetimes.\n\nAs well as the unexpected thrill of hearing a brand new Beatles song in November, we were also treated to two wonderful bits of film to go with it. First, on the eve of the single’s unveiling, Apple released Now and Then – The Last Beatles Song, a short film detailing the (very) long and winding road from the tune’s creation to ultimate completion, tantalisingly previewing a few excerpts of what we would hear the following day. And 24 hours after the track itself came out, the promotional video arrived on You Tube, stirring the promotional pot and whipping up fan frenzy even more. It was a brilliant burst of short, sharp marketing from Apple and EMI, which undoubtedly helped establish the remarkable, emotional narrative surrounding the song and boost interest in it (three months on, and the video’s already clocked up 43 million views on YouTube). They may have botched things on one or two previous Beatles releases, but they pitched it just right on this occasion. Not only did they set the scene for casual viewers, they also provided us hardcore fans with the kind of fantastic unseen footage and new clips/interviews we crave. So, Fab Macca-style thumbs-aloft all round, then? Well, for the most part, yes. But for me the promo video, in particular, fell frustratingly short of what it might have been.\n\nLet’s get into the ‘making of’ mini-documentary first, though. Running a little over 12 minutes, it’s a very slick telling of the whole ‘Now and Then’ tale, mixing familiar Fabs footage from the 1960s with a mouth-watering array of new clips and interviews spanning 1978-2022. It’s effectively narrated, offscreen, by Paul and Ringo (but mainly Paul) with contributions from Sean Lennon and film director Peter Jackson, talking us through John’s original demo recording of the song at the New York’s Dakota building, Yoko’s subsequent handing over of the song (along with ‘Free as a Bird’ and ‘Real Love’) for the surviving Fabs to work on as part of the Beatles Anthology project in the 1990s, and the track’s recent resurrection and completion thanks to the development of MAL technology during the work on Jackson’s 2021 The Beatles: Get Back documentary. The voice-overs join the dots very well, though I think Macca comes over as a little too scripted at times, and there is undoubtedly a glossing over of certain aspects of the story, especially Paul’s claim that ‘Now and Then’ was shelved back in 1995 because they “ran out of steam a bit, and time.” His own admission, repeated a couple of times over the years since, that George thought the song was “rubbish” and didn’t want to finish it, is not mentioned here. It does highlight, however, how finishing the track remained on McCartney’s mind for the best part of 30 years.\n\nThe real draw of the film, however, lies in the reels of footage released into the wild for the very first time. There are some brief, lovely home movie snippets showing John, Yoko and Sean at home in the late-70s I don’t recall seeing before, as well as freshly-minted clips of Paul and Ringo performing their new parts for ‘Now and Then’ in 2022. We also get to see Macca and Giles Martin overseeing the song’s string section being committed to tape at the famous Capitol Building in Los Angeles. But the real money shots are the ones of the Threetles – Paul, George and Ringo – working on the song with Jeff Lynne at Macca’s Sussex studio in the spring of 1995. These sessions also yielded the second reunion single, ‘Real Love’, and it’s fascinating to see that some of the clips which feature in the video for that song were actually captured while they were attempting to knock ‘Now and Then’ into shape. For example, we see that during the outdoor scene of George playing his acoustic guitar while sat next to Paul (sipping a mug of tea or coffee), he was running through a half-remembered bit of ‘Norwegian Wood’. Stuff like that, along with them chatting, tuning up or listening to playbacks in the studio, is just solid gold. Peter Jackson has revealed there are around 14 hours of footage from those sessions, and that’s possibly not including the audio banter recorded between takes (some of which is played over the film’s closing credits). While it’s a pity we don’t see more of this film here (and even what we do get is sometimes intercut, unnecessarily, with ‘60s clips), it does open the door to a world of possibilities around a future documentary about the whole Anthology/reunion period – an awesome prospect which I’ll return to another time.\n\nFurther film of the Threetles at work shows up in the ‘Now and Then’ promo video, directed by Jackson. You can see why Apple thought he was the man for the job – an acclaimed, Oscar-winning filmmaker, as well as a major Fabs fan who worked wonders with the Get Back documentary, turning accepted history on its head and recasting The Beatles’ January 1969 travails into a riveting drama packed with wondrous detail and magical musical interplay. Handing him the keys to the band’s visual archives to create a short film to go with the Fabs’ final bow must’ve seemed like a no-brainer. Yet, on reflection, I wonder if he had right skill-set – as Madonna found in her film career, long-form film is a very different beast to the demands of making a four-minute pop video; a bit like how a crafting a poem or short story is an entirely different exercise to writing a novel. While he undoubtedly gets a lot right with ‘Now and Then’, I think Jackson’s lack of experience does show in places. The fact that the clip, much like the track itself, had to be cobbled together from a variety of different sources probably didn’t help much, either.\n\nThe central concept of the video is a sound one. Taking aforementioned footage of the 1995 and 2022 recording sessions, Jackson weaves in some ‘70s clips of John as well as film from the Fabs’ heyday, reflecting the whole ‘Now and Then’ motif. Most ingeniously – or controversially, depending on your viewpoint – he extracts 1967 Beatles (from the various versions of the ‘Hello Goodbye’ promo video) and inserts them alongside their latter-day equivalents. So we get George and John stood either side of Paul and Ringo while they sing the chorus or larking around while the classical musicians lay down the song’s strings. Old Ringo gets to play in sync with young Ringo; 80-year-old Paul plays bass while his 25-year-old self (and bandmates) mess about around him; 1960s George trades guitar licks with 1990s George, and so on. Jackson said he wanted to showcase the band’s “nutty” side, the cheeky, silly element which was such a key element of their collective persona, and – while some people have carped it is out of place, inappropriate, or just plain wrong to use dead people’s images in such a fashion – I think his instincts were sound. If Lennon and Harrison were still around, I think they’d have been keen to amplify the humour of the situation; John rarely kept a straight face for long in any situation, while you only to watch a few of George’s own videos to see his tongue-in-cheek approach to such things.\n\nMuch of this is really lovely, and often very touching. The Threetles stuff is joyous (contrary to what some people like to claim, George seems very happy to be back in the studio with his fellow Fabs), there are a couple of rarely-seen shots of John in the ‘70s, and some pristine colour clips of The Beatles collectively in the early 1960s. And when the splicing together of past and present is done well, it’s very effective – seeing John poke fun at Paul and Ringo is entirely in keeping with the band’s dynamic, watching Ringo keep time with Ringo as the song gathers pace is a blast, and Paul’s smile of fond reminiscence during the strings recording session while his past self and bandmates clown it up around him, like ghosts from the past, makes for a special, poignant moment. Kudos to Jackson too for the showreel of classic Beatles scenes which closes the video, taking us back through their career from the final group photoshoot at Tittenhurst Park in 1969 to their Liverpool childhoods, before ending with the final bow from A Hard Day’s Night and their disappearance into memory. It’s particularly nice to see the footage of the band, in leathers, onstage in Birkenhead from February 1962 (apparently supplied by Pete Best), the earliest known colour film of the band but which turned up too late to be included in the Anthology series.\n\nSadly, though, the execution leaves something to be desired in places. The ‘70s photo of John at sea watching the sunset is a great image, but overlaying film of the 1963 Beatles and then a 2022 McCartney singing the song is just too on the nose, too chintzy. Other inclusions seem a bit random or there for the sake of it – it’s nice to see footage of George during his 1963, pre-US Beatlemania solo visit to Manhattan, for example, but it serves no purpose here and seems a bit out of place. But the biggest failings come with matching ‘now’ Beatles with ‘then’ Beatles. Dropping modern-day Ringo into the stage performance of ‘Hello Goodbye’ works brilliantly, but when the camera pans over to Paul and he’s stood there clutching his headphones rather than his bass, the special visual symmetry of the group is lost and the spell is broken. It’s only a little detail, but it stands out like a sore thumb – they couldn’t have filmed Macca holding his bass while doing his vocal? Likewise you can only scratch your head why he and Ringo couldn’t have made time to be filmed singing in the same room rather being digitally edited together. The final Beatles song (and video) is worth making a bit of an effort for, right? The other problem with this mix-and-match stuff lies with its length, and limited scope. The tomfoolery element goes on a little too long, and I’m baffled why the 1960s Fabs are represented solely by the ‘Hello Goodbye’ performance. If you’re going to do this, why not go the whole hog and have Paul and Ringo interacting with their bandmates lifted from scenes in Let It Be/Get Back, the ‘Lady Madonna’ promo, Help! or even the Shea Stadium concert film? The total omission of anything from the Get Back documentary, which Jackson masterminded, is just plain bizarre. And did no one think to edit in 1967 Paul conducting the orchestra during the ‘A Day in the Life’ clip for the 2022 strings studio session?\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I wonder if Jackson was working to a tight deadline and had to cut corners. Strange, considering the song was in the can for more than a year before it was released, but not impossible or even unlikely. He himself explained that Paul and Ringo shot film of themselves performing and sent it to him, so he had no agency over that – he had to make the best use of what he had, instead of telling them what he needed. Maybe it would’ve been asking a bit much for the two surviving Fabs to wear their Sgt Pepper outfits (though how cool would that have looked for the performance bit?), but they could have aligned their contributions a bit more closely with Jackson’s concept. It would also explain why he just stuck using to the 1967 footage of the band, though that may have been an artistic choice on his part. Likewise, the reverse trip back through their career feels a little rushed, and misses out some pretty important moments. And do we need to see them as children at the end?\n\nSo, how would I have improved it? Well, I’d have tried to do something a bit more creative and less obvious with the image of John watching the sunset, or maybe just substituted a 1970s clip of him at the piano instead. Would certainly have asked Paul and Ringo to film their vocal scenes together (allowing a more natural interaction between them), and also maybe asked them to wear some different, lighter clothes. I wouldn’t expect coats of many colours, but seeing them both in all black next to John and George in their psychedelic finery jars a little – a red jacket here or a blue shirt there would have brought them more into line with their bandmates. As already stated, I would also have mixed in old footage from different Beatles eras for them to interact with, instead of just the 1967 edition, and cut back the studio goofing to allow more time for the whistlestop tour of their career at the finale. In turn, I would’ve extended each of the clips in that montage by an extra couple of seconds, and also incorporated excerpts from the 1969 Apple rooftop gig, the 1967 ‘All You Need is Love’ broadcast (or maybe the ‘I Am The Walrus’ scene from Magical Mystery Tour), the Royal Command Performance from 1963 and, if there was time, the ‘Some Other Guy’ Cavern clip from 1962. And I would have ended that section with the Quarrymen-era photos, cutting straight to the A Hard Day’s Night bow and fade.\n\nBut that’s just me. The video is what it is, there’s still much to enjoy, and I’m very glad we have it. On balance, I thought the promos for the two previous reunion singles worked a little better – ‘Free as a Bird’ as a misty-eyed tour of the Beatles legend, and ‘Real Love’ as a more traditional, beautifully assembled blend of old and new footage. But the way the film for ‘Now and Then’, like the song itself, brings the Fabs back together in a manner which would have been unimaginable just a few years ago adds yet another strand to the band’s vast creative tapestry. Love it or loathe it, this sort of thing is probably going to become increasingly prevalent as advances in technology allow artists of all kinds a permanent afterlife in the public eye (consider the Abba Voyage concert experience currently pulling in the crowds in London). Indeed, it may not be long until virtual reality allows us to interact with The Beatles, watching them in the Cavern or sitting in on a studio recording session, and how magical would that be? But for now, for all its missteps, this video allows us one last chance to see the group’s chemistry and camaraderie shining brightly across the decades – now and then, and in between. And, if you are anything like me, there are few things in life more enjoyable than that.\n\nI still remember the disappointment I felt when, on my way home from work in the late summer of 1996, I leafed through the new issue of MOJO magazine and saw the exclusive reveal of the tracklisting for the forthcoming Beatles Anthology Vol. 3 album. It stated, categorically, that – unlike the first two volumes in the series – there would no ‘new’ Beatles to lead off the set, that the well of ‘Threetles’ sessions which had produced ‘Free as a Bird’ and ‘Real Love’ had run dry. It wasn’t a massive surprise. There’d been no updates on Paul, George and Ringo working together since the previous year, and no hype to prepare us for a third and final reunion track, whether it be another souped-up Lennon demo or a brand new McCartney/Harrison composition (which had been rumoured at one point). But I was still gutted. Despite the sniffy reaction to the new songs from some quarters, I’d loved them and had been hoping against hope that the surviving Fabs would come together one more time and complete the set, as it were. That feeling was reinforced the following year when Paul revealed they had indeed worked on a third song, but had aborted it because George didn’t think it was up to scratch. Despite Macca’s chirpy claim that they still might finish it off one day, I resigned myself to listening to John’s crackly demo of the tune (called ‘Now and Then’) which leaked out on bootlegs and – later – more polished fan reworkings of it on YouTube, and imagining what might have been.\n\nFast-forward more than a quarter-century later and the release of ‘Now and Then’, the much-heralded “last Beatles song” makes headlines around the world, gives the band their 18th UK #1 single and even cracks the Billboard US Top Ten. As you will no doubt know by now, the development of machine-assisted learning (MAL) technology during the production of 2021’s The Beatles Get Back documentary allowed Paul and Ringo to surmount the technical problems presented by the original cassette demo, isolate John’s vocal and add fresh parts to their abandoned first pass at the song in 1995 (but retaining George’s guitar playing from those sessions). Throw in a newly-added string section and some reworked Beatles harmonies from the 1960s (adroitly lifted from ‘Here, There and Everywhere’, ‘Eleanor Rigby’ and ‘Because’) and – voilà – a brand new song from the Fab Four. I covered the long and winding road which got us to this point in a post after Paul let slip the tune was on its way earlier this year, but it’s still hard to believe it’s happened. Certainly, if you’d have told me back in 1996 that two octogenarian Beatles – with a little help from George Martin’s producer son and the kind of artificial intelligence you might find in a Terminator film – would come back with a #1 record in the year 2023, I might have thought you’d been venturing a little too literally into the psychedelic realm. But here we are. The reunion trilogy is complete, the unfinished business (as much for Paul as for the fans) is laid to rest, one sweet dream has come true. So was it worth the wait?\n\nI think the first thing to say is how big a part the advances in technology have played in the end product. While producer Jeff Lynne did a sterling job (technically, at least) knitting together the cassette demos of ‘Free as a Bird’ and ‘Real Love’ with 1990s Beatle contributions, and they still sound great to me, the limitations of those recordings are more apparent when you hear ‘Now and Then’. Freed completely from the piano, electrical buzz and other background noise locked into the original tape, John’s voice sounds remarkably clear and present – almost studio quality, in fact. This, in turn, gave Paul and Ringo room to put a more distinctive instrumental stamp on the track. There are a couple of nice bass guitar flourishes, while the drumming is looser, not hemmed in by the need to simply keep time behind the original piano chords; likewise, Paul was able to add a completely new, more fluid piano part which anchors the song in a totally natural way. While it’s a pity George isn’t more prominent, his chugging electric rhythm guitar does add some important extra texture (excuse the pun) and he is of course absolutely part of those harmony vocals from the ‘60s, used so deftly to add a recognisably Fab flavour to the track. Paul’s slide guitar solo, a nod to George’s preferred style, doesn’t really sound Harrison-esque at all (it reminds me slightly of the one in The Hollies’ ‘The Air That I Breathe’), but is still very effective. And the addition of strings, arranged by Paul, Giles Martin and Ben Foster, was a masterful touch, raising the stakes and the lending the track more clout (though I can’t help feeling Martin Snr. would have added some horns behind the chorus, too). If you listened to the finished recording and didn’t know the backstory, you probably wouldn’t spot the joins.\n\nHowever, all the layering of instruments in the world wouldn’t make much difference if the song wasn’t much good, and it’s here where magic of The Beatles comes into full force. When I first heard John’s demo back in the late-1990s, it seemed a little ponderous and uninspired to me, and I could kind of understand why George put an end to The Threetles’ attempts to breathe life into it (predictably, his lack of enthusiasm for the song – as cited by Paul on more than one occasion over the years – has now been reframed as frustration with the audio quality of the original cassette tape). But, whether through sheer bloody-mindedness or not, Paul was convinced there was something good there and, aided by today’s super computers, he has been fully vindicated. He could hear the inherent beauty in that skeletal demo and, in true Lennon/McCartney collaborative style, was able to bring it into full bloom with his pitch-perfect arrangement. And he really earns his corn on the chorus, beefing up the tune, tidying up the lyrics and joining John on lead vocal in a fashion which really hits the emotional bullseye. It’s the high point of the song for me, and just screams Beatles. To be fair, there were probably a number of factors which caused George to pull the plug back in 1995; had he still been around to hear technology (and a splash of McCartney genius) unlock the potential of the tune, I suspect he wouldn’t have been against finishing it off.\n\nWhat has confounded some fans is the decision to excise the original ‘I don’t want to lose you’ middle section from John’s recording (indeed, when Yoko allowed the tune to be used in the disastrous, short-lived 2005 Broadway musical Lennon it was called ‘I Don’t Want To Lose You’). We don’t know whether this decision was taken back in 1995 when the surviving Fabs first worked on it, or whether Paul opted to cut it more recently (though we do know it was gone when Macca first presented it to Giles Martin last year). One can only speculate about the reasons behind the decision; they may have felt it would have made the song too long, or that it simply didn’t need another section. Or perhaps that the natural flow of the verse/chorus lyric would have interrupted, and the focus of the song lost. John’s demos from this time often include bits and pieces he later removed and dropped into another song altogether, and Paul could have felt it just didn’t fit. Editing one another’s work was always a key facet of the Lennon/McCartney partnership, and who are we to second-guess Macca’s creative judgement? Nonetheless, I think it’s a shame he didn’t find a way to keep at least an element of this passage. Yes, it rambles a little and John runs out of words by the end of it, but I’m sure Paul could’ve found a way to tighten it up and fill in any gaps as necessary. The tune and sentiment is so Lennon, and I think it is of a piece with the rest of the composition. It could have added even more depth to the finished version; it leads back into the chorus extremely well and may even have allowed a brief pause in the song, creating a bit more ebb and flow. Anyway, make your own mind up — have a listen to one of the fan-made ‘augmented’ versions which have appeared online in recent weeks or even this one, made long before The Beatles’ recording was dusted down and completed.\n\nTalking of lyrics, there has been a lot of speculation about what ‘Now and Then’ is about – fuelled by Giles Martin’s claim in several interviews that the song was some kind of love letter from John to Paul. Many have also seized on the oft-repeated story from Carl Perkins (as told to him by Linda) that the final words John ever said to Paul, in person, were “Think of me every now and then, old friend”, and the more elusive claim – rehashed in many recent news stories – that the tape featuring the original demo had ‘For Paul’ written on it. Dealing with the last point first, if that was the case, it is infinitely more probable that those words were written by Yoko, or one of her team, than John, not least because the tape featured three other songs compiled for The Threetles to work on as part of the Anthology project. I can certainly see no earthly reason why John would have set aside that one song (or indeed, any song) from that period to give to Paul, unless he possessed uncanny powers of premonition (ah, I hear you cry, but Paul’s tour band guitarist Brian Ray has said John wrote those words on the cassette, and surely Macca wouldn’t have let him think that if it wasn’t true, right? Well, let’s just say Paul’s never been one to let the facts get in the way of a good story). But could Lennon have been thinking of McCartney when he drafted those words? If they are ‘about’ anyone or anything, the verses seem to me most likely to relate to Yoko (as does the missing ‘I don’t want to lose you’ section), but when you get to the chorus, you do wonder why John would sing ‘now and then I miss you’ to the woman he was married to and living with. This was an unfinished song, remember, so it’s possible he was still playing with different feelings and moods as the lyric was taking shape, hopping from one to another; it’s more than possible that, had he returned to the tune later, he may have cannibalised its constituent parts to make different songs altogether. So he could well have been thinking of his old pal Paul, though it’s just as likely he was writing about, say, May Pang, his mid-70s lover who has always claimed John remained in touch with her after his reconciliation with Yoko. It’s fun to speculate but, unless hard evidence turns up, we’ll just never know.\n\nWhile some people are proclaiming it as a Beatles song about Beatles, others have questioned whether it’s even a Fab Four record at all. In particular, I’ve read comments claiming it is more in keeping with a 1970s Lennon tune, or that it just doesn’t sound like “classic Beatles”. Putting aside the fact that repeating themselves was a total anathema to the band, which strand of “classic Beatles” should they have attempted to recreate, exactly? ‘She Loves You’? ‘For No One’? ‘Within You, Without You’? ‘I Am The Walrus’? ‘Rocky Raccoon’? ‘Revolution 9’? As for it resembling a John solo number, surely if the group was still together in the late-‘70s, this is the kind of song they would be producing. The Beatles never stood still, and would have no zero interest in trying to reproduce records they made ten years earlier. They would’ve been different people by then, though still recognisably the same artists. As George said about ‘Free As A Bird’ in 1995, “it sounds like them – but now.” Of course, if you’re like me, all of the solo music is part of The Beatles’ canon anyway; even if you think otherwise, surely a Lennon song finished up by Paul McCartney, within input from George Harrison and Ringo Starr, is by definition a Fabs track?\n\nHowever you define it, it seems a majority of people who care about such things are just happy to have it. Unlike the mixed response which greeted ‘Free As A Bird’ – saddled as it was with the sky-high expectations of being “the first Beatles single in 25 years” – ‘Now and Then’ has probably benefited from being “the final Beatles song”, a special event which has ridden the latest wave of public interest generated by the Get Back film, the on-going remixed reissues of the band’s back catalogue and Paul’s return to the global concert stage. A piece of pop culture history (hell, social history) brought back to life. A poignant reminder that, while they still in fine fettle, the sands of time are also running out for Paul and Ringo, and a time is coming when there will be no more Beatles left. A chance for people of all generations to share in the joy of hearing a new Beatles song – some for the very first time, but all for the last time. The long delay in its completion and release has almost certainly worked in its favour; had it been put out as the third reunion single and lead-off track on Anthology Vol.3 in 1996, it would probably have been greeted with a collective shrug of the shoulders by the wider public, with the novelty and excitement of hearing new Beatles material having already worn off. As it is, I think people now appreciate it for the minor miracle it is – and, most importantly, just enjoy it as a song in its own right. Whether reading emotional online responses from first generation fans or fulsome reviews by music critiques, watching rapturous YouTube reactions from people who wouldn’t have been born even when the Anthology came out, or just having friends ask me about the song or tell me how much they like it, it’s all given me a heart-warming buzz. My boys have done it again! And the fact it was released on my birthday made for the best present I could ever have wished for.\n\nThat’s not to say they got every element of the project right. The cover of the single was dreadful, shockingly dull and lacklustre for such an important record. I’d have preferred the cassette tape image which was used to trail its release, the back cover image of George’s clock or, even better, one of John’s drawings like the one used for ‘Free As A Bird’. Or any number of other designs put together by fans online. I’d also question the wisdom of placing the song at the end of the new, remixed and expanded (and now somewhat erroneously titled) 1967-70 compilation album, a somewhat awkward and clumsy attempt to monetise its release to the max, while the accompanying video – while overall an emotional and enjoyable one – is not without its flaws (I’ll discuss these points in future posts). But the song itself? Even without the “missing” bridge section, I don’t think we could have asked for anything better. A friend of mine, who is more of a music lover than an ardent Fabs fan, summed it up well when he said it was so obviously made with love and care, in a way that can only enhance, not detract from, the group’s legacy; the very opposite of the nostalgia-baiting cash-grab it could have been. The very fact it exists at all is a wonder, but the fact it is so good is simply ridiculous. Is it among the top tier of Beatles songs? No. How could it be? But is it worthy of the band’s catalogue, and a fitting note to go out on? Absolutely. We now have one more song to treasure, one which – together with ‘Free As A Bird’ and ‘Real Love’ – forms a beautiful coda to the greatest pop music story ever told.\n\nIn one respect, it doesn’t really matter whether or not it’s John singing to Paul; even Paul’s dogged determination to complete it and reconnect with his beloved bandmates one last time can be seen as just a subplot for us fans to get misty-eyed over. As with all their tunes, it’s less about what the authors meant and more about what the listener takes from the song. Taken on those terms, even without the loaded backstory that comes with it, ‘Now and Then’ can mean something to anyone who has lost someone – parent, child, friend, lover – and longs to see them again. How “then” always informs the “now”, for all of us. But the band is so ingrained in our culture, our collective consciousness, that it’s impossible to forget the backstory entirely. Irrespective of the technology which allowed it to happen, and the happenstance that this was one of the songs Yoko put on the tape for the surviving Fabs back in the 1990s, the fact of the matter is that a yearning, wistful tune sketched out by John at his apartment overlooking Central Park one day in 1970s New York was completed by his best friend and musical soulmate more than four decades later, embodying all the hope, humanity, emotional resonance and deep connection to one another that made The Beatles what they were. Maybe, on some kind of cosmic level, it’s their way of saying: don’t worry folks, there’s always a way to get back homewards. Those loved ones are never really gone, they live on within you and without you. Or maybe it’s just a nice little song. Who knows? Whatever you think, it’s the perfect way for The Beatles to wave goodbye, and yet lodge themselves even deeper in our hearts forever more.\n\nIf there is a ‘sound’ of Beatlemania, an aural expression of the moment in time when music, culture and society began to be shaken to their core by the atomic blast generated by the Fab Four, there are a few candidates you could point to. In literal terms, there is the Live at the Hollywood Bowl album, when you can hear the teenage contingent of the world going bonkers just by being in the presence of the Moptops, reflecting the deafening hysteria that greeted the band’s every appearance (the songs they are playing at those 1964 and ’65 shows are almost an afterthought). A Hard Day’s Night captures the moment when, fresh from conquering the USA, the Fabs had the world at their feet and felt confident enough to unleash a barrage of brilliant self-penned numbers which redefined notions of what pop stars were supposed to be, allying inarguable songwriting genius with the irrepressible cocktail of looks, charisma, humour and stage presence which had already captured hearts across the globe. And if you wanted to boil it all down to one song, you’d be hard pushed to top ‘She Loves You’ as the moment when the floodgates opened and The Beatles began taking root in the world’s DNA. But, for me, the record which really enshrines the moment in time when anything seemed possible – a promise the band made good on in the most extraordinary, unimaginable fashion – is the one they began recording 60 years ago this summer, With The Beatles.\n\nI have to come clean and say, straightaway, that With The Beatles is probably my least favourite of their regular EMI studio albums (excluding the half-hearted mish-mash that is Yellow Submarine), though by that I of course mean it is their least brilliant. Many believe it’s a significant step up from their debut, Please Please Me, and – in some respects – I’d have to agree. It’s more assured, the production has more punch and polish, and some of the original compositions are terrific (if not matching the sustained quantum leap they would make by the time of A Hard Day’s Night). That said, track-for-track, I think its predecessor has a slight edge. By the band’s own high standards, With has a couple of clunkers (‘Little Child’ and ‘I Wanna Be Your Man’) which weigh it down a little. But there is so much to love about this record, it doesn’t really matter. Even the weaker numbers are performed with jaw-dropping gusto, and the confidence that success brings surges through every note they play. Please Please Me saw them plant their flag in the ground and shout: “We’re here, you need to listen to us”; With The Beatles was them saying: “Now we’ve got your attention, we’re going to flex our muscles and show you what we can really do.” It was the perfect album to not only consolidate and strengthen their vice-like grip over UK pop music, but also spearhead their assault on the US in the (albeit slightly different) form of Meet The Beatles early in 1964.\n\nUnlike their debut, the bulk of which was famously recorded in a single day, With had a comparatively leisurely gestation, put together over seven sessions spanning July-October 1963. True, they did have to fit in visits to Abbey Road around a hectic touring schedule, BBC radio sessions, photoshoots and personal appearances (they were heavily promoting ‘She Loves You’ during this period, which saw their profile and popularity explode), but there is a cohesion and consistency to the album which belies any kind of piecemeal approach. The Fabs were quick learners, and their work here is a world away from their first, tentative foray into the EMI recording studio a year earlier when they began to cut ‘Love Me Do’. Their harmonies and call-and-response singing are spectacular, and their ensemble playing is super-tight – listen to the stop-start precision of ‘Don’t Bother Me’ or ‘Please Mr Postman’, for example. George Martin was also figuring out how to get the most out of them as a studio band, rather than simply recording them as a live act. This album has a fuller, richer sound than Please Please Me. Paul’s bass and Ringo’s drums are higher in the mix, giving the songs more ballast, while more prominent piano (sometimes played by Martin himself) and the introduction of acoustic guitars and bongo drums on ‘Till There Was You’ provided extra texture, and signalled they were already moving away from the strictures of a simple pop combo sound. And if you want to hear early, unfettered soulful singing from John Lennon, this is the place to go. He just opens his mouth and sings his heart out, in quite astonishing fashion.\n\nJohn sings lead on ‘It Won’t Be Long’, which more than meets the peerless standards of Beatles album openers and might even be my favourite track on the record. With an irresistible chorus (playfully parodying the ‘yeah, yeah, yeah’ refrain sweeping the UK that summer/autumn), breathless pace, clever vocal interplay, a reflective middle section which builds to a mini-crescendo of its own and a chiming guitar riff from George, it’s damn-near perfect. Their attention to detail and relentless desire to squeeze every last drop from a song is already apparent, too, with Paul delivering an extra-frantic “yeah!” in the final chorus and the whole runaway train screeching to a stop in a bed of flowery harmonies.\n\nThey instantly switch gears with another Lennon number, the languid but achingly tender ‘All I’ve Got To Do’. The first of several numbers showing a debt to Smokey Robinson, John’s voice is actually quite restrained in the verses (though knowing and sexily mesmeric in the way he spins out the second “that’s all I-I-I-I-I’ve got to do”). But this just sets up another impassioned delivery in the middle section, brilliantly supported by Paul’s and George’s backing vocals. The wordless “mmmm” repeat of the verse at the end is another masterstroke (as if words can’t really capture the intimacy he’s singing about), and special kudos to Ringo for the jerky but expertly played rhythm at the heart of the song. Martin’s production chops really shine on this one too, giving it a really clean but powerful sound. It’s one of those tracks you might overlook on first hearing, but I find I like it more with each passing year.\n\nBy contrast, of course, ‘All My Loving’ hits the bullseye on first listen and never shifts. In much the same way as he produced the perfect rock ‘n’ roll song with ‘I Saw Her Standing There’ on the previous album and would nail the romantic ballad with ‘And I Love Her’ on their next record, Paul masters the pop song idiom here. It’s the perfect marriage of a memorable lyric (how good is “I’ll pretend that I’m kissing/The lips I am missing”?) with a zinger melody, propelled in the verses by John’s rattling rhythm guitar and broken up by George’s inspired country-and-western-style solo, one of his most impressive early performances. Paul’s wide-eyed, soaring vocal is the icing on the cake. While John was undoubtedly the most prolific half of the Lennon/McCartney partnership at this stage, some of Macca’s contributions were worth their weight in gold.\n\nMeanwhile George was starting to dip his toe into the composing pool, and ‘Don’t Bother Me’ is an excellent first effort. Characterised by a thick, draggy sound, the song itself has a distinctly moody, introverted flavour which was new to the The Beatles’ oeuvre. True, John had sung of being home alone and sobbing his heart out over his love, but George actively pushes people away in this one. In all other respects, though, it hits all the marks set by John’s and Paul’s songs of the era – a rollicking rhythm, great tune (I especially love the middle section) and fine group playing. It’s well up to the standards of his bandmates’ originals, which makes it all the more odd that no further Harrisongs appeared on the following two albums and not until almost two years later.\n\nThe quality control does take a dip on ‘Little Child’, a flimsy Lennon/McCartney song which screams ‘throwaway’. But even here, they make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear with another full-throttle, dynamic performance. The instrumental break is especially good, with George Martin welding together John’s wailing harmonica, Paul’s hammering piano and some powerhouse Ringo drumming to explosive effect. Then we get a breather with ‘Till There Was You’, the album’s first cover and the band’s first full-on acoustic work-out, which gives free rein to Macca’s romantic crooner tendencies of the period. While their version is based on a jazzy rendition by Peggy Lee, the song’s Broadway musical origins come through in the lyrics, where cheesy references to birds, roses, dawn and dew abound; and if you listen to Paul’s vocal on their take of the song during the unsuccessful Decca Records audition almost two years earlier, it is a little cloying by Beatles standards. But the tone here is just right, a much more mature, sincere interpretation, perfectly supported by the simple, uncluttered arrangement and a gorgeous, expressive solo from George, who really demonstrates his versatility on this. The song is hugely important, for two reasons – first, it helped broaden the Fabs’ appeal to many adults who had assumed they were just tuneless, rowdy rockers; second, it’s effectively a dry run for the numerous acoustic ballads which would flow effortless from Paul’s pen over the decades which followed (only with stronger lyrics).\n\nThe band then switches to the Tamla Motown part of their repertoire with ‘Please Mr Postman’ (originally released by The Marvelettes), and it’s an absolute corker. This album is all about energy, and it’s cranked up to maximum here – from the urgent, shouted intro, to the way the band crashes in a few bars later (like they can’t hold back another second), to John’s pleading, heart-wrenching, impatient vocal (he doesn’t even finish one line, he’s so desperate to get onto the next) to the furious fade-out. Anyone who’s ever waited agonisingly for a letter (or maybe text/email these days) which never comes could relate to the raw bundle of emotions masterfully captured here. It’s another contender for the album’s stand-out track and, after ‘Twist and Shout’, probably my favourite of all the band’s covers.\n\n‘Roll Over Beethoven’, the Chuck Berry classic with George singing lead, falls a little short in comparison, but is still a solid rocker. It really swings, thanks in part to John’s chugging rhythm part and the infectious handclaps, while Harrison’s double-tracked boyish vocal and sparky guitar solo are spot-on. While the overall production is a little too clean for my taste, and there are other Berry songs I prefer, it remains a decent way to kick off the second half of the album. And despite its detractors (including Paul himself, who has dismissed it as “work song” over the years), I think ‘Hold Me Tight’ is pretty good, too. Yes, Macca’s vocal is a bit wobbly in places, but the pile-driving guitars give the tune real muscle and there’s an earnest intimacy about the pounding middle section (“You-ou don’t know…what it means to hold you tight”) that I’ve always loved. I also like the way it kind of collapses in an exhausted heap at the end.\n\nNext up is another of their greatest cover versions, their take on Smokey Robinson’s ‘You Really Got A Hold On Me’. The harmony singing on this is thrilling enough, but John’s raw yet remarkably controlled lead vocal is out of this world, like each word is tearing a chunk out of his heart. As an exploration of the bitter-sweet agony of being drawn to someone that you know is no good for you, it’s hard to beat, aided further by George’s understated, mournful guitar lines and yet more fantastic drumming from Ringo. As a band, they rarely sounded tighter than on this, years of playing together coming to glorious fruition on a performance which makes your head spin. By contrast, ‘I Wanna Be Your Man’ – hurriedly written by John and Paul as a gift for the nascent Rolling Stones – is a piece of repetitive fluff; but, once again, it is infused with such vitality and raucousness, they get away with it. Ringo sounds like he’s singing atop a runaway horse, John’s and Paul’s backing vocals are like sniggers from the sidelines, while George’s jagged solo captures the whole proto-punk feeling of the exercise. It’s mildly ridiculous, yet lots of fun all the same.\n\nI never used to have a high opinion of ‘Devil in Her Heart’ (another girl group cover, this time an obscure B-side by obscure US outfit The Donays), either, but it has grown on me over the years. The song’s slight air of corniness (“no no, nay will she deceive”) is redeemed by the third and possibly best lead vocal from George on the album, which nails the innocence and trusting optimism the lyric demands. He also plays some tasteful guitar fills, while Lennon and McCartney come over as worried choirboys with their winning counterpart vocals. There’s nothing angelic about the next song, ‘ Not A Second Time’, another wonderful early Lennon tale of wounded love and betrayal. With the second half simply a repeat of the first it does sound a little under-developed, but it nonetheless throws some powerful emotional punches. John’s singing is confused, hurt and defiant all at the same time; the magic of the song is that while he swears he’s had enough of being messed around, the music tells you he’ll continue to fall over and over again. Some of the chord changes are amazing (this is the tune which famously elicited talk of “Aeolian cadences” from the highbrow music critic of The Times), and George Martin’s simple piano part adds extra weight to the proceedings.\n\nAnd Martin is on piano again to great effect on the album’s closer, the band’s balls-to-the-wall cover of Barret Strong’s ‘Money (That’s What I Want)’. Another tune the band had performed at their doomed Decca Records audition the year before, the contrast between the two versions is even more stark than on ‘Till There Was You’. Whereas the 1962 take feels tentative, tepid and hurried, the With The Beatles version is bursting with swagger and intent. John pulls out another uncompromising vocal, excitedly supported by Paul and George, while Ringo’s drums sound colossal, bringing all the heft and presence Pete Best’s playing lacked. And the track gathers momentum as it goes, the band upping the ante as they near the finishing line, epitomised by John’s unhinged ad lib scream of “I wanna be free!”, a sure sign not only of the Fabs’ unashamed thirst for material success but also of their awareness that financial reward was just a means to an end. As a blockbuster finale, ‘Money’ doesn’t quite touch the heights of the earlier ‘Twist and Shout’, but it more than delivers what is required, like an erupting volcano pumping out one last blast of lava.\n\nIt seems almost beside the point to reflect on the album’s commercial success, but it’s worth noting a few points. With The Beatles was only the second album in the UK to sell more than a million copies, topping the charts for 21 weeks (which, combined with Please Please Me, gave the band 50 straight weeks as the top-selling LP act in the country – two weeks shy of a full year). Its US counterpart, Meet The Beatles (which featured a truncated, slightly different set of songs), was the Fabs’ passport to the big time Stateside, exploding in the early months of 1964 and eventually selling more than five million copies there. You could argue almost all of The Beatles’ albums were epochal in one way or the other, but there is a case to be made that this one was the most important of all. In the UK it proved beyond any doubt the band was not just a flash in the pan, and forced more serious music lovers to sit up and take notice. In the US, albeit in slightly altered form, it obliterated preconceptions of pop music, paved the way for the so-called ‘British invasion’ and helped establish not only the rock album format but also the very idea of rock music as we know it today.\n\nWhen fans tend to rank their favourite Beatles albums today, With The Beatles tends to come quite far down the list, and I completely understand why – the Fabs would repeatedly scale even greater heights in the years to come. But there are people, especially music critics, who regard it as a five-star record in its own right, and that’s equally true. As The Beatles advanced and evolved with bewildering rapidity, this was their crowning farewell to their incarnation as a Liverpool and Hamburg club act; while listeners were still marveling over the fresh new sound captured on the album, the band was already off exploring new horizons, leaving the rest of the world to play catch-up for the remainder of the decade. But the beauty of With The Beatles is that it is the perfect snapshot of them in that moment when they began to shake the door of Western pop culture off its hinges, and it began to dawn on people some special was happening. Moreover, it remains an exhilarating listen, timelessly effervescent and brimming with invention, vigour and attitude. And for those of us who weren’t around to experience it at the time, it is a dose of Beatlemania on tap.\n\nJust when I was starting to become somewhat disillusioned with the dearth of interesting new Beatles-related releases on the horizon, Christmas came early this month with Paul’s bombshell announcement that a “new” Beatles song had been completed and was being prepped for release later this year. Wow. Though it hasn’t been confirmed, the track is believed to be ‘Now and Then’, a late-1970s Lennon demo briefly worked on by the surviving Fabs in the mid-1990s as part of the Anthology project but ultimately discarded for one reason or another (which I’ll get into later). Apparently, the wonders of artificial intelligence (AI) technology have resolved any technical issues surrounding the quality of John’s vocal and, voila, Macca has fulfilled his long-standing wish to create a “final” Beatles song with contributions from all four members. The detail is still sketchy, but his comments have predictably sparked a firestorm of debate online. Should two Beatles be able to release a new track without the say-so of their absent bandmates? Does it even constitute a Beatles recording in the circumstances, never mind one good enough to carry the label of being their final presentation to the world? What form will the release take – will it be part of a bigger package, and are we now scraping the bottom of the barrel? I’ll be honest – for me, this is the holy grail of Beatles releases, one I’ve been waiting/hoping for over half my life, and I can’t fucking wait. But there is a lot to unpick here, so let’s get into it.\n\nThe history of ‘Now and Then’ is a tangled, and quite intriguing, one. Originally recorded by John as a piano demo in the late 1970s, it never aired on the otherwise exhaustive exploration of his personal archive on US radio from 1988-92, The Lost Lennon Tapes. Nonetheless, it was one of unfinished songs Yoko handed over to Paul, George and Ringo to work on and transform into ‘new’ Beatles tracks for the Anthology project of the mid-1990s. Two of these – ‘Free as a Bird’ and ‘Real Love’ – were completed, and led off the first two volumes of The Beatles Anthology archive collections, but ‘Now and Then’ was abandoned and the final Anthology set appeared in the autumn of 1996 without a third reunion song.\n\nI remember the feeling of huge disappointment when Apple announced this. There was no talk of ‘Now and Then’ officially at the time, but it was an open secret the three former Fabs (a.k.a. The Threetles) had been working on other songs. It was strongly rumoured that ‘Grow Old With Me’, a gorgeous tune that appeared in demo form on John’s posthumous Milk and Honey album in 1984, was on the tape Yoko had given them, and there were also whispers of a brand new McCartney-Harrison original, ‘All For Love’, which really set pulses racing. To the best of my knowledge, neither of these two numbers have ever been confirmed as Threetles works-in-progress (indeed, before recording a version of it for his 2019 album What’s My Name, Ringo claimed never to have heard ‘Grow Old With Me’), but talk of an unfinished third track was verified by Paul himself in 1997, while promoting that year’s Flaming Pie album. “George didn’t like it. The Beatles being a democracy, we didn’t do it,” he told Q magazine (interestingly, in another interview, he didn’t rule out that the song might be released one day). There were also reports that the quality of the original demo also posed major technical issues for the trio and producer Jeff Lynne. This became evident when the original Lennon version leaked out onto the bootleg market around this time. When a friend played me John’s demo recording in 1999, the loud buzz which accompanied it was definitely a problem. And while the tune itself was quite haunting, it also seemed a little ponderous and skeletal. Though their decision remained massively frustrating, I could kind of understand why the Fabs had passed on it.\n\nFast forward ten years or so, and Paul was reported to have said he remained interested in finishing the track off – something he reiterated when appearing on a BBC documentary about Jeff Lynne, Mr Blue Sky, in 2012. Despite again saying that George “went off it” (and, indeed, thought it was “fucking rubbish”), he added: “That one’s still lingering around…I’m going to nick in with Jeff and do it, finish it, one of these days.” Coincidentally or not, a new version of the Lennon demo began circulating online at around the same time, without the buzz and in much better audio quality. It was so good that fans began adding their own backing to it in an attempt to guestimate what a modern-day Beatles recording would have sounded like. One rendition, in particular, was stunning – not only allying John’s vocal with tasteful piano, guitar, bass and drum parts (and weaving in authentic harmonies here and there), it also revealed the song itself to be much more substantial than the original threadbare demo had indicated (and also belying Lynne’s assertion that “the song had a chorus but is almost totally lacking in verses.”) It demonstrated the art of the possible in fine style, even without the extra creative juice actual real Beatles could bring to the table.\n\nDespite all this, I was still very surprised to hear it was still on Paul’s radar as recently as 2021, when he mentioned his interest in returning to ‘Now and Then’ in an interview with The New Yorker in the lead-up to the airing of Peter Jackson’s The Beatles: Get Back documentary series. Still, after my excitement subsided, realism set in (or so I thought). Wasn’t it a little late in the day to be doing this, I reasoned? After all, it will soon be 30 years (gulp) since those Threetles sessions. And could he really do it when, by his own admission, George had so firmly rejected the possibility of releasing it? Yet here we are: with AI giving us a nice, clean Lennon vocal to enhance the 1990s Threetles backing tracks (and who knows what other embellishments Paul has added since), and the whole Beatles family on board with the project, a farewell Fab Four song will soon be with us.\n\nOf course, there are some who believe this shouldn’t be happening at all. That it won’t really be ‘The Beatles’, because the four didn’t record it together and two of them aren’t here to give their approval. Those same naysayers are usually the same people who don’t consider ‘Free as a Bird’ or ‘Real Love’ to be part of the band’s ‘official’ canon. I’ve always found this view strange. Whether or not you like them, or think they are worthy of The Beatles’ name is one thing, but claiming they are not Beatles songs defies logic in my view. They were written by a Beatle (‘Free as a Bird’ is actually credited to all four, with finishing touches added by Paul, George and Ringo), feature all four Beatles and were approved and released by all three surviving Beatles, plus Yoko. Ah, I hear some say, but John would never have sanctioned their release. Well, I would hazard a guess that the four people John was closest to in his adult life would have a better idea of what he would’ve approved of than complete strangers who never met him. But they’re not part of that 1962-70 EMI catalogue, I hear others cry. So, does that mean all the pre-EMI, pre-Ringo songs released on Anthology Vol. 1 are not Beatles songs either? Nor the BBC radio sessions material? Who exactly is deciding what is ‘canon’ and what isn’t? Shouldn’t that be up to, er, The Beatles? Yes, other dissenting voices cry, but John isn’t really on these songs, they were effectively performing as a trio. Right. So, by that token, ‘Here Comes The Sun’ isn’t a Beatles song. Nor ‘I Me Mine’, or ‘For No One, or ‘Because’, or ‘Back in the USSR’. And I dread to think how these people will react when someone breaks it to them that tunes like ‘Yesterday’, ‘Julia’ and ‘Blackbird’ feature just a single Beatle. Clearly such tracks are seriously lacking in the authenticity stakes.\n\nThe undoubted elephant in the room with ‘Now and Then’, however, is George – more specifically, the degree of his approval and his participation. By Paul’s own admission, it was Harrison who brought the curtain down first time around, branding the track “fucking rubbish”. Paul has also said how George felt some of John’s songwritin"
