        "text": "George Harrison tragically died nearly two decades ago after a battle with lung cancer; however, Paul McCartney recently divulged that he still communicates with his former Beatles bandmate in quite an interesting way: through a tree Harrison gifted him many years ago.\n\n\"George was very into horticulture, [he was] a really good gardener,\" he explained in a recent interview. \"He gave me [the] tree as a present. It's a big fir tree and it's by my gate.\"\n\n\"As I was leaving my house [on the morning of Dec. 18], I got out of the car close the gate and looked up at the tree and said, 'Hi, George,'\" Macca recalled. \"There he is, growing strongly ... That takes me back to the time when I hitchhiked with him! [George and John Lennon still have] an ever-present presence.\"\n\n\"It's lovely. He gave it to me, so I just planted it,\" he continued. \"But then, as the years go by, every time I look at it I go, 'That's the tree George gave me.' George has entered that tree for me. I hope he's happy with that.\"\n\nEarlier this month marked the 40th anniversary of Lennon's murder, and McCartney admitted to The New York Times Magazine that he still had a hard time comprehending the tragedy.\n\n\"I rerun the scenario in my head,\" he said. \"Very emotional. So much so that I can't really think about it. It kind of implodes. What can you think about that besides anger? Like any bereavement, the only way out is to remember how good it was with John. Because I can't get over the senseless act. I can't think about it. I'm sure it's some form of denial. But denial is the only way that I can deal with it.\"\n\nPhoto: Getty Images"
