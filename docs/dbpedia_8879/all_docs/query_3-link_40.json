        "text": "Everybody needs a take on Now and Then, I suppose. Here’s mine.\n\nEvaluating Now and Then as just a song is a nigh-on impossible task for anyone with a passing knowledge of who and what the Beatles were. Which is to say, it’s an impossible task for nearly everyone who’s taken the time to hear it.\n\nNow and Then isn’t just a song: it’s Paul McCartney’s white whale; it’s the last musical testament of two dead men, both of whom have been deified by their fans and neither of whom were able to sign off on its release; it’s a proof of concept for machine learning technology in both archival and creative contexts; it’s a new pop record by two old geezers in their ninth decades; it’s number one in the pop charts.\n\nIs it a good song? Is it a good record? Is it a good Beatles record? These are damnably hard questions to answer.\n\nMy first reaction, listening to it without headphones in a hotel room during a conference last weekend, was that it was an interesting curio. It was weird to hear John Lennon’s voice in a contemporary musical setting: pitch corrected and quantized, with a backing of heavily compressed, sample-augmented drums. I most probably “hmm”ed out loud.\n\nOver the course of several listens last Saturday, taking a solo walk around Venice during a couple of hours of blissful freedom from conferential duties, my resistance to the obvious digitalness of its existence started to drop away, and I began to find the interplay of young John’s and old Paul’s voices moving. Some of the arrangemental aspects still struck me as superfluous or poorly judged (I’m not really on board with Giles Martin’s string arrangement or those strummy electric guitar bits in the later verses that sound like hamfisted Nile Rodgers), but as a song it’s definitely grown on me.\n\nIt has some of that delicate, almost halting, beauty that the best seventies Lennon ballads have, all major sevenths and ninths in the vocal melody. That tune would have suggested to me a more restrained arrangement – something more akin to Woman, say. But Now and Then, despite the presence of Ringo on drums and some acoustic rhythm guitar recorded by George Harrison recorded in the mid-1990s, is McCartney’s baby, and McCartney is astute enough to intuit that if the song was to be released as a new recording by The Beatles, it had to sound Beatlesque. It needed some Beatles sonic signifiers – hence the strings and a slide guitar solo more or less in Harrison’s style, despite McCartney’s reported resistance to Harrison playing slide on the song during their attempts to record it in the 1990s.\n\nThe less cynical take on the latter would be that it’s a tribute to his friend from an older, wiser and more empathetic Macca, and that’s probably true too, but I can’t imagine how difficult it would be to go about creating an arrangement to an unfinished John Lennon song, knowing the world would pass comment on every single choice you make. The weight of expectation was surely felt, even by a man as experienced and secure in himself and his legacy as McCartney. Chucking in some George Martin strings and some Harrison slide probably seemed like a good, safe, Beatlesy bet. They don’t harm the song, even if they don’t help it to truly take flight either.\n\nIn all, Now and Then reminds me somewhat of Michael Stipe’s famous comment on post-Bill Berry R.E.M.: “a three-legged dog is still a dog, it just has learn how to run differently”. It’s a John Lennon song with extensive input from Paul McCartney as arranger and editor, and contributions from Harrison and Starr as instrumentalists. It’s not insulting, or a cash grab, or cynical, for it to bear “The Beatles” on its sleeve.\n\nBut it’s also other to the rest of the group’s catalogue, and not just in the circumstances of its creation: the use of new technology and so on. It’s other in the way Real Love and Free As a Bird are other. Part of what’s so narratively perfect about the The Beatles – for fans and pop culture historians – is how their career as a band is compressed into one decade, how they function as perfect shorthand for “the sixties”, how their various solo careers reacted against their shared history as The Beatles even while they continued to appear on each other’s records as musicians.\n\nNow and Then, and the two Anthology songs, exist outside all that.\n\nNow and Then is a demo of what would probably have been a pretty good late-period John Lennon song if he’d chosen to carry it to completion. As a finished recording in 2023, it’s also a pretty good song, albeit edited in structure, and there’s something that’s undeniably moving about McCartney, his voice audibly aged compared to Lennon’s, taking care of this piece of unfinished business as a tribute to his mate. As a musician who loves to tinker with old songs and recordings, often just for my own amusement, I totally get the impulse felt by McCartney to tidy up Now and Then and get it out there into the world. But as a Beatles fan, Now and Then – like Free As a Bird and Real Love before it – complicates the band’s legacy even as I enjoy the act of listening to it and don’t begrudge its existence for a second.\n\nI suspect we’ll be kicking this one around for decades to come. Ask me how I feel about it in 2043; I may have an answer for you by then.\n\nFor reasons of space, I’ve not wanted to get into the Peter Jackson and Disney of it all. Suffice to say, that’s also somewhat complicated.\n\nLawn rock was born, as we all know, in 1969, with the release of Fairport Convention’s Unhalfbricking. All the sonic and visual attributes we’ve come to associate with this most beloved of genres were there right from the start. When Richard Thompson headlines Glastonbury every year and Sandy Denny’s picture is on the £5 note, this album is why.\n\nYet, lawn rock’s first pioneers took a while to reach world-bestriding mega stardom. Consequently, the genre’s earliest commercial day in the sun didn’t arrive until two years later, when an actual real-life former Beatle – surely picking up on the vibes being created in Muswell Hill – released All Things Must Pass:\n\nHarrison added symphonic grandeur to lawn rock, along with evocative chord progressions, weighty religious ruminations, and also – just occasionally – hints of R&B and soul. As English as a country garden lawn rock may have been (and may still remain), but you never forget that Harrison grew up listening to Black American music. Neither did the Chiffons forget, but that’s another story.\n\nIn 1974, Van Morrison released Veedon Fleece – now universally recognised as his greatest work, better than Moondance, better even than Astral Weeks – and the Holy Trinity of lawn rock was complete. Morrison added his customary brand of Celtic country-gospel-soul, and a healthy dose of double-bass-driven jazz too. Improvisatory and questing, full of yearning for that which lies beyond language, Veedon Fleece busted lawn rock’s doors wide open. Now it could be anything.\n\nWe’ve had lo-fi lawn rock:\n\nWe’ve had psych-folk lawn rock:\n\nAnd even lawn pop:\n\nNow firmly established as the lingua franca of modern popular music, lawn rock is not without its critics. If you dislike the smell of new-mown grass, or you have a chlorophyll allergy, lawn rock is not for you. Yet it’s survived these fifty-odd years and will live fifty more, long after Richard, Van and those remaining lawn rock pioneers have hung up their guitars, cut the grass one final time, and put the mower away for another long winter.\n\n*\n\nIf you’re more than moderately awake, you’ll have twigged about halfway through the first sentence that there is no such thing as lawn rock. This whole blog post so far has been a mere flight of fancy.\n\nLawn rock was actually born one – presumably slower than usual – day at work when my former colleague Nick and I, tickled by a hotel called Llawnroc, ran with the pun and imagined a style of music called lawn rock. One of us, I can’t recall whom but I know I contributed Veedon Fleece, began digging out album covers from the hippie era featuring artists lounging on the grass and, hey presto, a new genre of music was brought into being, just like that.\n\nGenre naming is fun. It’s easy. Anyone can do it.\n\nDave Godin was the king of genre naming. He coined the phrases “Tamla Motown” and “northern soul”. The former – a portmanteau of two of Berry Gordy’s record labels (Godin is believed to used before anyone else when naming his Tamla Motown Appreciation Society) – is a quasi genre unto itself. The latter is undeniably a genre; “northern soul” is referred to as such by music fans from all over the world, not just in the UK.\n\nGodin had a record store in London’s Covent Garden area, and he noticed that when visiting football fans from the north of England came to his shop before going to watch an away game, they tended to pick up a certain kind of music: they weren’t as interested in Motown as they were harder, faster and slightly tougher music that was released by smaller American labels. He began to refer to these more obscure small-label soul records as “northern soul” to help his staff focus on selling the right kind of music to those fans. It should be stressed, the “northern” part of the genre name refers to fans in one country where the music was received; not the creators in the country where the music was actually made.\n\nThis seems, on its face, bass-ackwards. Why would people who couldn’t place Wigan or Blackpool on a map continue to call a style of music by a name that refers to what hip kids liked to dance to in former ballrooms in towns and cities in the north of England, 50-odd years ago? Because “northern soul” fulfilled a taxonomical need that fans hadn’t necessarily been aware of until the minute they came across the phrase and realised that it gave a name to something amorphous but nevertheless distinct from other forms of soul music. It helped to encapsulate something they cared about, putting it in a neat taxonomical box that made it easier to talk about.\n\nUltimately, that’s all genres are: convenient shorthands. When Hunter Stair, JD Ryznar and David B Lyons made the first Yacht Rock sketch, they were playing with the same idea as Dave Godin had (in a more ironic, self-aware way) by retrospectively tagging existing music with a new genre name. And it once again caught on widely, despite initial resistance from some long-time fans and even some of the music makers involved, because of its sheer utility.\n\nIn the late noughties, internet culture led to a proliferation of genre-naming activity on Twitter and Tumblr, some of which got picked up outside the message boards and subreddits from which they’d emerged. Some were little more than in-jokes: vaporwave was explicitly an ironic variant of chillwave that riffed on the idea of vaporware (software that doesn’t exist) to create a genre of music that didn’t exist. Except, as soon as the term was coined, it did exist.\n\nOthers, such as the much-mocked seapunk, had such a novelty value that it was impossible to tell whether anyone involved saw them as anything more than a meme. Perhaps it was all just a game played with signifiers by people who spent too much of their lives online.\n\nBut because ultimately genre names are nothing more than taxonomic tools that facilitate the flow of ideas, sometimes tagging older music with a new genre name can reveal hidden similarities and kinships, or place the music into new contexts that allow us to hear it afresh.\n\nWe’ve got a lot of pop music history now, a lot of accumulated received wisdoms. Anything that allows us to hear the music without the weight of those handed-down commonplaces can only be a good thing. So I’d encourage anyone to get into lawn rock, then create a few more genres when they’re done.\n\nThanks to Yo Zushi.\n\nI’ve been listening a lot to All Things Must Pass and The Concert for Bangladesh recently for a long-form writing project I’m doing, and I’ve really been hit hard by some of the songs on a musical level.\n\nNow, I’m a George Harrison fan, but I’ve not really listened to All Things Must Pass properly in, I don’t know, over 10 years – probably somewhere around 2008 was when I got a copy and dived into it properly – and I’ve never until this week sat down and tried playing any of his songs.* While I could tell from listening that a lot of them had unorthodox chord sequences, this is the first time I’ve sat down and learned them. And well, what a way with chords Harrison had.\n\nI’d Have You Anytime\n\nThis Harrison/Dylan cowrite, with a verse by Harrison and a chorus by Dylan, alternates between 4/4 and 3/4, and has some beautiful changes, particularly the Gmaj7/Bbmaj7/Cm7 progression that forms the basis of the verses’ 4/4 sections. Dylan, too, holds his own with the modulations from D to C and back to D via an A major. The melody reinforces the unexpected A major by moving from a C over an F chord to a C# over the A. Really good stuff from both guys.\n\nIsn’t It a Pity\n\nThis might actually be the best chord sequence ever. I’ve learned it in a couple of keys**, and it’s just glorious. It’s the little details in the voice leading and, again, the way that the vocal melody acknowledges the extensions and colours in the chords that really makes the whole thing sing; that drop in the melody to acknowledge the flat 3rd in Gdim7 when Harrison sings “how we break each other’s hearts” is goosebump stuff. Isn’t It a Pity is really only one chord sequence repeated again and again for six minutes, but when it’s as strong as this one, it’s hypnotic rather than boring.\n\nWah-Wah\n\nPut him in a rock/R&B context, and George still loved a nice chewy chord change. Wah-Wah has a few: the move from F#7 to the parallel minor; the unexpected B7 to D7; and the even more unexpected move from D7 to D9b5. Listen for those unexpected dissonant notes in the backing vocals, the flat fifth especially.\n\nBeware of Darkness\n\nAlong with Long, Long, Long, this is my favourite George Harrison song. What a trip the chord progression is. The intro, a held B, gives you no idea that you’re about to drop down to a G7 to begin the verse, or that you’ll then climb a semitone to G#m. Overall, I guess you’d say the song is in B, so the move to G#m makes sense in the overall sequence, but when you first hear the song the shift from B to G7 and the to G#m does feel like Harrison is pulling the rug out from under you on a pretty much bar-by-bar basis. It’s a wonderfully creative and imaginative sequence, and once again, the key to how it all hangs together is the melody; the dominant note of the tune in the first part of the verse is B – the major third of G7 and the minor third of G#m, and the only tone the chords share.\n\nClever George.\n\n*I’m not really in the habit of learning other people’s songs anymore, but I’ve been playing more guitar since the start of lockdown, and have found myself reaching for a guitar to work stuff out when I hear a riff or chord change or something that grabs my ear.\n\n**Feeling lazy, I got started by going here rather than working out for myself. I’ve varied a couple of chord shapes slightly, but I think it’s pretty accurate.\n\nMelanie Crew and I have recently released our first joint EP! Here it is, if you’d like to have a listen:\n\nSo Paul McCartney’s a good bassist, huh? Well, thank you, Captain Obvious.\n\nOK, I know picking a McCartney performance isn’t controversial, but this series isn’t called Underrated Bass Players I Have Loved, otherwise you’d have had a series of posts from me about Fred Abong, Jason Moulster and Steve Boone.\n\nThe point is, McCartney’s genius in all its forms – singer, songwriter, bass player, guitarist, arranger, producer – is taken for granted these days. It’s not just his accomplishments as a songwriter that are simply filed away as something everybody knows about. While a quick Google search for “Paul McCartney’s best bass lines” will pull up dozens of articles about the man, almost all of them concentrate on the most obvious stuff: his work on songs such as Something, Taxman, Hey Bulldog, Come Together and Tomorrow Never Knows. These articles don’t actually help all that much; they don’t encourage us to listen, and just reinforce old news and received opinions.\n\nTo get Macca as a bassist, the thing to do is to throw yourself into some Beatles albums, to hear the stylistic breadth his playing covers, and how his playing elevates even The Beatles’ least legendary records.\n\nTo illustrate this, I could have picked one of several dozen songs, but let’s look at Fixing a Hole, from Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\n\nFixing a Hole has a sparse arrangement, in which the two key instruments are harpsichord (played, it would seem, by George Martin) and bass guitar: there is no rhythm guitar, as John Lennon plays maracas on the recording.\n\nAround this time in The Beatles’ career, McCartney had taken to recording his bass guitar last, on its own track. This allowed him to size up the rest of the arrangement (which had begun to be arrived at via a more accretive process during recording, as the band only really existed as a recording entity after they retired from touring) and fill whatever spaces were still available. On Fixing a Hole, recorded at Regent Sound Studios, the band tracked live, so McCartney’s playing is a little more raw and spontaneous-sounding than on some of the other Pepper tracks (there are, not flubs exactly, but inconsistencies). Nonetheless, it’s beautifully constructed.\n\nAfter the intro, once Ringo’s swung hi-hat figure reveals the opening harpsichord figure as a rhythmic fake-out, McCartney begins with the simplest-possible two-note bass line, which actually makes the dreamy verse’s chord sequence sound simpler than it is. After four measures of alternating Fs and Cs, McCartney begins playing a syncopated melody that leaves the downbeat open. It’s a gorgeous little detail; as he sings of letting his mind wander “where it will go”, his bass guitar goes wandering too.\n\nIn the choruses, he plays a busier, more insistent line that bounces along between F and C in the first half and C and G in the second. Throughout the song – even with it’s cool lead guitar from George Harrison and characterful harpsichord playing from George Martin, it’s McCartney’s bass that both pushes the song along and glues it all together.\n\nThe man is every kind of musical genius.\n\nWe’re back in the musical multiverse this week – that place where two or more recordings of well known songs exist, each throwing light upon the other. This time, we’re going to Carolina. In our minds, natch.\n\nThe Beatles had a record label, Apple, and probably every young artist in the world wanted to be on it in 1968. The first eager young musician who actually was signed by Apple was James Taylor. Taylor and Peter Asher (brother of Paul McCartney’s girlfriend, Jane Asher) had a mutual friend, guitarist Danny Kortchmar, and he gave a tape of Taylor’s music to Asher, who was Apple’s head of A&R. Asher liked it, played it to McCartney and George Harrison, who also liked it, and Taylor was signed to Apple, with Asher overseeing the sessions for what would become his 1968 solo debut, James Taylor.\n\nIt’s a bit of a mess, a callow approximation of The Beatles’ psychedelic sound made just at the point that they’d started to move away from it. Among the songs on the record were two that became Taylor standards: Something in the Way She Moves and Carolina in My Mind, both quite different recordings to the ones you’re likely to hear on the radio.\n\nSomething in the Way She Moves is the more successful of the two. It has a rather pointless pseudo-Baroque harpsichord intro, but once that’s out the way, it’s a fairly straight rendition, with Taylor’s guitar panned left and his voice in the centre, mixed loud and dry. The rather airless mix does expose how limited a singer he was at this point, but it’s a much better record than the original Carolina in My Mind, which takes an excellent song, puts two Beatles on the recording (McCartney on bass, Harrison among the backing singers), and somehow makes a stinker. Taylor’s vocal performance can’t take the weight of the overstuffed arrangement, the chipmunk backing vocals are way too loud and irritatingly persistent in the mix, and even the tempo is off, the song taken too quickly to give Taylor any chance to do anything with the phrasing.\n\nIn 1976, Taylor re-recorded both songs for a retrospective compilation, Greatest Hits. It’s often said that this was due to rights problems with the originals, but given how much the new versions improved on the 1968 versions, highlighting Taylor’s improvement both as a singer and guitar player over the eight intervening years, it seems just as likely that Taylor was glad of the chance to take another stab at them.\n\nCarolina in My Mind, particularly, was revealed as a masterpiece in its new incarnation. The best arrangemental idea from the original – McCartney’s bass part – was copied more or less exactly for the new version, but this time was played by Lee Sklar, who was joined by Russ Kunkel on drums, Byron Berline on fiddle, Andrew Gold on harmonium, Clarence McDonald on piano and Dan Dugmore on pedal steel – exactly the guys, in other words, you’d expect to do a great job on a song like this. All of the unnecessary fripperies of the first version, meanwhile, were excised. In the producer’s chair again was Peter Asher, and you wonder how much he felt relieved to be given a second chance to do right by the song.\n\nThe 1976 re-recording is, well, very 1976, and it contains little of the darkness and confusion and humanity that makes Fire & Rain the only other James Taylor song I really have much use for, but it’s impossible to pick an argument with a song with such a beautiful melody line, and an arrangement so perfectly realised.\n\nA perfect, definitive, best-of-all-worlds recording doesn’t exist. Not outside of the imaginations of Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, at any rate.\n\nWhatever direction a song is taken by a team of artists and producers during its production, different decisions could have been taken at every single step of the process, any one of which may have in some small way made for a better or worse end result. The crazy thing is how little we as listeners ever really think about that when we listen to our favourite songs.\n\nEven music obsessives only really confront this when we’re listening to the alternate versions, different mixes and demo versions that fill up the second disc of two-CD special editions of classic albums. (And yes, I know you do. You wouldn’t be here otherwise, would you? It’s OK. You’re among friends.)\n\nLet’s enter this hall of mirrors, this musical multiverse, where every decision that is taken could have gone another way and resulted in the world knowing an entirely different end product.\n\nWhat’s Going On – Marvin Gaye (Detroit Mix)\n\nOne of the best tracks off one the best albums ever made. A masterpiece of a song and recording. Surely any competent presentation of it would have resulted in a killer record? And yet.\n\nListen to the “Detroit” mix of the title track, done in Gaye’s absence by Motown staff engineers at Hitsville USA, Detroit, available on 40th Anniversary “Super Deluxe” version of the album. It’s the same tracking as on the album mix we know and love, it’s still a great song, it’s still a very fine record. The mix is lucid and the key decisions – to place the two lead vocals in opposite channels to allow them to play revealed without the different phrasings stepping on each other, for example – are defensible. But play it against the LA mix that made it to the album and the song seems palpably diminished in its Detroit form.\n\nIt’s not just the approach to panning and the general topology of the mix that isn’t optimal here. The LA version is pristine, light and airy in a way the Detroit version just isn’t. The Detroit mix is compromised somehow. It just doesn’t soar. But no console has a “soar” fader – it was flesh-and-blood people who made What’s Going On as we know and love it. People with good ears and fertile auditory imaginations, and possibly better consoles and equalisers. Hearing this, it’s immediately why Gaye felt more could be extracted from the masters and insisted the Detroit versions be canned.\n\nEverybody’s Been Burned – David Crosby/The Byrds\n\nEverybody’s Been Burned, Crosby’s first great song, had apparently been written as far back as 1962 in Crosby’s folk-club days (the year of the first Bond film, Dr No, so the song’s 007-theme chord sequence may have been a mere coincidence) and was demoed several times before it found its way on to a Byrds album (1967’s Younger than Yesterday – probably their best record).\n\nThe band’s recording of it, distinguished by bass playing by Chris Hillman of intuitive genius, is one of the best things they ever did, but having spent some time with this demo version, available on a compilation called Preflyte Plus, I’m basically convinced that this rough recording is the best version that exists, better even that that spine-tingling album take. Everything that would blossom in Crosby’s work is in here, and in a neat historical curlicue, this rough demo weirdly presages the version that would be cut 30 years later by the king of lo-fi acoustic balladry himself, Lou Barlow (on Sebadoh’s wonderfully titled Smash Your Head on the Punk Rock).\n\nSon of Sam – Elliott Smith\n\nSpeaking of Barlow… Despite many similarites, and despite the fact that they knew each other and were friendly, Elliott Smith was not Lou Barlow. Barlow has released an absolute ton of material officially, and has given away even more on his website. If you want to hear the drum version of Puzzle from Emoh, Barlow’s cool with that. He made it available on his website. (It’s not got the arrangemental details of the Emoh version, but it’s very nice.)\n\nSmith never did that. There have now been nearly as many Elliott Smith songs released after his death as there were when he was alive, but as for what permission he may have given for all this, who can say? Lawyers’ statements. Rumours. The truth resides in neither.\n\nAs a fan, though, much of what has been released since his death in 2003 (on From a Basement on the Hill, New Moon and now the soundtrack to documentary Heaven Adores You) seems to me to be weak: songs that tread the same ground as other, superior songs that we know he was satisfied enough to release, because they came out in his own lifetime. Why wasn’t High Times (also sometimes called Coma Kid) not released on Elliott Smith? Probably because Needle in the Hay used the same 8th-note downstroke strumming, and was much better. Would Smith have wanted us to hear this recording of High Times, given that he didn’t see fit to use it on the album? Depends who your source is.\n\nSo listening to this stuff is a morally complicated matter, and an often unsatisfying experience musically, except in an academic sense (hearing the unused stuff does, it can’t be denied, sharpen your appreciation of the work that made the cut). Sometimes, though, a true gem appears, which only makes things worse from an ethical point of view as a fan, as I genuinely have no idea whether Smith would have been cool with people hearing this stuff.\n\nMuch of the pre-release buzz about the soundtrack to Heaven Adores You was about it being the first time the song True Love would be appearing on an official release. But True Love really isn’t all that much of anything. Far more intriguing is the acoustic version (it sounds a bit too considered to called a demo) of Son of Sam. Smith’s guitar playing is especially impressive. I’m not sure whether he’s in standard tuning or not, but the inversions and droney voicings he uses for many of the chords make the song sound very different from the way it does on Figure 8. It’s Son of Sam as Smith might have recorded it if it had been written in 1994 or 1995. It’s fascinating to hear a song that became a pretty big production rendered in the simplest way possible, and being equally effective as it was in its studio incarnation.\n\nWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps – The Beatles\n\nThe phenomenon of emptying the vaults in the name of revenue generation began in earnest with the Beatles’ Anthology project.\n\nThere were three double-CD Anthology releases, and they were a mixed bag indeed. Much of what was included was banal in the extreme: an alternate take of Kansas City-Hey Hey Hey Hey where the only difference is that the band hadn’t warmed up yet? Hmm, could have lived without that one. But the glimpse into the evolution of, say, Strawberry Fields Forever was stunning. As you listen to John Lennon strumming the chorus hesitantly on a guitar in his house, you realise just what kind of work it took to turn that half-formed thing into Strawberry Fields as we know it; hundreds of hours of combined effort by the band members, the producer and the engineering staff, making one inspired contribution after another, doing things with tape editing that defy belief.\n\nFor many fans, though, the greatest treat of all was hearing George Harrison’s demo of While My Guitar Gentle Weeps, with a simple acompaniment of acoustic guitar and harmonium. Taken at a faster pace than the album cut and in a lower key, allowing Harrison to sing higher, it’s a much lighter experience than the White Album cut, which is slower and squarer, and weighed down further by its overly literal lead guitar work by a guesting Eric Clapton. Yes, Eric, we get it. Your guitar is weeping, now kindly be quiet.\n\nIf you want to hear how it should be done, click on this, wait three and half minutes and let Prince melt your face. RIP, little dude.\n\nOnly one image I could post really. Prince, in face-melting form at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 2004\n\nI hoped that Todd Rundgren was going to be one of my guys. I absolutely loved I Saw the Light from the first time I heard it, years before I knew who’d made it or what else he’d done, so eventually I purchased Something/Anything? thinking it was going to be the place to get started on Todd properly, confident that he was going to become one of my very favourite songwriters.\n\nUnfortunately, Something/Anything? wasn’t the front-to-back Laura Nyro/Carole King tribute I hoped it’d be. Something/Anything? is a bit of a mess, and if you go into it looking for a double album of 20 or so songs like I Saw the Light – the early girl group sound filtered through The Beatles (Rundgren’s slide playing is pure George Harrison) – you’ll be disppointed. It hops all over the place, from bizarre Gilbert & Sullivan spoofs to ill-advised cock rock.\n\nSo I never found it an album I could fall in love with in its entirety. But we’re talking about Todd Rundgren, and Rundgren is some species of genius, even if its not a consistent species. So as well as I Saw the Light, Something/Anything? gives us Sweeter Memories, Marlene, Torch Song, Hello It’s Me and, more than anything else, It Wouldn’t Have Made any Difference, a song so beautiful and aching in its sadness it goes a long way beyond melancholy, stopping short of desolate and ending up in striking a note that’s comforting. It’s a warm kind of sadness, regretful but not bitter, illuminated by some of the most gorgeous chord changes this side of Laura Nyro herself (those unexpected changes under the line “But those days are through” absolutely make the song).\n\nRundgren famously recorded the bulk of Something/Anything? on his own, playing all the instruments on sides 1 to 3 himself. His resourcefulness is impressive, and goodness knows he can sing, play guitar and write as well as anyone in pop music, but some of the songs suffer for not having been placed in the hands of really capable players; Couldn’t I Just Tell You, for example, is ill served by its author in its Something/Anything? incarnation, with its numerous feel and tempo changes utterly defeating Rundgren-the-drummer.\n\nIt Wouldn’t Have Made any Difference hits that sweet spot, common to so much successful lo-fi/one-man-band records, where the tension between the quality of the writing and the just-slightly-amateurish execution of it is charming and endearing. It makes you invest more in the song’s feelings and emotions somehow. It Wouldn’t Have Made any Difference just wouldn’t be the same if without its slightly unsteady rhythm track (drums centre, congas and tambourine on the left, chimes and other percussion on the right). The charm is how it plays against the lush backing vocals (again, all Rundgren) and Todd’s effortless lead vocal. Rundgren really was an exceptional singer in his youth.\n\nIt’s a shame that the rest of Something/Anything? doesn’t really match up to its first two songs, but when those songs are I Saw the Light and It Wouldn’t Have Made any Difference, to expect it to would be asking for the damn near impossible.\n\nTodd Rundgren, 1973\n\nTodd’s not the only guy who’s ever done the one-man-band thing:\n\nWith a straight face, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame inducted the Manhattan Transfer before The Beatles.* Really.\n\nSo absurd is the scale of The Beatles’ achievements within popular music that we sometimes put them in a box by themselves, lest we be unfair to everyone else by making comparisons. We talk about, say, Don McLean and James Taylor as singer-songwriters without acknowledging that, by any meaningful definition, John Lennon and Paul McCartney (and for that matter Stevie Wonder and James Brown) were singer-songwriters too. But Lennon and McCartney were Beatles, which makes them somehow other, a category unto themselves.\n\nWe’ve got the big picture right – they are incomparable within popular music. But our judgement of them is skewed in favour of the huge obvious masterpieces. Of course we bow down in awe before Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, Tomorrow Never Knows, Eleanor Rigby, Yesterday, Hey Jude and so on. Who wouldn’t? But The Beatles would have belonged to the ages if they’d never made another record after A Hard Day’s Night.\n\nOne of the chief pleasures of listening to The Beatles’ early records is to hear them tearing through styles and genres, delivering precociously accurate yet idiosyncratic takes on each of them, then moving on to the next thing. Girl group pop. Bakersfield country. Hollywood musicals. Hard R&B. They could do everything. As much as they were the originators of much of what we talk about when we talk about rock and pop music, The Beatles were the world’s greatest human jukebox, their ability to assimilate and mimic styles of pop honed in sweaty late-night gigs in Hamburg clubs and adrenalised lunch-time sets at the Cavern.\n\nLennon and McCartney had the two greatest rock ‘n’ roll voices Britain has ever produced, both of them with enough acid in their throats to strip paint off the wall if they so chose. Yet they could harmonise like angels too, switching from one to the other with the sort of ease most singers would kill for.\n\nProbably only McCartney could tell you what sparked the band’s collective interest in harmony singing. We know that he and Lennon were practised Everly Brothers imitators in their teens, and that hints of that influence are audible throughout their work, up to Let it Be, where they recorded Two of Us explicitly in the Phil-&-Don style. But the dominant influence vocally on The Beatles’ first few albums are The Shirelles and Smokey Robinson & the Miracles.\n\nBoys, a 1960s Shirelles single that The Beatles covered on Please Please Me with Ringo on lead vocal, features Lennon, McCartney and George Harrison singing three-part harmonies in call and response with Starr (in a dead-on recreation of the original arrangement). It’s huge fun, and all four throw themselves into it excitedly. It’s probably the least self-conscious, most satisfying vocal Ringo ever sang, and shows a band forthcoming about its influences.\n\nYou Really Got a Hold on Me is something else again. Recorded not much more than six months after Smokey Robinson & the Miracles’ own version, it sees Lennon and Harrison singing the verses with McCartney joining in on the high third part (taken on the original by Claudette Rogers) in the choruses. The rhythm section on the Miracles’ record is slightly more subtle than the Beatles were, but not by much, and this impression may just be because of the relative lack of low end on the Beatles’ early records. Vocally, though, Lennon’s lead is hugely impressive technically and emotionally, and McCartney and Harrison are magnificent in support. Lennon would probably not have accepted the compliment, as he was always rather insecure about his singing voice, but he’s every bit as good as Smokey was on the original.\n\nIf you don’t know the Beatles’ early albums, do check them out. The singles (which you can get on the Red album, or Past Masters Vol. 1 or the newly remastered and re-released 1) aren’t the whole story by a long way. Their first few records (everything up to Beatles For Sale) showcase the band’s full, enormously wide, musical range. As such, they are full of great harmony vocal performances, on both the original material and the covers. The couple of songs I’ve talked about just happen to be among my favourites.\n\nOf course, the band’s other achievements are so vast that we just consider their harmony vocals as a mere facet of what they did, but among everything else they did and were and represent, The Beatles are one of pop music’s finest harmony singing groups.\n\n*Six years before, in fact. Because the ability to travesty Edith Piaf and sing “ra-da-da-da-da” in perfect unison is presumably a greater achievement then anything the Beatles did."
