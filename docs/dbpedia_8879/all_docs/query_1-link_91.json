        "text": "Today, Yusuf / Cat Stevens has shared an endearing cover of “Here Comes The Sun” as a homage to the late George Harrison. The song arrives in tandem with Stevens’ announcement, that he has partnered with Dark Horse Records, the boutique record label founded by Harrison, and now operated by the esteemed Beatles’ sons, Dhani and David Zonshine.\n\nStevens’ cover of the Abbey Road classic doubles as an opportunity to remember Harrison just days before what would have been his 80th birthday. Stevens credits Harrison as having a profound influence on his musical and spiritual trajectory, stating via press release: “I’m happy to sing one of his songs, especially as it represents the returning light and hope to a seriously dark and broken world.”\n\nThe “Wild World” singer also added, “While most of my generation were just into the music, I was a bit like George, where music became the key to something much higher. Following the rages of the ‘60s, his consciousness was awakened, and George transcended to levels not many people ever get to experience. You can hear it in his lyrics, and see it in the way he lived and dealt with the material world–looking for a way out.”\n\nAccording to the artist’s press release, Stevens also has new material in the works. Additionally, Dark Horse Records will re-release seven classic albums, which showcase his career-defining material. Dhani offered, “Not only is Yusuf a great musical legend but his songs could not fit the Dark Horse mythos any better. From his back catalogue, through to the new music we can’t wait for you to hear.”\n\nThe son of the legendary Beatles guitarist concluded his statement by adding, “ Yusuf is without question one of the most influential singer-songwriters of all time, it is a great honour to be able to give his music a home on our humble yet historic label.”"
