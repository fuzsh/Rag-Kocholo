However, Billboard may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\n\nThe Beatles are still considered one of the most legendary bands ever, and fans can now revisit their legacy through a new biography, which spotlights the band’s lead guitarist, George Harrison. Philip Norman, an expert and seasoned author of all things Beatles (including Paul McCartney: The Life and John Lennon: The Life) is back again to delve into who Harrison was beyond the stage in what he’s titled George Harrison: The Reluctant Beatle.\n\nThe synopsis describes that Harrison “battled feelings of inferiority” despite his massive talent and success, which will be unveiled within the 512 pages.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nThe book was officially released Oct. 24 and aims to provide an in-depth look at one of the greatest guitar players in history. Norman uses decades-long research combined with all-access into Harrison’s life. Right now, you can get the book for 18% off on Amazon or pick up a copy from Walmart or Barnes & Noble."
