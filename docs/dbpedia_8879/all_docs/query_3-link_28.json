        "text": "Just a so-so review of this album by Mr. Smith. It didn`t matter much for Harrison as the album was No. 1 in Australia, Canada, Holland, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK and the US.\n\nIt has sold well over 6 million copies to date.\n\nRead on!\n\nLoads of talent, and yet…\n\nBy Alan Smith\n\nGEORGE HARRISON: ALL THINGS MUST PASS (Apple, STCH 639 stero; £4 19s 6d).\n\nGeorge Harrison’s three-album set “All Things Must Pass,” finding its way into the shops this week, will prove that its a long time since so much love and care and work have been wrapped into one package by one prolific artist.\n\nAs for the rest… who could turn away from the collected talents, on this album, of Clapton, Dave Mason, Pete Drake and Klaus Voormann, not to mention Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Alan White, Gary Brooker and others — plus Harrison himself?\n\nAnd yet…\n\nIt may be that within the fullness of time I may come to appreciate many more of the subtleties and the nuances involved (as I have before), but at this moment I am most of all struck by the unrelenting level and sameness of the mood on the entire set.\n\nSome of the numbers are undeniably weak, although brilliantly dressed.\n\nThe trouble is that so often they pull down the individual beauty of the other tracks to a point where I itched for some lift, some shock, something different.\n\nLike the McCartney album, all I can say is that “All Things Must Pass” stands head and shoulders above just about any other solo album released this year — but there’s still something missing!\n\nMany of the songs are the music of his mind: they search and they wander, as if in the soft rhythms of a dream, and in the end he has set them to words which are often both profound and profoundly beautiful.\n\nSIDE ONE begins with a wistful and touching song co-written by Dylan, I’D HAVE YOU ANY TIME, and is followed by the current Harrison hit single in the U.S., MY SWEET LORD.\n\nIn its own right this is a strong little song with a chunky-plunky feel, and a familiar tune that, although it seems to owe something to “He’s So Fine,” has the Hare Krishna chant thrown in for good measure. There are also Hallelujahs, and Harrison sings it in a low, moaning spiritual voice. It should have been a single.\n\nWAH WAH is an inconsequential song about the pop-star benefits of wah-wah guitar: one of the weaker tracks, although it’s not short on dressing.\n\nNext is ISN’T IT A PITY, another good number which this time catches the mood of aching tolerance of pain which Harrison can do so well. It builds and it builds and it builds with a slow monotomy; a ballad which will stand out from the album with the passing of the years.\n\nSIDE TWO: (the tracks are generally long) is opened by the up-tempo WHAT IS LIFE, which I’m sorry to say didn’t do too much for me, and then we’re into the second Dylan number IF NOT FOR YOU. This has the expected Dylan country thing, and the hook holds interest. Next: BEHIND THAT LOCKED DOOR, a song which stands out from this side and which is a tremendous piece of country-meets-Hawaii, which should be sent to Slim Whitman without further delay.\n\nLET IT DOWN is opened by some big fuzzy work on drums, organ and guitar until it settles into a quiet acid float, but the melody held little interest for me and I listened especially to the romantic delicacy and perception of Harrison’s words. No matter the quality of the music, his words never let him down.\n\nI was glad of the mental escalation of RUN OF THE MILL, a mid-tempo number; but it took SIDE THREE and the rumbling piano rolling dream of BEWARE OF DARKNESS to hold me again.\n\nAPPLE SCRUFFS is Harrison’s name for the girls who hang around the Apple steps in Savile Row, and it’s a Dylanesque, pacy piece with harmonica and a girlie chorus, followed by a meandering song-tale called BALLAD OF SIR FRANKIE CRISP, which may take a little longer for me to appreciate.\n\nNext is AWAITING ON YOU ALL, a rapid fire thumper with good chord progressions and again, one of the better tracks. ALL THINGS MUST PASS — the title track — is yet another slow number, and apart from some interesting guitar fills I didn’t find it particularly distinguished.\n\nSIDE FOUR has a simple and effective opener with some Pink Panther-type figures, called I DIG LOVE (which will also stand out with the passage of time); then there’s the up-tempo ART OF DYING; another arrangement of ISN’T IT A PITY which I found both moving and musically worthwhile; and then the impassioned hymn HEAR ME LORD.\n\nThis, also is a stand-out number within the whole set.\n\nThe final record of the three is a jam session for George and friends — mainly a continuing riff worked upon, and going on and on; or the fun of a little piece called IT’S JOHNNY’S BIRTHDAY.\n\nI was surprised, incidentally, to see Harrison credited as composer of this one. It may well be that Bill Martin and Phil Coulter, who wrote “Congratulations,” will have other thoughts!\n\nSumming up: it’s a beautifully musically-dressed album, and a revelation into Harrison’s tremendous ability with words. But somewhere along the line somebody fell in love with the idea of releasing a mammoth album.\n\nAnd often, its brilliance has been overshadowed by its average.\n\nIf you have a large collection of the following magazines, don`t throw them out, but contact me as I would be very interested in these: Creem, Circus, Hit Parader and Metal Edge.\n\nIf you have a music-related web-page where this fits – please make a link to the article. With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nHarrison talks about himself as a songwriter in this one and also mentions a couple of songs of his that I personally find must be some of the most beautiful songs ever written. To write a song like “Something” almost counts as an act of God in itself. A talented musician and composer gone too early.\n\nRead on!\n\nBeatle single – by George!\n\nAlan Smith`s NMExclusive with George Harrison\n\n1969 will end up being George Harrison`s year. He`s waited a long time for real recognition, has George, but his composition “Something” is released as a Beatles` single this week and it is destined to become a landmark in his acceptance both as an individual and as a songwriter of increasing style. He was never the personal pusher, but as a well-wishing observer since around 1960 I am happy that the standing-in-the-shadows bit seems at last to be over. As he told me: “I KNOW I`m writing better.”\n\n“The fact is, the more you do it — the better it becomes. And I’m doing it a lot. I just get the compulsion… like the other week, when I suddenly had the desire to write a country and western song, and I didn’t have any idea of its shape but I just had to do it.\n\n“I just knew, somehow, that there was a song there inside my head. And the big thing was just to get it out.\n\n“Like Donovan said ‘Songs are all around you. Just reach out and capture one.’\n\n“You know, its nice to talk about music occasionally, and remind people of what we really are. That was one of the big bugs about our previous tours — especially towards the last couple of years — in that we became a political thing. People forgot everything else.\n\n“We couldn’t go out on the road just like a pop band… like we were there just to sing a few tunes. It became all this bit about politics, and `what do you think of President de Gaulle’ and all that.\n\nRemind people\n\n“That’s why it’s nice to remind people that we are, basically, primarily musicians. And politicians, and anything else, secondly.\n\n“Some people tell me this ‘Something` track is one of the best things I’ve ever written. I don’t know! Maybe they’re right, maybe they’re wrong. It’s very flattering.\n\n“If there’s any reason, maybe it’s that now, I can get over more what I want to do. I like the exercise of songwriting. And I like being stimulated to composing something I hear, or think, or say, or read.\n\n“There was a period — about two years back – when I started believing that the whole universe was one big song. Things people would say… I’d think ‘Hey, that’s a song,’ and I’d go off and write it.\n\n“I feel it’s only a matter of me becoming more aware as a Beatle and as a person. Anybody can do anything if they set their mind to it. I did.\n\n“I’ve said it before, but one of the real reasons I started getting into composing is that I thought: “Well, if John and Paul can write songs…\n\n“When I first started at it, I used to forget to keep going and to finish things off. It’s like washing your teeth. If you’ve never washed your teeth before, it takes a bit of time to get into the habit. And then you just do it naturally.\n\n“The hang-up of playing my songs to John and Paul always used to hold me back, as I’ve said, because I knew how it would sound finished, and I had to try and convince them in one play.\n\n“For that reason, there are a lot of numbers of mine that I decided not to do anything about. It was a shyness — a withdrawal — and I always used to take the easy way out.\n\n“Now? Well, maybe I’m cocky! Because now, I don’t care if nobody else likes it. It’s a matter of taste. And maybe I don’t like some of their songs, either.\n\n“What I still do, though, is to bring out the numbers I think are the easiest to get across. The ones I think will take the shortest time to make an impact… the ones that’ll sound the nicest tunes.\n\nNatural break!\n\n“I remember when I came to do a song for the `Abbey Road’ LP, I did that one called `Here Comes The Sun’ because it didn’t need any real production. I must just go to the loo.”\n\nTwo minute break and a cup of tea.\n\n“As I was saying… about the LP. In future we’re going to get an equal rights thing, so we all have as much on the album.\n\n“I also thought of doing an album of my own mainly just to get rid of all the songs I’ve got stacked up. I’ve got such a backlog, and at the rate of doing two or three an album, I’m not even going to get the ones I’ve done out for three or four years.\n\n“I suppose I’m waiting till I’ve got myself a proper studio at home. And then I can just knock ’em off when I feel like it.\n\n“It’s a bit of a vicious circle, because I don’t want to get a studio fitted up until I move, and I’ve been trying to move for a long time. I’m still in Esher and I’ve been there for years… the house isn’t really big enough to have a proper studio. I’ve got all sorts of equipment together, but there’s hardly any room to move.\n\n“I think at home would be the ideal place for me to record. I hate the hang-up of booking a studio. And I think it’s the same with many artists… I`ll bet they sing their songs much better at home, where they’re completely relaxed. “I know that if I were doing it like that I’d probably do it more like the Plastic Ono Band, where you just bash away! I know I’ve got demos of things that went on that Beatles’ white album that were much better. “It’s like `Revolution.’ Even though we did two versions of it, I still think the best version is the one I’ve got at home on tape, which we did just on an Ampex four-track machine with acoustic guitars, and Ringo just bashing on marraccas or something in a corner.\n\n“Summing me up, I don’t mind admitting that I definitely USED TO BE self-conscious. But now I’ve got less hang-ups about everything, not just music.\n\n“I wrote ‘Here Comes The Sun’ in Eric Clapton’s garden — name dropping! — and it was done just about the time we had all those business meetings and I had headaches. So one day I stayed off, didn`t come in, and went to Eric`s because it’s nice with trees and things. And in that setting, the song just came right out.\n\n“`Something,’ I wrote towards the end of the double album, about a year ago now. I just got the bit about ‘Something in the way she moves,’ and then the chord progression seemed to follow naturally. I finished it early this year.\n\n“The words are nothing, really. There are lots of sings like that in my head. I must get them down. Maybe even other people would like to sing them.”\n\nIf you have a large collection of the following magazines, don`t throw them out, but contact me as I would be very interested in these: Creem, Circus, Hit Parader and Metal Edge.\n\nIf you have a music-related web-page where this fits – please make a link to the article. With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nIt is always wonderful, in my opinion, to find these very old articles with the late, great Mr. Harrison. He has written some wonderful music and has been important in my musical education. He lives on forever through his melodies!\n\nRead on.\n\nQuestion time with George Harrison\n\nBy Roy Carr\n\nQ: Do you miss “live” gigs?\n\nA: I have done… I always try and play as much as I can on sessions but it’s not the same, it’s the idea of being up there not knowing what you’re doing in front of a lot of people which is the fun of it.\n\nI hope that the Beatles will tour again, but it’s so difficult, not just to get us together to do it. I just couldn’t stand going through all the police and crowds and helicopters into the Shea Stadium and the scene that goes with it.\n\nIt’s like Dylan because I know that he’s gone through the cycle where he’s getting back into wanting to play.\n\nQ: Certain publications gave front page news that the Beatles together with the Stones, were going to jam with Dylan at the Isle of Wight… what happened?\n\nA: I’m sure that it was the promoters of the I.O.W. that gave the story just to help pull in more people, because Dylan would have been paid a certain amount of money so they really wanted to make a lot of bread there, you can’t blame them.\n\nSpeculation\n\nBut it was all just speculation. Like I played a little with The Band, but not on stage or anything, but while they were rehearsing for that gig. I’m quite friendly with them.\n\nQ: Do you intend to do any solo recordings like John has done with Yoko and the Plastic Ono Band, will there in fact be a George Harrison album?\n\nA: Possibly, but not really for the reason that I want to do my own thing, mainly because I’ve got so many tunes that I’d like to get them out; then I can go on to new things.\n\nQ: You seem a far more peaceful person than you did, say three years ago.\n\nA: Yes I am.\n\nQ: Do you find that a lot of the pressure is off?\n\nA: There’s a lot of pressure off here in England, but if it was publicised that I was going to be here then I would have to be in the dressing room instead of having a drink here with you.\n\nYou see that’s the difference between doing something like this gig and the Plastic Ono and appearing as the Beatles.\n\nQ: When I saw John, Eric, and the Ono Band In Toronto the sound that they got was similar to that of your earlier days.\n\nA: Well, it was because they were doing the Cavern tunes… “Blue Suede Shoes,” “Money,” and “Dizzy Miss Lizzy.”\n\nQ: Another thing I noticed was that the crowd was very well behaved.\n\nA: Generally I think pop crowds, especially the bigger they get, the more peaceful they become. To be fair to the British Press and police they did praise the kids at Hyde Park for both the Stones and Blind Faith shows.\n\nQ: Do many of your “friends” sit-in on Beatles recording sessions?\n\nA: We’ve done a few things, one where Brian Jones played with us, and it started to get that any friends who were around sat in.\n\nClapton\n\nEric, in fact, played on a tune of mine “While My Guitar Gently Weeps.” If there are any friends around then they can play.\n\nQ: I’ve noticed, that with the last few Beatles albums that they seem to take more repeated plays before you get into them.\n\nA: That’s good point. I’m glad you asked that because it means that it will last longer if you play it more and more and its gets better; because there’s a lot of music around that sounds really great and then you play it twice and then you’re not interested, I do it myself.\n\nI’ve found that the Band’s new album is one of those albums that grows on you the more you hear it… it’s so nice.\n\nQ: It’s become obvious that with each new Beatles album both the writing and performance has greatly matured.\n\nA: Well that’s life really, you’re supposed to get better. It’s like the Stones… “Honky Tonk Woman” is musically so good even though it’s only three chords, yet it’s really so good.\n\nQ: Apple only has very few artists on it’s books, would you like to feature more artists?\n\nA: Actually I’d like to have about four acts on Apple who were really great and that’s it. I’d like Apple to be The Beatles, Stones, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, and Delaney & Bonnie and that’s it… who needs anything else.\n\nOh yes, I think Billy Preston’s very good and eventually he’ll get through to the people.\n\nQ: It seems that some values seem to get distorted nowadays. It happens that an act can give a bad performance yet still receive a standing ovation just because they are “in,” yet many outstanding artists get overlooked.\n\nA: Yeah, it’s like Delaney & Bonnie, they’ve been playing this stuff for a few years, but it’s only now that the audiences are getting round to them.\n\nIt’s allright playing above an audience’s head if you`re not interested in an audience; it’s better to try and play something really better than the sort of music that they are normally used to and to try and bring them with you which is the whole process of evolution, to raise the standard of everything but not to leave anybody behind.\n\nQ: Do you find that since you’ve mixed and played with these other musicians that you view both your own and Beatle music in a different perspective?\n\nA: No, not really, we’ve always been influenced by anything good around us, or whatever we like rubs off on us, and then the moment we write a song and the Beatles record it then it becomes a Beatles tune.\n\nImitate\n\nIt could be that on some of our tunes we try and imitate somebody else. It’s like things in the early days. We recorded “Twist and Shout,” “You Really Got A Hold On Me,” people thought that they were our own songs and that we’d written them.\n\nIf as the Beatles we were to cover say Elvis` new record then it would be like a Beatles record. Even if we tried to copy it note for note we couldn’t: that’s why we got that sort of sound or whatever they thought was the Beatles sound.\n\nQ: When you are at home listening to records would you pull out an old Beatles album and play it?\n\nA: I think most people who make records go through a period where they don’t generally play their own stuff; they’ll play it when it’s new and then they are usually fed up with it by the time it’s released.\n\nBut I may play it after a year or two years, suddenly one night for some reason, like nostalgia. I may dig out something in particular just to check up because normally you think well that’s good at that time but you come back to it two years later just to try and relate with yourself.\n\nQ: Of all the Beatles sides that you’ve made is there any particular one that you feel that if you ever played as good as that again you’d be satisfied?\n\nA: No, I’ve never played half as good as I’d like to but there’s been total, like as a whole there are certain records that I have enjoyed and liked.\n\nThey all represent a certain time and a certain feeling and to take them out of context…\n\nIf you have a music-related web-page where this fits – please make a link to the article. With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nIf you listen to the track “Sour Milk Sea” by Jackie Lomax, written by Harrison, there is no doubt that the title of this interview is as correct as they come. The track is a really good early rocker, harder than most of those who haven`t heard it would believe.\n\nRead on!\n\nGeorge is a rocker again!\n\nHe confesses to Alan Smith\n\nTHROUGH rain, tempest and flood, George (` Hey Jude ‘ is at No. 1) Harrison drove up to London this week to join his mate Jackie Lomax for a cuppa tea and a chat. I sat with them in the new Apple offices in Savile Row, in comfort and style beneath the white angels and the cherubs frolicking on the ceiling in Georgian splendour. And as we talked, our chairs sank deep into the green Wilton that stretched miles towards the vast white walls of the beautiful room.\n\nIt was all very posh and awe-inspiring and – had I not been in the company of such normal people – I suspect, I might easily have succumbed to illusions of grandeur complaining about the terrible servant problem one gets in London these days.\n\nWe talked mainly around the theme of “Sour Milk Sea,” that boom-boom kick-in-the-stomach rocker which George wrote and produced and which Jackie sings on his Apple single released two or three weeks ago.\n\nThe idea of them getting together emerged somewhere around 1963, but the Beatles suddenly had a few other matters to attend to. Jackie left the Undertakers, kicked around, went to America and came back again, and, only now are he and George getting the time to work out ideas.\n\nI told George it had been a bit of a surprise to find him writing and producing this big rocking number, considering the aura of Indian influence he’d built up over the last couple of years. Was it a deliberate attempt to smash his image?\n\nGeorge: “This is the problem. You see, I’ve got my `Wonderwall` album coming out in a couple of weeks, and that’s very Indian-influenced.\n\nIt’s not me\n\n“But the thing with that is, I recorded it in December of last year and January 1968. I still like it. I still think it’s very good. But it’s not me.\n\n“I`m back to being a rocker now… for a bit, at least! You go through so many changes and realisations, and so often you come right back where you started.\n\n“I’ve realised another thing, that you can write a melody and it can be absolutely anything you like. It can become a jazz song, a folk song, a rock ‘n’ roll song — it can be anything. It just depends how you treat it.\n\n“For instance, you could sing `Long Tall Sally’ very sweet, or you could even do it as an Indian song if you wanted to. It’s really a matter of concept.\n\nInfluenced\n\n“I’ll tell you one of the things that influenced me in music in the last few months… around June I went to America because I’d promised to do a little part in this film of Ravi Shankar’s. And around that time I had my sitar, and something happened whereby we never got the flight back from Los Angeles, and we ended up going to New York for two nights.\n\n“Well, the general influence of the music… just to go to America… it has an effect. If I was to go to the States now, this week, I’d pick up something of the vibration of what’s going on.\n\n“What I got over there last time was like the thing of Electric Flag and all that. That’s what’s going on over there.”\n\nI said some people might feel what was a Beatle doing saying he was still greatly influenced by the pop music of others, when it was generally felt that the Beatles were themselves the Leaders of Influence.\n\nGeorge didn’t see it that way. Said he: “We are only a collection of all the things we’ve ever been influenced by. We don’t copy, of course. But the feel of the music in the States was heavy, and I happen to like that, and it just happened that when I got to New York there were people there like Jimi Hendrix and all of them and I really like what they’re doing.\n\n“After that I felt: Well, to go into one thing, you’ve got to neglect something else. For me to go into rock ‘n’ roll and become, a rock ‘n’ roll guitarist as I want to, I’ve got to neglect Indian music.\n\n“As for me working on the rock scene with Jackie, our general idea is just to do a lot of tracks to see what comes out next. We’re mainly doing Jackie’s compositions at the moment, not mine.\n\n“It’s a funny thing, but I wrote ‘Sour Milk Sea` in Rikishesh in ten minutes. I didn’t have a guitar in India, and John had a guitar, but was always playing it and there was only about ten minutes or half an hour, say, of an evening when I borrowed his guitar and wrote that song.\n\nAlways rock\n\n“Even though I was in India, I always imagined the song as rock ‘n’ roll. That was the intention.”\n\nAnd with sales of “Sour Milk Sea” gathering momentum and Jackie’s record looking as if it could do very well for itself if it doesn’t watch out, how does George rate its chances?\n\nAnswer: “I don’t think it’s an obvious hit, but I think it’s a very good record. The whole thing of it is very good, although I think that, in a way, it goes above the heads of some people. It’s not the type of record your mums and dads and all those type of people would buy – like a Mary Hopkin record.\n\n“The thing is, you either have the choice of trying to make a hit, or trying to do what you want to do. And we made that choice… Jackie’s whole thing is rock ‘n` roll, and we both like that heavy, tight sound.\n\n“We’re now thinking of all those people who like rock `n` roll music — and there’s a hell of a lot of people who just want to hear that boom-boom sort of thing.”\n\nNow he’s on his rock kick, however, how does George feel about some of his earlier, Indian-influenced work — “Inner Light,” for example?\n\nHe gives a grin. “That was one of my precocious things.\n\n“Very precocious, I am, when I get going.”\n\nIf you have a music-related web-page where this fits – please make a link to the article. With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nA very exciting interview with Mr. Harrison. He clearly evades some questions that are a lot tougher than what I think music journalists are allowed to ask stars of this magnitude these days. This one is really worth reading. Enjoy.\n\nThe dark horse rears his head\n\nAfter months of rumours and years of wishful thinking, George Harrison has finally hit the road. His massive tour will take in 27 American and Canadian cities for 50 concerts in under two months. It`s the longest tour ever undertaken by a former Beatle since the fragmentation of the band four years ago.\n\nHarrison held an hour-long press conference in the Champagne Room of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel to answer any questions. The room was cram-packed with reporters, television crews and photographers. He spoke about the Beatles, together and otherwise, drugs, the up-coming tour, his newly formed Dark Horse Records, his wife Patti who is living with Eric Clapton, his personal taste in music and much more.\n\nSOUNDS` ANDY McCONNELL was there.\n\nWhy, after all these years, have you decided to return to the States?\n\nI`ve been back here many times. This is the first time I`ve been back to work. It`s the first time I`ve had an H-1 visa since `71.\n\nWhat are the reasons for not having an H-1?\n\nI had the same problem as John Lennon. I was busted for marijuana back in `67 by Sergeant Pilcher.\n\nDid you have a hard time convincing the people to give you a visa?\n\nIt takes a long time, you know. A lot depends on Washington and how busy they are and they`ve been pretty busy lately. We applied for it months ago. It`s come through fine, but once the tour`s over I`ve got to get back.\n\nWhat are your feelings about the up-coming tour?\n\nI think if I had more time I`d be panic-stricken, but I don`t even have time to worry about it.\n\nWhat kind of material will you be doing on the tour?\n\nCouple of old tunes and a lot of new ones. The old tunes seem to have got slightly different arrangements. I`m gonna do “My Sweet Lord” and “Give Me Love”, but slightly different variations of them. They should be much more loose.\n\nWill Ravi open the show?\n\nNo, I`ll be opening the show, but it`s definitely not going to be a Bangladesh Mark II, if that`s what people are thinking.\n\nWill you be playing Britain and Europe?\n\nI`d like to. I tried to squeeze a concert in just before Christmas although all the halls were booked out. The feeling within the band is that we should do a gig in London. They`re saying, `let`s do 12 dates, let`s tour England, let`s tour Europe`. I want to go to Japan. I want to go everywhere. This year there`s too much for me to do and not enough time to do it in.\n\nIs there a paradox between your spiritualism and the atmosphere when you`re touring?\n\nIt is difficult, yeah. It`s good practise in a way, to be, as they say, in the world but not of the world. You can go to the Himalayas and miss it completely. Yet you can be stuck in the middle of New York and be very spiritual. I noticed some places like New York bring out a certain thing in myself while I found in places like Switzerland there were a lot of uptight people because they`re living in all this beauty, there`s no urgency in trying to find the beauty in themselves. If you`re stuck in somewhere like New York you have to look within yourself; otherwise you go crackers.\n\nDo you have any anxieties as the tour approaches?\n\nThe main one is that I`ve lost my voice, I mean to a degree. It`s getting a bit rough and gravely. There`s a good chance the first few concerts I`m gonna come out playing instrumentals (laughing).\n\nDo you have an album in the can?\n\nAlmost. I have a few things to do on it.\n\nWho plays on it?\n\nSome of the basic tracks I did last November. I had (Jim) Keltner, Ringo, Gary Wright, Klaus (Voormann). Some of the tracks I did this year with Willie Weeks, Andy Newark, Tommy Scott; the people in the band on tour with me.\n\nWhat`s the album entitled?\n\n“Dark Horse”.\n\nWhy was there such a gap between this album and “Living In The Material World”?\n\nI`ve been busy working. I was busy being deposed. I`ve been doing some tracks of my own, did the Splinter album, finished up Ravi`s album, been to India for two months, organised the music festival from India; I`ve done a million things.\n\nWhy don`t you grant personal interviews?\n\nThere`s nothing to say, really. I`m a musician, not a talker. If you get my album it`s like “Peyton Place”, I mean it`ll tell you exactly what I`ve been doing.\n\nWhen will it be released?\n\nWhen I`ve finished it.\n\nWhat are your hopes for your Dark Horse Records? Do you see it becoming very large?\n\nNo, no! I don`t want it to turn into a Kinney. I`d like it to be decently small.\n\nWhat artists do you hope to get on it?\n\nI don`t hope to get any in particular. To tell you the truth, I`ve been here just over a week, and if I signed all the people who gave me tapes, I`d be bigger than RCA and Kinney put together, but fortunately I don`t have time to listen to them all.\n\nDo you pay much attention to what the critics say?\n\nI cancelled all my newspapers five years ago, so I don`t really know what people say. If I do see a review of an album I`ll read it, although it doesn`t make too much difference what they say, because I am what I am whether they like it or not.\n\nAre you ever amazed at how much the Beatles still mean to people today?\n\nNot really. It`s nice. I realise the Beatles did fill a space in the `60s and all the people the Beatles mean anything to have grown up. It`s like anything; if you grow up with something you get attached to it. One of the problems in our lives is that we get attached to things. I can understand that the Beatles did nice things and it`s appreciated that people still like them.\n\nThe problem comes when they want to live in the past, when they want to hold on to something. People are afraid of change.\n\nHave you seen the play?\n\nYou mean `John, George, Harry, Ringo, Fred, Bert and Stigwood`? That`s been going on there but I haven`t had a chance to see it yet. I hear conflicting reports. Some people say that it`s lousy and they`re in tears because they say Brian Epstein is lousy, others say it`s fantastic, Brian comes off like an angel. I`ll have to see it when I get a day off.\n\nAre you involved in any serious negotiations to get the Beatles back together for one night?\n\nNo, you`ve been reading Rolling Stone.\n\nWhat did you think of that article?\n\nThe point is, it`s all a fantasy, the idea of putting the Beatles back together again. If we ever do that, the reason will be that we are all broke. There`s more chance that we`ll do it because we`re broke than because… and even then, to play with the Beatles… I mean, I`d rather have Willy Weeks on bass than Paul McCartney. That`s the truth, with all respect to Paul. The Beatles was like being in a box, we got to that point. It`s taken me years to be able to play with other musicians. Because we were so isolated it became very difficult playing the same tunes day in, day out.\n\nSince I made “All Things Must Pass”, it`s just so nice for me to be able to play with other musicians, and having played with other musicians, I don`t think the Beatles were that good. I think they`re fine, you know.\n\nRingo`s got the best back beat I`ve ever heard. He hates drum solos. Paul is a fine bass player, he`s a bit overpowering at times. John`s gone through all his scene but he feels like me, he`s come back around. We`re all at that point. I mean, to tell you the truth, I`d join a band with John Lennon anyday, but I couldn`t join a band with Paul McCartney, but it`s nothing personal. It`s just from a musical point of view.\n\nHow did you choose the musicians in your own band?\n\nI didn`t really choose them… so many things in my life I don`t really do; I just feel like an instrument. I knew I was doing a tour and I knew I had to have a band, but I didn`t want to commit myself to anybody, I just let things roll on. I only met Andy Newmark and Willie Weeks a few months ago. If I hadn`t met them, I wouldn`t have a rhythm section, but I believe the Lord provides me or you or all of us, if you believe that, he provides you with whatever you need.\n\nWhat is your relationship with John and Paul?\n\nIt`s very good, actually. I haven`t seen John because he`s been in the States although I`ve spoken to him over the phone. He seems like he`s in great shape. I just met Paul again and everybody`s really friendly, but that doesn`t mean we`re going to form a band.\n\nLet me change the subject… Are you getting a divorce?\n\nNo, that`s as silly as marriage.\n\nDid you make any musical rebuttal to “Layla”?\n\nPardon?! How do you mean, musical… what rebuttal! That sounds nasty. Eric Clapton`s been a close friend for years. I`m very happy about it, I`m still very friendly with him.\n\nSeriously? How can you be happy about it?\n\nBecause he`s great. I`d rather she was with him than with some dope.\n\nWhat`s your attitude on drugs now?\n\nDrugs? Got any? What drugs? Aspirin? What are you talking about? What do you define as drugs? Whisky? I don`t want to advocate them because it`s so hard to get into America.\n\nWhat do you consider to be the crowning glory so far in your musical career?\n\nAs a musician? I don`t think I`ve got any yet. As an individual, just being able to sit here today and be relatively sane. That`s probably the biggest accomplishment to date.\n\nWho are some of the contemporary artists that you admire most?\n\nSmokey Robinson, I`m madly in love with Smokey Robinson. There`s so many of them. I like Dicky Betts. I think Ry Cooder is sensational.\n\nWhat about Stones?\n\nYeah, the Stones, you know, they`re fine, you know; nice. I like the Stones. Variety`s the spice of life.\n\nCan you see a time when you`ll give up being a musician?\n\nI can see a time when I`d like to give up this kind of madness, but I`d never stop music. Everything`s based on music.\n\nI have personally transcribed this from the original paper. Any errors in the text from the original magazine may not have been corrected for the sake of accuracy.
