        "text": "By Mike Carrera\n\nA fan recently asked which was the best Harrison “promo clip compilation” and my response was: NONE to date (official or bootleg).\n\nA good effort was the one by the DVD-R bootleg label FAB Productions, who released a 3 disc set many years ago. The downside point is that many videos there, comes from TV broadcasts with station logos, missing slates, low quality on many clips, and missing dozens of versions and adding clips from concerts or TV shows, or even fake fan-created videos.\n\nIn 2016, the European bootleg label BFB/Wonderland/Walrus Entertainment was a direct copy of the FAB’s 3 DVD-R collection from 2010, even with the same menus.\n\nSo, to date, no bootleg label have released the ULTIMATE compilation.\n\nOn the official side, we have three boxes including a few, but not all of Harrison’s videos: “The Apple Years”, “The Dark Horse Years” and “The Traveling Wilburys Collection”.\n\nThe problem with those videos on the official releases is that the original audio of many of them have been replaced by the commercially remastered versions, replacing the original mixes, and the bootleg labels have copied exactly THAT version because of the high visual quality. Sometimes, however, the video is also different from the original version and the bootleg makers and some of the fans haven’t noticed it.\n\nThis is a humble research of all available Harrison official videos, including the alternate versions and variations, many of them uncirculated or unbootlegged to date, as well a few revelations and stories TOLD and published FOR THE FIRST TIME. Any corrections/mistake reports are so welcome.\n\nYouTube links are illustrative only, not the researched sources. Almost all videos are 4:3 ratio and a few are 16:9 Widescreen, but for some settings reason, my “photo capture” tool copied all in 16:9, simply ignore this.\n\nMike Carrera\n\n1971\n\nMy Sweet Lord (live)\n\nSadly, no official video for this song was ever filmed, but the live performance from The Concert for Bangladesh on 1 august, 1971, directed by Saul Swimmer was plugged many times over the years on TV channels, the only difference with the film is that the video features a fade out after George says “Thank you..thank you”. The best quality source for this was probably when the film was re-released in 2005 and the clip was shown many times on music channels like MTV and Much Music.\n\nMany bootleg compilations use a “manufactured” video from the UK TV show “Top of the Pops” from 1971, where the dancing troupe Pan’s People did a choreography for this song. This very same footage was used on another fake youtube video for “My Sweet Lord (2000)”, editing in some footage from the “All Things Must Pass 30th” EPK and, at some point inserting the Pan’s People footage. Bootleg labels have released it over and over but there is NO official video for the re-recorded version as well there is no one for the original. In the Netherlands, another popular TV show from the 60’s and 70’s: TopPop, produced a “video” in 1970 using some photographs taken from the “Let it Be” book plus some other footage, but again, no official Apple video was ever made.\n\nBoth clips from the shows “Top of the Pops” and “TopPop” are available.\n\nAnother FAKE fan-created video for the song “Give me Love (Give me Peace on Earth)” is available on some bootleg compilations, be aware it’s not a real promo video, although it uses very rare 8mm footage. And we have not counted the version from Live in Japan 1991 (included on the official “The Apple Years” boxed set) as a promo video.\n\n1974\n\nDark Horse\n\nPromotional video filmed with a brief but live performance (lasting only 1:53) during rehearsals for the 1974 U.S. tour. Available with a countdown “slate” in good quality among collectors or low quality at youtube and some bootleg compilations. It was omitted from the official boxed set “The Apple Years”.\n\nDing Dong, Ding Dong\n\nThe video was directed by Harrison and filmed by Nick Knowland at Friar Park, Henley-On-Thames, George’s mansion. For the video he once again wore two Beatle suits: the grey collarless suit and the Sgt Pepper uniform.\n\nThe common version available on almost all bootleg compilations comes from the Australian RAGE music TV show from a 90’s rebroadcast (with logo and credits over the image), but a clean copy is available among collectors.\n\nWhen it was released on the official “Apple Years” boxed set, although restored to best possible visual quality, there is a mistake during the restoration: the first two seconds shows the picture decolorized and at the third second, the image goes black for a moment; this visual problem has nothing to do with the master copy being damaged or something like that, since the original print that is available or the rebroadcast on RAGE and other TV specials over the years didn’t have this problem, so, if we want the best and complete version, sadly it’s not on the official boxed set.\n\n1976\n\nCrackerbox Palace\n\nFilmed at Friar Park, Henley-On-Thames. Directed by Eric Idle (Monthy Python/The Rutles).\n\nCameos from Monthy Python’s : Eric Idle, Neil Innes, Michael Palin, John Cleese and Graham Chapman, among others; plus Olivia Arias in black lingerie (at 2:23) .\n\nTrue Love\n\nFilmed at Friar Park, Henley-On-Thames, also directed by Eric Idle. For some reason it wasn’t included on the official “The Dark Horse Years” boxed set.\n\nAnother video deemed “best” version around is taken from the Australian video show RAGE (with the logo on screen at some point plus the credits of the song), but a CLEAN version with correct color (Rage’s version is saturated, even if it seems better) is available among collectors.\n\nThis Song (Variation A)\n\nThis Song (Variation B)\n\nDirected by George Harrison and Michael Collins for Rosebud Films. Cameos from Ron Wood and Eric Idle (both dressed as women /Monthy Python’s characters), Jim Keltner (future drummer for the Traveling Wilburys) as the Judge, Neil Innes, among others.\n\nTwo slightly different versions are available: Variation A shows the credits for “This Song” over the intro while Variation B is clean and can be found in top quality on the “Dark Horse Years” boxed set and standalone DVD, and sadly is the common version that appears on most recent bootleg compilations leaving out the original version which is available in very good quality and also have the outro credits for “Rosebud Films”.\n\nHere is Variation B:\n\n1979\n\nBlow Away\n\nDirected by Neil Innes (Monthy Python/ The Rutles). Contrary to what’s written in the book “Eight Arms to Hold You” that the film was shot by early March 1979; the promo was in fact filmed by the end of November or early December 1978 and the first master was assembled by the end of 1978 but was put on hold until next year and it seems a “fix” was made since the new slate, mastered on February 21, 1979 says “Final Mix”. Still, the audio is the same as the “1978” version, the only noticeable “difference” could be that there is a Warner Bros logo at the intro plus a very quiet “beep” cue which can be heard before the song starts, plus, once again a Warner Bros logo at the end with the 1978 copyright, and the “1979” version does not have the Warner Bros logo intro or finale, but is exactly the same audio mix and video edit.\n\nAnother video that was omitted from the official “Dark Horse Years” boxed set.\n\nFaster\n\nFilmed between February 4 and April 8, 1979 at the Grand Prix races in Sao Paulo, Brazil; Kyalami, South Africa; Long Beach, USA and some shots also apparently filmed in Milan, Italy and other unidentified car races. George’s chauffeur in the video is Formula 1 driver Jackie Stewart, although it has not been verified if these scenes were filmed in England or in one of those other countries.\n\nContrary to what’s been reported, this video was not filmed at only one F1 race in Brazil, and also was not broadcast March 20, 1979, since the single wasn’t released until July, more car races were filmed in April and some scenes can be seen on the video. It’s not confirmed that George also attended the South African race, but at least there is much footage from that day included on the video.\n\nGeorge was in fact at the Long Beach race, since footage exists and he was also in Brazil from the last days of January and until February 9, visiting Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Very rare interview footage from an Argentinian reporter was filmed at the beach in Guarujá, Sao Paulo with George and F1 driver, Emerson Fittipaldi, footage is available. The interview was made in “cooperation” with Emerson who asked George first if he wanted to do a four question interview (which ended with more than 7). The interview is mislabeled in some sites or even the Argentina TV re-broadcast as from 1977 but in fact it’s from early February 1979 since George says there is a song on the new album about car racing and (the new album) “will be available at the end of February” (footage exists also from another interview he did for the TV show “Fantastico” plus another interview for a musical magazine and tons of pictures of George with fans at the hotel, airport and the Grand Prix).\n\n1981\n\nAll Those Years Ago\n\nCompiled by Ron Furmanek using Beatle archival footage and pictures. The video is available clean (without any credits over it) and very good quality among collectors\n\nThis is the original version, beware of fake videos created by fans saying “official video”, which can also be found on YouTube.\n\n1985\n\nSave The World (Greenpeace version)\n\nDirected by Ian Weiner and does not feature any George footage but Greenpeace people “at work”. This is the re-worked version that George did for the Greenpeace benefit album.\n\n1986\n\nShanghai Surprise #1 Long Version\n\nShanghai Surprise #2 Short Version\n\nProduced by Handmade Films, Filmed at Friar Park, Hanley-On-Thames where George and Vicki Brown recorded their vocals and is mixed with scenes from the film.\n\nLong Version has the full (5:20) recording, and the short (4:40) version (included on the ‘Dark Horse Years’ box set) cuts out 40 seconds of music and more scenes from the film but gladly there are no more scenes with George on the missing seconds. Short version is available in amazing quality and long version in only medium to good.\n\n1987\n\nHere Comes The Sun (Prince’s Trust)\n\nA performance from the Second Annual Prince’s Trust Concert TV special (the show was filmed June 6, 1987 at Wembley Arena, UK), this clip was broadcast many times on music TV Channels as a separate music video.\n\nGot My Mind Set On You ARCADE VERSION:\n\n#1 (Copyright over the video)\n\n#2 (Without copyright over the video)\n\nFilmed in London, Directed by Willy Smax. Two variants are available, #1 has the copyright credits over the video near the end while version #2 has the copyright credits after the video is finished. This second version (without slates and copyright credits) was also included in top quality on the “Dark Horse Years” boxed set.\n\n#3 (Raw Edit A)\n\n#4 (Raw Edit B)\n\nAlso available among bootleg and video collectors are two raw edits of the same video: Raw Edit A is SIMILAR but not the same as the released version, it has many different angles and scenes that were removed from the final version, specially a different dance sequence from the ballet ballerina.\n\nRaw Edit B shows only the “band performance” without any of the arcade video, plus there is no ballerina. A few scenes from this version were included as well on the final cut, but same as Raw Edit A, there are many differences with the released version. The finale on both Raw Edit A and B is completely different as well to the released version, showing George and the band singing in front of the camera.\n\nHere is Raw Version Edit B:\n\nGot My Mind Set On You HAUNTED HOUSE/CHAIR VERSION:\n\n#1 (Edit A- “Dancer tired”- Copyright over the video)\n\n#2 (Edit A- “Dancer tired”- Without copyright over the video)\n\n#3 (Edit B)\n\nA second version filmed in Los Angeles, Directed by Gary Weis. Two different versions plus one variation are available. #1 has the copyright credits over the video near the end while #2 has the copyright credits after the video is finished. This is the less known version where George’s double, the dancer has a longer sequence after his routine, he jumps into the chair and act tired for a few seconds and later the video returns with the real Harrison. Edit B or #3 doesn’t have this scene, after the dancer jumps into the chair, we immediately cut to George playing his guitar. This is not the only difference between Edit A and B, there are more scenes of the “haunted house” and the animals singing on Edit B while on Edit A we see more Harrison footage of him, playing his guitar.\n\nEdit B was also included in top quality on the “Dark Horse Years” boxed set and standalone DVD.\n\nHere is EDIT B:\n\n1988\n\nWhen We Was Fab\n\n-When We Was Fab #1 (Edit A- Copyright over the video)\n\n-When We Was Fab #2 (Edit A- Without copyright over the video)\n\n-When We Was Fab #3 (Edit B)\n\nFilmed at Greenford Studios, London, mainly on 18 Dec 1987 but some cameos were filmed on different days that December, plus some in January 1988. Directed by Kevin Godley and Lol Creme.\n\nCameos from many musicians that also participate on the Cloud Nine album on this innovative video for that time include: Ringo Starr (who appears through all the videos); Jeff Lynne and Ray Copper playing the violin; Elton John putting a coin in a cup while he is being “robbed” by one of George’s hands. During the near final sequence of this video, while George multiples himself and many characters are passing through (12 to be exact), we can identify more stars that played on the LP: Bobby Kok (cello), Gary Wright (piano) who also looks like Jim Horn (sax) (same look and hair of both of them that December), Vicki Brown (backing vocals), Jeff Lynne (again) and behind him, Jim Keltner, although another bearded musician known as “slowhand” is also a candidate and participated as well on the recordings for this LP, but the final scene is really hard to watch and the other characters are also hard to identify, but there are four women and eight men.\n\nPaul Simon (who didn’t play on the record) also appears pushing a fruit cart during the middle of the video.\n\nA man who looks like (the sideburns don’t match with his looks from that year, or before or after, but let’s say it’s him) Neil Aspinall (The Beatles friend/Road manager and Apple manager for many years) also appears in the key point of the video (definitely NOT Julian Lennon or Phil Collins as reported): holding John Lennon’s Imagine LP while George is playing in the back with Ringo on drums and a mysterious Walrus playing the bass, recreating those Fab days “together” again John, Paul, George and Ringo… or something like that!\n\nThe story of “The Walrus Was Paul” is very well known, so we don’t need to get deeper on that. Also, well known is that Paul is NOT playing the bass wearing a walrus suit on this video. George once told as a joke that Paul was indeed in the video under the walrus suit, and years later Paul answer the same question from many interviews (one, his own Club Sandwich magazine) saying that he wasn’t available on that date (he did some studio recordings) and he’s NOT the man under the walrus suit… but the direct question was: “is that you under the Walrus suit on the “FAB” video?”, when in fact it should have been: “Did you participate in the “FAB” video?”. And the answer would have been: YESSSS! (If Paul’s mood was in a “myth-breaking” mood)\n\nThis is another of those “Beatle-Jokes” that we will never get a YES or NO as a direct answer from them, same as the “Paul is Dead” rumor, among others.\n\nPaul was not available during December 1987 because he was busy in the studio and also making some TV promotion in France and Germany for the “All The Best!” collection, but Director Kevin Godley (a friend of both George and Paul who has directed many of his videos over the years, as well as Beatle projects) managed to film him on a different day and year (plus many more cameos and characters were filmed separately as well) and include THAT over the FAB video. To date, no book or web page has published this info but Paul IS in the FAB video! He appears during the “reunion” sequence looking towards “the band”, so we can’t see his full face. This scene is so obvious: Paul appears only during the “Walrus” joke and by the time he passes in front of the Walrus, he turns his face against the man in the costume, like watching the Walrus play. Oh, one other thing, his appearance was distorted to complicate things even more, so recognizing him will be harder!. But any fan that knows every “look” (hair, face, way of walk, etc, etc) of the Fab’s over the years or any girl with a crush on him, will find this task not hard at all. (Another incorrect theory floating around: Paul is NOT the hippie-dressed guy who’s head is out of the frame and with a large beard around 2:40)\n\nPaul’s cameo was filmed the second week of January 1988 (two weeks before the post production of the video was finished on February 3, 1988), while he was doing some sessions for the Flower in the Dirt LP. This fact can be verified comparing Paul’s length of his hair. It wasn’t that long during the December 1987 promotion but is THIS long (as he appears on the “FAB” video) during the January footage and pictures that exists plus some TV promotion during February. Check the pictures to compare, just to validate the info that, until today, nobody has published.\n\nThis was another “Beatle-Joke”, a different clue that was planted on purpose and when the fans were looking directly at the man in the walrus suit playing the bass, the REAL McCartney would appear in front of all of us and nobody would notice him!!\n\nUndocumented but Two different Edits plus one variant are available.\n\n#1 (Edit A) has the copyright credits over the video near the end while #2 (Edit A) has the copyright credits after the video is finished. This is the version that is also available on the official “Dark Horse Years” boxed set and standalone DVD (without slates or copyright credits), sadly they didn’t take care about the original audio, with effects like the sound of the van when Ringo arrives, the coin falling, the apple being bitten, the drunk guys, etc, and were replaced with the remastered audio track. Bootleg compilations also use THIS version (because of his high quality), so if we want the original version, sadly it’s not on the official box or the recent bootleg compilations.\n\nAnd #3 (Edit B), being the rarest version barely circulated and features two different sequences against Edit A:\n\nEDIT A: From 2:45 to 2:47 a woman appears from left to right partially covering George. While on EDIT B there is a different scene.\n\nEDIT B: From 2:45 to 2:46 no woman appears and we keep seeing George and from 2:46 to 2:49, a couple of dunk guys appears from left to right partially covering George. Also blocking two seconds where Ringo appears from right to left carrying a piano.\n\nAnd the second difference between the two edits:\n\nEDIT A: From 2:56 to 2:59 the same scene of the two drunk guys (see Edit B 2:46 to 2:49) appears but reversed, from right to left, while on EDIT B we have another notable difference.\n\nEDIT B: From 2:57 to 2:59 from right to left , the same drunk guys appears but using a completely different scene.\n\nThis is Love\n\n-This is Love #1 (Copyright over the video)\n\n-This is Love #2 (Without copyright over the video)\n\nDirected by Morton Jankel. Filmed while on vacation at his Maui, Hawaii home. Olivia Harrison make a cameo along with his family. Variant #1 has the copyright credits over the video near the end while #2 is clean and is the same version available on the official “Dark Horse Years” boxed set and standalone DVD.\n\nTRAVELING WILBURYS:\n\nHandle With Care\n\n-Handle with Care #1 (1988 Copyright)\n\n-Handle with Care #2 (1989 Copyright)\n\n-Handle with Care #3 (Australian)\n\n-Handle with Care #4 (Cropped)\n\nFilmed in Los Angeles, CA. Variant #1 has the 1988 copyright credits over the video near the end while #2 is clean but when the video ends there is a 1989 copyright, so, the first version was distributed late 88 and second in early 89, still, both are the same in visual content.\n\n#3 was broadcast in Australia on the RAGE TV show and everything is the same except for the final seconds, from 3:06 to 3:14, where the white truck with the Wilburys logo appears, the speed for this final sequence runs SLOWER, while on the normal version (#1 or #2) the truck moves from right to left faster, on the Australian edit it goes slower and ends before the woman on the bike appears, but the audio track has no differences at all, the same speed, no alterations.\n\n#4 was released on the official Traveling Wilburys Box set, simulating a widescreen version but cropping picture from top and bottom.\n\nBootleg compilations also use THIS version (because of his high quality), so if we want the original version, sadly it’s not on the official boxed set or the recent bootleg compilations.\n\n1989\n\nEnd of The Line\n\nEnd of The Line #1 (Edit A -Copyright over the video)\n\nEnd of The Line #2 (Edit A- Without copyright over the video)\n\nEnd of The Line #3 (Edit B)\n\nFilmed in Los Angeles, CA shortly after Roy Orbison’s death. Directed by Willy Smax. Again, two different edits and one variation available.\n\nEdit A Variant #1 has the copyright credits over the video near the end while Edit A Variant #2 is clean. Edit B is available on the official Traveling Wilburys boxed set.\n\nAnd the main difference between Edit A and Edit B is the intro and finale where the train was removed from Edit B, showing footage of the Wilburys instead, plus, Edit B is in widescreen showing even more picture on the sides that is not present on the first edit but again, is also cropped on top and bottom. Still, this was NOT a 4:3 to 16:9 transfer (like “Handle With Care”), since the master video tapes were used and we get different scenes (intro and finale) and full picture on the sides. Bootleg compilations also use THIS version (because of his high quality), so if we want the original version, sadly it’s not on the official box or the recent bootleg compilations.\n\n1990\n\nNobody’s Child\n\nDirected by Derek Hayes for the benefit album “Nobody’s Child: Romanian Angel Appeal “. It does not features the actual Wilburys, but animated cartoons along with footage from orphanages in Romania. This is the only Wilbury video omitted from the official deluxe box from 2007 and 2016, but it’s in circulation complete with slates and in very good quality. The YouTube clip doesn’t reflects any of that! But due to copyright issues, almost all Wilburys videos were removed and only the official channels are active.\n\nShe’s My Baby\n\n-She’s My Baby Version #1\n\n-She’s My Baby Version #2\n\nDirected by David Leland. Two different versions available. The second was released in 2007 on the official Traveling Wilburys boxed set and is 80% distinct from the original version from 1990. It features not only different angles but also scenes from another take(s). This second version is little bit shorter and cuts the final scene of the man “chasing” the Wilburys aboard a car.\n\nBootleg compilations also use THIS version (because of his high quality), so if we want the original version, sadly it’s not on the official box or the recent bootleg compilations.\n\nVERSION 1:\n\nVERSION 2:\n\nInside Out\n\n-Inside Out Version #1\n\n-Inside Out Version #2\n\nOnce again, two different versions available. The second was released in 2007 on the official Traveling Wilburys boxed set and is 80% distinct from the original version from 1990. It features not only different angles but also scenes from another take or takes. This second version is 23 seconds shorter and the audio mix uses the remastered track, while the original audio version from 1990 has an instrumental/orchestral warm-up intro behind a red curtain and the sound of claps at the end (removed from Version #2).\n\nBootleg compilations also use THIS second version (because of his high quality), so if we want the original, sadly it’s not in the official boxed set or the recent bootleg compilations.\n\nAlso in circulation is some rehearsal footage (mislabeled on ALL the bootleg releases as being “outtakes” or “alternate version” for the “She’s My Baby” video, which is incorrect) and also behind the scenes and raw footage from the actual shooting.\n\n1991\n\nWilbury Twist\n\n-Wilbury Twist Version #1\n\n-Wilbury Twist Version #2\n\n-Wilbury Twist Version #3\n\nFilmed in Los Angeles, CA. Three different versions available. Version #1 and #2 (the rarest of the two) have a similar format but alternates distinct footage and cameos from special guests:\n\nJohn Candy, Eric Idle, Cheech Marin (Cheech and Chong), Whoopi Goldberg, Woody Harrelson , Milli Vanilli, Fred Savage (The Wonder Years), among others. Both versions are available in very good quality and clean of logos and credits among collectors. Version 2 is only available on bootleg compilations taken from a music TV channel with logo and credits over the picture.\n\nVersion 3 only features John Candy and Eric Idle over the intro using the same footage from Version #1, the other cameos were eliminated, but the rest is a completely new edit using different angles and takes and was released in 2007 on the official Traveling Wilburys box set.\n\nOuttake footage from an unreleased alternate edit (fourth version) that only shows the Wilburys playing also exist.\n\nVERSION 1:\n\nVERSION 3:\n\n2003\n\nAny Road\n\nDirected by Simon Hilton and Pamela Esterson using archival footage from the Harrison State, include some very rare and never before seen clips.\n\n2004\n\nTaxman (The Dark Horse Years)\n\nIf you search under the official George Harrison YouTube channel, many of the “Live in Japan” clips extracted from the ‘Dark Horse Years’ box set are labeled as “official video”, but only one of the songs from the 1991 Japanese tour was actually released as a “promo clip” for TV airing and it was “Taxman”. This clip was sent to promote the release of “The Dark Horse Years” boxed set.\n\n2006\n\n-Living in the Material World\n\n-Sue Me Sue You Blues (demo)\n\n-Miss O’Dell (alternate version)\n\nThree videos created for the “Living in the Material World” deluxe edition (CD/DVD) re-release in 2006.\n\n2014\n\n-What Is Life\n\nDirected by Brandon Moore, winner of the Genero.tv contest to create the official video for the song.\n\nGEORGE HARRISON RELATED VIDEOS:\n\n1985\n\nThe Singing Rebel’s Band: Freedom (Promo Version)\n\nDirected by Dick Clement for Handmade films, produced by Harrison for the film ‘Water’.\n\nBilly Connolly (vocals), Chris Tummings (vocals), The Singing Rebels Band: George Harrison (guitar, backing vocals), Ringo Starr (drums), Eric Clapton (guitar, backing vocals), Chris Stainton (bass), Ray Cooper (drums), Jon Lord (keyboards), Mike Moran (keyboards), Jenny Bogle and Anastasia Rodriguez (backing vocals).\n\nThe actual promo video for this song is available in regular quality and unbootlegged to date and consist of the same “performance” from the film and a mixture of many scenes from the movie, but the audio over the intro is clean and slightly different, when in the film we can see and hear an actor saying “My God it’s The Concert for Cascara!” (a parody of ‘The Concert For Bangladesh’). Also, actor Fred Gwynne (Herman from The Munsters) who also appears in the “Water” film, can be seen in this version saying “Gentlemen, we’re in the water business”.\n\n– Freedom (Film Version 1)\n\n– Freedom (Film Version 2)\n\nThe common version on bootleg compilations over the years is taken directly from the film Version #1. And when it was re-released on DVD in 2010, a new cut was made including some alternate scenes (an exclusive Harrison/Clapton scene for example), we will call that Film Version #2, cut in Widesceen from the original film tapes adding even more picture on the sides that is not available in the original print that let us see a few more Harrison (and many other members of the band, like Clapton) shots. These two versions are not promotional videos, but worth mentioning.\n\nFILM VERSION 1:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoVtEGvUV3g\n\n1989\n\nTom Petty: I Won’t Back Down\n\nDirected by David Leland. The backing band consisted of Jeff Lynne on bass, George Harrison on acoustic guitar, Mike Campbell on lead guitar, and Ringo Starr on drums.\n\nAlmost replicating the same personnel from the studio recording, except for Ringo who didn’t play, that was Phil Jones.\n\n1990\n\nJeff Lynne: Every Little Thing\n\nDirected by Meiert Avis. George plays on the studio recording and also sings three times on this song the line “All the secrets that you hide” at 1:33 and also at 2:42 and the shorter line “the secrets that you hide” at 3:24, but that’s not all. Harrison and Tom Petty make surprise cameos in this video, hanging from a rope from 2:36 to 2:58.\n\nAlso versions with and without copyright over the picture at the end are available. The version on bootleg compilations is taken from a TV broadcast with credits over it, but a clean copy with slate circulates among collectors. The way this animated video was created at that time makes it a little harder to see some hidden details, luckily the Harrison cameo is clearer.\n\nJeff Lynne: Lift Me Up\n\nThe follow up to the “Every Little Thing” video, also directed by Meiert Avis using the same mix with 3D animation. George plays on the song and also makes a brief and almost unnoticeable cameo dressed as a devil at 2:59 and until 3:03. Sadly the version that appears over and over on FAB’s collections and other labels is taken from a VH1 broadcast with logos and the intro slightly cropped. The full video including the slate is available among collectors. The way this animated video was created at that time makes little harder to see some hidden details, including George’s cameo. Hopefully Jeff Lynne will release an official collection of his solo videos in the future to get a better version.\n\n1995\n\nGary Wright: Don’t Try to Own Me\n\nDirected by Michael Schultz, features Harrison doing some backing vocals that were recorded back in 1992. It circulates with slate and final credits among collectors. Outtake footage also exists from this vocal session and some of these scenes were included on the final video.\n\nOfficial videos from other artists. George plays on these tracks but does not make any video cameos.\n\n1973: Cheech And Chong – Basketball Jones\n\n1989: Belinda Carlisle: Leave a light on\n\n1992: Jimmy Nail: Real Love\n\n2001: Jim Capaldi: Anna Julia\n\nGeorge plays guitar on the record but does not appear on the official clip. A FAKE fan-created video using George footage from the “Real Love” video and the “All Things Must Pass 30th” EPK was inserted during his guitar solo and uploaded to YouTube years ago, and many fans thought that THAT was the real promo video, it’s also featured on bootleg compilations, but the actual clip does NOT feature any Harrison footage.\n\nAnother Jim Capaldi promo for the song “Oh Lord, Why Lord?” from 1990, which supposedly features a cameo from Harrison is not in circulation.\n\nBreaking Myths:\n\n1-“My Sweet Lord” from Top of The Pops 1971 (Pans People dancers) is NOT an official video.\n\n2-“My Sweet Lord (2000)” – an official video never existed.\n\n3- There is no official video for “Someplace Else”, also included on bootleg compilations. The clip we see on the “Dark Horse Years” boxed set comes from the TV special “Handmade in Hong Kong”, – a behind the scenes look at the film.\n\n4- George Harrison does not play on Roy Orbison’s “You Got It”, despite some bootleg labels have included the official video for this song on their Beatle/Harrison compilations.\n\nSongs from TV shows, like “The Pirate Song” from Rutland TV, or “This Song” from DISCO German TV, or “Between The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea” from Jools Holland’s TV special are not promotional videos, even though you can find them on every bootleg promo collection compilation, the same situation is the full Harrison Prince’s Trust performances and Dylan’s celebration concert, among others, that’s just a cheap way to fill a “promo compilation” because the makers don’t have enough stuff to compile the ULTIMATE video collection."
