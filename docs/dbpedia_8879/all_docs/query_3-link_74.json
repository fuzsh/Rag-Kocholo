        "text": "George Harrison Studio album by George Harrison Released 27 November 1970 Recorded EMI Studios, February-October 1970 Genre Rock, Folk rock Length 1:07:49 Label Apple Producer George Harrison – Phil Spector George Harrison chronology Electronic Sound\n\n(1969) George Harrison\n\n(1970) Not Guilty\n\n(1976) Singles 1. \"My Sweet Lord\"\n\nRelease: 23 November 1970 2. \"What Is Life\"\n\nRelease: 15 February 1971\n\nGeorge Harrison is the third studio album by English rock musician George Harrison. Released as a double album in November 1970. It includes the hit singles \"My Sweet Lord\" and \"What Is Life\" that had been overlooked for inclusion on releases by the Beatles. The album reflects the influence of Harrison's musical activities with artists such as Bob Dylan, the Band, Delaney & Bonnie and Friends and Billy Preston during 1968–70, and his growth as an artist beyond his supporting role to bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. His album was introduced Harrison's signature slide guitar sound and the spiritual themes present throughout his subsequent solo work. The original vinyl release consisted of first disc of songs and a second disc of informal jams titled Apple Jam.\n\nProduction began during the Everest sessions at London's EMI Studios in February 1970, with extensive overdubbing and mixing continuing through October. Among the large cast of backing musicians were Eric Clapton and members of Delaney & Bonnie's Friends band – three of whom formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton during the recording – as well as Ringo Starr, Gary Wright, Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, John Barham, Badfinger and Pete Drake. The sessions produced an album's worth of extra material, most of which remains unissued.\n\nThe self-titled solo album was critically and commercially successful on release, with long stays at number one on charts worldwide. Co-producer Phil Spector employed his Wall of Sound production technique to notable effect; Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described the sound as \"Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons\". Reflecting the widespread surprise at the assuredness of Harrison's solo debut, Melody Maker's Richard Williams likened the album to Greta Garbo's first role in a talking picture and declared: \"Garbo talks! – Harrison is free!\" According to Colin Larkin, writing in the 2011 edition of his Encyclopedia of Popular Music, his self-titled album is \"generally rated\" as the best of all the Beatles' solo albums.\n\nDuring the final years of his life, Harrison oversaw a successful reissue campaign to mark the 30th anniversary of the album's release. After this reissue, the Recording Industry Association of America certified the album six-times platinum. It has since been certified seven-times platinum, with at least 7 million albums sold. Among its appearances on critics' best-album lists, his self-titled album was ranked 79th on The Times' \"The 100 Best Albums of All Time\" in 1993, while Rolling Stone placed it 368th on the magazine's 2023 update of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2014, his self-titled album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nTrack listing[]\n\nAll songs written by George Harrison, except where noted.\n\nSide one[]\n\nNo. Title Length 1. \"I'd Have You Anytime\" (Harrison, Bob Dylan) 2:56 2. \"My Sweet Lord\" 4:38 3. \"What Is Life\" 4:22 4. \"Isn't It a Pity\" 7:10 Total Length: 19:06\n\nSide two[]\n\nNo. Title Length 1. \"If Not for You\" (Dylan) 3:29 2. \"Apple Scruffs\" 3:04 3. \"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)\" 3:48 4. \"Art of Dying\" 3:37 5. \"Hear Me Lord\" 5:46 Total Length: 19:44\n\nSide three (Apple Jam)[]\n\nNo. Title Length 1. \"Out of the Blue\" 11:14 2. \"It's Johnny's Birthday\" (Bill Martin, Phil Coulter, Harrison) 0:49 3. \"Plug Me In\" 3:18 Total Length: 15:21\n\nSide four (Apple Jam)[]\n\nNo. Title Length 1. \"I Remember Jeep\" 8:07 2. \"Thanks for the Pepperoni\" 5:31 Total Length: 13:38\n\nPersonnel[]\n\nThe following musicians are either credited on the George Harrison album or are acknowledged as having contributed after subsequent research:"
