In 1974, Michael Bennett invited Dante to participate in interview sessions with Broadway dancers who, almost anonymously, serve as a backdrop behind star performers. Those sessions provided ample material for a Broadway musical. Collaborating with Bennett and James Kirkwood Jr., Dante created A Chorus Line, which earned him the 1976 Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for Best Book of a Musical and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The character of Paul, a gay Puerto Rican dancer whose early career consisted of working in a drag show, was based primarily on Dante.
