        "text": "The Beatles song “Eleanor Rigby” famously imagines its\n\neponymous heroine as a solitary spinster who attends a wedding wearing “a face\n\nthat she keeps in a jar by the door,” then dies and is given a funeral to which\n\n“nobody came.” “All the lonely people, where do they all come from?” the chorus\n\nmournfully wonders.” “All the lonely people, where do they all belong?”\n\nThe British drama “Still Life” by writer-director Uberto\n\nPasolini is pretty much an exact cinematic equivalent of Paul McCartney’s\n\ndowncast lament. It begins with three funerals, of different faiths, at which\n\nthere is only one mourner, the same in each case. He is John May (Eddie Marsan), a\n\nshort, square-ish fortysomething who not only attends such funerals but also\n\narranges them and even writes their eulogies.\n\nThis is his job, but it has also become something of a\n\nmission, even an obsession. May works for a council in south London where he’s\n\nassigned to arrange for the burials of people who die without any relatives or\n\nintimates to assist with their passage out of this life. Much like Eleanor\n\nRigby. There seems to be a steady stream of such folk, since May has been\n\nemployed for over two decades. And the government evidently has the largesse to\n\nallow him to pay for proper funerals, each with a clergyman, music, a good\n\ncasket and a decent burial.\n\nSince they have no one else, May regards the deceased as\n\n“his” people, and he goes to extra lengths to serve them well. Researching\n\ntheir lives as exhaustively as limited time and resources allow, he constructs\n\nthe most favorable life narrative for each that he can, and this becomes the\n\nperson’s eulogy. He also tracks down any lost relatives or friends and tries to\n\npersuade them to attend the last rites – usually without success.\n\nOtherwise, May’s life appears to be neat, clean and empty.\n\nHe’s like an amalgam of the protagonists of Henry James’ “The Altar of the\n\nDead” and T.S. Eliot’s “Prufrock” – devoted to his dear departed while living a\n\nlife measured out with “coffee spoons.”\n\nAfter establishing May’s routines and rituals, the story\n\ntake a turn when a young, officious new superior calls him in and tells his job\n\nis being consolidated out of existence. Apparently the bureaucracy would rather\n\npay for simple cremations rather than funerals, and has no need for his\n\npersonal attention to detail. Stunned that he’s only got a few days left being\n\npaid to pursue the quest that’s occupied his adult life, May finds a last case\n\nthat he gradually begins treating as a grand cause.\n\nAs it happens, the deceased lived across from him,\n\nsuggesting how modern city life divides communities into solitary cells. The\n\nman’s body had not been discovered for many days, but May enters his shabby,\n\nsmelly apartment and, with his usual meticulousness, begins picking through his\n\nbelongings (partly filled photo album, old LPs), looking for clues.\n\nThe portrait that emerges is one of a drunken, abusive,\n\nne’er-do-well, just the kind of guy who would die alone and unlamented. But\n\nthat doesn’t deter May, who puts his usual detective skills into high gear and\n\ntracks down a number of people who knew the man. They’re generally not happy to\n\nhear his name mentioned. A woman who runs a seaside fish and chips shop, who was\n\nhis girlfriend two decades before, recalls him as violent and impetuous. Two\n\nhomeless men, who served with him in the Falklands War, say much the same but\n\nallow that his roughness was useful in training for combat.\n\nMay also finds the man’s grown-up daughter (Joanna Froggat)\n\nworking in a rural center for rescued dogs – a job that signals something of\n\nher feelings of abandonment. The last time she saw her dad, she says, he was in\n\nprison and punched out a guard. She’s grateful to May that he’s let her know the\n\nsad news, but she doesn’t want any further involvement with her father…until\n\nshe changes her mind and calls the messenger back, sparking a connection\n\nbetween two lonely people that propels the tale’s third act toward an ending in\n\nwhich sudden surprise is followed by a bit of magical-realist uplift.\n\nThe film’s title says lots about its mood and style, which\n\nis heavy on becalmed views of rooms, objects like an apple peel and office\n\nutensils, and May’s glazed gazes at nothing in particular. Pasolini (formerly a\n\nproducer of films including “The Big Monty”) says this approach is indebted to\n\nlate Ozu, but it’s also one shared by many European art films of the\n\ndownbeat-humanist sort. In terms of atmosphere, it conveys a kind of drab\n\nordinariness that, for some reason, in English films, comes across as\n\nexceptionally dull, constricted and depressing."
