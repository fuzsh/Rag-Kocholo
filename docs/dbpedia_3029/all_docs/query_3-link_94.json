Through this collaboration, the chorus will maintain a regular presence on campus, rehearsing in the Esther B. Griswold Theatre for the Performing Arts every Thursday morning, and presenting on-campus performances. AIC students will also have the unique opportunity to engage with the chorus as interns.\n\nYoung@Heart has been artist-in residence at BOMBYX since 2022, and rehearses in their “Peacock Room” every Monday morning. We are honored to call BOMBYX a home, and performed in the venue’s iconic Sanctuary for the first time in early 2024. Learn more.\n\nAna, a beloved member of the Young@Heart, passed away on February 1, 2024. Ana joined the group in the middle of the pandemic in June 2021. She had an auspicious debut at her first rehearsal with the group where she sang the classic Puerto Rican song \"Lamento Borincano\" and blew everyone away – she then made her way to the stage with us in the spring of 2022.\n\nAna was the first person to ever join the group already in her 90’s. Everything about Ana was a treat. She had a fabulous voice, a great sense of humor and beautiful spirit. She was loved by all in the 2.5-year period she was a member of the group. One of our fondest memories of Ana was during a rehearsal where we asked everyone to basically sing us their life. The band played a traditional blues to Paul Butterfield’s “Born in Chicago” and the singers would sing us their life story. Most people gave a short 30-second rendition – Ana, on the other hand, had a lot to say. She gave us a pretty thorough run down of her 93 years while having both the band and chorus in stitches.\n\nTo learn more about Ana, please click here."
