        "text": "\"What makes me angry is that young people will hear this show broke every record on Broadway and the only point of reference they will have is the film. And they'll wonder why\" -Theoni Aldredge\n\nThere has been a lot of controversy over the movie version of A Chorus Line. Sadly, the general feeling that pervades amongst most fans of the musical is that it is too different from the original show, resulting in an overall effect that is slow-moving, dreary and lacks the sparkle, humour and impact of its original counterpart.\n\n'A Chorus Line' was Micheal Bennett's show and he beleived that he was the only person who could produce and direct the movie. A deal was made, and a press release issued that Michael himself would indeed be directing and producing 'A Chorus Line: The Movie'. But friction between himself & MCA (the studio) the patronising attitudes of many of the officials there, along with the clash between the studio and Michael's very different visions of what the movie should be, caused Bennett to walk out of the whole deal very suddenly. Bennett's point of view was that the film should be exactly what the show was - it worked, it was brilliant so why change it? The studio however, had different ideas.\n\nWhilst, for the most part the plot and character backgrounds remained unchanged, substansial changes were made during the show's transferral to the screen:\n\nThe song 'Sing!' (a duet between Kristine and Al) is omitted completely.\n\nThe song 'The Music and the Mirror' is replaced by 'Let Me Dance For You'\n\nMajor parts of the montage (Judy's solo and dialogue, Connie's 'Four Foot 10' solo and dialogue, Don's solo, Maggie's 'Mother' song, Richie's Gimme the Ball solo, Greg's solo and dialogue and Marks 'Gonoeraha' solo) are completely removed, most parts being converted into 30 second speeches inserted at different points throughout the movie.\n\nMark's 'Gonoreahha' song and Greg's story about discovering he was gay are merged into a very short version of 'Hello 12, Hello 13, Hello Love'\n\n'Suprise', a song written for the movie and not in the original show in any form, replaces the rest of the Montage. Sung primarily by Richie and backed up by the rest of the cast, it features strange lighting effects and themes of sexual desire and longing.\n\nBebe is chosen instead of Judy in the final elimination\n\nCassie arrives halfway through the audtition instead of being there from the start, and Zach is so against her audtioning that she doesn't even begin to dance or sing with the others until the first rehersal of 'One'. Instead there are a lot of new scenes added of her wandering around backstage in the dressing rooms with Larry, and a series of flashbacks to the time when she and Zach were still together.\n\nThe song 'What I did for Love' - originally Diana's love song to the act of dance and backed up by the entire cast - is sung as a complete solo by Cassie as a love song to Zach.\n\n'Alternatives' is condensed into a short spoken scene, featuring only Connie, Sheila, Mark and Bebe.\n\nZach does not dance at all, and for the most part stays in his directors booth in the centre of the auditorium.\n\nAs well as these changes, there are some goofs and odd moments to watch out for:\n\nOne tall, skinny dancer with short blond hair (wearing a white top with a blue leotard over it) gets cut at the beginning, the same time as Connie and Judy and get through to the next round. Later she reappears dressed differently (in a pink catsuit) as you can see when Zach tells Vicki not to dance during the ballet combination.\n\nThroughout the whole film we never see Val dance. She is always just off camera in dance scenes such as 'Suprise' and 'I hope I get it'. An actress who played Val on Broadway and audtioned for the film but didnt get it was asked to dub Audrey Landers (movie Val) in the dancing but refused.\n\nIn the dance section of 'Suprise' as Richie turns a triple pirouette towards the end, you can actually see the sweat flying off his face.\n\nIn the closing while the credits are running, watch the lower right hand corner of the screen. While doing high-kicks one dancer falls and then gets up again and continues dancing.\n\nCast\n\nMichael Douglas: Zach\n\nAlyson Reed: Cassie\n\nVicki Frederick: Sheila\n\nCameron English: Paul\n\nYamil Borges: Diana\n\nGregg Burge: Richie\n\nAudrey Landers: Val\n\nPam Klinger: Maggie\n\nBlane Savage: Don\n\nMichael Blevins: Mark\n\nJan Gan Boyd: Connie\n\nJanet Jones: Judy\n\nMichelle Johnston: Bebe\n\nTerrence Mann: Larry\n\nTony Fields: Al\n\nNicole Fosse: Kristine\n\nCharles McGowan: Mike\n\nJustin Ross: Greg\n\nMatt West: Bobby\n\nSharon Brown: Kim\n\nRelated Links\n\nIMDB: A Chorus Line\n\nBuy the movie on video at Amazon.com\n\nBuy the movie on DVD at Amazon.co.uk\n\nA Chorus Line: From Stage to Screen"
