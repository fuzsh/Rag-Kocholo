        "text": "Cheryl Clark\n\n\"I did over 3,000 performances of the role of 'Cassie'. Two situations come to mind as very memorable. The first incident, humorous- the second, poignant. Because I was quite young when Michael Bennett cast me as 'Cassie', taking me from the Original production of 'Chicago', he asked that I would open his first international production being the Australian Company so I could be groomed. He personally came down to Sydney for weeks and workshopped us (my Zach, Scott Pearson, also an American), had hours of incredible rehearsal with Michael- our scenes together in particular. Many months later, Scott and I during a performance one evening, began the intense second scene when Zach is raising his voice and commanding Cassie to 'bring your leg down, stop popping your head', etc. The tension in the scene escalates with Cassie doing her best to blend in with the other dancers. All of a sudden, an Aussie man in the audience, stood up and shouted, 'Who the bloody _____ bleep does Zach think he is, talking to Cassie that way!', and he stormed up the aisle. We learned later that he headed straight for the bar of our Her Majesty's Theatre ! Never a dull moment down in the bush, and I did the show there 10 months! Now, upon returning to America, I became a Broadway Cassie. Having been like a daughter to both Fosse and Bennett, both geniuses, my years of training in voice, acting and dance, became even more polished with both of those great men as mentors. Michael would always say, to combat the company's stage fright, or any apprehension- 'Play the play'. Bob Fosse was so great at 'truth', saying, \"less is more\" and 'never play for the jokes'. And always assume the audience is seeing this body of work for the first time. It is no joke in a technical sense, that dancers performing 8 shows a week, sometime feel like their feet are going to fall off come that final performance on a matinee 2 show day! Cassie is one of the most difficult sequence roles in Broadway history for a female (very physically demanding). Also acting wise, and vocally. I had hemorrhaged a vocal chord first doing the role in Australia, so I studied hard and really broke down the Cassie sequence. First, you sing the song supporting like a singer, then that fabulous first breakaway dance section happens, and you let it rip, supporting like a dancer. You face the audience again, very thrilling, singing and holding that \"chance to dance\" note forever until it goes into the orchestral and the major dance section happen. Applause, applause, applause, afterwards to give the Cassie only seconds to find the breath to support the rest of a very intense scene with Zach. Having trained with one of the greatest singers with the Met, Felix Knight, he instilled such great technique for my Cassie, and would always stress to his students regarding performing, 'when the bell rings, you don't get into the ring and start doing pushups.' All of us Cassies' trained since we were little girls, so when your feet feel like they can't hold you up, you draw from your technique (I compare it to golf, because you can't observe yourself in the swing), you must abandon yourself in the technique, same with voice. Cassie is so difficult because of all 3 elements. One Saturday night, the eighth show of the week, I felt concern that not even my technique would carry me through the Cassie section. It boiled down to a very spiritual solution. I thought, Dear God, please help me get through this and do a good job. I reflected on my in-laws at the time. Both, at age 16, had been taken from Poland and the Ukraine and forced into Nazi work farms, remaining there for 2 years. They did not have the opportunity to train and love dance, music, etc. like myself at that formative age. I dedicated my performance that evening at the Shubert to the visualization that their physical stuggle was far greater than what I was facing before 1,750 audience members, and I let God carry me through that sequence with utter spiritual abandon. Not only did I get a standing ovation that evening, but Sir Richard Attenborough was out in the audience (none of us knew), and afterwards, the stage door man announced that I had visitors coming back to my dressing room. I opened the door, and there was Sir Richard! I exclaimed my surprise, and with his beautiful, open face, he kissed my face European style, on both cheeks and said, 'you're brilliant, and we will be seeing you soon'. You see, he was casting the film at that time. With Sir Richard, I had respected his work so much because he was so genuine. Alyson got the role and I did about 5 weeks of work on the picture. We couldn't related to the script because the Cassie in the film is not related to the Donna/Michael Bennett Cassie. It wasn't the Cassie that we all know love. When I give clinics and see young people coming up in the business, we work on the fundamentals as a triple threat; dance, voice and acting. But like that Saturday night, there is a beautiful spiritual aspect of performing when God does carry you, and the ultimate beauty for me, on top of dedicating my performance to those with great challenges, was dancing to the fantastic orchestra down in the pit, carrying me as well with their excellence in playing 'The Music and the Mirror'.\"\n\nWanda Richert\n\n\"The most special memory that I have of playing Cassie is one I hold very near and dear to my heart. It didn't happen during a performance. It is the memory of a special exchange I had with Michael Bennett at a note session with him after the show in San Francisco. It was 1979, long before my Broadway run as Cassie. I was one of the cast of the 1st National Touring Company. I had just turned twenty-one years old. I had joined the show in Los Angeles as a Sheila / Maggie cover when I was nineteen, and was immediately asked, by Baayork Lee, to learn the 'Cassie Dance' for Mr. Bennett. I was absolutely thrilled! I had set my sights on that role from the first time I saw the show at the Shubert Theater, with my mom, when I was sixteen. From the top of the show, we both said, 'The girl in the red dress...that's the part for you!' I held that dream in my vision. Michael came out to LA about three weeks after I joined the company. He proceeded to fire four of the seven actors who were hired at the same time that I was. WOW! The rumors were true. He was someone to fear. It was time for me to dance for him and it was definitely the most nervous I had been in my life! God sang and danced for me that afternoon. Half way through the number, Michael stopped me and said, 'Thank you darling, that's all I need to see.' He then asked me to read for Val, Judy and Christine. He left, we had our day off,and I returned to the theater the next day to be told that Michael wanted me on the line as soon as there was an opening. I was made the first cover to Cassie, Sheila, Val, Judy and Christine, which ultimately, led to me permanently replacing Cheryl Clark as Cassie when she left the show in Chicago, my home town. A year into my run, Michael came up to Boston to check on the cast and hold a brush-up rehearsal. I had never been to an acting class, nor had I studied vocally. Michael became my acting teacher and my vocal coach. He honored my talent in such a special way. I learned so very much, as an actress, from him. Rehearsals with him were exciting and priceless. From that point in time on, I found a new exhilaration in the role that I never tired of.\n\nThe night I'm recalling was one of those rare times when you rewind those two hours gone by and say, 'That was the best performance I've ever given.' Michael was in the house with Bob Avian. We were re-opening the Golden Gate Theater. After the performance, the cast was called to the stage for notes. Michael saved me for last, and this is what he said. 'I have been watching Wanda since she was just nineteen. Darling, you are an actress. You can act your ass off! I applaud you. I would like the entire company to applaud Wanda.' I was speechless. What an honor. That was my Tony! I will be be forever grateful to the late, great Mr. Bennett. He was my mentor and I will miss working with and for him. There will never be another Michael. There will never be another female role in the Musical Theater that compares to Cassie. There was just no better high than dancing on the Shubert stage, in that red dress, seeing and feeling those mirrors flying in around me. My true 'Inner Cassie' was in the sensuality of dancing to the saxophone playing during the slow section. She is my forever favorite role. Even though Peggy Sawyer was Wanda Richert...Wanda Richert, in her heart, will always be Cassie.\""
