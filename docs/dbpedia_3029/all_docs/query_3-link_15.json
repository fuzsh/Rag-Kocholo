        "text": "Top ten box-office films of 1985:\n\n1. Back to the Future\n\n2. Rambo: First Blood Part II\n\n3. Rocky IV\n\n4. The Color Purple\n\n5. Out of Africa\n\n6. Cocoon\n\n7. The Jewel of the Nile\n\n8. Witness\n\n9. The Goonies\n\n10. Spies Like Us\n\nWhat are your top three films for 1985? We will keep a running tally and eventually have some sort of bracket. For me it would be:\n\n1. Shoah\n\n2. Come and See\n\n3. Ran\n\nWhat are some of the forgotten gems from the year? What is overrated? What did you discover at a young age and what did you discover later?\n\nYEARS IN FILM • forum.chorus.fm\n\n1. Taipei Story\n\n2. The Breakfast Club\n\n3. Ran\n\nBreakfast Club is a nostalgic favorite. A lot of it is good and some of it isn’t but overall I like thinking about it and how much I loved it as a preteen. I’m not sure the last time I saw it.\n\nRan isn’t my favorite Kurosawa but it’s very good, and Taipei Story isn’t my favorite Yang but I like it more the more I reflect on it. I haven’t seen Come and See, it’s one that’s been in my queue for ages and I haven’t yet pulled the trigger. Back to the Future is really fun but I’ve never loved it as much as a lot of others do.\n\nIt’s been on cable for me a few times in the last year, but I first saw it in middle school, I think it still holds up. Young Andrew McCarthy, Kevin Dillon, Patrick Dempsey, Mary Stuart Masterson... plus Donald Sutherland and John Heard!\n\nAn even better year than the one before with at least ten films I could pick from with horror films being particularly strong but these are my choices -\n\n1. Day of the Dead\n\n2. To Live and Die in L.A.\n\n3. Lifeforce\n\nCould have easily picked any combination of the following though especially the first seven; Back to the Future, Fright Night, The Return of the Living Dead, Phenomena, Witness, Pale Rider, Runaway Train, Ran, Re-Animator, Commando, Demons, The Stuff, Cat’s Eye, The New Kids, and Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins.\n\n1. Police Story\n\n2. Tampopo\n\n3. Vagabond\n\nPolice Story was the big breakout Jackie Chan film that moved him fully away from period piece martial arts and into big budget modern action blockbusters. Full of ludicrous stunt work that'd be a massive influence on Hollywood cinema, it's a completely committed and over the top film with more broken glass than anything else I can think of.\n\nTampopo is a very funny Japanese film about a ramen shop, full of Monty Python esque diversions and non-sequitur cutaway scenes. Consistently funny, and there's also a scene where two lovers kiss and \"erotically\" repeatedly pass an egg yolk back and forth to each other that's one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen on film... Link for the curious.\n\nConsidered Ran and Taipei Story for the third place, but went for Varda's Vagabond about the death of a young drifter. A tragic film about the desire for autonomy and independence in a callous capitalist world.\n\nHonourable mentions include the surreal and bureaucratic dystopia of Brazil. Re-Animator a fantastic horror comedy splatter film that remembers to both be horrifying and comic. Yes, Madam a great action film with a star turn from Michelle Yeoh. Mr. Vampire, the first of many of these films, with our hopping Jiangshi, and Lam Ching-Ying playing the same character he'd play for the rest of his career, a Taoist priest, with ridiculous eyebrows.\n\nI do need to see Come and See, I'm sure it's as excellent as everyone says, but I do find it hard to motivate myself to watch films that I know will make me feel miserable afterwards. If I stumble across them without looking it up it's a different matter, but would need to be in the right mood to watch this.\n\n1. Hail Mary\n\n2. Taipei Story\n\n3. Vagabond\n\nHM: Tampopo, She Spent So Many Hours Under the Sun Lamps, After Hours, Four Sisters, Typhoon Club, The Time to Live and the Time to Die\n\nRan and Come and See are two of my biggest blindspots. I should have watched Ran months ago - I was on a run through Kurosawa's filmography but I got stopped at Kagemusha and its 3 hour runtime when I was moving apartments and just haven't gotten back to them. Come and See is on my Criterion Challenge list for this year, but I just haven't felt the mood for 2.5 hours of that so far this year. Mishima is another one from this year that I have been meaning to get around to for many years."
