A stunning concept musical originally conceived, directed and choreographed by Michael Bennett capturing the spirit and tension of a Broadway chorus audition, A Chorus Line explores the inner lives and bittersweet ambitions of professional Broadway performers, and features one powerhouse number after another. Memorable musical numbers include \"What I Did for Love, \"One,\" \"I Can Do That,\" \"At the Ballet,\" \"The Music and the Mirror\" and \"I Hope I Get It.\" A brilliantly complex fusion of song, dance, and compellingly authentic drama, A Chorus Line was instantly recognized as a classic.\n\nOpening Off-Broadway at the Public Theater on April 15, 1975, A Chorus Line, originally starring Donna McKechnie, Sammy Williams, Robert LuPone and Kelly Bishop, transferred to the Shubert Theatre on Broadway on July 25, 1975 and ran for 6,137 performances before closing on April 28, 1990. On September 29, 1983, A Chorus Line became the longest-running show in Broadway history. In London, it played 903 performances at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. It was revived at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre on Broadway in 2006 and played for 759 performances.\n\nAntonio Banderas (producer, co-director, star)\n\nSince his introduction to American cinema, Banderas has been one of the most outstanding international actors of his generation. He has received critical acclaim for his roles in film, television and theatre, as well as for his work behind the camera as a director.\n\nHe has worked with some of the best directors and actors in Hollywood: Robert Rodriguez's Desperado opposite Salma Hayek and the sequel Once Upon a Time in Mexico, opposite Johnny Depp; Original Sin with Angelina Jolie; Alan Parker's Evita opposite Madonna (for which he received his first Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor); The Mask of Zorro, by Martin Campbell, opposite Catherine Zeta-Jones (second Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor), and the sequel The Legend of Zorro; Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt; Jonathan Demme's Philadelphia alongside Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington; Bille August's House of the Spirits with Meryl Streep and Glenn Close; and Femme Fatale by Brian de Palma. He was nominated for his third Golden Globe Award for Best Actor for his performance as the infamous Pancho Villa on HBO's “And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself” in 2003. In 2005 he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nIn 2003, he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for Nine, his Broadway debut, a Roundabout Theatre Company production inspired by Fellini's 8 1/2, and which garnered him a Drama Desk Award for Best Actor, as well as Outer Critics Circle, Drama League and Theater World Awards.\n\nHe has also starred in “Genius: Picasso” (2018), the National Geographic limited series for which he received Primetime Emmy, Golden Globe, Critic's Choice and SAG Award nominations for Best Actor in a Limited Series. He recently won the Best Actor Award at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival for his compelling performance as Salvador Mallo in Pedro Almodóvar's autobiographical drama Pain and Glory, his eighth film with Almodóvar and one that earned him rave reviews.\n\nMarvin Hamlisch (music)\n\nFor Broadway, Hamlisch wrote the music for his groundbreaking show A Chorus Line, as well as They’re Playing Our Song, The Goodbye Girl and Sweet Smell of Success. Additional theatrical scores include Jean Seberg and The Nutty Professor. He was the composer of more than 40 motion picture scores, including his Oscar-winning score and song for The Way We Were and his adaptation of Scott Joplin’s music for The Sting, for which he received a third Oscar. His prolific output of scores for films includes original compositions and/or musical adaptations for Sophie’s Choice, Ordinary People, The Swimmer, Three Men and a Baby, Ice Castles, Take the Money and Run, Bananas, Save the Tiger and The Informant!\n\nHamlisch was musical director and arranger of Barbra Streisand’s 1994 concert tour of the U.S. and England as well as of the television special “Barbra Streisand: The Concert” (for which he received two of his Emmys). He held the position of principal\n\npops conductor for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, Dallas Symphony Orchestra, Pasadena Symphony and Pops, Seattle Symphony, San Diego Symphony, the Buffalo Philharmonic and the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C.\n\nEdward Kleban (lyrics)\n\nEdward was the lyricist of A Chorus Line, for which he won the 1975 Tony Award, the Pulitzer Prize, Drama Desk and Olivier Awards. His score for the musical A Class Act, produced posthumously, was nominated for the 2001 Tony and Drama Desk Awards and won an Obie Award. A Class Act is a musical biography of Kleban, with a score comprised of his own music and lyrics. A New York revival recently ended its run on Theatre Row.\n\nKleban was a graduate of the High School of Music and Art and of Columbia College, where he wrote the music for the Varsity Show of 1960 with a book by Terrance McNally. Upon graduation from Columbia, Kleban was hired as a record producer by Columbia Records. Throughout the sixties he produced original cast albums while developing his own musicals in Lehman Engel’s BMI Musical Theatre Workshop. Every song that he wrote for A Chorus Line was tested in the BMI Workshop. During the 1980s he carried on Engel’s tradition and taught songwriting in the workshop.\n\nKleban died in December 1987 at the age of 48, after a two-year bout with a cigarette-related cancer. In his will, he created and endowed the Kleban Prize, a unique grant that is bestowed not for a writer’s previous achievements, but for the promise of creativity to come, chosen by a panel of Broadway’s most respected artists. Recipients have gone on to garner four Tony Awards, 30 Tony nominations, 10 Drama Desk Awards and four Obies.\n\nConcord is the independent, worldwide leader in the development, management and acquisition of sound recordings, music publishing, theatrical performance rights and narrative content.
