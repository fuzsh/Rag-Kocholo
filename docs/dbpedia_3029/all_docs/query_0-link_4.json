        "text": "François Delisle's (The Meteor) tale of grieving, separated parents finally faced with the undeniable truth of their young son's murder packs an understated emotional wallop even with its share of missteps along the way.\n\nA decade after their son first went missing, former married couple Christophe (Sébastien Ricard) and Irene (Fanny Mallette) are reunited when a prisoner confesses to the murder and helps the authorities unearth the remains. With old feelings flaring up while each tries to cope with the new revelations, melancholy and joy intertwine in the most bittersweet of ways.\n\nOpening with a deeply uncomfortable monologue in which the perpetrator relays some of the details of his crime - and the disturbing remainder of this confession appears later in the film to harrowing effect - Chorus is the exact opposite of a meet-cute, a meet-ugly in which the only glimmer of hope is that these ex-lovers might rekindle what worked between them a decade prior, or at least find a way to simply live with themselves. After all, at present, Irene immerses herself in an interminable pit of guilt, while Christophe tries desperately to fuck his feelings away in Mexico.\n\nWithout the presence of a body, their son was never quite dead, but now, the pair can't avoid the emotional wringer as they bury their child. It's heart-wrenching stuff and Delisle didn't need to make much effort for the drama to stir the soul, so it's a shame that he decided to accompany the handsomely photographed black-and-white footage with faux-lyrical narrated dialogue which spoonfeeds all the subtext and internal characterisation to the viewer wholesale.\n\nThe unfussed pace despite the relatively brief 97-minute run-time might also prove a tad challenging to some viewers, though the likelihood is that if you're prepared to sit through a drama with subject matter this unpleasant, you're probably patient enough to stick through the slower moments. Ultimately, despite some needless indulgences, Chorus is a compelling examination of the pain that closure can bring, and smartly avoids the sentimental finale a lesser voice would have settled for."
