        "text": "When an artist charts a dizzyingly direct course to stardom, inevitably there is a group of spectators in the back, ready to pounce. Small digs at the star’s come-up (too fast) or connections (industry plant) can make any artist start to doubt their own authenticity, even when they know the rumors are false. Such matters haunt Tierra Whack, the motormouth Philadelphia rapper-singer who went from a viral street freestyler to a Grammy nominee and Beyoncé collaborator in less than a decade—only to wonder where her place in rap is now. Throughout the engrossing Cypher, a hybrid documentary-fiction film starring Whack that recently premiered at the Tribeca Festival, she considers how far she’s made it thus far with self-aware scrutiny. “I think that when someone like me moves up in the world, especially through art and music, it’s a blessing,” she admits to the camera. “But some people will ask the question, ‘Why? Why her?’ I’m still asking myself that question. Why me? Why was I chosen?”\n\nIn Cypher, that interrogation of destiny morphs into one of control over Whack’s career and public image. Directed by Chris Moukarbel, who previously helmed Lady Gaga’s Five Foot Two, the film conforms to the standard music doc format before dissolving into a paranoid remix of itself. Whack’s story, captured up-close for three years in her mid-20s, is the scaffolding that holds the heightened docudrama together. There is a genuine familial bond among the rapper and her entourage of managers, producers, and stylists—even as everyone’s tongue is clearly planted firmly in cheek. “I definitely think she could act, but I even feel like if she had a script, that character would develop into something else,” Camille Lawrence, Whack’s makeup artist, says to the camera early on. “Even if they had a mold of who she is, she would outgrow that and change the vibe of the whole film.” Meanwhile, Whack presses her face against a glass door, driving home her delightfully unserious approach to the material.\n\nCypher’s first half hour is a solid primer, showing Whack’s rise from North Philadelphia to one of hip-hop's most creative voices, the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it rapper you couldn’t miss. Her We Run the Streets cypher is just as electrifying as it was in 2011, a first glimpse at a generational talent that blossoms on 2018’s micro-masterpiece Whack World. Eventually we see her crowd-surfing across the globe and snatching up Apple and LEGO campaigns, pushing her name beyond music and further into the mainstream. Things go south a year after her debut, once Whack starts to prepare a much-hyped follow-up: A fan approaches her after a concert while she’s unwinding at a diner, insisting that Whack is at the center of an MKUltra-inspired conspiracy involving mind control. Then an anonymous Instagram account appears filled with creepy footage of Whack and the documentary crew, an invasion of privacy that feels scarily in line with fans’ increasingly parasocial relationships with celebrities (especially those, like Whack, who move without security guards). From there, the plot spins out into a horror-tinged thriller: ominous gifts are delivered to doorsteps, a secret society might truly be pulling the strings behind Whack’s new video, and the web of eerie incidents is far from coincidental.\n\nThe slippery narrative is captured through a blend of handycam footage, TikTok and Instagram clips, and the occasional swooping drone scene, a digital collage that typifies the dizzying collapse of context within modern celebrity footage. Whack may be skeptical of the 24/7 expectation of social media access, but when she is in the mood to open up, the film can be legitimately insightful into her somewhat mysterious process and day-to-day life. Some of Cypher’s best moments show Whack at work, whether improvising her way into the sticky chorus of 2020’s “Peppers and Onions” in the studio or delighting in a later set time at a festival, a more lowkey example of her rising profile."
