        "text": "While Hollywood has lost faith in audiences' excitement over movie musicals recently, musicals have been a Hollywood mainstay for almost as long as film has been an industry. The first feature film with synchronized sound was technically a musical. However, since 1927’s The Jazz Singer, the musical genre has come a long way. Many of the best films of Hollywood’s golden age are musicals. The best movie musicals deliver iconic songs and dance scenes that can transcend the medium of film itself. The best musicals of all time are much like the best musical theater actors: triple threats. These films have the dancing, singing and acting to make them true classics.\n\nTop Musical Movies\n\nWhile the top-grossing musical of all time, 2019’s The Lion King, doesn’t make this list, many of these films have been both commercially and critically successful. From the Technicolor spectacles of the 1940s to the cult hits of the 1980s to the animated musicals of the 1990s Disney renaissance, there are many musical eras. This list features films from 1933 to 2022.\n\nMusicals on this list come in numerous subgenres, including comedy, historical, romance, animation, Bollywood and biopic. Directors and actors featured on this list include Bob Fosse, Shah Rukh Khan, Fred Astaire, Lena Horne, Julie Andrews, Judy Garland and both Liza and Vincente Minnelli.\n\n35. Victor/Victoria (1982)\n\nA remake of the 1930s German film Victor and Victoria, Victor/Victoria is a musical comedy about a struggling woman who decides to pretend to be a man to pretend to be a female impersonator to rise to the top of Paris’s club scene.\n\nThe movie was nominated for seven Academy Awards. In 1995, it also was adapted into a Broadway musical. The film was written and directed by Blake Edwards and starred his wife, Julie Andrews, in one of her best comedic roles. The movie is available for rental on Google Play, YouTube, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.\n\n34. White Christmas (1954)\n\nThe song “White Christmas” had already been introduced in the 1942 film Holiday Inn, but eight years later, Bing Crosby returned to sing the Irving Berlin classic again. White Christmas and Holiday Inn have similar plots about performers putting on a show to save a struggling inn. However, White Christmas features performances by Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen.\n\nWhile White Christmas has become a holiday classic, it has drawn criticism for its number “I’d Rather See a Minstrel Show.” While the characters do not don blackface (unlike in a similar number in Holiday Inn), the number is still part of a larger history of racism and blackface in America. The movie is available for rental on Google Play, YouTube, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.\n\n33. The Golden Eighties (1986)\n\nSometimes also called Window Shopping, The Golden Eighties is a musical comedy from Belgian feminist auteur filmmaker Chantal Akerman. The film takes place in a shopping mall and is filled with references to the golden age of Technicolor movie musicals.\n\nThe film was a departure for Akerman, who had become known for her darker films, such as Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce and 1080 Bruxelles. She had difficulties securing funding for the film and made a documentary on the making of the movie to stir excitement in the project. While she did secure funding, she had to make the film on a smaller budget. However, The Golden Eighties still walks the line between charming and unpretentious and art film. It is available for streaming through the Criterion Channel.\n\n32. Dreamgirls (2006)\n\nThis film à clef takes inspiration from the story of the Supremes and is based on the 1981 Broadway musical of the same name. Dreamgirls features performances from Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé Knowles, Eddie Murphy, Jennifer Hudson, Danny Glover, Anika Noni Rose and Keith Robinson.\n\nThe film received eight Oscar nominations and won two. It received generally positive reviews and holds a 79% on Rotten Tomatoes. Hudson especially garnered praise for her acting debut as Effie White. Notably, the movie contains four original songs not from the 1980s Broadway show. The movie is currently available for streaming on Paramount+ and Showtime.\n\n31. Hairspray (2007)\n\nHairspray is Adam Shankman’s cinematic take on the Broadway Musical of the same name. The film has become a cult classic, much like the 1980s John Waters film on which the musical was based. Set in 1960s Baltimore, Hairspray follows a hopeful plus-sized dancer, Tracy Turnblad, as she tries out for a local televised dance program and goes up against racial segregation.\n\nThe film features performances by Nikki Blonsky, John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Queen Latifah, Brittany Snow, Elijah Kelley and Zac Efron. Waters and the original Tracy, Ricki Lake, also make cameo appearances. The movie is available for rental on Google Play, YouTube, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.\n\n30. Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2001)\n\nHedwig and the Angry Inch is a cult dark comedy musical directed, written by and starring John Cameron Mitchell. The film is based on Stephen Trask's 1998 stage musical of the same name. The film follows an East German Pop star on a journey of fame, gender expression and love.\n\nThe titular Hedwig goes through a botched “gender reassignment surgery” early in the film. While the movie was groundbreaking in 2001 for its portrayal of a gender-nonconforming character, it has drawn controversy and criticism for prompting fear around gender-affirming care and its use of the cis-gay gaze. However, many still value the film as queer cinema. Hedwig and the Angry Inch is available for rental on Google Play, YouTube, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.\n\n29. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953)\n\nGentlemen Prefer Blondes is probably best remembered for the song “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” performed by Marilyn Monroe. The number has been referenced in the films Burlesque and Moulin Rouge! and by artists like Madonna and Megan Thee Stallion. However, this romantic comedy (based on the stage play and 1928 film of the same name) has a lot more to love about it.\n\nThe film follows two showgirls on a transatlantic cruise. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes currently holds an 88% on Rotten Tomatoes. While “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” is the standout song of the film, Jane Russel’s “Ain’t There Anyone Here For Love” has been notable for its queer themes. The film is currently streaming on Hulu.\n\n28. Phantom of the Paradise (1974)\n\nBrian De Palma’s Phantom of the Paradise is a rock horror comedy musical. If that sounds strange, it's because it kind of is. Loosely based on Phantom of the Opera, Faust and The Picture of Dorian Gray, Phantom of the Paradise is both strange and spellbinding.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews but was nominated for two Oscars. Phantom of the Paradise walks the line between parody and art film. It’s a must-watch for fans of The Rocky Horror Picture Show or Repo! The Genetic Opera. Since its release, it has garnered a cult following. Daft Punk also cited the film as inspiration. The film is available to stream with a premium subscription on Hulu and Sling TV.\n\n27. Little Shop of Horrors (1986)\n\nFrank Oz’s film adaptation of the 1982 Alan Menken and Howard Ashman off-Broadway musical of the same name is pure campy fun. Little Shop of Horrors is about a flower shop worker who discovers a sentient carnivorous plant.\n\nThe film features performances from Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, Vincent Gardenia, Steve Martin, Levi Stubbs, Jim Belushi, John Candy, Christopher Guest and Bill Murray. The film was praised for its music and practical effects. A remake of the movie was announced in 2020. However, it has since been canceled. Little Shop of Horrors is currently streaming on Sling TV.\n\n26. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971)\n\nBased on the 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory stars Gene Wilder and Peter Ostrum. The screenplay for the movie was written by Ronald Dahl, who also wrote the novel. However, Dahl disowned the film after an uncredited rewrite from David Seltzer.\n\nThe film follows a poor child as he wins a golden ticket to tour a secretive chocolatier's fantastical factory. Roger Ebert once called the film “Probably the best film of its sort since The Wizard of Oz.” The film's popularity led to a 2005 remake, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and a 2023 prequel, Wonka, starring Timothee Chalamet. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is currently streaming on Sling TV and Max.\n\n25. Coco (2017)\n\nCoco is an animated film from Pixar about the power of music and family. The film follows a young boy, Miguel, who becomes trapped in the land of the dead during Dia de los Muertos.\n\nCoco stars Anthony Gonzalez, Gael García Bernal, Benjamin Bratt and Edward James Olmos. Several of the actors also returned for the Spanish language dub. The film premiered in Mexico before coming to the U.S. about a month later. Coco won two Oscars for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song. The film is currently available to stream on Disney+.\n\n24. Grease (1978)\n\nGrease is cheesy, but that is what makes it great. The 1970s-does-1950s rom-com musical follows two high schoolers as they turn a summer romance into going steady. Grease stars John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John and Stockard Channing. The film has an iconic soundtrack with songs like “Summer Nights,” You're the One That I Want” and the Acadamy Award Nominated \"Hopelessly Devoted to You.”\n\nGrease has inspired a sequel- Grease 2, a live televised version and a prequel TV show- Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies. However, it’s hard to beat the original. Yes, all the high schoolers look like they are in their 30s, and it ends with a car flying into the sky, but that’s part of its charm. The film is currently streaming on Max.\n\n23. The Red Shoes (1948)\n\nDirected by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, The Red Shoes is loosely based on a fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen. The film follows a ballerina torn between love and her career. The film stars Moira Shearer in her film debut and features other well-established ballet dancers such as Robert Helpmann, Léonide Massine and Ludmilla Tchérina.\n\nThe film was nominated for five Academy Awards. The Red Shoes later received a digital restoration by the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The restoration corrected significant damage to the original negatives and was screened at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The Red Shoes is streaming for free on Tubi, Sling TV, The Roku Channel, Plex, Amazon Prime, and through Max with a subscription.\n\n22. The Muppet Movie (1979)\n\n“Why are there so many songs about rainbows?” The Muppet Movie is a road trip musical comedy featuring Jim Henson’s Muppets. The film is the first of eight full-length films to star the Muppets. The film stars Jim Henson and Frank Oz and features cameos by Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Orson Welles, Mel Brooks and the final film appearance of ventriloquist Edgar Bergen.\n\nWhile many of the Muppet movies have become musical classics, including The Muppets and The Muppet Christmas Carol, the original has some of the most iconic songs of the franchise, including “Rainbow Connection,” \"Movin' Right Along” and “The Magic Store.” The film is currently available to stream on Disney+.\n\n21. A Star is Born (1954)\n\nThere are four versions of A Star is Born, and three of the four are musicals. All of the musicals feature iconic leading performances by Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand and Lady Gaga, respectively, and follow a similar plot of an unknown’s rise to stardom.\n\nWhile all of these musicals are great, the original musical features outstanding performances by Garland and James Mason. For Garland, A Star is Born was a comeback as it was her first film after negotiating a release from her contract at MGM. She went on to earn an Oscar nomination for the role. The 1954 film is available to rent on Amazon Prime, while the 2018 remake is available on Hulu and Max.\n\n20. The Sound of Music (1965)\n\nThe Sound of Music is based on the Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II 1950s stage musical of the same name. The film follows a young nun named Maria as she becomes the governess for the von Trapp family in 1930s Austria and follows the family’s eventual escape from the Nazis to Switzerland.\n\nThe musical is loosely based on Maria von Trapp’s 1949 memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers. The film stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and was directed by Robert Wise. While on its release the film garnered mixed reviews, it went on to win five Academy Awards and surpassed Gone With The Wind to become the highest-grossing film of all time, a distinction it held for five years. The Sound of Music is currently streaming on Hulu and Disney+.\n\n19. Beauty and the Beast (1991)\n\nThe Disney Renaissance saw many iconic films such as The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Aladdin, Mulan and Hercules. Many are remembered for their music, and Beauty and the Beast is no exception.\n\nBased on Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont's fairytale of the same name, Beauty and the Beast follows Belle as she falls in love with a prince cursed to live as a terrifying beast in the French countryside. The songs for the film were composed by Alan Menken with lyrics by Howard Ashman. The two had previously worked on The Little Mermaid. However, Ashman died of AIDS-related complications before the release of the film. Beauty and the Beast went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Score and Best Original Song. It is available to stream on Sling and Disney+.\n\n18. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)\n\nVincente Minnelli and Judy Garland made six films (and one daughter) together. However, when it comes to musicals, Meet Me in St. Louis is their best film collaboration. Meet Me in St. Louis follows a family’s life from 1903 to 1904. The slice-of-life musical culminates in the 1904 World’s Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe film includes several iconic numbers but is probably best remembered for “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,” which was introduced in the film. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards and currently holds a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film is available for rental on Google Play, YouTube, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.\n\n17. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001)\n\nKabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, sometimes shortened to K3G, is a Bollywood family drama film. Starring ​​Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, the film follows the son of a wealthy family and the issues surrounding his disadvantageous marriage.\n\nDirected by Karan Johar, the film initially received mixed reviews but was a box office smash, breaking several records. The film's popularity led to Sony releasing a remixed soundtrack in 2002 called Klub K3G. K3G is available to stream on Netflix and Amazon Prime.\n\n16. Fiddler on the Roof (1971)\n\nThe story of a Jewish shtetl in early 20th-century Imperial Russia, Fiddler on the Roof follows a poor milkman named Tevye and his marriage-aged daughters. The film is based on the 1964 stage musical of the same name. Directed by Norman Jewison, the film stars Topol, Norma Crane and Leonard Frey.\n\nThe film was both a financial and critical success, amassing eight Academy Awards. In 2022, Fiddler's Journey to the Big Screen, a documentary about making the film, was released. The stage production of Fiddler on the Roof has been revived several times, including a Yiddish revival, and MGM announced plans to remake the film in 2020. The film is available for free on Tubi, Pluto TV and The Roku Channel. Fiddler on the Roof is also available to stream with an Amazon Prime subscription.\n\n15. 42nd Street (1933)\n\nThis pre-Code musical is a must-watch for its final musical numbers choreographed by Busby Berkeley. 42nd Street tells a classic story. A star is torn between a penniless actor and a wealthy financier. A young star steps out from the shadows because \"You're going out there a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!\"\n\n42nd Street isn’t a conventional musical. Most of the musical numbers happen during a play within the film. 42nd Street was a big hit for Warner Brothers, making over $1.5 million at the box office and the film was nominated for two Oscars at the 6th Academy Awards. It not only saved the studio from bankruptcy, but it also helped launch Hollywood’s golden age of movie musicals. It is currently streaming on Tubi.\n\n14. All That Jazz (1979)\n\nAll That Jazz is a semi-autobiographical look at the career of Bob Fosse. The film follows Joe Gideon, a theater director, choreographer, alcoholic and womanizer who has a heart attack while staging his latest play.\n\nThe film stars Roy Scheider, Jessica Lange, Ann Reinking, Leland Palmer, Cliff Gorman and Ben Vereen and was directed by Fosse. The film won the Palme d’Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival and went on to be nominated for nine Oscars. It is currently streaming on Tubi.\n\n13. Mother India (1957)\n\nScreenwriter and lyricist Javed Akhtar once wrote, “All Hindi films come from Mother India.” It’s one of several films, including 1960’s Mughal-e-Azam and the 1975 classic Sholay, which have had many rereleases in India. Mother India ran so continuously in theaters that some showed it into the mid-1990s, which caused there to be no reliable data on its final box office earnings.\n\nWith strong references to Indian nationalism and Hinduism, Mother India follows an impoverished woman’s struggle to raise her sons. The film was the first Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film. The film’s name comes from Katherine Mayo's 1927 book of the same name, which trashed Indian culture and society while prompting the British Raj. Mehboob Khan said of the name, “We have intentionally called our film Mother India, as a challenge to this book.” The film is currently available on Amazon Prime with Eros.\n\n12. An American In Paris (1951)\n\nAn American in Paris is a must-see musical of Hollywood’s golden age. Directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron, the film follows a young artist who has to choose between love and money in post-war Paris.\n\nAn American in Paris won six Oscars, including Best Picture. The film ends with a 17-minute dance/ballet sequence that is a visual masterpiece. It is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.\n\n11. Mary Poppins (1964)\n\nMary Poppins was directed by Robert Stevenson with songs by the Sherman Brothers. The film was based on P. L. Travers's book series about a magical nanny. The film stars Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, Glynis Johns and Hermione Baddeley.\n\nThe film was a smash hit. At the time of its release, it was the highest-grossing Disney film. Mary Poppins received 13 Oscar nominations and won five, including for best original song for “Chim Chim Cher-eye.” The film’s production inspired the 2013 biographical drama Saving Mr. Banks and the film also received a sequel, Mary Poppins Returns, in 2018. Mary Poppins is currently available to stream on Disney+.\n\n10. West Side Story (1961 and 2021)\n\nWhile the original West Side Story is a classic, it has a big brownface issue. Several white actors play Puerto Ricans in this film, including the lead, Natalie Wood. However, there is also a 2021 remake that omits the offensive practice starring Rachel Zegler. Both versions also feature the iconic Rita Moreno. Both films are wonderful adaptations of the 1957 musical of the same name from Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim.\n\nThe films are a modern retelling of Romeo and Juliet between 1950s New York street gangs. The original film won 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The 2021 remake received 7 Oscar nominations. Notably, Moreno and later Ariana DeBose both won Best Supporting Actress for their portrayal of Anita in their respective films, making them the only two Latinas to have won in the category. The 1960s version is available on Pluto TV and Tubi, while the 2021 remake is available on Disney+ and fuboTV.\n\n9. Top Hat (1935)\n\nTop Hat was the most successful of the nine movies that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made together at RKO Pictures. The film was directed by Mark Sandrich and features songs by Irving Berlin, most notably “Cheek to Cheek.”\n\nTop Hat follows an American dancer as he falls in love with a young woman and traipses from London to Venice. The film was well-received upon release and has since gained 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. In 1990, the film was preserved in the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.”Top Hat is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, VUDU, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.\n\n8. Stormy Weather (1943)\n\nStormy Weather can be a hard film to talk about since it features both black stereotypes and elements of minstrelsy. However, it’s a historically important musical with some of the greatest performances of Hollywood’s Golden Age. With performances from Lena Horne, Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Dooley Wilson and the Nicholas Brothers, Stormy Weather has a complex legacy.\n\nThe film features 20 musical numbers. The Nicholas Brothers’ “Jumpin’ Jive” dance sequence is especially spellbinding and was a favorite of Fred Astaire, who called it \"the greatest movie musical number” he had ever seen. It is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, VUDU, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.\n\n7. The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)\n\nThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a French New Wave opera. It has long been a favorite of filmmakers. Greta Gerwig cited The Umbrellas of Cherbourg as an influence for Barbie, and Damien Chazelle noted it as an inspiration for La La Land.\n\nThe film follows star-crossed young lovers in Normandy. The movie stars Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo and was written and directed by Jacques Demy. Deneuve also starred in Demy’s next musical, ​​The Young Girls of Rochefort, in 1967. The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is currently streaming on Max.\n\n6. RRR (2022)\n\nRRR is a true epic. The over 3-hour Tollywood (or Telugu cinema) film follows fictionalized versions of revolutionaries Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem as they fight the British Raj. Directed by S. S. Rajamouli and starring N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan, RRR was the first Telugu film to be nominated for a Golden Globe. The song \"Naatu Naatu\" also won the Oscar for Best Original Song.\n\nRRR gained both commercial and critical success. Director Edgar Wright said it was “the only film I have ever seen where the intermission card itself got a round of applause.\" The film also became the third highest-grossing Indian film of all time with a $170 million worldwide gross. It is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n5. Funny Girl (1968)\n\nFunny Girl, based on the book and stage musical of the same name, loosely follows the life of comedian Fanny Brice and her relationship with gambler Nicky Arnstein. The film gained both critical and commercial success and earned eight Academy Award Nominations.\n\nThe film stars Barbra Streisand and Omar Sharif. Sharif was almost replaced for being Egyptian when the Six-Day War began between Israel and Egypt. However, director William Wyler and Streisand threatened to quit if executives replaced him. The film has also received praise for its portrayal of Jewish womanhood. It is currently available to stream on Amazon Prime.\n\n4. Chicago (2002)\n\nChicago centers around two Jazz age performers and murderesses, Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, as they balance fame and infamy in the 1920s. One musical and three movies have been based on the original 1926 stage play. However, the film Chicago pulls from the 1975 Broadway musical version.\n\nChicago stars Renée Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Many attribute the success of Chicago for ushering in a resurgence in the musical movie genre. The film won six Academy Award, and became the first musical since 1968’s Oliver! to win Best Picture. It is currently streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n3. The Wizard of Oz (1939)\n\nThe Wizard of Oz is a cultural juggernaut. Directed by Victor Fleming and starring Judy Garland, the film follows Dorthy on a journey of self-realization after she is sucked into the fantasy land of Oz. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards and won three, including Best Original Song for “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”\n\nRoger Ebert said of the film, “It somehow seems real and important in a way most movies don't.” The Wizard of Oz was based on L. Frank Baum's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and both the book and the film have led to many spin-offs and reimaginings, including The Wiz, Journey Back to Oz, Return to Oz, and, Wicked, which is being made into a two-part film in 2024 and 2025. The Wizard of Oz is currently streaming on Max.\n\n2. Singin’ in the Rain (1952)\n\nDirected by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, Singin' in the Rain is a loving tribute to and parody of Hollywood in the late 1920s. The film follows three actors, played by Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds, as they make the jump from silent pictures to “talkies.”\n\nSingin' in the Rain was nominated for two Academy Awards, including Best Scoring of a Musical Picture. In 1989, it was one of the first 25 films selected by the National Film Registry to be added to the Library of Congress. Singin' in the Rain has become a cultural touch point and has been directly referenced in A Clockwork Orange, Glee, Silver Linings Playbook and served as an inspiration for La La Land. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n1. Cabaret (1972)\n\nBased on the Broadway Musical of the same name and the 1939 novel Goodbye to Berlin by Christopher Isherwood, Cabaret captures the last days of the Weimar Republic. The film was directed by Bob Fosse and starred Liza Minnelli, Michael York and Joel Grey.\n\nCabaret was controversial upon its release for its portrayal of the rise of the Nazis, historical antisemitism and bisexual identities. However, the film won eight Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Actress. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMovie musicals are a diverse and rich genre that combines music, dance and storytelling. While many movie musicals start as Broadway plays, musicals come from many origins and fit into numerous subgenres. It can be hard to know where to begin for non-musical fans, but the movies on this list represent the best the genre has to offer. So… come hear the music play."
