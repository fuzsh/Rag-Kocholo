        "text": "Ryan Murphy will continue his pursuit of bringing Broadway to the small screen with a limited series based on the Tony- and Pulitzer Prize-winning musical 1975 A Chorus Line. The 10-part adaptation is in the early stages of development as part of the media mogul's deal with Netflix.\n\nNo word yet on a production timeline for the project, or further detailsâ€”including how Murphy intends to expand the 100-minute musical into a long-form narrative.\n\nMurphy, who won a Tony Award earlier this year for the revival of The Boys in the Band, is also developing a Netflix adaptation of said Mart Crowley play, as well as a movie version of the recent Broadway comedy The Prom (with a cast including Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and James Corden).\n\nAdditional Netflix projects include the upcoming anthology series The Politician starring Ben Platt (premiering September 27), the One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest prequel Ratched with Sarah Paulson, and Hollywood, starring Holland Taylor and the newly announced Patti LuPone.\n\nA Chorus Line, conceived by director-choreographer Michael Bennett and featuring a score by Marvin Hamlisch and Edward Kleban, navigates the high-energy and heartbreaking process of auditioning for a Broadway musical, informed by the accounts of the performers who first brought the show to life."
