        "text": "All due respect this angle of criticism is stupid as shit. This person is mad at the movie for not being something that it explicitly says it isn’t on the tin. If you’re going to be mad at Dominik’s more juvenile and crass directorial decisions such as the POV vagina shot or the JFK blowjob sequence then whatever I get that but I’ve seen enough people on twitter feigning outrage at a movie they haven’t seen based on a book they don’t know exists to effectively declare media literacy dead for the rest of my earthly life\n\nYou’re missing the point. Simply, this film is exploitive, hateful, and gross. I haven’t seen anyone saying media literacy is dead. I just see people rightly saying this movie is trash.\n\nThe relative features and bugs of the movie have been wildly hyperbolized and overstated by a huge number of people that haven’t seen the movie and don’t even pretend to know what it’s about. The way people are speaking about this movie you would think it is 2 and a half hours of explicit rape scenes, which I was earnestly concerned about after the first 20 minutes or so, but that’s not the case at all\n\nDominik’s portrayal of Marilyn is also, as I mentioned, often crass, misogynistic and distasteful (to say nothing of the weird abortion stuff) and he has gone mask off on the press tour of late and revealed himself to be a tremendous asshole. I don’t need to be told to re evaluate my life and worldview or whatever just bc I’m capable of understanding both things to be true\n\ni was telling my wife it’s filmed like a scene from bryan cranston in malcom in the middle for laughs and then he proceeds to beat the shit out of her. embarrassing filmmaking\n\nlol please reevaluate\n\nI never really knew much about her personal life, and obviously biopics take artistic liberties, but stuff like the abortion and the attempted drowning were completely made up? What was the point of this? Considering they went out of their way not to name DiMaggio, Miller, and Kennedy, why not just make a movie where everyone knows who it is modeled after without naming them as such and bringing in all of this scrutiny?\n\nmy mind went to Lacan…\n\n“In 1957, in his Seminar Les formations de l'inconscient, Lacan introduces the concept of objet petit a as the imaginary part-object, an element which is imagined as separable from the rest of the body. In the Seminar Le transfert (1960–1961) he articulates objet a with the term agalma(Greek, an ornament). Just as the agalma is a precious object hidden in a worthless box, so objet petit a is the object of desire which we seek in the other. The \"box\" can take many forms, all of which are unimportant, the importance lies in what is \"inside\" the box, the cause of desire.”\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objet_petit_a\n\nMy random thoughts...\n\nIt's kind of a mess tbh.\n\nAna's accent goes in and out.\n\nThe Charlie Jr. and Edward Jr stuff was interesting, though it's completely made up.\n\nEven if you go in knowing its supposed to be fiction like the book, I can't say it was a good movie."
