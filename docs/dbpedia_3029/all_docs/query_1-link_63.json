        "text": "Among the changes attending puberty is the condemnation of certain childhood pastimes. “In sixth grade, we could still play tag in school without it being weird,” the fourteen-year-old Caspian explains. “But in seventh grade anyone who wanted to do that was stupid.” Another development, which Caspian awaits with trepidation, is the changing of his voice. This adjustment will be particularly fraught for him, a member of the renowned Stockholm Boys’ Choir. “I feel like I’ll lose something when my voice breaks,” he says. “I’m not looking forward to that. I like my soprano voice.” Some boys he sings with, profiled along with him in the documentary “The Voice Break Choir,” have already lost theirs.\n\nIt’s for Caspian and his cohort—young male singers passing through the crucible of puberty—that the “voice break choir” exists. Many boy choristers quit when their voices change; this ensemble allows them to keep singing through the squawky cracks and register changes. Martina Carlstedt, who co-directed the documentary, learned of the group through a morning TV show, in 2017. Watching them perform, “I was really touched by seeing them being so brave,” she said. “Standing there and, with their fragile, broken voices, singing—I think it was Backstreet Boys.”\n\nShe and her co-director, Ina Holmqvist, had already been contemplating a film about boys transitioning to adulthood. (Previously, they’d made movies about adolescent girls.) The voice-break choir offered an entry point. “We really thought it was a good metaphor for this time in life,” Holmqvist said. In the film, the choristers perform songs with lyrics derived from their own interviews in the documentary, in which they bare their young souls. “Maybe I’m just weird. / Is there something wrong with me?” the fourteen-year-old Dan sings, worried about his lack of interest in the soccer his classmates play. “I just like other things, / Like drawing figures.”\n\nHe’s not alone in his doubts. “I don’t think I’m a typical boy,” Ludwig says, also fourteen, in an interview. “Right now, at this age, I’m hanging around more with girls, since they’re easier to talk to.” The fifteen-year-old Andrey, on the other hand, can’t bring himself to ask out the girl he longs to take to prom. “If she turns me down, everyone will laugh at me,” he frets.\n\n“You need to think about what you want,” the choir’s conductor, Karin Skogberg Ankarmo, tells Andrey. Ostensibly, she’s talking to him about his commitment to the choir. But, as often happens in the film, statements about singing resonate with adolescence generally. So it goes with remarks that the young men themselves make, as when the fifteen-year-old Simon tells Ankarmo that he wants to explore what he can do, or when Caspian, reflecting on his imminent voice change, recognizes that he’s gaining something even as he loses a piece of himself.\n\nThis attitude of self-discovery is something Holmqvist hopes will stick with viewers. Interviewing these young men was inspiring, she told me, because they’re so willing to adapt and evolve. “Puberty is not only something ugly and uncomfortable; it can also be strengthening,” she said. Whether apprehensive or excited about their new phase of adolescence, all of the boys are keenly attuned to the process of transformation. “I’ve matured a little, I guess,” the fourteen-year-old Ruben says. “But I still have a bit left. I hope. It would be sad if this is as mature as I’ll be.”"
