        "text": "I am sick of actors getting sick in the movies and on TV shows.\n\nYou can’t escape it. It’s hard to find a show on the big or little screen where you aren’t forced to watch as a character tosses up the goods.\n\nThe latest for me was The Judge, which is out on DVD. It’s a decent film starring two great actors — Robert Downey Jr. along with Robert Duvall, who was nominated for best actor Oscar this year. (Good as he was, he did not come close to winner Eddie Redmayne’s excellent performance as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything.)\n\nI watched as — spewler alert! — the Downey Jr. character runs into another lawyer who’s upchucking. Then it happened again. I think it was on the third encounter that Downey Jr. joined in the blowing chunks chorus.\n\nTo quote a character from another legal movie that’s a classic, explain it to me like I’m a six-year-old why we need to see and hear so much vomiting in the movies? (It’s been a while since I’ve seen Philadelphia but given the subject matter and Tom Hanks character’s condition, it wouldn’t surprise me if there was a throw-up scene or two in there.)\n\nTo be sure, there is a lot of crassness in movies and TV these days. TV especially seems to choke with delight on the penis word. You only have to tune into any episode of Two and a Half Men to hear it and even a good sitcom like The Big Bang Theory can’t resist the temptation to use the ‘p’ word from time to time.\n\nThere are plenty of other examples of crudity but it seems vomiting is in a class — or, rather, crass — all its own.\n\nIt’s gone from a trend to a torrent of gross stuff splashing on the shores of cinema. And we’re being forced to bath in its vile spew.\n\nWhy? Is Hollywood so bereft of imagination that directors feel they need to display this to viewers in the same way that some feel the need to show some skin to get people to open their wallets?\n\nPerhaps at one point, vomiting was funny, shocking, relevant — and novel. Growing up in the 1970s, after the “barf gates opened” in cinema according to The Guardian’s movie critic Anne Billson, I recall those moments. Remember Linda Blair in The Exorcist? The regurgitation redux in Alien? Or Chong’s reaction when the fuzz asks his name in Up in Smoke (“His name is Rawlph,” Cheech says of his partner who has fallen over his lap.)\n\nFood triggers have caused a veritable vomit feast in the movies. There was the mint that set off Mr. Creosote in Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life, the blueberry pies in Stand By Me and Jack Nicholson’s upchucking of cherries in The Witches of Eastwick.\n\nBillson, who does a fine job of expounding on the history of puke in the movies— from the “first instance of explicit vomiting” in 1953’s The Wages of Fear to the “king of puke” Ingmar Bergman, through the 1970s and to the present, — wondered in 2010 if a full-throttle 3D throw-up wasn’t in the works. I’m afraid to check to see if that prediction has come to pass.\n\nShe breaks down vomiting scenes to six main causes: pregnancy, inebriation, illness (including poison-induced), gluttony, shock and demonic possession “with bulimia as a recent addition.”\n\nShe isn’t the only Guardian critic to wax splenetic over moving picture vomit. Joe Queenan, who has often spoken out against this “abhorrent trend,” said in 2007 that he hoped his criticisms might lead to someone realizing that “on-screen vomiting had become a cliché, and perhaps replace it with something classier and more dramatically cutting-edge, like ear-cleaning or nose-picking.”\n\nIt didn’t work, he said. “It’s enough to make your stomach turn.”\n\nChallenged by his children to prove the pervasiveness of puke in movies, Queenan tried a simple test. He rented five movies, selected at random and mostly new releases, to see how much vomiting took place. All but one had scenes of a character throwing up and even that one, The Good German, has Tobey Maguire’s face being jammed into a toilet.\n\n“To me, any attempt to separate puking into a toilet bowl from getting your face stuffed into a toilet bowl is to draw a distinction without a difference,” Queenan wrote. “I am sure Tobey Maguire feels the same way.”\n\nIt’s not just movie critics who have noticed. Discussion boards on the Internet are throwing back on all the throw-up scenes in film although you do get the discretionary vomit appreciator to chime in, such as “dead of night” who feels it’s never “gratuitous.” Vomit, he says, “always has a meaning. It conveys a message. In real life though, vomit can be meaningless. I once saw a student vomit in the hallway. I just tried to get away. But in film, watch out! Vomit is very important.”\n\nThanks for the cue there dude.\n\nOthers wonder how the movies make vomiting look real. (The answer — green screen…or maybe vegetable soup.)\n\nWebsites cheer this Cinema Pukedom. There are the “most disgusting” and “greatest” vomit scenes lists, complete with gallery of images and video. You can watch the best of projectile vomiting and read one discerning vomiteer’s treatment of the subject even though he decries the precious little that has been written about the history of vomiting in the movies. (Tsk, tsk.)\n\nSometimes, the virtual vomit is all too real and audiences are sent reeling as in 2012 Sundance Film Festival where the movie V/H/S reportedly caused people to throw up and have seizures. The release of the movie 127 Hours also triggered discussion about the affect movies can have on viewers including, yes, throwing up.\n\nIt’s not just the big screen either. One Facebook page calls itself “THERE’S TOO MUCH VOMITING ON TV NOWADAYS!!”\n\nIf vomiting is affecting the strongest of stomachs out there, imagine what it’s doing to people with emetophobia — those with an intense, irrational fear or anxiety about vomiting. It takes a particular kind of self-discipline to be able to watch such a scene without covering your eyes and ears but there is at least one curious case of a filmgoer who is okay with “Puke-a-Palooza” in horrors.\n\nA co-worker and friend was fond of using the expression “we’re circling the drain” in reference to the financial health of a company. I think we’re circling another kind of drain, the waste pipe at the bottom of the toilet where a lot of this Hollywood vomit ends up.\n\nWe remember the false story of the ancient Roman ‘vomitoria,’ those supposed chambers were people would purge after a feast so they could return for seconds. The modern day equivalent may just be in the movies today.\n\nI think it’s time for a moratorium on vomiting in film. A vomitoriamoratorium as it were.\n\n’Cause we’re sick to the stomach of all your puke."
