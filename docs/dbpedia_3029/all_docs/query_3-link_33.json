        "text": "One day in May 1975, Cy Feuer and Ernest Martin - two movie producers best known for ''Cabaret'' - made an offer to Joseph Papp, the producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival. They would pay $150,000 for the film rights to his new musical.\n\nNo matter that the musical had not opened. No matter that it was only in previews in a 299-seat theater downtown. Insiders had already heard that this show, something about dancers called ''A Chorus Line,'' was remarkable. When Mr. Feuer and Mr. Martin had seen the first preview performance, they cried. ''And all that notwithstanding,'' Mr. Martin recalls, ''we knew it was a good property.''\n\nMr. Feuer and Mr. Martin got their chance to turn ''A Chorus Line'' into a movie. But only now, nine years and millions of dollars later, is the film being shot, in the Mark Hellinger Theater under the direction of Richard Attenborough. Between 1975 and 1984, such writing, directing and marketing talents as Mike Nichols, Sidney Lumet, Allan Carr, Bo Goldman and Joel Schumacher - as well as Mr. Papp and Michael Bennett, the two chief creators of ''A Chorus Line'' - failed to bring the film to fruition.\n\nSome of them lost energy or interest, but most could not surmount two recurring problems. One was financial: how to make profitable a movie with an unusually expensive royalty package. The other was creative: how to bring a brilliant musical to the screen without merely copying it. Mr. Feuer and Mr. Martin are both the first and last suitors in one of the most frustrating and fascinating courtships between Broadway and Hollywood.\n\n''A Chorus Line'' is an extreme example, but its history suggests the difficulties that arise whenever the theater and film industries try to do business - the intricate collaboration, the tug-of-war between creative and financial interests, and the mutual wariness between the East Coast and West Coast species of the show business animal. ''Of all the films and shows I've worked with over the years, 'A Chorus Line' has drawn more lightning to it than any of them,'' said Gordon Stulberg, the president of PolyGram Corporation, which has been trying to make the film since 1980. ''There's a love for this show because of what it's about - kids trying to make it in show business. And there's a curiosity about this show, because it's probably taken longer to get it on screen than any successful Broadway show ever.'' Yet rarely has the pursuit of a Broadway play by film producers ever begun more quickly. Mr. Feuer and Mr. Martin made their $150,000 offer after the first preview. Peter Guber, then an executive at Columbia Pictures, offered $400,000 on opening night at the Public Theater, May 21, 1975. After the unanimous rave reviews, the stakes rose even faster - up to $1 million, then to $3 million within weeks. The Shakespeare Festival, already planning to move ''A Chorus Line'' to Broadway, turned down all the bids. ''We were in no rush,'' remembered Bernard Gersten, the associate producer of the festival from 1960 to 1978. ''People just kept raising the stakes.''\n\nNed Tanen, then president of Universal Pictures, emerged as the most serious and persistent buyer; when Frank Weisberg, the Shakespeare Festival's lawyer, went to Mexico on a family vacation, Mr. Tanen flew down after him. In early 1976, Mr. Weisberg announced a deal was imminent. Mr. Papp summoned the ''Chorus Line'' family to his office for champagne.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
