        "text": "EXTINCTION\n\nEXTINCTION\n\nEXTINCTION\n\nEXTINCTION\n\nExperience the sound of the ecosystem with the highest biodiversity on Earth\n\nthrough headphones\n\nDUSK CHORUS\n\nBased on Fragments of Extinction\n\n(2017)\n\nDuration: 62 min.\n\nWritten and narrated by David Monacchi\n\nDirectors: Nika Šaravanja, Alessandro D’Emilia\n\nCinematography: Alessandro D’Emilia\n\nEditing: Otis Buri\n\nA co-production ZeLIG – Fragments of Extinction\n\nFormat: full HD\n\nSound: 5.1 dolby surround sound from 3D research field recordings\n\nAn exploration through remote primary equatorial forests, the project Fragments of Extinction uses sound as a medium to reflect on the current global extinction crisis. The film portrays the fieldwork of eco-acoustics researcher and project’s founder David Monacchi, who is on a quest to record 24-hour 3-dimensional sonic portraits in the area with the assessed highest biodiversity on Earth. Through beautiful and immersive cinematography and directing, Alessandro D’Emilia and Nika Saravanja follow the progress of this urgent project, incorporating Monacchi’s lecture footage, which manages to accessibly impart the complexity of the issues at hand. During the film the focus shifts from incredible images to a spectacular surround listening experience. It’s as if the viewers themselves are in the middle of the rainforest – they hear insects, birds, amphibians, mammals and even trees in a three-dimensional polyphony of nature. The result is a careful balance between Monacchi’s scientific yet deeply philosophical relationship with the environment and the urgent plight of communities and creatures that are facing the impact of habitat loss, invasive industry and climate change. Dusk Chorus (2017) is an enduring contemplation and poetic journey on some of the often-overlooked aspects that make an ecosystem diverse, unique, and fragile.\n\nOfficial selections and Awards:\n\nVisions du Reèl – Nyon (International premiere)\n\nGreen Film Festival – Seoul\n\nCinemambiente – Torino AWARD – Best Italian Documentary\n\nDurban International Film Festival – Durban AWARD – Best International Documentary\n\nIran International Film Festival – Teheran\n\nDokuFest – Prizren\n\nGlobal Eco Film Festival – Zurich\n\nInnsbruck Nature Film Festival – Innsbruck AWARD – Best International Documentary\n\nBifed – Istanbul AWARD – Best International Doc (student jury)\n\nCervino Cinemountain – Aosta\n\nImagine Science Film Festival – New York (North America premiere)\n\nPlanet in Focus Environmental Film Festival – Toronto\n\nCineEco – Serra da Estrela AWARD – Best International Documentary\n\nJihlava IFF – Prague\n\nCinema Planeta – Mexico\n\nJihlava International documentary Film Festival – Prague\n\nInconvenient Films Film Festival – Vilnius\n\nMountain International Film Festival – Graz\n\nInScience Dutch International Film Festival – Nijmegen AWARD – Best International Documentary\n\nFricine Socioenvironmental Film Festival – Rio De Janeiro\n\nInternational Human Rights Film Festival – Nurnberg\n\nEnvironmental Film Festival – Washington\n\nSignes de Nuit – Paris AWARD – Best International Documentary\n\nFestival of Tolerance – Zagreb\n\nSignes de Nuit – Berlin\n\nGreen Film Festival UEA – Norwick UK\n\nInternational Documentary Film Festival Beldocs – Belgrad\n\nGreen Image Film Festival – Tokyo AWARD – Green Image award\n\nInternational Wildlife Film Festival – Montana\n\nEcozine Film Festival – Zaragoza AWARD – Best International Film\n\nFestival International de Cinema e Video Ambiental – Brazil AWARD – Best International Film\n\nTrento film Festival – Trento\n\nSignes de Nuit – Bangkok Special Mention – International Documentaries\n\nScience Fiction Film Festival – Trieste\n\nSavonlinna International Film Festival – Finland\n\nInternational Film Festival Ebesrwalde – Berlin\n\nGreen Film Festival – San Francisco\n\nInternational Science Film Festival – Saint Petersburg AWARD – Jury Prize\n\nBridge Film Festival – Verona AWARD – Jury Prize\n\nFuorinorma – Roma\n\nEuropean Academy of Science Film – Vienna AWARD – Best European Science Film 2017-2018"
