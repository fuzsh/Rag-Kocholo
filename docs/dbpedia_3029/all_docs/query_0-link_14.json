His creative pursuits span different mediums including poster art, album artwork, movie posters, video projections for live shows, and music video clips. Lépine has been working as an independent artist since graduating from the graphic design program at Université du Quebec à Montreal in 2000.\n\nLépine’s poster art is characterized by the use of a technique evocative of photomontage: he overlays images and text, creating a striking interplay of transparencies and negative space. A constant stream of music fuels Lépine’s creative imagination and vibrant energy is translated into his poster art.\n\nThis movie by Montrealer François Delisle tells the story of a divorced couple forced to reunite when the remains of their son are discovered eight years after he went missing when his disappearance was what caused them to separate in the first place. This movie has won several awards at Fünf Seen Film Festival and Indianapolis International Film Festival, as well as having been nominated at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThis silkscreen poster was hand-printed by the artist himself and is in excellent condition. less"
