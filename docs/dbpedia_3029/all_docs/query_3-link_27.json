Martin\n\nOverview\n\nA casting call for dancers goes out all over the country. The production is large and the director has a reputation for being demanding. We follow a group of hopefuls as they go through the audition process and watch as, one by one, their fellow dancers are eliminated from contention in some very direct and humiliating ways. The huge contingency of dancers is finally narrowed down to just 12 and there are only a few spots remaining. With some award-winning songs and some of the most dynamic dance scenes ever filmed, we get to watch as the director decides which one of these hopefuls gets the remaining parts and which ones have to go home and live with the disappointment."
