        "text": "First of all, can you tell us a little about yourself?\n\nI am a member of a family of 9 children in Mardin, which has cherished many cultures and religions for centuries. I grew up in a city that speaks Kurdish, Arabic, Syriac and Turkish. I can say that this multicultural environment fed my work. I started working at a young age. I worked in different jobs such as shoe shine, sweets sales to the public, waitress, photography. However, my encounter with art started with photography. I had the opportunity to improve myself by doing photography (at Foto Halit) for many years. However, I continued my education. In 2006, I received cinema training for about six weeks within the scope of the Kent film house opened in Mardin by the Communication Design Department of the Faculty of Art and Design of Istanbul Kultur University, and at the end of these trainings, short films were shot. The successes I showed in the workshop opened the doors for me to start my education at Istanbul Kultur University, Faculty of Art and Design, Department of Communication Design, with a 100% scholarship. This door I entered meant a new beginning and a new excitement for me. Now it was time to take a break from photography and express my thoughts with moving images. I had the opportunity to make many films and documentaries. These films were screened at national and international festivals and received awards. I would like to thank my family, friends and teachers for their support throughout this process.\n\nHow did you decide to work on documentary film?\n\nIn a documentary film, it is necessary to determine the subject and method well. Topics can be very sensitive at times. You need to have knowledge of the subject you are going to shoot. Because the subject you will tell will be watched by everyone, you should not make mistakes in this direction. We did not have taboos in this sense, but we had to have a good grasp of everything related to the subject, since the subject was multiculturalism and religious elements. We were guests at the homes of the character we chose for the shoot, and we shot for hours. After all, you enter people's private areas, at first you are afraid to cause discomfort, but they all made us incredibly welcome. Sometimes we had to shoot in a mosque, church or mausoleum or in the Synagogue, which created a different situation for each location.\n\nWhat are the difficulties of documentary filmmaking in Turkey?\n\nDocumentary filmmakers generally have to carry out their work based on their own budgets. In addition, documentary projects are set out with the support of private sponsors and institutions. The hardest part of making a documentary is the financial part of the production in Turkey, because Anatolian geography offers all kinds of generosity as a subject. After making a documentary film, the screening and presentation of the film is also a separate process because we can only screen the film in national and international festivals, of course, it is necessary to directly attend the festival program and pass the sifting of the established juries. Sometimes it can be impossible to pass this mechanism. All these problems are some of the problems that may arise for a documentary filmmaker.\n\nHow good of a documentary watcher are we as a society?\n\nAs a society, our perspective on documentary is not good, unfortunately, we do not give the necessary value to documentary. I want to share a memory here; We were looking for a place to shoot a documentary. We stopped by a small restaurant on the side of the road to have a rest. After a short conversation with the waiter, we are Anatolian people. The waiter friend asks the popular question, \"What are you shooting?\" My assistant director jumped up excitedly and said, \"We're going to shoot a documentary, and now we're looking at the venue.\" After the waiter thought about it for a while, “Oh, I got it, it's an animal documentary…” Unfortunately, our approach to documentary as a society is at this level, however, documentary sheds light on societies and future generations, strengthens intercultural communication, immortalizes these cultures and contributes to the development of society. As a society, we experience that documentary is not given the necessary value.\n\nWhat kind of subjects do you focus on in your documentaries?\n\nI have been working on documentary cinema for about ten years. In our work with my team, we deal with different topics such as multiculturalism, human stories and lifestyles. Of course, when the subject is people and the main theme of your film is the human story, the job becomes more serious. Because in the work you will do, you will include the subjects of his life and you will do this through the camera. This is the case for his whole life in a remote corner of Anatolia, in his village, in his vineyard, in his garden or at home, in ordinary calmness, and as he passes by, someone comes out and says, \"I'm going to make a movie for you,\" with his camera in hand. It often takes some time for him to accept this situation. The film director has a lot of work to do here, for example, when we go to the person, it is very important how to communicate with that person, it should be in a way that will not hurt or offend him.\n\nWhat do you think about the representations of the documentary genre in Turkish cinema? Do you have any hope for new filmmakers in this regard?\n\nThanks to the developing technology, we can see documentary films produced with new narrative styles or new perspectives, apart from mainstream documentary directors. This production process is promising.\n\nDid you experience an event on the set that left a mark in your life or that affected you greatly?\n\nIn 2009, we were shooting the documentary \"Scream\", a documentary about the culture of lamentation in Mardin. The culture of lament is a tradition that still lives in Anatolia and dates back to ancient times. It is impossible to forget the voices of the deeply grieving women lamenting in these shots. In his laments, you see the longing for love, the purest and most delicate forms of love, and this had a great impact on me.\n\nCan you talk about your perspective on the documentary? Why documentary?\n\nDocumentary cinema differs formally from fictional film, the depth and reality it contains are very meaningful for me. Here, of course, you have to use all the basic rules of cinema, you cannot make a movie without the language of cinema. You feel the sincerity and effort in the documentary, and if you grew up and lived in this geography as a culture, you find yourself in the documentary. I have always been interested in human stories and different cultures, and the best way to study this is through documentary cinema.\n\nWhat do you think, how rapidly developing technology can contribute to short films and documentaries? What does it take?\n\nWhen we look at the number of documentary films made over the years, we see that it is increasing every year, and this parallelism is also compatible with technology. Here, technology increases production, I think, many films are made in terms of quantity. Because the developing tools and equipment are very helpful to many directors in making their films. Since the documentary teams work with small budgets, this is a positive development for documentarians. Although the increase in the number of documentaries is nice here, it is not possible for a documentary filmmaker to buy every camera, which may have reduced the quality compared to previous productions. In the past, the film producer and director had to choose the subject well, as he had to use his budget well, he had to evaluate the time very well, the length of time meant inflating the budget. Nowadays, thanks to technology, many people find the opportunity to make films, which leads to different ideas and a new way of expression in line with these ideas. In this respect, a positive result is obtained.\n\nWho are the local directors you take as an example, whose cinema you love?\n\nI have people whom I exemplify in terms of documentary cinema and masters whose work I respect and inspire. For example, Süha Arın, one of the pioneers of documentary cinema, has undeniable contributions to the development of Turkish documentary cinema. I learned a lot from my master Ertuğrul Karslıoğlu Hazan Özgen For example, I am an adult whom I take as an example in terms of approach to documentary, working style, communication and style. For example, Hakan Aytekin has shed light on the Turkish documentary genre with his innovative narrative style and different approach to documentary, for example, there are other directors whose names I cannot mention, but these are the people I care about and take as an example.\n\nWhat would you like to say about film festivals in Turkey and their approach to short filmmakers?\n\nHundreds of festivals are held every year in Turkey, if a festival cannot find a film to show, it is not possible for the festival to take place, which is one of the conditions of many festivals. However, we see that many festivals in Turkey do not give the necessary value to short film directors and producers and do not give their rights to their efforts. Many documentary films are either competed in festivals or are screened under the name of screening in compressed sessions, where there is no financial return to the producer and the thought that this work is not good when it does not receive an award. Many jury members in festivals are either composed of professors from some universities or go by a few names. Although there are many different festivals, you can see the same jury there. Or, the professors at the known university can give awards to their students in order to highlight their own institution, which means that all ethical values ​​are lost.\n\nWhy is it necessary to make documentaries? What effect do you think it has, especially on social memory?\n\nDocumentary cinema is fed by the life style, political and cultural structure of society, that is, from people, it records what people do and records that period. Since there are independent directors, there are many independent studies in terms of approaching events, topics and ideas. All of these can trigger a lot of awareness, from the point of understanding and explaining the society to the point of being aware and thinking. As a society with little reading, documentary cinema should be an alternative warning mechanism to society.\n\nFinally, can you talk about your future plans?\n\nI am currently conducting my academic studies. Besides, I continue to make documentaries. I take part in many national and international festivals in my works. We have received many awards as a team here, there will be a few works that I am working on from now on. Again, touching people and containing human stories…\n\nWe would like to thank Lecturer Ahmet Bikic for answering our questions.\n\nFilms Directed, Awards Won and Festivals Attended\n\n2009 / The Scream / Documentary/ Duration: 00:13:52\n\n3.
