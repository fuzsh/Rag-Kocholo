Donate today and help bring A Praise Chorus to life.\n\nLogline\n\nTwo estranged bandmates must reunite after three years to perform at the memorial service of their drummer and best friend.\n\nSynopsis\n\nA Praise Chorus follows Jesse and Isabel, former bandmates, and (maybe, still) soulmates as they reunite after three years apart to honor the wish of their late drummer and best friend. Tasked with performing an old song at Ryan’s memorial service, they find themselves at a crossroads– and must decide to rebuild their relationship or release it.\n\nIsabel is pragmatic, smart, and bound by a self-imposed sense of obligation that tethers her to her current life. Ryan’s passing prompts her to confront her truths and strive for greater honesty. Meanwhile, Jesse is charismatic, brilliant, yet emotionally stunted. Having cut off many of his relationships and relocated three years prior, his self-imposed isolation leads him to reevaluate his connections after Ryan’s death.\n\nWhen they meet to rehearse, Jesse and Isabel perform as the adults they think they should be. However, they constantly slip into their shared rhythm of references and inside jokes, a language they can’t speak with anyone else. Isabel’s anxiety is palpable as she emphasizes their responsibility to perform the song and honor Ryan’s memory. As they rehearse, unresolved tensions simmer, culminating in a confrontation about their relationship’s abrupt ending. Their argument remains unresolved as guests begin to arrive, depriving them of the chance to rehearse the song at all. When the performance starts, Isabel falters, prompting Jesse to step in. Together, they navigate the song amidst a montage of memories honoring Ryan.\n\nOverwhelmed by the weight of the moment, Jesse breaks down mid-performance, prompting Isabel to be by his side in a moment of shared grief.\n\nMeet the Filmmakers\n\nAbigail Pañares – Writer/Director/Producer\n\nAbigail Pañares is a filmmaker and arts administrator who’s proud to call the Bay Area her home.
