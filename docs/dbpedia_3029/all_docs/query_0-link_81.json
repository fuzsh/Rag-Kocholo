        "text": "This has been the talk of the Internet lately. Let me list what I have said previously:\n\n1. 4, 25, 28, 30, 33, 34, 35, 38, 41, 47, 53, 57, 64, 79, 81, 85, 87, 88, 91, 93, 96, and the second 100 do not belong.\n\n2. I have not seen 80 or the first 100, but that one has not come out in the United States yet.\n\nI made a top 100 for 2000-2009 a long time ago and I actually made a top 100 for 2010-2015 on Sunday. I have not started a century list, though.\n\nTop 100 2000-2009: Top Hundred Films of the 2000's (Decade).\n\nTop 100 2010-2015: Top Hundred Films of the 2010's.\n\nI've cooled on it since it was released. It was certainly one of the more unique, personal films that I've ever watched and I find it great; however, each rewatch seemed longer, especially most recently. It's a special film and definitely one of the greatest of the past decade, but I think at the very least Before Midnight was better. There are many moments of Boyhood that, if not for the filming structure, would have been cut to make a better, tighter film. I don't know if I can necessarily hold that against the film judging by how ambitious it was, but once the initial \"wow\" factor washes over you, cracks start to show.\n\nThe EWS comment was in jest, but it does remain my favorite film of this year\n\nI've seen 40 on this list. I really need to step up my foreign film game. Yi Yi and In the Mood For Love are films that I consistently see pop up yet never get a chance to watch. Then again, I have an increasingly overwhelming collection of Criterion Blu Rays sitting in my room waiting to be watched. One day, Seven Samurai. One day\n\nOf the films I've seen:\n\n-Eternal Sunshine is not a film that I would see anywhere near this type of list, perhaps I'll have to watch it again\n\n-No Country is a good film, one I need to revisit, but one that I don't think necessarily deserves all of the praise that it gets. TWBB, endlessly compared even if the films are very different, is much better. Inside Llewyn Davis, on the other hand, is phenomenal and potentially the Bros best film.\n\n-The Act of Killing and Holy Motors are masterpieces, deserve all the praise that they get.\n\n-The Master is one of my favorite films of all time\n\n-The Grand Budapest was charming, idk about top 20 of the past decade though\n\n-City of God gets hate by most critics that I respect but I still love the film, one of the first foreign language films that I really loved\n\n-Inception was pretty to look at, but other than that?\n\n-Zero Dark Thirty and the Hurt Locker were not very good. The Hurt Locker at least had the supermarket scene\n\n-Before Sunset, Inherent Vice and of course Spring Breakers are all wonderful films. Should be higher. I joke about Spring Breakers a lot, but it truly is one of my favorite films\n\n-Her is a film that I think about a lot, I need to see it again. Anomalisa is another one"
