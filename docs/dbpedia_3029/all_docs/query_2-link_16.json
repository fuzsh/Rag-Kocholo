In the first verse, Chappell sings: You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth. She then adds: I don't wanna call it off\n\nBut you don't wanna call it love / You only wanna be the one that I call baby.\n\nIn the chorus, Chappell wishes the girl good luck with denying her true feelings. She laments: You can kiss a hundred boys in bars / Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling / You can say it's just the way you are / Make a new excuse, another stupid reason / Good luck, babe.\n\nExplaining the meaning behind 'Good Luck, Babe!' with Rolling Stone, Chappell said that it's \"about wishing good luck to someone who is denying fate\". She then continued: \"I was just wanting to write a big anthemic pop song.\"\n\nDiscussing the writing process, she said: \"I knew exactly what I wanted. I wrote it in three minutes. I felt so much anger. I was so upset. It all came out and I didn’t add anything when I wrote it all, done. It was a perfect storm.\"\n\nYou can hear Chappell's anger and heartbreak in the iconic bridge. She belts: When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night / With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife / And when you think about me, all of those years ago / You're standing face to face with 'I told you so'.\n\nElsewhere, Chappell told Rolling Stone that she was hoping to film a music video for the song in June so it's possible that we'll get a video any day now.\n\nBRB, screaming 'I told you sooooooooooooooo!' at the top of my lungs until further notice.\n\nChappell Roan - 'Good Luck, Babe!' lyrics\n\nVERSE 1\n\nIt's fine, it's cool\n\nYou can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth\n\nAnd guess I'm the fool\n\nWith her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof\n\nPRE-CHORUS\n\nI don't wanna call it off\n\nBut you don't wanna call it love\n\nYou only wanna be the one that I call baby\n\nCHORUS\n\nYou can kiss a hundred boys in bars\n\nShoot another shot, try to stop the feeling\n\nYou can say it's just the way you are\n\nMake a new excuse, another stupid reason\n\nGood luck, babe (Well, good luck)\n\nWell, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)\n\nYou'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling\n\nGood luck, babe (Well, good luck)\n\nWell, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)\n\nYou'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling\n\nVERSE 2\n\nI'm cliché, who cares?\n\nIt's a sexually explicit kind of love affair\n\nAnd I cry, it's not fair\n\nI just need a little lovin', I just need a little air\n\nPRE-CHORUS\n\nThink I'm gonna call it off\n\nEven if you call it love\n\nI just wanna love someone who calls me baby\n\nCHORUS\n\nYou can kiss a hundred boys in bars\n\nShoot another shot, try to stop the feeling\n\nYou can say it's just the way you are\n\nMake a new excuse, another stupid reason\n\nGood luck, babe (Well, good luck)\n\nWell, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)\n\nYou'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling\n\nGood luck, babe (Well, good luck)\n\nWell, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)\n\nYou'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling\n\nBRIDGE\n\nWhen you wake up next to him in the middle of the night\n\nWith your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife\n\nAnd when you think about me, all of those years ago\n\nYou're standing face to face with \"I told you so\"\n\nYou know I hate to say it, I told you so\n\nYou know I hate to say, but I told you so\n\nCHORUS\n\nYou can kiss a hundred boys in bars\n\nShoot another shot, try to stop the feeling (Well, I told you so)\n\nYou can say it's just the way you are\n\nMake a new excuse, another stupid reason\n\nGood luck, babe (Well, good luck)\n\nWell, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)\n\nYou'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling\n\nGood luck, babe (Well, good luck)\n\nWell, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)\n\nYou'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling\n\nOUTRO\n\nYou'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling\n\nYou'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling\n\nYou'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling\n\nRead more from Capital Buzz here:\n\nSabrina Carpenter Explains The Meaning Behind Her 'Please Please Please' Lyrics\n\nChappell Roan Explains Heartbreaking Meaning Behind 'Good Luck, Babe!'
