        "text": "“This film is an important document of time and should be screened widely. What makes Lyd stand out from other documentaries on this topic is the way the filmmakers audaciously weave together different forms of storytelling.” —International Federation of Film Critics\n\n“Ambitiously tackling perhaps the most controversial geopolitical issue in the world, and doing so in under 80 minutes, the filmmakers offer a provocative cri de coeur for a free Palestine. A difficult and unflinching film, but also as hopeful as one could be in the current climate.” –POV Magazine\n\n“A stunning movie that changes how we understand the past and gives us a way to imagine a radically different future… a must-see film.” –Amahl Bishara, Associate Professor, Anthropology, Tufts University\n\n“A cinematic achievement that breaks down the wide divide between documentary and science fiction.” —The National\n\n“It is the perfect time for a film like Lyd, a work that draws a clear line between the sins of the past and our present reality and vociferously argues why contextualizing the present within that broader history is crucial in determining the future.” —Disappointment Media\n\n“The story of Lyd is the story of Palestine. The film that bears its name confronts the horrors of what is, without losing sight of what could be—a vital exercise in political imagination.” —Arielle Angel, Editor-in-chief of Jewish Currents\n\n“An eye-opening documentary that every thinking person with a respect for all humanity must see.”—It's Just Movies\n\n“Never loses sight of these slippery questions about what is, and what could be, achieved through the power of our collective imagination.” —In Review Online\n\n“Lyd is a haunting and unusual documentary, comprising various styles to tell the story of the once beautiful ancient city of Lyd and its gradual devastation under Israeli settlement.” —City Hub (Australia)\n\n“It is a harrowing watch, but a vital one if the goal is gaining greater understanding the history of Israel-Palestine conflict.” —ScreenHub (Australia)\n\n“LYD is a poignant, compellingly speculative film: part documentary, part visionary fiction, it is the memoir of a city ruptured by occupation, time skipping between possible futures and pasts. LYD offers a deep political education through eyewitness accounts, and personal stories, and an unwavering look into the heart of empire and the ongoing project of settler colonization. A must-see!” —Autumn Brown, Co-Host, How to Survive the End of the World"
