We were really lucky in that nobody else had used it, because it's got such a particular look.\"[3] The scenes where Emily is swimming were also filmed in Loch Long.[3] Kaya's (Mirren Mack) flat is situated in Gorbals, while the fictional \"Calderwood Falls\" waterfall is located at the Devil's Pulpit. The Devil's Pulpit has previously been used as a setting for Starz period drama Outlander.[3]\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nNo.TitleDirected byWritten byOriginal air date [4]U.K. viewers\n\n(millions) [5]1\"Episode 1\"Andy De EmmonyNicole Taylor22 March 2020 ( )8.82\n\nOn parole teenager Kaya steps out in front of Emily's car, damaging her knee.

She asks Kaya to take a DNA test, and the results reveal that the baby is related to neither Kaya nor Emily and Dan, and that the embryo was swapped. Kaya agrees that Emily and Dan can adopt the baby, but while they prepare the baby's room, Kaya's mother, Siobhan, persuades her to keep the baby. James is arrested for passing information from his social work to organised criminals.\n\n5\"Episode 5\"Simen AlsvikNicole Taylor13 April 2020 ( )7.94\n\nSiobhan invites a journalist to write an exposé on Dan's business, where it is revealed that he made money for the business by selling drugs. The resulting media coverage also highlights the surrogacy, and due to the ongoing media attention towards both Kaya and Emily and Dan, the baby's fate is undecided. Kaya forces her mother to leave after an argument, where it transpires that 11-year-old Kaya accidentally stabbed her pregnant aunt while breaking up a fight between her and Siobhan. When holding the baby, Kaya realises that she wants more for her life than to be a mother, and six months later, Emily and Dan are given care of the baby.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
