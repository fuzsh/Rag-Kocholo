        "text": "Post by HELENA MARIA on\n\nThe psychological thriller from the 'Martha Marcy May Marlene' director is for FilmNation and BBC Films.\n\nJude Law and Carrie Coon are set to star in director Sean Durkin's The Nest, a family psychodrama for FilmNation Entertainment and BBC Films, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.\n\nDurkin's first film since 2011's critically acclaimed drama Martha Marcy May Marlene will feature Law as a businessman who brings his American wife and kids home to Britain to pursue new business opportunities, only to be plunged into despair as their unaffordable new life in an English manor threatens to destroy the family.\n\nAs the eerie isolation of the house divides the family, each member descends into a self-destructive cycle, leaving everyone unsure if the clan will survive.\n\nThe Nest is set to be shot in September in Canada and Britain. Durkin also wrote the screenplay.\n\nEd Guiney and Andrew Lowe are producing for Element Pictures, with FilmNation and BBC Films as co-producers. FilmNation is handling international sales and will introduce the project at Cannes.\n\nUTA is pursuing a U.S. distribution deal. Jude Law is repped by WME and Julian Belfrage Associates. Coon is repped by UTA and Foundation Talent Management.\n\nwww.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jude-law-carrie-coon-star-sean-durkins-nest-1106272\n\nYes ! More roles for Coon . She's so freaking talented\n\nPost by notacrook on\n\nI like the sound of this, but am I the only one who doesn't really care for Carrie Coon.\n\nSeriously though, have you seen her in The Leftovers? Acting at its finest.\n\nPost by Johnny_Hellzapoppin on\n\nI like the sound of this, but am I the only one who doesn't really care for Carrie Coon.\n\nSeriously though, have you seen her in The Leftovers?

I liked her in it quite a lot, but they really didn't use her all that well. Carrie Coon at the height of her powers is a thing to behold.\n\nPost by Johnny_Hellzapoppin on\n\nI haven't gotten to The Leftovers yet, but it is on my list of definitely will watch as some point TV shows.\n\nAre you going off of Fargo then, perhaps?

This might be the one to turn me around on her, as I do like the sound of it.\n\nPost by Viced on\n\nI like the sound of this, but am I the only one who doesn't really care for Carrie Coon.\n\nJohnny, we've talked about this before... please stop smoking crack.\n\nPost by Tommen_Saperstein on\n\nnew trailer from IFC. Movie releases this Friday.\n\n(look at that adorable grumpy face!)\n\nCurious how this will turn out because based on the marketing there are a few different paths it might take--something more basic like Revolutionary Road-style suburban squabbling, something psych horror or thriller-based (when Law says \"there's nothing with this house\", PLUS the IMDb premise mentions things taking a \"twisted turn\" and the wikipedia premise highlights tension caused by the isolation of their new environment), or something akin to Gone Girl (dear god please not that). Haven't read any of the reviews so I have no idea.\n\nwe excited? Durkin's return to the screen is nearly a decade in waiting.\n\nPost by Mattsby on\n\nThis might've been a gothic Shoot the Moon but it's more like The Boost ('88) unfortunately - this 80s set dark family drama of fronts and grief and little lies and big metaphors suffers from having such a halfway-there script that just repeats itself and becomes less interesting. Sean Durkin can direct though - the careful first act has a lot of visual story-suggestion and mood to it, the filmic visuals look great, and the perfs especially Jude Law are quite good. 6/10 or so."
