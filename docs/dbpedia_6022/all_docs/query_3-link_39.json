        "text": "The BBC revealed its biggest new drama launch of 2020 so far is The Nest, a five-part drama starring Line of Duty's Martin Compston and Peaky Blinders star Sophie Rundle , which boasted an impressive average of 9 million viewers.\n\nThe pacy and thrilling five-part show was written by BAFTA-winning Nicole Taylor, and clearly viewers were impressed. If you haven't yet watched it, here's what you need to know...\n\nSophie Rundle\n\nThe Nest: What's it about?\n\n\"Dan (Compston) and Emily (Rundle) are crazy about each other. They live in a huge house in a beautiful location just outside Glasgow and want for nothing.

When Kaya agrees to carry their baby, it feels like they were meant to meet, but was it really by chance?\"\n\nThe series explores who Kaya is and what brought her to the couple.\n\nMirren Mack\n\n\"The Nest is an emotional thriller about love and money, and the price of being able to buy whatever you want.\"\n\nMartin said of the project when it was announced: “I’m absolutely delighted to join the cast of The Nest. Nicole Taylor is one of the most exciting and original voices in writing today, I’m chuffed we’re finally working together. Combined with filming in Glasgow and going back onto BBC One in my native west coast accent makes it a dream scenario.\"\n\nMartin Compston\n\nThe Nest: Who's in it?\n\nAs well as Compston, Rundle and Mack, the series - produced by Studio Lambert - stars Shirley Henderson (Stan and Ollie, Happy Valley), Katie Leung (Strangers, Chimerica), David Hayman (Hatton Garden, Fisherman’s Friends), Fiona Bell (Shetland, Acceptable Risk), James Harkness (The Victim, Wild Rose), Bailey Patrick (London Kills, Good Omens), Kate Dickie (Game of Thrones, The Witch), Paul Brannigan (The Angels’ Share, Under The Skin) and Samuel Small (So Awkward, Game of Thrones).\n\nThe Nest: When's it on TV?\n\nThe Nest aired in March and April on BBC One. You can catch up on BBC iPlayer HERE.\n\nThe Nest: Is there a trailer?\n\nYep, here it is...\n\nLike this article?
