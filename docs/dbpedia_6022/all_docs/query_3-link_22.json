        "text": "The five-part thriller is not based on a true story but it does deal with some real life issues.\n\nSurrogacy and IVF are two topics we are all familiar with and they can be very emotional subjects for those who have been through it.\n\nThe fact Emily and Dan cannot have children through natural means is not an unusual thing, and families across the country will be able to empathise with them.\n\nSurrogacy is an arrangement whereby a woman agrees to carry a child for someone else, who will then become their parent after birth.\n\nIn the series Kaya offers to be a surrogate for Emily, but her offer comes at a hefty price.\n\nREAD MORE: The Nest on BBC location: Where is The Nest filmed? Where's it set?\n\nSusan Hogg, Head of Drama for Studio Lambert, said ahead of filming: “Having worked with Nicole very closely on The C Word and Three Girls I knew her characters would be extraordinary on the page.\n\n\"And now I’m absolutely thrilled to have the most amazing actors to bring them to life. Led by Martin and Sophie our cast is simply perfect and we can’t wait to start filming in the vibrant and beautiful city of Glasgow.”\n\nFilming for the new series took place in September 2019 and Nicole Taylor said: \"I am overjoyed to be filming in my hometown of Glasgow with a cast I have long dreamt of writing for.\n\n\"Martin, Sophie, Kate, Shirley, James, David… they’ve all been chatting away in my head for years as I’ve been writing (unbeknownst to them) so I could not be more proud that they have agreed to join The Nest and make these characters real.”\n\nThe Nest airs on BBC One at 9pm on March 22"
