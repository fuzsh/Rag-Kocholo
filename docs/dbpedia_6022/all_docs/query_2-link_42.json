        "text": "They're really not silent at all — fans of silent films will tell you that for sure.\n\nThe actors' mouths move, but no words are heard. Title cards tell their stories as music threads through their antics, building to dramatic or comedic climaxes.\n\nThere are many film buffs in the Hudson Valley and a select group that prefers these \"pre-talkies\" over those with dialogue.\n\nMeet some fans who fit the bill:\n\nThe Buster Keaton fan\n\nBlake Gingerich thought he wanted a career as an engineer, but while he was a student at Purdue University in the early 2000s, a class on silent films changed all that.\n\n“I was so happy to be in a movie class compared to another calculus class,” said the 36-year-old Saugerties resident. “I was casually aware of Charlie Chaplin at that point, but in this class we watched a lot of silent movies and I loved them all.”\n\nNow a movie editor, working on films such as the sci-fi thriller \"Voyagers,\" due out next year, and on the Showtime series \"Billions,\" Gingerich said he appreciates the art of silent films.\n\n“Dialogue is my least favorite part of movies,” he said. “In silent films, the dialogue is removed, so you have to get good at visual storytelling and use music in a much more powerful way. Watch a movie like 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' from 1928. It’s fantastic and it lends itself to all the things that editing is.”\n\n\"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" is a silent French historical film based on the actual record of the trial of Joan of Arc, directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer.\n\nGingerich owns about 20 silent films and 10 film posters. He appreciates all silent film actors, but is a Buster Keaton fan. He understands that others might not be as excited about silent films as he is.\n\n\"It’s a big hurdle to get into them,” he said. “They look old, look like they are running at the wrong speed and the makeup is all weird, and that makes it feel like homework, but they will become fans if they give it a shot.”\n\nHe said that it’s actually easier to watch many silent films today because of the internet.\n\n“You can probably find most of the Keaton catalog on YouTube,” he said.\n\nThe Chaplin collector\n\nJean Haines doesn’t remember her first viewing of a Chaplin film, but said she gradually became a Chaplin fan during high school in the early 1980s, collecting a few pictures, articles, books and films on VHS.\n\n“By 2010, I realized I had collected enough for an exhibit, so in April (Chaplin's birth month) 2011, I had the first public showing of the collection at my small studio gallery on North Front Street in uptown Kingston,” said Haines, who also lives in Kingston.\n\nIt became an annual April exhibit as the collection grew and more Chaplin items were either gifted or loaned to her.\n\n“Always popular are the opening reception, Chaplin birthday costume party, films, trivia and closing party,” she said.\n\nIn early 2016, she moved and did not have a Chaplin show for two years due to lack of a large enough location. In 2018, the annual show was revived at the Kingston Artist Collective in the downtown Rondout area where, she said, Chaplin films were shown every Saturday that month. This past April, the collection was shown at Blue-Byrd's Haberdashery & Music on Wall Street, back uptown, and close to where the show originated on North Front Street.\n\n“Presenting this Chaplin collection is fun for everyone, but a tremendous amount of work for me,” Haines said. “My hope for the future is to find a permanent display location for it, a Chaplin mini-museum, if you will. It's always sad to see something that made everyone so happy get put back in storage for 11 months.”\n\nHappiness is the main reason she loves Chaplin so much.\n\n“He makes everyone happy and, by extension, I enjoy sharing my collection to bring laughter to more people,” she said. “I also appreciate the skill, artistry and emotional clarity Chaplin has in telling a story without words.”\n\nFilm a family affair\n\nScott Anderson’s grandfather, Robert Lovelace Barrett, was an actor who had an uncredited appearance in the 1928 Buster Keaton film, \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\"\n\nWanting to learn more about the man who passed away before he was born, Anderson started researching his grandfather and discovered he was a movie projectionist in the 1930s and 1940s, when some of the classics, such as \"Casablanca\" and \"The Maltese Falcon,\" were shown. The research on his grandfather and the early silent films and talkies led him to write, under the pen name of Evan Anderson, \"Downriver: A Tale of Moving Pictures Before Hollywood,\" a novel set during the early days of cinema.\n\n“I’ve always loved silent films, and because it’s a visual medium, you bring your imagination more,” said Anderson, a resident of Accord who said Buster Keaton is his favorite silent film actor. “My favorite year is 1928 when the silent film industry was at the pinnacle of photography, action and direction. People who watch silent films usually come in looking for the slapstick and discover there were dramas, too.”\n\n'The Tramp' book author\n\nGary Golio remembers watching silent films with his grandmother when he was a little boy.\n\n“She was especially interested in watching movies with African-American actors as well as Charlie Chaplin,” said the 66-year-old Briarcliff Manor resident and author of the children’s book, \"Smile: How Young Charlie Chaplin Taught the World to Laugh (and Cry).\" “Watching Chaplin led to my love of comic books as a kid because it was the idea of putting words and pictures together.”\n\nGolio said that nobody spanned the emotional range in those days the way Chaplin did.\n\n“Funny and sad went hand-in-hand,” he said. “You watch 'The Kid' and it cracks you up — it’s conceptual humor and slapstick, of course, and yet you care about this child and this man as a single parent. You can’t watch 'The Kid' without laughing and crying.”\n\nDon’t tell him that silent films are a dying art though.\n\n“Film is more vibrant as a medium than ever,” he said. “It may not look the same and they may not call it silent film, but it’s still around.”\n\nThe 2011 five-time Oscar-winning film \"The Artist\" pays tribute to the silent films of the 1920s. It is the first primarily silent feature to win the Best Picture Oscar since 1929, when \"Wings,\" directed by William A. Wellman, clinched the award.\n\nGolio decided to write about Chaplin, aka The Tramp, after reading his autobiography and rewatching his films.\n\n“His father left the family and his mother had emotional trouble, and yet this kid managed to be resilient enough to endure and enjoy the theater ... by the time he was 24, he was the most famous person in the world,” Golio said. “Everyone knew The Tramp, but walking down the street without his costume on, nobody knew who Chaplin was.”\n\n'Sunday Silents'\n\nYou can still watch silent films in the Hudson Valley, especially at the Rosendale Theatre. The new season of \"Sunday Silents\" begins in November and you can thank Rosendale Theatre Collective Producer Georgette Mattel for that.\n\nWhen she was a volunteer at the theater, Mattel, a Rosendale resident, suggested the idea when they were looking for more public programs.\n\nMattel’s love of silent films started when she was a little girl.\n\n“My mother was a film nut, so we were always watching movies,” Mattel said. “In 1972, Charlie Chaplin was presented with an honorary Oscar and a local PBS station ran his films, so that got me into them.”\n\nAs a Keaton fan and member of the International Buster Keaton Society, Mattel has traveled to Michigan for the annual Buster Keaton convention, now in its 25th year.\n\n“There are some people who are camp Keaton and some love Chaplin — he was brilliant — but it’s just about what appeals to you,” she said. “Silent films are an important part of our heritage and unless people are caring about them, one day you’re not going to have any more films like Buster Keaton’s 'The General.' ”\n\nContact freelance writer Lisa Iannucci at features@poughkeepsiejournal.com\n\n'Sunday Silents' at Rosendale Theatre\n\nNov. 3: F.W.
