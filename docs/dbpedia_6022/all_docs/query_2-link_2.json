        "text": "Music by Christian Elliott on the Mighty Wurlitzer.\n\nBuster Keaton directs and stars in SHERLOCK JR. (1924) and the short film THE LOVE NEST (1923) also written by Keaton. Sherlock Jr. finds Keaton as a daydreaming film projectionist who longs to be a detective and put his crime solving skills to use. Sherlock Jr. is perhaps one of Keaton's most cherished works and was placed on the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1991. The Love Nest was Keaton's 19th and final short film before transitioning exclusively to feature length productions and tells the tale of a heartbroken man lost at sea in a small boat who climbs aboard a whaling ship only to discover a merciless captain at the helm.\n\nAbout The Guest\n\nJennifer M. Bean is Robert Jolin Osborne Professor of Cinema and Media Studies at the University of Washington. She has published widely in silent-era cinema, including the award-winning collections A Feminist Reader in Early Cinema (2002) and Silent Cinema and the Politics of Space (2014), as well as Flickers of Desire: Movie Stars of the 1910s (2011). Her commitment to silent-era film preservation has led to her work on advisory boards for the National Film Preservation Association, the BFI, Turner Classic Movies, Women and Film History International, and Thanhouser Film Preservation, Inc., among others. She is currently Editor-in-Chief of Feminist Media Histories: An International Journal and a 2023-2024 fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nAbout The Musician\n\nChristian Elliott is one of today’s premier theatre organists who specializes in presenting historically authentic silent film accompaniment. The protégé of legendary silent film organist Gaylord Carter, he was fortunate to have had the tradition of silent film accompaniment passed down to him from one of the finest film accompaniments of the silent film era. We’re honored that Christian has been accompanying films here at the Seattle Paramount since 2015. He has done extensive silent film accompaniment, including at the Packard Foundation’s Stanford Theatre (Palo Alto, California), UCLA, the Cinequest and San Francisco Silent Film Festivals, San Luis Obispo International Film Festival, as well as the San Diego Symphony, Los Angeles Conservancy, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. A frequent performer at the American Theatre Organ Society’s national conventions, as a solo artist he has recordings available on iTunes, continues to perform solo organ engagements and silent film presentations all across the United States, and was named “Organist of the Year” by the American Theatre Organ Society in 2009."
