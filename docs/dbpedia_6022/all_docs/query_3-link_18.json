        "text": "Book Summary\n\nA warm, funny and acutely perceptive debut novel about four adult siblings and the fate of the shared inheritance that has shaped their choices and their lives.\n\nEvery family has its problems. But even among the most troubled, the Plumb family stands out as spectacularly dysfunctional. Years of simmering tensions finally reach a breaking point on an unseasonably cold afternoon in New York City as Melody, Beatrice, and Jack Plumb gather to confront their charismatic and reckless older brother, Leo, freshly released from rehab. Months earlier, an inebriated Leo got behind the wheel of a car with a nineteen-year-old waitress as his passenger. The ensuing accident has endangered the Plumbs' joint trust fund, \"The Nest,\" which they are months away from finally receiving. Meant by their deceased father to be a modest mid-life supplement, the Plumb siblings have watched The Nest's value soar along with the stock market and have been counting on the money to solve a number of self-inflicted problems.\n\nMelody, a wife and mother in an upscale suburb, has an unwieldy mortgage and looming college tuition for her twin teenage daughters. Jack, an antiques dealer, has secretly borrowed against the beach cottage he shares with his husband, Walker, to keep his store open. And Bea, a once-promising short-story writer, just can't seem to finish her overdue novel. Can Leo rescue his siblings and, by extension, the people they love? Or will everyone need to reimagine the futures they've envisioned? Brought together as never before, Leo, Melody, Jack, and Beatrice must grapple with old resentments, present-day truths, and the significant emotional and financial toll of the accident, as well as finally acknowledge the choices they have made in their own lives.\n\nThis is a story about the power of family, the possibilities of friendship, the ways we depend upon one another and the ways we let one another down. In this tender, entertaining, and deftly written debut, Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney brings a remarkable cast of characters to life to illuminate what money does to relationships, what happens to our ambitions over the course of time, and the fraught yet unbreakable ties we share with those we love.\n\nPublished in hardcover & ebook in March 2016. Paperback publishing April 2017\n\nReading Guide\n\nYou can see the full discussion here. This discussion will contain spoilers!\n\nSome of the recent comments posted about The Nest:\n\nDid you find that there were secrets that should have been revealed earlier in the story or were kept for selfless or selfish reasons? Have you ever kept any important secrets?\n\nMaybe the secret keeping is the reason why I didn't love this book. I tend to stay away from books with secrets or I end up not liking them. I think it's because my whole life has been a family secret. I believe that my parents will take their ... - booksnob\n\nDid you find yourself leaning toward the pleas or the argument of one sibling in particular, and if so, who, and why?\n\nI found the characters interesting but can't say I liked one over the others. But if I had to choose, I would say Bea. She was the one willing to give up her share to help out her brother and sister who took actions based on their belief they would ... - scottishrose\n\nDo you feel that the bond of family trumps all? Is it possible to rebuild trust once it has been broken? Are there some bonds that can become stronger than those of family?\n\nObviously not in regard to Leo. For the other three siblings they do grow over time and learn to have real relationships with each other in the end when the money is no longer standing between them. Stephanie and her daughter seem to take the place ... - scottishrose\n\nDo you have a physical remembrance of someone who was close to you? What is it, and why did you keep it?\n\nI have my father's WWII Honor Bus hat, which was given to the veterans when they were taken to D.C. via bus for a military of event. It was important to him, so it's important to me. I felt he was honoring me, singling me out, as I have 4 siblings ... - Cynthia\n\nDo you think Leo ever loved Stephanie? How do you think he would have reacted if he'd found out about their child together?\n\nI think Leo was too self-centered to be capable of real love for Stephanie. He would go through the motions until things got a little difficult, then he would do what he always did, run from responsibility. If she had told him about the child, I ... - scottishrose\n\nMedia Reviews\n\n\"Starred Review. [A] generous, absorbing novel...Sweeney's endearing characters are quirky New Yorkers all...
