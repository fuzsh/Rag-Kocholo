        "text": "A ghost story without ghosts and a marriage story without a divorce, Sean Durkin's latest fractured-family drama, The Nest, is a tense psychological thriller driven by powerhouse performances from Carrie Coon, Jude Law and some very creepy slow zooms.\n\nThe long-awaited follow-up to Durkin's acclaimed debut Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011), about a girl taken in by a cult, The Nest sees the American writer-director circling similarly haunted terrain: displacement, deception and a family in disarray.\n\nIn the opening shot, the camera hovers like a peeping Tom on the exterior of a leafy upstate New York house, accompanied by twitchy piano. Despite signs of material comfort, like the flashy BMW in the driveway, it's clear something is rotten in the O'Hara home.\n\nIt's 1986 — Margaret Thatcher's deregulation of British financial markets is in full swing — and Rory O'Hara (Law), a commodities trader who spouts Reagan-era rhetoric, is hungry to get in on the action. Which is a little strange, because he appears to already have it all.\n\nBut there's an \"opportunity\" at his old firm in London, he tells his American wife Allison (Coon, The Leftovers) while lovingly bringing her morning coffee, as per their routine. Soon she and the kids — weedy 10-year-old Ben (Charlie Shotwell) and the neglected teenager Samantha (Oona Roche) — find themselves shipped off to posh Surrey, where Rory has leased a ridiculous 15-century manor.\n\n\"What's the rent?\" asks Allison suspiciously, as he tours them through the massive estate: rooms upon rooms of wood-panelled walls, hanging tapestries and heavy, Elizabethan-style furniture, captured in wide shots that accentuate the cavernous gloom.\n\nLaw's playboy looks and swagger slide easily into cursed stories of success. Here, he plays Rory as a man pinballing between the well-heeled VIP he yearns to be, someone like Law's Dickie Greenleaf in The Talented Mr. Ripley, and reality, which lands closer to his smooth-talking Gigolo Joe from A.I. Artificial Intelligence, running for his life.\n\nHe bounds through the house like an over-excited Labrador — \"Led Zeppelin stayed here when they were recording an album!\" — drowning out Allison's concerns with splashy gifts, including a chinchilla coat and the promise of her very own stables to train her horses.\n\nFrom the start, there's the eerie sense of being watched, with cinematographer Matyas Erdely (Son of Saul; Sunset) framing characters through car windscreens and glass office cubicles, observing them coolly from a distance.\n\nThe family's move to England results in some culture shock (drawn partly from Durkin's own memories of jumping continents at age 11). But as they scramble for footing in this strange new place, something more sinister is afoot.\n\nA feeling of dread steadily pervades the film — baked into the elegant, ominous score from Arcade Fire's Richard Reed Parry; the sickly rich colour palette; and the stomach-churning sound design, which homes in on details like the buzzing of insects and a horse screaming in the night.\n\nThe moody period piece could be seen as an addendum to Alan J. Pakula's 70s \"paranoia trilogy\" (Klute, The Parallax View and All the President's Men), in which ordinary folk uncover conspiracies run by governments and powerful organisations.\n\nExcept Durkin's thriller flips the script, as the unwelcome truths come from inside the family home and ripple out to devastating effect.\n\nRiffing off classic horror tropes, the manor transforms into a claustrophobic prison, freakishly mirroring the family's increasing anxiety and mistrust.\n\nThe exact source of the threat remains teasingly ambiguous — are they experiencing supernatural phenomena, or something closer to mental collapse? — as doors mysteriously swing open, the kids are afraid to cross the hall at night, and several shots show the house dwarfing the characters as if it wants to swallow them alive, as in Nobuhiko Obayashi's 1977 hallucinogenic horror film, House.\n\n\"This poisonous f***king house,\" spits Allison in one of the couple's screaming matches — scenes that reach for a heightened theatricality.\n\nAll the while, the kids watch on.\n\nPerched on stairwells, eavesdropping on their parents' arguments, the children observe and increasingly act out. Ben frets and Samantha rolls her eyes, retreating into her bedroom and a period synth-pop soundtrack (New Order, The Thompson Twins) that offers brief, giddy escape.\n\nAt first glance, The Nest might appear bound to Rory: a compulsive gambler in the mould of Jeanne Moreau's Jackie in Bay of Angels, or more recently, Adam Sandler's Howard Ratner in Uncut Gems, living from one bet to the next.\n\nBut as Rory's dreams slip from his grasp, so too does the film. Instead, increasing space is given over to Allison — who has a certain way of aggressively huffing cigarettes that evokes a time before all this luxury — as she desperately stakes out her independence from his web of lies.\n\nShe continually butts up against the limits society has defined for her as the 'supportive wife', radiating silent fury when she's introduced at a party as \"Mrs. Rory O'Hara\".\n\n\"My name is Allison, that might have been confusing,\" she says as she extends a hand — one of many throwaway lines that Coon imbues with a rebellious, unpredictable energy all her own. She gives a magnetic performance (in her first notable film role since playing Ben Affleck's sister in Gone Girl, followed by years of theatre and prestige TV).\n\nJust as the film embraces Allison's duality — moving seamlessly between scenes of her rubbing shoulders at ritzy parties to throwing hay bales on the farm — it complicates any simplistic notion of Rory's greed, paying attention to personal history and circumstance, as compassion demands.\n\nThe result is a film obsessed with sham appearances — including the fantasies people chase and those they artfully create.\n\nWhen the dream seems well and truly shattered, Durkin goes so far as to nod to Hitchcock's Vertigo — recreating the famous neck shot of Madeleine's chignon, on Allison — pulling us further into this tale of lost souls spiralling out of control."
