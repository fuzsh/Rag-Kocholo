        "text": "While I was quite excited to watch The Nest, I must admit that upon reflection I’m more confused as to the point than anything else. The Nest tells the story of Rory (played by Jude Law) and Allison (portrayed by Carrie Coon), a married couple whose relationship begins to unravel after they move from upstate New York to an old, drafty estate in England. Their once stable marriage is tested by Rory’s ambitious pursuit of wealth and status, which leads him to make reckless decisions that threaten their union.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of The Nest is the depth of emotion conveyed by its cast. Both Law and Coon deliver powerful, nuanced performances that breathe life into their characters. While Law masterfully portrays the arrogance and selfishness of Rory, Coon shines as Allison, a woman struggling to maintain her identity amidst the chaos of her husband’s obsession. The film’s pacing is deliberate and intense, allowing the audience to fully absorb the weight of each moment.\n\nAlthough all of this is let down by the writing of the actual story, which is plodding. While there are certainly some incredibly intense sequences, most end up really proving nothing in the end. The end, which is actually quite sudden, leaves the audience feeling quite unfulfilled, as if they either missed something during the movie or perhaps the filmmakers forgot a scene. While the final sequence was captivating, it would have been better placed as a second to last scene rather than the final one, as the emotions conveyed are extremely good, but the story just ends abruptly. In a movie where everything is building to something. It actually has to build to something.\n\nThe last 30 minutes of this movie are not only confusing but also seem like they should have been leading to something that never happens. The plot here might have been, how is Rory going to pretend to be rich and pull it off? But we all know he’s not going to, from the midpoint of the movie. But if the point is that he realizes this, it’s a rather boring and uninteresting story. The other questions that arise in the movie are never really answered and all of the flirting this movie does with greater more interesting things happening. Never happen… There are so many possible endings for this movie and the writer and director just decided to not only take the most boring one but one that doesn’t really explain any of the other plot threads they had been working on and building on the entire movie.\n\nThe movie also, has this idea of bringing in subplots for the kids at different points throughout the movie. Mostly, it seems, to show how ineffective the parents are becoming. But by the end when both kids have a great scene, which are the last two scenes of the movie. Nothing is really resolved and there is a strange new emotional dynamic in the family that wasn’t really present before this. I was a bit confused about this new hierarchy and there was no real plot foundation for this strange payoff. This seems like a 2- and 30-minute movie in the shell of a 1 hr. and 47 minute one. This can be seen in many places in the film and it’s also why it's clear that there are so many possible conclusions to this story. Almost all of them far better than the one the writer and director chose.\n\nI could certainly go into each plot and possible ending if they all reached their natural conclusions and while that would make for quite a spoiler filled review. I will instead say that this movie is a pass. Even if you love the actors involved or perhaps the plot itself tickles your curiosity. The movie is not a bad movie in the traditional sense. The acting is good, it’s shot well, and the pacing is very good. But with an ending as bad as this. It is difficult to give it points for doing all those other things when in the end there is nothing to the movie that couldn’t have been said in a half hour rather than an hour and a half or more. The Nest looks like one of those thrillers that has you on the edge of your seat the entire film. The problem is that when there is nothing there at the end and you fall on the floor; wondering what just happened. I guess in an age where most people are on their phone for the majority of movies anyway. Most people are used to missing something. The problem is that when you Google, the end of the film. You don’t find out anything other than what you would have if you watched it. Nothing…"
