        "text": "Duck Soup\n\nTwo vagrants find shelter in a temporarily empty mansion but have to masquerade as its owner and his maid when a wealthy couple call to rent the place.\n\nThe Second 100 Years\n\nTwo convicts escape from prison but are trapped into masquerading as a couple of French prison officials at a dinner party given by the Governor.\n\nPutting Pants on Phillip\n\nA prominent businessman is embarrassed when his Scottish nephew‚Äôs kilted attire, and his girl-chasing antics, bemuse everyone in town.\n\nThe Battle of the Century**\n\nAfter a terrible boxer loses a bout, his manager takes out an insurance policy on him and tries to cause an accident, which results in an epic pie fight.\n\n**Check out this 2020 blog post from the Library of Congress about the rediscovery of the missing reel from the Laurel & Hardy two-reeler Battle of the Century, which featured a reportedly legendary pie fight!\n\nüéûÔ∏è Chaplin shorts (1917) ‚Äî 11:30 AM, 3:30 PM\n\n\"The Doll embraces artificiality and self-awareness from the opening credits. Lubitsch himself opens the film, pulling pieces from a small chest to build a diorama in front of us, complete with a pair of dolls that he places inside a toy cottage. It is one of the greatest metaphors for moviemaking ever put on the screen. The film cuts to the now full-size set to observe his actor-dolls coming to life in the fantasy setting. The theme continues with cardboard clouds parting to reveal a smiling sun, pots and pans cartoonishly drawn on the walls of a kitchen, and a carriage drawn by actors in horse costumes. This is indeed a toybox of a movie.\" ‚Äî Sean Axmaker, TCM\n\nüéûÔ∏è Within Our Gates (1920) ‚Äî 2:15 PM, 6:15 PM\n\nWhile the majority of the other films we‚Äôre playing for Silent Movie Day are comedic, this one‚Äôs a pretty hard-hitting drama. A few years back, we screened this one in our virtual cinema for its 100th anniversary. And we felt it‚Äôs worth bringing back again.\n\nLearn more about this film‚Äôs significance here: Why I‚Äôll Watch Oscar Micheaux‚Äôs Within Our Gates until I Wear It Out ‚Äî W. Fitzhugh Brundage\n\nWhy Silent Films Are Still Important\n\nIf you were to travel back in time to 1899, when motion pictures first hit the commercial scene, any movie you could see would be a silent film. The technology wasn‚Äôt yet available to record and synchronize accompanying sound.\n\nInstead of spoken words, moviemakers used intertitles to convey character dialogue or describe what was happening on the screen. But the top directors of the time knew the magic of images and used intertitles only when absolutely needed.\n\nWhile the film industry may have moved past silent filmmaking, it‚Äôll always have a special place in the history of cinema. After all, the work of many filmmakers was already incredibly advanced, especially by the 1920s. Great directors used this format to tell amazing stories through stunning visuals. In fact, today's screenwriting students study silent films because of how cleverly they used images.\n\nNow, these silent films were usually printed on super unstable and flammable nitrocellulose film stock. That means they could deteriorate over time until they couldn't be watched anymore. Sadly, lots of them are gone forever ‚Äì around 80% of them! Thankfully, some dedicated folks around the world have worked hard to save and share the ones that are left, so we can still enjoy them on screen, whether at home, at film festivals, or at your favorite arthouse cinema.\n\nSo when we celebrate Silent Movie Day, we're not just watching old movies; we're experiencing cinematic history.\n\nCome join us September 29, 2023 for a truly inspiring journey into the grandeur of the silent movie era!"
