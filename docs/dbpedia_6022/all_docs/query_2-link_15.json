        "text": "As Hollywood started producing more and more silent films, the airplane seemed like a natural star. Often used as a co-star, and sometimes taking top billing, planes were very photogenic and called upon to perform dangerous stunts. As a result, the pilots of the aircraft in these films were often injured and sometimes died. In 1920 Ormer Locklear and Milton \"Skeets\" Elliot were doing stunt flying for the film The Skywayman. Both were killed during a stunt that was included in the movie.\n\nThe Skywayman featured several aerial stunts like this one. However, none of the footage from the film exists today.\n\nOne of the most audacious stunts to take place on or off film occurred in 1920 in downtown Los Angeles. Stunt Pilot Frank Clarke flew off of a ten story building for the movie \"Stranger Than Fiction.\"\n\nAlthough the film \"Stranger Than Fiction\" might not have been a success, the death defying stunt at the end of the film was!\n\nOne movie about aviation would capture the excitement and optimism of the 1920s better than any other, Wings, would go on to win the first Academy Award for best picture and featured the biggest stars of the era. Wings starred Clara Bow and Charles Rogers and had supporting cast of thousands, including 300 pilots and over 3,000 soldiers. The film's director, William Wellman, was a pilot in the First World War and this experience fueled his desire to make the film's flight scenes as realistic as possible.\n\nScene from \"Wings\" showing a realistic battle scene.\n\nAir to air photography was used in the filming of \"Wings.\"\n\nA behind the scenes look at an epic scene from \"Wings.\"\n\nTrailer for \"Wings.\""
