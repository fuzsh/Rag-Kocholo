        "text": "carrie coon and jude law. CARRIE COON and jude law. carrie coon and JUDE LAW. CARRIE COON AND JUDE LAW!!!!!!!\n\nso many dramas about upper-class families on the verge of collapse, of frustrated housewives and lying husbands, but what elevates The Nest above its oft-stagnant sub-genre is that the doomed couple in question is CARRIE COON AND JUDE LAW. it's blonde-on-blonde emotional violence of the highest caliber, fermenting within the stone walls of their frigid manor, the antithesis of homey comfort. carrie coon is on her gena rowlands shit. jude law is on his Closer (2004) shit. i'm on my Don't Let The Academy Ignore Them shit\n\n73/100\n\nDeploys space so masterfully that I'm not sure how much to credit Durkin (love Martha Marcy May Marlene, but that's a triumph more of editing than of mise-en-scène) vs. cinematographer Mátyás Erdély (who's shot several of the most visually arresting films of the past decade, including Sunset, Son of Saul and the original Miss Bala). Doesn't matter, I suppose—they worked together to create something truly remarkable, albeit potentially maddening for genre buffs. Formally, The Nest replicates the ominous look and feel of a spooky-house chiller, using proximity and distance to generate free-floating unease...but the film has no supernatural or overtly nightmarish elements whatsoever, telling the straightforward story of one family's jarring cross-continental relocation and the ways in which its…\n\nthis is carrie coon's movie and jude law is just living in it\n\nps - this made me think coon would've also killed it as amy dunne (tho rosamund pike is PERFECT)\n\nThe Nest shows us the life of an insatiate broker whose ambitions in life recedes before him. The film depicted a slow but catastrophic downfall of a man due to his elusive greed, affecting his wife and family in the process; he bit off more than he can chew with his superfluous spending, putting on a false front as a man of culture, despite his financial instability and collapsing marriage. Shakespeare said it best, “No legacy is so rich as honesty.” The final scene encapsulates the harsh reality of life and the uncertainty of what’s going to happen next. Jude Law and Carrie Coon’s performances are exceptional that every word they said will linger to you for hours to come. A must-watch drama film for anyone who needs a reality check.\n\nHim: I need to borrow some money.\n\nHer: ok, can you leave the room?\n\nHim: I have to leave the room?\n\nMe, out loud to the television: Yeah you have to leave the room, you fucking idiot.\n\nUtterly masterful performances from Jude Law and Carrie Coon, lensed with such sophistication. Also loved how the 1980s soundtrack is so vibrant, so present - yet it always feels like you’re listening to it underwater, the thoughts and feelings of this family so clinical and distanced for anything in any way euphoric. Very chic! Very intimidating!\n\nOutstanding follow-up to MMMM for Sean Durkin, about a marriage hijacked by the materialist ambitions of a bullshit artist. Connects domestic crisis to the '80s in much the same way as The Ice Storm did to the '70s.... which is why we're pairing the two on The Next Picture Show!\n\nA man with a self described poor childhood becomes insatiable and creates the facade of an affluent business man after moving back to his old town. This film imo has nothing new to offer which is its inevitable weakness. We have a man that lives above his means in order to create this wealthy semblance, a wife that grows tired of pretending and rebels, and the children being affected by it all. This film stayed very surface level for the entire duration which made this a rather dull viewing. It also neglected to expand and explore other avenues that were presented throughout the film. Was disappointed by this one."
