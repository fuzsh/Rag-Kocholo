        "text": "Silent films began very early, and can be defined as black and white films in which had no audio, sound or dialogue due to its lack of technology.\n\nThe first silent film was founded by The Lumiere Brothers, in which they experimented with the moving image. They successfully captured a fast, moving train directly travelling towards the screen, which at that time managed to scare and shock audiences. The 50-second silent film was called L’arrivée d’un train en gare de La Ciotat which in English is The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station.\n\nI looked at a few silent films on Youtube and found them quite inspiring. I watched the famous silent film and first narrative film ‘The Great Train Robbery’ (1903) which followed the story of several heists happening under the roof of a moving train on a platform. The burglars’ facial expressions and actions definitely helped reinforce what was initially happening in the story. The gun firing scenes were exemplified with smoke, which helped illustrate shooting. As well as this, I noticed that the protagonists were moving quite fast. Literally, their steps seemed purposely rendered so that their movement was quickened. Yet, having read more facts, I found out that this wasn’t deliberate, as at that time a non-uniform speed formed due to the hand cracking of the camera. Thus this heightened the comedy, action and moving image.\n\nAlongside this film, I also watched ‘Cook Papa Cook’ (1928) which I discovered was a lost film and transferred from a surviving print! Finding out such facts was mezmorising. But more than that, the film was great. I really enjoyed it. The story followed the life of a cute couple and their son. The wife and husband tended to squabble a lot at each other, throwing water, tripping one up etc. The husband decided to do something for his wife for a change; cook breakfast. This went from an idea to a completely bizarre comedic scene of an attempt to cut the bread and open a tin of oatmeal. Whilst this montage of struggle continued, his son just sat and laughed – thus playing the metaphor of the audience. The film was packed with humour and each action was explicit to help push the story. With help from non-diagetic playful music, the comedy aspect was definitely heightened, where I wanted to see more.\n\n“Since there wasn’t any recorded audio all silent era films had live music such as pianos or organists and sometimes even entire orchestras. This helped to set the mood, theme and setting of the story.” – The history of silent films\n\nThis was very true, as music definitely helped to create an ambience, setting the right tone and mood. For example, I noticed that some silent films integrated a soft, mundane piano beat, suggesting how it was quite emotional, whereas majority used upbeat, rhythmatic piano instrumentals, which highlighted the comedic aspect.\n\nMoreover, silent film tended to communicate through miming, hand gestures, facial expressions and title cards. The title cards helped the audience to understand the story better, but also allowed us to communicate with the characters and their relationship.\n\nThe French silent film; A Trip to the Moon / Le Voyage dans la lune – 1902 was also a very famous silent film inthat era, especially well-known by the Director Georges Méliès. At that time it became very famous for its animation, introducing aliens and new special effects.\n\nI also watched the famous, iconic clock scene from the comedy silent film ‘Safety Last’ (1923) staring Harold Lloyd. The scene was packed with comedic sparks, leaving the audience filled with laughter. The scene where Harold climbed the building was definitely reinforced by his superb gestures and miming. We could truly see his facial expressions and struggle with hanging on, where he neither over-acted or under. And this is a huge factor and essential in silent films. Thus at that time actors which over-acted to add comedy, didn’t do well, therefore their films were burnt.\n\nOverall, there are several vital features of silent films:\n\nMiming, strong facial expressions and gestures – should be very powerful in order to convey particular meanings and to help narrate the story.\n\nStrong actors. Of course with strong actors, they would perpetuate the essential skills above in order to communicate with the audience. Actors in which neutrally perform to push the genre.\n\nMusic. This would preferably consist of piano or other similar instruments, which have various beats and rhythms, each suggesting different genres and setting the mood. The music piece would generally repetitively run throughout the whole film without any stops or breaks.\n\nTitle cards – in order to navigate the story, exaggerate a characters dialogue and help the audience understand the story better.\n\nGenre. Using all the above features to perpetuate the genre of the film, for example comedy, romance, horror etc.\n\nLong takes – these which generally lasted around 5-10 seconds or even longer.\n\nFast paced sequences due to the hand cracking of the Film cameras.\n\nAfter researching these past silent films and looking at their features, I have definitely gained more knowledge and insight within that era. I am more comfortable with the style silent films conduct and therefore this will make my editing much easier. Moreover, I believe that it is extremely helpful for young filmmakers like us to learn more about the history or cinema, and how the first film came about. As well as learning the development of movement, sound, colour and editing in Films."
