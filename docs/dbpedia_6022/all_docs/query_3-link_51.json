        "text": "There are a few rules I believe you need to follow to survive a horror movie. Don’t touch any asteroids that land in your garden, don’t ignore the creepy gas station attendant, and don’t buy anything from weird yard sales. It’s a shame the family in The Nest (2021) don’t follow these rules because after Beth (Sarah Navratil) gets her daughter, Meg (Maple Suttles), a used teddy bear from a yard sale, their lives start to spiral out of control.\n\nBeth has been going through some hard times after she lost her job as a teacher due to her addiction to painkillers. Even though she’s kicked the habit and is trying to get employment again, Meg is suffering from severe separation anxiety, which only seems to get worse after she has an incident in the woods involved her new teddy bear.\n\nMeg’s husband, Jack (Kevin Patrick Murphy) is trying to do what he thinks is best for his family, but he seems to only succeed in annoying either Beth or Meg. He wants to spend more time with his wife but shames her for her efforts to keep Meg calm rather than trying to support her. This only adds to the stress Beth is feeling, leaving her desperate to finally find a job and get some time outside of the house.\n\nWhile the family has no idea what’s going on with Meg’s creepy teddy bear, or why her need to be near her mother seems to be getting worse, the audience is a little more in the know considering we saw what we going on in the home that was holding the yard sale. It includes some bugs, a queen that involves amazing practical effects that anyone who suffers from trypophobia will hate, and lots of eggs.\n\nMeg spends a lot of time arguing with her teddy bear, and seemingly being pushed into situations she doesn’t really want to be in. There’s a lot of chittering going on, and a horrible pulsing in the teddy bear’s stomach. And one night Meg decides to visit her father in the garage, and soon Jack is acting strangely as well.\n\nThe Nest is a mix of human invasion movies such as The Faculty (1998) but with a big chunk of paranoia and gaslighting thrown on top. The new versions of Meg and Jack use their knowledge of Beth’s life and her past mistakes in order to control her and get her right where they want her without exhibiting any real violence until they need to. Meg manages to push her mother’s buttons perfectly and really lays on the guilt about not wanting to be abandoned to keep her mother under the thumb.\n\nIt’s hard to watch because we know that Meg and Jack are the bad guys, but Beth is trying her best to keep her family happy, and therefore, falling for their manipulative behaviour. Meg and Jack start to work their way through any potential support system that Beth has, ensuring they cut her off from the outside world, so they can keep her all to themselves.\n\nWhile the premise of The Nest was really interesting to me, I think it fell at a few hurdles, with the end result being a movie which is quite disappointing overall. The runtime is far too long for the very basic story that is in place, and there’s too many scenes of bug people clicking their mouths at each other, or the vaginal, pulsing teddy bear with his enormous eyes. I’m also disappointed at how little we got to see of the bugs. Most of the shots are hints of legs poking out of the teddy, but we only see a full-sized bug once or twice. Considering how cool the bug queen effects are, I would have loved to have seen more of this.\n\nWith the audience clued in on exactly what’s going on with the bugs and teddy bear right from the start, I think it would have been better if we’d seen Beth able to fight her fate and finally able to stand up to her overbearing family and make her escape. However, it seems her fate is sealed right from the start, and there’s no attempt made to avoid it, which makes the runtime even more inexcusable.\n\nI understand the draw for horror films to go for a bleak ending, but I think a master plan that revolves around people buying the grossest-looking, sewn together plush toys from a random yard sale is probably doomed to fail.\n\nREVIEW SCORE – 1.5/5"
