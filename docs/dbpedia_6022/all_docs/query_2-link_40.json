        "text": "Tribute to the father of the Belgian documentary, Henri Storck (2021)​\n\nTwo masterpieces of silent cinema by Henri Storck: Images d’Ostende (1929) and Misère au Borinage (1933).\n\nAccording to the Belgian director, « silent cinema had developed perfect narrative forms and remarkable shooting techniques ». Storck took advantage of this medium to deliver poetic, graphic and aesthetic images, and to exploit the penetrating force of editing, intertitles and narration.\n\nTo support and sublimate Storck’s art, Stéphane Orlando has recently composed a score at just the right distance from the visual work, brought to the stage by the Ensemble Musiques Nouvelles, which he will conduct for the occasion."
