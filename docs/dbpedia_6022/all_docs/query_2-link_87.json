        "text": "Many decades after Beatlemania overtook the world and pop culture, the Beatles' music is still transforming the lives of others. In this case, Gabrielle Tee, an accomplished musician and piano teacher, was playing with a Beatles cover band, where they would perform an entire Beatles albums at a show.\n\nOne night, after a performance, Frank Thompson, a film historian, author, actor, and Beatles fan, approached Gabrielle after the show to introduce himself and ask, “Have you ever played for film before?” She recounts being surprised at the question and responded, “No, I haven’t.” Acting on a hunch, Frank replied, “I think you’d be really good at it. I can just tell.”\n\nBy all accounts, his hunch proved to be true.\n\nHe and Gabrielle later met for a cup of coffee and talked about the opportunity of composing an original score for a silent film he wanted to show. That film was the 1924 adaptation of Peter Pan. The film’s runtime is approximately 105 minutes.\n\n“For every minute of the film, it takes about an hour to compose the music.”\n\nWith a total of well over two workweeks’ worth of hours in composition and practice, she performed along with the actors in the film, accenting the actions and delivering the mood via music throughout it’s runtime.\n\n“Frank was really pleased afterwards,” she said, and they did two more shows before the pandemic halted the music.\n\nSince the reopening of both the world and of the ’s new location in the River Arts District, it was their cue to return. Both before and after the pandemic, Gabrielle’s piano students would attend the showings to not only support their mentor but also to experience a film crafted well before their lifetime.\n\n“One of my favorite things about my performing and composing career is that my students get to come to the shows, and it inspires them,” Tee said,\n\n“As a movie goer experiencing silent film, I think because we are so used to so much sound and noise in multiple levels of ways, that often when we’re even going to the movies to watch a movie, we’re really excited to. It’s still tempting to leave and go to the bathroom, talk to your friend, check your phone -- all these things happen in a normal movie experience,\" Tee said. \"But, I think there’s something transformational that when you don’t’ have that constant dialogue or all the car crash noises and it’s just piano, you’ve really got to concentrate and follow along. I find that people really go into the moment of the music in the movie and be transported and captured in a different way.”\n\nThe Process Of Scoring\n\nBefore hitting the big screen, Lee must work through her writing process in order to captivate the audience.\n\n“The first thing I do is sit down and watch it in its entirety,” she said. “Some films, it’s really clear that there’s a lot of character development and character arc.” After the viewing, she normally starts with writing the main character’s theme.\n\nAnother key element to composing is matching that theme and the actions of the characters.\n\n“To get to write for that moment is, to me, what this project is all about because I get to help communicate what the story message and the take-away is to the audience,\" Tee said.\n\n“I think what’s so cool about this is I feel like I am helping keep an art form alive, keep these films alive. While you could listen to them with the pre-recorded track in the background, that’s not how they were actually experienced in the moment.”\n\nIt's that mindset of keeping a film alive, telling the story in live time as it was meant to be told, that Tee feels is not only a passion but an honor.\n\n“I get chills. It’s such an honor and privilege and so much feels at stake of best representing the work of these people who gave their lives and careers to that, so that I get to kind of collaborate with them,\" Tee said. \"It’s just not many people get to do that.”\n\nHistorian and host of Silent Sundays at the Grail, Thompson lamented on what Gabrielle brings to the screening.\n\n“Gabrielle’s piano accompaniment is always one of the favorite things of the people that come,\" Thompson said. \"One of my favorite things. I love hearing her play.”\n\nA Background In Film\n\nFrank Thompson has authored many books on film, including a book on silent films that were shot in Asheville. His upcoming book will be about the 1958 film Thunder Road. Upon moving to Asheville from California during the summer of 2015, “I started researching North Carolina, first, North Carolina silent movies and that became a monstrous project. If I’d published the book at that time, it would’ve been a 1000-page book. I just found so much stuff. One thing I kept hearing is that there was a movie made in Asheville called, “The Conquest of Canaan,” which everybody always said was the first film made in Asheville. Of course, I started researching it and found that it was about the 50th film made in Asheville in 1921. Tons of films made in Asheville before then. That’s not even counting nearby.”\n\nThompson said Bat Cave was a “central location for movie production in the teens.”\n\nIn his quest to find the film, “The Conquest of Canaan,” he found that, “The Russian Film Archive had the only original 35mm print of Conquest of Canaan and somebody here in the 80s had convinced the Russians to strike them a print. A 35 mm print from the original, which they showed one time and then never showed again, ever. Luckily around 20 years ago, Russia gave 2k scans of many American films to the Library of Congress. One of them was Conquest of Canaan.”\n\nCommenting on the print, “It had Russian intertitles. It was in fair shape, but not great shape and so I did whatever I could to restore it to a certain semblance of normality. Had a great guy recreate all the titles in the 1921 Paramount style. Found a wonderful Russian lady who translated the Russian intertitles and then I retranslated them to sound like normal speech.”\n\nDuring the restoration process, Frank did not throw caution to the wind.\n\n“Just as a backup, got a brilliant accompanist to compose the score for it, but always hoping I’d have live accompaniment when I showed it,\" he said.\n\nHe was able to hold a screening in 2017 to two sold-out crowds. Frank says, “Movies, especially silent movies, are meant to be seen with an audience. It’s good to be able to share it with an audience, especially a responsive one.” Commenting on the unique reprisal of this art, “You give people a chance to see something new and different and they’ll like it. How can you not?”\n\nThe Next Act\n\nDue to this success, he began work on bringing more films back to the big screen, including the two presented on Feb. 25 at the Grail.\n\n“I think especially the two movies we are sharing tonight (“Falling Leaves” and “Captain January”) are incredibly tender and thought-provoking,\" Tee said on Feb. 25. \"They are about family and childhood and some grief and loss. Just to tap in a share someone else’s story I think, at least for me, when you tap into someone else’s story and feelings, you always learn something about yourself in the process.”\n\nGabrielle considers the biggest privilege of being a part of this is, “getting to help keep these great films and great artists alive. Because the way these films were originally done was with live accompaniment, the best way to keep them alive and keep people excited and interested in them is with music. I think and I hope that it’s new, original music that they haven’t heard before as well.”\n\nBoth Frank's and Gabrielle’s hopes are to continue to score and show silent films on a more regular basis. In addition to more showings, at some point, Frank said he would “love to add one more instrument to the screens, such as a violin or cello.”\n\nMutual Muses\n\n\"Getting to teach students, it allows me to be inspired by their interests, by their creativity. Even just having a young beginner who’s just learning what middle 'C' is, seeing them learn it for the first time, is a constant reminder of the scope and breath of all that there is to learn. At some point, both me and my most advanced high school students, we all started there.”\n\nThat follows the outlook she continually teaches her students.\n\n“If you practice really hard, you stay motivated, you stay curious,\" she said, \"that’s what actually leads to these high levels of what other people maybe see as an accomplishment or fulfillment.”"
