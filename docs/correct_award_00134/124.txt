Why in News?

Recently, the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2023 was awarded to Jon Fosse "for his innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable."

Note

The Nobel Prize in Literature 1913 was awarded to Rabindranath Tagore "because of his profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse, by which, with consummate skill, he has made his poetic thought, expressed in his own English words, a part of the literature of the West".

Who is Jon Fosse?

Jon Fosse, a Norwegian author and dramatist, writes in Norwegian Nynorsk, the less common of the two official versions of Norwegian language.

Jon Fosse is celebrated for his writing style, often referred to as "Fosse minimalism."

His style is characterized by simple, minimal, and searing dialogue, drawing comparisons to literary giants like Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter, both of whom have previously been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

His themes explore the absurdity, the futility and yet the power of the human condition; everyday confusions and irresolutions; and the difficulty of forming actual connections.

Notable works by Fosse include "A New Name: Septology VI-VII," "I Am the Wind," "Melancholy," "Boathouse," and "The Dead Dogs."
