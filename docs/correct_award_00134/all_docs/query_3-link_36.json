        "meta_description": "“On 27 November 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will and testament, giving the largest share of his fortune to a series of prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature and Peace – the Nobel Prizes. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) established The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.” (quoted from Nobelprize.org) On 10 December 2018 this year’s main award ceremonies take place in Stockholm and Oslo, adding the latest laureates to the list. France is leading the list of Literature laureates, with 16 out of the 262, followed by the United States of America (13) and the United Kingdom (11). Germany and Sweden complete the top 5, with 10 and 8 - respectively. Overall citizens of 45 countries were awarded a Literature Nobel Prize, only the Peace Nobel Prize has been given to more countries.  Read more about this map in our blog",

        "text": "Technical Notes\n\nThis map shows each country proportional to the numbers of Nobel Prizes for Literature won by citizens from there between 1901 and 2018.\n\nData sources\n\nThis map uses data by The Nobel Institute (last accessed December 2018). We aim to map as complete data as possible and therefore estimate data for missing values. In some cases, missing data for very small territories is not used in the cartogram and that area is therefore omitted in the map.\n\nFurther notes on the data, as well as all modifications to the original data source are noted in our data sheets.\n\nDownload data file"
