        "text": "Albert Camus was born on November 7th, 1913 in Mondovi, Algeria, a town fifteen and a half miles south of Annaba, the second child of Lucien Auguste and Catherine Helene Sintes. They were a French family settling in French Algeria, referred to as Pied Noir. His father worked as a foreman at a vineyard earning a minimal salary and also served in the military. Catherine was a Spanish woman. She was also partially deaf because of a stroke that damaged her speech for good. Albert Camus only had one brother, Lucien, named after their father. Lucien was three years older than his younger brother and was born three months after the marriage of his mother and father.\n\nIn the spring of 1914, the family moved to Algiers. Albert’s father was drafted and called back into the service that year to serve in the French Zouave infantry in World War I, right around the time that Germany declared war on France. Then on October 11th, 1914, he died due to his wounds from the Battle of the Marne. Albert’s mother began to clean houses and places of business to support her family after the loss of their father in the war. Catherine received money for being a war widow and was given money for each of her children until they turned eighteen. They lived in an apartment with Catherine’s mother and two brothers in the Belcourt sector of Algiers.\n\nIn 1923, Albert was accepted into a lycée secondary school, which is a government run and maintained school. After finishing his secondary schooling in 1932, Camus was accepted into the University of Algiers where he played football. During his time at the University, in 1930 he got tuberculosis. This caused him to quit playing football and become a part time student.

He was laid to rest in the Lourmarin Cemetery in Lourmarin, France.\n\n\"Albert Camus - Bibliography and List of Works.\" Biblio.com: Search Used Books, Textbooks, Rare Books, & Out of Print Books from Independent Booksellers.
