        "text": "I would suggest taking a look at absurdism and the works of Albert Camus. While, as far as I remember, Camus does not address directly the heat death of the universe, his whole theory of Absurdism embraces the idea that the universe as we know it is all there is, and it won't end in a big apocalyptic event where each person's works will be rewarded or punished in some superior, eternal plane of existence.\n\nAs such, he held that our existence is absurd: lacking any prolongation into eternity, whatever we do in life, our bloodlines, cultures and civilizations are bound to disapear, making our effort meaningless in the grand scheme of things. We might take actions to make our lifes or our descendants' lifes better, but in the end since we won't witness anything after our death and even those who outlive us and their legacy are bound to disapear, whether we do it or not won't matter on an absolute level.\n\nIn The Myth of Sisyphus he explores what it means for our own lives and what kind of happiness we can hope for inside this framework. Roughly speaking, since the result of our endeavours won't matter in the end, it is the endeavour itself and the joy it brings to us that matters (but of course, only to us and as long as we are alive). For example, wether we have kids or not won't matter at the end of times, but the very act of raising kids and loving them, and the joy it brings us is the point. If someone feels that raising kids brings them nothing, they are better off just not doing it.\n\nNow, IMHO The Myth of Sisyphus is a very hard read so I'd suggest you start with comments or conferences about Camus and his works, then if you really want to make your own opinion tackle the book in itself.\n\n99% is a huge over-estimate. 1% would be a huge over-estimate. Heat death involves guessing about the state of the universe in 10^106 years. This requires assuming that the guesses we have about the way everything works are not only true but unchanging and adequately complete across a span of space and time a million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion times greater than the entire size and age of the entire universe. More histories of everything -vastly, incomprehensibly more - than there are atoms in the universe. Our totality of actual data is the tiniest partial glimpse of the tiniest fragment of the the totality of available data. And the totality of available data - the entire history of the universe in its most minute detail - is one part in a million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion of the relevant process. Maybe all our constants and mathematical relations are crude approximations of not just curves but squiggles when you zoom out far enough. Maybe dark matter is volatile and aggressively interacts otherwise than gravitation over time scales of just a few million entire histories of everything. We don't know. We can't possibly know. The sample set is too small.\n\nOver such unimaginable vastnesses of time, we can hazard wild guesses that begin: \"in the vanishingly unlikely circumstance that all the things we have ignored can safely be ignored and all the things we've assumed can safely be assumed...\"\n\nThese guesses are valuable. Firstly because we might as well guess, however insufficient our data: agnosticism with a best guess is better than total agnosticism, no matter how weak the best guess is. Second, because out of such guesses may occasionally come testable hypotheses, whose content would be a complete surprise to the original guessers.\n\nBut the only really true thing we can say about the eventual fate of the universe is to acknowledge the titanic scale of our ignorance."
