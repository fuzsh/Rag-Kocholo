        "text": "It is a century since French Nobel Prize-winning author Albert Camus was born — and more than 50 years since he died in an accident on an icy road — yet the polemics over his legacy and \"mysterious\" death rumble on.\n\nWhat his only daughter, Catherine Camus, recalls, however, is not the man shunned by Algeria, the country of his birth, as an Arab-despising colonialist, nor the slowness of the French establishment to recognize him, nor even the anti-communist who may — or may not — have been murdered by the Russians.\n\n\"Was he killed by the KGB? I don't know and I don't want to know. He was Papa,\" she says, her voice faltering just a fraction. \"And I lost him. There is nothing more to say. It was horrible enough that he was taken away; the idea that this was done deliberately is unbearable. In any case the result was the same. He was dead.\""
