        "text": "You know what charm is: a way of getting the answer yes without having asked any clear question.\n\n~Albert Camus\n\nA few words about the author of this quote\n\nAlbert Camus ( 7 November 1913 ‚Äì 4 January 1960) was a French philosopher, author, and journalist. His views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. He wrote in his essay The Rebel that his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of nihilism while still delving deeply into individual freedom. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957. Camus did not consider himself to be an existentialist despite usually being classified as a follower of it, even in his lifetime. In a 1945 interview, Camus rejected any ideological associations: ‚ÄúNo, I am not an existentialist. Sartre and I are always surprised to see our names linked.‚Äù Camus was born in French Algeria to a Pied-Noir family and studied at the University of Algiers, from which he graduated in 1936. In 1949, Camus founded the Group for International Liaisons to ‚Äúdenounce two ideologies found in both the USSR and the USA‚Äù.Throughout his life, Camus spoke out against and actively opposed totalitarianism in its many forms. One further important, often neglected component of Camus‚Äô philosophical and literary persona was his love of classical Greek thought and literature, or philhellenism. This love looks back to his youthful encounters with Friedrich Nietzsche, his teacher Jean Grenier, and his own sense of a ‚ÄúMediterranean‚Äù identity. Some of his most famous and widely read works are the novels ‚ÄúThe Stranger‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Plague‚Äú..\n\nWebsite // Facebook // Instagram\n\nDo You Agree With This Quote?\n\nLet Me Know Your Thoughts in the Comments Below!\n\nDo You Have a Story to Share?\n\nI ‚Äòd Love to Read it and Create Some Beautiful Picture Quotes from it!
