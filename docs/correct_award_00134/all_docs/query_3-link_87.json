        "text": "2 min read\n\nSource: IE\n\nWhy in News?\n\nRecently, the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2023 was awarded to Jon Fosse \"for his innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable.\"\n\nNote\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1913 was awarded to Rabindranath Tagore \"because of his profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse, by which, with consummate skill, he has made his poetic thought, expressed in his own English words, a part of the literature of the West\".\n\nWho is Jon Fosse?\n\nJon Fosse, a Norwegian author and dramatist, writes in Norwegian Nynorsk, the less common of the two official versions of Norwegian language.\n\nJon Fosse is celebrated for his writing style, often referred to as \"Fosse minimalism.\"\n\nHis style is characterized by simple, minimal, and searing dialogue, drawing comparisons to literary giants like Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter, both of whom have previously been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nHis themes explore the absurdity, the futility and yet the power of the human condition; everyday confusions and irresolutions; and the difficulty of forming actual connections.\n\nNotable works by Fosse include \"A New Name: Septology VI-VII,\" \"I Am the Wind,\" \"Melancholy,\" \"Boathouse,\" and \"The Dead Dogs.\"\n\nWho are the Other Recent Nobel Laureates in the Field of Literature?\n\n2022:\n\nAnnie Ernaux “for the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory”.\n\n2021:\n\nAbdulrazak Gqurnah “for his uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents”.\n\n2020:\n\nLouise Glück “for her unmistakable poetic voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal”.\n\nReference to Other Announcements of the Nobel Prizes 2023: Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Physics, Physiology or Medicine."
