        "text": "Albert Einstein, a respected Nobel Prize winner and scientist who had a great impact on the science community through his research that created answers to the mysteries of the physical world such as the general theory of relativity. He was an intelligent individual, obtaining many honors and titles in the science community. Einstein truly represents something that many of us long for, success. As a society, we often praise him and others who seemed to have been gifted with the desirable gift of…\n\nThe Plague: Reading Log #1 1.) The plague begins in the Algerian port town of Oran in the 1940’s. Due to unknown reason, all the rats in town begin dying in a horrific manner. The town doctor, Bernard Rieux becomes concerned because of the manner the rats are dying. Soon the rats stop dying and the citizens become ill. It became evident that the Bubonic plague has hit the town. As people began to die, Rieux and other doctors beg authorities to take preventive action which results in a quarantine…\n\nis both brave, and dedicated. Bethany has never given up her dreams even after a shocking yet horrifying incident occurring only at the age of fifteen. Bethany’s story of courage can easily be categorized the same as both “The Myth of Sisyphus” by Albert Camus, and “I Think Continually of Those Who Were Truly Great” by Stephen Spender. Both pieces of literature connect to Bethany Hamilton because they are both about being brave, and fighting through suffrage,…\n\nNegative Body- Body Image Effects Researchers have long said that because central importance is assigned to media, mass media can foster unrealistic images of female beauty (Perloff, 2014). Internalization of these images are commonly leads to body dysmorphia and dissatisfaction. Internalization of thin-idealized female beauty is a key factor in a culturally stereotyped standard of beauty. This standard is vastly communicated in contemporary media throughout Westernized societies. More than 80%…\n\nKierkegaard, Camus, and Sartre are three main philosophers that have overlapping ideas of Existentialism. Throughout Kierkegaard 's book Fear and Trembling, Camus’ book Absurd Creation, and Sartre’s book Existentialism and play No exit, the idea of the ability for one to make one’s own choices and decisions through free will is shown. These philosophers opened my eyes to a new perspective on what existence precedes essence means. While reading these books, I agreed with some ideas as opposed to…\n\nAlbert Camus once stated that a novel “is never anything but a philosophy expressed in images” (Kellman). In his works, such as The Stranger, he envelops the ideal of absurdism, which the Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary & Cultural Criticism states that, drawn upon from The Myth of Sisyphus, includes the idea that “in a world without God, human life and human suffering have no intrinsic meaning.” The philosophy stemmed from and closely resembles existentialism, which sees the predicament…\n\nnature by containing animals in aquariums and zoos. People may love to see exotic animals, but this is controlling nature. Man is controlling where the animals live, what they eat, and what other animals and people they come in contact with. Dr. Albert Schweitzer says, “So nature does indeed need protection from man” (Carson 314). Therefore, man is to provide protection only and not to have power over it. Even though man may be helping some animals, we still have control over them. We…\n\nAlbert Camus in the story of “The Guest” is trying to communicate one of the experiences of humans under distressed situations while shaping their decisions in such isolation. We can all decide at some point in our lives to make better decisions weather we believe in it or not as far we understand our sense of worth. Camus is trying to present the morals of these characters in the story. An isolated environment of French occupied Algerian territory, where the story takes place. Daru a teacher…\n\nDiscoveries are valuable as they have the power to challenge the individual's perspective of themselves and of the world around us which influences our development both emotionally and spiritually. Valuable Discoveries have a major presence in Che Guevara's Motorcycle Diaries as they influence Guevara's discovery of himself and also of his perception of reality, however slow their influence may be. The emotional responses towards valuable, but complex discoveries can both contribute negatively…\n\nvaccination programs, such as the World Health Organization took the vaccine to the ends of the earth and “eliminated smallpox worldwide”. Jenner’s findings in his vaccine with smallpox sparked interest in scientists all over. Doctor Jonas Salk and Doctor Albert Sabin had a competition with poliomyelitis, or polio, to see who could find the cure. In Smallpox, Syphilis and Salvation: Medical Breakthroughs That Changed the World by Sherly Ann Persson, researcher and former nurse, wrote in her…"
