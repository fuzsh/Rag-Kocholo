But a pig will look a man in the eye and see his equal.\n\nSir Winston Churchill, to his grandson\n\nA fanatic is one who can't change his mind and won't change the subject.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nAn aphorism is not an aphorism unless you know what it means.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nDemocracy is the worst system of government ever devised by mankind, except for all the others.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nEven though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.\n\nSir Winston Churchill, in his address to the House of Commons, June 4, 1940, following the evacuation of over 338,000 British, French, and Belgian troops at Dunkirk\n\nGratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nI cannot forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma; but perhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interest.\n\nSir Winston Churchill, in a radio broadcast on October 3, 1939\n\nI have taken more good from alcohol than alcohol has taken from me.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nIf Hitler invaded Hell I would make at least a favourable reference to the devil in the House of Commons.\n\nSir Winston Churchill, in a speech after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, June, 1941\n\nKites rise highest against the wind...not with it.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nMen occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing had happened.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nNancy, if I were your husband I'd drink it.\n\nSir Winston Churchill, in response to Lady Astor's statement \"Winston, if I were your wife I'd put poison in your coffee\", Blenheim Palace\n\nNever give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never - in nothing, great or small, large or petty - never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.\n\nSir Winston Churchill, in a commencement address speech at Harrow School, October 29, 1941\n\nNever in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few\n\nSir Winston Churchill, in reference to the RAF during the early years of WWII.\n\nNothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result.\n\nSir Winston Churchill, The Malakand Field Force, 1898\n\nPolitics is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow, next week, next month and next year. And to have the ability afterwards to explain why it didn't happen.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nThe best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nThe first casualty of war is always the truth.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nThe greatest lesson in life is to know that even fools are right sometimes.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nThe other day President Roosevelt gave his opponent in the late Presidential election a letter of introduction to me, and in it he wrote out a verse in his own handwriting from Longfellow, which, he said, \"applies to you people as it does to us.\" Here is the verse:\n\n. . . Sail on, O Ship of State!\n\nSail on, O Union, strong and great!\n\nHumanity with all its fears\n\nWith all the hopes of future years\n\nIs hanging breathless on thy fate!\n\nWhat is the answer that I shall give in your name to this great man, the thrice-chosen head of a nation of 130,000,000? Here is the answer which I will give to President Roosevelt.\n\nPut your confidence in us. Give us your faith and your blessing, and under Providence all will be well. We shall not fail or falter; we shall not weaken or tire. Neither the sudden shock of battle nor the long-drawn trials of vigilance and exertion will wear us down. Give us the tools and we will finish the job.\n\nSir Winston Churchill, BBC radio broadcast, Feb 9, 1941\n\nTheir insatiable lust for power is only equaled by their incurable impotence in exercising it.\n\nSir Winston Churchill, speaking of the opposition party after WWII\n\nThis is the sort of bloody nonsense up with which I will not put.\n\nSir Winston Churchill (attributed), written after an editor attempted to rearrange one of Churchill's sentences to avoid ending it in a preposition.\n\n1. To climb a high wall which is leaning toward you.\n\n2. To kiss a girl who is leaning away from you.\n\n3. To speak before a group on a subject which they know more about than I.\n\nSir Winston Churchill, in response to being asked what the three most difficult tasks in life to perform are\n\nWe make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nA human being is a part of the whole, called by us the `universe', a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to enhance all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and of a foundation for inner security.\n\nAlbert Einstein, quoted in New York Post, Nov. 28, 1972\n\nAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex.... It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage - to move in the opposite direction\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nAs far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nBefore God we are all equally wise - and equally foolish.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nCommon sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nEthical axioms are found and tested not very differently from the axioms of science.

I am only passionately curious.\n\nAlbert Einstein, to his biographer Carl Seelig, 1952\n\nI know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nI live in that solitude which is painful in youth, but delicious in the years of maturity.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nI never think of the future - it comes soon enough.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nI think and think for months and years. Ninety-nine times, the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am right.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nI want to know the thoughts of God. Everything else is just details.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nIf a cluttered desk signs a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nIf my theory of relativity is proven correct, Germany will claim me as a German and France will declare that I am a citizen of the world. Should my theory prove untrue, France will say that I am a German and Germany will declare that I am a Jew.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nIf we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nImagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nImagination is more important than knowledge. When I examine myself and my methods of thought, I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nIn the present circumstances, the only profession I would choose would be one where earning a living has nothing to do with the search for knowledge\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nInsanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nIt is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nIt is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nIt should be possible to explain the laws of physics to a barmaid.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nMost mistakes in philosophy and logic occur because the human mind is apt to take the symbol for the reality.\n\nAlbert Einstein, in Cosmic Religion, 1931\n\nMy religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nNot everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.\n\nAlbert Einstein, sign in his office at Princeton\n\nNot until we dare to regard ourselves as a nation, not until we respect ourselves, can we gain the esteem of others, or rather only then will it come of its own accord.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nOnce you accept the universe as matter expanding into nothing that is something, wearing stripes with plaid comes easy.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nOne cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nOnly two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nPeace comes through understanding\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nProblems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nPut your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour.

(God is clever, but he's not malicious.)\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nScience without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nThe Bible [is] a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish.

This enables it to organize and sway the emotions of the masses, and make its tool of them.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nThe most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious; it is the source of all true art and science.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nThe most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nThe only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nThe release of atomic energy has not created a new problem. It has merely made more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nThe secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nThe true value of a human being is determined primarily by the measure and the sense in which he has attained liberation from the self.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nThe word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses.\n\nAlbert Einstein, in a letter to Eric Gutkind in 1954\n\nThe words of language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The physical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nThere are two ways to live your life.
