        "text": "Science Quotes by Albert Camus (4 quotes)\n\nI know with sure and certain knowledge that a man’s work is nothing but this slow trek to rediscover, through the detours of art, those two or three great and simple images in whose presence his heart first opened.\n\n— Albert Camus\n\nI shall tell you a great secret, my friend. Do not wait for the last judgment. It takes place every day.\n\n— Albert Camus\n\nUnderstanding the world for a man is reducing it to the human, stamping it with his seal.\n\n— Albert Camus\n\nYou tell me of an invisible planetary system in which electrons gravitate around a nucleus. You explain this world to me with an image. I realize that you have been reduced to poetry. … So that science that was to teach me everything ends up in a hypothesis, that lucidity founders in metaphor, that uncertainty is resolved in a work of art.\n\n— Albert Camus"
