Yes? Then you are in good position. As to get the award you will wait the shortest time.\n\nHow to become Nobel Prize Laureates.\n\n(with pinch of salt)\n\nFrom all the facts you can gather about the Laureates the less know is that 11%of the First Names start from letter S.\n\nMonetary value\n\nThe value of the prize has been been up then down during the years - with the year 1919 being the the lowest and 2001 having the highest benefit for the Laureates. Is worth to mention that it is common for recipients to donate prize money to benefit scientific, cultural, or humanitarian causes."
