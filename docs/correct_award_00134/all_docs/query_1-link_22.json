        "text": "Philosophically speaking, I’m not terribly knowledgeable. I suppose I should consider myself lucky that Lesione already has me self-aware enough to note that hole in my higher reasoning skills. At the same time, I’m not convinced that even if I did have a strong grasp on philosophy that I’d know what it is Camus is going on about. The texts starts off well enough, with Camus highlighting several details and variations on Sisyphus’ life and crimes against the gods that I’ve never read before or realized even existed. Using the mythos he previously describes, Camus then applies the absurdist viewpoint to Sisyphus’ actions and punishment fairly reasonably. Unfortunately, it's after Camus\n\nInitially, Albert Camus lived with his deaf mother after his father died. From years 1913 to 1943, he lived in Algeria much like Meursault. His grandmother tried to make him get a job but he wanted to get an education. In 1930, he graduated with a major in Philosophy then he went to the University of Algiers to help his career in publishing. His literary works, The Stranger and “The Myth of Sisyphus”, display a fascination in the philosophy of Existentialism. He joined the Algerian People’s Party to resist French colonization and to liberate the Algerians. His perspective on French colonization is evident in The Stranger when he did not give the Arab\n\nLeonardo Da Vinci was a inventor , scientist , and a painter. He is known for his famous painting he did of Mona Lisa , Not only is he know for that he also is know for his great inventions. One of his inventions was called the war machine called the 33-barreled organ. Da Vinci had got a idea for that weapon when he saw that a cannon takes to much time to reload in battles. He thought it would be so much better for battles because i mean who wants to get shot at while trying to reload on the other hand with the 33-barreled organ while a soldier is shooting they can reload at the same time.\n\nThe very first sentence in the Albert Camus book The Stranger is “Maman died today.” (3) Maman is Meursault’s mother. Meursault is the main character; he had placed his mother in a nursing home because he was not able to care for her. People throughout the neighborhood that Meursault lived in, thought poorly of him ever since he had placed his Maman in a nursing home. In this paper, I will investigate why people think negatively towards Meursault for putting his Maman in a nursing home.\n\nAlbert Einstein is widely known for the atomic bomb, his studies in physics and medicine, also proving gravity was a pushing force. Einstein had a lot of adversity in his life, but he surmounts the negative connotations of him and other Jews. Einstein faced adversity during his life, he had to take several breaks in his research, but he triumphed over it by proving everyone wrong. Einstein went to university at the university of Zurich, he had many jobs, he was at risk during the holocaust and wars, he had to stop researching many times, he had home issues, and he never gave up on life.\n\nCamus optically discerns Sisyphus as the absurd hero who lives life to the plenary, execrates death, and is condemned to a nonessential task. Camus presents Sisyphus's ceaseless and unavailingly futile toil as a metaphor for modern lives spent working at futile jobs in factories and offices. In the Myth of Sisyphus This man, sentenced to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain and then visually examining its descent, is the epitome of the absurd hero according to Camus. Sisyphus realizes that the rock’s falling is ineluctably foreordained, so pushing the rock up the mountain becomes purportless. So it is with our own lives if there is no God and no coherent meaning in the macrocosm then our everyday activities become entirely frivolous.\n\nAlbert Camus, author novelist, playwright and essayist French, is considered one of the most important writers after 1945. He is considered the representative of 'atheist' Existentialism. Existentialism is a denial of all established morality, but at the same time affirmation of another moral philosophy. This another philosophy has a name: the moral ambiguity. He was born at Mondovì (currently Drean, Algeria), on November 7, 1913. His work, characterized by a vigorous and concise style reflects a society dedicated to nihilism, after the destruction of their values and sense of alienation and disenchantment with the affirmation of the positive qualities of dignity and fraternity human. Albert Camus is the\n\nAlbert Camus was the brilliant and artistic writer who wrote The Stranger which was published in 1942. Because of Camus’ creative way of writing, he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957. Camus used straightforward sentences to make Meursault’s complicated lifestyle into a simple and understanding character through his masterful and great technique of writing. The Stranger is about a man named Meursault and how his behavior and relationship with his mother was used against him during his trial for killing an Arab. Meursault’s relationship with his mother is significant in the Stranger because it portrays Meursault’s distant relationship with his mom, his lack of respect to his mother’s death and his lack of emotions towards significant events in\n\nCamus read many of Sartre’s work while he was developing his own theories about the absurd, and the two remained close friends for many years (9); Sartre even “approvingly summarized and quoted from The Myth of Sisyphus after its release” (6). With this being said, the two eventually had a falling out “in the midst of the Cold War as they began to disagree about philosophy and politics” (7), and one of the greatest philosophical differences between the two men regards the approach to defining yourself under given circumstances.\n\nWidely recognized for philosophical writings as a French essayist and playwright, Albert Camus is a major contributor to exploring the absurd in modern Western literature. Characterized by highlighting the human condition, Camus’ writing style focuses on the everyday lives and inner psyche of individuals in both ordinary and extraordinary circumstances. Such a character-driven writing style is most notably displayed in his 1946 work, The Stranger, a tale of an emotionally-detached man known as Meursault, who lives in French-colonized Algiers during the intermission of the two World Wars. Consisting of two parts—The Stranger first explores his daily life as a free man, and in the second, delves more into the character’s own philosophy as Meursault contemplates during his remaining time in jail. At its core, the story explores the relationships and interactions of the odd Meursault through the character’s inner monologue and dialogue with those around him. The story itself is very ambiguous in its’ nature, and the idea of contemplating the meaning of life and purpose is prevalent throughout The Stranger. Evidently, Camus writes Meursault as a man who believes that life has no meaning, and therefore people are free to do as they please. To supplement the protagonist’s view, the author also presents Meursault alongside various personalities of key supporting characters, each with their own unique personality, and differing outlooks on life. Doing so thus enables Camus to get readers to contemplate about meaning through multiple perspectives. Stylistically, through many devices that emphasize diction, imagery, and story themes. Ultimately, The Stranger is a way for Camus to convey that there are multiple ways to perceive the meaning of life, using Meursault to directly project a different view than what readers are used to. Surely, with the intent of crafting a protagonist so strange, that Meursault becomes comparable to other characters; less so as a reflection of what the author personally believes the meaning of life is, but more of what such exploration of the idea could be."
