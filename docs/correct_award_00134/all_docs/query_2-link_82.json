        "text": "Einstein’s Dreams: Alan Lightman on the Life and Work of Albert Einstein\n\nGenerally considered one of the most influential physicists in history, Albert Einstein’s (1879–1955) groundbreaking theories reshaped the scientific community’s view and understanding of the universe. He developed the special and general theories of relativity and won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation...\n\nEinstein’s Mistakes: The Human Failings of Genius\n\nOhanian’s book begins by presenting Albert Einstein as a young graduate student seeking a university appointment before accepting a discouraging post as a patent clerk. The narrative is immediately engaging and sets the accessible, and often light-hearted tone carried throughout the book. Ohanian highlights Einstein’s...\n\nEinstein and Oppenheimer: The Meaning of Genius\n\nEinstein and Oppenheimer examines the lives of two of the 20th century’s most consequential physicists. The book is not a conventional biographical treatment of the two men, but instead takes a look at their views on creativity, their spiritual philosophies and their various approaches to...\n\nIt’s About Time: Understanding Einstein’s Relativity\n\n“Relativity is about time. What could be more familiar?” Thus states Mermin on the first page of his book. Familiar indeed, but how easy is it to understand the Theory of Relativity? It’s About Time: Understanding Einstein’s Relativity began as a series of notes and...\n\n112 Mercer Street: Einstein, Russell Gödel, Pauli, and the End of Innocence in Science\n\nDuring the winter of 1943-44, as much of the supposedly civilized world was in the throes of WWII, four of the most brilliant thinkers of the century gathered in a small colonial-style house in Princeton, New Jersey. The home’s owner, Albert Einstein, hosted the informal...\n\nEinstein 1905: The Standard of Greatness\n\nEinstein 1905: The Standard of Greatness, is a detailed look at the five papers written by Einstein in 1905—known as his Annus Mirabilis, the extraordinary year—that truly separated him from other physicists of his time and beyond. The book looks into the interconnection between those...\n\nEinstein and Our World\n\nEinstein and Our World is in many ways like an engaging, introductory school course—so effectively conveyed that it might inspire a lifelong passion for the subject. The “instructor” in this case is David C. Cassidy, a professor of natural sciences at Hofstra University, and the...\n\nE=mc2: A Biography of the World’s Most Famous Equation\n\nThis is a book about a mathematical formula that nearly everyone—even those who are science-phobic—can recite, but almost no one can actually explain with the slightest degree of coherence. If pressed for details, many of us might draw a straight line between Albert Einstein’s tiny...\n\nThe Curvature of Spacetime: Newton, Einstein and Gravitation\n\nIn the late 1970s, Steve Allen hosted a show on PBS called “A Meeting of Minds.” Its format was a talk show bringing together renowned historical personalities, portrayed by actors. Similar in concept is the format of Harald Fritzsch’s “The Curvature of Spacetime,” which is..."
