First published in French as L’Etranger in 1942, Albert Camus’ The Outsider addresses the constrictive nature of society and what happens when an individual tries to break free from the conformity forced upon him by staying true to himself, and following his own ideal of absolute truth and sincerity in every action. Propelled more by the philosophy of existentialism and the notion of the absurd than plot and characters, Camus’ novel raises many questions about life, and answers them\n\nThe Stranger “The Stranger,” written by the Algerian writer Albert Camus, is a novel about Meursault, a character who’s different and even threatening views on life take him to pay the highest price a person can pay: his life. This was Camus’ first novel written in the early 1940’s, in France, and it reflects the authors belief that there is no meaning in life and it is absurd for humans to try to find it places like religion.

Albert Camus was also awarded the Nobel prize in Literature in 1957. However, Albert did not have an easy life growing up. His father was killed in World War I, at the Battle of the Marne. Albert, his mother, and his brother shared a two-bedroom apartment with their grandmother and a paralyzed uncle. Even though his family was very poor Camus attended the University of Algiers, supporting\n\nSince the publication of the novel “The Plague” written by Albert Camus, it has received a tremendous amount of attention. According to The Guardian, within a year, the novel had been translated into nine languages and was considered to be a classic of world literature. This novel truly was a triumph and deserved all of the great outcome it has received. Camus used an allegory of epidemic illness in order to bring his moral message about the potential dangers of tyranny for humanity with the help\n\nalways be indifferent towards him. One could even argue that Meursault is both an existentialist and an absurdist, because the absurdist personality was formed by the Europeans from the existentialist personality. Albert Camus was the first one to show both of these personalities to people. Camus tries to show readers that Meursault is not a normal. His view on the world is very abnormal. Absurdism refers to humanity’s need to look for meaning in life and inability to find meaning. Meursault identifies\n\nThe Stranger by Albert Camus, begins by Meursault’s mother dying. Meursault does not express any anguish towards the death, this introduces the theme, life is meaningless. The only thing that life guarantees is death, why live if you’re ultimately working towards the inevitable. The theme is shown early on in the book after his mother’s funeral when he thought, “Mother was buried now, tomorrow I’d be going back to work as usual. Really, nothing had changed,” (Camus 30).

Absurdum was the philosophical idea that people make vain efforts to rationalize an irrational existence and universe.

At the time of Camus’ death, he was only 46. In that short time he was more than just a writer; he was also an actor, playwright\n\nAlbert Camus’ The Stranger, illustrates the absurdity that Camus himself believes to be true about the natural world. Camus’ view of the lack of control humans have on the world is one that is quite extreme, but undoubtedly hard to argue against. The belief that there is no meaning to life, and no real purpose, and no explanation to anything surrounding the world we live in has eluded its way from Camus through Meursault; our main character. The piece designed portrays the emptiness that Meursault\n\nThe Plague, by Albert Camus, is a story following a man named Dr. Rieux living in the town of Oran on the coast of Algeria, which was a French owned territory in Africa.
