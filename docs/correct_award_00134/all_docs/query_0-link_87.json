        "text": "With the reading group I organize, we are reaching the end of a series of discussions centered on A. O. Scott’s book, Better Living through Criticism. Afterwards, beginning in May, we will turn to a collection of short stories by Albert Camus, Exile and the Kingdom. We will dedicate each session to one story—six sessions in total going from May 4th to June 8th.\n\nMay 4th: “The Adulterous Woman”\n\nMay 11th: “The Renegade, or A Confused Mind”\n\nMay 18th: “The Voiceless” (Also translated as “The Silent Men”)\n\nMay 25th: “The Guest”\n\nJune 1st: “Jonas, or the Artist at Work”\n\nJune 8th: “The Growing Stone”\n\nTo students of philosophy, Albert Camus (1913 – 1960) is better known for the Myth of Sisyphus and the Rebel. More broadly within the humanities, students read the Stranger, the Plague and the Fall. Camus’ writings are accessible to students, but for their depth and vitality, they remain engaging even after many years. Camus was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957. His life is at least as significant as his written body of work."
