Werner Herzog: Documentaries and Shorts, available exclusively through his website, features a whopping 25 films across six discs. While some of them had been available prior to the set's release (on Anchor Bay's own version of Lessons of Darkness, a couple DVDs from New Yorker, and Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe being on Criterion's Burden of Dreams), 20 would since appear elsewhere, on releases from Raro Video, the BFI, and Shout! Factory. The four outliers (I Am My Films, Jag Mandir, Bells from the Deep, and Wings of Hope) remain exclusive to the box as of 2023, which is the only reason anyone would still want it anyway.

If you're not sure as to why the previous sentence ended like it did, consider this: Horrendous interlacing.
