        "text": "It’s the end of another week here at BCB After Dark: the grooviest spot for night owls, early risers, new parents and Cubs fans abroad. Come on in and spend some of your evening with us. We’re always glad to see friends, new ones or old ones. Let us know if you need anything. There are still a few tables available. Bring your own beverage.\n\nBCB After Dark is the place for you to talk baseball, music, movies, or anything else you need to get off your chest, as long as it is within the rules of the site. The late-nighters are encouraged to get the party started, but everyone else is invited to join in as you wake up the next morning and into the afternoon.\n\nThe Cubs finished their series with the Twins with an 8-2 win this afternoon. So that’s good news.\n\nYesterday I simply asked you who is your current pick for World Series champion. Thirty-five percent of you picked the Phillies and another 29 percent said the Orioles.\n\nHere’s the part where I talk about music and movies. You can skip ahead to the baseball at the end. You won’t hurt my feelings.\n\nTonight we’ve got a brand new one of those NPR Tiny Desk concerts, featuring Brazilian music legend Milton Nascimento along with Esperanza Spalding, who is only not considered a legend because she’s too young to be called that yet.\n\nThis video was posted earlier today.\n\nDirector Todd Haynes’ 2007 film I’m Not There is maybe the oddest musical biopic (of sorts) around, and that’s saying something since Haynes first made a name for himself by directing a musical biopic of Karen Carpenter in which all the parts were played by Barbie dolls. Haynes uses real actors here, but the result is hardly any less weird. Haynes uses six different actors to portray different fictional Bob Dylans. Each of them is meant to portray a different facet of Dylan’s personality. In the end, if you’re looking to I’m Not There to gain some insight into Dylan, you’re not going to find it. But if you want to listen to a lot of Bob Dylan music and get an interesting deconstruction on the musical biopic genre, then I’m Not There is worth checking out.\n\nTo be clear, the title I’m Not There is practically literal here. Bob Dylan does not appear in this film except in some concert footage that runs just before the closing credits. And none of the characters in this film are actually named Bob Dylan. All six characters have different names and different stories loosely adapted from the mythology that has surrounded Dylan’s life. Some are based on real events, although one Dylan story is taken from the film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid that Dylan starred in. The stories never really intersect, although Haynes is constantly leaving one story to pick up on another and coming back later.\n\nThe most famous portrayal of “Dylan” in this movie is Cate Blanchett’s performance as Jack Quinn, a character taken straight out of the mid-sixties period of Dylan and the 1967 documentary Dont Look Back. And Blanchett is frankly spellbinding as the obstreperous and pretentious Quinn. Wearing a big curly Dylan wig and sunglasses most of the time, it’s easy to forget sometimes that a woman is playing “Dylan” here. But sometimes the fact that “Quinn” is being played by a woman underscores the fact that behind this argumentative star is really a scared boy. The arguments and evasions become a mask for someone who really isn’t all that tough.\n\nAs you can tell from Blanchett’s casting, Haynes is not at all interested in historical accuracy. After all, he doesn’t even call any of these characters “Bob Dylan.” The relationship of I’m Not There to the actual life is Bob Dylan is roughly equivalent of The Rutles’ film All You Need is Cash is to the Beatles’ story. Yes, all the beats are there, but that’s not how the story actually went. Haynes isn’t going for humor like the Rutles were, however. At least he’s not usually going for a laugh. David Cross playing Allen Ginsberg is pretty funny.\n\nOther “Dylans” include “Woody Guthrie” an 11-year-old black runaway played by Marcus Carl Franklin. This is the “fake” Dylan, the Dylan that mainly existed in the stories that Dylan made up about himself. The “poet” Dylan is Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Whishaw), who spends the film being interrogated and is only shown by himself looking into the camera. Rimbaud interrupts the film from time to time to offer his thoughts on art and other things.\n\nChristian Bale plays Jack Rollins, who is the “prophet” Dylan. This is the Dylan that earns a name for himself playing the Greenwich Village folk circuit, but eventually throws it all away because it doesn’t mean anything. Jack eventually becomes a born-again Christian and a preacher. His story is told through a fake documentary.\n\nHeath Ledger is Robbie Clark, an actor who plays Rollins in a movie. He becomes a kind of avatar of Dylan’s personal life and the poor way he ignored his wife and kids for long periods of time. And Richard Gere plays the “outlaw” Billy McCarty, which is Dylan in the Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid movie.\n\nHaynes isn’t particularly interested in who Bob Dylan was or what motivated him. That should be clear by the way he fictionalized everything in the film. Haynes seemingly throws up his hands and says that Dylan is an unknowable enigma and that we shouldn’t even try to understand him. Instead, he’s interested in what Bob Dylan means as a symbol. Of course, he pretty much leaves it up to you to decide what those symbols means. Some of you will find that interesting. Others will find it frustrating. I think that’s what Haynes was going for.\n\nI should mention that unlike Haynes’ Superstar, his Karen Carpenter movie, he got the rights to all the Dylan songs for I’m Not There. So if you’re a Dylan fan, there’s a ton of good music here. Some of it is the original recordings of Dylan and some of it is cover versions of Dylan songs.\n\nFinally, another reason to watch I’m Not There is that when the actual Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown gets released on Christmas Day this year, you are definitely going to hear someone say that Timothée Chalomet’s performance as Bob Dylan wasn’t as good as Cate Blanchett’s. It’s a given. She’s just that good. And if you watch I’m Not There, you’ll know what they’re talking about.\n\nHere’s the trailer for I’m Not There.\n\nBy the way, I consider musical biopics to be a scourge of Hollywood right now. Much more than superhero movies. But that’s a question for another day. But I liked I’m Not There.\n\nWelcome back to those of you who skip the music and movies.\n\nPete Crow-Armstrong is making a big impact in his rookie season. Yes, he has struggled—sometimes badly—at the plate, but he has been getting better lately. Hopefully, that’s a sign of better things to come.\n\nOn defense, PCA has lived up to the hype. Yes, he’s made a couple of mistakes out there, but he’s also catching balls out there in center that no other center fielder in the league can catch. I wouldn’t be surprised if Crow-Armstrong wins a Gold Glove this year. It will depend on whether his bat comes around enough that he can get enough starts in center field.\n\nBut tonight, we’re going to talk about his baserunning. A lot of you have noticed that when Crow-Armstrong does make contact, he turns singles into doubles and doubles into triples. He’s also 22-for-22 in stolen base attempts.\n\nThat’s what I’m going to ask about. The record for steals in one season without getting caught is 30, set by Trea Turner just last year. Vince Coleman stole 50-straight bases without getting caught, but that was over two seasons.\n\nSo Crow-Armstrong has to steal nine more bases this year without getting caught to claim the record. Do you think he’ll get it?\n\nHe’ll have to get on base often enough to steal at least nine more bases. That doesn’t seem like it will be too hard. But he can’t get caught, not even once. Even if he steals nine consecutive bases, he can’t get caught later in the season to set the record.\n\nHe can get picked off, which doesn’t count as a caught stealing unless he breaks for the next base. We know that happened once where he was picked off and went towards second, but in that case, Crow-Armstrong was able to get back to first safely.\n\nThanks for stopping by this evening and all week. We’ve enjoyed having you. We hope you’ll come back and tell your friends. Get home safely. Tip your waitstaff. And join us again next week for more BCB After Dark."
