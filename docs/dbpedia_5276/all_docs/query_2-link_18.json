        "text": "The 11th Annual Easterseals Disability Film Challenge Awards announced its winners at the Sony Pictures Studios lot’s Cary Grant Theater on Thursday, celebrating creatives with disabilities and envisioning a future where film and TV representation hits more than 1%.\n\nFor this year’s challenge, filmmakers were tasked with crafting short films based on the Buddy Comedy genre in just five days, start to finish. Of the 135 submissions, six winners were chosen. Hosted by founder and actor Nic Novicki, the event also named the organization’s 12 grant recipients.\n\nDespite people with disabilities making up a quarter of the population, they represent only 1% of characters in film and TV. So it was a refreshing win for representation when all six winners at the Easterseals Disability Film Challenge Awards were themselves people with disabilities (To partake in the challenge, at least one person involved in the production must be a person with a disability, either on-camera or behind-the-scenes).\n\nThe evening included an accessible orange carpet, a film-themed photo op, a trio of popcorn flavors in novelty tubs, seconds-worthy Greek food catered by Wolfgang Puck and multiple ASL interpreters. Throughout the night, presenters and winners also described their physical attributes to assist any attendees with vision impairment or low vision.\n\nCelebrity presenters included Jillian Mercado, Peter Farrelly, Rick Glassman, Caterina Scorsone, Sheaun McKinney, Heather Morris, “CODA” filmmaker Siân Heder and Nate Bargatze, virtually.\n\nFor those who were unable to attend in person, the awards fête, which was preceded by a 5:30 p.m. reception ahead of the two-hour ceremony at 7 p.m., was livestreamed with the help of Microsoft Teams. Sony, Netflix, IMDbPro, Amazon MGM, NBCUniversal and Adobe were also among the annual event’s other sponsors.\n\nRead the complete list of nominees and winners from the 11th Annual Easterseals Disability Film Challenge Awards, below:\n\nBest Actor\n\nKiersten Kelly, “Emergency Contact” (WINNER)\n\nBrett Maline, “Wrong Guy”\n\nHarold Foxx, “Open to Interpretation”\n\nVincent Rutley, “Step Buddies”\n\nBest Awareness Campaign\n\nSawsan Zakaria, “Out of Reach” (WINNER)\n\nJudith Rubin, “CARPS”\n\nZach Anner, “Wheelchair Club”\n\nAnna Pakman, “Wheelchair Money”\n\nBest Director\n\nChase Chambers, “The Case of the Obsidian Muskrat” (WINNER)\n\nLuke J.
