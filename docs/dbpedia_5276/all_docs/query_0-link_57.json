Each delivery of a newspaper or periodical pursuant to a subscription sale is a separate sale transaction. When the sale is subject to tax, the retailer must report and pay the tax based upon the reporting period within which the delivery is made. The subscription price shall be prorated over the term of the subscription period.\n\n(4) Membership Organizations. Generally, tax applies to sales of newspapers and periodicals by membership organizations. If the price is separately stated, tax applies to that amount. If the price is not separately stated, the measure of tax is the fair retail selling price of the publication.\n\nThe application of tax to distributions of newspapers and periodicals by nonprofit organizations is provided in subdivision (b)(5). The application of tax to sales of periodicals by subscription is provided in subdivision (b)(3).\n\n(5) Nonprofit Organizations.\n\n(A) Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) Organizations. Tax does not apply to the sale or use of any newspaper or periodical distributed by an organization that qualifies for tax exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, nor tangible personal property which becomes an ingredient or component part of any such newspaper or periodical regularly issued at average intervals not exceeding three months and distributed under either of the following circumstances:\n\n1. The issues are distributed to the organization's members in consideration of the organization's membership fee; or\n\n2. The issues are of a newspaper or periodical which neither receives revenue from, nor accepts, any commercial advertising.\n\nFor purposes of this subdivision, any governmental entity established and administered for the purposes provided in Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3) shall be considered to be an organization that qualifies for tax exempt status under that section.\n\n(B) Other Nonprofit Organizations. Tax does not apply to the sale or use of any newspaper or periodical regularly issued at average intervals not exceeding three months and distributed by a nonprofit organization, nor tangible personal property that becomes an ingredient or component part of any such newspaper or periodical, only as to issues distributed pursuant to both of the following requirements:\n\n1. The issues are distributed to the organization's members in consideration, in whole, or in part, of the organization's membership fee;\n\n2. The amount paid or incurred by the nonprofit organization for the cost of printing the newspaper or periodical is less than ten percent of the membership fee attributable to the period for which the newspaper or periodical is distributed, whether the publication is printed within or without this state. The cost of printing shall be determined as follows.\n\nThe cost of printing includes costs of tangible personal property purchased to become an ingredient or component part of the newspaper or periodical (e.g., ink and paper) and costs of labor to print the newspaper or periodical. The cost of printing does not include costs not attributable to actual printing, such as costs of special printing aids, typography, and preparation of layouts.\n\nIf the organization contracts with an outside printer to print the newspaper or periodical, the organization shall obtain and retain documentation segregating the costs of printing from the printer's other charges.\n\nIf the organization is the printer of the newspaper or periodical, the cost of printing includes the aggregate of the cost of tangible personal property purchased to become an ingredient or component part of the newspaper or periodical; labor of printing, including fringe benefits and payroll taxes; and other costs attributable to the actual printing of the newspaper or periodical.\n\nIf an organization has published the newspaper or periodical for a period exceeding twelve months and the method of printing has not changed, the organization may elect to consider the cost of printing for a reporting period to be equal to the amount paid or incurred for the same reporting period for the previous fiscal or calendar year.\n\n(6) Newspaper Carriers. A newspaper carrier is not a retailer. The publisher or distributor for whom the carrier delivers is the retailer of the newspapers delivered. The publisher or distributor shall report and pay tax measured by the price charged to the customer by the carrier.\n\n(7) Consumption of Property. Tax applies to the sale to or use by a newspaper or periodical publisher of tangible personal property consumed in the manufacturing process. Tax does not apply to the cost of tangible personal property lost or wasted in the manufacturing process when that property was purchased for the purpose of incorporation into a newspaper or periodical to be sold or to be distributed in accordance with subdivision (b)(2).\n\n(8) School Catalogs and Yearbooks. Public or private schools, county offices of education, school districts, or student organizations are the consumers of catalogs and yearbooks prepared for or by them, and tax does not apply to their receipts from the distribution of the publications to students.\n\nTax applies to charges for the preparation of such publications made to public or private schools, county offices of education, school districts, or student organizations by printers, engravers, photographers and the like.\n\n(c) Exemption Certificates. Any seller claiming a transaction as exempt from sales tax pursuant to Revenue and Taxation Code sections 6362.7 or 6362.8 should timely obtain in goo faith an exemption certificate in writing from the purchaser. The exemption certificate will be considered timely if obtained by the seller at any time before the seller bills the purchaser for the property, or any time within the seller's normal billing and payment cycle, or any time at or prior to delivery of the property.\n\n(1) Certificate A. Certificate to be used for purchases of tangible personal property for incorporation into newspapers or periodicals for sale in accordance with subdivisions (b)(1) or (b)(3), above.\n\n(2) Certificate B.

For purposes of this regulation only, prosthetic devices also include needles, syringes, cannulas, bags, and tubing, as well as filters, locks, tape, clamps, and connectors which are integral to the tubing, each of which is used to dispense TPN or IDPN to the patient, provided each of these items is used primarily to dispense the TPN or IDPN.\n\nProsthetic devices that are considered medicines when worn on or in the patient include, but are not limited to, acetabular cups, atrial valves, cervical cuff, dacron grafts, heart valves, breast tissue expanders and tissue expanders, orbital implant, nerve cups, rhinoplasty prosthesis, neuromuscular electrical stimulators, transcutaneous nerve stimulators, urinary incontinent devices, and wigs and hairpieces prescribed by a physician or podiatrist.\n\nProsthetic devices that do not qualify as \"medicines\" include, but are not limited to, air compression pumps and pneumatic garments; noninvasive, temporary pace makers; vacuum/constriction devices used to treat male impotency; auditory, ophthalmic and ocular devices or appliances; and dental prosthetic devices and materials such as dentures, removable or fixed bridges, crowns, caps, inlays, artificial teeth, and other dental prosthetic materials and devices. Sales of such items are subject to tax in the same manner as any other sale of tangible personal property.\n\n(6) Drug Infusion Devices. Programmable drug infusion devices worn on or implanted in the human body which automatically cause the infusion of measured quantities of a drug on an intermittent or continuous basis at variable dose rates and at high or low fluid volume into the body of the wearer of the device qualify as medicines under Revenue and Taxation Code section 6369(c)(6). The sale or use of the qualifying infusion device is not subject to tax when the device is sold or furnished under one of the conditions provided in subdivision (d)(1) through (d)(6).\n\n(c) Exclusions from the Definition of \"Medicines\". Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b), the following items are specifically excluded from the definition of medicines. Sales of these items are subject to tax in the same manner as any other sale of tangible personal property.\n\n(1) Orthodontic, prosthetic (except as described in subdivision (b)(5)), auditory, ophthalmic or ocular devices or appliances.\n\n(2) Articles which are in the nature of splints, bandages, pads, compresses, supports, dressings, instruments, apparatus, contrivances, appliances, devices or other mechanical, electronic, optical or physical equipment or article or the component parts and accessories thereof. \"Medicines\" does not include arch supports, cervical pillows, exercise weights (boots or belts), hospital beds, orthopedic shoes and supportive devices (unless an integral part of a leg brace or artificial leg), plastazote inserts, plastazote shoes, plastic shoes (custom or ready-made), sacro-ease seats, shoe modifications, spenco inserts, traction units (other than those fully worn on the patient), thermophore pads, or foot orthoses.\n\n(3) Any alcoholic beverage the manufacture, sale, purchase, possession or transportation of which is licensed and regulated by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act (Division 9, commencing with section 23000, of the Business and Professions Code).\n\n(d) Application of Tax—In General. Tax applies to retail sales, including over-the-counter sales of drugs and medicines, and other tangible personal property by pharmacists and others. However, tax does not apply to the sale or use of medicines when sold or furnished under one of the following conditions:\n\n(1) prescribed for the treatment of a human being by a person authorized to prescribe the medicines, and dispensed on prescription filled by a pharmacist in accordance with law, or\n\n(2) furnished by a licensed physician, dentist or podiatrist to his or her own patient for treatment of the patient, or\n\n(3) furnished by a health facility for treatment of any person pursuant to the order of a licensed physician, dentist or podiatrist, or\n\n(4) sold to a licensed physician, dentist, podiatrist or health facility for the treatment of a human being, or\n\n(5) sold to this state or any political subdivision or municipal corporation thereof, for use in the treatment of a human being; or furnished for the treatment of a human being by a medical facility or clinic maintained by this state or any political subdivision or municipal corporation thereof, or\n\n(6) effective January 1, 1995, furnished by a pharmaceutical manufacturer or distributor without charge to a licensed physician, surgeon, dentist, podiatrist, or health facility for the treatment of a human being, or to an institution of higher education for instruction or research. Such medicine must be of a type that can be dispensed only: (a) for the treatment of a human being, and (b) pursuant to prescriptions issued by persons authorized to prescribe medicines. The exemption provided by this subdivision applies to the constituent elements and ingredients used to produce the medicines and to the tangible personal property used to package such medicines.\n\n(e) Specific Tax Applications.\n\n(1) Prescriptions. No person other than a licensed physician, dentist, optometrist or podiatrist is authorized to prescribe or write a prescription for the treatment of a human being. Tax does not apply to the sale or use of medicines prescribed by a licensed physician, dentist, optometrist, or podiatrist for the treatment of a human being and dispensed on prescription filled by a pharmacist.\n\n(2) Licensed Physician, Dentist or Podiatrist. Tax does not apply to a specific charge made by a licensed physician, dentist or podiatrist to his or her own patient for medicines furnished for the treatment of the patient. Tax also does not apply to sales of medicines to licensed physicians, dentists or podiatrists for the treatment of a human being regardless of whether the licensed physician, dentist or podiatrist makes a specific charge to his or her patient for the medicines furnished.\n\n(3) Health Facility. Tax does not apply to sales of medicines by a health facility (as defined in subdivision (a)(4)) for the treatment of any person pursuant to the order of a licensed physician, dentist or podiatrist. Tax does not apply to sales of medicines to a health facility for the treatment of a human being regardless of whether or not a specific charge is made for the medicines.\n\n(4) Pharmaceutical Manufacturer or Distributor. Tax does not apply to the storage, use or consumption of medicines furnished by a pharmaceutical manufacturer or distributor without charge to a licensed physician, surgeon, dentist, podiatrist, or health facility for the treatment of a human being or furnished without charge to an institution of higher education for instruction or research provided the medicines furnished are of a type that can be dispensed only (1) on prescription by persons authorized to prescribe and (2) for the treatment of a human being. The exemption from tax includes the costs of the materials used to package the \"sample\" medicines, such as bottles, boxes, blister packs, patches impregnated with medicines, or pre-filled syringes, and the elements and ingredients used to produce the \"samples\" whether or not such items are purchased under a resale certificate in this state or outside this state. When a pre-filled syringe or other such delivery device is used to package and contain a sample medicine (i.e., pre-filled with the medicine) as well as to inject or otherwise administer the medicine to the patient, the exemption from tax will not be lost due to the fact that the device is used for a dual purpose. However, the use of empty syringes or other such delivery devices, furnished to the licensed physician separately or included in the packages with the medicines, is subject to tax.\n\nThis exemption applies in the same manner to the use of clinical trial medicines during the United States Food and Drug Administration's drug development and approval process. \"Clinical trial medicines\" are substances or preparations approved as \"Investigational New Drugs\" by the United States Food and Drug Administration intended for treatment of, and application to, the human body, which are furnished by a pharmaceutical developer, manufacturer, or distributor to a licensed physician and subsequently dispensed, furnished, or administered pursuant to the order of the licensed physician. \"Clinical trial medicines\" do not include placebos. Placebos are not used for the treatment of a human being and, as such, do not qualify for the exemption provided under this subdivision. Thus, the use of placebos is subject to tax.\n\n(5) Antimicrobial Agents Used by Hospital Personnel. Tax does not apply to the sale or use of substances or preparations, such as antiseptic cleansers or scrubs, when such substances or preparations qualify as medicines and are used by hospital personnel on the patient or by hospital personnel on their own bodies to benefit the patient, and which constitute a critical component of the patient's treatment. Qualifying medicines used on the bodies of hospital personnel include antimicrobial agents used for preoperative scrubbing or hand cleansing prior to any patient contact such as Accent Plus Skin Cleanser; Accent Plus Perinal Cleanser; Bacti-Stat; Betadine; and Medi-Scrub. However, antimicrobial agents such as Accent Plus 1 Skin Lotion; Accent Plus 2 Body Massage; Accent Plus 2 Skin Crème; and Accent Plus Total Body Shampoo applied to the body of hospital personnel are not considered used in the treatment of the patient and the sale or use of these products is subject to tax.\n\n(6) Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs, and Other Such Supplements. In general, sales of vitamins, minerals, herbs and other such supplements are subject to tax. However, when vitamins, minerals, herbs and other such supplements are used in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, and are commonly recognized as a substance or preparation intended for such use, they will qualify as medicines for the purposes of Revenue and Taxation Code section 6369. As such, their sale or use is not subject to tax when sold or furnished under one of the conditions in subdivision (d)(1) through (d)(6).\n\n(7) Dietary Supplements and Adjuncts. Dietary supplements and adjuncts furnished to a patient as part of a medically supervised weight loss program to treat obesity qualify as medicines for the purposes of Revenue and Taxation Code section 6369 when the product does not otherwise qualify as a food product under Regulation 1602. The sale or use of such products is not subject to tax when sold or furnished under one of the conditions in subdivision (d)(1) through (d)(6) .\n\n(8) Diagnostic Substances, Test Kits, and Equipment. Tax applies to the sale or use of diagnostic substances applied to samples of cells, tissues, organs, or bodily fluids and waste after such samples have been removed, withdrawn, or eliminated from the human body. Diagnostic substances are applied to the samples outside the living body (\"in vitro\") in an artificial environment. They are not administered in the living body (\"in vivo\"). As the substances are not applied internally or externally to the body of the patient, they do not qualify as medicines under Revenue and Taxation Code section 6369.\n\nExcept as provided in Regulation 1591.1(b)(4), tax applies to the sale or use of test kits and equipment used to analyze, monitor, or test samples of cells, tissues, organs and blood, saliva, or other bodily fluids. Such items do not qualify as medicines regardless of whether they are prescribed for an individual by a person authorized to prescribe and dispensed pursuant to a prescription.\n\n(f) Insurance Payments.\n\n(1) Medical Insurance and Medi-Cal. The exemption of retail sales of medicines is not affected by the fact that charges to the person for whom the medicine is furnished may be paid, in whole or in part, by an insurer. This is so even though a joint billing may be made by the retailer in the name of both the person and the insurer.\n\n(2) Medicare.\n\n(A) Medicare Part A. Tax does not apply to the sale of items to a person insured pursuant to Part A of the Medicare Act as such sales are considered exempt sales to the United States Government. Under Part A, the healthcare provider has a contract with the United States Government to provide certain services. Therefore, to the extent allowed pursuant to Regulation 1503, sales of medicines, devices, appliances, and supplies in which payment is made under Part A qualify as exempt sales to the United States Government.\n\n(B) Medicare Part B. Tax applies to sales of items to a person in which payment is made pursuant to Part B of the Medicare Act. Sales made under Part B do not qualify as exempt sales to the United States Government even though the patient may assign the claim for reimbursement to the seller and payment is made by a carrier administering Medicare claims under contract with the United States Government. Under Part B, the seller does not have a contract with the United States Government. The contract is between the patient and the United States Government. Unless the sale is otherwise exempt (such as a sale of a medicine under suddivision (d)), the sale is subject to tax.\n\n(3) Employer Medical Contracts. Certain employers have contracted with their employees to provide the latter with medical, surgical, and hospital benefits in a hospital operated by or under contract with the employer for a fixed charge. Usually the charge is by payroll deduction. These contracts are not insurance plans; rather, they are agreements to furnish specified benefits under stated conditions, one of which may be that no charge is to be made to the employee for prescribed medicines. The agreements may provide for making a charge for medicines furnished to out-patients but not to in-patients. This in no way affects the exemption of sales of medicines.\n\n(g) Records. Any pharmacy whether in a health facility or not must keep records in support of all deductions claimed on account of medicines. Section 4081 of the Business and Professions Code requires that all prescriptions filled shall be kept on file and open for inspection by duly constituted authorities.\n\nPursuant to section 4081 of the Business and Professions Code, physicians and surgeons and podiatrists must keep accurate records of drugs furnished by them. Any deduction on account of sales of medicines shall be supported by appropriate records.\n\n(1) The following written information constitutes acceptable documentation for retailers in those cases where sales are made of supplies which are \"deemed to be dispensed on prescription\" within the meaning of section 6369:\n\nName of purchaser\n\nName of doctor\n\nDate of sale\n\nItem sold\n\nThe sale price\n\n(2) \"Double Deduction\" Unauthorized. The law does not, of course, permit a double deduction for sales of exempt medicines. For example, if an exemption is claimed on account of a sale of a prescription medicine, no additional deduction for the same sale may be taken as a sale to the United States Government under the Medicare Program.\n\n(3) Persons making purchases of items in which their sale or use is exempt under this regulation should give their suppliers an exemption certificate pursuant to Regulation 1667.\n\nHistory—Effective January 1, 1962.\n\nAmended May 16, 1962.\n\nAmended September 18, 1963, effective as amended September 20, 1963.\n\nAmended and renumbered December 10, 1969, effective January 11, 1970.\n\nAmended May 4, 1971, effective July 1, 1971.\n\nAmended September 14, 1972, effective September 15, 1972.\n\nAmended January 18, 1973, effective January 26, 1973.\n\nAmended October 20, 1977, effective October 28, 1977.

A place, establishment, or institution which solely provides advice, counseling, information, or referrals on the maintenance of health or on the means and measures to prevent or avoid sickness, disease, or injury, where such advice, counseling, information, or referrals does not constitute the practice of medicine, surgery, dentistry, optometry, or podiatry, shall not be deemed a clinic for purposes of this subdivision.\n\n(C) Section 1200.1 of the Health and Safety Code provides that \"clinic\" also means an organized outpatient health facility which provides direct psychological advice, services, or treatment to patients who remain less than 24 hours. As provided in section 1204.1 of the Health and Safety Code, such clinics serve patients under the direction of a clinical psychologist as defined in section 1316.5 of the Health and Safety Code, and are operated by a nonprofit corporation, which is exempt from federal taxation under paragraph (3), subsection (c) of section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, or a statutory successor thereof, and which is supported and maintained in whole or in part by donations, bequests, gifts, grants, government funds, or contributions which may be in the form of money, goods, or services. In such clinics, any charges to the patient shall be based on the patient's ability to pay, utilizing a sliding fee scale. Such clinics may also provide diagnostic or therapeutic services authorized under Chapter 6.6 (commencing with section 2900) of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code to patients in the home as an incident to care provided at the clinic facility.\n\n(b) Tax Application. Tax does not apply to the sale or use, including leases that are continuing sales and purchases, of wheelchairs; crutches; canes; quad canes; white canes used by the legally blind; walkers; and replacement parts for these devices when sold to an individual for the personal use of that individual as directed by a licensed physician. Electric three-wheel scooters that are similar in both design and function to a conventional electric wheelchair, qualify as a wheelchair for the purposes of Revenue and Taxation Code section 6369.2. When the scooters are sold or leased to an individual for the personal use of that individual as directed by a licensed physician their sale or use qualifies for an exemption from tax.\n\n\"Replacement parts\" include, but are not limited to, batteries for electric wheelchairs; belts and cushions sold to replace or supplement the basic items originally sold with wheelchairs, lap boards and trays attached to wheelchairs and considered a part of the wheelchair; and rubber tips, wheels, and other such items prescribed for an individual to replace an original component of the device sold. \"Replacement parts\" do not include items such as mechanical devices that aid the patient in eating or writing unless the items are part of the device itself, or restraints or other such items sold to an individual, but which do not become a part of the wheelchair or other such prescribed device.\n\n(c) Sales to Health Facilities. Sales, or leases that are continuing sales and purchases, of wheelchairs, crutches, canes, and walkers to hospitals or other health facilities for use by patients while at the facilities are subject to tax. Such sales or leases are not considered sold to an individual for the individual's personal use as directed by a physician. However, when wheelchairs, crutches, canes, and walkers are ordered by a hospital or health facility on behalf of a specific patient, as directed by a physician, the items may be considered to be purchased by an individual for his or her own personal use as required under Revenue and Taxation Code section 6369.2 and, therefore, the sale will qualify for exemption from tax.\n\n(d) Sales to Insured Persons. The exemption for qualifying retail sales of wheelchairs, crutches, canes, quad canes, white canes used by the legally blind, walkers, and replacement parts for these devices is not affected by the fact that charges to the individual to whom such items are sold, may be paid, in whole or in part, by an insurer. This is so even though a joint billing may be made by the retailer in the name of both the person and the insurer.\n\nHistory—Promulgated November 18, 1999, effective March 10, 2000.\n\nAmended December 12, 2006, effective July 30, 2007.

Tax does not apply whether the property is installed by the retailer or is sold for installation by other persons. However, sales or purchases of tools and supplies used in modifying the vehicle and which are not incorporated into, attached to, or installed on the vehicle are subject to tax.\n\nItems and materials considered necessary to enable a vehicle to be used to transport a physically handicapped person include, but are not limited to, an interlock system; upper torso restraint; an airbag of a unique type to raise or lower the vehicle for loading or unloading; running boards on lower side of vehicle; a bolt cam used to restrain a wheelchair inside a van; seat belts; a tire carrier to hold a spare and which is installed within reach of a handicapped person; AC lights to illuminate the ramp or elevator area; hardware for privacy curtains; air compressor for use with medical equipment; a 12-volt receptacle to supply power to medical equipment; a 4-point tie down system to restrain a wheelchair; and an allocable portion(s) of the various interior packages, interior materials, and conversions necessary to modify the vehicle for transport of physically handicapped persons.\n\nItems and materials that are generally not considered necessary to enable a vehicle to be used to transport a physically handicapped person include, but are not limited to, an upper torso durable pad (unless part of the restraint); portable ramps (telescopic); air conditioners (unless necessary for the transport of certain types of disabled persons); a fire extinguisher; a CB radio (unless shown to be necessary to the transport of certain types of disabled persons); leather seat covers; extra windows and their accessories; upgrades to the interior (upgrade to leather seats); and an engine cover.

Medical Oxygen Delivery Systems.\n\nReference: Sections 6006, 6369, and 6369.5, Revenue and Taxation Code, and Sections 1200, 1200.1, 1204.1, and 1250, Health and Safety Code.\n\n(a) Definitions.\n\n(1) Physician. \"Physicians\" are persons authorized by a currently valid and unrevoked license to practice their respective professions in this state. \"Physician\" means and includes any person holding a valid and unrevoked physician's and surgeon's certificate or certificate to practice medicine and surgery, issued by the Medical Board of California or the Osteopathic Medical Board of California and includes an unlicensed person lawfully practicing medicine pursuant to section 2065 of the Business and Professions Code, when acting within the scope of that section.\n\n(2) Prescription. \"Prescription\" means an oral, written, or electronic transmission order that is issued by a physician, dentist, optometrist, or podiatrist licensed in this state and given individually for the person or persons for whom ordered.

A place, establishment, or institution which solely provides advice, counseling, information, or referrals on the maintenance of health or on the means and measures to prevent or avoid sickness, disease, or injury, where such advice, counseling, information, or referrals does not constitute the practice of medicine, surgery, dentistry, optometry, or podiatry, shall not be deemed a clinic for purposes of this subdivision.\n\n(C) Section 1200.1 of the Health and Safety Code provides that \"clinic\" also means an organized outpatient health facility which provides direct psychological advice, services, or treatment to patients who remain less than 24 hours. As provided in section 1204.1 of the Health and Safety Code, such clinics serve patients under the direction of a clinical psychologist as defined in section 1316.5 of the Health and Safety Code, and are operated by a nonprofit corporation, which is exempt from federal taxation under paragraph (3), subsection (c) of section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, or a statutory successor thereof, and which is supported and maintained in whole or in part by donations, bequests, gifts, grants, government funds, or contributions which may be in the form of money, goods, or services. In such clinics, any charges to the patient shall be based on the patient's ability to pay, utilizing a sliding fee scale. Such clinics may also provide diagnostic or therapeutic services authorized under Chapter 6.6 (commencing with section 2900) of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code to patients in the home as an incident to care provided at the clinic facility.\n\n(4) Medical Oxygen Delivery System. A system used to administer oxygen directly into the lungs of the patient for the relief of conditions in which the human body experiences an abnormal deficiency or inadequate supply of oxygen. Devices that only assist the patient in breathing, but do not deliver air or oxygen directly into the lungs of the patient, do not qualify as medical oxygen delivery systems.\n\n(b) Tax Application.\n\n(1) Medical Oxygen Delivery Systems. Tax does not apply to the sale or use of medical oxygen delivery systems when sold, leased or rented to an individual for the personal use of that individual as directed by a licensed physician.\n\nMedical oxygen delivery systems include, but are not limited to, liquid oxygen containers, high-pressure cylinders, regulators, oxygen concentrators, tubes, masks and related items necessary for the delivery of oxygen to the patient. The term also includes repair and replacement parts for use in such a system.\n\n(2) Ventilators and Other Respiratory Equipment. For the purposes of this regulation, ventilators that produce a form of controlled respiration in which compressed air is delivered under positive pressure into the patient's airways qualify for the exemption provided under section 6369.5 for medical oxygen delivery systems. Pressure ventilators and volume ventilators provide assisted respiration and intensive positive pressure in which compressed air, a component of which is oxygen, is administered into the breathing systems of patients to help them breathe. The sale or use of ventilators, as described, is exempt from tax when sold or leased to an individual for the personal use of that individual as directed by a physician.\n\nRespiratory equipment that induces air into the lungs of a patient, through the application of pressure to the chest area, also qualifies for the exemption provided for medical oxygen delivery systems, regardless of whether the pressure applied is negative pressure or positive pressure. The sale or use of respiratory equipment, as described, is exempt from tax when sold or leased to an individual for the personal use of that individual as directed by a physician. Included within the scope of the exemption are exsufflation belts, iron lungs, chest shells, pulmo wraps, and the pumps and regulators necessary for the operation of the listed equipment.\n\n(c) Sales to Health Facilities and Health Care Providers. Sales of medical oxygen delivery systems are exempt when sold to an individual for his or her own use under the direction of a licensed physician. Sales of medical oxygen delivery systems to hospitals, immediate care facilities, physicians, or other health care providers for use on their premises are subject to tax in the same manner as other sales of tangible personal property.\n\nA rental or lease of a medical oxygen delivery system to a health facility qualifies for an exemption from tax when the facility intends to lease or rent the system to an individual for the personal use of that individual as directed by a licensed physician and the system is then leased or rented as intended. However, the transaction between the health facility and the individual must constitute an actual lease or rental. When the patient's use of the medical delivery system is limited to the health facility's premises, the direction and control of the equipment does not transfer to the patient. Therefore, an actual lease or rental of the system to the patient does not occur even when a separate billing is made to the patient for the use of the system. As such, the lease or rental of the system to the health facility does not qualify for the exemption provided under section 6369.5.\n\n(d) Sales of Medical Oxygen. Medical oxygen and other gases sold to a licensed physician and surgeon, podiatrist, dentist, or health facility for treatment of human beings are considered medicines. Therefore, their sale or use is not subject to tax when (1) furnished by a licensed physician and surgeon, podiatrist, or dentist to his or her own patient or (2) furnished by the health facility pursuant to the order of a licensed physician and surgeon, dentist, or podiatrist.\n\nMedical oxygen sold by distributors of compressed gases to an individual for use as part of the individual's treatment, pursuant to a physician's prescription, is regarded as a medicine furnished by a licensed physician to his or her own patient for treatment of the patient as provided by Regulation 1591(b)(2). Sales of medical oxygen to individuals under the \"Casey Bill\" (i.e., the retailer bills the service acting as a fiscal agent for the State of California) are regarded as sales of medicines to this State for use in the treatment of human beings as provided by Regulation 1591(b)(5). Therefore, sales of medical oxygen by distributors, under these conditions, are not subject to tax whether or not the distributor is a medical supply house.\n\n(e) Sales to Insured Persons. The exemption for qualifying retail sales of oxygen delivery systems and replacement parts is not affected by the fact that charges to the individual for whom such items are sold, leased, or rented may be paid, in whole or in part, by an insurer. This is so even though a joint billing may be made by the retailer in the name of both the person and the insurer.\n\nHistory—Promulgated November 18, 1999, effective March 10, 2000.\n\nAmended December 12, 2006, effective July 30, 2007.

When an optometrist fills a prescription prepared by another optometrist or by a physician and surgeon, the optometrist who fills the prescription is the consumer of the glasses, frames, and other materials and tax applies with respect to the sale of such materials to him/her.\n\n(3) Replacement Lenses and Frames. A physician and surgeon or optometrist is also the consumer of lenses and frames furnished to patients as duplications or replacements of parts of eyeglasses or contact lenses which were previously prescribed for the patient pursuant to an eye examination, and tax applies to the sale thereof to him/her.\n\n(4) Plano Lenses or Sunglasses (Without Correction).\n\nWhen plano lenses and frames or plano sunglasses, including clip-on sunglasses, are furnished by a physician and surgeon or optometrist pursuant to a prescription for a particular class of plano or for the treatment or correction of conditions of the human eye following, and as a result of, a diagnosis made by him/her in an examination and refraction he/she is the consumer of the plano lenses and frames or sunglasses and tax applies with respect to the sale thereof to him/her.

A registered dispensing optician is the consumer of ophthalmic materials including eyeglasses, frames, and lenses dispensed pursuant to a prescription prepared by a physician and surgeon or optometrist.

Operative January 1, 1998, a licensed pharmacist is the consumer of replacement contact lenses dispensed pursuant to a prescription prepared by a physician or optometrist. Tax applies with respect to the sale of such contact lenses to the pharmacist.\n\n(2) Replacement Contact Lenses. For purposes of this subdivision, \"replacement contact lenses\" means soft contact lenses that require no fitting or adjustment, and that are dispensed as packaged and sealed by the manufacturer.\n\n(d) Definition of Prescription. For the purposes of this regulation a \"prescription\" means a written formula for ophthalmic lenses or contact lenses prepared by a physician and surgeon or optometrist.\n\nWith respect to plano lenses and frames or sunglasses without correction, prescription means a written order for a distinctive type or class of plano identified by numbers or symbols descriptive of a specific tint, color or characteristic.\n\nThe prescription shall bear the name and address of the prescriber, the name and address of the patient, and the date of issue.\n\nPursuant to section 4124 of the Business and Professions Code, with respect to replacement contact lenses dispensed under subdivision (c) above, in addition to the above requirements, operative January 1, 1998, a prescription must:\n\n(1) Include the state license number of the prescribing practitioner,\n\n(2) Explicitly state an expiration date of not more than one year from the date of the last prescribing examination, and\n\n(3) Explicitly state that the prescription is for contact lenses and include the lens brand name, type, and tint, including all specifications necessary for the ordering of lenses.\n\nHistory—Section (a)(1) effective September 19, 1947.\n\nSection (b) effective August 1, 1933.\n\nAdopted as of January 1, 1945 as a restatement of previous rulings.\n\nAmended and renumbered March 24, 1970, effective April 29, 1970.\n\nAmended May 4, 1971, effective July 1, 1971.\n\nAmended March 25, 1998, effective April 24, 1998.

Aircraft and Aircraft Parts.\n\nReference: Sections 6091, 6366, 6366.1, and 6421, Revenue and Taxation Code.\n\n(a) Definitions.\n\n(1) \"Aircraft.\" As used herein, the term \"aircraft\" means any contrivance designed for powered navigation in the air except a rocket or missile.\n\n(2) \"Common Carrier.\" As used herein, the term \"common carrier\" means any person who engages in the business of transporting persons or property for hire or compensation and who offers his or her services indiscriminately to the public or to some portion of the public.\n\n(3) \"Component Part.\" As used in subdivision (b)(2), the term \"component part\" means an item incorporated by securing to the aircraft in compliance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements, or United States military equivalent, related to the maintenance, repair, overhaul, or improvement of the aircraft which part is essentially associated with the functional aspects of the aircraft, including those related to safety and air worthiness.\n\n(A) Examples of property which are component parts are engines, passenger seats, and landing gear; items replaced, repaired, or overhauled according to manufacturer service bulletins; items required by air worthiness directives issued by the FAA; life limited parts; and cargo and baggage containers which are designed to be secured, and which are secured, to the aircraft during flight.\n\n(B) Examples of property which are not component parts are general expense items or comfort-related items such as attendant carts, blankets, pillows, or serving utensils.\n\n(b) Application of Tax.\n\n(1) Aircraft. Tax does not apply to the sale of and the storage, use, or other consumption of aircraft sold, leased, or sold to persons for the purpose of leasing, to:\n\n(A) a person who operates the aircraft as a common carrier of persons or property, provided:\n\n1. the person operates the aircraft under authority of the laws of this state, of the United States, or of any foreign government, and\n\n2. the person's use of the aircraft as a common carrier is authorized or permitted by the person's governmental authority to operate the aircraft;\n\n(B) foreign government for use of the aircraft by that government outside of California; or,\n\n(C) a nonresident of California who will not use the aircraft in this state other than to remove the aircraft from California.\n\n(2) Aircraft Parts.\n\n(A) When tangible personal property becomes a component part of an aircraft described in subdivision (b)(1) as a result of the maintenance, repair, overhaul, or improvement of that aircraft in compliance with FAA requirements, or United States military equivalent, the charges for such tangible personal property, as well as for labor and services rendered with respect to that maintenance, repair, overhaul, or improvement are exempt from tax provided the aircraft will continue to be used in a manner described in subdivision (b)(1).\n\n(B) The exemption described in subdivision (b)(2)(A) applies with respect to tangible personal property purchased and placed in inventory with the intent to thereafter remove the property from inventory and incorporate it as a component part of an aircraft under the conditions specified in subdivision (b)(2)(A), provided the property is so incorporated into a qualifying aircraft.

In determining whether a purchaser or lessee of an aircraft is using that aircraft as a common carrier of persons or property, only that use of the aircraft by the carrier during the first 12 consecutive months commencing with the first operational use of the aircraft will be considered. This test period does not include, and is extended by, the amount of time, prior to the first use of the aircraft as a common carrier, during which the aircraft is in the physical possession of a repair station certified by the FAA or a manufacturer's maintenance facility undergoing modification, repair, or replacement. The period of this extension/exclusion shall not exceed 12 months.

Operational use includes positioning or repositioning aircraft by flying the aircraft from one point to another (\"ferry flights\") except when such flights are solely for purposes of having the aircraft repaired. Ferry flights solely for the purpose of transporting the aircraft to a repair location, or solely to return from a repair location, are not operational use, nor are test flights as described in subdivision (d)(2) or personnel training as described in subdivision (d)(4).\n\n(B) If the aircraft is used as a common carrier for more than one-half of the operational use during the test period the carrier's principal use of the aircraft will be deemed to be that of a common carrier except as provided in subdivisions (c)(1)(D) and (c)(1)(E). Each flight of the aircraft is examined separately for purposes of determining common carrier use. For these purposes, a flight is the powered navigation of the aircraft from one location on the ground or water to the first point on the ground or water at which the aircraft lands.\n\n(C) A flight qualifies as a common carrier use of the aircraft for purposes of the exemption only if the flight is authorized or permitted by the governmental authority under which the aircraft"
