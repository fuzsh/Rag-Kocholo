        "text": "Tax Credits, Deductions and Subtractions for\n\nIndividual Taxpayers\n\nYou may be eligible to claim some valuable personal income tax credits available on your Maryland tax return.\n\nThe following list contains general information about some of the most commonly used credits. You may want to consult with a tax professional to review specific requirements. Some of these credits contain carryover or recapture provisions and, in some cases, you may have to seek certification from another state agency. For more information, see Form 502CR\n\nState Department of Assessments and Taxation Credits\n\nTax Credits for Homeowners and Renters\n\nThe Earned Income Tax Credit, also known as Earned Income Credit (EIC), is a benefit for working people with low to moderate income. If you qualify for the federal earned income tax credit and claim it on your federal return, you may be entitled to a Maryland earned income tax credit on the state return equal to 50% of the federal tax credit. The Maryland earned income tax credit (EITC) will either reduce or eliminate the amount of the state and local income tax that you owe.\n\nDetailed EITC guidance for Tax Year 2023, including annual income thresholds can be found here. If you are not certain if you qualify, both the Comptroller of Maryland and the Internal Revenue Service have electronic assistants that can help. By answering questions and providing basic income information, taxpayers can use the IRS EITC Assistant to:\n\nFind out if you are eligible for EITC;\n\nDetermine if your child or children meet the tests for a qualifying child; and\n\nEstimate the amount of your credit.\n\nUse the Comptroller of Maryland EITC Assistant to determine if you are eligible for the state Earned Income Tax Credit. The Assistant is available in English or en Español.\n\nThe IRS has the EITC Assistant in English version and a Versión en Español.\n\nBeginning in 2022, senior citizens are eligible for a new tax credit, among other benefits they can take advantage of. We have created a convenient tax tip detailing these opportunities. Additionally, seniors should consult our filing guidelines for seniors containing pertinent information and answers to your most frequently asked questions.\n\nA credit is allowed for cost of new aquaculture oyster floats that are designed to grow oysters at or under an individual homeowner's pier. The devices must be buoyant and assist in the growth of oysters for the width of the pier. The credit amount is limited to the lesser of the individual's state tax liability for that year or the maximum allowable credit of &dollar;500.\n\nIf the credit is more than the tax liability, the unused credit may not be carried forward to another tax year.\n\nTo claim the credit, you must complete Part D of Form 502CR and attach to your Maryland income tax return. You must also report the credit on Maryland Form 502, Form 505 or Form 515.\n\nThe First-Time Homebuyer Savings Account Subtraction may be claimed on Form 502SU by a Maryland resident who has not owned or purchased, either individually or jointly, a home in the State in the last 7 years and who has contributed money to a first-time homebuyer savings account.\n\nFor a period not to exceed 10 years, an account holder may claim a subtraction for up to &dollar;5,000 of the amount contributed by the account holder to their account during the taxable year for which the subtraction is claimed plus earnings for the taxable year, up to &dollar;50,000 of earnings accrued over the 10-year period. Funds must be used within 15 years following the date the account was established. Any funds in the account for which a subtraction was claimed and not expended on eligible costs by December 31 of the last year following the 15-year period is subject to taxation as ordinary income. Eligible costs are the down payment and allowable closing costs for the purchase of a home in the State by an account holder.\n\nAny account established with a financial institution can qualify as a \"first-time homebuyer savings account\" so long as the account is established for the sole purpose of paying or reimbursing eligible costs for the purchase of a home by the account holder in the state of Maryland. An account holder may not be the account holder of more than one account.\n\nIf the account holder withdraws any funds from the account for which a subtraction has been claimed for a purpose other than eligible costs for the purchase of a home, the funds are considered taxable ordinary income for the tax year in which they were withdrawn and the account holder must pay a penalty equal to 10% of the amount withdrawn. (For information on how to report this addition and penalty, refer to Instructions 12 and 22 in the Maryland Resident tax booklet.) There are three exceptions to this: rollover, bankruptcy, and administrative costs charged by the financial institution.\n\nRollover:\n\nAn account holder who withdraws money from the account and, within 60 days, deposits the money in a new first-time homebuyer savings account held by a different financial institution or the same financial institution is not subject to the tax and penalty.\n\nBankruptcy:\n\nA disbursement of any assets of a first-time homebuyer savings account under a filing by an account holder for protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§101—1330, does not subject the account holder to the tax and penalty associated with use of funds for purposes other than eligible costs.\n\nAdministrative Costs:\n\nA use of the account funds to pay a financial institution’s administrative costs is not considered a withdrawal from the account subject to tax and penalty if the administrative costs are disclosed by the financial institution, in writing, to the account holder at the time the account is opened and do not inure to the benefit of the account holder.\n\nAn account holder claiming a subtraction must file a list of transactions for the account during the taxable year with the income tax return on which the subtraction is claimed, and each subsequent year, whether or not the subtraction is claimed in each subsequent year, until the funds are used for eligible costs. Each spouse on a joint return who is the sole account holder of a first-time homebuyer savings account may claim up to the full amount of the subtraction. The amount claimed by each spouse is limited to their contributions to the account on which they are the account holder and earnings on the account on which they are the account holder.\n\nOn withdrawal of funds from the account to purchase a home, an account holder must submit to the Comptroller with their income tax return copies of statements provided by the account holder’s financial institution and the settlement statement related to the purchase of the home showing the eligible costs toward which the account funds were applied and a statement of the amount of funds remaining in the account, if any.\n\nIf you donated an easement to the Maryland Environmental Trust, the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation or the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to preserve open space, natural resources, agriculture, forest land, watersheds, significant ecosystems, view sheds or historic properties, you may be eligible for a tax credit.\n\nYou may be eligible for the credit if:\n\nthe easement is perpetual;\n\nthe easement is accepted and approved by the Board of Public Works; and\n\nthe fair market value of the property before and after the conveyance of the easement is substantiated by a certified real estate appraiser.\n\nThe credit is equal to the difference in the fair market values of the property reduced by payments received for the easement. The credit amount is limited to the lesser of the individual's state tax liability for that year of the maximum allowable credit of &dollar;5,000, per owner, who qualifies to claim the credit. The credit can be claimed on Maryland forms Form 502, Form 504, Form 505 or Form 515.\n\nIf the property is owned jointly by more than one individual such as a husband and wife, each individual owner is entitled to the credit based on their percentage of ownership. Individual members of a pass-through entity are not eligible for this credit.\n\nIn the case of a joint return, each spouse must calculate their own state tax liability for limitation purposes. Use the rules for filing separate returns in Instruction 8 of the Maryland resident tax booklet. In the case of a fiduciary return, the fiduciary will complete the column for Taxpayer B only.\n\nIf the individual's allowable credit amount exceeds the maximum of &dollar;5,000, the excess may be carried forward up to 15 years or until fully used. Complete lines 1-7 of Part F on Form 502CR. If you itemize deductions, see Instruction 14 in the Maryland resident tax booklet.\n\nFor additional information, contact the Maryland Environmental Trust at 410-514-7900, the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation at 410-841-5860, or the Department of Natural Resources at 410-260-8367.\n\nA credit may be allowed for substantial expenditures incurred in a 24-month period to rehabilitate a certified heritage structure located in Maryland.

The applicable recapture amount is calculated by multiplying the total amount of the credit claimed (or in the case of a sale, transfer, or other disposition of the ownership interest, the portion of the credit attributable to the ownership interest disposed of), by one of the following percentages:\n\n100%, if the event requiring recapture of the credit occurs during the tax year for which the tax credit is claimed;\n\n67%, if the event requiring recapture of the credit occurs during the first year after the close of the tax year for which the tax credit is claimed; or\n\n33%, if the event requiring recapture of the credit occurs more than 1 year but not more than 2 years after the close of the tax year for which the tax credit is claimed. The amount of recapture is entered onto line 5, Part H-I.\n\nThe credit may also be subject to a recapture if the certificate is rescinded by the Maryland Department of Commerce due to the qualified investor failing to provide the required notice to the Maryland Department of Commerce of having made the investment, or if the Maryland Department of Commerce revokes the final certification due to false representations made in connection with the application for the certification.\n\nIf the credit is claimed by a qualified investor that is a PTE, the members of the PTE may claim the distributive or pro rata shares of the credit amount subject to the $250,000 limitation (or $500,000 for a QMCC located in Allegany County, Dorchester County, Garrett County or Somerset County).

If the credit is more than the State portion of the income tax liability, the unused credit may be carried forward for the next five (5) tax years, or until it is fully used, whichever comes first.\n\nIf, at any time during the three tax years after the year the credit was earned, the average number of qualified positions falls more than 5% below the average number of qualified positions during the year in which the credit was earned, a portion of the credit will be recaptured for the tax year in which this occurs.\n\nThe amount to be recaptured is the amount originally claimed as a tax credit multiplied by the percentage reduction in the number of qualified employees. The income tax credit to be recaptured is reported on the line specified for recaptures in the Business Tax Credit Summary of Form 500CR.\n\nFor taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, the income tax credit is available only with an electronically-filed return. A copy of the certification issued by the Maryland Department of Commerce must be included with the electronic return, and the Form 500CR section of the return must be completed.\n\nInsurance premium tax:\n\nDocumentation of the credit shall be maintained by the taxpayer in their files and be made available to the Insurance Commissioner, on request, in accordance with COMAR 31.06.04.03. The documentation should include documents from the agency granting the credit and a list of the names and telephone numbers for the taxpayer's staff who are directly involved in granting the credits. All information shall be retained for a minimum of three years from the date of the filing of the final tax return on which the credit is taken.\n\nPublic service company franchise tax:\n\nForm AT3-74 must be submitted with the franchise tax return (SDAT forms 11 or 11T).\n\nMaryland Department of Commerce\n\nOffice of Finance Programs, Tax Incentives Group\n\n401 E.
