        "text": "It’s already been a great year for sci-fi, thanks to blockbusters such as Dune: Part Two and Civil War, as well as goofball flicks like Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, and any other movies with the word “empire” in the title. Sure, it’s not all perfect. Bong Joon-ho’s Mickey 17, starring Robert Pattinson, has been pulled from the release schedule and there’s no way that Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse will release this year. But overall, 2024 has been a strong start for sci-fi movies.\n\nEven better, 2024 isn’t even halfway done. Per tradition, Den of Geek has put together a list of the big sci-fi movies heading your way for the rest of the year. This list doesn’t include upcoming sci-fi movies without firm release dates, but it will when they are announced. It will also be updated regularly to add any movies we may have missed, so feel free to shout those out in the comments!\n\nA Quiet Place: Day 1 – June 28\n\nLupita Nyong’o, Joseph Quinn, Alex Wolff, and Djimon Hounsou beef up the cast of this prequel set in the A Quiet Place universe. The story focuses on Nyong’o’s character as the adorably violent QP Pie monsters first take hold of New York. Michael Sarnoski directs based on a screenplay he wrote from an idea cooked up in tandem with franchise creator John Krasinski. We’re always wary of prequels, but this one’s got a quality cast and Pig was a great flick!\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine – July 26\n\nWade Wilson will finally collide with the rest of the X-Men in the only MCU film now set for release in 2024. Alongside Ryan Reynolds’ Merc with a Mouth, Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine in this movie set before the character’s death in Logan. Trailers indicate that there will be a big turnout from the Fox X-Men universe here, and set photo leaks have heavily implied that Dogpool will finally make an appearance on the big screen too!\n\nBorderlands – August 9\n\nAn unhinged crockpot of talent simmers on the upcomingBorderlands movie. Based on Gearbox’s hit video game series of the same name, Eli Roth (Thanksgiving) directs Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Bobby Lee, and Jamie Lee Curtis in what is sure to be one of 2024’s most irreverent and bonkers sci-fi action comedies. Blanchett plays Lilith, a mysterious outlaw who has to return to her home planet Pandora (not that one) in order to find the missing daughter of the universe’s most powerful bastard. We’re in!\n\nAlien: Romulus – August 16\n\nCailee Spaeny continues on her mission to become the busiest actress around. Following her star turns in Priscilla, Spaeny is in the main cast of two big sci-fi movies this year—Civil War and the upcoming Alien: Romulus, which is set between the events of Alien and Aliens. Originally, the movie was going to go straight to Hulu, but afterPrey did so well on streaming, 20th Century Studios had a change of heart and switched it to a theatrical release. Romulus is still cloaked in secrecy, but we certainly hope it serves to reenergize the franchise like the most recent Predator movie did.\n\nSlingshot – August 23\n\nFrom 1408 director Mikael Håfström comes Slingshot, another lonely astronaut movie in the vein of Spaceman from earlier this year. Slingshot stars Casey Affleck as John, a space traveler who loses his sense of reality while on a mission to Saturn’s moon Titan. Joining Affleck are Laurence Fishburne, Emily Beecham from Into the Badlands, and veteran British actor David Morrissey. We don’t know much else about the movie yet, but that premise is enough to capture our attention.\n\nTransformers One – September 20\n\nThe first animated feature-length film for the Transformers franchise in a very, very long time! Transformers One is a prequel story set outside the other movies, one that digs deeper into Megatron and Optimus Prime’s early years on Cybertron, and the war that consumed their planet. The film, which is an origin tale of sorts for Cybertron, has a stacked voice cast that includes Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, Jon Hamm, Laurence Fishburne, and Keegan-Michael Key.\n\nThe Wild Robot – September 27\n\nAnimator Chris Sanders has spearheaded more than a few all-time classic cartoon movies, most notably Lilo & Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon, so any project with his name deserves attention. Sanders has written and directed an adaptation of The Wild Robot, the hit picture book series by Peter Brown. The story of a robot adapting to life on a deserted island, The Wild Robot stars the voices of Lupita Nyong’o as the robot Roz, Pedro Pascal as the fox Fink, and Catherine O’Hara as the possum Pinktail. Even if that description doesn’t grab every reader, Sanders has more than earned the benefit of the doubt.\n\nVenom: The Last Dance – October 25\n\nWith Marvel and DC largely sitting out 2024, Sony makes a play for superhero supremacy with yet another Spider-Man villain universe release. Honestly, we deserve to have Venom: The Last Dance come out this year. After all, our tongue-in-cheek embrace of a clunky franchise with a gonzo Tom Hardy performance gave Sony the confidence to make other non-spider Spider-Man movies. Hardy returns for his third outing as Eddie Brock and his symbiote partner Venom, as does screenwriter Kelly Marcel, who also steps into the director’s chair this time. Newcomers Juno Temple and Chiwetel Ejiofor join them to try to keep the absurdity going long enough to get Sony to green light a Gibbon movie.\n\nKraven the Hunter – December 13\n\nAfter a string of delays, Kraven the Hunter is finally heading to theaters this summer fall winter. Mind you, not many people have been sitting around wringing their hands in agony waiting for Sony’s conservationist superhero tale, especially after Madame Web‘s disastrous showing earlier this year, but Kraven (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) does have his fans, and they deserve to finally see him in action. It’ll be the second time that the movie’s star has portrayed a Marvel Comics character on screen, having previously appeared in Avengers: Age of Ultron as Pietro Maximoff aka Quicksilver, and if he doesn’t die at the end of Kraven, he’ll have made it further than he did in 2015 at least!\n\nThe Electric State – TBA 2024\n\nWith Deadpool & Wolverine, Kevin Feige hopes to start a Marvel resurgence. At the same time, some of the biggest names from the MCU’s heyday try to stake their claim with The Electric State, based on the dystopian novel by Simon Stålenhag. The Electric State re-assembles Avengers: Endgame directing siblings Joe and Anthony Russo with writing duo Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Because it’s a Netflix movie, The Electric State stars Millie Bobby Brown, but the Russos and co. will get some help from one of their favorites from the MCU days, Chris Pratt. Will that combination remind fans of everything they loved about hit films from a decade ago? Or will it prove that Feige’s better off without them?\n\nAll of the other major 2024 movie releases are listed here!"
