        "text": "Thankfully, though there remains plenty of work still to do, these past few years have witnessed an increased level of media scrutiny on the lack of inclusion and inaccurate depictions of disabled characters in mainstream films and TV.\n\nThis is perhaps because audio-visual broadcast content can be visceral. It’s more in your face and this makes it easier to spot what’s been done badly, or indeed, that which is conspicuous by its absence.\n\nWhat seems to go more under the radar is the inclusion of important characters in books and fiction and in children’s books in particular.\n\nThe latter is extremely important because what is undeniable is that the books children read in their formative years, whether it be for education or pleasure, are capable of shaping young minds quite unlike anything else.\n\nBooks engage in an entirely different way than films and TV because the long form factor and time the reader spends immersed in the story allows for a level of character development that is almost impossible to replicate on-screen.\n\nWhen it comes to the latter, one of the most steadfast criticisms of the medium in relation to disability depiction is the lack of incidental depiction showing people with disabilities going about their daily lives.\n\nThat is to say that, in films and TV, where characters with disabilities are present, their entire raison d’etre and defining characteristic tend to revolve around the impact of their disability.\n\nOften, this sits somewhere on a spectrum of being sympathy-engendering helpless victims or villains themselves with their physical or psychological differences contributing to an uncomfortable sense of othering.\n\nOn the screen, what we see far less of is disabled characters going about their lives like everyone else – picking up the kids from school, shopping for groceries, or just going to work.\n\nThis is primarily down to decades of ignorant, inconsiderate and ill-judged content emerging from Hollywood writing rooms but there are also limiting factors endemic to the medium.\n\nSpecifically, there’s only so much character development and aspects outside of the central narrative that can be packed into two hours.\n\nNovels don’t have this limitation.\n\nThe narrative moves at a far slower pace and the reader has access to, not just the character’s key interactions with others, but their private thoughts and daily routines as well.\n\nIn such a way, books are an ideal vessel for incidental disability depiction which is, in turn, the most meanigful tool the creative arts possesses in assisting the widespread normalization of disability across society.\n\nWhen one extrapolates the above to children and the books they read, often involving characters in the same age bracket, these effects are even more compelling.\n\nToday, we might live in an age of streaming wars with almost impossible volumes of content right at our fingertips.\n\nNonetheless, many people will never forget those age-defining childhood stories that populate that period when kids start choosing what to read for themselves and finding their own time to do it.\n\nFor some kids, those temporary fleeting relationships constructed on the pages of a beautifully written book can be just as important, albeit in a very different way, to the real-life ones they experience in the schoolyard.\n\nBooks are a wonderful way to help kids understand that people with disabilities are often just like them – with the same dreams, ambitions, passions and sense of humor.\n\nAt the same time, there also exists an unmissable opportunity for children living with disabilities to view themselves reflected out there in the world.\n\nWhen it comes to having more disabled characters in children’s books – there is plenty of work still to be done.\n\nIn a recent article in the Toronto Star on the topic co-authored by Christina Minaki, a novelist, librarian, social justice educator and disability rights advocate and Gillian O’Reilly, an award-winning author and former editor of Canadian Children’s Book News with an interest in disability issues – some damning statistics were revealed.\n\nIn 2019, a survey undertaken by the Star on children’s books published during the previous year found only five books with disabled characters out of a total of 463 published.\n\nReviewing what was published in 2019, that figure had risen to 11 books from a total of 419.\n\nDisappointing reading indeed – when one considers that 15-20% of the world’s population is estimated to live with some type of disability.\n\nIn the same article, the authors also wrote:\n\n“We need stories about physically disabled characters with full lives and productive, interesting futures ahead of them. We need stories showing that disability comes with unique challenges, but it is essential that novels resist the temptation to have disabled people/characters exist to inspire, teach or correct others, or make them cry.”\n\nThey further added:\n\n“Amid all the progress we are making on diversity, we must stop shelving physical disability as the forgotten diversity portrayed only in set ways. We need to prioritize the voices of disabled authors and the stories of real and living disabled characters making their way in the world.”\n\nThe point about disabled authors is a crucial one.\n\nUnless the publishing industry does a better job of opening its doors, as well as hearts and minds to writers with lived experience of disability – then authentic, engaging and incidental disability portrayal will always remain a significant distance behind where it could and should be.\n\nHowever, as is always the case in disability inclusion – there are just so many important moving parts required to build genuine momentum – so that just might have to be a story for another day."
