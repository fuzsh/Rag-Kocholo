Over several years the observation was moved to different months but in 1990Â Public Law 101-343Â set the month-long observance in November. Each year the President issues a Proclamation in recognition of the observance. National American Indian Heritage Month is observed from 1 - 30 November of each year. The observance month recognizes American Indians for their respect for natural resources and the Earth, having served with valor in our nation's conflicts and for their many distinct and important contributions to the United States. Please note that the title of this observance varies between the various documents listed and DEOMI uses that title set forth in the 1990 and subsequent Public Laws.
