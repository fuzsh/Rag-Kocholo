        "text": "Women’s and Gender Studies is a dynamic interdisciplinary field preparing students to be future leaders, scholars, and social justice activists. We are dedicated to studying the social production of gender and women’s experiences in relation to formations of sexuality, race, class, nationality, ability, ageism, and other categories of difference. Scholarship and research in Women’s and Gender Studies emphasize the importance of connecting what students learn in the classroom to political projects and personal experiences.\n\nOur curriculum empowers students to be agents of change in their communities and society. It provides them tools to examine relations of gender in local, national, and global contexts. Our courses situate gender within specific historical and cultural contexts, allowing students to examine how our lives are shaped by social and economic institutions, political movements, and individual experiences. “Putting Theory into Practice” since 1971, we place a strong emphasis on community involvement and activism, and we offer many opportunities for internships and service work credit.\n\nThe B.S. in Women’s and Gender Studies prepares students for careers in education, as professors, teachers, or curriculum specialists; counseling, as school counselors, psychological or family therapists; law; health; human services; student services; and public service."
