        "text": "The Australian Government is committed to ensuring people with disability, injury or a health condition have equal opportunities to gain employment. There are a range of employment programs that support people with disability who need, or would like, help to find and maintain employment. Employers can also access free help to recruit, support and retain employees with disability.\n\nDisability Employment Services (DES)\n\nDisability Employment Services (DES) is the main employment service for people with disability, injury and/or health condition. The current DES program will run until 30 June 2025 when a new specialist disability employment program will commence.\n\nPeople with disability may be eligible for one of two different parts of the DES program:\n\nDisability Management Service is for job seekers with disability, injury or health condition who need assistance to find a job and occasional support in the workplace to keep a job.\n\nEmployment Support Service is for job seekers with permanent disability who need help to find a job and who need regular, ongoing support in the workplace to keep a job.\n\nProviders of DES — called DES providers— are a mix of large, medium and small for-profit and not-for-profit organisations experienced in supporting people with disability, as well as helping employers to support employees with disability in the workplace.\n\nTo find a DES provider:\n\nvisit the DES provider search page on JobAccess\n\ncontact a JobAccess Advisor on 1800 464 800\n\ntalk to a Centrelink representative by calling the Centrelink employment services line on 132 850 or by visiting a local service centre\n\nview the List of current DES providers.\n\nDES providers can help those looking for work to:\n\nget ready to work\n\ntrain in specific job skills\n\nwrite a resume\n\npractice interview skills\n\nlook for jobs that suit them.\n\nOnce in a job, DES providers can help with specific on-the-job training and support that suits the participants' needs. This includes help under the Work Assist program. Work Assist provides support to eligible employees who have difficulty fulfilling the essential requirements of their role due to their injury, disability or health condition. A DES provider will work with the Work Assist participant and their employer to provide support that maximises the chance of maintaining employment.\n\nSupport for participants\n\nThe DES program gives participants flexibility and choice in the services they receive and how they receive them. A DES participant information pack is available for participants, providing information to support making informed choices on their employment journey. The participant information pack contains frequently asked questions (FAQ) fact sheets. View the DES participant information pack.\n\nSupport for employers\n\nDES providers offer recruitment support and guidance to employers. This may include help to:\n\npost job vacancies\n\nshortlist candidates\n\ninterview people with a disability\n\naccess available financial support (if eligible).\n\nInformation for providers\n\nOperational information for DES providers is available.\n\nDisability Employment Services Grant Agreement\n\nDisability Employment Services Guidelines\n\nDisability Employment Services Charter of Contract Management\n\nDisability Employment reforms\n\nAs part of the 2024–25 Budget, the Government announced a number of measures that will improve employment and career outcomes of people with disability, injury or illness.\n\nRead the media release and learn more information about other Department of Social Services’ Budget measures.\n\nA new specialist disability employment program\n\nA new specialist disability employment program will replace the current DES program from 1 July 2025.\n\nThe new program will focus on assisting people with disability to find and maintain sustainable employment. It will improve the quality of service for participants by ensuring the support provided is tailored to their circumstances. There will be a greater focus on quality providers, with staff and leadership that reflects the diversity of the communities they are working with. Providers will place clients and employers at the centre of their service design and build meaningful relationships with both clients and employers.\n\nIn line with the new specialist disability employment program, The National Panel of Assessors program will continue to deliver assessment services from 1 July 2025.\n\nRead more about the new specialist disability employment program.\n\nDisability Employment Centre of Excellence\n\nA Disability Employment Centre of Excellence (Centre of Excellence) is being established to develop best practice, evidence-based information to help providers deliver high-quality effective employment services and supports to improve disability employment outcomes. The Centre of Excellence will support the introduction of the new specialist disability employment program from 1 July 2025.\n\nRead more information about the Centre for Excellence.\n\nThe Complaints Resolution and Referral Service and Hotline\n\nThe Complaints Resolution and Referral Service (CRRS) and Hotline will be continued to 31 December 2026. Through continued support for the Hotline and CRRS, the Government is keeping in place a robust complaints framework that protects the rights and safety of people with disability. This will ensure continued coverage and support for people with disability with concerns or complaints, while the Government considers future arrangements in the context of the broader reforms within the disability sector, including the response to the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability and the National Disability Insurance Scheme Review.\n\nRead more information about the Hotline and CRRS.\n\nFact sheets\n\nFurther information about reforms to disability employment announced as part of the 2024- 25 Budget is available in the following factsheets:\n\nA new specialist disability employment program – Factsheet\n\nA new specialist disability employment program – Participant Factsheet\n\nA new specialist disability employment program – Employer Factsheet\n\nA new specialist disability employment program – Provider Factsheet\n\nDisability Employment Centre of Excellence - Factsheet\n\nNational Panel of Assessors - Factsheet\n\nSupported Employment\n\nSupported employment refers to jobs where people with high support needs (i.e. those who, because of their disabilities, need substantial ongoing support to obtain and/or keep paid employment) can receive extra support while they are at work.\n\nIf an individual is eligible for the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), supports for employment could be funded through their NDIS Plan. Further information about supported employment under the NDIS, including information on the pricing framework, are on the NDIS website.\n\nParticipants can use their supported employment funding in any workplace they choose, including mainstream employment, social enterprises, micro-businesses, or supported employment services (including those traditionally known as Australian Disability Enterprises or ADEs).\n\nThe Supported Wage System (SWS) is set up for employees with disability who are not able to perform jobs at the same capacity as any other employee. Under SWS, special workplace arrangements are created so that employers can pay wages to a person with disability based on how productive they are in their job.\n\nAn employer or DES provider may make an application under the SWS. The SWS assessment will be conducted by an independent assessor.\n\nLearn more about supported employment and the SWS.\n\nDisability Employment Services (DES) Performance Framework\n\nThe Government has developed a new DES Performance Framework (Performance Framework) to measure provider performance. It came into effect from 1 July 2024, and replaces previous DES Performance Frameworks and measures.\n\nUnder the new Performance Framework, providers will be assessed against key performance measures. These measures include the DES Quality Framework.\n\nThe Performance Framework will help improve:\n\nprovider performance\n\nthe quality of services delivered\n\nemployment outcomes for participants.\n\nRead more about the Performance Framework.\n\nDES Quality Framework\n\nIn July 2023, the Australian Government announced a new Disability Employment Services (DES) Quality Framework.

It offers help and workplace solutions for people with disability and employers.\n\nJobAccess also plays a coordinating role with the National Panel of Assessors to conduct free workplace assessment, and advise on workplace modifications and support which may be eligible for reimbursement through the Employment Assistance Fund (EAF).\n\nThe EAF gives financial help to eligible people with disability and mental health conditions and their employers to buy work related modifications, equipment, Auslan (Australian Sign Language) services and workplace assistance and support services. The EAF is available to eligible people with disability who are about to start a job, are self-employed or who are currently working. It is also available to people with disability who need Auslan assistance or special work equipment to look for and prepare for a job.\n\nUnder JobAccess, a National Disability Recruitment Coordinator (NDRC) can offer assistance to employers across Australia to:\n\nincrease their knowledge of support available through DES\n\nimplement employment practices\n\nprovider disability and training for staff.\n\nMore information on support available for staff with disability is available the JobAccess website. Employers can also call JobAccess Advisor on 1800 464 800 to connect with a National Panel of Assessor provider or NDRC account manager (if eligible).\n\nWorkforce Australia Employment Services\n\nWorkforce Australia is the employment service delivered by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. It includes an online service and a network of providers that deliver support to job seekers on income support, including those with disability, to find a job or create their own job.\n\nEmployers can post current vacancies and all Australians can search and apply for jobs on the Workforce Australia website.\n\nAs part of Workforce Australia, Self-Employment Assistance can help participants turn their business idea, or existing small business, into a viable business.
