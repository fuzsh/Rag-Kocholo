Heart of Darkness

Alpha Stage

Heart of Darkness is a role-playing desktop game, currently in early development stages. It tells the story of a notoriously evil mythical creature Minotaur, with aid of his mobs, attacks the land of [the hero] and kidnaps their people. The hero, simply known as the Player, is a self-contained knight who seeks neither help nor trouble for his people, discovers his wife's disappearance, and heads to look for her, with the aid of a longtime wanted robber and amateur criminal, Alexandro.

Upon the discovery of a massacre, the story takes a turning point and the journey changes radically.

Thank you very much.

Added a Chasing Goblin into the game!

One of the enemies/challenges of the game is the quest to steal an item (e.g. a crystal) from a guard goblin and deliver it to a targeted position. The goblin chases you down until either you deliver it (and he dies) or he takes it from you and runs back.

Obstacles get created when you steal it, you can destroy them but they slow you down. Although you might have destroyed them, they get back created again once the item is returned.
