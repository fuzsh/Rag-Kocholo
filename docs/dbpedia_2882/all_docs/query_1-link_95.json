        "text": "Ubisoft insists that the seemingly troubled Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development, and it will still one day be released.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Ubisoft has tried to reassure its fans that Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still being released. This is despite the fact that the game is currently the most delayed AAA game ever. However, it seems that Ubisoft’s other troubled title, Skull and Bones is after that crown.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 was teased 15 years ago!\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 is the prequel to the original 2003 cult classic. So it’s fair to say that 20 years and counting is a long time to wait for a new game for a beloved IP.\n\nHowever, it’s still quite difficult to fathom that Beyond Good and Evil 2 was initially teased nearly 15 years ago in 2008. Yes, it’s really been that long. We kid you not.\n\nThe prequel was then re-revealed in 2017 during an E3 presentation. So, you’d be easily forgiven if you totally forgot that this prequel was ever a thing.\n\nUbisoft has been in trouble lately\n\nIt’s not been a particularly great few years for Ubisoft. First, and most importantly, the company has been shrouded in allegations of sexual harassment and a toxic workplace environment. Secondly, it’s been cancelling projects left, right and centre.\n\nIn 2022, Ubisoft cancelled four projects (that we know of). Then this month, the company not only cancelled a further three projects but also delayed Skull and Bones for the 6th time. To make matters worse, as a result of the most recent cancellations, Ubisoft stock plummeted.\n\nSo, what’s the deal with Beyond Good and Evil 2?\n\nIn a statement provided to Eurogamer, a Ubisoft spokesperson told the publication that: “Beyond Good and Evil 2’s development is underway and the team is hard at work to deliver on its ambitious promise.” However, there was no indication of when it might release or when we might next see more of the game.\n\nIn 2021, industry insider and somewhat a source of information, Tom Henderson claimed that Beyond Good and Evil 2 won’t be released until 2024 to 2025. At this rate, I wouldn’t argue against it.\n\nDo you believe we’ll see more of Beyond Good and Evil 2 this year, what’s more, do you believe it will ever be released?
