After I set my refresh rate to 144gz, I experienced audio bugs, where the game cinematics would speed up faster than the audio. I read that a fix would be to just play the game at 60gz, so I quit the game and relaunched to bring me to the settings launcher again. This time, however, I cannot change my refresh rate, and the resolution scrolldown menu is blank.",
