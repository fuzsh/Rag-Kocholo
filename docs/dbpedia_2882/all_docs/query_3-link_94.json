This is not fair to them either and sales will increase once this issue is fixed\n\nBy re-issuing a new more accurate English subtitle, paying customers can enjoy the Suikoden Successor you have spent years creating, and enjoy it as it was intended to respect Yoshitaka Murayama's legacy\n\nHelp us enjoy your game as you intended it to be\n\nEDIT: I encourage everyone to post their bug reports about the localisation (under the localisation tab) here:\n\nhttps://fs30.formsite.com/505games/hundredheroes/index\n\nAlso as Zen kindly pointed out, feel free to contact R&B studios directly via email to get this issue sorted:\n\nOriginally posted by Zen:\n\nOP, you can email this directly to the developer. Their email address: contact@rabbitandbearstudios.com\n\nedit:\n\nOriginally posted by LoafEye:\n\nyou're still in the minority.\n\nWe've been told by trolls that we are the 'minority' on this issue so i did some analysis of this thread itself:\n\nPeople who are expressly requesting a fix to the English Localisation issue: FOR: 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 Unique Posters\n\nPeople who are neither for or against but are \"ok/fine\" with current English Localisation: NEUTRAL : 28 Unique Posters\n\nPeople are expressly against the notion of an accurate English Localisation : AGAINST: 6 Unique Posters\n\n2100% more people want the change then do not, or 75% want this change expressly and 96.3% either want this change or are not inconvenienced by the change\n\nAlso curiously, you would expect as the OP of this post i would have the most posts within this 62 page thread, but that's not the case at all\n\nPost Count:\n\n1st: Loafeye - AGAINST: 75 posts\n\n2nd: Tankanidis:- FOR (and OP of thread) 56 posts\n\n3rd: Zio: 48 posts- AGAINST\n\nSo 2 out of the 3 top posters in this thread were from the 'against' side.\n\nCongrats Loafeye on being #1 in posts in a thread you said :\n\nOriginally posted by LoafEye:\n\nYeah I don't care dude,\n\nAlso congrats to Zio, who managed to achieve #3rd even though 2/3 of your posts were deleted. Take heart in knowing if the Tally was sorted by word count, you'd still be #1st\n\nTL:DR: 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 People signed this request for a more professional English Subtitle. 28 Neutral. 6 Against.\n\n75% of people posting expressly want this change to happen.\n\n96.3% of people posting want this change to happen or are not inconvenienced by a more accurate English language localisation subtitle\n\n2100% more people want this to happen then do not want it to happen.\n\n3.7% of people expressly DO NOT want this change to happen.\n\nMost posts in top 3 posters were from people against it, with 123 posts coming from the top 2 people against the idea, even eclipsing the OP of the thread's post count greatly\n\nedit:\n\nDear R&B Studio/505 Publishers this issue is too important and too expensive for you to ignore and not address. The single action of fixing the current English Localisation Subtitle is the most important financial decision you can make for the health of Eiyuden Chronicle: 100 Heroes. Please listen to your current customers, and your prospective customers and fix this issue!! TL:DR TL:DR TLDR:\n\nThere's between $2-$3 million dollars worth of customer purchases that directly states the current English Localisation Subtitle needs to be Fixed as priority"
