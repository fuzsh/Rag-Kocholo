        "text": "The best superhero games are larger-than-life adventures full of chances for you to save the day and look good doing it.\n\nIn true comic book style, many of the titles on this list give the best RPGs (role-playing games) and the best story games a run for their money with well-constructed stories and memorable, fully realized characters. However, much like comic books themselves, the best superhero games come in many different varieties. Below, you'll find strategy games that ask you to be responsible for a team of heroes. You'll find slick action games and challenging card games alongside intense dramas and gripping cinematic blockbusters. You'll even find one of the best JRPGs (Japanese role-playing games). In short, there's a huge range on offer.\n\nFortunately, we at TechRadar Gaming know video games and we're ready to pass on our knowledge to you. With our help, you'll soon find your next big superhero adventure. Whether you're a Marvel fan or a DC maven, we're confident you'll find something below that suits your tastes. Read on to find out more.\n\nBest superhero games\n\nSwinging all over town\n\nAvailable on: PS5\n\nPerhaps one of the best superhero games ever made, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 faithfully captures the Spider-Man fantasy while also conveying the web-slinger's darker side. The game follows two Spider-Men: Miles Morales and Peter Parker, featuring the latter's exposure to the Venom parasite. On top of the usual slew of villains, this means that our heroes have to contend with Peter's struggles to overcome the dark inclinations caused by his infection.\n\nLike its predecessor, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is an open-world action game with exceptionally fun traversal mechanics. Sure, you can fast-travel, but why would you want to when web-swinging through New York feels so good? As we put it in our review: Marvel's Spider-Man 2 \"prioritizes fun above all else, with a host of accessibility features to let everyone join in.\"\n\nAvailable on: PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S\n\nRepresenting the other side of the best superhero games coin, the third and final installment in Rocksteady's open-world third-person Batman series caps the series off triumphantly. The game follows the blueprint of previous Arkham titles offering action and mobility in equal measure. You can rappel your way around using the grapnel gun, beat enemies into a pulp using the game's freeflow combat system, and engage in some now-typical open-world activities like taking out watchtowers and hunting down specific criminals.\n\nReleased in 2015, Batman: Arkham Knight set the bar for what an open-world superhero game could be. The title's imagining of Gotham City doesn't skimp when it comes to size, visuals, or level design, nor does the cavalcade of side missions disappoint. Not only that - Arkham City features a tense, exciting central story that will thrill fans old and new.\n\nAvailable on: PS5 and PS4\n\nOne of the best superhero games of its day, Infamous: Second Son sees players take on the role of Delsin Rowe, a young man with extraordinary abilities known as a Conduit who's also on a mission to take down an organization that's hunting him and his kind. Delsin makes his way through an open-world Seattle, where his actions can make him the villain or the hero - depending on how you use his powers.\n\nDespite its age, this open-world game has stood the test of time. Delsin is modeled after actor Troy Baker, whose voice and motion capture performances did a great deal to bring the character to life. Using and acquiring new powers feels fluid and fun, and while there is a lot of open-world busywork, Second Son makes you feel so empowered that the prospect of battling another enemy stronghold doesn't bore, but excites.\n\nAvailable on: PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S\n\nNo list of the best superhero games would be complete without this mix of XCOM-style turn-based combat, deckbuilding, and comic book drama. Though this may sound like an odd combination, the strategy veterans at Firaxis Games have managed to craft a gripping turn-based combat system that translates different Marvel heroes' superpowers into card skills. You play as a centuries-old warrior named the Hunter, who teams up with a broad roster of Marvel heroes from Iron Man to Blade to stop the apocalypse.\n\nMarvel's Midnight Suns goes to serious lengths when it comes to building a world where all of these different superheroes fit without alienating players who only know some of them, or who might have no touchpoints with Marvel other than the movies. The writing is top-notch and will endear you to every single hero as they battle with personal issues and the game's roster of sinister villains. Midnight Suns also includes a significant social element that sees you hanging out in front of the TV with your favorite characters, painting, stargazing, and much more.\n\nAvailable on: PC, PS5, PS4 Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One\n\nWhen it comes to fighting games, Injustice 2 is one of the best superhero games there is. Developed by NetherRealm Studios, the makers of Mortal Kombat 1, Injustice 2 is all about dramatic setpiece battles, showing off a broad roster of DC heroes and villains, all alongside a story that blurs the line between the two.\n\nInjustice 2 looks good, plays smoothly, and features a fun combo system that makes you feel powerful even if you're not a seasoned fighting game player. Add to that immensely detailed animations and plenty of environmental attacks, and you have a fighting game that makes you feel like a true superhuman. On top of this, the game's story is as dramatic as they come, offering a dark tale right at home in the DC universe.\n\nAvailable on: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch\n\nMany of the best superhero games make this list because they offer something new and refreshing to their respective genre. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy does this in a big way, not only by providing a tightly paced storyline that tugs at the heartstrings but also by putting forward a third-person combat system that reinforces the ensemble nature of the game.\n\nAs Peter Quill, you'll have to manage the frictions and concerns of your team of interplanetary ne'er do wells. You'll make choices during dialogue scenes, often with outcomes that won't become obvious until later on in the story. Combat reflects this by having you give orders to your teammates as you battle. Different attacks complement each other, inflicting status conditions that synergize - not unlike the Guardians themselves. The story plumbs some mature depths, too, dealing with themes of parenthood, grief, and abandonment. Though whip-fast banter and comedic quips are the order of the day, the entire adventure boasts thoughtful emotional undertones that serve to keep things grounded.\n\nAvailable on: PC, iOS, Android\n\nPerhaps the best superhero game when it comes to free-to-play products, Marvel Snap is a mobile card game that sees you battle it out across three randomly selected locations from the comics. You and your opponent place cards representing Marvel characters on a shared board. As your heroes and villains' different abilities trigger, you'll aim to build up more points than your opponent. Come out of a match having amassed the most power, and you win. On the surface, it's simple enough, but, dive in, and you'll find a game full of delicious complexity.\n\nSnap's central appeal lies both in the simplicity of the core game experience and how many different outcomes you can produce depending on the cards you have. The game features a wide variety of heroes to play, with new cards still being added. While the temptation to spend real money on cards may be high, Marvel Snap still functions perfectly well when played entirely for free. It's a rush to see your favorites fight together and to discover all the different power combinations on offer.\n\nAvailable on: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch\n\nIt may seem odd for a list of best superhero games to include one of the best JRPGs of recent years. However, Persona 5 Royal plays into superhero tropes in a big way. Following a group of Japanese teenagers, the game quickly takes a supernatural turn when the protagonists find they can venture into the minds of corrupt adults and defeat their target's inner darkness. To do this, our plucky gang must don masks and costumes representing their 'Personas' - the roles they take within the game's trippy mindscape.\n\nBy day, you're a mild-mannered student, doing your best to get decent grades and stay on the good side of your surrogate father. In secret, you're a Phantom Thief, donning your mask and costume as you fight against hypocrisy and evil. As the calendar rolls on, you'll need to plan your days, hone your skills, and try to be the best version of yourself you can be. There's nothing more superheroic than that.\n\nAvailable on: PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch\n\nThe best superhero games come in all sorts of forms, but The Wonderful 101: Remastered is perhaps the most eccentric entry on this list. In The Wonderful 101, you control a whole host of tiny heroes Pikmin 4-style. But, instead of finding your way around and collecting fruit, you fight huge monsters by drawing shapes with your controller, transforming your heroic bunch to carry out different attacks and maneuvers.\n\nTo be successful in The Wonderful 101, you'll need to study your enemies and learn their weaknesses all while overcoming a drawing system that can be a bit finicky. These initial frustrations are worth it, however, for the exciting and varied battles you'll face. Whether you're transforming into a sword to fight huge mechanical dragons in mid-air or fighting sentient cannons at a baseball stadium, the Wonderful 101's settings and enemies make for a refreshing change of pace.\n\nBest superhero games: FAQs\n\nWhat is the best superhero game?\n\nMarvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and Batman: Arkham Knight all stand as fantastic examples of some of the best superhero games. All three do justice to the comics that inspired them while also offering a fresh take on beloved heroes and villains.\n\nAny game on our best superhero games list could potentially qualify as the 'best superhero game', but it's hard to offer a definitive answer. This is because the idea of a 'best' game of any kind often comes down to personal taste. That said, we're confident that any title on this list is a good start.\n\nIs Spider Man 2 the best superhero game ever?\n\nWe loved Marvel's Spider-Man 2 here at TechRadar Gaming. However, we're not sure we'd call it the best superhero game ever made - that very much depends on your own personal tastes.\n\nWhile dedicated Spider-Man fans may well feel that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is the pinnacle of the format, strategy buffs may find themselves more at home in Marvel's Midnight Suns. Meanwhile, fans of anime or JRPGs might find that Persona 5 Royal is more in line with their preferences.\n\nHow we made our best superhero games list\n\nSuperhero stories are dramatic, larger than life, and painted with broad, vibrant brush strokes. Any list of the best superhero games would need to accommodate this, not only in terms of the quality of the superhero games themselves but also in terms of how effectively they capture the superhero fantasy.\n\nWe also aimed for a broad range of genres across a wide range of consoles. Our list contains both lengthy 150-hour RPGs and short, 10-minute card games so as to accommodate a wide range of fans. Some folks like their fun in short bursts while others prefer to sit down with a game for hours at a time. Whether you prefer Marvel Snap or Marvel's Midnight Suns, we wanted the list to reflect that there's no wrong way to enjoy the best superhero games."
