        "text": "We begin this week’s What We Played with a plug for TSA’s Killzone 3 Boot Camps. We began the Boot Camps with the release of Killzone 2 so that we could all find our feet with the game in a friendly, abuse- and spawn camper-free environment. Not heard Helghan called a friendly environment before have you.\n\nThe Boot Camps are still running for Killzone 3 and this week Tuffcub has been hanging out there, though he’s keeping schtum on the subject of whether Kitteh is still helping him out with his grenade handling skills.\n\nOther than Killzone 3 he’s been working through White Knight Chronicles: Origins for our forthcoming review, becoming really angry in a way that he can’t talk about and joining in the rough and tumble, on a virtual rugby pitch, in Jonah Lomu Rugby Challenge.\n\nToby’s been away from his PS3 for a while and on his return has broken out an old favourite, Battlefield: Bad Company 2…\n\n[It has] reminded me what Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 needs to do to to get Battlefield in its sights. A repeat with new maps isn’t an option – it has to offer a diverse range of new features, whilst ensuring that Call of Duty ELITE is really worth paying for. I’m looking forward to seeing the sales figures for each, and whilst early indications point to a strong Battlefield lead, I’d be very surprised if it could dent Call of Duty in the sales department.\n\nAlso playing B:BC2, but this time on PC, was Josh who is fighting his way through the campaign. He’s played the community-assisted minis title Gamocracy One: Legend of Robot “but got very annoyed with the way it handles deaths”. Then it was a spell of PC tower defense game Revenge of the Titans but that only left him needing to play “reigning king of the genre PixelJunk Monsters on PS3. It’s soooo gooood.”\n\n[videoyoutube]After that it was time for some charity work. Well, charity play actually. This year’s Humble Indie Bundle has just been released. Featuring five great indie titles (Crayon Physics Deluxe, Cogs, VVVVVV, Hammerfight and And Yet It Moves) at a price of your own naming it’s a fantastic opportunity to get some great games.\n\nNot only that but you can choose how the money you pay is split between the developers, the Child’s Play charity, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the admin costs of running the Humble Indie Bundle promotion.\n\nThe games come DRM-free and you have a choice of platforms; Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Between myself and Josh we’ve played Crayon Physics Deluxe, Cogs and VVVVVV, all off which we can highly recommend.\n\nRather than playing Battlefield, a battlefield was created in the heart of England as Chris found himself mounting a defense of his own homefront when Homefront tried to establish a beachhead, riding in on a Lovefilm-sponsored landing craft. It was swiftly repulsed before even getting near to his PS3 following Chris’ “extraordinarily unspectacular experience with the demo”. The principal beneficiaries of his defensive action were Gran Turismo 5, PES 2012 and Warhawk.\n\nJen has been feeling a bit under the weather lately but you can’t keep a dedicated gamer down so she’s still managed to find some time for a couple of games. First up was DiRT 3. At least until she found herself falling asleep while taking corners and discovered she still hasn’t got sleep-drifting nailed.\n\nAfter that she broke out her 3DS for a bit of Zelda, but probably not the one you’d think…\n\nZelda: Link’s Awakening has been my most played 3DS game despite it being an old game available on the virtual console. Love it and still remember a surprising amount of it from when I played it years ago as a kid. I’d be controversial enough to say I enjoy it more than Ocarina of Time. Eeek!\n\nEeek indeed. We now turn to Alex who is no doubt standing by to mount a staunch defense of Ocarina of Time… except he isn’t. He’s too busy either having great fun with Forza Motorsport 3’s multiplayer or pre-occupied trying to get the latest set of graphics together for the game he and Michael are making.\n\nIn stark contrast to the odd couple of games that most of us have played, Dan played a “bazillion” games at Hyper Japan but even that was not enough for him.\n\nI’ve had a blast playing One Epic Game as well, which really captures the “just one more go” factor. Forza 3 has also seen some play time, as i picked up the ultimate edition with all DLC for £15. It’s such an amazing racer, and much more my style than GT5. Online games of car ‘tag’ are epic!\n\nIt seems that Forza is something of a theme this week as Blair has also succumbed:\n\nA group of TSAers and myself have been playing Forza 3 online every other night for the past week, it’s an absolute blast and tag mode is hilariously fun (one player is ‘it’ and must tag others to lose the ‘it’).\n\nI’m quite rubbish at racing but that hasn’t stopped me honing my skills throughout the Season mode. It’s quite strange that I enjoy Forza so much due to my hatred of simulation style racers, I usually opt for Kart or Arcade racers, so it’s a nice change I suppose.\n\n[drop]Perhaps he’s been playing Forza to try and purge memories of his quick dabble with Duke Nukem Forever as the usually talkative Blair expressly wants to avoid talking about that game. His experience with Ms. ‘Splosion Man was much more positive. He says that it’s “an excellent 2.5D platformer. Although it can get quite frustrating it’s mostly frantic fun.”\n\nHe’s been having yet more fun with LEGO Harry Potter, which he calls “a quirky, easy take on the franchise” that takes him “back to the old days of LEGO Star Wars”. If LEGO Star Wars counts already counts as “old days” then I’m even more past it than I previously thought.\n\nSpeaking of myself, after reading Dan’s review last week I had to pick up Bastion at the weekend. Whilst it was downloading I had a quick wander through the game library on my Xbox 360 and spotted that Peter was ahead of me in the overall leaderboard for Trials HD.\n\nAfter a quick go to narrow the gap, Bastion finished downloading and I headed off in that direction. Peter’s lead will not be there for long though now he’s made himself a target by poking his nose out in front of the herd.\n\nAs for Bastion, Dan was right, it’s brilliant. If you can, you should play it. That is all.\n\nWhat have you been playing? Has one of TSA’s reviews prompted you to part with your cash for a game this week?"
