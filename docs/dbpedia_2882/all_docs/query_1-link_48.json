        "text": "Ubisoft has revealed that the game will support 4K 60FPS, autosaving, and cross-saving, as well as \"improved graphics, controls, and audio.\" The publisher has also confirmed that the 20th anniversary remaster will include a new speedrun mode, achievements, and a gallery featuring behind-the-scenes content.\n\nThe goal is to connect the game to its sequel, which follows the events prior to the original, by adding treasure hunts that reveal more about the protagonist Jade's past. The sequel was first teased in 2008 before disappearing until a cinematic trailer was shown at E3 2017, followed by a dedicated livestream two years later.\n\nThe game will be available on June 25 for PS4/5, Xbox Series X/S and One, Nintendo Switch, and PC through Steam, the Epic Games Store, and Ubisoft Connect. A physical release will also be available from Limited Run Games, with pre-orders beginning July 12."
