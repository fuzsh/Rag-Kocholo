        "text": "Project X Zone 2\n\n'\n\nArea:\n\nWreckage Beach, Fallen Arm, Mechonis\n\nOrigin:\n\nXenoblade Chronicles (2010)\n\nPrevious Chapter:\n\nChapter 29: The True Dragon Fist\n\nNext Chapter:\n\nChapter 31: Turnabout Dance\n\nOverview[]\n\n\"Way Beyond Good and Evil\" is the thirtieth chapter and thirty-fifth overall chapter in Project X Zone 2. It is the second of two Xenoblade Chronicles themed chapters.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nThe Dragonturtle isn't faring too well since the attack, but at least it's easier than climbing up. Urashima pulls up the monitor and the group sees what looks like a giant arm. Fiora explains that before the giants became worlds, they fought each other in battle and that was when Mechonis's left arm was cut off. She also directs them to a beach where the vehicle can land.\n\nAfter arriving, the party is impressed by the seaside view but they see gold chains in the ocean. They think about diving down there, but the Dragonturtle's not exactly in diving shape. She suggests gathering some parts from the beach, which includes a generator from a broken down Mechon she once controlled: Face Nemesis. She also mentioned some Warning Lamps and Digital Filaments around as well, which could help with the repairs.\n\nHowever, Metal Face appears and crashes the beach party along with some Mechons. He mentions that since the chains brought him back to life, he thinks he could use them to keep reviving himself even if he's killed. They decide to take care of the enemies before collecting the items.\n\nOn the other end of the beach, Dokurobo was staring off into the distance when he noticed the fight. Turns out the other enemy groups left him onshore. After some convincing, he teams up with Metal Face. While Urashima suggests taking care of the enemies before combing the beach, Xiaomu gets a funny premonition that something might appear if they collect the items before clearing the beach.\n\nAs they face off, Dokurobo spots beach beauties on the surf. At first everyone thought he'd gone crazy from sunstroke, but then T-elos and Unknown appear from the shoreline. She also had some Gnosis with her, since they kept following her. She teams up with Metal Face again, and just as they start again Zagi leaps out of the water. It seems he came from the ocean floor, where Ryugu Castle was and mentioned Sigma was there, prompting the others to hasten the repairs. Some monsters from Terca Lumireis surfaced from the sea and the fight starts for real this time.\n\nAfter defeat, Metal Face leaves to look for power equal to the Monado. With Unknown down, she mentions Jin's name before disappearing. Heihachi isn't too surprised at this point with the chain's power to bring the dead to life.\n\nJust then, Aragami suddenly come crawling out of the sea and onto shore. Not wanting an outbreak to spread, they begin cleaning up the beach.\n\nT-elos retreats after being defeated, saying that her true objective lies elsewhere. Zagi heads off after a painful beating, but knowing he'll be back, Yuri says he doesn't understand what true power is. Nana and Ciel are impressed how the others could hold their own against Aragami after taking care of Vajra. After defeat, Dokurobo leaves off in a huff again. Marduk was defeated, though Alisa and Jill are concerned about Shadaloo's control over Aragami.\n\nAfter collecting the generator, it appeared to be in working condition. The Warning Lamp was collected followed by the Digital Filaments. After collecting the parts (provided there are enemies remaining) Urashima is picking up a signal from the seabed and asks the party to investigate.\n\nAfter some work, the repairs are finished. It is now possible to dive into the seabed, but then KOS-MOS senses an energy change and they witness the gold chains disappearing. Everyone gets onboard and prepares to dive into the ocean.\n\nStrategy: You can either clear the enemies before gathering the items or do the item collecting first, depending on what strategy you prefer. The items are located in these locations: Digital Filaments (south of the Dragon turtle), Warning Lamp (on the other end of the beach), Generator (look for the broken down mech). The spring nearby can heal a damaged unit if they walk into it. A gift will appear there if you get the required items before all enemies are defeated.\n\nParty Members[]\n\nNote: Only 13 Pair Units allowed\n\nPair Units[]\n\nReiji & Xiaomu\n\nChris & Jill\n\nKiryu & Majima\n\nJin & Kazuya\n\nDemitri & Morrigan\n\nHiryu & Hotsuma\n\nChun-Li & Xiaoyu\n\nKOS-MOS & Fiora\n\nX & Zero\n\nKite & Haseo\n\nAkira & Kage Maru\n\nDante & Vergil\n\nZephyr & Vashyron\n\nCiel & Nana\n\nRyu & Ken\n\nSakura & Gemini\n\nOgami & Erica\n\nChrom & Lucina\n\nYuri & Flynn\n\nSolo Units[]\n\nHeihachi\n\nPhoenix & Maya\n\nNatsu\n\nAty\n\nRyo\n\nCaptain Commando\n\nUlala\n\nLeon\n\nIngrid\n\nAxel\n\nValkyrie\n\nLeanne\n\nJune\n\nAlisa\n\nPai\n\nFelicia\n\nSegata\n\nEstelle\n\nHibana\n\nEnemies[]\n\nImage Name Lv.

She reappeared as Face Nemesis and fought against Shulk and the party several times until her control was broken thanks to the party at Galahad Fortress and fell towards the Fallen Arm. Shulk managed to awaken her after pulling her out of the Mechon and giving her a kiss (by drinking water and kissing it into her).\n\nLost Jerusalem in Xenosaga refers to Earth, since mankind left for the stars after Gnosis ravaged the planet.\n\nThe ship Zagi mentioned was when they fought aboard Ragou's getaway boat in order to catch him. The secret mission in that battle was to knock Zagi off the boat.\n\nThe Monado is a blade and a key weapon in Xenoblade Chronicles. It is the default weapon for Shulk after obtaining it from Dunban and it can enhance the users' abilities, one of these being able to foresee future events.\n\nIn the Yakuza series, Kamurocho has a casino called Ryugu (meaning Dragon Castle) and has several gambling games from traditional (like Cho-Han and Koi-Koi) to more modern ones like Poker and Roulette.\n\nProject X Zone Chapters Prologue 1 - Prologue 2 - Prologue 3 - Prologue 4 - Prologue 5 - Chapter 1 - Chapter 2 - Chapter 3 - Chapter 4 - Chapter 5 - Chapter 6 - Chapter 7 - Chapter 8 - Chapter 9 - Chapter 10 - Chapter 11 - Chapter 12 - Chapter 13 - Chapter 14 - Chapter 15 - Chapter 16 - Chapter 17 - Chapter 18 - Chapter 19 - Chapter 20 - Chapter 21 - Chapter 22 - Chapter 23 - Chapter 24 - Chapter 25 - Chapter 26 - Chapter 27 - Chapter 28 - Chapter 29 - Chapter 30 - Chapter 31 - Chapter 32 - Chapter 33 - Chapter 34 - Chapter 35 - Chapter 36 - Chapter 37 - Chapter 38 - Chapter 39 - Chapter 40 - Final Chapter"
