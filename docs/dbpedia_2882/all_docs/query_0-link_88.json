        "text": "Xbox Game Pass announcements and new release dates have been flying in from all directions. Here's every upcoming Game Pass game that's been confirmed so far...\n\nHeidi Nicholas\n\nPublished 26 Aug 2024\n\nFollowtopics\n\nXbox Series X|SXbox Game Pass PCXbox Game PassArticleHeidi Nicholas\n\nWith all the chaos of Opening Night Live and Gamescom announcements pouring in from all sides, we thought it a good time to update and refresh our massive list of all the upcoming Game Pass games to see where we stand for 2024 and beyond. This round-up is a beast, as we've included everything that has an Xbox Game Pass or PC Game Pass release date, games with broader release windows, and those that haven't yet had any release window confirmed.\n\nWith Microsoft's regular Game Pass announcements and release dates flying in from all sides, this list has yet again had a good old shuffle around. Take a look through to see all the games coming to Game Pass over the next few years, ranging from the long-awaited arrival of AAA hits to day-one additions of intriguing new indie titles.\n\nWe make sure to keep this article updated as more announcements are made and as games hit the service, so be sure to keep an eye on it!\n\nAugust 2024\n\nCore Keeper\n\nMining sandbox adventure game Core Keeper joins Xbox Game Pass on August 27, the same day it leaves Early Access on Steam. Core Keeper sees you doing a lot: exploring underground, base-building, gardening, crafting, fishing, collecting pets, fighting Titans, and more.\n\nSopa\n\nNarrative adventure game Sopa is set to come to Game Pass in August, although we don't yet have a specific day. In Sopa, Miho heads to the pantry on a seemingly simple mission to get a potato for his grandma's soup, and is instead taken to a strange land — what's more, every time he manages to make it back to the kitchen with another ingredient, things have somehow changed.\n\nSeptember 2024\n\nStar Trucker\n\nStar Trucker is a truck sim set in space, where you’ll be doing a lot: completing long hauls and drop-offs, trading, managing your systems to make sure you don’t perish in space, deciding whether to transport contraband, upgrading your truck to reach new areas, and listening to all the space trucker goings-on on your interactive radio. It lands on Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass as a day-one addition on September 3.\n\nAge of Mythology Retold\n\nWe at last have a release date for the Definitive Edition of 2002's much-loved game — Age of Mythology Retold hits Game Pass on September 4!\n\nFrostpunk 2\n\nInitially expected to launch in July, the sequel to the excellent Frostpunk has been delayed and will now launch on September 20. The initial plan was for it to arrive first for PC and PC Game Pass as a day-one addition in July and for Xbox later, but whether this is still the plan for September's release remains to be seen. Either way, prepare for gruelling gameplay and high stress levels.\n\nAra: History Untold\n\nAra: History Untold was announced during the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase as a historical turn-based strategy game which will join PC Game Pass at launch, and arrives on September 24.\n\nOctober 2024\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6\n\nMicrosoft has now confirmed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will join Game Pass on day one when it launches on October 25 as a spy action thriller set in the 1990s. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will introduce a new campaign along with modes including Classic Prestige, Theater Mode, and Round-Based Zombies.\n\nNovember 2024\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 is the next iteration of the Microsoft Flight Sim series, and luckily, as the name suggests, has a 2024 release date: it’ll join Xbox and PC Game Pass on November 19, and promises to be even more ambitious than the previous game.\n\nStalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl\n\nStalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl brings first-person shooter action to Xbox Game Pass at launch, when we’ll be exploring a post-nuclear open world. Developer GSC Game World is based in Ukraine and shared an emotional video diary explaining its situation. The game has been delayed several times, and has now been pushed back from September to November 20.\n\nGenshin Impact\n\nIt was a huge announcement at Gamescom to hear that open-world adventure-RPG Genshin Impact will be coming to Xbox and Game Pass, as it's only been available for PlayStation and PC for the last few years. Genshin Impact heads to Xbox on November 20.\n\nDecember 2024\n\nIndiana Jones and The Great Circle\n\nMachine Games' first-person action-adventure game Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is set between the Raider of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade movies, and has now confirmed its Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass release date as December 9.\n\n\"Early 2024\"\n\nBounty Star: The Morose Tale of Graveyard Clem\n\nBounty Star: The Morose Tale of Graveyard Clem is an upcoming action game where we play as Clementine McKinney as she fights her way across a post-post apocalyptic desert in a rather snazzy mech. It was delayed from 2023 into early 2024.\n\n\"Fall 2024\"\n\nAll You Need is Help\n\nIn fall 2024 we get \"quirky\" co-op puzzle game All You Need is Help, where we help strange fluffy creatures to solve puzzles and work together.\n\n2024\n\nPigeon Simulator\n\nPigeon Simulator asks you to \"Become a pigeon. Poop on everyone. Destroy everything,\" when it comes to Xbox Series X|S and Xbox Game Pass at some point in 2024. Not only are you a pigeon, you're apparently a time-traveling pigeon, who's been sent through time to thwart a goose. Chaos!\n\nGhost Bike\n\nGhost Bike was revealed during a recent Annapurna Interactive Showcase as an adventure game in which you play as \"a streetwise kid from Freehub City on a mission to revive the last of the Ghost Bikes\" — those who can traverse between the living world and the world of the dead. It's set to hit Game Pass in 2024.\n\n33 Immortals\n\nSpiritfarer devs Thunder Lotus Games announced 33 Immortals as a \"co-op action-roguelike for 33 players\" where you're a \"damned soul\" going against \"God's final judgement.\" It's been given an Early Access release window of 2024.\n\nDead Static Drive\n\nIndie survival horror title Dead Static Drive — which has already spent almost a decade in development — can now at last be shifted into the \"2024\" section of this list.\n\nGoat Simulator: Remastered\n\nIn what proved to be one of the best trailers of Gamescom, Goat Simulator: Remastered was announced and confirmed to come to Game Pass on day one in 2024.\n\nCommandos: Origins\n\nIt doesn't have a specific release date yet, but real-time tactics game Commandos: Origins will join Xbox Game Pass on day one in 2024.\n\nSniper: Ghost Warrior Contracts 2\n\nLikewise, CI Games announced \"modern warfare shooter\" Sniper: Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 would be joining the service in 2024, but without an exact date.\n\nThe Alters\n\nSci-fi survival adventure game The Alters comes to Xbox Game Pass and PC Game pass later this year, telling the bizarre story of Jan, who needs the help of alternate versions of himself to survive after crashing onto a strange planet.\n\nArk II\n\nSurvival game Ark II has seen a big delay — instead of launching in 2023 as originally planned, Ark II will now launch at the end of 2024, when it will star Vin Diesel as Santiago and Auli'i Cravalho as his daughter Meeka. Expect it to expand heavily on the scale and scope of its popular dino-packed predecessor.\n\n2025\n\nAvowed\n\nFirst-person RPG Avowed was announced in 2020 and has been delayed from its initial fall 2024 release window to February 18, 2025. It's set in the fantasy world of Eora, and is set to join Xbox Game Pass at launch — you can check out our round-up of everything we know about Avowed in the meantime!\n\nAtomfall\n\nSurvival-action game Atomfall is set to come to Xbox Game Pass on day one, and has now narrowed down its release window to March 2025. Set in Britain, Atomfall is inspired by a real nuclear disaster which took place in 1957, and “blends post-war Britain with Cold War paranoia, folk horror, and elements of classic British sci-fi like Day of the Triffids, Doctor Who, and The Prisoner, to create an immersive and thrilling gameplay experience.”\n\nWinter Burrow\n\nOne unexpectedly cozy announcement from Xbox Games Showcase 2024 was Winter Burrow, which comes to Xbox Game Pass in early 2025 as a woodland survival game about a small mouse and their efforts to restore their childhood home, survive the wilds, and find out what happened to their missing Aunt.\n\nCitizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector\n\nCitizen Sleeper's sequel, Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will see you gathering a crew, manning a ship, and navigating the Starward Belt. It doesn't yet have a release date, but is set to come to Xbox Game Pass at launch in early 2025.\n\nReplaced\n\nRetro sci-fi 2D adventure Replaced has now been delayed from 2024 to 2025. We’ll play as Reach, an AI trapped in a human body, and will explore and fight our way through Phoenix City. The pixel art here is some next-level stuff...\n\nLost in Random: The Eternal Die\n\nLost in Random: The Eternal Die is set to come to Game Pass in 2025. The sequel makes some changes to its predecessor's action-adventure setup, and will instead be a roguelite adventure set in the same world of Random.\n\nSniper Elite: Resistance\n\nRebellion announced Sniper Elite: Resistance during Gamescom's Opening Night Live, and confirmed it would come to Game Pass as a day-one addition in 2025.\n\nSleight of Hand\n\nPreviously the first lonely entry into the \"2025\" section of this list, Sleight of Hand hits Game Pass next year, bringing an interesting mix of deckbuilding and stealth action, magic, the occult, and more.\n\nSouth of Midnight\n\nSouth of Midnight is a third-person action-adventure game set in the American Deep South with a focus on magic realism. The most recent Xbox Games Showcase confirmed a South of Midnight release window of 2025, and it'll launch straight into Xbox Game Pass.\n\nFable\n\nHere’s one we’ve been waiting for for a while: Fable was announced back in 2020 as a “new beginning for the legendary franchise” with “fantastical creatures and wondrous places,” and after a long wait, we now have confirmation that it'll launch in 2025 when it will join Xbox Game Pass on day one. In the meantime, check out our round-up of everything we know about Fable!\n\nDoom: The Dark Ages\n\nDoom: The Dark Ages heads to Xbox Game Pass in 2025 as a single-player action FPS prequel to Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal, telling the story of the Doom Slayer and the war against Hell.\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a new turn-based RPG, inspired by Belle Époque France and charting the story of Expedition 33 as they fight to defeat the Paintress to stop her from “painting death.” It looks beautiful, creepy, and all kinds of intriguing, and comes to Game Pass in 2025.\n\nWuchang: Fallen Feathers\n\nSoulslike action-RPG Wuchang: Fallen Feathers was also announced during the Xbox Games Showcase as a day-one Game Pass addition arriving in 2025. Set in the Ming Dynasty, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers sees us play as pirate warrior Bai Wuchang, who is cursed with “Ornithropy.”\n\nMixtape\n\nThe Artful Escape developers Beethoven & Dinosaur announced Mixtape during Xbox Games Showcase 2024 as a day-one Game Pass addition for 2025, when it’ll tell the story of three friends on the verge of leaving high school. As they head to their last party, we play through some of the most important moments of their friendship.\n\n\"Coming soon\"\n\nNirvana Noir\n\nNoir adventure game Nirvana Noir is currently set as \"coming soon\" to Game Pass, and it sounds like a chaotic one. \"The city of cosmic beings is under threat in two parallel realities - one where the Big Bang was never fired, the other exploding in color and sin. It’s up to you to solve the mysteries of the Bigger Bang in this follow up to the award-winning Genesis Noir.\"\n\nVolcano Princess\n\nVolcano Princess, a parenting-sim-RPG adventure, is also coming \"soon\" to Game Pass, asking us to raise the next monarch of the Volcano Kingdom.\n\nUnknown\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong is the long-awaited sequel to Hollow Knight, so it’s great to hear that it’s coming to Xbox Game Pass at launch, even though we don’t have a specific release date yet. If you like Ori but wish the games were darker and more challenging, keep an eye on this (and go play the original in the meantime, it's ace).\n\nVapor World\n\nAction-adventure platforming game Vapor World — which looks to have a similar feel to Lies of P — doesn't yet have a release date, but is set to come to Xbox Series X|S and Xbox Game Pass at launch.\n\nTowerborne\n\nTowerborne was announced as a new action-adventure game from Stoic Studio, the creators of Banner Saga, with a 2024 release window. This has since been adjusted: the game will now launch in full as a free-to-play title in 2025, but will first launch for Steam Early Access on September 10, followed by Xbox Game Preview. Since we don't yet have a release date for Xbox Game Preview or the 2025 full launch, we'll keep this one in \"unknown\" for now.\n\nVoidtrain\n\nOpen-world survival game Voidtrain is in \"unknown\" for now since it's a little unclear what's going on with its release windows. At Gamescom, the devs shared an Xbox Game Preview release window of fall 2024, but the trailer also mentions Xbox Game Pass alongside a Q1 2025 release window. We'll move this one as soon as we learn whether it will be available in Game Pass via Xbox Game Preview in the fall.\n\nClockwork Revolution\n\nClockwork Revolution was announced during the Xbox Games Showcase as a steampunk first-person RPG and a big project for developer inXile entertainment. The announce trailer has a Bioshock look about it, but we don't yet have a release date or window for this one.\n\nContraband\n\nContraband was announced as a \"co-op smuggler’s paradise set in the fictional world of 1970s Bayan\" — we don't yet have a release date for this one, which seems a little way off yet, but we'll keep an eye out.\n\nGears of War: E-Day\n\nOne surprise announcement from 2024’s Xbox Games Showcase was Gears of War: E-Day, a prequel which takes place 14 years before Gears of War and follows Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago as they battle the Locust Horde. There’s no release window for this one yet, but it’ll come to Xbox Game Pass on day one.\n\nHarmonium The Musical\n\nHarmonium The Musical is a narrative adventure and an interactive sign language musical. Announced at The Game Awards 2023, it was confirmed as coming to Game Pass on day one, but doesn't yet have a release date.\n\nEverwild\n\nEverwild, revealed back in 2019, is another one that seems to have disappeared after its announcement, although a report suggested Everwild is targeting a 2024 release after being “restarted from scratch”. We’ve heard no official update on when Everwild might emerge, so here it goes, into the “unknown” section.\n\nTO A T\n\nTO A T is a narrative adventure game which comes from Katamari Damacy game designer Keita Takahashi about a teenager (called Teen) with \"an odd posture\" as they go through life in their small town, attending school and dealing with bullies, until a new ability changes everything.\n\nBushiden\n\nBushiden is an action-adventure game with platforming elements — details are pretty scarce at the moment but it seems that in Bushiden we are dealing both with the disappearance of our sister and the fact that the evil Gaoh has returned with an \"cybergentic army\" which we'll need to defeat. It was confirmed back in 2021 that Bushiden would join Xbox Game Pass on day one, but we don't yet know a release date.\n\nMarauders\n\nMarauders is described as a first-person multiplayer sci-fi dieselpunk looter shooter where we play as a space pirate — it was meant to launch into Game Preview for PC Game Pass in 2022, but we've not yet heard word of a new release date.\n\nRoutine\n\nFirst-person sci-fi horror game Routine was announced back in 2012, and then seemed to vanish until it was re-revealed back in June of this year. It’s set to join Xbox Game Pass at launch, whenever that launch may be.\n\nSlime Rancher 2\n\nSlime Rancher 2 is available in Game Preview/Early Access with Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass already, but if you're waiting to play until the achievements are added with the full release of the game, there's a bit longer to go — we don't yet have a concrete release date for when Slime Rancher 2 launches in full.\n\nSo, what do you think? Anything on there catch your eye, or take you by surprise? What do you think of the gaming horizon for Xbox Game Pass?
