        "text": "Beyond Good & Evil fans might not have any news on the long-in-development prequel, but a 20th Anniversary Edition is set to launch next week.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nUbisoft announced the official release of Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition during the Limited Run Games showcase on Thursday. It’ll be launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on June 25.\n\nAlong with allowing players to replay the original, the 20th Anniversary Edition will feature new content, including a reorchestrated soundtrack, a new treasure hunt, and an anniversary photo gallery. To go along with this current generation of consoles, players will be able to experience it in 4K at 60 frames per second.\n\nThe physical editions by Limited Run Games are now available for preorder and will be released on July 12.\n\nThis new “real” announcement comes after a post from the game’s X account, which teased that it would be unveiled during the Limited Run Games showcase on Thursday. While the showcase reveal was the official one, many outlets (thanks Gematsu) noted that Ubisoft posted about it on X (formerly Twitter) before removing it earlier Thursday. We suspect the post was accidentally published early, but we expected the full reveal will be during the presentation.\n\nThere have been plenty of other signs that the 20th anniversary edition was incoming this week. Video Games Chronicle reported last week that PlayStation trophies for the game started appearing on Exophase, an online achievement tracker. The outlet also found that the original Beyond Good & Evil was delisted from Steam and the Xbox Store (although it’s still available on GOG at the time of this writing).\n\nUbisoft previously announced the release in November, saying that it would “talk more about this special edition soon … Stay tuned!” This was after the discoveries of achievements and an ESRB rating. Social media account Wario64 even spotted that the 20th Anniversary Edition store page was live, with the game even briefly available for a time. So ,you could say we’ve known about this game for a long while."
