        "text": "News video games 31 August 2023, 16:59\n\nauthor: Christian Pieniazek\n\nBeyond Good and Evil May Get a Remaster to Celebrate 20th Birthday\n\nESRB has added the entry for Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition to its database. It looks like Ubisoft is preparing a new edition of its iconic game.\n\nThe ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board), the US-Canadian organization that assigns age ratings to video games, is often a source of information on as-yet-unannounced projects. This time it may have revealed ahead of schedule the existence of a new release of an iconic Beyond Good & Evil.\n\nIts database has gained an item called Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition, which is set to head to PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch (per Idle Sloth).\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition in the ESRB databaseSource: ESRB\n\nUnfortunately, in its description we will only find information about the game's content; there are no details on whether Ubisoft is preparing a remaster or a full-fledged remake. Let's hope that the French giant won't do the same as Rockstar Games, releasing a simple port of the game without significant improvements (as the latter publisher did with the recent Red Dead Redemption for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch).\n\nBeyond Good & Evil is an action adventure game created by Michel Ancel, author of the Rayman series.\n\nThe game takes us to the planet Hyllis, whose inhabitants were attacked by an alien race. The main character, a reporter named Jade, having tangled with the invaders herself, begins to question the official information about the elimination of the threat. Her doubts are confirmed by the rebel organization IRIS, which leads her to conduct her own investigation to uncover the truth.\n\nThroughout the adventure, Jade uses a camera, detective skills and an aikido stick.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil had already received a remaster, in the form of 2011's Beyond Good & Evil HD."
