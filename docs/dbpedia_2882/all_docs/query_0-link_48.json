        "text": "Parents have a responsibility to know more about the video games and other media their kids consume.\n\nIn Microsoft's latest Halo title, you shoot a bunch of funny looking aliens with an arsenal of futuristic, off-planet weapons; you fly around in a spaceship blasting alien turret guns; and you play through an epic story of interstellar warfare between humanity and forces far beyond our control.\n\nWhat you don't ever do is go into a classroom or a crowded movie theater and shoot a bunch of innocent people.\n\nActually, as I said in my Halo 4 review series, once you peel back the layers you discover that the game is actually a love story.\n\nIt's not a romantic love story; rather, it's a deeper and more intriguing story of friendship between a man who is as much machine as he is human and an artificial intelligence who is very nearly a real person.\n\nIt's quite possibly the best Halo ever made, and I found its climax profoundly moving.\n\nWriting in The Atlantic, Laura McKenna says she's reconsidering giving her 13-year old son Halo 4 for Christmas.\n\nWhile she admits that violent video games \"don't turn kids into killers\" and that even \"profoundly disturbed individuals don't enact acts of horror solely based on their access to violent video games\" she still finds herself doubting the wisdom of giving her son violent video games as a present.\n\n\"I do not want to contribute to the culture of violence in America,\" she writes, and I really do understand her point, especially in the wake of the Aurora and Newtown shootings.\n\nThe other game she's questioning giving her son is Call of Duty. I presume she's considering giving him the most recent title---Black Ops II---though she doesn't explicitly say as much.\n\nI have played both games, and I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I had a 13-year old son I would not give him Black Ops II for Christmas but I would give him Halo 4 in a heartbeat.\n\nThe problem with violence in pop culture---in television, film, and video games---is not that it exists in the first place or that it transforms our children into murderers. The problem is that parents are not involved enough in which games and other media their children consume. I'll use McKenna's post as an example of this because I think it illustrates a problem many parents face: they don't understand the media their children consume because they themselves don't consume it.\n\nHalo 4 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 are the biggest games of the year. They're both wildly popular and made tons of money. They're also about as different as two games in the first-person shooter genre can get. Halo 4 is violent, but the violence is fantastical, set in a science fiction world where people don't swear or torture one another, where the only blood is green alien blood. Its story is emotional and personal.\n\nBlack Ops 2, on the other hand, is an extremely violent game full of very adult themes. It's an \"R-rated\" video game, or at least its single-player campaign is. Multiplayer is another ball game entirely.\n\nOther games like Max Payne 3 and Far Cry 3 that came out this year are similarly dark. The violence in these games is always against human beings, and in Max Payne 3 in particular the violence extends far beyond the point-and-shoot variety.\n\nI don't think these games will make kids violent or lead them to commit atrocities, but that doesn't mean they're appropriate for all ages. As parents, we need to determine which games we feel comfortable with our kids playing and which games are too mature or too violent or have explicit sex scenes two-thirds of the way through.\n\nJust like with movies, some parents will be more lax and others more strict. The only way to determine what we feel comfortable with is by playing the games ourselves. It isn't hard to get a sense of just how much more violent and inappropriate Call of Duty is than Halo 4.\n\nContributing to the violent culture in America is a peculiarly American sentiment also. Many of the readers of this blog hail from other countries, and many of them are avid gamers.\n\nWhile violence is a problem everywhere, violent video games in Europe and Asia have not sparked the sheer number of public mass shootings we've seen in America. It seems like an odd conclusion to draw that violent video games impact Americans more than citizens of other nations. The fact that tens of millions of people play video games on a regular basis and only the tiniest fraction go on to commit violence themselves weakens the argument further, though doesn't guarantee that violent video games won't spark violent thoughts in people already suffering from mental health issues.)\n\nIn fact, as video game consumption has increased violent crime in the United States has decreased. Correlation is not causation, but even so it's hard to argue that violent video games or movies lead normal, sane people to commit these horrible acts. If they did, we wouldn't be dealing with a handful of shootings a year, we'd be in a constant state of war.\n\nThat doesn't mean parents should simply buckle to pressure from their kids. There's lots and lots of fantastic games with violence that is much more cartoony (like Halo 4!) or that simply avoid violence altogether and are still tons of fun. Play games with your kids and you'll find all sorts of surprising adventures, from Journey to LittleBigPlanet to the Halo games or the marvelous LEGO titles.\n\nAll that being said, I freely admit that I'm bothered by violence in some games. With a title like Black Ops 2 the violence is so thoughtless you're either bound to be disturbed or feel numb by the end of it (again, multiplayer excluded.) These games are violent for the sake of violence. And when people play them they rarely think about what any of it means. I believe that fiction in video games, novels, and film can all serve to increase our capacity to empathize with others. Violence doesn't make this empathy impossible, but violence without substance certainly doesn't help either.\n\nIt's not the shooting that usually bugs me, either. Anytime violence in a game is a test of skill, it becomes more of a puzzle-solving element than anything; it's the gratuitous moments that occur outside of gameplay that bug me most.\n\nThat's why a game like Spec Ops: The Line was such a wonderful title.\n\nWhether you agree with its message of complicity, that game made you think. Of course, on its surface it looks like just another violent shooter rather than some modern-day Heart of Darkness. This is a critique of quality more than anything else. Video games and writing/plotting in games often fall short of greatness and lacks muscle in the meaning department. But a game like Halo 4 certainly raises the bar.\n\nNor do I have all the answers when it comes to these nightmare mass shootings.\n\nFirst and foremost, I believe that they point to a mental health crisis in this country. Our society has not addressed the needs of those suffering from mental health issues. There is no real collaborative push to help families and children who are suffering from mental health disorders, or to ensure that their access to guns and other weapons is limited.\n\nI also think that reasonable steps can be taken to limit access to the sorts of weapons that have been used to carry out these shootings without infringing on the rights of responsible gun owners. Somehow we need to do a better job at keeping guns out of the hands of people with serious mental health problems.\n\nIf funding education weren't so impossibly difficult, perhaps we could put more resources into safety at schools, but hiring security guards and putting up metal detectors is a project that would cost billions of dollars in a country that is poised to topple off the \"fiscal cliff\" in a couple weeks.\n\nWhatever the case and whatever the answer, censoring speech is a bad idea. In China this week, 101 people were arrested for spreading end-of-the-world \"propaganda\" in regards to the upcoming Mayan apocalypse.\n\nThis is one reason why China never frightens me: theirs is a society that must clamp down on speech in order to maintain control. But speech, like water through cracks in a dam, will always find a way. In America as in much of the rest of the world, we laugh off the impending doom because it's funny. We write blog posts about the best post-apocalyptic video games without fear of government reprisal.\n\nWhichever ancient Mayans devised this long, long con are probably laughing at us from their perch in Mayan heaven right now.\n\nBut freedom doesn't extend to our own homes. McKenna has every right not to buy her son violent video games or to disallow video games entirely.\n\nOne way or another, parents do need to be involved in the type of media their children consume and do their best to give that consumption context. What better way to do this than to sit down and play some Halo 4 with your kids? Then you can introduce them to some good old-fashioned science fiction and really get their minds spinning.\n\n\"As much as I would like, I can't shield my children completely from that culture of overt violence and its more subtle variations,\" admits McKenna. \"They have to leave my house to catch the school bus every morning and be out there in the world with all its beauty and its evil. But maybe I can make our own home a refuge from the worst influences.\"\n\nShe says she has ten days left to decide what to do. I'd suggest she opens up both games, pops them into the Xbox 360 while her son is out of the house, and decides for herself what sorts of images, actions, and themes she wants her son exposed to in the refuge of her own home."
