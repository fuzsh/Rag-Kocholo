My memory was faulty, I could've sworn the whole game was letterboxed.\n\nRegardless, if letterboxing causes a game to run better and gives it a distinctive look and doesn't adversely affect gameplay, I'm not sure I see the downside here. If the only complaint is that it's a smaller image, then by that logic every handheld and tablet game is inherently inferior. It's not like it's Steven Seagal's Letterbox 2000 we're talking about here...\n\nEh I'm not sure I can agree with your analogy on that one. To me the important point is about the percentage of users' screens that are being utilized, not the relative screen size. The 2.4:1 letterboxing in The Order is reducing the image size by 35% from 16:9. I mean, 2.4:1 is beyond even what the majority of films are displayed in.\n\nHDTV is already widescreen.\n\nTo expand a bit, the cinematic argument is silly because in cinema, the director has perfect control of the camera and where shots are going to be. Those shots can look beautiful and breathtaking because the user is never going to be able to change anything about it. Video games are a completely different story (and this is why I still loathe the term \"cinematic\" when applied to games). Playing a video game requires agency and, unless the camera angle is fixed like in older Resident Evils, players need to be able to see more of the screen and they need to be able to move the camera.\n\nZooming the camera in, cutting down the field of view, and letterboxing games are all ways of squeezing extra power out of underpowered consoles. I just can't believe any developer that seriously believes in the whole \"cinematic\" angle of these things when all of them actively make the game slightly worse experiences, especially for any player who has any idea what they're talking about.\n\nFor the record, I'm not saying that a letterboxed game is necessarily bad or that I won't play it. See: Resident Evil 4, an excellent game. But then RE4 was designed when a lot of people still owned 4:3 TV's and the gameplay was designed around having a 16:9 widescreen. I'd have to plug up my 360 to find out, but I can't even recall the HD version having a letterbox.\n\nHow often do people complain about having to play old games in 4:3? Is Zelda 3 automatically a bad game now because it has giant letterboxing?\n\nIf people didn't make such a big deal about it I don't think I'd even notice it to begin with. Case in point, I only just found out Dragon's Dogma was letterboxed in a thread a few weeks ago that was complaining about letterboxing, despite having played it for around 100 hours beforehand.\n\nObviously if it gets in the way of gameplay it's a huge problem, but if you can ignore the frame around your monitor/TV I don't see why you can't get over a couple of black bars."
