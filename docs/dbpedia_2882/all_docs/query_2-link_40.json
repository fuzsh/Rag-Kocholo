        "text": "Heart of Darkness is a cinematic platform video game developed by Amazing Studios and published by Ocean Software in Europe (and Interplay Entertainment in North America for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows).\n\nThe game took a full 6 years to develop, during which a \"bidding war\" was started among companies such as Atari and Sega over who would distribute the game.\n\nThe game has received much praise for its atmosphere, difficulty, graphics, and soundtrack.\n\nGame Boy Advance Port\n\nIn 2001, a Game Boy Advance port for the game was announced.[1] It would have likely been released in Europe first by Infogrames. However, the port was cancelled on an unknown date for unknown reasons and it's unknown how much of the port was developed before cancellation.\n\nGallery\n\nScreenshot 1/4.\n\nScreenshot 2/4\n\nScreenshot 3/4.\n\nScreenshot 4/4.\n\nExternal Link\n\nWikipedia page on Heart of Darkness.
