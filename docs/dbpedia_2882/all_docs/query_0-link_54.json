Most of them are probably a few years away from launch.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls VI - Unknown\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nBethesda Game Studios\n\nPublisher\n\nBethesda Softworks\n\nLet’s be clear: we have no clue when The Elder Scrolls VI is going to be released. It’s definitely a ways off, and there are very, very few details on the project, but there are always plenty of rumors, and we know it’ll definitely make its way to PC.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls VI – Official Announcement Teaser\n\nDeath Stranding 2 - TBD\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nKojima Productions\n\nFirst announced by Hideo Kojima at the Game Awards 2022, Death Stranding 2 is a real project that’s in development. We know that actor Norman Reedus will be reprising his role as Sam, and that’s about it. We won’t see this game for a few years.\n\nDeath Stranding 2 (Working Title) - TGA 2022 Teaser Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nArk II - Q4 2024\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Indie\n\nDeveloper\n\nStudio Wildcard, Grove Street Games\n\nPublisher\n\nStudio Wildcard\n\nRelease\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\nArk II is going to give fans of the survival series exactly what they want — more dinosaurs. First announced in 2020, trailers starring Vin Diesel (yes, you read that correctly) describe a war in the past that led to the state of the world being a mashup of prehistoric animals and futuristic technologies. We think it’s safe to assume that gameplay will be very similar to the first game — you’ll explore with friends, raise dinosaurs, hunt dinosaurs, be hunted by dinosaurs, and try to build a safe settlement in a harsh world. This game has been pushed back to late 2024, but we could see it slipping into 2025.\n\nArk 2 - Cinematic Trailer | Game Awards 2020\n\nState of Decay 3\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), Xbox Series X|S\n\nState of Decay 3 exists, and that’s about all we know.

Like Stardew, there will be lots of ingredient gathering, getting to know the townsfolk, and a wee bit of combat set to a lovely soundtrack. Developer ConcernedApe has been working on this project in secret, so details have been handed out very slowly through a blog — there’s no word on a release date yet.\n\nConcernedApe's Haunted Chocolatier -- Early Gameplay\n\nThe Outer Worlds 2\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG)\n\nDeveloper\n\nObsidian Entertainment\n\nPublisher\n\nXbox Game Studios\n\nThe Outer Worlds 2 is an upcoming sequel to the dystopian sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds, a game often compared to Bethesda’s Fallout 4 and Starfield). Xbox first revealed a short trailer for the game at E3 2021, but there were no new details during any of the company’s showcases in 2022 and 2023. This game appears to be quite a ways off still.\n\nThe Outer Worlds 2 - Official Announce Trailer - Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase 2021\n\nGrand Theft Auto VI — TBA\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nRockstar Games\n\nPublisher\n\nRockstar Games, Take Two Interactive\n\nGTA 6 is set to head to the state of Leonida (based on Florida), home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City, beautiful beaches, and spooky swamps full of rednecks.

Right now, the industry is looking at a late 2025 or early 2026 release date for the next Grand Theft Auto, and it isn’t coming to PC right away.\n\nMarvel Rivals\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows)\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Strategy, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nNetEase Games\n\nPublisher\n\nNetEase Games\n\nMarvel Rivals is putting the hero in hero shooter with literal superheroes. Unlike traditional hero shooters like Overwatch, this time, you will be playing from a third-person perspective to get a better look at your hero in battle. We don’t know a lot about this title yet or have any release date timeline, but it was officially announced in April 2024.\n\nMarvel Rivals | Official Announcement Trailer\n\nPath of Exile 2\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nGrinding Gear Games\n\nPublisher\n\nGrinding Gear Games\n\nWe don’t know much about this sequel yet other than it’s place in the Path of the Exile timeline — it’ll be set 20 years after the events of the first title.
