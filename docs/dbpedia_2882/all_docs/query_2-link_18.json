        "text": "Heart of Darkness needs to come to PS Plus Premium. This is by far one of the wildest, most insane, and messed up games I played as a child, and I loved it.\n\nOpinion by Sean Lawson\n\nPublished 14 May 2024\n\nFollowtopics\n\nPlayStation PlusSean Lawson\n\nSo, it turns out that Heart of Darkness wasn't some fever dream I imagined as a child — it really does exist! This PS1 game has you play as a young boy on a mission to save his dog from a strange world filled with monsters that are out to get him. Despite being incredibly dark for a kid's game, I would love to see Heart of Darkness come to PS Plus Premium in the future. It would guarantee it found a spot on our list of the best PS Plus games.\n\nPS1 classic Heart of Darkness should come to PS Plus Premium\n\nHeart of Darkness is a cinematic platform video game developed by French developer Amazing Studio that has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Joseph Conrad novel. Released on PS1 back in 1998, the game has you endure Andy's terrible mission to save his dog from the grotesque shadow-like specters who have kidnapped him.\n\nYou progress through the game by navigating past various environmental hazards, solving puzzles, and by keeping Andy from being killed by all manner of dangers in this unusual world. While you start the game defenseless, eventually you unlock a plasma cannon that can blast your enemies (slowly) with electricity to disintegrate them. You even get some more powers near the end, although I won't spoil them for you.\n\nEven with powers, the game is relentlessly hard, and some of the deaths Andy has to go through are downright disturbing. Yet, I remember having a blast playing this as a six-year-old. The game received an age rating of E (for everybody) in the US and I am truly baffled by how that was possible. I thought the age rating of 11+ was bad enough in the UK.\n\nDepending on how you die, Andy could have his spine snapped, his innards ripped out of him, or he could be eaten alive. The developers didn't skimp on the sound either, which makes these deaths all the more messed up. I guess because none of these deaths featured blood, the ESRB felt the game was at least a little friendlier than Mortal Kombat. However, I can safely say, no — no, it is not. Just watch the death animation montage (embedded below) if you don't believe me.\n\nSo, if the game is that horrid, why would I want it on PS Plus Premium? Well, just because it is messed up, that doesn't mean that it isn't a fantastic game. The puzzles were genuinely interesting, the platforming was a lot of fun, and the horror elements were superbly executed. I have a lot of fond memories of playing Heart of Darkness and I would love the opportunity to revisit it!\n\nI also never finished the game or got to see the ending, so that's one more reason to want this on PS Plus. I don't think I ever made it past the third level as a kid — I think I could do a little better now. Also, if it comes to PS Plus Premium, there is a good chance that there might be trophies attached to it, and we all know I love a good trophy hunt! However, maybe this time around the ESRB might want to bump up the age rating.\n\nDo you guys remember Heart of Darkness? Would you like to see it come to PS Plus? Do you think it would rank high on our list of the best PS Plus Premium games?
