You can help us by expanding it.\n\nHeart of Darkness (ハート オブ ダークネス) is a cinematic platform game released released in 1998 for the PlayStation and Windows PCs.\n\nThe game took six years to develop and went through a number of iterations; in 1996 a Sega Saturn version was advertised (to be published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment), but a release did not materialise. Sega of America struck up a \"limited exclusivity\" deal[12], meaning the game would launch on the Saturn before the PlayStation and PC in 1997[13], however the plans fell through.\n\nIn the end, Interplay published the game in North America and Ocean Software (later Infogrames) published it in Europe.\n\nMagazine articles\n\nMain article: Heart of Darkness/Magazine articles."
