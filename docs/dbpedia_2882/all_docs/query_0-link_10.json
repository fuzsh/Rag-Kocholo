        "text": "This article or section may contain spoilers about the final boss. You might want to avoid reading further if you don't want to spoil the surprise for yourself!\n\nThe Heart of Darkness is\n\nThe human mind, in its complete vastness, is capable of recognizing its utter helplessness and uselessness in the face of inevitable and unavoidable non-existence, but is incapable of coming to terms with it. We can only ever ignore it, hide from it or temporarily escape from it, but the fact is that we are bound to the way of all things. Death is unavoidable, not only to us, but all that exists or ever has existed. Every living being will eventually die out. Every speck of matter will eventually wither away and dissipate into entropy. It doesn't matter if you lived a good life or if you left a legacy behind. It doesn't matter if humanity survives for a thousand years or dies out tomorrow. The end result is the same: the absolute nothing. Human intelligence is far beyond that of other animals, but it would be misguided to consider that a gift. All other beings have the gift of ignorance, of not understanding what we do. Our intelligence is not a gift. It's a flaw. It's an over-extension of evolution. Intelligence, once a great feature in aeons past, continued to grow unchecked and unfiltered, and has since passed a threshold whereupon it is no longer a benefit, but an active danger to its host. Much like the Irish elk, a species of deer that, through uncountable generations of evolution, grew antlers so wide and vast that it could no longer run from predators, eventually leading to extinction. The human mind is an evolutionary maladaptation caused by going too far in one direction that was once beneficial and will, sooner or later, lead to our extinction. On an individual level, it's already happening. Existential dread is already taking hold. I'm sure you've felt it too. The pain and fear of being nothing, becoming nothing. The suffering of understanding that. We are unable to come to terms with it, so we hide from our own intelligence. We set limits. We stop ourselves from thinking deeply about what will happen when we die. We create distractions. We keep our minds busy with mundane activities and entertainment to stop ourselves from having to come face-to-face with the truth. We sublimate it. We transform our self-reflective suffering into another form, art, to keep it from consuming us. Anything to avoid the panic. But these ways are all simply temporary. They’re just there to push back the inevitable veil of helplessness and despair that would encompass and ruin us. In the end, nothing matters. There's no point in trying to find joy in life, for life in and of itself is suffering.\n\nBehavior[ | ]\n\nCome[ | ]\n\nAlthough it may seem that the final boss wantonly decides to make one of your party members instantly die, the skill \"Come Unto Your Maker\" will always trigger on two instances if the conditions are met:\n\nFirst Time: After the boss has been downed to 2/3 of his total health (168 or 202), and your total number of party members is exactly 4.\n\nSecond Time: After you reduce his health bar to 1/3 of its total HP (84 or 101) and your total number of party members is exactly 3.\n\nIf you are able to cross both thresholds with one set of blows without killing the boss, it will cause him to trigger Come Unto Your Maker two consecutive times if you have a full party.\n\nThat means that after your characters inflict a blow that reduces the boss' HP under said thresholds, it will immediately deal a deathblow to one or more of your party members on his next turn[1]. It should also be noted that stunning is also not an effective prevention method.\n\nThere is only one way to stop the Heart of Darkness from using the ability, which is detailed in \"Surviving Come Unto Your Maker\".\n\nDissolution, Puncture, Know This[ | ]\n\nEach one of these skills inflicts a different status ailment. \"Know This\", being a stress attack, will prioritize already stressed-out heroes, while the other two are based on your Heroes' resistances:\n\nDissolution: Prioritizes heroes with either low Stun or low Blight resistance.\n\nPuncture: Prioritizes heroes with low Bleed resistance.\n\nCooldown Feature: Every skill may not be used twice in a row. That means that after the first turn, the number of skills (not including insta-death) are reduced to two.\n\nStrategy[ | ]\n\nAs mentioned above, this fight will get progressively harder as you reduce the enemy's HP and therefore lose more party members. The exact amount of HP for every one hit KO are 170 and 83 HP. Although it is impossible to exactly predict the exact amount of damage your heroes deal, it should be in your best interests to make the member who is about to be sacrificed deal the last blow to optimize damage output. Beware that if the HoD reaches the HP threshold on its turn due to DoT, it will still cast \"Come Unto Your Maker\".\n\nAnother thing worth noting is if you kill the previous phase instead of letting it shift to the final form, the excess of damage dealt to that form will carry over and be dealt to the Heart of Darkness, thereby starting the fight effectively with less extra HP.\n\nIf you are using healers or other support characters like a buffing/stress reducing Jester, it would be advisable to let them die first, while letting your main damage dealers focus on the Heart of Darkness for the second and third parts of the fight.\n\nIn essence, this is pretty much a rush-down boss-fight. You will want to deal as much damage as fast as possible, especially during the last third of the fight where you will only have 2 heroes available. Skills that benefit from marking are therefore invaluable for dealing high amounts of burst damage.\n\nDuring the early portion of the third part of the fight, you may want to consider healing up/reducing the stress on afflicted heroes, as his attacks, while powerful, will not usually put your characters immediately on death's door. Due to the Heart of Darkness's relatively low Stun resistance, this would be an ideal time for stalling time and recovering.\n\nConsidering this boss's mechanics, you may make your last heroes have lower bleed than blight resistance, as his blight attack can also trigger the stun effect.\n\nThe Heart appears to restore one action by killing anyone by other skills than \"Come Unto Your Maker\". This may be a glitch.\n\nAs the battle progresses, you should become more aggressive, since this is the last mission and no retreat is possible. Moreover, the fewer characters you have, the less you will be able to keep up with the Heart of Darkness's onslaught.\n\nIf you manage to defeat the Heart of Darkness, congratulations! You will be greeted with a cinematic epilogue and have beaten the game.\n\nGood luck and keep your guard up!\n\nAbilities[ | ]\n\nDarkest Level Skill Name Range Rank Target Accuracy Crit\n\nChance Damage Effect\n\n(Target) Effect\n\n(Self) Notes Come Unto Your Maker Ranged 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.* 223.75% but impossible to dodge% 12% 11-23 Instant Deathblow** No Effect Know This Melee 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 113.75% 0% 0 Stress +22 (24 on Stygian) No Effect Puncture Ranged 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 113.75% 12% 13-16 150% Bleed 5 (6 on Stygian)\n\nStress +10 (12 on Stygian) No Effect Dissolution Ranged 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 113.75% 12% 13-16 160% Stun\n\n150% Blight 5 (6 on Stygian)\n\nStress +10 (12 on Stygian) No Effect\n\n* The player chooses the target for Come Unto Your Maker.\n\n** Come Unto Your Maker kills a target instantly, bypassing HP and Deathblow Resist.\n\nSurviving Come Unto Your Maker[ | ]\n\nAs it is used at 2/3 and 1/3 health, with careful manipulation of the boss's mechanics, it is possible to circumvent Come Unto Your Maker if you can destroy the Heart in one fell swoop before it reaches one of those HP thresholds. The best way to do this is to equip powerful +DMG and/or +CRT on someone that can hit extremely hard (Leper is ideal), whittle the Heart down to 2/3 or 1/3 health, while stacking buffs on a hard hitting character, or stack defence-reducing debuffs on the Heart, and then hit them for one massive, shattering blow.\n\nWhile saving one character by surpassing the second Maker is relatively trivial, saving everyone is far, far harder. It requires absolute precision calculation, best in slot gear, and a lucky crit to have all four of your characters walk out alive, and if you fail, you will likely endure back-to-back instant deaths from pushing the Heart to low HP. The first documented instance of an \"Everybody Lives\" was achieved by three Plague Doctors stacking Emboldening Vapours on a Leper, while the Leper stacked Revenge on himself, resulting in a 268% damage buff and obliterating the Heart with a fatal critical hit of 173.\n\nThe second way of achieving this incredible goal is documented in this video, done by buffing the Jester with two Plague Doctors, one Man-at-Arms and four uses of Shard Dust, resulting in a destructive 199 damage critical hit. Note that a second Man-at-Arms can add more damage than a second plague doctor while making it easier to use solo to further increase finale damage without losing any jester turns to positioning (using solo then having the Men-at-Arms move forward in front of the jester more than 3 turns before the finale).\n\nIt is also possible to embark on this quest with just two characters, circumventing Come Unto Your Maker completely. However, this makes the Ancestor fight much harder, as both heroes would need to be able to heal each other and still do enough damage to prevail. One possible combination is a Hellion for damage, supported by a Flagellant for healing health and stress. Such a feat was demonstrated by youtuber Fourtwoflow, who also defeated the HoD with a Leper and a Crusader, two heroes who can heal themselves and inflict high damage; the task was heavily aided by the presence of virtues, which was induced by Hero's Rings and the Valiant Spirit town event (65% virtue chance, though the Crusader can reset stress to 0, should an affliction be drawn instead of a virtue). This method is, oddly enough, less luck dependant than bringing the entire 4-man party. It is also possible to beat the Heart with the Houndmaster and the Flagellant, having the former constantly guarding the latter and dodging almost all hits, while the second stage AoE attacks will still hit the Flagellant and make him use his low HP skills. Another possible 2-man party capable of defeating the Heart consists of the Crusader and the Highwayman, with the Crusader as the main healer and de-stresser and Highwayman as the main damage dealer, especially thanks to his riposte.\n\nThe two-hero strategy becomes trivial with Shard Dust from the The Color of Madness DLC. A Bolster-stacking Man-at-Arms, along with some relatively common dodge trinkets, can reduce enemies' hit chance to the minimum of 5%. This effectively neutralizes any danger, allowing you to deal with the boss at your leisure. The Crusader is an ideal partner in this case—the repeated use of Shard Dust incurs large penalties to stress, and the Crusader is the only hero who can stress heal (and heal) from the front ranks.\n\nRelated Enemies[ | ]\n\nCreatures from the Darkest Dungeon[ | ]\n\nAscended Brawler\n\nAscended Witch\n\nRapturous Cultist\n\nCultist Priest\n\nMalignant Growth\n\nDefensive Growth\n\nFlesh Hound\n\nPolyp\n\nTemplar Gladiator\n\nTemplar Sniper\n\nAntibody\n\nBosses[ | ]\n\nTemplar Impaler\n\nTemplar Warlord\n\nMammoth Cyst\n\nWhite Cell Stalk\n\nShuffling Horror\n\nAncestor\n\nPerfect Reflection\n\nImperfect Reflection\n\nAbsolute Nothingness\n\nGestating Heart\n\nGallery[ | ]\n\nHeart of Darkness's combat animation\n\nHeart of Darkness using Come Unto Your Maker and Know This\n\nHeart of Darkness using Dissolution\n\nHeart of Darkness using Puncture\n\nHeart of Darkness defending\n\nTrivia[ | ]\n\nWhile the name \"Heart of Darkness\" is a reference to Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness, the creature itself is a reference to Nssu-Ghahnb/The Heart of Ages from the Call of Cthulhu Role-Playing Game. This is supported by Nssu-Ghahnb being trapped within an alternate dimension and being responsible for spawning all the monsters in the known universe, just like the Heart of Darkness.\n\nHeart of Darkness seems to be restoring one action per every killed person with a skill other than \"Come Unto Your Maker\". If it does so it will use two different skills in one round and the third in the second forcing it to pass its turn, because all of its regular skills are cooling down. It is possible that this feature is a glitch, because the sound effect of passing its turn is anticlimactic and reveals that the boss has its fear reversing limits.\n\nIt is believed by some that the monologue in the gloomy and baleful ending, which includes similar imagery to the opening cinematic and concluded by the lines \"Ruin has come to our family\" implies that you, the in-game direct blood relative, will be directly responsible for the rebirth of this great and terrible evil at some point in the future. However, the earliest verses of the monologue establishes the understanding of the thing as the originator of all Earthly life; furthermore, it continues with the line \"The great family of man.\" As such, any subsequent lines- including that signature quote- referring to family and lineage actually refers to Earthly life as a whole, not just your bloodline."
