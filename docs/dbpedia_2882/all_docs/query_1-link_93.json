        "text": "After being announced last year, new evidence suggests Ubisoft’s Beyond Good & Evil remaster might about to be released.\n\nWhile we’ve heard nothing about Ubisoft’s Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition since it was awkwardly revealed last year, all signs are pointing to an imminent shadow drop.\n\nAn early version of the remaster leaked in November before it was officially announced in a tweet, with Ubisoft stating at the time that it would come out in ‘early 2024’.\n\nWe might be beyond the ‘early’ window at this point, but there’s mounting evidence to suggest the revamped version could be released very soon.\n\nAs spotted by Exophase, which tracks achievements and trophies across Xbox, PlayStation and PC platforms, PlayStation trophies for Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition have appeared online. There are 35 trophies listed in total, including a platinum.\n\nAt the same time, a patch for the PlayStation 4 version was also discovered in the backend of PlayStation Network, which suggests it is primed and ready to be released.\n\nConsidering Ubisoft didn’t announce anything about Beyond Good & Evil at its own recent Ubisoft Forward presentation, the obvious assumption is that it could be shadow dropped during the Nintendo Direct – which is rumoured to take place next week.\n\nThere’s backend rumblings around other titles which could be shown at the event too, with the House Of The Dead 2 remake recently being rated for Nintendo Switch in Europe. The remake was originally announced back in 2019.\n\nThe original Beyond Good & Evil was released across the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube in 2003 (so this 20th anniversary edition is, technically, a year late). A remastered version was released in 2011, but this sounds like it will be a more comprehensive overhaul.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil is an action-adventure title where you play as Jade, an investigative reporter who joins a resistance movement to uncover an evil alien conspiracy. It combines stealth and puzzle-solving, as you try to snap photographic evidence with your camera.\n\nA sequel has been stuck in development hell since it was announced in 2017, with no word since on a release date.\n\nEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, follow us on Twitter, and sign-up to our newsletter.\n\nTo submit Inbox letters and Reader’s Features more easily, without the need to send an email, just use our Submit Stuff page here.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our Gaming page.\n\nMORE : XDefiant matchmaking still doesn’t work as Ubisoft posts update\n\nMORE : Assassin’s Creed Shadows release date leaked… by Ubisoft\n\nMORE : The Division Heartland cancelled as Ubisoft lays off 1,700 people in 18 months"
