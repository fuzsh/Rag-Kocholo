        "text": "So with the recent rumour that 'Gods and Monsters' has changed its names to 'Immortals: Fenyx Rising' the phenomena of games having subtitles added on to perfectly-adequate names seems to be continuing. Note that I'm not really referring to games which are part of an ongoing franchise (e.g. Deus Ex: Human Revolution, XCOM: Enemy Unknown), but first instalments in game franchises that may-or-may-not get sequels. The games I'm talking about could almost always work with one of their two titles as the other rarely adds proper context, and often just re-iterates what the initial main title implied.\n\nHere's some examples:\n\nFall Guys: Ultimate Knockout\n\nDetroit: Become Human\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence\n\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League\n\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice\n\nStarlink: Battle for Atlas\n\nHalo: Combat Evolved\n\nRIOT: Civil Unrest\n\nHalo 5: Guardians (I know it's a sequel but... why???)\n\nI'm sure there's many more.\n\nNow what does Era think of this? Of course it's not a big deal but, at the end of the day, do you feel that these subtitles enhance or detract from the general titles of the game (or do you think the subtitles could have been the title of the game)?\n\nFor me personally I see it as one of the most weird things that the gaming industry does. No other mediums add random unnecessary subtitles on to their main titles and, when they do have subtitles, it's something to clearly denote that it is part of a franchise. Even then that's very rare, as even something like Star Wars didn't have \"Episode IV: A New Hope,\" in its initial theatrical run. I mean, lets take some famous pieces of media and put them into this formula:\n\nInception: Dreams Explored\n\nNo Country for Old Men: Fate\n\nBreaking Bad: Crime Doesn't Pay\n\nFamily: The Godfather\n\nLord of the Flies: Innocence\n\n1984: Ignorance is Strength\n\nThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\n\n...and so on. They just sound unnatural, right? So why does gaming love doing it so much?\n\nSubtitles exist because game marketers want to have it both ways. They want to have a short, snappy brand that passes the let's-play-blank test (\"let's play Immortals\"), but one word doesn't give you a ton of room to be very evocative, so they add a subtitle to \"explain\" the title. And that's how you get Starlink: Battle for Atlas and Halo: Combat Evolved. Or else they don't add a subtitle, and then you have a title like Destiny or Anthem or Valorant that conveys very little meaning besides sounding suitably \"epic.\" These titles are empty vessels; they could literally apply to almost any game, but with enough advertising spend, that doesn't matter.\n\nA lot of movies have subtitles (just look at the Terminator or Transformers franchises) but generally only for sequels.\n\nSubtitles exist because game marketers want to have it both ways.

However I feel that a lot of the time it barely does anything to really explain the title. Like what does \"Battle for Atlas\" mean? They're battling for Atlas... OK? What's Atlas and why should I care? Same goes for many others I listed, which is why I do find them quite unnecessary lol\n\nSubtitles in movies are different as, like you said, they don't tend to happen until sequels. Off the top of my head I can only really think of is 2001: A Space Odyssey when it comes to standalone films with subtitles explaining what they meant.\n\nI don't understand why ya'll care so much about titles like this.\n\nI don't, but since this is a video game forum I thought it would be an interesting thing to talk about.\n\nSo with the recent rumour that 'Gods and Monsters' has changed its names to 'Immortals: Fenyx Rising' the phenomena of games having subtitles added on to perfectly-adequate names seems to be continuing.

They just sound unnatural, right? So why does gaming love doing it so much?\n\nYour examples sound unnatural because they were quickly made subtitles.\n\nI think the Detroit and Suicide Squad ones work though.\n\n\"Detroit\" can be absolutely anything, from a car game to a open world crime game etc.\n\n\"Suicide Squad\", \"mmm is that a movie tie in? ughh\"\n\nTheir subtitles at least give them something.\n\nI think Detroit might have worked better if it were just \"Become Human.\" The game itself barely has anything to do with Detroit beside being set there (and maybe the vague connection between the android industry and the car industry, I don't know).\n\nI put that one in as a joke...\n\nFall Guys: Ultimate Knockout\n\nDetroit: Become Human\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence\n\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League\n\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice\n\nStarlink: Battle for Atlas\n\nHalo: Combat Evolved\n\nRIOT: Civil Unrest\n\nHalo 5: Guardians (I know it's a sequel but... why???)\n\nDetroit: Become Human makes sense for a vignetted story about humanity set within Detroit.\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence is rumoured to be getting a sequel. Maybe it's an anthology series so the followup could be called something like A Plague Tale: Hope or A Plague Tale: Despair.\n\nI'm not a fan of Suicide Squad's subtitle but it does at least differentiate the brand from the godawful movie that is likely still fresh in a lot of people's minds.\n\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice is directly related to the story and mechanics of that game.\n\nHalo: Combat Evolved was a fittingly confident statement about the strength and potential of the franchise on the industry. It changed everything for console FPSs, this subtitle is fine.\n\nYour other examples are fine though.\n\nBeyond: Two Souls was a very stupid title\n\nFor a lot I thought it was Beyond Two Souls, as in \"we are beyond just two souls\", but it has the two little points in the middle.\n\nChoos your title, game! It's Beyond, or it's Two Souls?\n\nMost of the time, just the title or the subtitle are better than the sum of the two.\n\nI just called it The Ellen Page Game, which would have been an amazing title.\n\nYeah, I can see why they'd have it. However I feel that a lot of the time it barely does anything to really explain the title. Like what does \"Battle for Atlas\" mean? They're battling for Atlas... OK? What's Atlas and why should I care?\n\nYou're not expected to know who or what Atlas is. It's just meant to sound exciting, and to let you know it's a combat game. Without it, \"Starlink\" could just as easily be a title for a match-3 puzzle game.\n\nNow, you could say, jaggies, surely all the rest of the marketing materials would make it clear that Starlink isn't a match-3 puzzle game? And you'd be right, which is why more confident companies who are planning huge ad spends can \"get away\" with riskier titles like \"Starfield.\" But if you're not as confident in your vision or your ability to build a brand that has equity with the game-buying public, it's easier to give in to the marketing folks who say you have to add an explanatory subtitle to beat people over the head with what the game is.\n\nSubtitles exist because game marketers want to have it both ways. They want to have a short, snappy brand that passes the let's-play-blank test (\"let's play Immortals\"), but one word doesn't give you a ton of room to be very evocative, so they add a subtitle to \"explain\" the title.

Marketers want to have their cake and eat it. Happens all the time in business too, where people come up with a short, snappy, meaningless name for a product or service or whatever that they then need to supplement with a prosaic strapline almost every time it's used so people understand what the hell the damn thing actually is."
