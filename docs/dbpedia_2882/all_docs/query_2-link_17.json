        "text": "Novelizations of games are common, but how often does it work the other way around? It turns out more often than you might think.\n\nThe increasingly popular Witcher game franchise is widely known as a book adaptation, but it's far from the only example.\n\nBelow are 11 beloved video games based on (or heavily influenced by) works of literature:\n\nThe Witcher\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe Witcher is based on The Witcher book series by Andrzej Sapkowski, which started out first as a collection of short stories. The success of The Saga, the full-length novels following the short stories, landed Sapkowski and his series cult classic status mainly in Poland. It wasn’t until The Witcher’s video game adaptation in 2007 that other readers around the world began to take notice.\n\nBoth The Witcher stories and games feature the same cast of characters, but take place years after the events of The Saga. There are five total books in the original saga written between 1994 and 1999, two of which are still being translated into English, and a sixth written in 2013 that serves as a prequel to the first book.\n\nStalker\n\nSTALKER (or S.T.A.L.K.E.R. if you insist) is a series of first-person shooters by GSC Game World, based loosely on the world created by brothers Boris and Arkady Strugatsky in their 1972 novel Roadside Picnic. The novel follows the story of Redrick \"Red\" Schuhart, an experienced stalker who ventures into the Zone to find valuable artifacts he can sell.\n\nIn the novel Roadside Picnic, the Zones are restricted areas visited and then abandoned by aliens years prior. The nature of the extraterrestrial visits left the Zones riddled with mysterious, supernatural properties that make them very dangerous to enter.\n\nThe STALKER games are also influenced by the film Stalker, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky and itself loosely based on Roadside Picnic. If you want to overcomplicate things, the Strugatskys also wrote a book called Stalker based on a screenplay of the film Stalker that was based on their first book. (There was even a play and a tabletop RPG!)\n\nAll this to say, the world of STALKER has some rich media to pull from and we should totally get a new STALKER game please. PLEASE.\n\nParasite Eve\n\nParasite Eve is an interesting one because it’s an example of a video game that serves as a sequel to the book it’s based on. The 1995 novel Parasite Eve was written by pharmacologist Hideaki Sena and will make you scared of your own cells… or bore you with an abundance of medical terminology.\n\nEither way, Parasite Eve’s bizarre exploration of human biology is not something commonly found in the horror genre beyond notable names like Crichton and Cronenberg. Body horror is one thing. Biochemical horror where sentient mitochondria can birth beings with the ability to write their own genetic code is an entirely different realm.\n\nI Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\n\nSpeaking of scary, all-powerful beings, Harlan Ellison’s 1967 short story I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, the obvious basis for the adventure game of the same name, arguably has the worst.\n\nLike the game, the Hugo-award winning tale stars a sentient supercomputer called AM, which is actually three powerful machines merged into one very angry, humanity-hating mastercomputer. One day, AM ditched its designed purpose of waging World War III and single-handedly wittled the entire human race down to just five people, who it’s already spent years torturing when the story begins.\n\nHAL 9000, GLaDOS, and SHODAN are like Playskool computers compared to AM. Seriously. That guy sucks.\n\nAssassin’s Creed\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nA lot of the games we’ve looked at so far are more or less direct adaptations of a book, but there are plenty of original games that still owe several of their ideas to works of literature. Assassin’s Creed is one of them.\n\nAccording to producer Jade Raymond, the first Assassin’s Creed was inspired by the 1938 novel Alamut by Vladimir Bartol. The novel is set in Alamut, which was a real Persian fortress located about 60 miles from what is now present-day Tehran.\n\nIn the early 11th century, the Alamut fortress was controlled by a missionary named Hassan-i Sabbah and his Assassins, all historical facts used in the novel Alamut and then adapted into the Assassin’s Creed universe.\n\nA line in the novel Alamut, “Nothing is an absolute reality, all is permitted,” is used nearly word for word in the game: “Nothing is true, everything is permitted.”\n\nMinus the sci-fi elements, Assassin’s Creed is historical fiction, so it makes sense that the book it’s based on is also rooted in history.\n\nBioShock\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nI’m willing to bet most of you already knew this, but in case you didn’t… Ayn Rand is all over BioShock. The city of Rapture was founded on the principle of pure self-interest, the same idea that fuels Rand’s objectivist philosophy.\n\nAndrew Ryan himself is basically named after Ayn Rand. Similarly, you have Frank Fontaine, named after Rand’s novel The Fountainhead, and Atlas, named for Rand’s novel Atlas Shrugged. Posters found around the game ask “Who is Atlas?” just like the repeated “Who is John Galt?” line from Atlas Shrugged.\n\nWe can go on and on with the details, but more broadly, BioShock is an exploration of Ayn Rand’s philosophies and a critical critique of how absurdly bad things can get if objectivism is applied on a grand (albeit fantastical) scale.\n\nMetro 2033\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nSurvival horror shooter Metro 2033 has its roots in a 2005 novel of the same name by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky. Like the game, the novel takes place in the subway system of a post-apocalyptic Moscow, devastated by nuclear holocaust. The player-character Artyom is the same as the protagonist in the novel, one of several characters who appears in both the game and the book.\n\nThe book Metro 2033 was published in the United States in 2010, the same year the game launched. Unlike most of the games on this list, Glukhovsky himself has a writing credit for both his book and the video game adaptation.\n\nThe Dark Eye\n\nI interrupt this list of video games we’ve all heard of to bring you a really weird computer horror adventure from 1995. The Dark Eye lets you explore, from multiple points of view, three Edgar Allan Poe stories: The Tell-Tale Heart, The Cask of Amontillado, and Berenice.\n\nA lot of the horror in The Dark Eye is owed to its unusual visual style as much as Poe's nightmarish tales: a mix of eerie, pre-rendered CGI backdrops and unsettling claymation characters that add an element of uncanny realness to the rigid 90s graphics.\n\nTo add to what a bizarre gem The Dark Eye is, the game also features voice acting by famous Beat-era writer William S. Burroughs, famous for his novel Naked Lunch. It was also developed by Inscape, a long-defunct game publisher responsible for Bad Day at the Midway, the 1995 adventure game based on avant-garde music group The Residents.\n\nBloodborne\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nBloodborne is like BioShock in the way it borrows elements from an author’s body of work rather than directly adapting a single story. While it was Ayn Rand for BioShock, it’s H.P. Lovecraft for Bloodborne.\n\nIt’s easy to go blindly into the cold and ghastly streets of Yharnam thinking you’re just going to get another standard Gothic horror with witches and werewolves, but Bloodborne takes you by surprise by throwing in some interdimensional cosmic beings, eldritch gods, and other manners of unearthly, Lovecraftian horrors.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nI picked Bloodborne for this list because it’s the most current example of a video game adapting elements of Lovecraft’s famous brand of horror, but I’m going to dedicate this entry to the trove of games inspired by Lovecraft’s work. There’s Amnesia: The Dark Descent and Frictional’s earlier Penumbra series, Eternal Darkness, Alone in the Dark, Scratches, Prisoner of Ice, The Last Door, Eldritch, and obviously the Call of Cthulhu series. The list goes on.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nSpec Ops: The Line takes the premise of the 1899 novella Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad and applies it to a completely different era and setting, much like what the 1979 film adaptation Apocalypse Now did with the same book.\n\nWhile Heart of Darkness was set in the Congo in the late 19th century and Apocalypse Now was set in Vietnam during the Vietnam War in 1969, Spec Ops: The Line takes things into the near future in a sandstorm-wrecked Dubai.\n\nThe game follows a group of soldiers trying to track down survivors in the aftermath of the disaster, including Colonel John Konrad, based on the infamous Kurtz from Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now… things take off from there.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nSome might protest The Binding of Isaac being on this list, but it’s very obviously rooted in the Bible… which is only the most widely read book in the world.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac might also be one of the few video games based on the Bible that isn’t a poorly made RPG or retro side-scroller, an educational game, or that one weird RTS based on the Left Behind books. (Hey, another game based on a book series.)\n\nObviously, The Binding of Isaac and its remake are based on the Old Testament story of the same name, where God asks Abraham to kill his son Isaac as a way to test his faith. In the game, Isaac’s dad is replaced by an abusive mother. Several items, playable characters, and bosses in the game are also based on stories from the Bible, presented in a way that makes it kind of obvious what designer Edmund McMillen’s stance on it all is… there’s a reason Nintendo was so iffy about bringing it to its platforms in the past.\n\nSo Many More\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe 11 games on this list are only a sampling of the games based on or inspired by books.\n\nThere are also the Tom Clancy games, Sherlock Holmes games, and Lord of the Rings games, including the recent Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. (Let’s not also forget Shadows of Mordor, the 1987 text-based adventure.)\n\nThere’s Neuromancer, based on William Gibson’s Neuromancer, and even mobile games like 80 Days, inspired by Jules Verne’s Around the World in Eighty Days. You have The Godfather games, the Alice games, and the several games based on China’s famous Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\n\nWhen you bring comics into the mix, we have The Walking Dead games, countless superhero games, and one of my personal favorites, The Darkness.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite games either adapted from or inspired by books?"
