        "text": "Steam Deck impressions:\n\nPositives\n\n- Overall runs nicely at 1080p at a solid 60fps at 10tdp, including during the initial fight underground beneath the lighthouse and with the first open world fight against the big Domz creature. I had a couple of drops in the main canal to 50fps but I could probably offset that by not limiting TDP or by dropping to 720p.\n\n- New texture work and models look great\n\n- some re-done color palettes, but no major changes that alter the visual tone of the game\n\n- Re-recorded score is quite nice, though it's definitely changed enough that I notice it\n\n- Lovely open world water shader, which was something I was worried about them nailing the vibe - the original game's water was heavenly.\n\n- Auto save is a great addition to the game\n\n- Controls well; the camera never bothered me in the original game but glad the option exists for people now to change it\n\nMixed/negatives\n\n- There is no resolution option I can find in the menu system, struggling to see where the previous posters found it; maybe the Steam and Ubi versions are different? There are high/low graphics options, but no resolution option; I've just been setting from the Steam properties.\n\n- Initially when I booted it up it seemed to be in a squashed aspect ratio and I had to use the ... settings to stretch it. A reboot seemed to fix that.\n\n- No 90fps support.\n\n- No apparent 16:10 support\n\n- Load times are honestly not as short as I was expecting them to be for a modern port of this game\n\n- Install size has gone from <2GB with the now-delisted steam version to 16GB, which I'm sure is mainly the upgraded textures\n\n- Only one manual save slot vs. multiple in the original game, for... reasons? This is the kind of game where it's nice to have a few saves at various points to revisit but I guess not.\n\n- requires Ubisoft connect log in at first boot up, including installation Ubi connect and entering your credentials, but then not again on subsequent boots. I don't think you have to be online but haven't verified. It asked for my key on initial Boot up, but I just exited and fired it up again and it recognized the key I already have. Ubi games have been doing that to me on deck recently in first installation.\n\nOverall, given the changes, it's a nice upgrade and worth it for existing fans at 20 USD, and absolutely for first timers. It's just not as full featured as a modern PC game should be. I'm glad I have my original version but don't think I'll need to roll it out any time soon.\n\nPlayed for a few minutes. Impressions:\n\n- They put a lot of work into this given the asking price. It only really hits how big the visual facelift is when you go back to the original. New texturework and lighting is sublime and captures what you remember the original looking like for the most part. Only nitpick is Jade's new hair texture, hope that gets modded out at some point, the original looked really good and stylistic.\n\n- The new camera control is great. Feels like a modern game in that respect. New control scheme in general is solid.\n\n- I like that button glyphs look like they fit the rest of the game.\n\n- God I forgot just how good the intro to this game is. No nonsense, right into the action, crazy backflips and slowmo.\n\n- No shader stutter, locked 60 fps, basic resolution options, forced vsync and fullscreen as far as I can tell. Wouldn't expect ultrawide or other aspect ratios out of the box.\n\n- Subtitle timing is a little iffy, saw some disappear before I felt they should have but I seem to remember this was an issue in the original too. Similar kinda iffy lip sync but looking at some old footage it looks about the same. Memory playing tricks perhaps.\n\n- Not seeing any challenges or achievements listen in Ubisoft Connect, maybe they forgot to add them because they're not in the Steam panel either. My Rayman Legends Steam/Ubisoft connect copies both share achievements by comparison.\n\nLooking forward to playing more.\n\nSteam Deck impressions:\n\nPositives\n\n- Overall runs nicely at 1080p at a solid 60fps at 10tdp, including during the initial fight underground beneath the lighthouse and with the first open world fight against the big Domz creature.

I'm glad I have my original version but don't think I'll need to roll it out any time soon.\n\nResolution option is in general for some reason.\n\nAnyone knows if Steam version requires Ubisoft Connect ? I'm talking about the launcher, not UBI account, to be clear.\n\nLike all Ubisoft games (and similar to EA for example) it will bind the game to your ubisoft account on first launch and you will need to log in. Ubisoft Connect needs to be opened (and, surprisingly, clicking play on Steam doesn't automatically open the launcher itself -- on older versions of Ubisoft Connect at least the launcher would run automatically in the background).\n\nThe game runs fine in offline mode on both clients though."
