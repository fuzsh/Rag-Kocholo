        "text": "Heart of Darkness\n\nAlpha Stage\n\nHeart of Darkness is a role-playing desktop game, currently in early development stages. It tells the story of a notoriously evil mythical creature Minotaur, with aid of his mobs, attacks the land of [the hero] and kidnaps their people. The hero, simply known as the Player, is a self-contained knight who seeks neither help nor trouble for his people, discovers his wife's disappearance, and heads to look for her, with the aid of a longtime wanted robber and amateur criminal, Alexandro.\n\nUpon the discovery of a massacre, the story takes a turning point and the journey changes radically.\n\nControls\n\nThe game controls are the classic WASD for movement, and mouse for aiming and attacking.\n\nFeatures\n\nTwo players: the Knight, and Alexandro\n\nMultiple weapons and Special Effects\n\n7 levels each with 5 checkpoints\n\n8 enemy types\n\n5 bosses (might be 7 in the future)\n\nChallenges and puzzles\n\nStoryline and dialogue\n\nCutscenes\n\napproximately 1-3 hours of gameplay time (calculated from the storyline, I will update it when solid results are made.)\n\nmany more soon to be listed\n\nUpdate 0.0.1\n\nRPG system\n\nMelee attack system\n\nEnemies\n\nScreen shake and Special Effects\n\nother more\n\nUpdate 0.0.2\n\nExploding Imps\n\nFixed depth issues with player and weapon\n\nVideos\n\nThe first video of the development series, so far just an RPG system and sound/special effects.\n\nHeart of Darkness is in early development stages, please follow the development on Twitter and GameMaker: Forum, as well as here on itch.io.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/i/web/status/1310093866691948546\n\nDeveloped by BiTrunade, made with GameMaker: Studio.\n\nWebsite: https://bitrunade.com/\n\nDiscord: BiTrunade#2059\n\nItch.io: https://bitrunade.itch.io/\n\nGameMaker: Marketplace: https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/publishers/3040/bitrunade\n\nThank you very much.\n\nAdded a Chasing Goblin into the game!\n\nOne of the enemies/challenges of the game is the quest to steal an item (e.g. a crystal) from a guard goblin and deliver it to a targeted position. The goblin chases you down until either you deliver it (and he dies) or he takes it from you and runs back.\n\nObstacles get created when you steal it, you can destroy them but they slow you down. Although you might have destroyed them, they get back created again once the item is returned.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/i/web/status/1311011487322902530"
