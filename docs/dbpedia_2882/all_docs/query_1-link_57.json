        "text": "When Ubisoft officially unveiled the Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition last week, many fans immediately brought up Beyond Good & Evil 2.\n\nThe game was first announced in 2016, and has since been in development hell. It has seen multiple restarts and management changes that has led many fans to just assume that it’s not coming. However, Ubisoft confirmed on Monday that Beyond Good & Evil 2 is still on the way.\n\n“Yes, Beyond Good & Evil 2 is still in development, and we cannot wait for you to discover more about Jade’s past in the 20th Anniversary Edition,” the studio said via the game’s official Twitter account.\n\nObviously a simple post like that doesn’t answer any major questions about the state of the game. That said, it’s at least something to know that it hasn’t been abandoned after a decade in development. When fans will hear anything more about the prequel title remains to be seen.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary launches on June 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Nintendo Switch.\n\nDo you think Ubisoft will ever release Beyond Good & Evil 2?
