        "text": "Welcome to another instalment of the Eurogamer.net Podcast - probably the only UK gaming podcast where you can hear people pausing at one point because there are sirens going off outside the window.\n\nThat's not the only unique feature of today's episode, however, because this week Black Rock Studios' Nick Baynes, who is game director on Split/Second: Velocity, joins host Tom Champion and regulars Tom Bramwell and Oli Welsh.\n\nDownload Eurogamer.net Podcast #14 as an MP3.\n\nEurogamer.net Podcast on iTunes.\n\nEurogamer.net Podcast RSS feed.\n\nStream the Eurogamer.net Podcast:\n\nDownload the podcast\n\nNaturally we take the opportunity to put your questions about Split/Second to Nick, who politely and candidly addresses things like rubber-banding AI, why the game now has a subtitle, and whether all the myriad UK racing studios ever get together in the woods and have a fight.\n\nWe also talk about Blur, which is out at the same time as Split/Second in May, and recent events in the news - that bloke who got sacked for putting a Rockstar PR email on Facebook, Hideo Kojima's crystal ball, and of course the announcement that Vince Zampella and Jason West have founded a studio called Respawn and got into bed with EA. (Please note: our discussion was recorded prior to last night's interview with the pair.)\n\nNick and the gang also contemplate the new Digital Economy Bill and what it may mean for developers, publishers and journalists. All apart from Brammers, that is, who was on his first day back from holiday and hadn't read the bill yet, so came off looking like an idiot (again).\n\nThanks to a last-minute intervention from friend-of-the-podcast Jem Alexander of the PlayStation Blog, we even had some redeemable PSN codes to give away.\n\nBackground reading!\n\nSplit/Second: Velocity hands-on preview\n\nBlur hands-on prevew\n\nRespawn's Jason West and Vince Zampella interview\n\nHideo Kojima predicts console-free future\n\nSacked journo hits out at Rockstar\n\nThe Eurogamer.net Podcast goes out every Tuesday at 3pm GMT. Join us next week for additional exciting discussion about games and gaming news, and even more exclusive insight into the squeakiness of the EG office chairs."
