CLASSIFICATION, EXTREMOPHILE. SERVICES REQUIRED. CONTRACT FOLLOWS.\n\nAWAITING ACKNOWLEDGMENT…\n\nThe company found a new lifeform, and they want you to study it. Their offer’s uncharacteristically generous—you catalog this organism, determine how they can use it, and bring it back so they can slap their patent on it. Fairly routine stuff. In exchange, they’ll hook you up with a cushy corporate department head position, secure you a book deal, and make sure the institute of your choice gives you tenure. Did I mention the money? There’s a lot of it. Simple survey, sample, and analysis job. Seemed too good to be true.\n\nOf course it is.\n\n© 2022 20th Century Studios."
