        "text": "This week saw the return of Jade, Pey'j and friends in Beyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition and while it's well worth celebrating this special occasion, many fans are now wondering what's going on with Beyond Good and Evil 2, which was announced a lifetime ago.\n\nIn an official update earlier this week, the game's social media account confirmed that \"yes\" - the second game is \"still in development\". This confirmation was attached to a message about the new Anniversary Edition of the first game:\n\nUbisoft: \"Yes, Beyond Good & Evil 2 is still in development, and we cannot wait for you to discover more about Jade's past in the 20th Anniversary Edition!\"\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 is a prequel to the original game, and the Anniversary Edition of the first game actually includes a new treasure hunt that unlocks cosmetic rewards that \"tie into Jade's past - and to the pirates of Beyond Good and Evil 2\".\n\nThe second title was originally teased by Ubisoft in 2008, with a brief trailer featuring Jade and Pey'j. Nearly a decade later at E3 in 2017, the game got a world premiere cinematic trailer, featuring two other characters. Since then, the director Michael Ancel has exited and last year the game's designer and creative director Emile Morel passed away.\n\nIf you didn't catch Beyond Good & Evil during the GameCube generation, be sure to check out our review of the Anniversary Edition for the Switch:"
