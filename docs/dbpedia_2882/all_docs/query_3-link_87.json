        "text": "F\n\nThe rationale behind movies based on video games, I must confess, has always eluded me. The whole point of the games, after all, is their interactivity–the ability of users to become part of the plot and determine the outcome with their skill. But while there have been occasional efforts to create an interactive film, they’ve all proven disastrous failures; so it seems that devotees of the software are meant to be satisfied with seeing a simulacrum of the activity they participate in on their home screens played out in front of them in theatres. Is it really enough for the characters in a game to be played by actors on the big screen to attract the game’s aficionados? Not always, of course–remember the fate of “Super Mario Brothers.” But things were different with “Resident Evil.” The first movie based on that game scored a modest success, thereby inviting this sequel.\n\nThe game is a popular one–yet another installment has just appeared–so it has a lot of adherents out there, and maybe a substantial number of them will choose to pay more of their good money to see “Apocalypse,” as the new picture is subtitled. But they’re as likely to find it a redundant and unnecessary bore as those of us who have never played “Resident Evil” to begin with. Simply put, there seems no justification for this movie beyond the profit that can be accrued by making it cheap and marketing it big. Unless, of course, one counts the pleasure that can be had from watching the likes of Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory doing what amount to gymnastic moves in snug, skimpy costumes. And ultimately even that isn’t enough.\n\nThe picture is a genuine sequel, following up on the first movie’s conclusion, in which Alice (Jovovich), a security officer for the evil Umbrella Corporation, survived an encounter with a bunch of zombies in the company’s underground complex–a plague caused by the firm’s unwise decision to test its dangerous T-Virus. Now Raccoon City, as the urban locale in which the facility is located is named, seems safe, but as we all know, appearances are deceiving whenever a nasty conglomerate is involved. Umbrella decides to reopen the old lab, in the process allowing the entire city to become victim to the flesh-eating undead. The company quarantines all of RC, but once again Alice–who’s been experimentally treated with the antidote to the virus–emerges as the leader of a ragtag band of survivors, including brusque policewoman Jill Valentine (Guillory), a black hipster (Mike Epps), the tough-as-nails head of a trapped corporate rescue team (Oded Fehr), and Jill’s sturdy partner (Raz Adoti), and an enterprising newswoman (Sandrine Holt), who aim to escape the menace. But they become involved with one of Umbrella’s scientists, wheelchair-bound Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris), who enlists their aid in rescuing his daughter Angie (Sophie Vavasseur) from the city after the company’s cruel security director Cain (Thomas Kretschmann) refuses to help him; he promises them a secure escape route if they’ll find her. There follow plenty of fights, much shooting and many explosions as the group hacks their way through zombies, infected dogs and Umbrella security guys, leaving trails of carnage in their wake, in the effort to locate poor Angie and reach their departure point. Of course some of the humans bite the dust along the way, along with scads of the undead and enemy not-so-sharpshooters. The sole addition to the mix is a big, ugly monster called Nemesis, which is the outcome of the Umbrella’s secret genetic work and the end result of a mutation experiment on Alice’s old comrade-in-arms Matt (played by Eric Mabius in the first picture)–apparently the prototype for some sort of super-soldier. Naturally battle must be done with it as well.\n\n“Apocalypse” isn’t terribly well made–Alexander Witt’s choreography of the many fight scenes is sloppy at best, and the extreme nature of the editing makes them mostly a shapeless jumble anyway; but to make matters worse the cinematography by Christian Sebaldt and Derek Rogers is so dark and dank that it obscures the images to the point where they’re often virtually impossible to make out. Perhaps the gloom was meant to conceal the shabbiness of the cityscape in which the action is set–this doesn’t appear to have been a massively budgeted project–and the rather ordinary character of the not-so-special effects (the Nemesis creature looks like something dragged in from one of Albert Pyun’s cheapskate action disasters of the 1980s). But the basic problem with this new “Resident Evil” is that it’s basically just a drearily repetitive collection of tepid battle scenes, thrown together with little skill and less imagination. None of the cast distinguish themselves, though Jovovich shows agility and glowers well. And the costumes for her and Guillory, courtesy of Mary McLeod, will certainly be revealing enough to satisfy most drooling high school guys on the lookout for an easy thrill.\n\nBut in terms of the picture’s quality, the subtitle of “Resident Evil: Apocalypse” proves all too apt. This is one big, stinking bomb, and the fact that the last ten minutes are obviously designed to pave the way for a further installment makes it even worse. The first line of dialogue spoken by Harris’s Dr. Ashford provides the question of the day. “How bad is it?” he asks. The answer is: beyond your wildest dreams."
