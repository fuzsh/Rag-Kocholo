        "text": "Most military shooters — a subgenre of video games with conventions so rigid as to seem ritualistic — try to have it both ways when it comes to their relationship with actual warfare. Players are clearly supposed to find the combat, and the real-world settings, a viscerally exciting way to connect to current events. At the same time, far-fetched plotlines reassure us that this is all just a game; have fun and don’t think too much about what you’re doing.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line, a new game for PC, PlayStation and Xbox, takes the opposite approach. It tries to make the player uncomfortable by lingering on the immorality of the first-person shooter.\n\nWhen terrorists hijacked planes and crashed them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field, the frame of reference the nation turned to in the surreal aftermath was just about universal. The director John Landis observed last fall, “Almost everyone said, without guile — and it shows how pervasive film is — that it ‘looked like a movie,’ ” adding that film is our “contemporary mythology,” the “shared experience” for people to draw on to help explain the world.\n\nAnd yet, not anymore. After 11 years of fighting, this frame of reference has shifted from the movies to video games. (This is especially true for my generation, men in their 20s and 30s, most of whom have not served in the military.) The wars are not “like a video game” in the sense meant by those who do not play them: sterile, vapid, devoid of emotion. No, they are really like a video game: sweaty, intense, full of death.\n\nEvidence of this shift is everywhere. When WikiLeaks released the ghostly footage of an Apache firing on a group of men in Baghdad, the journalist Christopher Beam wrote in Slate, “The video, shot in black and white from a helicopter circling above a Baghdad neighborhood, will be familiar to anyone who has played the game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare or the sequel, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.” After the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, a digitally altered image circulated online of President Obama watching the operation with a PlayStation controller in hand.\n\nOn its surface, Spec Ops: The Line, developed by the Berlin studio Yager and published by 2K Games, has much in common with its forbears. Capt. Martin Walker, the playable protagonist, leads a Delta Force unit into an implausibly evacuated Dubai after it has been hit by a series of apocalyptic sandstorms. Walker is searching for a missing military hero and veteran of Afghanistan, Col. John Konrad, one of several winks in the game to Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness” and to “Apocalypse Now.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
