Beyond Good & Evil 2 is an Action Adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montpellier and published by Ubisoft. The game’s events are a prequel to those of 2003’s title Beyond Good & Evil. Game Director Michel Ancel stated that Beyond Good and Evil 2 will be in continuity with the first game, with a big variety of levels, lots of emotion in the gameplay, and characters we care about. This time we are dealing with the planet’s future, and the relationship with animals.
