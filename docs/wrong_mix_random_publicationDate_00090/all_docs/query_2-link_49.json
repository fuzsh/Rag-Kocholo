        "text": "A shareholder may be subject to a CDSC if he or she redeems Class A shares within 18 months of the date of purchase (within 12 months of purchase for the abrdn Short Duration High Yield Municipal Fund, abrdn Intermediate Municipal Income Fund, and abrdn Ultra Short Municipal Income Fund Class A1 Shares). Any CDSC is based on the original purchase price or the current market value of the shares being redeemed, whichever is less. If you redeem a portion of your shares, shares that are not subject to a CDSC are redeemed first, followed by shares that you have owned the longest. This minimizes the CDSC you pay. Please see \"Waiver of Contingent Deferred Sales Charges-Class A and Class C Shares\" in the fund's prospectus for a list of situations where a CDSC is not charged. If you purchase more than one abrdn Fund and subsequently redeem those shares, the amount of the CDSC is based on the specific combination of abrdn Funds purchased and is proportional to the amount you redeem from each abrdn Fund.\n\nThe maximum CDSC applicable to abrdn U.S. Small Cap Equity Fund Class A purchases made prior to May 1, 2017 is 0.50%. Effective May 1, 2017, the maximum CDSC is 1.00%. Unless you are otherwise eligible to purchase Class A shares without a sales charge, a CDSC at the rate in effect at the time the shares were purchased will be charged on Class A shares redeemed within 18 months of purchase if you paid no sales charge on the original purchase and a finder’s fee was paid.\n\nThe abrdn Ultra Short Municipal Income Fund Class A does not pay Finder’s Fees. Please note if you exchange abrdn Funds Class A shares that are subject to a CDSC into the abrdn Ultra Short Municipal Income Fund Class A, and then redeem those shares within 12 or 18 months of the original purchase (depending on the abrdn Fund), the CDSC applicable to the original purchase is charged."
