        "text": "I've now done a year's worth of these columns, but I'm still uncertain about what exactly a \"Membership Connection\" should provide for ALAN Review readers. Obviously, one of my assumptions is that the column can, maybe should, provide stuff of interest to ALAN members: ALAN information and news, notable books, award winners, conference announcements, etc. However, I wonder if this column shouldn't be something more than that. What, I've asked myself, do I as an ALAN member want to know about ALAN or the field of YA literature? What can I read that will help me feel connected to ALAN?\n\nUsing my own answers to the above questions, I've tried to put together columns that interest me, but a nagging doubt remains about whether or not these columns are useful and/or interesting to you. I'm certainly not looking for fan (or hate) mail, but I would be thrilled to hear suggestions, requests, or ideas from ALAN Review readers.\n\nFeel free to call, write, fax, or e-mail me with your $.02 worth at the following addresses: [phone](801) 378-3429; Chris Crowe, 3135 JKHB, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT 84602; [fax](801) 378-4720; [e- mail] chris_crowe@byu.edu.\n\n1997 ALAN Workshop\n\nThis year's ALAN Workshop, \"Young Adult Literature: Moral Journeys, Moral Truths,\" will again meet immediately following the NCTE Fall Convention in Detroit on Monday and Tuesday, November 24 and 25, 1997.\n\nProgram Chair, Gary Salvner of Youngstown State University, has invited a wide variety of well-known authors and new voices (see announcement on the inside back cover).\n\nThe Annual ALAN Breakfast is on Saturday, November 22. The featured speaker is Gary Paulsen.\n\nRegistration fees for the Workshop are $85 for ALAN members and $95 for nonmembers.\n\nApply for an ALAN Foundation Research Grant\n\nALAN Foundation, funded by royalties donated by Don Gallo and a portion of membership dues, provides grants to ALAN members doing research in some aspect of YA literature.

It is scheduled for a Christmas 1997 release.\n\nde Grummond Children's Literature Collection Receives NEH Grant The de Grummond Children's Literature Collection of the University of Southern Mississippi is the recent recipient of a $206,352 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The 18-month project entails the archival processing of the papers of 150 women authors and illustrators who have had a significant impact on the changing nature of children's literature. In addition, the published books of these women will be catalogued. Dee Jones, curator of the de Grummond Collection, is the Project Director. Finding aids and cataloging records will be accessible through OCLC and the de Grummond Collection's website (http://www.lib.usm.edu/degrumm.htm).\n\nNew Staff at VOYA\n\nVoice of Youth Advocates (VOYA) recently announced a number of new staff members: Kermit Hummel, who came to Scarecrow Press from HarperCollins, has been named Publisher of VOYA.

About the changes, MacRae says, \"As VOYA readers ourselves, we can be counted on to maintain what readers value in VOYA while adding more varied voices to our pages.\"\n\n1997 AASL/SIRS Intellectual Freedom Award\n\nGinny Moore Kruse and the Cooperative Children's Book Center of Wisconsin are the winners of the 1997 AASL/SIRS Intellectual Freedom Award, presented by the American Association of School Librarians (AASL). The award, $2,000 to the individual, and $1,000 to the media center of the recipient's choice, donated by SIRS, Inc., recognizes a personal member of AASL who has upheld the principles of intellectual freedom.\n\nThe selection committee noted that 1997 was an especially significant year to honor Kruse because this year marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Cooperative Children's Book Center's Intellectual Freedom Services, of which Kruse was the founder.\n\nAmerican Bar Association Publications for Yas\n\nStudents who have read and enjoyed Doreen Rappaport's \"Be the Judge/Be the Jury\" series (The Lizzie Borden Trial, The Alger Hiss Trial, The Sacco-Vanzetti Trial, Tinker vs. Des Moines: Student Rights on Trial), may be interested in Preview of the United States Supreme Court Cases.

Write to KLIATT, 33 Bay State Road, Wellesley, MA 02181 or call (617) 237-7577 for more information.\n\nElectronic YA Review\n\nDavid Gill of the University of Tennessee recently introduced a new internet site devoted to Young Adult literature, the YA Review. YAR features reviews of fiction, non- fiction, textbooks, and reference books. Its URL is <http://funnelweb.utcc.utk.edu/~dgill> Gill is currently recruiting reviewers for the site.

If you are interested in reviewing material for YA Review, contact Gill at one of the following addresses: S. David Gill, University of Tennessee, College of Education, CA 142, Knoxville TN 37922 or davidgill@mindless.com.\n\nPRIZE-WINNING BOOKS\n\n1997 Virginia State Reading Association Young Readers Award\n\nSharon Creech's Walk Two Moons won the 1997 Virginia State Reading Association Young Readers Award (middle school level).

Beginning in 1995, a new category of \"Honorable Mention\" was added, to properly recognize the books that contended as finalists for the award.\n\nThe award is given in recognition of a U.S. work (picture books, poetry, fiction, folklore) published in the previous year in English or Spanish that authentically and engagingly presents the experience of individuals in Latin America or the Caribbean, or of Latinos in the United States. By combining both and linking the Americas, the award reaches beyond geographic borders, as well as multicultural-international boundaries, focusing instead upon cultural heritages within the hemisphere.\n\nThe award winner and the other commended books were selected for their quality of story, cultural authenticity/sensitivity, and potential for classroom use. The winning books are honored at a ceremony held each summer at the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.\n\nFiction Award Winner: Parrot in The Oven: Mi Vida by Victor Martinez.\n\n1996 Americas Honorable Mention Fiction: So Loud a Silence by Lyll Becerra de Jenkins.\n\n1996 Americas Commended List: Alphabet City Ballet by Erika Tamar.

The Grand Forks Public Library and the University of North Dakota's library were not flooded, although materials that were checked out were prey to flood waters. In the case of the public library, this means the heaviest losses were in their most popular collections: popular fiction and children's books. At UND, the losses are clearly the greatest in the literature collections (for which I am the bibliographer).\n\nThe East Grand Forks library, which is across the river from us, was totally inundated, and all of the materials were lost. It did have a collection of over 30,000 books plus tapes, videos, periodicals, etc. Right now the library is operating out of a warming house (think hockey and ice skates!) on an honor system with what they have received back of items that miraculously escaped damage. (East Grand Forks was, as a town, quite heavily damaged during the flood.)\n\nI'm coordinating an effort to get the libraries and their collections rejuvenated. If you have books you would like to donate, please send them to me: Janet Spaeth, ChL PO Box 12942 Grand Forks ND 58206\n\nIf you are an author, I'd invite you to inscribe a greeting to the people of these towns. Unless you specify otherwise, I'll offer your donations first to the East Grand Forks library, since that's where the need is the greatest. I'm not handling money, so if you want to make a monetary donation, you can email me and I'll tell you whom to contact or mail it to. I hope you can help. It's been two months since the flood; and, although the flood waters have gone, the clean-up and emotional impact is still with us. I know this will give people in this region a greatly needed boost right now; they are so very tired.\n\nThank you very much!\n\nJanet Spaeth\n\njspaeth@badlands.nodak.edu"
