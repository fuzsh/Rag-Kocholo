        "text": "NEW YORK – November 3, 2015 – Recent research indicates that children say one of the top things they look for in choosing books to read for fun is “having characters that look like me.”1 Scholastic Reading Club and the non-profit organization, We Need Diverse Books™, are teaming-up this holiday season with a specially curated book club flyer, for grades 4-8, to provide more than 75 books that feature diverse characters and storylines.\n\nFeaturing award-winning titles, beloved classics and new releases, this special edition Scholastic Reading Club flyer will reach more than 100,000 classrooms and 2.5 million students in time for the holidays. The collection showcases a wide variety of titles highlighting important themes about race and ethnicity, multiculturalism, different religions, LGBTQ stories, individuals with disabilities and more. The range of titles and the diversity of the authors will resonate with the widely diverse population of young readers served by Scholastic Reading Club through schools nationwide and help them understand and appreciate people, cultures and experiences different from their own. Additional titles beyond those featured in the flyers will be available online at Scholastic.com/ReadingClub.

These age-appropriate, monthly flyers provide, high-quality and affordable titles to children in schools nationwide. Teachers have always loved Reading Clubs, as they earn bonus points with every book purchased, to help support their classroom libraries.\n\nEditorial – To Educators: Why We Need Diverse Books\n\nBy Preeti Chhibber and Ann Marie Wong, Editorial Directors, Scholastic Reading Club\n\nWe grew up different. At least, that’s the books we read taught us. We didn’t see characters like us just living their lives. This impacted how we saw ourselves in the real world. Our stories felt like they weren’t worth telling.\n\nNow, we know that’s not the case. All kids should know that their stories are important. We’ve partnered with the nonprofit organization We Need Diverse Books to create an offer that reflects the world as is it: filled with stories and experiences as diverse as you find in American classrooms today. These books are for every kid, so they can learn about themselves and learn about other people.\n\nToday’s world is different with all kinds of kids, all kinds of families and all kinds of stories to tell. Different is awesome, different should be celebrated, and different makes the world a better, kinder, more interesting place.\n\nLIST REVEAL:\n\nCultural Histories:\n\nZane and the Hurricane by Rodman Philbrick\n\nThe Revolution of Evelyn Serrano by Sonia Manzano\n\nEcho by Pam Munoz Ryan\n\nOn This Long Journey: The Journal of Jesse Smoke: A Cherokee Boy, the Trail of Tears , 1838 by Joseph Bruchac\n\nDiversity in Graphic Novels:\n\nDrama by Raina Telegemeir\n\nMs. Marvel: No Normal by G.

I wanted to write for children so that they could have the same joy of finding themselves in a book.”\n\nKazu Kibuishi:\n\n“Words and pictures…give books the ability to generate empathy across a wide spectrum of differences that include race, age and gender. Diversity in books can be a powerful tool for life.”\n\nSoman Chainani:\n\n“When you’re a kid, all you want to do is fit in. Seeing yourself and your differences reflected in literature helps you realize you have it all wrong: it’s better to stand out.”\n\nCece Bell:\n\n“To see yourself represented in a book is like finding a true friend. The loneliness you feel because ‘no one understands’ gives way to hope – and even relief – as you read and discover that somebody out there really does understand.”"
