The bulk of the collection consists of Milgramâs office files related to the funding and administration of his housing projects. Also included are records of his involvement with several political and activist groups, correspondence between Milgram and several family members, correspondence with his wives, and papers reflective of his relationship with poet, author, and civil rights advocate Pauli Murray.\n\nPreferred Citation\n\nCite as: [Indicate cited item or series here], Morris Milgram papers (Collection 2176), The Historical Society of Pennsylvania.\n\nReturn to Table of Contents Â»\n\nBackground Note\n\nMorris Milgram was born and raised in New York, the son of Jewish parents working in the garment industry. He attended City University of New York from which he was expelled after leading a protest against a university-sponsored visit by Italian fascist students. He finished studies at Dana College (later Newark University) and started working for the Workersâ Defense League, first as executive secretary and eventually as national secretary. In 1947 he resigned from the Workersâ Defense League and joined a Philadelphia construction company run by his father-in-law. After spending the first five years with the company learning all the basics of the construction business, from tax codes to zoning rules, Milgram inherited the company and focused on building and developing integrated housing communities.\n\nA social activist and civil rights trailblazer, Milgram believed firmly in the possibility of racial harmony and based his efforts in the assumption that blacks should have the same access to housing as whites. Probably the biggest obstacle to the achievement of his goals was the difficulty in obtaining financing for his plans; Milgram was frequently rejected by banks and other financial institutions he approached for investment and venture capital. He finally found an investor and associate in George Otto, a Quaker attracted to Milgramâs social activism and ideas. Otto helped Milgram elaborate a sound investment plan and together they secured the necessary funds to buy a tract of land in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and developed Concord Park, their first project of integrated housing.\n\nIn addition to problems with financing Milgramâs later projects were also affected by the reluctance of white home buyers to live in integrated communities. In every new project development Milgram found a surplus of qualified black buyers and not many whites willing to move to integrated communities. In a decision that gave plenty of ammunition to his critics, Milgram decided to establish quotas to ensure a racial balance. He also suffered a big financial and moral setback when the Supreme Court decided against him in the Deerfield case. After Milgram bought land in Deerfield (Chicago, Illinois) with the purpose of building an integrated community, the town took him to court on the grounds that the land was zoned for a recreational park. After several years of him trying to build integrated housing and facing the same recurring problems, Milgram decided to change strategies. Around 1965 he and his associates started buying (as opposed to building and developing) existing housing and modifying rental policies to make them more congruous with their goals.\n\nIn all, Milgram provided integrated housing to more than 20,000 people in Philadelphia, California, Boston, New York, Texas, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Cambridge, Chicago, and Washington. In 1968 he became the first recipient of the National Human Rights Award issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nReturn to Table of Contents Â»\n\nScope and Contents\n\nThe papers of Morris Milgram consist of business records and personal documents. The business records include material on his early career as a developer of open housing, multiple sets of office records generated by the different companies he founded with the purpose of establishing housing projects, detailed record of transactions between Milgram and his investors and donors, and correspondence between Milgram and several political figures. The personal papers include material on his college years, letters to and from Milgramâs wives, documents about his activities in different political organizations, and correspondence from friends and relatives.\n\nBoth the personal material and the office records span from the early 1920s until the mid 1990s.\n\nThe collection is divided in four series: General Files, Files and Drafts of Good Neighborhood, Pauli Murray, and Notebooks.\n\nSeries I, General Files is divided in five subseries. The bulk of Â Subseries A (Correspondence and Office Files) consists of office records and letters produced by Milgram and his companies. Included here are financial reports, legal documents, clippings, newsletters, and other business-related printed matter collected by Milgram. Â Subseries B (Personal and Family Files) is comprised of documents from his college years, papers reflecting his political activism, and personal papers including letters to and from his wives and other family members. Â Subseries C (Lorna Riggs Sheide Milgram) features documents produced by Milgramâs third wife. Â Subseries D (Personal Collection of 1st Publications) consists of a grouping of the first issue of several publications of interest to Milgram. Â Subseries E (Index Cards and Small Miscellaneous Items) is comprised of records of investors and donors in index card format, in addition to pocket diaries, stamps, business cards, address books, slides and audio cassettes.\n\nSeries II, Files and Drafts of Good Neighborhood includes documents related to a book Milgram published in 1977.\n\nSeries III, Pauli Murray consists of documents about Pauli Murray, the author and civil rights leader who was credited by Milgram as having convinced him to become a developer of integrated housing.\n\nSeries IV, Notebooks is a collection of Milgramâs handwritten annotations throughout the years.\n\nSeveral boxes in this collection are not attached to any particular series. Box 457 contains loose papers found while arranging the Index Cards (Series I, Subseries E) and the Notebooks (Series IV). Boxes 458-465 contain unsorted papers. Boxes 466-468 contain materials affected by mold.\n\nArrangement and folder headings are based on Milgram's filing system. Files are grouped by first letter but are not alphabetically arranged within each first-letter group. There are many duplicate file headings, as well as headings that refer to the same people or organizations in different ways. There are many abbreviations, which are not consistent.\n\nPlease see the container list for each series for more details about their scope and content.\n\nReturn to Table of Contents Â»\n\nOverview of Arrangement\n\nSeries I: General Files (1923-1994, undated), 162.5 linear feet, 405 boxes\n\nSubseries A.

General FilesÂ (1923-1994, undated)Â Â Â 162.5 Linear feetÂ ; 405 boxes, 3 flat files\n\nScope and Contents\n\nThis series is comprised of correspondence, office records, newspaper clippings, reports, speeches, brochures, letters soliciting money, journal and magazine articles, meeting minutes, newsletters, invitations to events, requests for contributions, legal files, and other assorted material. Since Milgram did business from several offices including his house, intermingled with his business records there is also material of a more personal nature like biographical notes and sketches, documents regarding his children, papers related to his four wives (Grace Smelo, Jean Gregg, Lorna Sheide, and Frances Devers), wills, prenuptial agreements, papers about stamps (which he collected), and files of a more mundane nature about a wide array of issues and subjects like diets, geriatrics, Amtrak, hotels, religions, medical procedures, libraries, etc.\n\nThe series is divided in five subseries: Correspondence and Office Files, Personal and Family Files, Lorna Riggs Sheide Milgram, Personal Collection of 1st Publications, and Index Cards and Small Miscellaneous Items.\n\nBox\n\n1-393\n\nA. Correspondence and Office FilesÂ (1930-1994, undated)Â Â Â 134.9 Linear feetÂ ; 337 boxes, 1 flat file\n\nScope and Contents\n\nThis subseries contains the majority of the documents in the collection and is composed of business files, correspondence, and documents reflecting Milgramâs involvement in social causes and political activism. Business files range from general information about the state of housing in general and open housing in particular to material regarding the founding and daily operations of Milgramâs companies, among them Modern Community Developers, Planned Communities, Choice Communities, Fund for an Open Society, the Mutual Real Estate Investment Trust, Partners in Housing, and Affirmative Housing Associates. Office files also include documents about the development of his first three open housing communities: Greenbelt Knoll and Concord Park in the Northeast section of Philadelphia, and Princeton Associates in New Jersey.\n\nInformation about how Milgram funded his projects can be found in the financial reports, board meeting minutes, lists of prospective contributors (located in folders titled Lists, Key People, Pittsburgh Names), and numerous files tracking visits and contributions by individuals and organizations in different states.\n\nCorrespondence include not only letters to and from contributors but also names like Senator Joe Clark, Hubert Humphrey, and John Kennedy, President Dwight Eisenhower, and many others Milgram wrote to urging them to vote for bills that could benefit open housing. There are letters from and to organizations that supported open housing include the NAACP, Urban League, American Friends Service Committee, National Housing Conference, Jewish Community Relations Council, National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing, National Association of Intergroup Relations, and others. There is also correspondence between Milgram and such notables as A. Philip Randolph, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jackie Robinson, Adlai Stevenson, Kivie Kaplan and numerous lesser-known individuals whose financial and leadership support Milgram sought.\n\nAnother section of this series features newspaper articles, press releases, court documents, legal files, and a book titled But Not Next Door about the Deerfield case. In 1959 Progress Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Modern Community Developers, bought two subdivisions of land in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois for the purpose of building two integrated housing communities. Plans to build houses on these two sites met with no opposition until the Deerfield community learned that Progress Development Corporation intended to sell the houses on an integrated basis. The community sought to condemn the sites with the alleged intention of building a park even though efforts to build a park prior to November of 1959 had been rejected by the Deerfield community. Progress Development Corporation filed a formal complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that the actions of the Park Board deprived Progress of its civil rights to develop land and build and sell houses in Deerfield. The Park Board filed its own suit in the Circuit Court of Lake County seeking court authority to condemn the sites in question for park purposes, using the power of eminent domain. After a number of appeals, which required over three years of litigation, Progress Development Corporation lost its suit.\n\nMilgram collected documents about another legal case involving integrated housing. Starrett City was a housing development in Brooklyn, N.Y. whose developers had set out to create an integrated housing community in 1973 and attained this goal two years later. In 1979, however, civil rights organizations filed a class action suit against the developers on the charges of discrimination. At the time, white applicants secured apartments at quicker rate than Black applicants. This first suit settled out of court in 1984. Ultimately, a federal court found that Starrett City discriminated against minority applicants.\n\nMilgram also kept numerous files of all subscriptions of individuals investing in his companies. Although files about investments and contributions can be found throughout the General Files series, a portion of these files are concentrated in boxes containing documents about Modern Community Developers (MCD) and Planned Communities (PC). For financial support related to the Mutual Real Estate & Investment Trust (M-REIT), Milgram solicited investments from foundations and religious organizations. Documents related to these can be found in boxes labeled Religious Communities.\n\nBox\n\n1-323, 358-359 Oversize\n\nFlat file 1 Box\n\nMiscellaneous Correspondence--A; Act II Communities; Aaron, Hank; A.A.U.P.; Abandonment; Abbe, Catherine; Abbe, Pauline; Abbott and Adams, Real Estate [New York]; Abbot, C.; ABC A Better Chance; Articles [from journals and typewritten]Â (1953-1994, undated)Â\n\n1\n\nAbernathy, Rosalind; Abolishing Suburbs; Abrams; Abrams, Charles; Abrams, Ed; Abrams, Eddie; Abrams, Edwin; Abram, Morris; ACCESS; Accounting; Achtenberg; Accident; Achieving Integration; Ackerman, Sam; ACLU; ACORN; Ackor; ACT II--Board, Friends, Lists, Literature; Action, Inc.; A.C.T.W.A.; ACQ Mailing; ACWA; Adams; Adams, Hannah; Adams, Neysa; AD HOC Coalition on Neighborhood; Ad (s) Ideas re: Bequests and WillsÂ (1951-1993, undated)Â\n\n2\n\nAd-NY Times; Ad (s) for Note Sales; Ad Possibilities; Ad Rates; Ad Responses; Ads re: Staff; Ad Agencies; Addelston, Lorraine; Addictions; Addresses; Adjustable Rate Mortgages; Adjustable vs Fixed-rate Loans; ADL; ADM; Adoptions; Adopt-a-Family; Adult Housing; Ads-Reit; Ads-OPEN; Ads-PH and MREIT; Adv.
