        "text": "Richard Jennings has been called ‚Äòthe master of middle American whimsy‚Äô by Kirkus Reviews. His newest book Ghost Town is on sale this week. Richard can be visited on the web at www.richardwjennings.com.\n\n‚Äì\n\n‚Äì\n\n‚Äì\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhen did you know that you first wanted to be a writer?\n\nAt age ten I received a used Smith Corona typewriter from my parents as a birthday present. I had no desk, so I sat on the floor to begin writing my first story.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or writer do you feel influenced you the most?\n\nKenneth Grahame‚Äôs wonderful story for young readers The Wind In The Willows.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or books are you currently reading or have recently read that you‚Äôd recommend to others?\n\nThe Times Atlas of The World, Ninth Edition (Times Books).\n\n‚Äì\n\nIf you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring writers, what would it be?\n\nNever seek critical advice of your writing from other people no matter how celebrated they may be.\n\n‚Äì\n\nCan you share with us your next project or any information about the next book you‚Äôre working on?\n\nThe Octopus that Ruled the World in which a 75-pound giant Pacific octopus named Armoire, now believed to be approximately 63 years old, has developed a brain that is bigger ‚Äî and smarter ‚Äî than that of any other living creature.\n\nOne of our Five On Friday favorites, author Kim Harrison, returns this week to talk about her new Young Adult novel Once Dead, Twice Shy. Already a superstar in the world of urban fantasy, Kim has now turned her considerable talents toward the Young Adult world. What can readers expect when they pick up a copy of Once Dead, Twice Shy? Read on and find out.\n\n‚Äì\n\n‚Äì\n\nYou‚Äôve had a phenomenally successful career writing for adult readers. Were there any challenges you found in writing for teenagers that are different than writing for adults?\n\nChallenges, no, but I did make some changes in my writing style when I shifted from adult to YA. I took out the sex, of course, while keeping a few kisses because YA does not mean dead, even if the main character is. üòâ I toned down the language a tad, but again, I didn‚Äôt make my characters unrealistically angelic, even if one of my characters is one. Because the YA audience likes a lot of the same things that an adult audience does, I‚Äôve hopefully kept just as much action and surprises, and tried to make the magic logical. I‚Äôve worked hard to make Madison a real person, with real fears, and real friends to help her. She makes mistakes, and she thinks on her feet. Sound familiar? üòâ\n\n‚Äì\n\nDid you read any young adult literature in preparation for writing Once Dead, Twice Shy and if so what books did you find influenced you the most?\n\nI did read a few YA‚Äôs to help me find my voice, but because they were mostly romance or ‚Äútrue life‚Äù stories, I didn‚Äôt take much but some pacing and dialog with me when I sat down to write. It was about three years ago, actually, that I did my ‚Äúresearch,‚Äù and there weren‚Äôt as many YA urban fantasy‚Äôs out then as there are now.\n\n‚Äì\n\nMore and more YA fiction seems to be attracting adult readers. What would you say to one of your adult readers who might be reluctant to try a YA Novel?\n\nI would suggest that they might find an author that has previously done adult fiction and try them first. YA does not necessarily mean unsophisticated, but be sure you know what you‚Äôre buying. Just like urban fantasy, YA urban fantasy can tend toward romance (like the Twilight books) and others are more thriller-like (Kelley Armstrong‚Äôs YA, Darkest Powers series).\n\n‚Äì\n\nDid writing a teenage character bring back any particular memories of being at that age? How did you find that experience?\n\nNo, I didn‚Äôt have any major flashbacks. To be honest, I don‚Äôt feel much different now than when I was a young adult, myself. Yes, I am older, and believe me, I feel it, but what matters to me now, mattered to me then: friends, finding my place, learning something new.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWill readers see Madison Avery again in future adventures?\n\nYes! Madison is a three-book series right now, and the second one is on my desk even as I write this, being tightened up and getting ready to go back to HarperTeen next week. If I had a title, I‚Äôd tell you, but we are still kicking a few around.\n\nThis week our FIVE ON FRIDAY guest is illustrator Dan Burr. Dan is the wonderful artist of several picture books, including the recently released PIRATES, which features poetry by FIVE ON FRIDAY favorite David Harrison. Dan can be visited on the web at www.danburr.com.\n\n‚Äì\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhen did you know that you first wanted to be an illustrator?\n\nWhen I was in college, our instructor introduced me to illustration as a profession and that‚Äôs when I knew I could do this. I immersed myself in the world of illustration and have never looked back.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book, writer or artist do you feel influenced you the most?\n\nThe one book that changed things for me was Treasure Island, imagine that!\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or books are you currently reading or have recently read you‚Äôd recommend to others?\n\nMostly I read manuscripts‚Ä¶but The Earth Is Enough by Harry Middleton‚Ä¶ what a book!\n\n‚Äì\n\nIf you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring writers (or illustrators), what would it be?\n\nIf you want to do this for a living, don‚Äôt give up and don‚Äôt take no for an answer, and be naive enough to believe that you can do this.\n\n‚Äì\n\nCan you share with us your next project or any information about the next book you‚Äôre working on?\n\nI am working on several books but the one I am excited about is Cavemen a story about men and dogs.\n\nThis week our FIVE ON FRIDAY guest is Kirby Larson, author of the Newbery Honor Book, Hattie Big Sky. She is also the co-author of the recently released TWO BOBBIES: A True Story of Hurricane Katrina, Friendship and Survival. You can visit Kirby at her website, www.kirbylarson.com.\n\n‚Äì\n\n‚Äì\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhen did you know that you first wanted to be a writer?\n\nI‚Äôve been a bookworm since I could read and have always written for fun but didn‚Äôt take the leap to a writing career until I read a picture book written and illustrated by Arnold Lobel, called Ming Lo Moves the Mountain. That very day, I began the long process of learning to write for children. And I have a file cabinet full of wretched manuscripts to prove it!\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or writer do you feel influenced you the most?\n\nIn addition to Arnold Lobel (see above), I would have to say Betsy Byars, Patricia Reilly Giff, Jamie Gilson and Katherine Paterson were my inspirations early on. Now, of course, the list of writers who inspire me is longer than Lincoln‚Äôs left leg, but in the early days it was those women who kept my fires fed.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or books are you currently reading or have recently read that you‚Äôd recommend to others?\n\nChains and Wintergirls by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\nOrwell‚Äôs Luck by Richard Jennings\n\nThe Farwalker‚Äôs Quest by Joni Sensel\n\nSeven Times Nine Equals Trouble by Claudia Mills\n\nThe Drowned Maiden‚Äôs Hair by Amy Laura Schlitz\n\nThe Mostly True Adventures of Homer P. Figg by Philbrick Rodman\n\nInside Out by Terry Trueman. . . I could keep going or you could simply join GoodReads to read about the rest of my recommendations!\n\n‚Äì\n\nIf you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring writers (or illustrators), what would it be?\n\nMay I offer two? Read, read, read. Revise, revise, revise.\n\n‚Äì\n\nCan you share with us your next project or any information about the next book you‚Äôre working on?\n\nMy second book co-authored with dear friend, Mary Nethery, will be out in the fall. Nubs: The True Story of a Mutt, a Marine and a Miracle is the story of an Iraqi dog befriended by a US Marine and we are very proud of it. Also, I am in the almost-final revision of another historical novel, based on an incident that occurred in 1927; title and pub date TBD. Thanks for asking, Michael!\n\nThis week our FIVE ON FRIDAY guest is celebrated and award winning author Mary Casanova. Having written more than twenty books including picture books, middle grade and young adult novels, Mary has traveled the world to bring her stories to life. Research trips to France, Norway and Belize among many others have proven the old adage that one must suffer for one‚Äôs art. You can visit Mary and try to keep up with her adventures at www.marycasanova.com.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhen did you know that you first wanted to be a writer?\n\nSomewhere in high school, between writing an essay on Russian history to a paper in a College Prep writing class, I discovered the power and magic of words. I was stunned to realize how my words, if carefully crafted, could persuade, move, and maybe entertain a reader. If I loved working with words, then perhaps I could think about writing books someday‚Ä¶of being an author. I kept the dream carefully tucked close to my heart, however, as there wasn‚Äôt a single person encouraging me to follow this path until later in college, when an English professor said, ‚ÄúMary, I think you could have a career in free-lance writing if you want to.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or writer do you feel influenced you the most?\n\nI always assumed I would write for adults until I was 32 years old and read Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. I appreciate his compact language and forward-leaning tension combined with a story set in the deep woods. It‚Äôs not surprising, then, that my first novel for young readers was Moose Tracks, about a 12-year old boy in northern Minnesota struggling to save an orphaned moose calf from poachers. Twenty years-and to my amazement, 23 books later‚ÄìI still appreciate the high quality of writing in books for kids and teens.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or books are you currently reading or have recently read that you‚Äôd recommend to others?\n\nI‚Äôm on an historical novel kick right now, and in the books for adults category, I just finished Red Azalea (a memoir by Anchee Min that covers her experience during the Cultural Revolution in China), The Widow of the South (historical novel by Robert Hicks based on a civil war battle in Franklin, TN, close to where I recently was doing author visits at schools and visited the historic sites) and To Catch The Lightening (by Alan Cheuse and exploring the life of photographer Edward Curtis who spent years photographing Native Americans at the turn-of-the-century).\n\nI highly recommend Hattie Big Sky by Kirby Larson, a fine prairie novel that won the 2008 Newbery Honor. I‚Äôm just finishing Eliza Carbone‚Äôs Last Dance on Holladay Street, which deftly explores the limited options of girls and women on the western frontier. And after that, I‚Äôll read Lea Wait‚Äôs book for young readers called Wintering Well, set in l820 in Maine.\n\nSo many great books! So little time.\n\n‚Äì\n\nIf you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring writers, what would it be?\n\nRevise recklessly and endlessly. Don‚Äôt hang on with white knuckles to those early drafts you so painstakingly wrote. Get feedback. Then revise again and again to make the story stronger. Revise until your brain, even in the half-awake-half-asleep moments of the morning cannot dredge up one more single thing to fix. Then you might be getting close to sending it out.\n\n‚Äì\n\nCan you share with us your next project or any information about the next book you‚Äôre working on?\n\nSorry, Mike, but I would rather talk about what‚Äôs brand new‚Äìlike my two books, doll, and DVD from American Girl! The first book is Chrissa, and its sequel, Book Two, is titled Chrissa Stands Strong.\n\nChrissa is the ‚Äú2009 Girl of the Year‚Äù from American Girl and she is a generous, creative 10-year old girl who moves from Iowa to Minnesota midway through 4th grade, only to be seated at a cluster of four desks with girls known as the ‚ÄúQueen Bees‚Äù or ‚ÄúMean Bees.‚Äù Not only does Chrissa have to learn to stand up to bullying, but she has to risk speaking up for others when the bullying turns dangerous. This was a topic I was asked to write about and was eager to tell a story that would help show how damaging bullying can be to victims, and how difficult it can be for kids to know how to make it stop. To soften the story, Chrissa‚Äôs Nana raises mini-llamas, and for a little Hollywood sizzle, HBO and American Girl released a DVD based on both books. To see the trailer, which is very cooooool, go to www.marycasanova.com or www.americangirl.com.\n\nThis week our guest at FIVE ON FRIDAY is New York Times Best-Selling author James Rollins. This week, Jim has entered the world of Children‚Äôs Books with the publication of his new YA Novel Jake Ransom and The Skull King‚Äôs Shadow.\n\nVisit James at his website www.jamesrollins.com.\n\n‚Äì\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhen did you know that you first wanted to be a writer?\n\nI‚Äôve always been the storyteller in the family (what my Mom called being the ‚ÄúLiar‚Äù of the family). I was always terrifying my siblings with stories of Martians loose in the neighboring cornfields and of a ventriloquist doll that would wake at night and wander the house looking for blood. I also read a lot growing up, but I‚Äôd say it was junior high when I truly began setting pen to paper and truly considered writing for a living.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or writer/artist do you feel influenced you the most?\n\nIf I had to pick one, I‚Äôd say Michael Crichton. I have all of his books, including a signed first-edition of The Andromeda Strain. His mix of science, adventure, and suspense is the stuff I love. It‚Äôs the reason I write what I do today. He is an author I admire both for his versatility and his bottomless ingenuity. Though many have tried to follow in his footsteps, none have succeeded. He will be missed.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or books are you currently reading or have recently read that you‚Äôd recommend to others?\n\nOne book really stood out this past year of me, and I‚Äôve been telling lots of people about it: The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It‚Äôs a YA novel about a Survivor-like game show of the future, where children compete in a kill-or-be-killed competition. Loved the whole world she creates, and especially the main character.\n\n‚Äì\n\nIf you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring writers (or illustrators), what would it be?\n\nIt‚Äôs also only one word: READ. There‚Äôs the old adage that you should ‚Äúwrite everyday‚Äù if you wish to get published, which is definitely true. You do need to practice and hone your craft. But I‚Äôd like to add a caveat to that old nugget: ‚ÄúWrite everyday, but read every night.‚Äù There is no better teacher on the craft than a good book. Whatever problem you struggle with during your writing day (dialog, opening a scene, etc), you‚Äôll discover a great example on how to address that in the book you read that night. If you write everyday and read every night, you‚Äôll grow stronger and stronger as a writer. That, and don‚Äôt forget to floss.\n\n‚Äì\n\nCan you share with us your next project or any information about the next book you‚Äôre working on?\n\nI‚Äôm currently polishing up the sequel to by first Jake Ransom middle school book. It‚Äôs titled Jake Ransom and the Howling Sphinx, where Jake‚Äôs next adventure takes him deep into Egyptian mythologies and mysteries. But I also have another two books coming out this year. This summer is the next big Sigma series book, ominously titled The Doomsday Key. And this winter will be a stand-alone thriller called Altar of Eden.\n\nThis week‚Äôs FIVE ON FRIDAY guest is author Jocelynn Drake. Jocelynn‚Äôs debut novel Nightwalker, was published in July 2008 to critical acclaim. High octane action and suspense are the order of the day in this tale of the Vampire hunter Mira and her encounters with Danaus, a Vampire hunter with his own mysterious past. It‚Äôs the Underworld meets Alias. Look for her new book Dayhunter now on sale.\n\n(A note to parents, teachers and librarians: while I write children‚Äôs books some of my guests on FIVE ON FRIDAY do not. Many of the authors featured here write both. The purpose of FIVE ON FRIDAY is to give all visitors an insight into the mind of writers and the writing process. So please make your own judgment regarding the age appropriateness of the books discussed here for your children, students or patrons. And as always thanks for visiting FIVE ON FRIDAY.)\n\nYou can visit Jocelyn‚Äôs website at www.jocelynndrake.com.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhen did you know that you first wanted to be a writer?\n\nThat‚Äôs a somewhat hard question to answer. I actually started writing when I was 12 years old. I spent the summer re-telling the tale of Robin Hood so that it included a strong female lead that could keep up with the other boys. (I still have that worn manuscript and no, no one is allowed to see it.) From there, I never gave writing a second thought. It was part of me, as essential as breathing. I daydreamed constantly of distant worlds, strange people, and wild plots. I wrote constantly, but growing up, I never considered doing it for a living. I knew how hard it was to get published and doubted that I would ever be good enough to be included with those amazing few that ranked among the gods.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt until I was in my freshman year of college that I realized that maybe I had to take a chance on writing. I was an engineering major, but hated calculus. However, I was in heaven in my literature classes. At that time, I decided it was time to face facts and stop denying who I really was: I was a writer. My sophomore year, I changed my major to English and journalism. At that point, I finally embraced being a writer and I‚Äôve never been happier.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or writer/artist do you feel influenced you the most?\n\nWow! That‚Äôs a hard question, too. I feel like a sponge when I read, taking everything and leaving it to stew in my subconscious. I love Simon Green‚Äôs world-building in his Nightside series. I love the character development that Raymond Feist and Kim Harrison create with their respective series. But oddly enough, my moral compass, the dark core of my novels, the sense of duty, honor, and responsibility that fill my main characters is born out of my love for the Batman legacy. I think the stories of Batman from the ‚Äô90s and ‚Äô00s are pure genius, delving into the dark psychological aspects of Bruce Wayne and the inhabitants of Gotham.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or books are you currently reading or have recently read that you‚Äôd recommend to others?\n\nDue to my currently busy writing schedule, I have to admit that I haven‚Äôt done much reading lately. However, some authors that will always have a place on my nightstand include Kim Harrison, Vicki Pettersson, Rachel Vincent, Neil Gaiman, Raymond Feist, Simon Green, Jim Butcher, Charlaine Harris, and Christine Feehan. Of course, that doesn‚Äôt include my growing stack of Batman graphic novels, a copy of Oscar Wilde‚Äôs Dorian Gray, and Earnest Hemmingway‚Äôs The Sun Also Rises.\n\n‚Äì\n\nIf you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring writers (or illustrators), what would it be?\n\nI think the one bit of advice that I can offer is actually the hardest thing to do: don‚Äôt ever give up. This is a very hard business to break into and it demands that you develop a very thick skin. However, if you truly love writing, that unwavering passion should be able to carry you through the lean times. Write because you love it. Write constantly, trying new techniques, new voices, and new plot devices. The experience will only strengthen your skills. Just keep writing.\n\n‚Äì\n\nCan you share with us your next project or any information about the next book you‚Äôre working on?\n\n2009 is going to be a busy year for me, actually. At the end of April, Dayhunter, the second novel in my Dark Days Series will be released. This novel sees my main characters Mira and Danaus dash off to Venice, where they uncover a dark plot being twisted by the Coven ‚Äî the ruling vampire body. At the same time, our heroes must still find a way to stop the naturi from breaking the seal that has locked the race away from the earth.\n\nIn late August, I have a novella coming out in the anthology Unbound, which also features Kim Harrison, Jeaniene Frost, Melissa Marr, and Vicki Pettersson. This novella is titled ‚ÄúThe Dead, The Damned, and The Forgotten‚Äù and is actually to be a prequel to my first novel, Nightwalker. In this story, we get a look at Mira‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life because Danaus arrives and mucks everything up.\n\nAnd finally, Dawnbreaker, the third novel in the Dark Days Series, is slated for release in late September. This novel continues with Mira and Danaus‚Äôs struggle with the naturi, but this time, we see the damage wrought by the naturi hitting much closer to home for Mira.\n\nAt the moment, I‚Äôm up to my eyeballs in book 4 in the Dark Days Series. And this one, kids, is headed in a slightly different direction from the prior 3 books.\n\nThis week our FIVE ON FRIDAY guest is multi-talented illustrator Brad Sneed. Brad lives in Kansas City, Missouri and has illustrated over twenty books for children. Visit his website www.bradsneed.com to view his amazing art and gallery of books.\n\n‚Äì\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhen did you know that you first wanted to be an illustrator?\n\nWhen I realized I was never going to be a professional football player. Seriously‚Ä¶ When I was young, I felt there were three ‚Äúparts‚Äù to me. There was the country kid who enjoyed riding horses, whether it be in the arena or on a trail in the Rocky Mountains. There was the athlete, who spent countless hours on the court, field and diamond. And finally, the artist. I don‚Äôt recall a specific moment when I said, ‚ÄúAha! I‚Äôm going to be an illustrator!‚Äù I think the artist in me grew while my other interests faded. By the time I was in middle school, I was pretty set on going to college to study art.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or artist do you feel influenced you most?\n\nAs a kid, I spent a lot of time looking at Dr. Suess books. I love paintings by regionalist painter, Thomas Hart Benton. He is a master of drawing you into a painting and leading your eye throughout the entire work by manipulating line, color, and value.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or books are you currently reading or have recently read that you‚Äôd recommend to others?\n\nLove That Dog by Sharon Creech.\n\nThe Alchemist by Paulo Coelho\n\nSummerland by Michael Chabon\n\n‚Äì\n\nIf you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring illustrators, what would it be?\n\nHang out in an illustrator‚Äôs studio. WATCH an artist draw and paint. There‚Äôs no better way to learn. Of course, observation must be followed by action, so draw, draw, draw, draw, draw.\n\n‚Äì\n\nCan you share with us your next project or any information about the next book you‚Äôre working on?\n\nI‚Äôm illustrating an interesting and innovative story called, Following Featherbottom. The hero is a letter-gathering stork named Felix Featherbottom. I‚Äôd love to tell you about some exciting elements to this story but I can‚Äôt elaborate just yet. I‚Äôll be adding information to my website as Felix prepares for take-off, so stay tuned!\n\nThis week FIVE ON FRIDAY features author and playwright Sandy Asher. Having been drafted into a role in one of Sandy‚Äôs plays at a recent Lit Festival I can state with all alacrity that Sandy is a stern taskmaster as a director and insists on making her actors use the method approach to their roles. I made everyone call me Lance for weeks!\n\n‚Äì\n\nVisit Sandy‚Äôs website\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhen did you know that you first wanted to be a writer?\n\nI can remember standing in the children‚Äôs reading room of the Philadelphia Public Library in Logan Square, surrounded by shelves of books, ALL of which were my favorites, and thinking, ‚ÄúThere can‚Äôt be anything more wonderful than writing a book that someone will love as much as I love these.‚Äù I was in elementary school at the time, and I don‚Äôt know if I even understood that writing could be a career. I was always making up songs, stories, and plays. It was just something I did for the fun of it. I didn‚Äôt realize I could get paid for it until I read about Jo selling her first story in Little Women.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or writer/artist do you feel influenced you the most?\n\nThe very first was Louisa May Alcott. But I didn‚Äôt grow up thinking I‚Äôd write for children. In college, a friend read a batch of poems I‚Äôd written and said, ‚ÄúDo you realize there‚Äôs a child or a reference to childhood in every one of these poems?‚Äù I‚Äôd never thought about that, and I still didn‚Äôt get it. Every adult novel I tried to write happened to have a teenaged main character, but the light never went on. It wasn‚Äôt until after college, when I enrolled in a course in Methods of Teaching Children‚Äôs Literature and read Judy Blume‚Äôs Are You There God? It‚Äôs Me Margaret and Jean Craighead George‚Äôs Julie of the Wolves that I understood my calling.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or books are you currently reading or have recently read that you‚Äôd recommend to others?\n\nI will probably never get over Marcus Zusak‚Äôs The Book Thief. I‚Äôve just finished reading his earlier novel, I Am The Messenger, and it‚Äôs wonderful, but if you haven‚Äôt done so already, read The Book Thief first.\n\n‚Äì\n\nIf you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring writers (or illustrators), what would it be?\n\nRead, read, read, write, write, write, and revise, revise, revise.\n\n‚Äì\n\nCan you share with us your next project or any information about the next book you‚Äôre working on?\n\nI‚Äôm finishing up an anthology on revision for the Institute of Children‚Äôs Literature, and I‚Äôm very excited about it. Twenty children‚Äôs authors offer their published work ‚Äî picture book, short story, beginning reader, or novel excerpt ‚Äî alongside early drafts of that work. I interview each author about his or her revision process, and I provide commentary to lead the reader through that process. Four editors and an agent also give their thoughts about revision. It‚Äôs a treasure trove of normally ‚Äúinvisible writing‚Äù ‚Äî the missteps and backfires and take-overs we authors usually keep hidden from public view. Still debating about the title (talk about revision!), but the book is due out in either spring or summer of 2009.\n\nThis week‚Äôs FIVE ON FRIDAY guest is G. Xavier Robillard, author of the recently released CAPTAIN FREEDOM: A Super Heroes Quest for Truth, Justice and the Celebrity He So Richly Deserves. Packed with pop culture references, Robillard goes non-stop from page one, racing through the twisted story of Captain Freedom (aka Tzadik Freidman). The action starts with Freedom‚Äôs fall from grace on the world stage, a disastrous dinner party and his search for a sidekick to his flagging comic book sales, a stint in rehab, his disastrous children‚Äôs book, a run for political office and finally, his true calling. This wild ride of a satire sends up celebrity, politics, Hollywood, the fashion world, upper management, current events and much more, including the beloved world of comic books.\n\n(A note to parents, teachers and librarians: while I write children‚Äôs books some of my guests on FIVE ON FRIDAY do not. Many of the authors featured here write both. The purpose of FIVE ON FRIDAY is to give all visitors an insight into the mind of writers and the writing process. So please make your own judgment regarding the age appropriateness of the books discussed here for your children, students or patrons. And as always thanks for visiting FIVE ON FRIDAY.)\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhen did you know that you first wanted to be a writer?\n\nI wrote my first poem when I was eight. It was published, by my sister, on the refrigerator. During Comic Phase I (1979-1987) I wanted to write for Marvel Comics. It was in high school, due to the amazing mentoring of my tenth grade English teacher, that I knew I wanted to write seriously.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or writer do you feel influenced you the most?\n\nMark Twain. People often think that humor is ephemeral, and has no shelf life, but you can open almost any Twain essay or novel and start to crack up, and his caustic observations could easily out-snark all the bloggers in the pack.\n\n‚Äì\n\nWhat book or books are you currently reading or have recently read that you‚Äôd recommend to others?\n\nNeal Stephenson‚Äôs Anathem is the best and most demanding speculative fiction I‚Äôve read in a while. Corey Doctorow‚Äôs Little Brother should be required reading for middle school. And I recently read Later, At the Bar, a wonderful novel in stories by Rebecca Barry. At ComicCon last week I picked up the final installment in Joss Whedon‚Äôs Astonishing X-Men.\n\nAt this very moment I‚Äôm rereading Orhan Pamuk‚Äôs My Name Is Red. Set in 16th century Istanbul it‚Äôs both rumination on the tension between art and religion, and a fast paced murder mystery.\n\n‚Äì\n\nIf you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring writers, what would it be?\n\nDon‚Äôt underestimate the power of networking. It‚Äôs not the first thing many artists think about, since we tend to be introverts, but every bit helps. Almost every fun writing gig I‚Äôve had has been a result of my other writer friends.\n\n‚Äì\n\nCan you share with us your next project or any information about the next book you‚Äôre working on?\n\nIt‚Äôs a comic thriller that‚Äôs set at a poetry publication. Think Treasure of the Sierra Madre meets J. Alfred Prufrock."
