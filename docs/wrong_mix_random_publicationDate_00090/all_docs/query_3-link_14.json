        "text": "This is important because in today’s society, people are judged by their appearance, the way they do things, and how unpolished they are when in reality they may have good intentions and do not conform to the outward expectations of society. Just because people are different does not mean they are evil and bad, they just have different views and ways of doing things. If\n\nAfter reading “The Myth of the Latin Woman: I Just Met a Girl Named Maria” by Judith Ortiz Cofer, the reader is able to see that her essay focusses on personal appearance choices which she has compared and contrasted with her own early-life experiences. Based on how an individual appears at first sight, it dictates how others socially judge and stereotype us beyond the “beauty” dimension. For example, an individual may think about what he or she is going to wear when going out to eat at a restaurant. If the individual is going to go Buffalo Wild Wings to dine, obviously he or she is going to wear an outfit that fits them in society’s social norms which is a basic t-shirt, jeans, and shoes. However, if he or she shows up dressed up\n\nFirst impressions are not always right. This is what this essay is about, and my opinion is that you should not judge even though it's hard not to. I've stereotyped and judged a person by their looks, but I was wrong and it made me feel bad. He was a good guy and he became one of my best friends. This is a 12 Angry Men essay about all the stereotyping and judging someone by their looks that is on trial in the\n\nIn the essay “Why Looks Are the Last Bastion of Discrimination” by Deborah L. Rhode, she portrays the stereotypes hardships which are faced by certain people. She wants the audience to know how the stereotypes can cause suffering. The way certain people appear can cause people to have certain view point towards them due to their look. Discrimination is generated in people’s minds due to the physical appearance of a person. She wants the people to know that discriminating others because of their race, religion, color, and gender should be stopped. She gives an example in her essay about an obese lady, where the lady is called she not fit for job and\n\n“We all know that appearance matters, but the price of prejudice can be steeper than we often assume” (Washington1.) Published originally in the Washington Post on May 23,2010 by Deborah L. Rhode. Rhode the Professor of law and legal director at Stanford University in her essay “Why Looks Are The Last Bastion Of Discrimination,” argues that an individual's physical appearance is one of the few qualities of their personal identity that other people are legally within their rights to discriminate against. Rhode states her thesis clearly explaining the forthcoming reasons she will offer to uphold her position. Rhode believes that discriminating against individuals based on their appearance is wrong, and is often overlooked in many environments such as the workforce. Many think it is crucial that discrimination on looks is banned in workplaces, schools, and most other organizations.\n\nThe way our society views other people by their appearance will probably never change. In some ways, everyone has it set in their mind what makes a person “perfect”. These characteristics may include personal appearance, wealth and intelligence. One does not always take the time to get to know a person, but make assumptions about people. Two poems, which show different views, include Richard Cory by Edwin Arlington Robinson and Barbie Doll by Marge Piercy. In the Barbie doll, the author writes about a girl’s life. The author starts off by describing her childhood. She was given dolls and toys like any other girl and she also put on some lipstick. This girl\n\nMany times in society, people tend to create different stereotypes or view people as “different” or “unusual”. People are constantly judging before considering facts and other valuable information. Sadly, most victims that are being judged are wrongly convicted. The idea of judging and characterizing a person by how he/she looks, seems to be typical and common. Very few people in today’s day and age take the time to discover the true qualities of a person who may be convicted and is either behind bars or being judged for things they have never done. Sometimes, the people who are being as weird, inferior or irrelevant tend to become extremely important and even influential in books, movies and real life. Similarly, in Harper Lee’s novel, To\n\nAnother reason this is an important idea in the film is that it teaches us that judging others wrongly can affect us if we judge someone as being a kind and pure person when that isn’t particularly true. For example, the audience was made to believe that Jim, Kim’s ex-boyfriend was a nice person, Jim is portrayed to the audience as the classic blonde-haired, blue-eyed American boy and is seen to the whole neighborhood including peg as an angelic person because of his looks and how his exterior seems. We see how it is important when we witness how quickly Jim’s personality changes and we instantly see what he is really like, we see an almost devilish darkness to him when Kim tells him to leave. After this scene we see Jim chasing after Edward trying to kill him, this demonstrates exactly why judging people based on their looks does not benefit either party as it could reflect negatively on the person being judged or the person who is judging someone. This lesson teaches that although someone may seem like one thing on the outside they may be completely different on the inside, judging this way is as if believing that just because an apple may look on the outside as perfect and ripe, it can be very\n\nIt can be very easy to judge someone based on their appearance. During spring break, I had met another member of my family I didn’t know about and to me she looked like she was mean and selfish. We began to hang out more and I started realizing that she was very kind and not mean or selfish. She didn’t only care about herself and I was glad that I met her. She was funny and we all hung out together with my family and played games and looked at rocks on the beach at night. I got to know so much about her that were interesting. Therefore, Rodman Philbrick wrote the book “Freak The Mighty” so that we could learn that looking at somebody doesn’t show who they actually are.\n\nAn example of this is the play “Cyrano de Bergerac”. In the play Cyrano is in love with his cousin Roxane, but no body thinks that she will like him because he has a huge nose. They all judge him on his appearance and forget all about his well-rounded personality. So, he writes poetry and puts someone else’s name on it, at the end when Roxane finds out, she falls in love with him. That goes to show that appearance is not everything, regardless of what some may think. Stereotyping is also shown in a recent movie put out by Disney, called “You Wish”. This boy wants to be popular and cool, but his friends know that it does not matter. He wishes his brother out of his life and everything changes, he becomes the star football player and his friends are different. When he tries to talk to the old ones, they are rude to him because they think he is just a conceited jock. In the end when he gets his old life back he learns to accept himself and love what he does have.\n\nEven with the concept race not being genetic, discrimination has prevalent in society and in the society Una Marson lived in where she writes “ I like me black face And me kinky hair. I like me black face. And me kinky hair. But nobody loves dem I jes tink it’s fair.” Marson describes an instance where she loves who she is, from her dark skin to her kinky hair but no one else does. Her constant instance that she loves her features, in some ways makes the reader believe that she only recently come to accept herself for who she was. A problem many people face growing up, but the feeling of not living up to a fair skinned and haired standard is common among many ethnic communities. With women who have darker being told they were ugly and being rejected the opposite sex who wanted light skinned or white women so there children come out pretty (Newmany). Although she know feels confident in with herself and her identity, she knows that due to other racist beliefs they won’t like her because her skin is dark and her is kinky. It’s not fair and in 2016, it’s still not\n\nAppearances matter Therstities, in the Illid, was an odd, deformed man that had no control over his mouth. He was accused of being cowardly and was beaten up for stating the facts and rambling on about true and smart ideas. Many other characters, who arm’t as odd looking, did similarly, cowardly things, and didn't get verbally and physically beaten up for it. Which is also extremely relevant to our culture today. This is one case of how appearances effects how you become treated and how this effects that persons personality and development of character."
