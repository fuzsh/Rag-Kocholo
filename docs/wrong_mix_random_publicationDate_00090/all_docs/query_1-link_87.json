ST. VISITS SOUTHEAST TODAY\n\nForget Southeast Missouri State University's 71-53 romp past Tennessee State in Nashville back on Jan. 6.

Is it mere coincidence that the gambling company has had one stumbling block after another thrown in its path, or is it the hand of the Lord strategically placing all these obstacles in front of it to deny them access to the promised land of Cape Girardeau? Praise the Lord, the gambling company has finally gotten the message. ...\n\nCATHOLIC SCHOOLS SHINE AS EXAMPLES OF SOUND EDUCATION\n\nThere is a reason Catholic school enrollment is growing by leaps and bounds.

Perhaps the administrators of the hospitals can explain just how the managed-care groups lower the hospitals' expenses by 19 percent.

You have to when you invite more than a dozen children to your oldest daughter's 5th-birthday party. We held the morning party at Kid's World, one of those businesses that thrives because of one simple concept: Parents would rather let a dozen children run wild in the indoor playground than in their own home...\n\nJOY ALONG THE WAY: NO CLOVEN HOOVES ON GROUNDHOGS\n\nGroundhog Day! I had a pet groundhog once. I called him Chuck, though, short for woodchuck, the anglicized corruption of its Indian name. Chuck didn't know he was my pet. Our eyes met only once.

(AP) -- Big Three earnings were flat last year at just over $12.9 billion, partly because of a 22 percent overall decline in fourth-quarter profits blamed largely on General Motors Corp.'s big strike costs.

Campaign financing cannot be dodged. ...\n\nMISSOURIANA\n\nThe primary purpose of state government in Missouri these days seems to be funding more school rooms in our cities and building more living rooms for felons in our prisons.

Swingle wrote his letter of resignation Monday, the same day he learned the nation's largest organization of lawyers voted to seek a moratorium against the death penalty...\n\nSPEAKOUT\n\nI WOULD like to comment about people who dress their dogs in clothing. It's a sickness and perversity to get enjoyment out of seeing little Fido in a biker outfit. Their masters must be akin somehow to transvestites who themselves don't have the courage to come out of the closet so they live their sickness through their dogs. It should be against the law to put an animal through that, and the Humane Society ought to be called on them...\n\nGET-TOUGH POLICY ON CRIME WILL COST MISSOURIANS $1 BILLION\n\nWhen the nation began taking a get-tough stand on crime a few years ago, the goal was to reduce the number of crimes being committed by sending the message that offenders would get harsh penalties.

He received plenty of recruiting interest from the likes of Missouri, Illinois and Vanderbilt...\n\nHOOP SCOOP: BIG WINS MARK BIG WEEK FOR SOUTHEAST\n\nI am beginning this article just like I did last week.

That can be a little trying on one's nerves, but it sure is exciting...\n\nSEMO FANS GETTING THEIR MONEY'S WORTH (SEMO NOTEBOOK)\n\nFans of Southeast Missouri State University basketball certainly can't say they're not getting their money's worth this season.

Where was Dennis Rodman's dignity while he was kicking Eugene Davis? I say that was no act from a man with dignity. THIS IS in response to the comment about a case of extortion. ...\n\nRUST COMMENTARY: FLORIDA LETTER WRITER SEES NATION'S TIES TO CHRISTIAN FAITH\n\nThough I prefer flying, one of the nice things about driving across country (Cape Girardeau to Florida via children and grandchildren in Charlotte, N.C., and Fayetteville, Ga.) is to be able to read a number of different newspapers. It seems every school board is having difficulties passing bond issues to repair or replace 50-year-old buildings (or older). They're having the same arguments about the curriculum and quality of their local educations. Unemployment is at a record low...\n\nRESPONSE IS LIGHT TO PROPOSED SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AREAS\n\nA good measure of public displeasure is often the volume of the complaints. That is why the relative silence that has followed the announcement of new proposed school boundaries is so welcome. An Attendance Area Study Committee refashioned the six current elementary school boundaries into five attendance areas. The proposal is based on the assumption that the April 1 bond issue and tax increase will pass and a new elementary school will be built at the corner of Sprigg and Bertling...\n\nLETTERS: MISSOURI IN CIVIL WAR\n\nTo the editor: Tamara Zellars Buck is a fine writer, and we always enjoy her columns, especially the one in the Feb. 1 issue in which she write on the origin and nature of Ebonics. However, her Civil War history is a bit skewed when she wrote \"and how Missouri is in the Midwest and was a neutral state in the Civil War.\"...\n\nLETTERS: BIG GOVERNMENT STILL THERE\n\nTo the editor: Conventional wisdom now has it that President Clinton's second inaugural address was less than outstanding, even banal.

On Wednesday, the first day of the signing period, Southeast added two more linemen among its nine signees. The Indians had already signed three hefty junior college offensive linemen...\n\nINDIANS HOPE TO ERASE RACER LEAD; SE LOOKS FOR SHARE OF FIRST\n\nIn the six-year history of Southeast Missouri State University's NCAA Division I basketball program, the Indians have not played many -- if any -- important Ohio Valley Conference games this late in the season. That's why Southeast coach Ron Shumate barely hesitated when asked if tonight's contest against Murray State ranks as his team's biggest ever on the Division I level...\n\nOTAHKIANS ATTEMPT TO END OVC SLIDE\n\nSoutheast Missouri State University women's basketball coach Ed Arnzen can point to a game on Jan. 23 in Murray, Ky., as to where his team's most recent troubles began.

Same with Virginia Overholser's portrayal of Truvy's discombobulated assistant Annelle. That's not Daryl Hannah. Where's Julia Roberts? Sally Field? Shirley MacLaine?...\n\nTRAGEDY & COMEDY & BEAUTY\n\nIn directing \"Steel Magnolias,\" the challenge for George Kralemann was walking the line that separates the play's comedy from its tragedy. \"I had to find a natural balance,\" said Kralemann. \"Sometimes it was too comedic and sometimes too dramatic.\" What he discovered in rehearsal was that the six actresses who make up the cast understood better than he did how these women friends would interact in the mix of comic and calamitous situations the play presents...\n\nCONTRA DANCING\n\nNo fancy footwork or outfits are required for contra dancing. Nearly 40 people turned out Friday night to do a kind of dancing few people know how to do. Contra dancing is similar to square dancing, but the dancers progress down long lines with their partners instead of dancing in squares...\n\nHISTORY OF THE DANCE\n\nContra dancing has been around for centuries, yet many people don't know what it is.

There aren't three television sets at the Sullivan household. But if there were, they might all have been going Tuesday night. Although I didn't expect any startling revelations from the president during Tuesday night's State of the Union Address, I wanted to watch it...\n\nJACKSON, POPLAR BLUFF REACH CHARLESTON FINAL\n\nCHARLESTON -- Cape Girardeau Central High's girls basketball team, currently ranked seventh in the state in Class 4A, has had a good amount of success the past few years.

It looked for a while like the same thing might happen again Thursday, but the Otahkians recovered to pull out a 66-62 victory over Murray State at the Show Me Center...\n\nMCDONALD BACK IN INDIAN GAME PLAN\n\nIt doesn't count officially as a new recruit, but Southeast Missouri State University's football program has certainly bolstered its running game in a big way.

In the 200 block of Middle Street, there were 25-35 drug dealers. They're gone, plus there were about 400-500 customers who drove in there each day buying drugs. It was like drug alley in there. ...\n\nJOURNALISTS GET NEW APPRECIATION FOR POLICE DEPARTMENT\n\nEven in a community the size of Cape Girardeau, the uniformed police officers on the street are often nameless figures who represent the full authority of law enforcement. A typical reaction from a motorist who sees a patrol car in the rear-view mirror is to step on the brake, even if the motorist isn't exceeding the speed limit...\n\nDEATH PENALTY IS SOMETIMES WARRANTED\n\nThe death penalty is no cure-all for the most heinous crimes committed in this country. But in certain cases, there seems to be a compelling argument for imposing capital punishment. It was something of a disappointment that the American Bar Association this week took its first stand ever on the issue -- calling for a moratorium on executions...\n\nDON'T MUZZLE JUDICIAL CRITICS\n\nThose of us who are interested in civil justice reform should focus our attention on St. Louis city and Jackson County, Mo. (Kansas City). In these jurisdictions, a Missouri Supreme Court rule intended to protect rural residents from the appearance of judicial impropriety has ironically resulted in an open season for plaintiffs who have little or no relationship with the state, city or county...\n\nLETTERS: THANK YOU, SENATOR SIMON\n\nTo the editor: This is an open letter to retired U.S. Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.: Dear Friend Paul: How many cards or letters have you received over the last 30 years or so which began, \"Dear Friend Paul,\" \"Dear Senator,\" \"Dear Representative\" or \"Dear Lieutenant Governor\"?

It's not because of Groundhog's Day, which I never keep up with because the rodent's never quite accurate. (See weather story, page 1A.) It's definitely not because of Valentine's Day. The only consistent Valentine I've had since reaching puberty has been my dad, and even he's been slacking off since I got married last year...\n\nTIGERS WATCH IMPRESSIVE RIVERVIEW PREVIEW 83-60\n\nIf Cape Girardeau Central High's boys basketball team wins its district -- as expected -- and Riverview Gardens of St. Louis win its district -- as expected -- the two would meet in a sectional game at the Farmington Civic Center.

The Missouri State Teachers Association recently ranked Missouri 50th in a national survey of state and local taxes as a percentage of personal income. The ranking was part of a full report on the salaries schedules and benefits of Missouri public-school teachers...\n\nTEACHER SALARIES, BENEFITS NEED BOOST, SAYS MSTA\n\nThe Missouri State Teachers Association gives public-school districts an A for effort in their progress toward improving salaries and benefits of public-school teachers in the state.

Nurses at the Cape Girardeau County Health Department screen about 100 people a month for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes or genital warts. Some 12 to 15 percent test positive for one of these ailments...\n\nMOTORIZED PLAYTHINGS FILL SHOW ME CENTER\n\nChad Shiflett was still in diapers when he rode his first motorcycle. \"It was a junior 50-cc,\" said Shiflett, who has been riding for more than 22 years. \"My father raced moto-cross and he started me out early.\" Shiflett, of Brookfield, Mo., was in Cape Girardeau Friday for the Ultra Arena-Cross moto-cross races being held as part of the Monster Truck Spectacular at the Show Me Center...\n\nSPEAKOUT\n\nI JUST read in the Missourian where somebody was trying to say that abortion became legal during a Republican president. I just want to address the fact that abortion became legal and in no other way than judicial legislation. That's where a majority of the Democrat-appointed Supreme Court justices decided that they knew better than the people who they are supposed to work for. ...\n\nSCHOOL DISTRICT PROPOSALS NEED -- AND GET -- POSITIVE NODS\n\nIt is official. The Cape Girardeau School District's campaign to promote a bond issue and tax increase received an enthusiastic kickoff Thursday night. Almost 600 boosters -- young and old -- attended the rally.

The picture goes another step and relates to us that Christ died there for you and for me...\n\nMARK MY WORD: TIME'S RELATIVE DURING THE MORNING RUSH\n\nThe sun's rosy glow spreads across the dining room. The children sit quietly at the breakfast table eating their cereal and bananas as the parents relax with the morning newspaper. Hold on. This isn't real life. This is pure fiction. Mornings are hurry-up disasters as Joni and I rush to get the kids dressed, fed and to the day care and babysitter, and still get to work by 9 a.m...\n\nOUTDOOR CORNER: CALLS OF THE WILD: SPRING KICKS IN REPRODUCTIVE INSTINCTS\n\nShadows or no shadows, Groundhog Day has come and gone. Whether or not we'll have six more weeks of winter or an early spring is debatable. However, nature affords us one certainty; the emergence of a groundhog (woodchuck) from its hibernation burrow is a sure sign that the mating season has begun...\n\nJOY ALONG THE WAY: TIME OUT FOR SENTIMENT\n\nThere are two things that happen in February that always give me a thrill. They aren't big things, they're free, and they always come as a surprise. First are the stubby green shoots of the daffodils showing above ground along the flower border. Everything appears so shabby with twigs, broken limbs, little puddles and sweet gum balls all over, but there are those thick little green shoots to remind one that it won't always be thus. ...\n\nJACKSON, CENTRAL ADVANCE WRESTLERS TO 4A SECTIONAL\n\nST. LOUIS -- Jackson High's wrestling team came away with two district champions, but did not encounter its usual success in the Class 4A, District 1 meet.

It's a great life...\n\nJACKSON INDIAN BASKETBALL TEAM LOOKING FOR CONSISTENCY\n\nMike Gross works against the Charleston Press. Larico Coleman applies the pressure. It's been a roller coaster ride for the Jackson Indians basketball team so far this season. The team started off slow with a 3-3 record.

So Dr. Christopher Goeke holds up cards with words like \"blase\" or \"soothing\" or \"puzzled\" on them. On stage, the cast members of \"The Music Man\" sing scales with feeling.

Cape has long been buzzing with rumors of major announcements that could be in the offing later this year. ...\n\nMISSOURI COMMENTARY: PRESIDENT CLINTON IS THE GREAT PERSUADER\n\nIt may go down in history as the O.J. State of the Union. The juxtaposition of the President of the United States about to make an important address on the East Coast and the Simpson verdict being announced on the West Coast put the television networks in a quandary. Choosing between what the nation needs to know and what the nation wants to know annoys the television moguls. Almost always \"wants to\" prevails over \"needs to.\"...\n\nMISSOURI WATCH: PSEUDODOXY, AND OTHER POLICY MYTHS\n\nIf you own an extremely thick copy of Webster's International Dictionary you will find the definition of a condition that creates as many problems in today's political world as Congress, Clinton and Gingrich combined. The word I have in mind is \"pseudodoxy,\" which can be defined as the holding of erroneous beliefs or convictions, and it ranks as one of my favorites when discussions in Jefferson City or Washington get around to solutions of major political dilemmas...\n\nCONCEALED-WEAPONS BILL SHOULD BE SENT TO THE GOVERNOR\n\nFor at least the fifth consecutive year, the issue of concealed weapons is before the Missouri General Assembly, this time in the form of a bill sponsored by Sen. Peter Kinder, R-Cape Girardeau. A similar House bill has been introduced by Rep. Wayne Crump, D-Potosi. As expressed in prior floor votes, both House and Senate, the proposal enjoys overwhelming bipartisan support. Lawmakers should fully debate the matter and pass the measure, daring Gov. Mel Carnahan to make good on his veto threat...\n\nCARNAHAN CATERS TO THE UNION BOSSES\n\nNews that Gov. Mel Carnahan wants his staff to compile the home addresses of all state workers, the better to turn them over to union organizers, should alarm every Missourian who cares about basic human rights, not to mention economy in government. ...\n\nLETTERS: POSITIVE POLICE COVERAGE\n\nTo the editor: On behalf of the Cape Girardeau Police Department, I would like to extend our appreciation to the journalists and photographers from the Southeast Missouri who participated in the recent 24-hour ride-along. As a result of the articles, I have received many positive comments from officers and citizens...\n\nLETTERS: UNDERSTANDING TERRORISM\n\nTo the editor: This letter is in no way intended to defend terrorism.
