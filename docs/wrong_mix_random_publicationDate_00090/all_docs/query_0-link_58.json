        "text": "A HISTORY OF\n\nSAVANNAH\n\nAND\n\nSOUTH GEORGIA\n\nBY\n\nWILLIAM HARDEN\n\nVOLUME II\n\nILLUSTRATED\n\nTHE LEWIS PUBLISHING COMPANY\n\nCHICAGO AND NEW YORK 1913\n\nHistory of Savannah and South Georgia\n\nANCESTORS OF WYMBERLET JONES DE RENNE. The first of the Jones family to come out from England to America was Dr. Noble Jones, the great-great-grandfather of Wymberley Jones De Renne, at present living upon the old family estate, Wormsloe Plantation, near Savan nah. Dr. Noble Jones was the father of Noble Wymberley Jones, the grandfather of Dr. George Jones, and the great-grandfather of George Wymberley Jones De Renne. Hereafter follow accounts in greater or less detail of the lives of each of these gentlemen, who have since their earliest connection with America been makers of her history, and prom inent and successful in a high degree.\n\nDr. Noble Jones was bred to the profession of physic and lived at Lambeth, a village in the County of Surrey, situated on the south side of the river Thames, opposite Westminster, in which county his an cestors were born and resided. Being intimately acquainted with Gen eral Oglethorpe, he was induced by the general to accompany him on his first voyage to America in 1732. This friendship lasted all their lives. After General Oglethorpe returned to England to live, he sent Colonel Jones his portrait, with his Indian pupil standing by his side, reading. This portrait was lost when Savannah was captured by the English.\n\nDr. Noble Jones' family then consisted only of his wife and two chil dren a daughter and a son, Noble Wymberley Jones. It was his first intention to accompany the general without his family, but his wife objected to being left. Having promised the General to accompany him, he concluded to bring his family, not however, with an intention of remaining permanently, but after his arrival he was so pleased with the country that he decided to stay. Before leaving England, Doctor Jones, by deeds, to which the seal of the corporation of the Trustees of the Colony of Georgia was affixed, was appointed, November 7, 1732, conservator of the peace, and on the next day, November 8, 1732, he was appointed recorder in the place of Thomas Christie. How long he remained recorder is not certain, but he still held that office in 1735, and was succeeded by Thomas Christie. He was appointed surveyor by General Oglethorpe February 1, 1734, but did not give satisfaction and was discharged by the trustees and also suspended from the office of constable, which he had held for some time. To the last office he was soon re-appointed. That he was a good surveyor was testified to by Mr. Stephens in a letter to the trustees December 31, 1740. Other letters endorsed Mr. Stephens' opinion. He was also appointed by General Oglethorpe \"Agent for the Indians,\" and for Tomo-chi-chi in partic ular.\n\n533\n\nL HER\" COULTER\n\n534\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\nDuring this time he was very active protecting the southern frontier. He writes to General Oglethorpe July 6, 1735: \"I have been twice to the most southern parts of the province; the first time upon an alarm with about fifty men (all volunteers except ye scout boat), the particu lars of which voyage (for fear of false account comes to your hands) I will send by next. The second time was with Captain Dunbar, who, I do not doubt, has informed you thereof before now.\"\n\nThe constables were responsible for the colonists attending to their military duties, and Jones and Fallowfield a*re mentioned as the two constables \"in whom the civil and military power was lodged.\" Each of these two controlled three wards.\n\nOn the 10th of April, 1738, Mr. Stephens writes: \"The two consta bles, Jones and Fallowfield (which was all we had), came early to town on the present occasion, conferring on the affair they came about, which was more immediately to look into the condition of the arms. It was resolved (for experiment's sake) to order the drum to beat immediately to arms, that thereby we might see how alert the people were and what number would get together on a sudden without previous notice. It was so done, and in less than an hour's time we saw eighty odd men in the center of the town with their proper arms, well appointed, and all able men, freeholders. Such as were absent were, almost every man, abroad busy planting.\"\n\nWhen General Oglethorpe invaded Florida and laid siege to St. Augustine, some forty volunteers under Noble Jones joined the South Carolina regiment, in which he held a lieutenant's commission. On their return the company was disbanded in Savannah, according to the Gen eral's orders, and Noble Jones was sent to Charleston to collect the pay due them.\n\nSoon after Noble Jones' arrival in the colony, he leased from the trustees the southern end of the Isle of Hope; later he received a grant from the trustees, which, in turn, was exchanged for a royal grant when the crown took charge of the colony. He named his place Wormsloe and built on it a watch house to protect Jones' Narrows. Later he built a large, tabby fort, the ruins of which are still well defined. This fort was successfully defended by his daughter Mary against a party of Indians during her father's absence. The other two-thirds of the Isle of Hope were owned by Messrs. Fallowfield and Parker. All three acted as magistrates at the same time \"by Colonel Oglethorpe's orders until the trustees' further pleasure be known.\" Wormsloe is mentioned in the London Magazine of August, 1745; \"We arrived in somewhat more than two days at the Narrows, where there is a kind of Manchicolas Fort for their defense, garrisoned from-Wormsloe, where we soon arrived. It is the settlement of Mr. Jones, ten miles southeast of Savan nah, and we could not help observing, as we passed, several pretty plan tations. Wormsloe is one of the most agreeable spots I ever saw, and the improvements of that ingenious man are very extraordinary. He commands a company of marines who are quartered in huts near his place, which is a tolerable defensive place with small arms. From this house there is a vista of near three miles cut through the woods to Mr. Whitefield's orphan house, which has a very fine effect on the sight.\"\n\nWhen the Spaniards invaded Georgia in 1742, Noble Jones who was in command of a company of scouts with General Oglethorpe's regiment on St. Simons, prepared to resist the Spanish army which had landed there. It was through his vigilance that General Oglethorpe was en abled to surprise and thoroughly defeat them at Bloody Marsh. Cap tain McCall gives the following account of this affair: \"Capt. Noble Jones, with a detachment of regulars and Indians, being out on a scout-\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n535\n\ning expedition, fell in with a small detachment of the enemy's advance, who were surprised and made prisoners. From these prisoners informa tion was obtained that the whole Spanish army was advancing. This was immediately communicated by an Indian runner to the General, who detached Captain Duribar with a company of grenadiers to join the Regulars and Indians, with orders to harass the enemy on their advance. These detachments, having formed a junction, observed at a distance the Spanish army on the march, and, taking a favorable position near a marsh, formed an ambuscade. The enemy fortunately halted within one hundred paces of this position, stacked their arms and made fires and were preparing their kettles for cooking when a horse observed some of the party in ambuscade, and, frightened at the uniform of the soldiers, began to snort and gave the alarm. The Spaniards ran to their arms, but were shot down in great numbers by Oglethorpe 's detachment, who continued invisible to the enemy, and after repeated attempts to form, in which some of their prominent officers fell, they fled with the utmost precipitation, leaving their camp equipage on the field, and never halted until they got under cover of the guns of their battery\n\nand ships.\" The first official notice of the appointment of Noble Jones as a cap\n\ntain was on the 21st of March, 184243. Egmont's Journal has this reference: \"Noble Jones, made a captain by Oglethorpe,\" but he ful filled the duties of a captain, and was so called before that date. After his return from the Spanish campaign he seems to have devoted himself to his scout boat duties (captain of which he had been named by Gen eral Oglethorpe), and to the improvement of Wormsloe. He raised mulberry trees and silk worms, and the colony in a measure depended upon him for worm seed.\n\nHe and Captain Demetree cruised together with scout boats to in tercept unlawful trading at Tybee. On December 22, 1739, \"with boat well armed he captured a schooner in Ossybaw Sound and carried her around to Tybee.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he did not neglect his military duties in Savannah, and when in 1749 Mary Musgrave, now Mary Bosomworth, assumed the title of Independent Empress, and, putting herself at the head of a large body of warriors, set out for Savannah to demand from the presi dent and council a formal acknowledgment of her assumed rights the militia was ready to receive her. President Stephens put the town into the best state of defense possible and received the Indians boldly. Jones' History of Georgia says: \"The militia was ordered under arms, and as\n\nthe Indians entered town Capt. Noble Jones at the head of a troop of horses stopped them and demanded to know whether their visit was of a friendly or hostile nature. Receiving no reply he commanded them to ground their arms, declaring that his instructions were not to suffer an armed Indian to set foot in the town, and that he was determined to enforce the order at every hazard. The Indians reluctantly sub mitted. Later, at their solicitations, their arms were returned to them, but strict orders were issued not to allow them any ammunition. When at last an amicable adjustment of existing difficulties had been effected, Mary, drunk with liquor, rushed into the Assembly and told the presi dent that the Indians were her people and that he had no business with them. Mary had been arrested and locked up and had just been released. The president calmly threatened to confine her again. Turning to Mal-\n\nachte in a great rage, she repeated to him with some ill-natured com ments what the president had said. Malatche thereupon sprung from his seat, laid hold of his arms, and calling upon the rest to follow his example, dared any man to touch his queen. In a moment the whole\n\n536\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\nhouse was filled with tumult and uproar. Every Indian having a tomahawk in his hand, the president expected nothing but instant death. During this confusion, Capt. Noble Jones, who commanded the guard, with wonderful courage interposed and ordered the Indians immediately to surrender their arms. This they reluctantly did. Mary was con veyed to a private room, where a guard was placed over her, and all further communication with the Indians was denied her during her stay in Savannah.\"\n\nAbout this time the expediency of subordinating Georgia to South Carolina was in certain high quarters seriously discussed and gave the trustees some concern. Before they could communicate with President\n\nStephens, Captain Demetree landed at Causton's Bluff with boats, which, having brought the last of Oglethorpe's disbanded regiment to Charleston on their way to England, were returning to Frederica in his charge. He had a small detachment of ten or twelve men and said that he was on his way to Frederica to assume command at that point ; that he took orders only from the governor of South Carolina, and that the trustees were cognizant of the fact. As he failed to report to the president and his assistants and disclose to them his orders or his inten tions, they were at a loss to understand his extraordinary conduct and ordered Capt. Noble Jones to wait upon him and demand an explanation of and an apology for his discourtesy. Captain Demetree's reply to Captain Jones was that he was acting under the instructions from His Grace, the Duke of Bedford, and that he was to receive his orders from and report only to the governor of South Carolina. He reluctantly appeared before the council in answer to their summons. After Cap tain Demetree had made ample apology to the council, he was permitted to assume command of the military forces stationed at Frederica. The annexation of Georgia to South Carolina was to be accomplished at this time by stationing officers from three independent South Carolina com panies in proper places in Georgia, \"to preserve the possession of the province.''\n\nOn July 13, 1750, the trustees recommended to the common council that Noble Jones be appointed an assistant in and for the province of Georgia, and the appointment under seal was sent to him July 16, 1750.\n\nOn April 18, 1751, the trustees recommended to the common council his appointment as Register of the Province, and his appointment fol lowed on May 24, 1751.\n\nAbout the middle of May of this year news came from Augusta ' that there*was fear of an Indian invasion. \" Accordingly the Magazine was examined, officers were appointed and ordered to muster and discip line the militia, a troop of horses was ordered to be raised composed of such inhabitants as were possessed of three hundred acres of land. Noble Jones was appointed Colonel, and his son, Noble Wymberley\n\nJones, who had been a cadet in Oglethorpe's regiment, was appointed to command the Dragoons.\"\n\nThe alarm was exaggerated, but it served to bring out the militia, which consisted of 220 men, infantry and cavalry, and when they paraded (on the 16th of April, 1751, under the then Capt. Noble Jones) they \"behaved well and made a pretty appearance.\" Noble Jones was appointed to '' accompany Mr. Robinson in his inquiry into the state of the colony.\" According to Mr. Habersham, he was a stiff church man and took a great deal of voluntary trouble in building the church, and in all church matters greatly aiding his friend, Rev. Mr. Zouber-\n\nbuhler.\n\nIn the last year of the trustee's government of the colony, he was\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n537\n\ncaptain of the Marines and scout boat at Wormsloe, assistant to the president, register of the province, commissioner to treat with the Indians, member of the council to report on the state of the colony, and colonel of the regiment.\n\nThe trustees surrendered the colony to the British government on\n\nthe 23d of June, 1752, and Benjamin Martin was appointed agent of the colony in England. Upon the death of President Parker, who had succeeded President Stephens (the first president of the colony appointed in April, 1741), Patrick Graham became president. His assistants were James Habersham, Noble Jones, Pickering Eobinson and Francis Harris.\n\nOn the 6th of August, 1754, Capt. John Reynolds was appointed governor of the province and Noble Jones was confirmed as member of councils. On the 27th of November, 1754, Governor Reynolds, with the advice of the board, appointed Noble Jones and William Spencer, esquires, judges to hold the approaching court of oyer and terminer, and on December 12, 1754, Noble Jones and Jonathan Bryan were appointed as judges to hold the first general court in the province.\n\nOn March 29, 1757, \"Noble Jones of His Majesty's Council, was appointed one of the new commissioners of the peace.\" This appoint ment was made before the Lords of Trade had heard from Governor Reynolds, who on Wednesday, December 15, 1756 \"acquainted the board that he had thought proper to suspend Noble Jones, Esq., from all offices, for reasons which he would lay before the king.\" Governor Reynolds \"removed Mr. Noble Jones from the board and bench to gratify Mr. Little, and it is positively affirmed, to promote the establishment of Bosomworth's titles to the Indian lands with a view to sharing the spoils.\" Governor Reynolds was summoned to England to answer for his conduct in Georgia. He embarked in a merchant vessel in February, 1757, resigning the government into the hands of Lieutenant Governor Henry Ellis, who became governor in chief on May 17, 1758. Noble Jones was re-instated by an order of the English council to Governor Ellis May 31, 1759, with his former precedence as councillor and also as senior justice of the general court.\n\nUnder Governor Ellis he was one of His Majesty's council, senior justice of the general court, colonel of the regiment and treasurer of the province, having been appointed to this last office by Governor Ellis on the 16th of February, 1760. \"He had no salary, but a commission of five per cent, which on the last year's tax amounted to sixty-five pounds sterling, and may this year amount to eighty pounds.\" Governor Ellis resigned his office on account of ill-health and handed over the government to Lieutenant-Governor James Wright, who was appointed governor in chief on the 20th of March, 1761. In the following letter to the Lords of the board of trade, Governor Wright commends Noble Jones' services as chief justice of the colony after Mr. Simpson's death and before Mr. Anthony Stokes' arrival:\n\nSAVANNAH, GA., Sept. 28, 1769. \"My Lords: I take the liberty to acquaint your lordships that Noble Jones, Esq., senior judge of the courts here, has in every respect done and performed the office and duties of chief justice from 20th of October, 1768, when Mr. Simpson died, to the arrival of Mr. Stokes; and although Mr. Jones was not bred to the law, yet I believe that justice only was administered during that time and with integrity, and I have not heard any complaint, made or fault found with his conduct. I therefore submit to your lordships whether it may not be reasonable that Mr. Jones shall receive the salary from the death of Mr. Simpson to the appointment of Mr. Stokes, and half of it from the appointment\n\n538\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\nof Mr. Stokes to his arrival here. I have given Mr. Jones two certificates of his having done his duty here and have the honor to he, my Lords, Your Lordships' most obedient and obliging servant,\n\nJAMES WEIGHT, The Right Honorable Lords of Trade,\"\n\nOn the 10th of July, 1771, Governor Wright availed himself of a leave of absence, and three days afterward Mr. James Habersham took the usual oath of office and entered upon the discharge of the guberna torial duties.\n\nIn a long letter to the Earl of Hillsborough, Governor Habersham relates that the assembly had against royal orders elected Noble- Wymberley Jones, the son of Noble Jones, three times speaker in succes sion, and that they refused to leave this fact out of their minutes on the subsequent election of Archibald Bulloch, and that he had dissolved the assembly. Noble Wymberley Jones was as ardent a patriot as Noble Jones, his father, was a thorough Royalist. His opposition to the crown and his upholding of the cause of liberty seems to have embittered Mr. Habersham, who, not able to punish the son, brought his spleen to bear upon the father. He writes to the Earl of Hillsborough, April 30, 1772: \"My Lord, it is very painful to me to say or even insinuate a disrespectful word of anyone, and every person who knows me will acknowledge that it is contrary to my disposition to dip my pen in gall; but I can not help considering Mr. Jones' conduct for some time past in opposing public business as very ungrateful and unworthy of a good man, as his family have reaped more advantages from government than any one I know in this province. f~He was several years first lieutenant and sergeant in a company of rangers paid by the crown, and in these capacities met with great indulgence. His father is the king's treasurer, and if I am not mistaken, reaps very considerable emoluments from it. But his accounts have never been clearly stated and examined by any assembly that I know of; and such an inquiry may not be agreeable. 'J Governor Wright in his speech to the assembly in October, 1770, recom mended our financial and public accounts to be examined entire but that assembly was dissolved in February following and no steps taken there in, and many people suspect that this very necessary examination operates with some to retard and impede progress. I sincerely meant to recommend this inquiry to the late assembly in the strongest terms, and as we now have no assembly I shall require the treasurer to lay before me in council a clear account of the produce of our funds, also the certificates that have been issued for different purposes, and of every account that may be necessary to post me with the state of the treasury, and after that is done I shall pursue such measures as seem necessary for the service of his majesty and the province, of which I shall inform your lordship.''\n\nThat the treasurer's accounts were examined and approved of at times by the deputy auditor and the governor, is shown by a treasury account signed \"Noble Jones, treasurer,\" February 26, 1767. Audited by Gray Elliott, Det. Aud. Gen., 6th February, and approved by James Wright 10th of February.\n\nOn further deliberation Mr. Habersham either found out that the accounts had been audited, or that an investigation was unnecessary, as there is no record of one having taken place and as Noble Jones continued treasurer until the day of his death, which occurred three years afterward, it would seem reasonable to suppose that Mr. Haber sham's fears were groundless. During Governor Wright's administra tion he took part in all important matters appertaining to Georgia,\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n539\n\nand his fidelity and absolute devotion to the crown were unswerving. In a card appearing in the Georgia Gazette, September 7, 1774, his\n\nname appears with James Habersham, Josiah Tattnall and ninety-three others, criticizing the meeting at Tondee 's Tavern in Savannah, and pro testing that the resolutions there should not be adopted as reflecting the sentiments of the people of Georgia. He performed his judicial duties up to the last. Upon the assembling of the general court on the 10th of October, 1775, one of the jurors summoned refused to be sworn. Others \"behaved insolently,\" and the conduct of the business was practically\n\nobstructed. Mr. Noble Jones, one of the associate justices, was then \"lying extremely ill.\" He died on the second of November following, at Wormsloe, and was buried near the fort on the place he loved so well. His remains were removed from Wormsloe to the colonial bury ing ground in Savannah, and later to Bonaventure cemetery near Savannah. His death was hastened by the dissensions among the Colon ists; he could not sympathize with the idea of separation from or independence of the mother country, and he saw nothing but storms and trouble ahead for his beloved Georgia. During a long life, in which he held nearly every office in the province, if he was found fault with he never failed upon investigation of the charges against him to rise higher in the public esteem. Notwithstanding the zealous patriotism\n\nof Noble Wymberly Jones, he was a devoted son, and though then first elected a member of the continental congress, remained with his father at Wormsloe until the latter's death. On Noble Jones' tombstone at\n\nBonaventure cemetery is inscribed the following:\n\nNOBLE JONES, of Wormsloe, Esq.,\n\nSENIOR JUDGE OF THE GENERAL COURT AND ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE PROVINCE OF GEORGIA.\n\nFOR TWENTY-ONE YEARS MEMBER AND SOMETIMES PRESI DENT OF HIS MAJESTY'S COUNCIL.\n\nCOLONEL OF THE FIRST GEORGIA REGIMENT.\n\nDIED NOVEMBER 2, 1775. AGED 73.\n\nW. J. DE RENNE.\n\nNoble Wymberley Jones, already mentioned in connection with some of the more important concerns of the Province of Georgia, was born near London, England, in 1723. Coming to Georgia at a tender age he secured an appointment as a cadet in Oglethorpe's regiment. Hav ing studied medicine and received his degree, he was promoted to first lieutenant, and with the rank and pay of surgeon, was assigned to a company of rangers in the pay of the crown. After a few years passed\n\nin military service he resigned from the army and entered upon the practice of his profession in Savannah. He arose rapidly in the public esteem as a citizen and physician, winning golden opinions from the\n\ncommunity. No idle spectator of passing events or indifferent to politi cal preferment, he was in 1768 elected speaker of the Lower House of the Assembly of the Province of Georgia. By that body he was placed upon a committee to correspond with Dr. Benjamin Franklin who had been appointed an agent \"to represent, solicit and truthfully account the affairs of the colony of Georgia in Great Britain\" and\n\ngave such instructions as might appear necessary for the public wel-\n\n540\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\nfare. Re-elected to this position in 1770, so pronounced and influential had become his views and conduct in opposition to the objectionable and oppressive acts of parliament, and in support of American ideals, that Governor Wright, exercising the power vested in him, refused to sanction this choice and ordered the house to select another speaker.\n\nIncensed at this affront offered to one who had been aptly termed the Morning Star of Liberty in Georgia, and resenting what they deemed an unwarrantable interference with the power resting solely with them to nominate and judge of the qualifications of their own pre siding officer, the members of the house passed resolutions complimen tary to Dr. Jones and declared that the \"sense and approbation this house entertains of his conduct can never be lessened by any slight cast upon him in opposition to the unanimous voice of the Commons House of the Assembly in particular and the Province in general.\" Criticising the action of the executive, they resolved \"that this rejection by the governor of a speaker unanimously elected was a high breach of the privileges of the house and tended to subvert the most valued rights and liberties of the people and their representatives.'' This bold asser tion the council was. pleased to stigmatize as \"a most indecent and insolent denial of his majesty's authority,\" and the governor, wielding the only punitive weapon at his command, dissolved the assembly on the 22d day of February, 1770.\n\nAdhering to the preference shown on a former occasion, and re solving to rebuke the late interference on the part of the executive, at the first session of the eighth General Assembly of the Province, convened at Savannah on the 21st day of April, 1772, the Commons house perfected its organization by electing Dr. Jones as speaker. Officially informed of this action, the Hon. James Habersham, who, during the absence of Sir James Wright, was occupying the guber natorial chair, responded: \"I have his Majesty's commands to put a negative upon the speaker now elected by the Commons House, which I accordingly do; and desire that you will inform the house that I direct them to proceed to a new choice of speaker.''\n\nDespite this inhibition, and in direct opposition to the injunction of the executive, thrice did the house adhere to its selection; and it was only by dissolving the assembly that the governor was able to carry his point. It was upon this occasion that Governor Habersham wrote the letter of April 30, 1772, to the Earl of Hillsborough, commenting at length upon this matter, and which is quoted in the foregoing date upon the life of Col. Noble Jones.\n\nThe truth is, that while Gov. Habersham was loyally seeking to carry out the instructions of the king and to support the authority of Parliament, Dr. Jones \"was in sympathy with those who considered taxation without representation as wholly unauthorized, and who were zealous in maintaining what they regarded as the reserved rights of the colonists, and the privileges of provincial legislatures.\" Both were true men but they viewed the situation from different standpoints. An honored servant of the crown, Mr. Habersham was confronted with peculiar duties and stringent oaths. Dr. Jones, on the contrary, was a representative elected by the people, was free to give expression to his own views and the sense of his constituents at an epoch when American liberty was being freely discussed and proclaimed. Of each it may be fairly said that he was pure in purpose, wise in counsel, and fearless in action, enjoying in a conspicuous degree the esteem and affection of the community. But their political paths henceforward di verged. The one clave to the crown and shared its fortunes, while the\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n541\n\nother cast his lot with the Revolutionists and became a favored leader of the patriot band.\n\nWith Archibald Bulloch, John Houstoun and John Walton, he is sued the public call on July 20, 1774, which convened the citizens of Georgia at the Watch House in Savannah. The resolutions then adopted, and the measures there inaugurated, gathering potency and allegiance as they were discussed and comprehended, proved effective in unifying public sentiment in support of the plans suggested by the Liberty Party, and paved the way for sundering the ties which bound the Province to the British empire. Of the committees then.raised to conduct the public affairs of the colony and to minister to the relief of the \" suffering poor\" of Boston, Noble Wymberley Jones was an active member. He was also elected with Archibald Bulloch and John Houstoun, a dele gate to the Continental Congress, by a convention of patriots assembled at Savannah on the 8th of December, 1774, and again by the Provin cial Congress of January, 1775. These three, concluding very properly that inasmuch as they had been nominated by the political convocation which in reality embraced only four of the twelve parishes then con stituting the Province of Georgia, they could not be justly regarded as representatives of the entire colony, were yet persuaded that the will of those who commissioned them should be formally made. known and the mind of Georgia be freely interpreted, and on the 6th of April, 1775, addressed the following communication to the president of the Continental Congress:\n\n\" Sir: The unworthy part which the Province of Georgia has a'cted in this great contest leaves room to expect little less than censure or even indignation of every virtuous man in America. Although on the one hand we feel the justice of such a consequence with respect to the Province in general, yet on the other hand, we claim an exemption from it in favor of some individuals who wished a better conduct. Permit us therefore in behalf of ourselves and many others of our fel low citizens warmly attached to the cause to lay before the respectable body over which you preside, a few facts, which we trust will not only acquit us of supineness, but also cause our conduct to be approved by all candid and ciispassionate men.\n\n\"At the time the late congress did this Province the honor to trans mit to it an extract from their proceedings, included in a friendly letter from the Honorable Mr. Middleton, the sense and disposition of the people in general seemed to fluctuate between liberty and convenience. In order to bring on a determination respecting the measures recom mended, few well affected persons in Savannah, by public advertisement in the Gazette, requested a meeting of all the parishes and districts by delegates or representatives, in Provincial Congress. On the day ap pointed for this meeting, with concern they found that only five out of twelve parishes to which they had particularly written, had nominated and sent down delegates; and even some of these five had laid their representatives under injunctions as to the form of an association. Under these circumstances those who met saw themselves a good deal embarrassed. However, one expedient seemed still to present itself. The house of assembly was then sitting, and it was hoped there would be no doubt of a majority in favor of American freedom. The plan therefore was to go through what business they could in Provincial Congress, and then with a short address to present the same to the house of assembly, who it was hoped would by votes in a few minutes and before prerogative should interfere, make it the act of the whole Province.\n\n542\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n\"Accordingly the congress framed and agreed to such an associa tion and did such other business as appeared practicable with the peo ple, and had the whole just ready to be presented, when the governor, either treacherously informed, or shrewdly suspecting the step, put an end to the session. What then, could the congress do? On the one hand, truth forbid them to call their proceedings the voice of the Province, there being but five out of twelve of the parishes concerned; on the other, they lacked strength sufficient to enforce them on the principle of necessity. They found the inhabitants of Savannah not\n\nlikely soon to give matters a favorable turn. The importers were mostly against any interruption and the consumers very much divided. There were some of the latter virtuously for the measures; others strenuously against them; but more that called themselves naturals than either. Thus situated, there appeared nothing before us but the alternative of either commencing a civil war among ourselves, or else of patiently waiting for the measures to be recommended by the general congress.\n\n\" Among a powerful people provided with men, money and con veniences, and by whose conduct others were to be regulated, the former would certainly be the result that would suggest itself to every man removed from the condition of a coward; but in a. small community like Savannah (whose members are mostly in their first advance to wards wealth and independence, destitute of even the necessities of life within themselves, and from whose junction of silence so little' would be had or lost to the general cause), the latter presented itself as the most eligible plan, and was adopted by the people. Party disputes and ani mosities have occasionally prevailed and show that the spirit of free dom is not extinguished, but only resting for a time until an oppor tunity shall offer for calling it forth.\n\n\"The congress convened at Savannah did us the honor of choosing us delegates to meet your respectable body at Philadelphia on the 10th of next month. We were sensible of the honor and importance of the appointment and would gladly have rendered our country any ser vice our poor abilities would permit of; but alas with what face could we have appeared for a Province whose inhabitants had refused to sacrifice the most trifling advantages to the public cause, and in whose behalf we did not think we could safely pledge ourselves for the exe cution of any measures whatever?\n\n\"We do not mean to insinuate that those who appointed us would prove apostate or desert their opinions, but that the tide of opposition was great; that all the strength and virtue of these our friends might not be sufficient for the purpose. We beg, sir, you will view our rea sons for not attending in a liberal point of light. Be pleased to make the most favorable representation of them to the honorable, the mem bers of congress. We believe we may take upon ourselves the satisfac tion, notwithstanding all that has passed, that there are still men in Georgia who, when occasion shall require, will be ready to evince a steady allegiance and manly attachment to the liberties of America, For the consolation of these they find themselves in the neighborhood of a Province whose virtue and magnanimity must and will do lasting\n\nhonor to the cause, and in whose fate they seem disposed freely to insolve their own.\n\n\"We have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient and very hum ble servants,\n\nNOBLE WYMBERLEY JONES, ARCHIBALD BULLOCH,\n\nJOHN HOUSTOUN.\"\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n543\n\nThe news of the affairs at Concord and Lexington reached Savannah\n\non the 10th of May and caused the wildest excitement. The thunders of the 19th of April aroused the Georgia Parishes from their lethargy and multiplied patriots within their borders. The magazines at the\n\neastern extremity of Savannah, built of brick and sunk some twelve feet under ground, contained a considerable amount of ammunition. So substantial was thus structure that Governor Wright deemed it unnecessary to post a guard for its protection. The excited revolu tionists all over the land cried aloud for powder. Impressed with the importance of securing the contents of this magazine, there quietly\n\nassembled Dr. Noble Wymberley Jones, Joseph Habersham, Edward Telfair, William Gibbons, Joseph Clay, John Milledge and some other\n\ngentlemen, at the residence of Dr. Jones, at a late hour on the night of the llth of May, 1775, and proceeding to the magazine, broke it open and removed therefrom some six hundred pounds of powder. A portion of the rest was sent to Beaufort, South Carolina, for safe keeping, and the rest was concealed in the garrets and cellars of the houses of the captors. Although Governor Wright offered a reward of one hundred and fifty pounds sterling for the apprehension of the offenders, it failed to elicit any favor, although the actors in the affair are said1 to have been well known in the council. The tradition lives and is generally credited that some of the powder so obtained was forwarded to Cam bridge and was actually expended by the patriots in the memorable battle of Bunker Hill.\n\nOn the 22d of June, 1775, in response to a call signed by Dr. N. W. Jones, Archibald Bulloch, John Houstoun and George Walton, many of the inhabitants of the town and district of Savannah assembled at the Liberty Pole in Savannah and elected a council of safety with instruc tions to maintain an active correspondence with the continental con gress and with the councils of safety both in Georgia and other prov inces, with a view to bringing about a union of Georgia with her sister colonies in the cause of freedom.\n\nOf the provincial congress which assembled in Savannah on the 4th of July, 1775, Dr. Jones was a member accredited from the \"town and district of Savannah.\" In this congress every parish was repre\n\nsented. Dr. Jones was of the committee then selected to frame a suitable address to the inhabitants of Georgia, advising them of the true nature of the disputes existing between Great Britain and her American colo nies, and informing them of the deliberations and conclusions of the present congress. He was also chosen with John Habersham, Archibald Bulloch, Rev. Dr. Zubly and Dr. Lyman Hall to represent Georgia in the Continental Congress. Georgia was now in acknowledged sympathy with her sisters and took her place by regular representation in the national assembly. Of the Council of Safety which ordered the arrest of Governor Wright, Dr. Jones was a member.\n\nUpon the capture of Savannah in December, 1778, Dr. Jones removed to Charleston, South Carolina. There, upon the fall of that city in 1780, he was taken prisoner by the British and sent in captivity to St. Augus tine, Florida. Exchanged in July, 1781, he went to Philadelphia and there entered upon the practice of his profession. While a resident of that city he was elected to the Continental Congress by the General Assembly of Georgia.\n\nShortly after its evacuation by the king's forces in 1782, Dr. Joaes returned to Savannah, repaired the desolations which war had wrought' in his comfortable home, and resumed his professional labors. He was a member of the committee which received and saluted President Wash ington with an address of welcome upon the occasion of his visit to\n\n544\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\nSavannah in 1791. Dr. Jones presided over the constitutional convention which assembled at Louisville, Jefferson county, in May, 1795, and amended the constitution of Georgia. In 1804 he was president of the Georgia Medical Society. He died in Savannah, January 9. 1805,\n\nhonored by the community as an accomplished gentleman, an influential citizen, a skillful physician and a sterling patriot.\n\nOf his son. Dr. George Jones, no fitter expression as to his life and work might be made than is embodied in a set of resolutions adopted at a meeting of the bar of the federal and state courts, at the court\n\nhouse in Savannah, on November 14, 1838, on the day following his death. Here is given entire the resolutions adopted on that sad occasion: \"Dr. George Jones, a distinguished citizen of Savannah, died November 13,1838. His career of public service began in early youth. He endured,\n\nthe last two years of the Revolutionary war, the hardships of a soldier, and manifested, in confinement on board an English prison ship, the fortitude and constancy of a youthful patriot. When the war was\n\nconcluded, though still a very young man, he received strong proofs of public confidence by being placed in official relations to his fellow citizens, the duties of which required the ability, discretion and industry of matured manhood. He was subsequently one of Georgia's prominent legislators, and in the convention which framed our present constitution, was a leading member as a delegate from Chatham county. He was frequently afterward a member of the general assembly in both branches. Its history shows him to have been pure and disinterested, at all times inflexible in support of correct principles and in opposition to those schemes of personal aggrandizement which were unfortunately corruptly\n\nconsummated by the alienation of the most valuable portion of the state's territory. The estimation in which his character and attainments were held induced the legislature, though he was not a lawyer, to elect him judge of the superior court for the eastern circuit. His demeanor as a judge was dignified, courteous and patient, and when he voluntarily retired from the appointment it was regretted by the bar, the officers of the court and the public. From the bench he was transferred to the senate of the United States. His services in that capacity being ter minated, he was called by general consent to other stations of usefulness.\n\n'' It was truly said of him that he took office from a sense of obligation rather than from any desire for distinction. He was for many years\n\none of the members of the superior court, and its record showed that he was a faithful administrator of its duties, vigilant in all that regarded the rights of the widow and orphan. He served efficiently as mayor of Savannah for two years, from September, 1812, to September, 1814.\n\n\"He was amiable, philanthropic, considerate, firm, forbearing, deli\n\ncate in his intercourse with society. He had a modesty in speech and manner, at all times and to all persons, worthy of remembrance and imitation, and to these graces were added the belief and humility of a\n\nChristian.'' In setting forth details concerning the life- of George Wymberley-\n\nJones De Renne, it has seemed expedient to make free quotation of\n\nexcerpts from an address given by a prominent resident of Savannah\n\non an occasion of considerable importance. Here follows portions of\n\nthe address referred to; with occasional paraphrase:\n\n\"Although born in the city of Philadelphia on the 19th of July,\n\n1827, Mr. George Wymberley-Jones DeRenne, was in every thought\n\nand emotion, a Georgian most loyal. In the paternal line he was the\n\ndirect descendant of Col. Noble Jones, the trusted lieutenant of\n\nOglethorpe, his great-grandson, to speak in exact terms, and the grand\n\nson of Noble Wymberley Jones. And among the patriot names shedding\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n545\n\nlustre upon the period when our people were engaged in the effort to rid themselves of kingly rule, none in Georgia was more conspicuous for purity of purpose, wisdom of counsel and fearlessness in action than was he. Speaker of the provincial legislature at a time when it was no light matter to incur the displeasure of a royal governor, arrested and confined because of his sympathy with the revolutionists, and upon the termination of the war, selected a representative from Georgia in the congress, as physician, legislator, patriot, citizen, he won the confidence and esteem of all.\n\n'' Thus does it appear that Mr. De Renne was the legitimate inheritor, in the fourth generation, of illustrious traditions and of memories per sonal and precious connected with the history and honor of Georgia. With him they were family legacies. He accepted them as such, and the allegiance which bound him to home and state was inseparable from the ties which united him to kindred and lineage. They .were indissolubly interwoven, and whenever the name of Georgia was uttered, there came heart throbs of loyalty and pride most peculiar and pleasureable.\n\n,'' The first eleven years of his life, that tender period when impres\n\nsions the most abiding are formed, when loves are cemented which the vicissitudes of subsequent age cannot impair, that morning of existence whose sunlight fades not from memory, were passed at Wormsloe on the Isle of Hope, the abode of his ancestors. There in infancy were his loves of Georgia begotten. There was his knowledge of home and country localized. There were attachments born which remained ever part and parcel of his inner being.\n\n\"When not yet twelve years old, upon the death of his father, he accompanied his mother to Philadelphia. There he pursued his academic studies and was, in due course, admitted as a member of the collegiate department of the University of Pennsylvania. His proficiency in the acquisition of knowledge, and his intellectual capabilities attracted the notice and evoked the commendation of his teachers. It was natural that he should seek an education in that city and from that institution, for both were allied to him by ties of no ordinary significance. His maternal grandfather, Justice Thomas Smith, had been for many years a prominent lawyer and a distinguished judge in Philadelphia, and his maternal great-uncle, the Rev. William Smith, D.D., was\n\nthe first provost of the institution now known as the University of Pennsylvania, He was a noted teacher, an accomplished writer and an eloquent divine. A native of Scotland and a graduate of the University of Aberdeen, shortly after his removal to America he identified himself with all that was progressive and of high repute in the City of Brotherly Love. After a long life spent in the rendering of important service to the literary, educational and religious interests of the country, he died in the city of his adoption on the 14th of May, 1803. His scholarly works and the institutions he founded are living monuments to his memory.\n\n\"In his maternal home, and upon the benches whence had gone forth many who had been instructed by his distinguished relative, Mr. De Renne found opportunity for earnest study. Graduating with honor,\n\nand selecting medicine as the profession best suited to his tastes, he became a private pupil of Dr. Samuel Jackson and entered the medical school of the University of Pennsylvania, This college was at that time probably the most noted in the United States, and the facilities there afforded for mastering the mysteries of the healing art were unsurpassed this side of the Atlantic. Mr. De Renne's graduating thesis was entitled 'Theory Concerning the Nature of Insanity.' It was, in 1847, privately\n\n546\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\nprinted, to the number of forty-eight copies, for special distribution. Striking in thought and composition is this production, indicating an amount of careful research, delicate analysis, and philosophical deduc tion quite uncommon in one who had barely attained unto his majority. It elicited the praise of his preceptors, who earnestly hoped that his talents and acquirements would be consecrated to the calling which sweeps in its high scope the whole range of physical and moral science. But with Mr. De Renne there was no intention of applying himself to the active pursuit of the profession to the privileges of which he had just been admitted as a doctor of medicine. His affections turned to his island home beneath the Georgia magnolias, and his thoughts were of a quiet, independent' life, devoted to the exhibition of hospitality, the pursuit of literature, and the enjoyment' of dignified repose.\n\n\" Shortly after graduation he repaired to Wormsloe and there fixed his residence. With all its wealth of magnificent live-oaks, palmettoes, pines, cedars and magnolias, with its quiet, gentle views, balmy airs, soft sunlight, swelling tide, inviting prospects and cherished traditions, this attractive spot had uninterruptedly -continued to be the home of his ancestors from the date of its original cession from the crown to his great-grandfather, Capt. Noble Jones. Here were the remains of the tabby fortification which he had constructed for the protection of his plantation, then an outpost of the town of Savannah, and there, vine covered and overshadowed by oaks and cedars, they will endure for unnumbered years, constituting one of the most unique and interesting historical ruins on the Georgia coast. During his residence at this charming abode, which continued, with occasional absences, until the late war between the states, Mr. De Renne guarded his ancestral domain with the tender care and devotion of a loyal son, adding to the recol lections of the past literary and cultivated associations in the present, which imparted new delights to the name of Wormsloe.\n\n\"His carefully selected library contained works of high repute, and of great rarity in certain departments. His reading was varied and accurate. Communing often with his favorite authors, he maintained an active acquaintance with the ever expanding domain of .scientific and philosophical inquiry. His liberal education, enriched by study, travel and observation, enabled him to appreciate and cultivate those standards in literature and art which give birth to the accurate scholar and the capable critic.\n\n\"To familiarize himself with the history of Georgia and rescue her - traditions from forgetfulness were ever his pleasure and pride. During his sojourn in London he obtained favored access to the records in the various public offices and to the treasures of the British Museum. Thence did he procure copies of all papers throwing light upon the early life of the colony. We have no hesitation in expressing the opinion that in a thorough acquaintance with the history of Savannah and that of Georgia, both as a colony and a state, he was excelled by none.\n\n\"During his residence on the Isle of Hope the literary tastes of Mr. De Renne found expression in the following publications, with one exception bearing the imprint of Wormsloe, and executed in the\n\nhighest style of the printer's art. \"In 1847 he reprinted the rare and valuable political tract by\n\nGeorge Walton, William Few. and Richard Howley, entitled 'Observa tions upon the effects of certain late political suggestions, by the Dele gates of Georgia,' Two years afterward appeared the caustic ' Observa tions on Dr. Stevens' History of Georgia.' In 1849 was issued the second of the Wormsloe quartos, entitled 'History of the Province of Georgia; with Maps of Original Surveys; by John Gerar William\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n547\n\nDeBrahm, His Majesty's Surveyor General, for the Southern District of North America,' This was a most valuable publication. DeBrahm's manuscript, from which the portion relating to Georgia was thus printed, exists in the library of Harvard University, at Cambridge, Massachu setts. Mr. De Renne did for Georgia what Mr. Weston has accomplished for South Carolina. The- next year the third of the Wormsloe quartos presented the interesting 'Journal and Letters of Eliza Lucas,' the mother of Generals Charles Cotesworth and Thomas Pinckney.\n\n\"So charmed was Mr. De Renne with 'A Bachelor's Reverie' by Ik Marvel, that in 1850, by permission of and as a compliment to the author, he had a beautiful edition of twelve copies privately printed.\n\n\"In 1851 Mr. De Renne published, as his fourth Wormsloe quarto, the 'Diary of Col. Winthrop Sargent, Adjutant General of the United States Army during the Campaign of 1791.' Only such portion of the diary was printed as related to St. Glair's expedition. Of these quartos but a very limited edition was printed, and the copies were donated to famous libraries and placed in the hands of favored friends. Of the first quarto there are only twenty-one copies; of the second, fortynine ; of the third, nineteen; and of the fourth, forty-six. They are all remarkable specimens of typography and literary taste; and, in addi tion to the historical value they possess, are highly esteemed because of their rarity.\n\n\"Soon after the inception of the war Mr. De Renne transferred his residence from Wormsloe to the city of Savannah. The desolations consequent upon the failure of the Confederate cause pressed sorely upon the coast region of our state, sadly altering the conveniences of life, changing the whole theory of our patriarchial civilization, and begetting isolation and solitude where formerly existed inviting man sions, the centres of sympathies and social life which in their essential characteristics can never be revived.\n\n\"His residence in Savannah, the abode of the choicest hospitality, within whose walls dwelt comfort, refinement and elegance most attrac tive, could never in his affections supplant the love he cherished for the old homestead on the Isle of Hope. During the winter and spring^ one day in each week he dedicated to the sweet influences of Wormsloe, where secluded from the turmoil of busy life, he surrendered himself to the contemplation of scenes and the revivification of memories upon which time had placed its seal of consecration.\n\n'' Of the public spirit which characterized Mr. De Renne as a citizen of Savannah, the public spirit of a high-toned, independent gentleman solicitious for the general welfare, yet courting neither personal advant age nor political preferment, of the sterling qualities which he exhibited in the business affairs of life and in the administration of his ample fortune, of the active and intelligent interest he manifested in every thing promotive of the material and intellectual progress of the city, of his many charities, unheralded at the times of their dispensation, I may not speak. They are fresh in the recollection of us all. Were he here he would tolerate no mention of them, and now that he is gone, as his friend, I will do no violence to his known wishes.\n\n\"I cannot refrain, however, from reminding you of two princely gifts which will identify his memory with Savannah so long as human structures endure. I refer to his munificent donation of a commodious and substantial building on West Broad street to be used as a public school for the education of the children of citizens of African descent, and to his presentation, to the Ladies' Memorial Association, of that admirable bronze statue of a Confederate soldier which surmounts the monument erected by fair hands in the military parade of Savannah in honor of our Confederate dead.\n\nVol. II 2\n\n548\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n\"A meeting of the Ladies' Memorial Association was held June 3d,\n\n1879, at six o 'clock, at the lecture room of the Independent Presbyterian church, when, after the transaction of the usual routine of business, the following communication from Mr. G. W. J. De Renne was submitted by the president and ordered to be read:\n\n\"SAVANNAH, MAY 21, 1879. \"To the President of the Ladies' Memorial Association, Savannah:\n\n\" 'MADAM: In pursuance of the proposition made and accepted in April of last year, I now present to the Ladies' Memorial Association a bronze statue of a Confederate soldier.\n\n\" 'It represents him as he was, marked with the marks of service in features, form and raiment; a man who chose to be rather than to seem, to bear hardship than to complain of it; a man who met with unflinching firmness the fate decreed him, to suffer, to fight and to die in vain.\n\n\" 'I offer the statue as a tribute to the \"MEN\" of the Confederate army. Without name or fame or hope of gain, they did the duty appointed them to do. Now, their last fight fought, their suffering over, they lie in scattered graves throughout our wide Southern land, at rest at last, returned to the bosom of the loved Mother they valiantly strove to defend.\n\n\" 'According to your faith, believe that they may receive their reward in the world to come: they had none on earth.\n\n\" 'With the expression of my profound respect for those women of the South who, true to the dead, have sought to save their memory from perishing, I am, madam,\n\nVery respectfully, etc., G. W. J. DE RENNE. '\n\n\"The following resolutions were then offered and unanimously adopted by a rising vote:\n\n\" 'Whereas our fellow citizen, G. W. J. De Renne, has presented to this association the bronze statue of a Confederate soldier now crowning the monument erected in the military parade of this city to the memory of the soldiers who perished for the cause they held more precious than life;\n\n'' ' Therefore, Resolved, that we, as members of this association, indi\n\nvidually and as a body, do hereby unanimously express our grateful appreciation of this noble gift; recognizing its great merit not only as a work of art, but as a signal ornament to our beloved city, and as a valued contribution to the public sentiment worthy of the munificent and solemn purpose of the donor.\n\n\" 'Resolved, that we do hereby accept this tribute with profound gratitude, and, in the name of all who are true to these heroic dead, we reverently consecrate it to the memory of the Confederate army who 'went down in silence/\n\n\" 'Resolved, that two copies of these proceedings be signed by each of the officers of this association; one copy to be presented to G. W. J. De Renne, Esq., and the other to the Georgia Historical Society, with the request that it may be placed for preservation in the archives of\n\nthe society. HENRIETTA COHEN, President. S. C. WILLIAMSON, Treasurer.\n\nS. C. MANN, Secretary.'\n\n\"Thus are the name, the generosity and the patriotism of G. W. J. De Renne indissolubly linked with the holiest monument erected within the confines of the monumental city: a monument redolent of the\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n549\n\nprayers, the loves and the tears of mother, wife, sister, daughter; a\n\nmonument crystallizing in towering and symmetrical form the memories of the Confederate struggle for independence; a monument standing as a spotless, imperishable, just tribute to our Confederate dead.''\n\nHON. CHARLES GORDON EDWARDS. In March, 1907, there took his place in the Congress of the United States, representing the First District\n\nof Georgia, a young statesman of the type upon which the south founds its hope the Hon. Charles Gordon Edwards, of Savannah. So excel\n\nlent was the record made by him in the Sixtieth Congress that he was returned at the next election. He is particularly well fitted by nature and training for the duties of his office and combines in himself the theoretical and practical, which produces the man who begets great ideas and knows how to make them realities. He has carried with him to the National Assembly well defined and unfaltering ideas of duty towards his constituents and is in refreshing contrast to the self-seeking politician who has proved the menace of modern society. In truth he has been very successful in keeping his political skirts free from cor\n\nruption. As a lawyer he has already taken rank among the most able\n\nin the city. Mr. Edwards is a native son of Georgia, his birth having occurred\n\nin Tattnall county, July 2, 1878. His parents are the Hon. Thomas J. and Annie (Conley) Edwards, who reside at Daisy, Tattnall county, the former being, indeed, a life-long resident of that section. He served with distinction as a Confederate soldier in the war between the states, enlisting as a member of the Fifth Georgia Cavalry, but early in the great conflict he became a courier on the staff of Gen. Bob Anderson, in which capacity he spent the greater part of his army service. He became one of the best known and most highly trusted couriers in the Confederate army, his services taking him from northern Virginia through the Carolinas and Virginia to Florida, His military career it would be impossible to exceed in interest, filled as it was with thrilling adventures and escapes from the enemy. The forbears of the subject on both sides of the family have for many years been identified with this part of the south. His paternal grandfather, Dr. William H. Ed wards, was one of the pioneers of the county and assisted in laying the paths straight and clean for the coming of latter day civilization. His great-grandfather, Willis F. Edwards, was a soldier in the Continental line from North Carolina in the Revolutionary war, and at the con clusion of his services in the cause of independence, he settled in Georgia. The maternal grandfather, Rev. William Fletcher Conley, also a pioneer of Tattnall county, assisted in the suppression of the Indians. He was a son of William F. Conley, a Virginian and a soldier in the Revolutionary war. Thus it will be seen that the gentleman from Georgia is a thorough American, which in this day of foreign in vasion is coming to be a notable distinction.- He has inherited the patriotism of his ancestors and is very loyal to American institutions,\n\nMr. Edwards received an excellent education, attending the Gordon Institute at Barnesville, Georgia; the University of Florida; and the University of Georgia. He graduated in the law department of the latter in the class of 1898, receiving the degree of B. L. He immediately began the practice of law at Reidsville, the county seat of Tattnall county, where he remained until December, 1900, in which year he located permanently in the city of Savannah. Here he soon found the recognition to which his gifts entitled him. Upon first arriving he formed a partnership with Capt. R. J. Travis and later with A. L.\n\n550\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\nAlexander. The latter partnership existed until his election to Con\n\ngress. In the election of 1906, Mr. Edwards was elected to Congress, repre\n\nsenting the First District of Georgia and throughout the city there was at that time and still persists a conviction that the right man had triumphed and that the interests of the people would be well represented. He took his seat in the National Assembly on March 4,1907, as a member of the Sixtieth Congress. He was reelected in 1909 and on March 4, 1910, became a member of the Sixty-first Congress. At the time of his appearance in the Sixtieth Congress he was the youngest member of that body. Mr. Edwards has in every way justified the confidence of his constituents and has made a fine record for practical usefulness, all of which has made him justly beloved in Savannah and throughout the First District. He is a member of the important Rivers and Harbors Committee, one of the seven big committees of the House. He is also a member of the Committee on Elections, in which committee he is ranking Democrat, ranking next to the chairman. He is identified with the Com\n\nmittee on Alcohol Liquor Traffic and he has taken part in the enactment of much important legislation. At home, in state affairs, it was largely through his agitation, eloquent and logical, that the Georgia State Drainage Law was enacted, under which a vast acreage of rich land, particularly in the vicinity of Savannah and in southeast Georgia is being scientifically drained and reclaimed for agricultural purposes. As such land is now practically waste land the beneficence of this meas ure will readily be seen, and will conduce in material fashion to the prosperity of the section. It will result not only to adding greatly to the agricultural wealth of the state by coming under cultivation, but it will also have a tendency to decrease malaria and other diseases arising from low, swampy and flooded lands.\n\nBesides his work as a statesman and in the law profession, Mr. Ed wards in commercial life has substantial interests in naval stores, saw mills, farming and banking. He was formerly a member of the Oglethorpe Light Infantry in Savannah, in which he became a lieutenant. He is a member of Epworth Methodist Episcopal church, and a trustee of the Southern Methodist College at McRae, Georgia. He has many fraternal and social affiliations, being identified with Sigma Nu frater nity, the Knights of Pythias, the Odd Fellows, the Elks, the Oglethorpe Club, the Georgia Bar Association, the Savannah Bar Association, the Sons of Confederate Veterans, and he is also a Knight Templar Mason and a Shriner.\n\nMr. Edwards was happily married December 17, 1902, his chosen lady being Miss Ora Beach, of Waycross, Georgia, daughter of Hon. William W. and Margie (Hinson) Beach. They share their hospitable and attractive home with one son, Charles Beach Edwards.\n\nHON. WILLIAM W. OSBORNE is a member of the firm of Osborne &\n\nLawrence, general practitioners of law. The firm has been general\n\ncounsel for the Savannah Electric Company, which has operated the\n\nstreet railway system since 1897. Mr. Osborne has been a member of the\n\nstate legislature from Chatham county, session of 1892-93, and state\n\nsenator in the session of 1894-95. While in the lower house he was chair\n\nman of the committee on immigration and in the upper, chairman of\n\nthe committee on railroads.\n\n*\n\nMr. Osborne was born at Graniteville, October 19, 1867. His par\n\nents were John H. H. and Mary Stoney (Wilson) Osborne. The former\n\nwas born at Sparta, Georgia, and the latter in Savannah, Georgia. In\n\nhis early childhood, Mr. Osborne removed with his parents to Savannah.\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n551\n\nHe was reared in this city. Here he received his public school educa tion, graduating from the high school in 1882. For his higher educa tion he became a student in Mercer University at Macon in 1882 and 1883. The following year he entered the University of Georgia at Athens, from which institution he was graduated in 1885. With the idea of adopting the law as his profession he entered the law office of Denmark & Adams and was admitted to the bar on December 7, 1886. For a time he practiced alone, but subsequently formed a partnership with the late Pope Barrow, a gentleman of many distinctions, who had been United States senator and who later became judge, This part nership continued from 1894 until 1902, and in the year last mentioned, Mr. Osborne formed a second partnership with Alexander L. Lawrence, which has continued to this day.\n\nIn 1906, Mr. Osborne organized the Exchange Bank of Savannah, and is president of the same. In 1910-1911, Mr. Osborne was elected to the office of president of the Georgia Bankers' Association. In addition\n\nto the foregoing honors, Mr. Osborne was elected and served as solicitor general for the eastern circuit, superior court, for three terms of four years each, his tenure of office extending over the period comprised within the dates January 1, 1896, and January 1,1908.\n\nMr. Osborne was married in 1894 to Miss Louet!e Dale. They have two daughters: Kate Dale and Mary Stoney.\n\nGEORGE J. MILLS. One of Savannah's leading citizens is George J. Mills, who has come to attain an admirable and influential position among the able financiers of the city. The success attained in his busi ness enterprises has been greatly owing to his steady persistence, stern integrity and excellent judgment, qualities which cause him to take rank with the eminent men in this section of the state, besides winning for him the confidence and esteem of the public to a marked degree. Mr. Mills was born in this city on the 7th day of June, 1850, the son of Capt. J. G. and Hettie Mariah (Cope) Mills. Captain Mills was born at St. Marys, Camden county, Georgia. For a long number of years before the war he was a prominent figure in maritime affairs on the Atlantic ocean. Starting as a youth before the mast, he was promoted through his own merit and efficiency to higher positions and became the master of a sailing vessel. Later Captain Mills went into the ocean shipping business for himself; he established and for several years was the owner of the Mills line of sailing vessels, operating between Savan nah and Liverpool, and in this business he accumulated a comfortable fortune, all the more creditable from the fact that he started in with nothing. The Mills line of sailing vessels had to go out of business on account of the war, and after the termination of sectional hostilities, Captain Mills became a member, with his brother, of the firm of T. R. & J. G. Mills, cotton merchants of Savannah; which business was continued until about 1874, when Captain Mills retired from active business life. He died on September 24, 1880.\n\nMr. Mills is bound to Savannah by all the most important associa tions of life. He was reared and educated in the city of his birth and has been in business here ever since he became of age. He found his first field of occupation in his father's cotton business, and afterward, with the elder gentleman went into the private banking business, in which he continued after the demise of Captain Mills. His unusually fine business qualifications have brought success to a number of enter prises. He is a capitalist, having large financial interests in various important commercial and industrial concerns and he is one of the financial bulwarks of Savannah. He is chairman of the Sinking Fund\n\n552\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\nCommission of Savannah. He was made a member of this commission in 1907, and has served upon it continuously since that time. He is a director of the Central of Georgia Railway; a director of the Merchants' National Bank; and a director, or stockholder in various other corporatons. He has also acted efficiently and with public spirit in various philanthropic movements in the city and is president of the Savannah Hospital Association and a director of the Savannah Port Society. He is chairman of the board of trustees of the Independent Presbyterian church. Regarded as a citizen, Mr. Mills belongs to that useful and helpful type of men, whose ambitions and desires are centered and directed in those channels through which flows the greatest and most permanent good to the greatest number. His sympathies are ever with his less fortunate brothers and with no one is the betterment of the \"other half\" a more vital issue.\n\nMr. Mills was married in Savannah, Miss Euphemia F. Postell, member of a prominent South Carolina family of that name, becoming his wife. Mrs. Mills is a sister of that well-known gentleman, Col. C. Postell, of Savannah. Their daughter, Sarah C., is the wife of Henry W. Hodge, a civil engineer and bridge builder of New York City.\n\nHON. GEORGE W. TIEDEMAN. Savannah for three elections chose the same man for her chief executive. Such confidence is sufficient proof of the worth of the Hon. George W. Tiedeman, ex-mayor of Sa vannah. Before becoming identified with the civic affairs of the city, Mr. Tiedeman had won prominence as an able and energetic business man, and he has carried his methods of doing business into the direction of the city's affairs. His administration was productive of many public improvements, and was particularly diligent in measures for the protec tion of the public health and the proper sanitation of the city, and for its freedom from bribery and misuse of funds, such as most American cities of today have to endure. The movement for a \" Greater Savan nah\" received the most enthusiastic support from the administration, and the great stride forward that Savannah has taken in recent years is due in no small part to the personal influence of Mr. Tiedeman. His whole administration not only thought for the present but made prep aration for the future. In the optimistic mind of Mr. Tiedeman, there has never been the least doubt but that Savannah would have a promi nent place among the greater American cities and in his plans for her welfare he looked far ahead and attempted to meet the demands of such a city as it now seems certain Savannah will become. In short, to quote the words of William Harden, the administration of Mr. Tiedeman .\"has been essentially a constructive administration.\"\n\nMr. Tiedeman was born on the llth of September, 1861, in Charles ton, South Carolina. Here he was reared and educated, imbibing with the lessons he learned at school, the fine ideals and courtesy of bearing for which the men of this old city are noted. Growing up during the years following the Civil war he of necessity saw the courage with which a defeated people took up their burdens and set out to bring order out of chaos. He was only a boy during the greatest period of suffering, but his impressionable mind was impressed by the love that the people of the South bore for their country, and by the way in which they set to work to repair the ravages of war. He determined at this time that when he grew to manhood he would do everything in his power to make his country as prosperous as she was before the war. He was educated in private schools and in Charleston College, and in 1887 he came to\n\nSavannah. He went into the wholesale grocery business on his arrival in the\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\ncity and since that time he has been successfully engaged in this line of business. In addition to his political 'activities he has been promi nent in the world of finance and in society. He is president of the Georgia State Savings Association. He is a member of the Board of Trade and of the Chamber of Commerce. In the world of sport and of society he is much sought after, and is a member of the Oglethorpe Club, the Yacht Club, the Automobile Club and the Golf Club.\n\nMr. Tiedeman received considerable preparatory training for his present position through his service as an alderman, for he was brought to a clear realization of the great necessity for improvement in many branches of the public affairs through this close connection with them. He was elected mayor in January, 1907, for a term of two years, was re-elected in January, 1909, and again in January, 1911. Savannah has never passed through a more prosperous period. She has held her proud position of being the largest market in the world for naval stores; her business, both in exports and imports, has been greatly increased and indeed she has advanced to the rank of fifth city in the United States in amount and value of exports. Many new industries have found a location in the city, and trade in all branches has received an impetus. The city limits have been extended, and during the season of 1911-12, the record for handling and exporting cotton was broken.\n\nIt is not possible to mention all of the beneficial results of Mayor Tiedeman's administration, and only the more important and those which will have the most far reaching results can be mentioned. Among these is the part that the city has had in the improvement of that beau tiful southern section which is now the site of some of the finest homes in the city. This tract of land is owned by the Chatham Land & Hotel Company and the Ardsley Park Land Corporation, and this land has been brought within the city limits on a lot basis, thus increasing the taxable values of the municipality, and aiding in the rapid develop ment of the section. A large amount of street paving has been done, greater in extent than has been completed during any previous period of the same duration. Some of this paving had been agitated for years but things seemed to stand still until Mr. Tiedeman appeared on the scene. For a city as dependent as is Savannah upon her harbor, it had been allowed to fall into a shameful state of disrepair and one of the most necessary deeds of the administration was the repair of all the slips and public docks. The water system and the storm sewerage system were extended to meet the needs of the growing city, and the street lighting system was practically made over by the installation of a new type of more brilliant lights in every section of the city. Bonaventure cemetery was developed and put in its present beautiful con dition, and Baffin Park was also improved and thrown open to the pub lic. The fine statue of General Oglethorpe, upon which work had ceased to be done for lack of funds, was now completed, the necessary money being appropriated for the purpose from the public treasury. Several thousands of dollars were spent in the laying of concrete and stone side walks, and an ordinance that was of especial importance to people of all classes was passed. This was a milk ordinance, and the officers of the administration have been extremely careful that this law should be enforced.\n\nThe achievement which stands out above all the others, and which brought to Mr. Tiedeman the thanks of a devoted city was the successful culmination of the bond election on December 6, 1911, by which the city is given the authority to spend $600,000 for the extension and completion of the sewerage and drainage system. This is one of the most beneficent measures ever passed in Savannah, for situated as the\n\n554\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEOKGIA\n\ncity is, drainage is a question of supreme importance to the health of the people. The work is to be carried on under the direction of a drain age commission composed of a number of the leading citizens. Mr. Tiedeman had long ago seen the necessity of such a measure, but'he had not been able to make the city feel the necessity of it. In the election in which this was the issue Mr. Tiedeman took personal charge of the campaign, and carried it to a successful termination. He did not spare either his time or energy in placing before the public the necessity of this measure, and he set forth the advantages of the ordinance in so clear and sincere a manner that it was passed by an overwhelming ma jority. He has received full credit for his work in the formulation of the ordinance when it was as yet on paper, and the people have appre ciated to the full his careful and painstaking selection of men of abil ity for members of the commission, who might be trusted with the\n\nadministration of so large a sum of money. Mr. Tiedeman is very anxious to have some form of civil service regulation for all civil ser vice employees, thus abolishing the old cries of favoritism, and secur ing more skilled service. He has strongly recommended this in his messages to the city council, and he is also a sincere advocate of a com mission form of government.\n\nMr. Tiedeman was married in 1890 to Miss Floride Shivers of Savannah. In addition to their beautiful summer home at the Isle of Hope, they have a handsome city residence, and wherever they may be, their friends are always sure of a welcome. They are the parents of two children, Miss Inez Tiedeman and Carsten Tiedeman. Savan nah is fortunate in having had such a mayor, for in the wave of progress and the new life that has swept over the South in the last few years, a strong hand is needed at the helm of those cities that will eventually become the great southern centers of trade. Some southern cities have suffered under the rule of a demagogue, and some from one who was too weak to rule and lacked the power of initiative, therefore Savannah should be proud that the man who for six years was at the head of her affairs was strong, conscientious, eager to do what will benefit the peo ple and the city, and possessed of the brain and the wisdom to plan and carry out the necessary measures.\n\nABRAHAM MINIS. In the South, where family ties still bind and names still count, the Minis family are reckoned of the blue blood of Georgia, their history dating from colonial times and the grandfather of Abraham Minis having been the first male white child born in Georgia. The family is a historic one and it has been prominent in the history of the city for many generations. Abram Minis, youngest son of Abraham Minis, does not shine merely in the reflected light of his forefathers, but he is a citizen of ability, a lawyer of high standing at the bar and a man of property.\n\nAbraham Minis, the second son of Isaac and Dinah Minis, was born in Savannah in 1820, and, in early youth was sent North to a school in\n\nWestchester, Pennsylvania, which stood very high and was kept by a Frenchman, a Mr. Bolmar.\n\nHere he remained until the age of sixteen when, owing to his father having encountered business reverses, he determined to become selfsupporting, a resolution which he carried out absolutely.\n\nSecuring a position with Padleford & Fay, then one of the leading houses on the Bay, it was characteristic of the man that he never filled another clerkship and that the heads of the firm became his warmest,\n\nlifelong friends. Entering for himself the commission business, associated with Mr.\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n555\n\nJames H. Johnston, the firm being Minis & Johnston, he continued actively engaged in this pursuit until the day of his death, although, in consequence of years, the business changed to that of shipping.\n\nMr. Johnston retiring, Mr. Minis carried on the work alone until two of his sons were associated with him under the firm name of A. Minis & Sons.\n\nOne who knew him best wrote of him: \"From his earliest years his course was one of duty well performed. Quiet and modest, yet firm and brave, he noted well his part as son, brother, husband, parent, neighbor and citizen. With no ambition but to be right, his amiable. qualities made him beloved and respected by all who knew him, while all he did was based upon strictly moral and religious principle, unswerved by fear or favor.\"\n\nAll through the dark days of the yellow fever epidemic of 1876 he, with his eldest son, Mr. J. F. Minis, remained in Savannah doing all in his power, for those who needed assistance, in a quiet, unostentatious way of which the world knew nothing. His nature was one of the noblest simplicity, combined with the utmost moral strength and a deep sense of justice guided his every action.\n\nThe affection he inspired in the humble and lowly was attested when the longshoremen who had worked for him, as a spontaneous tribute, marched in a body to his funeral.\n\nMany positions sought him. He rendered service as an alderman, acting as mayor, during the absence of that functionary, was a director of the Southern Bank and of the Central Railroad & Banking Company of Georgia.\n\nFor years he devoted much of his busy life to the presidency of the Union Society, and unbounded were his zeal and enthusiasm in behalf of this noble charity.\n\nAt the breaking out of the Civil war, physical disabilities rendering military service impossible, he entered the commissary department at Savannah, and, to help the cause, invested a large proportion of his means in Confederate bonds, although he had always been apprehensive of what proved to be the result of the desperate four years' struggle.\n\nOn the failure of the South, he was consequently left with the most\n\nlimited resources. Confronted with the disheartening task of beginning afresh his\n\nbusiness career, he did so with the courage displayed by the best type of the men of the South, and the years brought their reward.\n\nHe died in New York City, November 6th, 1889, adding another honorable record to the family name, and was buried in Savannah.\n\nSavannah is the native city of Abram Minis, his eyes having first opened to the light of day on May 16, 1859, within the pleasant borders of that city. His parents were Abraham and Lavinia (Florance) Minis. The latter's parents were Jacob L. and Hannah Florance. Mrs. Minis was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, May 26,1826, and her marriage to Mr. Minis was celebrated in Philadelphia, October 22,1851. Their union was blessed by the birth of six children, as follows: Jacob Florance Minis; Rosina Florance Minis, who died in infancy; Miss Maria Minis; Isaac Minis; Lavinia Florance Minis, the wife of Charles I. Henry, of New York City; and Abram Minis.\n\nIsaac Minis, mentioned above, is now deceased, his death having occurred in New York City, June 8, 1893. His wife, to whom he was married in Savannah, March 9, 1886, was before her marriage, Miss Eugenia P. Myers of Savannah. She survives her husband and has two sons, Isaac Minis and Carol E. Minis. Mr. and Mrs. Charles I. Henry have two daughters, namely: Harriet and Lavinia,\n\n556\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\nOne of the subject's uncles, Philip Minis, married Miss Sarah A. Livingston, of New York, and their children are seven in number, and named as follows: Mrs. Alice Henrietta Poe, of Baltimore; Annie Livingston Spalding; Philip Henry; John Livingston; Mary Leila (Mrs. Poultney); and Augusta Medora. One of his aunts, Sarah Ann Minis, married Dr. Isaac Hays of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, whose children were: Joseph Gratz; William DeWees; Harriet Minis; Theodore Minis; Frank Minis; Robert Griffith and Isaac fcnis. Another aunt, Phillippa Minis, married Edward Johnson Etting, of Philadelphia, and their children were: Reuben; Charles Edward; Theodore Minis; Philippa Minis; and Harry Gratz.\n\nThe paternal father of the subject was Isaac Minis, who, although of the Savannah family, was born near Charleston, whence his parents and family fled from the British troops, which at that time were besieg ing the city of Savannah. They returned here after the close of the Revolution. On December 4, 1803, Isaac Minis married Miss Dinah Cohen, of Georgetown, who was born April 12, 1787, and died in Savannah, February 17, 1874. Her husband preceded her to the grave, his death occurring on November 17, 1856, in Philadelphia. He and his wife are buried in the family lot in Laurel Grove cemetery in Savannah. Isaac Minis served in the War of 1812 as a private in Capt. William Bulloch's company of artillery, first regiment of Georgia militia, commanded by General Johnston. Isaac Minis was the son of\n\nPhilip and Judith (Pollock) Minis; Judith Pollock being a member of one of the first families that settled Newport, just as her husband belonged to a family that was numbered among the first settlers of the colony of Georgia, It is a somewhat interesting fact, in this connection, that Rhode Island and Georgia were the only ones of the colonies where Jews were not prohibited from settling.\n\nPhilip Minis, the great-grandfather of the subject of this review, as mentioned in a preceding paragraph, bore the distinction of having been the first male white child born in Georgia, his birth having occurred at Savannah, July 11, 1734, the year following the founding of the Georgia colony by Oglethorpe. In substantiation of this fact there are various authorities, among which is the following notice that appeared in the Georgia Gazette of the issue of Thursday, March 12, 1789, con cerning the family of Philip Minis: \"On Friday, March 6, 1789, departed this life, Mr. Philip Minis, merchant, age fifty-five years. He was the first male white child born in this state. His remains were buried in the Jews' burial ground on Sunday morning, attended by a large number of respectable citizens, who by their solemn attention evinced how sensibly they felt the loss the community has sustained in so valuable a man. He has left a disconsolate widow and five children, together with an aged and venerable mother and five sisters, to deplore their loss. He was an affectionate husband, a dutiful son, a tender father and a kind brother; in short, he was in every sense of the word, a truly honest man.\"\n\nPhilip Minis gave active aid and support, to the colonists in their struggle with Great Britain, and on this account he was named in the Georgia Royal Disqualifying Act of 1780. When in 1779 the French\n\nauxiliaries besieged Savannah, Philip Minis acted as a guide, and was consulted as to the best place for landing. He also volunteered to act as a patriot guide thereafter. In 1780 the British passed their disquali fying act, whereby certain persons were disqualified from holding office, etc., because of their prominence in the \"rebel cause,\" and the name of Philip Minis was one of the one hundred and fifty on the list of dis\n\nqualified men.\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n557\n\nThe founder of the Minis family in Georgia was Philip Minis' father, Abraham Minis, who with his wife, Abigail Minis, and two daughters, Esther and Leah, also his brother, Simeon Minis, arrived in Savannah on a vessel from London, July 11, 1733, the year of Oglethorpe's founding of the colony of Georgia. There were thirteen Jewish families on this vessel; and the history of their organization for the journey in London and their trials and tribulation, as well as their successes, after their landing on Georgia soil in 1733, forms one of the interesting romances of the colonization of the new world. Abraham Minis, first American of the name, died in Savannah in 1757, and was buried in the first Jewish burial plot in the city. His widow, Abigail Minis, in 1760, received a grant of land from King George III. She lived to a great old age, her death occurring in Savannah, in October 11, 1794, aged ninety-three years and two months. The history of Mr. Minis' forbears is as interesting and gratifying as that of any other citizen of the old and historic city. Emerson has said: \"Biography is the only true history.\" When Macaulay was shown the vast clustering vines in Hampton court, with trunk like a tree, he expressed a wish to behold the mother root in Spain from which the scion was cut. Similarly, the average person confesses to an eager desire to trace the ancestral forces that are united in every interesting character, mental and moral capital being treasures invested by forefathers, nature taking the grandsire's ability and putting it out at compound interest for the grandson.\n\nAbram Minis, the present representative of the family, has in addition to his law practice, many other interests of broad scope and importance. He is a director of the following named enterprises: The Propeller Tow Boat Company; the Columbus Manufacturing Company; the Com mercial Life Insurance & Casualty Company; the United Hydraulic Cotton Press Company; the Georgia Land & Securities Company, and the Georgia Cotton Mills. Although he bestows a profound attention on his affairs, business and professional, he is by no means a recluse, for he has many affiliations, and is one of Savannah's most prominent clubmen. He belongs to Landrum Lodge of Masons and of the Oglethorpe Club, the Yacht Club and the Golf Club. He is a member of the Sons of the Revolution and is also an honorary member of the Georgia Hussars, of which he was an active member for several years. He enlisted as a private in the Hussars in 1883, and was promoted through the various ranks to that of first lieutenant; it was while acting in such rank that-he resigned. Following this he was made quartermaster of the First regiment of cavalry, National Guard of Georgia, with the rank of captain, and later was made adjutant with the rank of captain in the same organization. He is now on the retired roll of the Georgia state' troops. In all public affairs in the city, which is dearest to him with the associations and traditions of centuries, Mr. Minis takes a keen and helpful interest and he stands as one of the aggressive and enterprising men who are aiding in the upbuilding of the city.\n\nMr. Minis has been twice married: His first wife was Miss Anna Maria Cohen, of Baltimore, Maryland, their union being solemnized October 8, 1890. She died May 24, 1891, in Savannah. The present Mrs. Minis was, previous to her marriage, Miss Mabel A. Henry, of New. York City, where she married her husband on December 9, 1902. They have two children: Abram Minis, Jr., born November 6, 1933, and H. Philip Minis, born June 11, 1908.\n\nTHOMAS USHER PULASKI CHARLTON, the eldest son of Thomas and Lucy Charlton, was born near Camden, South Carolina, in 1780. His father came from Frederick, Maryland, and was a surgeon and lieutenant\n\n\\\n\n558\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\nunder Col. William Thompson in the Revolutionary forces of South\n\nCarolina: and later served in the legislature of that state. At the death of the father, the widow came to Savannah and settled there in 1790. Thomas Usher was called to the bar of the eastern judicial circuit in\n\n1801, and in that year was elected a member of the Georgia legislature. In 1804 he became attorney-general, and in 1808 judge of the eastern circuit. Later he was elected mayor of Savannah and served in that office for six terms. He was head of the committee of safety in 1812, and performed devoted services during the epidemic of 1820. He again became judge, and died in 1835. He was of strong mentality and high courage, and had the judicial temperament. Many of his decisions appear in a volume of reports published by him. He partially com pleted a life of James Jackson, designed to cover the period of his mili tary services. He was a close friend of that eminent man, who desig nated him as his literary executor. Having enjoyed the friendship of Jackson, he inherited from that great man some of his enemies, who, however, did not begin to give voice to their bitterness until years after Judge Charlton's death. He not only possessed decided literary ability but a high order of wit. He married, in 1803, Emily, daughter of Thomas Walter, of South Carolina, author of ''Flora Caroliniana,\" the first considerable work on southern botany, Of this marriage were born his sons, Thomas Jackson Charlton and Robert Milledge Charlton.\n\nCharlton street was named for him.\n\nROBERT MILLEDGE CHARLTON, younger son of Thomas U. P. and Emily Charlton, was born in Savannah, Georgia, on January 19, 1807, and died there on January 18, 1854. He was called to the bar when very young, and served in the legislature at twenty-one. At twentythree he was appointed district attorney by Andrew Jackson; and at twenty-eight was elected judge of the eastern judicial circuit. He was three times mayor of Savannah, and toward the end of his career became United States senator from Georgia. His practice at the bar was exten sive and successful. Among the early Georgia reports is a volume pub lished by him and containing his own decisions as well as those of the judges who held the bench in the eastern circuit subsequent to the pub lication of the reports of T. U. P. Charlton. He was a man of the finest sensibilities and highest ideals, loving his state and her people. He was at once firm and gentle; helpful and sympathetic. Devoted to the teachings of his own church, in his intercourse with his fellow man he knew no limitations of specific creeds or conditions, and became probably the most beloved citizen Savannah ever had. In 1829 he married Mar garet, daughter of Peter Shick, whose ancestors had departed from Salsburg at the time of the Protestant exodus, settling in the colony of Georgia during the first years of its establishment. Judge Charlton was not only a learned lawyer and an orator, but a writer and poet. In his mind the wit of his father was tempered with a fine sense of humor, the evidences of which appear in his contributions to the Knick erbocker Magazine, the leading periodical of those times, in a series of sketches of life on the circuit. An edition of his poems, to which were added some of the productions of his brother, appeared in 1839, and another edition in 1842. Charlton county, Georgia, was named for him,\n\nand Charlton ward, Savannah.\n\nWALTER GLASCO CHARLTON, youngest son of Robert M. and Margaret\n\nCharlton, was born in Savannah, Georgia, on June 5,1851. He attended school in Savannah, and in Hancock county, Georgia, and Baltimore county, Maryland, under Richard Malcolm Johnston. In 1869 he matric-\n\nSAVANNAH AND SOUTH GEORGIA\n\n559\n\nulated at the University of Virginia, and came to the bar of the east\n\nern circuit on January 22,1873. In that year he became associated with Albert R. Lamar in the office of solicitor-general. In 1877 he was ap pointed reporter of the circuit; and in 1880 was elected solicitor-gen\n\neral. On February 11, 1908, he was appointed judge of the eastern judicial circuit and elected to that office during that year. In 1912, he was again elected. On February 11, 1874, he married Mary Walton, daughter of Richard Malcolm Johnston. He has filled several political positions, among them chairman of the Democratic party in Chatham for several years. His people have been Democrats literally from the day the party was formed. He is the author of several essays on epochs in Georgia history, and has delivered numerous speeches on occasions of historic celebrations. He has occasionally indulged in verse. His ancestors on both sides are identified with the history of Georgia and the United States. The Maryland Charltons held Mason and Dixon's line against Pennsylvania for many years. His great-grandfather Charlton volunteered in the Revolutionary forces in 1775, and his great-grand father, John Shick, who afterward became a prosperous and prominent man, fought at the siege of Savannah, having his right arm shot off by a cannon ball from the British. Judge Charlton is at present president of the Georgia Society of the Cincinnati and of the Georgia Society of the Revolution.\n\nHARRIS MACLEOD KING. Representing on both the paternal and maternal sides of the house families that have long faeen prominent in naval, military, civic and historical affairs of Georgia, Harris Macleod King has himself been actively associated with the development and promotion of the commercial interests of the state for upwards of thirty years, being now supervising inspector of naval stores for the state of Georgia, his home being in Savannah. A son of Col. Barrington S. King, he was born in Roswell, Cobb county, in 1860, a town which was named in honor of his great grandfather, Roswell King.\n\nRoswell King was born in Sharon, Connecticut, May 3, 1765, being a son of Captain Timothy King, who was prominent on the Continental side in the naval service of the Revolutionary war, being commander of the brig \"Defiance.\" Migrating to Georgia after the great struggle of the colonists for independence, Roswell King settled at Darien, in what is now Mclntosh county. He subsequently married Catherine, a daugh ter of Josiah Barrington, who was born in Ireland, and emigrated to Georgia a few years after the arrival in this state of General Oglethorpe, who was his kinsman and friend. Old Fort Barrington on the Altamaha river, an outpost built long before the Revolution for defense against the Spaniards, was named for him.\n\nTheir son, Barrington King, Mr. King's grandfather, was born in Darien, Georgia, March 8th, 1798. About 1839, with a colony of sev eral other families from the seacoast of Georgia, including the Bulloch's, Smith's, Lewis's, Dunwody's, Pratt's, and Goulding's, he immigrated to\n\nCobb county, and located on the site which his father Roswell King had some years before purchased from the Indians, and founded the little village of Roswell, which, as previously stated, was named in honor of his father. His wife, whose maiden name was Catherine M. Nephew, was a daughter of James Nephew, who, during the Revolutionary war, served as lieutenant in Col.
