        "text": "June 18, 2024\n\nAnother 24-25 WAW nominee. I had no idea what this story was about and based off the cover, I thought it was probably a war story. Boy, was I wrong! This story is filled with adventure, daredevils, sibling bond and determination. I really enjoyed this fast read. At first, I couldn’t figure out why this story was a 6-8th grade nominee but I quickly realized when the KKK was spotted.\n\nTopics: orphans, daredevils, traveling circus, KKK, racism, kidnapping\n\nAugust 7, 2022\n\nRichie’s Picks: WE OWN THE SKY by Rodman Philbrick, Scholastic Press, September 2022, 208p., ISBN: 978-1-338-73629-8\n\n“Oh, you wrapped me up in a leather coat\n\nAnd you took me for a ride\n\nWe were drifting with the tail-wind\n\nWhen the runway came in sight\n\nThe clouds came up to gather us\n\nAnd the cockpit turned to white\n\nWhen I looked the sky was empty\n\nI suppose you never saw the landing-lights”\n\n– Al Stewart, “Flying Sorcery” (1976)\n\n“‘Ladies and gentlemen! Kids of all ages! Prepare yourselves! What you are about to see may shock you to the core! You will witness death-defying feats of derring-do! You will see flying machines and race cars and motorcycles whose speed exceeds ONE HUNDRED MILES PER HOUR! You will witness thrilling stunts performed by America’s favorite aviatrix, the first pilot of any gender to fly nonstop between Chicago and New York! The first pilot to fly upside down under the Brooklyn Bridge! Holder of the record for most loop the loops! Ladies and gentlemen, cast your eyes to the east! I give you Ruthie Reynard’s Flying Circus!’\n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, two Curtiss Jenny biplanes zoom up over the edge of the opposite grandstand. They look close enough to reach out and touch. The planes roll and separate and then head straight at me and Jo. Flying machines with great whirring propellers. Propellers that could take off our heads, if the pilots make a mistake.\n\nThey aim for us like winged bullets. Coming so fast we couldn’t get out of the way even if we wanted to, packed into the stands as we are. Ruthie grinning beneath her goggles, pulls up at the last possible instant. The wind from the prop knocks me to my knees. I manage to turn around and see both pilots waving merrily at us from their cockpits. I’ve never been so scared, but the funny thing is, I can’t wait to do it again.”\n\n“It wasn’t so long ago that hundreds of Mainers, sometimes thousands, gathered in public halls in Saco, Portland, Hallowell and Rockland to hear polite lectures on the principles of the KKK and the virtues of pro-Protestant ‘Americanism.’\n\nAcross the state in the 1920s, Christian crosses were burned in Sanford, Lewiston, Gardiner, Dexter and Stockholm, attracting crowds and inspiring fear amid the economic recession, nativism and isolationism that followed World War I. For several turbulent years, membership in the KKK exploded to an estimated high of 8 million in the United States, including northern and western states such as New Jersey, Michigan, Oregon and California.\n\nBy 1923, rapid growth of the KKK in Maine gained national attention, prompting the Boston Herald to publish a six-day front-page series of articles that noted 20,000 Klan robes had been sold here within a year or so. In Portland, prominent residents established a clubhouse on Forest Avenue, where 1,500 Klansmen witnessed the initiation of 400 new members one Saturday in August as about 10,000 curious citizens watched from side streets.\n\nAnd in 1924, when as many as 40,000 Mainers had joined the KKK, the organization was a driving force in electing Republican Gov. Ralph Brewster on a tide of anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic sentiment.”\n\n– Portland Herald, “Not long ago, the KKK was a driving force in Maine culture and politics” (2/5/2017)\n\nIn 1924, Davy and Josephine's immigrant mother dies as the result of prolonged exposure to cotton dust in a Maine textile mill. Their father had previously perished in a mill accident. On the day of their mother’s funeral, the newly-orphaned siblings are unexpectedly rescued by their mother’s childhood best friend, the famous Ruthie Reynard, who is also a distant cousin.\n\nDavy and his big sister Jo have never met Ruthie, but they’ve read the press accounts and know of their mother’s long-ago connection with the pilot. But in her dying days, their mom wrote to Ruthie and requested that she take care of the kids. That’s how Davy and Jo avoid the orphanage and join the Flying Circus.\n\nBoth Davy and Jo’s parents and Ruthie's parents were French Canadians who came to America for a better life. There were few Black Americans in Maine to terrorize and persecute in 1924, so the northern KKK attacked Jews and the French, Italian, and Spanish Catholics. Ruthie and her immigrant co-workers are in their sights.\n\nThe two siblings have great love and caring for each other, and the death-defying performers and their support crew are like one big loving family. That contrasts with the hate shown by the white supremecist farmers, police, and other townspeople who display ugliness and violence.\n\nWE OWN THE SKY juxtaposes the excitement of the air shows with the terror of those KKK attacks, making this a quick, exciting, and fascinating piece of historical fiction for middle graders. The century-ago setting, and the memorable high jinks will make this one a natural for fans of the late Richard Peck’s A LONG WAY FROM CHICAGO series.\n\nRichie Partington, MLIS\n\nRichie's Picks http://richiespicks.pbworks.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/richiespicks/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/richiespicks\n\nrichiepartington@gmail.com\n\nJuly 26, 2022\n\nExcellent historical fiction about the early days of aviation and the presence of the KKK in 1920s Maine from the perspective of a young orphaned boy. Short chapters and lots of action make this perfect for emerging readers.\n\nOctober 13, 2022\n\nFirst sentence: Aside from the priest and the gravediggers, me and my sister, Jo, are the only ones to witness our dear mother, Eva Morin Michaud, being lowered into her grave. Papa having perished in a mill accident some years previously, the hard, hard loss of our mama makes us orphans. When I begin to cuss the lung ailment that so cruelly took her from us, Jo hushes me. \"Wait until the priest is out of earshot,\" she says, hugging me tight. \"Then I shall join you and we'll cuss like pirates. We'll turn the air blue, Davy, I promise.\" I won't put down what we said, exactly, for fear it'll set this page on fire.\n\nPremise/plot: Jo and Davy (Davy is our narrator) are taken in by their Aunt Ruth, an aviatrix, after their mother's death. Their aunt is part of a flying circus, a daredevil touring group. Both will be working at the circus. (Davy, for example, sells bags of popcorn before finding an act (on the ground) to make his own.) The historical setting for this one is 1924 Maine. The KKK has recently increased its presence there and has become quite popular. They are targeting immigrants. (Think French-Canadian, Irish, Polish, Italian, Jews, etc.) Readers get a behind the scenes look at early aviation, traveling circuses, and the harsh realities of the hateful KKK.\n\nMy thoughts: What a read! I've read a few books with a circus setting, but, never a book featuring daredevil plane stunts. (Jo even trains to DANCE the Charleston on the wings of a plane. You might have heard of wing-walkers, but I'd never heard of anyone dancing.) Life on the road is always interesting. I thought the characterization was solid. I enjoyed getting to know all the characters; it reads almost as a found-family. The book is intense in places, but, everything is well-balanced.\n\nMarch 28, 2023\n\nI was a Little surprised by this book. I saw it on the library shelf and though it would be a fun, light read. Little did I realize it was based in the 1920s with the dust bowl and KKK.\n\nI loved the story though. Siblings, determination, belief in good, true friendships and striving for dreams. And I really like the meaning of hope despite hardships in the title as it is used in the book.\n\nThere was a lot of racism and hate, so I’d be careful letting younger kids read it.\n\nNovember 2, 2022\n\nAn interesting look at daredevil stunts in the circus during the 1920s and the hostilities from the Klu Klux Klan. This is part biography. It took me awhile to get into the book.\n\nDecember 16, 2022\n\nI really love the idea behind this story, it just felt rushed. I wish it was 100 pages longer. I still enjoyed it though and I love the cover.\n\nJuly 2, 2024\n\nWAW 24-25 Grade 6-8 book. Would probably give this a 3.5. I really enjoyed the book but the ending seemed rushed and had a lot packed in right at the end.\n\nDavy and his older sister Jo are now orphans after the passing of their mother, but their relative Rosie takes them under her wing, literally and figuratively, bringing them along on her traveling stunt pilot circus show. Both kids work at the show in little ways and then finding more of a prominent role as time goes on. While all is good and well with the air show, the KKK is starting to make a rise in Maine causing disruption to their shows and causing fear for Davy and Jo. Can they escape the terror the KKK is causing? Can they move forward in continuing to deliver a top notch aerial stunt show? This would be a good book for kids interested in history, has a passion for transportation/planes.\n\nCW: death of a parent, KKK, hate speech\n\nOctober 1, 2022\n\nBefore their mother died, she asks a distant relation, Ruthie, a famous aviator, to help her children, Davy who is 12 and his sister, Jo, who is 17. The story is set in 1924 Maine. Ruthie owns a flying circus and both children are thrilled to become part of her community. Unfortunately the flying circus encounters a very active and hostile Ku Klux Klan. Ruthie is a particularly inspiring character since she deals with sexism and racism with grace and courage. \"The ground may belong to those who hate, but we own the sky!\" Don't miss the author's notes since Philbrick tells how events in the book mirror events in his family's history. A suspenseful and inspiring story that will keep young readers fully engaged.\n\nRead\n\nOctober 3, 2022\n\nI would recommend this book if you like daredevils or fighting a violent organization. I liked that this book was unique because not many books were on the subject of a flying circus. I also liked how fighting for justice was included in this book, and it's incorporated in a fun way. The end of the book was a little sad and disappointing, but it's a good book.\n\nOctober 10, 2022\n\nWhoa! I was this many years old (67) when I read this book and learned that 150,000 Maine KKK members were very active in the state in the 1920s--not fighting against Blacks since Maine was then and still is a very white state. They were terrorizing and trying to banish immigrants like the French Canadians, Italians, Poles, Jews, and more since they considered them \"lower races\" who took their jobs and threatened their racial superiority.\n\nRodman Philbrick has written an entertaining, fast-paced, and important novel based on his own family's history including Ruth Law, a female daredevil aviator and founder of a flying circus which toured the country, plus a cross-burning in his own grandfather's yard by the KKK when he brought home an Irish Catholic bride.\n\nOrphan Davy Michaud and his older sister Jo are characters you can't help but root for as they join their aunt and become part of the flying circus while trying to stay safe and fight back against the KKK's attacks. Scenes set at the Waterville airport and the Skowhegan Fair (plus Biddeford and Portland) make this book ring true and feel personal (being connected to these towns and places as I was growing up).\n\nThis book will captivate middle graders, but is for all ages who want a better understanding of Maine's and the United States' history.\n\nAfter reading WE OWN THE SKY, I searched for info on Rodman Philbrick's other books. I've already read and enjoyed several of them, but I discovered more that are also set in Maine--so my \"gotta read\" pile just grew as I need to read Philbrick's backlist. He's one talented storyteller!\n\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\nAt the graveside service for their mother, Davy and Jo learn that they have a relative that will offer them an amazing adventure. An adventure that is better than being orphans working at a cotton mill in 1924.\n\nWhile they are working for the Ruthie Reynard's Flying Circus, they will have a place to live... meals... and a paying job. Davy will begin as a popcorn maker and Jo will begin as the ticket/cashier for the air show. With the sense of adventure their lives will take a path that neither of them are prepared for.\n\nThey will meet professional aviators, death-defying feats stunts, motorized races with speeds exceeding 100mph, and the unfortunate bigotry and hatred of the KKK.\n\nHave you heard about the wing walkers? Have you ever wondered what it would be like to a daring bi-plane walker? Don't miss this historical novel about what life as a wing walker might have been! The characters are uniquely defined. The historical accuracy of the settings and the trials of life is crafted with a mixture of wonder, spunk, and an ability to be intellectually flexible!\n\nHistorical fiction isn't always a \"review-mirrored\" glance of perfection, it can be a \"snapshot\" into the life of those who lived before us. Yet, it is an opportunity to learn about that which needed to change. To learn what courage, determination, and \"grit\" looks like. To live outside the box and to create a better life out of hardships. An inspiring novel for a read-aloud in grades 3-6 (so many discussion points + research opportunities = a literary must).\n\nMrsK https://mrskbookstogo.blogspot.com/\n\nJanuary 18, 2023\n\nWhen I think about the KKK, I usually think of the southern and southwestern parts of America. But Philbrick's book takes place in Maine in the 1920s. When a huge proportion of the white population pledged their support of the hate-filled organization. Enough that they were able to elect a governor with ties to the organization. The main focus was white superiority and it was directed at anyone that was an immigrant and/or Catholic. It was despicable and terrifying. Men dressed in white robes on horses riding into Catholic churches during mass. Burning synagogues and churches. Something I had no idea had happened.\n\nThe story revolves around twelve-year old Davy and his seventeen-year old sister, Josephine. Their mother has died from a lung disease which came from working in the mills. Davy and his sister were both born in America but their parents were French Canadian. Their father had died several years ago - so now they are orphans. An old friend of their mothers swoops in when she hears what has happened and takes them both to work in her Flying Circus - she is a famous female pilot and puts on a show filled with amazing airplane and race car stunts. Since they don't fit the Anglo-Saxon ideal of the KKK, the show soon becomes a target of the Klan.\n\nThe book has short chapters and is a quick read. As a bit of a warning -- it also includes snippets the hate-filled speeches that the KKK is famous for - not an easy thing to hear. The author includes brief notes at the end describing his inspiration for the book and his research.\n\nNovember 13, 2022\n\nIt is the 1920's and orphaned teens Davy and Jo are taken in by their mother's long-estranged cousin, Ruthie. Their lives are transformed as they are taken from the depths of working-class poverty and lifted up to a middle-class life with a dash of excitement. Ruthie is a barnstorming aviatrix and owner of a flying circus. The two siblings are mesmerized by the death-defying tricks they see and are delighted to be involved in the show. When in a small town while on tour in Maine, they encounter the KKK, dressed in all their finery and learn first-hand about the hate-group whose targets included Black people, Jews, French, Spanish, Polish, and Catholics (like themselves). When KKK members infiltrate the flying circus, trouble follows.\n\nPhilbrick does what he does best: builds a story quilt of historical events and makes it appeal to young people. High on action and light on description, this is a quick read, shining a light on several timely trends that remain relevant today: heroes and orphans, aviation, fast cars, immigrants, and villains (in this case, hate groups). Short chapters and snappy text keep this one moving quickly. He sprinkles French and Italian phrases in the dialogue for authenticity, always translating it to keep the reader enlightened. Never a dull moment!\n\nThis would be an excellent choice for high/low readers. Recommended for grades 4-8\n\nJanuary 14, 2023\n\n1924, Maine. 12yo Davy and his 17yo sister Jo have recently been orphaned. Before she died, their mother reached out to a distant cousin, asking that she find a place for the children. Ruthie, an aviatrix, picks up the kids, but it's right at the beginning of the Flying Circus season, so she puts them to work with her show. Davy sells popcorn and Jo sells tickets. The performers are immigrants - French Canadian, Italian, Irish, etc. and soon the KKK in Maine takes notice and tried to shut them down.\n\nExciting stunts, dangerous situations, and relatable characters make We Own the Sky a gripping read. I love the cover picture - necessary because Bi-Plane and Wing Walker are both unfamiliar, but would have liked it better if the Klan had been in robes - they just look like cowboys. We really need a resurgence of interest in historical fiction, because I think kids are going to love this!\n\nCross posted to http://kissthebook.blogspot.com\n\nSeptember 8, 2022\n\nI love an action / thriller aimed at kids and engaging for adults.\n\nRodman Philbrick has mastered the thriller for tweens and teens making history and adventure come alive. His latest adventure thriller revolves around an air circus and the KKK in Maine, that’s right, in the northernmost, staid New England state in the mid-1920s.\n\nDavy and Jo, orphaned as kids are taken to Maine by their cousin Ruthie Reynard, a famous flying ace. Ruthie introduces the youngsters to the magic of the circus, the thrills of high-flying planes, and the camaraderie of a well-oiled operation, all while giving them jobs and responsibilities.\n\nThe terror of the KKK attacks on the flying circus just add to the thrills.\n\nThanks to the BookLoft of German Village (Columbus, OH) http://www.bookloft.com for an ARC to read and review.\n\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nDavy and Jo have just lost their mother to illness. During the summer, they are taken in by their aunt Ruthie in her flying circus. They learn a lot about how to be brave in their new jobs and by facing the anti-immigrant tirades of the KKK.\n\nThis is a great story that illuminates a different part of the Klan's influence in the early 20th century. The characters are loveable. However, I worry that some of the depictions of the other members of the flying circus are close to stereotypes (I am not a member of these identities, so I cannot speak for them).\n\nThis reads for 4th-6th graders rather than a \"middle grade\" level in my opinion. However, Philbrick handles the topics with clarity and without providing any justification of the \"it was just the times\" whatsoever.\n\nNovember 28, 2022\n\nAfter the death of their mother, orphans Davy and Jo are worried they will be sent to work in the mill. Just after the funeral, their mother’s cousin the Aviatrix Ruthie Reynard swoops in and takes them under her wing. They join her traveling flying circus, eventually joining the act themselves. Meanwhile the Ku Klux Klan has arrived in Maine. The KKK targets immigrants, especially the French-Canadians and Catholics. The traveling air circus – comprised of many immigrants – soon becomes a target. Based on true events.\n\nJuly 12, 2024\n\nWow! This was a very intense book! The ending is very sad, and the subject matter is pretty upsetting! I definitely think this is for an older/upper elementary book. It talks a lot about the KKK and the hate and violence that they spread throughout this immigrant town. I loved the aviation talk in this book, which I was actually dreading, and I think a lot of kids will enjoy it also. The found family aspect that was shown through the circus was great as well! Overall a very well told book about difficult subject matter. Definitely look into trigger warnings before your recommend this book.\n\nApril 12, 2023\n\nTough subject tackled in this young adult literature. Interesting characters, Maine based setting, historical references that introduce the klan to young audiences. The plot is fast moving and riveting. A flying circus, orphaned young sibling main characters, and a cast of diverse characters from a talented Italian cook to a French daredevil add to the interest and intrigue of the narrative. Rodman Philbrook did it again, another winner.\n\nNovember 10, 2023\n\nPicked this up in my elementary school library. Well written historical fiction based in Maine in the 1920’s with the rising influence of the KKK. When a flying circus comes to town made up of immigrants of various countries, the KKK becomes involved and tries to run them out. Baffling that the KKK ever existed at all or had any followers…but, sadly they did. Loved the story of two sibling orphans who are taken in by their famous cousin who is a daredevil in her very own flying circus.\n\nJune 3, 2024\n\nIf I hadn’t enjoyed the Flying Circus (by far the best parts of the book) and a couple of the characters as much as I did, I’d have given this a three-star. It could’ve used an additional 100 pages toward the end, and the shock-value ending felt rushed, not well-thought-out, and left much to be desired. But it’s a timely historical fiction for young readers about standing up to hate groups in your community, and overall a good read.\n\nNovember 19, 2022\n\nFor such a small book, this took me awhile to get through. I learned a lot - I had no idea about the KKK in the early 1900’s against the French Canadiens in New England and Maine. The best parts of the book are the flying shows. This reads on the younger side - I bought it for my 6th graders but think it’s more suitable for 3rd-5th.\n\nRead\n\nJanuary 30, 2023\n\nThis was a cute little book. I was really interested in learning about this part of history. I didn't know that the Ku Klux Klan had a membership surge in 1924 in Maine, of all places, and because there were few Blacks there, their main target was immigrants. I don't see my middle grade students getting excited about it, but I enjoyed reading it. It was a fast read.\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\nWith the description of every exciting flying circus adventure, you can feel the thrill. The KKKs rising against immigrants was a very real event in New England. Part of their story that most people don’t realize. Ruthie and her circus family live for adventure but also live to love each other and spread joy. A touching, yet exciting, read.\n\nFebruary 11, 2023\n\nA history I am so sad to now know. Short chapters that end with a cliffhanger just helps to build the tension and anticipation. Taking place in the 1920s Biddeford, Lewiston and Portland, Maine, readers will glimpse how far we have come in 100 years … and sadly how so much looks the same in our society’s view of immigration and race.\n\nGrades 6 and up.\n\nMarch 10, 2023\n\nA good book for middle-schoolers on the hatred spawning from the KKK during the 20s in Maine. A story on resilience, what it means to be family, and determination to see truth spread rather than hate.\n\nThe plot was predictable, yet satisfying; and the writing left much to be desired… but would be nice for young readers. Definitely pleased to have this in my YA library at school.\n\nSeptember 18, 2022\n\nenjoyed this lots--set in the 1920s, two orphans are taken in by a relative they've never met before, a young woman who runs an aviation stunt show. The KKK attacks them (because they are French Canadian, with Italian crew as well), but they persist."
