        "text": "Here is a link to an article about my current (Jan 2024) show at Curtis Memorial Library. I feel so fortunate to have the women inhabiting the space.\n\nArtist’s Statement:\n\nEach of these women was inspired by a detail. The look in someone’s eye, a certain curtain of hair, maybe a nose.\n\nMost of these women are utter fiction. Some are based on real people (maybe you?). Sometimes, they are from memory. If I see a photo that inspires me, I look at it for a while, then do the drawing without looking at it. When I paint them (so quickly, in India Ink) the women come alive for me. I feel I know them;\n\nI say “Aha, it’s YOU!”\n\nWhen I was a child, I used to think that we were all the same person. I was the ME version, and you the YOU. This project brings me back to that feeling.\n\nI hope these women will inspire you to ask them questions.\n\nWhich one has a secret? Which one is your fourth cousin? Who is angry? Who is tired? Who is full of joy? Talk to them. They may answer.\n\nIf you are so moved, please tell me what they told you, in the Guest Book. You can identify the women by section, or keep them anonymous (or give them a name!). There are no wrong answers. Just conversation.\n\nI’m not sure why I did a project based on humans who identify as women. I am so glad that we now recognize that humans may identify in so many ways, along a spectrum as beautiful as the one we might dream up for flowers, for example, or stars.\n\nHere’s to all our communality and to what makes each of us unique.\n\nCharlotte Agell January 2024\n\nI had the great good fortune to be invited to speak to 66 new Americans, at the INS ceremony hosted by Yarmouth High School’s Civil Rights Team. Why I was asked was an alphabetical coincidence of minor importance (listen and find out). It was such a great feeling to welcome these new Americans from so many countries, AND to have my mother in the audience. We missed each other’s ceremonies.\n\nMy friend Arnie filmed this (surprising me!). Here it is: https://youtu.be/n3cWK5mKm6U\n\nThe end cuts off.\n\nHere’s what I said in the last moments: But something I didn’t realize until I read a book recently, is that the Statue of Liberty is not standing there, like some kind of statue.\n\nHer right foot is in motion, the heel is raised up.\n\nShe is walking. Her foot is in mid-stride.\n\nThe author of the book I read, Dave Eggars, makes the point that she is walking because she still has work to do.\n\nTo quote him:\n\nIf the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of freedom, if the Statue of Liberty has welcomed millions of immigrants to the United States, how then how can she stand still? Liberty and freedom from oppression are not things you get or grant by standing around.\n\nThey require action. Courage. An unwillingness to rest.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty, like many of us in this room today, is also an immigrant. She did, after all, come from France. She welcomes us all to this nation. She is not at rest.\n\nThe United States of America’s story is about all of us. It’s one we are still writing.\n\nAnd that’s what makes us so strong. Let’s listen to each others’ stories.\n\nThis is a conversation called The United States of America.Welcome. We are so glad you are here.\n\nSuch a bad blogger am I. Hello to my two visitors? Anyway, I wanted to upload this sweet photo. It’s of HAPPY ME, receiving my actual Lupine Honor Award PLATE in amazing company, a year late and in the rain, but with such happiness. Thank you, Maine LIBRARIANS.\n\nI was in amazing company! Listed Below\n\n2019: The Katahdin Award, a lifetime achievement award, was given to Kevin Hawkes, author and/or illustrator of such books as Velma Gratch & the Way Cool Butterfly, Library Lion, and The Wicked Big Toddlah.\n\nThe Lupine Award, honored the works of several creators who were either residents of Maine or whose work focused on Maine. The 2019 picture book winner was Going Down Home with Daddy by Kelly Starling Lyons and illustrated by Daniel Minter. The picture book honor was Maybe Tomorrow? by Charlotte Agell and illustrated by Ana Ramirez Gonzalez. The 2019 juvenile/young adult winner was Searching for Lottie by Susan Ross. The honor book was American Trailblazers: 50 Remarkable People who Shaped U.S. History by Lisa Trusiani and illustrated by Pau Morgan, Toby Newsome, and Cecilia Puglesi.\n\n2020:\n\nKatahdin Award: Rodman Philbrick\n\nLupine Award: Magnificent Homespun Brown by Samara Cole Doyon, illus by Kaylana Juanita\n\nLupine Honor: Chowder Rules by Anna Crowley Redding and Vita Lane\n\nYA Award: Abdi Nor Iften for Call Me American\n\nYA Honor: Echo Mountain by Lauren Wolk\n\nphoto below by Aurora Hooper\n\nWhat feeds the imagination? Sometimes….NOTHING. Here’s a Letter to the Editor I wrote, printed (wheee!) in the Sunday edition of the NYTimes this past spring. It was in response to an article by Pamela Paul:\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe “Let Children Get Bored Again” (Sunday Review, Feb. 3):\n\nThank you to Pamela Paul for her piece on the importance of boredom. One of the few constants on my middle-school classroom bulletin board over the years has been Maira Kalman’s New Yorker cover featuring the Institute for Advanced Study of Daydreaming. The sage advice of Lorraine Hansberry has remained above my whiteboard for almost two decades now: “Never be afraid to sit awhile and think.”\n\nLife rushes us too much, yet so much of value is born of the interstitial pause. It’s become almost sacred to me. There’s a reason I stave off a smartphone. I fear it would assert itself, like a tour director, over the flights of fancy born of the nonspecifically occupied mind. If you sit with your own thoughts for a while, you never know where you may end up. And that’s a good thing, for all of us."
