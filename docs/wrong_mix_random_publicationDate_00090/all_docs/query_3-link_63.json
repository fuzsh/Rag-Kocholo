        "text": "2023 – 24 Competition Books\n\nBook Blitz is a book competition that students in all Canyons middle schools engage in. It follows a similar format to the national Battle of the Books. Each middle school creates teams of students who share in the reading of the selected 20 titles. In the spring, the various teams battle to determine which two teams will represent their middle school in the district Book Blitz battle usually held at the Canyons District building. The winning team receives fun prizes, a trophy, and the bragging rights to being the district team winner of Book Blitz.\n\nIf a movie about super teachers were ever made, Lucie Chamberlain would be a prime candidate for a leading role. Fortunately for her kindergarten students at Alta View Elementary, she already thrives in a supporting role for them. Parents thank her for being a “super teacher.” She is also described as an “amazing colleague.” Whether students need help in the classroom or from home while sick, Lucie goes above and beyond to help them learn, overcome fears, and feel important and cared for. Lucie is the reason a number of kids went from hating school to loving it, according to parents. The way she exudes patience, sweetness, positive energy, and love for her students with special needs melts is appreciated and admired. One parent noted: “Both my kids wish she could be their teacher forever.” Another added: “She treats every student like their learning and their feelings are her priority.” Super teacher, indeed!\n\nCanyons School District is committed to making this website compliant with the ADA.
