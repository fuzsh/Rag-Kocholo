Love to know your experiences about paid influencer marketing especially for those influencers under 200k followers. Ty https://lnkd.in/eg5UZ8PX\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mistake politeness for lack of strength.‚Äù ‚Äî Sonia Sotomayor A little motivation and gentle reminder as we head off to a new week.\n\nSometimes a brand gets it. The L‚ÄôOreal ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Worth It/I‚Äôm Worth It‚Äù campaign is feel good inspiration. https://lnkd.in/edV78HBY Backstory: https://lnkd.in/esUFxcNW Remember - You ARE Worth It üíõ\n\nTraditional Art Or An IPad?

Thoughts? https://lnkd.in/eY-pYgRJ #applead #ipod #technology #marketing\n\nWill you be playing LinkedIn Games? ‚ÄúGames have officially arrived on LinkedIn. Taking a page from the New York Times‚Äô playbook, LinkedIn users can now play three games ‚Äì Pinpoint (a category guessing game), Crossclimb (a trivia game) and Queens (a riff on Sudoku) ‚Äì then discuss them on the platform. It‚Äôs an interesting attempt to get people coming back to the site and could signal a move beyond purely business content on the app.‚Äù - from PR Daily"
