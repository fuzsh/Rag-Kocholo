        "text": "February 21, 2021\n\nWas looking for paranormal romantic suspense with werewolves. This story is a coming-of-age werewolf in a world where werewolves are evil monsters trying to take over the world. So it wasn’t what I was looking for, but it was an enjoyable trilogy that was short enough to have been one book.\n\nGruff, born human and abandoned in the swamp, was raised by a wolf pack. He is accepted as part of the pack even though he is not as fast or skilled at hunting as his pack-mates.\n\nAt 12, Gruff changes for the first time to a werewolf with full moon and meets vicious killer werewolves who try to steal a human child from a nearby town and blame it on wolves. Gruff stops them. When the humans come to kill the wolf pack, Gruff diverts them and is taken to town to live with humans until they find his parents. He is treated well and accepted by the family, who teach him to speak English and try to socialize him.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJune 13, 2017\n\nMy love of reading started when i was young, and it gives me immense pleasure to provide books to Spread the Word Nevada, an organization that passes them on to children in the community. They are a terrific organization supporting an important cause. If your local I encourage you to check them out. For those living further a field, look in your own community, their may already be a similar program in place. And if not, you can always help start one.\n\nhttp://spreadthewordnevada.org/\n\nMyself, I go out on the weekends and\n\nshop thrift store and bulk book lots to rescue books and donate them. Sometimes I'll find a book I remember reading when I was young and will read it again before passing it on.\n\nI don't rate these books using my normal scale, instead I give most of them three stars. This isn't a Criticism of the book, simply my way of rating them as good for children.\n\nApril 12, 2020\n\nThis rating was, for me, definitely heavy on the nostalgia. You know how you have those books from childhood that are just vague memories, and you don't remember any concrete facts about it, and you think you might remember what the color of the cover was but you could be wrong?\n\nFor me, that was this book. I read this around 10 or 11 years old and I was captivated. It was dark. It was scary. It featured a kid with a terrible curse! Who would ever accept him?!\n\nReading it again some, god, what, seventeen years later? It doesn't hit quite the same, of course, but I'm enjoying it. I see a lot of themes that have recurred in my own writing, like this book had wriggled into my subconscious and stayed there. I'm really happy to have found it again after all these years.\n\nNovember 26, 2023\n\nWhoooo boy....this was a horrible read. The plot was okay for being a children's book, but the writing was pure torture, it was beyond simple. This book is so silly that might do for a five year old, but not a teenager or above. I recommend something like \"Animorphs\" instead.\n\nSeptember 13, 2010\n\nThis one is more of an introduction to the character Gruff. Who after living with a wolf family for 12 years learns he is a werewolf. Unfortunately the other werewolves want him to be an evil werewolf and his wolf family is scared of him (when he changes). If that wasn't problem enough, the humans think his wolf family is stealing their kids.\n\nIt won't be till the second book one knows the real plans of the werewolves.\n\nMay 27, 2016\n\nI finished reading this book in an hour and a half. Only 100 pages and very simplistically written, as if written for a 10 year old. VERY simplistic and young-YOUNG adult.\n\nA boy is raised by wolves and as he nears puberty, discovers he's a werewolf who must protect his wolf family--and the humans of the town nearby--from the evil werewolves who want to hunt his family and make him one of them.\n\nOctober 25, 2008\n\nI remember reading these books a long, long time ago. I think it may very well have been the first werewolf-centric series I read. I don't think I remember enough about the series to judge each book individually, but I remember rereading the first one.\n\nAugust 11, 2015\n\nre-reading this trilogy after so long and I'm absolutely enjoying it. the first book was a great introduction to the main character and setting up the story. the ending left off on a cliffhanger and I'm so excited for the next book. it reminds me of my childhood days\n\nMarch 3, 2011\n\nI loved this book. it's a little overdramatic but i think it was fantastic.\n\nRead\n\nJuly 3, 2014\n\nJust awesome I loved the imagery that the put book to life."
