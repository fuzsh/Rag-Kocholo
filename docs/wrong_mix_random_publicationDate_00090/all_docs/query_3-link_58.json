        "text": "​​​​By: Dipesh Navsaria, MPH, MSLIS, MD, FAAP\n\n​In today's world, children and teens are bombarded with conflicting, ever-shifting standards of ethics and morality. At the same time, you are trying to teach and instill good values at home. Fortunately, a really great book has the power to counterbalance these outside influences and teach children important lessons as they grow.\n\nIt might be a book on kindness after your child experienced or witnessed cruelty. It might be a book on expressing emotions after your child s​aw or heard scary news coverage, or maybe a book on understanding differences after your child saw someone who looked differently than they do.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Reach Out and Read have compiled the following list of books—organized by age and topic—to help you raise children who are aware of the world around them, curious, brave, kind, and thoughtful. Parents and caregivers are encouraged to review these titles in advance of sharing them with their children.\n\nThen read together! Books are great conversation starters that can give you an opportunity to talk to your children about these issues and help them learn and understand your family's values.\n\nBooks to teach kindness\n\nTeaching kindness to children is an important skill to build and reinforce at all ages. Young children can learn how small acts of kindness help and please others, but teens can learn broader, larger concepts grounded in morals and ethics.\n\nPreschoolers & early grades\n\nStand​ in My Shoes: Kids Learning About Empathy, by Bob Sornson; illustrated by Shelley Johannes\n\nThose Shoes, by Maribeth Boelts, illustrated by Noah Z. Jones\n\nKindness is Cooler, Mrs Ruler, by Margery Cuyler, illustrated by Sachiko Yoshikawa\n\nWhat Does It Mean To Be Kind?, by Rana DiOrio, illustrated by Stéphane Jorisch\n\nOrdinary Mary's Extraordinary Deed, by Emily Pearson, illustrated by Fumi Kosaka\n\nEach Kindness, by Jacqueline Woodson, illustrated by E.B.

Younger children may have difficulty naming their emotions, but find it easier to identify with a character in a book. Older children may have difficulty sorting through complex feelings and worry about burdening adults who are struggling themselves. Books can help children process, clarify, and put a name to their feelings.\n\nPreschoolers & early grades\n\nMoody Cow Meditates, by Kerry Lee MacLean\n\nThat's How I Feel (Asi Me Siento), by Rourke Publishing\n\nHave you Filled a Bucket Today?, by Carol McCloud, illustrated by David Messing\n\nWhat if Everybody Did That?, by Ellen Javernick, illustrated by Colleen M.

It's common for younger children to repeat language they've heard without understanding the implications of what they're saying. Those who are harassed (or are worried about being harassed) may have strong fear and anxiety. Children who are bystanders may not know how to respond, particularly if they fear being bullied themselves.\n\nPreschoolers & early grades\n\nChrysanthemum, by Kevin Henkes\n\nThe Hundred Dresses, by Eleanor Estes, Illustrated by Louis Slobodkin\n\nEdwardo: the Horriblest Boy in the Whole Wide World, by John Burningham\n\nSay Something, by Peggy Moss, Illustrated by Lea Lyon\n\nBabymouse: Queen of the World, by Jennifer Holm and Matthew Holm\n\nBully B.E.A.N.S., by Julia Cook, Illustrated by Anita DuFalla\n\nConfessions of a Former Bully, by Trudy Ludwig, Illustrated by Beth Adams\n\nMiddle grades\n\nStitches, by Glen Huser\n\nTo This Day: For the Bullied and the Beautiful, by Shane Koyczan\n\nUnderstanding Buddy, by Marc Kornblatt\n\nLoser, by Jerry Spinelli\n\nVeronica Ganz, by Marilyn Sachs\n\nBlubber, by Judy Blume\n\nTeens\n\nDear Bully: Seventy Authors Tell Their Stories, by Megan Kelley Hall and Carrie Jones\n\nSpeak, by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\nFreak Show, by James St James\n\nStargirl, by Jerry Spinelli\n\n7 Days at the Hot Corner, by Terry Trueman\n\nBooks on listening to others' views\n\nLearning how to listen well and respect different views are important life skills. While younger children find it difficult to take the perspective of others, they gain that ability over time. Older children may become great debaters—especially with their parents. Books can offer models for engaging with others who have different views in a respectful and productive manner.\n\nPreschoolers & early grades\n\nWhen Sophie's Feelings Are Really, Really Hurt, by Molly Bang\n\nI'm the Best, by Lucy Cousins\n\nChocolate Milk, Por Favor, by Maria Dismondy, illustrated by Donna Farrell\n\nThe Sandwich Swap, by Queen Rania of Jordan & Kelly DiPucchio, illustrated by Tricia Tusa\n\nJunkyard Wonders, by Patricia Polacco\n\nThe Conquerers, by David McKee\n\nMiddle Grades\n\nZero Tolerance, by Claudia Mills\n\nThe Cat at the Wall, by Deborah Ellis\n\nThe Three Questions, by Jon Muth\n\nAdolescents\n\nThis Side of Home, by Renee Watson\n\nBooks about respecting differences\n\nChildren are naturally curious about others (particularly other children) who fall into groups other than their own. Think of your child's curiosity as an opportunity to teach him or her about respecting these differences. Remember, in order to raise kids to embrace diversity, you'll need to give them access to a variety of different cultures and traditions—books are a great way to do that!\n\nPreschoolers & early grades\n\nI Like Myself!, by Karen Beaumont, Illustrated by David Catrow\n\nRed: A Crayon's Story, by Michael Hall\n\nGiraffes Can't Dance, by Giles Andreae, Illustrated by Guy Parker-Rees\n\nStrictly No Elephants, by Lisa Mantchev, Illustrated by Taeeun Yoo\n\nTwo Speckled Eggs, by Jennifer K.

Kaye\n\nBooks on social change & civic engagement\n\nMany children are drawn to helping others—even at young ages. Maybe it is raising money for a cause or having a passion for issue impacting their community. Books can help them understand the broader concepts of social justice and civic engagement. Younger children tend to thinking of things as \"good vs. bad,\" but as they get older they develop very sophisticated and nuanced moral reasoning.\n\nPreschoolers & early grades\n\nGrace for President, by Kelly DiPucchio, Illustrated by LeUyen Pham\n\nA Chair for My Mother, by Vera B.
