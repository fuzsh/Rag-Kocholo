        "text": "What is the Sion Difference?\n\nSion students are intrinsically motivated and independent, lifelong scholars. Sion’s 21st century learning curriculum and personalized instruction approach focus on knowledge and future-ready ensuring that students acquire the habits of mind and skill sets necessary for the college-preparatory curriculum of high school and beyond. Likewise, the Sion community, comprised of faculty, students, and parents, has a deep commitment to justice and service. We value empathy, compassion, and respect, which arise from an innate sense of caring for the world and a sense of responsibility to mankind. Sion students are instinctively guided to act with integrity and honesty, serve others, as well as take responsibility for their actions and consequences. As such, Sion students are agents of change who strive to be their best selves and use their unique gifts and talents to serve others and make a positive difference in their lives and the lives of those around them.\n\nPlease enjoy some of the amazing teaching and learning moments that characterized the Sion Difference during the 3rd quarter. Thank you for your continued support, and have a wonderful spring break!\n\nAcademics\n\nIt's always a beautiful day for teaching and learning at Sion!\n\nSocial Studies\n\n​Grade 6 has been learning about the geography and history of Ancient Egypt and Kush, grade 7 has been delving into the geography and history of Early African civilizations, and the Empires of Asia-China, while grade 8 students have been acquiring American History knowledge and research skills as they study Reconstruction and the expansion to the West. Also, congratulations to 8th grade student, Oscar S., and Mr. Ray for qualifying to compete in the state level of the National Geographic Bee! The Missouri State Bee will take place on Friday, March 31 at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Vive Sion!\n\n​\n\nMathematics\n\nOur 7th and 8th Grade students participated in the Missouri Math League competition on Tuesday, February 28. The goal is to provide students with educationally enriching opportunities to participate in academically-oriented activities and to gain recognition for their mathematical achievement in an encouraging way. Also, our students led by Mr. Weems and Mrs. Welsh celebrated Pi Day on March 8 with engaging activities like using patterns to represent pi by making a bracelet, a paper chain, or a bar graph. In addition, they had the opportunity to play a game involving adding decimals (including pi), they could complete a word scramble or Pi Day sudoku, or a Pi Day coloring page. Of course, proving pi exists was part of the day (and having some pie) as well!\n\nScience Olympiad\n\nOur Science Olympiad team led by Mr. Flournoy and Mr. Eikermann competed at Penn Valley Community College in the Region 3 qualifying tournament on Saturday March 4, 2017. The team competed in all 23 events and finished 5th out of 18 teams. They missed qualifying for the state tournament by only a few points. Team members who medalled in the following events were: Crime Busters (Briana S./ Ruth H.), Fast Facts (Avery B./ Oscar S.), Microbe Mission (Nate S. / Travis K.), Optics ( Travis K. / Luke H), Rocks and Minerals (Lukas G. / Oscar S) and Wright Stuff ( Max S. / Nate S.). We are so proud of this team for their seven month journey of hard work and collaboration.\n\nLanguage Arts\n\nGrade 6 has been working on a thematic unit (helping each other, bravery, human decency) using the novel Number the Stars by Lois Lowry. Likewise, they have been exploring real and fictional characters who accomplished their goals, as well as those who were heroes for doing the right thing. The main skills acquired this quarter have been summarizing, paragraph editing, comparing and contrasting, plot events, among others. Grade 7 has been working on a thematic unit (friendship, differences, loyalty, dealing with Bullies, death of a friend), using the novel Freak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick, while 8th grade is working on a thematic unit on racial inequalities, Jim Crow Laws, family struggles and loyalty with Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry by Mildred D. Taylor. The main skills acquired has been summarizing, making connections, analyzing passages, writing an argument essay, and essay response to literature, as well as literature circle groups. Grade 6 students are also participating in the Battle of the Books.\n\nDebate\n\nOur Middle School Debate Team, led by Mr. Kaspzyk, has established itself with great success within the Kansas City debate community. Students competed in three tournaments (Sumner Academy, University Academy and Debate Kansas City Champs) and did very well, 4th place in Novice and Varsity Student Congress (7th grade student), 5th place in Novice Student Congress (8th grade student), 4th out of 40 teams in Novice Policy debate (6th grade), and one of our grade 6 girls, placed 9th out of 80 students for best speaker in the Novice division. Likewise, one of our 7th grade boys was nominated as best speaker for his chamber of student congress.\n\nWorld Languages\n\nStudents have been strengthening their French skills by listening to native speakers through their online textbook, while taking about their classes, asking questions and expressing negation, using near future tense to express where they are going and what they are going to do. The 8th graders have wrapped up the filming of their French and Spanish films and will be attending the International Film Festival at UMC on April 7th. Likewise, 8th grade students have been strengthening their Spanish skills while learning about the marketplace, clothing by seasons and industry materials. The unit culminated in a fashion show, where students narrated the clothing style and materials being modeled by fellow students.\n\nAthletics\n\nThank you to all our wonderful coaches and our amazing Sion athletes for another great basketball season! We are so proud of our teams! The teams played very well and all of our teams made it into the end of the season tournament. Sixth grade girls made it to the semi-final round of their tournament, they gave it their best but lost in the final minutes of the game. The sixth grade boys also played very well. After a great season, the 7th grade boys made it to the semi-final round and lost a heart-breaker in the final seconds of the game. Seventh grade girls lost in the first round of their tournament, but played very well. Likewise, 8th grade boys lost in the semi-final round. Congratulations to the 8th grade girls who won the Parochial League Tournament this past Saturday. Boys volleyball and track practices will start after spring break. Go Sion Lions!\n\nStudent Life\n\nFeast Day\n\nJanuary 20 marked the 175th anniversary of what the Congregation of Our Lady of Sion affectionately refers to as \"the event of January 20, 1842\". Both schools celebrated with Mass at the Grade School, along with other Sion schools throughout the world, with school-wide events and treats! Continuing the tradition of the tradition of the founding sisters, who promoted doing fun and engaging activities during Feast Day, Maisons participated in the annual \"Minute to Win It\" competition hosted by Middle School faculty on January 20. Orange House was the winner!\n\nSocial Emotional Learning\n\nMrs. Leslie Berger (high school counselor intern and head basketball coach) is carrying out part of her internship at our grade school by working with K-8 students in social emotional learning sessions, where students acquire critical competencies necessary for academic and life success in areas like: kindness, self-concept, self-respect and respect for others, resolving conflicts, managing emotions, and making responsible decisions, among others. Each group will participate in 6-8 sessions depending on the schedule.\n\nSion Summer Spectacular\n\nWe are thrilled to offer engaging, innovative, and age-appropriate summer enrichment opportunities for boys and girls in the arts, STEM, wellness and fitness led by our outstanding faculty and renowned industry partners.
