        "text": "Morquio syndrome is a rare metabolic condition that can cause a person to develop skeletal problems. The life expectancy of a person with Morquio syndrome can vary depending on the severity of their symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of Morquio syndrome occur due to a gene alteration that a person inherits from their parents. These alterations allow the large sugar molecule keratan sulfate to build up to toxic levels inside a person’s cells.\n\nThe buildup of keratan sulfate can damage a person’s skeleton over time. It may also affect the eyes, heart, and respiratory system. A person with Morquio syndrome may have a reduction in life expectancy due to their condition.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss Morquio syndrome, including its symptoms, treatments, and outlook.\n\nMorquio syndrome, also known as MPS IV and mucopolysaccharidosis IV, is a rare metabolic condition. This term refers to a condition that disrupts a person’s metabolism.\n\nMorquio syndrome is a form of mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). These conditions affect the enzymes that the body uses to break down long chains of sugars, which play important roles, such as helping to build bone.\n\nWhen a person has Morquio syndrome, they do not produce enough of certain enzymes that the body uses to break down keratan sulfate. This allows the keratan sulfate to build up to toxic levels, which can cause problems in a person’s:\n\nbones\n\narteries\n\neyes\n\njoints\n\nears\n\nskin\n\nteeth\n\nDr. Luis Morquio first discovered Morquio syndrome in Uruguay in 1929. That same year, Dr. James Brailsford also noted the symptoms of the condition in England. As such, the condition is sometimes known as Morquio-Brailsford syndrome.\n\nMorquio syndrome is a rare condition, although its exact prevalence is unknown. Research estimates that it occurs in 1 in every 200,000 or 300,000 people. The National Organization of Rare Diseases (NORD) notes that the syndrome affects people of all genders equally.\n\nThe 1993 book Freak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick includes a character who has Morquio syndrome.\n\nThere are two different subtypes of Morquio syndrome, known as MPS IVA and MPS IVB. Both subtypes can have the same symptoms. However, symptoms of MPS IVB are generally less severe than those of MPS IVA.\n\nThe subtype of Morquio syndrome a person has depends on what enzyme the condition relates to. MPS IVA occurs due to a lack of the enzyme N-acetyl-galactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS). MPS IVB occurs due to a deficiency in the enzyme beta-galactosidase.\n\nNORD notes that 95% of people with Morquio syndrome have MPS IVA.\n\nMorquio syndrome results from a variation in the genes responsible for creating enzymes. The enzyme a person is deficient in will depend on the subtype of Morquio syndrome they have.\n\nMPS IVA occurs due to a variation in the GALNS gene, which affects the GALNS enzyme. MPS IVB occurs due to an alteration in the GLB1 gene, which impacts the beta-galactosidase enzyme.\n\nA person has two copies of every gene in their body, one from each of their parents. Genes determine a person’s physical and behavioral traits. Morquio syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition. This means a person must receive a copy of the gene variation from both their parents to have the condition.\n\nIf both parents possess the gene alteration, their child will have a 25% chance of developing the condition.\n\nMorquio syndrome can cause a person to develop various symptoms, which may vary in severity. Unlike some types of MPS, Morquio syndrome does not affect a person’s intelligence.\n\nSymptoms of Morquio syndrome are progressive, meaning they develop over time. The first symptoms may appear during early childhood.\n\nThe symptoms include:\n\nshort stature\n\nknock knees, where a person’s legs curve inwards, causing their feet to be apart when their knees touch\n\nproblems with the ribs, chest, spine, hips, wrists\n\nloose, flexible joints\n\nrestricted movement in certain joints\n\nunderdevelopment of neck bones, resulting in a short neck\n\nvision loss\n\nrecurrent ear infections\n\nhearing loss\n\nfrequent upper respiratory tract infections\n\nsleep apnea\n\nexcessive curvature of the spine known as kyphoscoliosis\n\nflat feet\n\nunusual development of the growing ends of the long bones\n\nhip dislocation\n\narthritis\n\nprominent breastbone\n\nweakness of legs\n\nfacial characteristics such as a large head, broad mouth, prominent cheekbones, or small nose\n\nwidely spaced teeth with thin enamel\n\nwidely spaced eyes\n\nenlarged liver or spleen\n\nshort torso\n\nheart valve problems\n\nA healthcare professional can diagnose a person with Morquio syndrome using:\n\na person’s medical history\n\nphysical examinations\n\nskeletal X-rays\n\nurine glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) analysis, which measures the amount of GAG in a person’s urine\n\nKeratan sulfate is a type of GAG. If a person has high amounts of keratan sulfate in their urine, it can indicate that they have Morquio syndrome.\n\nA healthcare professional can use genetic testing to check what subtype of Morquio syndrome a person has. Genetic testing involves taking a sample of a person’s tissue, such as blood or skin. A healthcare professional sends this sample to a laboratory, where technicians check for gene alterations.\n\nThere is currently no cure for Morquio syndrome. However, treatments are available to manage its symptoms.\n\nEnzyme replacement therapy may help to slow the progress of MPS IVA. This treatment involves a person receiving enzymes via intravenous drip (IV) once a week. There is no enzyme replacement therapy available for MPS IVB.\n\nA healthcare professional may offer the following treatments to manage a person’s symptoms:\n\nsurgery to fuse the bones of the upper neck to prevent potential damage to the spinal cord\n\nsurgery to correct respiratory or vision problems\n\nphysical rehabilitation\n\npsychological support\n\nlearning optimization for people with difficulty seeing or hearing\n\nmobility aids\n\ngenetic counseling to help a person understand their diagnosis and treatment options\n\nThe outlook for a person with Morquio syndrome can depend on the severity of their symptoms.\n\nEvidence suggests that people with severe symptoms may only live until late childhood or adolescence. People with milder symptoms generally live into adulthood. However, their life expectancy may be lower.\n\nIf a person has a poorly developed connection between their first and second vertebrae due to Morquio syndrome, it can be life threatening. Minor injuries may cause the two vertebrae to slip, which can compress the spinal cord. Surgery is available that can fuse the two vertebrae, but life expectancy will still be lower.\n\nProblems with a person’s chest due to Morquio syndrome can put a strain on their heart and lungs. This may lead to respiratory failure.\n\nEvidence notes that spinal cord compression and airway obstruction are the two main causes of death for a person with Morquio syndrome."
