Difference Between Standard English And Creole The language of both Standard English and Creole presented in Caribbean literary texts is integral in understanding the narrative voices established within the texts as well as the socio cultural differences illustrated. This paper seeks to address issues raised by the representation of Creole in literary texts by closely examining three articles, Language use in West Indian Literature, The Language of Earl Lovelace, and Samuel Selvon s linguistic extravaganza: Moses Ascending . An important concept to be discussed is the connection between ideological perspective and code choice. In the article, Language Use in West Indian Literature written by Maureen Warner Lewis, language encompasses a word system of morphology, semantics, syntax, ...

This is portrayed in Errol John s, Moon on a Rainbow Shawl, 1958, where a poor educated girl, Ester, code switches. It is also displayed in Freddie Kissoon s, God and Uriah Butler, 1967, when Uriah Butler spoke Creole to his followers in informal situations but spoke Standard English in his public addresses, in a private conversation with a legal advisor and a friend who is more educated than him. The complications of sound meaning interpretation, widened in situations of diglossia and multilingualism, offering the writer the option of consciously encrypting multiple meanings into the literary text. In Dennis Scott s More Poem both Standard English and Rastafarian English was used allowing for ambiguity with a solitary voice and a salutary voice. Amongst prose writers, Samuel Selvon has most often make use of the vernacular. In his first novel, A Brighter Sun, 1952, there was code switching from Standard English to Creole. His other novel, The Lonely Londoners, 1956, he used a naturalistic flow with incorporating vernacular idioms, affect and speech. The participant observer first person narrative voice was established to carry out this purpose. The younger generations of writers find\n\n4. Hooke Unnatural Conjugation When studying putrifying substances , Hooke finds that with strange and unnatural copulations, several new kinds of Animals are produc d (Hooke 99). What Hooke is discussing in this passage is what he later refers to as accidental production (Hooke 106), his belief the production of moss, mould, and mushrooms occurs without any concurrent seminal principle (Hooke 106). Despite the specifics of Hooke s formulation, his belief in the productive power of strange and unnatural copulations (Hooke 99) resonates with Deleuze and Guattari s unnatural participations , and Latour s hybrids. Much like Hooke s microscopic representations, for Deleuze and Guattari such conjugation involves terms that are entirely heterogeneous: for example, a humanbeing, an animal, and a bacterium, a virus, a molecule, a microorganism (Deleuze and Guattari 242). Recent critical theory marks these couplings as its declared area of study, but for Hooke it exists as an unintended network of analogy that inheres to microscopic representation....

His subjects become Automatons (Hooke 100) in relation to the mechanical philosopher who is alone endowed with subject hood. Alongside this disavowal, Hooke is a skilled progenitor of hybrids. This accords to Latour s maxim that the more we forbid ourselves to conceive of hybrids, the more possible their interbreeding becomes (12). In establishing a strict divide between a nature to be examined and a humanity that does the examining, Hooke allows for his text and his practice to engender a proliferation of\n\n5. Mom Themes The movie Mother! came out on October 15, 2017. It was only rated a 7.1/10 from IMDb, 68% from Rotten Tomatoes, and a 74 from Metacritic. Those are only average scores showing that the movie wasn t too bad, but even with scores like those it only had a gross of $39.60 million USD in the box office. Mother! only made $7.53 million USD opening weekend, which is low compared to most movies. This is because people not understanding the theme and hidden symbols within the movie along with how it was advertised and who it had competed with. The movie had underlying themes that left everything symbolic. Three major themes that the movie portrayed was man s destruction, how history repeats itself, and God s will /mother nature. Jennifer Lawrence was casted as Mother! herself; representing mother nature. The movie begins with a few uninvited guests that quickly lead to hell. This scenario directly correlates with the Book of Genesis. God s creations here on Earth tend to get wild on occasions, which causes Him to wash away whatever has been created and begin again.

There s also a lighter spotted several times throughout the film; first appearing in the beginning with the uninvited guests. This is a key to mother s emancipation.

Forums quickly followed and allowed users to post messages on websites that could then be accessed by other users at a later date in a much more accessible way than ever before (Eisenhauer, 2016). Search engines now allow for rapid access to forums across the internet all rapid filtering and access to information that previously would have taken days to locate and isolate. There are also no limits to the topics that are covered on the internet and the open nature of forums allows many users to contribute to finding a solution to a problem, or in the discussion of an idea. Because of the open nature of forums they are thus open to abuse and normally require some form of registration to be able to contribute and are generally monitored by moderators and admins. Forums function well if they have an active engaging community. Chaffey and White (2012, p. 247) provide some guidelines on what is necessary for a functional community. A community needs at least 150 members, of with these members there needs to be at least one loud voices per 30 members. These loud voices can be experts in their field. Experts are respected by the community and acknowledgement and support other experts in the community. If all these factors are in place then an online community will become self sustaining and can grow. A functioning online community can be a\n\n7. Relationship In Night By Elie Wiesel Night Short Response In the memoir Night, by Elie Wiesel, one of the main themes is family, more specifically the relationship between father and son. For many people, family is something that they value the most. In the beginning, the first priority of many of the inmates is to avoid separating from their family members and not to lose them. However as the book progresses, the prisoners are more concerned about surviving on their own rather than taking care of their loved ones, who have become a burden. Elie later feels the same way about his old and sick father, but tries to take care of him as much as he can. The most important thing that gives Elie the strength to fight this battle, is his family. In the beginning, when the police were... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Elie s father becomes very ill and weak, and is diagnosed with dysentery. Elie tries his very best to help his father. No matter how many times Elie explains to his father that they would return home soon, I knew that I was no longer arguing with him but with Death itself, with Death that he had already chosen (Wiesel 105). His father has grown so weak that he has lost hope. Elie feels a sense of helplessness because he is not able to do anything for his father. His father s illness makes him very fragile and vulnerable, and unable to do anything. Elie tries his very best to fulfill all his wishes, but he struggles to do so. Although Elie is aware of the fact that his father is going to die soon, he tries his best to give him as much as hope as he possibly can.When he moves on with the mob and remembers that his father was with him, a thought crept into my mind: if only I didn t find him! If only I were relieved of this responsibility, I could use all my strength to fight for my survival...Instantly, I felt ashamed, ashamed of myself forever (Wiesel 106). Elie knows that his father is a threat to his survival because he is sick and can no longer do anything. However, Elie is guilty of even thinking this about his father.

The Issue Of Abortion In the world today we have a problem with abortion. There are multiple arguments on whether abortion is right or not. It causes a lot of uproar in America today and even leads to riots. It completely changes the way people value a human life. Mothers are just willing to kill a human baby just because they don t want a child. They never even give the baby a chance to live and it is completely unfair to the child. I have a solution to this problem and here it is. I propose that instead of killing the babies that the mother wants aborted, we kill the mothers instead.

Analysis Of The Freedom Riders Nearly a century after the civil war ended, African Americans continued to encounter discrimination, racism, inequality, and segregation. Because of their skin color, they were labeled as second class citizens. They decided to take actions into their own hands and fight against segregation and attain equal civil liberties. They have faced countless battles, setbacks and enormous resistance. Activists from all around the country, with all types of backgrounds joined in on the fight against racial injustice. Their main strategy emphasized passive resistance and nonviolence. On May 4th, 1961, thirteen brave individuals set out on a mission to start a national movement to overturn segregation in the south. Under the leadership of Congress of Racial Equality, seven African Americans and six whites traveled together on two commercial buses, the Greyhound and the Trailways. They called themselves The Freedom Riders. They intended to travel from Washington DC to New Orleans, Louisiana together. On the way, they would deliberately violated Jim Crow laws. The Freedom Riders risked being assaulted, arrested, and even killed. Many other civil rights activists opposed their plan because they felt the idea was too confrontational and dangerous, and could possibly result in a setback for the civil rights movement. Despite the risks and opposition, the Freedom Riders did not abort their mission. The activists were tired of waiting, therefore they decided that they are not going to\n\n11. How Far Did The Italian Influence The Economy Of The... During the Middles Ages there was constant war and little progress politically, economically, culturally, or socially. However, after the three major crisis signaled the end of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the rebirth of classical arts, literature, and learning throughout Europe, began and created a prosperous time period for the 1300s 1600s AD, which began in Italy. Although Italy was the first country to be hit by the bubonic plague and have 60% of its population die, Italy was also the starting country of the Renaissancefor three main reasons, its large city states, its wealthy merchant class, and its heritage to the Classical civilizations. The first reason and the catalyst of the Renaissance is wealthy merchants that fueled the economy, adopted and proliferated the values of the Renaissance, and studied the Classical influence and heritage.

Once the merchants became powerful to govern a city state, they often patronized artists and architects to attract more people to their city and overall have a better relationship with the citizens.

Specifically, the city becoming more prosperous, urbanized, and developed whereas the merchants become more powerful, influential, and wealthy. In addition, the city states that are influenced by merchants who have studied the Classical civilizations are cities that lead Europe through the Renaissance and often provided the standards for life and work.

It should also investigate if the employees in the banks are corrupt or have relation with the cartels. The Mexican Government should conclude obsolete programs and devote those resources to drug cartels. The Mexican Government spends unnecessary millions of dollars paying for local police departments that do not combat the trafficking of drugs. Local authorities are afraid of confronting the drug cartels. We can just watch how they transport the drug from the Silverado to the Ram, crossing from Sinaloa to Chihuahua, We know who they are but we do not dare to oppose them, it s a death sentence (Soto). Alberto Soto stated that the local police department has been corrupted or threatened, They do not care about their jobs but they fear for their families . The actual military program must also be replaced it. The government should cancel the PGR and create a stronger fiscal judicial program that supervises the Mexican army movements toward Chihuahua and Sinaloa. Felipe Calderon has sent more than 24,000 soldiers and Federal police to nine states, included Sinaloa and Chihuahua, to combat the cartels (Medina 1). This mobilization requires a stronger supervisor instead of the PGR. There had been several army movements against drug cartels in Cd.

Specifically, personal mastery is honest reflection and evaluation that identifies needs that contribute to the achievement of organizational goals. This can also help with conflicts by being honest with ourselves and having a shared vision with the organization.

He was left wondering where they were, what they were doing, or if they were even still alive. It was not until he was released that he discovered the majority of his family had been murdered as a result of the Holocaust. Frankl speaks very highly of his wife within his novel. In fact, one may argue that if it was not for the love Frankl had for his wife, he may not have survived. He spoke of love and theorized that love is the ultimate goal in which a man can strive for. This can be related to how the love one man had for his work, and the love one man had for his son, saved their lives. In Viktors case, it was the love he had for his wife which would motivate him to stay in sane spirits. By imagining conversations in his mind with his wife where they would speak back and forth, Frankl made an important realization which he would later write about. To him, it did not matter if his wife was alive or not. Frankl, once again, is acting out in a way which supports his idea that suggests you cannot change your situation, no matter how horrible it is, but you may change your attitude.

Choosing one over the other places you on one side of yet another barbecue debate. As with most culinary debates, both sides have some strong arguments as we will see when we compare these two methods of flavoring meat. What is the difference between a dry rub and a wet rub? As you might expect, dry rubs have only dry ingredients. They will typically include powdered spices and sometimes dry herbs along with salt and sugar. The idea is to create a crust for the meat that will flavor it without making it too moist. You should apply the rub liberally to the outside of the meat and massage it in. The longer you let it sit on the surface of the meat, the more flavor it will impart to the meat. Because all of the spices stay on the surface, a dry rub is a great way to add a controlled amount of flavor without overpowering the natural flavor of the meat....

You want a wet rub to be thin enough to easily coat a piece of meat but thick enough to stick to it. Like dry rubs, wet rubs should be applied heavily to the surface of the meat. Is one easier or better to use when grilling? Dry rubs are easier to apply and generally less messy to work with than wet rubs. In addition, a dry rub will not drip onto your coals and cause flare ups or lower their temperature. Wet rubs have advantages in that meat should be more tender and flavorful, especially if you let it sit in the marinade for at least 24\n\n18. The Color Of Water Analysis Color of God The Color of Water is the story of about a young black man, James McBride, finding himself through his mother, Ruth McBride. He tells his story, focusing on his childhood in New York City. His white mother also tells her story, where she was raised a Jew. She married a black man and had eight children, including James. Before James was even born, her husband died. She remarried to another black man and had four more children, all black. While growing, James and his siblings look for answers about their odd lives in their mother. One of their common questions is about skin color. After church one day, James asks his mother about the color of God. What color is God s spirit It doesn t have a color, she said. God is the color... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... She is very spiritual, emphasizing the importance of church and God to her children. Mommy loved God. She went to church each and every Sunday, the only white person in sight... (McBride 45). She tells the children children to focus on their education and God, not the color of their skin. To the her, the only person whose opinion matters is God. If God loves both whites and blacks, why should it matter what color one s skin is? If this view was shared by all Americans, life for blacks would have been much easier. This is why Ruth McBride sees no problem with marrying a black man. He is just another human being, whom she loved. When her first husband died, leaving her with eight children, she remarried quickly. Like the first, he was black, and she was able to look past the color of his skin and see his humanity. She, like God, sees past his skin and looks within. He also dies, but not before giving Ruth four more children, making a total of twelve children, all with different skin color than Ruth.

The Importance Of Injudice In To Kill A Mockingbird Our forefathers once said that all men were created equal, but our society does not seem to acknowledge that message. In truth, no one is seen as an equal to another person; there is always a partial judgmental factor that comes into play when viewing another person. As humans, it is our nature to judge and assume things before we really understand the true meaning and value of it. Throughout history, prejudice has been a common theme in every society, from the Romans to the colonists. It has only been recognized as a major problem recently that was slowly tearing up the foundation of nations around the world, creating misconceptions between people while building up a toxic environment. Harper Lee s famous book, To Killa Mockingbird, depicts a young girl, Scout, growing up in the Jim Crow era, trying to understand the prejudice and racism that was so commonly used in her community. Similarly, Tim Wises article, No Innocence Left to Kill: Racism, Injustice and Explaining America to My Daughter leaves people wondering how prejudice is indirectly affecting children and their mindsets. Both authors suggest a common theme, that prejudice affects everyone, old or young, scarring them, and creating a larger gap in society because it isolating people from one another out of misconceptions. Both documents show that prejudice can start influencing kids at a young age and can affecttheir mindset for the following years. In To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee\n\n21. Theme Of Openness In To Kill A Mockingbird Through evaluation of the character Tom Robinson, one can find evidence portraying him as an honest, open man and also as one who is genuinely good natured, inside and out. Throughout the trial, Tom Robinson clearly demonstrates that he has nothing to hide. Very early on in his examination, Atticus asks him about a jail sentence he served once before. Tom once received thirty days for disorderly conduct (Lee 192). Tom and another man got into a fight; only Tom had to serve time because the other man was able to afford the fine. Tom admits to this charge without any prodding. He is entirely open about it and does not try to hide anything. He freely acknowledges what happened. Jem points out that this entire scene was a ploy by Atticus to prove to the jury that... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Aside from being open, Tom is also a deeply good natured man. He is exceedingly polite at all times, even above the bounds of the time period s Jim Crow laws. During his testimony, Tom mentions the fact that he always tipped his hat to Mayella when he passed. He could have just avoided eye contact and hurried by, but instead he took the time to stop and acknowledge this woman who, to the rest of Maycomb, was considered no better than trash. It is also mentioned that when Mayella began to make advances, Tom wanted to get away, but he also didn t wanta be ugly... didn t wanta push her or nothin (Lee 197). Granted, according to the Jim Crow laws, Tom could have been punished severely for striking a white woman. However, I believe that the way in which Tom repeatedly states he did not want to harm her seems to suggest a higher, more gentlemanly motive. I believe that even had Mayella not been white, or this particular piece of the Jim Crow laws not a threat, Tom would have wanted to avoid striking her if he could. It is just a part of who he is as a respectable man. As Scout indicates, in many ways his manners were as good as Atticus s (Lee\n\n22. Bullying And The American Medical Association In a study taken by the American Medical Association it was reported that over 3.2 million students are victims of bullying each year. Out of these 3.2 million they found that approximately 160,000 teens skip school every day and 1 in 10 students drop out to school to escape from repeatedly being bullied. Reading these statistics, you can almost hear them call for someone to step up against this horrid and harassing act known as bullying. However, in a room full of bystanders, not one voice has the courage to stand up and intervene when someone is being bullied. As parents, the main goal to have should be obtaining every bit of information you can on what is happening in the lives of your child and teach them how they are capable of turning things around and stepping up against bullying by becoming an upstander. When they witness someone being bullied, a bystander s first instincts are to remain silent and try to slip away from the bully as he/she throws another student against a locker or calls them names and teases them for being different. Although the child may empathize with the person being targeted, they retaliate to avoid embarrassment if they speak up, or they may feel as though they do not have the power or social status to challenge and to change what they are witnessing. Other assumptions why kids don t get involved is because they may not want to become the next target, they have been told to mind their own business in the past or fear the reputation of\n\n23.

But what about children who grow up thinking differently? Why do some strive for high paying careers while others refuse school and are seemingly ok with staying working class?

Despite they criminal activity, most of the Hallway Hangers desire to make enough money to move their families out of the projects. The Brothers are a group of mostly black boys (with the exception of one) who so not smoke, drink regularly, and value education as they all attend high school. Though they are merely a peer group and not their own subculture as they value academics and athletics and are not as bothered by the stigma of living in the projects. Describing the differences in the Hallway Hangers and the Brothers, the MacLeod points out that the Hallway Hangers rarely have parental supervision, many have lived in public housing for several years, many have absent fathers, and the educational attainment of their families is very low. The Brothers on the other hand have more parents and siblings who graduated high school and attended at least some college, more have father figures living in the house, and their average time living in Clarendon Heights is less than the Hallway Hangers.

The Importance Of College Is A College Worth It Every year, around 20.4 million students in the United States go to college. Most students enroll in their college or university without thinking of a simple question. Is all the hard work worth it? Personally, I have never given this question any serious consideration and the research I have done has opened my eyes. I attend classes along with over 5,000 students here at UNK, and I doubt many have had the opportunity to do the research and decide for themselves. As I began my research to answer the question, I noticed something that stood out to me. There are many more articles that say collegeis well worth it, than articles that say otherwise. I began with an article by Liz Weston of TIME. She provided statements and research on both side but ultimately swayed towards saying that a bachelors degree is worth more than a high school diploma. She situated the article based on The reduced conviction among recent graduates is hardly surprising. Those grads emerged with more debt and poorer employment prospects due to a struggling economy.

History often intertwines with culture to give a more well rounded view of particular places and people. In the nineteenth century, nationalism began to take hold in Europe. While it might be common to think of nationalism in terms of revolt, nationalism also served as a unifying force through cultural elements, such as folklore. Individuals from around the world began collecting folk tales, songs, and dances that contributed to the centralization of nationalistic movements that created independent nations. One such collector was Francis James Child, an American Professor of Rhetoric... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Folklore was directly connected with Romantic nationalism, because it embodies the traditional elements of the way of life of a group of people and the creative expressions developing naturally as a part of this way of life. 14 Tangible cultural artifacts such as stories, dances, ballads, and hand crafts reveal general beliefs of particular groups.15Child embodied the Romantic nationalism movement. When Child recorded the English and Scottish Popular Ballads, he specifically wrote in the vernacular and dialect of the groups where he collected the stories and songs. Also, his bibliography lists over fifty manuscripts in addition to several hundred printed collections. For each ballad, he included every version he knew of. He preceded each ballad with a note explaining its origin and its parallels in world literature, referencing texts in over forty languages. 16 Child researched manuscripts from England and Scotland, particularly old manuscripts that had transcribed the words of actual singers before cheap printing had allowed corruptions to creep into the texts. To retain the authenticity of the ballads, he planned to use only works orally transmitted by uneducated people. 17 Additionally, Child sought both advice and aid from scholarly communities located in Britain and North America, especially Child s fellow Harvard scholars during\n\n28. Genetically Modified Food And Its Effects On The Body As... GMOs are taking over our food sections and are in many things we consume. It is a genetically modified organism, where the genes, which include specific proteins, from the DNA of one organism are put into another in a laboratory. It is known as the transfer of genes between species. They are created to fight off negative effects of the environment such as draught, pesticides, and nutrient deficient soil. People are becoming more concerned with its effects on the body. I will discuss the pros and cons of consuming GMOs. I will then make an argument on whether or not it is safe to consume, if the pros outweigh the cons. I will compare genetically modified foodto naturally produced food. Do GMOs have the same chemical reactions in the body... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... For this reason, many think they are unsafe or questionable. The discomfort that GMOs bring causes people to make various false claims. For example, there are theories that they cause cancer and have negative effects on the environment. The lack of education concerning GMOs invite sensationalist claims and lead people to make uninformed decisions. There are pros and cons to creating GMOs, but the pros overwhelm the cons. There are many pros to having GMOs. According to John Hibma from the Countryside Small Stock Journal, Dr. Margaret Smith, a geneticist from Cornell University, believes that genetically engineered food can increase the quality of the crops, increase yields, and reduce the cost of production, which will be better for the economy. The improvements can be made much faster, environmental conditions can be better tolerated, and they can be sold faster compared to traditional planting methods. Transferring genes or DNA can speed up and improve the development of crops. Defective genes can be fixed or modified. For example, corn, soybeans, and canola now have anti herbicide and insecticide traits. The reduced use of insecticide has benefited the environment by increasing the life of the soil and less use of harmful chemicals, which leads to less pollution and less intake of them through food and water. Many farmers have reported improved conditions. According to Dr. Smith, although there is a greater amount of herbicide being used for genetically modified\n\n29.

She was considered a porcelain princess and often received comments about her attractiveness. She always had the finest clothes and was very up to date with her sense of style. When arriving in Canada her perception of herself changed as she realized that she was not the most attractive girl. All of the other girls walked around with thin eyebrows and red lipstick, whereas Ewa had bushy eyebrows and wore no lipstick. The clothing the Ewa wore was also quite different than that of Ewa s. Because of her family s lower political caste, her family was unable to provide the money for Ewa to look like all the other girls. She had to rely on the charitable donations of people such as the Rosenbergs. In Cracow, this would never be the case. Growing up in Cracow, Ewa had many close friendships.

Things Fall Apart Fixed Mindset Essay Does having a fixed mindset restrain people from experiencing and enjoying new opportunities? My answer is yes. In Chinua Achebe s Things Fall Apart, this becomes apparent in some situations. The main protagonist, Okonkwo, shows many times that he has a fixed mindset and is unwilling to adapt to the new ways showing themselves to the Ibo people. Then they came to the tree from which Okonkwos body was dangling, and they stopped dead (Achebe 127). By restricting himself from adapting, Okonkwo decides that taking his own life is his only opportunity to leave, no matter how shameful it is. Since Okonkwo has a fixed mindset, he is unable to change many of his ways. In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits (Sternberg). This means that people with fixed mindsets refuse change and are dubious as to the possibility of being able to change themselves. As a result of this, many problems arise in the lives of people with this mindset, including Okonkwo.... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Unoka, the grown up, was a failure (Achebe 4).

He is so scared of becoming his father and changing his ways that he resorts to beating people to show his dominance. And when she returned he beat her very heavily (Achebe 19).

Gamboh 2016 Film is my passion. I thoroughly enjoy watching and analyzing movies finding the pros and cons. In film there are many different pieces that have to go together in order to make a movie work including: cinematography, the actual image and how it is displayed; sound, the score, sound effects and overall how clear it is to understand what actors are saying; the editing, how all the individual clips are put together; and dialogue and story, what the actors are saying and what the movie is about. A bad movie probably has done most of these poorly. A good movie may be lacking in one of these departments. A great movie has all bases covered, however, there are exceptions on this depending on personal preference. Some movies might end up being controversial. Some may love it. Same may hate it.

Kernberg s Theory Of Narcissistic Personality Disorder Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is one of the four personality disorders in Cluster B. These four personality disorders are tied together due to similar symptoms. People with a Cluster B personality disorder are often viewed as overly emotional, self dramatizing, and unstable. The other three Cluster B disorders are antisocial, borderline, and histrionic. NPD is characterized by a pattern of grandiosity, a constant need of admiration, and a lack of empathy for others (Frey, 2012). According to Kernberg and Kohut, the roots of NPD can be traced to disturbances in the parent child relationship before the child turned three years old (Frey, 2012). However, Kernberg differed from Kohut in that Kernberg believed that NPD was rooted in a defense by the child towards an unempathetic and cold parent (Frey, 2012). This paper will explore Kernberg s theory as it applies to NPD and its treatment. As well as examine the neurobiology and diversity of NPD. Theory A person s character or personality is made up of various traits (Hertz, 2011). Some of those traits can be adaptive and useful in one situation yet dysfunctional in another (Hertz, 2011). A person is diagnosed with a personality disorderwhen these character traits become so maladaptive and inflexible that they begin to cause significant impairment in occupational or social functioning or cause subjective distress (Hertz, 2011). As previously mentioned, some of the most common characteristics of NPD include having a constant need for admiration, grandiosity, and a lack of interest in anyone but themselves (Marissen, Brouwer, Hiemstra, Deen, Franken, 2016). Other patterns of NPD include a very high sense of entitlement, arrogant, and feeling like they are very special and can only be understood by and associate with other high status people like themselves (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Working with clients with NPD can be quite difficult as they tend to feel like they can only work with a therapist that is the best, meaning that the therapist has to be worthy of working with them.

My Landslide Poem Meaning The song Landslide performed by Fleetwood Mac has been a piece of my life for as long as I can remember. I recall my sisters and I sitting at our kitchen table in Orlando reciting the words to the song as easily as reading a book. Once we moved to Connecticut, this song still stayed apart of our lives and I have continued to listen to this song consistently to this day. Over the years, the meaning of the song has adapted to what I was going on to in life. As I grew older, the song gained more meaning than when I would listen to it as child. When I was younger, around the age of five, the song did not have much meaning to me. It was simply another song with a catchy melody. I truly did not understand the point the artist was attempting to get across to the listener through the metaphors in the lyrics. The meaning behind it was alien to me. I would sing the words, but the significance behind the words I sang rung blank in my brain.... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... I was scared and did not know what to expect for this next step in my life. At this time, I was incredibly insecure. My older sisters and brother always told me that freshman year was when things begin to change. You may make new friends, you may lose friends, you may get good grades, and you may get bad grades. They reminded me that our high school was three times as big as the middle school. With that, they also told me that I may get overwhelmed but was nothing I could do about it and I had to go no matter what. In the song, the songwriter questions her ability to handle the next part of her life. She asks herself if she can handle whatever life has to throw at her even if it does get hard. This part of the song really spoke to me. It showed me that everyone is vulnerable at times, and it is a normal feeling when parts of your life are starting as well as\n\n41. Вї Tono Estas Analysis Hola, ВїComo estas? I just feel like you re a Spanish person. As you know I am will not Bill. That s the only thing that I will never except. I am a balloon of expressions and emotions that I will most likely show during class( I hope it isn t too distracting). My sister is Anna, I am not anything like her, I am the total opposite. I am part of a family of four who lives on 50 acres of woodlands. It is amazing just to walk through the woods and enjoy the view and listen to the animals which include wolves, deer, moose, bear turtles, otters and even crane. But that also means firewood, lots and lots of firewood. My most favorite thing in the whole wide world. We have to stack 20 quarts of wood for 6 months of winter. I have two adorable dogs and one cat.Gunnar, Magaret, and Isabella. I love them with all my heart but they all have their times of doing incredibly stupid things. For instance, when Gunnar was a puppy he had a habit of eating socks that were left on the floor. He ate everything from tube socks to ankle socks. One day he decided to eat my very small size two ankle socks. And this time it got caught in his intestines and he almost died that night. But we caught it just in time and sped to the vet ER. Even though he survived he did get stitches from his hind legs to his center stomach, and had to wear ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... It is by far the greatest TV show ever created even though i hate Shonda Rhimes who is the creator of the show. She has killed off almost every character I loved in that show. Seriously, she is making the show fall apart and I think a lot of people agree with me. For instance, in season four George O Malley decides to leave the hospital and become a doctor in a war zone. And everyone is trying to stop him, because George was the sweetheart of the show. And while walking home he decides to jump and push a stranger out of the way from a bus and he s the one who gets hit and"
