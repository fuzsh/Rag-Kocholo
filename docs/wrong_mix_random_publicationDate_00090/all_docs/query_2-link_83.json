        "text": "Evergy Missouri West, Inc.: Update to credit analysis - Credit Opinion – 2020/04/28 – US$ 250.00 – ...Evergy Missouri West's (Missouri West, Baa2 stable) credit profile reflects the fully regulated nature of its vertically integrated utility operations in Missouri, where we view the legislative and regulatory environment to be improving. Nevertheless, regulatory lag continues due to the use of a historical test year and limited infrastructure trackers or riders. Base rates are frozen through 6 December 2021. Missouri West's spike in CFO pre-WC to debt ratio in 2018 was a result of a temporary lower debt level and regulatory accruals that were refunded to customers in 2019. We expect cash flow will steadily decline over the next two years as the company's net operating loss tax shield is amortized. But we calculate Missouri West's ratio of CFO pre-WC to debt to remain above 16%. On 21 January 2020, Missouri's West's parent Evergy, Inc. (Baa2 stable) received a letter from hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. outlining two proposals that Elliott thinks Evergy should pursue to create additional...\n\nKCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company: Regulator's indicative vote on Sibley coal plant is credit negative for KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations - Issuer Comment – 2019/10/11 – US$ 200.00 – ...On 9 October, the Missouri Public Service Commission (MOPSC) expressed its intention in a non-binding vote to defer operations and maintenance (O&M) cost savings from the Sibley coal plant's (Sibley) early retirement in 2018 and passing along the savings to customers. If the MOPSC final and binding vote remains in favor of deferring savings, it would be credit negative for Evergy, Inc.'s (Evergy Baa2 stable) KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company (GMO, Baa2 stable) because its an indication that the company and its regulators are not on the same page. Although GMO has been able to retain O&M savings since Sibley's retirement, the Missouri Office of Public Counsel and the Midwest Energy Consumers Group filed a complaint to instead return the savings to customers. The company's ability to retain savings was determined in the last general rate case, which was in October 2018. The MOPSC's non-binding 3-2 vote in favor of deferred savings is contrary to the MOPSC staff's recommendation and...\n\nKCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company: Update to credit analysis - Credit Opinion – 2019/04/16 – US$ 250.00 – ...KCP&L - Greater Missouri Operations Company's (GMO) credit profile reflects the fully regulated nature of its vertically integrated utility operations in Missouri, where we view the legislative and regulatory environment to be improving. The passage of Missouri Senate Bill 564 (SB 564) allows for plant-in-service accounting (PISA) for electric utilities which will provide for recovery of and a return on 85% of qualifying electric plant upon commercial operation that was previously lost from the time plant went into service and a related order was issued. Nevertheless, regulatory lag continues due to the use of a historical test year, limited infrastructure trackers or riders, along with base rates frozen through 1 November 2021. GMO's spike in cash flow in 2018 is a result of regulatory accruals that will be refunded to customers in 2019 coupled with a temporary lower debt level. Moreover, we expect cash flow will steadily decline over the next few years as the company's tax shield is amortized....\n\nKCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company: Update to credit analysis - Credit Opinion – 2018/03/27 – US$ 250.00 – ...KCP&L - Greater Missouri Operations Company's (GMO) credit profile reflects the fully regulated nature of its vertically integrated utility operations in Missouri, where we view the regulatory environment to be stable yet challenging at times. We incorporate the expectation that GMO will continue to receive reasonable general rate case outcomes which allow the company to earn its return on equity. GMO is weakly positioned and we expect the impact of tax reform will further pressure GMO's key credit measures, with cash flow from operations before changes in working capital (CFO pre-WC) expected to be in the mid teens range. We will again assess the company's credit profile and outlook when the merger process is completed...."
