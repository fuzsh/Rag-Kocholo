Countries where we process data may have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country.\n\nHOW WE PROTECT PERSONAL DATA\n\nThe Company maintains reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the user's personal data and information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that seek to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account technological reality, cost, scope, context and purposes of processing weighted against the severity and likelihood that the processing could threaten individual rights and freedoms. For example, we use commercially reasonable security measures such as encryption, firewalls, and Secure Socket Layer software (SSL) or hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) to protect personal data.\n\nIf the Company collects account information for payment or credit, the Company will use the information only to complete the task for which the account information was offered.\n\nUnfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
