        "text": "Teamwork is an extraordinary characteristic for any organizations or groups to strive to its fullest potential. According to the Greenberg text “An organization is a structured social system consisting of groups and individuals working together to meet upon some agreed-upon objectives.” In the movie Miracle, the theme of teamwork is portrayed through the Men’s Hockey Team’s head coach Herb Brooks leadership in training recent college graduates to play hockey in one of the most challenging competition in the world, which were the 1980s Olympics.\n\nOne of the more important skills students will learn outside the classroom is teamwork. This quality can not be taught it must be learned by experience. Members will be on teams to compete in competitions. Students must learn the limits and strengths of their team member if they wish to succeed. This skill prepares students for the team work assignments which will be required in classes, as well as in everyday\n\nTeamwork is recognizing that working together gets things done. In the novel Freak the Mighty there is a kid named Kevin who has Morquio syndrome. Kevin meets a kid his age named Max, who is the complete opposite of Kevin. Max is big for his age, while Kevin is very small. Kevin is also super smart. When the two of them are together they are Freak the Mighty. Kevin and Max are able to accomplish much more together than they can separately.\n\nTeamwork: Noun; “cooperative or coordinated effort on the part of a group of persons acting together as a team or in the interests of a common cause.” Written by Dictionary.com the word teamwork involves a group or team of people working together, like in the book Outcasts United. In the book Outcasts United by Warren St. John a soccer team was created for and by people all over the world called the “Fugees.” The Fugees weren't a very wealthy team and didn't have very many options because of their living conditions. The fact that they continued with strict practices and harsh conditions shows they believed in commitment and staying together.\n\nIn the book, Freak the Mighty, there are many themes that support the idea, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” The two main characters, Max and Kevin, both get bullied for having physical and mental challenges. They quickly realize that they can work together and combine their strengths. Kevin teaches Max words from his vocabulary and expands his creativity. Max helps Kevin become more mobile, by carrying him on his shoulders, allowing them to have imaginative adventures in the book.\n\nWhat is teamwork? Teamwork is defined as \"a formal work group consisting of people who work together intensely to achieve a common group goal.\" (University of Phoenix, Apollo Library, 2007). A group becomes a team when members demonstrate a commitment to one another to reach a common goal. There is a high degree of cohesiveness and accomplishment in a team. Simply put two heads are often better than one. (University of Phoenix, Apollo Library, 2007). Teamwork can help us communicate in many ways.\n\nAdelina has always dreamt of big things. People misjudged her and shunned her all of her young life. She’s lived with an abusive father who cherishes her little sister, peers who didn’t believe that she was capable of important responsibilities like everyone else, but most importantly, inquisitors who have attempted to execute her. But, now Adelina has bigger things in mind. Adelina soon discovers a power that she never realized she had on the night of her father’s death. Later, she figures out that there are others exactly like her, known as The Young Elites and that she is one of them. Eventually, she comprehends that she could use her own powers and the other Young Elites’ powers to make the citizens of Kenettra open their eyes and see who she really is, even if she has to kill in order to make that happen. This story and the story “ Freak The Mighty”, by Rodman Philbrick, demonstrate the theme to never judge\n\nThroughout time, working together has made much more of an impact than doing things single handedly. Teamwork is expressed as a great tool in both science and fiction and among many different species for various reasons. Other people can have skills and knowledge that one person does not and putting different knowledge together can create amazing things. There may be some disagreements as well and with them will come a compromise that will work for everyone. With teamwork lots of changes can be made even though it might not be the ultimate goal of the people or entities that are working together.\n\nFirst, learning to work, as a team, can be difficult if the person you’re working with always has to have the right answer or nobody wants to agree on something. It takes everyone in the group or on the team to work together to be successful in whatever it is they are trying to accomplish. The term\n\nIn its early stage, teamwork was more like dedication. Typically, one is assigned to render 15 minutes out of a movie, but we had 30 minutes because of lack of hands. It took me about 4 hours, so I worked non-stop from 7 to 11 on a weekday, and passed my part to the next in line. This was our daily routine. Each of us devoted our off-duty time to the activity we love with"
