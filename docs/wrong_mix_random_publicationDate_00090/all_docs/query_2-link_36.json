(Nasdaq: HLMN), a leading provider of hardware products and merchandising solutions, has opened its brand-new distribution hub in Belton, Missouri, a southern suburb of Kansas City.

We look forward to the Hillman’s success as it grows and creates jobs in the Kansas City area.”\n\n“Hillman’s decision to open a new distribution hub here in Missouri strategically positions them within 600 miles of 135+ million potential customers, helping them reach even more customers quickly and efficiently. We are excited to welcome Hillman to Missouri, and we are looking forward to watching them grow in our state,” said Subash Alias, CEO of Missouri Partnership.\n\n“The City of Belton is proud to be chosen as the newest location for Hillman. The leading North American hardware company plans to bring 120 new jobs to Belton’s Southview Commerce Center,” said Mayor of Belton, Norman K. Larkey Sr.\n\nThe Kansas City region offers abundant access to rail, air, water and road transportation, with 30% more interstate miles per capita than any other U.S. city. This contributes to the region as an ideal location for industrial growth, with 11.4 million sq. ft. of industrial space delivered in 2022, totaling an industrial market footprint of nearly 321 million sq. ft.\n\n“Hillman’s selection of Belton, Missouri, for its new facility reinforces our region as a hub for distribution,” said Chris Gutierrez, president of KC SmartPort. “The Kansas City region’s central location, multi-modal transportation, skilled workforce and vertical readiness help position leading companies like Hillman for continued growth.”\n\nFor those interested in becoming a part of the Hillman team in Belton, please visit hillmangroup.com/careers.\n\nAbout Hillman Solutions Corp.\n\nFounded in 1964 and headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, Hillman Solutions Corp.
