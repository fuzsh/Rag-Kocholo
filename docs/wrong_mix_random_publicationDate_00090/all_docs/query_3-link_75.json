        "text": "Overview\n\nDuring the Civil War, a 12-year-old boy who never even owned a pair of shoes steps up to become a hero by saving his older brother at the Battle of Gettysburg. Then he helps lead the Union to victory! Sound too heroic to believe? It’s true. At least mostly true. You see, Homer P. Figg does not always tell the whole truth about, well, anything. But from Maine to Pennsylvania, facing Union soldiers and Confederates, Underground Railroad conductors and circus ringleaders, Homer will tell any tale it takes to save his brother. Tom Isbell has adapted Rodman Philbrick’s Newbery Honor–winning book into a humorously staged story of Homer’s journey through thieves, spies, and scallywags as he makes his way through history."
