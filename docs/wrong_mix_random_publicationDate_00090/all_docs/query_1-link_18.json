It is extremely painful to consider the suffering and possible death of a child, and all involved need help. In the classroom, patients and peers can discuss concerns, ask questions, and experience their emotions. Lanny Van Allen of the Texas Education Agency explained that, although there is literature on death and dying, very little is available on cancer specifically.Her brief bibliography, listing such notables as The Chemo Kid by Robert Lipsyte and I Want To Grow Hair, I Want To Grow Up, I Want To Go to Boise by Erma Bombeck will make teachers aware of both medical facts and the affective behavior of patients and their care-givers. Additional materials and information on community resources can be obtained by calling The American Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345.\n\n-- Michaeline Chance-Reay\n\nColumbus State Community College, Ohio\n\n* At Home in Multicultural Adolescent Literature\n\nBonnie Ericson , California State University, Northridge, survived the earthquake last January, but her university home, like so many others, was destroyed. This cataclysmic event led her to develop her workshop centered onhomelessness as a theme in multicultural literature. She began her interactive,hands-on session with a discussion of recommended multicultural young adult literature featuring memorable homes, including such standards as Mildred Taylor 's trilogy featuring Cassie Logan and newer titles like White Lilacs by Caroline Meyer .\n\nEricson then shared several suggested activities for exploring the role of home in young adult and other literature. These included brainstorming phrases,sayings, and titles containing the word \"home\"; listing television programs,movies, or literature in which home plays a central role; clustering these with a star diagram; and reading descriptions of home taken from literature and predicting characterization based on them.\n\nHer session was lively and provocative; the handout was useful and filled with examples of how to make this timely issue of genuine concern and interest to adolescents in classrooms all over the country, whether homeless because of natural phenomena or not.\n\n-- Judith A. Hayn\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Wilmington\n\n* Who Is Up to What? What? Where? Current Research in Young Adult Literature\n\nPamela Sissi Carroll gathered several past winners of the ALAN Research Awards and other researchers to describe their projects and demonstrate the parameters of research in current young adult literature. Her own project,\"Discomfort Zone: When Caucasian Teachers Introduce African-American Literature to Young Adolescents,\" explored the tensions raised as teachers and student teachers try to discuss social and human issues in a classroom of individuals with differing cultural backgrounds and experiences. Many of the teachers,accustomed to abstracting these issues, felt inadequate to address such varied personal experiences presented in young adult literature.\n\nGail Gregg organized her traditionally unsuccessful high-school readers into a cadre of successful role models for younger students as they read young adult literature to younger students in a cross-age tutoring project. The attendance, confidence, and reading ability of these high-school readers increased as they experienced the admiring response of their young charges.\n\nLinda Spears-Bunton , in her study \"Young Adult Literature in Multicultural Contexts,\" described how, while African-American readers and texts in the research of literature were \"raced\" and \"gendered,\"European-American readers and texts were postured as \"non-raced\" and as\"non-gendered\" and perceived as \"just like us\" by white American readers.\n\nSandy Krickeberg summarized the results from her work in \"A National Teacher Survey on Young Adult Literature.\" She found that most of the teachers who were surveyed, though describing themselves as lifelong readers, did not habitually read young adult literature: 71% said that they receive information about young adult literature from professional journals. Four topics that teachers tried to avoid in their classroom literature were \"homosexuality,\"\"swearing,\" \"the occult,\" and \"sexual situations.\"\n\nLea Smith established numerous dichotomies in her study of \"The Portrayal of Females in Young Adult Literature\" indicating that many works still describe female protagonists in traditional roles.\n\n-- Suzanne Reid\n\nEmory & Henry College, Virginia\n\nNews from Publishers\n\nScholastic Books announces Scholastic Booktalks , a new publication written by Joni Bodart , a leading expert in the art of booktalking.
