        "text": "Midway Ford Proudly Celebrates More Than 60 Years Of Service\n\nWhere we are today:\n\nMidway Ford Truck Center, Inc.'s main location in Kansas City, Missouri is just south of Worlds of Fun on I-435 & MO 210 Highway. Founded in 1961, Midway is entirely employee owned. As owners of their Company, Midway's employees have a vested interest in ensuring customer satisfaction. As a consequence, Midway has empowered its employee owners to 'make customers happy' and this philosophy has worked well. It has helped create loyalty among its employees and superior relationships with customers.\n\nHow we got here:\n\nFounded in 1961, Midway Ford Truck Center, Inc. was Ford Motor Company's first Ford truck-only dealership in the nation. Started as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Company, with Mr. Dean Edwards as General Manager and 17 other employees, Midway was located in downtown Kansas City. In 1965, Mr. Edwards purchased the dealership from Ford Motor Company and under his leadership Midway prospered. By 1974 the dealership had expanded into 4 additional locations. Midway's main facility relocated to its present location in Northeast Kansas City in 1975.\n\nOur Leadership:\n\nMr. Edwards recognized that the rapid growth of Midway required additional leadership, and added Mr. Don Ahnger to his team. Mr. Ahnger's previous experience in public accounting and as a financial manager for a Ford dealership in Texas earned him the position as a financial manager for Midway Ford. Mr. Ahnger was promoted to CEO when Mr. Edwards retired. Mr. Edwards continued on as a consultant to Midway until his death in 2007.\n\nMr. Wiley (Trey) Meyer was hired in 1991 as Midway's Technology Manager. Mr. Meyer had worked part time during his college years in Midway's service department. In March of 2009, Mr. Meyer was promoted to President of Midway Ford Truck Center.\n\nOur Pride:\n\nMidway Ford has successfully utilized its centralized location in gaining national prominence. Its location has allowed access to many large trucking companies and is a major reason why over 90 percent of Midway Ford's business is commercial. The Company is a leading nationwide vendor of new and used trucks, truck parts, and service. Midway Ford is one of the largest volume Ford auto or truck dealers in the U.S.A.\n\nMidway U.S.A, Inc., d/b/a Midway Collision Center, is a majority-owned subsidiary of Midway Ford which operates a body, frame, front-end, and paint shop. This subsidiary is operated as a separate business, with the general manager having a minority ownership interest. It expanded its operations during 2005 by purchasing and moving to a newly refurbished location at 3420 Gardner in Kansas City, Missouri. This facility has incorporated state-of-the-art equipment to better serve the needs of the Collision Center's customers.\n\nMidway Management believes that honest relationships, quality products, services and business integrity practiced by Midway will bring long-term success. Midway people make the difference. Midway is proud of its mission statement which states: \"Our primary business purpose is to serve our customers so well that they remain loyal to Midway.\" We exceed customer expectations.\n\nMore About Midway Ford Truck Center | Commercial Ford Truck Dealer Serving Independence MO, Overland Park, Ottawa, and Olathe KS\n\nAt Midway Ford Truck Center, we offer a variety of new Ford trucks in Kansas City to our valued customers from all over Missouri.
