        "text": "This subseries contains the majority of the documents in the collection and is composed of business files, correspondence, and documents reflecting Milgram’s involvement in social causes and political activism. Business files range from general information about the state of housing in general and open housing in particular to material regarding the founding and daily operations of Milgram’s companies, among them Modern Community Developers, Planned Communities, Choice Communities, Fund for an Open Society, the Mutual Real Estate Investment Trust, Partners in Housing, and Affirmative Housing Associates. Office files also include documents about the development of his first three open housing communities: Greenbelt Knoll and Concord Park in the Northeast section of Philadelphia, and Princeton Associates in New Jersey.\n\nInformation about how Milgram funded his projects can be found in the financial reports, board meeting minutes, lists of prospective contributors (located in folders titled Lists, Key People, Pittsburgh Names), and numerous files tracking visits and contributions by individuals and organizations in different states.\n\nCorrespondence include not only letters to and from contributors but also names like Senator Joe Clark, Hubert Humphrey, and John Kennedy, President Dwight Eisenhower, and many others Milgram wrote to urging them to vote for bills that could benefit open housing. There are letters from and to organizations that supported open housing include the NAACP, Urban League, American Friends Service Committee, National Housing Conference, Jewish Community Relations Council, National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing, National Association of Intergroup Relations, and others. There is also correspondence between Milgram and such notables as A. Philip Randolph, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jackie Robinson, Adlai Stevenson, Kivie Kaplan and numerous lesser-known individuals whose financial and leadership support Milgram sought.\n\nAnother section of this series features newspaper articles, press releases, court documents, legal files, and a book titled But Not Next Door about the Deerfield case. In 1959 Progress Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Modern Community Developers, bought two subdivisions of land in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois for the purpose of building two integrated housing communities. Plans to build houses on these two sites met with no opposition until the Deerfield community learned that Progress Development Corporation intended to sell the houses on an integrated basis. The community sought to condemn the sites with the alleged intention of building a park even though efforts to build a park prior to November of 1959 had been rejected by the Deerfield community. Progress Development Corporation filed a formal complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that the actions of the Park Board deprived Progress of its civil rights to develop land and build and sell houses in Deerfield. The Park Board filed its own suit in the Circuit Court of Lake County seeking court authority to condemn the sites in question for park purposes, using the power of eminent domain. After a number of appeals, which required over three years of litigation, Progress Development Corporation lost its suit.\n\nMilgram collected documents about another legal case involving integrated housing. Starrett City was a housing development in Brooklyn, N.Y. whose developers had set out to create an integrated housing community in 1973 and attained this goal two years later. In 1979, however, civil rights organizations filed a class action suit against the developers on the charges of discrimination. At the time, white applicants secured apartments at quicker rate than Black applicants. This first suit settled out of court in 1984. Ultimately, a federal court found that Starrett City discriminated against minority applicants.\n\nMilgram also kept numerous files of all subscriptions of individuals investing in his companies. Although files about investments and contributions can be found throughout the General Files series, a portion of these files are concentrated in boxes containing documents about Modern Community Developers (MCD) and Planned Communities (PC). For financial support related to the Mutual Real Estate & Investment Trust (M-REIT), Milgram solicited investments from foundations and religious organizations. Documents related to these can be found in boxes labeled Religious Communities.\n\nPhysical Description\n\n134.9 Linear feet ; 337 boxes, 1 flat file"
