        "text": "Post by jjohnson on\n\nChapter 3: War Begins\n\nVirginia's Betrayal\n\nIn Virginia's secession convention, which ran from February into early April, the Unionists controlled the proceedings. Former President John Tyler opened the meeting on February 13th, while at the same time chairing the Virginia Peace Conference in DC, hoping to avoid war. On April 4th, delegates considered and rejected secession. But when news of Fort Sumter hit, and that the Union fired first, that galvanized the secessionists. The decisive event was Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the \"insurrection\" in the Lower South. Virginian Unionists viewed this act by Lincoln as a betrayal. All spring, they had negotiated in good faith with Republican officeholders and party leaders, and had received assurances that Fort Sumter would be given up, and the Lower South slowly drawn back into the Union. Instead, Lincoln's call for troops confirmed the worst fears of the secessionists, the very people whom the Unionists had been calling irresponsible for the last three months. Now, it was the Unionists who looked irresponsible, blind to the treachery of which a Republican administration was capable.\n\nThe Lynchburg Daily Virginian, a pro-Union newspaper until after the fall of Fort Sumter, characterized the anger of Unionists across the state of Virginia. On April 16, the editor resigned himself to joining the Confederacy along with his state. He wrote under the headline, \"The Feeling Yesterday,\" that \"Those who have fought valiantly for the Union admitted that they had been outraged and deceived by the Administration; whilst professions of peace and compromise were on their lips, they were taking active measures to conquer and perhaps subjugate the South.\"\n\nIf Lincoln had lied about Sumter, could he be lying about the purpose of the army too?\n\nA Unionist from North Carolina stated his case, \"We have created reasons to fall out with Lincoln than you secessionists. While we were watching and waiting he was undermining for our subjugation, but now we are for separation and against all sorts of compromise. Death or victory is our motto.\"\n\nJames B Dorman, a Unionist delegate from the upper Shenandoah Valley, wrote to his cousin, \"I have no idea that our people will tamely submit to Lincoln's arrogant and infamous usurpation of power, and to his diabolical purpose of waging war with a force of 50,000 Northern men against the Southern states. The issue is presented of a fight, and the question is simply 'which side are you on?'\"\n\nLee Makes His Decision\n\nColonel Lee wrote to his wife on the 23rd of January:\n\n\"I received Everett's Life of General Washington, which you sent me, and enjoyed its perusal. How his spirit would be grieved could he see the wreck of his mighty labors! I will not, however, permit myself to believe, until all the ground for hope has gone, that the fruit of his noble deeds will be destroyed and that his precious advice and virtuous example will so soon be forgotten by his countrymen.\n\nAs far as I can judge from the papers, we are between a state of anarchy and civil war. May God avert both of these evils from us! I fear that mankind for years will not be sufficiently Christianized to bear the absence of restraint and force. I See that four States have declared themselves out of the Union: four more will apparently follow their example. Then, if the Border States are brought into the gulf of revolution, one half of the country will be arrayed against the other. I must try and be patient and await the end, for I can do nothing to hasten or retard it.\"\n\nAnd to his son Fitzhugh on the 23rd of January about events back east, while he was in Fort Mason:\n\n\"The South, in my opinion, has been aggrieved by the acts of the North, as you say. I feel the aggression, and am willing to take every proper step for redress. It is the principle I contend for, not individual or private benefit.\"\n\n\"As an American citizen I take great pride in my country, her prosperity, and her institutions, and would defend any State if her rights were invaded. But I can anticipate no greater calamity for the country than a dissolution of the Union. It would be an accumulation of all the evils we complain of, and I am willing to sacrifice everything but honor for its preservation. I hope, therefore, that all constitutional means will be exhausted before there is a resort to force.\"\n\n\"Secession is nothing but revolution. The framers of our Constitution never exhausted so much labor, wisdom, and forbearance in its formation, and surrounded it with so many guards and securities, if it was intended to be broken by every member of the Confederacy at will. It was intended for 'perpetual union,' so expressed in the preamble, and for the establishment of a government, not a compact, which can only be dissolved by revolution or the consent of all the people in convention assembled.\"\n\n\"It is idle to talk of secession. Anarchy would have been established, and not a government, by Washington, Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison, and all the other patriots of the Revolution.\"\n\n\"...a Union that can only be maintained by swords and bayonets, and in which strife and civil war are to take the place of brotherly love and kindness, has no charm for me.\"\n\nIf Virginia secedes, he wrote, \"I shall mourn for my country and for the welfare and progress of mankind. If the Union is dissolved and the Government disrupted, I shall return to my native State and share the miseries of my people, and save in defence will draw my sword on none.\"\n\nAs can be seen from those excerpts, Lee was not in favor of secession, but intended to defend his native State if it came to that.\n\nBack in February, Colonel Robert E Lee was in Texas when he was summoned to Washington, DC. Since he was still an officer in the US Army, there was still a question on whether he would be arrested before he left the state. “Has it come so soon to this?” he sadly remarked to Mrs. Caroline Darrow, a unionist he had met while in San Antonio.\n\nLee made it out and made it to DC by March 1, still hoping that there would be a compromise that would keep Virginia in the Union. His father was Henry “Light Horse Harry” Lee, who fought with George Washington and reported directly to him; his house at Arlington had many artifacts of Washington’s, purchased by the Custis family over the years, which reinforced his identification with the father of the country.\n\nColonel Lee met with Winfield Scott for three hours on the 5th, expressing his unwillingness to fight against his own state. Scott, hoping Lee would stay with the Union, gave him holding orders to stay close by. Scott himself had been approached by delegates from Virginia to command its state military forces, but he refused; he resolved only to act in defense. Scott also detested Jefferson Davis, whom he called “a Judas who would not have sold the Savior for 30 shillings, but for the successorship to Pontius Pilate he would have betrayed Christ and the apostles and the whole Christian Church.”\n\nScott did offer Lee a promotion to colonel of the First US Cavalry, which he accepted on the 16th, but he later told his neighbors he might “resign and go plant corn.”\n\nOn the 17th of April, Virginia’s constitutional convention met in secret, and this time voted for secession. The next day, Lee was called to Washington again and formally offered the command of the Northern army by Francis P Blair, one of the Republican power brokers in the administration. The offer came directly from Abraham Lincoln. It would take two days, but after talking again to Scott, who told him he either had to resign or be prepared to follow any orders given to him. After another night of pacing and prayer, having received news that Virginia had seceded, Lee wrote his letter to Scott. His own family was divided – Custis and Rooney, his sons, spoke bitterly against secession, and his sister, Ann, married a Unionist.\n\nLee gave his letter to Scott,\n\nArlington, Washington City, P.O\n\n20 Apr 1861\n\nLt. Genl Winfield Scott\n\nCommd U.S. Army\n\nGeneral,\n\nSince my interview with you on the 18th Inst: I have felt that I ought not longer to retain any Commission in the Army. I therefore tender my resignation which I request you will recommend for acceptance. It would have been presented at once but for the struggle it has Cost me to separate myself from a Service to which I have devoted all the best years of my life, & all the ability I possessed. During the whole of that time, more than a quarter of a century, I have experienced nothing but kindness from my superiors & the most Cordial friendships from any Comrades. To no one Genl have I been as much indebted as to yourself for kindness & Consideration & it has always been my ardent desire to merit your approbation. I shall carry with me, to the grave the most grateful recollections of your kind Consideration, & your name & fame will always be dear to me. Save in the defense of my native state shall I ever again draw my sword. Be pleased to accept my most earnest wishes for the Continuance of your happiness & prosperity & believe me\n\nMost truly yours\n\nR E Lee\n\nOn the 23rd, Lee went to Richmond and was appointed command of the troops of Virginia by Governor John Letcher, which he accepted. John Janney, president of the Virginia Convention, presented Lee with his commission.\n\nLee replied:\n\n\"Deeply impressed with the solemnity of the occasion on which i appear before you, and profoundly grateful for the honour conferred upon me, I accept the position your partiality has assigned me, though I would greatly have preferred your choice should have fallen on one more capable.\n\nTrusting to Almighty God , an approving conscience, and the aid of my fellow-citizens, I will devote myself to the defense and service of my native State, in whose behalf alone would I have ever drawn my sword.\"\n\nSenators Weigh In\n\nDelaware Senator James Bayard gave a long, 3-day speech on the floor of the Senate on the prospects of war, and the legality of secession of the seven states that had already left the Union. He said:\n\nResolved by the Senate of the United States, that the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, has full power and authority to accept the declaration of the seceding States that they constitute hereafter an alien people, and to negotiate and conclude a treaty with \"the Confederate States of America\" acknowledging their independence as a separate nation; and that humanity and the principle avowed in the Declaration of Independence that the only just hosts of government is \"the consent of the governed,\" alike require that the otherwise inevitable alternative of civil war, with all its evils and devastation, should be thus avoided.\n\nSenator Bayard said that \"I believe the great value of the American Union...is the preservation of liberty - by which I mean a Government of laws, securing the right of free speech, securing the freedom of thought, and securing the free and ample discussion of any question.\"\n\nHe would go on to disagree with Lincoln and the coming war, for which he would be called a traitor in the press, hung in effigy in Philadelphia, threatened by mob violence, and has his mail searched and confiscated. He openly questioned the motivation for the war, and wondered how anyone could defend such a cause.\n\nHis son-in-law joined the Union Army a few months later, and he warned him, \"In embarking on this war therefore, you enlist in a war for invasion of another people. If successful it will devastate if not exterminate the Southern people and this is miscalled Union. If unsuccessful then peaceful separation must be the result after myriads of lives have been sacrificed, thousands of homes made desolate, and property depreciated to an incalculable extent. Why in the name of humanity can we not let those States go?\"\n\nLincoln Admits His Role\n\nOn May 1, a few weeks after Fort Sumter, President Lincoln wrote a letter to Fox. Fox's plan was admitted on 23 February:\n\n\"I simply propose three tugs, convoyed by light-draft men-of-war. ...The first tug to lead in empty, to open their fire.\"\n\nFox was disappointed their plan hadn't succeeded, but Lincoln wrote to him:\n\n\"I sincerely regret that the failure of the attempt to provision Fort Sumter should be the source of annoyance to you...\n\nYou and I both anticipated that the cause of the country would be advanced by making the attempt to provision Fort Sumter even if it should fail; and it is no small consolation now to feel that our anticipation is justified in the results.\"\n\nEven the Manchester Guardian in the UK saw through his ruse, and wrote: \"The only plausible explanation of President Lincoln's account (of the Battle of Fort Sumter) is that he has thought that a political object was to be obtained by putting the Southerners in the wrong, if they could be maneuvered into firing the first shot.\"\n\nMissouri Massacre (May 1861)\n\nThe local US Army garrison of St Louis was commanded by Captain Nathaniel Lyon of Connecticut. He was convinced that the federal arsenal was in danger of being seized by secessionists, so he ordered most of the arms stored there to be shipped over to Illinois. He then discovered evidence that the governor of the state was planning to smuggle artillery to the Lindell Grove militia encampment with the Confederates.\n\nLyon called the Missouri militiamen a \"body of rabid and violent opposers of the General Government,\" and \"a terror to all loyal and peaceful citizens.\" He decided to attack, but first augmented his regular army with German Unionist volunteers by permission of the War Department. Soon he commanded between 6,000-7,000 men, most without uniforms but armed. On the afternoon of May 10th, Lyon marched his force through the streets of St Louis to Lindell Grove, and surrounded Camp Jackson, demanding its surrender.\n\nBrigadier General Daniel Frist, who was in command of the militia who regularly drilled at Lindell Grove, was outnumbered roughly 8-to-1, and ordered his men to lay down their arms, confessing he was \"wholly unprepared to defend\" his command.\n\nAs Lyon was marching these 689 militia prisoners, a hostile crowd gathered to watch. They were marched through the streets as the Star Spangled Banner was played by a band leading them. By about 5:30 PM, outraged citizens were heckling the Germans and began throwing rocks, clods of dirt and other objects at them.\n\nOne German shot into the crowd, while others shot warning shots over the crowd's heads. But with that one shot, other Germans lowered their rifles and shot into the crowd, shooting civilians. Later, they would claim members of the crowd had pistols and returned fire, but when it was all over 28 civilians were dead in the streets, including 2 women and 4 children. Seventy-five others were wounded. Three of the militia prisoners were also killed, along with 2 soldiers.\n\nMore bloodshed occurred the next day on the 11th, as another German regiment was hastily recruited and armed, this time 10 civilians being killed along with 2 Germans. Over the next few days, about 10,000 civilians fled St. Louis.\n\nOne week after the St Louis Massacre, Lyon's superiors in Washington, DC promoted him from captain to Brigadier General. One of the delegates to Missouri's secession convention wondered now if he'd been wrong, saying, \"If Unionism means such atrocious deeds as I have witnessed in St. Louis, I am no longer a Union man.\"\n\nStatistics for the US and CS\n\n(as of July 1)\n\nConfederate States of America\n\nPopulation: 9,110,277\n\nWhite: 5,362,429\n\nFree Black: 134,039\n\nSlave: 3,613,809\n\nConfederate Army (Dec 31):\n\nPresent: 258,680\n\nAbsent: 68,088\n\nTotal: 326,768\n\nUnited States of America\n\nPopulation: 22,068,368\n\nWhite: 21,291,784\n\nFree Black: 343,923\n\nSlave: 432,661\n\nUnion Army (July 1):\n\nPresent: 183,588\n\nAbsent: 3,163\n\nTotal: 186,751\n\nBy January 1:\n\nPresent: 527,204\n\nAbsent: 48,713\n\nTotal: 575,917\n\nMaryland, My Maryland\n\nEarly in 1861, Maryland was caught between two sides, the Union and the Confederacy. It was culturally Southern, but its economy depended upon both North and South. Likewise, its people were divided between pro-Union and pro-Confederate, even in its legislature, which refused to take a side, reflecting the feeling of many Marylanders of wanting to be left alone.\n\nUnfortunately for them, the Federal Government had no question as to which side Maryland must take. If Maryland seceded, the Federal District would be surrounded, and it couldn't allow that. The situation came to a head when the soldiers of the 6th Massachusetts Volunteers moved through Baltimore towards Washington on April 19, 1861. They were attacked by a pro-Southern mob, which started shooting at the regiment, and the soldiers returned fire; when the smoke cleared, 4 soldiers and 12 civilians had been killed.\n\nTo avoid further riots, troops were sent through the Naval Academy at Annapolis. Lincoln sent General Benjamin Butler to secure the city on April 22. The same day, Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks called a special session of the General Assembly to discuss the crisis. It normally met biannually, but due to the situation and popular outcry, the governor felt it necessary to call them. He may have thought the anti-Union sentiment would run too high in a city now occupied by Northern troops, so the governor decided to convene in Frederick, Maryland, a pro-Union city.\n\nOn April 26, the General Assembly convened in the Frederick County Courthouse, but moved to Kemp Hall, the meeting hall of the German Reformed Church, which was big enough for them. A bill and a resolution were introduced calling for secession, but both failed because the legislators said they didn't have the authority to secede from the Union. Even many of the pro-Southern delegates and senators didn't support the bills. At the same time, the legislators refused to open the rail links again to the Northern States, because they feared they'd be used for military purposes and pro-Union agitators looking for revenge for the Baltimore riots.\n\nOne of the few things the General Assembly could agree on was a resolution protesting Lincoln's occupation of Maryland. The legislature seemed most concerned with preserving Maryland's neutrality, or feared what else the federal government might do; they neither wanted to secede, nor did they want to allow Union troops to cross their territory to attack the Confederacy.\n\nThe General Assembly adjourned August 7, intending to meet again September 17, but on that day, Federal troops and Baltimore police officers arrived in Frederick and arrested pro-Confederate members of the General Assembly.\n\nInsurrection\n\nAfter Fort Sumter, Lincoln issued a proclamation declaring an insurrection against the laws of the Untied States. He called for 75,000 volunteers with three-month enlistments to increase the regular army of 15,000, and later accepted an additional 40,000 three-year enlistees. His call to invade the south by force led directly to the secession of Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee.\n\nThousands of volunteers rushed to defend the capital, and Lt General Winfield Scott laid out his strategy to subdue the rebellion. He proposed an 80,000-man army sail down to capture New Orleans, and the Navy blockade southern ports in the east and the Gulf, a plan ridiculed in the press as the \"Anaconda Plan.\" Most believed that instead, capturing the capital of Richmond, only a hundred miles south of DC, would quickly end the war.\n\nBlack Confederates\n\nIn April, a company of sixty free blacks marched into Richmond, with a Confederate flag at the head of their column. Asking to join the repulse of the northern invader, they were complimented for their show of southern patriotism, and referred to Colonel Lee to join the defense of Virginia. Lee, who had before the war considered slavery a great evil, allowed them into Virginia's armed forces, as the state needed men to defend her. His example would be repeated many times by many other officers, though the official Confederate Army didn't allow blacks into the service at this point, but the various militias did. Blacks who then wore the gray uniform had placards in their hats which read \"We will die by the South.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, the Winston Salem People's Press reported in the summer of 1861: \"Fifteen free men of color left Monday morning for the mouth of Cape Fear, volunteers for the service of the State. They were in fine spirits and each wore a placard on his hat bearing the inscription, 'We will die by the South.'\"\n\nOn the 12th of March, two prominent North Carolinians, Stephen Collis and D.F. Edmond, asked the governor, John Ellis, to support the State and the Confederacy with black enlistment, saying they had \"been very strongly solicited by neighbors, friends, and citizens to raise a company of free mulatives as there is so many near...that is willing to turn out in behalf of our homes and friends,\" and then adding to that: \"There is a small place in about 10 miles of Florisville called Scuffletown settled with free mulattos. There can easily be three full companies raised in that place. They say they are willing to raise arms against our Yankee foe and guard our coast.\" Two all-black companies drilled at Fort Smith, Arkansas, despite not having weapons or uniforms. Across the river in Tennessee, a group of blacks formed a well-trained company in Nashville, offering their service to their home state of Tennessee.\n\nA few months later on the 15th of June, T.J. Minns wrote to Governor Ellis, that he could raise a company of 50 to 100 mulattos or free men of color, which the governor authorized for service within the state of North Carolina in the militias.\n\nIn Tennessee, one of the longest-lived soldiers would be \"Uncle\" Mack Dabney, who served with the 3rd Tennessee Regiment under General John C Brown.\n\nWilliam Johnson, a slave from Nolensville, TN would join the army in 1862 and drive wagons for General Forrest. Bill King would serve in the 20th Tennessee Regiment, and \"Uncle\" Jerry Perkins in the 31st Tennessee Infantry from Brownsville.op\n\nIn New Orleans, the Native Guards would go on to become one of the most famous groups of black Confederates to serve the South.\n\nElsewhere in the Confederacy, slaves who worked in town as blacksmiths, artisans, bakers, butchers, and otherwise made donations of some of the money they earned to the soldiers and the government to purchase arms to fight the 'Yankee invasion.' Others bought Confederate bonds or held bake sales, sold livestock , donated food, held balls and fairs, and sewed socks and flags.\n\nJames Chesnut, Jr., who would go on to serve as a Brigadier General during the war, and whose wife, Mary, composed a very famous diary of the family's experiences during the war, spoke to his black servants about enlisting in the Confederate military, and his wife wrote down that nearly all of them would be happy to serve if Mr. Chesnut would only free them and give them land; by 1864, he would do so.\n\nLincoln Suspends Habeas Corpus\n\nOn April 27, President Lincoln suspended habeas corpus in DC and Baltimore by executive order to the military. John Merryman and other people in Baltimore, including a number of police commissioners, were arrested. Justice in Baltimore was then carried out through military officials. When Judge William Giles of the US District Court for the District of Maryland issued a writ of habeas corpus, Major W.W. Morris of Fort McHenry wrote a reply refusing the writ. Merryman's lawyers appealed, and in June 1861, Chief Justice Roger Taney, writing as the US Circuit Court for Maryland, ruled in ex parte Merryman, that Article I, section 9 of the Constitution reserved to Congress (not the President), the power to suspend habeas corpus, and his suspension was thus invalid. President Lincoln's advisors said the circuit court's ruling was invalid and it was ignored.\n\nTaney's opinion included: \"These great and fundamental laws, which Congress itself could not suspend, have been disregarded and suspended, like the writ of habeas corpus, by a military order, supported by force of arms. Such is the case now before me, and I can only say that if the authority which the Constitution has confided to the judiciary department and judicial officers, may thus, upon any pretext or under any circumstances, be usurped by the military power, at its discretion, the people of the United States are no longer living under a government of laws, but every citizen holds life, liberty and property at the will and pleasure of the army officer in whose military district he may happen to be found.\"\n\nLincoln's response to Taney was to issue an arrest warrant for the Chief Justice for ruling against him, though the warrant was never served. It would play a part after thewar, however.\n\nBy July, when Congress was convened, they quickly passed an act declaring all Lincoln's unconstitutional actions valid and legal, so as to cover their bases and prevent another such issue from arising.\n\nAlbany Evening Journal (June 1, 1861)\n\nUp in New York, the newspaper the Albany Evening Journal editorialized about the common feeling in the North towards the South, after over twenty years of anti-South agitation:\n\n\"War is an expensive luxury...We shall come out of the present struggle impoverished in many ways. With the best success, we shall expend hundreds of millions of treasures and sacrifice thousands of lives. We shall feel the bruises of the conflict for years after the rebellion has been crushed and peace has been restored.\n\nWill it pay the cost? Yes - a hundred - a thousand fold - if we come out of the struggle conquerors! If we succeed in crushing out this miserable rebellion - if we exterminate the fatal heresy of Secession - if we shall succeed in convincing the world that we have a Government, strong enough, vigorous enough, determined enough, to overcome all combinations and attacks, whether from conspiracies within or invasions from without; if we shall be able to impress Christendom with the conviction that our Western Empire is built upon a rock, which no convulsion can shake, and no tempests undermine.\n\nThe successful termination of the war will be the dawn of a new era in the history of the country. The Republic will enter upon a new stage of its career.\"\n\nNotice the word choice of the New York newspaper - \"conquerors\" - the meaning of which shows that their war was rather to vanquish the South, not the kinder 'save the Union' or 'free the slaves.' Conquering is what you do to an enemy, to subjugate them, not to preserve the Union or defend the Constitution. Calling the seceded States as engaging in a \"miserable rebellion\" showed that newspapers up north were providing a psychological excuse for the hate crimes and war crimes to come against not just southern military personnel, but also southern civilians as well.\n\nOne northern Senator around the same time expressed his view of Southerners: \"The great majority [of Southerners] are deplorably ignorant...It is this ignorance that enables the rebel leaders to create a prejudice in the minds of this class.\" By calling Southerners ignorant and barbarians, the demonization of part of the country shows to have worked.\n\nTennessee\n\nGovernor Isham Harris signed a bill passed by the legislature to receive into service all black men, 15 to 50, to be paid $18/month and the same rations and clothing as white soldiers. By September, two regiments would report to Memphis.\n\nThe Fight Begins at Big Bethel (June 10, 1861)\n\nUnder the command of Major General Benjamin Butler, 5,000 Union troops advanced towards Fort Monroe in early June, a fort which could serve as the springboard for further advances into Virginia. On the way, a Virginian asked as they passed by, what right they had to invade Virginia's \"sacred soil,\" to which the commander replied, \"By God, sir, might makes right.\"\n\nThe Confederates sent Colonel John Magruder to the peninsula to deter any advance on the capital at Richmond from Fort Monroe. His forces established two camps - Big Bethel and Little Bethel - to lure Butler into acting prematurely. Both were in range of the Union lines, and Butler took the bait. He came up with a plan to attack at dawn on June 10th. He chose not to lead his troops personally, and his plan was too complex for his poorly trained subordinates to carry out, especially at night; his forces also neglected to give out the appropriate passwords, all of which would hinder the operation's success.\n\nAs the Union troops advanced in the night, a friendly fire incident gave away their position. The small force of 50 Confederates at Little Bethel fell back to the entrenchments at Marsh Creek, which Butler thought was the main entrenchment. The 5th NY Infantry found the Confederates fleeing, and burned the church at Little Bethel, set fire to the homes of several civilians who happened to be secessionists, and continued on to Big Bethel. Coincidentally, Magruder had left most of his forces at Big Bethel, and started his own march towards Hampton to begin his surprise attack. He heard gunfire, and was alerted by an elderly local lady that the Union forces were just a few hundred yards down the road. With that warning, the Confederates could place themselves into defensive position well before the Union arrived.\n\nNearly the entire Confederate force was now stationed behind earthworks, just north of Marsh Creek, a branch of the Back River. Some of the 3rd Virginia Infantry were in an open field to the south to protect a howitzer position they hoped to use to block the main road between Yorktown and Hampton. They hurried to entrench, trying to find cover as the Union forces approached. Colonel D.H. Hill's 1st North Carolina Volunteer Infantry of about 800 men, along with 3 companies of Lt. Col. William Stuart's 3rd Virginia Infantry (208 men), a cavalry battalion with around 100 men under Major E.B. Montague, and the Richmond Howitzer artillery battalion of around 150 men under Major George Randolph, along with a number of free blacks who were acting in various support capacities, faced the arriving Union forces of the 5th and 7th New York Infantries under Duryee and Bendix, respectively, along with the Massachusetts and Vermont companies under Washburn. There were 3500 to 1400 Confederates, a numerical disparity that would exist in almost every battle of the war until the end.\n\nButler's Union forces continued to Big Bethel without any knowledge of the layout or strength of the positions of their Confederate opposition. The 5th New York Infantry left first, then returned, after observation, and talking to a local black man and woman, who told them there were roughly 3000 to 5000 Confederates and 30 artillery. As the Union forces entered the field, they could not see the Confederates from their fortifications, and the Confederates could not see the Union forces due to the shade of the woods and buildings to the left. Despite this, the Confederates were able to see the bayonets and the flag of a Union force a half mile to the left. Major Randolph, the officer in charge of the Howitzer Battalion, fired a shot into this column, which ricocheted through the Union line and killed a soldier who was standing next to Colonel Bendix.\n\nThe real fight began about 9 AM, continuing until around 1:30 PM. Bendix's men scattered into the trees for protection after the first shot of artillery. The 5th New York Infantry under Colonel Duryee charged left to try to turn the Confederates' flank, but were repulsed by heavy Confederate fire. Union Lt. Greble came up the road to place his three guns where he and some regulars from the 2nd US Artillery Regiment could return fire, but this had little effect; despite that, they handled themselves well. U.S. General Pierce then positioned the 5th and 7th New York, along with the Massachusetts and Vermont Companies to the right of the Hampton Road, and the 3rd and 1st New York to the left of the road, to launch piecemeal attacks from those positions. Greble continued firing at the Confederates to try to give Pierce time to arrange his forces and give them some time to rest.\n\nUnion skirmishers tried testing the strength of the Confederates, but most of them were driven back immediately. The two forces fought back and forth, with the Union continuing to test the Confederates. Captain Judson Kilpatrick, later a Brigadier General, was shot in the leg as he tried to lead part of the 5th New York around the Confederates, and was almost captured after the battle was over.\n\nWith Kilpatrick injured, Major Winthrop, an officer from the 7th New York Infantry replaced him in leading a detachment of troops from the 5th New York, 1st Vermont, and 4th Massachusetts. Though they were all tired from the night march and the increasingly hot day, Winthrop tried to turn the Confederate left flank from the Union right. Union troops made it across the creek uncontested because they tied white cloths around their hats and pretended to be part of the Confederate force. Unfortunately, they cheered and ran forward, giving away their identity prematurely. Two companies of the 1st North Carolina Infantry turned to face them, turning the Union forces back. One was Major Winthrop, who jumped on a log, and yelled, \"Come on boys, one charge and the day is ours!\"\n\nThose were his last words, as a black servant of Captain Ashe, Co. D, 1st North Carolina Infantry by the name of Samuel, shot him through the heart. Later, Sam would be granted a $100 bounty for killing the Union officer by the governor of Virginia. The governor would take this as a sign, and would allow units in Virginia to arm free blacks to defend the state, despite the official government's policy of not arming blacks, and placing them in the militias.\n\nAdvanced Union skirmishers continued firing at Confederate positions; Col. Hill asked 4 volunteers to go forward to burn the house whence they fired. Fire from across the road stopped them, and they dove to the ground. Union Private Henry L. Wyatt was killed. The others were called back, and Major Randolph destroyed the house with artillery fire. Lt Greble, whose guns had been hidden by the house, exposed his position by continuing to fire. By this time the battle was ending, and Pierce ordered his forces to retreat, since the Confederate position was too strong and his troops were too exhausted to continue the increasingly futile attack. Greble remained, continuing to work his remaining gun, which cost him his life as the Confederates concentrated on his position.\n\nWhen they got word of Greble's death, Lt Col. Warren, Capt. Wilson, and five others rushed to recover his body. Greble was the first graduate of West Point, and the first regular US army officer killed in the war. After littering the road with coats and equipment on the way back to Fort Monroe, they arrived about 5 PM that afternoon. Around 100 Confederate cavalry pursued them, but couldn't mount an attack, and pulled back as they approached Hampton since the Union had pulled up the New Market Bridge.\n\nThe Union forces lost 89: 55 wounded, 8 MIA, and 23 killed. The Confederates lost 12: 2 killed, 10 wounded.\n\nPresident Tyler Joins the Confederacy\n\nPresident Tyler, now Representative Tyler\n\nUS President Tyler signed on June 14th the Virginia Secession Ordinance, and was elected to the Provisional Confederate Congress a week later, being seated August 1st, 1861.\n\nLincoln Addresses Congress\n\nHaving conspired to start a war that he initially believed to be quick, Lincoln called Congress into session several months later so they couldn't stop a war he had already started. He knew his actions of sending warship was a provocation to war, that calling up the militia to invade states was unconstitutional, and his arresting opponents of the war was against the Bill of Rights.\n\nBut in his address, he said: \"These measures, whether strictly legal or not, were ventured upon, under what appeared to be a popular demand and a public necessity; trusting then, as now, that Congress would readily ratify them.\"\n\nBlack Support for the Confederates\n\nDuring the summer of 1861, a black Georgian by the name of Thomas \"Blind Tom\" Wiggins, a talented and quite popular musician, began to give free concerts for the injured and sick soldiers from his home State. Over in Memphis, Tennessee, a black man volunteered to outfit himself for war and go fight Lincoln's army, his only condition being that his family and home be protected while he was off to war. In Nashville, a group of blacks formed their own well-trained company, and offered their services to the Confederate government for the war effort. Shortly after the intrigue at Fort Sumter, 60 blacks showed up in Richmond, VA, requesting to enlist.\n\nOn the 4th of July, one of several thousand blacks who were in the army, despite the official ban on their being armed, Thomas A. Phelps, wrote home to his mother from Virginia:\n\nI take this opportunity of writing to you to let you know that I am well and doing well, and I hope that this letter will find you as well as I am now in Yorktown. I will leave at 4 o' clock p. m. today for a scout about the woods for the Yankees... We are looking out for a fight on the 5th of July by the 5th Regiment Louisiana volunteers. Give my love to Mistress and Master Jim Phelps, and to all of them in New Orleans. You must excuse this bad writing. I am writing in a hurry; have not time to write. I am about to leave for the Mill. So good by all. No more at present.\n\nYour devoted son, THOMAS A PHELPS\n\nP. S. - Good by to the white folks until I kill a Yankee.\n\nVallandigham Admits the Real Reason for War (July 10)\n\nOn July 10, speaking in the House of Representatives, Clement Vallandigham (OH), the vocal congressman admitted the \"secret\" Yankee economic motivation for the war on the South:\n\n...the Confederate Congress adopted our old tariff of 1857...fixing their rate of duties at five, fifteen, and twenty percent lower than ours. The result was...trade and commerce...began to look to the South ... Threatened thus with the loss of both political power and wealth...both New England - and Pennsylvania ... demanded, now, coercion and civil war, with all its horrors... The subjugation of the South, and the closing up of her ports - first, by force, in war, and afterward, by tariff laws, in peace, was deliberately resolved upon by the East.\n\nThis was just one of many examples exposing the truth of the northern motivation for war - money and power. It had no great moral justification. It was just the same old motivation as most wars against independence.\n\nJoining in the condemnation of the war in the Senate, Senator Bayard of Delaware gave a speech called \"Executive Usurpation,\" criticizing the Lincoln administration and lamenting the loss of liberty so early in the war. He said:\n\nMr. President, there is no other distinction between the condition of France under Louis XIY and present condition of these United States, if this resolution be passed. The Bastille had its dungeons ; the forts have none. Louis XIY alone issued his letters de cachet ; but the President of the United States delegates a general power to one or ten\n\ndifferent officers to arrest and imprison guiltless men, whenever the officer chooses to suspect them of criminal complicity, and all this is to be sanctioned and continued in the face of a Constitution which we had supposed gave us, as citizens of a free country, free institutions, in contradistinction to the absolutism which reigned in France under Louis XIY.\n\nArdent as may be a man's views in favor of this war, harshly as he may think of the rebels, and determined as he may be to prosecute it to its utmost extent, until the South unconditionally submits, if he cherishes the principles of civil liberty, he cannot sustain this action of the President which violates the laws of the land, and abolishes all security for personal liberty to every citizen throughout what are called the loyal States, while it conduces, not in the slightest degree, to the subjugation or submission of the South. It touches not you now, who support and advocate the course and measures of existing power, but touches only those who are opposed to these measures ; but by your approval, you take the first step for the subversion of a republican form of government, and it is the first step only which costs. The future progress toward absolutism will be rapid...\n\nMr. President, human nature is the same in all ages and in all countries. Power always tends to corruption, and especially when concentrated in a single person.\n\nBattle of First Manassas (July 18-21)\n\nThe First Battle of Manassas (the name used in the CSA, British Commonwealth, German Confederation, and most of the world) or the First Battle of Bull Run (the name used by the USA, Vietnam, Indonesia, and a handful of other countries) was the first major battle of the War for Southern Independence, which took place on the 21st of July in Virginia, just north of Manassas in Virginia, about 25 miles west-southwest of the federal capital at Washington, DC.\n\nAgainst the advice of his generals which told him the Union forces weren't ready for battle, President Lincoln authorized an attack on the Confederates at Manassas Junction in late June. His 75,000 troops were volunteers for 3 months, so they were expected to fight before the expiration of their enlistments. Congress called for another 500,000 volunteers for three-year enlistments, but the patriotic fervor which drew the recruits to Washington would soon fade if the Union didn't strike soon.\n\nBoth sides in the fight were inexperienced. Union Brigadier General McDowell led his green army across Bull Run (the river name) against the similarly inexperienced Confederate Army under Brigadier General P.G.T. Beauregard, whose army was camped near Manassas Junction. McDowell had an ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederates' left, but it would be poorly executed. On the other side, the Confederates were planning to attack the Union's left flank also, but would find themselves at a disadvantage as well.\n\nUnion forces marched slowly for two days, with troops stopping to pick apples or blackberries, or to get water, despite their officers trying to keep them in formation. After two days, they stopped at Centreville for rest. McDowell send 5,000 troops under Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon to guard the rear. General McDowell was eager to start the fight quickly, because in a few days, he would lose thousands of soldiers whose 90-day enlistments would soon expire. The very next morning, two units whose enlistments expired that day would turn back to Washington, DC, to be mustered out of service, despite pleas from their superiors to stay and despite the sounds of battle. He also heard intelligence that reinforcements under Johnston would be coming soon from the Shenandoah Valley. Becoming more frustrated, the Union commander resolved to attack the Confederate left flank.\n\nOn the Union side, McDowell planned to use Brigadier General Daniel Tyler's 1st Division at Stone Bridge, and send the two divisions of Brigadier Generals David Hunter and Samuel Heintzelman over Sudley Springs Ford. From there, those two would march into the Confederate rear. From Tyler's division, Colonel Israel Richardson's brigade would harass the Confederates at Blackburn's Ford, to prevent them from thwarting the attack. Patterson would successfully tie down Johnston in the Shenandoah to prevent reinforcements for a short time. The plan overall was sound, but had a number of flaws - it required the synchronized execution of troop movements and attacks in a very inexperienced army, and relied on Patterson to take actions he had already failed to take, and McDowell delayed long enough that Johnston was able to reach the train station to reinforce Beauregard's men.\n\nOn the morning of July 21, McDowell send Hunter and Heintzelman's divisions of 12,000 men from Centreville at 2:30 AM, marching southwest at the Warrenton Turnpike, then turning northwest toward Sudley Springs. Tyler's division with 8000 men marched directly toward Stone Bridge. The units immediately developed logistical problems, with Tyler's division blocking the advance of the main flanking column on the turnpike; later Union units found the roads which approached Sudley Springs inadequate, little more than cart paths in some places, and did not begin fording the Bull Run till about 9:30 AM; Tyler's men reached Stone Bridge around 6 AM.\n\nAt 5:15 AM, Richardson's Union brigade fired a few artillery rounds across Mitchell's Fort on the Confederate right, some of which hit Beauregard's headquarters at the Wilmer McLean house while he was eating breakfast, letting him know his offensive battle plan had been preempted.\n\nBeauregard ordered demonstration attacks north, toward the Union left at Centreville. Bungled orders and poor communication prevented his orders from being executed. Though he meant for Brig. Gen Richard Ewell to lead the attack, he was ordered instead to simply hold at Union Mills Ford to be ready. Brigadier General D.R. Jones was supposed to attack in support of fellow Confederate General Ewell, but found his forces moving forward alone. Major General Holmes was also supposed to support them, but got no orders at all.\n\nThe Confederates only had Col. Nathan Evans and his reduced brigade of 1100 men to stand in the path of 20,000 Union soldiers. He began suspecting the weak attacks were feints, and hastily let 900 men from their position on Stone Bridge move to a new location located on the slopes of a place called \"Matthews Hill,\" northwest of his previous position. The delaying action on Matthews Hill included a spoiling attack by Major Roberdeau Wheat's 1st LA Special Battalion, \"Wheat's Tigers.\" Wheat was seriously wounded and his command was thrown back, Evans got reinforcement from two other brigades under Confederate Brig. Gen. Barnard Bee (3rd Brigade) and Col. Francis Bartow (2nd Brigade), bringing his force to 2800 men. They slowed Hunter's brigade (under Burnside) successfully, in its attempts to ford the river at Bull Run. Col William Sherman crossed at an unguarded ford, and struck the right flank of the Confederates defending there; coupled with pressure from Burnside and Major George Sykes, the Confederate line collapsed a little past 11:30 AM, sending them into a disorderly retreat to Henry House Hill.\n\nAs they retreated from their position on Matthews Hill, the remnant of Evans's, Bee's, and Bartow's command received some cover from Captain John Imboden and his battery of four 6-lb guns, holding off the advance of the Union troops, while the Confederates made their attempt to regroup at Henry House. They were met by Generals Johnston and Beauregard, who had just arrived from Johnston's HQ at Lewis Farm. Luckily for the Confederates, Union General McDowell did not press his tactical advantage by attempting to seize the strategic ground immediately, choosing instead to bombard the hill with the batteries of Capts. James Ricketts and Charles Griffin from Dogan's Ridge.\n\nBrig. Gen. Thomas Jackson's Virginia Brigade arrived in support of the disorganized Confederate forces around noon, with Col. JEB Stuart's cavalry and Col. Wade Hampton and his Hampton's Legion. The Legion, about 600-men strong, bought Jackson enough time for his brigade to build a defensive line on Henry House Hill, firing repeated volleys at Sherman's brigade, one of which nearly killed Sherman, missing by about ten feet. Hampton had given his troops about 400 British Enfield rifles for his men, and brought in several sharpshooters to help take the field, including several who had fought at Big Bethel. The 79th NY was decimated by Hampton's musket fire, and began disintegrating. Hampton gestured towards the Union colonel, James Cameron, and remarked, \"Look at that brave officer, trying to lead his men and they won't follow him.\" Moments later, the colonel was fatally wounded; his brother, US Senator Simon Cameron, would receive notice within a week. Later, Union officials claimed Hampton deliberately targeted the officers on the 79th NY in revenge for his nephew's death earlier that day, though he had been killed by soldiers in the 69th NY.\n\nBrig. Gen. Jackson posted his five regiments on the reverse slope of the hill, shielding them from direct fire, allowing them to assemble 13 guns for a defensive line, which he posted on the crest of the hill. As the guns fired, their recoil acted to move them down the reverse slope, where they could be safely reloaded. Meanwhile, Union commander McDowell ordered the batteries of Griffin and Ricketts to move from Dogan's Ridge to the hill for close infantry support. Their 11 guns engaged in an artillery duel over 300 yards with Jackson's 13. Being at such close range, the Union rifled pieces were not as effective at close range as the Confederate smoothbores, with many of the Union shots firing over the heads of their targets.\n\nOne of the unfortunate casualties of the artillery fire was Judith Carter Henry, and 85-year-old widow and invalid, who was unable to leave her bedroom in the Henry House. As Ricketts began receiving rifle fire, he believed it was coming from Henry House, and fired at it. A shell crashed through the bedroom wall, tearing off one of her feed, and inflicting multiple injuries, from which he died later that day.\n\n\"The Enemy are driving us,\" Bee said to Jackson. Jackson, former U.S. Army officer VMI professor is said to have replied through a fierce grin with clenched teeth, \"Then, Sir, we will give them the bayonet.\" Bee exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting, \"There is Jackson standing like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians.\" This exclamation was the source for Jackson's (and his brigade's) nickname, \"Stonewall\". Bee was shot through the stomach shortly after speaking and died the next day, so it is unclear exactly what he meant. Col. States Rights Gist (yes, that was his real name), serving as Bee's aide-de-camp, took command of the brigade.\n\nThe commander of the Union Artillery, Griffin, decided he needed to move two of his guns to the southern end of his line, hoping this to provide enfilade fire against the Confederates. About 3 PM, they were overrun by the 33rd Virginia Infantry, whose soldiers were outfitted in blue uniforms, which caused Griffin's commander, Major William Barry, to mistake them for Union troops and to order Griffin not to fire on them. Close range fire from the 33rd Virginia and Stuart's cavalry against the flank of the 11th NY Volunteer Infantry Regiment (aka Ellsworth's Fire Zouaves), which was supporting the Union battery, killed many of the Union gunners and scattered the blue-coated infantry. Capitalizing on his success, Jackson ordered two of his regiments to charge Rickett's guns, and captured them as well.\n\nThis proved to be the event that turned the battle, the Confederate capture of the Union guns. Although McDowell brought 15 regiments into the fight the Confederates on the hill, outnumbering them 2-to-1, no more than two ever engaged simultaneously. Confederate Gen. Jackson continued to press their attacks, telling his soldiers of the 4th VA Infantry, \"Reserve your fire until they come within 50 yards! Then fire and give them the bayonet! And when you charge, yell like furies!!\"\n\nFor the first time, Union troops heard the disturbing, chilling sound of the Rebel Yell. About 4 PM, the final Union troops were pushed off Henry House Hill by charge of two regiments from Colonel Philip St George Cocke's brigade. The yell would spread throughout the Confederate armies.\n\nTo the west, Chinn Ridge had been occupied by Confederate Colonel Oliver Otis Howard's brigade, from Heintzelman's division. Also at about 4 PM, two Confederate Brigades, Col. Jubal Early's, moving from the Confederate right, and Brig. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith's (commanded by Col Arnold Elzey after Smith was wounded), having just arrived from the Shenandoah, crushed Howard's brigade. Beauregard ordered his entire line forward. At 5 PM, all along the battlefield McDowell's army was disintegrating. Thousands of Union troops, in large or small groups, or as individuals, began to leave the battlefield, heading for Centreville. McDowell tried to rally regiments and groups of soldiers by riding the battlefield, but most had had enough. Being unable to stop the mass exodus of his troops, McDowell gave orders for Porter's regular infantry battalion, near the turnpike and Manassas-Sudley Road intersection, to act as a rear guard to protect the soldiers as his army withdrew. The Union unit briefly held the crossroads, then retreated eastward with the rest of the army. McDowell's force crumbled and began to retreat.\n\nUnion Forces: 36,000\n\nCommand: Brigadier General Irvin McDowell\n\nCasualties and Losses:\n\n-killed: 642\n\n-wounded: 1,164\n\n-missing: 1291\n\nConfederate Forces:\n\nArmy of the Potomac: 22,000\n\nCommand: Brigadier P.G.T. Beauregard\n\nArmy of the Shenandoah: 10,000\n\nCommand: General Joseph E. Johnston\n\nCasualties and Losses:\n\n-killed: 396\n\n-wounded: 1621\n\n-missing: 15\n\nAftermath\n\nThe Union feared the Confederates would march on DC, but the rebels would fail to take advantage of their early chance to do so and thus force an early end to the war. The reaction in the north was shock that their army was defeated when they had been expecting an easy victory. The very next day, Lincoln signed a bill which would provide for enlisting another 500,000 soldiers for up to 3 years of service. On July 25th, 11,000 Pennsylvanians who had earlier been rejected for federal service arrived in DC and were accepted.\n\nMcDowell bore the chief blame in the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War in Congress, and he was replaced by Maj. Gen. George McClellan.\n\nIn the Confederacy, the reaction was more muted. There was little public celebration as they realized there would be more battles to come and more losses. Once the short euphoria of victory wore off, President Jefferson Davis called for another 400,000 volunteers. Beauregard was promoted to full general, as the hero of the battle. Stonewall Jackson, who was the most important tactical contributor to the victory, got no special recognition at the moment. Davis privately credited Greenhow with their victory. The victory managed to give the Confederates an esprit de corps that gave them the morale to continue their fight, while it gave a new sense of insecurity in northern commanders, but did prompt the north to make a more determined organizational effort to win the war.\n\nLincoln Explains his Arresting the Police\n\nOn the 27th of July, Lincoln was asked by the US House of Representatives to explain his actions in arresting police commissioners of Baltimore in violation of the law, and then jailing them illegally. The President replied:\n\n\"In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 24th instant asking the grounds, reason, and evidence upon which the police commissioners of Baltimore were arrested and are now detained as prisoners at Fort McHenry, I have to state that it is judged to be incompatible with the public interest at this time to furnish the information called for by the resolution.\" In other words, Lincoln refused to explain why he disobeyed the law.\n\nThe Purpose of the War\n\nIn the North, abolitionists, who were at this time just a vocal minority and well-hated by many in the North, were impatient with Lincoln and the war. One, Reverend Charles Edward Lester, expressed his impatience with Lincoln after the President countermanded and revoked the emancipation of slaves in Missouri, notably an angry reversal. The President told him: \"I think Sumner, and the rest of you, would upset our apple-cart altogether, if you had your way...We didn't go into the war to put down Slavery, but to put the flag back, and to act differently at this moment, would, I have no doubt, not only weaken our cause, but smack of bad faith; for I never should have had votes enough to send me here, if the people had supposed I should try to use my power to upset Slavery. Why, the first thing you'd see, would be a mutiny in the army. No! We must wait until every other means has been exhausted. This thunderbolt will keep.\"\n\nIncoming Aid\n\nThe first ships begin to return to the nascent Confederacy, slipping past the shoddy Union blockade, bringing foods, medicines, guns, munitions, blankets, boots, and also consumer goods, keeping the economy afloat and keeping gold and silver in circulation, helping to prevent inflation in the new Confederate dollar.\n\nNOTE: Lee's words are public record, and are not my own. The words in quotes are also public record. Information on black Confederates came from \"Forgotten Confederates\" and \"Black Confederates\" amongst other books. Information on Mack Dabney is easily found with a Bing search.\n\nPost by jjohnson on\n\nChapter 4: The War Continues\n\nCitizen Arrests\n\nAside from members of the Maryland legislature, Lincoln ordered the arrest of the mayor of Baltimore, the police commissioners, the marshal of the police, and a number of private citizens, without warrant.\n\nOn the morning of September 13, Francis Key Howard, grandson of Francis Scott Key, was also imprisoned within Fort McHenry. He found newspaper publishers, legislators, and other prominent citizens. He wrote:\n\n\"When I looked out in the morning, I could not help but being struck by an odd and not pleasant coincidence. On that day, forty-seven years before, my grandfather, Mr. F. S. Key, then a prisoner on a British ship, witnessed the bombardment of Fort McHenry. When, on the following morning, the hostile fleet drew off, defeated, he wrote the song so long popular throughout our country, the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\" As I stood upon the very scene of that conflict, I could not but contrast my position with his, forty-seven years before. The flag which he had then so proudly hailed, I saw waving, at the same place, over the victims of as vulgar and brutal a despotism as modern times have witnessed.\"\n\nHoward stayed imprisoned for fourteen months, refusing early release, because that release was based on accepting the government's charge that they were criminals.\n\nHe continued on American abuse of civil rights:\n\n\"To have imprisoned men solely on account of their political opinions, is enough to bring eternal infamy on every individual connected with the Administration; but the manner in which we have been treated since our confinement, is, if possible, even more disgraceful to them. I should have supposed that, if the Government chose to confine citizens because their sentiments were distasteful to it, it would have contented itself with keeping them in custody, but would have put them in tolerably comfortable quarters...If I had been told, twelve months ago, that the American people would ever have permitted their rulers, under any pretense whatever, to establish such a despotism as I have witnessed, I should have indignantly denied the assertion; and if I had been told that the officers of the Army would ever consent to be the instruments to carry out the behest of a vulgar dictator, I should have predicted that they would rather have stripped their epaulets from their shoulders. But we live to learn; and I have learned much in the past few months.\"\n\nHoward was deprived of legal counsel, as Secretary of State Seward wrote to tell them:\n\n\"I am instructed, by the Secretary of State, to inform you, that the Department of State, of the United States, will not recognize any one as an attorney for political prisoners, and will look with distrust upon all applications for release through such channels; and that such applications will be regarded as additional reasons for declining to release the prisoners.\"\n\nAs Howard stated, bring held without the benefit of legal counsel:\n\n\"Each...had determined at the outset to resist, to the uttermost, the dictatorship of Abraham Lincoln...We came out of prison as we had gone in, holding in the same just scorn and detestation the despotism under which the country was prostrate, and with a stronger resolution than ever to oppose it by every means to which, as American freemen, we had the right to resort.\"\n\nWhy The War Needed to Be Fought\n\nRobert Ingersoll, who was a free thinker (a near atheist), radical Republican, radical abolitionist, became a colonel in the 11th Illinois Cavalry during the 'Civil War' as some in the north called it. When asked why the north needed to fight the war, he said, \"The great stumbling block, the great obstruction in Lincoln's way and in the way of thousands, was the old doctrine of States Rights.\" No moralizing about the need to abolish slavery, just the idea that states could stand in the way of the government in Washington, DC.\n\nA Contrary New Yorker\n\nUp in the city of New York, a black man named John Jones spoke up in October before a large crowd of his \"undying support\" for the Confederacy, for which he was quickly arrested and silenced. He would go on to be labeled 'mad' and fit for the insane asylum. In 1865, near the end of the war, he would be deported to Virginia, and given the Davis Medal.\n\nIndian Territory\n\nLike much of the country, opinion was divided in the Indian Territory. Many Indians held slaves - other Indians and blacks. After refusing to allow Creek lands to be annexed by the Confederacy, the Creek Principal Chief Opothleyahola led Creek Union supporters to Kansas, having to fight along the way. Leaders from each of the Five Civilized Tribes, acting without the consensus of their councils, agreed to be annexed to the Confederacy in exchange for certain rights: (a) full citizenship; (b) statehood and representation equal to the other states; (c) protection of and recognition of current tribal lands; (d) officer and enlisted promoted and paid and equipped same as to whites. The negotiations took most of June and July of 1861, and were held up in the Confederate Congress till August, when a treaty between the tribes and the Confederate States were finally agreed to, and the state constitution was finally written and agreed to by October, as the state of Sequoyah, but when passed by Congress, became Oklahoma, the second choice of the Indians, as the Congress didn't want to name a state for a person at this point in time. Oklahoma became a state December 12.\n\nAfter he reached Kansas and Missouri, Opothleyahola and the other Indians loyal to the Union formed three volunteer regiments known as the Indian Home Guard, which fought in Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\nEmancipation Delay\n\nGeneral John Fremont issued his own emancipation proclamation on the 30th of August in St Louis, Missouri, placing the state in martial law, and decreeing the confiscation of all those in rebellion, including slaves.\n\nWhen Lincoln discovered this, he sent an angry letter on the 2nd of September, noting to the general that liberating the slaves would interfere with his political goal of trying to force Kentucky to stay in the Union: \"I think there is great danger that...the confiscation of property and the liberating of slaves of traitorous owners, will alarm our Southern Union friends and turn them against us; perhaps ruin our rather fair prospect for Kentucky.\"\n\nA number of Lincoln's constituents noted his anti-abolition moves, and one of his oldest friends, Senator from Illinois Orville Hickman Browning wrote him a letter, questioning his countermanding of Fremont's emancipation proclamation. Lincoln replied sharply on the 22nd of September: \"My dear Sir: Yours of the 17th is just received: and coming from you, I confess it astonishes me...General Fremont's proclamation as to confiscation of property and the liberation of slaves is purely political and not within the range of military law or necessity.\"\n\nKentucky's Neutrality Violated\n\nOn the 4th of September, Union Brigadier General Ulysses Grant left Cairo Illinois, and entered Paducah, Kentucky, and occupied the town, which gave the Union control of the northern end of the New Orleans and Ohio Railroad. Troops were somewhat uncontrolled, and several incidents occurred which soured the locals on the Union troops and their occupation, and swayed opinions of the General Assembly.\n\nIn response to the Union invasion, on the 6th, Confederate Major General Leonidas Polk then violated the Commonwealth's neutrality by ordering Brig. Gen. Gideon Johnson Pillow to occupy Columbus, which was also of strategic importance both because it was the end of the Mobile/Ohio Railroad, and its position along the Mississippi River. Polk constructed Fort DuRussey on the high bluffs of Columbus, equipping it with 143 guns, calling it the \"Gibralter of the West.\" He stretched an anchor chain across the river to control traffic, but it soon broke under its own weight, which the Union wouldn't find out till early 1862.\n\nGovernor Magaoffin denounced both sides for violating their neutrality, calling for both sides to withdraw. But, on September 7, the General Assembly passed a resolution ordering the withdrawal of only Union Forces, which came first. Magoffin vetoed the resolution, but it was overridden by both houses. Then the General Assembly ordered the flag of the Confederate States to be raised over the state capitol in Frankfort, declaring its allegiance to the Confederacy.\n\nWith its neutrality broken, both sides quickly moved to establish an advantageous position in the Commonwealth. Under General Albert Sidney Johnston, Confederate forces formed a line in the southern regions of Kentucky and the northern regions of Tennessee, from Columbus to the Cumberland Gap in the east. Johnston dispatched Simon Buckner to fortify the middle at Bowling Green. He arrived on September 18, and began drill sessions and construction elaborate defenses in anticipation of a Union attack.\n\nAfter some riots in Frankfort by Unionists against secessionists, and state militia needing to be called to protect them, the state called a convention on October 29, where Kentucky finally declared its secession, creating a new state seal and flag. This would be contentious, as the state had a larger number of Unionists than other Confederate States. Kentucky would be admitted December 10 to the Confederacy.\n\nConfederate Seal of Kentucky\n\nThe 14-state Confederacy as of December, when Oklahoma became a state.\n\nLincoln's Justifications\n\nIn a letter to Orville Hickman Browning on the 22nd of September, Union President Abraham Lincoln wrote, in a brazen violation of what would become the international Geneva Conventions: \"If a commanding general finds a necessity to seize the farm of a private owner for a pasture, an encampment, or a fortification, he has the right to do so, and to so hold it as long as the necessity lasts; and this is within military law, because within military necessity.\" No mention was made in the letter of any 5th or 6th amendment rights to due process for those not engaged in conflict against the lawful government of the Union.\n\nIn a separate letter, a man named Judge Wakefield wrote to the President, asking whether he had accepted Christianity yet, to which Lincoln wrote: \"My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of salvation and the human origin of the scriptures have become clearer and stronger with advancing years and I see no reason for thinking I shall ever change them.\"\n\nAround the same time, Manford's Magazine quoted the Union President as having said, \"I will not do to investigate the subject of religion too closely, as it is apt to lead to Infidelity (atheism).\"\n\nPresident Lincoln ordered the arrest of several citizens in Baltimore, Maryland, later viewed as illegally done, illegally tried, and illegally jailed. One of those persons was a police officer by the name of John W. Davis, who refused to take the Oath of Allegiance to the US government. A protest broke out against his arrest on the 15th of September, to which Lincoln replied:\n\n\"The President has read this letter, and he deeply commiserates the condition of any one so distressed as the writer seems to be. He does not know Mr. Davis - only knows him to be one of the arrested police commissioners of Baltimore because he says so in this letter. Assuming him to be one of those commissioners, the President understands Mr. Davis could at the time of his arrest, could at any time since, and can now, be released by taking a full oath of allegiance to the government of the United States, and that Mr. Davis has not been kept in ignorance of this condition of release. If Mr. Davis is still so hostile to the government, and so determined to aid its enemies in destroying it, he makes his own choice.\"\n\nJohn Davis's objection was the illegal, in his view, Oath of Allegiance. He was not hostile to the Union, nor did he want to aid the Confederates to the south; he simply didn't believe that he had to take an oath, and for that, he was arrested.\n\nConscientious Objectors Arrested\n\nCaptain Robert Tansill, a US Marine Corps captain, was serving on the USS Congress, and had read the inaugural address of President Lincoln in early August. He felt he could no longer serve in the US Marine Corps, and sent a letter of resignation to Gideon Welles, the Secretary of the Navy, who refused to accept his resignation. Within 24 hours, Tansill was arrested and sent to military prison without a warrant or charges being filed, and without being told why he was being arrested. He wrote a letter to President Lincoln from Fort Lafayette in New York dated October 3, 1861:\n\nHis Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,\n\nPresident of the United States.\n\nSIR: I deem it a duty to myself to bring to the notice of the President the circumstances of my confinement and treatment here. I arrived at Boston in the U. S. frigate Congress on August 23 after an absence from the United States of two years, and resigned my commission as a captain in the U. S. Marine Corps (my only support) rather than join in an unnatural war against my blood relations, kindred and friends. My conscience, the dictates of which I cannot safely disregard, compelled me to this course. On the 27th of August I received a communication from the honorable Secretary of the Navy informing me that my resignation had been received and my name stricken from the rolls of the Marine Corps. Of this I complain not. I was then by an order of the Secretary of the Navy arrested and brought under a guard like a common felon to this fort where I am now incarcerated without even being informed of the charges against me. I have written to the Navy Department* in regard to this unjust and unlawful treatment, to which I have received no answer. As to the particulars and details of my treatment here in prison I deem it unnecessary to trouble Your Excellency. Complaints of this nature have been made by others and forwarded to the Department without having elicited the slightest consideration; besides there are circumstances which decency forbids mentioning to the head of a civilized people. Letters to and from my wife are subjected to the inspection of the commanding officer of this fort, and my dearest friends are denied permission to visit me on the most important business.\n\nUnder such extraordinary circumstances I feel justified in appealing and indeed I have no other resource but to appeal directly to the President which I now do, and respectfully ask that I may be brought to trial as soon as possible on the charges against me whatever they may be, or released from this imprisonment which can find no sanction in the laws of war nor in the Constitution or laws of the country which the President has solemnly sworn to support. Should, however, this just request be disregarded I then ask that I may be sent to Washington, D. C., where my wife and children reside that I may be permitted to see them from whom I have been absent in the service of the United States more than two years.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,\n\nROBERT TANSILL.\n\nHis letter to the President inquiring as to the reason for his arrest never got a reply from the President. So his wife then went to Washington and with a lot of effort, finally got an interview with the President. She asked the President whether he got her husband's letter to him. Lincoln replied, \"I did receive that letter and it has got all the answer it will have.\"\n\nShe reminded the President that her husband had been serving the nation honorably at sea for over two years, and had been imprisoned without due process (a violation of the 5th amendment and the Constitution's promise of the Writ of Habeas Corpus, which Lincoln suspended). She then asked the President if there were any other reason for his arrest other than that he resigned his commission. At that, Lincoln's face \"turned perfectly livid. He jumped up from the table...and brought his clinched fist down hard upon it with an oath.\" (i.e. profanity). Tansill's wife described how Lincoln then began to move about the room with such a violence and excitement before she informed him that she was just there to see if he got her husband's letter. She then said it looked like she had gotten her answer, to which he replied, \"You have most positively!\"\n\nMrs. Tansill reported later that she took her little son by the hand, \"and closed the door, and thus shut away from my sight, I trust for evermore, the greatest despot and tyrant that ever ruled a nation.\"\n\nIt may have been something Tansill said to the President, such as the paragraph:\n\n\"In entering the public service, I took an oath to support the Constitution, which necessarily gives me the right to interpret it. Our institutions, according to my understanding, are founded upon the principle and right of self-government. The States, in forming the Confederacy [i.e. the Union, often called a Confederation since 1776] did not relinquish that right, and I believe each State has a clear and unquestionable right to secede whenever the people thereof think proper, and the Federal Government has no legal or moral authority to use physical force to keep them in the Union. Entertaining these views, I cannot conscientiously join in a war against any of the States which have already seceded or may hereafter secede, either North or South, for the purpose of coercing them back into the Union. Such a war, in my opinion, would not only certainly and permanently destroy the Confederacy* [United States], but if successful, establish an unlimited despotism on the ruins of our liberty.\"\n\nCaptain Tansill remained a prisoner of the state from August 1861 until exchanged in January 1862. He returned back to his home state, Virginia, and was then commissioned as a Captain in the Confederate States Marine Corps.\n\nMany such men were treated this way by the United States, and their suffering was recognized by the Confederate Congress, which awarded them \"leave of absence pay\" for time served as a prisoner of the state. Note that Tansill was motivated by his view of constitutional liberty, not slavery, in his opposition to the war.\n\nResignations from the US Military\n\nIt was not uncommon for people to resign from the northern armed forces due to their objection to the war against the seceded states. Lieutenant James B. Lewis, from Charleston, (West) Virginia wrote to Secretary Welles:\n\nThe General Government having been converted into a military despotism & when I entered the service (then an honorable one), I was sworn to support the constitution of the U.S. That having been set aside, \"the higher law\" compells me to resign & I do hereby resign my position as Lieutenant in the United States Navy.... It is with deep mortification that I recognize the fact of the utter failure on the part of the North in the failure in the experiment of constitutional liberty. What a spectacle [to] all intelligent minds, is the immolation of the cardinal principles of the declaration of independence (those Virginia fought through a seven years war to establish), 'the consent of the governed & to institute new governments.' The despotism has usurped the place of constitutional liberty.\n\nCaptain Isaac Mayo was another such resignation, which he wrote in early May of 1861:\n\nFor more than half a century it has been the pride of my life to hold office under the Government of the United States. For twenty-five, I have engaged in active sea-service and have never seen my flag dishonored, or the American arms disgraced by defeat. It was the hope of my old age that I might die, as I had lived, an officer in the Navy of a free Government. This hope has been taken from me. In adopting the policy of coercion, you have denied to millions of freemen the rights of the Constitution and in its stead you have placed the will of a sectional Party. As one of the oldest soldiers of America, I protest--in the name of humanity-against this \"war against brethren!\" I cannot fight against the Constitution while pretending to fight for it. You will therefore oblige me by accepting my resignation.\n\nFrom the distant island of St. Helena, Lieutenant James J. Waddell sent the following while serving on the USS John Adams:\n\nThe people of the State of North Carolina having withdrawn their allegiance to the Government of the late Confederacy of the United States ... I return to 'His Excellency the President of the United States,' the Commission which appointed me a Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy ... In thus separating myself from association which I have cherished for twenty years, I wish it to be understood that no doctrine of the rights of secession, nor wish for disunion of the States impel me, but simply because my home is the home of my people in the South, and I could not bear arms against them.\n\nIt should be noted that Captain Mayo was accepted into the Confederate Navy and served honorably until wounded in 1864, and was honorably discharged in 1865. Lt. Waddell served through 1865 and was discharged a Captain.\n\n*In OTL, Mayo committed suicide on May 18, 1861.\n\nBattle of Ball's Bluff\n\nOn the 19th of October, General McClellan ordered Brig. Gen. George McCall to discover why Col Nathan Evans had left Leesburg. Unknown to them, he had returned when Confederate Brig. Gen. Beauregard expressed his displeasure at the move, and took up a defensive position at the Alexandria-to-Winchester Turnpike. While McCall was completing his mapping of the area, McClellan ordered Brig. Gen. Charles Pomeroy Stone to perform a 'slight demonstration' to see how the Confederates would react. Stone moved the troops towards the river at Edwards Ferry, and fired artillery into suspected Confederate positions on the night of the 20th. He crossed about a hundred men of the 1st MN to the VA shore just before dusk. When he got no reaction, he recalled his troops to their camps, and ended his 'slight demonstration.'\n\nStone then ordered Colonel Charles Devens of the 15th Massachusetts Infantry, which was stationed on an island called Harrison's Island, which faced Ball's Bluff, to send a patrol across the river to try to gather information about enemy deployments. He sent Captain Chase Philbrick and about 20 men to carry out the order, but Philbrick mistook a row of trees for Confederate tents, and returned, reporting a camp. Devens was then ordered to cross 300 men, and attack the camp, then return.\n\nThe next morning on the 21st, Col. Devens's raiding party discovered the patrol's mistake from the night before. They opted not to recross, and instead he deployed his men in a tree line, and sent a messenger back to Stone for new instructions. Stone let him know the rest of the 15th MA (around 350 more men) would join him. Once they arrived, Devens was ordered to move towards Leesburg for reconnaissance. Colonel (and US Senator) Edward Dickinson Baker showed up in Stone's camp to find out about the morning's events; Stone let him know about last night's mistake, and then ordered Baker to go to the crossing, evaluate the situation, and either withdraw troops in Virginia or cross more troops at his discretion.\n\nWhile going upriver, Baker met Devens's messenger, he found out that they had encountered one company (Co. K) of the 17th MS Infantry. (Fourteen black Confederates took up rifles with this company when white enlisted fell in battle; twelve survived the fight.) Finding this out, Baker ordered as many of his troops as he could find to cross the river, but didn't find out how many boats were available, and created a bottleneck, making the crossing merely a drizzle of troops.\n\nDevens's men (around 650 now) remained and engaged in two more skirmishes with the growing force of Confederates, while other Union troops crossed the river, but was unable to advance from his position there. Devens finally withdrew around 2 PM and met Col Baker, who crossed about 30 minutes later. Beginning about 3 PM, the fighting began in earnest and continued till just after dark.\n\nDeath of Col. Edward D. Baker at the Battle of Ball's Bluff, by Irving and Howe\n\nCol. Baker was killed around 4:30 PM, and to this day remains the only US Senator killed in battle. After their abortive attempt to break out from their restricted position around the bluff, the Union troops began to recross the river in disarray. Shortly before sunset, a fresh Confederate regiment (17th Mississippi) arrived, and formed the core of the Confederate assault that finally broke and routed the Union troops.\n\nMany of the Union soldiers were driven down the steep slope at the southern end of a place called Ball's Bluff (near the present day Union Cemetery), and into the river. Union boats attempting to cross the river back to the other side were soon swamped and capsized on the way back to Harrison Island. Many Union troops, including wounded, drowned. Bodies from the battle floated downriver to Washington, DC and even as far as Mt. Vernon in the days following the battle.\n\nCasualties:\n\nUnion:\n\n-killed: 253\n\n-wounded: 244\n\n-captured: 584\n\nConfederate:\n\n-killed: 36\n\n-wounded: 117\n\n-captured: 2\n\nOnly 65 dead were buried at the eventual Ball's Bluff Union Cemetery, leading to some inaccurate reports that only 65 died in battle.\n\nThe defeat of the Union forces at Ball's Bluff was a relatively minor one in comparison to the coming battles, but it had a wide impact within and without military affairs due to the loss of a sitting senator. Union Brigadier General Charles Stone became a scapegoat for the defeat, and some in Congress suspected a conspiracy to betray the Union. With three defeats now - Manassas, Wilson's Creek, and now Ball's Bluff - Congress created a Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War to oversee the war efforts, but would rather harry the officers for the duration of the war, and give special attention to Democrat officers, which would give the unfortunate effect of causing political infighting amongst the generals in high command, which would somewhat hinder Union war efforts.\n\nThe Trent Affair\n\nBritain's relations with the North soured when Captain Charles Wilkes of the US frigate San Jacinto intercepted the British mail packet Trent on November 8, 1861, as it sailed from the Spanish port of Havana in Cuba. He was acting on his own initiative, and was intent on arresting the two Confederate commissioners who were on board, James Mason and John Slidell.\n\nCommissioners Mason and Slidell.\n\nBut the commander of Wilkes's boarding party, Lieutenant Fairfax, was nearly shot, and a fistfight started on deck between the Americans and Britons, leaving two wounded Americans and five wounded Britons; the British were protesting the boarding of their ship in violation of their rights as neutrals, which America herself had insisted on when its own Yankee slave ships had sailed from Massachusetts to Africa.\n\nWilkes returned triumphantly with the two captured commissioners. His audacious action had turned him into a hero in the North overnight, but also plunged the Lincoln administration into its worst crisis yet. The news reached London by November 25, and Queen Victoria was outraged; she wrote that British blood 'boiled' and Viscount Palmerston, her Prime Minister, was outraged as well. \"You may stand for this,\" he raged at his Cabinet, \"but damned if I will!\"\n\nThe Foreign Secretary, Lord John Russell, drafted a blunt memorandum to Lord Lyons, the British Minister in Washington, demanding the release of the captives, and a full apology.\n\nThe memorandum left little room for negotiation and made it impossible for the North to have any room to wiggle out of it.\n\nOn December 2 Congress unanimously passed a resolution thanking Wilkes \"for his brave, adroit, and patriotic conduct in the arrest and detention of the traitors, James M. Mason and John Slidell,\" and proposing that he receive a \"gold medal with suitable emblems and devices, in testimony of the high sense entertained by Congress of his good conduct.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for people to begin remarking that the capture of Mason and Slidell resembled the search and impressment practices of the British which the United States had always opposed since its founding and which had previously led to the War of 1812 with Britain. The idea of humans as contraband failed to strike a chord with many in the north.\n\nHenry Adams wrote to his brother on the impressment issue:\n\nGood God, what's got into you all? What in Hell do you mean by deserting now the great principles of our fathers; by returning to the vomit of that dog Great Britain? What do you mean by asserting now principles against which every Adams yet has protested and resisted? You're mad, all of you.\n\nPeople also started to realize that the issue might be resolved less on legalities and more on the necessity of avoiding a serious conflict with Britain. Elder statesmen such as former President James Buchanan, Thomas Ewing, Lewis Cass, and Robert Walker all came out publicly for the necessity of releasing the commissioners and avoiding war with the British while fighting the rebels also. As December wore on, much of the editorial opinion in northern newspapers started to mirror these opinions and to prepare the American citizens for the release of the prisoners. The opinion that Wilkes had operated without orders and had erred by, in effect, holding a prize court on the deck of the San Jacinto was being spread across the north to try to nudge public opinion away from 'war with Britain too!' to 'Wilkes screwed up and it's not a reflection on us!'\n\nThe United States were initially very reluctant to back down on the issue. Seward, the Secretary of State, had lost his first opportunity to immediately release the two envoys as an affirmation of the long-held U.S. interpretation of international law. He had written to US Minister Adams at the end of November that Wilkes had not acted under official instructions, but would hold back any more information until it had received some response from Great Britain. He reiterated to him that recognition of the Confederacy would likely lead to war.\n\nLincoln was at first enthused about the capture and reluctant to let them go, but as the reality of the very real possibility of a war with the British Empire at the same time set in he stated:\n\n\"I fear the traitors will prove to be white elephants. We must stick to American principles concerning the rights of neutrals. We fought Great Britain for insisting … on the right to do precisely what Captain Wilkes has done. If Great Britain shall now protest against the act, and demand their release, we must give them up, apologize for the act as a violation of our doctrines, and thus forever bind her over to keep the peace in relation to neutrals, and so acknowledge that she has been wrong for sixty years.\"\n\nThe London Standard saw the capture as \"but one of a series of premeditated blows aimed at this country … to involve it in a war with the Northern States.\" A letter from an American visitor written to Seward declared, \"The people are frantic with rage, and were the country polled I fear 999 men out of 1,000 would declare for immediate war.\" A member of Parliament stated that unless America set matters right the British flag should \"be torn into shreds and sent to Washington for use of the Presidential water-closets.\" The seizure provoked half a dozen anti-Union meetings, held in Liverpool (which became a hub of Confederate sympathy), Oxford, London, Edinburgh, and Dublin and chaired by the future Confederate spokesman James Spence in Liverpool. Private ships began trading non-military supplies to the Confederates at this time, evading the Union blockade by reaching the Bahamas, Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico, or British Honduras.\n\nIt also did not help the British that an accidental fire near some of its textile mills and warehouses had burned up a good portion of its cotton surplus, making the necessity of acquiring more cotton more pressing in Parliament. An emergency cabinet meeting was called by Palmerston.\n\nPrime Minister Palmerston, who believed he had received a verbal agreement from Adams that British vessels would not be interfered with, reportedly began the emergency cabinet meeting by throwing his hat on the table and declaring, \"I don't know whether you are going to stand this, but I'll be damned if I do.\" The Law Officers' report was read and confirmed that Wilkes actions were:\n\nillegal and unjustifiable by international law. The \"San Jacinto\" assumed to act as a belligerent, but the \"Trent\" was not captured or carried into a port of the United States for adjudication as a prize, and, under the circumstances, cannot be considered as having acted in breach of international law. It follows, that from on board a merchant-ship of a neutral Power, pursuing a lawful and innocent voyage, certain individuals have been taken by force... Her Majesty's Government will, therefore, in our opinion, be justified in requiring reparation for the international wrong which has been on this occasion committed\n\nDispatches from Lyons were given to all in attendance. These dispatches described the excitement in America in support of the capture, referred to previous dispatches in which Lyons had warned that Seward might provoke such an incident, and described the difficulty that the United States might have in acknowledging that Wilkes had erred. Lyons also recommended a show of force including sending reinforcements to Canada and a fleet to the South to protect British economic interests. Palmerston indicated to Lord Russell that it was very possible that the entire incident had been a \"deliberate and premeditated insult\" designed by Seward to \"provoke\" a confrontation with Britain.\n\nAfter several days of discussion, on November 30 Russell sent to Queen Victoria the drafts of the dispatches intended for Lord Lyons to deliver to Seward. The Queen in turn asked her husband and consort, Prince Albert, to review the matter. Although ill at the time, Albert read through the dispatches, decided the ultimatum was too belligerent, and composed a slightly softened version. In his November 30 response to Palmerston, Albert wrote:\n\nThe Queen … should have liked to have seen the expression of a hope [in the message to Seward] that the American captain did not act under instructions, or, if he did that he misapprehended them [and] that the United States government must be fully aware that the British Government could not allow its flag to be insulted, and the security of her mail communications to be placed in jeopardy, and [that] Her Majesty's Government are unwilling to believe that the United States Government intended wantonly to put an insult upon this country and to add to their many distressing complications by forcing a question of dispute upon us, and that we are therefore glad to believe … that they would spontaneously offer such redress as alone could satisfy this country, viz: the restoration of the unfortunate passengers and a suitable apology, and full acceptance of the continuance of commerce between the exports of the southern states and Her Majesty's island realms, and acceptance of observers from the United Kingdom to observe both sides of this conflict currently raging upon your continent.\n\nMeanwhile, General Winfield Scott made a trip to Paris to meet with the French and counter Confederate propaganda efforts. The timing was considered odd by British Ambassador to France Lord Cowley, who suggested to Scott that he may want to avoid giving Cowley the impression of a military alliance with France against the British by staying in France. Scott left within 48 hours, returning to the United States.\n\nIn the wake of the Trent Affair, Lord Palmerston managed to secure funding to augment the Canadian defenses from the meager 2100 in Nova Scotia, 2200 in the rest of Canada, and scattered posts across the remainder of British North America. Another 15,000 infantry and cavalry were sent with supporting cavalry.\n\nThe news of the Trent Affair hit the stock economy, causing the market in New York to fall, and several banks to suspend payment in specie; only in Ohio, Indiana, and Union-held parts of Kentucky continued to pay in coin, leaving the Treasury unable to pay its soldiers, suppliers, or contractors. This would be the impetus in creating 'greenbacks' (fiat money) to pay people.\n\nWith all of the negative news, the official response from France also arrived. William Dayton (US Minister to France) had already told Seward of his own meeting with Thouvenel, in which the French foreign minister had told him that Wilkes' actions were \"a clear breach of international law\" and that France would \"remain a spectator in any war between the United States and England but would expect her right to trade peacefully in the southern states would be respected.\"\n\nLyons made it known to Seward that his government sought peaceful trade with the south, as its cotton and tobacco were well-sought in the United Kingdom and the rest of the empire, and this would be seen as a gesture of goodwill by the Americans to continue a vital trade from its southern states.\n\nSeward's reply was \"a long, highly political document,\" with several inconsistencies in logic, but gave the British what they wanted. Seward stated that Wilkes had acted on his own and apologized to the British for the treatment of their citizens by American naval personnel. The capture and search of Trent was consistent with international law, and Wilkes' only errors were in failing to take Trent to a port for judicial determination and in not controlling his own men on the British ship. The release of the prisoners was therefore required in order \"to do to the British nation just what we have always insisted all nations ought to do to us.\" Seward's reply, in effect, accepted Wilkes' treatment of the prisoners as contraband and also equated their capture with the British exercise of impressment of British citizens off of neutral ships. Seward continued to state that the southern states being in rebellion with the legal government of the United States, British trade would be seen as a violation of their neutrality and could open the two to war; however, the Lincoln government wished to avoid all appearance of hostility between the two powers and would allow cotton and tobacco out of the south in exchange for non-military items (no gunpowder, rifles, cartridges, cannon, etc) being returned into the south.\n\nAt the time, the North was demanding that the British government withdraw its recognition of Confederate belligerency in the form of its Proclamation of Neutrality, however, Lord Lyons made it clear to Seward that it would remain in effect, and that the United States were not in a position to make demands upon Her Majesty's Government at this time.\n\nMason and Slidell were released from Fort Warren, and boarded the HMS Rinaldo at Provincetown, MA. The ship took them to St Thomas, and then on the 14th of January, they left on the mail packet La Plata for Southampton. The news of their release reached Britain on January 8, which was received by the British as a diplomatic victory. Their textile mill owners and workers were happy that their supplies of cotton would continue. Palmerston noted that Seward's response contained \"many doctrines of international law\" contrary to the British interpretation, and Russell wrote a detailed response to Seward contesting his legal interpretations, but the crisis was now over. The North had egg on its face, but it could come out claiming to save face. The South did not get its diplomatic recognition just yet, but the British public opinion was slowly turning towards them due to the Union's missteps. And unfortunately for them, the South would be able to avoid their blockade in many respects, such that their international trade would only be blocked by a third by 1862.\n\nThanksgiving Day (November)\n\nDuring the first year of war, the Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, made a proclamation of thanksgiving:\n\nProclamation of Thanksgiving, 1861\n\nby President Jefferson Davis\n\nWHEREAS, it hath pleased Almighty God, the Sovereign Disposer of events, to protect and defend us hitherto in our conflicts with our enemies as to be unto them a shield.\n\nAnd whereas, with grateful thanks we recognize His hand and acknowledge that not unto us, but unto Him, belongeth the victory, and in humble dependence upon His almighty strength, and trusting in the justness of our purpose, we appeal to Him that He may set at naught the efforts of our enemies, and humble them to confusion and shame.\n\nNow therefore, I, Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States, in view of impending conflict, do hereby set apart Friday, the 15th day of November, as a day of national humiliation and prayer, and do hereby invite the reverend clergy and the people of these Confederate States to repair on that day to their homes and usual places of public worship, and to implore blessing of Almighty God upon our people, that he may give us victory over our enemies, preserve our homes and altars from pollution, and secure to us the restoration of peace and prosperity.\n\nGiven under hand and seal of the Confederate States at Richmond, this the 31st day of October, year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and sixty one.\n\nBy the President,\n\nJEFFERSON DAVIS\n\nPresident Davis would do the same in 1862 (Nov 14), 1863 (Nov 20), and 1864 (Nov 18); only in 1863, and with public pressure, would Abraham Lincoln copy President Davis's proclamation with one of his own. In 1865, President Davis would sign a bill making the third Thursday of each November the official day of Thanksgiving in the Confederacy.\n\nNOTE: Quotes in this post are the person's own words, not mine. They are in the public record if you use Bing or DuckDuckGo to search for them.\n\nNew Orleans, LA\n\nA seven-mile long line of Confederate soldiers marched through the streets of New Orleans on the 23rd of November to cheers of the people. Among them were 1400 free black volunteers.\n\nMissouri Gets Taxed\n\nIn December, Major General Henry Halleck, who was in charge of the Department of Missouri in the winter of the first year of the war, issued an order that those \"known to be hostile to the Union\" would be taxed \"in proportion to the guilt and property of each individual\" with the proceeds of that taxation supposedly earmarked for 'suffering' Unionist Missourians.\n\nThe Missourians who were assessed the tax had a week to appeal, but if they couldn't prove their loyalty to the United States, the amount owed increased 10%. Per Halleck's order: \"Any one who shall resist or attempt to resist the execution of these orders will be immediately arrested and imprisoned.\" For the people of Missouri who couldn't afford to pay cash, their fur"
