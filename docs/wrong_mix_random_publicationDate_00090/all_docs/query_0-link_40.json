        "text": "From the November/December 2017 Issue\n\nSend your news to the BAM at alumni_magazine@brown.edu.\n\nFrom the September/October 2017 Issue\n\nJoseph McNally writes, “A recent article in Military Officer magazine prompted memories of my recall into the navy after graduation due to the outbreak of the Korean War. The article presented Thule, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Greenland, as an interesting place to visit. But I could only think of the polar darkness, frozen seas, and weeks of being trapped there by ice floes before construction could begin on Thule Air Base.” Joe has lived in San Diego since 1971. His wife, Bonnie, passed away in 2010.\n\nFrom the May/June 2017 Issue\n\nRoy Fidler has added another docent activity. In addition to giving school talks about endangered species for China Camp State Park, he is now leading architecture tours at the Marin County Civic Center designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nPaul Lipsitt writes: “My wife, Brooke Lipsitt ’63, and I were part of a group of 15 on a people-to-people visit to Cuba when Ron Offenkrantz ’58 spotted my Brown cap. We were delighted to get to know him and his wife, Blossom, and to bond over our shared Brown experiences. We loved the warmth of the wonderful Cuban people as well as their music and art, and marveled over their ingenuity in maintaining their 1950s-era cars for daily use.”\n\nOn Mar. 4, 2016, Victor Donald Russo Jr., a retired supreme court trial attorney with more than 60 years of experience at Allstate, was selected as a Top Trial Attorney of North America and included in the “Who’s Who Directory (2016–2017) of Top Attorneys of North America.”\n\nFrom the March/April 2017 Issue\n\nJohn K. Stepita writes: “I write periodically to [BAM editor and publisher] Norman Boucher, and he always responds kindly although I am critical. I sent a welcome to Logan Powell, dean of admission. He is outstanding and a great addition to the staff. I keep in touch with Christina Paxson—she is superb.”\n\nFrom the November/December 2016 Issue\n\nRoy Fidler reports that several classmates responded to an inquiry about their travels. Roy counts as travel highlights more than 25 house exchanges in Europe with his wife, Carole. He writes: “As members of Servas, an international peace organization, we’ve enjoyed home stays and day visits with fellow members in India, Japan, and most countries in Europe, while visitors from other countries have stayed with us.”\n\nAre you engaged in volunteer activities? Class members are invited to submit reports on their current (or recent) volunteer work for a volunteer-themed Class Notes entry in an upcoming issue of the BAM. What? Where? Why you do it?\n\nTemple Fawcett, who lives in a senior complex in Providence, offered memories of a lifetime of hiking adventures in the Colorado Rockies, the Italian Dolomites, Bryce, and Zion, as well as hill walking in England, Scotland, and Wales. She writes: “I somehow seemed always to be at the back of the pack, but always enjoyed it.”\n\nPaul Lipsitt and his wife, Brooke Kruger Lipsitt ’63, sailed on the Queen Elizabeth in June through the Baltic Sea via Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Tallinn to St. Petersburg. Paul and Brooke write: “The ship as a hotel simplifies travel for us more mature types. But the tempting edibles available 24 hours a day are a real risk to one’s avoirdupois.”\n\nBill Walsh and his partner of 14 years, Myra Oliver, who live in Orange City, Fla., are scheduled for a couple of end-of-year cruises, one starting from Rome, and another a round-trip to Hawaii.\n\nHarry Westcott writes that most of his journeys have been with Lindgrad/National Geographic Adventure Cruises with trips that have included both Poles, the Northwest Passage, and the Panama Canal. Using their camper van, he and his wife have also crossed the United States from coast to coast and spent a month in Canada’s Maritime Provinces. Harry writes: “Travel is on a temporary hold while my wife, Gerd, completes treatments for cancer.”\n\nFrom the September/October 2016 Issue\n\nPauline Longo Denning (see Joan McMaster ’60).\n\nFrances H. Leimkuehler writes: “I enjoy reading about exciting new programs and research in the BAM. Thank you.”\n\nFrom the July/August 2016 Issue\n\nLeroy Anderson released his first book, Joie de Vivre, from Page Publishing. He writes: “It’s a chronicle of my family’s history over 150 years and abounds with over 800 incredible pictures that follow each chapter. The story follows my community banking career and is supplemented with many collateral interests in music, travel, church, sailing, camping, and gardening, all described in a quite readable and witty presentation. Our multi-home residency to accommodate my banking career provides lots of ammunition and color for many personal vignettes.”\n\nRoy Fidler writes: “Class members of 1950 are invited to submit reports on their past, recent, and/or upcoming travels for a travel-themed class notes entry in the November/December issue of the BAM. Submissions must be received by August 15.\n\nFrom the May/June 2016 Issue\n\nRobert H. Breslin Jr. writes: “I read recently a class note from Russ Kinne in which he talked about the paucity of news from the class of 1950. It happens that I was extremely fortunate last August to have lunch with Don Parker and his son, Luke. Don is doing great. He’s in Amelia Island, Florida, and was up here visiting his children. My daughter, Pamela Breslin Murphy ’80, lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland, and my son, Bob, lives in Dover, Massachusetts, and has a summer house in nearby Saunderstown, Rhode Island. They are all well, as are our grandchildren. I still practice law as of counsel to the firm of Sullivan & Sullivan in North Kingstown, Rhode Island.”\n\nFrom the March/April 2016 Issue\n\nRoy Fidler writes that his life has come full circle in some respects. “My first job after graduation was guiding tours for the New York Times. I am back leading tours again as a volunteer at China Camp State Park, near my home in San Rafael, California, having been trained to give nature walks and campfire talks.” He notes, “The park is on the National Register of Historic Places for a Chinese shrimp-fishing village that thrived on the site in the 1880s.”\n\nFrom the January/February 2016 Issue\n\nClass president Paul Lipsitt reports the following attendees at the 65th reunion: Gene Ahearn, Claire and Leroy Anderson, Bruce ’53 ScM and Caroline Decatur Chick, Pauline Longo Denning, Temple Fawcett, Harold Godlin, Celine and Robert Hall, Mary Holburn, Russ Kinne, Mary Beth and Jack Leeming, Paul and Brooke Kruger Lipsitt ’63, William and Nancy Rosenstein Mayer ’73 MAT, Donald McLellan, Rita Caslowitz Michaelson, Ron Picerne, Bill and Amelia Stern Revkin ’53, Christine and Donald Russo, Betts Swantz Sanford and Gerrit Sanford ’49, Sandra and Cy Seifert, Bill Walsh and Mary Oliver, Gerd and Harry Westcott, and Ron Wilson and Delores Younger. Paul writes: “A highlight of the reunion was the publication of the 65th Reunion Yearbook, which contained 88 biographical sketches submitted by our classmates. Among the many contributors was former class president Allen Kerr, who, sadly, did not live to see the yearbook produced. But he was proud to know that his granddaughter, Leigh Thomas ’15, graduated on our 65th. Class marshals Paul and Ron Wilson led the procession through the Van Wickle Gates.”\n\nClass secretary Roy Fidler invites members of the class to e-mail or snail mail him directly with their news. He writes: “If e-mailing, please put ‘Brown ’50’ in the subject line to ensure it doesn’t wind up in spam.” He also reports that retiring class president Paul Lipsitt received the Nan Bouchard Tracy ’46 Award for Distinguished Service from the Alumni Association in October. During Paul’s six years of leadership, the class of ’50 was honored as 2012’s Class of the Year.\n\nGordon Allen retired in 1986, before moving to the Cape Cod town of Osterville, Mass. Now he spends half the year at his Orchid, Fla., home. He lives with his wife of 64 years. He writes: “We first dated as undergrads when Sally was at Wheaton.”\n\nBruce Chick ’53 ScM and Caroline Decatur Chick were elected class copresidents at the 65th reunion. Rita Caslowitz Michaelson is vice-president, John Poulos is treasurer, and Roy Fidler is secretary of the class.\n\nHomer L. Gibbs Jr. writes: “I’m enjoying living on the Maine coast. No stents or new joints! As I write this, sitting 30 feet from the salt water, I’m thinking back 69 years to entering Brown with many other WWII veterans and realizing how fortunate I have been!”\n\nJerry Green is still doing his weekly sports column and is slated to cover his 50th Super Bowl in February. But he writes: “None of those games gave me the thrill I had in watching my granddaughter score two goals for the Univ. of Michigan lacrosse team.” Jerry lives in Detroit full-time.\n\nRuss Kinne invites any alums traveling through MidCoast Maine to pay him a visit in Topsham. He writes: “I was honored to help carry the class banner down the Hill at our 65th reunion. I’m still active in writing and photography. My first fiction, Rosie’s Lightning, is on Amazon.”\n\nHarvey Lapides writes from Barrington, R.I., that, while vacationing in the California desert, he read a story in a local paper about a semi-retired local resident who has been a sportswriter for the Detroit News. It turned out to be classmate Jerry Green. Harvey writes: “We reconnected after 60 years and have kept in touch since. Jerry had an incredible career as one of only two living writers to cover all 49 Super Bowls.”\n\nFrances “Limey” Leimkuehler volunteers at the Butterfly House of the Missouri Botanical Garden. She writes: “Biology was my first interest at Brown, and the time I’ve spent as a docent teaching school classes and greeting visitors from all over the world continues to enrich my life.”\n\nFrom the November/December 2015 Issue\n\nRuss Kinne writes: “I’ve noticed the dearth of info in the BAM on the grand and glorious class of 1950, and though I don’t have much news, here it is. I attended our 65th reunion last May. When I arrived, College Hill was, understandably, crowded with people and cars. My assigned dorm room was only 50 feet from my car. What phenomenal luck! I didn’t move my car all weekend. But it was sad to see how few classmates made it back to the reunion. There were only 25 of us at the class dinner, but a good time was had by all. A highlight for me was the honor of helping Paul Lipsitt carry our banner down the Hill. Paul was looking mighty spiffy in his formal duds and tall silk hat. It was grand fun all around, and I plan to attend next year, too. In the meantime, any alums traveling through mid-coast Maine are most welcome to pay me a visit. Brown is still a strong force in my life, and I treasure the time I spent there.”\n\nPeter Lawson writes: “My new book, Lifeline for the End Times: Creating a New Humanity for the Apocalypse and Beyond, is now available on Amazon in paperback and Kindle editions. The achievement of my life is five kids, 13 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren, who are all exceptionally decent and caring human beings. After 17 years in Valley Ford, California, Danielle and I have moved to Petaluma.”\n\nFrom the September/October 2014 Issue\n\nGene Ahearn was married to Shirley Jackson for 61 years. They met in 1947, lived in Belgium and France for five years, visited 53 countries, and enjoyed Florida for 23 years. Gene is now a resident of a retirement community.\n\nRobert Shepard writes: “I’m now located in a fine and spacious condominium, not a long drive from Rockland, Mass., to Providence. Physical ailments are a problem, but they seem to occur one at a time, so far!”\n\nFrom the July/August 2014 Issue\n\nMartin L. Jacobs’s wife, Phyllis, passed away Oct. 8, 2013.\n\nHarry D. Lane writes that he is working with his five sons five days a week as an architectural engineer in the same construction business.\n\nJohn Leeming is still playing tennis two to three times a week.\n\nJanet Brof writes: “A story of mine, ‘Holding Ground,’ about the last winter of my husband, Bill De Moss, who died in December, appeared in the fall issue of Persimmon Tree Magazine. I continue to write and to teach writing.”\n\nFrom the March/April 2014 Issue\n\nJanet Brof’s haikus about life with her husband, Bill DeMoss, were featured in the fall issue of Persimmon Tree, an online arts magazine for women over 60 (persimmontree.org ).\n\nFrom the November/December 2013 Issue\n\nClass secretary June Gibbs reports: “The class of 1950 held its annual mini-reunion on May 23 at the Providence home of newly elected copresident Rita Caslowitz Michaelson. Twenty-three graduates, spouses, and friends attended, including copresident Paul Lipsitt and his wife, Brooke Kruger Lipsitt ’63; board members Bruce and Caroline Decatur Chick; former president Ollie Patrell and his wife, Kay; former class secretary Mary Holburn; and current secretary, June Gibbs.\n\n“Joe McNally was newly elected vice president, and present officers were approved unanimously. Also in attendance were Eugene Ahearn; Pauline Longo Denning; John and Joan Durnin; M. Temple Fawcett; Bill Mayer; Don and Jeanne McLellan; Jean Stack Robbins; Robert Shepard; Bets Swantz and her husband, Gerry Sanford ’49; and Edward and Mary Ann Torgen.\n\n“Recognition of the class of ’50 as recipient of the Class of the Year Award, along with our being among the top contributors to both the Annual Fund and the General Fund, was reported.”\n\nFrom the May/June 2013 Issue\n\nClass president Paul Lipsitt reports: “This year our class received the Class of the Year Award. Our consistency in holding annual mini-reunions between our five-year major reunions was a contributing factor in achieving this recognition. On Thursday, May 23, from 5 to 7 p.m., we hope to exceed last year’s very respectable gathering. Rita Caslowitz Michaelson, our copresident, has graciously offered to host our event in her home at 97 Angell St., close to the campus. There is a fee of $25 per person to help defray the planned heavy hors d’oeuvres and an open bar.”\n\nRuss Kinne writes: “After many years of living in New Canaan, Connecticut, I’ve moved to Maine. I have a small, simple, rustic, primitive little log cabin with only the bare essentials of life—electricity, running hot and cold water, central heat, gas and electric stoves, trash compactor, phone, TV, Internet access and e-mail, and two woodstoves. Any passing Brunonians are invited to say hello. I’m in Topsham, near Brunswick, in the midcoast region, or by today’s navigation about 45 minutes past L.L. Bean. I plan to get my next aircraft in the spring—been too long ground-bound.”\n\nFrom the March/April 2013 Issue\n\nHarry D. Lane writes: “I feel I was fortunate in receiving a civil engineering degree at Brown in 1950, which helped me to attain a Texas professional engineering license after four years’ experience. Following an added two years working as an architect and taking the state exam, I became a registered architect, as well as engineer, in both Texas and New Mexico. I will have to credit Brown for a sound education. I recently received my 50-year pin from Phi Delta Theta fraternity. I also have time for seven children and just had my first great-granddaughter. I was able to attend my first and only reunion, the 50th, in 2000. I got together with four fraternity brothers in 2004 for a four-day golf trip in Houston. I would love to get back for a reunion, but two knee replacements, a hip replacement, three back operations, and a few hernias have slowed me down—but I still work! I enjoy the alumni magazine.”\n\nFrom the January/February 2013 Issue\n\nPaul D. Lipsitt writes: “The Class of 1950 was honored to be the recipient of the 2012 Class of the Year award at the alumni fall weekend and presidential inauguration. As class president, I accepted the award, which honored the class for its continuous annual mini-reunions and its ‘unique component’: inviting current student veterans to join the reunion of the class, which includes many veterans of World War II. Present as special guests at the ceremony were Bruce Chick, Caroline Decatur Chick, and Phyllis Cook. The extensive contributions of copresident Allen Kerr, who passed away on September 22, were recognized with a minute of silence. His granddaughter, Leigh Thomas ’15, was also a special guest.”\n\nHarry S. Westcott writes: “I was in the Arctic in August looking for sea ice in Greenland with National Geographic and Lindblad Expeditions. No ice in Iceland; no green in Greenland. Glaciers retreating at an alarming rate. Northwest passage open to ordinary vessels. Global warming a myth?”\n\nFrom the November/December 2012 Issue\n\nClass secretary June Johnson Gibbs writes: “The class of 1950 held a mini-reunion on May 24 at the Hope Club in Providence. Thirty-five members, some of whom hadn’t been able to attend in recent years, were present along with spouses and friends. Three veterans were also in attendance: Philip Crean ’14, Nicholas Gesualdo ’13, and David Salsone ’13. Our copresident, Paul Lipsitt, met all three at a Veterans Day event in November and extended them an invitation. Conversation, food, and drink were enjoyed, followed by a warm welcome from copresidents Allen Kerr and Paul. A special project was proposed for future class reunions before our big 65th reunion in 2015. We are asking all 1950 classmates to write a one-page biography of what has happened to them since graduating from Brown on June 2, 1950. These should be mailed to Paula Pillsbury DeBlois ’89 in Alumni Relations at Box 1859, Providence, R.I. 02912. They will appear on our website and help us build greater participation in future reunions.”\n\nFrom the May/June 2012 Issue\n\nRobert Follett published his ninth book, the second edition of How To Keep Score in Business: Accounting and Financial Analysis for the Non-Accountant. The first edition was used in college business courses, purchased by companies for up-and-coming employees, and used as a text for seminars and workshops. He is already at work on his next book.\n\nWilliam Pollard (see J. Cheston Constable ’39).\n\nShirley Lechtman Sallet writes: “At 82, I was without doubt the oldest member of the Creative Aging Training Institute sponsored by the Creative Center for the Arts in Healthcare in New York. I was honored to be one of 40 participants from the United States and Canada, and I was especially impressed by the research that pointed to measurable health benefits for the aging population who engage in any of the arts. We heard leaders in their fields tell how neighborhood centers and retirement and nursing homes are actively using music-making, play-acting, and working in the visual arts to improve the quality of life for the elderly. And, since I create art myself, as well as conduct art workshops in healthcare settings, this whole experience was right up my alley. I am happily living on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, not far from my son Jonathan Sallet ’74, my daughter Hilary, and my grandchildren.”\n\nFrom the January/February 2012 Issue\n\nClass secretary June Johnson Gibbs reports: \"The class of '50 held its annual mini-reunion in the Petteruti Lounge at the newly renovated Faunce House on Thursday, May 26. Approximately 20 people attended, including Brown and Pembroke alumni and alumnae, many with their spouses. Copresidents Donald Hazard and Allen Kerr were both in attendance. Special thanks to Paula Pillsbury DeBlois '89.\"\n\nJohn Leeming writes he is happy to be in Sarasota, Fla., with his wife, Mary Beth Abel Leeming, and near his son John Leeming II '81 and his family.

All is well on Cape Cod, where life, even in summer, is serene.\"\n\nThomas Quinn writes: \"I'm sorry I wasn't able to attend the 60th reunion, but I'm feeling much better now that I've hit 86!\"\n\nFrom the November/December 2011 Issue\n\nUrsula Heineman Rickenberg lives at Epoch Assisted Living on the East Side in Providence. She writes: \"I recently took part in a poetry class at Epoch with Brown professor Rick Benjamin. We published a book of our poetry, Life, Loss, Love. All profits will be donated to a student literary scholarship.\"\n\nFrom the July/August 2011 Issue\n\nDonald R. MacDonald moved to a continuing care community in August 2010.\n\nFrom the May/June 2011 Issue\n\nJoe Adams writes: \"At the age of 90, I got married again to a cute, young 85-year-old gal named Jeanne Poulin. Thousands of years ago I retired from Bettcher Manufacturing Co. and started an engineering consulting business. I also taught English as a second language and a graduate engineering course at Florida State Univ. I got a master's degree in administration and continued my love for writing humorous verse.\"\n\nRuss Kinne plans to move to midcoast Maine. He writes: \"Connecticut's fine but too warm!\"\n\nAllen Kerr writes: \"My oldest granddaughter, Leigh Thomas, applied to Brown early decision, like my only son, Charles Kerr '78, did in 1974.

His friend, Lori Scinto (Boston College), writes:\"In addition to being a poet of distinction, Richard Nason was my friend and mentor. My parents introduced me to Nason, as my family called him, in 1985, when I was a senior in high school interested in attending Brown. He entertained us over lunch and later gave us a tour of the campus. He was what we New Yorkers would call a real ‘character.’ Nason was a talented person and a brilliant writer. A former staff writer for the New York Times, he found his true calling in poetry. The author of such works as Old Soldiers, Boiled Grass and the Broth of Shoes, and Two Radicals — Unpublished Essays on Jean Genet and Ezra Pound Plus Selected Reviews on Sundry Subjects, Nason was a natural teacher whose encouragement often came in the form of books. When as a high school senior I thought I wanted to be a veterinarian, he sent me a copy of James Herriot’s All Creatures Great and Small. When I studied abroad in Rheims, France, he sent me a copy of George Bernard Shaw’s Joan of Arc, complete with his notes on the book’s lengthy preface, which he called \"the best of its kind in the Twentieth Century.\" And when I informed Richard of my fascination with the thirteen-part PBS miniseries Brideshead Revisited, he sent me a copy of Evelyn Waugh’s great novel, which remains my favorite book today. Although Nason and I never lived in the same city, we stayed in touch through letters and telephone calls. He died too soon to appreciate that he had nurtured someone who will soon be a published scientist. He edited a paper I’d cowritten that will soon appear in an Australian conservation journal. At the time of his death, Nason was working on a third volume about the Roman poet Horace.

He married Connie Finney in 1996. Ed and Connie manage one of the venues at the Sun Valley Jazz Jamboree each October. The doc says Ed will be back on the slopes before long. Stay tuned; bungee jumping could be next!”\n\nFrom the January / February 2000 Issue\n\nPaula DeBlois '89 R.U.E., associate director of alumni relations, reports: \"It is time to celebrate, so make plans now to return to campus for the 50th reunion on May 26-29.

Our close friends Florence and Leon Frank '51, Nanci and Carl Ostroff '49, Avis and Ron Pritzker '49, and Phyllis and Ken Sisson '50, along with everyone's children and grandchildren, arrived at our Cape Cod home for a mini-reunion. Some of the children are Brown alumni, and many little ones aspire to be in the future, as evidenced by their Brown T-shirts. We ate a wonderful lunch and dipped in and out of the lake singing Brown songs and crowding around a wood-carved Bruno on the lawn. The children of the original six 'Brownies' organized the celebration for the parents and the grandchildren. They gave each parent a T-shirt with the inscription, 'From Brown Days to Golden Years-Eternal Friendship.' After a wonderful dinner and exchange of memories, we all agreed that we eagerly await the next reunion. Hail, Brunonia!.\n\nFrom the November / December 1999 Issue\n\nRuss Kinne, Ned Killeen '51, and Bob Peabody held an unusual mini-reunion. As Russ, of New Caanan, Conn., writes: \"Three of us, all proud, loyal Brown men, brought a Grand Banks forty-two-foot trawler yacht up from St. Petersburg, Fla., to Connecticut. The trip went well and was fairly uneventful. But of course, in some 1,500 miles we encountered a wide variety of weather conditions and scenery. Incidentally and coincidentally, we're all former Navy men.\"\n\nRonald Wilson, a graduate of the Veterans College at Brown, wishes to contact fellow alumni of the program to collect their memories and to document the effect it may have had on their subsequent lives.

Swanson writes: \"Just to let friends know I've not disappeared into the desert never to be seen again, or washed away in one of our summer monsoon storms, or driven my Jeep off some remote cliff on one of our more interesting mountain roads. It's a good life out here and, like Providence, Tucson's an easy town to get involved in if you're willing and committed. After four and a half years in Tucson I've gotten thoroughly involved in this community, thanks in part to Rotary. I was recently made vice chairman of a steering committee for the Building the Future project, which is devoted to getting about 100 fourth-grade kids shaped up to be accepted at the University of Arizona. Their school is in a poor, crime-infested neighborhood in Tucson; only two of its graduates have ever made it to college. I've also been nominated to stand for election to the downtown Rotary Club board of directors and have been serving as a grants-review panelist for the Tucson/Pima County Arts Council. And, finally, I'm doing pro bono consulting jobs with two new start-up nonprofit organizations. I'm semi-retired from my consulting work with nonprofit boards but still take on a client now and then and also do a good bit of writing in my field on the Internet. If anyone is interested in our Building the Future project, e-mail me.\n\nFrom the January / February 1999 Issue\n\nBernard J.

I've made several trips to England, Scotland, and Ireland, as well as to Florida, California, and the Southwest. In 1996, I had surgery twice on my vocal cords to remove benign nodules and then learned that I had prostate cancer. Fortunately, it was in an early stage, so I opted for a relatively new treatment which was done in a matter of hours at the Boston Medical Center. I'm happy to report that everything is fine. To celebrate, I took several extended trips last year. After attending the wedding of my niece, Priscilla, daughter of my late brother Bob '38, I hopped a flight to Britain to attend my cousin's wedding and visit a 'special' friend. She accompanied me back to the States, and we flew on to California to attend the wedding of my son Steve '81, in which son Bob '83 was an usher. Still in California, we attended my son Jeff's graduation from Navy Postgraduate School in Monterey in late September. In December, it was back to England to spend the holidays with my friend and her family.\"\n\nFrom the July / August 1998 Issue\n\nHaig Varadian, who retired after serving forty-one years in the Cranston (R.I.) school system, continues to serve as executive director of the New England High School Principals' Association.
