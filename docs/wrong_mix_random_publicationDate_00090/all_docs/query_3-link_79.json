Canadian Identity Analysis To show Canadian identity from my point of view, I decided to draw a map of Canada. As a high school student who is engrossed deeply in physical geography, economics and investing, I decided to focus on natural resources, industries, and recreation development.

Classification And Discussion Of Esterification Results and discussion Esterification extent: The color reaction using hydroxylamine hydrochloride was used with modification to quantify the extent of esterification of proteins and the results showed that the highest level of esterification was recorded for esterified cowpea protein isolate (82%) followed by esterified common bean protein isolate (79%). Functional properties of native and modified proteins: PH solubility profile: The pH solubility curves of native and esterified cowpea protein are shown in Fig.1. The solubility profile of native cowpea indicate that protein solubility reduced as the pH increased from 2 to 4, which corresponding to its isoelectric point, after which subsequent increases in pH increased protein solubility progressively. The minimum solubility for native cowpea (10 %) was at pH 4 which corresponds to its isoelectric point ( IP).The highest protein solubility (80%) was observed at pH 10. Esterification increased protein solubility in the acidic pH range from 2 to 5. Increasing pH more than 5 reduced the solubility and giving a minimum value (9 %) at pH 6. Methylated cowpea protein was more soluble in the acidic range of pH and less soluble in the alkaline range of pH as compared to unmodified protein.

Ethical Issues With Animal Testing More than 115 million animals are used each year for testing (Akhtar). The act of testing on live animals for the purpose of scientific research is called vivisection. According to a nationwide survey of biology educators commissioned by NAVS in 2014, the use of animals as dissection specimens in biology classrooms remains a prevalent practice in the United States, with 84% of pre college biology educators reporting the use of dissection as a teaching tool. The use of vivisection is carried out in middle schools, high schools, and universities. Animals are also used in testing for cosmetics, tox screenings, and xenotransplantation, a process of transplanting organs or tissues between different species . Many creatures around the world are forced into a life in cage where they obliged to endure painful tests. Along with the pain caused by scientists, many of the drugs that prove to be successful in animals aren t in humans. Aside from all, animals do have the right to not be harmed although the Animal Welfare Act doesn t provide much protection. Our country s law refuses to find it necessary to use alternative methods which are also obtainable. Animal testing should be outlawed due to animal rights, ethical issues, alternative ways and its unreliability.

Statistical Methods And Inference Of Study Results Many Empirical Research involve statistical techniques to make reliable interpretation and inference of study results. P values are one of the important techniques used in statistical analysis. Researchers routinely consider a small p value (less than 0.05) to be significant , that is, to have a low probability of obtaining a result that is extreme under the null hypothesis. However, a small p value can also be misleading sometimes and can cause severe problems in the interpretation of study results. In this paper, I will provide a summary of p value followed by explaining how (1) a huge sample size, (2) a homogeneous sample, and (3) heteroscedastic error terms in regression models can lead to a small p value and how to make good use of it. P values are used all over statistics. It is the probability of obtaining an effect at least as extreme as the one in the sample data, assuming the truth of the null hypothesis (Lew, 2012). It depends on a null hypothesis, the data, as well as a statistics with its distribution under the null hypothesis and its ranking showing what is an extreme observation. The first reason for obtaining a small but problematic p value is a huge sample size. If the sample size is large enough, even very small differences may be statistically significant (Lin et al, 2013). For example, suppose we want to test whether there the average GPA of students at University of Michigan is the same for male (M) and female (F). We form the null hypothesis that ...

Regardless, the decline in population may have simply marked a continuation of what was already happening in Britain as according to Waley demographic growth had come to an end before the Black Death had arrived in Europe and that it merely accentuated an existing trend, due to the severe living conditions at the time as a result of poor sanitation and the Great Famine of 1315 17. Inflation and a shortage of labour supply immediately implemented farmers as would likely have not been able to afford to pay for their land due to a loss of rental income from tenants, causing them to lose their land. Many farmers, according to Rubin sought to move away from labour intensive cultivation to more diverse activities such as mining, pasturing and fisheries, as required less care than crops, indicating a turning point in the ways that farmers sought to earn their money. This is supported by Dyer , who analysed the consumption of foodstuffs of harvest workers in Norfolk, to find an intensification in meat consumption to 15% in 1353 from 9% in 1341 and a decrease in bread consumption from 34% in 1341, to 31% in 1353.

The Nielson s genuine compassion for their young makes it exceptionally difficult to lose Marie and Ian later on. When both children are killed in a car accident on the way to school, the chain of misfortune begins to claim the family. Annie, who had the nanny bring the kids to school that morning due to a work commitment, blamed herself for the loss of her children. When the lives of children are taken too soon, it is as if they are cheated of having a chance at life, and the parents are punished for no reason. Upon realizing this, Annie is institutionalized for depression and suicidal tendencies. The film clearly shows Annie s devastation by her appearance. Her long, brown hair is now chopped short and she smokes cigarettes. This physical deterioration coincides with the emotional trauma that occurs when a child dies. The loss of her children infected her heart with an unwarranted guilt that made her question her faith in herself, her religion, and her marriage. When Chris mentions getting a divorce because she is so lifeless, she realizes that losing the only love left in her life would kill her.

The birth of Abraham was approximately in 2166 B.C and the death of Joseph was approximately 1806 B.C. The book was originally written in Hebrew, and its Hebrew name was Bereshith, which means The Beginning . Eventually it was translated from Hebrew to Greek in approximately 250 B.C. One of the purposes of writing Genesis was to trace major historical events from the beginning of time. Many different writers wrote parts of Genesis, but Moses, the messenger of the Lord, received credit for putting it together. Genesis 5:8 states, So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died. It is a mystery to me why not only Seth, but Enosh, Kenan, Noah, and many others lived very long lifespans. After the first flood, people s lifespans decreased dramatically and the Genesis time period became a period of survival. Abraham died of old age at one hundred seventy five years. As the story of Genesis progressed, people s lives became more difficult. They were not technologically or medically advanced. The life span of an average person became pretty small and people fought for survival every day. They fought each other for land and for power. Men worked ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n20. The Government Intervention Of Medicalization Katie Chirco Government Intervention of Medicalization Medicalization is defined as the process by which nonmedical problems become defined and treated as medical problems, usually in the terms of illnesses and disorders. Medicalization consists of using medical terms to define, understand and treat a problem. There are three levels of medicalization: fully medicalized, partially medicalized, and minimally medicalized. Childbirth and death are two examples of a fully medicalized condition. Menopause and drug addiction are examples of problems that are partially medicalized. Domestic abuse and sexual addiction are examples of conditions that are minimally medicalized (Conrad, 1992). However, it is unclear of what exactly determines what level of medicalization a condition falls under. The process of medicalization is very broad and not very consistent from case to case. There are some instances where medical professionals are involved in a condition becoming medicalized, while there are other times where there are no medical professionals involved in the process whatsoever. It was not until the 1970 s that the social issue of medicalization began being debated. It was during this decade where social problems like hyperactivity in children, child abuse and alcoholism all were becoming medicalized (Conrad, 1992). The biggest controversy over this was that many believed that nonmedical issues were inappropriately becoming medicalized. Ever since then, more and ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n21. The Nature Of God With A Physical Presence The nature of God with a physical presence was also Christian dogma during the New Testament times. Early Christian theology, like its close cousin, Jewish theology, was built upon a literal reading of the Hebrew sacred writings (aka Old Testament scriptures) with its habitual use of direct anthropomorphisms. The early Christians in antiquity, like the Jews, were quite comfortable with this anthropomorphist God in whose image and likeness man was created. This would not be the case for long, for within a few centuries the Christians would feel a need to modify this theological concept by adopting, adapting and merging Greek philosophical elements. By the time of the third century theologian, Origen, the concept of God as espoused by Greek philosophers prevailed in the then current Christian theology. The Jews indeed, but also some of our own people, supposed that God should be understood as a man, that is, adorned with human members and human appearance. But the philosophers despise these stories as fabulous and formed in the likeness of poetic fictions. However, as noted above, there were a few Christians, who like the Jews of ancient times, still believed in an anthropomorphic God. There are some still today. Benjamin D. Sommer draws a distinction in the theological implications between the Jewish and Christian concepts of an anthropological deity.

Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... In my opinion, this depiction of the Last Judgment is beautifully rendered and very stylized. The idea of commissioning an enormous fresco, the largest ever painted in that century, depicting the Last Judgment, was probably suggested to Clement VII by the traumatic events that were undermining the unity of Christians at the time. After the pope s death, on September 25, 1534, and only two days after Michelangelo s arrival in Rome, his successor, Paul III Farnese confirmed the commission to Michelangelo, and in April 1535, scaffolding was put up in front of the altar wall. Even before its official unveiling, the Judgment became the target of violent criticisms of a moral character. All that had happened in the church in the years that preceded the Judgment, including the Reformation and the Sack of Rome, had a direct influence on the work s conception: painted on the altar wall, the Last Judgment was to represent humanity face to face with salvation. The first impression I have when faced with the Last Judgment is that of a truly universal event, at the center of which stands the powerful figure of Christ. His raised right hand compels the figures on the left hand side, which are trying to ascend, to be plunged down towards Charon and Minos, the Judge of the Underworld while his left hand is drawing up the chosen people on his right in an irresistible current of strength.

The Effects Of Environmental Degradation On The Environment The human relationship to the environment has evolved over time as humans have made technological advancements and cultural changes. While some may argue that humanity is distant from nature, that could not be further from the truth. While the human relationship to nature is not the same as it may have been in the past, humans still rely on nature for their livelihood. Humans also have a strong impact on nature, and processes which occur in nature, through their actions. In the last decade, the issue of environmental degradation has become a topic of global concern and discussion. This discussion is threading together a narrative that helps the public and scholars better understand the human relationship to the environment. While this push forward in environmental agenda is a good thing, there needs to be an ongoing dialogue which allows for the understanding that environmental degradation is not only a risk to a certain biome, but all of the diversity that exists within a certain region a good example of this being Papua New Guinea. The rainforest of Papua New Guinea are incredibly rich and diverse environments; the rainforest not only houses a wide variety of plant and animal species, but is also home many indigenous groups.

If someone wants to end their life by means of a doctor then they should be allowed to do it. US pathologist Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who by his own admission has assisted 130 people with their own suicides, has been the target of considerable media and government attention. Kevorkian is the leading quot;right to die doctor in the US because of his work providing lethal medication to patients so that they may commit or pursue their own suicides. But the release of a videotape by Kevorkian in January, 1999, showing the physician injecting lethal medication into a patient in Michigan has changed the nature of the controversy from the right to die to medically assisted euthanasia. Kevorkian is charged with murder and faces trial next spring. Dr. Kevorkian is the first known US physician to carry out an act of mercy killing. In conclusion, I think that it is legal for someone to end their life only if they have a certain condition that is un curable or if the person is suffering tremendously.

Reading the bible was expected for the members of society, this included women and children, which was often unheard of (Foner 66) at that time. With their lives being restricted to the word of the bible this left very little leeway for anything other than what was deemed acceptable, and this rigid way of life was another straw that led to the eventual troubles and fervor that took over. The Puritans ultimate goal was for their ideal society, their City Upon A Hill, a model Christian society. According to Dr. Terry Matthew in Puritanism in America They did not come to this country to find a place to practice freedom of worship. Instead, they came to find a place where their true religion could flourish. They wanted to influence more than just their communities and those surrounding, they wanted to influence the Church of England and further in the hopes of purifying those that had strayed from what they deemed as the true and righteous path all by showing the way by their hard fast examples.

Functional losses experienced by the elderly include physical performance, balance, mobility, and muscle strength (Nakano, Otonari, Takara, Carmo Tanaka, 2014, p. 583). Situational or circumstantial losses may be the loss of a partner or the loss of a home due to being transferred into a retirement home or health care facility.

Personally, I think he should have stayed in jail for a much larger time. After he was released in 1875, Tweed was not let off easy. The New York state filed a civil suit against him in order to recover most of the millions of dollars that he had taken from the New York treasury. Tweed was found guilty, AGAIN, and he was arrested, AGAIN. Tweed was taken to a not so serious jail. It was more of an apartment if you ask me. It had two rooms, and a small library where he could pass time and not get bored. Tweed was also allowed to get visits and he had an aide. Tweed even convinced the jail warden to let him go out sometimes and visit relatives and take carriage rides through Central Park. But, it wasn t so easy for Tweed. There were two guards following him everywhere he went, just so he wouldn t escape. So he created an escape plan.
