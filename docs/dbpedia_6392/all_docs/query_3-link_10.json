        "text": "Charged with high-voltage tension and suspense, the electrifying thriller No Way Out is a tightly wound tale of intrigue set in the political whirl of Washington and the inner corridors of the Pentagon. In this ’80s box-office smash, Kevin Costner (The Untouchables, Revenge) stars as naval hero Lieutenant Commander Tom Farrell, the new CIA liaison for Defense Secretary David Brice, a high-ranking master of political maneuvers played by the dynamic Gene Hackman (The Package, Narrow Margin). Sexy Sean Young (Blade Runner) is a gorgeous party girl who plays politics herself as Brice’s mistress and Farrell’s secret lover. And Will Patton (Desperately Seeking Susan) is the Secretary’s ruthless aide, architect of a cover-up scheme that protects his boss, but entraps Farrell, putting his life in danger. With its serpentine plot twists, narrow escapes and true-to-life Pentagon setting, No Way Out is the harrowing story of an innocent man caught in a complex web of romance and murder, power and corruption. Stylishly directed by Roger Donaldson (The Bounty, Species) from Kenneth Fearing’s classic noir novel, The Big Clock. The stellar supporting cast includes Howard Duff (Shakedown), George Dzundza (Basic Instinct) and Fred Thompson (Die Hard 2)."
