        "text": "No Way Out\n\nDear Geographers:\n\nThe most popular DC movie, at least for this issue, is No Way Out, because of its memorably confused geography. We have several other good nominations, but we haven't begun to exhaust the subject. Remember Goldie Hawn falling asleep with her face in her chicken salad in the restaurant on the lower level of Georgetown Park (Best Friends, 1982)? And nobody mentioned Mr. Smith Goes to Washington? And the one review of All the President's Men doesn't mention the gorgeous long zoom shot from the ceiling of the main reading room of the Library of Congress down to the evidence Dustin Hoffman is discovering on one reading desk. So keep writing with your favorite Washington movie moments.\n\nMeanwhile, here's the thing that raised my blood pressure most this week: after explaining that he had neglected to make appointments to the board of the University of the District of Columbia for months because he was searching for just the right people to raise the University's standards and national reputation, Tony Williams nominated the Reverend Willie Wilson. This is the same Reverend Willie Wilson who, just a few years ago, was calling for the heads of Korean shopkeepers to roll down the streets of Ward Eight. It is rhetoric like that which caused the Washington Post, in its article on the nominations to the UDC board, to describe Wilson as outspoken and influential. If Wilson had actually killed a Korean store owner, the Post may have been outraged enough to describe him as controversial, rather than outspoken.\n\nGary Imhoff\n\nthemail@dcwatch.com\n\n###############\n\nFavorite Washington Movie\n\nLeslie Ruskin, shanti@thehelm.com\n\nNo Way Out because it puts a Metro stop right in the middle of Georgetown. What a great idea! No?\n\n###############\n\nDC in the Movies\n\nPhil Greene, pgreene@doc.gov\n\nOn the subject of DC in the movies, I'm reminded of the infamous scenes from No Way Out, the car chase on the Whitehurst Freeway, Kevin Costner somehow getting down to street level and ducking into the very convenient and very non-existent Georgetown Metro, the allegedly Metro trains that certainly were not Metro, the picturesque day trip to Annapolis, 30-some miles to the east, which began by heading west on the GW Parkway (!), and the pay phone at Dulles airport which was labeled Pacific Bell. Of course, far greater cinematic atrocities have been committed in my other hometown, New Orleans, such as the obligatory and omnipresent jazz funerals, non-existent Southern accents or, worse, bad Cajun accents on allegedly native Orleanians, voodoo choked cemeteries within the French Quarter, and other cliches too numerous to mention.\n\n###############\n\nNo Way Out\n\nClare Feinson, cfeinson@erols.com\n\nMy favorite by far is the Kevin Costner movie, No Way Out, where he hops on the non-existent Metro station at Georgetown Park, goes down the stairs to the Baltimore Metro, and gets off at the Old Post Office Pavilion. Ah, the magic of the movies!\n\n###############\n\nWashington Movie Moments\n\nMike Livingston, livingstonm@earthlink.net\n\nIn No Way Out, Kevin Costner leads Gene Hackman's henchpersons on a car chase across the Key Bridge into Georgetown, gets out of his car, runs down the escalator into the Georgetown Metro station (marked by a proper brown Metro station pylon that says Georgetown on it), and emerges in the Old Post Office Pavilion. Neat trick  even better than the restaurant in the same movie affording Costner a physically impossible view of the Washington Monument.\n\n###############\n\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still  1951\n\nChris Shaheen, cshahe@co.arlington.va.us\n\nClassic science fiction movie about the emergence of nuclear power and the demise of the human race. Good street shots of Dupont Circle outside of windows of racing cab. Also, house on 16th Street used as back drop for film still stands, and footage of Walter Reed Hospital. Several street scenes are shot outside of a boarding house on Harvard Street; can't remember address, but tried to find it once and couldn't. So many other shots and dialogue about the city are accurate, I can't imagine why they would have made this address up. I think it was close to 14th Street and blitzed in the post-1968 riot era.\n\nAlso, a good shot overlooking the city from Morris Road, SE, as god-fearing city residents try to flee the city before it is annihilated by alien beings. Other street scenes I could not identify, but if anyone else is obsessed by this film and knows some more locations, please let me know.\n\n###############\n\nWashington Motto\n\nJim Davison, jdavison@dcfra.com\n\nKlaatu Barada Nikto, from the best science fiction movie ever made, The Day the Earth Stood Still.\n\n###############\n\nFavorite DC Movie\n\nGabe Goldberg, gabe@acm.org\n\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still, early 1950s sci-fi classic. Flying saucer lands in DC, alien and robot disembark. Alien (Klaatu) has come to warn Earth to knock off arms race before it becomes interplanetary threat, lest robot (Gort) and his brethren, designated peace keepers, destroy it. Great cast/acting, great scenes of lost Washington. It shows periodically on SciFi channel and elsewhere.\n\n###############\n\nTwo Favorite DC Movies\n\nLee Perkins, lperkins@cpcug.org\n\nD.C. Cab. I was an extra in the crowd as the parade passed the District Building. The Day the Earth Stood Still, when one could live in the 1200 block of Harvard St, NW, without fear for one's life!\n\n###############\n\nIts a Tie\n\nRick Rogers, worthington-rogers@usa.net\n\nTrue Lies and DC Cab are my favorite Washington movies. These are classic pre-new convention center period pieces with demolished Mt. Vernon East landmarks. Oh yeah, in DC Cab, Irene Cara sings that immortal disco hit, The Dream.\n\n###############\n\nRandom Hearts\n\nMatt Borgia, mrb@duke.edu\n\nIt may not have received much critical acclaim, and I've never actually seen it, but Random Hearts holds a particularly interesting memory. One reason: a few scenes were shot at the Department of Commerce, where I work. In fact, a rain scene with Harrison Ford was staged in the interior court yard right outside my office window. I'm not much of a star-gazer, but that was quite an exciting day!\n\n###############\n\nWashington in the Background\n\nEd T. Barron, edtb@aol.com\n\nOne of the best movies for background scenes in Washington and local environs was Arlington Road. There were several shots taken locally. One of the better sequences was the one showing how to get from Reston to downtown D.C. in about ten minutes. The best scene, incredibly realistic, was the demolition of the ugliest of all the downtown buildings, the FBI Headquarters. That scene was so realistic I went downtown to see if the FBI Building was still there.\n\n###############\n\nWashington Movie Moment Favorites\n\nJoan Eisenstodt, jeisen@aol.com\n\nBroadcast News when Holly Hunter gives directions from BWI to the City and earlier, around (or was it really?) Dupont Circle. Reminded me of me with cab drivers! Dave in Adams Morgan; it really was, no fake scenes as they had when they came out of the White House underground! All the movies that portray our fair city seem to miss the mark. How sad they can't show more of it.\n\n###############\n\nDave\n\nAnnie McCormic, amccormic@itic.org\n\nI really liked Dave. It had great scenes of DC and the story was nice.\n\n###############\n\nA Few Good Men\n\nDwight Sterling, dsterling@fabmac.com\n\nFor Washington, D.C., movie moments, my favorite is from A Few Good Men. In the movie, Tom Cruise stops his car in Adams Morgan to buy a newspaper from a newsstand. He not only finds a space right away, right outside the newsstand, but there is so much available parking that he can easily get into a parking space with no need to parallel park.\n\n###############\n\nWashington Movie Favorites\n\nT. Jr. Hardman, thardman@earthops.org\n\nWow. Washington movies ... hard to say. Probably my favorite is Enemy of the State. It has some wonderful shots of places that aren't often filmed, notably in Adams-Morgan. One of my HS alums, Bob Lau, was an extra in that, as well as in Contact, which has some great shots as well. Plus there's Mars Attacks as well (chortle). I'd seriously love to film a car chase scene from Adams Morgan at roughly 18th and Columbia, downhill past the Harvard Street Zoo entrance and up through the alleys around Park Road just east of Rock Creek Park and down 17th Street to Piney Branch Parkway. Now that would be fun.\n\nAlso lots of fun would be filming my own Washington novel (gothic SF of course) which has a lot of great scene/angle potential, especially with respect to lovely Dupont Circle, the nearby Church Ruins Park at 18th and Church Streets, NW, etc. Also totally overlooked in film are some of the Potomac River vistas, and Georgetown University. Plus, nobody has ever  so far as I know  filmed the really spooky stairs under the Key Bridge which are inscribed all hope abandon who enter here at the aqueduct. Also left unfilmed is the bedraggled but potentially spiffy court at 1476 Belmont Street NW, where I was living in 1992 with all of the Russian expatriates, as the USSR imploded, greatly influencing my gothic SF novel. Also desperately needing to be filmed is the R Street Cemetery, P Street Beach, the houses perched precariously on the palisades of Adams Mill Road as seen from near the Bat House at the Zoo, and the view of the city laid out before you at night as you head southwards on 13th NW, and cross Clifton Street to roll down the great hill towards Florida Avenue. Dang. Someone hire me.\n\n###############\n\nAll the Presidents Men\n\nRenee Schwager, renee508@ix.netcom.com\n\nI love All the President's Men for several reasons. One, it was shot the first summer/fall that I lived in Washington (I think it was 1975), and I now live in the condo (The Webster House) where Bob Woodward actually lived while he was doing his investigation of the Watergate break-in, and they filmed the movie there and around 17th & P NW where the Webster House is. The flower pot on the balcony all happened in my condo building (which was a rental property then; converted to condo in 1979). There's an article from the Washington Post about all the little known facts about the Watergate break-in investigation in celebration of the 20th anniversary (http://washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/travel/visitorsguide/tours/scandal/waterga2.htm ) and I'm quoted.\n\nThere are shots of the interior and exterior of the building, but also a few of 17th Street as it looked before the Richmond was built (there was a gas station, a liquor store, right near the pay phone Woodward/Redford uses in the movie). So that's my input. Thanks for the question. I've been lurking for years!\n\n###############\n\nDC Flicks\n\nCarl Bergman@radix.net\n\nI've always wanted to have a DC movie film fest. Not for their plots, but for their take on DC. There are lots. My award for most messed up local montage goes to Hitchcock's Topaz. It opens with a tortured ride through town seen through the rear window. Its drive-by jams in every landmark in bizarre order. I first saw it, I think, at the old Town Theater (Woman's Museum of Art now). The audience was in hysterics. Other memories, Charles Laughton in Advice and Consent boarding one of our dear, doomed street cars. A true case of Washington meeting DC. I also once saw a WWII cheapie called Government Girl. They must have pooled their gas coupons, because it features a wonderful ten minute plus real ride through downtown. Then there's the Alan Alda's Seduction of Joe Tynan. It opens with a great shot through the front window of a school bus headed south on North Capitol Street. As it emerges from a viaduct the Capitol building rises before it. Excellent. Tynan also has a small flaw that caused a good chuckle. Alda goes home to Long Island. He must be really domesticated, because on his patio table in the Hamptons is a one quart carton of Giant Milk. Not a DC connection, but my favorite memory of Tynan is Senator Melvin Douglas lamenting being convicted of old age. Alan Cranston was in the seat in front of us!\n\n###############\n\nDefender Cher\n\nKirsten Sherk, Dupont Circle, ksherk@mindspring.com\n\nOh my, so much to say in response to this one: 1. City movies: ACK! I can't remember the name of this movie, but it starred Cher as a public defender, Dennis Quaid as a prosecutor, and Liam Neeson as a deaf homeless man accused of murder. It came out in the mid-80s, and had more scenes of non-panoramic Washington than any other Washington movie I've seen. The opening shot follows Cher from on her way to work, starting at 9th and Pennsylvania SE and going to the DC Superior Court building. The route wasn't in the right order, but it was the right route, and it really was the court building. To top it off, my mom is in the very first shot, pedaling to work on her bike. Very, very cool. [Suspect, 1987, directed by Peter Yates -- Gary Imhoff]\n\n2. City papers: I feel like I've spent a good portion of my life defending the Washington Post, but now that I've lived in other cities, my convictions are deeper. For my money, there is only one newspaper in the country that is more informative on a wider variety of topics and that's the New York Times. The Wall Street Journal really is a business newspaper that does a decent job of insightful reporting on national and international issues, but with a ridiculously conservative editorial board. My parents get the Wilmington paper, which is also like the Weekly Reader for adults, so they must supplement with the Times. I often debate getting both the Post and the Times for fuller international coverage. But I agree with whomever said that for local coverage, the Washington Times is really very good. (Although the newspaper's overall politics give me the willies!)\n\nOther key points about the Post: $0.25. I love that. So few city papers have managed to keep their newsstand price down. I'm happy to put up with the ridiculous number of adds in the front section if I can pay $.25 for my newspaper. Also, I love that the Post has a sense of humor, and a sophisticated one. Not just the funnies either. It really goes beyond it. The NY Times just takes itself WAY too seriously. 3. City groceries: yeah, it's great that Trader Joes is on the East Coast, but if you don't have a car and you live in the city, it might as well never have arrived. I'd love to have access to Trader Joes, which is smaller but much cheaper than Fresh Fields, but living in the city without a car, I only have access to the Soviet Safeway on 17th Street, and my sweet dreams of the ever-promised Fresh Fields on 14th\n\nand P.\n\n###############\n\nMovies About Washington\n\nMarguerite Arnold, dama@primenet.com\n\nActually there are quite a few movies featuring Washington in new and different ways, but don't look for them at the local cineplex, because those all have very stereotypical post card views of the city. For those of you who don't know, Washington is home to the third largest production community in the country. And a lot of independent filmmakers. These filmmakers, who focus their lenses on quite a few of DC's alternative views, bring new and interesting (and more real) visions of the city to the screen. One of the films that we screened in March of 1999, for example, is a documentary called Rats, which, besides drawing over 1,000 people to the screening, helped move new Mayor Anthony Williams to respond to the rat infestation of the city. That film, by the way, will be playing at the Lincoln Theater in January 2000. For more information, go to http://www.rats-thefilm.com.\n\nAnd for those of you who want to see more of Washington on film from unique and different perspectives, check out Studio 650, the largest venue for independent films produced in this region. We screen monthly at Atlantic Video. We also have the distinction of being the first digital screening venue in the country (a year ahead of Sundance). For more information about the venue itself and screening times, dates and films, go to http://www.studio650.com. The venue is a professional forum (in that it's primarily targeted to working filmmakers) but it's open to the public and free  a $5 donation is suggested to help us cover costs. We screen feature films, documentaries and shorts. We also hold a reception before the films and Q&A sessions afterwards where audience participation is encouraged. See you there.\n\n###############\n\nTwo Page Threes\n\nTom Berry, tom@berrybest.com\n\nToday, 12-15-99, the Washington Post had an article on page 3 of the Metro section telling us that the city's union employee bonus checks will be distributed tomorrow. Pretty quick effort to get those checks out after the nod of approval was given. On page 3 of the 12-15-99 NW Current there was an article about the Eaton teachers limiting their hours to protest the city's mismanagement of their paychecks. Many teachers have not received their checks and others have received checks for less than the correct amount. We're about four months into the current school year. This city sure knows where its priorities lie and how to take care of its own, no?\n\n###############\n\nTrader Joes\n\nKenan Jarboe, kpjarboe@erols.com\n\nI hope that folks will not let up on their campaign to get a Trader Joes on H St NE just because they are moving to Bethesda. For those of us on Capitol Hill, it is easier to get to the Tyson's Corner or Bailey's Crossroads store than getting cross-town to Bethesda. And while they currently may say they have no interested in DC, that could rapidly change. Fresh Fields is rumored to be seriously considering a Capitol Hill site  and Fresh Fields claims that Trade Joes follows them rather closely.\n\n###############\n\nTrader Joes Too\n\nMary Vogel, maryvogel@yahoo.com\n\nFred Davidson should know that he already HAD a Trader Joe's within minutes of Bethesda in Rockville for the last couple years. There's a new one coming to Alexandria too, I understand. My point is that we DC residents should not have to schlepp all the way out to the wealthiest burbs to shop for decent food at reasonable prices like TJ's carries. We need one in DC and their best bet would be to move into an area that is in upwards transition and help with that transition. I suggested 4th and H St., NE, because there are thousands of office workers just across the bridge and more to come, who would be potential customers  and there's the growing Capitol Hill community. I want to suggest that we ask them to play a role in DC's economic development.\n\n###############\n\nA Potential Lose-Lose Situation for the Mayor\n\nEd T. Barron, edtb@aol.com\n\nThere are those who live in the District, thankfully few in percentage terms, who will not get off the Mayor's case on non-critical issues. The latest jab at the Mayor is that he has not yet fulfilled a commitment he made, during the Mayoral Campaign, to be a home owner in the District. Those who are in this minority group who are continually on the Mayor's case (I call them bushwhackers) are just waiting for the mayor to buy his house. Should that home be located anywhere other than in Ward 8, we will once again hear the cry not black enough by these detractors in their criticism of the Mayor.\n\n###############\n\nYellow Light Special\n\nPhil Greene, pgreene@doc.gov\n\nIf you were having a lunchtime espresso at Brother's Coffee, or a martini at Cafe Deluxe, on December 15, and witnessed an accident at Wisconsin and Macomb, that was me, accompanied by \"the other guy,\" an 18 year old Albanian who had the audacity to tell the cop that the roads in Albania were better than ours. That being said, I have a question. I would maintain that I was not at fault, since I was heading northbound through the intersection, and the other driver turned left onto eastbound Macomb into my path, all of this occurring while the light was yellow. I would think that I had the right of way, he turned into me. It appears as if his insurance company, GEICO, might decide that since I entered the intersection after it had turned yellow (I was 20 feet away from the line when it turned yellow, I had no choice but to proceed through, I cannot stop on a dime), and he allegedly was in the intersection already, that I was at fault, because DC law says that it is illegal to enter an intersection with a yellow light. It seems to be an arbitrary enforcement of an arbitrary law, I mean, how could a person possibly stop if the light turned yellow an instant before he entered the intersection? It is not physically possible. Nevertheless, I suspect that this will be GEICO's hide-behind-the-law decision. Question, does anyone know a good traffic lawyer (I'm a trademark lawyer, not much help here) or have any thoughts on this issue? Thanks.\n\n###############\n\nEnd of DCPL Photocopier Vendcards!\n\nMatthew Gilmore, mgilmore@clark.net\n\nAs of December 22, 1999 the use of vendcards will be discontinued. All copies will be made with coins and cash (nickles, dimes, quarters, dollar bills and fives). I don't believe they are refunding money from vendcards either, so come make those copies right now! If you have any questions, call me at 727-1213 and I'll try to get you an answer.\n\n###############\n\nWhy No Metro Stop in Georgetown?\n\nMark Nadel, dctennis17@aol.com\n\nI've often heard that when the Metro system was being planned, the Georgetown community did not want a stop (on the Blue/Orange line) there, because it did not want to be more easily accessible to the poor. Larry Lessig's new book on code as law in cyberspace refers to another use of architecture to achieve a similar discriminatory effect. I was wondering whether anyone knows of any reputable confirmation of this Georgetown Metro myth (In his Pulitizer Prize winning biography of NYC's Robert Moses, Robert Caro charged that Moses intentionally built bridges over new Long Island parkways so as not to permit standard buses to fit under them.)\n\n###############\n\nCLASSIFIEDS  EVENTS\n\nRenew Your Spirit in 2000 at Longview\n\nConnie Ridgway, kaniru@aol.com\n\nWe invite you to renew your spirit at Longview.
