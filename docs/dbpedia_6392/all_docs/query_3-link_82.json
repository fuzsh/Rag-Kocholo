        "text": "Vincent Moretti is one of two main protagonists in A Way Out.\n\nBiography[]\n\nIn-game Description[]\n\nAfter earning a college degree in financing and marrying his high school sweetheart, Vincent settled on a job in banking.\n\nPromises of easy money ended up shattering his whole life when he got drawn into the world of organized crime.\n\nBackground and Early Life[]\n\nVincent was born in 1929. His brother, Gary Moretti, was likely born after him.\n\nVincent worked as a police officer at the bureau. Vincent has problems with his wife, Carol, driven by his split attention between his work and his love.\n\nAt some point, Vincent and his brother Gary take part in a sting operation to apprehend two criminals, Leo Caruso and Harvey, after they had stolen a diamond known as the Black Orlov. Gary, under the guise of a buyer for the Black Orlov, talks with Harvey and Leo while Vincent, the police chief, James, secretly listen to the deal from within a van outside.\n\nEverything appeared to be going according to plan. That is, until Harvey betrays Leo and shoots Gary in the head, taking the Black Orlov and escaping the scene. Vincent and the two officers hear the gunshot and rush into the area where Vincent finds his brother's corpse and an unconscious Leo. Sometime later, while Leo is in interrogation, Vincent determines that Leo will never confess to anything and convinces James to put him undercover in the prison Leo is to be sent to.\n\nEvents of A Way Out[]\n\nIn the opening credits, Vincent is seen in a plane with Leo, then it flashes back to him on the prison bus entering prison.\n\nWhile in prison, he saves Leo multiple times from a hitman and convinces Leo to work with him. He follows Leo’s escape plan as instructed, and they eventually break out with the power of cooperation and friendship.\n\nThey run all through the night, coming across a barebones camp the next day. They catch fish and Vincent tells Leo his cover story as to why he’s in prison.\n\nThey find a farm, get some stylish new clothes, and goof around for a while before discovering and fixing up an old truck. The old couple who own the farm find them and chase them off, but not before calling the cops.\n\nThe ensuing chase leads them down the mountainside and to a river, where Vincent nearly falls to his death at the edge of a waterfall..\n\nWhen they enter the city, they confront one of Harvey's henchmen, Ray, a foreman at a local construction site. They threaten him and beat him up for information about Harvey's whereabouts, leading them to Mexico.\n\nBefore they go to Mexico, they rob a gas station for money to buy guns from one of Leo's contacts. Vincent has them stop at a payphone near a movie theatre so that he can call his contact. The contact tells him that his wife, Carol went into labor and has given birth to a baby girl. After killing a hitman sent by Harvey, Vincent and Leo quickly go to the hospital so that Vincent can meet his daughter for the first time before they fly to Mexico.\n\nThey fly south to Harvey’s compound, kill the man, and get chased back by Harvey’s remaining goons. They arrive back in the states to a set-up, a sting operation waiting on the ground. Vincent and Emily are revealed to be undercover police officers.\n\nLeo is furious at the betrayal, grabs the gun out of Vincent's hand and takes him hostage in order to escape in one of the police cars. With one hand on the wheel and the other pointing the gun at Vincent, Leo yells at Vincent while Vincent desperately tries to get Leo to calm down. Leo loses control of the car and they drive over a bridge and into the river. Leo gets into a nearby boat and Vincent tries to swim to Leo, but Leo starts the engine and sails away before he can reach him.\n\nVincent gets picked up by Emily in a helicopter, and they chase Leo in the boat while Vincent tries to shoot out the boat's engine. Before the boat is destroyed, Leo jumps out of it and runs into a factory. They run into the factory after Leo. Emily confronts Leo but he takes her gun and demands that she leave, saying it's just between him and Vincent. Emily initially refuses but when Leo looks ready to shoot her, she agrees and he lets her go.\n\nVincent and Leo have a huge shootout in the large factory, which ends up with one of them dead.\n\nEndings[]\n\nThere are two ways it can end for Vincent: One where he lives, though this results in Leo's death. Or one where Leo kills Vincent.\n\nIn one ending, Vincent grabs the gun first and shoots Leo in the chest. Both realizing that this is the end, they grab each other's hands until Leo dies from the gunshot. Time passes and Vincent arrives at Linda's trailer to give her the news. Stricken with grief, she kicks him out of her trailer. Afterwards, Vincent goes to make amends with his wife, Carol, and Linda and Alex are shown mourning at Leo's grave.\n\nIn the other ending, Leo reaches the gun first and shoots Vincent in the chest. Realizing he's doomed to die, Vincent asks Leo to deliver a letter to Carol. Later, time passes and Leo is shown with a beard. He reunites with his wife and son before packing up to go. Before he does, he leaves the letter on Carol's doorstep and rings the doorbell but leaves before she sees him. In the epilogue, the Caruso family drive off into the distance and Carol is shown crying at Vincent's funeral as his colleagues perform a 21-gun salute.\n\nIt Takes Two[]\n\nDolls of Vincent and Leo can be found on stands as part of an Easter Egg in the co-op adventure game It Takes Two. May wonders what the dolls are, to which Cody will explain that they are from his favorite video game and that he bought them as a gift for their daughter Rose. Buttons will be next to both of the dolls and by pressing them, either of them will say recorded phrases from their game. If both buttons are pressed at the same time, a cutscene will be triggered that reveals the dolls are apparently alive and aware of what they are.\n\nDuring the cutscene, the Leo doll will express how he is still mad at Vincent for betraying him and seemingly not feeling sorry, Vincent will ask Leo what he will do about it. Leo claims that he will \"Kick [Vincent's] ass\" but Vincent will remind Leo that he cannot since he is a doll and is revealed to be firmly stuck to his stand, much to Leo's frustration.\n\nDeath (Determinant)[]\n\nKilled By[]\n\nLeo Caruso\n\nAfter Vincent betrays Leo and reveals himself to be an undercover police officer, Vincent is taken hostage by Leo who tries to escape in a police car, When the car crashes into a river, Leo tries to escape again and Vincent and Emily give chase. Arriving at a portside warehouse, Vincent offers Leo a deal (a reduced sentence for his help) but Leo refuses and they fight. In the end, if Leo reaches the gun on the rooftop first, he shoots Vincent in the chest. Vincent asks Leo to deliver a letter to Carol, he succumbs to his wounds and dies. His body is later retrieved and buried.\n\nTrivia[]"
