Keating and Mike Ripley\n\n1 – 10 11 – 20 21 – 30 31 – 40 41 – 50 51 – 60 61 – 70 71 – 80 81 – 90 91 – 100\n\nAdrian Muller writes: In the late 1990s I approached the Crime Writers’ Association (CWA) with the suggestion of trying to replicate Dutch arts and current affairs magazine’s Vrij Nederland’s annual Crime & Thriller Guide. Each year it lists every in-print crime and thriller book available in the Netherlands. Crime writer Natasha ‘N.J.’ Cooper, a friend and fellow CWA board-member (and later Chair) took the idea to a contact at The Times. Listing every available crime title proved too ambitious, but for three years the newspaper published a crime supplement, and I am proud to have been its freelance commissioning editor. For the last edition, in September 2000, it was my great pleasure to ask two of the most knowledgeable authors of the genre – H.R.F. ‘Harry’ Keating and Mike Ripley – to put together a list of the hundred best crime titles of the previous century. Initially the idea was that one title for each year would be chosen. However, too many important titles would have been left out so, instead, they went for the best.\n\nSheila Keating, Harry’s widow, and Mike Ripley have kindly given permission for the list to be put up on the CRIMEFEST website.\n\nSheila, also known as actress Sheila Mitchell, has recently written H.R.F. Keating: A Life of Crime, a biography of her multi-talented husband. Not only was Harry a crime writer, he was also a journalist and reviewer, and wrote many books about crime fiction. CRIMEFEST’s award for best publication about crime fiction or genre related (auto)biography is named after Harry.\n\nAs mentioned above, Mike Ripley is one of the most knowledgeable people about crime fiction. His monthly column, reviews and book about golden age thrillers (Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang) are ample proof of that. He is also the award-winning writer of the ‘Angel’ crime novels, and the ‘continuation’ author of Margery Allingham’s classic Albert Campion series. The most recent, Mr Campion’s Séance, is published in June.\n\nPlease note that some of the books are included for free in Amazon’s Kindle Unlimited deal. A free trial may be available.\n\nWhen known – and available – links to drama adaptations on DVD are listed. Please note that UK DVDs will only work on European players and US DVDs will only work on American players, but both will work on region-free players.\n\n100 BEST CRIME NOVELS OF THE 20TH CENTURY\n\nJudges finally agree on the 100 murders most foul\n\nMike Ripley:\n\nHalf the fun of reading a recommended list of books is arguing about the ones that are missing. The worst thing about compiling such a list is having to decide what to leave out, because what­ ever it is, it is almost certainly one of my personal favourites.\n\nBut our target was 100 titles and we have tried to give a cross-section of crime-writing over the century – a century that saw perhaps 50,000 crime novels published in this country. So, in fact, we have listed only 0.2 per cent of the books we could have chosen, but every aspect of crime-writing is there.\n\nYou will find classic murder stories, irritatingly devious whodunnits, gripping thrillers, down-to-earth and superhero spies, policemen in all shapes and sizes, private detectives in even more varied hue, crimes committed in many different countries and as far back as the 12th century.\n\nThe authors listed here are a rum lot, too. One went down on the Titanic, one lived in hotel rooms for 25 years, drinking himself to death. One was, and two are, members of the House of Lords. At least three have worked for the intelligence services and at least two have criminal records that we know about. A handful of authors get more than one mention, but all of them have written more than one good book, so my advice is to start with these, then read their other titles, then read everybody who is not on the list. You will find something to intrigue, mystify, scare, thrill or amuse you. I guarantee it.\n\nAny list of crime fiction that starts with the return of Sherlock Holmes and ends with the death of Inspector Morse must be taken seriously. Yet there is one important omission, which must be rectified right here and now.\n\nThe missing title is The Perfect Murder from 1964, which introduced the gentle Indian detective Inspector Ghote and was written by a man who had been nowhere near India at the time, my co-conspirator on this list: Harry Keating.\n\nH.R.F. Keating:\n\nNEVER say you’ll choose the hundred best of anything. And never say you’ll choose them in collaboration. It can’t be done. One author’s work may be overflowing with one sort of virtue, or two or three, but another will have two or three different virtues. But one thinks one knows what’s a good book, and wants to tell everybody.\n\nI suppose my first virtue would be good writing. What’s that you ask. Producing portraits of people that ring true is part of it, together with stringing words together so that they don’t jar and then making them fire up pictures in reader’s mind that will stay there. Then look for a good mystery: it doesn’t have to be a whodunnit mystery. The best crime books tell us something about the great mystery of human life. More than one Mike Ripley pointed in a different direction from me. Sometimes it wasn’t hard to find a compromise, and sometimes it was. But heat was avoided. How? By a simple system of swapping. If my best goes on, I’ll let your best enter, even though… If you’ll drop that terrible book, I’ll allow that fine book, which seems to irritate you in some way, to slide gently into oblivion.\n\nSo if, casting your eye down our final 100 titles, you find that the eyebrow above is shooting upwards in dismay at some omission, put it down to human error, multiplied by two. We would have liked to name 200 books, even 1,000. But we couldn’t. So it’s ‘E&OE’ – errors and omissions excepted."
