        "text": "If you’ve seen Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, you know the idea of safety emerges at some point.\n\nWith thousands in the arena, it’d be a nightmare if, say, some threat appeared. A serial killer?\n\nThat’s writer/director M. Night Shyamalan’s nightmare scenario.\n\nIn “Trap,” he sends a father and daughter to a Philadelphia arena where they’re going to see her favorite artist, Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan), a Taylor type who has an endless concert with ample opportunity for ticketholders to leave their seats.\n\nThere are so many breaks you wonder if anyone is left in the arena. Dad (Josh Hartnett), though, is looking for a way out (aren’t all dads?). He chats up the merch guy, gets his ID, checks into the employee lounge and discovers there’s a plan to trap the serial killer, called “The Butcher.”\n\nWhy a guy named “The Butcher” would go to a concert (in the afternoon, no less), is anyone’s guess, but it means fewer men to search on the way out.\n\nEarly on, we get the suspicion Hartnett’s Cooper Adams could be hiding something. He makes those “V for Vendetta” faces every now and then and constantly comes up with excuses to leave daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue) alone.\n\nSure enough, there’s reason for dad to devise an exit strategy.\n\nHayley Mills turns up as an expert who knows how serial killers act. She advises plenty of people (mostly with her back to the camera), then becomes a player in the final third of the film.\n\nShyamalan has plenty of plotholes where this could fall in. Riley, for example, gets a chance to go on stage as the “Dreamer Girl.” But if she hadn’t been picked, dad’s next moves would have to be rethought.\n\nSimilarly, when he gets in proximity to Lady Raven, Cooper becomes one of those pests every singer must hate. He keeps asking for more and even gets a moment alone with her in her dressing room. From experience, we can tell you this WOULD NEVER HAPPEN. No matter who wants a private conversation, there’s always a handler nearby.\n\nStill, that sets up the escape route and brings “Trap” to the Adams home where much transpires like an installment of “Scream.”\n\nHartnett doesn’t really fit the Anthony Perkins mode, but he gets more lines here than he has in countless other films. He’s good at pivoting but he’s also good at making a child cringe. When he goes over the line, “Trap” becomes a typical horror film with “Sixth Sense” pretensions.\n\nThat Shyamalan created that original “a-ha” movie only serves to enhance the disappointment with this one.\n\nIt keeps its suspense going for a good hour and then it becomes like a concert with too much “new” music: Bring the hits, not the potential misses.\n\nOf note: Saleka Shyamalan wrote the songs she sings and could land one on the charts if producers pushed it enough. She gives us a sense of what a Taylor-esque singer must be like and isn’t afraid to reach out and touch, even if that touch could be lethal.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Abigail\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Civil War\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\"\n\nMovies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\"\n\nMovies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein”\n\nMovies in a Minute: “The Greatest Night in Pop”\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Wonka\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"May December\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Wish\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\"\n\nMovies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\"\n\nFans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Barbie\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One”\n\nMovies in a Minute: “Joy Ride”\n\nMovies in a Minute: “Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny”\n\nMovies in a Minute: “No Hard Feelings”\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Elemental\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”\n\nMovies in a Minute: “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: “Fast X”\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\"\n\nMovies in a Minute: “Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3”\n\nMovies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?
