There are some little hooks you could use to expand out, like recruitng a bunch of champions to defend Dunk in the trial, but it'd all have to be completely invented for the show. It isn't like HOTD where the characters may be thin but there are lots of story beats to work from - only a handful of things happen in these stories.\n\nAlternatively, I think you could do the entire first story in a premiere episode and then move on to original adventures week to week.

Have they implied thus?\n\nNo but since there are only three stories, and the first one is at most a two part episode really, I was wondering what they are planning to do with this.\n\nMaybe GRRM has a bunch of outlines for stories he'll never get around to that they could adapt?\n\nThere's no way the first story is an entire season, right? Have they implied thus?\n\nIt was announced that it would be 6 episode season. Which I think is just about as far as you can take things before you are padding things way out. 6 episodes feels right.\n\nI some some tweet about the various GoT shows in development, it said one was a Aegon The Conqueror series, has this been announced anywhere or was it just the usual pulling stuff out of their asses tweet?\n\nSupposedly in development but there are (and have been) lots of GoT spin-offs in development that don't make it to production. Most show ideas don't survive the bake off.\n\nIt was announced that it would be 6 episode season. Which I think is just about as far as you can take things before you are padding things way out. 6 episodes feels right.\n\nHmmm... Yeah, maybe that could work. Fill in some gaps, maybe add a couple of extra talking roles, and you can do three seasons-worth of adventures with just what we have now.\n\nSupposedly in development but there are (and have been) lots of GoT spin-offs in development that don't make it to production. Most show ideas don't survive the bake off.\n\nhmph. This is the chapter / period I wanted the most. Well, want.\n\nWell this atleast has source material, the Jon Snow thing was complete fanfic.\n\nDo we know anything about contractual details regarding the whole franchise? Could it be that George only agreed to new shows if they have source material to go by?\n\nDoes this have Dragons?\n\nYes...and also no.\n\nDo we know anything about contractual details regarding the whole franchise? Could it be that George only agreed to new shows if they have source material to go by?\n\nI doubt he has any say with regards to that, but after GoT blew up they probably don't want to piss him off by adapting something he isn't keen on. Like, they shot a whole Long Night pilot with Naomi Watts that was a super prequel series and shelved that project.\n\nBut with HotD success, HBO may be more willing now to adapt stuff with little source material since the franchise is longer so tainted (even if it never really was to begin with).\n\nWhat's so good about this spinoff anyway? I know nothing outside the snippets. Is this more of a knigh/child to protect with some travelling?\n\nIt's a bunch of buddy adventures that are VERY satisfying reads. There's lots of little world building moments, great characters, good plot twists and turns. I dunno, it just works on every level.\n\nWhat's so good about this spinoff anyway? I know nothing outside the snippets. Is this more of a knigh/child to protect with some travelling?\n\nDo you like a good adventure story? Well, that's really the only way to describe the novellas without revealing anything else. It's just good adventuring, usually by our hero stumbling into shit WAY over his head.\n\nI doubt he has any say with regards to that, but after GoT blew up they probably don't want to piss him off by adapting something he isn't keen on.\n\nFrom what we've been told previously, GRRM has to approve any spin-offs.\n\nWhat's so good about this spinoff anyway? I know nothing outside the snippets. Is this more of a knigh/child to protect with some travelling?\n\nIt's kind of a street-level view of the Seven Kingdoms, about a peasant-turned-knight and his squire and their adventures as soldiers for hire (\"hedge knights\", in Westerosi parlance).\n\nDo we know anything about contractual details regarding the whole franchise? Could it be that George only agreed to new shows if they have source material to go by?\n\nHBO has TV rights to everything in ASOIAF.\n\nThey could make absolutely anything they want in the ASOIAF universe whether George has actually written about it or not. For example the Jon Snow show (which I believe will still eventually happen even if we have to wait like for Twin Peaks: The Return) would be completely original work. The proposed Long Night show would've been 99% original material.\n\nGeorge still retains non-TV rights which is why he iss licensing out the material for a play. Which will no doubt make its way into other media forms.\n\nIt's a bunch of buddy adventures that are VERY satisfying reads.

Regardless, I'm there day 1. I'm actually about to start reading the novel. I already know what happens, but it's all about the context and journey lol.\n\nHopefully we get some nice new fleshed out lore dumps.\n\nThis is probably the safest story, along with Robert's Rebellion for HBO to adapt, but I'm curious on how the casual audience will feel about it, since its scale is very small and there's no dragons.

I typically enjoy reading, but this reading is probably my favorite of the story. I know a lot of fans prefer Harry Llyod's reading.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/OdA9LqksThY?si=irHl_E4kawx31N9n\n\nHave they announced casting for Bloodraven? That's the one role I'm most excited to see, outside of the two leads.\n\nDoubt it, since he only appears in the 3rd novella (mentioned only in the 2nd) and I'm pretty sure they're only filming The Hedge Knight (1st) right now.\n\nTargaryen is the Skywalker of GoT.... I'm intersted, but def looking forward to a time when we have Thrones content that isn't related to that family\n\nWell, George didn't write anything that isn't revolving around them in some way and I don't wanna see them come up with shit out of zero source material, so I doubt you will ever see a show in this universe without Targ involvement.\n\nIf the show is just, good men will watch.\n\nThe audiobook of the first story is actually available on YouTube.

I like to save my reading time when I go to the beach. Banged out most of F&B and now up to the Aftermath chapter.
