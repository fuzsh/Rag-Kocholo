        "text": "No Way Out: The Roulette will get a global release on Disney+.\n\nNo Way Out: The Roulette follows Baek Joong Sik, a detective who must protect Kim Kook Ho, a heinous criminal who becomes a target for murder due to the 20-billion-won bounty on his head after his release from prison.\n\nLeading the K-drama is Jo Jin Woong, who plays Baek Joong Sik, a police officer tasked with protecting Kim Kook Ho. Yoo Jae Myung takes on the role of criminal Kim Kook Ho, who has a bounty of 20 billion on his head.\n\nJoining them, Kim Mu Yeol plays Lee Sang Bong, Kim Kook Ho's lawyer. Yeom Jung Ah portrays Ahn Myung Ja, the mayor who exploits Kim Kook Ho to save her political career. Sung Yoo Bin plays Seo Dong Ha, Kim Kook Ho's son and a brilliant violinist burdened by the stigma of being the criminal's child. Greg Hsu makes his K-drama debut with No Way Out: The Roulette in the role of Mr. Smile, a killer.\n\nLee Kwang Soo comes as Yoon Chang Jae, an owner of a slaughterhouse aiming for big money. Lastly, Kim Sung Cheol will be seen as Sung Joon Woo, a young pastor who influences congregants of a large church.\n\nThe main poster gives a dark vibe. Looking straight ahead with determination, Baek Joong Sik piques curiosity as to how he will face the dilemma of protecting the criminal he loathes. Kim Kook Ho, sitting and facing forward, emanates a formidable presence, sparking curiosity about the events unfolding before him as he becomes a target for the hefty bounty. The sharp gazes of Lee Sang Bong and Ahn Myung Ja hint at their dark desires to exploit upheaval for their own benefit.\n\nAdditionally, the enigmatic gaze of Seo Dong Ha, the criminal's son, the cold demeanor of Mr. Smile, and the watchful gazes of Yoon Chang Jae and Sung Joon Woo raise curiosity about their intentions toward Kim Kook Ho.\n\nNo Way Out: The Roulette will be available on Disney+ starting July 31, with two episodes airing every Wednesday."
