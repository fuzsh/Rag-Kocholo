        "text": "The Roundup was a smart refinement of The Outlaws’ cops-vs-gangsters crime thriller into an action-cop punch-em-up tailored to its lead’s unique strengths. And it was an evolution that struck box-office gold, to the tune of “Korea’s top grosser of 2022 and a top-ten spot among the country’s highest grossing films”. The Roundup: No Way Out arrives a year later as a blockbuster victory lap of sorts, doubling down on comedy, action, and villains to luxuriate in what is now a franchise formula of blistering haymakers pounding fools and goons into next week.\n\nIn other words, don’t expect any kind of sequel shake-ups or further evolution across these 100 minutes. That might count as diminishing returns for some: a sequel as…\n\nScore : 7.9/10 ✅\n\nI missed this one last year, forgot about it when it was released on VOD this year, and then realized that I needed to watch it before the fourth one (which, like the previous two entries, was going to be available at Fantasia). And like a complete imbecile, forgot about it again (Urghhhh!!!). I couldn't procrastinate any longer. I had less than 12 hours to do the task. So, the plan was to wake myself up at about 6 AM. Watching it. Eat, shower, leave for work, work all day, go to Fantasia and watch the new chapter.\n\nMission accomplished.\n\nTo me, No Way Out was a slight letdown. All the ingredients were there to make…\n\nThis is the first entry in this series that had to work to win me over. Don't get me wrong: if you're just here to see Ma Dong-seok deliver devastating punches to a gallery of interchangeable criminal lowlifes, then you're going to go home happy. But the third movie in the series that started with 2017's \"The Outlaws\" finds Ma Dong-seok and the filmmakers starting to feel very comfortable in their role...I might suggest a little too​ comfortable.\n\nThis is easily their most commercial and crowd-pleasing installment yet, but it's also lost any element of danger or edge: considering how many characters are stabbed by knives, bludgeoned to death by crowbars, or sliced and diced by a Japanese katana, it's…"
