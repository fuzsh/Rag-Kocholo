        "text": "\"We're going to have to find our own way out.\" Scary! Altitude Films from the UK has revealed the first official trailer for a crazy survival thriller movie called No Way Up, made by a Swiss action director named Claudio F채h. It's expected to arrive in early 2024, with no US release date confirmed so far. No Way Up is a high concept combination of disaster movie and survival thriller. It's not just about a horrifying plane crash, it's about what would happen if a plane crashed into the ocean and somehow people onboard survived in an air pocket as it sunk to the bottom. How insanely scary is that?! The ensemble cast includes Colm Meaney, Phyllis Logan, Sophie McIntosh, Will Attenborough, and Jeremias Amoore. Even though they've revealed a trailer, still no info on when this will be available to watch - hopefully we'll know more soon. Because this looks terrifying enough to make me curious to watch it. A plane crash AND sharks?! Holy sh&!.\n\nHere's the first official trailer (+ poster) for Claudio F채h's No Way Up, direct from YouTube:"
