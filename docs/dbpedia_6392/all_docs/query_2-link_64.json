        "text": "01 of 15\n\n2012 (2009)\n\nIn the years leading up to 2012, there was rampant speculation that cataclysmic events would occur worldwide on Dec. 21, 2012. Roland Emmerich fed into the social phenomenon with this action thriller, which follows a science-fiction novelist (John Cusack) and a geologist (Chiwetel Ejiofor) among others as they try to survive amid devastating earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and floods. It's a fascinating film to watch from some distance in all its grand-scale, over-the-top glory, though its depiction of climate-related disasters wreaking havoc on the world is as relevant as ever. —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch 2012: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Roland Emmerich\n\nCast: John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, Thandiwe Newton, Danny Glover, Woody Harrelson\n\nRelated content: 2012 won't be the end after all\n\n02 of 15\n\nBoth Sides of the Blade (2022)\n\nFrom the director of Beau Travail comes Both Sides of the Blade, a French romantic drama and erotic thriller about a woman named Sara whose life takes a turn after she reconnects with a former lover, who also happens to be her partner of ten years’ best friend. A love triangle gone wrong, the film offers beautiful cinematic composition and masterful direction, courtesy of Claire Denis. Also notable for being shot during the pandemic, Both Sides of the Blade is one of the few film projects that chose to make Covid 19 a reality in the characters' world, without making it a central focus of the story. Well-received by both critics and audiences — though deeply overshadowed by Everything Everywhere All at Once, which was released around the same time in France — Both Sides of the Blade is a middle-aged love story and another opportunity to watch Juliette Binoche shine on screen. —Ilana Gordon\n\nWhere to watch Both Sides of the Blade: Hulu\n\nDirector: Claire Denis\n\nCast: Juliette Binoche, Vincent Lindon, Grégoire Colin, Bulle Ogier, Issa Perica, Alice Houri, Mati Diop, Bruno Podalydès, Lola Créton, Richard Courcet\n\nRelated content: Claire Denis and Zadie Smith are making a sci-fi space film together\n\n03 of 15\n\nFresh (2022)\n\nGiven that the title sequence doesn't begin until 30 minutes into the film, Fresh may start out like a rom-com, right down to the meet-cute in a grocery store. But by the time you're actually invested in the apparently burgeoning romance between the equally excellent Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan as Noa and Steve, things take a turn for the markedly sinister as Noa's dream guy transforms into something quite different. Hot off the press at Sundance, EW's critic deems Fresh \"a clever, gory metaphor for the seemingly endless horrors of modern romance rooted in a plot twist just outrageous enough to plausibly be true.\" To say anything else would spoil the fun, so we'll just say that the film's title is more than apt. —Gwen Inhat\n\nWhere to watch Fresh: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Mimi Cave\n\nCast: Daisy Edgar-Jones, Sebastian Stan, Jonica T. Gibbs, Charlotte Le Bon, Andrea Bang\n\nRelated content: Watch Sebastian Stan dance with a VERY big knife in his Fresh audition tape\n\n04 of 15\n\nA Haunting in Venice (2023)\n\nKenneth Branagh's third Agatha Christie murder mystery adaptation is his best thus far. While Murder on the Orient Express (2017) and Death on the Nile (2022) had their old-school diverting charms, A Haunting in Venice finds the director/star playing with visuals and horror tropes while telling a more streamlined story. The film takes place primarily at a Venetian palazzo, where guests (including Branagh's mustachioed detective, Hercule Poirot) have gathered for a Halloween party. After a spooky séance reveals that the party host's deceased daughter was, in fact, murdered, another guest ends up dead later that night, prompting Poirot to investigate. EW's critic calls A Haunting in Venice \"just a heck of a lot of fun, from its eerie Venetian mask costumes to the intriguing ways in which its central mysteries unfold.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch A Haunting in Venice: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Kenneth Branagh\n\nCast: Kenneth Branagh, Tina Fey, Jamie Dornan, Kelly Reilly, Michelle Yeoh, Jude Hill, Camille Cottin, Kyle Allen, Ali Khan, Emma Laird, Riccardo Scamarcio\n\nRelated content: How A Haunting in Venice injected horror into the Agatha Christie movie franchise\n\n05 of 15\n\nHow to Blow Up a Pipeline (2022)\n\nBased on Andreas Malm's controversial book of the same name, How to Blow Up a Pipeline follows a group of young climate activists who plan to destroy an oil pipeline in West Texas to prompt more immediate action in addressing the climate crisis. One wrong step could risk being caught by authorities, or even putting themselves in harm's way. Unfolding with the tension of a heist movie, the film doesn't just entertain as an action thriller but also gives valid reasons as to what led each activist to take such drastic measures in the hope of saving the planet. The film also raises questions about whether such actions are effective in prompting change, while presenting its characters as complex humans. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch How to Blow Up a Pipeline: Hulu\n\nDirector: Daniel Goldhaber\n\nCast: Ariela Barer, Kristine Froseth, Lukas Gage, Forrest Goodluck, Sasha Lane, Jayme Lawson, Marcus Scribner, Jake Weary\n\nRelated content: Riley Keough, Sasha Lane talk crazy summer filming American Honey\n\n06 of 15\n\nMoney Monster (2016)\n\nThis crime thriller takes place on the set of a successful finance TV show, where a hostage situation has everyone on edge. Charismatic host Lee Gates (George Clooney) had previously endorsed a company on the air which disgruntled viewer Kyle (Jack O'Connell) then invested his life savings in, only to lose all of it. Kyle enters the studio with a gun, putting an explosive vest on Lee and asking him to explain himself or risk his life. Directed by Jodie Foster and costarring Julia Roberts as Lee's producer, Money Monster is compelling in its ticking-clock tension. \"As a solid B-movie elevated by A-list talent and pushed along by a brisk running time,\" EW's critic writes, \"Money has its own rewards.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Money Monster: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jodie Foster\n\nCast: George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Jack O'Connell, Dominic West, Caitríona Balfe, Giancarlo Esposito\n\nRelated content: Money Monster: George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Jodie Foster and the lessons of fame\n\n07 of 15\n\nThe Nightingale (2019)\n\nA brutal and affecting revenge thriller set in 1825 in the Tasmanian outback, The Nightingale is a difficult watch, but not a gratuitous one. While the film does feature a hefty amount of sexual and run-of-the-mill violence, the moments of tenderness between the film’s leads — an Irish convict named Clare who is seeking revenge on a British officer for wrongs committed against her family and an Aboriginal tracker named Mangana who is traumatized by the way the British have treated his people — are well-earned and beautifully acted. Chilling and horrifying, the plot is propelled by moments of sadism, many of them committed by a Lieutenant named Hawkins (Sam Claflin) whose psychopathic behavior will quickly erase any memories you have of him in The Hunger Games or Daisy Jones & the Six. A film as raw as the terrain Clare and Mangana must navigate on their journey, The Nightingale isn’t for everyone, but if you make it until the end, it will stick with you forever. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Nightingale: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jennifer Kent\n\nCast: Aisling Franciosi, Sam Claflin, Baykali Ganambarr, Damon Herriman, Harry Greenwood, Ewen Leslie, Charlie Shotwell, Michael Sheasby\n\nRelated content: The Nightingale director knows the film is 'a very tough experience.' That's the point.\n\n08 of 15\n\nOfficial Secrets (2019)\n\nMore than two decades have passed since the United States invaded Iraq under false pretenses. That’s just enough time for the public to have forgotten the true story of Katharine Gun — if they even heard about it at all. A British linguist turned whistleblower who leaked an email to the press requesting help gathering intelligence on specific diplomats in an effort to pressure them into supporting the Iraq invasion, Gun tried to do what she thought was right and was charged with violating Britain’s Official Secrets Act. A ripped from the headlines thriller that tracks Gun’s (Keira Knightley) experiences with the British government in the wake of her decision, EW’s critic writes, “it’s hard not to be moved by the singular passion of a woman who effectively dismantled her own life — not just to salve her conscience but to save, as she saw it, the soul of a nation.” —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Official Secrets: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gavin Hood\n\nCast: Keira Knightley, Matt Smith, Matthew Goode, Rhys Ifans, Adam Bakri, Ralph Fiennes\n\nRelated content: Keira Knightley talks playing a whistleblower with a sense of moral clarity in Official Secrets\n\n09 of 15\n\nPersonal Shopper (2017)\n\nTwins have a unique connection on Earth, but does that bond extend into the afterlife? Director Olivier Assayas explores this idea in his supernatural, psychological thriller Personal Shopper. Kristen Stewart stars as Maureen, an American living in Paris and working for a supermodel named Kyra. Maureen is also mourning the death of her twin brother Lewis, a self-professed medium who died from a genetic condition and promised to contact her from the other side. As she waits for his supernatural signal, Maureen finds herself experiencing other apparitions, all of which are heightened after she is involved in a homicidal investigation. EW’s critic writes that “Stewart, who appears in nearly every scene, is intensely watchable, a coiled spring.” A ghost story about the heartbreaks that haunt us and the moments when we wonder if we’re ever truly alone on this astral plane, Personal Shopper is fashionably spooky, suspenseful, and beautifully acted. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Personal Shopper: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Olivier Assayas\n\nCast: Kristen Stewart, Lars Eidinger, Sigrid Bouaziz, Anders Danielsen Lie, Ty Olwin, Hammou Graia, Nora von Waldstatten, Benjamin Biolay, Audrey Bonnet, Pascal Rambert\n\nRelated content: Personal Shopper director Olivier Assayas says Kristen Stewart 'gave life' to the movie\n\n10 of 15\n\nPig (2021)\n\nBy his own admission, Nicolas Cage has taken a lot of roles in recent years just to cover the bills. But every once in a while, he still shows why he's an Oscar winner, like in 2021's Pig, where he delivers one of his most impressive performances in years. Cage is mesmerizing as a hermit ex-chef who actually has a heartwarming symbiotic relationship with his prize truffle-hunting pig. When that pig gets stolen, you'd expect him to go on a revenge spree not unlike that in Mandy (another stellar project of Cage's). Instead, his emotional submersion into the character (and his unabashed affection for his pig) takes the standard revenge story and turns it into a parable about life, loss, and the importance of fighting for what we love most. Also, the title character is the greatest porcine actor since Babe. —G.I.\n\nWhere to watch Pig: Hulu\n\nEW grade: N/A\n\nDirector: Michael Sarnoski\n\nCast: Nicolas Cage, Alex Wolff, Adam Arkin, Cassandra Violet\n\nRelated content: Nominated for nothing: The Oscars did Nicolas Cage's Pig dirty\n\n11 of 15\n\nPrey (2022)\n\nThe Predator monster has terrified audiences for more than 35 years, but in the story's prequel and fifth installment, the tables turn and the monster becomes the prey. The film follows Naru (Amber Midthunder), a Comanche warrior with the heart of a hunter, who seeks to prove her skills and protect her tribe by catching a predator. Professional basketball player-turned-horror star Dane DiLiegro plays the film's eponymous villain and says the story is strong enough to win viewers over, even without its affiliation to the beloved horror franchise. In an interview, he tells EW, \"There just happens to be a Predator involved. Honestly, you could have shot this movie with a different monster and it still probably would have worked.\" If you're in the market for a solid thriller that still makes time to flesh out its main characters, sink your teeth into Prey. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Prey: Hulu\n\nEW grade: N/A\n\nDirector: Dan Trachtenberg\n\nCast: Amber Midthunder, Dane DiLiegro, Dakota Beavers, Michelle Thrush, Harlan Blayne Kytwayhat\n\nRelated content: Prey star Amber Midthunder loves proving film's haters wrong: 'People can eat their words'\n\n12 of 15\n\nResurrection (2022)\n\nRebecca Hall delivers a tour de force in this psychological thriller about a woman unraveling. Hall plays Margaret, a businesswoman who unexpectedly reunites with her abusive ex-boyfriend, David (Tim Roth), causing her to panic. We learn that she and David had a son together, and what happened to him became an unspeakable secret. As Margaret grapples with David's return, her college-age daughter fears Margaret isn't in her right mind. Gripping and gonzo in concept, Resurrection is another strong entry in the paranoid thriller genre that proves why Hall is one of the most underrated actors working today — as demonstrated by her mesmerizing seven-minute monologue in which she details to a co-worker the extent of the abuse she experienced. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Resurrection: Hulu\n\nDirector: Andrew Semans\n\nCast: Rebecca Hall, Grace Kaufman, Michael Esper, Tim Roth\n\nRelated content: Rebecca Hall wants to make audiences 'squirm' with horror-thriller Resurrection\n\n13 of 15\n\nRun (2020)\n\nOne of the more recent psychological horror thriller films on this list, Run follows the relationship between a parent and her 17-year-old daughter. On the surface, Diane (Sarah Paulson) seems like the perfect mother: Her daughter Chloe (Kiera Allen) was born with health issues, and Diane has devoted her life to homeschooling and taking care of her. But now that Chloe is applying to colleges and on the brink of setting off into the real world, she begins to notice that Diane's love may be masking secrets that Chloe could never dream of. And the more Chloe learns about herself and her mother, the more danger she finds herself in. A suspenseful thriller that deals in themes of parental love, control, and what happens when the umbilical cord is cut too late, Run owes its success to the commitment of its stars. Newcomer Allen is a joy to watch, but it's Paulson who, as EW's critic writes, puts a \"sweeter face\" on depravity. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Run: Hulu\n\nDirector: Aneesh Chaganty\n\nCast: Sarah Paulson, Kiera Allen\n\nRelated content: Sarah Paulson was advised to hide her relationship with Holland Taylor\n\n14 of 15\n\nSanctuary (2023)\n\nMargaret Qualley and Christopher Abbott are the only stars of this taut psychological thriller. Qualley plays Rebecca, a woman interviewing Abbott's Hal at a hotel for a CEO position; as the film soon reveals, however, Rebecca is actually Hal's dominatrix, and this was all part of a carefully planned script. Hal breaks the news to Rebecca that because he's about to inherit his father's company, they have to end their arrangement. This enrages Rebecca, who demands half his new salary and the pair engage in a battle for control. Unfolding with simmering suspense, Sanctuary is a scintillating thriller about sex and power, evoking Steven Soderbergh's Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989), ironically starring Qualley's mother, Andie MacDowell. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Sanctuary: Hulu\n\nDirector: Zachary Wigon\n\nCast: Margaret Qualley, Christopher Abbott\n\nRelated content: Margaret Qualley and Christopher Abbott on their twisted but playful S&M rom-com Sanctuary\n\n15 of 15\n\nThoroughbreds (2018)\n\nThis entrancing indie thriller follows a pair of teenage girls who conspire to get away with murder. Academic-minded Lily (Anya Taylor-Joy) is living in suburban Connecticut with her mother and a stepfather she despises. She hopes to murder her stepfather and enlists her coldly unemotional friend Amanda (Olivia Cooke) to help her. They intend to get a drug dealer they know to kill him, but it doesn't work out and Lily must get more creative to execute her plan without a hitch. Darkly comedic in tone, Thoroughbreds is \"a fun, sharp shock of a movie,\" EW's critic writes, \"a poison dart with its own black little heart.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Thoroughbreds: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Cory Finley\n\nCast: Anya Taylor-Joy, Olivia Cooke, Anton Yelchin, Paul Sparks, Francie Swift\n\nRelated content: Thoroughbreds: Inside 28-year-old Cory Finley's sadistic, brilliant debut"
