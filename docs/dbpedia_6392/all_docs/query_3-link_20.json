        "text": "There's something so inherently satisfying about watching Don Lee knock wrong doers out. He embodies a raw power so many men (and possibly women) crave. He's like if The Thing from the Fantastic Four was less cornflake like and more Korean. He's a nonstop juggernaut of take-no-shit'ness where his choice to use violence is always the right choice. Where characters like Axel Foley or even Batman might try to think their way out of a predicament or perhaps use charm to weasel their way around a particular villain, Ma Seok-do slaps the shit out of them. To say it's art is an understatement.\n\nAnd so here we are, with the third film in The Roundup series. I'll be the first to say I love the first two. And nothing's changed with the third film. The Roundup: No Way Out is a perfect cop thriller that balances brutal violence, investigative police stuff and genuine laughs with an absolutely masterful hand. The fact the film fluctuates between these elements is a testament to both the director and the writers. It reminds me of the aforementioned Eddie Murphy vehicles, Beverly Hills Cop. It's gritty and raw but it's oh-so-fun and, more importantly, FUNNY.\n\nThe plot is nicely complex but not too complex. A drug dealer has asked a certain someone to package up his product so he can sell it to the Chinese. The problem is that said drug dealer has essentially stolen the product from the Yakuza. To make matters worse someone then steals all the drugs which results in both the Korean drug dealers and the Yakuza tracking him down. Along the way, the Koreans and Yakuza cross paths and violence ensues. In the meantime, our favorite detective, Ma Seok-do, is trying to solve exactly what's going on. There's an early twist in the film but I won't go into that.\n\nIt's a standard cat-and-mouse film where bad guys fight bad guys and good guys fight bad guys. In fact, they really upped the action levels in this one as there are PLENTY of fisticuff bouts peppered throughout.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the fight choreography does nothing new. Ma Seok-do is a boxer. He dodges and weaves and then knocks people out. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. But it never gets boring. Every single time he takes someone's head off, it's a joy. It's partly down to how the camera captures the violence and partly down to the absolutely thudding sound design. For me, this is some of the best action of 2023.\n\nThe Roundp: No Way Out is a \"for the boys\" film. Don't get me wrong, the ladies will love it too (I'm pretty sure my wife secretly fancies Don Lee. And rightly so), but it really caters to the male fantasy of being the ultimate powerhouse. When Ma Seok-do is let off the leash, he's ustoppable. He's all attitude and punches. That's it. It's a beautiful thing.\n\nThe story unfolds at a perfect pace and never seems to slow down or encounter a lull. This really is superb storytelling. And of course, it all leads to a fist heavy final act. Just what we all want. The Roundup: No Way Out is a must watch for action fans and those that just love a good crime film. It caters to all audiences. I'd recommend getting your hands on it."
