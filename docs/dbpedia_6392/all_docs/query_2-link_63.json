        "text": "We based this list on the “escapism”, where characters are stuck in one location and must solve complex puzzles or mysteries to save their life and get out.\n\nBased on the escapism nature, most of the films are thrillers or horrors but be sure, not all escape rooms are like that. In reality, they are less scary and the game it’s more about the adventure, team play and fun with friends.\n\nSo here we go!\n\nEscape room (2019)\n\n6 strangers find themselves in a maze of mystery rooms and must use their brains to survive. Interesting to watch how people with different backgrounds find out how closely they can be tied together.\n\nGerald’s Game (2017)\n\nA couple tries to spice up their marriage in a remote lake house. After the husband dies unexpectedly, the wife is left handcuffed to the bed frame and must fight to survive and break free. Will she be able to escape?\n\nInfinity Chamber (2016)\n\nA man trapped in an automated prison must outsmart a computer to escape. Simply and not overly futuristic, this movie is a nail-biter.\n\nExam (2009)\n\nEight candidates are fighting for a highly desirable corporate job. They are locked together in an exam room and given the final test. Follow the set of 3 rules and answer 1 question. Sounds easy, but what is the question?\n\nBreathing room (2008)\n\nWoke up in a room with 13 strangers, tagged with numbers, Tonya discovers that she is the final contestant in a deadly game. Hidden clues reveal more about each player and there is no-one to trust. Either they kill each other or they all will be killed together.\n\nFermat’s room (2007)\n\n4 mathematicians are invited to a party to solve an enigma. Once there, they are locked in a mechanically shrinking room. The mysterious host gives them 1 minute to solve each puzzle to survive while also figuring out why they’re there.\n\nHouse of 9 (2005)\n\n9 strangers, with no apparent connection, are kidnapped: drugged and sealed in a house together. Controlled by a mysterious voice they must obey instruction or they will die.\n\nSaw (2004)\n\nThe most famous escape room movie, where participants must follow instructions and participate in killer’s game. The price for solving the cruel puzzle is always high and a chance to escape very little. We would dare to say this movie is iconic as it inspires horror movie producers to this day.\n\nPanic room (2002)\n\nMother and daughter moved to a new house but must use a panic room when three men break-in searching for a missing fortune. The mother must find a way to get help and save her daughter.\n\nHouse on Haunted Hill (1999)\n\nEasy way to get rich always has a catch! An amusement park mogul Mr Price offers a group of people $1,000,000 to spend the night in a haunted house. However, soon becomes evident that not all the scares are set by the eccentric host himself. Can there be a ghost?\n\nCube (1997)\n\nCube is one of the most original sci-fi drama ever created. 6 individuals are involuntarily placed in an endless maze full of deadly traps. Many rooms linked together with no visible way out are frustrating and deadly.\n\nWe organised our choices from the newest to the oldest, and it’s up to you to decide which one is the best. Let us know in the comments below what do you think."
