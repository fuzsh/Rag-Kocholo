Tim Burton's Academy Award-nominated, bittersweet fantasy tells the story of Edward (Johnny Depp), a young man assembled by an eccentric inventor (Vincent Price), who dies before he can finish his creation, leaving him with scissors in place of hands. When a kindly Avon lady (Dianne Wiest) comes calling and discovers Edward all alone, she brings him home to live with her family in the pastel "paradise" of suburbia, where he falls for Peg's teen daughter (Winona Ryder). Edward's sweet helpfulness and exceptional talents in dog grooming, hair cutting, and topiary sculpture make him popular in the neighborhoodâ€”but the mood swiftly turns against him.
