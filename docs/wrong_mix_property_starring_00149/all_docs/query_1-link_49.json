It also emerges from his acknowledged proclivity for character-overnarrative-driven films. The aim here is to reframe analyses of Burton’s work and provide insights into his somatic sensibilities to filmmaking by employing the ‘body’ as a central organising theme. At the same time, the book employs rigorous theoretical underpinning and a range of methodologies from a variety of disciplines as relevant to each aspect of character/film or group of films, simultaneously examining Burton’s mainstream works as well as some lesserknown productions. While the overall approach involves textual readings, this collection of international scholarship on the theme of bodies has the added insight and experience of a crew member involved with Corpse Bride (2005), as well as animal studies’ perspectives on the representation of creaturely beings. Bodies are central to Burton’s films in ways that exceed their obvious necessity to narrative. In considering the array of anomalous, extraordinary and transgressive beings that pervade his canon, this study broadens the focus of living forms to include animated, creaturely, corporeal and Gothic bodies. Fundamentally, Burton celebrates the body, whether human, animal, animated or anthropomorphised, and more particularly if it is in some way unusual or off-kilter. Therefore, as well as often subordinating narrative to distinctive visual design, for which he is noted, he also prioritises the physicality of characters. His productions, either as director or producer, span short\n\n1\n\nstella hockenhull and fran pheasant-kelly\n\nfilm and music video to theatrical releases, his earliest work including several short films, ranging from The Island of Dr Agor (1971), Vincent (1982) and Frankenweenie (1984) to the later Stainboy (2000). Burton has also been involved in television, directing Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Jar (season 1, episode 19) (1986) and Faerie Tale Theatre: Aladdin and his Wonderful Lamp (season 5, episode 1) (1986), as well as several commercials, including a French chewing gum advert (1998) and two for Timex-1-Control watches (2000). Aside from music videos for The Killers (directed in 2006 and 2012), Burton is best known for his cinematic directorial output, with nineteen major productions to date (although, despite his role as producer for The Nightmare Before Christmas (Selick 1993), this film is usually attributed to him). The first of these was Pee-wee’s Big Adventure (1985) and thereafter followed a series of commercially successful and critically acclaimed films, his most recent enterprises including Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children (2016) and Dumbo (2019). He has achieved Academy Award nominations for Corpse Bride and Frankenweenie (2012) and won numerous other awards as well as attaining worldwide box office figures totalling $4.447 billion approximately to date. The most lucrative was Alice in Wonderland (2010), which earned over a billion dollars worldwide.1 The Body in Film Scientific Bodies In contextualising Burton’s filmic affinity for physical form there follows an overview of key academic studies and trends as they relate to the body in cinema and visual culture, although it is beyond the scope of this volume to consider all previous discourse published in this field. Burton’s fixation with bodily-ness, discernible in his earliest films, corresponds to a broader Western cultural obsession with the nuances of physicality that has emerged in the past fifty years, hereafter referred to as ‘the bodily turn’. Although such a phenomenon is already noted by other scholars (Brophy 1986; Boss 1986; Cooter 2010), there is limited discussion of its extent or its possible causes. Nonetheless, Bryan Turner does identify a more long-standing ‘somatic society’ in social theory (1996: 6) and Mariam Fraser and Monica Greco suggest that the 1980s is a threshold for thinking about the body (2005: 3). Arguably, this bodily turn results from the intersection of various medical, socio-cultural and political factors that coincided in the early 1970s. Even before this revived focus on the corporeal being, however, the body has always been a source of fascination and scrutiny and, prior to the invention of cinema, audiences gathered for public displays of execution and anatomy (Stephens 2011). The development of cinema facilitated this affinity for the corporeal, with the\n\n2\n\nintroduction\n\nsocio-cultural, technological and political zeitgeist at any given moment dictating how the body is contemporaneously represented. Initially, it was at the centre of documentaries and a ‘cinema of attractions’, which was characterised by novelty and shock that usually involved the spectacle of human figures, and often afforded the same morbid pre-cinema aspects of gazing at the dead and the executed. In this vein, Marina Dahlquist, Doron Gaili, Jan Olsson and Valentine Robert’s anthology Corporeality in Early Cinema (2018), which traces the ‘Body Under the Scalpel’ through to ‘Death by a Thousand Cuts’, documents early photographic and cinematic records of ‘mental patients’, nudity, indigenous cultures, dance and sports performers and strongmen, as well as images of death and dying. The late nineteenth century also witnessed the recording of human and animal motion in the sequential photography of Eadweard Muybridge and Jules Etienne Marey, their imagery effectively functioning as a precursor to early cinema, with the subject of the human form in motion captured by Jonathan Auerbach (2007) in Body Shots: Early Cinema’s Incarnations. Lisa Cartwright (1995) too reports on early cinema’s recording of animals, albeit from a scientific perspective that focuses on physiological experimentation rather than motion. In charting medicine’s visual culture, she goes on to consider the human body as object of the medical gaze. In a related way, Tim Boon (2008) analyses public health and scientific documentaries, with examples including the microscopic body, natural history subjects, children’s bodies in vaccination promotion campaigns and malnourished bodies in the post-Depression era. Other scientific approaches to physicality in film are wide-ranging and include Anneka Smelik’s (2010) collection which centres on more contemporary interfaces between science and visual culture. For instance, an essay by Michel van Dartel examines ‘haptic visuality’ in its scientific form whereby vision is substituted with vibration on the skin (2010: 126). Also reflecting recent scientific development with regard to onscreen bodies, Jackie Stacey examines the ‘cinematic life of the gene’ (2010) whereby she considers the effect of genetic engineering and cloning on filmic imagery. Relatedly, while not focusing solely on film, Susan Squier (2004) explores the interactions, influences and overlaps between culture and science. Circuses, Freakshows and Performing Bodies Especially relevant to Burton’s filmmaking and connected to the aforementioned cinema of attractions are those films that centre on bodily deformity and aberration, such as Tod Browning’s Freaks (1932) and David Lynch’s The Elephant Man (1980). Scholarship on the extraordinary and anomalous body, which has increased in recent decades partly owing to the bodily turn, includes work by Rosemarie Garland Thomson (1996; 1997), Rachel Adams (2001) and Angela Smith (2011), and associated analysis of circus bodies (Tait\n\n3\n\nstella hockenhull and fran pheasant-kelly\n\n2005; Tait and Lavers 2016). Correspondingly, Adrienne McLean’s (2008) study of ballet, the body and narrative cinema traces the history of dance from the early studio days through to the post-studio era. It considers aspects such as the embodiment of the eponymous red shoes in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s The Red Shoes (1948) as an aspect of compulsive behaviour (McLean 2008: 152) and their association with promotional material involving ‘long legs’ (McLean 2008: 166), as well as investigating aspects of gender and sexuality concomitant with ballet. Animal bodies, particularly those belonging to circuses, are also a noticeable feature of Burton’s films and have recently come to the fore in scholarship generally, with significant works including Primate Visions (Haraway 1990), Simians, Cyborgs, and Women (Haraway 1991), The Selfish Gene (Dawkins 2006), Ethics and Animals (Gruen 2011) and Animal Liberation (Singer 2015). Those works addressing a specific film and visual cultural context comprise Popular Media and Animals (2011), Beyond Human (2012) and Animals, Anthropomorphism and Mediated Encounters (2019) authored by Claire Parkinson (formerly Molloy), a contributor to this collection. Other recent studies of animals in visual culture include Picturing the Beast (Baker 2001), The Animated Bestiary (Wells 2009), Creaturely Poetics (Pick 2011), Animal Life: The Moving Image (Lawrence and McMahon 2015), Screening the Nonhuman (George and Schatz 2016) and Deleuze and the Animal (Gardner and MacCormack 2017). Bodies of War Of less importance to a consideration of bodies in Burton’s outputs are those works countenancing the representation of the body at war. While Burton does include abject visuals, and a theme of death underpins many of his films, these invariably involve surreal or fantastic circumstance and are removed from real images of the wartime body. In the latter respect, Susan Sontag (2003) debates the response to images of horror arising from news footage of warfare and its aftermath, while there is extensive study of documentary imagery arising from the Holocaust, including works by Oren Stier (2015) and Sander Gilman (2003). Karl Schoonover (2012) examines the spatial relations involved in Italian Neorealism between the imperilled body of the sufferer and the spectator and ‘is focused on internationalising pity’s spatial order [whereby] for neorealism, corporealism is a graphic force capable of opening Italy to the global spectator’ (2012: xiv–xv). Related to Italian film, Angela Dalle Vacche considers how Italian culture is translated to the screen body whereby she explores the connections between Italian Renaissance painting and cinema in terms of the ‘human figure, the theatricality of space, and the allegorical dimension of the visual narrative’ (2014: 4).\n\n4\n\nintroduction\n\nBodies of Gender, Race and Stardom In contrast to bodies of war, the star bodies of classic Hollywood are discussed by Richard Dyer in his book, Heavenly Bodies (2004), whereby he details how the screen image of major Hollywood stars was constructed. During the post-war period and following the demise of the Hollywood studio system, a relaxation of censorship led to increasingly sexualised representations of the human body and, subsequently, the emergence of the queer body, as discussed by Harry Benshoff (1997) and Michele Aaron (2004). At the same time, the civil rights movement and growth of feminism, which began to challenge the stereotyped and prescriptive roles of women and blacks in film, resulted in studies of the racial and/or gendered body by authors including Lola Young (1996), Chris Holmlund (2002), bell hooks (2008) and Frantz Fanon (2020). Likewise, Yvonne Tasker focuses on spectacular gendered bodies (1993) and Barbara Creed is known for her thesis of the monstrous feminine (1993). Concurrently, as a reflection of the post-Vietnam War era and the distinct militaristic position projected by Ronald Reagan, films such as Rambo: First Blood (Kotcheff 1982) and Die Hard (McTiernan 1988) articulated masculinity through an emphasis on the ‘hard body’ (Jeffords 1993). More recently, and foregrounding the films of independent women directors, Kate Ince (2017) considers female subjectivities through The Body and the Screen. Affective Bodies and Subjectivity While scholarship pertaining to the body usually pivots around textual representation, a number of academic works instead consider the body of the spectator in terms of affective modes. For instance, Luke Hockley utilises aspects of Jungian psychotherapy to consider how ‘the body of the spectator and the cinema screen are interrelated sites of meaning’ (2014: 1), Julian Hanich (2012) elaborates on abjection and disgust as aesthetic strategies for fear and audience affect, and Xavier Aldana Reyes analyses the affective-corporeal dimensions of horror (2016). In compiling various filmmakers’ contributions to bodily representation, Steven Shaviro likewise examines the reactions of the spectator and ‘foregrounds visceral, affective responses to film’ (1993: viii), while Alanna Thain explores a similar relationship through examples such as the Hollywood films of David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo (1958). In terms of other less tangible aspects of the body, Davina Quinlivan examines the place of breath in cinema (2014), Laura Marks (2000) proposes a ‘haptic visuality’ whereby certain images enable the spectator to experience cinema as a physical embodiment of culture, and Kaja Silverman (1988) surveys the voice in The Acoustic Mirror: The Female Voice in Psychoanalysis and Cinema.\n\n5\n\nstella hockenhull and fran pheasant-kelly\n\nAbject Bodies and the Posthuman During the late twentieth century, genres became saturated with explicit body imagery, especially the abject interior body. More recently, the onscreen body has become even more graphic with, for example, the tortured form recorded on film by military police at Abu Ghraib (Danner 2004), terrorist executions accessible on the Internet and the first public autopsy for 170 years, performed by anatomist Gunther von Hagens (2002), available on television. Relevant to the filming of terrorist detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib and other detainee camps, Judith Butler (2009) discusses the tortured body while Steve Allen (2013) considers sadomasochism, body modification and torture in fictional productions such as 8mm (Schumacher 1999) and Boxing Helena (Lynch 1993). While a sense of the violated physical body is increasingly incidental to many contemporary mainstream films and television dramas (for example, the post-millennial cycle of James Bond films) for reasons related to vulnerable post-9/11 masculinities, it has, since the 1970s, become a key aesthetic in numerous artworks as well as genres such as horror, science fiction, reality television, medical drama, medical documentary, fantasy and forensic crime drama. A consideration of the body therefore dominates associated texts, such as Body Trauma TV (Jacobs 2003), Cultural Sutures: Medicine and Media (Friedman 2004) and Spectatorship, Embodiment and Physicality in the Contemporary Mutilation Film (Wilson 2015). Aside from a relaxation in censorship, the trend towards displays of the interior body is arguably informed by medical developments since the 1970s, including MRI, CT and keyhole surgery, while an inclination towards what Mark Seltzer (1997) describes as a ‘wound culture’ – the public fascination with opened and torn bodies – has further engendered tropes of viscerality. With the advent of motion-capture technology and CGI, so too is the posthuman-, post-anthropocentric- and cyborg-body increasingly foregrounded in films of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, with productions ranging from The Terminator (Cameron 1984) to Avatar (Cameron 2009); accordingly, this turn to the posthuman body is reflected in a range of edited collections and monographs addressing the interfaces between the body and technology, and features work by Judith Halberstam and Ira Livingston (1995), N. Katherine Hailes (1999), David Bell and Barbara Kennedy (2000), Neil Badmington (2000), Elaine Graham (2002) and Rosi Braidotti (2013). Relatedly, Niall Richardson (2016) examines transgressive bodies in film and popular culture in a study that extends across hyper-muscular, fat, trans-sexed and disabled bodies, and Xavier Aldana Reyes (2014) similarly analyses corporeal transgression in Gothic horror film and literature. Robert Furze (2015) too explores the visceral screen through the films of David Cronenberg and John Cassavetes, while Michele Aaron (1999) engages with the ‘dangerous\n\n6\n\nintroduction\n\npleasures’ of the body through an examination of productions ranging from Cronenberg’s Dead Ringers (1988) to William Friedkin’s The Exorcist (1973). The Films of Tim Burton It is at the confluence of this bodily turn with discourses of disability, the freakshow and circus, corporeality and transgression, as well as the abject, Gothic and posthuman, that Burton’s work is located. These modes intersect with a broad diegetic chronology that extends back to 1799 in Sleepy Hollow (1999) and forward to the year 2029 in Planet of the Apes (2001). Indeed, Burton’s films are often grounded in the abject, corporeal body, as exemplified by Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), Corpse Bride and Sleepy Hollow. More specifically, imagery directly involves death, dissection, decay and reanimation, as evidenced in Sleepy Hollow, Frankenweenie and Corpse Bride. If Burton particularly embraces chimeric, transitional, ambiguous and circus bodies as in Big Fish (2003), Dumbo and Edward Scissorhands (1990), spectral bodies are found in Beetlejuice (1988), transgressed bodies in Mars Attacks! (1996) and animal bodies across a range of films including Planet of the Apes, Frankenweenie, Mars Attacks! and Sleepy Hollow. Certain of these somatic qualities are identified in other analyses of his work, but they tend to feature peripherally rather than centrally. Instead, scholarly studies either direct their attention to theoretical aesthetic framings, such as the uncanny, the grotesque and the abject, or otherwise take a thematic approach that pivots around subjects such as space, film soundtrack, German expressionist and Gothic influences or, at other times, the monstrous body. Such works include Johnson Cheu’s edited collection, Tim Burton: Essays on the Films (2016), which comprises three sections, the first of which, ‘Outsider Characters and Other Oddities’, has some connection to the theme of bodies. Indeed, one chapter focuses on ‘The Typical and Atypical body in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’ and another examines ‘Corporeal Mediation and Visibility in Sleepy Hollow’. However, neither chapter overlaps with the theoretical approaches adopted in Tim Burton’s Bodies. Subsequent sections of Cheu’s anthology concentrate on the nature of adaptations, technology, artistry and stardom which are only indirectly related to bodies. Like Cheu’s anthology, The Works of Tim Burton: Margins to Mainstream (2013), edited by Jeffrey Weinstock, is also divided into three sections. These examine aesthetics, influences and contexts and thematics, and comprise aspects such as the spaces of Burton’s films, the director’s trash cinema roots and a consideration of Danny Elfman’s music and auteurist fandom. While none of the essays centre on bodies, Carol Siegel’s chapter has some connection to Alex Hackett’s examination of sexuality in Edward Scissorhands – while Hackett acknowledges Siegel’s argument, her claim differs in that Hackett\n\n7\n\nstella hockenhull and fran pheasant-kelly\n\nsees Scissorhands as an asexual being rather than one involved in sado­ masochistic rituals. More recently, A Critical Companion to Tim Burton (2017), edited by Adam Barkman and Antonio Sanna, comprises three sections based on the spaces in which Burton’s films are set and entail: ‘Constructing Worlds’, ‘Fairy Worlds and Nightmares’ and ‘Identity and the World’. In considering a broad range of aspects associated with these three areas, the essays extend from the fabrication of fantasy spaces of the films and the associated mise-en-scène and narrative construction through to how identity might be interpreted. While certain chapters explore characterisation, the subject of the body is not explicitly addressed, with the collection generally preoccupied with spaces and settings. Conversely, Jennifer McMahon’s edited collection (2014), The Philosophy of Tim Burton, debates the philosophical significance of Burton’s productions and is organised around three key areas: identity, authority and art. The first part considers identity and the nature of the self; the second looks at the domain of the social and how Burton’s films comment on authority; the final part focuses on aesthetics. Overall, the book differs fundamentally to the somatic focus of Tim Burton’s Bodies. Aside from these edited collections and a number of fan-based guides, there are several scholarly monographs devoted to Burton. These include Alison McMahan’s The Films of Tim Burton: Animating Live Action in Contemporary Hollywood, which considers the industry aspects of Burton’s films, spanning animation, CGI, marketing, adaptation and Elfman’s music. Her primary argument is that Burton’s films are what she terms ‘pataphysical’ and possess certain characteristics: they make fun of established systems of knowledge and rituals, display an alternative narrative logic, use special effects that are ‘visible’ as opposed to invisible, and have thin plots and characters that are not rounded because the narrative depends more on intertextual, nondiegetic aspects (McMahan 2005: 3). McMahan’s monograph therefore is focused and narrow and does not discuss bodies in any direct form. In a series of interviews with Burton, Mark Salisbury (2006) discusses all his films up to that point, devoting a chapter to each, with the discussions extending to most aspects of the filmmaking process. Since this edition, however, Burton has directed many more films, including Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Alice in Wonderland (2010), Dark Shadows (2012), Frankenweenie (2012), Big Eyes (2014), Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children (2016) and Dumbo (2019). Helena Bassil-Morozow too has made a significant contribution to scholarship in her monograph on Burton, titled Tim Burton: The Monster and the Crowd (2010). Bassil-Morozow, one of the contributors to this collection, employs Jungian and post-Jungian psychology to explore the isolation of Burton’s protagonists. The book’s six chapters consider the various guises\n\n8\n\nintroduction\n\nof Burton’s protagonists, including the child, monster, superhero, genius and maniac as well as monstrous society, and while her study is character-based, it has a psychological rather than a somatic focus. I​n contrast, Masters of the Grotesque: The Cinema of Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, the Cohen Brothers and David Lynch (2012), authored by Schuy Weishaar, provides limited coverage of Burton’s outputs owing to its inclusion of several other directors in the book. In a chapter titled ‘Tim Burton’s Two Worlds’, Weishaar discusses the various manifestations of the grotesque, and while alluding to the corporeal body, the chapter does not wholly engage with physicality.\n\nTim Burton’s Bodies Tim Burton’s Bodies thus contributes to a gap in the literature in relation to a coherent consideration of bodies as a centripetal force in Burton’s work. What this book does differently is to spotlight actual physical attributes and figure behaviour of characters and the meanings that these may impart in terms of race, class, gender, sexuality, humanimality and disability. Its distinctiveness not only derives from its concentration on the body, but also in its consideration of nonhuman animals. Uniquely, it features a chapter written by a crew member who worked on Corpse Bride. Moreover, while this anthology analyses films that have already been scrutinised many times over, it also entails a study of Burton’s two most recent films, Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children (2016) and Dumbo (2019). The volume comprises nineteen chapters in all that are categorised according to themes corresponding to the various types of body that predominantly populate Burton’s films, namely: ‘animated bodies’, ‘creaturely bodies’, ‘corporeal bodies’ and, finally, ‘Gothic, monstrous and peculiar bodies’. Discussion chiefly spans his cinematic outputs, with Samantha Moore’s chapter on metamorphosis and transformation introducing the theme of ‘Animated Bodies’ in Part One. Noting Burton’s early affiliation with Disney studios, she discusses how Burton exploits the various properties of animation before explaining that he employs metamorphosis in several ways. First, she suggests that it may be instigated via the actions of characters, for example, in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street; secondly, via unresolved metamorphic longing; and thirdly, in literal metamorphic change as in Beetlejuice and Alice in Wonderland, which Moore analyses as case studies. Also contributing to ‘Animated Bodies’ is Emily Mantell, who recounts her experiences of working on Corpse Bride as a ‘Burton Body’. Mantell describes the development of the story and reveals how story teams and their ideas informed the final script. Further focusing on Corpse Bride, Elif Boyacioğlu considers the relationship between animation and the Gothic, paying particular attention to the uncanny, especially in its connection to stop-motion animation techniques. Analysing Corpse Bride as an example\n\n9\n\nstella hockenhull and fran pheasant-kelly\n\nof Burton’s creative hybridisation of genres, she centres on its Gothic and comic treatment of the animated corpse. Christopher Holliday’s chapter on Tim Burton’s ‘unruly bodies’ completes Part One, whereby he acknowledges qualities of unruliness in the director’s artistic practices, expressive film style, his industrial position at the margins and even in his appearance. Referring to Corpse Bride and Frankenweenie, Holliday first considers the cultural and gendered values of unruliness when applied to Burton’s animated bodies. He then analyses Burton’s animated bodies in light of the fundamental unruliness of stop-motion aesthetics. Part Two, ‘Creaturely Bodies’, details the role of the nonhuman animal in Burton’s films, and opens with Christopher Parr’s analysis of the creaturely politics of Planet of the Apes. Parr explores how the apes in Burton’s reimagining are ambivalently signalled as racial others in a way that reflects similar coding in prior films of the franchise and several of Burton’s previous outputs. The chapter considers Burton’s version in relation to Franklin Schaffner’s earlier adaptation (1968) and contributes to the discussion surrounding race in Burton’s films. ‘Creaturely Bodies’ also takes into account the theme of dead pets, explored first by Rebecca Lloyd who debates how Burton’s productions, predominantly Gothic in tone and seemingly celebrating excess and transgression, in fact reveal the meanings attached to the animal form that maintain human dominance over the animal body. Lloyd analyses Vincent, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Mars Attacks!, Corpse Bride and both versions of Frankenweenie, where animals are central to the narrative, to explain how representations of humans and animals castigate transgression of boundaries and the excessive body. Relatedly, Claire Parkinson considers dead dogs, albeit contextualised as autobiographical references to Burton’s own pets. Framed by the concept of children’s horror, Parkinson explores the repeated depictions of dead dogs and the cultural and social meanings attached to the bodies of animals, pet death and grief. In contrast, Stella Hockenhull’s chapter centres on the lesser role of the horse and its appearance in the Gothic horror adaptation, Sleepy Hollow. Engaging with Monica Mattfield’s (2017) concept of ‘becoming centaur’, whereby the body of a horse enables its rider a heightened masculinity, Hockenhull discusses the representation of the headless Horseman, in combination with his black stallion, Daredevil, but extends Mattfield’s concept to suggest a sublime effect: a symbol of monstrous masculinity or, in this case, ‘becoming monstrous centaur’. In the final chapter of ‘Creaturely Bodies’, and making connections between Burton’s fixation with misfits, outsiders and unusual bodies, Frances Pheasant-Kelly analyses Burton’s incarnation of Sharpsteen’s 1941 classic, Dumbo. She contends that while Burton’s adaptation follows the original, it concurrently addresses contemporary concerns for animal welfare by first highlighting the human/animal divide, and then diegetically operating to close this gap. The chapter also\n\n10\n\nintroduction\n\nconsiders the position of Disney productions in the technologising of animals to situate anthropomorphised creatures on the side of a dialectic opposed to ‘animal’. Elsa Colombani’s analysis of cannibalism in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street opens Part Three of the collection, titled ‘Corporeal Bodies’. Colombani explores the similarities and evolutions from the metaphorical cannibalism of the former to the literal anthropophagy of the latter, charting the disappearance of the individual body into the mass of consumerist society to its reappearance through the body pieces of the cannibalised as well as that of the cannibal. Also investigating corporeality, Cath Davies examines the relationship between dissolving bodies and materials in Burton’s work. Her essay centres on the interweaving of textures, surfaces and materiality of characters in The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride to probe how they gain agency through clothing. Correspondingly, Helena Bassil-Morozow considers the physical or psychological brokenness of Burton’s characters. Expressly, Bassil-Morozow interrogates the ways in which images of hands and eyes are utilised by Burton in a range of his films, with a focus on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and Big Eyes (2014); she argues that the literal or narrative fragmentation of characters reflects the intrinsic conflict of modernity – that between individual identity and societal conformity. In the vein of fragmented bodies, Fernando Gabriel Pagnoni Berns scrutinises Burton’s direction of ‘Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Jar’ (season 1, episode 19) (1986), a television episode that pivots around a disembodied organ, and is therefore relevant to this collection. Berns suggests that Burton’s preference for experimental narratives runs through the ways that he reimagines the human body and, even when working with actors rather than puppets, he reconfigures the body to dispense with realism. In this regard, Berns argues that ‘The Jar’ is a manifesto of things to come, with Burton’s ideas on artifice and the antirealist body emerging in subsequent productions such as Beetlejuice, Sleepy Hollow and Big Eyes. Such reconfiguration of the body is likewise identified by Peter Piatkowski in his analysis of Batman Returns (1992). Engaging theoretically with the work of Richard Dyer (2004) on stars, Piatkowski first identifies a stable of performers with whom Burton typically works, including Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Danny DeVito, and notes how these actors each have unconventional star images that conform to his characters and style. However, in Batman Returns, Piatkowski notes that he deviates from this method of casting by including Michelle Pfeiffer, whose screen persona is defined by her glamour and whose onscreen image is that of a traditional classic Hollywood star. Piatkowski’s essay examines how Burton uses Pfeiffer’s star image to advantage and then dismantles it through her corporeal and psychological deterioration.\n\n11\n\nstella hockenhull and fran pheasant-kelly\n\nThe final part of this collection, ‘Gothic, Monstrous and Peculiar Bodies’, begins with Michael Lipiner and Thomas J. Cobb’s analysis of the grotesque social outcast in Burton’s oeuvre. Lipiner and Cobb focus on how his cinematic treatment of the grotesque, in all its incarnations, shapes this figure to mirror mainstream American culture in the guise of a Gothic or cultural body, often metaphorical of popular lore, and which appears in the various forms of a persecuted monster. Examining Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns and Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, the essay suggests that Burton’s manifestation of the grotesque offers universal and multifaceted implications, thereby subverting the homogeneity of American suburbia. Marie Liénard-Yeterian also discusses the grotesque in Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children and explores the cultural work performed by the assorted curious and monstrous bodies in the film’s imaginary world, while addressing Burton’s ability to interweave different generic traditions. Specifically, LiénardYeterian debates the notion of ‘monster’ embedded in the motif of these curious bodies, which are poised at the intersection of the Gothic and the grotesque in their staging of an encounter with terror. José Duarte and Ana Rita Martins too consider Burton’s representation of monstrosity in their study of Big Fish (2003). Their essay enquires into the importance of weird and monstrous bodies while also identifying the work of American photographer Diane Arbus as a potential visual inspiration for the film. It further analyses the unusual bodies presented in the diegetic stories told by protagonist Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) and suggests that they propose a chance to consider changes in how anomalous bodies are viewed in the ‘real’ world. Peculiar and unusual bodies are at the centre of Alex Hackett’s analysis of Edward Scissorhands and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Adopting a psychoanalytical approach, Hackett contends that both protagonists are asexual beings, thereby differing from previous analyses of sexuality in Burton’s films. The final contribution to the book examines ‘Burton’s Benevolently Monstrous Frankensteins’. Here, Robert Geal reappraises Edward Scissorhands and Frankenweenie to interrogate usual interpretations of Burton’s films that celebrate outsider status. Rather, Geal challenges these to suggest that Burton’s intertexual engagements with Mary Shelley’s novel Frankenstein [1818] (1974), which inform the aforementioned films, include elements that are progressive, but compromise these aspects with arguably misogynistic revisions that invert some of the novel’s proto-feminist potential. In all, Tim Burton’s cinematic world of human and nonhuman bodies in their various forms provides a unique point of departure to present a range of new ideas and theoretical frameworks that enable innovative insights into his work.

TRANSFORMATION: METAMORPHOSIS, ANIMATION AND FAIRY TALE IN THE WORK OF TIM BURTON Samantha Moore Animation has always been a haven for eccentrics and misfits, a place for filmmakers who have a singular vision and where the laws of physics rarely apply. Everything in animation is fabricated, often from the feverish imagination of a single individual, so it is the natural habitat of the auteur. Animation is the form which Tim Burton gravitated towards as a child; he recalls the stopmotion animation of Ray Harryhausen in Jason and the Argonauts (Chaffey 1963) having a profound effect on him, stating, ‘I’ve always loved monsters and monster movies’ (in Salisbury 2006: 2). This mode of moving image also offers evidence that we cannot believe and, according to Paul Wells, the liminal space between real and unreal is where much of the deliciousness of animation lives (Wells 1998: 20). Moreover, animation allows for the possibility of impossible change, of metamorphosis either figurative or literal. Burton’s early short animated film, Vincent (1982), is about a young boy longing to metamorphose into his hero, Vincent Price. As Burton suggests, ‘[i]t’s like at Hallowe’en, people dress up and it allows them to get a little wilder, they become something else. That’s one of the aspects of film making that I’ve constantly enjoyed, the transformation of people’ (in Salisbury 2006: 56). Many of Burton’s films have metamorphosis at their heart, but less often in the literal than the figurative sense. He gives us metamorphic process instigated by his characters, for example, in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), where Benjamin Barker/Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) and Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) turn their victims into pies. Most poignantly (and most often), he presents the spectator with unresolved metamorphic longing, for instance\n\n15\n\nsamantha moore\n\nin Edward Scissorhands (1990), whose titular character longs to transform. Occasionally he gives us literal metamorphic change, as in Beetlejuice (1988) and Alice in Wonderland (2010), which will be explored in more detail in this chapter. Metamorphosis will also be examined as it relates to the subversive nature of animation, and the uncomfortable relationship that one of Burton’s key influencers, Disney Studios, has had with it. Metamorphosis in animation is the fluid transformation, frame by frame, of one thing (person, object, animal) into another. It can be done via any animated medium – clay, model, paint, drawing or computer-generated imagery (CGI) – and can be used in assorted ways for a variety of reasons. Metamorphosis can replace editing tasks such as scene cuts; as Barry Purves points out (2014: 184), to edit in-camera seamlessly and lyrically may be achieved by using under-the-camera techniques such as those employed in Caroline Leaf’s oil paint on glass film, The Street (1976). Furthermore, it can be utilised to condense information, space or time, for example in The Owl Who Married a Goose, another Leaf film (1974), where a water splash turns into snow falling to signal seasons turning. Metamorphosis can be used to draw comparisons between apparently unrelated subjects, or to create an emotional reaction, for example in Bill Plympton’s Your Face (1987) which, with its ‘nearly continuous metamorphosis of body violations and self-ingestions’, concentrates solely on ‘a man’s insipidly smiling face’ (Crafton 2012: 279–80), provoking humour and the uncanny. From attending the California Institute of the Arts’ (CalArts) animation programme to getting his first job working on the animated feature The Fox and the Hound (1981), Burton was steeped in traditional Disney animation training. This was despite its clear disconnection, artistically and philosophically, from his signature style. His recollection of his time at CalArts and Disney is ambivalent at best, but it cannot be denied that by hiring him, ‘Disney gave Burton a source of income and an identity – the identity of an animator, which he retains to this day’ (McMahan 2005: 22). Burton acknowledges that the animation training he received has inflected his visual vocabulary ever since: ‘[h]aving a background in animation sort of broadens the scope of what you can do visually’ (in Salisbury 2006: 51). Metamorphosis is a fundamental part of the vocabulary of animation, but it became forbidden at Disney as they pursued ‘believability’ of characters above all else (Pallant 2011: 35). Therefore, the neat animation trick of metamorphosis, that vital tool for instigating disturbance, was ignored by the company that trained him and, arguably, this influenced the ways that he used it in his films. Whenever metamorphosis is used in film it creates a disorderly presence: disrupting character, undermining the film structure or upsetting internal logic. According to Norman Klein, the frame becomes an ‘unreliable space [which\n\n16\n\ntransformation\n\nreveals] the mechanisms of the medium’ (in Wells, 1998: 134). Metamorphosis draws attention to the anarchic nature of the animated form. It does not bother to disguise its temperamental similarities to dream or delusion and makes no attempt to present a realistic perspective on a standard timescale. There is an inherent untrustworthiness about metamorphosis: it recalls dreams, nightmares and hallucinations, states we have experienced but in an unreal internal sense, and so to see it made manifest is profoundly unsettling. Vivian Sobchack comments about morphing, stating that ‘its effortless shape shifting, its confusions of the animate and inanimate [. . .] its homogenizing consumption of others and otherness, are uncanny – uncanny not only in the sense of being strange and unfamiliar but also in the sense of being strangely familiar’ (2000: xi). Morphing broadcasts animation’s ability to represent the interior but, in the style of dreams, we have no idea where it is going. Donald Crafton sees the metamorphic process as partially malign: a cannibalistic, self-destructive exercise on the part of the animator. As he states, Metamorphosis is autophagic in two fundamental ways. Set in motion by the animators – or their primordial hand – the forms come into being swallowing up the ones before them and cease to exist when they are eaten up by their successors. And, to the extent that the on-screen bodies represent the animators’ creative processes, their termination reflects the demise of the filmmaker. (2012: 278) This destructive model is particularly true for stop-motion animation made in front of the camera, like Leaf’s direct animation (paint, or sand, on glass) or Jan Svankmajer’s clay models that must literally be destroyed before the next frame can be made. Wells posits that metamorphosis may be the central defining quality of animation itself (1998: 69) because, for him, it is unique to the animated form. Metamorphosis can be used in a live- action frame by borrowing from stop-motion and utilising techniques like time-lapse (taking individual frames at set intervals and then playing them back continuously, to give the effect of time speeding up/caving in), as exemplified in Peter Greenaway’s A Zed and Two Noughts (1985). Time-lapse, as in all forms of metamorphosis, can be profoundly unsettling and emotionally distancing to watch, since it is related to life, but is not lifelike at the speed we experience it. For example, in Greenaway’s film, a dead swan writhes, zombie-like, as its body festers, while a dead crocodile appears to be breathing post-mortem as its stomach swells and sinks during the rotting process. However, metamorphosis in this sense (in camera, using real objects or people) can only be in one direction – that of time passing: the signs of growing, ageing, decaying. Animated metamorphosis, on the other hand, has what Sergei Eisenstein describes as ‘freedom from\n\n17\n\nsamantha moore\n\nossification’ and is not tied to ‘the rungs of the evolutionary ladder’ (1986: 5). Cause and effect are not necessary with animated metamorphosis – one can have effect, effect and effect ad infinitum, leaving the cause open to the opinion of the viewer. Blu’s Muto (2007/8) is an animated, life-sized graffiti film shot in a city, with the normal urban population relegated to mayflies while the animation ploughs through the cityscape at several times the size and a fraction of the speed of everything else. As Crafton states, ‘Blu pushes the bodies of his grotesque beings through never-ending metamorphoses based on cycles of parthenogenesis and reincarnation’ (2012: 272). The characters circle through endless loops without discernible narrative structure, but with a compelling visual style that no other medium could achieve. Metamorphosis, then, is grotesque, nightmarish, disorienting, destructive, unsettling and uncanny: qualities it shares with the fairy tale and that may be associated with Burton’s work. However, as noted, unlike the fairy tale, metamorphosis was explicitly rejected by Disney. As a fledgling animator, Burton’s early training came exclusively from Disney, which had a monocultural approach to the way that animation should be made. Concerning his time at Disney, Burton says: [i]t was like being in the army; I’ve never been in the army, but the Disney programme is probably about as close as I’ll ever get. You’re taught by Disney people, you’re taught the Disney philosophy. It was kind of a funny atmosphere, but it was the first time I had been with a group with similar interests. (in Salisbury 2006: 7) Burton did not explicitly choose Disney, but rather, as animation director and fellow CalArts alumnus Brad Bird said, ‘it was literally the only game in town’ (in Kashner 2014). Disney was the pre-eminent animation company in the world at that point and in many ways had defined what animation was seen to be capable of, prioritising ‘artistic sophistication, “realism” in characters and contexts, and, above all, believability’ (Pallant 2011: 35) in their films. Disney’s work was famously admired by Eisenstein for their use of metamorphosis in its ‘ability to dynamically assume any form’ (1986: 5). Ironically, what he admired them most for they rejected after the success of Snow White (Hand et al. 1937) and the comparative failure of the more visually inventive Fantasia (Algar et al. 1940). Such striving for realism and believability meant that they rejected the very thing – metamorphosis – that gave animation its disruptive edge, and the disruptive edge was what made it a tempting medium for Burton. This was the start of an equivocal relationship between Burton and Disney. He needed their support but the basic tenets of Disney’s beliefs (order, reality) were at odds with his own (disruption, outsider status). Burton’s own sensibility was much more in tune with an early rival of\n\n18\n\ntransformation\n\nDisney studios, the Fleischer Brothers, whose privileging of visual spectacle over character development better suited his filmic concerns. Unsurprisingly perhaps, metamorphosis is not represented in the ‘twelve principles of animation’. These were a set of axioms famously recorded by Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas, two of Disney’s ‘nine old men’.1 The twelve principles are essentially a set of technical rules for animators, designed to create believable physicality in Disney’s animated worlds, which was increasingly the aim of their work as it developed through the first half of the twentieth century. These principles include squash and stretch, anticipation, staging, straight ahead action and pose to pose, follow through and overlapping action, ease in and ease out, arc, secondary action, timing, exaggeration, solid drawing and appeal. Of the twelve principles, arguably only ‘exaggeration’ is not directly related to making the animated movement more realistic, and even that must take its cue from the internal believability of the work. Metamorphosis, however, is the opposite of the realistic/believable physicality of the twelve principles and bears no reference to reality. Klein points out that as ‘the transformation begins [. . .] the laws of nature collapse’ (2000: 21), and that collapse could not be allowed to happen in a Disney film. Burton would have been aware of the twelve principles when he joined the Disney-funded CalArts’ animation programme in 1976, and adherence to this methodology was the one which he was meant to be apprenticed to during his time at Disney when he entered the company proper in 1979. Disney at this time was very catholic in the individual styles of the animators it took on: ‘rough or clean, intuitive or analytical, it did not matter. It was the combination of styles that made Disney films rich and nuanced’ (Johnston and Thomas 1995: 95–6). However diverse or unusual the personal style of the animator was, the end result would always have to be ironed out to look like a Disney product. Burton says, ‘what’s odd about Disney is that they want you to be an artist, but at the same time they want you to be a zombie factory worker and have no personality. It takes a very special person to make those two sides of your brain co-exist. So I was very emotionally agitated at that time and couldn’t function very well’ (in Salisbury 2006: 10). Animation director Gary Trousdale is quoted by Sam Kashner as saying that Disney ‘didn’t know what the hell to do with Tim. They were scared of him. So they just stuck him into an office. That’s when he came up with the original [1984] “Frankenweenie”’ (2014). Burton would continue to wrestle with this coexistence of being an insider and simultaneously an outsider throughout his work. In order to identify how Disney’s lack of metamorphosis inflects its storytelling in comparison to other studios of the era, two treatments of the same scene are examined: the wicked queen’s transformation in films of the Snow White fairy tale. As noted, metamorphosis has no place in the twelve fundamental principles of animation and, in fact, as a tool, is barely used by Disney. Disney’s\n\n19\n\nsamantha moore\n\nemphasis was on the ‘believability’ of the movement and characters, sometimes characterised as ‘realism’. Chris Pallant notes that ‘as a product of Disney’s insistence on realism in Snow White, cartoonal metamorphosis is, with the exception of the Queen’s transformation into the witch, largely absent’ (2011: 43). Arguably, ‘cartoonal metamorphosis’ is thin even here: almost all this sequence could have been achieved with straight editing of a live-action scene. The 1937 Disney scene is entirely plot- and narrative-dependent; as Wells points out, the transformation scene brings ‘clarity to an extended narrative’ by using the narrative function of ‘a disguise’ (1998: 73), rather than emphasising the magical nature of a transformation. This scene is a key plot point in the film and shows the lengths to which the queen (Lucille La Verne) will go to get her way rather than highlighting her magical capability. The spectator is given a breakdown of the ways in which the queen’s ‘disguise’ will function (voice, hair and hands) in the future plot development of fooling Snow White (Adriana Caselotti). It is also couched in terms of character; there is a strong sense of her feelings of sacrificing her youth and beauty, her intense physical pain is clearly signalled, and finally her malicious glee is evident as she completes the protracted and difficult process. The transformation itself uses little actual metamorphosis in its animation; it depends on live-action techniques like an out-of-focus ‘camera’ shot as the queen drinks the potion. The only metamorphosis happens as the hair whitens (although her face remains the same) and a close-up reveals the hands ageing dramatically into those of a crone. The scene uses a theatrical rather than metamorphic flourish to provide the final reveal: a swirl of the queen’s sleeve as she shows her hag face to ‘camera’, the sequence using the language of live action almost exclusively. This is entirely in tune with Disney’s intentions for the animation. Klein cites Johnston and Thomas, suggesting that ‘[w]hen the animator distorts the figure, he [sic] must always come back to the original shape. Donald and Goofy can be made to bulge and implode but must never lose their “personality”, never turn into other things in the way Warner’s characters did [italics in original]’ (2000: 25). Comparing this to the Fleischer Brothers’ version of Snow White (1933), the queen (Mae Questel) is shown simply stepping through her mirror, which serves as a metamorphic plane, as she steps from queen into hag with an insouciant bravado. There is no sense that this sequence is plot driven; it is a gag (the mirror tells her to hide her face so she changes into someone else). It is not even the first time she has metamorphosed in the film: during Betty’s (Mae Questel) first meeting with her she briefly becomes a pan of two fried eggs for no other apparent reason than, with her unusually long nose and googly eyes, her threequarter-view face looks like a frying pan of eggs. The metamorphic sequences in the Fleischer film do not rely on character and plot development to drive them (there’s no good reason that the Fleischer queen should turn into a hag\n\n20\n\ntransformation\n\nother than that it is an accepted plot point for this fairy tale). Jack Zipes asserts that ‘[t]he Fleischers rarely worked from a script, and even if they did, they would ad lib and change it beyond recognition’ (2011: 120), and this feeling of spontaneous fun with no high emotional stakes pervades the film. In the Fleischer Snow White, the wicked queen uses her magic metamorphic mirror to turn Koko (Cab Calloway) the clown into a ghost, with weirdly long legs and a creepily familiar rotoscoped animation based on Calloway’s movements. As Sobchack describes it, the metamorphosis in this case has ‘transformed the structure of spectatorial pleasure’, disrupting ‘the spectator’s traditional modes of identification with central human characters and displac[ing] them’ (2000: xix–xx). He is no longer Koko but he continues to sing as if no change has been effected, perpetuating the dreamlike atmosphere. Eventually the queen’s final metamorphic sequence begins when the mischievous mirror rebels against her and turns her into a dragon, disappearing itself at this point. Finally, she turns inside out like a giant sock and the story ends. This kind of fundamental character transformation (size, shape, species) could not have happened at Disney, where character was far more revered. According to Disney, Klein says, ‘once a character’s body was shown – rubbery, watery, humanlike – its substance was irreducible. Walt was convinced that revealing the drawing behind the flesh could wreck the atmospheric effects that he prized so highly’ (2000: 25). Significantly, Johnston and Thomas argue, rather wistfully, ‘[w]e still wonder what we would be working on today if Fantasia had been as successful as Snow White’ (1995: 511). However, as Pallant points out, ‘the financial and critical success of Snow White, coupled with the comparative failure of Fantasia (1940), led to the former becoming an aesthetic blueprint for much of the Disney-Formalist period. The artistic paradigm promoted by Snow White has since become known as “hyperrealism”’ (2011: 35–6). Burton’s perspective was indelibly shaped – both positively and negatively – by the Disney ideology. As he argues, Because I’ve never read, my fairy tales were . . . monster movies. To me they’re fairly similar. I mean, fairy tales are extremely violent and extremely symbolic and disturbing, probably even more so than Frankenstein and stuff like that, which are kind of mythic and perceived as fairy-tale like. But fairy tales, like the Grimms’ fairy tales, are probably closer to movies like The Brain that Wouldn’t Die, much rougher, harsher, full of bizarre symbolism. (in Salisbury 2006: 3) The fairy tale is such a familiar subject of animation as to be almost synonymous with it. Metamorphosis is a key ingredient of fairy tale; in fact, Marina Warner argues that the fairy-tale form is defined by metamorphosis. As she avers, ‘More so than the presence of fairies, the moral function, the imagined\n\n21\n\nsamantha moore\n\nantiquity and oral anonymity of the ultimate source, and the happy ending [. . .] metamorphosis defines the fairy tale’ (1995: xv–xvi). Fairy tale is also a recurring concern of Burton’s, although he says, ‘I think I didn’t like fairy tales specifically. I liked the idea of them more [italics in original]’ (in Salisbury 2006: 3). Burton’s fairy tales are filtered through his own lens of concerns and ideas, much like Disney’s were, and emerge similarly askew as a result. If metamorphosis, as Sobchack says, ‘reminds us of our true instability’ (2000: xii), then so do fairy tales, with stability under constant threat from wolves and wicked witches, poverty and familial deaths. Burton’s affinity with the fairy tale is clear, and this unstable base gives him a good opportunity to explore his love/hate relationship with the status quo: the untransformed. Even when he is using original material, such as in Beetlejuice (1988), the characters are very clearly fairy-tale inflected and therefore disposed to metamorphosis. The Maitlands are the isolated but unspectacularly ordinary husband and wife who wish for a child, and the Deetz family are the inattentive king and needling stepmother who have a poor unfortunate (step) daughter. In typical Burton style, the sympathetic protagonists are the monsters (the ghosts of the Maitlands), and the antagonist usurpers (the Deetz family and entourage) are the legitimate house-owners. The ‘good fairy’ who effects transformation is Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) himself, a grotesque character mixing an anarchic cartoon sensibility (definitely not Disney) with creepy sexual innuendo. Metamorphosis is used by the marginalised characters, often as defence. Barbara Maitland (Geena Davies) attempts to use metamorphosis as a way of scaring the Deetzes from ‘her’ house; she transforms into Hallowe’en mask cliché (faces ripped off, eyeballs popping out) but the pretentious Deetzes’ horror is triggered only by the bland interior decorating and her metamorphosis remains unseen, so she changes back. Betelgeuse, unlike the Maitlands, is unselfconsciously metamorphic throughout the film. He uses his metamorphic power as the ultimate childlike wish fulfilment (‘if I had a magic wand . . .’) to magically transform any given situation. Zipes states that animation applied to fairy tales involves ‘first and foremost transformation’ (2011: 82) because only there can we see instantaneous punishment applied, justice dispensed and desires granted. Betelgeuse is first seen as a drawn advert: part man, part beetle, holding a huge hammer. Next, he is part of a diorama, uncannily real but on the scale of the ‘tiny’ models he is among. He casually changes or distorts parts of himself at will; for example, when he is attempting to persuade the Maitlands to hire him, his outfit changes to mirror Adam’s (Alec Baldwin) clothes. Sound and visual effects are used to make clear his similarity to a riotous cartoon character; smoke comes out of his hat, his head swivels uncontrollably, and ‘cartoon’ sound effects accompany some of his movements – like the lewd squeeze of his groin in salute to the departing Maitlands, emphasised by the sound of a\n\n22\n\ntransformation\n\ncar horn. In the scene where he first encounters the Deetz family, his metamorphosis into a monster is almost complete, except for his recognisable hair. He becomes a snake-like creature, reminiscent of Harryhausen’s Medusa from Clash of the Titans (1981), emerging nightmarishly from the stair banister rail. When he is banished by Barbara Maitland and returns (in a car crash) to the model town and his normal form, he sprouts knives from his body to stop Barbara from picking him up to tell him off. Riffing off the phallic knives and his sexual frustration, Betelgeuse conjures up a brothel complete with demonic sex workers, horrifying the Maitlands. Betelgeuse’s position as subversive agitator is rooted in the fact of his metamorphic ability. He is couched as plot instigator and troublemaker: a classic fairy-tale trope like Rumpelstiltskin who creates as many problems as he solves. Barbara and Adam Maitland explicitly take on metamorphosis as a strategy to help them in their predicament, and yet their position as sympathetic protagonists remains intact and unthreatened. Later in the film they must scare on command to prove to their afterlife case worker, Juno (Sylvia Sidney), that they can be effective ghosts. They metamorphose their heads into grotesque masks which bear no resemblance to their normal faces, but – far from losing their ‘personality’ as Disney feared metamorphosis would inevitably effect – they remain familiar and recognisable. Adam sprouts eyeballs on all his fingers, but clearly they are each as short-sighted as his original eyes because he has to hold up his spectacles to them to look at Barbara. They need to change quickly to their normal selves in the next scene when they unexpectedly meet Lydia (Winona Ryder), and Adam has a problem changing back; but, as in the Fleischer brothers’ film, Snow White, the metamorphic change is played purely as a throwaway visual gag, not a focus of the plot or reflection on the character, and is not commented on in the dialogue. In Beetlejuice the transformations come very deliberately via analogue stopmotion and puppet-based effects rather than digital effects, which give a vitality to the sequence and fulfil Burton’s visceral pleasure in stop-motion. As he states, ‘Growing up watching the kinds of movies that I did, like Harryhausen . . . I always found the effects to be a little more human. There’s a certain sort of handmade quality about them’ (in Salisbury 2006: 62). When he interviewed Harryhausen in 2012, Burton talked about the special energy created through actually touching the puppet when stop-motion animation is created. All animation is made frame by frame, whether digital or analogue. Handdrawn 2D animation or digital 3D animation can be reviewed and changed incrementally, as the frames can be individually revisited. However, in analogue stop-motion animation, mistakes or missteps cannot be smoothed out afterwards because each take is a record of the animator’s performance in animating that model. If the sequence needs to be changed or slightly improved it must be re-shot. In all the stop-motion animated sequences in Beetlejuice there\n\n23\n\nsamantha moore\n\nis an uncanny aura about their movement reminiscent of Harryhausen’s work, which draws attention to their hand-constructed origins. The spectator is subliminally aware of the hands that have made and moved them because they are slightly imperfect and ‘kind of cheesy’ (Burton in Salisbury 2006: 61). Burton’s love for and fascination with Harryhausen’s work is well documented; Jason and the Argonauts is the first film that he remembers watching (in Salisbury 2006: 2), and in Corpse Bride (based on a Russian folk tale, 2005) there is a homage to Harryhausen’s work in the skeleton song-and-dance scene. When interviewing Harryhausen to coincide with the Blu-ray release of 20 Million Miles To Earth (Juran 1957), Burton says passionately, ‘people don’t really realise how beautiful and special animation itself is [. . .] three- dimensional [computer] animation [. . .] I still don’t feel has the same quality’ as handmade stop-motion animation (2012). In Alice in Wonderland (2010), however, directed by Burton for Disney, the animation is entirely CGI. When Alice (Mia Wasikowska) first shrinks in size there is none of the cheesy, handmade effects of Beetlejuice; her flowing dress immaculately blossoms up around her as she disappears within it. When she steps into Wonderland, it is into a seamlessly integrated CGI environment, designed to be seen in ‘Disney digital 3D’. Perhaps this is a logical extension of Disney’s aspiration for the ‘hyperreal’ believability developed during Snow White, culminating in the apparently ‘live action’ partially animated remakes of Dumbo (Burton 2019) and The Lion King (Favreau 2019). Alice is the most metamorphic being in this film but lacks agency; she changes in relation to her environment and in reaction to her treatment by others in Wonderland. She follows orders and instructions from people and things – whether she is attending a garden party or obeying the command ‘drink me’ on a bottle – reluctantly but reliably. Her body is a site of conflict and her body size is constantly commented on by others. At the same time, her passive metamorphosis is helpful in allowing her to continue in her escape from the real-world dilemma she finds herself in: ostensibly whether she should marry her aristocratic suitor, Hamish (Leo Bill), but actually, in deciding who she is and what she should do with her life. Warner points out that, in fairy tales, while male beasts are usually under the influence of a malign curse, female ones are frequently willing participants in their transformation, as they are often running away from the advances of an unwelcome lover. ‘Their metamorphosis changes their problematic fleshy envelope, which has inspired such undesirable desire, until a chosen, more suitable, more lovable lover can appear who will answer the riddle, undo the animal spell, disclose their identity and their beauty and release them to speak again’ (Warner 1995: 353–4). Burton’s Alice superficially has more power than the typical transformed fairy-tale heroine; at one point she says, ‘from the moment I fell down that rabbit hole I’ve been told what I must do and who I must be. I’ve been shrunk, stretched, scratched,\n\n24\n\ntransformation\n\nand stuffed into a teapot [. . .] this is my dream. I’ll decide where it goes from here [emphasis in dialogue]’. Later, before the final battle is due to be fought, with Alice as the champion who must defend them, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) tells her, ‘you cannot live your life to please others, the choice must be yours’. However, the words seem hollow as Alice is as much a pawn of the plot at the end as she was in the beginning. Since the Caterpillar’s ‘Oraculum’ foretold her slaying of the Jabberwocky at the start of the film, there does not seem much of a choice to be made. The original Lewis Carroll (1865) version of Alice in Wonderland is essentially a metamorphic fairy story. Like animated metamorphosis, the story is full of effect, effect and effect with little sign of a cause (or a plot) as Alice travels from one strange character interaction and scenario to another. In Burton’s Disney version, this metamorphic Wonderland is bracketed by a plot about a hypocritical society where nothing is as it is meant to seem: her brotherin-law is unfaithful, and her proposed fiancé does not like her very much. The falsehoods are not allowed to be acknowledged by Alice as everyone around her strives to keep the status quo intact. Wonderland here also seems to be a series of multiple effects, but the metamorphoses that Alice undergoes quickly become inextricably linked to the wider dilemma of how she literally fits in, and so the cause becomes glaringly obvious. Zipes claims that Burton ‘queers the narrative of Alice in Wonderland by crossing genders, mixing sexual identity, and creating all sorts of bizarre animated characters who remind us that there is no such thing as normal, whether in reality or in our imaginations’ (2011: 301). That is true to a point. For example, Alice changes from an archetypal princess into a warrior-prince who slays the Jabberwocky, but ultimately it always comes back to a patent binary conflict between good and evil with little room for ambiguity or unpredictability; everything happens in service of the plot. There is a duplicity in Burton’s delivery of the fairy-tale ending. Angela Carter (1990), in the introduction to her Virago Book of Fairy Tales, suggests that the goal of fairy tales is not to maintain the status quo, but to fulfil wishes and create utopias, and this is something Burton struggles with. The real world is far less attractive, colourful or appealing than the metamorphic wonderland, and yet, in film plots, the real world must be returned to for the ending to make sense. Even in Beetlejuice, where at the end the dead and undead happily coexist, the culmination is essentially very real-world-normal. As Warner says of fairy tales, ‘magic paradoxically defines normality’ (1995: 133). Barbara and Adam Maitland become the suburban middle-class couple with a child that they always longed to have, and the outcome is much duller and less anarchic than the rest of the film despite the upbeat Harry Belafonte soundtrack in the final scene. In these examples of Burton’s work, the characters who inhabit or enter the alternative as opposed to the real world are most likely to exhibit ­metamorphic\n\n25\n\nsamantha moore\n\ncharacteristics, and the metamorphic characters are by far the most empathetic. In the Fleischer brothers’ Snow White, the wicked queen is the most vital, interesting and keenly drawn character visible. Similarly, the spectator has absolute sympathy with Burton’s metamorphic characters. Disney’s purported fear that metamorphosis would ruin the audience’s connection with the believability of the character does not hold. Physical metamorphosis after all is a universal human experience, whether via adolescence (Burton’s favourite), accident, menopause, pregnancy or simple ageing. Metamorphosis brings change and chaos, turning the world upside down, such as happens to Alice in the scene where she experiences her first metamorphic transformation and lands on the ceiling. As Klein states, during metamorphosis ‘gravity itself seems to disappear’ (2000: 21). Burton’s empathy with the metamorphic characters is matched by an uncompromising attitude to those who aspire to metamorphic status but fail. The Deetz family and their interior decorator/ghost hunter, Otho (Glenn Shadix), are constantly attempting to harness metamorphosis by transforming the house themselves, via art materials, yet are thwarted in their attempts to do so. The sycophantic courtiers who pretend to be outsiders to ingratiate themselves with the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) in Alice in Wonderland are more despised than the villains. Only the true outsiders, the undead Maitlands, the amoral Betelgeuse and the guileless Alice, are able to transform at will. Metamorphosis is life, vitality, excess, subversion, perversion, deviance: all the fun stuff. Metamorphosis is specific to animation and being an animator is ingrained in Burton’s identity as a filmmaker. Animation is a disruptive, marginalised medium that constantly reinvents itself, more qualities that we associate with the director’s best work. Note 1. Disney’s ‘nine old men’ were the core animators from Disney’s ‘Golden Age’ of drawn animation, from Snow White in the 1930s to The Rescuers in the 1970s.\n\n26\n\n2. AGREEING TO BE A ‘BURTON BODY’: DEVELOPING THE CORPSE BRIDE STORY Emily Mantell\n\nAt the end of the day it’s not the technique that the audience cares about; it’s a great story, a visual feast, and great characters. They want to be taken on an emotional journey they have never been on before. (Schneider in Lasseter 1995: 26) A story team’s journey on an animated feature such as Corpse Bride (2005) is similar to that of the audience. It is emotional, full of story and character, has astounding visuals – and it is unlikely you will have experienced anything like it before. When agreeing to work on Corpse Bride, you are agreeing to wholeheartedly embody Tim Burton’s imagination. By signing the contracts, you accede to keep production secrets and leave your life at the door for the duration of your stay. In exchange, you enter the Burton world – you become a ‘Burton Body’, a crew member. You become dedicated to Burton’s incomplete vision, you enter the ‘dark, edgy, and quirky realm of the “Burtonesque”’ (Salisbury 2006: xviii), and with this agreement there comes glory ‘but also its own, unique set of difficulties, not least in the expectations that both studios and audiences now have of him and his output’ (Salisbury 2006: xviii). Sixteen years later I can reflect on my experience and the processes and write with hindsight. I hope to give a fair account of what it is like to be a ‘Burton Body’ and to explain what story development means on an animation feature. This essay provides an overview of how story teams and their ideas inform the final script, observing that the screenplay is not the beacon of light in stormy seas, but more like a large ship loosely anchored nearby.\n\n27\n\nemily mantell\n\nFigure 2.1 Topsy-turvy heads designed for portrait gallery in Victor’s house, Emily Mantell, for Corpse Bride, 2005.\n\nIn 2004 I was one of the early crew members on Tim Burton’s Corpse Bride at Three Mills Studios, London. My journey started in a large empty room designated to the story department, which would soon be bustling with story artists. Where there were once empty studios and offices, suddenly and intensely there is a surge of energy and urgency; something is created, and then as quickly as it arrives it disappears. Being part of that is special and difficult to explain.\n\nFigure 2.2 Topsy-turvy heads designed for portrait gallery in Victor’s house, Emily Mantell, for Corpse Bride, 2005.\n\nInitially, there were early scripts, various pieces of concept art and production designs, Tim Burton’s sketches, and a few storyboards. In the coming months, my job was to help set up the story department with the production crew and, later, to assist the storyboard artists with adapting their drawings digitally and preparing them for the editing team. Over time my role evolved to include more interesting creative tasks, including the Corpse Bride metamorphosis scene, topsy-turvy heads, script updates, concept art, concept art updates, gag concepts, suggesting story changes in team meetings and more. Agreeing to be a ‘Burton Body’ The term ‘Burton Body’ in this essay proposes the idea that the creative crew on feature animation development embodies the story and the characters both physically and mentally. It seems obvious to me now, but embodiment is a skill, an essential creative tool that varies in ability. Similar to writers, story artists\n\n28\n\nagreeing to be a ‘burton body’\n\nare creating believable scenes, character arcs and emotional experiences that audiences should be able to connect with. To do so effectively, the creator needs to be able to emotionally and, at times, physically imagine themselves within the story or as the character. The world’s leading TV showrunner/­producer/ writer, Shonda Rhimes, shares the ease with which this type of embodiment came to her from a young age: ‘I’ve lived inside my head since I was a kid. My earliest memories are of sitting on the floor of the kitchen pantry. I stayed there for hours in the darkness and warmth, playing with the kingdom I created out of canned goods’ (2015: 18). The experience of being a crew member in the story team on Corpse Bride was an all-encompassing endeavour. Daily, we were absorbed by the story, the characters and the world. We rarely left ‘The Land of the Dead’ or the ‘Land of the Living’ and were immersed completely in the Corpse Bride world. If we weren’t fabricating the events and emotions of the characters, then we were designing the experience of the audience. Imagining and embodying, this was our job. As Edwin Catmull notes, ‘People who take on complicated creative projects become lost at some point in the process. It is the nature of things – in order to create, you must internalize and almost become the project for a while, and that near-fusing with the project is an essential part of its emergence [italics in original]’ (2014: 91). To sustain long periods of work, the management team creates a family-led environment. The crew’s embodiment was emphasised in the campus-like environment of production. In addition to this, your social life becomes crew-based, and regular after-work drinks and themed crew parties, with sometimes dressing-up as characters from the film, re-enforce the sense of an embodied experience. A feature animated film can use anywhere between 300 and 500 cast and crew members. There are many roles, some creative and some operational. The operational crew, such as the production teams and accountants, arguably have less involvement with the story and characters, and therefore their embodiment is less intense. Their commitment and skills, however, enable the submersion of the creative crew into the Tim Burton realm. Hierarchical status on a feature animation doesn’t differ much from the corporate world: with Tim Burton as founder and overseer of the film – executive producer (creative and operational), followed by Mike Johnson the director (lead creative), Alison Abate the producer (lead operational) . . . and so it goes down through the production crew until you get to production assistants and junior creatives. On average, a feature animation can take anything between two and seven years in production, but a mere 120 minutes to watch. A huge crew dedicate themselves to a variety of tasks that go largely unnoticed, undocumented and unused; some processes may make it onto the ‘special features – making of’, and some ideas and assets may make it into the final film, but the majority don’t. At the most basic level the entire crew embody the story by reading the\n\n29\n\nemily mantell\n\nscript; they scrutinise each update and are witness to the development of the story as it moves forward. Meanwhile, they are surrounded by visuals created for the film – concept art, character puppets, animation tests, animatics, storyboards, sets and more. Eventually, and at varying different levels, the film and crew become strangely entangled as the ‘tangible’ and ‘visible’ make their way towards the final production. As consumers of entertainment, art and culture we spend much of our time immersed in the story, characters and experiences, whether it is games, television, film, books or art. The more audiences/users are immersed, the more they live vicariously through the story and the characters, and the greater they embody the experience. As John Yorke notes, ‘It’s extraordinary to see the process by which their feelings are sublimated and they become inextricably linked with the fortunes of their fictional counterparts’ (2013: 3). The more the audience embodies the character and story, the bigger the success the makers of the story feel their work has been (box office figures aside). Indeed, the creative crew are vital for this reason, and many talented individuals worked hard to complete the Corpse Bride vision. In the story team, our job was to get a good story out of the script, then run it through our brains, hearts and hands in the hope of making an authentic connection with the audience; we, of course, wanted to deliver the film that audiences expect from Burton. As Robert McKee maintains, ‘Our appetite for story is a reflection of the profound human need to grasp the patterns of living, not merely as an intellectual exercise, but within a very personal, emotional experience’ (1999: 12). On Corpse Bride, the standard industry procedure of test screenings was held, in this instance, for child audiences; they watched rough cuts of the film, and their reactions were closely monitored by the crew. In general, facial expressions and responses are observed and, when it goes well, children look sad or happy in the right places, laugh when prompted, and leave with a sense of experience; if they don’t react accordingly then it is back to the drawing board (literally in some cases) for the crew. The emotions are monitored because it is the clearest way of identifying whether the audience has connected with the story and characters, and whether they too are embodying the experience designed for them. The story team have a huge influence over character and story, and it is a strange mix of working with micro details such as the emotional reactions of the character, and macro issues such as story structure. The micro details process demands the story artists psychologically put themselves in the characters’ shoes and embody their personality. For me, this practice necessitates deep concentration and working alone. The macro changes occur where big story fixes are needed. This requires team meetings, brainstorming, big-picture thinking, an ability to bounce ideas around and a good level of confidence in your ideas. A good understanding of story in\n\n30\n\nagreeing to be a ‘burton body’\n\ngeneral is important for the macro changes: knowing how character arcs work and how to break up the pace of the film/narrative. The story team’s job is to be objective and subjective almost simultaneously; they must see the story objectively and be the characters subjectively. Often a scene would work for the plot, but the character’s reaction wasn’t authentic. Every gag, camera shot or story change has to be conceived, pitched, changed, pitched again and eventually accepted (if you’re lucky). Gags are the jokes that carry a scene through with visual humour; they have a large history in animation and are rarely included in the script. A story artist prides themself on getting a gag in the film and is usually congratulated by the other members of the team when they do. As the lowest- ranking story team member, I recall being celebrated by the rest of the story team when my concept of the ‘secondhand store’ was accepted as a gag. Below you can see the initial sketch (Figure 2.3) I nervously took to Mike Johnson. The amount of work added to the sketch to get to the final look (Figure 2.4) is evident in the images below.\n\nFigure 2.3 Concept for Second Hand Store scene, Emily Mantell, for Corpse Bride, 2005.\n\nFigure 2.4 Final appearance of Second Hand Store in Corpse Bride, 2005.\n\nFor each line of text in the script there could be between five and fifty drawings that demonstrate the mood of the scene, the attitude of the character and that visually incorporate key plot points (story beats). The story team can propose new ideas, or remove existing ones, and gradually they help to sculpt the final film. There are elements of personification that are not seen by the outside world that add to the embodiment experience; an example of this was being asked to be the voice of Victoria on the rough cut of the film (many of the crew did the rough-cut voices). This meant acting the role, as well as trying to get the emotional tone of voice accurate. This was at roughly the same time that I was working on various visual expressions of Victoria’s predicament – living a\n\n31\n\nemily mantell\n\nconformist life, forced into marrying someone she doesn’t love and gradually losing her mind. I was asked to work on a wedding dress (Figure 2.5) that made Victoria look constrained, which further inspired me to push Victoria’s need for escape, so I designed her sewing a blanket that would work as a ladder to aid her descent from the bedroom window (Figure 2.6).\n\nFigure 2.5 Wedding dress for Victoria, Emily Mantell, for Corpse Bride, 2005.\n\nFigure 2.6 Victorian sewing blanket, Emily Mantell, for Corpse Bride, 2005.\n\nThe story artists are given scenes from the script to visualise, then ‘sell’ the idea back to the director. This is a process which will often involve physically ‘performing the boards’ – using voices, high-energy storytelling and acting the board; artists put immense effort into the process, hoping that it will be approved. A performance sell may be done multiple times for each scene, and for a moment, the character, scene and story artist become one.
