In the late summer and early autumn of 2001, sometime before the World Trade Center collapsed, I was invited by David Sterritt and Mikita Brottman to join a panel on screen performance that they were going to propose to the Society of Cinema Studies, as it was still known. For some reason I will never fathom, I suggested Johnny Depp. I certainly liked his work, and perhaps fancied, along with Kemmons Wilson, the founder of Holiday Inn, “that I’m so damn normal that anything I like, everybody else is going to like too” (Halberstam 1993, 174). I hadn’t really thought about Depp, except that he was someone worth watching. David and Mikita warmed immediately to the suggestion, and I sat down to write. In the late winter of 2002, in Denver, the panel happened, in front of what turned out to be an enthused and jovial audience, many of whom shared my sense that Depp was a ﬁgure to be contended with. I am particularly grateful to David and Mikita, as well, for sharing both published and unpublished material of theirs on Johnny Depp; and to David and also to William Luhr for inviting me to present some of this material to the Columbia University Seminar on Cinema and Interdisciplinary Interpretation. That my musings should have become a book is due to a suggestion, made with his usual infectious good humor, by Barry Keith Grant; this is probably not the book he had in mind, but I hope it is close enough to bring pleasure. To think of Depp at all I was led, ﬁrst by the perspicacity of the editors of Cahiers du cinéma and later by the generous hospitality of Leslie Barker and Adelaide Barker Karaskas. In various ways, they made it possible for me to want to see, and then actually to see, Edward Scissorhands, which really did open the door. My dear friend and colleague Michael DeAngelis reﬂected my suspicion that Depp was to be taken seriously, but also moved me to a much deeper stratum of thought through his patient and meticulous analyses of star personae in Gay Fandom and Crossover Stardom and in his brilliant essay on Depp, so generously offered to me for publication in ix\n\nx acknowledgments\n\nan anthology on screen gender at the end of the twentieth century (DeAngelis 2001). I have been encouraged, assisted, provoked, and enthralled like a kid at a magniﬁcent carnival through many conversations with Tom Gunning. And I have received travel directions of inestimable value from Ann Kaplan. Jane Hoehner has been a gracious and loyal friend. Jay Glickman helped me shop. Further, many friends and students have opened their thoughts to me and I am extremely grateful: Jennifer Brayton, Michelle Czukar, Slobodan Drakulic for knightly courtesy, Craig Fischer, Lester D. Friedman, Giovanna di Girolamo, Eve Goldin of the Cinemathèque Ontario Film Reference Library in Toronto, Peter Higdon, Andrew Hobbs, Maureen Holloway, and Chuck Hsuen, Halifax, for Dead Man. I owe debts of gratitude as well to Michael Anderson and Mike Orlando of the Hollywood Canteen, Toronto, Chanda Curtice, Andrew Horton, Susan Hunt, Howard Kaufman, Martin Landau, Kenny Moi of the New York Post, Wayne Pittendreigh, Susanne Meyers Sawa of the University of Toronto Music Library, John Simon, J. David Slocum, Milos Stehlik at Facets, Chicago, Alan Walker, and Leslie Witol. Invaluable assistance has been provided me by Carla Cassidy, Dean of Arts at Ryerson University. My book-loving partners at Rutgers University Press are in these pages as much as I am. My gratitude to Leslie Mitchner, Marilyn Campbell, Anne Hegeman, Arlene Bacher, Gary Fitzgerald, and Molly Baab; to Adam Bohannon, the designer; and to Eric Schramm for his customary keen eye. And Ron and Howard Mandelbaum at PhotoFest, New York, have been generous with their wisdom and knowledge. My friend Jamie Thompson has been most encouraging and helpful in secret ways. Curtis Maloley and Nathan Holmes have gone overboard in their spirited and exhausting work on this project. I thank Curtis for his nonstop discoveries and suggestions, his taste in books, and his speedy ﬁngers; and I thank Nathan for considerable research, for unﬂagging wit, and for preparing the ﬁlmography that ends this book. Ariel Pomerance is involved with unstinting love in every aspect of my writing. I hope and trust that in some way these pages reﬂect his fascinations as much as my own. Nellie Perret’s wisdom, courage, and brilliant observation are my beacon, my ground, and my delight. But she is also the best detective a writer could hope to know. Aware that, as Truffaut’s Montag says, “in order to ﬁnd, one must ﬁrst know how to hide,” she has again and again helped me to ﬁnd what I have hidden from myself, thereby gifting me with not only love but also understanding.\n\nq r johnny depp starts here\n\nPlayers and painted stage took all my love, And not those things that they were emblems of.

Born in Kentucky he was particularly attached to his mother. His brother introduced him to heavy rock music: I was daydreaming of taking her out behind the 7-Eleven to drink Boone’s Farm strawberry-apple wine and kiss until our mouths were raw. ZZZZRRRIIIPP!! was the sound I heard that ripped me from that tender moment. My brother Danny, ten years my senior and on the verge of committing fratricide, having had more than enough of “Do you feel like we do?,” promptly seized the vinyl off the record player and with a violent heave chucked the sacred album into the cluttered abyss of my room. “No more,” he hissed. “I can’t let you listen to that shit anymore!” I sat there snarling at him in that deeply expressive way that only teens possess, decompressing too fast back into reality. He grabbed a record out of his own collection and threw it on. “Try this . . . you’re better than that stuff. You don’t have to listen to that shit just ’cause other kids do.” “OK, fucker,” I thought, “bring it on . . . let’s have it!” The music started . . . guitar, fretless stand-up bass, ﬂutes and some Creep pining away about venturing “in the slipstream . . . between the viaducts of your dreams. . . .” “Fuck this,” I thought, “this is pussy music—they’re not even plugged in!” The song went a bit further . . . they didn’t play that kind of stuff on the radio, and as the melody of the song settled in, I was starting to get kind of used to it. Shit! I even liked it. ... 5\n\n6\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\nMy life had been metamorphosed when Danny put Van Morrison’s Astral Weeks onto the turntable that day. (Depp 1999, 69; 70) A boyish voice—even a little dirty—unpolished—authentic—from the streets. He later became enchanted with Jack Kerouac’s On the Road (“life-changing for me” [Depp 1999, 70]) and got a television acting job on “21 Jump Street,” where as an “undercover cop with a pouty demeanor” (Kaylin 2003, 95) he became a teen idol (who could “see his mug grinning back at him from the covers of magazines” [Nashawaty 2003, 30]), at once despondent and constrained by mediocre scripts and a gnawing sense of having been typecast that irked and depressed him. “It was a very difﬁcult situation,” Depp writes, bound by a contract doing assembly-line stuff that, to me, was borderline Fascist (cops in school . . . Christ!) . . . Dumbfounded, lost, shoved down the gullets of America as a young Republican. TV boy, heart-throb, teen idol, teen hunk. Plastered, postered, postured, patented, painted, plastic!!! Stapled to a box of cereal with wheels, doing 200 mph on a one-way collision course bound for Thermos and lunch-box antiquity. Novelty boy, franchise boy. Fucked and plucked with no escape from this nightmare. (Depp 1995, ix) He became rambunctious (“at one point, unemployed and recently evicted, he crashed in the Hollywood Boulevard apartment of his young actor friend Nic Cage, where he stole Mexican money Cage had tossed in a drawer” [Kaylin 2003, 95]). He more or less fell into movies (one of his biographers calls him an “accidental actor” [Heard 2001, x]), thanks to John Waters, who cast him in Cry-Baby (ﬁnding him “the least homophobic hetero boy I ever met” [Heard 2001, 53]); then he went from ﬁlm to ﬁlm, bizarre character part to bizarre character part, acting out the role of a delinquent offscreen by trashing hotel rooms, drinking too much, and being rude to reporters. He had a chain of girlfriends, at least two of them, Winona Ryder and Kate Moss, internationally celebrated. He ﬁercely maintained an independent and self-directed personality, choosing his own roles, often to the detriment of achieving ﬁnancial success. Shooting The Ninth Gate in Europe for Roman Polanski he met Vanessa Paradis,\n\nintroduction: a trick of light 7\n\nfell immediately in love, and fathered two children, so that, having transformed “from heavily moussed and packaged newcomer to reﬂective expatriate” (Kaylin 2003, 95), he now lives in domestic bliss in a small town in France, doting upon his kids and lovely partner and looking back with a rueful and understanding smile on the outrageous rake he used to be. With Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Secret Window, Finding Neverland, and The Libertine, his most recent ﬁlms, he seems to have broken into the mainstream and become at last a hugely successful star (who can still get away with some pirate gold on his teeth), a turn of affairs that occasions numerous stories about him in the press, all of which repeat this litany with quiet understanding as though it is the single pathway by which boys, or at least movie star boys, become men in the West. Johnny, once a hellion, has grown up. Johnny, once a rebel, has become bourgeois. “Now the former hoteltrasher, who turned 40 in June, doesn’t even go out to the cinema any more” (Caron 2003, 86), or know where the nearest movie theater is (“I have absolutely no idea . . . no idea at all” [Nashawaty 2003, 34]), or, for that matter, read newspapers: “I don’t want to know who is up, who is down, who is a success or who is a failure. These things don’t interest me. I prefer to spend time with my children” (Caron 2003, 89). So it is that if he remains beautiful, mysterious, enchanting, and epigrammatic—indeed, as People magazine recently had it, “The Sexiest Man Alive” (Russell 2003)—his career can also remain something of a moral lesson, neatly conﬁguring him as “ﬁrst in a generation of blessed young actors who understand the capriciousness of success, know how lucky they were to ﬁnd it so fast and ease their guilt by paying regular homage to old guys” (Kaylin 2003, 97). His “old guys” include Hunter S. Thompson—“There’s really not an ugly bone in the guy’s body”—as well as Roky Erickson and the 13th Floor Elevators: “If you listen to old 13th Floor Elevators stuff— Roky Erickson especially, his voice—and then go back and listen to early Led Zeppelin, you know that Robert Plant absolutely copped everything from Roky Erickson. And it’s amazing. And Roky Erickson is sitting in Austin, Texas; he’s just there. And Robert Plant had a huge hit. It always goes back to those guys, you know? I love those fucking guys” (Richardson 2004, 99)—and, it need hardly (at least for fans of Benny & Joon) be said, Charlie Chaplin, about whom he expresses great adoration in Richard Schickel’s Charlie: The Life and Times of Charles Chaplin (2003), noting sadly, “We’ve deﬁnitely lost\n\n8\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\ncomic patience. . . . What Chaplin did was milk a gag and really stretch it out, really draw it out. Even if you knew what the result was going to be, it was still hilarious.” The pumpernickel roll dance from The Gold Rush that Chaplin made up more or less spontaneously, Depp vowed, took him a month to work out, working over and over and over. So be it. For a number of reasons, this myth of the civilized savage is (too) convenient. It reﬂects once again an oft-told story of Hollywood, thus reifying that story, solidifying it, entrenching it in what seems historical “fact” and social “reality.” For example, the “actor’s career”—passing from obscure and strange performances during a period of “wild” youth to more conventionally structured and comprehensible, hermetically bourgeois performances in middle age— also typiﬁed Marlon Brando ( Johnny’s friend and sometime mentor) and Humphrey Bogart (dead six years before Johnny was born). Indeed, if we look at Michael Curtiz’s Yankee Doodle Dandy, we see a (sparkling) cinematic retelling of this myth as the “life story” of George M. Cohan. Johnny did only what many great actors do, then, in sowing his youthful wild oats with a list of lovers and in proffering a charm box of strange and inexplicable performances, then in settling down to something the mass media could deftly package and handle. It is important to note, indeed, that the very image of Johnny the rake become Johnny the reasonable is itself a mediated package, a way of putting a frame around him so that we can be comforted by his apparent stillness and presence (when he is always in motion, and not present to us at all). His performance as a singing gypsy who likes cocoa in Chocolat, one that occupies relatively little space in this book, can be seen as a transitional role for Depp, the gateway through which he left the ﬂaky monde of Edward Scissorhands and Co. and became the gentle husband and father he is today. If Hollywood actors are weird, they are only weird as youths, our myth seems to say; and ﬁnally they, even they, grow up. Seeming for a while to be Peter Pan, Johnny ﬁnally became—as all wayward boys do—Mr. Darling. His recent title performance as J. M. Barrie in Marc Forster’s Finding Neverland was therefore to be anticipated with some real excitement (and also with tranquilized reassurance, since instead of performing onscreen with the untamed Vincent Gallo, Charlie Sheen, Anthony Michael Hall, Al Pacino, or Brando he had graduated to the genteel well-bonded company of Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie).\n\nintroduction: a trick of light 9\n\nJohnny as middle-class parent also nicely addresses the aura of shapeless eroticism that followed him “in his youth,” his adoring yet somewhat inwardly turned audiences of both genders and virtually all persuasions,* his penchant for feelingful unpredictability and political devotion. All this can be swept aside as jejune, as rudimentary, now rareﬁed and modiﬁed—shaped and burnished—into a conventional adulthood that should apparently, like religion, be the pathway for all. He proves that one can look back and say, “I didn’t know shit,” thus not only excusing whatever one did or didn’t do in one’s youth but also erasing it, deﬁning it as beneath mature interest. But the myth of the tamed Johnny Depp has for me an outcome still more pernicious. By amalgamating his many fascinating screen performances into a single package of “previous,” and therefore relatively immature, work, the wrap-up of Johnny as a family man who has found truth has the potential to obscure from critical appreciation and serious reﬂection all of what Depp committed to the screen before “ﬁnding” love and family, that work now constituting in retrospect just a preparation for the “real” challenges of bourgeois life. The myth not only amalgamates performances, it diminishes each of them into a link in a progressive chain; it renders the screen appearances superﬁcial and casual by positing in the bourgeois present a special depth, a gravity, and a purpose. What Depp onscreen showed us about the screen itself, then; about performance; about masculinity; about recognition and understanding—all this is apparently to be disregarded, unexamined, ﬂushed away as preliminary to a present condition the well-socialized adult viewer is very unlikely to ﬁnd galvanizing and important even if strange.\n\nIj Our sense of need to grasp, hold, own, deﬁne, bound, isolate, and realize Johnny Depp—we live in a world where everything is ﬂying past us, where we might sense a need to grasp virtually anything, yet he is especially desirable, it seems—is comforted, not challenged, by the public relations material that recounts that boyhood-tomanhood legend over and over, that America-to-Europe legend, that legend of being lost and being found. As I will try to argue in many * I am grateful to Joe McElhaney for recollecting that lesbians, while Johnny was young, had a particular fondness for the boyishness of his girlishness.\n\n10\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\nways in these pages, what makes Depp so peculiar and so vitally interesting is exactly that he is ungraspable, that he throws in our face any attempt to use theory to net him. This is partly because he is continually morphing, but I mean something else—something to do with the self he presents onscreen and the exercise we must endure to come to terms with it. This is not, at any rate, a conventional study of a movie star. The conventional star study has a clear biographical line as its center—I more or less neglect that here. Or else it suggests a salient link between an actor’s characterizations onscreen and important social, political, historical, or cultural happenings. I write often as though there are no happenings of any kind except on the screen where the Depp image resides. As a celebrity, Depp is certainly an ultimate ﬁgure of the publicity machinery of high capitalism, which trafﬁcs in surfaces and phantom images, packages, expendables, transferables. In such a culture, even for a ﬂash we wish to own our experience, and to own things. So, we want to possess Depp. Depp can be understood this way . . . or Depp is deﬁnitely an example of that . . . or: there is no doubt that Depp really and truly is. . . . Of Jimmy Stewart one could say he was the common man epitomized. Of Marlon Brando one could have thought, “Rebel.” Of Depp, no such objectiﬁcation is possible and that impossibility is the message. A psychological approach I reject, since we do not meet Depp and can have very little, if anything, to say about him as a familiar. Another, more current, approach has been taken by star theory from Richard Dyer and James Naremore to Paul McDonald, Richard Corliss, Thomas Austin, and others. The audience’s methods of interpretation, in this kind of work, become the center of the analysis, Depp’s acting playing to, and also deriving from, audience expectations about performance and dutiful acceptance of its social conventions. If psychological criticism mythologizes every aspect of performance as legend and spirit, as personality; audience reception criticism rationalizes performance as reﬂection, or image, or the social world, neglecting that there is another world, a world of theatricality—in this case, the world of the screen—in which still another complex arrangement of forces, intentions, mobilizations, alignments, pointers, memories, and moves is taking shape entirely outside considerations of who the actor really is, hiding behind the mask, or what current events and social structures get reﬂected in his staged actions. What this book is not, then, is: (a) the story of Johnny Depp’s life,\n\nintroduction: a trick of light 11\n\n(b) the plots and production histories of Johnny Depp’s ﬁlms, all his ﬁlms, one by one, starting at the beginning and moving forward, (c) what Johnny Depp’s characterizations say about the society in which they are sold, or (d) who Johnny Depp truly, really, actually, sincerely, authentically, fundamentally, profoundly, originally, and personally really is. I do not methodically cull through every performance he ever gave, recounting his conversations with his director, his personal anxieties, or his opinions about his character, or giving an in-depth analysis of his DVD commentaries. All these approaches are too easy. By this I don’t mean writing any of those books would be an easy task. Writing any of them would be difﬁcult. But the accomplishment would settle too easily upon us; we would be too much at ease in, and with, it. And—not to give too much away before the right moment—Johnny just isn’t comprehensible in the conventional terms used for writing about actors or screen acting, because there are aspects of his performances that render his screen presence, taken in all, and to summarize it in a single word, circulatory. His screen presence is not objective, not rotund, not actually there, in a way that cannot be said of other actors—for example, Sean Penn or Russell Crowe. A more precise way of putting this is that in watching Johnny Depp we reﬂect upon him and wonder, and my single guiding principle here has been to try to spell out the wonder that has been mine when I have watched him. It is hardly a private wonder, and to make it plain is to give others the opportunity to recognize it as their own and possess it more fully. What is it precisely that can intrigue us— I want to ask—about Depp’s presence onscreen? What can we learn about looking, thinking, understanding, and watching cinema by watching him? Not “Who is he?” or “What does he mean?” but “What is going on when we are watching him?” Now one thing is true that may not be immediately apparent to every reader: what is going on is unavoidably musical. I know that the ﬁrst time I had that realization was in listening to the opening credit sequence of Emir Kusturiça’s Arizona Dream where Johnny sings a long raga to music by Goran Bregovic. He immediately struck me as ﬁrst and foremost a musician, who sings his roles. In structuring these pages it seemed necessary, implicitly, and from the outset, to be musical as well. I therefore begin with a suite in nine movements, called “Depp Positions.” I think Johnny’s acting both makes and implies certain formal statements— philosophical claims, if you will—about being, about social life,\n\n12 johnny depp starts here\n\nabout performance itself, about our contemporary world. It makes “depositions.” In each movement I try to tease out and discuss one such deposition and move in my discussion back and forth among the ﬁlms. And all the movements circle around the theme of Depp’s manner of playing to his audience’s desire for approximation, knowledge, and touch. In “Hungarian,” to begin, I treat Depp’s curious forays into ethnicity with some speciﬁc reference to Tim Burton’s Ed Wood. What is the curious ethnicity Ed seems to be able to manifest in company with Béla Lugosi? What is it to understand that Depp is producing this quality, this aura, given that we know that neither Johnny nor Ed is discernably an ethnic type? Discussed here, as well, is John Badham’s Nick of Time, where Johnny is a kind of double of himself. In “Apprehending,” the discussion addresses itself speciﬁcally to our desire for proximity, for possession, and for ﬁxation; and muses, in fact, about getting into Johnny Depp’s mouth as a way of permeating his shell. Contrasting some curious moments in Ed Wood and Donnie Brasco with Dustin Hoffman’s torture in the dentist’s chair in Marathon Man, the argument moves to establish what can be meant by “interiority” in the case of Johnny Depp. “Not Finished” discusses the performance in Edward Scissorhands in terms of Goffman’s dramaturgical ecology, the need for actors to open to the audience aspects of interaction that might not ordinarily be seen, suggesting that Depp forecloses interaction here and produces exactly a sense of distance. Meditation and the relationship between the image and the mind is worked through in terms of Ortega’s proximal and distal vision in “One Drag,” a movement that also ﬁnds room for a reﬂection upon Depp and smoking. “No Thing” and “Disappearance” discuss Depp’s screen performances in terms of Marx’s “derealization” and Robert Jay Lifton’s “protean man.” Depp has established a star career with the performance history of a character actor. “Blanc” is a meditation on various nuances of Johnny Depp’s whiteness, playing with such groundings as Jim Jarmusch’s impressions of the actor, Gwendolyn Audrey Foster’s analysis of colonialism, and Tom Gunning’s discussions of the detective, and with such ﬁlms as What’s Eating Gilbert Grape, L.A. Without a Map, The Brave, and others. Baudelaire’s ﬂâneur inevitably comes up in the case of Depp’s touring the world of characters and social forms; “The Outsider” presents a discussion of Pirates of the Caribbean, From Hell, Fear and Loathing, and other material in terms of Walter Benjamin’s approach to Baudelaire and mod-\n\nintroduction: a trick of light 13\n\nern life. “Light and Darkness” is about Depp’s eyes, notably in Once Upon a Time in Mexico, focusing on his tendency to gaze outward—to make the audience his object—and on his performance as a step toward a “cinema of the absolutely presentable.” In all these pieces, and all through the book, my modality is jazz and my method is an extended riff. I would not go so far as to call this “bop” but it is true that I do play with themes and variations and that I try to “blow”—yet, to be precise, not really to blow. In my own musical training, which preceded my training as a writer and thinker, I was a pianist, which means that instead of blowing I struck. I am trying to strike a sequence of notes and note groupings, to make passages, to unfold. After “Depp Positions,” I give a brief “Interlude” as a way of shaking myself out and also as a preparation for what is to come. In this I discuss Roland Barthes’s theory of the punctum and apply it to Depp’s performances. No one who is not interested in Roland Barthes’s theory of the punctum need read this short passage and anyone who reads it may feel free to jump around at leisure. Barthes’s point, in a nutshell, is that a photograph is a kind of ﬁeld and that it always contains a mark or point, the punctum, that stands out, even leaps out, and centralizes our engagement; I try to suggest there are also cinematic puncta in order to prepare the reader for the next section, “Johnny Depp Starts Here.” This is a set of “études,” in which I work by locating ideas not in theory as inspired by or recollected in performance but in some of Depp’s performances themselves. “E´tudes” I call them in homage to Frédéric Chopin, who wrote two opus groups of such pieces choosing a different aesthetic problem to resolve with each—as it were, a different spatio-temporal form. In this section, including discussions of Gilbert Grape, Spencer Armacost, Johnny Depp (as played by Johnny Depp in Lost in La Mancha), Raoul Duke, Don Juan De Marco, Donnie Brasco, Glen Lantz, Axel Blackmar, William Blake, Edward Scissorhands, George Jung, Jack Kerouac, Bon Bon, Captain Jack Sparrow, the Native American Raphael from The Brave, and Mort Rainey, I address the actor through his roles, attempting to elicit broader thematic discussions as inspired by particular—often quite minuscule—aspects that have hitherto gone unremarked upon. A caveat. Since at least as much as it is a study this volume is also a composition, I needed to work not in some matrix of required moves and adaptations but out of inspiration and curiosity. So it is that not\n\n14\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\nevery Depp performance gets treated, and that my treatments may focus on only limited aspects of a performance. My aim is to be revealing and to encourage further thought about Depp in particular and ﬁlm performance in general, not to catalog all the actor’s work. While it is a sad truth that the book cannot address everything, the fact that ﬁlms of Depp’s are being shot, edited, packaged, advertised, or planned even as this sentence is being written makes comprehensiveness impossible anyhow. Two relatively brief essays follow and conclude the volume. In “Depp Theory,” I examine Depp’s screen style as an avatar of forces and energies not encountered before in screen performance, a response—decidedly enigmatic—to a certain well-worn and desiccated style of motion picture presentation and reception. To do this I begin by considering the “pleasure of the view” that encountered other historically placed forms of visual culture only to be replaced by a pervasive and bitter critical dissatisfaction. What Depp offers to viewers, I argue, is what early photography and early cinema also offered, namely, an opportunity for stunned regard. Finally, in “The Image Views Himself Disappear” I offer a kind of coda upon the theme that Johnny Depp will stop acting one day.\n\nIj Let me raise an interesting and important problem. If the Johnny Depp who starts here has been, and remains, my Johnny Depp—since as a phenomenology this can be nothing if not personal—of what use, then, and of what signiﬁcance can this book be to anyone else? Fundamentally, this is what has been labeled by semiotic scholarship the problem of intersubjectivity, applied to cultural, social, historical experience. It is also the problem of language. In what way, one could wonder, can this sentence that I am writing be intelligible, meaningful, useful, and perhaps pleasurable to any person other than myself? And the answer is that language invokes shared meaning, shared reference (whatever it is that we take “sharing” to mean; yet, most simply, we could say that it means many can successfully make claims upon the selfsame territory). As you read these sentences that I am composing, you recognize—and own—the words I am using just as quickly as I do when I compose with them. They do not have only private and unitary meaning for me, and I am not inventing or originating them; I am choosing them. I am, as it were,\n\nintroduction: a trick of light 15\n\nwriting from the outside in, not from the inside out. While my body, my mind, my personality, my emotions, my memory, and my convictions are all affected when I see Johnny Depp in a ﬁlm, in order to make clear to you what is happening to me I must search among the words, phrases, and references that are already available (and that I know will resonate with you because you, too, know they are already available) in order to ﬁnd the ones that will bridge the chasm between us. We are all of us not only sitting at the edge of an abyss, but sitting there, as Kenneth Burke once wrote, “nervously loquacious” (1965, 272). A brief pause. Clearly, I am addressing the problem of language for transmitting subjective experience, and I am taking “subjective experience” to be a reality, not a myth in itself. One could also argue that all experience is objective, indeed material, and that the very notion of a subjective, idiosyncratic, individual, personal “take” on Johnny Depp is little more than an opiate to keep me from seeing that whatever I see everybody else sees, since it is completely, and only, out there. This is ultimately an Althusserian critique. I would not take issue with it. From my point of view, even if Johnny is taken to be objectively real and nothing else, even if his performances are interpreted as an economically based signal system and nothing more, even if we neglect the problems of subjectivity and intersubjectivity and stand upon the conviction that there is no chasm at all separating one viewer from another when they are bound together by the strictures of class and geography; still, the task of writing these sentences, conditioned as it is by the external constraints and formulations of grammar, all publicly shared and learned, falls upon my own frail self, bearing the weight of autobiography and mortality. It is true, in other words, that we were all born and we will all die, yet saying this truth in this particular way in this particular paragraph in this particular book is my way of speaking, my way of being in the world (on this, see Goodman 1972). I must come to terms with Johnny Depp, then, in this exact way, in order to say my piece; and I think if I struggle to make sense I will also be struggling to be accessible and clear to someone else—someone who is “not me,” whatever that can be taken to mean. Dear reader: it is in this exact way that I ﬁnd myself writing to you. I believe that if fully, sufﬁciently, penetratingly, precisely, rhythmically, colorfully, sensitively, self-consciously, mnemonically, incisively, constructively, and beautifully I can manage to say what I see\n\n16\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\non the screen, you, too, can recognize that construct and perhaps be informed. In short, my Johnny Depp can be anybody’s Johnny Depp. Being a mechanically reproduced visual record, the screen performance is somewhat subject to language (given the tremendous difﬁculty of using words upon images), its reception by me therefore not wholly a subjective matter; or at least, what’s onscreen can be related by one viewer to another in such a fashion that each indication successfully solicits a recognition, not, if you will, a wholly objective state of affairs and yet as much objectivity as ever we need or hope to achieve. To put this differently: whether I can say enough of what I have seen to make you think, “Yes, that is exactly what I have seen, too,” is doubtful; but in trying to write I can evoke your attempt to read, and in that mutuality of endeavor is our conversation. In this way, not only Johnny Depp but also the screen and also ﬁlm itself can start here, start in the sense of leaping into discourse—and not for the ﬁrst time, either, but again and again. Film must start for us again and again, in order that we may see it more clearly, more penetratingly, more rhythmically, more self-consciously. Not Depp himself but this saying of mine about Depp starts here, and if I conjure him for the reader then he is conjured now, and in these pages, for the ﬁrst time in just this way and also not exclusively here. They who read may see. If the reader asks why I have chosen Johnny Depp, because I might have chosen any actor, any ﬁlm, any era, perhaps these pages will bring the answer. In one, perhaps too ﬂattering, sentence, his is the preeminent motion picture image of our time and motion picture images are both fascinating and culturally central. On the cultural centrality more people have written than on the fascination, and it is the fascination that holds my interest—not simply in itself, in the sense that I am curious about the way Depp fascinates—but also structurally, in the sense that I am curious about the way fascination happens and works, and Depp is the model par excellence in terms of our screen life. Depp’s magnetism will recall that of Montgomery Clift and James Dean a little; his ability to use his body, to dance, will bring up memories of the performances of Marlon Brando; his ability to disappear into a character will remind many of Dustin Hoffman or Laurence Olivier. His physical beauty and the intensity of his gaze are nonpareil, the eyes moving in the same direction, yet not as brutally far, as Tyrone Power’s, being not as hopelessly liquid as Sal Mineo’s, seeming to be less ﬁendishly playful, indeed, than Cary\n\nintroduction: a trick of light 17\n\nGrant’s. But he can muster the sensuality of Mineo, the extraordinary grace of Grant, the dash of Power, together, all in a breath. Though one can typify performers and acting styles in this way, one is rarely helped by doing this in appreciating the subtleties of any particular performed moment, since inevitably what we see onscreen resonates for us with thoughts and experiences in the private and social realms that extend far outside the limits of the performance. While to some extent one’s response to what is onscreen is personal, yet still it can be informed by sensitivity to, and knowledge about, one’s culture, the history of screen performances, and the reservoir of other screen performances that may link to what one is seeing. And in the end, any attempt to say fully and clearly what one is seeing is a challenge in its own right, the richness of theories and languages of analysis entirely notwithstanding. Alexander Herzen wrote that each generation must ﬁnd its own fullness; each writer about the screen must ﬁnd his own way of seeing and speaking.\n\nIj In order to read this book for pleasure it is not a requirement that one watch the ﬁlms being written about before reading, although it’s not a bad idea. The prose is intended to be interesting on its own. But the ideal circumstance, also one that is impossible, is this: that I am reading this at the same exact moment as I am writing it, yet also at the same moment that I am watching what I am writing and reading about; and that you have joined me. We can hope to approximate this, if we wish. While I worked on this book, many of my friends and colleagues asked me the obvious question: was I intending to meet Johnny Depp? The answer to that extremely provocative question is, of course, the text in these pages. The Johnny Depp that I write about here cannot be met, that is certain, at least, not met in the sense my friends had in mind. And what about the Johnny Depp with whom one can sit and drink a glass of wine, chattering about his family and his home in France, his intended movie roles, perhaps even the roles from his past? That Johnny Depp, when he brings himself to such meetings, is part of a publicity construction. But there is another obstruction more interesting. Of all the movie-goers in the world, the one who is incapable of appreciating the screen performances of Johnny Depp is Johnny Depp. This book is in part written to him as a salutation and\n\n18\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\nappreciation, and as such he could have no part in it. Yet, most profoundly for me, he is here already. What is central is this one fact: it is the Johnny Depp we see onscreen who is my focus here, not the Johnny Depp who enacts that Johnny Depp even though I must attempt to write about both of them in order to say the ﬁrst. It is the performing performer. I have been interested in actors and performance as long as I can remember, and in the context of this moment I will reveal a secret about my introduction to ﬁlm, a secret that is possibly not only mine. Johnny Depp invokes this secret to me repeatedly and I put it forward at this moment in order that it may also be invoked for you. I was in a very large theater, one of those places with gilding and painted cherubim on a domed ceiling and plush seats—I think, maybe, the Palace Theater on King Street in Hamilton, Ontario. It was early in the 1950s. The ﬁlm, whatever it was, was in black and white. It had, to be sure, love scenes. Figures moved back and forth in the radiant, shimmering, hot silver light, eyes twinkling and so on. But I thought—I was certain beyond question—that what I was seeing was actual people who were behind the screen, somehow gathered under the roof of this august building and enacting this drama, and who, in certain moments and through some process beyond my imagination, had been turned into giants. Something I did not understand, would never understand, and in fact did not wish to contemplate, had inﬂated them, but only inﬂated them, so that still, even if they were huge, they were there, real, living out what they were living out, and the wonderful screen was permitting me to see them. It was only much, much later that I understood ﬁlm was a projection coming from a booth, that it was a trick of light, and that in the theater darkness I was not in the company of those wonderful beings at all. I was alone in a crowd. I suppose for me Johnny Depp today is still and always there behind the screen when I watch him, there but also untouchable, a supreme trick of light.\n\nImage rights not available\n\nDepp Positions\n\nHungarian And though she may have studied with an expert dialectician and grammarian, I . . . can . . . tell . . . zat . . . she . . . vas . . . borrrrrn . . . Hungarian! Lerner and Loewe, My Fair Lady\n\nJ\n\nohnny Depp is not Hungarian. Not long into Tim Burton’s Ed Wood (1994), however, he participates in a strange “Hungarian event.” As the title character, a happy-go-lucky Hollywood studio greensman’s assistant who dreams of making it big as a ﬁlm director, he has accidentally encountered the celebrated horror star Béla Lugosi (Martin Landau, also not Hungarian) and they have quickly become friends. Lugosi is seventysomething, jaded, faded, masqueraded. Wood à la Depp is brash, bright, bungling, and bizarre—a man with not only a penchant for angora and high heels but also a knack for affectionate self-mockery, as though to say, “I’m an odd one, aren’t I? And it’s fun, isn’t it, that I’m odd?” We ﬁnd him one night, seated on Lugosi’s divan as the two ﬁlm addicts gaze at the television personality Vampira (Lisa Marie) who is hosting a latenight screening of Lugosi’s Dracula. “I think she’s a honey,” coos the old star, as he begins to wave his ﬁngers at the screen while whispering a mantra of seduction. “My gosh, Béla! How do you do that?” says Wood, terribly impressed at the lulling tones of the basso voice and the ﬁngers curling outward again and again like so many waves running onto a beach. “You must be double-jointed,” instructs Lugosi, as pale as a sheet. “And you must be Hungarian.” As he whispers these words, we see the two friends, side by side, ﬂicking their ﬁngers out in perfect unison like so many tentacles, and the haunting gazes from their dark eyes are perfectly matched as their ﬁngers “dance” in the eerie glare of the cathode light. 21\n\n22 johnny depp starts here\n\nThis is a very Deppish moment. The eerie zaniness, the simplicity and sincerity in an act of complete irrationality, the dramatic ﬂair . . . the apparent apprenticeship, as though Johnny is drinking in the actions of Martin Landau in precisely the way that Ed is drinking in the actions of Lugosi. It is clear enough that characters and actors are onscreen together in a scene that is constructed through layering. Indeed, there is no way to appreciate the very deep complexities of Johnny Depp’s screen work without seeing that it inevitably involves layering. In this case, we have Depp the performer donning the mask of Wood the character, Landau the performer donning the mask of Lugosi the character, and then, behind all this, Wood and Lugosi the historical actual beings who lived in Los Angeles in the 1950s when this movie is set. Edward D. Wood, Jr. (1924–1978) was the writer, director, producer, and frequently the star of Glen or Glenda (1953), Jail Bait (1954), Bride of the Monster (1955), Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959), Shotgun Wedding (1963), Orgy of the Dead (1965), Class Reunion (1970), The Only House (1971), Necromania (1971), Cocktail Hostesses (1973), Five Loose Women (1974), and many other far-from-celebrated ﬁlms that intrigue more people today than they ever did while he was alive. Béla Lugosi (1882–1956) made 108 ﬁlms directly (and was represented through the cutting-in of archival footage in an additional 14), including The Veiled Woman (1929), Dracula (1931), Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), and Ninotchka (1939). Since the Lugosi onscreen in Ed Wood is meant to be understood as a direct representation of the Lugosi who died in 1956 and worked with Ed Wood in actuality, the Lugosi sitting on the divan and seducing Vampira through the airwaves is both a character (in Tim Burton’s ﬁlm) and a person (who predated Tim Burton). And the same can be said for Wood. Since Lugosi was an expatriate Hungarian, the claim made by Martin Landau on camera and in character that “you must be Hungarian” reads as a direct authentication of that historical, actual ethnicity, and therefore as a veriﬁcation, too, of the relationship between the screen characterization and the real historical ﬁgure who underpins it. The character seems like a Hungarian character because the real person it is based upon was especially marked as a Hungarian person—hence the famous slow drawl in which the actor performed the annunciation of himself as “de Cowwwwwwnt!” (The Count on “Sesame Street,” indeed, is an elegant parody not of Dracula the ﬁctional, mythical being but of Dracula, the practical creation of Béla Lugosi.) But what is it that we are perceiving when,\n\ndepp positions 23\n\nas Lugosi intones, “You must be Hungarian,” we see Johnny Depp with waving ﬁngers and saucer eyes in that ﬂickery darkness? What is this “Hungarian” quality emanting from Johnny Depp? Or: what do I mean when, perceiving this ﬁlm, I use the word “Hungarian”? Do I mean something historical, ethnic, geographic, something that implies heritage and inheritance, what Burke would have called (in Permanence and Change) the “genetic motive”? In that sense, after all, “Hungarian” is an ethnic marker, like “Italian,” “Malaysian,” “Portuguese.” In an important sense, I do not mean to invoke ethnicity at all but, instead, to conjure what it is that Landau, as Lugosi, is conjuring when he uses the word exactly in the way that he uses it. Landau, “Hungarian,” is also not Hungarian. And I take Landau to have concocted his performance in large part from viewing Lugosi ﬁlms, therefore to be imitating Lugosi (the Hungarian) in his speech. Since many have drawled the word “Hungarian” softly as he does, indeed imitating him in doing this (many, to be sure, including Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady [1964] when he invokes the lines quoted above while performing “You Did It”), the word as thus intoned is a performing construction, part of a staging. It is meant to suggest a morbid and passionate, nostalgic and pained, appreciation and yearning (such as an appreciation for a concentration of Magyar blood and yearning for a supremity of Magyar feeling and experience) that can be associated with a certain mythology, a certain topography, a certain characteristically melancholic personality, linking, for example, the cities of Buda and Pest and the cultural bubble blown outward from the river that divides them into the literature and imagery of the Gothic as deﬁned in the West. The “Hungarian” strains to reach an always receding apogee of pleasurable intensity, stretches for a thread that is too impossibly high and stretched too taut while also tickling. As Lugosi’s Count Dracula constitutes, in fact, the epitome of that deﬁnition, he is the paramount symbol of an aggregation of symbols. Yet he is only a symbol. John Cawelti notes how in the construction of the western, a “relatively brief stage in the social evolution of the West when outlaws or Indians posed a threat to the community’s stability has been erected into a timeless epic past in which heroic individual defenders of law and order without the vast social resources of police and courts stand poised against the threat of lawlessness or savagery” (1974, 58). The screen Lugosi, too, is extending and expanding a limited historical and cultural moment, indeed a moment refracted\n\n24\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\nthrough the lens of particular interests, as he generalizes about “Hungarian” character. And it is of this generalization that he is himself the paragon, a ﬁgure who is happy to stretch vowels in lazy delight or gnawing hunger, happy to scowl and stare. In saying, “You must be Hungarian,” then, he is meaning, “You must be such as I am.” In one phrase, the character Béla Lugosi is beckoning the character Ed Wood to inherit him; and the older, experienced actor Martin Landau is beckoning the younger, aspiring actor Johnny Depp to imitate, duplicate, eradicate him. Further, when Ed starts to imitate the “Hungarianness” of Lugosi’s bewitching gestures, he is in truth imitating not so much the structure of the gestures as Lugosi’s performance of them, his styling, his inﬂection. Thus it is that the scene captures the quality of apprenticeship and personal afﬁliation, a quality that suffuses Depp’s screen work altogether. The imitation is an intimacy. Can we believe that, at this screen moment and perfectly in tune with Lugosi’s gestures, Ed Wood is actually Hungarian, too—has actually assimilated an ethnicity by contagion? Ed Wood is and can only be from Poughkeepsie, once and forever—a young man around whose dazzled perspective one Vassar girl too many has pranced. He is a creature of the lumpenbourgeoisie, a migrant to Hollywood, sucked up in the Hollywood dream, ﬁred by a passionate belief that he can do what Orson Welles does: write, direct, produce, and star in his own fabulous motion pictures. Far from laying onto himself the mysterious dark cloaks of esoteric Hungarian history, like his buddy Lugosi, he ﬂits around in a blonde wig and an angora sweater. But as Depp plays him at this moment in Lugosi’s little house, there is “Hungarianness” in the dancing of Wood’s ﬁngers, and a distinct sense that the ethnicity of Lugosi has traveled through the air and infected his friend and neighbor to the core. Depp’s Ed Wood is so impressionably ravenous for Lugosi’s “Hungarianness,” he has imbibed it like a potion, and, further, in doing this he is devouring the essence of his friend in something of an echo of Lugosi’s screen devourings. He is a kind of Dracula of the evening. For an instant, indeed, our feeling of the dark mysticism is so intense that the “Hungarianness” seems absolutely inherent in Johnny Depp; that on “Lugosi’s” instructions, moved, that is, not merely by Landau’s performance but also by the knowledge of the historical Lugosi, he has willed it into being. If for Landau the characterization of this ethnicity proceeds outward and forward—from some “Lugosi” within\n\ndepp positions 25\n\nand behind toward a surface we see onscreen—for Depp it proceeds inward and backward, the screen “Ed Wood” appropriating the “Hungarian” spirit he catches from “Lugosi” and conferring it upon the actor who plays him, Depp. For there is hardly a doubt: it is not Ed Wood who seems to have become what “Lugosi” would have him become, it is Johnny Depp. Landau ﬁnds the character in himself and in his memory, and brings it out. Depp ﬁnds himself in the character. Another way to put this: the “Hungarian” infection can only pass from Lugosi to Depp—Lugosi, not Landau, because Landau is completely hidden inside his characterization. And Depp, not Wood, because Johnny Depp is never completely hidden inside his characterizations, not even, as we shall see, in the remarkable Edward Scissorhands, who is surely a triumph of makeup (by Irene Aparicio, Fern Buchner, Bridget Cook, Selena Miller, Matthew W. Mungle, Ve Neill, Rick Provenzano, Kim Santantonio, Susan Schuler-Page, Werner Sherer, Liz Spang, Rick Stratton, Yolanda Toussieng, Mary Ann Valdes, Lynda Kyle Walker, Brad Wilder, and Stan Winston) and costuming (by Colleen Atwood) to rival the most exquisite concoctions of Hollywood. There is for the viewer a sense of a double life onscreen with Johnny Depp, as though he is bonded through an invisible bridge of tissue to the character he is playing in such a way that what becomes of the character inevitably, and soon, becomes of him as well. Since Ed Wood has “become” Hungarian for the moment, Johnny is infected, and our sense is that while shooting this scene, at least, Johnny must also have “become” Hungarian. To clarify: by “Hungarian” I refer, of course, not to the datum of historical, geographical, and ethnic circumstance, nor merely to attributes that seem to ﬂoat off the surface of the character and evaporate around him, indications that he has been embedded in historical, geographical, or ethnic circumstance—say, the propensity to drama and romance, the sensitivity to profound sublimity, the revolutionary ﬁre, the taste for gulyás. “Hungarian” is not factual. When Lugosi says, “You must be Hungarian,” he means a mystique must ﬂoat away from you, a chill must invade the air; he means to point to not so much a concrete experience as a fantasy of experience, that one afﬁliates oneself with a certain body of imagery and narration, a certain library. One adopts a certain conviction, a dominance over circumstance, a pride in silence, a mask of seriousness in the face of life covering, perhaps, a regretful smile of loss and treasured hope. All this constitutes together something of a public performance, a waving\n\n26\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\nof ﬁngers. All this is couched in an inexplicability, a tempestuousness, something very far from bright cool rationality and method. One dances one’s “Hungarianness,” and so for all that it is civilized it is also primitive and young. To bring off this “Hungarianness,” Depp exercises his hands, ﬁxes his gaze, and widens the apertures of his eyes, forces himself to make no expression (and no hint of expression) with the mouth but to desire only optically, with heroic restraint, so that the desire is burning and consuming. Whether any of this would make sense to an actual Hungarian as “Hungarianness,” of course, is hardly the point (I ﬁnd it hard to imagine that it would); a transformation has taken place in the character, one commensurate with the very arbitrary label “Hungarian” that a history of watching popularizations from Hollywood has conditioned us to use, and a transformation, indeed, that has infected the actor, who is also, it seems, an aﬁcionado of the silver screen in the depths of his heart. To a certain mystical and entrancing ﬁxation of attention, a certain passionate and joyous belligerence, a certain nobility we have applied the label “Hungarian,” and if “Hungarian” one has to be to wave one’s ﬁngers powerfully and seductively at the “honey” who inhabits the television screen, then “Hungarian” Lugosi and Wood— Landau and Depp—have surely become. Of how many other actors can it be said that the acts of the characters they play seem to rub off on them? Brando, surely, who forever might have been a contender. Cary Grant. Bogart. Lugosi. Like these, Depp is present himself onscreen alongside his characters, one might even say in a playful bond of love with them. If there is a sense of homoeroticism in Depp’s performances, and I think it unquestionable that there is, perhaps it inheres exactly in this delicate business of afﬁliation and affection that is evident between him and the character he plays. When, much later in the ﬁlm, Wood meets Orson Welles (Vincent D’Onofrio) in Musso and Frank’s Restaurant, it is Welles, not the talented D’Onofrio, we sense in the encounter; yet it remains Depp, not just Wood, who seems exhilarated to be “meeting” him. To the argument that if this is true, Depp is simply not much of an actor, since he does not know how to embed himself fully in his performance, I would rejoin that Depp has his characteristic way of relating to the character he is playing and also that Depp is far more than an actor and also that in a blink of an eye, a breath, suddenly he is Ed Wood and then, just as suddenly, Ed Wood is gone.\n\ndepp positions 27\n\nWhat Grant, Brando, Lugosi, Bogart, and Depp have in common is a quality that has been depreciated in recent years by the grinding of the global publicity machine and by the pervasive mass-production of celebrity: stardom. Stars seize us in and through their characters, but also in spite of them, beside them, over and above them. Clint Eastwood has shown star quality, although not absolutely invariably— one sees it in High Plains Drifter and in Blood Work but not so much in Space Cowboys or in The Bridges of Madison County. The star never displaces the actor who is crafting a character, but he often sides with him. Dustin Hoffman has never gone beyond being an actor—one of astonishing range and insight. Tom Cruise has never gone beyond being a celebrity. Like Robert DeNiro before him, Leonardo DiCaprio began as an actor of chilling strength but allowed himself to be devoured by celebrity—contrast the steely Mean Streets or Taxi Driver with DeNiro’s recent work, for example, Analyze This; and What’s Eating Gilbert Grape or The Basketball Diaries with Titanic. Jeff Bridges has the look of a star but is, through and through, and notably, an actor; for example in Fearless or Starman or The Big Lebowski. And not all stars are immense—it is not the size of the stardom that is its essence. Something of the actor and something of the character must co-exist in a ﬁeld of boundless fascination and pleasure, so that we ﬁnd ourselves looking without needing to ﬁnd, observing without calculation, reaching and yet hoping never quite to grasp. Johnny Depp isn’t a broad canvas like Brando, or a dazzling array of lights like Astaire, or a paragon of classlessness like Grant, or an eternal enigma like Bogart, or a monument to loss like Lugosi, but he has the wonder of an innocent, the passion of a person who has been much denied, the wit of a juggler, and a commanding physical technique to rival James Dean’s. As to ethnicity, Johnny Depp has many times taken upon himself its mantle: a Romanisch horseman in The Man Who Cried, a Sicilian cop in Donnie Brasco, a Mexican soldier in Before Night Falls, a Spanish psychotic in Don Juan DeMarco, a French-Canadian author in The Source, a French balladeer in Chocolat—thus in a way privileging what Steven Alan Carr calls “voices that had heretofore spoken from the margins” (2001, 2). While Allen and Albert Hughes acknowledged that their From Hell is a “white movie” (Overpeck 2002, 41), Depp’s Inspector Frederick Aberline is an opium addict living his life in a dream-state, thus, like Edward Scissorhands, everything of an alien,\n\n28\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\nso very marginalized as to be almost voiceless. Nor is ethnicity alien to Depp offscreen. On his mother’s side, one of his biographers writes, he is the grandson of a Cherokee, a young man who inherited “the sharp cheekbones and sculptured visage that was to grace a thousand magazine covers the world over as he grew to maturity in the public gaze” (Robb 1996, 16). As well, writes another, there is “a fair amount of Irish and German in [Johnny’s] background” (Heard 2001, 2). Onscreen, to be sure, his “Hungarian” and other ethnic moments are fashioned, and also dispensed with, so casually and with so little apparent effort (Depp has a keen ear for linguistic nuance) that ethnicity seems to become ﬂuid and ﬂeeting, entirely of the moment. Ethnicity for the Depp we see onscreen, indeed, is situational tincture more than historical afﬁliation, and so it is that his performances are continuous modulations in ethnic being, this possibly because his extreme idiosyncrasy alienates him perpetually from our complete identiﬁcation, estranges him from our familiarities. In From Hell he lapses frequently into that opiated stupor, inhabiting a dreamland inaccessible to us as we inhabit the hyperrational territory of the narrative; as opium-eater he inhabits a radically separated ethnos. In Blow, by contrast, he affronts our pleasure-seeking sensibility by meandering through the story in an obsessive hunger for proﬁt. As Ed Wood, when he responds to the tacit invitation to try being “Hungarian,” the speed and delicacy of his response suggest immediately a desperation to try being anything else than what he is, to voyage. One hears an echo of T. S. Eliot: “Not fare well, /But fare forward, voyagers.” If ethnicity can be an anchor and lock, a basis for organizing powerlessness and hence a means of constraining and limiting freedom and opportunity, it is also a marker, a means of ﬁxing both identity and experience in the oceanic ﬁeld of variation and ﬂux. The desire to attach a stable identity to human experience, which is constantly in motion, to call someone “this” but not “that,” aims for a hierarchy of value in which statuses are aligned vertically and rewards distributed unequally, even as afﬁliations and loyalties based on ethnic identiﬁcation systematically operate to render some institutionalized pathways accessible, give basis for shared history and experience, and mount a platform for convivially interconnected sentiment. But no one has ethnicity before humanity. And the search to pin ethnicity on us is also an attack, an attempt to apprehend. That Johnny Depp’s\n\ndepp positions 29\n\nidentity onscreen is so very hard to establish within a matrix of ethnicities suggests that his ﬁlm form is in combat with hierarchizing tendencies, labels, ﬁxed approaches, historical imprisonments. He persists in being one of “Those drowsy ships that dream of sailing forth;/ It is to satisfy/ Your least desire” (Baudelaire 1983–85).\n\nIj Yet it is also true, and odd to note, that only in a very few performances does Depp build for his audience a distinct sense of otherness and unfamiliarity, that he creates a being in meeting whom we can discern in ourselves an awkward feeling of strangeness and distance. Most of the time, whatever he is pretending to be, Romanisch (Cesar) or German American (Glen Lantz) or Italian (Dean Corso) or English (Frederick Aberline), we are instantly at home with him in a kind of postmodern space that Vivian Sobchack describes, following Fredric Jameson, as depthless, simulacral, and one in which “our social and ethnic afﬁnities have been supplanted by afﬁnities of consumption and cosmetic display” (1991, 335). In other words, we recognize the codes being used in his performance, standing outside them so that they are indeed intelligible to us and instantly identiﬁable and yet also ﬁnding them sufﬁciently familiar from repetitive use that they hardly seem strange, hardly seem like characteristics of the “other” anymore. “In an earlier time,” Sobchack asserts, “being ethnic meant being part of a marginalized, yet coherent and relatively stable social group—one both perceived and represented by the dominant (and unethnic or assimilated) culture and by its own members as exclusively different and other from that dominant culture by virtue of its maintenance of speciﬁc codes of language, dress, manner, kinship, social and religious structure, and of its particular history and mythology” (1991, 332); and so she stands at once on two sides of the line that separates the one who sees ethnicity from the ethnic one he sees. Kinship, religious and social structure, and manner are “codes,” after all, only for those who do not experience them directly, those who stand apart to label. Being “part” of a “coherent” group was antithetical to using codes of display. That ethnicity can be seen as “codes” would seem itself to be part of the ﬂattening and consumerist logic of postmodernism. If Depp’s “ethnic” actions are not necessarily predictable or easily accommodated to, still his character, his presentation, and his personality tend to seem comfortable\n\n30\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\nfor us, even neighborly, in part because they are rendered as images— ﬁrst, images like all other images; and secondly, images to which we have become increasingly habituated and which are therefore every day less alien and strange. Indeed, he seems proximate, as though his performance is being whispered gently in our ear. This is, perhaps, an effect not so much of his being at ease before the lens as of his manifesting exactly the kind of dis-ease we might expect to feel, ourselves, in his place: in an extended interview about the making of Lost in La Mancha, he is continually picking shreds of tobacco from his lip, rubbing his chin, touching his mouth as though to ascertain whether it is moving when he speaks. Yet these self-conscious gestures we share, too. In front of an interviewer’s camera, he is suddenly camera-shy. The sense of otherness that is present in Depp onscreen so much less than we expect it to be ﬁnds a clear description in Simone de Beauvoir, for whom “otherness is a fundamental category of human thought”: No group ever sets itself up as the One without at once setting up the Other over against itself. If three travelers chance to occupy the same compartment, that is enough to make vaguely hostile “others” out of all the rest of the passengers on the train. In small-town eyes all persons not belonging to the village are “strangers” and suspect; to the native of a country all who inhabit other countries are “foreigners”; Jews are “different” for the anti-Semite, Negroes are “inferior” for American racists, aborigines are “natives” for colonists, proletarians are the “lower class” for the privileged. (1989, xxiii) Like De Beauvoir, when I invoke otherness, I do not mean to connote any particular visible or performable characteristic, or any salient quality presumed by those who label otherness to be present beyond the ﬁeld of direct perception. The qualities or characteristics attributed to “others,” of course, can neatly follow from the act of creating an alien category in order to deﬁne a self: once one has the category, one ﬁlls it with attributes. And usually with Depp, as in the characters I have listed above, although plenty of historical, cultural, or racial reasons are given through the performance to merit categorization of his onscreen personality as other, it is also true that he\n\ndepp positions\n\n31\n\nmanages to draw himself to us as a distinct familiar, a self of our own, an innocent. It is in this sense that he is chameleon-like, and that his presence is so globally accessible (both aesthetically and in marketing). A few of his characters, further, drink strangeness from their surround: Gilbert Grape from his family and friends, George Jung from his business, Ichabod Crane from the setting in which he must act—but even these seem instantly recognizable or knowable; their strangeness is entirely a cozy and comprehensible strangeness. But Ed Wood’s Hungarian moment is of another order altogether. Perhaps it is the simplicity of him saying nothing, arching his immense black eyebrows, and waving his ﬁngers in the eerie light, something just as direct as this unheimlich gesture, that pushes us back. It is certainly not that Depp seems “Hungarian” for even a moment. Yet he manages to acquire the ﬂavor of someone who is no longer Johnny Depp, thereby dislodging us from the previous character personalities we brought to the viewing experience. It is precisely a gesture of the unheimlich, what Freud called “the uncanny” (1919), that we see in Ed Wood. And I would claim that in Nick of Time, in the persona of Gene Watson, the father whose child is kidnapped and who has but ninety or so minutes to ﬁnd her (the same ninety or so minutes that constitute the running time of the ﬁlm), Depp reaches a kind of apotheosis of cinematic uncanniness. The “uncanny,” writes Freud, “belongs to all that is terrible—to all that arouses dread and creeping horror; it is equally certain, too, that the word is not always used in a clearly deﬁnable sense, so that it tends to coincide with whatever excites dread” (368). Further, as Freud shows, the uncanny is very closely related to the canny, the familiar, and “leads back to something long known to us, once very familiar” (369–370). In order to see how Gene Watson, the dutiful father who risks his life to save his child, has about him this bloodcurdling quality, we must make a brief diversion. It is astonishing to think how, in theatrical performance, the smallest details of the organization of activity can rip through the screen of ﬁction for members of an audience, causing the drama to momentarily collapse. A small barrette falls accidentally from a character’s coiffure and instantaneously, as the object gleams in the stage light upon the ﬂoorboards, it assumes the pungent and devastating quality of belonging to the actress who is performing the character, not to the character at all; and the hair out of which it fell suddenly\n\n32 johnny depp starts here\n\ntransforms into part of the actress’s body, the coiffure done up in a dressing room backstage and not in a character’s boudoir. The character entirely, and instantaneously, melts away. So it is that a performer onstage will trouble herself to kick such an object under the furniture, that it may not persist within the viewing ﬁeld of the audience to disrupt the show and the very being of the entity the actress is engaged in offering. An actor muffs a line or a syllable of a word, and suddenly the world of the stage is punctured by the persistent factuality of speech and its vulnerabilities, lips, throats, the actors’ presence together onstage, their having rehearsed, the script they rehearsed, their knowledge of the language, of words, the structure of the lines in the script, the tongue of the actor and its sluggishness around the syllables of the threatening word, the very presence of the embarrassed audience sitting around in the darkness observing this catastrophe in a paralysis of transformation and horror. Or an actor, walking into his scene, must bend suddenly and seize from the ﬂoor a barrette, glowing in the stage light, that fell off a character’s head in the scene before and that a foot did not quite manage to kick under a chair. What is signiﬁcant here is a present and observable fact, a reality, that is out of the actor’s momentary control; something totally unintended; something continuously present, and yet unseen, not looked for, not noticed, but always existing: as Freud quotes from Grimm’s dictionary, “The further idea is developed of something withdrawn from the eyes of others, something concealed, secret, and this idea is expanded in many ways” (376). The reality of ﬁction may slip, is anxious. In his essay on “Architectural Anxiety in Digital Culture” (2001), Anthony Vidler writes of anxious space, nervous space, as related to Freud’s uncanny. One sees in Nick of Time inpouchings and tunnelings of a kind of modernist nervous space. In all his ﬁlms, as a matter of fact, Depp exhibits an extraordinary grace in his movement and pose, so that narrative space unfolds around him in a measured, even baroque, way. But in Nick of Time, he is forced in an extended desperation to grope through space. His personality is like that of the camera in L’Année dernière à Marienbad, ceaselessly wandering in fear. In Nick of Time, Depp manifests one particular aspect of Freud’s unheimlich, which is that of the double. “The ‘double’ has become a vision of terror, just as after the fall of their religion the gods took on daemonic shapes,” writes Freud (1919, 389). And one particularly\n\ndepp positions 33\n\nchilling aspect of doubling is a “factor of involuntary repetition which surrounds with an uncanny atmosphere what would otherwise be innocent enough” (390). In this ﬁlm, alone of all his work, Depp plays what might be called an untransformed character—untransformed in the surface, technical, discernible sense associated with make-up, costume, accent, gesture, posture, and so on. Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl slinks, and this slinking is what I am referring to as a transformation; transformations, too, are his teeth, his braided beard, his gleaming gaze. Edward Scissorhands is a masterpiece of make-up and costuming, and so in becoming him, Depp is transformed. But aside from a tidy haircut and a pair of expensive prescription eyeglasses—eyeglasses chosen speciﬁcally to ﬁt with the clothing and presentation of the character and not in any way to make themselves obvious—the character of Watson is a version of Depp onscreen that seems non-racial, non-ethnic, and unothered. It is thus a kind of double of all the other Depps, which are in some sense one and the same in their manifestation as transformed Depps. Gene Watson is little other than a bourgeois, contemporary, suburban young adult—close, in fact, to what Johnny can be presumed to be by those who have no access to him, and at a distance from the other screen characterizations Johnny has made. (Conversely, we can identify “weird” Johnny with those other screen characterizations; then Gene stands out as the hollowed, too tame stranger.) If Depp onscreen typically presents us with a mask, then the Depp in this ﬁlm is the double of that mask. Gene Watson is colorless, ﬂavorless, utile, and agile but without his own impetus, civil to a fault. In all of this ﬁlm he is like the secret revealed in the disturbing moment when performance is disrupted; yet at the same time he is engaged wholly and ﬂuidly in a performance. Thus, watching this ﬁlm (in the context of other Depp ﬁlms, not on its own) seems to have the chilling effect of presenting formally the denuded actor who otherwise appears only by accident. Gene is a perfectly choreographed happenstance. It is as though, in a ﬁlm of a stage performance, an actor suddenly stoops to pick up a barrette, glowing in the light, that fell out of a character’s hair in the scene before; and the bending, the retrieval, the deft placement of the object on a table next to a dictionary, constitute not the salvage of a performance but the performance itself.\n\n34\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\nOne further twist. When an actor is performing—it may seem stunning to audiences to realize—he does not see himself. (We are so utterly wrapped up in watching him, it does not occur to us to imagine the limits imposed on his own ability to watch himself.) His appreciation of the performance, therefore, is at a great remove from what is possible for the audience. It is also true that he has in mind, and in his care, certain arcane technical matters that might be beyond the audience’s ken (as they are not accustomed to, or professional at, mounting performance), and certain dramaturgical concerns the revelation of which would collapse or ruin the performance for them. But beyond this, even to the degree that he is relaxed into, and infused with, the performance, it is not a construction he is placed to observe. All acting is thus blind acting in a sense. One fashions a face and corrects it, modulates it and navigates with it, without seeing what one is accomplishing. So it is that in performing Gene Watson, in playing his part in the construction of Nick of Time, Depp can hardly have been anything but innocent of the uncanniness of his role. Screen actors may see dailies, or may attend a screening of the ﬁlm, thus having a chance to see themselves as audiences will see them, but only after the fact of the performance is sealed. Yet there is no reason to suppose that Depp watches either his dailies or his ﬁlms, and so there is no reason for supposing that the uncanniness I write about here would be part of his regard or self-knowledge. He has claimed, indeed, that he does not watch his ﬁlms, or, generally, ﬁlms at all, except to take his children. When nominated for the Academy Award for Pirates of the Caribbean, “he saw none of his fellow nominees’ performances and guesses the last movie he saw was Pirates— and only because he had to” (Tyrangiel 2004, 78). If, however, none of us is placed precisely to see what we do, most of us are not judged exclusively on the basis of that appearance. For actors to perform at all, then, is an act of extreme courage. When the performance is uncanny, it strikes at once the very strange—the surface of the role that is, above all, phantasmagorical—and the very homely and familiar, the body of the actor actually committed to public action, and in this case, a body relatively untransformed (in the way Depp’s body typically is onscreen) but at the same time also not untransformed in a way the actor is in a position fully to appreciate. Gene Watson is rather like the costume that has fallen off one of the other characters Johnny plays and that must swiftly, somehow, be swept offscreen. Our sense that this is true is what gives us a chill.\n\ndepp positions 35\n\nApprehending You cannot step into the same river twice. Heraclitus\n\nA\n\nt the very least, a scene like the “Hungarian” episode in Ed Wood nicely illustrates the sort of problem that confronts the viewer’s paramount need to apprehend the screen Depp, to discover—grasp, penetrate, be satisﬁed with—him by ﬁnding and exploiting the elusive, even intangible, boundary that separates his person from his characterization. Regarding that boundary, take, for example, teeth. A few times in Ed Wood, Ed opens his mouth to reveal (terrifyingly) that just beneath the cuddly angora exterior, the face with skin as smooth as that of a teenage girl, wait Draculaic teeth, misshapen, sharp, obscene (teeth from the world of Jerry Lewis’s Julius Kelp in The Nutty Professor): once he shows them to teasingly frighten a little boy at Lugosi’s door on Halloween eve, later again in full femme array at the end of a party scene. When we see these fangs, we have absolutely no doubt that they are fake, that they are artiﬁcial appendages applied by Wood for an exaggerated comic and dramatic effect in some non-theatrical everyday situation (Depp, of course, using prostheses to simulate Wood using prostheses). The teeth under these teeth on the screen are Ed Wood’s “authentic” teeth, presumably, badly out of alignment and not well cared for. But are these underteeth—the teeth of “Ed Wood”—in fact Johnny Depp’s teeth, just as “Ed Wood’s” body is Johnny Depp’s body? Or has Johnny Depp implanted in himself “Ed Wood” dentures over which, in the persona of Ed Wood, he further, and ostensibly, implants Dracula fangs? These questions are far less material as regards the narrative, to be sure, than as regards the viewer’s apprehension of that narrative. What is it that I am seizing as I gaze at the screen—a view of the inside of Johnny’s real mouth for and as itself, or a view of his mouth as the setting of an unreal dramaturgical place, the buccal cavity of a character? If I am optically entering Johnny’s actual mouth, not Ed’s; if I am seeing Johnny’s teeth, not Ed’s, the ﬁlmic experience is intimate in a way that exceeds the experience I have if all the dentistry I see is part of an elaborate set-up. The conﬁguring of the actor’s personal body as the character’s, through makeup and prosthetics, can\n\n36\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\nseem to be extended inward, the performance of Wood being given not only by the transformation of Depp’s exterior surfaces but also by the transmogriﬁcation of his interior ones. Or is the impenetrable inside world of the performer not excitingly extended outward at all? Do the interior linings of cavities, in such a case, rather than revealing, continue the limiting presentation that begins with face and costume and continues with skin, being themselves not secrets but coverings of secrets? To apprehend Depp, must we go even beyond what is presented when he opens his mouth? Surely the mouth we see is both Depp’s and Wood’s, in that Wood is the nexus of our interpretation while Depp is the origin of the manifestation. But how can we understand it, in the quick of being presented with it, except as an interior space co-extensive and copresent with all the surfaces on the screen—that is, as “Wood’s” mouth? What we see, after all, is the picture of the inside of a mouth, something which, like any picture, is withdrawn even as it appears to protrude. It is a provocation, a sign of the absence of Depp. Like every image of Depp, it is a sign of his replacement. Here is the kind of knot one gets tied up in with Johnny Depp, even though, in truth, one could very well be tied up in the same way with any other actor who does mouth work; except that, oddly, one isn’t. Dustin Hoffman in the dentist’s chair in Marathon Man does not provoke these musings because he presents at no time such a challenge of surfaces as does Depp. When Depp opens his mouth as Ed Wood, he is also opening his mouth as Johnny Depp, saying, in effect, “Here’s my mouth. What do you make of it?” in precise expectation that indeed we will make something. Depp has Wood open his mouth in a certain way in order that he, Depp, may open his mouth. The mouth is at once Wood’s and Depp’s, yet as it opens and we concentrate on the teeth, thanks to a skillfully placed keylight, it is Depp the present performer, not Wood the extinct subject of performance, the teeth invoke. Quickly the mouth closes, the body moves off— Wood, not Depp. Symbolically, the attempt to get into Johnny Depp’s mouth, as it were, is the general quest to ﬁnd him, to commit apprehension, which permeates all the popular journalism that has been devoted to this actor (in lieu of serious scholarship), and permeates, indeed, most backstage journalism altogether in this simulacral age. But with Depp, apprehension goes beyond entry. At issue, too, is Depp in ﬂight from the hungry grasp of the narrative that persists in trying to net\n\ndepp positions 37\n\nhim. He is always present, as it were, beside as well as inside his character; what happens to the character happens to him. In Mike Newell’s Donnie Brasco, for example, he is an undercover FBI agent masquerading as a hoodlum in order to assist in putting a sting on a coterie of maﬁa thugs. It is more than evident that betrayers and informers are sure targets for execution among the thugs, and so the viewer’s easy afﬁliation with Depp is put in continuing jeopardy by the precarious structure of situations in which his true identity may inadvertently be revealed. One day, at the Miami airport, he is encountered by a former acquaintance who calls him by the “wrong” name in front of the wrong people: to escape from this near catastrophe, he is forced to dramatize himself as the unwilling victim of a homosexual pickup, rolling his old colleague in a particularly brutal way. Another time, asked to remove his shoes in a Japanese restaurant, he is forced by the coincidence of having planted an FBI wire on his foot to adamantly refuse, ﬁnally, indeed, to participate in a brawl in which a poor man is beaten to a pulp in the men’s room. And his wife (Anne Heche) is so distraught and devastated at his prolonged absences from the family (he misses Christmas dinner and his daughter’s ﬁrst communion) for reasons she cannot be permitted to know, she forces him into marital therapy at the hands of a smug practitioner who attacks him with platitudes in total ignorance of the generalized ﬂight that is his present way of life. As Donnie Brasco, then, Depp is being chased by the gang, in the sense that he must survive their relentless and systematic vigilance for traitors all the while possessing the sure knowledge that he is one; and as FBI Special Agent Joe Pistone, he is being chased by his wife, and also by his superiors in the Bureau—men who are increasingly removed from the action they are monitoring. The effect of this complex structure is to induce on Johnny’s part and on ours a deep apprehensiveness about apprehension, so that as the ﬁlm progresses we ﬁnd ourselves becoming panic-stricken at every human encounter he has (and fearful of what might happen to those who come too close to him). His tight relationship with Lefty Ruggerio (Al Pacino) is a locus of diffuse panic, heightened by Pacino’s deftly manic performance. Donnie’s contacts in the government are frighteningly inept and untrustworthy: the managers are exactly the sort of well-meaning boobs likely to compromise his secrecy without the least self-awareness. His young colleagues, amicable and adoring, are green and terriﬁed, reliant upon a professional-\n\n38\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\nism he must struggle continuously to mount in migraine-producing and traumatic circumstances. We fear for his life, therefore, every time he is to be found with Lefty, regardless of how humorous or bathetic the scene; we fear for his life every time he encounters his wife, since her frustrations and anger will surely increase his own high-strung emotion and perhaps carry him over the edge; we fear for his life when he is with other agents, since they are so maladroit by comparison; and we fear for his life when he begins to rise in stature among the Maﬁosi, since the new boss, Sonny Black (Michael Madsen), and his crowd are colder than Lefty, less affectionate, less trusting, and any tiny hint of a false move will be a death sentence. In this taut and vitiating narrative, then, we are torn between a desire to grasp Johnny and a frantic hope that he will elude grasping. If he eludes grasping we may continue in our desire to grasp him, we may keep running. And the pleasure world of the ﬁlm can be extended. In Jeremy Leven’s Don Juan DeMarco, the quest to apprehend Johnny is given a bizarre twist. Here the issue is framed in ideological terms. Don Juan (Depp) is a young man who has made love to ﬁfteen hundred and one women, but who, on the verge of suicide, falls under the legal and interpersonal control of an aging psychiatrist (Marlon Brando). The psychiatrist is entrusted with the bureaucratic job of committing the young man, but something about Don Juan’s seductive manner and astonishing worldliness leads him instead to become his patient’s ally against the institution, even his patient’s pupil. Where the potential grasp in Donnie Brasco is execution, in Don Juan it is a diagnosis, literally a signature on an institutional document. What makes the ﬁlm fascinating as a document about its star is that Don Juan is avowedly helpless to prevent Dr. Jack Mickler from signing the paper that will commit him, except through his powers of speech and persuasion. There is a kind of cat-andmouse game played out between Depp as embodiment and Depp as agent of the script, since his every action of self-defense is constituted as a retreat into the dialogue provided for his character. Yet it is also the speech—that is, the script, the metadiegesis—that keeps Dr. Mickler’s page unturned, his decision unmade, his curiosity alive, perhaps as much in the curiously serious Spanish accent through which Depp delivers it as in the ﬂowery phrases with which it is composed. If Don Juan can but be persuasive, Mickler will hold back for a few days, then a few more days, and so on—will keep him off\n\ndepp positions 39\n\nthe tranquilizers that will dissolve his romantic mind. Medication is the sword that can attack Don Juan. Words are his defensive parry. His romantic spirit, his engagement of love—that is to say, Depp as the incarnation of carnality—is the object of our apprehension, the thing we would stab. And we must make a judgment as to where Don Juan really is, in Johnny’s body or in his talk. If we attempt to approach him rationally, we are reduced to the status of an institutional worker whose signature can be damning. Like Dr. Mickler, our choice is whether to give in to rational dictates or to deny them and respond out of poetry and emotion. If the ﬁlm is about Dr. Mickler’s decision to accept Don Juan as the physical and sentimental being he claims to be, it is also a venue whereby we can accept Johnny Depp as a galvanizing presence notwithstanding what he says onscreen. Everything he says, after all—poetic as it may be—can be rationally taken by us as script. Can we, like Mickler, transcend our script? The word “apprehend” has at least two distinct readings, both of which I mean to engage when applying it to Depp’s screen performance. It is a laying hands upon, or grasping, in the physical sense; and an intellectual seizure, a tying up or bordering, an encapsulation of a substance or ﬁeld within some perimeter of understanding and discourse. In both the physical and the intellectual sense, apprehension is learning, in that we come into ownership of knowledge that potentially alters the way we go on to experience and understand the world. To apprehend is also to fear, to hold back from. That, too, is a way of learning and having the world. What brings apprehension into consideration as we engage with Johnny Depp onscreen is precisely his unremitting elusiveness, not only that he shifts and transforms himself radically from ﬁlm to ﬁlm and role to role but also that even in any given scene, as we watch him move and interact in character, we sense a presence that is, above all, ﬂuid. He is like the Heraclitean river into which one cannot step twice, always changing, always running away. To think of John Wayne is not to have the same sense, for example; Wayne is a solid: recall him splayed on the ground contentedly, like a plump old owl, as he observes John Ireland and Montgomery Clift going at one another in the ﬁnale of Red River. To think of Cary Grant is to encounter a vapor: Roger O. Thornhill dancing along the station quay with Eve Kendall’s overnight case under his arm in North by Northwest or appraising an appraiser, his ex-wife Rosalind Russell, in His Girl Friday. But Depp tantalizes physically exactly\n\n40\n\njohnny depp starts here\n\ninasmuch as he hides or escapes—delivering ice cream to Mary Steenburgen in What’s Eating Gilbert Grape—so that every line reading, every pose, every gesture is an ambiguity once it is set in the mise-en-scène. I am thinking in particular of a scene in Blow where Depp, as George Jung, and Jordi Mollà, as his buddy Diego Delgado, have amassed so much money—literally so many pieces of printed currency—they are having difﬁculty locating a niche in which to store it all in their modest apartment. We watch Johnny trekking from room to room with boxes of bills piled in his arms, money drifting away from him and ﬂoating like so much manna to the ﬂoor. In his bouncing gait is happiness and astonishment, pure boyish spirit and innocence even in the fact of the colossal illegality in which he has involved himself to produce this fortune. In his desperation to hurry to move the money, to hurry to ﬁnd more space, is a mature urgency, the thrust of a producer hard upon a ﬁnished work. His furtive eyes and his springy body do not match, and create a kind of time ﬁeld in which he migrates back and forth as we watch—is he a boy or is he a man? Is the money dangerous or is it the stuff of pure fun? To see the material ﬂoating around the room, piled in box after box after box after box, to see the room overﬂowing, is to have a sense of capacity, fulsomeness, plenitude, even excess, and delightful monstrosity. But to transform the objective wads of cash into bank balances is to perform a summation, a mathematics of desire, a foxtrot of collection, appropriation, entitlement, and investment—in short, to distance oneself from the momentary pleasures of the body and the eye. There is no single, ﬁxed reading of Depp’s persona or motive here. I think the scene important for another reason, however. Since it is Johnny Depp being articulated onscreen, and also at the same time innumerable boxes of hard cash, an equation is being offered that links Depp directly to currency in two senses—Establishment (that is, wealth) and continual motion (that is, play). The project of setting ourselves productively within the antimony of ﬁxity and currency, of drawing a line around Depp even as he never stops moving, is thus both embodied and signiﬁed by this scene in which the material currency—the cash—and the condition of currency—Depp and Jordi Mollà frenetically pacing back and forth to pick up and store more and more and more and more and more money—are entirely superimposed. To bring ﬁxity to this scenario, one would have to stop the boys in their tracks and count the money, thus itemizing the\n\ndepp positions 41\n\nstockpile for the record and ending the seemingly endless multiplication of proﬁt by capping it, while at the same time leashing Johnny, petrifying his energy, positioning him once and for all. This is precisely the “positioning” that occurs with a too-sumptuous ﬁnality at the end of the ﬁlm, a source of immense dissatisfaction for the audience as well as for the character.\n\nNot Finished\n\nI\n\nn his book Frame Analysis, among other things an excellent approach to the structure of stagings, Erving Goffman describes a feature of theatrical events that is of particular interest to me here: “Spoken interaction is opened up ecologically; the participants do not face each other directly or (when more than two) through the best available circle, but rather stand at an open angle to the front so that the audience can literally see into the encounter” (1974, 140). In motion pictures, of course, the audience, as John Van Druten once put it, is the camera, seeing into the encounter because literally interposed in the space theatrical audiences dream of inhabiting. Film action is in general “opened up ecologically” exactly to the degree that the camera is ideally placed to facilitate seeing-into. But in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, Goffman prepared the “stage” upon which he struts in Frame Analysis, arguing that conventional situated interaction is itself typically structured dramaturgically, according to the same principles and with a view to addressing the same constraints as guide and face professional theatrical performers; yet within a different deﬁning frame and with correspondingly different consequences. If everyday interaction is already microstructurally dramatic, dramatic staging dramatizes the dramatic, is in effect hyperdramatic. Already in dyadic interaction, each participant must open out his concerns, alignments, intentions, motives, and interpretations through stylizations of various kinds. As staging opens up interaction to the perception of the third who guards (Simmel’s tertius gaudens), so does ﬁlm, but by transporting the audience into the interaction rather than reconﬁguring the interactional alignment along sightlines. So it is that in The Glass Menagerie, Tennessee Williams can have a character say, “We go to the movies instead of moving.” In terms of characters’ interaction, ﬁlm’s relation\n\n42 johnny depp starts here\n\nto everyday life can be seen as similar to theater’s, in that it constitutes a reconstitution of operational space, both an invasion and an invitation that “open up” to experience and perception what had earlier been a relatively closed world. Hypothetically at least, then, the camera brings us as close to Johnny Depp as we could come in everyday life if, in some charged dance of recognition, intimacy, and feeling he disclosed himself to us; it constructs an intimate space in which we can share habitation with him. This is accomplished ﬁlmically through lens manipulation—the medium shot and the close-up—and also through the staging convention of the intercutting of reverse shots in conversations. Yet what is striking is how little, inside this circuit of proximity, we manage to learn. This is because of the curious silences, and more curious utterances, we hear when Johnny presents himself. The spoken interaction involving Johnny Depp, in short, is not opened up ecologically in the way ﬁlmgoers have come to expect the interaction of screen characters will be. We are presented with typical close-ups and medium shots, but in them we are likely to ﬁnd the Depp character entranced, stymied, staring outward in fascination, silenced by thought or wonder, introspective, even demonical, turned away from our curiosity to an inner world of experience. Instructive in this regard is the moment of his introduction in Tim Burton’s Edward Scissorhands, a scene where the neighborhood Avon lady, Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest), has taken it upon herself to visit a castle on the hill no one has visited before. Upstairs in an attic illuminated by daylight streaming through a torn-away roof, she sees him huddled in a corner, barely distinguishable from a pile of darkened ﬂuttering rags. Her attention is attracted in his direction, as is ours, by his ﬁrst expressions, the indeﬁnable sounds of polished metal shears lightly (that is, nervously) snipping at the air. “I can see that I’ve disturbed you,” says she, catching sight of him and backing away. “How stupid of me! I’ll just be going now.” “Don’t go,” he pleads, but very timidly. It is an invitation, a prayer, a plaintive whisper, offered by Depp in an unaccented treble register like two soundings of the same high note on a ﬂute. In his utterance there is nothing of command, alignment, intentionality, status, capability, muscularity, direction. A worn old door opening upon a squeaky hinge could produce the same two helpless tones.\n\ndepp positions 43\n\nNow he is fully lit and Peg sees the long scissors that are his hands. “Oh my! What happened to you?” “I’m not ﬁnished,” says the boy, inconclusively, as though even his thought of being unﬁnished is unﬁnished. Here we see that with dark purple lipstick a Betty Boop pout has been painted on his lips against a face covered with white. His hair is stiff, sticking up in all directions. His eyes are two saucers, unblinking, huge, ﬁlled with . . . what? Fear? Wonder? Apprehension? Hunger? And then what, precisely, can we take to be the meaning of “I’m not ﬁnished”? Surely it suggests with exquisite compactness and directness a diegetic reality and ﬁeld of possibility: that this character is the result of someone’s tinkering; that the tinkering was interrupted; that therefore the character’s life, not unlike that of Pinocchio, is shaped and dictated by his circumstance. The boy has scissors for hands because his maker didn’t get around to putting the “real” hands on yet, and all of the ﬁlm is a discursion into what is left to him as a life when he must go through the day with this ability/debility. He can become a fabulous haircutter and topiary artist. More: he can inadvertently cut people, cut himself, cut his world (he is a born editor, a walking homage to Hitchcock, who proclaimed, “Scissors are the best way” [Truffaut 1985, 346]). But that is only the story in the ﬁlm. What more are we given by the knowledge that he is not ﬁnished, as we struggle to grasp not only Edward Scissorhands but Johnny Depp who is playing him, Johnny Depp who was convinced, indeed, that he “was Edward” (Depp 1995, x)? Is it not true that as much as the “I” who is speaking is Edward, Peg’s interlocutor, he is also Edward, the ﬁctive creation of Tim Burton? “I am not ﬁnished” also means that the script for the ﬁlm is hanging, that the character is only partially worked out, that the ﬁlm is nothing but a hypothesis among many other possible hypotheses. In short, it is not by "
