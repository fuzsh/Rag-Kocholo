        "text": "Jessica Melugin is director of the Center for Technology & Innovation at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. She’s also a Freedom Conservatism signatory. Melugin’s research focuses on technology issues including antitrust, online privacy, artificial intelligence, telecommunications, social media content and net neutrality regulation. Her writings have appeared in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, USA Today, Bloomberg Law, National Review and elsewhere. She has been cited in The Washington Post, Politico, U.S. News & World Report and Variety. She is also a frequent cable news television and radio guest. In a recent Washington Examiner piece, Melugin discussed the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to send the NetChoice v. Paxton and Moody v. NetChoice cases back to lower federal courts. Both involved attempted by Republican-led states — Texas and Florida, respectively — to regulate editorial decisions by online platforms. While issuing no sweeping ruling on the constitutionality of such regulations, the high court’s majority signaled major concerns about them. The “editorial judgments” of social-media companies are “protected expressive activity,” the majority wrote. “It remains to be seen,” Melugin concluded, “if state legislators will pass new laws in attempts to accomplish their ends but not run afoul of the First Amendment protections the Supreme Court warned of.” In another recent article, this one for National Review, she wrote that the Biden administration’s plan to investigate artificial-intelligence companies will hamper American industry in global competition. “Antitrust regulators now believe they can scrutinize U.S. firms even in markets that are competitive and are in no danger of ceasing to be,” Melugin wrote, but they have “an especially poor record of predicting the future when it comes to the technology sector.” You can read more about Melugin and other FreeCons here: https://lnkd.in/eNNbv6c3\n\nI’m pro-shot clock — for regulation: “During its 2023 session, the General Assembly passed a law that mandates a 45-day ‘shot clock’ for municipalities to complete their review of permit applications for commercial construction or multifamily residential projects. It provides a 60-day window for ‘at-risk’ permits, in which applicants accept full liability should there be subsequent problems with building structures or foundations. “Also last year, the General Assembly instituted other shot clocks. The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality can consider air-quality permits for major modifications for up to 270 days, and for up to 90 days for minor modifications. In water-quality certifications for dredging and pipeline projects, DEQ has a 90-day shot clock for permitting projects for which public hearings are legally required. For projects without a hearing requirement, the clock runs out in 60 days. “There’s nothing magical about these specific numbers. It’s possible that as industries and regulators adapt to the new rules, lawmakers may have to tweak the day counts. But the basic concept of regulatory shot clocks is sound. It properly balances the legitimate interest in public health and safety with the legitimate interest in ensuring public access to housing, employment, and affordable energy.” https://lnkd.in/emVtUV65\n\nOn this date in 1783, one of history's greatest revolutionary leaders, Simón Bolívar, was born in Venezuela. An admirer of Thomas Jefferson and the American Revolution, Bolívar would go on to lead or help lead revolts against Spanish rule in the colonies of Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. He improved on the political program of the North American Founders on some matters, including abolitionism, but fell short in others. Still, Bolívar fundamentally believed in constitutional government, capitalism, and individualism — and would be repelled by the Marxist movements that misuse his name today.\n\nI’m in The Dispatch today discussing JD Vance, National Conservatism, Freedom Conservatism, and political labels: “The FreeCon statement’s 10 paragraphs addressed most of the same issues, agreeing with the NatCons in some areas while drawing sharp contrasts in others. For example, the NatCon statement offered tepid support for American federalism, describing it as ‘a delegation of power’ to ‘subdivisions of the nation’ and stating that in communities where ‘law and justice have been manifestly corrupted, or in which lawlessness, immorality, and dissolution reign, national government must intervene energetically to restore order.’ In their statement, FreeCons flipped this conception on its head—it is the national government to which limited powers are delegated—and argued that ‘much of the discord in America today comes from the fact that too many decisions are made for us by centralized authorities.’ “NatCons blame ‘globalized markets’ for despoiling America. FreeCons extol the capacity for freer trade to raise our standard of living. NatCons want America’s public life to be ‘rooted in Christianity,’ while FreeCons emphasize pluralism and freedom of conscience. NatCons call for a ‘Cold War-type’ program of federal spending on research and development. FreeCons place a higher priority on fiscal restraint, naming our ‘skyrocketing federal debt’ a ‘threat to the future prosperity, liberty, and happiness of Americans.’” https://lnkd.in/ejU6PSQw\n\nOn this date in 1864, Gen. John Bell Hood attempted to defend the key Confederate city of Atlanta from William T. Sherman’s encircling Federal army. On the evening of July 21, Hood ordered William Hardee’s corps to make 15-mile night march and assault the Union left flank east of the city, held by James B. McPherson's Army of the Tennessee. Joining the attack with Hardee would be the corps of Maj. Gen. Benjamin Cheatham. Hood attacked McPherson's position from two directions, Hardee from the south and Cheatham from the west. After initial Confederate success on the Union left, the heavy fighting of July 22 settled into a struggle for Bald Hill in the center and the Troup Hurt home on the Union right. McPherson was killed during the battle but the Union positions held. Fighting raged up and down the lines until after sunset. As at the previous engagement of Peach Tree Creek, despite initial successes, Hood's attacks failed to dislodge the Federals who strengthened their foothold on the doorstep to Atlanta. The ultimate capture of Atlanta in September was extensively covered by Northern newspapers, significantly boosting Northern morale, and Abraham Lincoln was reelected by a significant margin. By the way, McPherson graduated West Point in 1853 — first in a class that also included future Civil War generals Philip Sheridan, Henry Brevard Davidson (a relative of the William Lee Davidson I wrote about a few days ago), and Hood himself. General Hood later wrote that the death of his “boyhood friend” at Atlanta caused him “sincere sorrow.” And now for the obligatory footnote: I am not descended from John Bell Hood (known as “Sam” to family and friends), but we are related as third cousins, several generations removed.\n\nOn this date in 1780, Loyalist militia in North Carolina were still trying to organize themselves into an effective fighting force to support an expected British invasion into the colony from South Carolina, where the key port of Charleston had fallen to a British siege. An earlier effort to organize North Carolina Loyalists had failed when Patriot forces smashed them at the June 20 battle of Ramseur's Mill in modern-day Lincolnton. In mid-July, Col. William Lee Davidson left Salisbury with about 250 men to confront a large band of Tories at Colson's Mill in modern-day Stanly County. Davidson attacked and dispersed the Tories on July 21, 1780, further hampering Lord Cornwallis's invasion plans, but was severely wounded in the engagement. Davidson lived to fight again, but wasn't so lucky seven months later when he was shot and killed during a critical delaying action at Cowan's Ford, near Charlotte (pictured nearby). Davidson College was named after this American hero. Among my Mecklenburg County relatives who served under Davidson at these battles was Ezra Alexander, my 6th-great granduncle. He survived the war and married a daughter of prominent Mecklenburg planter Ezekiel Polk. Ezra Alexander's nephew, James K. Polk, was elected U.S. president in 1844.\n\nIn USA TODAY this morning, you’ll find my column on the assassination attempt. An excerpt: “That your fellow citizen can disagree with you on political matters, large and small, without necessarily being a liar, a villain, or a fool is a proposition you ought to accept because it is true. Even if you doubt its validity, however, you ought to accept it because our system of self-government requires it. “The structure of that system — elections, enumerated rights and powers, separation of powers, checks and balances, the dual sovereignty embedded in federalism — assumes good-faith, nonviolent disagreement. If it were already obvious whose ideas were correct, none of this rigamarole would be required. “Moreover, true self-government requires self-restraint. At this writing, we know the name of Trump’s would-be assassin but not enough information to know in detail why he did what he did and how he got close enough to wound our former president and to wound and kill others in the crowd. “I’m going to wait for more information before drawing conclusions about this incident. So should our leaders. They should say so, and why. At the same time, our leaders should continue to condemn political violence and advocate political civility. That’s not jumping the gun. That’s trying to make sure no one responds to the events of July 13 by leaping for their own guns.” https://lnkd.in/eTFZxa9N #FreeCon"
