        "text": "☛ Ѵ𝖎𝖓𝖈𝖊𝖓𝖙 Ꝕ𝖗𝖎𝖈𝖊 ☚\n\nLean, effete, and sinister, Vincent Price was among the movies' greatest villains as well as one of the horror genre's most beloved and enduring stars. Born May 27, 1911, in St. Louis, MO, Price graduated from Yale University, and later studied fine arts at the University of London. He made his theatrical debut in the 𝑮𝙖𝒕𝙚 𝙏𝒉𝙚𝒂𝙩𝒓𝙚'𝙨 1935 𝒑𝙧𝒐𝙙𝒖𝙘𝒕𝙞𝒐𝙣 𝙤𝒇 𝑪𝙝𝒊𝙘𝒂𝙜𝒐, followed by work on Broadway, in stock and with 𝑶𝙧𝒔𝙤𝒏 𝑾𝙚𝒍𝙡𝒆𝙨' 𝒇𝙖𝒎𝙚𝒅 𝑴𝙚𝒓𝙘𝒖𝙧𝒚 𝑻𝙝𝒆𝙖𝒕𝙚𝒓. Under contract to Universal, Price traveled to Hollywood, making his screen debut in 1938'𝒔 𝑺𝙚𝒓𝙫𝒊𝙘𝒆 𝒅𝙚 𝙇𝒖𝙭𝒆, before returning to Broadway for a revival of 𝑶𝙪𝒕𝙬𝒂𝙧𝒅 𝑩𝙤𝒖𝙣𝒅. His tenure at Universal was largely unsuccessful, and the studio kept him confined to supporting roles. Upon completing his contract, Price jumped to 20th Century Fox, starring in a pair of 1940 historical tales, 𝑩𝙧𝒊𝙜𝒉𝙖𝒎 𝒀𝙤𝒖𝙣𝒈 -- 𝙁𝒓𝙤𝒏𝙩𝒊𝙚𝒓𝙨𝒎𝙖𝒏 and 𝙃𝒖𝙙𝒔𝙤𝒏 𝑩𝙖𝒚. Still, fame eluded him, and in 1941 he began a long Broadway run (in Angel Street) that kept him out of films for three years.\n\nPrice returned to the West Coast to co-star in 1943'𝙨 𝙏𝒉𝙚 𝙎𝒐𝙣𝒈 𝒐𝙛 𝘽𝒆𝙧𝒏𝙖𝒅𝙚𝒕𝙩𝒆 and became a prominent supporting player in a series of acclaimed films, including 1944'𝙨 𝙒𝒊𝙡𝒔𝙤𝒏 𝒂𝙣𝒅 𝑳𝙖𝒖𝙧𝒂, and 1946'𝒔 𝑳𝙚𝒂𝙫𝒆 𝑯𝙚𝒓 𝒕𝙤 𝙃𝒆𝙖𝒗𝙚𝒏. His first starring role was in the low-budget 𝙎𝒉𝙤𝒄𝙠!, portraying a murderous psychiatrist. He next played a sadistic husband opposite Gene Tierney in 𝘿𝒓𝙖𝒈𝙤𝒏𝙬𝒚𝙘𝒌. Clearly, Price's niche was as a villain -- everything about him suggested malice, with each line reading dripping with condescension and loathing; he relished these roles, and excelled in them. Still, he was not the star Fox wanted; after 1947'𝒔 𝑻𝙝𝒆 𝑾𝙚𝒃, his contract expired and was not renewed. Price spent the next several years freelancing with a variety of studios and by 1952 had grown so disenchanted with Hollywood that he returned to the stage, performing in a San Francisco production of 𝙏𝒉𝙚 𝘾𝒐𝙘𝒌𝙩𝒂𝙞𝒍 𝑷𝙖𝒓𝙩𝒚 before replacing Charles Laughton in the touring company of 𝘿𝒐𝙣 𝙅𝒖𝙖𝒏 𝒊𝙣 𝙃𝒆𝙡𝒍.\n\nPrice then signed on to star in 1953'𝙨 𝙃𝒐𝙪𝒔𝙚 𝙤𝒇 𝑾𝙖𝒙, Warners' 3-D update of their 𝑴𝙮𝒔𝙩𝒆𝙧𝒚 𝒐𝙛 𝙩𝒉𝙚 𝙒𝒂𝙭 𝙈𝒖𝙨𝒆𝙪𝒎. The picture was one of the year's biggest hits, and one of the most successful horror films ever produced. Price's crazed performance as a vengeful sculptor brought him offers for any number of similar projects, and he next appeared in another 3-D feature, 𝑫𝙖𝒏𝙜𝒆𝙧𝒐𝙪𝒔 𝑴𝙞𝒔𝙨𝒊𝙤𝒏. He also made a triumphant return to the stage to appear in 𝑹𝙞𝒄𝙝𝒂𝙧𝒅 𝑰𝙄𝑰, followed by 𝘽𝒍𝙖𝒄𝙠-𝙀𝒚𝙚𝒅 𝑺𝙪𝒔𝙖𝒏. The latter was Price's last theatrical performance for 14 years, however, as he began a very busy and eclectic motion picture schedule. Though he essayed many different types of characters, his forays into horror remained by far his most popular, and in 1958 he co-starred in the hit The Fly as well as 𝙒𝒊𝙡𝒍𝙞𝒂𝙢 𝘾𝒂𝙨𝒕𝙡𝒆'𝒔 𝑯𝙤𝒖𝙨𝒆 𝒐𝙣 𝙃𝒂𝙪𝒏𝙩𝒆𝙙 𝙃𝒊𝙡𝒍.\n\nBy the 1960s, Price was working almost exclusively in the horror genre. For producer Roger Corman, he starred in a series of cult classic adaptations of Edgar Allen Poe stories including 1960'𝙨 𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙁𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙃𝙤𝙪𝙨𝙚 𝙤𝙛 𝙐𝙨𝙝𝙚𝙧, 1963'𝙨 𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙍𝙖𝙫𝙚𝙣, 1964'𝙨 𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙈𝙖𝙨𝙦𝙪𝙚 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙍𝙚𝙙 𝘿𝙚𝙖𝙩𝙝, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 1968'𝙨 𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝘾𝙤𝙣𝙦𝙪𝙚𝙧𝙤𝙧 𝙒𝙤𝙧𝙢. He also appeared in a number of teen movies like 1963'𝙨 𝘽𝙚𝙖𝙘𝙝 𝙋𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙮, 1965'𝙨 𝘿𝙧. 𝙂𝙤𝙡𝙙𝙛𝙤𝙤𝙩 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝘽𝙞𝙠𝙞𝙣𝙞 𝙈𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙚, and the 1969 Elvis Presley vehicle 𝙏𝒉𝙚 𝙏𝒓𝙤𝒖𝙗𝒍𝙚 𝙒𝒊𝙩𝒉 𝑮𝙞𝒓𝙡𝒔. Price began to cut back on his film activities during the 1970s despite hits like 1971'𝒔 𝑻𝙝𝒆 𝑨𝙗𝒐𝙢𝒊𝙣𝒂𝙗𝒍𝙚 𝘿𝒓. 𝙋𝒉𝙞𝒃𝙚𝒔 and its follow-up 𝘿𝒓. 𝙋𝒉𝙞𝒃𝙚𝒔 𝑹𝙞𝒔𝙚𝒔 𝑨𝙜𝒂𝙞𝒏. Instead he frequently lectured on art ( https://archive.org/details/the_vincent_price_collection_of_fine_art )\n\n, and even published several books. For disciple Tim Burton, Price co-starred in the 1990 𝒇𝙖𝒏𝙩𝒂𝙨𝒚 𝑬𝙙𝒘𝙖𝒓𝙙 𝙎𝒄𝙞𝒔𝙨𝒐𝙧𝒉𝙖𝒏𝙙𝒔; apart from voice-over work, it was his last screen appearance. He died in Los Angeles on October 25, 1993."
