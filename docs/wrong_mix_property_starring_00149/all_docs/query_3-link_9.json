        "text": "The camera focuses on Edward’s face; it shows how pale and sad he is. The gothic horror feature used here is the physical appearance of the “monster”. Edward is a large, dark figure with objects (his scissor hands) that can cause harm. This is very stereotypical of the gothic monster as this has been used in Frankenstein (1931) and Nosferatu (1922), and is imprinted in viewers’ minds. But what makes us question how monstrous Edward truly is, is his facial expression and the way he talks. Unlike most gothic horror monsters, he does not have a scary personality. He is shy and is not the antagonist. As the story continues, all the bad deeds he does, are actually the result of someone else taking advantage of him. As viewers, we see this, and we are led to believe that it is not Edward who is the monster, but rather the community Peg has brought him into. By manipulating common features of gothic horror films, Edward Scissorhands is able to influence the audience into believing the “monster” of the film is Edward, but when the tradition is changed, it makes us think that not everything is black and white, and that to get the correct judgement, we must wait until all evidence is presented.\n\nThe film Edward Scissorhands is a contemporary archetype of the gothic genre exploring themes such as unrequited love, social rejection and human creation as defined by Tim Burton. Feature films explore different ideals that can be categorized into different genres that create expectations among audiences about characters, settings, plots and themes. Edward Scisscorhands directed by Tim Burton in the year 1990 is described as both a dark romantic fantasy and a gothic horror film. The film tells a story about Edward Scissorhands, the creation of an elderly inventor who dies before he can give Edward his normal hands in place of his scissor hands. Edward is taken from the mansion he lives in by a suburban family in an attempt to live a\n\nLove, kindness, or affection towards the people that are close to you, believe it or not, may actually be a huge part of their lives. However, just as impacting showing love and/or affection can be, not showing love nor kindness, can be even more impacting in a negative way. Not showing it to the people that show it to you or that are close to you, can make them feel lonely and isolated, which that may also lead into bad things. In the book, In Cold Blood, the author, Truman Capote, emphasizes that Perry Smith had an abusive childhood, and didn’t really have anybody that was there for him; and therefore, had nobody that could stop him from murdering the Herbert Clutter family. Similarly, in the book, Frankenstein, Frankenstein’s creation/monster was bullied, left alone, and looked as a horrific thing by his own father/creator. Also a large amount of things that happened to him throughout the book, written by Mary Shelley, led him to do some pretty terrible things, including killing three people. In both books, In Cold Blood and Frankenstein, the authors express the theme that loneliness can drive you to do things that you didn’t really mean to nor wanted to do.\n\n‘Edward Scissorhands’ is a film directed by Tim Burton. It is a modern-day fairy tale focused on Edward, a person with scissors instead of hands, who is brought to live with a family after spending years in seclusion. Although the film is made for entertainment, it is not the sole purpose of it. There are many messages and themes rooted throughout the film, which are directed towards the audience. These give the film a deeper meaning. Some of the messages include that looks can be deceiving, the significance of individuality, as well as isolation.\n\nIn both stunning stories of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Tim Burton’s Edward Scissorhands, the reader’s heart breaks, as s/he watches how an “other” becomes pitifully isolated by their loved ones or peers because of how they appear. Both protagonists, the creature and Edward Scissorhands, are created rather than naturally born into the world. With this and their abnormal distinctions came an enormous amount of dissension and discomfort from either their creators or their peers. The audience can’t help but sympathize with the “creatures”, because they recognize the “others” are far from malintentioned, but the materialism and fear within society prohibits this to be acknowledged. The two texts exemplify two characters in similar and contrasting\n\nFrankenstein vs Edward Scissorhands In Mary Shelley’s novel, Frankenstein, and Tim Burton’s film, Edward Scissorhands, both the Creature and Edward have many challenges, and some are very similar. There are a couple distinct differences between the two. While in Frankenstein and Edward Scissorhands, the main characters are both wanting to be accepted, and are created out of curiosity, only Edward is loved and accepted, and he isn’t violent like the Creature. The Creature and Edward are created by humans out of curiosity. In Edward Scissorhands, he is constructed out of random things, but his creator didn’t finish him before he passed away from a heart attack.\n\nIn Bowen’s article, he discusses the different gothic motifs that make up gothic literature such as power and restraint, clashing time periods, strange places, terror versus horror, and a world of doubt. “Edward Scissorhands” has always been considered a strange film while We Have Always Lived in a Castle has always been considered a gothic novel. According to Bowen’s list of gothic motifs, “Edward Scissorhands” would be considered more gothic than the novel We Have Always Lived in the Castle because it fits more of the gothic conventions.\n\nIn Victor Frankenstein’s pursuit to discover “the cause of generation and life”, he creates something that becomes the victim of his self-absorption and irrational manner (Segal). Following some insight on the creation of life, scientist Victor Frankenstein decides to take science into his own hands and create a creature out of human cadavers. It is not until the creature comes to life that Victor ponders the perplexing appearance of the creature that is before him. As Victor looks upon the creature he has created, he wonders “Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence” (Shelley 138). With the recognition that the creature truly looks like a monster, Victor abandons the creature and leaves him to the harsh\n\nMary Shelley's Frankenstein is very much a commentary on the Enlightenment and its failure to tame the human condition through reason. The human condition can be defined as the unique features which mold a human being. The creature is undoubtedly a victim of this predicament. He grapples with the meaning of life, the search for gratification, the sense of curiosity, the inevitability of isolation, and the awareness of the inescapability of death. These qualities and his ceaseless stalking of his master conjure up the metaphor that he is the shadow of the Enlightenment. Indeed, the Enlightenment is represented through Frankenstein whereas the creature is the embodiment of everything it shuns. These include nature, emotion, and savagery. The two characters are understood as counterparts and yet strikingly similar at the same time. The creature is considered a monster because of his grotesque appearance. Frankenstein on the other hand is a monster of another kind: his ambition, secrecy, and selfishness alienate him from human society. He is eventually consumed by an obsessive hatred of his creation. Both characters also commit primordial crimes. Although rationality pervades through Frankenstein's endeavours, it can be argued that he becomes less human the more he tries to be God. The secret of life lies beyond an accepted boundary from which none can return. By creating life Frankenstein ironically sets the stage for his own destruction as well as that of his family. The\n\nIn Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, from the moment Victor Frankenstein creates a being that he neglects to even name, it is left to live and grow alone, feared and detested by all of mankind. Victor hates the creation for his existence, and the creation hates Victor for bringing him into the world, in addition to his refusal to take responsibility and help ease the anguish he feels as a result of complete exile from humans. Victor Frankenstein’s creation acts as a doppelganger of Frankenstein himself, and both characters rely on the existence of the other to motivate themselves to continue living; without one another their desire for revenge would be futile.\n\nWhen Mary first wrote Frankenstein, she was debating over the name, she was thinking of either Frankenstein or the Modern Prometheus. The Modern Prometheus was actually a pretty legitimate option for this novel. The there are many similarities between Prometheus and the story of Frankenstein, such as what Prometheus does to the gods and how he steals fire and meat, and how Frankenstein manages to synthesize life and gift it to his creation. Prometheus is the Greek titan, who is the God of forethought and crafty counsel. He was given the task of making man from clay."
