        "text": "Johnny Depp is an actor who appears in A Nightmare on Elm Street and makes a cameo in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare as Glen Lantz. Depp made his film debut in A Nightmare on Elm Street before rising to prominence as a teen idol on the television series 21 Jump Street. He is a successful film star, notably from playing Captain Jack Sparrow in the Disney film series Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nChildhood[]\n\nDepp was born in Owensboro, Kentucky, the son of John Christopher Depp, Sr., a civil engineer, and his wife, the former Betty Sue Wells, a waitress.[4] He has one brother, Daniel, who is a novelist, and two sisters, Christie (now his personal manager) and Debbie. His parents divorced when he was a teenager and his mother married, as her second husband, Robert Palmer (died 2000), whom Depp called \"an inspiration to me\".[5] The Depp family in the United States began with a French Huguenot immigrant, Pierre Deppe or Dieppe, who settled in Virginia around 1700,[6] part of a refugee colony situated above the falls on the James River. The actor has also surmised that he is part Native American, saying in 2011, \"I guess I have some Native American [in me] somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American, she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek.\"[7]\n\nThe family moved frequently during Depp's childhood, and he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different locations, settling in Miramar, Florida, in 1970. In 1978, Depp's parents divorced. He engaged in self-harm as a child, due to the stress of dealing with family problems. He has seven or eight self-inflicted scars. In a 1993 interview, he explained his self-injury by saying, \"My body is a journal in a way. It's like what sailors used to do, where every tattoo meant something, a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself, whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist\".[8]\n\n1980s[]\n\nWith the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, Depp began playing in various garage bands. His first band was in honor of his girlfriend, Meredith. A year after his parents' divorce, Depp dropped out of high school to become a rock musician. As he said on Inside the Actors Studio, he attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. He played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success. The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method, but the group split up before signing a record deal. Depp subsequently collaborated with the band Rock City Angels[9] and co-wrote their song \"Mary\", which appeared on Rock City Angels' debut for Geffen Records titled Young Man's Blues.\n\nOn December 24, 1983, Depp married Lori Anne Allison, a makeup artist and sister of his band's bass player and singer. During Depp's marriage, his wife worked as a makeup artist while he worked a variety of odd jobs, including a telemarketer for pens. His wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage, who advised Depp to pursue an acting career. They divorced in 1985. Depp later dated and was engaged to Sherilyn Fenn (whom he met on the set of the 1985 short film Dummies). Both Sherilyn Fenn and Depp auditioned for the 1986 film Thrashin' and they were both cast, with Depp being chosen by the film's director to star as the lead, which would have been Depp's first major role. Depp was later turned down by the film's producer who rejected the directors decision.[10][11]\n\nCareer[]\n\n[1][2] Johnny Depp at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival===Television=== Depp starred in a lead role on the Fox TV television series, 21 Jump Street, which premiered in 1987. Depp accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest, who inspired him. Depp's long time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi-co-star as the janitor named Blowfish. The series' success turned Depp into a popular teen idol during the late 1980s. He felt \"forced into the role of product.\"[12] Depp decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him.[12]\n\nFilm roles[]\n\nDepp's first major role was in the 1984 classic horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street, playing the boyfriend of the heroine, Nancy Thompson, (played by Heather Langenkamp) and one of 's victims. He originally went with his friend Jackie Earle Haley as company while he auditioned for a part in the film, however, Depp was given a role instead as Glen Lantz while 26 years later Haley would get the part of Freddy Krueger in the remake. Depp was the first choice and was cast to star in the now classic, 1986 American skater drama film Thrashin', chosen and cast by the director but ultimately rejected by the film's producer.[13][14] In 1986, he appeared in a secondary role as a Vietnamese-speaking private in Oliver Stone's Platoon. In 1990 he undertook the quirky title role of the Tim Burton film, Edward Scissorhands. The film's success began his long association with Burton.\n\nDepp, a fan and long-time friend of writer Hunter S. Thompson, played a version of Thompson (named Raoul Duke) in 1998's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, based on the writer's pseudobiographical novel of the same name. Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author's last book tours. In 2006, Depp contributed a foreword to Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson, a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com. Depp paid for most of Thompson's memorial event, complete with fireworks and the shooting of Thompson's ashes by a cannon, in Aspen, Colorado, where Thompson lived.[16]\n\nCritics have described Depp's roles as characters who are \"iconic loners.\"[17] Depp has noted this period of his career was full of \"studio defined failures\" and films that were \"box office poison,\"[18] but he thought the studios never understood the films and did not do a good job of marketing.[17] Depp has chosen roles which he found interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office.[17] [3][4] Depp wearing a mustache and goatee similar to the style used in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black PearlThe 2003 Walt Disney Pictures film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a major success,[17] in which Depp's performance as the suave pirate Captain Jack Sparrow was highly praised. Studio bosses were more ambivalent at first,[19] but the character became popular with the movie-going public.[17] According to a survey taken by Fandango, Depp was a major draw for audiences.[20] The film's director, Gore Verbinski, has said that Depp's character closely resembles the actor's personality, but Depp said he modeled the character after Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards.[21] Depp was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for the role.\n\nIn 2004, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, for playing Scottish author J. M. Barrie in the film Finding Neverland. Depp next starred as Willy Wonka in the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a major success at the box office and earning him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.[21][22]\n\nDepp returned to the role of Jack Sparrow for the sequel Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, which opened on July 7, 2006 and grossed $135.5 million in the first three days of its U.S. release, breaking a box office record of the highest weekend tally.[23] The next sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean, At World's End, was released May 24, 2007. Depp has said that Sparrow is \"definitely a big part of me\", and he wants to play the role in further sequels.[24] Depp voiced Sparrow in the video game, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow.[25] Johnny Depp's swashbuckling sword talents as developed for the character of Jack Sparrow, were highlighted in the documentary film Reclaiming the Blade. Within the film, Swordmaster Bob Anderson shared his experiences working with Depp on the choreography for The Curse of the Black Pearl. Anderson, who also trained Errol Flynn, another famous Hollywood pirate, described in the film Depp's ability as an actor to pick up the sword to be \"about as good as you can get.\"[26]\n\nDepp and Gore Verbinski were executive producers of the album Rogues Gallery, Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs and Chanteys. Depp played the title role of Sweeney Todd in Tim Burton's film adaptation of the musical, for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Depp thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and praised Tim Burton for his \"unwavering trust and support.\"[27]\n\nDepp played the former Heath Ledger character in the 2009 film, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus along with Jude Law and Colin Farrell. All three actors gave their salaries from the film to Ledger's daughter, Matilda.[28] He portrayed the Mad Hatter in Burton's Alice in Wonderland, and the titular character in Rango.\n\nFuture roles[]\n\nDepp will appear in a film version of writer Hunter S. Thompson's book, The Rum Diary, portraying the main character, Paul Kemp. In 2007, Depp accepted Warner Bros.' proposal to make a film of the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows, a series that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971. He had been a fan as a child. Depp and Graham King will produce the movie with David Kennedy, who ran Dan Curtis Productions inc. until Curtis died in 2006. He will play Tonto in a future Lone Ranger film.[29] Depp will also produce Hugo Cabret, based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret, film a documentary about Keith Richards, and have a cameo appearance in Jack & Jill. Depp will make a cameo appearance in a film adaptation of 21 Jump Street, the show he starred in during the late 1980s.[30] Depp will star in and produce an adaptation of the comic book Rex Mundi.[31][32]Depp will collaborate with Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides director Rob Marshall again to create a remake of The Thin Man.[33] Depp also showed interest in starring in the next Sin City films, with Robert Rodriguez wanting him to star as Wallace.[34]\n\nCollaboration with Tim Burton[]\n\nDepp has collaborated with director and close friend Tim Burton in seven films, beginning with Edward Scissorhands (1990), opposite Winona Ryder and Vincent Price. His next role with Burton was in the 1994 film, Ed Wood. Depp later said that \"within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed.\"[35] At the time, the actor was depressed about films and filmmaking. This part gave him a \"chance to stretch out and have some fun\"; he said working with Landau \"rejuvenated my love for acting\".[35]\n\nProducer Scott Rudin once said, \"Basically Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his movies,\" although Burton personally disapproved of the comment. Depp, however agrees with Rudin's statement. According to Depp, Edward Scissorhands represented Burton's inability to communicate as a teenager. Ed Wood reflected Burton's relationship with Vincent Price (very similar with Edward D. Wood, Jr. and Béla Lugosi). [5][6] Depp's Hollywood Walk of Fame star received on November 19, 1999Depp's next venture with Burton was the role of Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow (1999), opposite Christina Ricci. Sleepy Hollow reflected Burton's battle with the Hollywood studio system. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from Angela Lansbury, Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone. Depp stated, \"I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl.\"[38]\n\nDepp did not work with Burton again until 2005 in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, in which he played Willy Wonka. Depp modeled the character's hair on Anna Wintour.[39] The film was a box office success and received positive critical reception.[40][41] Gene Wilder, who played Willy Wonka in the 1971 film, initially criticized this version.[42] Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released in July, followed by Corpse Bride, for which Depp voiced the character Victor Van Dort, in September.\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) followed, bringing Depp his second major award win, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy as well as his third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Burton first gave him an original cast recording of the 1979 stage musical in 2000. Although not a fan of the musical genre, Depp grew to like the tale's treatment. He cited Peter Lorre in Mad Love (1935) as his main influence for the role, and practiced the songs his character would perform while filming Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.[43] Although he had performed in musical groups, Depp was initially unsure that he would be able to sustain Stephen Sondheim's lyrics. Depp recorded demos and worked with Bruce Witkin to shape his vocals without a qualified voice coach. In the DVD Reviews section, Entertainment Weekly's Chris Nashawaty gave the film an A minus, stating, \"Depp's soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he's been hiding... Watching Depp's barber wield his razors... it's hard not to be reminded of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago... and all of the twisted beauty we would've missed out on had [Burton and Depp] never met.\"[44]\n\nIn his introduction to Burton on Burton, a book of interviews with the director, Depp called Burton \"...a brother, a friend,...and [a] brave soul\". The next Depp-Burton collaboration was Alice in Wonderland (2010). Depp played the Mad Hatter alongside Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway and Alan Rickman.\n\nOther interests[]\n\n[7][8] Depp in April 2011===Music=== As a guitar player, Depp has played slide guitar on the Oasis song \"Fade In-Out\" (from Be Here Now, 1997), as well as on \"Fade Away (Warchild Version)\" (b-side of the \"Don't Go Away\" single). He also played acoustic guitar in the movie Chocolat and on the soundtrack to Once Upon a Time in Mexico. He is a friend of The Pogues' Shane MacGowan, and performed on MacGowan's first solo album. He was also a member of P, a group featuring Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones. He has appeared in Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers' music video \"Into the Great Wide Open\".\n\nWinemaker and restaurateur[]\n\nDepp and Paradis grow grapes and have wine making facilities in their vineyard in Plan-de-la-Tour north of Saint-Tropez.[46][47][48] He is known for a fondness of French wines: among Depp's favorites are the Bordeaux wines Château Calon-Ségur, Château Cheval Blanc and Château Pétrus, and the Burgundy wine Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. Interviewed in Madame Figaro, he stated, \"With those wines, you reach nirvana\".[49] Along with Sean Penn, John Malkovich and Mick Hucknall, Depp co-owned the Parisian restaurant-bar Man Ray, located near the Champs-Élysées.[50]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nFamily and relationships[]\n\n[9][10] Depp backstage at the Ahmanson Theatre on December 31, 2006Depp was engaged to actress Winona Ryder for three years beginning in July 1990. They met at the Great Balls of Fire! premiere in June 1989; two months later they began dating.[51] The relationship was highly publicized and received much scrutiny by the media and tabloid press.\n\nSince 1998, following a four year relationship with British supermodel Kate Moss, Depp has had a relationship with Vanessa Paradis, a French actress and singer whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate.[52]\n\nThe couple have two children. Daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp was born May 27, 1999, and son John \"Jack\" Christopher Depp III was born April 9, 2002.[1] In 2007, his daughter recovered from a serious illness, an E. coli infection that began to cause her kidneys to shut down and resulted in an extended hospital stay.[53] To thank Great Ormond Street Hospital, Depp visited the hospital in November 2007 dressed in his Captain Jack Sparrow outfit and spent 4 hours reading stories to the children. In 2008 he donated £1 million (about $2 million) to the hospital.[54]\n\nAlthough Depp has not remarried, he has stated that having children has given him \"real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything.\"[24] \"You can't plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny; kismet. All the math finally worked.\" The family divides its time between their home in Meudon, located in the suburbs of Paris, Los Angeles, an island he bought in The Bahamas, and their villa in Le Plan-de-la-Tour, a small town 20 km from Saint-Tropez, in the south of France.[55][56] Depp also acquired a vineyard estate in the Plan-de-la-Tour area in 2007.[46]\n\nLegal issues[]\n\nIn 1994, Depp was arrested and questioned by police for allegedly causing serious damage to a New York City hotel suite.[57]\n\nHe was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazzi outside a restaurant while dining in London with Paradis.[58]\n\nTattoos[]\n\nDepp has around 13 tattoos, many of them signifying important persons or events in his life. They include a Native American in profile and a ribbon reading \"Wino Forever\" (originally \"Winona Forever\", altered after his breakup with Winona Ryder) on his right biceps, \"Lily-Rose\" (his daughter's name) over his heart, \"Betty Sue\" (his mother's name) on his left biceps, and a sparrow flying over water with the word \"Jack\" (his son's name; the sparrow is flying towards him rather than away from him as it is in Pirates of the Caribbean) on his right forearm.\n\nUnannounced appearance on set[]\n\nOn October 8, 2010, Depp made an unannounced appearance at a London Primary School near where he was filming scenes for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. He turned up dressed as his character Jack Sparrow after receiving a letter from a pupil asking for his help with a class mutiny.[59]\n\nControversy[]\n\n[]\n\nIn 2003, Depp's comments about the United States appeared in Germany's Stern magazine: \"America is dumb, is something like a dumb puppy that has big teeth — that can bite and hurt you, aggressive.\"[60] Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and the quotation was taken out of context, Stern stood by its story, as did CNN.com in its coverage of the interview. CNN added his remark that he would like his children \"to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out.\"[61] The July 17, 2006 edition of Newsweek reprinted the \"dumb puppy\" quotation, verbatim, in the context of a Letter to the Magazine. Depp has also disagreed with subsequent media reports that he says paint him as a \"European wannabe\", saying that he likes the anonymity of living in France and his simpler life there.[60]\n\nAwards and nominations[]\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Johnny Depp Some of the awards that Depp has won include honors from the London Film Critics Circle (1996), Russian Guild of Film Critics (1998), Screen Actors Guild Awards (2004) and a Golden Globe for Best Actor.
