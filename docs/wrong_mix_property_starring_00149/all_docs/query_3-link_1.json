        "text": "Hero In Freak The Mighty By Rick Riordan\n\n1072 Words | 5 Pages\n\n“Being a hero doesn’t mean you're invincible, it just means that you're brave enough to stand up and do what's needed, “says a sagacious man named Rick Riordan . Often times you see heroes on television who have super strength of flying powers, but heroes come in many different forms of people. Irena Sendler for example, was a great hero. Not many people know the name of Irena Sendler, she had done something big that impacted and saved the lives of many jews. Some heroes may be fictional as well.\n\nThe purpose of my essay is to explore how different social backgrounds and the social norms that follow affect the personality of two fictive characters and encourage them to break out of their station to find an identity. The protagonists Holden Caulfield in J.D. Salinger’s novel The Catcher in the Rye and Tambudzai in Tsitsi Dangarembga’s novel Nervous Conditions are both victims of social norms. Therefore, the foundation of this essay was to analyze the character’s social background, which has influenced their personalities, behavior and aspirations, and consequently their opposing actions against society.

When Edward got thrown off of the cruise ship. He only found hope of getting home and getting back to his rich life, while not even thinking about Abilene.

However, as he tries to interact with people, he learns that his ugly appearance prevents him from integrating into society. The elements of the Gothic are present here, as the Creature's isolation is a principal trope of Gothic fiction. According to Ashley Craig Lancaster’s text, “From Frankenstein's Monster to Lester Ballard: The Evolving Gothic Monster,” “…the Monster drifts away from society as a creature driven first by kindness, then by hatred, and finally by desperation, only to continue to live alone” (Lancaster 139).\n\nExamples Of Ostracism In Frankenstein\n\n855 Words | 4 Pages\n\nSociety is well-known for pushing those who are outsiders or strange away from society.

In Edward’s case instead of lacking companionship like Frankenstein’s monster, he lacks hands; and is received rather well by the surrounding community. Ironically, in both tales the characters share the same desire to be love; this ignites the question – why do humans want to be love? Are we only important as we are loved?\n\nTim Burton's Use Of Isolation In Edward Scissorhands\n\n589 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe unknown is often associated with danger because of society.

Burton is implying that those who are different will be left behind, and discriminated against. This leaving you to sympathise and reconsider your judgments on people who do not fit the dominant ideology.
