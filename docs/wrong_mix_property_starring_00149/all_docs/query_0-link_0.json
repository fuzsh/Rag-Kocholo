        "text": "Selected by the Makeup Artists and Hairstylists Branch.\n\nDirector Tim Burton used the clout earned by his blockbuster smash Batman (1989) to make this original fantasy about an unusual young man, orphaned by the death of his creator (played by Vincent Price), who unexpectedly finds love in suburbia only to face the distrust of “normal” people. Ve Neill and Stan Winston were nominated for their imaginative makeup creations, and the consistently impressive work of Burton’s regular collaborators included the costumes of Colleen Atwood, Bo Welch’s striking production design, and the delicately heartrending score by Danny Elfman.\n\nDIRECTED BY: Tim Burton. WRITTEN BY: Caroline Thompson. STORY BY: Tim Burton, Caroline Thompson. WITH: Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall. 1990. 107 min. USA. Color. English. Rated PG-13. 4K DCP.\n\nAcademy Museum film programming generously funded by the Richard Roth Foundation."
