        "text": "Publisher: Warner Books\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 1991\n\nLloyd Denman reflects on the perfection of his life. He owns a very successful, upmarket fish restaurant and is about to marry the young woman of his dreams. However, fate intervenes and his world is abruptly turned upside down. His fiancé Celia Williams, who is supposed to be touring with an orchestra in another city, is locally witnessed calmly dousing herself with petrol before setting herself ablaze. When a bus full of people burns with the passengers sitting calmly in their seats, the police believe it to be some sort of suicide pact. But Lloyd suspects a connection and teams-up with Kathleen who lost her husband on the bus. The only witness is a blind boy from a nearby Indian reservation. Events come to a head when Celia appears to Lloyd, different and frightening. Apparently a salamander – a fire creature halfway between death and human immortality, she tells him they can still be together, but Celia has no reservations about burning people to death in agony to get what she wants. She is a member of a cult led by a strange and dangerous man called Otto, who was one of Hitler’s closest aids. The plan is, through ceremony, to create a master race of immortals who will rule the world forever. Lloyd attempts to intervene, but is he out of his depth?\n\nAnother title in my mammoth reread of early Graham Masterton horror novels, and this one cleverly joins the two premises of a then contemporary re-emergence of a Nazi master race and the 18th century mythology of the salamander – a creature born in fire. After the shocking death of Celia, Lloyd begins to catch glimpses of someone he is certain is his dead fiancé. This is nicely played-out and even links with an epilogue of sorts. You have to wonder at the foolishness of an otherwise intelligent protagonist when, on the run, he phones his restaurant and tells his friend who runs it where he is going to be staying. It confirms how likeable Lloyd is when you find yourself exclaiming Idiot! in your head as you read. But people can make the simplest of mistakes and, let’s face it, the bad guys have to catch up with the reluctant hero for there to be a climatic showdown.\n\nIt’s not all horror; there’s an endearing moment when, held against his will, Lloyd shows sympathy for a master race experiment gone wrong – an individual chained and used as a slave because he’s lacking in intelligence. When he learns the man has no name, Lloyd creates one for him, the sentiment resulting in the man helping Lloyd to escape. Other unusual characters incorporate Otto himself, an ex-aid to Hitler who eats bugs and can start fires with his mind, and his sadistic partner who has passed through the salamander stage and is now immortal. Then there is the blind Indian/Native American boy – a link back to Masterton’s earlier books, not least The Manitou – who, through a totem doll, can produce some useful ancient magic. The hymn in question relates to a previously lost music work by a renowned composer. It is utilised by Otto for the ceremony to create his new master race, though there is a missing end piece he is unaware of and that can change everything. I am loving revisiting these Masterton horror works. I have them all (including some rarities). Some people say the memory cheats; I for one have enjoyed these no less than I did when they were originally published.\n\nVerdict: 9 out of 10\n\n(Original review by Ty Power 2024)\n\nPublisher: Sphere Books\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 1985\n\nHenry is a retired professor who lives in a small property on the seafront. When he discovers the body of a woman on the beach, at the same moment as a surfer dude called Gil and a young woman called Susan, it will be a union of strangers whose lives will be irrevocably changed by this and subsequent events. Cavities in the dead woman’s body are filled with carnivorous eel-like creatures which savagely attack a policeman before disappearing into the sand. From this moment the trio’s movements are shadowed by a curiously androgynous figure known as Springer, who reveals to them that the eels are the seed from an ancient demon that has escaped its bonds and is creating offspring by seducing and impregnating women. If that isn’t unbelievable in itself, they are also informed they are each descended from Night Warriors who fight evil entities by entering the dreams of innocent affiliated individuals. Springer is the agent of Ashapola, a powerful force for light – a sort of god of gods – who cannot directly take action but gives different armour and weapons to Night Warriors. Thus the three become Kasyx, Tebulot and Samena.\n\nIn dreams or nightmares the environments, events and people are dangerously unpredictable. Tracking the eels/seeds is dangerous enough, but their first venture forth ends disastrously with Susan held captive and trapped within the dream. It is necessary to research their foe and find the location where it was held by a religious order. However, far from being wet behind the ears, the demon is aware of their presence and seeks to go on the offensive. Can the trio dispatch or entomb the beast once more? And how instrumental will an aged professor who hits the bottle be in a centuries old battle against almost unstoppable evil?\n\nThis is the first novel in what would become known as the Night Warriors series, spawning the sequels Death Dream, Night Plague, Night Wars and The Ninth Nightmare. It was certainly an original and exciting premise decades before superhero movies became such momentous events. Masterton was apparently told by an American screenwriter that A Nightmare on Elm Street was inspired by Night Warriors; there is no hard evidence to suggest this, but it seems likely. The author himself describes it as Alice Through the Looking Glass for adults. Indeed, it’s a curious balance of the horror of daytime bare-faced reality and the ambiguity and uncertainty of dreams. Of course, in a tale such as this the two seem equally interwoven. Nevertheless, the Night Warrior-travels through dreams – although inventive – are significantly harder to gel with. In other words, you find yourself investing more in the real world and the characters’ natural identities than the armoured dream versions, because the Night Warriors are really only going to react one way according to their Ashapola-given powers. So, it’s telling that Henry makes a huge sacrifice, which is much more of a human act.\n\nCheck out my other reviews of early Graham Masterton horror novels – including The Manitou, Revenge of the Manitou, Charnel House, The Devils of D-Day, The Wells of Hell, The Pariah, The Sphinx, The Heirloom, Mirror, Ritual, The Hymn, Djinn and Edgewise. Masterton remains my favourite horror writer of all time, by far – and he’s still writing impressive stuff, which is quite an achievement in these times of an extremely saturated market. Try some of them out. You won’t be sorry.\n\nVerdict: 7 out of 10\n\n(Original review by Ty Power 2024)\n\nPublisher: Sphere Books\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 1989\n\nJack Reed owns a car repair company. When a small figure flits across the road in front of his car, he stops and searches the surrounding area, thinking it might have been a child. Here, he discovers a grand, secluded, but run-down building called The Oaks. He is quickly drawn to it and has plans to renovate it as a country club. When revisiting with his son, Randy, the boy disappears. A distressed Jack searches the the grounds from top to bottom. Subsequently, he learns that The Oaks was an asylum for the criminally insane. Sixty years ago, everyone connected with the place simply walked out after it was discovered that the psychotic inmates simply vanished from their individual locked cells.\n\nThe most dangerous psychotic killer was Quintus Miller, and with the help of a professor who has an unhealthy interest in ancient Earth magic, Jack is amazed to find out that The Oaks was built on a junction of ley lines and that Miller and the other patients used that Earth magic to move into the walls and attempt to escape along the ley lines. Now Randy has been pulled into the walls and is being held to ensure Jack's help in helping them escape the grounds. Miller intends to kill hundreds of people by pulling them into the ground, in order to appease the mythical Awen and escape the walls. Jack is desperate to save his son but realises the only hope he has is by attempting to enter the walls himself.\n\nThe Walkers has certain similarities to Ritual and Mirror; not the setting or storyline but in terms of certain plot strands. In both this book and Ritual, the protagonist’s boy is taken; it’s a way to ensure the father is drawn back to the action/horror. After all, if the main character is able to walk away from the danger early on, we wouldn’t have a story. Similarly, Jack is obliged to find the secret to entering the walls to reclaim his son in the same way that Martin Williams has to enter the demonic Mirror to recover his landlord’s grandson in that book. There has to be an invested interest in the key character putting him/herself in dire peril.\n\nAs is common with horror stories, there are questions left unanswered, such as how Jack gets out of the walls with his son when the criminally insane people are unable to. There is also a question of why the women are often attracted to the mainstay although, again, this is used as a companion to converse with and jointly experience the tribulations. Nevertheless, this is another enjoyable tale from Masterton which begins with a haunted house scenario and evolves into a pagan/contemporary fantasy without ever losing touch with the essential horror element. I love his horror books – particularly the early ones – and have read all of them since The Manitou, his first. You can’t help but get pulled into the narrative and dragged along for the ride. This one is not as strong as some of the others but it’s compelling all, the same. The Pied Piper excerpt to draw the crazies back into the grounds of The Oaks again is inspired. The artwork for these releases is also excellent.\n\nVerdict: 8 out of 10\n\n(Original review by Ty Power 2024)\n\nPublisher: Sphere Books\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 1988\n\nCharlie McLean is a travelling restaurant critic. On this particular stage of his journey he is accompanied by his son Martin, fundamentally to catch-up on lost time and prove to himself and his ex-wife that he can be a good father. However, they struggle to find a connection. Whilst dining in a below-par eatery called The Iron kettle, during a rather ominous full-on thunderstorm, Martin believes he sees a little hunched figure standing out in the rain. Charlie passes it off as a trick of the light but when he is finishing-up, Martin goes out to the car and Charlie sees his son apparently conversing with the dwarfish figure – which he later denies. Armed with a warning not to visit the nearby exclusive French restaurant Le Reposior (The Resting Place), Charlie becomes obsessed with doing so – even to the point of entering the grounds and making a nuisance of himself. After a sexual liaison with a woman in the local town of Allen’s Corners, he arrives back at his lodgings to discover that Martin and all of his belongings are missing. Furthermore, no-one admits to having seen him in the first place. It’s as it Martin never existed.\n\nPinning-down the local sheriff, Charlie discovers that Martin isn’t the first person to vanish from the area. Indeed, it has happened many times. Each has ‘willingly’ joined the Celestials, a cult based at Le Reposior and other locations, who allow sections of their body to be severed, cooked and eaten by other members in order to be closer to God. As willingly allowing your body to be eaten little-by-little is not illegal, there is little the authorities can do, especially as many of the locals are actively involved. He learns that this activity is considered a form of purity which is leading to a culmination of the thousand times thousandth person to be consumed – which will be Martin. Thereafter, it is believed God will be present and reward the only survivor. Charlie attempts to break Martin out but is himself held captive against his son’s safety. He realises Martin will not be harmed until the designated day, so escaping to consider his plan of action seems the only logical decision. However, the hunched figure is hot on his trail, and Charlie reluctantly accepts that the only possibility of affecting the proposed outcome is to return to the cannibalistic restaurant.\n\nThis novel has a little of everything. We have a shadowy hunched figure with psychotic tendencies, an oppressive and dangerous cult of religious cannibals, a small local town with a cover-up conspiracy of silence, an ex-wife who demands to know where her son is, and there is even a graphic sexual scene which is more than a little creepy.\n\nMasterton dips more than one toe into a subject distasteful to us all. The scenes of civilised cannibalism (if there is such a thing!) cause the reader to cringe whilst essentially detaching from events. After all, a writer doesn’t need to elaborate on such a subject for it to have an effect. This is a very enjoyable book. You’re hooked from the opening pages and it pulls you along like being dragged through the woods behind a horse. You feel as if you’ve been through the grinder (no pun intended), and that is because Charlie remains a victim of circumstance; whatever he does or doesn’t do seems to have little or no effect. That feeling of events being well beyond his control doesn’t stop the protagonist trying – his son’s life is at stake, after all – and this invests the reader.\n\nThere is something happening all the time in this tale, and every scene is conducive to the plot. One of the strongest sequences - which could so easily have been dull in the wrong hands - is the escape chase, a fight and flight moment wherein the writer plays with the reader's emotions. A rollercoaster ride with a final twist.\n\nVerdict: 10 out of 10\n\n(Original review by Ty Power 2024)\n\nPublisher: Star (W.H. Allen & Co. Ltd)\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 1983\n\nJohn Trenton and his wife Jane buy an antiques shop in a little coastal town called Granitehead, near Salem. When Jane and their unborn child are killed in a car accident, it's enough that John is stricken with grief and has been alienated by his mother-in-law, but he begins to suffer evil and harrowing manifestations of his dead wife. She urges him to kill himself so that they can be together again. However, he isn't the only person experiencing these apparent visitations from deceased relatives - and a few have actually been killed in an impossibly gruesome manner.\n\nMeanwhile, John bids for and wins an unusual painting depicting a sinister distant galleon off the local coast. The losing bidder wants the painting badly and begs John to sell. It turns out that this is the only representation of the John Dark which was lost at sea at the time of the Salem Witch Trials. It was notorious for a mysterious cargo, and had all references removed from the records. The man is financing a boat with sounding equipment and divers to locate the galleon, which is thought to have been lost in a storm shortly after setting sail from the coastline. He hopes to salvage the thought-to-be precious cargo.\n\nWhen John comes into contact with a reclusive professor and his rather strange valet he learns more than he bargained for. It materialises that the giant skeleton of an Aztec demon called Mictantecutli was stolen from Mexico and sealed into a large copper container which would contain its powers. The plan had been to use the demons abilities, but it was thought to have influenced the Salem Witch Trial and, when it was found to be too destructive, the captain took to sea in a savage storm and the galleon was sunk. Over the course of three hundred years, the container has begun corroding and Mictantecutli's influence is beginning to escape - and that had begun with deadly spectres to influence prospective salvage people to release the cargo.\n\nBut has John struck a disastrous deal with this ancient and unscrupulous devil?\n\nThis is a return to my marathon reread of early books by my favourite horror fiction writer Graham Masterton - following titles such as The Manitou, Revenge of the Manitou, The wells of Hell, Charnel House, The Devils of D-Day, Sphinx, and others. They say that the memory cheats; that what you enjoyed in your younger days seldom stand the test of time. Not so here. I've never held any trust in that belief, anyway. I have thoroughly enjoyed revisiting these tales, and The Pariah is another gem.\n\nUnlike most ghost stories, this is not a slow burner. Masterton keeps the reader hooked by always having something significant take place. There are the increasingly violent visitations, the blinding of his mother-in-law, the impossibly gruesome death of an elderly neighbour by what appears to be her dead husband, the near-death edginess of the first dive down to the sunken vessel, the unearthly violent attack during a sexual liaison, and the final clash with the demon Mictantecutli.\n\nThere is an increasing sense of hopelessness inherent in this tale. In the early chapters John is an unwitting victim of the terrifying events and, even when he begins to build up a picture of what what he is up against, there remains the feeling that nothing can be done to keep the demon captive - and it will escape and cause untold death and disaster whatever the characters do or don't do. Of course, the demon's promise of properly returning John's beloved wife to him causes the anxiety of whether he will ultimately do the right thing.\n\nThe ending is somewhat ambiguous, and the fact John doesn't get the girl bases the story closer to reality - at least as far as characterisation goes.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nVerdict: 10 out of 10\n\n(Original review by Ty Power 2024)\n\nPublisher: Sphere Books\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 1988\n\nMartin Williams is a screenwriter mainly of episodes from long-running TV serials, but his obsession is Boofuls, a Hollywood musical star of the 1930s. Martin has written a script for a musical documentary of the boy's short life. However, no one connected with the film industry is prepared to go anywhere near that idea, because all the public remember with distaste is Boofuls' tragically horrific end when his guardian grandmother inexplicably chopped him into pieces.\n\nWhen Martin learns of some furniture for sale which had been in the house where Boofuls lived, he purchases a very unusual mirror with money he doesn't really have. But from the moment he hangs it on the wall of his apartment his life turns into a living nightmare. Firstly, the reflection of his sitting room shows differences to the real world. It begins as innocently as a ball appearing as a different ball in the mirror but, when a cat disappears, an extremely feral one emerges to attack him.\n\nEvents escalate out of control when Martin's landlord neighbour's grandson goes missing after getting into his apartment and speaking to an 'imaginary' friend. A boy emerges from the mirror who not only looks like Boofuls, but fifty years later, unbelievably, is Boofuls. The boy demands that he needs to remake the film he never completed the first time around. But why is he so insistent... and so sinister?\n\nMartin uncovers a secret coven from the 1930s which involved Boofuls and several other stars from the time - all of which were prepared to make a pact with the Devil in return for sustained fame and fortune. Furthermore, the pact is about to be fulfilled and unleash the the power of evil upon the world. But Martin must also enter the demon world inside the mirror, in an attempt to rescue his landlord's grandson, Emilio.\n\nThis was another bestselling book from Graham Masterton - in my opinion, the best horror fiction writer since the classics of old (H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe, M.R. James, Arthur Machen, etc.). In this one you have to wonder why the protagonist doesn't smash the mirror after the incident with the cat. Or, at least, throw it out or sell it on. But if these sort of characters didn't remain in a haunted house or enter a forbidden locked room, for example, we wouldn't have a story. Masterton navigates his way around this problem by having Martin Williams remembering the money he paid for the mirror, and then selfishly thinking he can finally get his screenplay off the ground, initially not completely sensing the wrongness of the situation. By the time that Emilio is swallowed by the mirror it is too late to take that action without losing him forever.\n\nAgain, there are plenty of set-pieces in this book to keep the horror and suspense crowd happy. I particularly liked the diversions from the mirror itself, such as the pieces of the Devil secreted in the lockers of a derelict hotel, a connection with two priests who attempt to aid Martin and, particularly, the effect watching the new Boofuls film has on the viewers en masse.\n\nThis is a simple concept very well executed with multiple horrific scenes which enhance this tale of terror without over-complicating it. You could say the devil is in the detail! It incorporates a flowing but compelling writing style - as with the majority of his horror fiction. It doesn't leave you wanting more, because stories are essentially about triumph over adversity, and there's plenty of adversity to go around in his fictional world. Let's say instead that I've always looked forward with vigour to his next book - particularly in these early years.\n\nIn some victories there are consequences, and Masterton remembers this by having his key character changed someone by his experience. What else can I say, aside from read it!\n\nVerdict: 9 out of 10\n\n(Original review by Ty Power 2024)\n\nPublisher: The Folio Society\n\nFormat: Hardback\n\nPublished: 2023\n\nThe London Folio Society publishes a special edition hardback version of Dune: Messiah, by Frank Herbert. The science fiction book saga Dune ran to six books (initially!); Dune: Messiah was the second, and so this follows The Folio Society’s special release of the opener. It is a stunning book to behold; lovingly constructed. It’s bound in printed and blocked metallic cloth and set in Dante with Helvetica Neue and Black Tulip display. There is a gorgeous Frontispiece, 7 beautiful colour illustrations (one of them a double-page spread) by talented Dune fan Hilary Clarcq, and 10 black and white chapter headings. There is also an Endpaper map by Martin Sanders. The book cover design is something special which sets the tone for the quality of this release and its classic content. The Printed Slipcase is thick, heavy and shaped in the same manner as its predecessor. Further, this edition contains Herbert’s little used ‘Death Cell Interview’ prologue – which works as a catch-up of the events in the first book, Dune. If you are a fan of Frank Herbert or science fiction in general, you are going to need this in your collection.\n\nIf you are a follower of sci-fi then you will surely be aware of Dune – if not through the books, then surely awareness of the 1984 and more recent films and the TV series. You’ll at least know about giant worms and spice! So, I won’t recap on the first book, except to say that Paul Atreides is born the Muad'Dib and has the power of prescience. He is tutored by his mother and by the end of the book becomes Emperor of the Known Universe. By the beginning of Dune: Messiah, Paul has ruled for 12 years. However, a devastating galaxy-wide war is triggered by his ascension, as the religious order and the politicians clash and he is powerless to stop it. Even some of his friends scheme to have him removed from his position. But Paul’s possible visions of the future could mean that the death of billions and the destruction of multiple planets may be the only path to enlightenment and man’s assured place in the universe.\n\nI read the first three books in this series when I was in my twenties, alongside other ground-breaking SF authors such as Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, Alan Dead Foster, Orson Scott Card, Isaac Asimov and many others. I lapped them all up. It’s always difficult returning to loved titles, because there is always a chance you will become disillusioned; your treasured memories of a classic becoming tarnished. However, the favourites I have reread have only reaffirmed my original assessments. They are not loved by legions of fans for no reason. I found this one compelling from the outset. Whereas Dune is more of a grand adventure, Messiah seems more character-driven, with no out-and-out hero or villain. We all have shades of grey, after all (no, not those ones!). It is at times downbeat: the pressures of office don’t even come close, but the whole is captivating and, arguably, better than its predecessor – although Dune sets-up the boundaries without which Messiah would not have worked half as well.\n\nVerdict: 10 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2023)\n\nPublisher: Magpie Books\n\nFormat: Hardback\n\nPublished: 2023\n\nHarperCollins Publishers releases If I Have to be Haunted, the debut novel by Miranda Sun. Chinese American Cara Tang is just trying to get through high school, but that is the least of her problems. She is a Ghost Speaker, which means she can not only see the ghosts of dead people and prospectively help them find their way but, within a month of Halloween when the veil between the living and the dead is at its thinnest, actually interact with them on more of a corporeal level. Her mother wants her to suppress these abilities and lead a normal life; for the selfish reason of not getting on with her own Ghost Speaker mother – whose spectre, incidentally, resides in the attic and converses with her granddaughter. When Cara comes across the body of Zach Coleson – the blond, blue-eyed, privileged and deeply annoying swimming star of the school – she makes the ultimate mistake of reacting to his ghost. Much as she hates his very existence, Cara feels she can’t refuse him help. When it is discovered Zach was bitten by a white snake of fable, which can take human form, they learn that there is a slim chance Zach can return to life. Thereafter, nothing will remain the same as they are obliged to enter the highly dangerous liminal world. Cara needs to find her own way in life and fate has a way of presenting a path, but it is the right one?\n\nAs you might expect from the opening of my synopsis, there is very much a Buffy the Vampire Slayer vibe in attendance in this book – particularly the empowered young woman preparing for college. There are a number of other influences too, including horror, fairy stories, dark fantasy, and more contemporary children’s fantasy tales. A loose affiliation with the Harry Potter franchise can’t be denied, and there is certainly a connection to the popular wizard-type fantasy books of the 1980s and 1990s. This definitely spans many borrowed situations which Miranda Sun makes her own. Two consecutive dangers to life include a cannibal who wants to eat Cara and a part of the landscape that becomes a monster. Some of the situations seem based in young children’s fiction, whilst others are more adult without being too bloodthirsty. In all, I believe the book fits comfortably into what is normally termed Teen Fiction. The liminal world seems to work like a trial, in the same manner that much of Del Toro’s Pan’s Labyrinth was an allegory for a girl’s coming of age.\n\nWhichever references you many read into the tale, you can’t deny it’s an impressive debut from Miranda Sun.\n\nVerdict: 8 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2023)\n\nPublisher: Harper Voyager\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 2023\n\nHarper Voyager publishes the paperback version of The Firemane Saga Volume Three: Master of Furies. Raymond E. Feist is an international bestselling writer of dark fantasy fiction – perhaps best known for his Riftwar and Serpentwar books. He has captivated and enthralled readers for forty years, with his compelling storylines and well-rounded characters. His first book, Magician, was voted in the top 100 novels of all time and is an epic that fans return to again and again. Master of Furies follows King of Ashes, and Queen of Storms, in the Firemane trilogy...\n\nWhen one of the established five kingdoms is invaded, the King of the legendary Firemanes is slaughtered, thereby ending the line. However, unknown to the aggressors, his baby son is spirited away to another land to a strict organisation that trains youngsters to be assassins, agents and spies. Suspecting nothing of his past, Hatushaly forms a bond with the female Hava and another boy. Their destinies are to be inextricably linked. Declan Smith is a blacksmith’s apprentice who quickly gains the status of Master Smith when he becomes one of a rare few who can forge an unbreakable sword using the secret sand of a hidden location. He builds his own forge at Beran’s Hill and takes a wife, only for the inhabitants to be massacred by invaders. With his wife dead, Declan vows to track down and destroy the raiders – a sentiment shared by Baron Daylon Dumarch, whose family is slain whilst fleeing the area. Whilst certain parties suspect the existence of a living Firemane offspring and strive to identify him as a target, the objectives of Hatushaly, Hava and Declan converge on a hidden island where riches through piracy and resources through intelligence networks are collected for the fightback to save their lands. Furthermore, certain individuals are in place to reveal to Hatushaly his true identity and to train him to use his inherent powers of the furies – which involves travelling along and manipulating the filaments of energies which power all existence. That is when a curious half-serious, half-idiosyncratic robed figure arrives seemingly out of thin air to bring forward Hatushaly’s training and to warn those on the island that the true threat they face is by far the greatest the world of Garn has ever faced.\n\nThe above synopsis from memory covers all three books and so should bring prospective (or forgetful) readers of the Firemane Saga up-to-speed. I have avidly followed Raymond E. Feist’s literary career from Magician (one of my favourite books) up until Magician’s End – more than 30 books later (I have a signed hardback copy of both of these extraordinary reads). All of these stories have been set on or around the world of Midkemia (including the Kelewan Empire books). Who can forget such lovable characters as Pug, Jimmy the Hand, Martin Longbow, and Amos Trask? That is why when it was announced these entertaining reads had come to an end and there would be a completely new trilogy, I was one among many fans who were far from happy. It undoubtedly helps that I read the hardback copy of this upon its release. Perhaps it is because of this previous love of Pug and co. that I found King of Ashes – the first of the Firemane Saga – so hard to get into. It seemed somewhat slow compared with the veritable plethora of previous tales which had seemed to read themselves. However, sometimes you have to invest yourself in a book for it to slowly plant its seed and flower. This third volume is definitely the strongest of this trilogy and, if anything, Hava – who becomes an expert at stealing enemy ships – and Declan (a swordsman as well as a smith) are stronger characters than the main protagonist, Hatushaly. Regular followers of Feist’s excellent books will be overjoyed at the brief return of a loved character from earlier books, thought to be lost. Here’s hoping the Midkemia stories continue with Pug’s son, Magnus.\n\nVerdict: 8 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2023)\n\nPublisher: Titan Books\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 2023\n\nTitan Books publishes the paperback short story collection, Multiverses: An Anthology of Alternate Realities, edited by the Shirley Jackson Award-nominated Preston Grassmann. This is said to be the first anthology dedicated to multiverses and other realities – ideal for fans of science fiction, fantasy or the just plain weird! There are contributions by bestselling authors such as Clive Barker, Ken Liu, Ian McDonald, Alix E. Harrow, Charlie Jane Anders, Alastair Reynolds, Annalee Newitz, and others. The book is divided into the sections Parallel Worlds, Alternate Histories, and Fractured Realities, and incorporates 304 pages in total. The paper grade is lower and thinner than some previous releases from Titan, but for a paperback collection of author styles to investigate it’s more than adequate...\n\nI should just mention, before we get onto the stories themselves, that there are two contributions from Clive Barker, but neither are fictional tales. They are poems: one is practically over before it starts, and the other isn’t much longer. Neither are particularly impressive. I’ve enjoyed several Barker novels over the years, but it is somewhat misleading to use his name here as a pull.\n\nI have always found it curious how it inevitably takes a while to settle comfortably into a different style from that what you’re used to reading. Superhero films and comics have made this sub-genre more commonplace these days – perhaps for first time since the crazy days of Philip K. Dick. As you might expect, there are some diverse concepts collected here; some more blatant science fiction jaunts, while others hint at much more subtle but potentially disastrous changes from the norm. Whilst there is a handful of intriguing gems, there are equally the inevitable few that paint an inventive fable only to flounder with the denouement – as if the time has abruptly run-out in a school essay-writing lesson and they have no idea how to end. Additionally, it’s curious how invariably the idea of Hitler and/or the Nazis rear their heads in multiple universe stories (I think Ray Bradbury started that with A Sound of Thunder).\n\nThe stand-out example in this genre for me is 'Nine Hundred Grandmothers', by Paul Di Filippo wherein the protagonist wastes his life taking and dealing dimensional drugs, only to be plagued by other versions of himself and alternate members of his rich, well-to-do family attempting to prompt him to change his ways. The ending is also somewhat ambiguous. Other notable examples include 'Banish', about the dilemma of operating to save the life of a war crimes killer who is still alive in another reality, but has not yet become that criminal; 'Crunchables', which explores the hazardous mundanities of doing a shop-run when other realities spontaneously impose themselves on established areas; and 'A Witch’s Guide to Escape', about a foster child who loses himself in the reality of fictional settings.\n\nWhilst not exactly grabbing me as must-have compilation, Multiverses does have its moments of spontaneity and originality. Take a punt on it; this is how you sometimes build a long-time affiliation with an author or writing style.\n\nVerdict: 6 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2023)\n\nPublisher: Titan Books\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 2022\n\nTitan Books publishes What Moves the Dead, by T.

Her debut adult horror novel, The Twisted Ones, won the 2020 Dragon Award for Best Horror Novel. As with that novel and its follow-up, The Hollow Places, What Moves the Dead is also a retelling of a classic tale – in this case, the great Edgar Allan Poe’s The Fall of the House of Usher...\n\nAlex Easton is a retired Lieutenant in the military, who receives word from his childhood friend, Madeline Usher, that she is dying. Along with his trusty horse Hob and his trusted old-soldier aide, Angus, he makes his way to the dilapidated ancestral home of the Ushers in the remote countryside of Ruritania. He finds his old campaigning soldier colleague Roderick Usher a nervous wreck and generally in tatters at the effect of a supposed curse on the family name and the terrifying changes that have taken hold of the already frail Madeline. She speaks in strange voices at night, and appears to converse with the dark tarn nearby. Fungal growths possess the local wildlife, and it seems whatever is controlling them has a hold of Madeline herself. But is Roderick’s sister alive or dead – it seems to be a fine line. Alex attempts to get to the truth and bring a halt to the malady with the help of a female British mycologist and an out-of-his league American doctor.\n\nHaving devoured both Poe’s story and Roger Corman’s film, I can’t help but picture Roderick Usher as Vincent Price in his tortured portrayal (Price was excellent in virtually everything he did in front of the camera). This book is an intriguing slant which carried me along for the ride and kicked around uselessly, in equal measure. I enjoyed the perspective of the ex-soldier, Easton, although too many reminiscences of the old days felt like wading through treacle at times. Nevertheless, on the whole, the plot – although centred in a small area – motors along. In fact, the house and tarn add to the claustrophobic atmosphere. The strongest aspect of this book is the representations of the characters. They are almost caricatures: the posh English mycologist, the presumably Scottish aged veteran, the practical but pensive American doctor… Even the horse, Hob, has referred idiosyncrasies. There are also amusing observations on the English and Americans, in particular.\n\nThe book is tightly paced, cranking-up the tension in increments, like the rack in another classic Poe tale, but refuses to outstay its welcome. Well worth checking out.\n\nVerdict: 8 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2022)\n\nPublisher: Titan Books\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 2022\n\nTitan Books publishes Isolation: The Horror Anthology, 20 chilling stories from modern masters of horror, including: Joe R. Lansdale, Mark Morris, Ramsey Campbell, Lisa Tuttle, M.R. Carey, Ken Liu, Tim Lebbon, Alison Littlewood, Owl Goingback and others. The theme is inspired by the lockdowns during the Covid-19 period and explores loneliness, loss, separation, remoteness, confinement and insecurity. The collection is edited by Dan Coxon, an award-winning editor and writer based in London. His anthology This Dreaming Isle was shortlisted for both a Shirley Jackson Award and a British Fantasy Award. His debut collection Only the Broken Remain was nominated for two British Fantasy Awards. His fiction has appeared in Black Static, Nightscript, The Lonely Crown, Not One of Us,and the Terrifying Ghosts anthology. He is an editor at award-winning publisher Unsung Stories...\n\nThis is a timely collection of stories featuring subjects we can all relate to. It would have been nice to have a series of horror stories based purely on family segregation as a result of the global pandemic. This would have proved more claustrophobic and explored how differently individuals are affected by essentially the same experience. However, this book looks at wider aspects of insecurity. It is natural, as a reader, to navigate towards the tried and tested authors and other names you may recognise. Thus, I headed straight to 'The Long Dead Day', the contribution from one of my favourite writers, Joe R. Lansdale. His Hap and Leonard books are amazingly good fun, and others out there include Bubba Ho-Tep, Cold in July, and The Bottoms. I must admit I’m disappointed with this one: a pretty standard family turning into zombies piece.\n\nNext was Mark Morris. 'Friends For Life' has elements of a Wicker Man story. It flows well, is enjoyable to read, but is a little predictable and would have benefitted from a late twist. Ramsey Campbell’s 'The Blind House' follows a man who has cut himself off from the outside world and edits other people’s novels. Lisa Tuttle’s 'Fire Above, Fire Below' has a girl picking-up on what people say and making predictions on events which always come true. Inevitably, she ends-up being spirited away by the military to help in their catastrophic war. Some elements of this remind me of my own short story called 'The Needs of the One', which you can read on my website adarkandscaryplace.com – I also have 'The Hospital Garden' on there, which ideally fits the themes of loneliness and isolation.\n\nWhat I’m getting at here – amidst all the plugging of my own material – is that if you’ve come to expect higher quality from the writers you know and love, it’s reasonable to be more critical. It’s my own personal moan and I’m certain most people will not notice the difference and wonder what I’m wittering on about. But it does mean the other contributors proved to be more of a revelation for me. The bottom line is that, although not perfect, this is a solid and diverse collection.\n\nVerdict: 7 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2022)\n\nPublisher: Hodder & Stoughton\n\nFormat: Hardback\n\nPublished: 2022\n\nHodder & Stoughton releases the hardback of House of Silence, the second novel by Patricia Marques, and second in the Inspector Reis Series following The Colours of Death. A certain percentage of the population is marked as ‘Gifted’ with telepathic, telekinetic or empathic abilities, and Inspector Isabel Reis is one such person. She and her partner Aleksandr Voronov investigate a woman’s body discovered in a river outside of Lisbon. It is Marta Nunes, a youth centre worker – and also one of the ‘Gifted’. This minority of people is often viewed with suspicion, and it is found the victim is connected to a number of missing women, all of whom were telepathic. Time is of the essence to trace where the young women went as it is just possible some may still be alive. But had Marta been helping the girls or mistreating them? The author is half-Angolan and half-Portuguese. She was born in Portugal and moved to England when she was eight. She lives in London, and holds an MA and a BA in Creative Writing...\n\nWhilst I admit to not having read the acclaimed first book in the series, I found this one to be a competent storyline suffering from two intrinsic problems. Literally-speaking there is nothing wrong with using the present tense in the narrative, but with the past tense so instilled in story-writing through the ages I found this new angle difficult to get past. It is virtually compulsory for scriptwriting, and so it isn’t the dialogue which grates but rather the descriptive actions, which come across like stage directions far from being comfortably natural in a book of fiction. I thought I would get used to it but I didn’t, so it made for a somewhat removed experience. In other words, I found it impossible to immerse myself in the story. This is just my own opinion; Patricia is the one with an MA and BA in writing, so what do I know!\n\nThe other problem is the pairing of the main characters. In police dramas there is so often a necessary pairing that it is essential the players are completely different to each other in terms of traits, mannerisms and opinions, so that there is a created friction – to make them recognisable caricatures rather than ciphers, which is so often the case. Although Reis and Voronov appear to be of diverse backgrounds they still come across as very similar; she suffers at the hands of other people’s emotions, and he keeps an eye on her welfare, being the only real differences detectable for most of the book. I’m reminded of the pairing of Graham Masterton’s DS Jamila Patel and DC Jerry Pardoe (from Ghost Virus and The Children God Forgot), which works much better both in plain sight and subtly. He is a down-to-earth, plain-speaking Londoner, who uses humour to fend-off all ills, and she is a quieter, more formal Pakistani woman who is modern-thinking whilst having been raised with traditional spiritual beliefs.\n\nWhat can I say? Although, it didn’t flow for me, and failed to drag me along for the ride, I wouldn’t turn anyone away from giving it a try. Or maybe it would be a better idea to begin with the previous novel, The Colours of Death.\n\nVerdict: 5 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2022)\n\nPublisher: Titan Books\n\nFormat: Hardback\n\nPublished: November 2021\n\nA Transylvanian nobleman called Count Dracula arrives at 221B Baker Street seeking the help of Sherlock Holmes in finding his kidnapped wife Mina. Holmes is obliged to reassess his opinions about the outré; what until recently he discounted as fiction. But is Dracula a monster or misunderstood after the misconceptions of Bram Stoker’s novel. It isn’t long before it is discovered a much more dangerous vampire exists – one with intelligence and reasoning, who has discovered a way to manipulate the stages of transformation into a creature of the night. One who is creating his own army of associates. Watson suffers a life-changing situation and struggles to keep his dignity, particularly when faced with his lost wife – now an unscrupulous and bloodthirsty vampire. But just who is the Mariner Priest...?\n\nIt’s always a welcome surprise to receive an attractive hardback book for review, and particularly one which is set in my favourite writing period of the late 19th Century and the early 20th Century. Titan must be commended for their presentations. Much of the classic gothic horror originates from this era, in the form of H.P. Lovecraft’s peerless weird fiction, Edgar Allan Poe’s tales of terror, and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (to give it the short title). Of course, two other examples are Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes and Bram Stoker’s Dracula – which are represented in this novel. Like James Lovegrove, for example, Christian Klaver is no stranger to setting his original tales in this period. This is the first instalment in his The Classified Dossier series, wherein Holmes and Dr Watson come across characters from Gothic literature, such as the aforementioned Dracula, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and Dorian Gray. The idea here is that Sherlock Holmes is dead, and Watson is given permission to release some written-up adventures which had been kept under wraps because of their bizarre, grotesque and horrific nature.\n\nThe prose is presented in four parts: 'Count Dracula; The Innsmouth Waler'; 'The Adventure of the Lustrous Pearl'; and 'Old Enemies' – which are all linked, although they initially appear not to be. The title of the third part might suggest a crossover into Thomas Preskett Prest’s A String of Pearls – featuring Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street – but this proves to be a red herring. 'The Innsmouth Waler', however, plunges unremorselessly into the depths of H.P. Lovecraft’s Damon cult, based on his stories Shadow Over Innsmouth and Dagon. As a big Lovecraft fan this is probably the most enjoyable section for me. A fake waler makes a sea crossing in record time due to a large something – or several large somethings – pulling the boat from beneath the ocean. The crew are running with putrid water and smelling of foul fish, as in HPL’s Innsmouth inhabitants, and water-based humanoid creatures make a brief ‘appearance’.\n\nThere are moments in the book when it does get a little bogged-down in exposition – irrespective of whether it is relayed in dialogue between characters or not. Nevertheless, Dracula telling his back story is really interesting, because we learn which facts from Stoker’s novel are true and which are fiction within fiction, you might say. There is a host of characters, some suspicious at best and some out-and-out abominations, so it’s wise to concentrate on the five main players. One being the mysterious Mariner Priest. Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts will no doubt not be surprised by the grand unmasking. But it doesn’t spoil the romp, which is scattered with exciting set-pieces.\n\nVerdict: 8 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2021)\n\nPublisher: Head of Zeus Ltd, London\n\nFormat: Hardback\n\nPublished: February 2021\n\nDetective Constable Jerry Pardoe is investigating a fatal stabbing in the Pakistani community of London when he is instructed to team-up with Detective Sergeant Jamila Patel of Tooting Police to investigate the accounts of a sewers team of experts. Gemma and her associates had been down below ground, checking out a huge fatberg, when their lights had gone out and strange ghostly figures had appeared. One of their number was dragged away screaming before the others could make their escape. They are interviewed separately, but each of the accounts match perfectly. The discovery of a severed hand prompts Jerry and Jamila to carry out their own search with Gemma’s sewer crew. But this time the lights impossibly turn green and they are assaulted by flying objects which turn out to be ancient keys.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of women are giving birth to angelic-faced but hideously deformed babies. Those that are terminated are finding their way back into the wombs of fertile young women. The creature have deformities which would not allow them to live, but somehow they are alive and in many cases vicious. A surgeon is attacked and killed in a hospital whilst carrying out a termination, by a green gaseous female figure. The detectives are determined to uncover a very natural and normal basis for these astounding events, but they have crossed swords with the supernatural before and, as events progress, they are forced to accept the crazy development that a centuries old witch who was sealed with rituals and a number of demonic padlock keys has escaped from her resting place. But how do you stop a murdering and dismemberment spree when the perpetrator is not solid matter and, as the consort of Satan, is imbibed with some of his powers?\n\nWhilst rereading some of Graham Masterton’s early horror novels – the reviews of which are on this site – it’s very welcome indeed to embrace new material now that he has finished with the Katie Maguire crime thrillers and returned to what he does best. The Children God Forgot is a stand-alone novel, but features the same two police detectives who were in Ghost Virus. Whether this is done for the sake of the writer’s own familiarity or in the hope a TV series or films might be optioned is not clear. However, one major bullseye he achieves here is that not matter now outré the plot may become it is grounded by the most down-to-earth, say-it-as-it-is, Londoner in DC Jerry Pardoe. His irony, mild sarcasm and observations on life are both humorous and endearing. I just love his character. It’s a nice combination too, with the more straightlaced Jamila Patel – even though she occasionally mentions the myths and legends of her ancestors’ country.\n\nThe story motors along at a fair rate of knots – particularly the last two-thirds, and there is evidence of a trait Masterton employed in his early works, which is to set-up the next scene while the previous one is playing-out in order to build anticipation. There is a moral dilemma in this one, too, involving abortion. When does it become acceptable if the child is not expected to live, or if it will be in constant distress and require 24-hour care? The author is careful here not to give the witch the moral high ground, as the moment she realises she can’t possess some of the children she isn’t above destroying them with the justification: If I can’t have them then no one can. I would have given this book full marks, as it’s a very enjoyable and engrossing read, but the finale is set up with our main character knowing what is required and there is no outright resolution. The conclusion is left wide open, with more than a hint that Pardoe and Patel have made no real difference. If this isn’t being prepared for a sequel then the outcome is a little disappointing.\n\nVerdict: 8 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2021)\n\nPublisher: London Folio Society\n\nFormat: Hardback\n\nPublished: May 2022\n\nThe London Folio Society releases The Tombs of Atuan, by Ursula K. Le Guin, originally published in 1971 - the latest in a long line of quality hardback book reprints. It is book two in the acclaimed Earthsea Cycle, following A Wizard of Earthsea (1968), which has also been republished by the Folio Society. The book is bound in printed and blocked cloth, and set in Garamond with Ducinea Serif as display. There are 184 pages, and seven full-page colour illustrations (both on the cover and spaced throughout the book) by David Lupton. In addition, there are printed map endpapers, and it is present in a heavy-duty plain slipcase.\n\nIn The Tombs of Atuan, the High Priestess of the Nameless ones, Arha, dies in her present body. But she has lived on in previous forms, so a search is carried-out for a female child born the moment of the priestess’s death. The girl is identified and taken when she is five years old to be retrained in her duties. She soon comes into conflict with the Priestess of the God Kings. Solace comes with exploring the labyrinths of the Nameless ones in complete darkness. However, she is shocked to find a forbidden man searching for a lost artifact in the tombs, and he might just be a wizard.\n\nThe Tombs of Atuan is, lengthwise, more of a novella than a fully-fledged novel. It would certainly have had significantly more of an impact at the time of its release in the concept days of fantasy – before the popular mass market sword & sorcery of the 1980s – than it might today. The concept is good and taut, with the pressure of Arha’s role bearing down on her young soul, and the darkness, uncertainty and prospective danger of the tombs creating a claustrophobic atmosphere. However, I will say that although the character Ged had already been established in A Wizard of Earthsea, there is insufficient happening in this volume to sustain the length by today’s standards.\n\nThe presentation of this Folio edition, however, is a different matter. It is exquisitely produced, with artwork genuinely fitting for the prose style. These publications are becoming well-sought after, and this will look good on anyone’s bookshelf alongside other releases such as Ray Bradbury’s Something Wicked This Way Comes, William Peter Blatty’s The Exorcist, H.P. Lovecraft’s The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories, H.G. Wells’ The Time Machine and The Island of Doctor Moreau, and Pierre Boulle’s Planet of the Apes. All of these I have reviewed, and can be read on my site.\n\nVerdict: 8 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2022)\n\nPublisher: London Folio Society\n\nFormat: Hardback\n\nPublished: 2020\n\nThe London Folio Society releases Pierre Boulle’s classic novel Planet of the Apes in hardback, with strong slipcase. La Planete des Singes was first published in 1963. It was first published in Britain the following year – translated from the original French by Martin Secker & Warburg – and given the title Monkey Planet. This book follows the 1964 edition, with minor emendations. It is translated by Xan Fielding, with illustrations by David De Las Heras, and an introduction by Frans De Waal. There are 172 pages of good quality thick paper, and wide outer margins.\n\nUlysse Merou, Professor Antelle and his assistant Arthur Levain, a physician, travel to the star system of Betelgeuse and, when investigating an interesting planet called Soror, their shuttle craft crash lands, stranding them there. A group of naked humans approach the men with curiosity, but seem animal-like in their reactions. None of them can speak. A hunt suddenly ensues; several people – including Arthur – are killed, and many others caged and sent to different areas by gorillas in uniform, who are intelligent and speak with authority like men. Ulysse loses touch with the professor, but is caged with a beautiful but primitive woman. He soon learns about a hierarchy of supercilious orang-utans, the more articulate and reasoning chimpanzees, and the mostly brusque and brutal gorillas. He builds-up a rapport with Zira, a female chimpanzee behavioural scientist. His goal is to be on an equal footing with the simian race, but when Nova – the woman he had been caged with – falls pregnant and gives birth to a son, it quickly spreads fear of a potential new race of intelligent humans.\n\nWhen I was young it seemed as though Planet of the Apes was on TV all of the time. In fact, this series had only around 13 episodes, but there were five feature-length films which used the same award-winning make-up effects. If nothing else, check out the original Planet of the Apes film, starring Charlton Heston. It’s not only a science fiction classic, but an all-time film classic. It is phenomenally good. Of course, that film deviates in some respects from this book, for the sake of dramatic impact.\n\nThe book begins with a, frankly, superfluous scene in which a couple are enjoying a holiday away from it all in a small spacecraft. They collect a message in a bottle drifting in space, which contains the written accounts of Ulysse. It is read by the male with constant interruptions and debate about the content. This section is messy and difficult to get a handle on. The only reason it exists is for an extra revelation at the conclusion.\n\nOnce the book settles down to a first-person account of Ulysse’s plight, you are drawn straight into the action. It’s a real page-turner. It’s not all shouting and charging about though. There are periods of poignant introspection: on the treatment of other animals, the moral dilemma of investigative surgery, and the question of authority over cognizance. Very soon I found myself dismissing the imagery of Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowell, and appreciating the original book on its own merits.\n\nThe ending is also very different to the film. Our hero and his new family make it back to the orbiting spacecraft he arrived in (wouldn’t the orbit have decayed over this period?), only to encounter another shock. Charlton Heston’s character doesn’t even get to leave the planet before he is met with an astounding and quite different revelation (I won’t spoil it for those who haven’t seen the film).\n\nThis is a good classic to add to your collection. London Folio should be commended for bringing so much addictive literature back to the masses in such an attractive style. The illustrations are simple but strikingly effective. I love the uniformed gorilla on the front cover of the book, with a back view on the reverse cover. If I have a niggle, it’s that there is nothing printed on the slipcase. I realise it’s there primarily to protect the book, but the title on the spine would have been nice, because now the book has to be displayed on a shelf open-ended, so that you can see the title on the spine of the book.\n\nVerdict: 9 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2020)\n\nPublisher: London Folio Society\n\nFormat: Hardback\n\nPublished: 2019\n\nThe Folio Society, London publishes the classic Something Wicked This Way Comes, by premium Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror and Mystery writer Ray Bradbury. Originally published in 1962 by Simon & Schuster, this luxury 2019 reprint by permission of the Bradbury Estate is presented in hardcover, with good quality paper and wide margins. There are seven hauntingly beautiful red, yellow and black full-page illustrations by Tim McDonagh which are spaced throughout the book – including a skeletal carousel horse which adorns the hard slip case. There is an introduction by comedian, actor and Bradbury fan Frank Skinner, and an Afterward by Bradbury from 1999 called Carnivals, Near and Far.\n\nWilliam Halloway and James Nightshade are 12-year-old neighbours and best friends. They spend all their time together and know each other implicitly, but are as different as chalk and cheese, the sun and the moon. When a lightning rod salesman turns up and warns the boys of an approaching storm, it seems to be a portent of things to come. The atmosphere becomes palpable as a dark carnival arrives just out of town. The boys witness a man riding the carousel backwards and becoming a young boy himself. The friends’ teacher is enticed and lost in the Hall of Mirrors. They have seen too much. Mr Dark, The Illustrated Man sends the Dust Witch and then brings the carnival parade to town with the sole intention of finding the hiding boys. How can they win through against the dark powers of The Skeleton, Mademoiselle Tarot, The Dwarf and Demon Guillotine? Perhaps they need an unexpected ally…\n\nRay Bradbury (1920-2012) is one of my top ten favourite writers of all time. His output was prolific and highly impressive. Furthermore, he couldn’t have been a better ambassador for the profession. Best known for short story collections such as Long After Midnight, The Small Assassin, The October Country, Dark They Were and Golden Eyed, I Sing the Body Electric, and The Golden Apples of the Sun (to name but a few), he also wrote a handful of timeless novels including Dandelion Wine, Fahrenheit 451, The Silver Locusts (The Martian Chronicles), and Something Wicked This Way Comes. The last time I read this book (I still have the paperback) I was in my teens or maybe early twenties. Around that time, I couldn’t get enough of Bradbury, and devoured everything that was available. To my young and enquiring mind Bradbury’s prose was full of magic and poetry of phrase. Everything was wondrous and bright, and mystical and dark.\n\nIn Dandelion Wine and certain short stories Ray Bradbury created a boy character called Douglas. To all intents and purposes Douglas was Bradbury himself, remembering his young and innocent days when everything was larger than life. You could say that in this story Bradbury is Will Halloway, the wide-eyed, sensible and cautious opposite to his neighbour and best friend, Jim Nightshade (the excitable and reckless half). They absorb everything around them as if seeing it for the first and last time. To modern day readers the first few pages will seem slow, but Bradbury is quickly setting the scene in his favoured month of October in a small town, and introducing the partnership of Will and Jim while things still seem mundane – so that the coming oddities will appear that much more pronounced. It soon takes off and a series of set piece events sweep you along for the ride. The Hall of Mirrors, the Dark Carousel, Will’s clash with the Dust Witch, Mr Dark and his mysterious Freaks, and particularly Will’s dad’s novel defence against the Dust Witch, and his marked bullet when he volunteers to shoot as part of a fixed stage performance; there are so many tense, exciting and sometimes humorous moments that it’s difficult to do justice to the whole. But it is in no way complicated or forced. Magical is the word.\n\nYou might think this is solely a children’s book, however, the inclusion of Will’s father serves as a link between the generations, bridging the gap. So, we get the thoughts, opinions and reactions of Charles Halloway as well as the boys. This is a book which spans any age gap. It is highly recommended for the Folio Society’s tribute to Bradbury and one of his major works.\n\nVerdict: 10 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2019)\n\nPublisher: London Folio Society\n\nFormat: Hardback\n\nPublished: 2019\n\nThe London Folio Society republishes seminal science fiction writer H.G. Wells’ classic novel The Time Machine, first published in 1895. The format is hardback, with a protective slip-case. It is bound in blocked buckram and set in Founders Caslon. There are 288 pages on good quality heavy paper. The book contains an attractive Frontispiece and seven illustrations by artist Grahame Baker-Smith. There is also a new introduction by well-known science fantasy writer Michael Moorcock. The Island of Doctor Moreau – also by Wells – is included in this edition. These are two of the most ground-breaking novels in history, for their sheer originality and talking points.\n\nIn The Time Machine, a Victorian scientist builds a machine which takes him to the far future date of 802,701 AD. The peace-loving Eloi are descendants of the human race, but they are afraid of their own skins and particularly the darkness below ground. Here dwell the Morlocks, the other half of the old human race. When his time machine goes missing he is obliged to enter the darkness. This is a great story, well told. It originated the phrase ‘time machine’ and began endless debates surrounding the actual depiction of time, whether it can be manipulated, and the possible consequences of doing so.\n\nIn The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), Pendrick survives a sinking ship when he is picked up by another vessel taking supplies and animals to a remote island. Here he is abandoned to confront the disgraced Moreau, who attempts to justify extreme vivisection experiments on people and animals. Alongside Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, this is the ultimate science versus morality tale, which remains highly relevant today with cloning and genetics a reality.\n\nHerbert George Wells was born in Bromley, England (not a million miles from my humble abode). He was known as the grandfather of Science Fiction. He studied under the renowned biologist Henry Huxley. He also wrote The Invisible Man (1897), The War of the Worlds (1898), First Men in the Moon (1901), and The War in the Air (1908). Additionally, he wrote a number of fiction short stories. Less known are his manifestos about society and maintaining peace. He died in 1946, pleased I’m sure that he got to see the end of World War II.\n\nThe two novels depicted here undoubtedly made the most impact in terms of getting the world talking. I love the formal and gentlemanly prose of the late 1800s and early 1900s. No latter-day whizzes and bangs here. But then that really is the point. They are classic and shouldn’t be changed. This is a very well-presented book. The fact that only one illustration represents The Island of Doctor Moreau makes me think this second story was added as an afterthought. I’m simply glad it was added at all.\n\nVerdict: 8 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2019)\n\nPublisher: London Folio Society\n\nFormat: Hardback\n\nPublished: 2017\n\nThe Folio Society of London has released two versions of this collection: the Limited Version which is bound in eco-simulated leather, blocked with a design by the artist Dan Hillier, who also produces six illustrations, eight mandalas. The version received for review is the Core Edition, bound in cloth blocked with a design by the artist. It is set in Italian Old Style with Goudy Forum as display, and incorporates 472 heavy pages and 18 stories, with a title page spread and six black and white illustrations inspired by the weird and bizarre and ultimately brilliantly dark stories of HP Lovecraft. Endpapers spot varnished with a design by the artist, gold gilt page tops, and a printed metallic slipcase 10” x 6.75”. There is a very entertaining and informative preface by author, comic writer and all-round eccentric Alan Moore.\n\nThere is something to be coveted about a quality, lovingly constructed hardback book (it’s better than coveting your neighbour’s ass!). This is a very nice book, and any new publication of the stories I know and love so well is always cause for celebration in my opinion. Lovecraft is easily in the top three horror fiction writers of all time, and I would even venture to say was quite possibly the greatest. He dubbed his own style as Weird Fiction, but is possibly better described as Cosmic Horror.\n\nNow, you would think with a publication format as unique as this we might be expected to be offered the complete works of this great writer. Instead, we have what turns out to be a quite diverse collection of his tales. Every fan will undoubtedly have their own favourites and that’s to be expected; however, I have some reservations about some of the choices presented. Possibly, the notion is to vary the types of story to show originality of style and content. Nevertheless, certain more well-known examples are always going to have more impact on the untried reader.\n\nThe inclusion of those seldom represented in Lovecraft collections has to be commended, but Celephais (featuring a dream city which might just be real), and Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family (a potted history of relations involving a white ape race), may just leave newcomers somewhat cold without the context of other stories. Herbert West – Reanimator is more well-known because of the film, and this is precisely the reason why I’m not keen on the then contemporary variation on the Frankenstein theme.\n\nI like the inclusion of The Outsider, Cool Air, and The Statement of Randolph Carter – all effective stand-alone tales of the macabre. But the best examples are left until last: no collection should be without the mesmerising The Call of Cthulhu (uncovering the background to a small idol of the greatest and most terrible of the Ancient Ones), then we have The Colour Out of Space (wherein an object is uncovered which corrupts the land and anyone living on it – a keen personal favourite), The Whisperer in Darkness (correspondence to a man studying a frightening phenomenon), and The Shadow Over Innsmouth (I love this one too, in which a little sea port is overrun with humanoid sea mutants who worship or fear a god).\n\nAs the book contains large areas of blank page around the print, you wonder if more content could have been added. I realise At the Mountains of Madness is pretty much a novel, but it would have been nice to see the excellent The Strange High House in the Mist, The Shadow Out of Time, and The Dunwich Horror. Still, any true book collector with cash to spare will lap this book up and perhaps see it as an investment. I very much enjoyed revisiting these timeless classics.\n\nVerdict: 8 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2017)\n\nPublisher: Star Books (W.H.

She sees an expert, Dr Hughes, who discovers through x-rays that it consists of tissue and bone, and shifts its position sometimes. He arranges for a surgeon to cut it out the following morning. That night she visits Harry Erskine for help. Harry is a charlatan clairvoyant, preying on the insecurity of rich old ladies. Karen tells him about a recurring dream or nightmare she is having involving a village of huts and a distant threatening galleon. Feeling that she is genuine, Harry urges Karen to take a note of her surroundings and the flag on the ship when she has the nightmare that night.\n\nHarry visits Dr Hughes the next day and relays the dream to him. Initially skeptical, Hughes admits he has run out of ideas, and agrees when Harry suggests finding a medium for some answers. Mrs Karmann holds a seance for Harry and two friends, but an evil spirit comes through, materialising as a head rising out from the centre of a wooden table. It resembles a Red Indian. Harry learns that medicine men had great powers and could be reborn. Meanwhile, Karen Tandy is under the control of the thing on her neck. She has to be isolated because she is becoming threatening, speaking somebody else's words and moving around when she shouldn't be able to.\n\nAn anthropologist refers Harry to Singing Rock, a modern day medicine man, who tells him that Gitche Manitou is the Great Spirit. What they are dealing with here is, in the same sense, the manitou of a powerful ancient medicine man. They can be reborn a limited number of times, becoming more powerful on each occasion. This is Misquamacus from the mid-seventeenth century, who wants his revenge on the white man race which slaughtered his people. The ship in Karen's dream was that of Dutch settlers who made promises to the Native Americans before slaughtering them.\n\nMisquamacus is born stunted in growth by the earlier x-rays taken of Karen's neck. Disoriented, he still has the power to summon the Star Beast, which Harry is forced to face alone. But that is the least of Harry's problems. As his power grows, Misquamacus summons The Great Old One. Singing Rock tells Harry that if they don't do something this will be the beginning of the end. This is like the Christians fighting Satan himself. The Great Old One is also known as the Great Devourer, which speaks for itself. They return to the basement of the hospital to confront it.\n\nSinging Rock has explained that there is a spirit in everything: the water, the earth, the air, and even the rocks - and these can be used to aid us. Harry reasons that if there is a potentially helpful spirit in everything then they must also be present in objects. He proposes to fight ancient magic with modern science by attempting to call the manitou of the large and knowledgeable police computer - Unitrak. Singing Rock attempts to summon Unitrak's manitou, but admits it is white man's magic. Harry is obliged to improvise. He implores in every way he can, and just as Misquamacus and the Great Old One reach him the blinding light, electricity and numbers of Unitrak blasts forth, sending the Great Old One back to whence he came, and turning Misquamacus into a blackened husk.\n\nIt is over. Against all the odds they have survived, and so has the human race. Even Karen is still alive - although it will take time and patience for her to heal, both in body and mind.\n\nFor this revisit to early Graham Masterton horror novels we go right back to the beginning. This is where it all started. The Manitou showed its pedigree, having an immediate reaction by becoming a bestseller and spawning a 1978 film adaptation starring Tony Curtis as Harry Erskine, Susan Strasberg as Karen Tandy, Michael Ansara as John Singing Rock, and Burgess Meredith as Doctor Snow (another Doctor). This is the first time that Masterton delved into world mythology, bring 'impossible' situations realistically into a contemporary setting. This proved to be a deep fountain of knowledge that he would return to regularly.\n\nIt's a novel idea that if all natural things have a spirit, then why shouldn't modern man-made objects. It opens-up a potential new world of terrors and previously unknown allies. The book's prose flows pretty smoothly, with little or no time for reflection. Therefore, don't expect any padding. It gets in, tells the story and gets out again. There is a mention in the book that the Great Old One is the terror of faces that appear in the grain of wooden wardrobes. This is an early reference to what would become the sequel, Revenge of the Manitou. The Great Old One's appearance in The Manitou is described as squid-like, which is undoubtedly a homage to H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu.\n\nI have been enjoying these re-reads of Graham Masterton's early horror output, and am very happy that, after a few years of writing police suspense thrillers set in Ireland, that he has returned to horror with books such as The House of a Hundred Whispers, and The Children God Forgot.\n\nVerdict: 8 out of 10\n\n(Original Review Ty Power 2021)\n\nPublisher: Sphere Books\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 1979\n\nJohn Hyatt, a sanitation inspector, is visited by an old man called Seymour Wallis who has bought an old house and is convinced it is breathing. Taking along a colleague called Dan, he visits the house that night. They hear the breathing , and when the phenomenon is challenged the breathing becomes quicker and heavier, culminating in Dan being thrown across the room. Visiting his work colleague in hospital, John learns that Dan has been breathing heavily at odd moments. For an instant he has intense red eyes.\n\nJohn calls in on his friend and one-time lover Jane Torres where she works in a little bookshop. He persuades her to visit the house, along with the hospital doctor and another colleague engineer called Bryan Corder. Seymour tells them the breathing has stopped. It has transferred to Dan, who is now in a coma. They search the house - passing a large bear with a woman's face that Jane finds vaguely familiar - and Bryan checks out the chimney. He hears a non-human heartbeat, before becoming trapped and screaming in panic. When the others pull him out his entire head has been stripped of flesh. John is later told the man is still alive, but only through his strange irregular heartbeat. Looking for the missing Jane, John goes back to speak with Seymour, only to find him hugely bloated and apparently dead. The post mortem shows he has twenty-two pints of blood in his system. The blood of some species of dog.\n\nJane has been looking into the Red Indian legends of Big Monster and First One To Use Words By Force. They had a motto that translates as 'Return', meaning they will come together again piece by piece. It seems that something has been smuggling itself out of Seymour's house a bit at a time. First breathing, then heartbeat, and now blood. Jane is advised to go to Round Valley and talk to one of the medicine men. John goes along. The old medicine man is George Thousand Names. He confirms Jan's research and states that the Bear Maiden was the catalist. He gives the vital advice to separate the three parts into different hospitals, use the painting in the house to locate the hair (and keep it away from FOTUWBF), and to keep women away from the parts - as the Red Indian demon trickster Coyote is partial to female flesh.\n\nThe drive back to the hospital and, while George Thousand Names is trying to convince the police lieutenant of the very real threat from Coyote, Dan and Bryan - whose physical forms have conjoined together - break through the isolation glass. A policeman and another doctor are killed by the incomplete Coyote, before the others escape. The strange concoction of flesh and bone passes them by to search for his blood, currently in the body of Seymour. George Thousand Names tells the others that if Coyote doesn't get within one moon's rising he'll be banished back to the underworld.\n\nJane has been sent to the house to try and remove the wolf-like door knocker - the face of Coyote. Coyote manages to fine his blood at the expense of Seymour's body. Meanwhile, George Thousand Names freezes and shatters the door knocker with a ritual, but Jane has been attacked by Coyote and become the Bear Maiden. All George and John can do now is to prevent Coyote getting Big Monster's shorn-off hair and becoming whole.\n\nThey trace the location - through pictures in the house - to the cables of the Golden Gate Bridge. But Coyote is at the house, too. Coyote traces Big Monster's powerful hair to the bridge, where it is entwined in the cables. He is now all-powerful and immortal, but John lures the demon with the Bear Maiden, before snatching the hair and placing it on his own head. The power almost destroys his mind, but he controls it long enough to send Coyote back to hell, and then throws the hair into the waters below.\n\nHere we are with another random choice in my marathon re-read of Graham Masterton's early horror novels. Again, the pace is relentless. The author returns to the Red Indian culture of The Manitou (and to a lesser extent The Wells of Hell). It is also the start of a running theme of featuring a wolf's head door knocker in many of his books. This, I believe was a nod of recognition to his regular readers.\n\nMany of Masterton's books contain such vivid scenes that you can picture them instantly in your mind. Consequentially, they would make great films - particularly now that legendary monsters and spiritual beings has be competently created using CGI. The narrative flows very smoothly, making this relatively easy reading, and has lost none of its impact over the years (41 and counting!). Although the characters are very much of their time - smoking like troopers and drinking lots of whisky to settle the nerves - the book emerged in a era of creature horror fiction which he and James Herbert helped create, and is the real deal amidst a then sea of bandwagon mediocrity.\n\nVerdict: 8 out of 10\n\n(Original Review Ty Power 2020)\n\nPublisher: Sphere Books\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 1979\n\nMason Perkins is a self-employed plumber in New Milford. He is called to the Bodine residence to check discolouration in the water. Taking a sample to the Health Department, Dan Kirk analyses it and discovers micro-organisms which under the microscope resemble sea horses with a rudimentary respiratory system, which secrete large amounts of a substance that colourises the water. Mason and Dan find a mouse in the lab which has drunk the sample of water and developed a carapace and crustacean-like spikes. Not able to contact the Bodines, they go to the seemingly empty house, where they find serious water damage - particularly in the boy's bedroom - and an impossibly high tide mark on the walls. They find the apparently drowned boy, and a carapace in the bathroom twice the size of a crash helmet.\n\nThey bring in the local police. A medical examiner finds a tough carapace on the child, along with spikes along his back. The organisms in the water are found to date from prehistoric times, making it astonishing they are still alive. Mason returns home to find a hysterical missing boy from the neighbourhood in his house. He is at the point of unconsciousness but tells Mason he has spoken to Alison and Jimmy Bodine in the darkness of the woods. He couldn't see them properly and they spoke with strange, frightening voices. They want to meet with Mason - with no police present.\n\nMason and Dan check out the well at the Bodine residence. It is continually seeping water. A neighbour tells them that none of his ancestry have ever drunk the well water due to a warning nursery rhyme. He comes from a book which he has in storage. Mason goes to meet the Bodines , who he can't see clearly in the darkness. They have both been transformed into something else, and he is attacked by what was Alison. Dan precipitates their escape by hitting her with Mason's pipe wrench and hearing the breaking chitin. They tell the police what happened, and they dispatch a search party for the Bodines. Dan is later dozing on his sofa when one of the creatures breaks a window and copious amounts of water impossibly fills the room. He only narrowly escapes drowning.\n\nMason recovers the book from storage; it is leather-bound and dates back to the late 1700s. There is a page about the wells, and a rhyme of warning from the Red Indians: \"Ye beast-gods have tentacles like unto sqiddes & claws like unto lobsters, & above all exude ye odour like unto ye rottige fishes.\" At a nearby town a family has been slaughtered in their car, the roof cut-off like a huge tin-opener. Someone has spotted one of the creatures in the woods nearby, and the police drive to the location, followed by Mason, Dan and Rheta, Dan's colleague who Mason has aspirations on. Mason tries to talk to the creature that used to be a friend, but nearly dies again in the process. The Sheriff fires a rocket launcher at it, and it bounces on the ground, penetrating the underbelly of the otherwise heavily armoured creature.\n\nThey are told they will need a spirit clairvoyant or medium when the Sheriff arranges to drill down into the Bodine's well. They convince Mrs Thompson who turns out to be a descendant of the person mentioned in the book who traversed the caverns of the beast. But the awakening beast creates a psychic projection of itself and creates a flood from nowhere in her house. Mrs Thompson is killed by a falling weather vane (shades of The Omen).\n\nThe drilling has already started when Mason and Dan arrive at the Bodine residence. Mason is persuaded by the Sheriff to go down and check-out what's there, but all three of them agree to be lowered down one-by-one. They find a cavern with a natural balcony overlooking a lake. A large crab creature rises to confront them. The Sheriff shoots-off its eye stalks, but before he can bring the rocket launcher to bear, he is dragged into the water and crushed by its pincer claw. Mason, seeing the near loss of their only weapon, throws himself at the creature, but is dragged under the water. He manages to fire the rocket launcher, and fights his way to the surface only to find himself in a lower cavern where sits the huge black maggot creature known as Quithe, Chulthe, or Satan. It seduces him, showing visions of all the monstrosities it will inflict on the earth under its new regime.\n\nUsing the distraction of a floating dead body, Mason dives down and finds the waterway to the higher cavern. It has been decided by Dan and a police deputy to blow-up the cavern so that the water all runs down to the lower, dry caverns, thereby stranding Chulthe, who is a creature of the water. Without a check to confirm the success of the ploy, Mason is taken to hospital to recover and return to his normal life.\n\nAs a life-long horror fan, I've read many authors; however none can touch Graham Masterton, who not only has a captivating writing style but has an extraordinary gift of being able to take myths and legends from different cultures and times and placing them in a contemporary setting with real authenticity. From the moment I first discovered and devoured his debut bestselling novel, The Manitou, I have been a convert and devoured every horror novel he has written. Inevitably, some are better than others, but they never fail to captivate me. It is only recently, when he returned to horror after a string of police thriller novels, that I decided to embark on a marathon re-read of early Graham Masterton horror books. The Wells of Hell is my first selection.\n\nYou'll find that there is no padding in Masterton's books; he simply gets on with the story, making the majority of them fast-moving - which, of course, also keeps the tension taught, whilst still allowing for the odd tidbit of humour to humanise the characters and ground them in near-reality. In this one no one believes anything unless they see it with their own eyes. The creatures are kept in darkness much of the time, as Masterton realises that fear of the unknown has the most power. This is a new realisation of the devil borrowed, it seems, from H.P. Lovecraft's Old Ones or Elder Gods - and in particular Cthulhu - as the main name for the devil utilised in this story is Chulthe.\n\nThe character of Mason Perkins is your everyman tradesman. Although many people in reality would turn their back and run a mile if presented with this horror, it helps that the people in the town appear to know each other well. This places a moral obligation to help friends and associates in trouble. At times, Mason seems to lead a charmed life, nearly losing his life on at least a handful of occasions. Whilst coming across as a reluctant hero, the reality of the character is that he goes with life's events, trying to ride them to the best possible conclusion, rather than reinventing the wheel. This makes the relative open-ended climax somewhat more realistic. Our hero doesn't even get the girl. It's clever to have a conventional solution to a supernatural terror, too.\n\nOne of the most striking points of this impressive book is that there is always a forward plan of events. It's almost mapped-out like story-boarding in a film. But rather than happen one at a time, they overlap. A piece of information is planted to follow-up later, or there is someone to visit. Or a significant horror takes place off-page, so-to-speak. All these these things happen while something else is taking place, leaving intrigue for the reader to chew on. This also helps the narrative to flow and the story race to catch-up.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this book to lovers of 1970s and 1980s pulp horror, although Masterton is head and shoulders above most of the hack writers from this period. The majority of his books are available for easy eBook download. Try this one out. You won't be disappointed.\n\nVerdict: 10 out of 10\n\n(Original Review Ty Power 2020)\n\nPublisher: Sphere Books\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 1979\n\nDan Cook is an American cartographer who is in France researching for a friend's book on the Normandy D-Day landings. He comes across a long-abandoned rusting Sherman tank which has the rural locals living in fear. They say it causes bad luck. Madeleide is a farmer's daughter who is convinced the tank was responsible for her mother's death. Many others say they hear voices emanating from within. Dan talks to father Anton, a priest in his nineties, who informs him that at the bridge of Le Vey in July 1944, thirteen mysterious black tanks smashed through the German lines, killing hundreds of Hitler's troops, before moving on. At no time had any of the hatches opened, and it was discovered afterwards that they were sealed - as is this one which was left behind.\n\nWhen Dan suggests opening up the tank to see what is inside, he is warned of the consequences - least not by Eloise, Madeleide's father's housekeeper. Others are grateful for his strength to do something about the evil they have lived under for years. Madeleide and Father Anton go with him. Eloise chooses not to go, but gives him a ring of hair from a firstborn child who was sacrificed to Moloch centuries ago when devils plagued Rouen. It shows that you have already paid your respects to the evil.\n\nDan uses tools from the farm to chisel away the welding from around the turret. Inside, he finds an ancient sack which feels like it contains loose bones. Father Anton instructs him to put it in a medieval chest he has in the cellar of his house, and they lock it in for the night. Dan later hears a disturbance and checks on Father Anton. The priest's entrails have been ripped-out and the demon from the tank uses the man's body like a puppet. When Antoinette, the priest's housekeeper, runs from her room, every knife and blade in the vicinity flies towards her and she is killed.\n\nThe demon announces itself as Elmek - sometimes known as Asmorod - the devil of knives and sharp edges. It threatens the life of Madeleide, telling Dan they must transport the chest to England and find the Reverend Taylor, with whom Elmek has past experience. The plan is to find the brethren twelve demons and, when they are together, to raise the more powerful Adramelech.\n\nDan and Madeleide find the Reverend Taylor in England. He gives them an English language version of L'Invocation des Anges, that describes the identities of the thirteen demons and how to invoke their corresponding angels. The other demons are in an unofficial military building in London, so - threatened by small demonstrations of Elmek's power - they push on. The building is in the charge of Lieutenant Colonel Thanet. The sacks are laid out in the cellar. Madeleide seems to come into her own. She tells Dan she will release each demon, thereby identifying it, and he should read-out the passage in the book invoking the appropriate angel to combat it.\n\nWhen they have all been revived and the demons have called-up Adramelech - the Grand Chancellor of Hell - Thanet tries to bargain with it. When he realises he can't pay the price he runs for the stairs and is engulfed in flame. Madeleide finally understands her purpose when she learns she is the reincarnation of the martyred girl given to Adramelech by General Patton in exchange for help against the Germans, using the tanks. But this time she is possessed by the deceitful angel Hod, who can bring down the invoked angels. The demons are destroyed but only a mortal can banish Adramelech with proof of the existence of Christ. Eloise had given Dan the last help she was able, and Dan steps forward and banishes the master demon by opening the tin and throwing the ashes of Christ's seamless robe over it. Dan is informed by Hod that Madeleide will be reincarnated again, with no memories of these events. She deserves a happy life, free of fear and responsibilty.\n\nThis is the second random choice (Following The Wells of Hell) in my marathon re-read of Graham Masterton's early horror novels. In my opinion, he is unsurpassed in reliably writing a string of outstanding and gripping horror tales - the majority of which are unmissable. His writing style is fast-paced and tightly edited, with no padding and unnecessary exposition. In this one, the demon presence is mainly made known through its actions and influences. It is only seen in its real form in the climatic scene in the cellar. By doing this Masterton keeps the villain hidden - or at least faceless until the end.\n\nIt's quite a psychoanalytic horror. The fact that the locals had been living in fear of the evil in the tank, most seem uncharacteristically ready to open the tank - even though it might unleash an even greater evil on them. When Dan and Madeleide are crossing the English Channel, Dan briefly has the idea of throwing the chest into the sea. I think this would be the logical solution for most intelligent people, and there isn't a proper explanation why this isn't done. Ironically, in a subsequent unrelated novel, Masterton returns to this quandary and this time offers a convincing argument - almost as if this moment had been playing on his mind.\n\nYou could be excused for calling this a book version of a road movie; however, it isn't so much a journey of discovery as a threatening obligation. The main character is very much a product of the 1970s, as he hardly ever eats but smokes like a trooper. This is both comfortable and compelling reading. I have off-loaded many of my books over the years - as I have so many - but I've held onto my favourite authors and still have all the original paperbacks of Graham Masterton, among others. Like records, they form a part of your life. Masterton was one of the writers that you could say I grew up with. Do yourself a favour and share in the experience by downloading a copy.\n\nVerdict: 9 out of 10\n\n(Original Review Ty Power 2020)\n\nPublisher: Telos Publishing\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPublished: 1977 (2010)\n\nHarry Erskine attends his godfather's funeral at a gothic-style old house near the seafront. Here he meets a mysterious and beautiful woman who seems as interested as him as to the circumstances surrounding Max's death. His Godmother, Marjorie, is determined to have the house burnt to the ground, as per her late husband's instructions. It seems Max was an avid collector of ancient Persian artefacts, and that one particular piece drove him to cut off his own face. The pot that Harry vaguely recalls from childhood visits has been heavily sealed within a turret of the house, and adorned with ancient spells and mystic symbols. Was Max insane, or simply being extremely careful? He had been convinced that the vessel was that which Ali Baba had held contained the forty thieves - a powerful djinn which could unleash forty representations of gruesome death. Harry and the woman Anna must determine whether the danger is real - particularly as someone in their midst has selfish and ultimately catastrophic ambitions...\n\nThis is a reprint of a book first published back in 1977 by Star. It was only Masterton's second horror fiction release, following his debut bestseller, The Manitou. The key protagonist from that book was retained here; Harry Erskine is a charlatan clairvoyant, a sort of lovable rogue who obtains money from vulnerable but rich old ladies, who are quite happy to be complimented and informed of impending good fortune. This was significant in The Manitou, because Harry is very sceptical of the supernatural world, but his natural order is turned on its head by bizarre events. As far as The Djinn is concerned, it doesn't need to be Harry, as there is no direct connection to his unscrupulous trade, and he should be less dismissive of events beyond the natural order.\n\nGraham Masterton has always possessed a smooth, flowing narrative which makes for comfortable reading. He often utilises metaphors to prevent the need for long descriptive passages. So his stories inevitably rattle along at a cracking pace. A particular skill he incorporates in abundance is the knack of selecting a nasty myth or legend from anywhere in the world and setting it very convincingly into a contemporary setting. His earlier books, like this one, settle on a central theme that doesn't allow itself to be diverted by pointless story threads. Consequentially, now we are a decade into the twenty first century, some people may consider it to be restrictive in terms of action and events. This could be referred to as gentlemanly horror, with a professor, an old-school doctor, and plans of strategy conducted in a posh restaurant. This scenario would certainly work well as part of a TV anthology series.\n\nThis new edition of The Djinn is published by Telos, whose pages are always of good quality, although the thin cover makes it prone to bending slightly out of shape unless you are very careful. The book contains an exclusive introduction from the author, describing the origin of the story and Middle-East Djinn legends.\n\nHaving appreciatively experienced every book in his extensive horror arsenal over the years, I was pleased at the prospect of revisiting a book I still possess but haven't read since its original publication. I can honestly report that I thoroughly enjoyed the read, and it immediately started me considering re-reading some others from his early years. Perhaps Telos will be able reprint more. Charnel House anyone? Or The Wells of Hell? What about The Devils of D-Day? Or perhaps...\n\nVerdict: 8 out of 10\n\n(Review originally written by Ty Power for reviewgraveyard 2010)\n\nPublisher: Star Books (W.H.
