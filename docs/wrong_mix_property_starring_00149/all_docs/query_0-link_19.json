It is not a traditional horror film by any means. Karloff essentially plays a fictional version of himself, a washed up horror actor who feels his brand of horror is not scary anymore. Meanwhile, a young man kills his wife and family and begins a mass shooting spree across California. Real horror juxtaposed with film horror. It’s terrific.\n\nGothamsknight\n\nA Dark Knight\n\nJoined\n\nNov 28, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n16,667\n\nReaction score\n\n29,334\n\nPoints\n\n103\n\nOct 2, 2021\n\n#32\n\nEnded up watching 30 Days of Night instead tonight. 7/10 for me.

XD\n\nAnd boy, they tricked me.\n\nI expected a Hillbilly slasher with due to incest deformed Hillbilly murderers...and i got a cult of Boring people living in the woods just because, killing people.\n\nI couldnt be bothered to care about the movie after that reveal because i felt cheated.\n\nWhy would you reboot a Hillbilly slasher series when thats not what you go for?\n\nGod damn it, i was super excited for this and got something boring out of it...i curse everyone involved and hope they have stones in their shoes for at least a month.\n\nHopefully the second night will entertain me more.\n\nNardz937\n\nIn The Chill Of Night.\n\nJoined\n\nJul 12, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n4,742\n\nReaction score\n\n7,766\n\nPoints\n\n103\n\nOct 2, 2021\n\n#34\n\nKicking off the week with some golden age films that I hadn't seen yet.

Darkman\n\nFun Size Review: Raimi's classic about fear, anger and misery, misery, misery. The influence from Burton's Batman is apparent, as is the commonality with Raimi's own Spider-Man. Fun fact. I grew up thinking the lead was Bill Nye, the Science Guy.\n\n2. Tragedy Girls\n\nFun Size Review: The leads carrying this fun, energetic little tale of aspiring serial killers. The 80's slasher storyline meshes perfectly with the 21st century aesthetic. Also, a surprising amount of known actors fill out the cast, and do so well.\n\n3. Freaky\n\nFun Size Review: Kathryn Newton is as captivating , as Vince Vaughn is annoyingly dated in this fun romp. I really like this, but I do wonder how much better it would be, with an actor whose go to move for portraying women and gay men wasn't the limp wrist.\n\n4. The Fanatic\n\nFun Size Review: An absolutely terrible and offensive movie, until it becomes utterly hilarious. Honestly, one of the most interesting character studies of the last few years. Not of any of the characters, but the director himself.\n\n5. Beetlejuice\n\nFun Size Review: An all time fav, that continues to befuddle me with how much it crams into so little . Seriously, how is this only 90 minutes with everything that happens? It has it all. Incredible performances, music, cinematography, editing, art direction, costume design. Everything. When daylight comes, I don't wanna go home.\n\nKane52630\n\nT-800 User\n\nJoined\n\nJan 6, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n118,156\n\nReaction score\n\n52,527\n\nPoints\n\n218\n\nOct 3, 2021\n\n#36\n\nBingo Hell\n\nAt the Movies with Kane and BN\n\n3.5/5\n\n31 Day Horror Marathon 2021\n\nDay 1 | Malignant (4/5) (REWATCH)\n\nDay 2 | Bingo Hell (3.5/5)\n\n​\n\nKane52630\n\nT-800 User\n\nJoined\n\nJan 6, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n118,156\n\nReaction score\n\n52,527\n\nPoints\n\n218\n\nOct 3, 2021\n\n#37\n\n4.

Sinister (New)\n\nFun Size Review: Sinister has a decent concept and mood, but is let down by an overbearing score and poor direction. A less blah director would have let this film breathe and build tension naturally, without spoiling every movement with the soundtrack. Also considering the story, it would have been nice to get to know the family. The best thing about this ones are the jump scares, that genuinely work pretty well.\n\n7. Venom: Let There Be Carnage (New)\n\nFun Size Review: This sequel is lean, mean and a lot of fun. It's refreshing that they realized what everyone liked about the first, and just made a sequel to fit that need. This won't win any awards, but I'd easily take it over DC's two offerings this year.\n\nAsr\n\nSidekick\n\nJoined\n\nOct 5, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n3,481\n\nReaction score\n\n1,204\n\nPoints\n\n103\n\nOct 4, 2021\n\n#49\n\nProbably won't be able to watch a movie every day this month, or make it all the way to 10/31 either since I'm moving at the end of the month, but will get as far as I can anyway. So that said:\n\n1. 30 Days of Night (7/10)\n\n2. Ghoulies (1/10), and Ghoulies II (3/10)\n\nNeither of these were good, but the sequel was certainly more entertaining at least. The one thing I'll give these credit for is their practical effects though! Every time I watch a movie from the 80s (or before), I wonder how they did their practical effects.\n\n3. Malignant (7/10)\n\nWent to go see this at the theater. Dang what a trippy movie. I went in expecting something along the lines of Wan's previous supernatural movies (Conjuring, Insidious, etc) so I was sorta disappointed this wasn't exactly that. Still entertaining though, and did not see that twist coming at all, which totally freaked me out. IMO the ending was a bit campy though. Was hoping for more of a traditional Wan-style stinger."
