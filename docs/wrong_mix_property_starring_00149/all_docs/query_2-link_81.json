        "text": "By Daniel Santillan\n\nIn September 2016, the Vincent Price Art Museum opened Tastemakers & Earthshakers: Notes from Los Angeles Youth Culture, 1943-2016, a multimedia exhibition that traversed eight decades of style, art, and music to examine youth culture in Los Angeles. The exhibition featured over 100 artworks by more than 40 artists and collectives, including that of Felix Quintana, a Los Angeles artist and educator currently based in the Bay Area. I visited the exhibition when I was a student at East Los Angeles College, and I was struck by Quintana’s work, whose work on display was technologically unique and unlike anything I had ever seen before. His artwork on display was titled The Repetition of Power, which depicts a group of police officer searching two individuals. Each figure is created with light and the vibrant composition is presented against a solid black background. The gestural rays of light reminded me of a low shutter photography technique where light is manipulated across a photograph. I remember not totally understanding how this object was created but I knew it was something special and worth further exploration.\n\nThis summer, as one of the 2021 Getty interns at VPAM, I had the opportunity to learn more about past exhibitions and objects from the museum’s permanent collection, using them as case studies for museum education and object-based learning strategies. While discussing the Tastemakers and Earthshakers exhibition, I expressed my interest in learning more about Quintana’s work and, with the support of my supervisor Joseph Valencia, I was able to schedule a virtual studio visit with the artist to further study his artistic practice.\n\nThrough our conversation, I learned how Quintana oscillates between analog and digital mediums to find his perfect balance of creative harmony, transforming innovative experimental concepts into the fine art realm. His work intersects with drawing, painting, photography, and digital media to develop innovative visual representations of Los Angeles and other locales.\n\nQuintana’s Light Paintings series (2013-2018) is perhaps his most technically involved body of work. Each artwork in the series showcases the artist’s love for photography and artistic experimentation by capturing long exposures of light, then turning to Adobe Photoshop to create expressive and figurative forms. Built upon layers and layers of light, these works can take hours or even months to complete due to their complex technical process. To me, the repetition of layers also relates to repeated patterns of injustices such as police brutality, as addressed in The Repetition of Power. The artist was inspired in part by abstract expressionism where gestural and color field artists worked to seek the truth through freeform line-work and strokes, color, and compositions of negative space. The freedom of movement in the line-work in Quintana’s light painting also relates to the notion of migration and displacement, an important topic throughout time. For Quintana, the series has served as a valuable exercise in balancing analog and digital mediums while also trying to create something entirely new and different.\n\nAnother series we discussed is The Los Angeles Blueprint (2019-present) where Quintana gathers online images from Google Maps that capture LA residents in their natural routine of everyday activities and transforms them into unique blueprint style cyanotype prints. In each composition, Quintana incorporates hand-etchings of iconography commonly associated with Los Angeles such as palm trees, graffiti, and other symbols. Organic strokes of movement are also etched into the pieces as underlying memories of migration which is still in progress today.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the artist began creating a new series titled Movement Building Art (2020-present), returning to the fundamentals of drawing by hand to help raise awareness of contemporary social justice issues facing communities of color, such as the growing housing crisis caused by big capital. Quintana imports his drawings into Adobe Illustrator to vectorize the line-work, then adds vivid saturated colors and important typographic messages to communicate his messages. The organic strokes from the hand drawings continue to play with the artist’s notion of movement evolving into coexistence with incorporating the technology of digital arts tools. Produced with the intention of being easily circulated online, these works remind us about how art can be of service to communities in need.\n\nQuintana is currently working toward completing his graduate degree in photography in the Bay Area before returning to the city that inspires his work. He continues to serve as a teaching artist and classroom educator in Los Angeles and the Bay Area while also further refining his creative practice, artistic vocabulary, and technical skills within analog and digital mediums."
