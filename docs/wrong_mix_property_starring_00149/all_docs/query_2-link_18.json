In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal at the time, Price said “I am crazy about new Mexico. If I had lots of money, I would like to have a house like Georgia O’Keefe’s here.” Price served on the Arts and Craft Board of the Interior Department and had a doctorate from the California College of Arts and Crafts.\n\nDigging through our archives, we uncovered this fabulous promo video promoting the Albuquerque Museum Foundation—a non-profit that raises funds for the Albuquerque Museum. You can learn more about us, and as the King of Horror suggests, support us!"
