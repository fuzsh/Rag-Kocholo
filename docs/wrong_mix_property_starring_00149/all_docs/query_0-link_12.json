        "text": "After having been purchased in 2020, the house made famous in a movie is again for sale.\n\nThe house and neighborhood was used for filming scenes in the 1990 blockbuster ‘Edward Scissorhands.’ It was directed by Tim Burton and starred Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Vincent Price and many others. With a $20 million budget, the film earned $86,024,005 worldwide.\n\nJoey Licalzi purchased the home in 2020 for what Zillow.com reports was a $230,000 price tag. He and his wife turned the former movie set into a free museum. They remodeled the interior to look as it did when the movie was filmed.\n\nNow, there’s a listing on Century 21 that shows the house for sale. The asking price is currently $699,900 for the three bedroom/two bathroom, 1,432 sq. ft.\n\nhome.\n\nBelow, you can watch a tour of the house/museum.\n\n[Source: News Channel 8/pro.imdb.com/Zillow.com/Century 21]\n\nHere are some of the top films made in the Tampa Bay area. See what locations you recognize.\n\nhttps://myq105.com/author/masondixon/feed/"
