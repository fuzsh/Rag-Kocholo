        "text": "One of the most pleasing and, of course, most instantly obvious features of Tim Burton's drawings is how closely they resemble their creator. His sketches are a lifetime's work - largely produced in the planning of each of his films - and the physical similarity is unmistakable. From his earliest short film, Vincent, through Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands and his most recent production, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, they share his sad, charcoal-crusted eyes, attenuated bodies and hair that his long-term collaborator Johnny Depp once said expresses \"much more than last night's pillow struggle\". But emotionally, too: Burton's sketches all have something of the boyish lost soul, the baffled outsider to them, usually in their gloomily sloping-down eyes, or their slumped stance. Or maybe it's their all-black outfits, a uniform that Burton himself wears every day, like a student living in Camden Town in the 1980s, as opposed to a hugely successful film director on a wiltingly hot summer's day.\n\nTo look from Burton to his drawings is like looking at an Escher drawing, as if the artist had simply reached around and drawn himself - or, more simply, that his stories are about him. It is more difficult to avoid such connections when meeting Burton in person: at first, he is all awkward jerks, plucking at his sleeve (black, of course), tugging at his scrag of hair as if hoping to pull his conversation out of his scalp and barely able to say whether he'd like still or sparkling water (\"I, I, I, errrr, I...\"). But he soon becomes easy and light, with a childlike smile. Like his drawings - and his movies - there is an awkward, slightly nervy outer coating that belies a sweet, gentle centre.\n\nThese biographical readings of his work slightly unnerve him at first. He insists with a friendly laugh, which contradicts his morose appearance, that his self-portraits merely reflect \"the limitations of my drawing style\". But he later concedes that \"certain images and feelings stay inside of you all your life. You think you've worked through them, but you don't, really. You just keep drawing something for a long time and it becomes part of you. Just when you've reached a new plateau in your life, it mysteriously comes again. Luckily, I guess.\"\n\nBurton is a rare modern American director whose style is sharply defined and instantly recognisable. \"Cartoonish\" is a common, if not really fair, description, referring to the high stylisation of the sets, the caperish element of his characters and the noirish tinge to his comedy. Even his big-budget movies, such as Batman, bear his palpable mark, and it remains one beloved of audiences and critics: the films that stray furthest from it, such as Planet of the Apes and Big Fish, were his least well-received.\n\nUndoubtedly, his stylistic consistency owes much to his wonderfully weird sketches for his films. He used to storyboard his entire movies, shot by shot, but now really uses them more for himself: \"They help me think more than anything else. They calm me down and, also, they're a way for me to think subconsciously. I prefer to act out of my subconscious - I find if I think too much, I start to confuse myself again.\" As if to confirm this, he makes another grab at his hair. They are also, he says, a way for him to get a measure of his crew: \"It's like a test, you know? Working out who isn't intimidated by a crude drawing, or competitive about it. It helps me to see whether I'm dealing with an intuitive person or a literal-minded person, you know what I mean?\"\n\nBurton was born and raised in Burbank, California, a suburban enclave of southern California which he later depicted in Edward Scissorhands, probably the most autobiographical of his films. He was, predictably, a very introverted child, spending much of his time watching horror movies and scaring the boy next door by telling him that aliens had landed. One thing he did love, though, was drawing. \"Every kid likes to draw, but what happens is it gets beaten out of you, you know? That happened to me - 'This is not good', 'You have to draw like this'. But then I was lucky enough to have two teachers who just said to me, 'Draw however you feel like.' It was a totally mind-blowing experience for me and I've never had another moment like that, truthfully. But a big part is not caring what other people think of them. That's why I enjoy it more now that I don't have to do it for a living. It's like, there's no pressure. Nobody has to like them.\"\n\nWe look through sketches for his earlier films together, which he surprises himself by enjoying after initially hiding his eyes from them. I ask if he will draw a picture of his original image of Willy Wonka and, encouraged by his pleasure in the earlier drawings, he eagerly agrees, quickly sketching out a simple line figure that, true to form, bears a distinct resemblance to its artist. Thinking this would be the natural next step, I ask him to draw a portrait of himself, seeing as he seems to have been doing it all his life. Yet he literally jumps backwards into the couch and draws his legs underneath him, as if trying to disappear his ebony figure into the ivory upholstery: \"No, no, no, nooooooo. That's the thing, people say...\" he starts nervously, before giving it up and trying again. \"Like, I know that people say Scissorhands is slightly biographical but if I think about it too closely I get freaked out. It's weird; I need to feel connected but also distanced. That's why I don't write a lot.\"\n\nAnd drawing yourself would collapse that distance, I ask. He nods vigorously, with an embarrassed schoolboy grin, his knuckles in front of his mouth. Well, I say, how about if you draw Helena Bonham Carter (his long-term partner)? He laughs delightedly, and uncurls his long spiderish body. \"Nahhh, she gets upset when I draw her.\" His hands hover above the pad of paper, clearly tempted, but weighing up the domestic repercussions. \"Nah, nah, she'll get angry.\" And he diligently puts the pen down. When I suggest that his original drawings for Lydia, the daughter in Beetlejuice played by Winona Ryder, looks like a combination of Burton and Bonham Carter, despite having drawn it long before he met the latter, he laughs again. \"Huh, that's really interesting...\" he trails off, gazing at the sketch.\n\nBurton originally trained as an animator, winning a scholarship to California Institute of Arts in 1976, with a programme founded by Disney to train prospective animators. He was picked at the end of his third year to join Disney and, in 1979, headed off to work on the saccharine The Fox and the Hound, and became \"probably the most depressed I've ever been in my life. I can still feel myself drawing all those little foxes. A fucking nightmare.\" He became \"a mess, a total mess\", often spending the whole day hiding in a cupboard and the other half perfecting the art of sleeping sitting up at his desk, presumably looking somewhere between a tortured genius and a madman. Incredibly, someone at Disney perceived the former and he was given money to make a stop-motion film of his story, Vincent, the tale of a disturbed little boy obsessed with Vincent Price and Edgar Allan Poe, as Burton himself had been. This led on to more small films, such as Frankenweenie (the story of a little boy who brings his dog back to life), and eventually, in 1985, to his first full-length feature, the supremely surreal Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.\n\nJust as his style of drawing has changed little over the course of his career, so his films show marked consistencies and almost always involve a mix of the following: an odd-looking, misunderstood outsider; a girl who can perceive the sensitive soul; stylised sets; winter; Danny Elfman music; Johnny Depp. Even certain images recur - the raggedy wooden roof of Charlie Bucket's house through which he gazes at the chocolate factory is an obvious echo of that of Edward Scissorhands' crumbling mansion, which he made over 15 years ago.\n\nAs for Depp, his quasi-muse, Burton has been the actor's saviour, helping him to make the nigh impossible transition from teen heartthrob to arthouse actor when he cast him as the eponymous Edward Scissorhands. Depp has since starred in three more Burton films - Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, always playing the Burton doppelgänger of befuddled outsider. \"I knew right from the beginning that Johnny got it. Yes, he looks the way he looks, but as a person he's much more like these other characters, and that's what I love about him. The worse you make him look, the better he feels, which is not what the studios want to hear but it makes him happy.\"\n\nAs for the repeated use of winter in his movies, Burton laughs: \"I was also wondering about that the other day! But I think, if you come from southern California, where there are no seasons, in movies you get to create your own weather, so you do things you were deprived of in your own life. When you see people who have spent too much time in LA where it's always pleasant,\" he says, with palpable distaste, \"it does weird things to you as a person\". Burton now lives in London with Bonham Carter and their baby son, born in 2003. His favourite thing about the city? \"Everything.\" Like what? \"Well, the weather...\"\n\nHe notably slips into the second person when discussing the biographical connections between himself and his movies: Edward Scissorhands, for example, the story of a man-made boy with scissors for fingers who is adopted by a suburban family, \"was based on a feeling of touching and communication, and I, I, I've gotten better at all that, but if you're lonely, you can grow up and have 20 million friends and be Mr Touchy-Feely\" - he taps his own shoulder to demonstrate before instinctively recoiling from himself - \"but you still have that feeling because it doesn't leave you. So I think it's those things you think you're exorcising, but you don't, really.\" This, he concedes, is why almost all of his movies focus on a lonely male outsider, whether it's the mysterious Bruce Wayne in Batman or the undead Beetlejuice: \"Some feelings never leave you,\" he says simply.\n\nWith Willy Wonka, he adds another of these characters to his collection. Depp plays the chocolatier by reprising the wide-eyed eagerness of Ed Wood and adding a heavy slick of Michael Jackson-like weird childishness. Burton giggles at the media's comparison with the beleaguered pop star, insisting with the kind of exaggerated innocence with which Depp plays Wonka that \"we never actually talked about that, ever\". Instead, he says, he wanted to show how \"there is that weird thing about people who are really good in one area but are completely deficient losers in every other aspect of their lives, which is certainly something I can relate to.\"\n\nInterestingly, he almost always gives his protagonists a backstory, explaining their strangeness: Edward Scissorhands was left an orphan when his creator died; Bruce Wayne saw his parents killed, and so on. One of the biggest changes he has made to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is that he does the same with Wonka, via flashbacks to his childhood - \"as otherwise he's just an eccentric character\". But as to the reasons for his own awkwardness, he just shrugs.\n\nYet these explanatory back stories have provoked the most common criticism of his more recent films - that they are becoming more sentimental. The most obvious example was the not wholly successful Big Fish, in which Billy Crudup hears his father's exaggeratedly fabricated tales of his boyhood; the story of Willy Wonka's deprived youth, and its happy resolution, will add further weight to the charge. They differ strongly from the more pungent, bittersweet endings of his earlier films, particularly Scissorhands which ends with Edward in isolation, or Ed Wood, in which the characters are merrily oblivious to their imminent unhappy fates. Burton agrees that the mood of his films has changed recently and he puts this down to his parents' recent deaths: \"Even though I wasn't that close to them, it obviously has a huge effect on your life. I was shocked at how much I was affected,\" he says, nervously jiggling his foot. As for whether becoming a father has changed him, he relaxes and says with a happy, if somewhat baffled grin that he's \"still in shock about that one. I don't really know what effect that will have on me yet.\"\n\nPossibly this change in tone also comes from his own current happiness. He is obviously very content with Bonham Carter, smiling whenever he mentions her name, and is similarly besotted with living in London: \"I always felt like a foreigner from the beginning of life so when I actually became one, I felt more at home.\" Like your position was confirmed? \"Exactly! It's liberating. If you were always put on the outside, it's very comfortable to end up there.\" Is this why his outsiders increasingly end up assimilated into a family, I ask, with a slight worry that his fortunate domestic situation will alter his films irrevocably. But my concerns are misplaced: \"That's just a fantasy in those movies,\" he says. \"To have the sad parts in movies can be good as well. That's the beauty of life - the sadness, too.\" And he gives a bright smile, delighted at the thought."
