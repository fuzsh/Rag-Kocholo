        "text": "The legendary Vincent Price had a prolific career. With over 200 credits in film and television that spanned all genres, Price also appeared on stage and radio. He was an avid art collector and food connoisseur, too- he even taught Elvira how to cook fish in the dishwasher. Above all, though, Vincent Price was and is a horror icon.\n\nWhile there’s never a bad time to dig into Price’s horror filmography, the Halloween season is an especially great period to revisit some of the horror films that solidified the actor’s rank as one of the best horror icons of all time. If you don’t know where to begin, we’ve got you covered.\n\nHere are some essential Vincent Price horror movies and short films to add to your Halloween watchlists.\n\nHouse of Wax (1953)\n\nOne of the biggest hits of 1953, this was the horror film that revitalized Price’s career. Especially in horror. His turn as lead Professor Henry Jarrod, a wax museum owner turned vengeance seeker, caused him to become high in demand for similarly fiendish villain roles. Andre DeToth’s film is a classic through and through, with or without 3D, but it’s an absolute highlight in Price’s horror career.\n\nThe Fly (1958)\n\nA horror classic. The plot follows scientist Andre Delambre (David Hedison), who has a horrific accident when a fly enters his experimental matter transporter device. While the film initially indicates his murder, with his wife to blame, it backtracks to explain what really happened thanks to the craftiness of Andre’s brother François, played by Price. His character returns in the sequel as well, Return of the Fly.\n\nHouse on Haunted Hill (1959)\n\nI suppose if you only have time to watch one of these movies, make it this one. It’s the 60th anniversary of the film’s release, after all. Price plays Frederick Loren, an eccentric millionaire who invites five people to his wife’s birthday party set at a haunted mansion. If the guests stay the entire night, he’ll give them $10,000. Directed by William Castle, king of the gimmick, the film is known for its promotion of “Emergo,” a pulley system installed in theaters that allowed a skeleton to float above the audience. But it’s a great movie on its own merit.\n\nThe Last Man on Earth (1964)\n\nThere have been many adaptations of Richard Matheson’s I Am Legend throughout the decades, and this one is among the absolute best. Price stars as Dr. Robert Morgan, a scientist and reluctant vampire hunter. As the title indicates, he’s the last man on Earth after a mysterious plague has turned humanity into zombie-like vampires. While there are deviations from the novel, it’s still a solid adaptation with Price turning in a fantastic performance as the sole survivor coping with the despair and terror.\n\nThe Masque of the Red Death (1964)\n\nPrice was a prominent fixture during Roger Corman’s Edgar Allan Poe cycle, which kicked off with the popular House of Usher. Any one of them would make for a great pick, but Corman felt “The Masque of the Red Death” was one of Poe’s best short stories. It’s also arguably the best of Corman’s Poe films. Atmospheric and twisted, this film lets Price loose as Prince Prospero, a particularly cruel ruler and Satanist. He gleefully terrorizes his peasants, and leaves them to die when a mysterious plague sweeps the land. Instead, he uses his castle as a fortress to block out the plague.\n\nWitchfinder General (1968)\n\nOf all the films on this list, Witchfinder General is the most unnerving. It’s Price at his most terrifying; there’s not a trace of camp to be found in his turn as Matthew Hopkins, an English witch-hunter that takes advantage of his position to terrorize villages. He wasn’t director Michael Reeves’ choice for the role therefore production was rife with tension between them, but it resulted in a deadly serious performance that Price considered one of his all time best. He’s absolutely correct in that assessment.\n\nThe Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971)\n\nPrice plays the titular Dr. Phibes, a famous concert organist thought to have died in a car crash. He’d been racing home after learning his wife died during surgery. He survived the crash, but was left horribly disfigured. He subsequently crafts an elaborate plan of revenge upon his wife’s surgeons. A setup that sounds far more serious than it actually is; Dr. Phibes is a tongue in cheek horror-comedy. Heavily stylized but with gleefully elaborate deaths and Price scene-chewing like a pro. It’s great.\n\nThe Monster Club (1981)\n\nThis musical horror anthology directed by Roy Ward Baker stars Price as Eramus. Eramus is a starving vampire who feeds off of an author (John Carradine) he meets on the street. In return for the snack, he invites the author to a Monster Club, a gathering place for all supernatural creatures, and tells him three tales of terror. Featuring no shortage of horror vets, like Donald Pleasence, this anthology has something for everyone. Most of all it has a catchy soundtrack, fun visuals, and Price having a ball.\n\nVincent (1982)\n\nTim Burton’s stop-motion animation film is the poem/story of young Vincent Malloy, who annoys his mother with macabre dreams of being just like Vincent Price. Price, a lifelong inspiration to Burton, narrates. This short forged the working relationship that caused Price to later appear in Edward Scissorhands, but that film is best suited for winter viewing.\n\nMichael Jackson’s Thriller (1983)\n\nDirected by John Landis, this 13-minute music video for “Thriller” sees the popstar on a date to the movies. It’s all fun and romance until a horde of zombies show up. Price doesn’t appear, but he does lend his recognizable voice to the rap interlude that ends with his maniacal laugh. Short, sweet, and memorable. A fun-sized Halloween treat.\n\nWhile Scream set off a new slasher cycle in the late 1990s, MGM delivered something different with Disturbing Behavior. A fitting choice considering the film’s themes. Ultimately, though, this ‘98 teen chiller landed a bit more in the science-fiction bin than straight, undiluted horror; one by one, a town’s troubled youths endure sinister, personality-warping makeovers to make them better fit into society. That sort of genre pitch, when coupled with up-and-coming young actors like Katie Holmes and James Marsden, should have been enough to draw in the target demo. Yet the studio and the director, David Nutter, didn’t see eye to eye on things, resulting in one of the most troubled horror productions of that decade.\n\nScott Rosenberg’s screenplay for Disturbing Behavior was written a few years before Scream was released, and it was nearly produced by New Line Cinema before plans changed. Luckily for Rosenberg, he was allowed to shop his work around elsewhere. Once the project was picked up by MGM, Nutter then signed on after having mainly worked in television and only having one feature to his name; he directed a good deal of episodes during the early seasons of The X-Files. That greater part of his résumé likely landed him Disturbing Behavior. After all, the producers wanted the film to be like “X-Files for teenagers.”\n\nDespite comparisons to The Stepford Wives, this youth-oriented reimagining does not have its characters being replaced by robots. On the contrary, the pubescent prey of a Northwestern town’s nefarious scheme are simply “upgraded.” Bruce Greenwood’s creepy character, a visiting school psychologist named Dr. Caldicott, is the mastermind behind the teenagers’ tinkering. His unique process involves the “regulation of endocrinologic surges;” unlike the film, John Whitman’s tie-in novelization brings up the doctor’s scientific methodology in slightly more detail. In fact, a small but not insignificant amount of what MGM left on the cutting room floor can be found in this literary companion.\n\nAs it is now known, Disturbing Behavior experienced a brutal hack job prior to its theatrical release (and tanking). Negative remarks during test audience screenings spurred edits, much to the chagrin of Nutter. However, when the first set of changes did not produce a higher score at a subsequent test screening, the frustrated and desperate MGM took over and had the studio’s then vice president of production editing, George Folsey Jr., handle the final revision. What had already been cut down to a 95-minute film was then reduced to a 75-minute (minus credits) shell of Nutter’s vision. The outspoken director blamed much of the film’s failure on MGM’s former president Michael Nathanson along with his reliance on research from the National Research Group (NRG). Nutter thought the requested edits he made himself were valid, yet he found “MGM’s didn’t make sense at all.”\n\nCircling back to the novelization, Disturbing Behavior’s biggest excision involved the protagonist of Steve Clark (Marsden) and his dead older brother, Allen (played by Ethan Embry on screen). This YA-sized book, which runs a tad under 190 pages with a photo section included, does not gloss over the distressing particulars of Allen’s death. Whereas the theatrical cut of the film momentarily mentions the origin of Steve’s dejection as well as the motivation for his perseverance. Test audiences did not like the fuller, tragic backstory of Allen, who died of suicide (along with his girlfriend), so Nutter pared down that narrative element to its most key parts. In doing so, though, Steve lost a fair share of his character arc. Even Rachel’s (Holmes) own vocal aspirations to get out of Cradle Bay, escape poverty, and go to college had been muted in favor of a more streamlined, commercial film.\n\nNutter told Fangoria back in 1998: “If you build it, they will come.” The “it” the director was referring to, of course, being a smart teen horror film. “You have to respect their intelligence, and they’ll respect you.” Sadly, MGM was on a different page. The studio did not seem too concerned by the watering down of the film’s characters and story, seeing as it just wanted a “Scream-style teen shocker” and for Nutter to get straight to the “fright beats.”\n\nIn the end, Disturbing Behavior comes out looking like an expensive episode of The X-Files. Having been shot in Vancouver and sharing actors and crew only reinforces that opinion. Even so, it remains a fairly attractive and nostalgic piece of late ’90s horror. No amount of overediting can erase that. Marsden, Holmes, and their co-stars, particularly Nick Stahl, also speak the punchy, stylized dialogue with “razor” credibility. And the brainwashed victims steal the show here, with their “hard-on” glitch fits coming across as more menacing and unsettling after being juxtaposed with clean-cut presentations.\n\nThere is no mistaking the cautionary tale quality to this film. The concept of a society suppressing people’s individuality is timeless, as is the danger of conforming. Yet as Disturbing Behavior demonstrates with jarring effect, controlling identity and limiting freedom has its adverse consequences. So while the thematic material here is executed in the most unsubtle manner, it still serves as an important lesson for every generation.\n\nNutter has since described his first major feature as the “worst experience” of his life; back then he was even tempted to remove his name from the project. Nutter’s negative reaction to the studio interference is certainly valid, yet what survived is still rather watchable and entertaining. And supplementing the theatrical cut are unofficial restorations with some deleted footage reinserted. This includes the original conclusion that test audiences disliked — on account of Stahl’s character’s fate — and the whole messy story of Steven’s brother’s death. Nevertheless, cult fans of Disturbing Behavior would still prefer a bona fide director’s cut. One that not only gives the film a better semblance of what Nutter envisioned pre-MGM’s meddling, but also helps redeem it after years of harsh criticism."
