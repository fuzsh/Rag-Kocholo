        "text": "We've all heard actors reflect on the awkward nature of on-screen romance. The choreographed scenes are very unnatural and never allow for realistic passion to play out. But sometimes actors are paired with a co-star whose sweet kisses fill their hearts with butterflies. Outside of A-list dating apps like Raya, on-set couplings are the perfect place for busy celebs to find love.\n\nAngelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton met on the set of the 1999 movie \"Pushing Tin,\" quickly got married, and even carried around vials of each other's blood. Where else would she have met someone of her celebrity status, who could also get down with her bizarre way of expressing love? Some celebrities have a track record of dating whoever they lock lips with on-screen, and others are ready to get married after the first audition. This is a list of famous co-stars whose on-camera kissing led to big romance.\n\nMila Kunis grew up on the small screen, playing Jackie Burkhart on the Fox hit sitcom \"That '70s Show.\" For eight seasons audiences enjoyed watching Kunis' overbearing, mouthy character gripe at her dimwitted boyfriend, Michael Kelso, played by Ashton Kutcher. Unbeknownst to fans of the show, Kunis' on-screen kisses with Kutcher were her first kisses in real life. Talking to People in 2001, Kunis reflected on the moment she realized she'd have to kiss Kutcher. \"I was like, 'Oh, he's so cute, it's the Calvin Klein model!'\" Kunis recalled. \"Then I was like, 'I have to kiss him?'\"\n\nKutcher had no idea he was her first kiss, but their on-screen chemistry made a decades-long lasting impression. Kunis ended her relationship with \"Home Alone\" star Macaulay Culkin in 2011. That same year Kutcher separated from '90s screen siren Demi Moore, whose 16-year age gap caused quite a stir in the tabloids. Kunis and Kutcher soon started hanging out and hooking up, much like their characters in \"No Strings Attached\" and \"Friends With Benefits.\" But, much like their movie characters, their connection was undeniable and the couple married in 2015. They have two children, daughter Wyatt Isabelle and son Dimitri Portwood.\n\nIn 2010 rapper Snoop Dogg made the song \"Oh Sookie,\" a tongue-in-cheek ode to Sookie Stackhouse, the main character on HBO's vampire drama, \"True Blood.\" The video features clips of the Southern bombshell, played by Anna Paquin, and several Sookie lookalikes. The series was a wildly popular hit for the network, racking up millions of viewers. Fans were enamored with Sookie's sweet sensuality, which also seemed to capture the heart of her co-star Stephen Moyer.\n\nFrom the moment the two actors met for their chemistry read, the English actor was taken with Paquin. Moyer's character — the sensitive vampire Bill Compton — agonized over his love for Sookie, which was in direct contrast to his fate in the underworld. But in real life, Moyer and Paquin's relationship flourished. The couple married in 2010 and welcomed twins Poppy and Charlie in 2012. They also co-produced the Amazon original series \"Flack,\" where Paquin plays a tortured publicist.\n\nHandsome German/Irish movie star Michael Fassbender has a history of hooking up with his co-stars. After playing a struggling sex addict in the 2011 indie flick \"Shame,\" Fassbender briefly dated co-star Nicole Beharie. He also dated Zoë Kravitz after they starred in the comic book movie \"X-Men: First Class.\" But when he worked opposite Swedish beauty Alicia Vikander, on the tragic 2016 film \"The Light Between Oceans,\" he was so smitten his serial dating came to a halt.\n\nOnce a classically trained ballet dancer, Vikander gained acting notoriety playing Ava in the offbeat sci-fi movie \"Ex Machina.\" In 2016 she won an Oscar for her supporting role in \"The Danish Girl.\" That same year Fassbender was nominated for his leading role in \"Steve Jobs.\" While this powerful acting duo keep their romance on the lowdown, a few shots of their secret 2017 wedding in Ibiza did pop up on the internet. In 2021, they welcomed a son together.\n\nNBC was known in the 1980s for family hits like \"The Cosby Show,\" \"Gimme a Break!,\" and \"Silver Spoons.\" \"Family Ties\" was ranked high among the network's top shows, thanks to breakout star Michael J. Fox. The Canadian-born actor played charming overachiever Alex P. Keaton, the oddball offspring of his ex-hippie parents Steven and Elyse Keaton. Alex's conservative morals never aligned with his liberal New England family, or the many women he dated in college. Tracy Pollan played one of these women for several seasons, and the encounter proved to be life-changing.\n\nAs Ellen Reed, Pollan's character was initially turned off by Alex. But in one iconic scene, the actors kissed while dancing to Billy Vera's bittersweet song \"At This Moment.\" The song became a #1 hit and audiences wondered what would become of the obvious chemistry between Pollan and Fox. Pollan was in a relationship with Kevin Bacon, while Fox was tied to \"Facts of Life\" star Nancy McKeon. His career was also off the charts with the hit movies \"Back to the Future\" and \"Teen Wolf.\" The actors reconnected in the gritty drama \"Bright Lights, Big City\" and married a year later, in 1988. They had their first child in 1989, and Fox was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease a few years later. Pollan has been by Fox's side through his struggles with the disease, and the couple has welcomed three more children.\n\nAfter starring roles in the high-impact films \"Avatar\" and \"Colombiana,\" Zoe Saldana was eager for more action films to come her way. The role of Dora Jansen in the 2012 mystery \"The Words\" was the total opposite of this desire. \"I wanted to shoot guns,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012. But she soon connected with the role, with the help of co-star Bradley Cooper. Playing a writer who steals another's work to become famous, Cooper's character was charismatic, but afflicted by his secret. As his wife, Saldana's character was supportive, but no-nonsense, and their chemistry jumped off the screen.\n\nCooper's dreamy looks and star power appeal have seen him linked to several A-list actresses, including Jennifer Lopez, Renee Zellweger, and a brief marriage to Jennifer Esposito. He and Saldana were attached for a year, after she split with her fiancè Keith Britton, but Saldana quickly moved on from the relationship. Unlike normal break-ups, Tinseltown romances come with some post-breakup tension: the actors had to awkwardly put their talented chops to use on the red carpet as they promoted \"The Words.\" Saldana eventually married Italian artist Marco Perego in 2013 and the couple have three boys, Zen, Cy, and Bowie. After several short-lived romances, Cooper got serious with model Irina Shayk and welcomed daughter Lea De Seine in 2017. The pair separated in 2019.\n\nRyan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are Canadian actors who seemed destined to meet. They were both born in London, Ontario, but took different paths to success. Gosling became a child actor on the revival of the Disney Channel's \"The Mickey Mouse Club,\" where he sang and danced with fellow Mouseketeers — and future stars — Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera. McAdams studied theatre at York University and made her Hollywood debut in the 2002 comedy \"The Hot Chick.\" The striking beauty was paired with the alluring actor for 2004's \"The Notebook,\" an adaptation of the Nicholas Sparks best-selling novel. The movie was an instant hit, among the most successful of Sparks' adaptations, thanks to the explosive chemistry between Gosling and McAdams.\n\nPlaying conflicted lovers Noah and Allie, the pair had a hard time finding their romantic rhythm. Talking to VH1 in 2014, director Nick Cassavetes revealed that Gosling wanted to work with a different actress. Their fiery on-screen love soon crossed into real life and the couple went public with their romance. They even re-enacted one of their famous kissing scenes from the movie at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. But their demanding schedules got the best of their love, and the couple parted ways in 2007. Gosling has been involved with actress Eva Mendes since 2011; they have two daughters. McAdams has been with screenwriter Jamie Linden for several years, with whom she has a son.\n\nIn the eyes of many fans, they've won the award for Hollywood's sexiest couple, but Nicole Ari Parker and Boris Kodjoe are also one of the town's most dedicated couples. Married for over 15 years, the powerful twosome has been able to maintain a family, successful careers, and a strong partnership under the stressful glare of fame. They met on the set of Showtime's early 2000s series \"Soul Food,\" based on the 1997 film of the same name. For five seasons they played on-again-off-again couple Teri Joseph and Damon Carter. Though their characters weren't always certain they should be together, their off-screen romance was solid.\n\nWhen Kodjoe suggested they live together, Parker knew he was the guy for her. They married in 2005 and quickly welcomed a son and daughter. In 2015 the couple briefly hosted a daytime talk show where they interviewed several celebs, including Zendaya and Regina Hall. Like so many Hollywood couples, rumors of marital troubles swirled in 2020 over comments Parker made about missing the single life. But Parker was just sharing an honest moment with fans, and the couple is still going strong.\n\nGinnifer Goodwin's career has seen her often play the girl who had a hard time getting the guy. In \"Mona Lisa Smile\" and \"He's Just Not That Into You,\" she put all her cards on the table for guys who weren't certain to reciprocate her feelings. In 2011's \"Something Borrowed\" she fell for her best friend's fiancée, and on the HBO series \"Big Love\" she shared a husband with two other women. But on the ABC series \"Once Upon a Time\" she played Snow White and finally got Prince Charming — literally.\n\nJosh Dallas played Prince Charming on the show and swept Goodwin off her feet in real life. An early date at Disneyland solidified marriage for Goodwin, before they were even seriously involved. Sparks were flying behind the scenes and the couple went public at the 2012 White House Correspondents Dinner. The pair married in 2014 and quickly welcomed sons Oliver and Hugo. Until recently, Dallas starred on the NBC fantasy drama \"Manifest\", while Goodwin appeared on the CBS show \"Why Women Kill.\" When Dallas is away filming he likes to send Goodwin flowers and FaceTime with her as much as possible.\n\nThere were so many twists and turns on the scandalous ABC drama \"Revenge.\" Emily VanCamp played Emily Thorne, a young woman who inserts herself into the lives of a wealthy Hamptons family to get revenge for her father's death. She uses the romantic interests of their son, Daniel Grayson (Josh Bowman), to uncover their dirty secrets. It was quite a different role for VanCamp, who is also known as the heroic Sharon Carter/Agent 13 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" and \"Captain America: Civil War.\"\n\nThough her \"Revenge\" character's intentions were fake, there was nothing fake about the romance that was blossoming off-screen between VanCamp and Bowman. They attempted to keep their budding relationship private, but the paparazzi caught them engaging in heavy PDA all over LA. VanCamp announced their engagement in a cute Instagram post and they wed in the Bahamas in 2018. Three years later, VanCamp gave birth to their first daughter.\n\nJennifer Lopez was a movie star, pop sensation, and married woman when she met Ben Affleck on the set of \"Gigli.\" The movie was notoriously panned by the critics, with Affleck's lack of on-screen chemistry with Lopez at the center of much of the criticism. But the pair didn't let the negativity stop them from working together again. They played husband and wife in the film \"Jersey Girl,\" and went public as a couple once Lopez separated from her choreographer husband Chris Judd.\n\nAffleck appeared in Lopez's video for the song \"Jenny from the Block,\" where they acted out much of the tabloid fodder and lack of privacy they were experiencing in real life. Lopez wrote a love song called \"Dear Ben\" for her album This Is Me...Then. The couple became such a sensation they were labeled with the merged name \"Bennifer.\" In 2002 Lopez showed off the blingy pink diamond engagement ring Affleck gave her. The 6.1-carat Harry Winston jewel cost a whopping $2.5 million. But all that glitters isn't gold, and a year later the couple called off their wedding. Lopez married singer Marc Anthony in 2004, and had twins Max and Emme. They divorced in 2011. Affleck married actress Jennifer Garner in 2005. They have three children together, but divorced in 2018.\n\nBut somehow, Bennifer returned. The two started dating again in 2021, and were married the following year. If that's not a rom-com waiting to happen, we don't know what is.\n\nA 2016 Vanity Fair article lays out the details of Nicole Kidman's first encounter with Tom Cruise, when she auditioned for a supporting role in the 1990 movie \"Days of Thunder.\" \"I walked into the [audition], and [Tom] was the one that stood up and shook my hand. And I just remember ... electricity going through me,\" she recalled. In the movie, Kidman played a doctor sent to check out the vitals of Cruise's chaotic race car driver character. Whatever Kidman felt in her audition translated on screen, as their scenes were purely electric. Not long after the movie wrapped the couple quickly married.\n\nCruise was a bona fide superstar at the time of their marriage, and Kidman had some catching up to do. But after they wed, Kidman threw herself into motherhood with the adoptions of Isabella in 1992 and Connor in 1994. When the couple appeared in Stanley Kubrick's 1999 psychological drama \"Eyes Wide Shut,\" audiences speculated about whether the on-screen couple's marriage issues mirrored Kidman and Cruise's real life. Cruise and their children became more involved in Scientology and Kidman never joined them. The couple split in 2001, after 11 years of marriage. Cruise was briefly married to actress Katie Holmes, and had a daughter named Suri. They divorced in 2012. Kidman, meanwhile, became an A-list actress, with an Academy Award under her belt. In 2012, she married country crooner — and fellow Aussie — Keith Urban, with whom she has two children.\n\nJohnny Depp was a teen heartthrob, fresh off his starring role on the series \"21 Jump Street.\" Winona Ryder was the poster girl for the cool \"alternative\" '90s. The stars aligned when the two met at the premiere of the 1989 movie \"Great Balls of Fire.\" Depp locked eyes with the teen starlet, comparing the moment to when Tony and Maria meet in \"West Side Story.\" Depp made a big impression on Ryder, being her first in several categories. They got engaged after only five months of dating and Depp famously got a tattoo that said \"Winona Forever.\"\n\nDepp and Ryder starred in the quirky film \"Edward Scissorhands\" as love interests who are ultimately pulled apart. Life imitated art for the couple who parted ways after four years. After the split Depp changed his famous tattoo to \"Wino Forever.\" Recently, Ryder testified on Depp's behalf during his alleged abuse trial against ex-wife Amber Heard. On the witness stand, Ryder stated, \"I truly and honestly only know him as a really good man — an incredibly loving, extremely caring guy who was so very protective of me and the people that he loves, and I felt so very, very safe with him.\"\n\nBoth Kit Harington and Rose Leslie landed the biggest roles of their careers to date when they were cast on HBO's blockbuster fantasy epic \"Game of Thrones.\" Harington played Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and illegitimate heir of the House of Stark, while Leslie portrayed Ygritte, one of the Free Folk who lived beyond The Wall. The two found each other and it wasn't long before romance followed (along with a number of steamy only-on-HBO scenes), despite living amidst near-constant war, darkness, and ice.\n\nJon Snow and Ygritte got together for a kiss and so much more in Season 2 of \"Game of Thrones,\" which ended when the latter character was killed off. Off-screen, meanwhile, Harington and Leslie low-key saw each other in a non-professional way, confirming they were dating with a red carpet arrival at an English awards ceremony in 2016, according to People, about four years after their initial on-screen coupling. In 2017, Harington proposed, and the former kissing coworkers were married the following year. They now have two children together.\n\nOver the original seven-season run of the WB/CW small-town dramedy \"Gilmore Girls,\" the younger of the two Gilmore girls, Rory, experienced three formative romances. Before she dated rich kid Logan (Matt Czuchry) and after she grew tired of high school boyfriend Dean (Jared Padalecki), Rory (Alexis Bledel) grew enchanted with Jess Marino, the new kid in town, a rebellious and brooding writer and voracious reader, and the nephew of Luke, the would-be love interest of Rory's mother. Of the three actors who played her boyfriends in that succession of intense relationships, the only one that Bledel would publicly date was Milo Ventimiglia, the guy who played Jess.\n\nWhile Rory and Jess' time together was passionate, it was also spotty. Not so for the off-screen pairing of Bledel and Ventimiglia. According to US Weekly, the coupling began in 2002, right around the time that Ventimiglia joined the cast of \"Gilmore Girls.\" The duo split up in 2006, not long after Ventimiglia left the show.\n\nA few years later, Bledel would once again fall, in real life, for her on-screen love interest. According to People, she met Vincent Kartheiser in 2012, when she landed a guest arc alongside him on \"Mad Men\" as Beth Dawes, a woman with whom his character, Pete Campbell, enjoys a raucous extramarital affair. They married in 2014, welcomed a son in 2015, and divorced in 2022.\n\nYears before the \"Deadpool\" movies made him a beloved action hero and comic star simultaneously, Ryan Reynolds' big superhero turn was supposed to be \"Green Lantern.\" A big-screen jaunt for the interstellar DC Comics character, \"Green Lantern\" put up less-than-blockbuster box office in the summer of 2011, earned dismal critical reviews, and prevented Reynolds from ascending to the A-list for a while. The silver lining: Making \"Green Lantern\" is where he met the woman who would become his wife.\n\nReynolds portrayed the central Lantern of Earth, Hal Jordan, while Blake Lively, in the midst of a star-making turn on the popular teen soap \"Gossip Girl,\" landed the role of Hal's love interest, Carol Ferris. Their scenes together, which included plenty of kissing, were surprisingly intimate for an effects-heavy comic book movie, so it's not too shocking that these two actors later connected off the set. Shortly after filming, according to Glamour, Reynolds divorced Scarlett Johansson, Lively broke up with \"Gossip Girl\" costar Penn Badgley, and in late 2011, photographers spotted the couple together. They'd marry in September of the following year, and the couple now shares four children.\n\n\"Dream House\" was a minor movie that starred two major actors. The abysmally reviewed, middlingly successful horror movie about a couple who purchase a beautiful home only to find out that it's a murder house, featured Daniel Craig, best known for portraying James Bond for more than a decade, and Rachel Weisz of \"The Mummy\" franchise, an Academy Award winner for \"The Constant Gardener.\"\n\nCraig and Weisz shot their scenes as a happily married (at first) couple in 2010, and the real attraction was palpable in their work. \"They play husband and wife, so anytime that the camera was rolling you felt that spark,\" co-star Rachel Fox told Us Weekly. According to Express, both actors denied media speculation that they were in a relationship, right around the time that TMZ reported that Weisz had broken things off with her fiancée, filmmaker Darren Aronofsky, and when Craig ended his relationship with Satsuki Mitchell. In mid-2011, Craig and Weisz got married in New York. They had their first child together in 2018.\n\nWhen it comes to on-set romances, few are as high profile or as combative as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The pair reportedly fell for each other while both were starring in the 2004 action romance \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\" and while Pitt was married to another major star, Jennifer Aniston. From there, the \"Brangelina\" juggernaut picked up speed: Pitt and Aniston were divorced in 2005, one year before Jolie announced that she was pregnant with Pitt's child. The actor was already en route to becoming the adopted father of Jolie's children, Maddox and Zahara; daughter Shiloh followed in 2006, and twins Knox and Vivienne in 2008, in addition to the couple adopting their son Pax in 2007.\n\nAfter seven years together, Pitt and Jolie decided to marry in 2014, but the happiness soon came to an end. Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, citing irreconcilable differences; tabloid coverage suggested ugly allegations of verbal and physical abuse by Pitt against one of the children (the accusations were cleared by the FBI). Their divorce was finalized in 2019 but acrimony continued to brew between Pitt and Jolie, who were locked in a bruising custody battle between 2018 and 2021.\n\nDancing brought together actors Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan when they co-starred in 2006's \"Step Up.\" The film not only helped to establish the pair as stars but also served as the introduction that led to their relationship and marriage three years later on July 11, 2009. A daughter, Everly, followed in 2013 and helped to inspire Tatum to write two children's books, including the best-selling \"One and Only Sparkella\" in 2021.\n\nSadly, the couple announced their separation via a joint statement to People magazine in 2018 and divorced in November 2019. In an interview with Vanity Fair in 2023, Tatum said that the experience was difficult but ultimately necessary. \"Your life turns on this axis,\" he said. \"This whole plan that you had literally just turns to sand and goes through your fingers and you're just like, 'Oh, s***, what now?'\" But Tatum also credits the experience with forcing him to take a closer look at his own well-being. \"I don't think I would've ever done the work, I think, on myself in the way that I had to do the work on myself to really try to figure out what next,\" he explained.\n\nChances are you haven't seen the movie that brought together Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes. Though it's critically acclaimed, with a 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the 2011 drama \"The Place Beyond the Pines,\" about a motorcycle rider (Gosling) turned bank robber who crosses paths with a cop (Bradley Cooper), wasn't a box office success, netting less than $1 million on a $15 million budget. Its place in the movie history books is largely cemented by the fact that Gosling began a long-standing relationship with Mendes shortly after the film's release. Two children, daughters Esmeralda and Amada, followed in 2014 and 2016, respectively.\n\nAs a couple, they have maintained a very low public profile; Mendes wrote to a fan on Instagram (via Glamour UK), \"My man and my kids are private.\" Though they do not attend publicity or red-carpet events together, they do support each other through social media. In 2023, Mendes posted a pic of herself on Instagram wearing a shirt emblazoned with Gosling as Ken from \"Barbie.\"\n\nThe romance between Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult lasted roughly the same amount as their tenures in the \"X-Men\" movies. Hoult (\"Renfield\") first played Hank McCoy/Beast opposite Lawrence's Mystique in 2011's \"X-Men: First Class,\" which was soon followed by reports in the press that the pair had become an item. They appeared to split briefly in 2013, but reunited in 2014 — just in time to reprise their mutant roles in \"X-Men: Days of Future Past.\" And though the rekindled romance flamed out for a second and final time in 2015, they remained amicable both off-screen and on, which included three more \"X-Men\" films between 2016 and 2019.\n\nLawrence, who earned an Academy Award for \"Silver Linings Playbook\" in 2013, married art gallery director Cooke Maroney in 2019 and gave birth to their son Cy in 2022. Hoult, who recently wrapped his critically praised turn as Peter III on \"The Great,\" began a relationship with model Bryana Holly in 2017, with whom he has two children.\n\nTom Holland and Zendaya worked overtime to keep their relationship under wraps since filming began on \"Spider-Man: Homecoming.\" Reports surfaced that the actors were spending time together prior to the film's release in 2017, and while sources declared that Holland and Zendaya were an item, the actors themselves demurred, claiming that their relationship was platonic. \"I'm very glad I have a friend like her,\" said Holland to People in 2017.\n\nMedia coverage slowly told a different story, showing Holland and Zendaya attending events together and celebrating each other's birthdays in cute social media posts. A photograph of the pair sharing a PDA in 2021 killed the just-friends storyline — Holland and Zendaya eventually owned up to their relationship in individual interviews in 2023. \"I'm lucky that I have someone like Zendaya in my life,\" said Holland on the \"Smartless\" podcast, while the Emmy-winning actress praised her boyfriend's culinary skills. \"He's really good in the kitchen, which is fortune as I am really accident-prone,\" she said in an interview with The Sun.\n\nBoth \"Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon\" star Norman Reedus and Diane Kruger (\"Inglourious Basterds\") had past relationships with high-profile celebrities: Reedus was involved in a five-year relationship with model Helena Christensen, with whom he had a son prior to their split in 2003, while Kruger's romantic partners included French actor/director Guillaume Canet, who she was married to from 2001 to 2006. She also dated actor Joshua Jackson, with whom she co-starred alongside Reedus in the French-German drama \"Sky.\" Kruger and Jackson ended their decade-long relationship soon after.\n\nReedus and Kruger began to make the rounds as a couple in 2016 and were seen together at high-profile events like the 2017 U.S. Open and Golden Globes ceremony in 2018. That same year, Kruger revealed that she was pregnant that same year, and gave birth to a daughter, Nova, in late 2018. The couple announced their engagement in 2022.\n\nThe science fiction/thriller series \"Manifest\" not only introduced actors Melissa Roxburgh and J.R. Ramirez to primetime TV audiences, but also served as the launching pad for their on-and-off romance. The pair began dating while playing Detectives (and former fiancées) Michaela Stone and Jared Vasquez on \"Manifest,\" which aired for three seasons on NBC and a fourth and final season on Netflix in 2023.\n\nThe pair managed to keep their relationship under wraps for much of the show's tenure on NBC, though Page Six printed an item in 2020 that quoted a source from the set who alleged that Roxburgh and Ramirez had been dating for approximately six months. But shortly after \"Manifest\" debuted on Netflix in 2022, People showcased a slew of pics from their respective Instagram accounts that showed them getting very cozy while on what appeared to be a vacation in Fiji. Their \"Manifest\" co-star, Josh Dallas, clearly approved of their PDA, given the number of fire emojis he posted on the pics.\n\nFor some co-star couples, the news of their relationship comes through an announcement to the press or via social media. For Jacob Bertrand and Peyton List of \"Cobra Kai,\" their romance was revealed when TMZ cornered the pair at Los Angeles International Airport in 2022. Bertrand, who plays Eli \"Hawk\" Moskowitz on \"Cobra Kai,\" told TMZ that the pair had been together, albeit quietly, for some time.\n\nList and Bertrand knew each other for several years prior to \"Cobra Kai\": Both were Disney Channel performers and even co-starred in a Disney Channel original movie, \"The Swap,\" in 2016. Bertrand was also friendly with List's brother, actor Spencer List, a situation that he detailed to TMZ (via EOnline). \"That was kinda awkward to be like, 'Hey, man, I like your sister.'\" The pair have maintained a low profile since 2022, which has sparked rumors of a breakup.\n\nThough Adam Brody and Leighton Meester's relationship blossomed after co-starring in 2011's \"The Oranges,\" the TV vets actually knew each other for several years prior to filming. Both starred in series produced by Josh Schwartz — the \"Shazam: Fury of the Gods\" star played Seth Cohen on \"The O.C.,\" while Meester co-starred as Blair Waldorf on \"Gossip Girl\" — and the pair first met when Schwartz introduced them at Canter's, the famed Los Angeles deli. As Brody told Anna Faris on her \"Unqualified\" podcast, \"I was very attracted to her from the jump.\" But he was also seeing someone at the time.\n\nBy 2013, Brody was single, and after meeting again, the pair quickly became a couple. They were married the following year and appeared together in the 2014 film \"Life Partners.\" A daughter, Arlo Day, was born in 2015, with a son following in 2022. In addition to their individual acting careers, the couple reteamed on screen for an episode of Meester's ABC series \"Single Parents\" and in the 2023 thriller \"River Wild.\"\n\nTelling someone that they smell like marijuana may not seem like the foundation for a lasting romance, but in the case of Megan Fox and actor/musician Machine Gun Kelly, the comment – quoted in GQ and issued by her to him during a chance meeting prior to their on-set romance in 2020 — was the spark that ignited their \"twin flames,\" as the pair are given to calling each other. The real fuel for the fire came during the production of \"Midnight in the Switchgrass,\" a 2021 thriller that both refused to promote prior to release.\n\nThe couple became engaged in early 2022 — an occasion marked by both parties drinking each other's blood (\"It's just a few drops,\" said Fox to Glamour UK) — but put the nuptials on hold to deal with relationship problems until the following year. Kelly and Fox appear to be back together as of late 2023, though wedding plans appear to remain on hold.\n\nLong before they played married Soviet spies on \"The Americans,\" Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys had something of a meet-cute scenario: the two actors attended the same kickball party where, as he said on \"Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen\" (via People.com), \"I very drunkenly asked for her number.\" Flash-forward a decade and they became an award-winning on-screen duo in the FX drama and an off-screen item as well.\n\nThe Welsh-born Rhys, who most recently starred in HBO's \"Perry Mason,\" and \"Diplomat\" lead Russell started dating in 2014, shortly after her separation from husband Shane Deary, with whom she had two children. People broke the news that the couple was officially together in 2015, and their son, Sam, was born in May 2016. Russell and Rhys haven't appeared together on-screen since \"The Americans\" came to an end in 2018, but both turned up separately in Elizabeth Banks' \"Cocaine Bear\": Russell played the film's heroine, Sari, while Rhys was dispatched early as real-life drug smuggler Andrew C. Thornton, who died while parachuting from a plane laden with cocaine.\n\nRumors began to surface in the press that \"Stranger Things\" co-stars Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer were a couple back in 2016. The British-born Heaton and former child actress Dyer certainly gave enough hints through Instagram posts and paparazzi shots of the pair on dates together over the next few years. It wasn't until 2019 that Heaton and Dyer began to speak publicly about their relationship.\n\nComments at first were coy — in an interview with Us Weekly that year, Dyer said jokingly of Heaton, \"He's alright, I guess. He doesn't mess up our scenes too much!\" — but by mid-2019, she spoke openly about working with her significant other. \"We're really comfortable with each other, so we can play and feel more free, and we can talk about it before,\" she told Refinery29. Though their romance was public knowledge, both actors remained largely reluctant to discuss the details. \"Some people are very good about being open and sharing, and other people feel a little more comfortable holding some things for themselves,\" Dyer told Cosmopolitan in 2022.\n\nRami Malek made as public a declaration of affection as one could make when he announced to the audience at the 2019 Oscars while accepting the Best Actor Award that his \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" co-star, Lucy Boynton, had captured his heart. The pair met in 2017 while starring as Queen frontman Freddie Mercury and his girlfriend, Mary Austin, in the biopic; they were seen together at various public events, including the numerous award shows that honored Malek's performance as Mercury. He made their relationship public at the 2019 Palm Springs International Film Festival, where he won top acting honors for \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\" In his acceptance speech, Malek said of Boynton, \"You have been my ally, my confidant, you are my love.\"\n\nThe couple remained together well into 2020, making appearances at high-profile events like the Oscars and Golden Globes, and at the 2022 premiere of \"No Time to Die,\" in which Malek starred opposite Daniel Craig as James Bond. But by the end of that year, Malek was spotted with his \"No Time to Die\" co-star, Lea Seydoux, and with actor Emma Corrin in 2023.\n\nActress Hassie Harrison joined the cast of \"Yellowstone\" as barrel racer Laramie in Season 3. Her character soon became involved with the ex-convict turned ranch hand Walker, played by country singer/songwriter Ryan Bingham. Their on-screen relationship soon became a case of life imitating art: The pair announced their romance in 2023 via an Instagram post that featured a photo of them kissing in front of a roaring bonfire. \"More than spark,\" read Bingham's caption, which was punctuated with a fire emoji. Harrison's response was straight to the point: \"I love you, cowboy,\" she wrote.\n\nPrior to partnering with Bingham, Harrison was involved with another co-star: \"One Tree Hill\" and \"Walking Dead\" vet Austin Nichols, with whom she appeared in the indie feature \"The Iron Orchard.\" Bingham, who won an Oscar, Golden Globe, and a Grammy for his song \"The Weary Kind\" from the movie \"Crazy Heart,\" was previously married to Anna Axster for 12 years until their divorce in 2021.\n\n\"Riverdale\" fans got giddy when news broke in 2018 that its resident Veronica and Reggie — played by Charles Melton and Camila Mendes, respectively – appeared to be dating off-screen as well. Public displays of affection and joint appearances at events soon followed though Mendes told LA Confidential in 2019 that she is cautious about discussing the details of her relationship with Melton. \"It's like, yeah, even though I feel comfortable talking about some things, do I really want to see it written over and over again? Sometimes, it's not really worth it,\" she explained.\n\nThe couple appeared to split shortly before their one-year anniversary in 2019, but media coverage showing them together suggested a different story. However, a second split in 2021 was permanent: Mendes told the Going Mental podcast (via Yahoo) in 2023 that she was in a new relationship with an as-yet-unidentified man. \"I don't want to, like, speak above and beyond, but I feel like I've known him my whole life, and that's something I actually have never felt before.\""
