Maj. Kenyatta Gaskins, Directorate of Military Personnel Management sergeant major.\n\nThe directive will apply to active duty Soldiers and Active Guard Reserve members. The instruction will apply to the Army Reserve starting Oct. 1.\n\nWe want to get after leading, teaching and mentoring our junior enlisted Soldiers early, Gaskins said. This is a junior leader development process and that's how we're looking at this.\n\n In the past, the Army selected Soldiers with leadership potential to higher graded positions to become corporals. Now Soldiers who have been recommended for promotion to sergeant and completed the required training will have that distinction.\n\nGaskins said that the length of time a Soldier spends as corporal will vary but each Soldier will be expected to wear the rank for a period of time before transitioning to sergeant.\n\nThis is a change in culture, Gaskins, who held the rank of corporal earlier in his career. This is not something were used to. The change coincides with the Armys plans to invest more in the leadership development of younger Soldiers, supporting Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael A. Grinstons\n\nThis is My Squad initiative. That effort includes a push to further strengthen the Armys junior NCO corps, and will instill more than just leadership skills.\n\nPromotion boards to sergeant and staff sergeant include situational-based questions on sexual harassment, misuse of drugs and alcohol and suicide prevention. Soldiers will also be quizzed on suicide prevention, physical fitness, and mental health to gauge their reaction to such incidents and to make sure they can care for Soldiers in those situations.\n\nUnder the directive, unit cohesion will be strengthened at the lowest levels by promoting Soldiers to corporal.\n\nWe rely on junior leaders to build cohesive teams that are highly trained, disciplined, and mentally and physically fit,\" Grinston said. \"In many cases, a specialist is charged with that responsibility. This allows us to recognize their role as a noncommissioned officer and ensure theyre getting the coaching and mentorship they need to be successful.\n\nGaskins said by developing leadership traits earlier in military careers, Soldiers will be able to identify and prevent what Army senior leaders have labeled as corrosives to the force including sexual assault and harassment, discrimination and suicide.\n\nThe Army also announced that beginning June 1, 2022, for active duty, and Active Guard Reserve Soldiers and Oct. 1, 2022, for Army Reserve, Solders must be recommended by a promotion board to Sergeant before attending BLC.\n\nInstilling leadership early\n\nOne of the oldest ranks in the Army, the Corporal rank has been called the backbone of the Armys NCO corps, Gaskins said.\n\nCorporals earn E-4 pay but outrank specialists having the distinction of being NCOs. The Army charges them with leading the Armys smallest units, teams of Soldiers, while overseeing the care, training and readiness of fellow troops.\n\nNow the rank carries possibly a greater distinction, one that showcases the Armys commitment to developing responsible leaders early and to combat against misconduct.\n\nIt's a visual reminder that the Soldiers have transitioned from junior ranks to become a member of the NCO Corps, Gaskins said.\n\nRelated links: U.S. Army ranks\n\nArmy News Service\n\nARNEWS Archives\n\nCombined Arms Center Commanding General visits MEDCoE\n\nBy Tish Williamson | U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence Public Affairs | Jan. 21, 2021\n\nJOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas \n\nThe U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence hosted Lt. Gen. James Rainey, commanding general, U.S. Army Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston Jan. 19-20.\n\nIn a visit planners described as battlefield circulation, Rainey met with key MEDCoE leaders, received an update brief on Army Medicine in large-scale combat operations and conducted leader professional development, or LPD, sessions with unit command teams and Medical Captains Career Course students.\n\nPreviously aligned under the U.S. Army Medical Command, MEDCoE realigned from MEDCOM to the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, or TRADOC, with operational control under the CAC that began Oct. 19, 2018, and was completed Oct. 2, 2019.\n\nMEDCoE is one of the 10 centers of excellence under CAC and TRADOC to include aviation, fires, cyber and intelligence.\n\nBefore the first LPD session, Rainey  in command since December 2019  recognized several Soldiers and civilians who were nominated by the command for excellence. He then thanked attendees for their service and noted that less than one percent of Americans have volunteered to serve something greater than themselves as they all have through their military service.\n\nRainey explained that, if those who serve are the best America has to offer, then those he is being asked to recognize for excellence must be truly outstanding.\n\nThat is why I never miss a chance to recognize excellence, Rainey said. You are really in the presence of greatness when you talk about the best of this group of people who are willing to serve their country.\n\nThe Combined Arms Center is the U.S. Army's lead organization for several modernization initiatives to include managing the Army Leader Development and Army Profession Programs.\n\nLeaders should focus on doing well personally and developing others, Rainey said to the MEDCoE company, battalion and brigade command teams.\n\nMEDCoEs Borden Institute releases teledermatology E-book\n\nBy Ernest J. Barner | Borden Institute Public Affairs | Jan. 25, 2021\n\nJOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas  The Borden Institute, an agency of the U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, recently released Teledermatology in Military Medicine as a part of its specialty publication titles.\n\nThe 12-chapter book, released Dec. 17, 2020, covers all major skin diseases from bacterial, fungal and viral infections to bullous disorders, arthropod-borne diseases, and tumors of the skin. Other selected topics include shipboard consults, cold and hot weather factors, and combat-related burns.\n\nThe unique factors affecting dermatologic care in each major geographical command are discussed. Representative cases and more than 620 color images are included in this book to demonstrate instructional sample cases from each region.\n\nThe foreword was written by Lt. Gen. Raymond S. Dingle, U.S. Army Surgeon General and commanding general of the U.S. Army Medical Command.\n\nThis publication captures a piece of history and is basically a testament to the military dermatologists who provided services before the world had smartphones, social media and reliable internet bandwidth, said retired Army Col. (Dr.) Jon H. Meyerle, senior consultant and editor for the publication. Teledermatology and this publication directly contribute to the care of thousands of service members from every region of the globe.\n\nThe electronic publication exemplifies the continuing readiness commitment to U.S. Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Guardians and Marines and is the ideal resource for military dermatologists and providers who operate at home bases and various remote areas of responsibility.\n\nThe debut edition of Teledermatology in Military Medicine is currently available in PDF and E-book formats on the Borden Institute website at http://www.medcoe.army.mil/borden.\n\nA New Way of Training the Armys Flight Paramedics\n\nBy Gina Cavallaro | U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence Public Affairs | Aug 2020\n\nThe Army is changing the way it trains its flight paramedics to prepare for a future battlefield where swift medical evacuation wont be assured. The Combat Paramedic Course, a 30-week pilot, marks the first step in ramping up medical expertise that could include ground paramedics and more advanced skills for the Armys almost 34,000 combat medics. Jay Harmon III, deputy to the commander of the U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence in San Antonio, Maj. Chris Gonzalez, pilot program director, and Master Sgt. Joey Hernandez, pilot NCO in charge, explain. Their answers have been condensed and edited for space.\n\n1. How were paramedics trained until now? The Army was producing the paramedic certification through a contract here in San Antonio. Civilian paramedic programs are focused on pre-hospital emergency medical services, but the dynamics change in an operational context like combat. [Civilian paramedics] have protocols and standing guidance provided by their medical director; we teach our students how to think critically through a problem set in the event they have no doctor they can go back to.\n\n2. Do you have an example of that critical thinking? Take something as simple as tourniquet application. We teach combat medics which wounds can be controlled with a tourniquet and then reinforce the accurate, adequate and timely delivery of that. With combat paramedics, we dont just need them to be experts at that kind of basic skill, we need them to understand, OK, I cant evacuate this person for two hours. Can I convert this tourniquet to another kind of dressing thats not going to cut off circulation to the entire limb? Now Ive got them for 12 hours, and I have a new problem. How do I prepare for that? That sort of thing.\n\n3. When will the pilot end? The first course began in January; there were two more starts in March and June, so the pilot will end early in 2021. Our objective is to make it a program of record, build it into the [budget] and make it a recurring and permanent part of our curriculum. Graduates who go on to serve as flight paramedics will attend and eight-week critical care course in San Antonio] and a four-week air crew member training course at Fort Rucker, Alabama.\n\n4. Any additional certifications? Graduates will receive 51 of 60 semester credit hours toward an associate degree in Health Sciences–Emergency Medical Services (Army Paramedic) from the Uniformed Services University, a National Registered Paramedic certificate and [several certifications from national emergency medical and trauma care organizations].\n\n5. Why just flight paramedics? At this time, the only paramedic requirement is for flight paramedics. If you look at this thing as a pyramid, the critical-care flight paramedics are the very top level. They’re the cap, the most highly trained medic that we are going to put in the force. Army leadership may determine that there are additional requirements for this capability at the ground [level. If so,] we will already have a validated program in place that will simply require resourcing to scale.\n\n6. What’s the next level down on the pyramid? An advanced medical NCO trained to a combat paramedic standard that we would try to employ on all evacuation platforms in certain scenarios, units and situations. We want to make our medics better at the base of the pyramid by giving them more knowledge and more skills that, quite frankly, before have only been seen in our nursing care specialists who receive training in how to take care of patients for longer periods of time. We want to take portions of that [training] to include in Advanced Individual Training for combat medics.\n\n7. How significant is this? It’s the contract that we have with our soldiers that when they go into harm’s way, that we’re going to do everything medically, humanly possible to prevent loss of life. With this, we are just increasing the trust and confidence of the soldiers in us.\n\nArmy Medical Department Board test auto-injectors, gets feedback from Soldiers\n\nBy Jose E.

The effects of chemical and biological weapons are horrific.\n\nNerve agents are the most toxic of the known chemical agents. They are hazards in both liquid and vapor states and can cause death within minutes after exposure. Nerve agents are the primary chemical warfare agent threat because of their high toxicity and effectiveness through multiple routes of entry. They are absorbed through the eyes, respiratory tract, and skin.\n\nEnsuring CBD auto-injectors are functional and usable are critical in savings lives. The CBD Auto-Injector Device is designed to be used in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear, or CBRN, environment. Recently the U.S. Army Medical Department Board, or USAMEDDBD, assigned to the U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, conducted a test of these devices at JBSA-Camp Bullis.\n\nThe Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense, Medical Countermeasure Systems, or JPEO-CBD MCS, at Fort Detrick, Maryland, requested the AMEDD Board conduct a customer test of the CBD auto-injector device within the operational environment. The data and test findings collected by the AMEDD Board will be will be provided to JPEO--CBD MCS.\n\nThe CBD Auto-Injector Device is a replacement for the currently fielded auto-injector for treatment against nerve agent and insecticide poisoning, adjunctive treatment, and management of agent-induced seizures. The United States military adopted the auto-injector as the drug delivery device because of ease of use, packaging durability, and drug product stability under varying storage conditions.\n\nSoldiers donned Mission Oriented Protective Posture, more commonly known as MOPP protective gear, and tested the CBD auto-injectors in a simulated battlefield exercise complete with smoke grenades. MOPA masks can limit visibility, so the injectors have clear, easy to understand pictorial instructions. \"A lot of these auto-injectors used to have wording, just written instructions,\" said Gary Cabigon, an operational tester with the AMEDD Board.\n\n\"What we learned over the years is that pictures are easier to comprehend, especially in a stressful environment.\" Cabigon said that when under a CBRN attack vital seconds saved in dispensing the injector matter. Sgt. First Class Elijah Williamson, an AMEDD Board test officer, talked about conducting the test in the field. \"I think it's great having the training asset here at Fort Sam,\" Williamson said.\n\nWe have the austere environment where we can create the simulation of the battlefield. We do so much on slides and videos that you want to get hands-on and create that realism out at JBSA-Camp Bullis. You can't get that in the classroom.\"\n\nThe CBD auto-injectors are designed to deliver an intramuscular injection with a 22-gauge needle with a pressure-activated coil spring mechanism that triggers the needle after removal of the safety cap. When activated, the needle protrudes through the needle end.\n\nThe CBD auto-injector device is a replacement for the currently fielded auto-injector for treatment against nerve agent and insecticide poisoning, adjunctive treatment, and management of agent-induced seizures. The United States military adopted the auto-injector as the drug delivery device because of ease of use, packaging durability, and drug product stability under varying storage conditions.\n\nTo learn more about the Army Medical Department Board's mission, visit https://www.cs.amedd.army.mil/ameddbd.\n\nAbout MEDCoE\n\nThe U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence, or MEDCoE, is located at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.
