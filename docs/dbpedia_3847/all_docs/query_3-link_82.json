        "text": "Today's news feeds from Kyiv:\n\nKYIV POST\n\nhttps://www.kyivpost.com/topic/war-in-ukraine\n\nUkraine's Mahuchikh Urges Russian Athletes to Speak Up Against War\n\nThe 22-year-old high jumper, who fled Ukraine following Russia's invasion of her country, won the women's Olympic high jump in Paris on Sunday.\n\nFor a fairly short time, Ukrainian medalists will have the attention of a large percentage of the world's population. This would be an excellent use of that brief window of opportunity.\n\nSpy Chief and His Fairytale Frog: The Fascinating Tale Behind a $6,000 Artwork\n\nUkrainian artist Yevgenia Gapchinska painted Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, with Petro, his pet frog. Titled \"Budanov and the Magical Frog,\" the artwork sold for $6,000.\n\nISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 5, 2024\n\nLatest from the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nUK Increases Production of Martlet Missiles, Some Intended for Ukraine\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence has ordered a quantity of Martlet lightweight multirole missiles worth Â£176 million to enhance the British army's capabilities. Some will be sent to Ukraine.\n\n'The Battle for the Sky Rages On' - Ukraine at War Update for Aug. 6\n\nRussian drones and missiles target Kyiv; AFU releases footage of Storm Shadow's devastation; Air Force says 8,000 aerial targets downed to date; Kremlin arrests defense officials for embezzlement.\n\nAll of the recent arrests of russian oafishals for various forms of corruption could be a sign Mordor is trying to rein in such disastrous wastes of resources . . . but is much more likely to be the new Defense Minister clearing out people not personally loyal to him in order to make sure more of the graft comes his way.\n\nFreed Russian Anti-War Politicians Trigger Backlash in Ukraine\n\nThe backlash to the first set of public comments by some of those released in last week's historic prisoner exchange is a stark indication of the chasm between Kyiv and Russia's anti-war opposition.\n\nDespite their supposed anti-Kremlin beliefs, these russian dissidents seem to be parroting a lot of the Kremlin's talking points when it comes to Ukraine.\n\nPianist Behind Anti-War Videos Dies in Russian Prison\n\nSince November 2022, the pianist had posted four videos criticising the Kremlin and the Ukraine invasion on a YouTube channel with only a few dozen followers.\n\nOPINION: Anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, Politics and Ukraine\n\nThe Warsaw Uprising, along with the city of Warsaw itself, serves as a significant example for present-day war-torn Ukraine and its destroyed and occupied cities\n\nKYIV INDEPENDENT\n\nhttps://kyivindependent.com/tag/war/\n\nEx-Supreme Court head Kniaziev dismissed from post of judge.\n\nVsevolod Kniaziev, former chairman of Ukraine's top judicial body and a suspect in a bribery case, was dismissed on Aug. 6 from his post as a judge of the Supreme Court's Cassation Administrative Court.\n\nArrival of F-16s has not changed US' policy on Ukrainian strikes inside Russia.\n\nThe United States will decide on the use of American-made weapons provided to Ukraine, including F-16 fighters, for strikes in Russia depending on the situation on the battlefield and the needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, according to the State Department.\n\nThis is beyond stupid. Ukraine is literally fighting for its existence, and the lace-panty brigade at the US State Department is concerned about possible \"escalation\". fark that. Real people are dying needlessly as a direct result of American timidity. Give Ukraine the tools they need to win, and let Ukraine decide where, when, and how to use those tools. Win- not \"resist russian aggression\".\n\nRussia strikes medical facility in Kharkiv, people may be trapped under rubble.\n\nThe Russian military struck a residential area in the center of the city, causing a fire and damaging a clinic, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov.\n\nRussian attacks across Ukraine kill 3, injure 19 over past day.\n\nA total of 11 Ukrainian oblasts came under Russian attacks over the past day - Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Luhansk, Khmelnytskyi, Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Donetsk. Casualties were reported in seven regions.\n\nIran asks Russia for air defenses to prepare for potential war with Israel, NYT reports.\n\nRussia's top security official, former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, visited Tehran on August 5 as the country allegedly prepares to retaliate against Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil on July 31.\n\nGiven how poorly russian air defenses are faring in Ukraine, Your Humble Correspondent suspects this is unlikely to change the strategic or operational situation much. That said, having SAMs is better than not having them- and Iran doesn't have any good options for getting air defenses. At the very least, any SAMs provided by Mordor could absorb a fraction of any incoming fire.\n\nGeneral Staff: Russia has lost 585,140 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nThis number includes 1,050 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.\n\nExplosion reported at military plant in Russia, killing 3.\n\nAn explosion reported at an Avangard plant in Bashkortostan, Russia, killed three people, RFE/RL reported on Aug. 5. The plant belongs to Rostec, the Russian state-owned arms manufacturer.\n\nNoted Fire Artiste Ivan Ivanovitch sure does get around. Rostov yesterday, and Bashkortostan today. Think of the frequent flyer miles he's accumulating.\n\nHungarian CEO confident in country's oil supply despite Ukraine's Lukoil transit block.\n\nHungary will not face oil shortages due to Ukraine's decision to block Lukoil PJSC's crude transit, according to Zsolt Hernadi, CEO of Hungarian oil and gas conglomerate MOL Group.\n\nPerhaps Hungary would be better off electing this guy instead of the Budapest Bullfrog. The Hungarian government doesn't appear to have made any contingency plans for losing access to russian oil flowing through Ukraine, but this Hungarian oil company seems to have done so.\n\nUkraine war latest: Russian Su-34 jet destroyed in Ukraine's strike on Morozovsk airfield, Kyiv says\n\nInvestigation: Almost 2 years into first reports of wrongdoing, Ukraine's International Legion appears immune to change\n\nYour Humble Correspondent suspects a lot of these issues are also present in other Ukrainian units. The main difference appears to be the lack of response by UAF leadership to complaints by the Legion. Aside from the Legion's effectiveness in combat, it also serves as a political tool for the government in Kyiv- showcasing how much of the world is united in support of Ukraine. Your Humble Correspondent is NOT suggesting treating the Legion better than units composed entirely of Ukrainian nationals, merely treating their complaints with the same respect given to other Ukrainian units.\n\nHere's hoping these articles by Kyiv Independent manage to get some attention at the upper levels of UAF and the Ministry of Defense.\n\nExplosions heard in Kyiv shortly after air alert sounds.\n\nAt least four explosions were heard in Kyiv shortly after the air alert sounded at around 11 p.m. local time, Kyiv Independent journalists reported on Aug. 5.\n\nOpinion: The path to peace in Europe\n\nALL of this.\n\nLabor shortages in Poland increasing as influx of Ukrainians slows, data suggests.\n\nCompanies in Poland are seeing increasing shortages of workers as the influx of Ukrainians into the country slows, Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita reported on Aug. 5, citing data from Credit Agricole bank.\n\nKyiv developers bulldoze monuments as Russian missiles destroy Ukraine's cultural heritage\n\nIT software for UK nuclear submarine engineers outsourced to Belarus, the Telegraph reports.\n\nThe news that the development of an IT system used by British nuclear submarine engineers was outsourced to Belarusian developers has led to calls that the U.K. must carry out an urgent review of defense supply chains, the Telegraph reported on Aug. 3.\n\nHarlee's GoFundMe for his cats Shadow and Blossom plus the 6 strays reached its original goal thanks to our generous support! Harlee thanked us and let us know he's leaving the fundraiser open with additional donations going towards the Stanton, CA, Trap/Neuter/Release program (stretch goal is $7,500). As an anal retentive retired accountant, he has promised documentation for all relevant expenses (receipt tranche 1 and tranche 2). As of the time of writing, we've helped raise $5,227. I say \"we\" because I donated and there are several Farkers among the named supporters. Details can be found at https://gofund.me/0365a8f8 or by searching \"Steve Ball's mission to provide medical care for eight cats.\"\n\nFor those of you new to the Ukrainian War threads or who are only able to check them occasionally, here's my post summarizing the WW3 threads for July 27 through August 2 (Days 885 to 891) and the welfare check ins (part 2). Had to split them due to the number of tagged Farkers in the update.\n\nOneiros should be around to post the most up-to-date list of aid links, but here's the most recent list (part 2, part 3) which should be mostly fresh until he is. Older summaries along with an archive of threads can be found here in a spreadsheet being maintained by notmyjab and turboke if you need to catch up on that. Specific posts are under the \"articles\" tab. And if you need a good laugh, check out danceswithcrows's meme emporium (and now the corvids are collating and cataloguing Bob Able's colorings!), toraque's improved Russian press releases, and now Old_Chief_Scott's Boom of the Week. If you're looking for a frontline account, check Medic Zero's substack.\n\nAs always, let me know if there's anything more to include that I missed and help me keep an eye out over the upcoming week for key events."
