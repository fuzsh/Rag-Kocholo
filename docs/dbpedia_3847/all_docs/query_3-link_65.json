        "text": "My unit I was in after OSUT, the 374th Sapper Company, it was mobilized but called off due to the drawdown. So our unit almost deployed but never did.\n\nThe two bottom pictures are of my old unit patch (1st Engineer Brigade -Combat-) and the other is my Distinctive Unit Insignia for the battalion. I was in as part of the brigade (31st Engineer Battalion -Combat-). The one that says “Alpha Knights” was my old Company Mural, A Company, 31st Engineer Battalion, 1st Engineer Brigade.\n\nI began my journey in the Army a little over a year ago, enlisting in early February of 2015. I shipped out for Basic Training-OSUT as a 12B, Combat Engineer at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. I was assigned to A Company, 31st Engineer Battalion, 1st Engineer Brigade. When that was completed by August, I went and got Combat Life Saver Certified at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas and then to BCT3 (Brigade Combat Trauma Training Team) at Camp Bullis, all while being assigned to the 32nd Medical Brigade for that extra training.\n\nI completed that all in November and from there I’m headed to Fort Riley, Kansas for my next duty assignment: 1st Engineer Battalion (Combat), 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized Infantry).\n\nEssayons!\n\n~ Max Lanzing, U.S. Army Soldier\n\nWe invite you to share your family member’s service pictures and a brief story to be shared on our timeline for all to honor."
