The brigade deployed to Vietnam, where it participated in 12 of the 17 campaigns, including Counteroffensive, Counteroffensive Phases II through VII, Tet Counteroffensive; Summer-Fall 1969; Winter-Spring 1970, and the Sanctuary Counteroffensive.\n\nIn March, 1970, the 44th Medical Brigade merged with the United States Army, Vietnam Surgeon’s Office to form the Medical Command, Vietnam (Provisional). The brigade's colors returned to the United States in December 1970. During the brigade’s Vietnam tour, it was awarded two Meritorious Unit Commendation Streamers embroidered “Vietnam 1969–1970” by the government of the Republic of Vietnam.\n\nOn 19 March 1973, the 44th Medical Brigade was inactivated at Fort Meade, Maryland. The brigade was reactivated on 21 September 1974 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, assigned to the XVIII Airborne Corps. The 44th Medical Brigade deployed in support of XVIII Airborne Corps operations in Grenada, Panama, and Iraq, the last of which earned the brigade a Meritorious Unit Commendation. On 16 July 1993, the brigade became a separate major subordinate command with a general officer commanding. Following the reorganization, the 44th Medical Brigade participated in Operation Uphold Democracy, Operation Enduring Freedom, and most recently, Operation Iraqi Freedom. The brigade has also participated in hurricane relief efforts, including those following Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Katrina, and Hurricane Rita. The brigade was converted to a Medical Command on 16 October 2001 and became a multi-component unit. While at Fort Bragg the brigade had become an Airborne unit, but as part of its conversion the 44th lost this designation. Only headquarters elements and a very limited number of its subordinate units had actually been on jump status, and the reorganization to a command removed headquarters elements from jump status. Currently the unit is redesignated as 44th Medical Brigade on 21 April 2010.\n\nSubordinate units[]\n\nVietnam[]\n\n43rd Medical Group\n\n55th Medical Group\n\n67th Medical Group\n\n68th Medical Group\n\n32nd Medical Depot\n\nCurrent[]\n\nUnits of the 44th Medical Brigade:[1]\n\nHeadquarters & Headquarters Company, Fort Bragg\n\n14th Combat Support Hospital, Fort Benning\n\n28th Combat Support Hospital, Fort Bragg [1]\n\n240th Medical Detachment [2]\n\n274th Medical Detachment [3]\n\n541st Medical Detachment [4]\n\n759th Medical Detachment [5]\n\n86th Combat Support Hospital, Fort Campbell\n\n261st Multifunctional Medical Battalion, Fort Bragg, NC\n\n248th Veterinary Company, Fort Bragg, NC\n\n257th Dental Company (Area Support), Fort Bragg, NC\n\n1st Area Medical Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground\n\n9th Area Medical Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
