        "text": "The 32nd Medical Battalion Distinctive Unit Insignia was approved for wear by members of the 32nd Medical Battalion on 13 January 1941, and was subsequently redesignated for the 132nd Medical Battalion (1992) and 32nd Medical Brigade (2002) with updated descriptions and amended symbolism.\n\n“CONSERVAMUS PERSONIS,” the unit’s Latin motto, translates as “We Conserve The Personnel,” and the maroon color of the shield is taken from the first named color of the Army Medical Department. The brigade’s training mission is highlighted by a torch (light of knowledge) entwined by the green serpent from the staff of Aesculapius, ancient physician who was acclaimed as the “Father of Medicine.”\n\nAs of Winter 2024, the 32nd Medical Brigade is based at the U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence located Fort Sam Houston in Texas. Billing itself as a \"Leadership Factory,\" the 32nd Medical Brigade is the larges training Brigade in the Army and is comprised of the 232nd Medical Battalion and the 264th Medical Battalion, the 187th Medical Battalion, and the 188th Medical Battalion and 23 subordinate companies.\n\n♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦"
