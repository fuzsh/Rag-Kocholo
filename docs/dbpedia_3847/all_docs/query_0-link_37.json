        "text": "“Whatever rank or level you are at, never underestimate the value of being grounded in the basics.” On day two of the Silver Knight Summit we heard from Major General Lodi, Commanding General, 18th Medical Command (Deployment Support), about the focus areas of campaign plan rehearsals, Global Health Engagements, and modernization efforts in INDOPACOM. Colonel McFarland, 627th Hospital Center Commander, shared lessons learned from participation in Balikatan 24 in the Philippines and Colonel Freeman, 32nd Hospital Center Commander, shared her experiences from serving as the JTF Savior Commander in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. Our charrettes looked at how we can repurpose what we have now to fill gaps we know exist in three configurations: the MCAS, Role 2+, and Role 2+ Enhanced. Major Diaz, 61st MMB Support Operations, shared lessons learned from recent integration of the MMB and other EAB medical forces into NTC rotations and Operation Remagen Ready, the III Armored Corps wet-gap crossing exercise. In his closing comments Major General (Ret.) Weightman reminded the group, in both success and failure, to examine the processes that contributed to the outcome—these are what determine our consistent performance. Finally, we had an opportunity to recognize outstanding performance from Soldiers across the Brigade and to induct three Soldiers into the Order of Military Medical Merit. Heed the Knight!\n\nDay one of the Silver Knight Summit began with Silver Knight 6, Colonel Michael, issuing guidance to the group to think critically about warfighting, pull their lessons learned from training to test current doctrine, and, finally, to capture those lessons learned going forward. Major General Doyle, Commanding General, 4th Infantry Division, provided an overview Multi-Domain Operations at echelon and challenged the group to understand the changing operational environment, to look at how we train for that environment, and to think about the expertise needed from medical forces. Colonel Fricks, Chief of the Medical Evacuation Concepts and Capabilities Division, shared lessons learned from the frontlines of the conflict in Ukraine and Colonel Jones, Director of the MEDCoE Capability Development Integration Division discussed future medical forces in the Army of 2030. Finally, our senior mentor, Major General (Ret.) Weightman, emphasized the ingenuity needed at the lowest level to overcome challenges in today’s fight: “The most valuable thing you on the battlefield is right between your ears.” Heed the Knight!\n\nPFC Motl arrived to the 115th Field Hospital in March of 2022 and hit the ground running, wasting no time building his military resume. PFC Motl won the Best Squad Competition at the Brigade and 13th ACSC level, earned his Expert Field Medic and Air Assault Badges, and became level 1 Combatives certified. He remains eager to challenge himself daily and is very motivated to help others with his skills and knowledge.\n\n“We will never conquer what we our not willing to confront.” In recognition of Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, 1st Medical Brigade Leadership issued a proclamation reinforcing four pillars of the SHARP program: People, Prevention, Policy, and Protection. Our Soldiers are dedicated to their duties and responsibilities, and we must not allow this crime to threaten those who serve and protect our way of life."
