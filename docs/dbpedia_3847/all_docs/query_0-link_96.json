        "text": "Kharkiv is recovering from the latest Russian attack. Due to the shelling yesterday, one person was killed and 12 others were injured. According to medics, the injured suffered from glass cuts, bruises and traumatic brain injuries. An 8-month-old boy is among the wounded. People were injured during the shelling of the city center when a Russian missile hit amidst dense buildings.\n\nThis is stated in the story of TSN correspondent Victoria Streltsova.\n\nThe Russian terrorist army launched a missile strike on the center of Kharkiv. One of the buildings was directly hit. The epicenter of the enemy attack included offices, residential buildings and shops. Around ten in the morning, the Russians launched a missile into a densely built-up area.\n\n\"This is the building of a local clinic in Kharkiv. It was at the epicenter of the enemy strike. Windows were immediately shattered. There are piles of glass shards and construction debris underfoot. Volunteers and utility services immediately began preserving the building,\" said Victoria Streltsova.\n\nThey promise to fully preserve the building by the end of the day.\n\n\"More than 130 windows were blown out in this building. We have materials and people with tools who will carry out this work,\" said Maksym Melnyk, a volunteer from \"I Am Saved.\"\n\nAt the time of the shelling, there were people in the clinic. There were no casualties only because both doctors and patients managed to run to the corridors.\n\n\"Both staff and patients were present. Fortunately, no one was injured,\" said Svetlana Dunayeva, the clinic's secretary.\n\nOverall, twelve Kharkiv residents were injured in the attack, including an 8-month-old boy. One person died.\n\n\"The injured are local residents who were near the epicenter of the explosion. They were in their apartments. There are bruises, closed traumatic brain injuries and glass cuts,\" said Dmytro Chubenko, Spokesman for the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office.\n\nLaw enforcement officers found fragments of the munition at the impact site. From these fragments, they were able to preliminarily determine that it was an \"Iskander\"-type missile.\n\nRead also:"
