        "text": "Alsu Kurmasheva, Evan Gershkovich, and Paul Whelan -- three of the 24 detainees involved in the largest prisoner exchange since the Cold War ended – have returned to the United States where they were greeted by President Joe Biden and family amid cheers from those gathered at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington, D.C.\n\nArriving from Turkey where part of the exchange took place on August 1, the three were part of a group of 16 prisoners Russia and its close ally Belarus released in exchange for eight Russians held in the United States and several other countries.\n\nBiden, who earlier in the day hailed the historic exchange at a White House news conference, was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris to welcome the three as family members, colleagues, and media looked on.\n\nKurmasheva, a journalist for RFE/RL, Gershkovich, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, and Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive, are all U.S. citizens.\n\nWhelan, a former Marine, was the first to emerge from the plane and saluted Biden as he came down the steps and onto the tarmac. After saluting back and shaking hands, the president took off his lapel pin and gave it to Whelan, who had been in Russian detention for more than five years, the longest period of the three returnees.\n\nGershkovich, who also received applause as he embraced the president, followed, while Kurmasheva was the last of the three to come off the plane, also hugging Biden amid applause from the crowd.\n\nThe 32-year-old Gershkovich was detained in Russia in March 2023 while out on a reporting trip in Yekaterinburg. He was sentenced in July to 16 years in prison on spying charges that were rejected by the United States and his employer, the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"Not bad,\" he replied as he greeted fellow journalists who asked how it felt to finally be home after spending 491 days in detention.\n\nKurmasheva, a 47-year-old mother of two, was arrested in Kazan in October 2023 and first charged with failing to register as a \"foreign agent\" under a punitive Russian law that targets journalists, civil society activists, and others. She was subsequently charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military and sentenced to 6 1/2 years.\n\nIn announcing the swap earlier in the day, Biden slammed Russia for conducting \"show trials\" that led to the imprisonment of Gershkovich, Whelan, and Kurmasheva, saying \"all three were falsely accused of being spies.\"\n\nWhen asked what he would say to Russian President Vladimir Putin after the swap, the president replied: “Stop,” a reference to taking Americans into custody on dubious charges.\n\nBiden noted earlier that the prisoner swap required \"significant concessions\" from Germany, which released FSB Colonel Vadim Krasikov, a Russian convicted of the murder in 2019 of a former Chechen militant in Berlin.\n\nThe trade came even with relations between Washington and Moscow eroding to their lowest point in decades after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe prisoner swap included dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, a dual Russian-British citizen who was imprisoned for making critical remarks about the invasion.\n\nKara-Murza also holds a green card, which allows a person to live and work permanently in the United States, but traveled first to Germany where he and two other Russian activists, Andrei Pivovarov and Ilya Yashin, held a news conference in which they vowed to continue fighting for a free Russia.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:01 0:00\n\n\"Alsu, Evan, Paul, Vladimir and others, you belong home with your families and loved ones!\" European Council President Charles Michel said in a post on X. \"I thank all those, also in Europe, who helped to make the diplomatic deal possible. EU will continue supporting and standing for all those illegally detained in Russia and elsewhere.\"\n\nAfter spending time with family and friends, Kurmasheva, Gershkovich, and Whelan traveled on to San Antonio, Texas, for medical treatment and debriefing by U.S. officials.\n\nThe release of 16 people from Russia and Belarus included five Germans and seven Russian citizens who were political prisoners in their own country.\n\nIn an interview with RFE/RL's North.Realities service, the parents of Ksenia Fadeyeva, another of the Russian activists released by Moscow in the exchange, said the first time they suspected something was in the works was when they began hearing more and more about the topic of prisoner exchanges in the media.\n\n\"She certainly didn’t think she’d be released like this. Neither did we. It's just some kind of miracle,\" said her mother, Iryna Fadeyeva.\n\nKsenia Fadeyeva, 32, is a former local lawmaker and the former head of the late opposition leader Aleksei Navalny's regional office in the Siberian city of Tomsk. In December 2023, she was convicted on charges including organizing activities of an extremist group and was handed a nine-year prison term. She is now in Germany after the exchange but did not appear at the news conference in Bonn with Kara-Murza, Pivovarov, and Yashin.\n\n\"We don't know anything for sure yet, but we are ordinary citizens, not military personnel, without restrictions on entering and exiting the country. I think they will let us see each other,\" her father, Vladislav Fadeyev, said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the decision to release Krasikov, a convicted hit man, had been difficult.\n\n\"Nobody took this decision to deport a murderer sentenced to life imprisonment after only a few years...lightly,\" Scholz said, speaking in Cologne, Germany, on August 1.\n\n\"The state's interest in seeing him punished had to be weighed against the danger to the bodies and in some cases the lives of innocent people in prison in Russia and political prisoners,\" he told reporters.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:06 0:00\n\nBiden said Germany asked for nothing in exchange. The president added that the prisoner swap was \"a powerful example of why it is important to have friends in the world.\"\n\nWhile those released celebrated, they also said they remained concerned for others who weren't included in the swap.\n\nMarc Fogel, a 62-year-old English teacher, is one such case.\n\nHe was arrested at an airport in Moscow in 2021 for carrying about half an ounce of medical marijuana he said he had been prescribed to manage severe pain following surgeries on his back, shoulder, and knee. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison after prosecutors claimed he intended to sell the drugs to his students.\n\nSenior U.S. officials said they tried to include Fogel in the exchange, but Russia rejected his inclusion.\n\nThat did little to help calm the despair Fogel's family felt after word came that he would not be returning home with the others. In a statement after the deal was made public, his family said it was \"inconceivable\" that he had not been part and urged the Biden administration to make his release a priority.\n\nPoland, Slovenia, and Norway also played roles in the swap by releasing Russians back to Moscow that they held.\n\nTurkey, a NATO ally that also has warm relations with Moscow, was heavily involved in facilitating talks on the swap, with Ankara hosting the actual exchange of the prisoners.\n\nPRISTINA -- The U.S. ambassador to Pristina has expressed concerns about the partnership between the United States and Kosovo, especially regarding the government's handling of issues related to the country's Serb minority.\n\nIn an interview with RFE/RL's Kosovo Service, the ambassador, Jeffrey Hovenier, said \"the quality of our partnership is not what we would hope it would be on some of these issues\" and that the U.S. administration had been \"challenged\" by Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti and his government.\n\nIn recent weeks there has been an uptick of tensions in the Serb-majority north of the country, with ethnic Serbs protesting against the government's plan to reopen a controversial bridge and the closure of Serbian post office branches.\n\nEthic Serbs are protesting the government's plan to reopen to vehicular traffic a bridge in the northern city of Mitrovica, which separates ethnic Serb and Albanian communities and has been a flashpoint for violence in the past.\n\nWhile the Kosovar government has said reopening the bridge can better integrate the Serbian population and boost the regional economy, locals Serbs are concerned that the move would increase ethnic tensions and impact their safety.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px

ultimately be open to vehicles, \"this is not the time\" due to security concerns.\n\n\"We believe there's real risk associated with taking this action right now,\" he said, citing potential violence and threats to NATO soldiers, including Americans.\n\nNATO forces have been operating in Kosovo to maintain peace and stability since 1999, when the military alliance intervened to stop escalating violence being perpetrated by Serbian forces against ethnic Albanians.\n\nBefore the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Kosovo was an autonomous province within Serbia, which was itself a constituent republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nWhile acknowledging areas of positive cooperation between the United States and Kosovo, particularly in economic development and strengthening government institutions, Hovenier said Washington had been \"challenged by the prime minister and by his government\" regarding its handling of issues pertaining to the Serb minority.\n\nLast week, the Kosovar authorities closed down nine branches of the Serbian post office in the north after determining that they were operating illegally and without a license, a move that was criticized by the United States and the EU, which has mediated Serbia-Kosovo relations for over a decade.\n\nThere are an estimated 120,000 ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo, mostly in the north, and many still receive benefits or pensions from Serbia, which has never recognized Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence.\n\nJeffrey Hovenier Speaks To RFE/RL\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:28 0:00\n\nKosovo's Serbs have protested against Pristina's authority in areas such as health care, pensions, education, and customs controls.\n\nIn the interview, the U.S. ambassador expressed concern that Kosovo's drive for EU accession could be \"negatively affected\" by the government's actions.\n\nAs Kosovo seeks participation in international organizations such as NATO, the Council of Europe, and the EU, Hovenier stressed that the government's recent moves \"reduce the appetite and reduce...the enthusiasm for supporting Kosovo on these paths.\"\n\n\"I have not seen a lot of enthusiasm in support of this government's efforts right now for new memberships in international organizations,\" he said.\n\nHovenier also emphasized how important it was for Kosovo to secure the support of existing members of international organizations, especially as \"certain countries in those institutions...don't recognize Kosovo the way we do as a sovereign, independent state.\"\n\nThe United States and all but five EU members are among the more than 100 nations who acknowledge Kosovo's independence.\n\nHovenier urged the Kosovo government to take into account U.S. concerns, saying the U.S. requests were \"heartfelt\" and \"humble.\"\n\nIran on August 13 rejected Western calls to renounce its threat to retaliate against Israel following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\n\nHaniyeh was killed along with his personal bodyguard in Tehran on July 31 as he visited the Iranian capital for the swearing-in of President Masud Pezeshkian.\n\nIsrael hasn't confirmed or denied carrying out the attack.\n\nIran, Hamas's main backer, blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said in a statement that \"such a request lacks political logic, flies in the face of the principles and rules of international law, and constitutes public and practical support\" for Israel.\n\nReuters quoted on August 13 three senior Iranian officials as saying that only a cease-fire deal in Gaza stemming from talks expected to take place in the coming days would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel.\n\nIsrael started an air and ground offensive in Gaza after Hamas fighters surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage. Israel’s action has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nAccording to one of the officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, Iran, along with allies such as Hizballah, would launch a direct attack if the Gaza talks, which are due to begin on August 15 in either Egypt or Qatar, fail or if it perceives Israel is dragging out negotiations. A cease-fire in Gaza, on the other hand, would give Iran cover for a smaller \"symbolic\" response, one of Reuters' sources said.\n\nHis statement came after the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy called on Iran on August 12 to \"stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also held phone calls with Pezeshkian the same day.\n\nStarmer asked Pezeshkian to refrain from attacking Israel and said that war was not in anyone's interest, his office said. Starmer told Pezeshkian he was deeply concerned by the situation in the Middle East and called on all parties to de-escalate to avoid further regional confrontation.\n\n\"There was a serious risk of miscalculation and now was the time for calm and careful consideration,\" Starmer was quoted as saying, adding that he had underlined his commitment to an immediate cease-fire, the release of all hostages, and increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nFollowing the call with Starmer, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that war anywhere in the world was in no one's interest but that states had the right to \"punitive responses against an aggressor.\"\n\nScholz also called on Pezeshkian to prevent further military escalation in the Middle East. \"The spiral of violence in the Middle East must now be broken,\" Scholz told Pezeshkian, according to a German government statement.\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agreed with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could \"attack Israel as early as this week.\" U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation.\n\nWestern diplomats have scrambled to avert a major conflagration in the Middle East, where tensions were already high due to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas fighters surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, and dpa\n\nUkraine's top military commander on August 13 said Ukrainian forces have taken control of 74 settlements in Russia's Kursk region as Ukrainian forces continued to make headway.\n\nColonel General Oleksandr Syrskiy briefed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy by video link, telling him Kyiv's military had advanced in different directions by up to 3 kilometers over the past 24 hours and had seized 40 square kilometers of new territory.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nZelesnskiy said on Telegram that he is constantly in touch with Syrskiy to receive reports on the front and the operation in the Kursk region. Despite the difficult, intense battles the advance continues, he said.\n\n\"I am grateful to our soldiers for their heroic service,\" he said.\n\nZelenskiy said later in a video message that hundreds of Russian soldiers surrendered to Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region and all of them are guaranteed humane treatment.\n\nIn a separate post on Telegram, Zelenskiy said he met in Kyiv with Lithuanian Defense Minister Laurynas Kasciunas, who told him Russia is moving troops from its Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad to the Kursk region.\n\nSome military analysts have said Ukraine may have launched the incursion to draw the Kremlin's forces away from the front line to defend Kursk and other border areas. But Ukraine's General Staff said Kremlin forces had intensified their attacks in eastern Ukraine. In its assessment late on August 13, the General Staff said in the previous 24 hours Russian troops launched 52 assaults in the area of Pokrovsk, a town in Ukraine's Donetsk region that is close to the front line. That's roughly double the number of daily attacks there a week ago.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on August 13 he had informed EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell about Kyiv's operation in the Kursk region. Kuleba said on X that during his call with Borrell, weapons manufacturing and deliveries were also discussed.\n\nUkrainian forces launched a surprise incursion into the Kursk region on August 6 and have occupied about 1,000 square kilometers and numerous population centers.\n\nIt is not possible to verify battlefield claims, although some reports have suggested deeper incursions by Ukrainian forces.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhy said on August 13 that \"Ukraine is not interested in taking over the territory of the Kursk region.\"\n\nHe said Russia had launched more than 2,000 strikes from the Kursk region in recent months using antiaircraft missiles, artillery, mortars, drones, 255 glide bombs, and more than 100 missiles.\n\n\"The purpose of this operation is to preserve the lives of our children, to protect the territory of Ukraine from Russian strikes,\" he said. \"These Ukrainian actions are absolutely legitimate.\"\n\nThe Kursk region's acting governor, Aleksei Smirnov, reported to President Vladimir Putin on August 12 that 28 settlements were \"under enemy control.\"\n\n\"The depth of the penetration into the territory of the Kursk region is 12 kilometers, the width of the front is 40 kilometers,\" he said.\n\nRepeating a Russian government talking point and without providing evidence, Russian Major General Apty Alaudinov, who is commander of the Akhmat special forces unit, said on Russian state TV that \"the headquarters of the NATO bloc certainly took part in the development of the operation.\"\n\nU.S. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters on August 13 that the United States is not engaged in any aspect, planning, or preparation of Ukraine's incursion into Russia.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre also said the United States had no advance notice from Ukraine that it planned the military incursion and had no involvement in it. U.S. officials have been seeking clarification from Ukraine about its objectives, she added.\n\nNearly the entire civilian population of the Krasnoyaruzh district of Russia's Belgorod region, located to the southeast of the Kursk region, has been evacuated, the region's governor said earlier.\n\n\"More than 11,000 people have left,\" Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram early on August 13. \"At present, about 1,000 people are in temporary housing.\"\n\nThe district's prewar population was about 14,000 people.\n\nThe governor announced the evacuation of the district on August 12 and closed off access to the area. The district head, Andrei Miskov, said the 500 people remaining in the area were mostly officials, emergency workers, and key specialists.\n\nThe Krasnoyaruzh district borders Ukraine to the west and the Kursk region's embattled Belov district to the north.\n\nUkrainian forces posted a video on August 12 that has been geolocated to the center of the Kursk region town of Sudzha. The exact date of the video is unclear, but Ukrainian soldiers can be heard saying that they had not yet encountered any Russian forces.\n\nRussian military vloggers have reported that Sudzha, about 10 kilometers from the border with a prewar population of more than 5,000 people, was under Ukrainian control.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said 12 Ukrainian drones had been \"destroyed\" overnight over the Kursk region and one each over the Belgorod and Voronezh regions.\n\nAcross the border in Ukraine's Sumy region, the Russian military carried out overnight strikes that damaged civilian energy infrastructure and several private cars, the region's military administration reported.\n\nOne civilian was reportedly wounded.\n\nUkraine's General Staff announced restrictions on the movement of civilians in the Sumy region within 20 kilometers of the border with Russia, citing the \"increasing intensity of hostilities.\"\n\nWith reporting by AP\n\nWashington has warned Tehran of “swift and severe” consequences if reports that it is planning to send hundreds of ballistic missiles to Russia are confirmed.\n\nWe are prepared to deliver a swift and severe response if Iran were to move forward with the transfer of ballistic missiles, which would, in our view, represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,\" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters on August 12.\n\nThe warning matches one issued by the United States earlier this year after Reuters -- citing six unidentified sources -- reported that Iran had shipped a “large number” of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic weapons to Russia.\n\nThe United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program over concerns Tehran could send such weapons to its Middle East allies and proxies and to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has suffered from weapons shortages as its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – launched in February 2022 – has dragged on with heavy losses of troops and military hardware, leaving it to look to allies such as Iran and North Korea to replenish its arms stock.\n\nOn February 22, the U.S. administration also warned Iran of a \"swift and severe\" response from the international community if Tehran provided ballistic missiles to Russia,\n\nNational-security spokesman John Kirby said at the time that Washington had yet to confirm the missiles had been transferred by Iran to Russia, but he said the move appeared likely.\n\n\"In this press reporting, the Iranians are clearly indicating that they will ship ballistic missiles to Russia, and we have no reason to believe they will not follow through,\" Kirby said.\n\nTehran has been providing Russia with unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, guided aerial bombs, and artillery ammunition, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials following widespread evidence of Iran-made Shahed drones causing damage and casualties in Ukraine, leading to additional Western sanctions.\n\n\"Iranian officials also continue to deny providing any UAVs [unmanned arial systems] to Russia when evidence is plain for the world to see that Russia has used these UAVs in relentless attacks against the civilian population in Ukraine, against civilian infrastructure,\" Patel told reporters.\n\nNewly elected Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian, considered by many to be a reformist leader, has spoken of hopes of improving relations with the West, but Patel expressed skepticism.\n\n\"This duplicity is only the latest reminder to the international community that the Iranian regime lacks in credibility,\" he said.\n\nIn January, the State Department issued a similar warning against North Korea in a joint statement with the European Union and dozens of others countries, including many in Asia.\n\n“The transfer of these weapons increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, supports Russia’s war of aggression, and undermines the global non-proliferation regime,” it said on January 9.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters"
