        "text": "What is Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome?\n\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome (also called NAS) is a group of conditions caused when a baby withdraws from certain drugs he’s exposed to in the womb before birth. NAS is most often caused when a woman takes drugs called opioids during pregnancy. But it can also be caused by antidepressants (used to treat depression), barbiturates or benzodiazepines (sleeping pills). When you take these drugs during pregnancy, they can pass through the placenta and cause serious problems for your baby. The placenta grows in your uterus (womb) and supplies your baby with food and oxygen through the umbilical cord.\n\nIf you’ve been injured or had surgery, your provider may give you a prescription for opioids to help relieve pain. Prescription opioids include:\n\nCodeine\n\nHydrocodone (name brand Vicodin®)\n\nMorphine (name brands Kadian®, Avinza®)\n\nOxycodone (name brands OxyContin®, Percocet®)\n\nTramadol\n\nThe street drug heroin also is an opioid.\n\nYou may hear NAS also called NOWS. NOWS stands for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. NOWS is the same as NAS except it’s caused only by opioids.\n\nIf you’re pregnant or trying to get pregnant and taking any of these drugs, tell your health care provider right away.\n\nWhat are signs of NAS?\n\nSigns of a condition are things someone else can see or know about you, like you have a rash or you’re coughing Signs of NAS can be different for every baby. Most happen within 3 days (72 hours) of birth, but some may happen right after birth or not until a few weeks after birth. They can last from 1 week to 6 months after birth.\n\nIf your baby has signs of NAS, call her provider right away. Signs may include:\n\nBody shakes (tremors), seizures (convulsions), overactive reflexes (twitching) and tight muscle tone\n\nFussiness, excessive crying or having a high-pitched cry\n\nPoor feeding or sucking or slow weight gain\n\nBreathing problems, including breathing really fast\n\nFever, sweating or blotchy skin\n\nTrouble sleeping and lots of yawning\n\nDiarrhea or throwing up\n\nStuffy nose or sneezing\n\nSigns of NAS depend on:\n\nWhat drug you used during pregnancy, how much you used and how long you took it\n\nHow your own body breaks down the drug\n\nYour baby’s gestational age at birth (number of weeks of pregnancy)\n\nWhat complications can NAS cause for your baby?\n\nBabies with NAS may have health conditions that need treatment in the newborn intensive care unit (also called NICU) after birth. The NICU is the nursery in a hospital where sick newborns get medical care. In addition to having withdrawal signs, babies with NAS are at increased risk of:\n\nLow birthweight. This means your baby is born weighing less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces.\n\nJaundice. This is when your baby’s skin and eyes look yellow. It’s caused when your baby’s liver isn’t fully developed or working.\n\nSeizures\n\nSudden infant death syndrome (also called SIDS). This is unexplained death of a baby younger than 1 year old. SIDS usually happens when a baby is sleeping.\n\nWe don’t know a lot about long-term effects of NAS on a baby. We need more research to see how NAS affects a child in the first few years of life and longer. We think that NAS may cause long-term problems for your baby, like:\n\nDevelopmental delays. Developmental delays are when your child doesn’t reach developmental milestones when expected. Developmental milestones are skills and activities that most children can do at a certain age, like sitting, walking, talking, having social skills and having thinking skills.\n\nMotor problems. These are problems with your baby’s bones, muscles and movement.\n\nBehavior and learning problems. Babies with NAS are more likely than babies who don’t have NAS to be checked for learning problems and to get special education services in school.\n\nSpeech and language problems\n\nSleep problems\n\nEar infections\n\nVision problems\n\nHow is your baby tested for NAS?\n\nYour baby’s provider can use these tests to see if your baby has NAS:\n\nNAS scoring system. With this system, your baby’s provider uses points to grade how severe your baby’s withdrawal is. Your baby’s provider uses the score to decide what kind of treatment your baby needs.\n\nUrine and meconium tests to check for drugs. Meconium is your baby’s first bowel movement.\n\nYour baby’s provider also needs to know about what drugs or medicine you’ve used and when you last took them. You may get a urine test.\n\nHow is NAS treated?\n\nYour baby’s treatment may include:\n\nTaking medicines to treat or manage severe withdrawal symptoms. Once withdrawal is under control, your baby gets smaller doses of the medicine over time so her body can adjust to being off the medicine. Medicines used to treat severe withdrawal include morphine, methadone and buprenorphine.\n\nGetting fluids through a needle into a vein (also called intravenous or IV) to prevent your baby from getting dehydrated. Dehydrated means not having enough water in the body. Babies with NAS can get dehydrated from having diarrhea or throwing up a lot.\n\nBeing fed higher-calorie baby formula. Some babies with NAS need extra calories to help them grow because they have trouble feeding or slow growth.\n\nMost babies with NAS who get treatment get better in 5 to 30 days.\n\nDuring treatment for NAS, your baby may be fussy and hard to soothe. Doing these things can help calm your baby:\n\nRoom in with your baby. This means you and your baby stay in the same room together at the hospital before you take your baby home.\n\nGive your baby skin-to-skin care (also called kangaroo care). This is when you put your baby, dressed only in a diaper, on your bare chest.\n\nBe gentle with your baby. Rock your baby gently. If she’s sleeping, don’t wake her up.\n\nSwaddle your baby (wrap him snuggly) in a blanket.\n\nKeep your baby’s room quiet and the lights dim.\n\nBreastfeed your baby. Feed your baby on demand. This means you feed your baby when he’s hungry.\n\nGive your baby a pacifier.\n\nYour baby’s provider checks your baby often in the NICU after birth to make sure he’s getting better and having fewer and less severe withdrawal signs. Your baby can go home from the hospital when she:\n\nIs feeding well\n\nIs sleeping well\n\nIs gaining weight\n\nHas a good NAS score\n\nAfter your baby is home, take her to all of her follow-up and well-baby checkups, even if she’s doing well. Your provider checks your baby at these visits for problems that may be linked to NAS, like:\n\nDevelopmental delays and problems with motor and learning skills and behavior\n\nProblems with nutrition and growth\n\nProblems with hearing and vision\n\nProblems at home, including using harmful substances. This can include misusing prescription drugs and using illegal drugs.\n\nIf your baby has developmental delays, talk to her provider about early intervention services. These services can help children from birth through 3 years old learn important skills. Services include therapy to help a child talk, walk, learn self-help skills and interact with others. Getting services as early as possible can help improve your child’s development. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has information to help you get early intervention services for your child and how to find services in your state or territory.\n\nWhat can you do to help prevent NAS in your baby?\n\nHere’s what you can do:\n\nIf you’re pregnant and you use any of the drugs that can cause NAS, tell your provider right away, but don’t stop taking the drug without getting treatment from your provider first. Quitting suddenly (sometimes called cold turkey) can cause severe problems for your baby, including death. If you need help to quit using these drugs, talk to your provider about treatment. Getting treatment can help you stop using drugs and is safer for your baby than getting no treatment at all.\n\nIf you’re pregnant and can’t stop using opioids without problems, ask your provider about medication-assisted treatment (also called MAT). NAS in babies may be easier to treat for babies whose moms get MAT during pregnancy. Medicines used in MAT include methadone and buprenorphine.\n\nIf you’re pregnant and you go to a provider who prescribes medicine to treat a health condition, make sure that provider knows you’re pregnant. You may need to stop taking certain medicines or change to medicine that’s safer for your baby. Ask all your health care providers if the medicine you take—even prescription drugs—can cause NAS in your baby. Even if you use a prescription drug exactly as your provider tells you to, it may cause NAS in your baby.\n\nIf you’re pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant, tell your provider about any drugs or medicine you take. Your provider can make sure that what you’re taking is safe for you and your baby. She also can help you get treatment for using street drugs or abusing prescription drugs if you need it. If you abuse prescription drugs, it means you take more than has been prescribed for you, you take someone else’s prescription drug, or you get the drug from someone without a prescription.\n\nIf you’re not pregnant and you use any drug that can cause NAS: Use birth control until you’re ready to get pregnant. Birth control (also called contraception or family planning) helps keep you from getting pregnant. Examples include intrauterine devices (also called IUDs), implants, the pill and condoms.\n\nMore information\n\nMother to Baby\n\nSubstance Abuse Treatment Facility Locator\n\nSee also: Preventing NAS in your baby infographic, Caring for a baby with NAS infographic, Prescription opioids during pregnancy, Prescription medicine during pregnancy\n\nLast reviewed: June, 2019"
