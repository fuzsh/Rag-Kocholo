        "text": "Sweet Chick, the New York chicken and waffles restaurant backed by rapper Nas, makes its London debut.\n\nRaised\n\nRaised\n\nin New York as a child of Irish immigrants, the Sweet\n\nChick founder John Seymour grew up on stews and roasts.\n\nAfter-school hangs with his father, a bartender, meant homework\n\ntime was fuelled by homemade burgers consumed barside.\n\nToday, John Seymour’s food staples (and palette) have realigned.\n\nAt Sweet Chick, his New York-based fried-chicken joint, the\n\nhallmark dish is fried chicken and waffles drenched in maple syrup.\n\nA plate linked to the South, its origins can be traced to the\n\nAfrican-American jazz clubs of New York’s\n\nHarlem.\n\nThat tidbit, and many other foodie facts, was gathered while\n\ntaste-testing Sweet Chick’s lengthy menu ahead of it’s London\n\nlaunch. Read on for more chicken-related content (don’t even\n\npretend that’s not a regular in your Google search).\n\nIn conversation with Sweet Chick founder, John Seymour\n\nTell us about Sweet Chick; how did it come about and where did the name come from?\n\nAfter learning the New York origin story of Chicken and Waffles, I was inspired to open a neighbourhood spot that highlights and elevates the dish, while building a full-service restaurant around it. As we were testing a number of brines, we found that adding sweet tea to the brine process gave our recipe a perfect taste balance. While thinking about sweet tea and the sweetness of maple syrup someone said “Sweet Chick” and it just stuck.\n\nRapper Nas was an early backer of Sweet Chick, tell us about your partnership…\n\nNas is the soundtrack of NYC and legend worldwide, so for me it was unreal that he wanted to get involved. It really convinced me that we had built something special at Sweet Chick. His support and love for the brand inspires us all to keep striving for greatness in every aspect. But it’s more than a partnership, its a community that we have around the restaurant from our staff, friends and guests; and Nas is part of that, which is really cool.\n\nWhat are your childhood food memories?\n\nGrowing up in NY you are introduced to so many flavour profiles at a young age. I mostly remember eating stews and roasts at home as my parents are Irish immigrants. My father was a bartender and I spent a lot of time after school hanging with him doing homework on the bar and eating his homemade burgers. Those are probably the staple meals of my childhood.\n\nThe restaurant’s hallmark dish, fried chicken and waffles, is linked to the South but also to African-American jazz clubs of New York’s Harlem. Can you tell us a bit more about the origins of this dish…\n\nIn the 20s at M Wells in Harlem, a jazz musician finished his set late at night and went into the kitchen. The musician wasn’t sure if he wanted breakfast or dinner so the chef said:“I have fried chicken left over and I can make a waffle.” And so, chicken and waffles were born.\n\nDo you view chicken and waffles primarily as a breakfast dish? What are some other solid breakfast orders on the Sweet Chick’s menu?\n\nIt is truly a dish that can be eaten anytime. We have a bunch of breakfast/ brunch options, from ricotta pancakes to veggie hash with fried eggs and we are always testing new dishes.\n\nBest food spots in New York…\n\nIt really depends on what you’re craving at the time. In NY you can find good food in almost every neighbourhood – from hole-in-the-wall spots to fine dining. I typically eat in Downtown, Manhattan and Brooklyn.\n\nAnd LA…\n\nStop at the first taco truck you see.\n\nYou’ve New York locations in Williamsburg, Long Island, Queens and the Lower East Side. How do you choose your locations and where might you open up next in NYC?\n\nI have always chosen locations with a gut instinct, and being from NY helps a lot when you are familiar with the place. We don’t currently have plans to open any more spots in NYC, but never say never.\n\nFive of the best places to order fried chicken in the US…\n\nWow, thats hard. I’m still testing. Check back in 5–10 years; by then I will have eaten at every fried chicken place in America.\n\nOther food cities worth visiting…\n\nIn the US: New Orleans, Nashville, Austin and San Francisco.\n\nWhere are your favourite places to eat in London?\n\nI haven’t had enough time and will be trying a lot more places in the coming months but for now: Blacklock, Gloria, Kricket, Smokestak and my Aunt Madeline’s house for an amazing Sunday Roast.\n\nWhat would be your last meal?\n\nHonestly, if I die walking down a NY street with a slice of pizza in my hand I will probably be content with life I’ve lived.\n\nWhat are you reading at the moment?\n\nShoe Dog by Phil Knight.\n\nWhat podcasts and TV shows are downloaded for your next flight?\n\nThe Joe Rogan Experience. I’m also rewatching Peaky Blinders on my way to London.\n\nWhat would you do to improve airplane food?\n\nReheated food never really works so I would suggest a raw food menu.\n\nAnd finally, what’s in your SUITCASE?\n\nNew white Nike Air Force 1’s, a few go-to outfits and lots of room so I can fill it with shopping.\n\nDiscover More\n\nBloody Marys and Pop-Up Supper Clubs with Chef Ellen Parr"
