        "meta_description": "Queensbridge is the largest government-housing scheme in the US. The building opened in 1939 to house lower income families. In terms of its initial architectural structure, Queensbridge is designed to capture natural sunlight, and is a modernist state-funded venture typical of its time. This article considers the formative modernist design of Queensbridge as a backdrop to the hip-hop artist Nas’s 1994 masterpiece Illmatic. Illmatic is the focus of recent academic studies, many of which hail Nas for the formal ingenuity of his lyrics and his songs’ implicit socio-political content: the content of which deals with the systematic perpetration of criminality among black youth in the post-Reagan period. Nas’s quasi-realist account of growing up in Queensbridge, his immersion in a life of crime, to his discovery of hip-hop as an art form, has since assumed legendary status. The article considers Illmatic from the perspective of ‘time’ in two specific contexts. The first takes empirical reality as its concern, exploring the album’s coming-of-age narrative as a story about growing up in the poverty of the New York ghetto. A second iteration, the second strand, concerns anti-eschatological renderings of time. Taking this second strand to be an iteration of ‘utopian time,’ the analysis turns to Lucy Sargisson’s transgressive utopianism. Illmatic, I argue, instantiates the coming-into-being of Nas as subject and furnishes the tools to critically transgress categorical binds involved in representing subjectivity. Illmatic is an album about representation and its utopian critique.",

        "text": "I don’t believe in that shit, your facts are backwards,\n\nNas, Represent\n\nIllmatic is the 1994 debut album of the Queensbridge rapper Nas (Nasir Bin Olu Dara Jones). Nas rose to prominence on the East Coast hip-hop scene in the early nineties. In his early teens he secured a prestigious record contract that saw him team up with some of the most innovative producers working in New York City at the time: Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip and MC Serch (just some of the noteworthy contributors on an album that has been hailed as the greatest hip-hop album of all time). The content of Nas’s lyrics however, in addition to the ‘flow’ of his lyrics, is as innovative as the near cinematic rendering of Nas’s home in Queensbridge, the oldest social housing project in the history of US social policy.\n\nQueensbridge is therefore a site of historical import, a product of the US government’s social housing policy (the project opened in 1939 for lower income families). The building is ‘Y’ based in its design and is intended (in its innovative architectural form) to capture sunlight. It is also future-oriented in its concern with heat efficiency and health (Giurgiulescu, 2013). The now iconic cover photograph for Illmatic is an image of a child Nas against the looming Queensbridge projects (Figure 1). The cover is intended to underscore the potential criminalization of the child Nas (the mugshot) as an adult, while documenting a soon to be subject of New York City’s social housing projects. The Queensbridge project is, therefore—as a building and a place within New York City—writ large over the multi-layered textural fabric of Illmatic.\n\nQueensbridge is the focal point of Illmatic. The album reads as a series of commentaries on growing up in in the projects, the allure of crime and drugs, and the violence that is formative to such black US communities. In the tradition of coming-of-age novels such as Jack Kerouac’s On the Road (1957) and James Baldwin’s Go Tell it on the Mountain (1953)—and from the Biblical referencing on the opening track ‘The Genesis,’ to the parting shot reference to the religious group Five Percenters in the final song ‘It Ain’t Hard to Tell’—Illmatic is a visceral account of ghetto life (an environment defined by an intersection of illegal drugs, gangs and crime). Indeed, Illmatic has been championed as a realist text: a harrowing account of the projects in the aftermath of a drug epidemic: in the late 80s, crack cocaine infiltrated black working-class communities to an unprecedented degree.1 In ‘Who’s Using and Who’s Doing the Time: Incarceration, the War on Drugs and Public Health’ (2008), an essay exploring drug-abuse and prison in black communities such as Queensbridge, Lisa D. Moore and Amy Elkavich make the following claim:\n\nIn 1996, Blacks constituted 62.6% of drug offenders in state prisons. Nationwide, the rate of persons admitted to prison on drug charges for Black men is 13 times that for White men, and in 10 states, the rates are 26 to 57 times those for White men. People of color are not more likely to do drugs; Black men do not have an abnormal predilection for intoxication. They are, however, more likely to be arrested and prosecuted for their use. (Moore and Elkavich, 2008).\n\nThis study bears upon Illmatic as a document of the nineties; of a time when the violence in black communities reached crisis levels. The album therefore reads as an account of growing up in such harrowing conditions (indeed it reads as an auto-ethnographic account of a life). Looked upon as a document of the ghetto as researched by Moore and Elkavich, Illmatic reads as a realist text, designed to immerse the listener in the reality of Queensbridge (borne of an empirical understanding of place). However, given the focus on time over the course of the album, Illmatic also reads as an album on which there are multiple iterations of time. This article explores two such iterations. On the one hand is, I argue, empirical time—Nas’s time growing up in Queensbridge—a time measured according to a common state rubric ‘visualisin’ the reality of life in actuality’ (Nas, 1994). Nas must push against the tides of conformity to represent a world contrary to the given (‘the facts’). Time, seen in this case as a rubric of state oppression, is the subject of ‘One Love’ and ‘N.Y. State of Mind,’ and most explicitly the melancholic ‘Life’s a Bitch.’ Time, in these instances, manifests as a struggle to survive in the ghetto.2 As Clyde Woods points out, ‘the creation of education wastelands; the denial of access to subsistence programs; the failure of subsistence programs to meet basic needs…the spatially/racially contingent application of the law; mass incarceration; occupational segregation’ (Woods 2002; 64) are problems endemic to African-American communities like Queensbridge, and need to be classified as human rights violations. These rhymes, about the mass incarceration Woods sees as human rights violations, present ‘doing time’ as a default position for those who live in the Queensbridge ghetto: ‘I set it off with my own rhyme, cause I’m as ill as a convict who kills for phone time’ (Nas, 1994). Time, in this iteration, concerns the struggle to live and survive the ghetto; the struggle involved in representing the subjects of Queensbridge.\n\nA second iteration of time runs concurrent to the first. Where the first involves reporting on the conditions of the Queensbridge projects in an attempt to represent the subjects of Queensbridge, it concerns a time transgressive of categories of representation. It is a time that opens new possibilities for representation: ‘time is illmatic’ (Nas, 1994). This article focuses on these iterations of time. Illmatic is first explored as a realist coming-of-age narrative about growing up in Queensbridge, before the discussion is oriented towards an analysis of Illmatic’s time in the context of the utopian. Taking the realization and representation of subjectivity as the premise of the realist strand, the second iteration focuses on time in relation to the messianic and utopian. I explore the ‘subject’ in the first section as a contingent subject. However, in doing so, I read Illmatic as a text concerning the impulse to represent the subject of Queensbridge—contingent to a place and time—running alongside a utopian concern with transgressing representational categories in poetic processes (the utopian, in this instance, transgresses pre-existing representational categories).\n\nIn the first comprehensive collection of essays on the legacy of Illmatic, Born to Use Mics: Reading Nas’s Illmatic (2009) (and the first text in a series dedicated to hip-hop as a legitimate subject of academic critique), Sohail Daulatzai notes ‘there is something about Illmatic that transcends the categories that have ever existed about hip-hop. Something complex about its simplicity, something elusive that we felt we wanted to explore’ (Daulatzai & Dyson 2009; 3). Daulatzai draws on the ‘illusive’ for a certain sensibility not yet classified as official knowledge and hence resistant to naming or definitive conceptualization. His comment, however throwaway it might seem, intrigues. He identifies in Illmatic something that resists rudimentary attempts to classify the album.\n\nRonald A.T. Judy, meanwhile, offers two ways to situate Illmatic within contemporary developments in hip-hop. On the one hand, Illmatic is part of a new turn in the ‘morally legitimate tradition of resistance’ (Judy 1994; 216). The tradition in question is black emancipatory politics. On the other hand, and offering a pre-echo of Daulatzai’s argument, Judy finds ‘a kind of utopian historicism that is grounded in the concept of the morally legitimate tradition of African American resistance to dehumanizing commodification’ (Judy 1994; 216). Both observations offer important contexts for Illmatic, in that the album can be seen to reflect 90s black American culture in its implicit concerns with time. From the late 80s accelerationist-infused Detroit Techno—designed for a future-less perpetual present—to the Afro-Futurist literature of the 1990s, a strand of black American culture was focused on temporality, or at least alternate experiences of time.3 The concern with time outside dominant expressive forms finds its way into hop-hip culture too, most forcibly, I argue in Nas’s work of this period. Illmatic, I argue in the following sections, crystalizes this concern with time into two explicit strands: the realist and utopian.\n\nThe Utopian Imperative\n\nIt is something of a myth, Matthew Gasteier notes, that ‘It Ain’t Hard to Tell’ is the first recording of the Illmatic sessions (Gasteier 2009; 95). The song has a backstory, in that, mythologised as the first recorded song, it is last on the listings. From a Blochian perspective, ‘It Ain’t Hard to Tell’ is a song that challenges facts—already deemed backwards—from a more radically temporal point of view; in this case, as a new creative genesis. The sampling of Michael Jackson’s disco track ‘Human Nature’ is significant. Jackson, the inveterate ‘king of pop,’ comes into the mix after ‘Represent,’ a song that heralds the realisation of subjectivity as that which can be represented while alluding to the transgression of petty street crime: ‘if it wasn’t hanging out in front of cocaine spots, we was in the candy factory, breaking the locks’ (Nas, 1994). Following ‘Represent’ Illmatic therefore transitions into a song implicitly concerned with transgressing the same existing representational categories. The second iteration of time is now readily apparent. Nas shifts the focus from the coming to consciousness of the contingent Queensbridge subject to lyrics which concern a ‘time’ of transgression per se. As such, the album moves from the lyrical celebration of transgressive criminal activities in the past—the activities that typify the day-to-day reality of living in Queensbridge—to a ‘now’ that is indicative of the transgressive potentiality of time itself. This ‘now’ is neither explicit as past nor future, but what makes both possible. ‘Now,’ understood through the lens of Blochian time, is that genesis that marks the first song that is now explicit in the last.\n\n‘It Ain’t Hard to Tell’ brings the coming-of-age narrative of Illmatic to an end. The narrative concludes with Nas discovering representation. ‘Represent’ concerns Nas’s discovery of rap lyricism as a form of poetry and a subsequent vehicle of representation. The song’s chorus, made up of a group shouting the words ‘represent, represent,’ is the coming to consciousness of the subaltern group in rhymes that reach a dizzying crescendo. The song is about representing the Queensbridge underclass Nas identifies with, with Nas himself assuming the mantel of king rapper for this group. The high tempo, hard-hitting beats give way to the lower tempo sample-infused ‘It Ain’t Hard to Tell.’ In addition, Nas takes a different point of critique: ‘they analyze me, surprise me, but can’t magnetize me’ (Nas, 1994). Having discovered the power of representation, Nas now discovers a time of its inveterate critique ‘scanning while you’re planning ways to sabotage me, I leave ‘em froze like heroin in your nose, Nas’ll rock well, it ain’t hard to tell’ (Nas, 1994). Time, in this iteration, takes the form of a ‘now’ transforming what has already come to consciousness; utopian as a genesis for ‘as yet’ unformulated categories (in terms of the representational process). ‘It Ain’t Hard to Tell’ therefore marks the second iteration of time; an iteration that runs in a complementary fashion to the realist strand.\n\n‘It Ain’t Hard to Tell’ also differs in tone from ‘Represent’. The lyrical flow, coupled with the disco-infused sample of Michael Jackson’s ‘Human Nature,’ is hence rhythmically different. Nas now contends he ‘is like the Afro-centric Asian, half-man half-amazing’ (Nas, 1994), referencing the Five Per Centers’ conviction that they are chosen, while transgressing racial categories inscribed in ‘Man,’ ‘Asian,’ and ‘Afro.’ Poetry, as hip-hop, relies on categories of representation, while inculcating new modes of subjective being. Nas claims on ‘It Ain’t Hard to Tell’ that ‘niggaz is frozen,’ before saying that he’ll ‘begin like a violin and end like Leviathan’ (Nas, 1994). The leviathan is a reference to a mythical sea creature, which has Biblical resonance in fashioning order from chaos at the end of time. Hip-hop poetry can have a defrosting effect, in breaking up representational categories, all the while transgressive of these same categories.\n\nThis understanding of poetry shares similarities with the utopianism of Lucy Sargisson, expressed in her text Utopian Bodies and the Politics of Transgression (2000). ‘The function of trangressive utopian thinking,’ Sargisson states, is ‘to both provoke and permit paradigm shifts in consciousness: thus enabling real sustainable change to be conceivable’ (Sargisson 2000; 67). Sargisson’s utopianism is a call to open up transgressive spaces of critique, and is given form by Nas’s instantiation of representation and critique of it (the changing consensus on the album from representation as illmatic to time as illmatic). Time, in this second iteration, is transgressive, in Sargisson’s sense of the term, in that it overhauls representational categories contingent to place and time (‘black rats trapped’). It is the genesis, utopian in this regard, that Bloch invests in a time involved in fashioning a homeland for all. For this reason, Queensbridge, the key reference point on the album, is both the ghetto that traps the young Nas and the futural homeland Bloch associates with the utopian.\n\nThis second iteration therefore complements Illmatic’s coming-of-age story, making explicit two of the album’s iterations of time. Songs such as ‘N.Y. State of Mind’ and ‘One Time for Your Mind,’ just two examples, focus on the lived reality of the Queensbridge projects. They communicate what it is like to be a subject in the dangerous and often-treacherous reality Woods calls ‘racially defined zones of destruction’ (Woods 2002; 63). To grow up in zones like these is to sleep with one eye open. The second iteration, in tandem with this strand of time, is indicative of the ‘now’ of transgression. It is an iteration, this article has argued, of a time that overhauls representational categories contingent to a place and time. Illmatic is, no doubt, an album concerned with discovering the power of representational categories. However, it is also an album that amplifies the paradigm shifts required to make a genesis of ‘past’ and ‘future;’ one that qualifies as a homeland, or a homeland for all.\n\nNotes\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nA special word of thanks is extended to David Bell for extensive editorial support (in addition to two invaluable peer reviews).
