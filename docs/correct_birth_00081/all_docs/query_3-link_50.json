        "text": "SciTech Connect: DOE Scientific and Technical Information\n\nSciTech Connect connects you to science, technology, and engineering research information from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).This site provides links to full texts, citations, datasets, patents, multimedia and software in various fields related to science and technology and the topics of interest related to DOE's mission. . The site has video tutorials to teach users how to search for the subjects covered by SciTech Connect. Documents are primarily from 1991 forward and have been produced by DOE, the DOE contractor community, and/or DOE grantees. Legacy documents are added as they become available in electronic format.\n\nMednar : Deep Web Medical Search\n\nMednar is a free, medically-focused deep web search interface. Mednar accelerates your research with authoritative public and deep web resources, returning the most relevant results to one easily navigable page. Unlike Google, a Mednar search occurs in real-time to retrieve relevant information. Mednar, the publicly available search engine interface cannot retrieve results from subscription based databases or premium medical resources.\n\nNational Academy of Sciences\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is a private, non-profit society of distinguished scholars. Established in 1863, the NAS is charged with providing independent, objective advice to the nation on matters related to science and technology. Nearly 500 members of the NAS are Nobel Prize Winners. The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, founded in 1914 and an NSA publication is one of the premier international journals publishing the results of original research.\n\nScience.gov: Advanced Search\n\nScience.gov is a portal that offers free access to research and development (R&D) results and scientific and technical information from scientific organizations across 13 federal agencies. Users can search over 60 databases, over 2,200 websites, and over 200 million pages of authoritative federal science information in many formats, including full-text documents, citations, scientific data supporting federally funded research, and multimedia.In addition, Science.gov now offers information from across the federal government on education and training opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields for undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nScienceResearch.com - One Search. Superior Science.\n\nScienceResearch.com is a free, publicly available deep web search engine that uses advanced \"federated search technology\" to return high quality results by submitting your search query - in real-time - to other well respected search engines then collating, ranking and dropping duplicates of the results.\n\nVideoLectures.NET\n\nVideoLectures.NET is an award-winning free and open access educational video lectures repository. The lectures are given by distinguished scholars and scientists at the most important and prominent events like conferences, summer schools, workshops and science promotional events from many fields of Science. The portal is aimed at promoting science, exchanging ideas and fostering knowledge sharing by providing high quality didactic contents not only to the scientific community but also to the general public. All lectures, accompanying documents, information and links are systematically selected and classified through the editorial process taking into account also users' comments.\n\nWorldWideScience: The Global Science Gateway\n\nIt is a global science gateway comprised of national and international scientific databases and portals that accelerates scientific discovery and progress by providing one-stop searching of databases from around the world. This multilingual portal is able to provide real-time searching and translation of globally-dispersed multilingual scientific literature. On behalf of the WorldWideScience Alliance, WorldWideScience.org was developed and is maintained by the Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI), an element of the Office of Science within the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nNational Center for Science and Engineering Statistics\n\nThe National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) is the nation's leading provider of statistical data on the U.S. science and engineering enterprise. This website contains data on research and development, the science and engineering workforce, the condition and progress of STEM education, and U.S. competitiveness in science, engineering, technology, and R&D. Two Key publications are: Science and Engineering Indicators and Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering.\n\nCharles Darwin's Library - Biodiversity Heritage Library\n\nCharles Darwin’s Library is a digital edition and virtual reconstruction of the surviving books owned by Charles Darwin. This BHL special collection draws on original copies and surrogates from other libraries. It also provides full transcriptions of his annotations and marks. In this first release (2011) we provide 330 of the 1480 titles in his library, concentrating on the most heavily annotated books.\n\nEinstein Archives Online\n\nA joint project of the Albert Einstein Archives, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Einstein Papers Project and the California Institute of Technology and the Princeton University Press. online access to Albert Einstein’s scientific and non-scientific manuscripts held by the Albert Einstein Archives at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, constituting the material record of one of the most influential intellects in the modern era. It also enables access to the Einstein Archive Database, a comprehensive source of information on all items in the Albert Einstein Archives. Free viewing and browsing of 7,000 high-quality digitized images of Einstein's writings.\n\nLinus Pauling and the Race for DNA: A Documentary History - Special Collections - Oregon State University\n\nUtilizing over 300 scanned documents, photographs, audio clips and video excerpts, this website narrates the breathless details of the pursuit of the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA. Scattered throughout the project are images of a number of very important and extremely rare items, most of which are held within the Oregon State University Libraries' Ava Helen and Linus Pauling Papers, and many of which have not been previously displayed.\n\nProfiles in Science: The Rosalind Franklin Papers\n\nNational Library of Medicine. Rosalind Elsie Franklin (1920-1958) was a British chemist and crystallographer who is best known for her role in the discovery of the structure of DNA. It was her x-ray diffraction photos of DNA and her analysis of that data--provided to Francis Crick and James Watson without her knowledge--that gave them clues crucial to building their correct theoretical model of the molecule in 1953. While best known for this work, Franklin also did important research into the micro-structure and properties of coals and other carbons, and spent the last five years of her career elucidating the structure of plant viruses, notably tobacco mosaic virus."
