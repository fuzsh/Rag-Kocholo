        "text": "Below are my 3 favorite get-rich-quick schemes Rich = Perspective, Knowledge, and Joy ðŸŒŽ 1) Perspective: Go abroad for a few months. Not talking about an all-inclusive weekend in Cancun. Talking about somewhere completely DIFFERENT. For me, India, Japan, and South Africa are at the top of my list. For you, no clue where that'd be, but at least make it spicy. Something new. Within a few weeks, you'll learn more about a culture and yourself than you have in YEARS. I promise this because you'll naturally be forced to adjust to new surroundings, societal norms, foods, language, music, dance, sports, etc. Here are a few examples I've personally encountered over the years... ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· Argentina - Greetings start with a kiss on the cheek, Yerba Mate is sacred ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazil - Jam to Bossa Nova and Brazilian Funk, football is religion ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ Colombia - Birthplace of Salsa, dancing is in everyone's blood ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany - Even $1.50 beer is delicious, naked sauna is the norm ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italy - Leaving a full plate on the table is rude, dinner lasts hours With perspective, you can develop empathy, expand your thinking, and gain clarity on who you are. ðŸ§  2) Knowledge: Forget graduate school. Take a bootcamp or an online course. If you're looking for a career change into analytics, coding, or design, there are hundreds of bootcamps (e.g., General Assembly, Flatiron School) out there. I have six friends who, in only 4 to 6 months, were able to change their careers, be happier, and earn more. Now that's a fast turnaround. If you want to learn a ton in a few hours, take an online course. I've taken a copywriting course from Shaan Puri, and a video editing course from Nas Daily Studios. Learned faster than I ever would from a book or YouTube video. ðŸ˜Š 3) Joy: This one's simple, but anytime I break a sweat, aka exercise, I'm happier. That's not just me. In a 4 week study of 217 subjects that were divided into three levels of physical activity (active, beginner, inactive), there was a strong relationship between well-being and physical activity. Active people showed higher levels of happiness, self-esteem, and life satisfaction compared to beginners and inactive people. So next time you need a mood boost, break a sweat. *** And now it's time to get rich. Try some of these strategies out yourself. Don't avoid starting because it'll take too long. As Einstein said, \"Time is an illusion.\" Don't put limits on yourself.\n\nAnimations make the impossible possible! It is impossible for us to record 100s of time-lapse videos to show how vegetables grow over 100s of days. It is impossible for us to use satellite footages for every video to show you zoomed out versions of whole countries. It is impossible for us to keep you hooked to our videos when we're explaining numbers, history, or stats. But ANIMATION - makes all of this easier - and this video is a great example of HOW! â—½ We used animation to show how BIG vegetables can grow. Animation helped us to provide scale and show the process of growth, which made it easier to visualize our story. â—½ Animation helped us show you the location of the country we were filming so that you can better relate to it! â—½ Lastly, engaging animations make the boring numbers and stats SO interesting. They move fast, they look cool, and they do the job! Animations are a lot of hard work - but in the end it's all worth it. This video touched around 4M people across 4 platforms - and that's how it proves that the better the animations - the BIGGER the numbers!"
