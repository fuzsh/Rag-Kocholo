        "text": "Do not pretend that things will change if we always do the same. The crisis is the best blessing that can happen to people and countries, because the crisis brings progress. Creativity is born from the distress, as the day is born from the dark night. It is in crisis that invention, discovery and large strategies are born.Who ever overcomes crisis, outdoes himself without being overcome.\n\nWho attributes their failures to the crisis and neglects, violent his own talent and gives most respect to the problems rather than solutions. The real crisis is the crisis of incompetence. The drawback of people and countries is laziness to find solutions to their problems. without crisis there are no challenges, without challenges life is a routine, a slow agony. without crisis there is no merit. It is in the crisis where the best of each other rise up, without crises any wind is caress. Talk of crisis is to promote it, and silent in the crisis is to exalt conformity. Instead of that, work hard. Get it over with the only crises threatening, that is the tragedy of not wanting to fight for it."
