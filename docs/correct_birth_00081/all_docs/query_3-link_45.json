It also includes exemplary and innovative works in the biography and memoirs genre.\n\nThe Collection is held on open access shelves in the Group Study Room, which is situated on the Lower Floor of the Library. All items in the Biography Collection are borrowable.\n\nThe primary aim is to provide informative, accessible, and well-written books about important figures in history and of today for students’ leisure and pleasure reading, and of course for study purposes as well.

They form part of the larger General Interest Collection located within the Group Study Room. The listing below provides the subject (or subjects) of the biography, the shelfmark of the book, and its title.\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe Library’s copies of Autobiography: A Very Short Introduction (also online) and Biography: A Very Short Introduction (likewise online) provide very useful and engaging guides to what autobiography and biography are and what they do.\n\nThe Library holds in the Group Study Room the 60-volume Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, for reference-use only (REF/DNB); this major biographical dictionary is available online as well.\n\nOther online resources available to New College students and staff, which are useful in particular for quick-reference purposes, include:\n\nAmerican National Biography\n\nAustralian Dictionary of Biography\n\nDansk Biografisk Leksikon\n\nDeutsche Biographie\n\nDictionary of African Biography\n\nDictionary of Canadian Biography\n\nDictionary of Irish Biography\n\nDictionary of Literary Biography\n\nDictionary of New Zealand Biography\n\nDictionary of Welsh Biography\n\nDizionario Biografico degli Italiani\n\nNationaal Biografisch Woordenboek (Belgium)\n\nWho’s Who and Who Was Who\n\nWorld Biographical Information System"
