Einstein was a German-born physicist and scientist who developed the theory of general relativity in 1915, which re-formulated the concept of gravity. In 1921, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work explaining the photoelectric effect and contributions to theoretical physics, not for his theory of relativity which was not fully understood at the time. Einstein is considered the most popular scientist of the 20th century.\n\nALbert Einstein.pptx\n\nALbert Einstein.pptxMatthewNithilan\n\nAlbert Einstein was born in Germany in 1879 and is known for his groundbreaking work in physics. In his \"miracle year\" of 1905, he produced four papers that changed physics forever, including work on the photoelectric effect and special relativity. Throughout his career, Einstein received numerous honors for his scientific achievements, including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. He later became a U.S. citizen while retaining his Swiss citizenship and spent his later life lecturing and continuing his scientific research until his death in 1955.\n\nAlbert einstein\n\nAlbert einsteinkebe94\n\nAlbert Einstein was born in Germany in 1879 and later became a Swiss citizen. He developed the theory of relativity and the famous equation E=mc2. He immigrated to the United States in 1933 due to his renouncement of German citizenship for political reasons. Einstein held positions at several universities and made significant contributions to physics, including his theories of relativity and work on photon theory and statistical mechanics. He received many honors for his scientific work including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Einstein spent his later years in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955.\n\nAlbert einstein\n\nAlbert einsteinkebe94\n\nAlbert Einstein was born in Germany in 1879 and later became a Swiss citizen.

It describes Whitcomb Judson's invention of the zipper in 1893. It also summarizes the discovery of radioactivity by Antoine Henri Becquerel in 1896, when he discovered that uranium salts emitted invisible and penetrating rays capable of exposing photographic plates even in the dark. Additionally, it discusses the discovery of DNA in the early 1950s by Francis Crick and James Watson at Cambridge University and Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin at King's College in London.\n\nK0526068\n\nThis document provides a summary of Nobel Laureates in Physics from 1901 to 2013. It lists each laureate's name, birthplace, years of life, and a brief description of their award-winning work. Some key highlights include Wilhelm Rontgen being awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his discovery of X-rays, Albert Einstein winning in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect and theory of relativity, and Indian physicist C.V. Raman winning in 1930 for his discovery of the Raman effect. The document continues in chronological order through the 20th century, covering major discoveries such as the neutron, quantum mechanics, and the transistor effect.\n\nAswathy\n\n1. Albert Einstein developed the theories of special and general relativity and made many important contributions to the development of modern physics. He published groundbreaking papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, and the existence and behavior of atoms. 2. Einstein held academic positions in Switzerland and Germany. He was a director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin and a professor at Princeton University. He received many honors for his revolutionary scientific work including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. 3. Einstein is considered one of the most influential scientists of all time. He revolutionized our understanding of space, time, mass, and energy with his theories of relativity and he helped lay the foundation for modern physics with his work on quantum\n\nalbert EINSTEIN\n\nalbert EINSTEINpimpinboygenius\n\n- Albert Einstein was born in Germany in 1879 and is considered one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century. - In his \"miracle year\" of 1905, the 26-year-old Einstein published four groundbreaking papers, including his paper on the photoelectric effect which won him the Nobel Prize and his theory of special relativity which introduced his famous equation E=mc2. - Einstein's work was instrumental in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and he is renowned for his intellectual achievements as well as his pacifist views.\n\nGreat scientists\n\nGreat scientists sharamarcose\n\nThis document profiles several famous scientists and their contributions, including Niels Bohr and his model of the atom's structure, Albert Einstein and his theories of relativity and E=mc2, Henri Becquerel's discovery of natural radiation in uranium, Enrico Fermi's work leading to nuclear fission, Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the nucleus through alpha particle scattering experiments, and Marie Curie's discovery and isolation of radium and polonium, for which she received two Nobel Prizes.
