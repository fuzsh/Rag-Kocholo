        "text": "WKCR announces an overnight birthday broadcast jointly celebrating Fiona Apple and Nas, broadcast on FM and HD radio and online from 10 PM on Wednesday, September 13th to 6 AM on Thursday, September 14th. The special broadcast will run from Nueva Cancion until one hour into Thursdayâ€™s Daybreak Express. The broadcast will preempt all regularly scheduled Wednesday night early Thursday morning shows.\n\nFiona Apple, born September 13, 1977, in New York City, is an award-winning singer-songwriter who began her career composing original music at 8 years old. Her debut album, Tidal, was released in 1996 when she was just 18 years old, and since then, Apple has established herself as a force within the music industry. Her latest album Fetch the Bolt Cutters, released in 2020, is proof that her power is embedded in her vulnerability, and as she frees herself from the shackles of expectations and past trauma, we find her unwavering, audacious, and unapologetic in her demand to be heard. From her vulnerability and authenticity to her lyrical prowess and the experimental and unyielding nature of her sound, it's impossible to ignore her influence.\n\nNasir bin Olu Dara Jones, born September 14, 1973, and better known as Nas, is regarded as one of the most influential rappers of all time. Hailing from Brooklyn, his lyrical technique and production skill have earned him the universal acclaim he has received. His debut album, Illmatic, was released in 1994 and is regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop albums in history, even being inducted into the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry. His unique style of storytelling and masterful ability to paint vivid pictures with his rhymes has made a lasting impact on hip-hop that extends beyond his artistry and has influenced an entire generation of rappers."
