        "text": "Background\n\nSince 2010, the rate of opioid overdose deaths for females of reproductive age, 18 to 44 years old, has tripled in NYS, from 4.2 per 100,000, to 12.7 per 100,000 in 2016.1 Further, the rate of newborns with neonatal withdrawal symptoms and/or affected by maternal use of drugs of addiction was 9.6 cases per 1,000 live births in 2018.2 In response, the New York State Department of Health's New York State Perinatal Quality Collaborative (NYSPQC) led the NYS OUD in Pregnancy & NAS Project. The project's goal was to improve care for both birthing persons with OUD and infants with NAS. The project's pilot phase began in September 2018 with 14 participating birthing hospitals. In October 2020, following the success of the pilot phase, the project was expanded to include an additional 25 NYS birthing hospitals.\n\nOverview (PDF)\n\nNew York State Opioid Data Dashboard\n\nPilot Project Results\n\nDuring the pilot phase of the NYS OUD in Pregnancy & NAS Project, between September 2018 and November 2020, the percentage of participating birthing hospitals with:\n\nA universal screening protocol for OUD increased by 238% from 21% in place to 71% in place; and\n\nA protocol or process flow to assess and link pregnant people with OUD to support services increased by 119%, from 36% in place to 79% in place.\n\nBy the end of the pilot phase, all hospitals put in place standardized pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic guidelines for newborns with opioid exposure.\n\nOpioid Use Disorder in Pregnancy\n\nNYSPQC Resources\n\nPatient Education – Your Pregnancy & Substance Use: Four Ways to Get and Stay Healthier\n\nEnglish (0737)\n\nSpanish (0739)\n\nChinese (0738)\n\nHaitian-Creole (0740)\n\nKorean (0754)\n\nRussian (0755)\n\nBengali (0756)\n\nYiddish (0757)\n\nProvider Education – Perinatal Substance Use: Five Ways You Can Improve Care During Pregnancy & Beyond\n\nEnglish (0735)\n\nSpanish (0736)\n\nNaloxone Educational Brochure\n\nIndividual Patient (19815)\n\nFamilies (19828)\n\nOther Resources\n\nACOG District II: OUD in Pregnancy Resources | ACOG\n\nNYS Authorized Syringe Exchange Programs Site Locations & Hours of Operations\n\nNYSDOH Drug User Health Hub Contacts (for Referrals)\n\nNYSDOH AIDS Institute Recommendations for Improving Language and Establishing Stigma-Free, Supporting, Service Delivery Environments\n\nWebinar Resources\n\nNYSDOH NYSPQC and ACOG District II Webinar: Opioid Use Disorder in Pregnancy Readiness, Recognition & Prevention | NICHQ - National Institute for Children's Health Quality\n\nACOG District II: SBIRT Video\n\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome\n\nResources\n\nNYSPQC Patient Resource – Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome: What You Need to Know (0722)\n\nNYSPQC Patient Resource – Newborn Care Journal (0723)\n\nProvider Education - Opioids & Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome: Language Matters\n\nEnglish (0732)\n\nSpanish (0731)\n\nProvider Education - How to Care for a Baby with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome\n\nEnglish (0733)\n\nSpanish (0734)"
