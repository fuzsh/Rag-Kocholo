        "text": "Entertainment journalist Bowen offers a new, inclusive feminism for the modern world. Weaving together searing personal essay and cultural commentary, Bowen interrogates sexism, fatphobia, and capitalism all within the context of race and hip-hop.\n\nThis memoir follows Joseph Cartagena, a Puerto Rican and Cuban kid who navigated the South Bronx during some of its darkest years and eventually—through art, friendship, luck, and will—became renowned rapper Fat Joe.\n\nThis album-by-album celebration of the life and music of Mac Miller employs oral histories, intimate reflections, and critical examinations of his enduring work, including interviews with close friends and collaborators like Wiz Kahlifa, Just Blaze, Thundercat, and more.\n\nIn this anthology, Dyson and Daulatzai bring together highly respected writers of the hip-hop generation to confront Illmatic, with each scholar assessing an individual track from the album. The result is deep engagement and incisive musical commentary.\n\nKlaess details rap’s emergence on New York City’s airwaves by examining how artists and broadcasters adapted hip-hop’s performance culture to radio, initially by buying time on community radio stations, and moving to commercial stations once their popularity was established.\n\nPatrin relates the story of how sampling built hip-hop through the work and histories of four artists—Grandmaster Flash, Prince Paul, Dr. Dre, and Madlib—as well as the people who collaborated, competed, and evolved with them.\n\nA 'New Yorker' editor interviews dozens who knew Tupac throughout his life in a thoughtful and comprehensive book that focuses on lesser-known individuals who offer fresh stories and rare insight into the artist's life and legacy.\n\nDrawing on more than 300 interviews with the DJs, executives, producers, and artists who both witnessed and themselves forged the history of hip-hop, this oral history traces how the genre grew out of the South Bronx and flowed into New York City’s other boroughs—and beyond.\n\nNoted rock photographer Peterson turns his focus to break dancing. He captures iconic performances by the era's most talented breakers, as well as the fans, the sidelines, and the camaraderie of the crews in order to put the viewer inside the world of the b-boy.\n\nEmerging alongside cyberpunk in the 1980s, the hallmarks of hip-hop—allusion, self-reference, the use of new technologies, sampling, the cutting and splicing of language and sound—would come to define the culture of the new millennium.\n\nEqual parts biography, musicology, and cultural history, Charnas chronicles the life and legacy of J Dilla, whose musical genius and influence transformed the sound of popular music for the 21st century.\n\nWu-Tang Clan created a dynasty that launched the careers of rappers RZA, GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, and more. This definitive biography of the Staten Island supergroup weaves together interviews from all the members, as well as their friends, family and collaborators to create a compelling, three-dimensional portrait.\n\nAbdurraqib traces the seminal rap group's career, explores their impact in the context of 1990s rap, and draws on his own experiences to reflect on how their distinctive sound resonated among fans like himself.\n\nIandoli pays tribute to the women of hip-hop—from the early work of Roxanne Shanté, to hitmakers like Queen Latifah and Missy Elliot, to the superstars of today—while exploring issues of gender, money, sexuality, violence, body image, and more.\n\nAs hip-hop exploded throughout NYC, a new generation was emerging—the first to be raised on the genre. At its center was the Juice Crew collective, led by radio personality Mr. Magic, who, along with his engineer Marley Marl, pioneered production techniques that reshaped hip-hop.\n\nWith exclusive, behind-the-scenes access, preeminent photographer Brother Ernie captured the last four decades of the evolution of hip-hop—the styles that grew from it, and the artists who shaped it—and shares personal anecdotes of the stories behind the photographs.\n\nRausch interviewed 24 individuals, including emcees, DJs, producers, graffiti artists, poets, and journalists. They cover the careers of each of these people and their contributions to and affiliations with hip-hop, as well as their views on different trends within the music.\n\nBased on interviews with those who knew the legendary artist well, this biography places his life in context, both within the history of rap and the cultural and political forces that shaped him, including Caribbean immigration, divestment in public education, and the war on drugs.\n\nBrydon fuses music journalism and self-help, digging into his archive of interviews (and adding some new ones) to reflect on the things that some of the most creative and successful artists of our generation have imparted to him about how to live a more fulfilling life.\n\nA respected music journalist highlights more than 100 women who have shaped hip-hop, including pioneers like Roxanne Shanté, game changers like Lauryn Hill and Missy Elliott, and current reigning queens like Nicki Minaj, Cardi B, and Lizzo—and many more.\n\nA pop culture journalist explores the life of one of the most influential rappers, songwriters, and record producers of his generation, providing an in-depth look at how Lamar revolutionized the music industry from the inside and became the first rapper to win a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nCombining musical, textual, and visual analysis with reception history, this book turns our attention to openly queer and trans rappers and reclaims queer involvement in hip-hop by tracing the genre’s beginnings within Black and Latinx queer music-making practices and spaces such as Ballroom."
