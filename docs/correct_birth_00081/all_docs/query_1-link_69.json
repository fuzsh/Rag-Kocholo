        "text": "Run-DMC, Nas, Lauryn Hill and other hip-hop acts featured in an all-star Bronx bash on Friday.\n\nThe celebration was for 50 years of hip-hop.\n\nHip-hop was born in 1973 on Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx.\n\nThousands of people partied deep into the night Friday as part of an all-star Bronx bash celebrating 50 years of hip-hop, featuring trailblazers Run-D.M.C., Nas, Lauryn Hill, Snoop Dogg and more.\n\nThe pops were on lock and the joy absolute at a packed Yankee Stadium, where New Yorkers and tourists alike commemorated five decades of the music whose vast influence irrevocably shook the culture.\n\n\"I didn't know how monumental it was gonna be growing up,\" said Kiesha Astwood, 50, who, like hip-hop, was born in 1973 on Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx.\n\nREAD MORE | From US ghettos to world domination: How the Big Apple's marking half a century of Hip-hop\n\nIt was there that DJ Kool Herc's younger sister Cindy threw a back-to-school party in the rec room of a high-rise apartment building, and the DJ spun the same record twice into the first documented breakbeat.\n\n\"It's very invigorating,\" Astwood told AFP moments after Kool Herc received accolades for his role in birthing the genre. \"Here we are 50 years later.\"\n\nNone other than Run-DMC - one of hip-hop's most influential acts - headlined the evening, playing hits including the beloved It's Tricky, which had the arena crowd screaming along despite the post-1:00 AM start time.\n\nPrior to that performance, Nas, the mammoth concert's ringleader, played a string of songs off his seminal album Illmatic including The World Is Yours and N.Y. State of Mind.\n\nThe crowd roared when the New York icon closed his set by inviting fellow legend Lauryn Hill onstage to sing the track they collaborated on, If I Ruled the World (Imagine That), as well as her own smash single Doo Wop (That Thing) and her rendition of Killing Me Softly that she originally performed as part of The Fugees.\n\nThat was preceded by none other than Snoop Dogg, who also played fan favourites, including The Next Episode, Nuthin' But A 'G' Thang and Gin And Juice.\n\nThe 51-year-old G-funk pioneer wore heart-shaped glasses and lit up onstage, as is his custom, vibing to his own legend as remarkably agile pole dancers harmonised alongside.\n\nLil Wayne was also among the performers smoking weed, whose scent hung heavy in the summer air.\n\nThe trap artist from Louisiana was a showstopper as he bounded across the stage, giving hit after hit, including A Milli and Lollipop before thanking his adoring fans and walking off to Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You.\n\nALSO READ | Through space and rhyme: How hip hop uses Afrofuturism to take listeners on journeys of empowerment\n\nAntoine Crossley had travelled all the way from Chicago to catch the history-spanning show, which began with hip-hop's founding fathers, including Melle Mel and Scorpio, along with Grandmaster Caz.\n\n\"I think hip-hop is something that really has brought a voice to people that originally didn't have a voice,\" he told AFP as he filed into the stadium.\n\n\"It speaks to me. I think growing up, it was something that was always special to me. So we were willing to make that trip and make it happen.\"\n\n'Our bloodline'\n\nThe marathon concert was the crown jewel of celebrations that have reverberated throughout the city to commemorate the 50th anniversary.\n\nClocking in at more than eight hours long, it also included performances from The Sugarhill Gang, members of the Wu-Tang Clan and Ice Cube.\n\nFor some critics and fans, pinpointing a date to mark the development of a style of music - which was rumbling well before 11 August 1973 - seems arbitrary.\n\nBut perhaps no type of music has deserved a reason to celebrate more.\n\nHip-hop was for decades maligned, ignored and censored by the industry it eventually shaped in profound ways in a country where rappers have churned out massive pop hits and heavily impacted everything from music to fashion, language to dance.\n\nThe quintessentially Black American art form has travelled from block parties in the Bronx to every corner of the globe; these days, most countries host a regional hip-hop scene of their own.\n\nSpeaking near the concessions Julio Casado, 42, said, \"I love to travel, and I kind of have a competition with hip-hop.\"\n\n\"I try to visit places where hip-hop hasn't been to yet. But the reality is, hip-hop has been all over, and hip-hop's actually got me beat.\"\n\nALSO READ | Cape Town hip-hop now: A reckoning through rap\n\nEveryone from children to grandparents danced, cheered, and illuminated the 46,000-capacity baseball venue with their phones.\n\nBut there was no shortage of jokes referencing that fans were ageing right along with hip-hop itself.\n\n\"Everyone sitting is over thirty; we got some knees hurting out there,\" joked one emcee.\n\nThe fans who had the endurance to stay to the end got to see Nas bring Kool Herc back onstage for another round of thanks: \"This is our love, our bloodline,\" Nas said.\n\n\"I'm fifty years old with hip-hop this year,\" Nas said. \"Hip-hop was born for you and me, and this is where we supposed to be.\"\n\n\"In N-Y-C.\""
