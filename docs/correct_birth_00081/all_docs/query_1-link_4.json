Other perks include a large living area with floor-to-ceiling windows showcasing city views, 13-feet-tall ceilings, a chef’s kitchen and a bedroom suite with a walk-in closet and spa-like bath.\n\nPast and present sporty residents of the building include Colin Kaepernick and hockey star Derick Brassard. One York boasts an outdoor heated pool, a sundeck and a gym.\n\nJaf Glazer of Conquest Advisors had the listing and declined to comment."
