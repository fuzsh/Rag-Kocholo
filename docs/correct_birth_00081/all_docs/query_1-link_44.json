        "text": "NYC has been home to creatives forever, so it’s no wonder poets, artists and musicians find it so inspirational. From it’s fascinating history to endless opportunities, NYC’s allure is undeniable.\n\nIn fact, NYC is the most sung about city in music, reported Forbes in 2019. New York has been featured in lyrics across 161 charting songs, with London just behind us.\n\nSo we’ve decided to compile some of the most iconic songs about NYC for you to jam out to when you’re feeling giddy off the NYC spirit. Listen along here! 👇\n\n1. “New York, New York,” Frank Sinatra\n\nWould it really be a list of iconic songs about New York without this classic by Frank Sinatra? This tune gained popularity on Frank Sinatra’s 1980 album Trilogy: Past Present Future. It’s so famous it has even become the New York Yankees victory song!\n\n2. “Empire State of Mind,” Jay-Z Ft. Alicia Keys\n\nPlayed in every bar and club in NYC, Jay-Z’s “Empire State of Mind” simply never gets old. As a matter of fact, the track is actually one of Jay-Z’s most successful singles, according to Genius and actually nods to Billy Joel’s “New York State of Mind,” and Nas’ “N.Y. State of Mind.”\n\n3. “No Sleep Till Brooklyn,” the Beastie Boys\n\nNew York-born band, the Beastie Boys, wrote this popular track about their tiring time on tour, anticipating their arrival home.\n\n4. “Welcome to New York,” Taylor Swift\n\nSwifties will know all about Cornelia Street and how Ms. Taylor made her move to NYC in 2014. This track reflects that monumental time for her, relocating from Nashville to NYC.\n\n5. “Autumn in New York,” Billie Holiday\n\nComposed by Vernon Duke, “Autumn in New York” has been sung by legends such as Ella Fitzgerald, Bing Crosby, and most famously, Billie Holiday.\n\n6. “New York Groove,” Russ Ballard\n\nThis sing-along song was written by English musician and songwriter, Russ Ballard, but truly came to life after Bronx-born Ace Frehley from Kiss recorded it on solo album.\n\n7. “New York State of Mind,” Billy Joel\n\nAccording to a 2010 interview with Howard Stern, Billy Joel wrote “New York State of Mind” in 15 minutes on an upstate-bound bus. “Piano Man” was actually born in the Bronx but grew up on Long Island.\n\n8. “Living for the City,” Stevie Wonder\n\nThis song by the legend, Stevie Wonder, reflects on his move from Mississippi to New York City and the difficulties that ensued thereafter.\n\n9. “Rockaway Beach,” Ramones\n\nThe band sings an ode to Dee Dee’s beloved beach escape in the big city.\n\n10. “Brooklyn’s Finest,” Jay Z & Biggie Smalls\n\nThis iconic duo both got on the track to touch upon growing up in Brooklyn and how their struggles have turned to success.\n\n11. “N.Y. State of Mind,” Nas\n\nNas (Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones) raps about the inescapable violence and dangers surrounding him on the streets of NYC. He was born in Crown Heights and dominated the rap game in the 90s.\n\n12. “C.R.E.A.M.,” Wu-Tang\n\nStanding for Cash Rules Everything Around Me, their song was inspired by a letter from an incarcerated friend referring to money as “cream.” The hip hop group hails from Staten Island and had forever changed the rap game after releasing their first album, Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).\n\n13. “Chelsea Morning,” Joni Mitchell\n\nSupposedly Joni Mitchell was inspired by a glass mobile she had hanging in her Chelsea apartment. She explained in an interview with the Los Angeles Times the beauty of the mobile when the sun hit it, cascading colors around the room.\n\n14. “The Only Boy Living In New York,” Simon & Garfunkel\n\nThis track on the duo’s last studio album touches on the topic of loneliness that all New Yorkers can relate to as Simon was waiting for Garfunkel to come back from shooting Catch-22 in Mexico.\n\n15. “Jenny From The Block,” Jennifer Lopez\n\nBronx-born actress, dancer and singer references her roots even after her rise to fame and how she’s still her genuine self behind it all. Fun fact: according to Songfacts, she references the Bronx 28 times in the track!"
