        "text": "Nas 1973–\n\nRap musician, actor\n\nReleased Debut Album\n\nAppeared in First Film\n\nFeuded With Jay-Z\n\nSelected works\n\nSources\n\nNot yet thirty years old, Nas has released five successful albums, launched his own record label, a fashion company, and appeared in several films. With his music, Nas bas become known for, according to Len Righi of the Morning Call, his “ability to look outside the immediate circumstances of his life” and address larger issues.\n\nNas was born Nasir Jones on September 14, 1973, in Queens, New York. His father, Olu Dara, a jazz and blues trumpeter, chose the name Nasir for his son because of its Arabic meaning: “helper” or “protector.” Nas was raised by his mother, Fannie Ann Jones.\n\nGrowing up in New York City’s tough Queensbridge housing projects, “it sometimes seemed to [Nas] his whole world was ill and being eaten away,” wrote Christopher John Farley in Time. “Drugs were devouring minds, crime was destroying families, poverty was gnawing at souls.” In May of 1992, both Nas’s brother, Jungle, and best friend were shot on the same night. Although his brother lived, Nas’s friend did not survive his injuries. “That was a wake-up call for me,” Nas told Time.\n\nReleased Debut Album\n\nTwo years after his wake-up call, Nas released his debut album, Illmatic. Nas worked with a number of top hip-hop producers, and his hard work paid off. Entertainment Weekly said of the album: “his witty lyrics and gruffly gratifying beats draw listeners into [his neighborhood’s] lifestyle with poetic efficiency.” Farley, writing in Time, noted that the record “captures the ailing community he [Nas] was raised in—the random gunplay, the whir of police helicopters, the homeboys hanging out on the corner sipping bottles of Hennessey.”\n\nSetting himself apart from other gangsta rappers, Nas did not typically glorify violence in his music, but, rather, his songs evoke sadness and outrage. Farley noted in Time that Nas performs on the album with “submerged emotion” and describes urban tragedy dispassionately, much “like an anchorman relaying the day’s grim news.” The New York Times declared that, on the album, Nas “imbues his chronicle with humanity and humor, not just hardness….[He] reports violence without celebrating it, dwelling on the way life triumphs over grim circumstances rather than the other way around.”\n\nAt a Glance …\n\nBorn Nasir Jones on September 14, 1973, in Queens, NY; son of Fannie Ann Jones and Olu Dara (jazz trumpeter).\n\nCareer: Rap musician, actor. Albums include: lllmatic, 1994; It Was Written, 1996; I Am, 1999; Nastradamus, 1999; Stillmatic, 2001; films include: Belly, 1998; Ticker, 2001; Sacred Is the Flesh, 2001.\n\nAwards: Youth Summit Award, Hip-Hop Youth Summit, 2002.\n\nAddresses: Office—c/o Sony Music Entertainment, Rap artist, 550 Madison Ave, New York, New York, United States 10022 (212) 833-8000,\n\nNas’s sophomore album, It Was Written, was released in 1996, selling more than a million copies. Again, Nas worked with several hip-hop producers, including top selling Dr. Dre. With this album, however, Nas faced criticism that the songs were amoral, contained rough language, and included episodes of violence. Critics were also frustrated by the album’s contradictions. The hit single “If I Ruled The World (Imagine That),” for example, depicts paradise as a “better livin’ type of place to raise our kids in.” However, this world is also one in which cocaine comes uncut, allowing higher profits on the drug. In a Rolling Stone review, Mark Coleman commented that Nas “possesses a phenomenal way with words and some savvy musical sense.” Coleman continued, “It’s a pity he doesn’t put his verbal dexterity and powers of observation to better use….When Nas finally aligns his mind with his mouth, he’ll truly be dangerous.”\n\nMusic critic Toure, writing in the New York Times, noted a strong musical link between Nas and his father, Olu Darà. Though the two musicians came from very different backgrounds and subscribed to different musical schools, Toure wrote,”Nas’s music is characterized by a laid-back cool, with a penchant for mediumpace tempos and relatively sparse tracks, all of which are hallmarks of his father’s music.” Nas’s father, who had a trumpet solo on his son’s first album, told Toure, “His aggressive is cool. Not like ‘I’m angry! I’m mad!’ It’s cool. And that’s the way my music is.” Vernon Reid, a guitarist who has played with Darà, also noted similarities between father and son, saying in the New York Times: “Both have a finely tuned sense of irony, which I think is evident in Nas’s lyrics and Olu’s playing.” Reid continued, “There’s a kind of cockeyed way of looking at the world. A raised eyebrow. Sly. They’re seeing what’s going on underneath the surface.”\n\nAppeared in First Film\n\nIn 1998 Nas made his feature film debut, appearing in Belly. Co-starring with fellow rapper DMX, the two hip-hop stars played best friends. Although they both come from the same violent neighborhood, these two friends want very different things out of life. Tommy, played by DMX, is willing to do whatever it takes to attain money, power, and women. Nas’s character, Sincere, wishes only to provide for his girlfriend and their child. To do so, he has partnered with Tommy in a world of crime, violence, and drugs. Sincere, however, has begun to reconsider his ways. In the end, according to Seattle Post-Intelligencer reviewer Paula Nechak, both characters arrive at the same conclusion: “Life is what you make it and knowledge and self-respect are everything.”\n\nCritics, although praising the stylistic ability of the film’s director, Hype Williams, skewered the film for its lack of originality. The Seattle Times criticized the acting skills of both rap stars, saying that Nas and DMX “couldn’t mutter their way out of an unzipped starter jacket.” Nechak, however, concluded in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer: “There is a real rite of passage these two young men go through in order to find themselves, and for once the payoff isn’t death.”\n\nI Am, Nas’s third album, was released in 1999. Here Nas collaborated with such stars as Sean “Puffy” Combs, Lauryn Hill, and Aaliyah. With numerous radio-friendly tracks on the album, a number of music critics accused the rapper of selling out. The Record noted that I Am seemed “tailored for mass consumption,” and the San Francisco Chronicle suggested that several tracks “are too generic for Nas’ delivery, leaving his vocals sounding ungrounded.” Nas’s talent had not waned however. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, “Nas continues to drop jaws and tingle ear canals with his complex and challenging wordplay.” Rather, some critics felt that Nas, in producing so mainstream an album, had done a disservice to his talent. The Record concluded that “the commercial advance requires an artistic step backward.”\n\nLater that year, Nas released his fourth album, Nastradamus. Again, critics lamented the too-polished style of the album. New York Times critic Soren Baker observed, “It’s as if in graduating from the ghetto, he’s misplaced the gritty edge that made him a hero.”\n\nFeuded With Jay-Z\n\nPerhaps Nas regained some of his edge when he began a feud of words with rapper Jay-Z. Jay-Z’s album, The Blueprint, featured the track “Takeover.” Here Jay-Z referred to Nas as “garbage,” saying, “That’s why your—l-a-a-a-me!—career’s come to an end.” Nas retaliated with an underground parody of the Jay-Z hit “Izzo.” The feud was further fueled by several tracks on Nas’s 2001 album, Stillmatic. Here Nas accused Jay-Z of usurping rhymes from the late Notorious B.I.G., criticized Jay-Z’s preference for Hawaiian shirts, and even attempted a bit of armchair psychoanalysis. Hip-hop fans in both the United States and Europe were fascinated by the feud, choosing sides and, according to the New York Times, “debating each rapper’s use of puns and metaphors.” The feud came to an end in early 2002. Jay-Z, after receiving a call from his mother asking him to stop, telephoned a New York City radio station and publicly apologized for “Super Ugly,” his response to Nas’s Stillmatic tracks.\n\nNas has formed his own record label, Nas and III Will Records. He has also launched a clothing line—Esco. In 2001 he co-starred with Steven Segal in the action film, Ticker. Although he has branched out into business and film, Nas remained devoted to music. “Music is in my blood,” he told the New York Times. “I could have chosen to do a lot of other things. I could have been a scientist, a lawyer. But this is where I’m comfortable at, right here.”\n\nSelected works\n\nAlbums\n\nIllmatic, Columbia, 1994.\n\nIt Was Written, Columbia, 1996.\n\nI Am, Columbia, 1999.\n\nNastradamus, Columbia, 1999.\n\nStillmatic, III Will, 2001.\n\nFilms\n\nBelly, 1998.\n\nTicker, 2001.\n\nSacred Is the Flesh, 2001.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nContemporary Musicians, Volume 19.

York\n\nNas\n\nRap singer\n\nFor the Record…\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\nWith just two albums to his credit, rapper Nas has achieved critical and popular acclaim, demonstrated a sensitivity and perception unusual in the aggressive hip-hop world. He has been favorably compared with Rakim, whom many consider the best rapper ever. “Hip-hop is the most controversial music of the ’90s,” Nas said during an Internet chat session with fans. “I am proud to be a part of it.”\n\nThe rapper, whose given name is Nasir Jones, was raised by his mother, Fannie Ann Jones, in New York City’s tough Queensbridge housing projects. His father is Olu Dara, a jazz and blues trumpeter who has performed and recorded with Art Blakey, Taj Mahal, Bobby Womackand David Murray, among others. Dara chose the name Nasir for his son; it means “helper” and “protector” in Arabic. As a teen-aged break dancer, Nasir used the name Kid Wave.\n\nGrowing up in the projects of Queens, “it sometimes seemed to (Nas) his whole world was ill and being eaten away,” Christopher John Farley wrote in Time magazine. “Drugs were devouring minds, crime was destroying families, poverty was gnawing at souls. Then in May 1992, Jones’ brother and best friend were shot on the same night. His brother, Jungle, lived. His friend died.” “That was a wake-up call for me,” he told Farley. The result of that awakening arrived two years later—in the debut album Illmatic. One song on the album, which has been called a classic of the genre, includes the line: “I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death.”\n\nNas created Illmatic with help from “a who’s who of hip-hop producers,” wrote Entertainment Weekly. The magazine went on to say “his witty lyrics and gruffly gratifying beats draw listeners into (his neighborhood’s) lifestyle with poetic efficiency.” Farley wrote that the record “captures the ailing community he was raised in—the random gunplay, the whir of police helicopters, the homeboys hanging out on the corner sipping bottles of Hennessey.” Nas’s songs, however, typically do not glorify the violent, desperate world from which he came the way the music of gangsta rappers does. Instead, he evokes sadness and outrage as he paints that world in rhythm and rhyme. Farley suggested the rapper delivers his songs with “submerged emotion” and dispassionately details the tragedy of urban America “like an anchorman relaying the day’s grim news.” The New York Times concluded that, on Illmatic, Nas “imbues his chronicle with humanity and humor, not just hardness.... (He) reports violence without celebrating it, dwelling on the way life triumphs over grim circumstances rather than the other way around.” Nas, for his part, has taken pains to set himself apart, declaring “I’m not a gangsta rapper.”\n\nFor the Record…\n\nBorn Nasir Jones in Queens, NY; son of Fannie Ann Jones and Olu Dara (jazz trumpeter).\n\nAddresses: Record company —Columbia Records, 550 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10022-3211. Website— http://www.music.sony.co/artistinfo/nas\n\nThe young musician’s delicate touch amid brutal realities is apparent on the song “One Love,” about writing to friends in prison. On the song, Nas raps: “So stay civilized, time flies, though incarcerated your mind dies. I hate it when your mom cries.” Or consider “I Gave You Power” from his charttopping second album, It Was Written. The song tells a metaphoric tale from the point of view of a handgun and includes this lyric: “My owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast. I didn’t know he was hit, but it’s over with. Heard mad niggas running, cops is comin’. Now I’m happy until I felt somebody else grab me… Damn.” The rap also contains the chilling refrain: “I might have tookyour first child, scarred your life, crippled your style. (But) I gave you power….”\n\nIt Was Written, released in 1996, sold more than a million copies and was seen as evidence of Nas’s staying power on the music scene. Like Illmatic, it was recorded with a variety of hip-hop producers, including the legendary Dr. Dre. The album, however, was criticized for its “utter amorality” as well as “violent episodes and sometimes needlessly rough language”—and for its frustrating contradictions. Take, for example, the hit single “If I Ruled The World (Imagine That)” on which Nas is accompanied by Lauryn Fill of the Fugees. The song depicts paradise as a “better livin’ type of place to raise our kids in”—but also as a world in which cocaine comes uncut so more money can be made from it. In a review published in Rolling Stone magazine, Mark Coleman noted that Nas “possesses a phenomenal way with words and some savvy musical sense. It’s a pity he doesn’t put his verbal dexterity and powers of observation to better use.” It Was Written, Coleman wrote, is “just the latest blatant example of trashy tough-guy talk. When Nas finally aligns his mind with his mouth, he’ll truly be dangerous.”\n\nIn the New York Times, music writer Touré suggested there is a strong musical link between Nas and his father, Olu Dara, even though they come from different backgrounds and musical schools: “Nas’s music is characterized by a laid-back cool, with a penchant for medium-pace tempos and relatively sparse tracks, all of which are hallmarks of his father’s music.” “He has different genres of songs,” Nas’ father, who played a trumpet solo on Illmatic, told Touré. “But in each one the chords he has going, the economy, the smoothness, the non-aggressiveness…. His aggressive is cool. Not like “I’m angry! I’m mad!” It’s cool. And that’s the way my music is.” Vernon Reid, a gifted rock guitarist who has played with Dara, also sees similarities between father and son. “Both have a finely tuned sense of irony, which I think is evident in Nas’s lyrics and Olu’s playing,” Reid said. “There’s a kind of cockeyed way of looking at the world. A raised eyebrow. Sly. They’re seeing what’s going on underneath the surface.”\n\nTouré, meanwhile, describes Nas as “quiet and pensive, an introspective old soul” and strongly suggests the young rapper will be around awhile. “Music is in my blood,” Nas told the writer. “I could have chosen to do a lot of other things. I could have been a scientist, a lawyer. But this is where I’m comfortable at, right here.”\n\nSelected discography\n\nIllmatic, Columbia, 1994.\n\nIt Was Written, Columbia, 1996.\n\nSources\n\nPeriodicals\n\nEntertainment Weekly, April 22, 1994, p. 58; July 26, 1996, p. 56.\n\nNew York Times, Oct. 6, 1996, sec. 2.\n\nRolling Stone, Sept. 16, 1996, pp. 83-84; Dec. 26, 1996, pp. 194-195.\n\nTime, June 20, 1994, p. 62; July 29, 1996, p. 79.\n\nOnline\n\nSony Music home page: (http://www.music.sony.co.artistinfo/nas/)\n\nNas\n\nRap musician\n\nBy the time he was barely out of his twenties, Nas had released five successful albums, launched his own record label, a fashion company, and appeared in several films.

I could have been a scientist, a lawyer. But this is where I'm comfortable at, right here.\"\n\nUnissued Tracks Released\n\nNas's comeback as a street-oriented hip-hop artist was slowed somewhat by the appearance of The Lost Tapes, a collection of previously unreleased material that Entertainment Weekly described as \"more introspection and insight than insult.\" Nas was not pleased. Asked about a rumor that he had called himself a \"slave\" of his label Columbia, the rapper answered, \"I may not be a slave because I get paid for what I do, but the system still pimps artists.\"\n\nThe year 2002 saw Nas coping with personal pain as cancer claimed the rapper's mother. Personal stress perhaps lay behind his widely publicized no-show at the Hot 97 Summer Jam in New York. Nas nevertheless continued his activities in the studio with guest appearances on Brandy's \"What About Us?\" and J-Lo's \"I'm Gonna Be All Right,\" among other tracks. Nas memorialized his mother on the \"Dance\" track of his God's Son album, released in December of 2002; the song also featured an instrumental contribution by his father, Olu Dara.\n\nSuggestions of a mellower Nas, as evidenced on the uplifting track \"I Can,\" was contradicted by such hardcore hip-hop tracks as \"Made You Look,\" though both tracks became hits. Rapper Eminem co-wrote and produced \"The Cross,\" which took aim at R&B's rap pretenders. Headlines linked Nas romantically that year with Harlem rapper Kelis, and a marriage was planned. An assault arrest in December of 2003 suggested Nas's continuing bent toward controversy, but a double-disc 10th-anniversary release of Illmatic the following year confirmed his status as one of the genre's artists of lasting significance.\n\nSelected discography\n\nIllmatic, Columbia, 1994.\n\nIt Was Written, Columbia, 1996.\n\nI Am, Columbia, 1999.\n\nNastradamus, Columbia, 1999.\n\nStillmatic, Ill Will, 2001.\n\nGod's Son, Columbia, 2002.\n\nIllmatic: 10th Anniversary Platinum Edition, Sony, 2004.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nContemporary Black Biography, Volume 33, Gale Group, 2002.\n\nWho's Who Among African Americans, 14th ed.

York and\n\nJames M. Manheim\n\nNAS\n\nBorn: Nasir Ben Olu Dara Jones; Brooklyn, New York, 14 September 1973\n\nGenre: Hip-Hop\n\nBest-selling album since 1990: It Was Written (1996)\n\nHit songs since 1990: \"Street Dreams,\" \"Got Ur Self a Gun\"\n\nNas is widely viewed as a once-and-future street prophet, who repeatedly wavers between exercising his substantial artistic gifts and downplaying them in order to seek widespread appeal.\n\nThe son of acclaimed Jazz musician Olu Dara, Nas first came to the attention of hip-hop fans as \"Nasty Nas\" performing a guest verse on Main Source's 1991 single \"Live at the Barbeque.\" The song brought him instant notoriety for his relaxed-yet-intense vocal delivery, as well as for his willingness to violate one of hip-hop's strongest, yet least noted, rules against insulting Christianity. \"When I was twelve,\" he rhymes, \"I went to hell for snuffing Jesus.\"\n\nIn April 1994, he released his first album, Illmatic, which critics consider to be one of the all time great hip-hop albums. The album's lyrics have an internal rhythmic momentum that Nas uses to intensify the strength of his already powerful observations. With an eye for the telling poetic detail, Nas addresses various aspects of the street life with informality and empathy.\n\nAfter such a nuanced and artistic debut, fans were shocked by Nas's second album, It Was Written (1996), which openly embraced a pop sensibility. On the strength of the first single \"Street Dreams\" (based on the Eurythmics' 1983 pop hit \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\"), It Was Written ultimately reached number one on the Billboard 200.\n\nThe following year, Nas adopted the name Nas Escobar in tribute to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar, and created a group called the Firm with rappers Foxy Brown, Nature, and AZ. The group released a self-titled album, dealing primarily with drug themes, which failed to inspire his core fans.\n\nNas released two albums in 1999, I Am . . ., which reached number one on the Billboard 200, and Nastradamus. I Am . . . contains one of Nas's most controversial songs, \"Hate Me Now,\" in which he berates the fans who have criticized his materialism: \"My bad, should I step out my shoes? / Give 'em to you?\" To add insult to injury, the song features a guest appearance from Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs, widely seen as the most shamelessly commercial rap artist of the era.\n\nIn 2001, Nas released QB Finest, a compilation album that features his crew, Bravehearts, and produced only one hit, the sexually indulgent \"Oochie Wally.\"\n\nJust when Nas seemed to have committed himself to a career as a sexually explicit pop star, he became embroiled in a conflict with Brooklyn-based rapper Jay-Z. As each emcee began to release songs responding to each other's insults, the hip-hop community took increasing note of the fact that, in his anger, Nas was crafting rhymes that recalled the quality and intensity of his earliest efforts.\n\nEnergized by his public feud with Jay-Z—and the public reaction to it—Nas released Stillmatic in late 2001, its title a reference to his intention to resume the style of his first album. This release was soon followed by The Lost Tapes, a compilation of outtakes from 1998 to 2001, and God's Son, both released in 2002. These three albums are widely seen as a return to form for Nas, much to the delight of the hip-hop community.\n\nFor many hip-hop fans, Nas embodies the contradictions of the form. His refusal to be defined as either an artist or a pop star has brought him a great deal of criticism, along with an equivalent portion of respect.\n\nSpot Light: Illmatic\n\nIllmatic (1994) is considered to be one of the quintessential New York hip-hop albums, a rare blend of insightful lyricism and straightforward sample-heavy music. Released in an era dominated by the relaxed, synthesizer-based West Coast \"G-Funk\" of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, Illmatic —along with Enter the Wu-Tang: (36 Chambers) by Wu-Tang Clan—returned hip-hop's focus to the East Coast. Nas's style on this album is defined by his poetic observations of everyday life and the social and political realities that they implied. The song \"One Love,\" is written in the form of a letter to an imprisoned friend. By concentrating on details, the song manages to simultaneously portray both the isolation of prison and the difficulties of life on the outside: \". . . Yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece? / Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach / it's bugged. . . .\" This album also breaks with hip-hop tradition by forgoing the use of a single producer/disc jockey to construct the instrumental settings for Nas's lyrics, instead using many different producers to create a unique sound for each song. In the wake of Illmatic 's success, this approach soon became standard practice among hip-hop artists.\n\nSELECTIVE DISCOGRAPHY:\n\nIllmatic (Sony/Columbia, 1994); It Was Written (Sony/Columbia, 1996); The Firm (Sony/Columbia, 1997); I Am . . .
