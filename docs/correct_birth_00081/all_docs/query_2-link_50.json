        "text": "The Many Worlds of Leo Szilard: Physicist, Peacemaker, Provocateur\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLanouette, William\n\n2014-03-01\n\nBest known for being the first to conceive and patent the nuclear chain reaction in the 1930s, Leo Szilard should also be remembered for other insights in both physics and biology, and for historical initiatives to control the A-bomb he helped create. In physics, Szilard applied entropy to data in a seminal 1929 paper that laid the basis for ``information theory.'' Szilard co-designed an electromagnetic refrigerator pump with Einstein in the 1920s, in 1939 he co-designed the first nuclear reactor with Enrico Fermi, and he later thought up and named the nuclear ``breeder'' reactor. Biologist Francois Jacob called Szilard an ``intellectual bumblebee'' for the many novel ideas he shared, including one that earned Jacob and others the Nobel Prize. James D. Watson said that for intellectual stimulation he liked being around Szilard because ``Leo got excited about something before it was true.'' A political activist, Szilard proposed and drafted the 1939 letter Einstein sent to President Franklin Roosevelt that warned of German A-bomb work and led to the Manhattan Project - where Szilard was ``Chief Physicist.'' Yet Szilard then worked tirelessly to curb nuclear weapons, organizing a scientists' petition to President Truman and lobbying Congress for civilian control of the atom. Szilard loved dreaming up new institutions. He helped to create the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, and founded the Council for a Livable World - the first political action committee for arms control. In biology, Szilard proposed the European Molecular Biology Organization modeled on CERN, and helped create the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he was one of the first fellows. Shy, witty, and eccentric, Szilard wrote a political satire in 1960 that predicted when the US-Soviet nuclear arms race would end in the late 1980s. Another satire, ``My Trial as a War Criminal'' about scientists' responsibilities for weapons of mass destruction, is credited with prompting\n\nGenius in the shadows a biography of Leo Szilard, the man behind the bomb\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nLanouette, William\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWell-known names such as Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Edward Teller are usually those that surround the creation of the atom bomb. One name that is rarely mentioned is Leo Szilard, known in scientific circles as \"father of the atom bomb.\" The man who first developed the idea of harnessing energy from nuclear chain reactions, he is curiously buried with barely a trace in the history of this well-known and controversial topic.Born in Hungary and educated in Berlin, he escaped Hitler's Germany in 1933 and that first year developed his concept of nucle\n\nGenius in the shadows\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLanouette, W.; Silard, B.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThis book is a well-researched, anecdote-rich biography of Leo Szilard, the inventive Hungarian physicist who pressed Einstein in 1939 to alert President Roosevelt to the possible wartime uses of atomic energy. Withdrawing from nuclear physics after the bombing of Hiroshima, Szilard studied biology, advocated international arms control, and wrote, among other things, open-quotes The Voice of the Dolphinsclose quotes, a utopian novel offering his ideas for reducing Cold War tensions. Based on research in the Leo Szilard papers, extensive interviews with Szilard's colleagues and friends, and on material and recollections provided by Szilard's younger brother, Bela Szilard, the book offers a detailed picture of the physicist. The book provides a record of Szilard's life before 1939 and a thorough, readable account of a significant historical figure\n\nEver Ready to Go: The Multiple Exiles of Leo Szilard\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFrank, Tibor\n\n2005-06-01\n\nI argue that to understand the life and work of Leo Szilard (1898 1964) we have to understand, first, that he was driven by events to numerous departures, escapes, and exiles, changing his religion, his language, his country of residence, and his scientific disciplines; second, that he was a man haunted by major moral dilemmas throughout his life, burdened by a sincere and grave sense of responsibility for the fate of the world; and third, that he experienced a terrible sense of dÃ©jÃ vu: his excessive sensitivity and constant alertness were products of his experiences as a young student in Budapest in 1919. The mature Szilard in Berlin of 1933, and forever after, was always ready to move. I proceed as follows:After a brief introduction to his family background, youth, and education in Budapest, I discuss the impact of his army service in the Great War and of the tumultous events in Hungary in 1918 1919 on his life and psyche, forcing him to leave Budapest for Berlin in late 1919. He completed his doctoral degree under Max von Laue (1879 1960) at the University of Berlin in 1922 and his Habilitationsschrift in 1925. During the 1920s and early 1930s, he filed a number of patents, several of them jointly with Albert Einstein (1879 1955). He left Berlin in March 1933 for London where he played a leading role in the rescue operations for refugee scientists and scholars from Nazi Germany. He also carried out notable research in nuclear physics in London and Oxford before immigrating to the United States at the end of 1938. He drafted Einsteinâs famous letter of August 2, 1939, to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, worked in the Manhattan Project during World War II, initiated a petition to President Harry S. Truman not to use the bomb on Japan, and immediately after the war was a leader in the scientistsâ movement that resulted in civilian control of nuclear energy. In 1946 he turned to biology, in which his most significant contribution was to formulate a theory of\n\nMaxwell's demon, Szilard's engine and quantum measurements\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZorek, W.H.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe author proposes and analyzes a quantum version of Szilard's one-molecule engine. In particular, the author recovers, in the quantum context, Szilard's conclusion concerning the free energy ''cost'' of measurements (delta /sub F/ is greater than or equal to k/sub b/T1n2) per bit of information. A cycle of Szilard's engine is illustrated for both the original and quantum versions. The measurement of the location of the molecule is essential in the process of extracting work in both classical and quantum design. Measurements are made by the classical Maxwell's demon\n\nMaxwell's Demon, Szilard's Engine and Quantum Measurements\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nZurek, Wojciech Hubert\n\n2003-01-01\n\nWe propose and analyze a quantum version of Szilard's ``one-molecule engine.'' In particular, we recover, in the quantum context, Szilard's conclusion concerning the free energy ``cost'' of measurements: $\\\\Delta F \\\\geq k_B T\\\\ln2$ per bit of information.\n\nSzilard-Chalmers Effect in Permanganate Solutions\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBroda, E.\n\n1944-07-01\n\nThis report was written by E. Broda at the Cavendish Laboratory (Cambridge) in January 1944 by Engelbert Broda and is about the Szilard-Chalmers effect in Permanganate Solutions. The Szilard-Chalmers effect in permanganate was studied in order to see what extent it is quantitative, or at least reproducible, in different conditions. The measurement description and results are discussed in this report. (nowak)\n\nBernard T. Feld\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAnon.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nBernard T. Field, 73, died in New York City February 19 of lymphoma. Bernie Field was a physicist whose passion was world peace. Bernie Field assisted Leo Szilard and Enrico Fermi to produce a controlled self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. Later, he became a group leadrer in the atom bomb project. After the war, he dedicated his time to nuclear disarmament, international cooperation, and peaceful conflict resolution\n\nEntropy of measurement and erasure: Szilard's membrane model revisited\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLeff, Harvey S.; Rex, Andrew F.\n\n1994-11-01\n\nIt is widely believed that measurement is accompanied by irreversible entropy increase. This conventional wisdom is based in part on Szilard's 1929 study of entropy decrease in a thermodynamic system by intelligent intervention (i.e., a Maxwell's demon) and Brillouin's association of entropy with information. Bennett subsequently argued that information acquisition is not necessarily irreversible, but information erasure must be dissipative (Landauer's principle). Inspired by the ensuing debate, we revisit the membrane model introduced by Szilard and find that it can illustrate and clarify (1) reversible measurement, (2) information storage, (3) decoupling of the memory from the system being measured, and (4) entropy increase associated with memory erasure and resetting.\n\nInformation Thermodynamics of the Cell Signal Transduction as a Szilard Engine\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTatsuaki Tsuruyama\n\n2018-03-01\n\nFull Text Available A cell signaling system is in a non-equilibrium state, and it includes multistep biochemical signaling cascades (BSCs, which involve phosphorylation of signaling molecules, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK pathways. In this study, the author considered signal transduction description using information thermodynamic theory. The ideal BSCs can be considered one type of the Szilard engine, and the presumed feedback controller, Maxwellâs demon, can extract the work during signal transduction. In this model, the mutual entropy and chemical potential of the signal molecules can be redefined by the extracted chemical work in a mechanicochemical model, Szilard engine, of BSC. In conclusion, signal transduction is computable using the information thermodynamic method.\n\nA quantum Szilard engine without heat from a thermal reservoir\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHamed Mohammady, M.; Anders, Janet\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe study a quantum Szilard engine that is not powered by heat drawn from a thermal reservoir, but rather by projective measurements. The engine is constituted of a system { S }, a weight { W }, and a Maxwell demon { D }, and extracts work via measurement-assisted feedback control. By imposing natural constraints on the measurement and feedback processes, such as energy conservation and leaving the memory of the demon intact, we show that while the engine can function without heat from a thermal reservoir, it must give up at least one of the following features that are satisfied by a standard Szilard engine: (i) repeatability of measurements; (ii) invariant weight entropy; or (iii) positive work extraction for all measurement outcomes. This result is shown to be a consequence of the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem, which imposes restrictions on the observables that can be measured under additive conservation laws. This observation is a first-step towards developing âsecond-law-likeâ relations for measurement-assisted feedback control beyond thermality.\n\nQuantum Szilard Engine with Attractively Interacting Bosons\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBengtsson, J.; Tengstrand, M. Nilsson; Wacker, A.; Samuelsson, P.; Ueda, M.; Linke, H.; Reimann, S. M.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe show that a quantum Szilard engine containing many bosons with attractive interactions enhances the conversion between information and work. Using an ab initio approach to the full quantum-mechanical many-body problem, we find that the average work output increases significantly for a larger number of bosons. The highest overshoot occurs at a finite temperature, demonstrating how thermal and quantum effects conspire to enhance the conversion between information and work. The predicted effects occur over a broad range of interaction strengths and temperatures.\n\nSzilard-Chalmers effect in natural. cap alpha. disintegrations\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHaissinsky, M; Cottin, M\n\n1948-11-01\n\nThe Szilard-Chalmers effect resulting from the reaction UI(/sup 238/U) ..-->.. UX1(/sup 234/Th) was investigated. The authors developed a chemical method adapted from a technique of Starke (Naturwissenschaften 30, 577(1942)) to separate UX1 which was formed by ..cap alpha.. emission. The experimental accuracy is insufficient to indicate the influence of the degree of dilution of the chemical solutions used on the efficiency of separation, but it is shown that there is a marked decrease in efficiency when solid compounds are used, which is consistent with a hypothesis of Franck and Rabinowitsch (Trans. Faraday Soc. 30, 120(1934)).\n\nRevisiting the quantum Szilard engine with fully quantum considerations\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLi, Hai [School of Physics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081 (China); School of Information and Electronics Engineering, Shandong Institute of Business and Technology, Yantai 264000 (China); Zou, Jian, E-mail: zoujian@bit.edu.cn [School of Physics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081 (China); Li, Jun-Gang; Shao, Bin [School of Physics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081 (China); Wu, Lian-Ao [Department of Theoretical Physics and History of Science, The Basque Country University (EHU/UPV), P.O. Box 644, ES-48080 Bilbao (Spain); IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science, ES-48011 Bilbao (Spain)\n\n2012-12-15\n\nBy considering level shifting during the insertion process we revisit the quantum Szilard engine (QSZE) with fully quantum consideration. We derive the general expressions of the heat absorbed from thermal bath and the total work done to the environment by the system in a cycle with two different cyclic strategies. We find that only the quantum information contributes to the absorbed heat, and the classical information acts like a feedback controller and has no direct effect on the absorbed heat. This is the first demonstration of the different effects of quantum information and classical information for extracting heat from the bath in the QSZE. Moreover, when the well width L{yields}{infinity} or the temperature of the bath T{yields}{infinity} the QSZE reduces to the classical Szilard engine (CSZE), and the total work satisfies the relation W{sub tot}=k{sub B}Tln2 as obtained by Sang Wook Kim et al. [S.W. Kim, T. Sagawa, S. De Liberato, M. Ueda, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106 (2011) 070401] for one particle case. - Highlights: Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer For the first time analyze the QSZE by considering energy level shifts. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Find different roles played by classical and quantum information in the QSZE. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The amount of work extracted depends on the cyclic strategies of the QSZE. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Verify that the QSZE will reduce to the CSZE in the classical limits.\n\nExperimental realization of a Szilard engine with a single electron.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKoski, Jonne V; Maisi, Ville F; Pekola, Jukka P; Averin, Dmitri V\n\n2014-09-23\n\nThe most succinct manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics is the limitation imposed by the Landauer principle on the amount of heat a Maxwell demon (MD) can convert into free energy per single bit of information obtained in a measurement. We propose and realize an electronic MD based on a single-electron box operated as a Szilard engine, where kBT ln 2 of heat is extracted from the reservoir at temperature T per one bit of created information. The information is encoded in the position of an extra electron in the box.\n\nLeo Szilard Lecturship Award: How can physicists help the public make better decisions about science and technology?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPrimack, Joel\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFor more than 40 years the APS has worked to improve governmental decision-making, mainly through the Congressional Science and Technology Fellowship program and through occasional studies of important science and technology issues. How productive have these been? How can the APS and other professional societies more effectively combat anti-science propaganda and help the public develop better-informed views about science and technology? How can individual scientists communicate scientific concepts in a more understandable and engaging way?

The only types of energy of importance in this demon are electrical energy and heat. We also demonstrate an entirely electrical version of Szilard's engine, i.e., an information-controlled device that can produce work by employing thermal fluctuations. The only moving part is a piston that executes work, and the engine has purely electronic controls and it is free of the major weakness of the original Szilard engine in not requiring removal and repositioning the piston at the end of the cycle. For both devices, the energy dissipation in the memory and other binary informatics components are insignificant compared to the exponentially large energy dissipation in the analog part responsible for creating new information by measurement and decision. This result contradicts the view that the energy dissipation in the memory during erasure is the most essential dissipation process in a demon. Nevertheless the dissipation in the memory and information processing parts is sufficient to secure the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

Centre d' Etudes Nucleaires\n\n1966-01-01\n\nWith a view to studying the Szilard-Chalmers effect in potassium ferrocyanide, a chemical separation method has been developed for the different ions formed by recoil: Fe{sup 2+}, Fe{sup 3+} and the complex forms of iron. A measurement method has been developed also for analyzing separately the isotopes {sup 55}Fe and {sup 59}Fe, and determining the relative amounts of these two isotopes in the different chemical states. The experimental results show that the activity of the two isotopes is distributed differently between the complex forms of iron, the ferrous ions and the ferric ions. This difference is of the order of 40 per cent in the ferrous solution and of 2 to 5 per cent in the ferric retention and ferric solution.

Une methode de mesure a ete egalement mise au point pour analyser separement les isotopes {sup 55}Fe et {sup 59}Fe et determiner les proportions relatives de ces 2 isotopes dans les differents etats chimiques. Les resultats experimentaux montrent que l'activite des deux isotopes est repartie differemment entre les formes complexes du fer, les ions ferreux et les ions ferriques.

Yet a measurement provides information. Measurement itself thus becomes paradoxical, until one reflects that the gain in information about the system of interest might be offset by a gain in entropy of some garbage can gc. Indeed, it must be so offset to save the bookkeeping of the Second Law. This apparent and paradoxical gain in information attendant upon observation, presumably due to neglect of some dissipant gc, has long prompted aberrant speculation that intelligent beings and even life in general somehow indeed violate the Second Law, an erroneous view he cites only for perspective. For some time he has fallen prey to a version of this paradox, developed in the context of standard quantum theory of measurement as delineated by von Neumann (1955), a trap he has recently been able to escape with the help of Szilard (1929), the celebrated paper in which the related paradox of Maxwell's demon is broken. Here he describes a precise formulation, then resolution of his paradox of information through measurement\n\nAn installation for the preparation of radioelements using the Szilard-Chalmers effect (1961); Une installation de preparation de radioelements par effet Szilard-Chalmers (1961)\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDouis, M; Valade, J [Commissariat a l' Energie Atomique, Saclay (France). Centre d' Etudes Nucleaires\n\n1961-07-01\n\nThe obtention of high specific activities is sometimes necessary for certain applications of radioelements which cannot otherwise be used readily. This is the case for example, in medical applications where a radioisotope like As{sup 76} must not poison a patient before curing him. Similarly Cr{sup 51} should have a high specific activity for marking red blood corpuscles, since only a limited amount of chromium can be introduced into the blood stream. It seemed to be of interest to build, in the high activity laboratories at Saclay, a single block grouping all the 'Szilard' preparations and to add to it annexe departments for storage, de-canning of the irradiated products, and distribution of the final solutions. The radioelements prepared in this installation are Cr{sup 51}, As{sup 76}, Zn{sup 65}, Cu{sup 64} and Fe{sup 55} + Fe{sup 59}. In the first part we describe the installation and we then give the chemical methods used.

Careers in finance typically offer intellectual challenge, a fast pace, high caliber colleagues, merit-based compensation with substantial upside, and an opportunity to deploy skills learned as a physicist. Physicists are employed at a wide range of financial institutions on both the ``buy side'' (hedge fund managers, private equity managers, mutual fund managers, etc.) and the ``sell side'' (investment banks and brokerages). Historically, physicists in finance were primarily ``quants'' tasked with applying stochastic calculus to determine the price of financial derivatives. With the maturation of the field of derivative pricing, physicists in finance today find work in a variety of roles ranging from quantification and management of risk to investment analysis to development of sophisticated software used to price, trade, and risk manage securities. Only a small subset of today's finance careers for physicists require the use of advanced math and practically none provide an opportunity to tinker with an apparatus, yet most nevertheless draw on important skills honed during the training of a nuclear physicist. Intellectually rigorous critical thinking, sophisticated problem solving, an attention to minute detail and an ability to create and test hypotheses based on incomplete information are key to both disciplines.\n\nLeo Szilard Award Lecture: Unwinding the Cold War\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNeff, Thomas\n\n1997-04-01\n\nTwo generations of scientists in the US and the Soviet Union spent their lives in the shadow of the cold war, building the scientific and technical infrastructure and shaping the institutional and policy structures that maintained a stable \"balance of terror.\" The cold war is now over, but the lethal products of it, and the decaying institutions and policies that perpetuated it, are probably more dangerous than ever. At the same time, the loss of cold war imperatives means fewer government resources and less policy attention to the problems of reversing the cold war. Moreover, solving these problems will require that the forces and talents of economics and business be integrated with the technical skill and imagination of physical scientists. Science fundamentally involves skills of problem definition and problem-solving. Both American and Russian scientists and engineers must expand their tool kits and the scope of their imaginations if they are to undo the dangerous legacy of the cold war and find productive new roles in a post-cold war world. This address is intended to illustrate how this can be done, using the past five years' experience in developing and implementing the agreement between the U.S. and Russia to motivate, finance, and institutionalize the destruction of approximately 20,000 Russian nuclear weapons through the commercially-driven recovery and destruction of 500 tonnes of highly enriched uranium from those weapons. Such approaches can have benefits much broader than the destruction of weapons, if we can recognize the opportunities and pursue them wisely. Unfortunately, there is a basic lack of imagination and will, one that is further frustrated by bureaucratic inertia and the parochial interests of cold war institutions. The irony is that Russia is more ready to change than the US, but it is the US that is, in principle but perhaps not in practice, most able to help lead the world out of the cold war era.\n\nWhat is a medical physicist?\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEndo, Masahiro\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe modern radiotherapy requires a medical physicist who optimizes treatment plans, assures delivered dose equal to prescription, and performs QA (quality assurance) of radiotherapy equipments. However, medical physicist has not been established as a medical profession in Japan mainly because importance of radiotherapy was not sufficiently recognized until recently. Between 2000 and 2004, several accidents of radiotherapy including hundreds of patients were found and these accidents were mainly caused by lack of QA. The necessity and importance of medical physicist were recognized by these accidents as well as by the advent of high-precision radiotherapy such as IMRT (intensity modulation radiation therapy). JRS (Japan Radiological Society) that certified medical physicists with the help of JSMP (Japan Society of Medical Physics), decided to extend eligibility in order to increase certified medical physicists rapidly in 2003. After the decision certified medical physicists were rapidly increased in number. The government supports this tendency to enact that certified medical physicists is necessary to reimbursement for high-precision therapy. It also started to supply grants for medical physics training in physical and health science graduate schools. In this program several universities have started medical physics course in their graduate schools. If these movements continue, medical physicist will be established as a medical profession in the near future.

The influence of some factors on the separation yield of chromium-51, such as: composition, concentration and flow rate of eluent, mesh size of the resin and irradiation time are studied. The results are compardd with those obtained by the static method, in which the recoiled atom is separated from the target after irradiation. Because of the high separation yield of chromium-51, the method of dynamic separation is proposed for routine production of this elemnt, with high specific activities.

Cumulative ranking of large groups of the LEO debris population and general limitations of passive drag devices and rocket-based removal systems are analyzed. A candidate electrodynamic debris removal system is discussed that can affordably remove all debris objects over 2 kg from LEO in 7 years. That means removing more than 99% of the collision-generated debris potential in LEO. Removal is performed by a dozen 100-kg propellantless vehicles that react against the Earth's magnetic field. The debris objects are dragged down and released into short-lived orbits below ISS. As an alternative to deorbit, some of them can be collected for storage and possible in-orbit recycling. The estimated cost per kilogram of debris removed is a small fraction of typical launch costs per kilogram. These rates are low enough to open commercial opportunities and create a governing framework for wholesale removal of large debris objects from LEO.\n\nAn installation for the preparation of radioelements using the Szilard-Chalmers effect (1961)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDouis, M.; Valade, J.\n\n1961-01-01\n\nThe obtention of high specific activities is sometimes necessary for certain applications of radioelements which cannot otherwise be used readily. This is the case for example, in medical applications where a radioisotope like As 76 must not poison a patient before curing him. Similarly Cr 51 should have a high specific activity for marking red blood corpuscles, since only a limited amount of chromium can be introduced into the blood stream. It seemed to be of interest to build, in the high activity laboratories at Saclay, a single block grouping all the 'Szilard' preparations and to add to it annexe departments for storage, de-canning of the irradiated products, and distribution of the final solutions. The radioelements prepared in this installation are Cr 51 , As 76 , Zn 65 , Cu 64 and Fe 55 + Fe 59 . In the first part we describe the installation and we then give the chemical methods used.

Coinciding with the kick-off of the winter Olympics in Turin, more than 70 physicists gathered at CERN from across the globe for the second LHC Olympics workshop on 9-10 February. Their challenge, however, involved brains rather than brawn. As the switch-on date for the LHC draws near, scientists excited by the project want to test and improve their ability to decipher the unprecedented amount of data that the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator is expected to generate.

The H i and follow-up optical observations have shown that Leo P is a gas-rich dwarf galaxy with active star formation, an underlying older population, and an extremely low oxygen abundance. We have obtained optical imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope to two magnitudes below the red clump in order to study the evolution of Leo P. We refine the distance measurement to Leo P to be 1.62 Â± 0.15 Mpc, based on the luminosity of the horizontal branch stars and 10 newly identified RR Lyrae candidates.

The best-fitting star formation history (SFH) derived from the resolved stellar populations of Leo P using the latest PARSEC models shows a relatively constant star formation rate over the lifetime of the galaxy. The modeled luminosity characteristics of Leo P at early times are consistent with low-luminosity dSph Milky Way satellites, suggesting that Leo P is what a low-mass dSph would look like if it evolved in isolation and retained its gas. Despite the very low mass of Leo P, the imprint of reionization on its SFH is subtle at best, and consistent with being totally negligible.

Using the recent Cepheid variable star distance determination to Leo A by Hoessel et al., we are able to create an accurate color-magnitude diagram (CMD). We have used the Bavesian inference method described by Tolstoy & Saha to calculate the likelihood of a Monte Carlo simulation of the stellar population of Leo A being a good match to the data within the well understood errors in the data. The magnitude limits on our data are sensitive enough to look back at ~1 Gyr of star formation history at the distance of Leo A. To explain the observed ratio of red to blue stars in the observed CMD, it is necessary to invoke either a steadily decreasing star formation rate toward the present time or gaps in the star formation history. We also compare the properties of the observed stellar population with the known spatial distribution of the H I gas and H II regions to support the conclusions from CMD modeling. We consider the possibility that currently there is a period of diminished star formation in Leo A, as evidenced by the lack of very young stars in the CMD and the faint H II regions. How the chaotic H I distribution, with no observable rotation, fits into our picture of the evolution of Leo A is as yet unclear.\n\nAre physicists useful?\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nRidley, B\n\n2001-01-01\n\nArticle arguing that physicists need to be more than experts in their fields.

As a result, in the case of cervical and breast cancers, oncological treatment is often not received until the diseases are in the late stages. Once a cancer is classified and the tumor marked, the role of the medical physicist begins. Medical physicists' responsibilities include treatment planning, supervising treatment through radiation, dosimetry, contouring, training, equipment selection, education, research, and supervising radiotherapy facilities. In brachytherapy, isotopes are placed at the tumor site in the form of wires or seeds. There are very few female medical physicists in Pakistan. This leads to further hesitation on the part of many women to seek treatment. To help female patients obtain needed medical care, female physics students should be encouraged to pursue the emerging field of medical physics. This would provide a new professional opportunity for female physics students and give comfort to female patients.\n\nDesenvolvimento de uma unidade virtual para desasfaltaÃ§Ã£o de resÃ­duos pesados de petrÃ³leo para maximizaÃ§Ã£o de Ã³leo desasfaltado e daÃ­ Ã³leo lubrificante\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nAyda Karina LeÃ³n Ayala\n\n2011-01-01\n\nResumo: O aumento mundial na demanda de energia e o descobrimento de Ã³leo pesado e viscoso por parte da PETROBRAS nos Ãºltimos anos tÃªm incrementado o desenvolvimento de novas tecnologias no Brasil para o processamento deste tipo de petrÃ³leo, assim como a adequaÃ§Ã£o dos processos jÃ¡ existentes nas refinarias, visando atingir os requerimentos do mercado ao se obter produtos leves de alto valor comercial.

This is not surprising since the proportion of the syllabus devoted to physics and mathematics in an M. B. degree is indeed meagre, and the word 'computer' has been surrounded with an aura of mysticism which suggests that it is some fantastic piece of electronic gadgetry comprehensible only to a veritable genius. The clinician consequently turns to the only scientific colleague with whom he has direct contact - the medical physicist - and expects him to be an authority. The physicist is thus thrust, however unwillingly, into the forefront of the advance of computer assistance to scientific medicine. It is therefore essential for him to acquire sufficient knowledge of computing science to enable him to provide satisfactory answers for the clinicianst queries, to proffer more detailed advice as to programming convince clinicians that the computer is really a 'simpleton' which can only add and subtract and even that only under instruction.\n\nFermilab Education: Physicists\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSearch Education and Outreach: Resources and Opportunties for Fermilab employees and Users A variety of resources and opportunities are available for physicists interested in education and outreach (For general Data (6ÃÂ12) Physical Science/Physics Instructional Resources (KÃÂ12) US Particle Physics Education and\n\nGreat Physicists - The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCropper, William H\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe author, a former American chemistry professor, has organized his book into nine parts with 29 chapters, covering, in a fairly historical sequence and systematic conceptual progression, all fundamentals of today's physics: i.e., mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, relativity, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, particle physics, astronomy-astrophysics-cosmology. Obviously, the 20th century (when about 90% of professional physicists of all time worked) assumes with five topics the dominant role in this enterprise. For each topic, a small number (ranging from one to eight) of leading personalities is selected and the biographies of these 29 physicists, including two women (Marie Curie and Lise Meitner), are presented in some detail together with their achievements in the particular topic. Important relevant contributions of other scholars to each topic are also discussed. In addition, Cropper provides each of the topics with a short 'historical synopsis' justifying his selection of key persons. One may argue that concentrating on leading physicists constitutes an old-fashioned approach to displaying the history and contents of fundamental topics in physics. However, the mixture of biographies and explanation of leading contributions given here will certainly serve for a larger public, not just professional physicists and scientists, as a guide through the exciting development of physical ideas and discoveries. In general, the presentation of the material is quite satisfactory (with only few slips, e.g., in the Meitner story, where the author follows too closely a new biography) and gives the essence of the great advances in physics since the 15th century. One notices perhaps the limitation of the author in cases where no biography in English is available - this would also explain the omission of some of the main contributors to atomic and particle physics, such as Arnold Sommerfeld and Hideki Yukawa, or that French or Russian\n\nMathematics for physicists\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nMartin, B R\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMathematics for Physicists is a relatively short volume covering all the essential mathematics needed for a typical first degree in physics, from a starting point that is compatible with modern school mathematics syllabuses. Early chapters deliberately overlap with senior school mathematics, to a degree that will depend on the background of the individual reader, who may quickly skip over those topics with which he or she is already familiar. The rest of the book covers the mathematics that is usually compulsory for all students in their first two years of a typical university physics degree, plus a little more. There are worked examples throughout the text, and chapter-end problem sets.

Although Euler is famous as the leading mathematician of the 18th century, his contributions to physics are as important for their innovative methods and solutions. Several books are devoted to Euler as mathematician, but none to Euler as physicist, like in this book. Eulerâs contributions to mechanics are rooted in his life-long plan presented in two volume treatise programmatically entitled \"Mechanics or the science of motion analytically demonstrated\". Published in 1736, Eulerâs treatise indicates the turn over from the traditional geometric representation of mechanics to a new approach. In writing Mechanics Euler did the first step to put the plan and his completion into practice through 1760. It is of particular interest to study how Euler made immediate use of his mathematics for mechanics and coordinated his progress in math...\n\nPhysicist makes muon chamber sing\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis Monitored Drift Tube detector, consisting of argon-CO2-filled aluminium tubes with a wire down the centre of each, will track muons in ATLAS; Tiecke used a single tube from one of these detectors to create the pipes in his organ. Particle physicists can make good musicians; but did you know particle detectors can make good music? That's what NIKHEF physicist Henk Tiecke learned when he used pipes cut from the ATLAS Monitored Drift Tube detector (MDT) to build his own working Dutch-style barrel organ in the autumn of 2005. 'I like to work with my hands,' said Tiecke, who worked as a senior physicist at NIKHEF, Amsterdam, on ZEUS until his retirement last summer. Tiecke had already constructed his barrel organ when he visited some colleagues in the ATLAS muon chambers production area at Nikhef in 2005. He noticed that the aluminium tubes they were using to build the chambers were about three centimetres in diameter-just the right size for a pipe in a barrel organ.

Therefore the education and training of medical radiological physicists is of big importance for both diagnostics and therapy. The education of medical radiological physicists in Bulgaria is organized in two levels: university and postgraduate, which is a good achievement of Bulgarian educational system. University education is in the framework of the M. Sc. program in Medical physics with a prevalent training in medical radiological physics. Three universities in the country have been carrying out this education since more than ten years. Postgraduate education covers specialties Medical Radiological Physics and Radiation Hygiene. It is organized by the Medical University but the training is opened also to specialists outside the health care system. The interests in both levels of education and training in Medical Physics is increasing with about 40 trainees in last years. The university and postgraduate education has good quality in theory but still inadequate in practical aspects. The continuous training and qualification of medical physicists has also difficulties; the main reasons are insufficient technical and financial resources as well as the lack of interest of the staff of the training centers. The responsibilities for education and training of medical physicists in radiology should be shared between physicists and physicians in the country\n\nMÃ¡rio Schenberg: Physicist, politician and art critic\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGuzzo, M.

He worked in different fields of physics including thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, general relativity, astrophysics and mathematics. He was assistant of the Ukrainian naturalized Italian physicist Gleb Wataghin and worked with prestigious physicists like as the Brazilians JosÃ© Leite Lopes and CÃ©sar Lattes, the Russian-born American George Gamow and the Indian astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.

E-mail coccia@lngs.infn.it\n\n2005-04-01\n\nBorn in Rome in 1901, Fermi was the last universal physicist - the most extraordinary of his century. He was at home in the workshop, the laboratory and among theoretical physicists. For the theorists he was a great theorist, and for the experimentalists he was a great experimentalist. What made Fermi so special as a physicist was his universality and versatility; what made him so special as a person was his modesty, realism and frugal lifestyle. This book, which describes Fermi's contributions to physics and the US period of his life, originated from a symposium that was held in Chicago in 2001 to commemorate the centenary of his birth. But it is not merely a volume of reminiscences. It combines essays, specially commissioned articles, as well as private material from Fermi's research notebooks, correspondence and speeches. Together the material highlights the breadth of his impact on physics. A classic biographical introduction by Emilio Segre is followed by an article in which Frank Wilczek, who shared the Nobel Prize for Physics last year, puts into perspective Fermi's huge contributions to physics. The list of his achievements is impressive. They include the introduction of Fermi statistics for half-integer-spin particles (1925) - now called fermions - that led to the concept of the 'Fermi surface' in condensed-matter and nuclear physics; the vector-coupling theory for beta-decay (1933), which formulated the proper structure of the weak interaction where the 'Fermi constant' measures the strength of the coupling; and the introduction, with his Rome group, of neutron-induced radioactivity and the study of slow-neutron interactions (1934). As a researcher and a teacher, Fermi inspired two generations and two continents - a man whose charismatic nature attracted many talented scientists and students to Chicago. What emerges from this book is the gratitude of so many extraordinary physicists to their master, who instilled in them\n\nBrief, Embedded, Spontaneous Metacognitive Talk Indicates Thinking Like a Physicist\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSayre, Eleanor C.; Irving, Paul W.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nInstructors and researchers think \"thinking like a physicist\" is important for students' professional development.

Al x Ga 1-x N LEO substrates were prepared on stripe-patterned 2Î¼m-thick undoped GaN/sapphire substrates by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. To investigate the dislocation and crack density, and the surface morphology of Al x Ga 1-x N LEO substrates with different Al compositions, photoluminescence and optical microscope were used. At a 1% of Al composition, we obtained crack-free and mirror-like substrates having a low dislocation density of â¼1E6cm -2 . We expect considerable reduction in threshold current density to be achieved from blue-violet laser diodes grown on Al x Ga 1-x N LEO substrates because of the increased optical gain, as compared to the laser diodes grown on Al-free LEO substrates\n\nLiability from the view of the medical physicist\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nShalek, R.J.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe negligent performance of professional duties is the most probable type of legal action against a medical physicist. A mistake resulting from ignorance or inadvertence is an example; an error in professional judgement is not negligence if an ordinary, prudent physicist in the same situation would have made the same decision. A physicist or any hospital employee has a duty to protect his employer from liability even to the extent of reporting to the hospital medical practices which could harm the patient. Suggestions for reducing legal risk include recommendations for professional knowledge, record keeping and outside verification of important elements of operating systems\n\nPhysicists' Forced Migrations under Hitler\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBeyerchen, Alan\n\n2011-03-01\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power in early 1933 they initiated formal and informal measures that forced Jews and political opponents from public institutions such as universities. Some physicists retired and others went into industry, but most emigrated. International communication and contact made emigration a viable option despite the desperate economic times in the Great Depression. Another wave of emigrations followed the annexation of Austria in 1938. Individual cases as well as general patterns of migration and adaptation to new environments will be examined in this presentation. One important result of the forced migrations was that many of the physicists expelled under Hitler played important roles in strengthening physics elsewhere, often on the Allied side in World War II.\n\nUniversities prepare as physicists plan to pop protons\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2007-01-01\n\n\"The world's largest science experiment, a physics experiment designed to determine the nature of matter, will produce a mountain of data.

This survey and census were conducted in 1995, with an update of the census in April 1997. The agencies and the scientific community were represented for the 1995 efforts by Dr. Robert Woods (DOE), Dr. William Chinowsky (NSF), and Prof. Uriel Nauenberg (DPF); for the current census, by Dr. Robert Diebold (DOE), Dr. Marvin Goldberg (NSF), and Dr. Patricia Rankin (NSF). The survey/census were carried out with the assistance of the Particle Data Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In order to obtain an accurate study of the current workforce and of future needs, we requested that all HEP physicists fill out and return the 1995 survey. There were 2494 respondents. For the 1997 census, a representative of each university and laboratory was asked to provide information on all persons at that institution who spend at least 50% of their research time on particle physics.

This resource has grown to include networking resources, lists of LGBT-friendly universities and localities, recommendations for enacting positive change in physics communities, and out-reach to other STEM-oriented LGBT organizations. This has been possible in large part by the dynamic community of LGBT+ physicists and allies looking to make physics more welcoming towards our community. In 2011, Elena used hir position as Member at Large on the executive committee of the Forum of Graduate Student Affairs (FGSA) to conduct a climate survey that included, among other things, the first serious look at LGBT+ demographics in physics. The survey focused particularly on issues of language heard and harassment experienced by physicists and was broken down into categories based on race, physical and mental ability, gender, and sexuality. Furthermore, it examined the outcomes of experienced harassment and the reasons for when harassment was not reported. Due to the nature of the study, overlapping demographics, especially ``multiple minorities,'' were also explored. This talk will give a brief history of the LGBT+ Physicists resource as well as an overview of the FGSA study.\n\nBOOK REVIEW: Great Physicists - The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCropper, William H.\n\n2002-11-01\n\nThe author, a former American chemistry professor, has organized his book into nine parts with 29 chapters, covering, in a fairly historical sequence and systemtic conceptual progression, all fundamentals of today's physics: i.e., mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, relativity, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, particle physics, astronomy-astrophysics-cosmology. Obviously, the 20th century (when about 90% of professional physicists of all time worked) assumes with five topics the dominant role in this enterprise. For each topic, a small number (ranging from one to eight) of leading personalities is selected and the biographies of these 29 physicists, including two women (Marie Curie and Lise Meitner), are presented in some detail together with their achievements in the particular topic. Important relevant contributions of other scholars to each topic are also discussed. In addition, Cropper provides each of the topics with a short 'historical synopsis' justifying his selection of key persons. One may argue that concentrating on leading physicists constitutes an old-fashioned approach to displaying the history and contents of fundamental topics in physics. However, the mixture of biographies and explanation of leading contributions given here will certainly serve for a larger public, not just professional physicists and scientists, as a guide through the exciting development of physical ideas and discoveries. In general, the presentation of the material is quite satisfactory (with only few slips, e.g., in the Meitner story, where the author follows too closely a new biography) and gives the essence of the great advances in physics since the 15th century.

Treatment planning in more than one transverse plane is more widely practiced as the use of sophisticated computers grow. These developments emphasize the need for the physicist to have a basic knowledge of human anatomy. This course is designed to familiarize the clinical physicist with the gross anatomy and topographic landmarks used by the physician in planning three-dimensional radiation treatment volumes. The significance of the various anatomic structures and their related lymphatics in the spread of disease is discussed. Emphasis is placed on disease entities that pose particular problems due to overlying or nearby healthy structures at risk\n\nDesempenho de um trator agrÃ­cola de pneus, funcionando com misturas de Ã³leo diesel e Ã³leo de soja reutilizado\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWagner da Cunha Siqueira\n\n2011-10-01\n\nFull Text Available No Brasil, a forma de energia alternativa mais atraente tem sido a biomassa e, mais recentemente, os Ã³leos vegetais residuais e in natura.

D.; Haynes, M. P.\n\n1999-05-01\n\nGas phase abundances are one of the best measures of the intrinsic metallicity of low mass galaxies. We recently obtained low resolution long slit optical spectra of several HII regions in Leo A and GR 8 with the Palomar 5m telescope. Previous studies of the resolved stellar population of Leo A indicated that the stars have metallicities approximately 2% of solar (Tolstoy et al. 1998). Preliminary analysis of the HII region spectra, and that of a planetary nebula, indicates that the gas phase oxygen abundance of Leo A is approximately 3% of solar. This confirms the result of Skillman et al. (1989), who also derived an oxygen abundance for Leo A from a planetary nebula. Similarly, for GR 8 we find a mean oxygen abundance of 5% of solar. For all the HII regions, the derived log(N/O) is -1.5 +/- 0.1, as has been found for other low metallicity systems. These new observations of multiple HII regions in Leo A and GR 8 confirm that metals in low mass galaxies are well mixed.\n\nA DEEPER LOOK AT LEO IV: STAR FORMATION HISTORY AND EXTENDED STRUCTURE\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSand, David J.; Seth, Anil; Olszewski, Edward W.; Zaritsky, Dennis; Willman, Beth; Kallivayalil, Nitya\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe present MMT/Megacam imaging of the Leo IV dwarf galaxy in order to investigate its structure and star formation history, and to search for signs of association with the recently discovered Leo V satellite. Based on parameterized fits, we find that Leo IV is round, with Îµ h â 130 pc. Additionally, we perform a thorough search for extended structures in the plane of the sky and along the line of sight. We derive our surface brightness detection limit by implanting fake structures into our catalog with stellar populations identical to that of Leo IV. We show that we are sensitive to stream-like structures with surface brightness Î¼ r â¼ -2 , and at this limit we find no stellar bridge between Leo IV (out to a radius of â¼0.5 kpc) and the recently discovered, nearby satellite Leo V. Using the color-magnitude fitting package StarFISH, we determine that Leo IV is consistent with a single age (â¼14 Gyr), single metallicity ([Fe/H] â¼ -2.3) stellar population, although we cannot rule out a significant spread in these values. We derive a luminosity of M V = -5.5 Â± 0.3. Studying both the spatial distribution and frequency of Leo IV's 'blue plume' stars reveals evidence for a young (â¼2 Gyr) stellar population which makes up â¼2% of its stellar mass. This sprinkling of star formation, only detectable in this deep study, highlights the need for further imaging of the new Milky Way satellites along with theoretical work on the expected, detailed properties of these possible 'reionization fossils'.\n\nSzilard-Chalmers effect in solid H I O{sub 4}. 2 H{sub 2} O by neutron irradiation (source-reactor)\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nTakriti, S [radiochemistry laboratory, syrian atomic energy commission P.O. Box 6091 Damascus, (Syrian Arab Republic)\n\n1995-10-01\n\nThe Szilard-Chalmers effect in solid periodic acid was investigated. In order to study the initial distribution of {sup 128I} o{sub 4} as a function of neutron flux, samples were irradiated utilizing both neutron source ({sup 241} Am-Be), the manual vertical irradiation channel and the thermal column of ET-R R-1 research reactor in Egypt. The initial retention reached a maximum of 40% after 120 minutes at 5.5 x 10 {sup 8} n s{sup -1} cm {sup -2}. The data was analysed using first order reaction. As a result, the activation Ko= 2.82 x 10 {sup 11} (S{sup -1}), respectively. Kinetics comparison of the dehydration and irradiation reactions for this solid showed disorder in the crystallographic form. Such disorder may be the result of dehydration or irradiation reactions, where the loss of water molecule will lead to formation of vacancies which, in turn, are responsible for the distribution process. 6 figs., 1 tab.\n\nSzilard-Chalmers cation recoil studies in zeolites X and Y\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLai, P.P.; Rees, L.V.C.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nThe Szilard-Chalmers recoil of the cations Rb + , Cs + , Ba 2+ , La 3+ , Co 2+ , Zn 2+ , Cu 2+ and Na + from the sodalite cage and hexagonal prism sites into the supercage sites of zeolites X and Y has been studied. This study is complementary to that described in Lai et al, JCS Faraday I; 72:181 (1976). It has been found that these cations recoil from the sodalite cage sites into the supercage sites with a probability of approximately 90% whereas the corresponding probability for these cations in the hexagonal prism sites (site I) is between 40 and 50% depending on the cation. It is thus possible to determine the preferences shown by these cations for these 'locked-in' sites as a function of temperature of calcination, Tsub(c), concentration and type of other cations contained in these sites. In these studies the cations present in the supercage sites before irradiation were usually NH 4 + but Ba 2+ , Ca 2+ and Na + have also been used. When Tsub(c) > 400 0 C, Rb + and Cs + began to populate site I. These ions populated this site in zeolite X at lower calcination temperatures than required for zeolite Y. When Tsub(c) was increased from 110 to 220 0 C the occupancy of site I by Ba 2+ was greatly enhanced and when Tsub(c) > 440 0 C Ba 2+ ions now occupied this site in preference to all other 'locked-in' sites. Barium exhibited a higher affinity for site I in zeolite X than in zeolite Y when Tsub(c) = 110 0 C. If dehydrated La-Y was assumed to have 5 La 3+ ions per u.c. in site I, the hydration of this material did not change the concentration of La 3+ in site I. Co 2+ , Zn 2+ and Cu 2+ ions all exhibited similar affinities for the 'locked-in' sites of zeolites X and Y. (author)\n\nTHE ARECIBO LEGACY FAST ALFA SURVEY. IX. THE LEO REGION H I CATALOG, GROUP MEMBERSHIP, AND THE H I MASS FUNCTION FOR THE LEO I GROUP\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nStierwalt, Sabrina; Haynes, Martha P.; Giovanelli, Riccardo; Martin, Ann M.; Kent, Brian R.; Saintonge, Amelie; Karachentsev, Igor D.; Karachentseva, Valentina E.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe present the catalog of H I sources extracted from the ongoing Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) extragalactic H I line survey, found within the sky region bounded by 9 h 36 m h 36 m and +08 0 0 . The H I catalog presented here for this 118 deg 2 region is combined with the ones derived from surrounding regions also covered by the ALFALFA survey to examine the large-scale structure in the complex Leo region. Because of the combination of wide sky coverage and superior sensitivity, spatial and spectral resolution, the ALFALFA H I catalog of the Leo region improves significantly on the numbers of low H I mass sources as compared with those found in previous H I surveys. The H I mass function of the Leo I group presented here is dominated by low-mass objects: 45 of the 65 Leo I members have M H I 8 M-odot, yielding tight constraints on the low-mass slope of the Leo I H I mass function. The best-fit slope is Î± â -1.41 + 0.2 - 0.1. A direct comparison between the ALFALFA H I line detections and an optical search of the Leo I region proves the advantage of the ALFALFA strategy in finding low-mass, gas-rich dwarfs. These results suggest the existence of a significant population of low surface brightness, gas-rich, yet still very low H I mass galaxies, and may reflect the same type of morphological segregation as is seen in the Local Group. While the low-mass end slope of the Leo I H I mass function is steeper than that determined for luminosity functions of the group, the slope still falls short of the values predicted by simulations of structure formation in the lambda cold dark matter paradigm.\n\nThirty year celebration of the contribution of nuclear medicine physicists in Australia\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWalker, B. M.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFull text: The intention of this article is to describe the contributions of the many nuclear medicine physicists who in a large or small way have added to the ongoing development of nuclear medicine in Australia from the first years of the discipline in the late 1960s to the present time. Unlike our colleagues in radiation oncology physics, the nuclear medicine physicist fraternity has always been a very small group which unfortunately has not expanded greatly over the 30 years and beyond. This is emphasized in the survey by W.H.Round 1 which showed the bias towards older physicists being involved in the discipline. Because of the small numbers of nuclear medicine physicists in the public hospital system, mostly one or two per teaching hospital, most physicists are heavily involved in clinical duties to keep up the high standard of equipment and software performance required. Many nuclear medicine physicists also have the dual role of hospital radiation safety officers which is becoming more demanding as radiation legislation increases. For this reason much of the pure research has been confined to the hospitals with larger numbers of physicists. However a high proportion of nuclear medicine physicists across the country have contributed greatly to clinical research and development as part of their job. Unfortunately these cannot all be recognised in this article. Young physicists may not realise how much 'in house' research and development was carried out by physicists in the early years of nuclear medicine when equipment companies did not provide the software which is now available to purchase. Many of these innovative techniques and software, described in this article, are still in use today. Some of the 'big events' in the history of nuclear medicine in Australia in which physicists have played a leading role will also be highlighted.

Se echÃ³ varias veces petrÃ³leo en las paredes exteriores y en el suelo alrededor de casas en la zona verrucÃ³gena del RÃ­mac, donde son abundantes las titiras. Inmediatamente despuÃ©s de cada petrolizaciÃ³n se redujeron a nÃºmeros insignificantes las titiras dentro de las casas, efecto que durÃ³ aproximadamente una semana.\n\nMorfometria testicular de cabritos alimentados com Ã³leo de licuri (Syagrus coronata\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nL.P. Barbosa\n\n2012-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Determinou-se o desenvolvimento testicular de caprinos prÃ©-pÃºberes alimentados com Ã³leo de licuri (Syagrus coronata na dieta. Foram utilizados 19 cabritos Â¾ Boer, recÃ©m-desmamados, com mÃ©dia de idade de trÃªs meses. Os animais, submetidos a um perÃ­odo de 75 dias de confinamento, receberam alimentaÃ§Ã£o composta por: farelo de milho, farelo de soja, feno picado de tifton 85 e de Ã³leo de licuri com base na matÃ©ria seca. Os animais foram distribuÃ­dos em quatro grupos: sem lipÃ­dio adicional (n= 5; com 1,5% de Ã³leo de licuri (n= 5; com 3,0% de Ã³leo de licuri (n= 5; e com 4,5% de Ã³leo de licuri (n= 4. As avaliaÃ§Ãµes de peso corporal e de biometria testicular foram realizadas quinzenalmente. ApÃ³s o perÃ­odo de confinamento, os animais foram abatidos para determinaÃ§Ã£o do peso dos testÃ­culos, peso dos epidÃ­dimos e Ã­ndice gonadossomÃ¡tico. A adiÃ§Ã£o de Ã³leo de licuri em atÃ© 4,5% na dieta de caprinos prÃ©-pÃºberes nÃ£o alterou o desenvolvimento testicular com base nas caracterÃ­sticas da biometria e morfometria testicular, indicando que a inclusÃ£o de atÃ© 4,5% de Ã³leo de licuri na dieta pode ser utilizada.\n\nClinical training of medical physicists. IAEA experience in Asia\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMcLean, D.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nMedical physicists make a major contribution to the safe and effective diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer and other illnesses. The medical physicist's responsibilities include the major areas of dosimetry, treatment planning, quality assurance, image quality, optimization, equipment management, research, teaching, and radiation safety. With the increasing complexity of technological application to medicine the competence of trained physicists is critical to good patient care, with counter examples, sadly evident in the literature. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in conjunction with international experts, including from Japan, has developed clinical training programmes that have been successfully implemented on a pilot basis in a number of countries in Asia. A new project is to begin in 2014 which will focus increasingly on the use of electronic teaching material and experiences, to assist medical physicists in clinical training increasingly in more remote locations in Asia.
