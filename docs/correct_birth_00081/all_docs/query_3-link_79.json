        "text": "While foolproof is a pretty lofty target, I would recommend sticking with a OSX's Time Machine feature, but replacing your NAS, Time Capsule, and other external drives with an HP MediaSmart Server.\n\nWith current drive sizes, you can get 8+ TB of storage in the MediaSmart, and they have full support for Time Machine backups. They're fast, reliable, powerful, and a good value -- certainly a much better option than the Drobo for just about any home storage/NAS scenario I can think of.\n\nThere are a lot of other great reasons to go with one of these, too -- see more raves (from me and others) about them in these answers:\n\nAny recommendations on a NAS for a home-super-user?\n\nWhat are my options for a multi-Terabyte home NAS?\n\nYou may want to look at a Drobo, and a few cheap terabyte drives. Mac users seem to love those things.\n\nI've heard from Mac users that have used BackBlaze successfully by putting terabytes of data up on the cloud. I couldn't find a way to easily say only backup these folders, which was disappointing. If a disaster happens they will mail you your data instead of having to download it all.\n\nI use a combination of a local backup run nightly and JungleDisk, but for that quantity of data it would be pricey.\n\nThere are companies that offers cloud backup and cloud disaster recovery as a service. The best ones are those who keeps an updated version of your data all the time and when a disaster strikes - they immediately take action and replace the data on your site. This way, people who are browsing your data won't feel the downtime/other disasters. Where I work we have this service (we have our most sensitive data online and we can't have a downtime or a disaster without a backup plan). We use Cloudendure and we are very happy with their cloud services."
