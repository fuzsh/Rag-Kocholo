        "text": "Just a short note to “Save the Date”— November 28-29, 2016 — for the next meeting of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) - Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Standing Committee on Offshore Science and Assessment, also known as COSA. It will take place at the historic National Academy of Sciences building, 2101 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20418.\n\nThe agenda is being developed and will build upon recommendations from past meetings. We will send you the agenda as soon as it is available, with updated links to watch the live webcast and to submit questions online. To attend in person, please register in advance since space will be limited. The meeting will be open to media and the public.\n\nAs the committee enters its second year, videos from the previous meetings are available on the NAS website. The committee encompasses a broad range of expertise in both natural and social sciences, relevant disciplines within those broad areas, and collective expertise from academia, industry, government, and the non-profit world in all four Outer Continental Shelf regions.\n\nMarjorie Weisskohl, APR\n\nOffice of Public Affairs\n\n(Environmental Studies Program and Marine Minerals Program)\n\n703-787-1304 (office)\n\n202-615-7509 (cell)\n\n-BOEM-"
