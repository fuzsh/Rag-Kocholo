        "text": "The speed of light has been known for decades, but how about the speed of culture?\n\nThere I was, minding my own business, enjoying a lazy and sunny Saturday after the Los Altos wine and art festival, a bit too much on the hot side of the street. To get a break from the heat, I went inside the library, which was only a few blocks away. I stumbled into a book, not by accident, written by J.A. English-Lueck, Cultures at Silicon Valley. It does a fantastic job in painting scenery by long narratives of real people's lives in the valley, from research, drawing on nearly a decade of ethnographic work. And how they spread.\n\n\"The notion that a culture can be identified with its ecnonomic specialization - and the technology associated with it - is a very old and widespread idea.\" and the authors discuss examples with the shell gatherers, up to the automobile industry in Detroit.\n\n\"The high-tech industrial base in Silicon Valley is based on such industries as research, development, and production in aerospace and defense; semiconductors; computers; software; telecommunications; and biotechnology. All of of these have played a part in the evolution of its economy. In technologically saturated communities, the daily pervasive economic presence of technology define people's social relations and images of the world. On the individual level, people extend the logic and methods of project-based work to the rest of life.\"\n\nBut before we go deepe into the theme, here is a snapshot of another festival, (not the Art & Wine in Los Altos) one about music in Sunnyvale. Can you spot the sponsors?\n\nGoogle, LinkedIn, Walmart Labs, plus some more. Did I interact with people on the street? Yes, I did. From my not-so-scientific sample, I gathered that the people there were NOT high-tech in the vast majority. They worked in retail, motorcycle shops, bakeries, appliances services, all walks of life, including recruiters. You could almost see the web, the links between people coming from customer-vendor relationships, the house-next-door neighbors, the teacher-pupil, the buddies that met once in a bar and have been going out for a beer since then.\n\nSeveral times I had set my mind on writing articles connecting the history of Silicon Valley as the birthplace for incredibly successful technology companies, the local people and the effect of the environment on the culture of these companies, and the relationships between people inside and outside this companies making it a for tile ground for them to grow. So I did not find a book by accident, I actually search for something like that.\n\nAnother book that I looked at talked about the different breakthroughs that happened in the region, scientific and from other bodies of knowledge, in the last 100 years. One that made me recall my college years, studying aerospace engineering, was the article about Michelson and Morley. Seven years before Albert Einstein published the article on the theory of relativity, these two scientists set out to prove that light traveled inside a medium. They postulated that like soundwaves on water, electricity on a copper wire, light also needed a road made up of some material on which to travel on. So they devised the groundbreaking experience called, obviously, the Michelson-Morley experiment (http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Michelson-MorleyExperiment.html).\n\nThe experiment itself was a huge failure, because it proved that light travels at the same speed in every direction, and thus proving that it requires no medium at all. I transpose this question to the propagation of culture from one region to another, and also from one company to its employees on close and distant office, as well as to business partners.\n\nHow does this happen? How fast does culture travel ? The question sparked my curiosity, and I started thinking of what are the elements that make something as abstract as “culture” travel - from the founder’s vision and expectations down to the chief operational executives and to its’ managers and employees.\n\nAnother element of the story is that Mickelson himself is a transplant from Poland. He grew up in California, but his family came to this country bringing their own beliefs, values, culture, and some of that was fundamental to what happened.\n\nNow fast-forward to a hundred years later, and then you have companies like HP, Facebook, Salesforce, Twitter, Uber, being born or incubated in the San Francisco Bay Area. At work, you’ll find engineers with many cultural differences. Some celebrating the Chinese new year and some Cinco de Mayo. Their lunchboxes have completely different smells, tastes and ingredients. But at their desks, it is technology that makes the main dish. If it was just engineers from India, this particular company might not have happened. If it was just Brazilians, Taiwanese, Russians or just Chinese, it would not have happened. All these engineers and computer scientists, marketers and product managers come from different code countries and it is possible that cultural diversity is why the expanded Silicon Valley is so successful today.\n\nIt is possible that the combination of many different styles and cultural traits is the secret sauce that puts all these engineering and technical skills into unbeatable teams. Not only that knowledge that goes deep into a dozen different areas, filling all the gaps, but also the way of thinking that create challenges for the Irish work together with Ukrainians inside a Silicon Valley startup. People coming from everywhere from New England to Argentina.\n\nWhat are the cultural forces that will significantly shape the future in California, the rest of the United States and the world, in your opinion? Is there anything that will completely change this melting pot and the way the brew goes?"
