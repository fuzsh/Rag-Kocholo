        "text": "From hawking tapes on the street in the Bronx to a multibillion dollar international industry, hip-hop has grown tremendously in the last 50 years since it was born.\n\nHip-hop is now a multibillion dollar market that reached almost every major industry of the economy, including the food and beverage industry.\n\nJust outside of Mill Pond Park in the Bronx, hungry patrons line up outside of The Hip-hop Food Truck at the Universal Hip-Hop Museum Block Party on Friday.\n\nâAny hip-hop events you gotta have [on] The Hip-hop Food Truck. If not, itâs not an official hip hop event,â Alfredo Estrada, chef and owner of the Hip-Hop Food Truck, said.\n\nIt doesnât get much more official than the 50th anniversary of the birth of hip-hop.\n\nEstrada names his dishes after some of his favorite rappers and keeps hits blaring from the truckâs speakers.\n\nâI got the B-I-G fried chicken sandwich,â he said. âI got the Hattie Racks jerked chopped cheese. I got the Godo burger which is named after Fred the godson. We have Wu wings, nine different flavors, nine members. I got the big pun Cuban.â\n\nNot only was a worldwide musical genre born in the Bronx 50 years ago, the creation of hip-hop also spawned countless businesses that cater to hip-hop lovers, small and large.\n\nâFrom fashion, an art perspective, business management companies that specialize in touring and artist publishing companies,â hip-hop executive turned entrepreneur, Robert âDon Poohâ Cummins, said.\n\nItâs something Cummins has firsthand experienced with. After helping to develop the careers of some of hip-hopâs biggest names, he transferred his skills to the business world, where he became the owner of a number of chain eateries and eventually opened the Brooklyn Chop House. The upscale, Asian fusion steak house plays hip-hop music and caters to artists and industry power brokers.\n\nâThe background music, itâs the soundtrack of hip-hop and R&B,â he said. âSo, like when we go to most upscale restaurants, you really donât hear that as often.â\n\nAlthough it eventually bounced back, like almost all eateries, the Chop House hit tough times during the pandemic.\n\nBut The Hip-hop Food Truck. was actually born from it. After being furloughed from his job during the pandemic, Estrada combined his love of music and food to get himself back on his feet.\n\nâAfter cooking for 25 years I wanted to do something that I loved,â Estrada said. âSomething that I love is cooking and hip-hop raised me, so it was just natural for me to link the two. I thought it would be fun.â\n\nForbes currently estimates hip hop to be an $8 billion market.\n\nRobert âDon Poohâ Cummins is working on expanding the Brooklyn Chop house to several more cities.\n\nPatrons can find The Hip-hop Food Truck. in one of the five boroughs on any given day."
