        "text": "Legendary MC to Return to Queens to Help Feed New Yorkers in Need on Sept. 23 at the historic Forest Hills Stadium\n\nâ\n\nNEWÂ YORKÂ (August 9, 2021) Grammy winning and legendary hip-hop artist Nas announced today the âConcert to Feed NYCâ on Thursday, Sept. 23 at the historic Forest Hills Stadium in Queens. Proceeds from the concert will benefit City Harvest, New York Cityâs first and largest food rescue organization, during a time of historic food insecurity across the city, and the costs of the venue have been generously donated.\n\nNasâwho was born in Brooklyn and raised in the Queensbridge Houses in Long Island City, Queensâis a longtime supporter of City Harvest. The Concert to Feed NYC will be Nasâ first live show in his hometown in nearly three years.\n\nLast week Nas dropped Kingâs Disease II via Mass Appeal!\n\nKingâs Disease II is a sequel to Nasâ GRAMMY Award winning album Kingâs Disease, which was released in August 2020 to rave reviews.\n\nAs New York City begins its long recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, countless New Yorkers will continue to feel the economic pain of the pandemic for months or years to come. The Concert to Feed NYC will help support City Harvestâs efforts to ensure that no New Yorker will have to worry about where their next meal is coming from.\n\nâI am looking forward to returning to stage for a performance in my hometownâespecially since it supports a cause a care deeply about,â said Nas.\n\nThe Concert to Feed NYC will be an exclusive event for 4,000, featuring Speakeasy suites, minilounges, and lounge-style seating. Through its long and deep partnerships with the cityâs restaurant community, City Harvest will bring high-end culinary experiences to the evening, as well. Event sponsor DKNY will also be creating exclusive merchandise for the concert, with sales benefitting City Harvest.\n\nSamlyn Capital founder, Rob Pohly, who will underwrite all venue-related expenses for the event, said, \"I'm a huge Nas fan and a big believer in the important work City Harvest does. I'm excited to be a part of this incredible evening of awesome music, all to help feed New Yorkers in need.â\n\nDuring the pandemic, the need for food surged across the cityâsoaring 41% among all New Yorkers and a shocking 53% among children. Since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, City Harvest has rescued more than 190 million pounds of food and delivered it, free of charge, to hundreds of soup kitchens and food pantries across the five boroughsâan unprecedented effort that was more than double the amount of food the organization rescued and delivered over the same time period pre-pandemic.\n\n\"The Concert to Feed NYC will help us rescue and deliver more food for the many New Yorkers who are struggling to put meals on their tables because of the pandemic, many for the first time,â said Jilly Stephens, CEO of City Harvest. âWe are so grateful to have a dedicated and passionate friend in Nas who will create such a special evening to support our work. Together, we can feed our city.â\n\nâMimi Eayrs and I are thrilled to produce Nas and The Concert to Feed NYC with our longtime partner City Harvest,â said Josh Wood of Josh Wood Productions. âThe COVID crisis is far from over, and itâs our duty as New Yorkers to create new ways to fundraise for City Harvestâ¦and whatâs more New York than Nas and City Harvest together?â\n\nTickets go on sale on Friday, August 13 at ForestHillsStadium.com. More details will be released in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Concert to Feed NYC is generously sponsored by DKNY.\n\nâ\n\nAbout Nas\n\nNas (Nasir Jones) first reached an international audience when his track âHalftimeâ was tapped by producer MC Serch as the opening cut on 1992âs Zebrahead movie soundtrack. Signed to Columbia Records, the first full-length album by poet and rhyme-master Nas arrived in 1994, Illmatic. The RIAA platinum hip-hop landmark featured âIt Ainât Hard To Tell,â âThe World Is Yours,â and âOne.â 1996 brought the breakthrough double-platinum It Was Written (#1 R&B for 7 weeks, #1 pop for 4 weeks), with his first major crossover singles âStreet Dreamsâ and âIf I Ruled the World (Imagine That).â\n\nSuccess continued with the double-platinum I Am in 1999 (again #1 pop and #1 R&B), with the chart singles âNas Is Like,â âHate Me Nowâ (featuring Puff Daddy), and âYou Wonât See Me Tonightâ (featuring Aaliyah). Subsequent albums by Nas included: the RIAA platinum Nastradamus (1999, #2 R&B, #7 pop, with âNastradamusâ and âYou Owe Me,â featuring Ginuwine); the platinum Stillmatic (2001, #1 R&B, #5 pop, with âGot Ur Self Aâ¦,â â âOne Mic,â and âRuleâ); the platinum Godâs Son (2002, #1 R&B, with huge R&B/pop crossover hits âMade You Lookâ and âI Canâ); and the platinum double- CD Streetâs Disciple (2004, #2 R&B, #5 pop, with âBridging the Gapâ and âJust a Momentâ). And his 2012 album, Life Is Good earned him 4 Grammy nominations including Rap Album of the Year and is certified RIAA gold.\n\nOver the years, Nas has also been the featured guest on a number of crossover hits by other artists, among them: Allure (âHead Over Heels,â 1997); Missy Elliott (the #1 âHot Boyz,â 1999); fellow Queensbridge rapper Mobb Deep (âItâs Mine,â 1999); Jagged Edge (âI Got It 2,â 2002); J-Lo (âIâm Gonna Be Alright,â 2002); Kanye West (âClassic (Better Than Iâve Ever Been),â 2006); DJ Khaled (âNas Album Done,â 2016); Swizz Beats (âEcho,â 2018); Jhene Aiko (â10K Hours,â 2020) and others.\n\nIn August 2020, Nas released Kingâs Disease. Kingâs Disease marked Nasâ first new album in 2 years. The album was entirely produced by Hit-Boy, and Gabriel âG Codeâ Zardes serves as the albums coexecutive producer. The album won âBest Rap Albumâ at the 2021 GRAMMYs, marking Nasâ first ever GRAMMY win.\n\nIn addition to his successful career in music, Nas has pursued a career in motion pictures that began with his co-starring role (alongside DMX) in 1998âs cult classic crime drama Belly, a film by director Hype Williams (with whom Nas has done several music videos). Most recently, he was the executive producer of the 2016 Netflix series The Get Down.\n\nNas is also the co-founder of Mass Appeal Records.\n\nâ\n\nAbout City Harvest\n\nCity Harvest is New Yorkâs first and largest food rescue organization, helping to feed millions of New Yorkers who struggle to put meals on their tables.
