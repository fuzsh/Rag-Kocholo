        "text": "We live in a small city in North Carolina and experience more power failures than we like... between nasty T-Storms and various creatures chewing on the power lines!\n\nI have an NAD system as well as two Pulse 2i's, all hardwired. I have a Flex but it is not usually plugged in as I mostly use it with Bluetooth and my phone when traveling.\n\nI have discovered a few issues: (1) Sirius always requires a re-login after an abrupt shutdown if I was using it, and (2) I may need to reload Tidal if it was playing. So far Deezer has always come back.\n\nThe latest was access to my NAS library failed during the last power failure. I have 170K tracks. Usually they take a half hour to reindex. Well after the last power failure, the tracks were listed, but Bluesound couldn't play them. I had to rebuild the indexes and all was good. However, rebuilding literally took 12 hours. I am now a little apprehensive about the next reindex.\n\nThe issues only seem to occur if the desktop or android apps are actually running any of my systems. If I am not streaming or using my NAS there are no issues.\n\nI just thought I would share: sometimes it takes a little digging, but usually you can figure out what needs to be done."
