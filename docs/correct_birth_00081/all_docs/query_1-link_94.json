        "text": "yo yo yo fleshy mammals its your boi Will and today I will be talking about Nas, a rapper.\n\nEarly Life: Born Nasir Jones, in Queens, New York, on September 14, 1973, Nas is the son of jazz musician Olu Dara. He was raised in Queensbridge Houses — the largest public-housing project in America — where he wrote stories about his life growing up there. Despite his talent for writing, Nas dropped out of school in eighth grade, and his life on the streets would fuel a new style of writing: rap lyrics. His first mentor was Willy “Ill Will” Graham, who would play him hip-hop records and DJ as Nas rapped. In 1991, rapping as Nasty Nas, he made a stunning debut with a guest verse on “Live at the Barbecue” by Main Source. Nas’ verse was a seamless melding of his writing skills and his street knowledge. The track was produced by Large Professor, who subsequently produced many of Nas’ early demos and continued to work with him throughout his career. In the wake of “Barbecue,” Nas was asked to contribute to the soundtrack for the film Zebrahead — a sort of hip-hop Romeo and Juliet set in Detroit — and the resulting song, “Halftime,” another collaboration with Large Professor, became his debut single in 1992.\n\nThe Start of Rapping: in 1994, Nas released iLLMatic, his Debut album. It is arguably the best album made my Nas, because it made him famous. 2 years later in 1996 Nas released It Was Written, and it peaked at #1 on the billboard top 100. He then joined the short-lived supergroup The Firm, teaming up with Dr. Dre, Foxy Brown, Nature and AZ to release the somewhat disappointing The Firm: The Album in 1997. It wasn’t very good.\n\nBeef with Jay-Z: In 1999 Nas’s output continued to combine commercial singles with more experimental and street fare. He also created the persona of Nas Escobar for his more gangster and crime-rhyme influenced verses. First up was “I Am…,” which hit No. 1 on both the pop and R&B charts, fueled by singles including “Nas Is Like” and “Hate Me Now,” featuring Sean “Puffy” Combs. Later that year, Nas released Nastradamus, which peaked at No. 7 on the pop chart and No. 2 on the R&B chart. With success came conflict. He became embroiled in a feud with Jay Z, each claiming the throne in the New York rap scene following the death of Biggie Smalls in 1997. In 2001, Nas came out with Stillmatic, and the album addressed the roiling rivalry head-on by attacking Jay Z’s The Blueprint. Nas’ “Ether” and Jay Z’s “Takeover” were the two main salvos in this battle. “It wasn’t just about being the top guy in rap,” Nas later told Zane Lowe in an interview, “it felt like we were leaders of nations.” The feud was eventually resolved, but along the way Nas would tangle with the likes of 50 Cent and G-Unit. Fortunately none of the beefs escalated to the levels of the East Coast/West Coast war that claimed the lives of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls.\n\nAfter Beef: All the while, Nas kept the albums coming, God’s Son (2002) was hailed as his one of his best yet. The Salaam Remi-produced single “Made You Look” became a hardcore hip hop smash that still packs club dancefloors today. This was followed by the double album Street Disciple (2004) and Hip Hop Is Dead (2006), both of which underscored Nas’ status as one of his generation’s top rappers. Hip Hop Is Dead is notable for being Nas’ first release on Def Jam Records, whose president at the time was his former rival Jay Z. The two even collaborated on the track “Black Republican.” Untitled in 2008 was originally going to be called N-gg-r, until protests persuaded Nas to change it.\n\nIn 2005, Nas married the R&B singer Kelis, but the union officially ended in 2010. He addressed the breakup on the album he made with Damian Marley, Distant Relatives in 2010 and again in 2012 on his album Life Is Good, the cover of which featured an image of the rapper holding his ex-wife’s wedding dress. Life Is Good earned Nas a Grammy nod in 2013, an award he has never won despite numerous nominations. He has not released an album since, but there is rumor he will release an album soon."
