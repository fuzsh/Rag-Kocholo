Legendary Brooklyn-born rapper-turned-financier Nas has rented a Tribeca apartment asking $16,500 a month.

The two-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath spread is at the Enrique Norten-designed One York, which boasts the city’s first automated robo parking garage.

Nas — born Nasir Jones — co-founded tech-investment firm QueensBridge Venture Partners with his manager, Anthony Saleh.

The rapper-investor-entrepreneur is now also working with Resorts World Casino New York City, which is pushing a $5 billion expansion plan to create a Las Vegas-style casino and revitalization of Jamaica, Queens.

In an Instagram post, Nas called it “an ambitious project that will give new opportunities to the hardworking families who call Queens home.”

His new sixth-floor corner condo is 1,714 square feet and comes with a private terrace. Other perks include a large living area with floor-to-ceiling windows showcasing city views, 13-feet-tall ceilings, a chef’s kitchen and a bedroom suite with a walk-in closet and spa-like bath.

Past and present sporty residents of the building include Colin Kaepernick and hockey star Derick Brassard. One York boasts an outdoor heated pool, a sundeck and a gym.
