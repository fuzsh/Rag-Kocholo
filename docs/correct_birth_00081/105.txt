Nasir Jones, better known by his stage name Nas, is an American rapper whose most popular and debut album, Illmatic, has been described as one of the most representative albums of New York City. He was born in LeFrak City but raised in Long Island City, at the Queensbridge Houses, the largest public housing project in New York. Nas wrote many stories about his life growing up there, which later inspired his lyrics.

Back in the 1980s and 1990s, Queensbridge was plagued with crime, and was not a safe place to grow up. However, it did give Nas his musical background, since he was always surrounded by boomboxes blasting hip-hop.

Everything Nas encountered at an early age provided him with an abundance of experiences that led to his critically acclaimed album.

In 1994, Illmatic was released and was immediately met with praise. It was humble and frank, demonstrating what his life in Queensbridge was like, as well as how much his life has changed since he left. Years after that album was released, Nas said, “The posh penthouses still feel foreign, and the harsh streets all too familiar.”
