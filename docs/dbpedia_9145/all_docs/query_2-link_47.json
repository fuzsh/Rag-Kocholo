SAMBA QUETZAL\n\nThe inspiration for the new EP , &quot;Song of the Quetzal&quot; came during my stay on a sacred mountain in Costa Rica duirng the 1st week of lockdown, March 2020!\r\n\r\nOn this Mountain Top during my wanderings through the National Park, I was fortunate to see 2 rare Quetzal birds in their tree, almost camouflaged but for their famous double tailfeathers dangling from the branches..\r\nThe lyrics for Mountain Top were a strong communication from the nature up there...where it seemed the whole world had come to a standstill and there was silence......",
