        "text": "Inspired by the music and multicultural fabric of L.A., Grammy-winning Quetzal embraces the concept of “artivism” with the goal of using music to inspire social change.\n\nThe band’s latest album, “The Eternal Getdown,” to be released Saturday on Smithsonian Folkways Recordings, continues this tradition with 18 tracks that incorporate various musical genres with a bit of a cultural history lesson that touches on topics of resistance, resilience and social justice often through indigenous perspectives.\n\nBut it’s also a fun record driven by top-notch musicianship and an undeniably positive spirit.\n\nLed by East L.A. natives Martha González and Quetzal Flores, the band will show off this musical spirit Saturday night with an album release concert at the Aratani Theatre in downtown L.A.\n\nFlores and González talked about the new album and their ongoing drive to inspire social change through music.\n\nQ: You’re known for your culturally diverse music. What sounds and genres do we hear on this new album?\n\nA: (González) There’s definitely a lot of son jarocho.\n\n(Flores) You also hear a lot of rock as well, you hear some funk, R&B. You hear Afro-Cuban grooves.\n\nQ: Do you consider these genres part of the L.A. sound?\n\nA: (Flores) Oh yes they’re definitely L.A. sounds but more importantly they’re referencing ancestral knowledge.\n\nWe’re borrowing from the collective wisdom of people who were forcefully taken from their land and enslaved and also from indigenous people who together with African American, or then Africans, created these ways of articulating themselves as musicians but also as a way of building back their humanity that had been stripped from them.\n\nQ: You’ve described writing songs as “storytelling.” What stories do we hear in this album?\n\nA: (González) In one of the first songs (“Espejos vs. The Gaze”) I look at how people in Western society look at indigenous people.\n\nI was in Mexico when I saw this one very elite Mexican woman abuse basically an indigenous person that was selling some embroidery.\n\nThe way in which she talked to her how la queria humillar (she wanted to humiliate her) … on top of trying to abuse her and calling her names later she tried to get a better price for what she was going to buy.\n\nSo we wrote this entire song based on how I imagined this woman would yell back and what she would tell her. So some of this is imaginative and there are a lot of ideas on what our world could look like. There are a lot of futuristic ideas as well, we really dabble also in a number of deities.\n\nQ: Since activism and social justice have always been important to you, how has the current political climate affected you as artists?\n\nA: (González) We’ve always been involved, it’s always been something we’ve taken up, social justice, issues of our time … so it’s always been something we’ve taken very seriously.\n\nThese times personally aren’t very different for me. Everybody else is a little more involved and cares about what’s happening but we’ve always had our ear to the ground and understand what the realities are of the politics of this country.\n\nI would say it has changed nothing, we continue to do the work that we do, I think everyone else is paying better attention.\n\nQ: This is also a fun album. Is this a sort of celebration of the culture and music of L.A.?\n\nA: (González) Totally. I think that we represent some of the most intricate and interesting sounds, not made for industry but that have an ear to the community.\n\nOur music is always about celebrating. Yes it’s about asking questions but mostly about celebrating, about imagining new realities, about generating hope.\n\nQ: Ultimately how do you want this album to make people feel?\n\nA: (Flores) I’d like folks to feel hopeful. I’d like them to feel angry in the most constructive way. I’d like them to feel regenerated and compassionate.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: Quetzal record release party.\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Saturday.\n\nWhere: Aratani Theatre, 244 S. San Pedro St., Los Angeles.\n\nTickets: $25-$35.\n\nInformation: www.jaccc.org."
