Describing the band’s influences, Artist-scholar-producer Dr. Alex Chavez states, “You hear students of Chicano rock, rhythm and blues, JB funk, Cuban batá, punk, and Motown soul. You hear a band that has cut its teeth organizing, that has worked to fight forms of oppression in the communities they are connected to. And in pursuit of forging these creative and political bridges, you hear artists who are at the epicenter of the transnational world of Son Jarocho.”\n\nFor 30 years they have graced stages across the US, Canada, Asia and Mexico. Recognized by notable institutions such as the Library of Congress and The Kennedy Center, the traveling exhibit “American Sabor: Latinos in U.S. Popular Music” sponsored by the Smithsonian Institute, featured Quetzal as leaders and innovators of Chicano music.\n\nView on Website Add to Google Calendar\n\nGreen Music Center, Weill Hall, Sonoma State University"
