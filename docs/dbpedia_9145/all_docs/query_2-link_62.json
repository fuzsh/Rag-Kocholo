        "meta_description": "1. In 2005, the Bank of Guatemala (Banguat) adopted an IT framework along with a rule based mechanism for interventions in the Foreign Exchange (FX) market. Following a period of relative disfavor in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many central banks in Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) started to introduce Inflation Targeting (IT) frameworks with de jure floating but de facto rigid exchange rates. At the outset, fixed, predetermined, or quasi-fixed nominal exchange rates were viewed as an effective device for guiding a disinflation program as it was said it could rapidly generate a convergence toward the country for which the nominal exchange rate is anchored.2 It was also implied that such arrangement was transitory.3 Nevertheless, Foreign Exchange Intervention (FXI) has remained a widely used policy instrument. Of those central banks, many continue to use FXI to limit excessive volatility or for reserve adequacy purposes, without targeting any specific level of the exchange rate.4 Guatemala is no exception. Banguat’s monetary framework leverages two instruments: the policy rate and FXI. However, it remains an interest rate-based monetary policy regime (a regime where the interest rate is the main lever that the central bank uses to influence aggregate demand and inflation) as opposed to an exchange rate-based monetary policy regime (a regime where the main lever used to stabilize inflation is the exchange rate).",

        "text": "A. A Review of Guatemala’s Foreign Exchange Developments to Date\n\n3. From its creation in 1924 until the mid-1980s, Guatemala’s official currency (the quetzal) was fixed at parity with the U.S. dollars. Despite the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, which prompted many countries to start adopting more exchange rate flexibility, Guatemala chose to continue with a fixed exchange rate regime. However, imbalances started to mount following the oil price shock of the 1970s, the global economic recession of the early 1980s, and political and fiscal instability in the country. International reserves declined rapidly, forcing Banguat to restrict transactions in U.S. dollars while selling foreign currency to some importers and financial institutions at a subsidized value. This led Banguat to accrue operating losses, which eroded its capital base. Eventually, in 1986, the quetzal started to devaluate as the pressure was no longer sustainable."
