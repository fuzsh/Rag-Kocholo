        "text": "Description\n\nThe Quetzal, also known as the shining Quetzal or splendid trogon (Pharomachrus mocinno), is a magnificent bird that lives in the areas of Central America, between Mexico and Guatemala.\n\nSpectacular for its plumage and colors, it is historically also considered a mythical bird, revered as a god by the Maya and Aztecs who used its feathers to decorate their regalia, or to make sculptural or pictorial representations. Quetzalcoatl means, in fact, feathered serpent, perhaps also in reference to the fact that the male, characterized by bright colors, has tails that can even reach 105 centimeters in length.\n\nLuciano Feliciani composed this piece inspired by the beauty and the proud and elegant flight of the Quetzal, but also by the mysterious and divine meaning attributed to it by ancient Mesoamerican civilizations. The composition begins with a majestic and powerful opening that preludes a driving and spasmodic theme in the Allegro. Here, the constant presence of the percussion describes the flight but at the same time the mythological essence of this animal.\n\nSuddenly everything stops, as if the Quetzal had landed and were now pawing among the branches; but then it resumes its flight again. The second part, slow and in a major key, celebrates its beauty and elegance. The initial theme resumes in the final part of the composition, portraying the Quetzal that soars in flight and renews its incessant journey between the land of the humans and the sky of the gods."
