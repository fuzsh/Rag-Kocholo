        "text": "This week Mark Guerrero visits with guitarist and founding member of the band Quetzal, Quetzal Flores. The band has eight albums to their credit. They call themselves an East L.A. Chican@ rock group, whose music is a mix of Mexican and Afro-Cuban rhythms, jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock music. They also incorporate fandango and son jarocho in their music. They’re also known for their social activism and strong feminist stance. They won a Grammy award for their 1993 album, “Imaginaries.”"
