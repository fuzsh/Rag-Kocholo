        "text": "$10 general / FREE for members\n\nJoin Nobuko Miyamoto for a virtual celebration of her new album and memoir! She will be joined in conversation and performance by Quetzal Flores via Zoom.\n\nAbout the book:\n\nNot Yo’ Butterfly: My Long Song of Relocation, Race, Love, and Revolution, a new memoir, is the intimate and unflinching life story of Miyamoto—artist, activist, and mother. Beginning with the harrowing early years of her life as a Japanese American child navigating a fearful west coast during World War II, Miyamoto leads readers into the landscapes that defined the experiences of twentieth-century America and also foregrounds the struggles of people of color who reclaimed their histories, identities, and power through activism and art.\n\nAbout the album:\n\nHer album, 120,000 Stories, is her first release since 1973’s seminal A Grain of Sand: Music for the Struggle by Asians in America. With a title evoking the approximate number of those of Japanese ancestry incarcerated in WWII concentration camps, the album collects new music, recorded with GRAMMY-winner Quetzal Flores, that speaks to issues such as Asian American stereotypes and the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as music from A Grain of Sand, recordings of her late-1970s group Warriors of the Rainbow, and performances from various stage productions throughout the past several decades.\n\nNot Yo’ Butterfly: My Long Song of Relocation, Race, Love, and Revolution and 120,000 Stories (2-CD Set) are both available in the JANM Store.\n\nRegistration is required using the tickets link.\n\nThis program is a presentation of JANM’s National Center for the Preservation of Democracy."
