        "text": "About me\n\nAfter a short conversation with Michelle Habell-Pallán , Quetzal Flores from the Grammy Award-winning East Los Angeles band Quetzal introduces a Pop Con live performance of “La Vuelta/The Turn” from their new Smithsonian Folkways CD “Puentes Sonidos. ”\n\nQuetzal crosses physical and stylistic borders to create an album of songs imbued with inventiveness. Its musicians stand at the center of transnational and transformative son jarocho practice, bridging rural life of Veracruz, Mexico, with contemporary Chicano sensibilities of urban struggle for freedom and self-determination. The strumming of traditional strings and percussive zapateado blend purposefully with Afro-diasporic R&B and batá, drawing from cultural roots to craft echoes of the future. Interweaving original compositions with sonic glimpses of inspirational figures from Veracruz, this recording embodies a collective vision of positive change."
