We know the massive benefits of music education for students, and we’re determined to provide it for as many as possible.\n\nBECOME A MUSIC WILL EDUCATOR\n\nWe help teachers build highly inclusive, student-centered music classes\n\nMany music educators don’t have access to resources or professional development training. We support these teachers by offering free virtual and in-person workshops as well as student curriculum. We also provide a community for teachers to inspire and learn from each other as they strive to positively impact their students.\n\nTOOLS FOR EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS\n\nAccess our modern band music curriculum\n\nEmpowering students is the core of all we do. With our diverse curriculum, students can learn songs by artists they love on instruments they’re playing. They can even record their own music.\n\nHelp us provide\n\ninstruments to students and teachers in need\n\n\"Many of our teachers are finding Music Will invaluable to their learning and planning.\"\n\nLaura Arthur\n\nTeacher & Arts Administrator, Portland, OR\n\n\"It helps me grow as a person on the inside and as if I am learning a new language I never heard of.”\n\nStudent, 6th Grade, Los Angeles, CA\n\n“Your relentless support of teachers and students is what keeps us all going. ”\n\nJill Russell-Benner\n\nTeacher/Arts Administrator, Danbury, CT\n\n\"This program serves as a huge platform for my students to find themselves as musicians. The after school band that was meeting had students in it from very different backgrounds and musical stories as well as musical abilities. But they were unified, quickly becoming a hub of positivity in our building.”\n\nBritni Bryan\n\nTeacher, Grades K-5, Fruita, CO\n\nThe Latest from Music Will\n\nLoading\n\nEducator Spotlights\n\nTeacher Feature: Zanneta Kubajak\n\nStudent Spotlights\n\nWhere Are They Now?
