        "text": "Martha Gonzalez & Tylana Enomoto:\n\nSongs and Activism in the Borderlands\n\nMingei International Museum\n\nFebruary 9, 2024 | 7:30 PM – Doors open 7:15 PM\n\nJoin us for a night of inspiring music, engaging discussion, and cultural exploration as we delve into the world of Grammy award winning musicians Martha Gonzalez and Tylana Enomoto.\n\nMartha Gonzalez\n\nMartha Gonzalez is a Chicana artivista (artist-activist)—a musician, feminist music theorist, and associate professor in the Intercollegiate Department of Chicana/o Latina/o Studies at Scripps College, Claremont. Born and raised in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, Gonzalez has been awarded MacArthur (2022), Fulbright Garcia Robles (2007-2008), Ford (2012-2013), Woodrow Wilson (2016-2017), and United States Artist (2021) fellowships\n\nHer experience as a singer/songwriter and percussionist for the Grammy Award-winning (2013) band Quetzal has fueled her academic interests. She has explored the relevance of Quetzal’s music and lyrics in a range of academic publications, including her book Chican@ Artivistas: Music, Community, and Transborder Tactics in East Los Angeles (University of Texas, 2020). Martha is currently the director of the Scripps Humanities Institute and lives in Los Angeles with her husband, Quetzal Flores, and their 18-year-old son-Sandino.\n\nQuetzal’s latest recording, Puentes Sonoros (Sonic Bridges), was released on Smithsonian Folkways in the fall of 2020. Gonzalez and her partner Quetzal Flores have been instrumental in catalyzing the transnational dialogue between Chicanx/Latinx communities in the US and Jarocho communities in Veracruz, Mexico.\n\nGonzalez has also been active in implementing the collective songwriting method in correctional facilities throughout the U.S. As a testament to the body of musical and community work Gonzalez has accomplished, Gonzalez’s tarima (stomp box) and zapateado dance shoes were acquired by the National Museum of American History. They are on permanent display in the museum’s Many Voices, One Nation exhibit.\n\nFor more information visit marthagonzalez.net\n\nTylana Enomoto\n\nTylana Renga Enomoto became the first Thai-Japanese American to win a Grammy Award in 2013. While playing at a coffee shop, Tylana was discovered by members of the East LA Chican@ rock band Quetzal. In 1997, she officially joined Quetzal as violinist and backup vocalist. In 2012, Quetzal released the album Imaginaries as part of the Smithsonian Folkways Tradition series. The album would win a Grammy Award in 2013 for Best Latin Rock, Urban, or Alternative Album.\n\nTylana is exceptionally well qualified to take us on an exciting journey through the diverse music and culture of Los Angeles. Her artistry has captivated audiences worldwide, and collaborations with revered musicians such as Kamasi Washington, Kendrick Lamar, Ariana Grande, Lupe Fiasco, and Bonobo have cemented her reputation as an accomplished and highly creative musician.\n\nTylana Enomoto’s artistic vision extends beyond music as she utilizes her rich cultural heritage to create immersive artworks that take one on extraordinary multicultural voyages. Combining her musical artistry with her work as an associate clinical social worker, Enomoto is dedicated to supporting survivors of violence, utilizing her platform to create awareness and advocate for change.\n\nTylana Renga Enomoto is one of LA’s most talented musicians and advocates. Prepare to be entranced by the melodies of her violin and the emotional strength she conveys through her music.\n\nThis is the second concert of the series Sound of the Border | Sonido de la Frontera.
