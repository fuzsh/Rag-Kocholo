With powerful lyrics addressing themes of social activism, Quetzal’s creative harmonizations stretch from soulful ballads to exuberant dances, blossoming into a dynamic performance with a social point of view.\n\nBefore the concert, join IJ for Sound Bites, a 15-minute pre-show talk that dives into the themes explored during the 2018-19 season, Origin Stories. On Friday, May 10 at 7 pm, artist, educator, and organizer Yared Portillo will speak about Quetzal's work, arts-based community organizing, and the origins of the son jarocho musical style.\n\nAnd after the concert, join Quetzal and members of the community for a fandango - a vibrant dance and musical celebration.\n\nTickets are discounted by $5 when purchased online!\n\nGeneral Admission: $20 online / $25 in person\n\nUnder 30 and Arts Industry Professionals: $15 online / $20 in person"
