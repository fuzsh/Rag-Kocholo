        "text": "We are Mariachi Quetzal out of DFW, TX. We'd love to make your event special. The award-winning Mariachi Quetzal is an energetic group comprised of musicians from all over the state of Texas! Quetzal has performed at various venues throughout the Dallas/Ft. Worth area including: The Kessler Theater, The Murchison Performing Arts Center and The Meyerson Symphony Center. The group has also shared the stage with artists such as Norah Jones and Mariachi Sol de Mexico de Jose Hernandez. Mariachi Quetzal is available for weddings, corporate parties, anniversary parties, birthday parties, quincineras, sweet 16's and much more! The group offers everything from a small trio to a full mariachi ensemble. Mariachi Quetzal looks forward to playing at your next event! Mariachi Quetzal was formed in the summer of 2008 in Denton, Texas. The original 10 members met while performing in college and other professional mariachis. The ensemble is composed of accomplished vocalists and instrumentalists from various backgrounds, all of whom are students or alumni of the University of North Texas(UNT) College Of Music. Not only has Mariachi Quetzal performed in their native Dallas-Fort Worth area, but they have also played in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas and New York City. Mariachi Quetzal performs annually at the Texas State Fair and has collaborated with Bubba Hernandez and the Grammy Award-winning band Brave Combo. Quetzal is committed to mentoring young mariachi musicians; group members have served as clinicians to many public school mariachi programs in North Texas and also teach at UNT's annual summer mariachi camp. Mariachi Quetzal strives to bring new life and interest to the rich tradition that is mariachi music."
