        "text": "FELIX CONTRERAS, HOST:\n\nOK. That's fine. OK. So here's what we're going to do. Well, you'll see. And I'll see at the same time.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMARTHA GONZALEZ: The experiment.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF QUETZAL SONG, \"PILLOW PEOPLE\")\n\nCONTRERAS: From NPR Music, this is ALT.LATINO. I'm Felix Contreras. In the studio with us today, we have members of the phenomenal group Quetzal that are visiting Washington, D.C., and I couldn't resist an opportunity to bring them in for a guest DJ session. Folks, welcome.\n\nGONZALEZ: Yeah, thank you.\n\nQUETZAL FLORES: Yeah, thanks.\n\nTYLANA ENOMOTO: Thanks, Felix.\n\nGONZALEZ: Thank you, Felix.\n\nCONTRERAS: OK. So why don't you go around the room, introduce yourself so the listeners will get used to your voice and will know who's talking when.\n\nGONZALEZ: OK. Well, my name is Martha Gonzalez. I'm the singer, songwriter and percussionist.\n\nCONTRERAS: OK.\n\nENOMOTO: Hi, I'm Tylana Renga Enomoto. I play violin in the group and some singing.\n\nFLORES: Quetzal Flores. I am the lead vocalist and the only songwriter in the band.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCONTRERAS: We're starting with a track from your great new album. Tell us the name of the track and the name of the album.\n\nGONZALEZ: The name of the album is called \"The Eternal Getdown.\"\n\nCONTRERAS: Love the record title.\n\nGONZALEZ: It's on Smithsonian Folkways' label. And the song you're listening to is called \"Pillow People.\"\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"PILLOW PEOPLE\")\n\nQUETZAL: (Singing) Co and tell and pro-ing - the more they come, build challenge states of law and knowing. What is seen, what it's holding, there is no destroying. And if you've heard this story, you know more pain than glory. Oh, pillow people. Oh, pillow people.\n\nCONTRERAS: So tell us about what the story is that you're telling in the song.\n\nGONZALEZ: Well, it's really in direct response to the kind of demonizing that immigrants have been subjected to. And what we're trying to do is, you know, narrate the trek from start to finish what our immigrants' families have had to endure, especially from Latin America. One of the major parts of the chorus says, and if you've heard this story, you know more pain than glory. So - and that is pushing back on the idea that immigrants are here to take, that they're criminals, that they don't contribute anything to society. They contribute so much to this country and built - this country has been built by immigrants, and we forget that.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"PILLOW PEOPLE\")\n\nQUETZAL: (Singing) And you've heard the story, you know more pain than glory. Oh, pillow people. Oh, pillow people. Oh, pillow people. Oh, pillow people. Yeah. Oh, pillow people. Oh, pillow people. Oh, pillow people. Oh, pillow people. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nCONTRERAS: \"Pillow People\" from Quetzal from their latest album on Smithsonian Folkways Records, \"The Eternal Getdown.\" How long has the band been going, and has a social message always been part of the theory behind the band - the concept?\n\nFLORES: The band started in 1993, so this is our 24th year.\n\nCONTRERAS: Wow.\n\nFLORES: And yes, from the beginning, the idea was to really use this as a vehicle to talk about things, to discuss things. It comes out right out of the uprising in Los Angeles.\n\nCONTRERAS: Right after the Rodney King verdict.\n\nFLORES: That's right. And then growing - I grew up in the movement. And, you know, my parents were involved. And so it was not even a question whether or not when I decided I was going to do music or when music decided it was going to do me...\n\nCONTRERAS: (Laughter).\n\nFLORES: ...That it was always going to have this powerful message attached to it, you know? Because this is - just because I became a musician, I didn't stop being the child of my parents and a product of my environment and who they brought me up to be.\n\nCONTRERAS: When you say the movement, I have to clarify for the people who are not from California, who are not Chicano, you know, that's shorthand for us.\n\nFLORES: Yeah.\n\nGONZALEZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah (laughter).\n\nCONTRERAS: The movement, right? But it is an era of social activity, social engagement that started principally around dignity and work for the United Farm Workers through the union but then social justice issues throughout the community. And there's some people who were just part of the movement and just, you know, that's - when you say the movement, we know what we're talking about, the Chicano movement, the social movement. So that's just to bring everybody else in...\n\nGONZALEZ: (Laughter).\n\nCONTRERAS: ...On the conversation.\n\nFLORES: Thank you, Felix.\n\nCONTRERAS: OK. So the idea was to bring in some music that you are listening to, that influenced you, what do you have?\n\nENOMOTO: Let's see. I brought a piece by Kendrick Lamar off of his new EP called \"Blood.\"\n\nCONTRERAS: So tell me why you chose this track.\n\nENOMOTO: I've just been really fascinated by his work, and I'm just - I'm immersed in what he's doing right now.\n\nCONTRERAS: OK. And then did a little birdie tell me that you're on this track? Huh?\n\nGONZALEZ: Yes. The birdie is sitting over here.\n\nCONTRERAS: (Laughter).\n\nFLORES: Yes (whistles).\n\nGONZALEZ: (Laughter).\n\nCONTRERAS: So you're playing violin on this track?\n\nENOMOTO: I'm playing violin on this track, yes.\n\nCONTRERAS: Oh, congratulations. Awesome. This is Kendrick Lamar, \"Blood\" from his EP, \"DAMN.\"\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BLOOD\")\n\nKENDRICK LAMAR: (Singing) Is it wickedness? Is it weakness? You decide. Are we gonna live or die? So I was takin' a walk the other day, and I seen a woman, a blind woman, pacin' up and down the sidewalk. She seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped something and having a hard time finding it. So after watching her struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? Hello, ma'am. Can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something. I would like to help you find it. She replied, oh, yes, you have lost something. You've lost your life. Is it wickedness?\n\nERIC BOLLING: Uh, Lamar stated his views. Uh, Lamar stated his views. Uh, Lamar stated his views. Uh, Lamar stated his views. Uh, Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song quote, \"And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho.\"\n\nKIMBERLY GUILFOYLE: Oh, please. Ugh. I don't like it.\n\nCONTRERAS: Within that mix of music and sound is Tylana's violin. Tell us a little bit about this circle of young musicians who are revitalizing jazz in a way that has a hip-hop influence, but they're not bowing down to either one. You know, it's like a perfect synthesis. Tell me about what it's like to be around these musicians when you're working and what is a flow of exchange of ideas like.\n\nENOMOTO: For me, it's just very organic. Like, when I first started playing music, I was immersed in this amazing mix of social movement and things, not from only just the Chicano movement, but also from, like, the hip-hop movement. And so that's where I kind of knew all of them from - Terrace Martin and these folks, you know, who were, like, the homies (laughter).\n\nCONTRERAS: Right. Right. Just your guys, right?\n\nENOMOTO: So now it's, like, now we're all kind of doing stuff and, like, that whole group, the West Coast Get Down and...\n\nCONTRERAS: Right.\n\nENOMOTO: ...All them, they're all just, like, coming through and doing these amazing, amazing works. And I feel so proud of them, and I feel so excited to be close to them and get to be somewhere in the mix with them. But they're like a family, a very tight-knit family, because they grew up together from, you know, back in the day. Some of them have known each other since they were little kids, like, three years old and stuff. So it's really amazing, it's very powerful to be around them.\n\nCONTRERAS: OK. So for listeners who are not familiar with them, why don't you just say some of their names so that people can go out and look for their records because they're all - I can't even - I don't even have the words to say how much I admire and respect the music that they're making.\n\nENOMOTO: Let's see. Well, there's Ron Bruner; there's Thundercat, Stephen Bruner, his brother; Miles Mosley; Cameron Graves, the piano player; a dear friend from high school, Tony Austin, is deeply in the mix - drummer, amazing drummer. And they're all multi-talented, doing all kinds of stuff. Producer - Tony Austin, I think, is producing - he has a hand in producing Kamasi's new project that's coming out. They're just - they're beasts all across the board and family to each other. And so it's great to have them all supportive of each other's own individual projects as well as when they come together and perform. It's just amazing.\n\nCONTRERAS: And I'm going to put you on the spot because, you know, you being part of that collective, part of that mix, it's what I tell people my age - right? - late 50s, I'm telling people, you know, you got to listen to these young cats that are doing stuff because not only are - they're making amazing music, but they're ignoring genres, they're ignoring boundaries. And if you really want to know what America looks like - multi-ethnic, mixed marriages, mixed ethnicities, you know, all of this stuff - just listen to that music because everybody - there is no ethnicity. There is no boundary. Everything is all mixed together. And so that's - I'm actually a fanboy now that you're a part...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCONTRERAS: ...Of that scene 'cause I have so much respect for them. So thanks for bringing that track in and letting us know that you're part of that.\n\nENOMOTO: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nCONTRERAS: OK. Who's next? Who's got a record? Quetzal, let's go.\n\nFLORES: Sure. So I'm going to go with The Smiths' \"Cemetry Gates.\"\n\nGONZALEZ: (Laughter).\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CEMETRY GATES\")\n\nTHE SMITHS: (Singing) A dreaded sunny day, so I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side.\n\nCONTRERAS: OK. So why the laughter? What's going on? Why did you guys laugh?\n\nGONZALEZ: I think I know why he chose this.\n\nCONTRERAS: Why?\n\nFLORES: Man, since my son was born, we have, like, this play between us with music. And so there's just, like, certain songs that we understand are our songs, you know? And so every morning that I - when I do take him to school - Martha and I share those duties. But when I do get to take him to school, when he sits - steps in the car, he knows that this song is going to start playing. And he's like, yes, my jam, right? He loves this song. And so, like, for the rest of our lives we'll be able to, like, relate to one another with.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CEMETRY GATES\")\n\nTHE SMITHS: (Singing) You say, ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn, and you claim these words as your own. But I've read well, and I've heard them said a hundred times - maybe less, maybe more. If you must write prose and poems, the words you use should be your own. Don't plagiarize or take on loan 'cause there's always someone, somewhere with a big nose who knows and who trips you up and laughs when you fall, who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall.\n\n(Singing) You say, ere long done do does did, words which could only be your own. And then produce the text from whence was ripped, some dizzy whore, 1804. A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're happy. And I'll meet you at the cemetry gates. Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're wanted. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side, but you lose 'cause weird lover Wilde is on mine. Sure.\n\nCONTRERAS: The Smiths on ALT.LATINO. We play everything here, man.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nFLORES: Well, you know, if you know - especially East LA - if you know Chicanos in East LA, then you know that The Smiths are a part of that social fabric and Morrissey. And so, like, there was this play recently that I saw about Morrissey, and it sort of charted, you know, Chicano - Latinos' affinity with androgynous crooners or, you know, sexually ambiguous crooners. And they talk about Paquita la del Barrio, they talk about Juan Gabriel...\n\nCONTRERAS: Right?\n\nFLORES: ...And they talk about Morrissey. And they're like, of course. And if you go to a Morrissey concert in LA, it is 99% raza and probably like 50% queer. You see homies. You see gang members that are openly queer there, holding hands - men that are holding hands. They're all tatted up and looking hard, but not looking hard...\n\nCONTRERAS: Yeah.\n\nFLORES: ...You know? And so it's a thing, you know? It's a thing in our culture. And so my son knows that story, too. And so we talk about those things and that they're all - these songs are always teaching moments and learning moments for both of us.\n\nCONTRERAS: Let's talk a little bit about that. Now that you mentioned it, we have to talk about the fact that Quetzal and Martha are partners in music and in life. So let's talk a little bit about what kind of challenges that poses in raising a family...\n\nGONZALEZ: Well, I think that...\n\nCONTRERAS: ...Without getting too personal and not bringing up a therapy session.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGONZALEZ: I know right. You know - OK. OK, now that you said that, I'm going to change the subject.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGONZALEZ: No. You know, with my son, first of all...\n\nCONTRERAS: What's his name?\n\nGONZALEZ: His name is Sandino (ph).\n\nCONTRERAS: OK.\n\nGONZALEZ: Jose Maria Sandino González Flores (ph). He has a long name. He's the first grandson born after the death of Quetzal's grandfather. His name was Jose Maria, and so - but we call him Sandino. And Sandino was born into music. I performed till I was about eight or nine months pregnant. And so he was born musical, I think. And we took him with us everywhere. We lived in Veracruz for a while. And up until he was school age, where he really needed a regular schedule and had to start going to preschool and then kindergarten, he was out on tour with us.\n\nSo that wasn't a sacrifice. Babies are happy when they're with their families, and that's it. And so we are his family, and he was with us the whole time. Now he has a support system that's incredible. My mom will stay with him in his - so - and so that he's comfortable in his own bed, para que duerma en su cama, you know? And then his mom is with him now. I get that Grandma Consuela's (ph) with him or Maye (ph) is with him and - or his tía Xochitl (ph) is with him. And so, you know, he has a lot of tías, a lot of grandmas, so, you know.\n\nCONTRERAS: OK. Martha, since we're talking about family and you have the floor, what track did you bring in?\n\nGONZALEZ: OK. So I brought in from the new album by Chicano Batman - it's called \"Freedom Is Free,\" and the name of the song is \"Friendship (Is A Small Boat In A Storm).\"\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"FRIENDSHIP (IS A SMALL BOAT IN A STORM)\")\n\nCHICANO BATMAN: (Singing) You've got an open heart, so you share what's inside thinking that all is said in confidence, but then you realize. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. The sun is getting heavy. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. It's cold, and it's breaking my heart. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. This boat is incredibly unsafe. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. It's falling apart. Now you play your part. You're along for the ride. Thinking that all is said in confidence, yeah, you realize. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. Now I'm swimming in the sea. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. Floundering desperately. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. Tryin' to get a grip on my emotions.\n\nFriendship is a small boat in a storm. I'm falling apart. Happy to know until the clouds start singing. The wind is high and the waves scary. Oh, Lord, only you know I've had enough. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. My mama said don't trust nobody. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. 'Cause they'll stab you in the back and take your money. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. You live, and you learn. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. If you want to live, you better learn so you don't burn. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. Yeah. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. You'd better start swimming, brother. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. 'Cause I'm drowning. I'm sinking brother. Friendship is a small boat in a storm. You live, and you learn... Friendship is a small boat in a storm. ...That friendship is a small boat in a storm.\n\nCONTRERAS: Chicano Batman with the song, \"Friendship (Is A Small Boat In A Storm).\" And when you look at the video, watch the background singers. Those are the young ladies from Mariachi Flor De Toloache out of New York...\n\nFLORES: That's right.\n\nCONTRERAS: ...Doing the background singing.\n\nGONZALEZ: Yep.\n\nENOMOTO: Yeah.\n\nCONTRERAS: OK, who's next? Who's got a song? OK, let's see. How about you, Ty (ph)?\n\nENOMOTO: Her name is Little Simz, and she's this young lady who's, like, a very powerful MC who I've just kind of been, like, studying a little bit or just inspired by. So this is Little Simz off of her 2015 album, \"A Curious Tale Of Trials And Persons.\" I think she's just been innovative - really innovative in her songwriting, and she's just a powerful MC. She's got a lot to say in this track 'cause it speaks about a struggle, but then also, like, kind of uplifting, too - like, you know, we can make it out.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WINGS\")\n\nLITTLE SIMZ: (Rapping) This is my story. Wait, no. This is our story. This is our fate. This is our kingdom. This is our place. This is our freedom, cut off them chains. This is our struggle. This is our pain. This is our love. This is our trust. This is our daughters. This is our sons. Give me back my wings. Oh. Give me back my wings. See, I just want to fly again. Want to try and you fail, try, then try again. Head up in the stars, I promise I'm higher than the right person for the job. You hire then fire them. I be working for the same thing, towards the same goal. Are we losing the passion in which we came for? I was strong but identifying the same flaws, fighting each other but battling for the same cause.\n\nLet me breathe. Ain't got the time to be your enemy. That shit is draining. They're taking up too much energy. I'd rather invest in something that's worth it. The time is precious, so for Simz to waste it is something that you'll never see. Hold me to it. Everything is just a memory. It's getting modest then and never modest then, then I remember I am not fucking about. Getting modest is an error. I'll be fine as long as I've got my head up. Breathe. I ain't prayed in a minute. Before you judge me, hold that thought and let me finish. For a long time I thought that praying was just asking for things like the road to riches and diamond rings. But now I know that I just got to be thankful. Blessings every day - shit, I've got my hands full. Lessons every day. I'm learning for more angles.\n\nMum, stop stressing over shit that I'ma handle. Don't you know? Simbi got you. I ain't even gotta say it. The album's here. I hope you love it, hope you play it. I know you knew this day would come. I know you prayed it. Can't wait to look at you and tell you that I made it. See, it's amazing. Good things come to the people that wait, and I waited. Tell me, do you believe the quote above I stated? Nobody handed me a dream. I had to chase it. I had to be business-minded and put aside my feelings. I had to find my own truth, my own meanings. Wrote this in the same bedroom I started in, had to dream big, had to look beyond my ceiling. Do you feel it? Hand on my heart, if only you could feel the way it's beating. I mean it. This is the type of music that ain't never going to sell?\n\nWell, shouldn't never ever tell me that. Should've never ever ever told me that. What if I prove you wrong? Tell me now, could you live with that? No, you wouldn't wanna live with that. I ain't saying this'll go to No. 1. Oh, I ain't saying that. I know you know that I ain't saying that. I just wanna do this all for my people, f*** the rest. Give you realness every time, nothing more, nothing less. And it goes like, no time for these low-lives. I'm onto something bigger, all thanks to the most high. Becoming more relentless and less defensive, it's in my mechanism. Who give a f*** about cosigns? Never scared of killing them, something that's too real. They don't have to play this, I know that Huw will, and you will. No, you can't ignore it. Many of us want this life but just ain't cut out for it, yeah.\n\nSo don't you ever forget who told you this. No, don't you ever. See, this is for your kids. Yeah, don't you ever overlook this here. So this is our message. This is our faith. This is our voice. This is our names. This is our new. Now we want change. This is our sun. This is our rain. This is our wind. This is our fail. This is our hands. How can we help? This is our heaven. This is our hell. This is our story. This is our tale. Our tale.\n\nCONTRERAS: Little Simz and the track \"Wings.\" Nice call. Good one.\n\nENOMOTO: It's just is what I've been listening to. You guys put me on the spot. I'm on the way over here going, what are we doing again? Oh, yeah. You need to bring what are you listening to. And I'm like, OK, well, these two tracks are it. That's it.\n\nCONTRERAS: (Laughter) Well, you know, sometimes that's the way it works, right? You just got to kind of improvise. But we're glad you're here...\n\nENOMOTO: Thank you.\n\nCONTRERAS: ...Right?\n\nENOMOTO: It's an honor to be here.\n\nGONZALEZ: We're glad she said yes.\n\nCONTRERAS: (Laughter).\n\nENOMOTO: They catch me in the morning when I'm groggy and I don't know better, you know? Like, OK, we're going to go to this thing. Here's some coffee. Let's go have some coffee.\n\nCONTRERAS: Yes. We'll feed you. We'll put some coffee in you...\n\nENOMOTO: Exactly.\n\nCONTRERAS: And you're like, what am I doing? Who's this guy? What are we doing? Look at this building. Wow (laughter).\n\nENOMOTO: Exactly.\n\nCONTRERAS: All right. We're in the studio with Quetzal - three members of Quetzal - who are in Washington, D.C., this week to attend the closing ceremonies of the poet laureate of the United States, who is the first Latino poet laureate of the United States. It's a position that is sponsored by the Library of Congress. And that is Juan Felipe Herrera who, by way of full disclosure, I have to say, is an old friend of mine from back in the day, back in the '80s from Fresno. And we talked to him here on ALT.LATINO when he was named the poet laureate of California about four years ago and before he had this national post. OK. So let's move on to our next track. Quetzal, it's your turn.\n\nFLORES: I got Georgia Anne Muldrow, \"Roses.\"\n\nCONTRERAS: So - OK, so before we play it, tell us about the artist and tell us why you chose this song.\n\nFLORES: Man, this last summer we did a bunch of concerts at the Ford Amphitheater.\n\nCONTRERAS: In Los Angeles.\n\nFLORES: In Los Angeles. The Johnson Ford Amphitheater in Los Angeles. And one of those concerts was called Artivista and it was about women artivists. And so we had Medusa, who's like the godmother of West Coast hip-hop. We had Alice Bag, who's like the godmother of West Coast punk rock. We had Marta. We had La Marisoul...\n\nCONTRERAS: From La Santa Cecilia.\n\nFLORES: ...From La Santa Cecilia. We had all these incredible women on the stage at once. And one of those women was Georgia Anne Muldrow. And I was part of the backing band, and there were so many moments that were just so powerful. But when she came up and did her thing, like, I froze. Like, I had to stop and watch 'cause I didn't want to play anymore. I wanted to just - I wanted to be in the audience and listen and watch, you know? So she's so powerful, this young woman. She's gifted and she's a great songwriter and she's quirky as hell. And she's just, like, a delight to be around and just, like, a monster musician, composer and producer.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ROSES\")\n\nGEORGIA ANNE MULDROW: (Singing) When I'm down, I just draw some roses on a pretty piece of paper with my red Stabilo pencil. Halfway through, I feel so much better. I imagine happiness, and it runs right to me, such amazing beauty. You don't have to cut up no roses. Please just leave them living. Got my pencil, got pretty paper. Please don't worry. We're forgiven. I have found just the perfect feelin'g. Smiling 'cause I'm grateful. I can feel your spirit, and it's pulse through all things. Ain't it grand just to be reminded, reminded of the good things? And living in a new day that no one can tear down. You don't have to cut up no roses. Please just leave them living.\n\nGot my pencil, got pretty paper. Please don't worry, we're forgiven. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Feeling good, feeling good, feeling good, feeling good, feeling good, feeling good, feeling good. Got my pencil, got pretty paper. Please don't worry, we're forgiven. You don't have to cut up no roses, please just leave them living. When I'm down, I just draw some roses on a pretty piece of paper with my Stabilo pencil. Almost through, I feel so much better. I imagined happiness, and it ran right to me, such amazing beauty. Got my pencil, got pretty paper. Please don't worry, we're forgiven. You don't have to cut up no roses, pleases just leave them living.\n\nCONTRERAS: Georgia Anne Muldrow with the track \"Roses.\" Thank you for turning us on to this artist. It's not something that maybe we would know about unless somebody else told us about it.\n\nFLORES: Yes. And she's in Vegas. She's living in Vegas. But she comes to LA often and, you know, one of our other collaborators, Quincy McCrary, who's, in his own right, an incredible musician, and he's on \"The Eternal Getdown\" as well, he's worked with her a bunch and Aloe Blacc has worked with her and Maya Jupiter has worked with her. And so this is our connection to Georgia Anne.\n\nCONTRERAS: OK. So you just mentioned something that reminded me that I forgot to ask you about - the album title.\n\nFLORES: In the song \"Critical Time,\" there's a lyric that says...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CRITICAL TIME (TIEMPO CRÍTICO)\")\n\nFLORES: ...Beyond the picket and the boycott and the trend that will soon be abated...\n\nGONZALEZ: (Singing) Will soon be abated.\n\nFLORES: ...All of these deaths are interrelated.\n\nGONZALEZ: (Singing) Interrelated.\n\nFLORES: Ferguson, Emmit, Guerrero and Brown. How do we initiate our people into the eternal getdown?\n\nGONZALEZ: (Singing) Getdown.\n\nFLORES: And when you think about getting down, you know, for us, for raza and for Black people, getting down is an affirmation. It's a - it's uplifting. It's something that we understand is, you know, being down. Getting down. Are you down? (Laughter).\n\nCONTRERAS: Right, right, right.\n\nFLORES: And so - and in the English language, down is usually, like, this, like, depressive, this sort of like, you know...\n\nCONTRERAS: Negative connotation.\n\nFLORES: Yeah. And so - but this is how we roll. We roll with these things in this way. And so \"The Eternal Getdown\" is an inquiry into the possibility of resourcing our communities and those traditional systems that exist within our communities that are regenerative and that allow us to sustain movement. And because we're musicians, we've been, you know, closer to a lot of these things and able to borrow from these ways to create these spaces - these horizontal spaces.\n\nCONTRERAS: Can always count on you guys for a lot of deeper meaning...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCONTRERAS: ...Than just the casual phrase.\n\nFLORES: Sorry.\n\nCONTRERAS: The name of the track again, what is it?\n\nFLORES: \"Critical Time.\"\n\nCONTRERAS: \"Critical Times\" (ph) from Quetzal. We were just listening to the music of Quetzal, and three of the members of the band are in the studio with me today for our guest deejay. And I think we're down to our last track. Everybody's played two. OK. Martha, what do you have left?\n\nGONZALEZ: All right. So I recently was on a panel with this woman and I started actually really listening to her because I knew I was going to meet her. And (laughter) this track is called \"El Kofeyye Arabeyye\" and it's by Shadia Mansour, and she's a rapping with M-1 from Dead Prez.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"EL KOFEYYE ARABEYYE\")\n\nSHADIA MANSOUR: (Rapping in Arabic).\n\nGONZALEZ: You know, my son, as I was listening to her in our car, my son was immediately, mommy, que es eso? What is that? And I said, oh, it's Shadia Mansour. I'm going to meet her today. And, you know, this is her music.\n\nCONTRERAS: And she's from where?\n\nGONZALEZ: She's from London, but she's of Palestinian descent. And so a kofeyye is a scarf - right? - the religious scarf in Palestine. And she's talking about cultural appropriation - right? - and how she's asserting the - how el kofeyye - the scarf - is - it's Arab. My son was immediately drawn to the language. And even though we both don't understand what she was saying exactly, she was - he was very moved by her lyricism, her like, her energy, her, you know, her - the tone in her voice.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"EL KOFEYYE ARABEYYE\")\n\nMANSOUR: (Rapping in Arabic).\n\nCONTRERAS: Thank you all so much for bringing in the songs that you brought in. Every musician has their own musical tastes and their own backgrounds and their own styles that they really listen to when they're at home. All these disparate elements come together, and they come together, and they create one sound. And that's what Quetzal has been doing for, like you said, almost 25 years now. And thanks again to the three members of Quetzal who joined us today.\n\nFLORES: Quetzal Flores.\n\nENOMOTO: Tylana Renga Enomoto.\n\nGONZALEZ: Martha Gonzalez.\n\nCONTRERAS: Thank you all for coming into the studio.\n\nFLORES: Thank you...\n\nENOMOTO: Thank you so much.\n\nFLORES: ...So much, Felix. You're amazing. And...\n\nCONTRERAS: (Laughter) Aw.\n\nFLORES: ...We're always rooting for you over here.\n\nCONTRERAS: (Laughter) Thanks, man. Thanks.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCONTRERAS: We want to remind our listeners that you can hear all the songs we played today on our website. There's some amazing videos that go with this music, so please check it out. We're at npr.org/altlatino. And also reach out to us on Facebook and Twitter.
