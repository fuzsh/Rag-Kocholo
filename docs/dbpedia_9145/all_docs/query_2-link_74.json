        "text": "How to get to Guatemala & other Travel Advice\n\nThe majority of people travel to Guatemala by plane. They arrive in Guatemala City, the capital but there are also flights from Cancun and Belize City to Flores airport near Tikal.\n\nThere are no direct flights between the UK and Guatemala. Most itineraries go through the US cities of Atlanta, Houston, New York or New York. You can also fly via Madrid with Iberia, with KLM via Amsterdam and Panama or through Mexico with several airlines, and then to Guatemala with a Mexican carrier.\n\nIf flying from the USA the majority of flights to Guatemala go through one or two US cities: Atlanta (or Chicago), Dallas (or Fort Lauderdale), Houston and Miami, as well as Los Angeles. There are also many non-direct routes via San Salvador (with Taca), Mexico City (Aeromexico, Interjet). Prices can vary widely depending on the season or promotional fares.\n\nWhat is the Voltage in Guatemala?\n\nThe standard voltage in Guatemala is 120 V, and the frequency is 60 HZ. Your electric appliances can be used in Guatemala if your country's standard voltage is between 110 and 127 V (as it is in the USA, Canada, and most South American countries).\n\nA voltage converter in Guatemala is required if your country's standard voltage is between 220 and 240 V (as in the UK, Europe Asia, Africa, Australia, and Asia). A combined power plug adapter/voltage convert is also an option.\n\nIt is best to not use appliances if the frequency in Guatemala (60Hz) is different from your country's. If there is no voltage difference you can use the appliance for a brief time. You can verify this by looking at the label. Some appliances don't require a converter. The appliance can be used anywhere in the world if the label says 'INPUT : 100-240V 50/60Hz'. This is common with chargers for tablets/laptops and photo cameras, as well as toothbrushes and cell phones.\n\nWhat Plugs & Sockets are used in Guatemala?\n\nThere are two types of plugs that can be used in Guatemala: type A and type B. Type A has two flat parallel pins, while type B also has two flat parallel pins as well as a third grounding pin.\n\nPlug Types in Guatemala\n\nWhat is the Capital City of Guatemala?\n\nGuatemala City, also known as Guate or Guatemala locally, is the capital of Guatemala. It is also the largest and most populous city in Central America. It is situated in the country's south-central region, in a valley called Valle de la Ermita.\n\nWhat Time Zone is Guatemala in?\n\nGuatemala is GMT -6 hours.\n\nAre Visas Required for Guatemala?\n\nUK and U.S. citizens do not need a visa and are admitted to Guatemala for stays up to 90 days. You may be asked to provide proof of onward or return travel, details of your accommodation and proof that you have sufficient funds to cover your stay. Your passport needs to be valid for at least the duration of your stay.\n\nWhat Currency is used in Guatemala?\n\nThe official currency unit in Guatemala, named after the national bird, is the Quetzal. The Guatemalan Quetzal is divided into 100 centavos. The exchange rate between the Guatemala Quetzal and the U.S. Dollar is remarkably stable at 8 to 1. This means that two Quetzals equal one quarter of an American dollar.\n\nThere are 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 50 centavos coins in Guatemala. A 1 Quetzal coin is also available. A 50 centavos bill is included in the country's paper currency, along with bills for 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 Quetzals. Although U.S. dollars can be accepted in Guatemala, it is a good idea to keep smaller Quetzal bills handy.\n\nCan I use US Dollars in Guatemala?\n\nIn Guatemala's capital, as well as in most tourist destinations like Antigua, near Lake Atitlan and near Tikal, the U.S. Dollar is widely accepted. You should always carry local currency, particularly in smaller denominations, to visit rural areas, food markets and government-operated tourist sites. You will find that most vendors accept Quetzals for any transaction priced in dollars. Quetzal bills can be used in U.S. dollar wallets.\n\nHow can I get or exchange money in Guatemala?\n\nMany people complain about Guatemala's unreliable ATM. The best results are found at international hotels or banks. You can choose between Quetzals or U.S. Dollars with some newer ATMs. You might find yourself with large bills if you withdraw Quetzals from an ATM. However, this will generally result in the highest exchange rate. You should also keep in mind that ATMs often have a transaction limit and that you might be charged by both your bank or the issuing bank if you use an ATM in a foreign country.\n\nYou can also exchange money at banks throughout Guatemala if you bring U.S. currency into the country. Banks and vendors may reject bills that have tears or other marks of wear. It is best to spend all of your Quetzals before leaving Guatemala, as it can be costly and difficult to exchange them for your home currency.\n\nAre Cards or Cash Best to use in Guatemala?\n\nCash is still king in Guatemala, especially away from tourist areas. However, Visa is the most accepted credit card in Guatemala. MasterCard and American Express are close behind. You should bring at least one credit card as not all establishments will accept it. Credit cards can be used to pay for high-end restaurants, hotels and shops. However, some establishments may charge an additional fee for credit cards.\n\nDo I need Vaccinations to Visit Guatemala?\n\nSome vaccines are required or recommended for Guatemala. The WHO and the National Travel Health Network and Centre recommend that Guatemala receive COVID-19, Hepatitis A and/or B and Tetanus.\n\nTravellers aged one year and over who are traveling from countries at risk of yellow flu transmission or have transited for more than 12 hours through an airport in a country at risk of yellow fever transmission will need a yellow fever vaccination certificate.\n\nAll areas below 1500m are at low risk of malaria throughout the year, including Antigua city, Guatemala City, and Lake Atitlan. Most cases are found in Escuintla or Alta Verapaz. It is important to take precautions against malaria. Cover up with long sleeves and long pants, especially after sunset, to avoid mosquito bites. Use insect repellents on any exposed skin. If necessary, sleep under a mosquito net."
