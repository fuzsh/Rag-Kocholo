        "text": "Long regarded as a rare and elusive specialty of the Mexican mountains, this big trogon stunned birders by appearing north of the border in 1977, with a family group in Arizona's Chiricahua Mountains. Since then it has occurred several more times in Arizona, in at least four ranges, and has been found nesting. Only a distant relative of the Elegant Trogon, this species is more closely related to the quetzals of the deep tropics.\n\nAll bird guide text and rangemaps adapted from Lives of North American Birds by Kenn Kaufman© 1996, used by permission of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company. All rights reserved.\n\nMigration & Range Maps\n\nProbably no regular migration anywhere in its range.

Larger than Elegant Trogon. Lacks white chest band, has darker bill. Male is deep green on head, female grayer. Tail bluish above, solid gray and white below (without barring).\n\nSize\n\nAbout the size of a Crow\n\nWing Shape\n\nBroad, Fingered, Rounded\n\nTail Shape\n\nLong, Rounded, Square-tipped, Wedge-shaped\n\nSongs and Calls\n\nSong a series of tremulous whistles, increasing in volume. Calls include a squeaky, tenuous, rising weee or suwee, usually closing with a sharp KT!; a high, quavering Blue Jay–like kee-yah, repeated in rapid series on one pitch; and a harsh, rattling, descending krr-krr-krr.\n\nCall Pattern\n\nFalling, Flat, Rising, Simple\n\nCall Type\n\nRaucous, Scream, Whistle\n\nHabitat\n\nPine forests in mountains. In Arizona, has been found in several canyons, all with pine-oak forest and with other conifers such as Douglas-fir. In Mexico, occurs mostly at elevations of 6,000-10,000' in the mountains, in coniferous and pine-oak forest, often near sheer rocky cliffs."
