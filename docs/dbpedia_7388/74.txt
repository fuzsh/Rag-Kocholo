We had the pleasure of having Pavlos Kontides coming to Monaco at our EGM annual meeting on September 25th. Pavlos Kontides is a Cypriot sailor, born in Limassol, CY.

He became the first Cypriot athlete ever to win an Olympic medal for his country, by winning the silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the Men’s Laser class.

Kontides also competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics obtaining 13th place.

In the same year, he won Gold at the World Junior Championships and in 2009 he won two Silver Medals in World Cups and a Bronze in the Paneuropean Men’s Championship.

He competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Men’s Laser class where he placed 7th. He was the flag bearer for Cyprus during the Parade of Nations.

The Republic of Cyprus honored Kontides through the issue of a Commemorative Stamp.

In September 2017, he was crowned Laser Class World Champion in Split, Croatia! Pavlos Kontides shared his incredible life experience during the meeting illustrating the need to overcome fears and living our dreams.
