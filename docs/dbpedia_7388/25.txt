The Cyprus Post is honouring Pavlos Kontides - the young Cypriot athlete who was won the silver medal in the Laser sailing category at the London 2012 Olympic Games - with the issue of a €0,34 cent stamp. In winning Cyprus’ first Olympic medal, Pavlos Kontides has earned his place in the island’s sporting history.

Pavlos Kontides was born in Limassol and started sailing at the age of nine. In 2007, he represented his country in the Beijing Olympics, obtaining the respectable 13th place. In the same year, he won gold at the World Junior Championships and in 2009 he won two silver medals in World Cups and a bronze in the Paneuropean Men’s Championship, with continued success the following year.

Pavlos Kontides, Cyprus’ first Olympic Medallist, is an example to all young Cypriots.
