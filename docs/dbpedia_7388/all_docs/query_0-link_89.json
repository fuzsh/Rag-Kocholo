Southampton engineers bring together science and sports to optimise the performance of British athletes.\n\nResearchers at the Performance Sports Engineering Laboratory (PSEL) and the Wolfson Unit at the University have made a unique contribution to the success of elite sport in the UK, working with the English Institute of Sport (formerly UK Sport) to provide technical support for elite athletes.\n\n“We provide engineering insight and solutions to enable coaches to assess the performance of their athletes and select better techniques and equipment,” says Professor Stephen Turnock, Director of the PSEL . Through this work, the team has achieved an international reputation for applying innovative engineering design and aerodynamics performance sports.\n\nThe University has long history for supporting elite British athletes in both winter and summer sports. Their expertise helped elite swimmers and cyclists from Britain to achieve success at London 2012, and skeleton athletes Amy Williams and Lizzy Yarnold win their gold medals in 2010 and 2014.\n\nRead more about our research in this area in an interview with Professor Stephen Turnock.\n\nEconomic impact\n\nWill Jennings, Professor of Political Science and Public Policy , provides an insight on the economic impact of the Olympic Games on cities .\n\nPressures of elite sport\n\nDr Nick Maguire , Associate Professor in Clinical Psychology , explains how this pressure can build for elite athletes competing at the highest level and what happens when they can’t deal with it.\n\nContributing to elite sport\n\nCutting-edge research from the PSEL has contributed to British success in winning gold medals at the Olympic Games in Beijing, Vancouver and London. Find out more about our contribution .\n\nThe Wolfson Unit\n\nThe Wolfson Unit for Marine Technology and Industrial Aerodynamics provides consultancy and testing to ensure that industries can benefit from our expertise and facilities. The unit is well known for its ship model testing and sailing yacht performance software."
