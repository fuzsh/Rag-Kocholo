        "text": "Cyprus star Pavlos Kontides has climbed to third place in sailing’s Men’s Laser class (ILCA 7) on the discipline’s third day, just two points behind the sailor in second.\n\nFour more races are scheduled for Sunday and Monday in Marseille, with the final set for Tuesday.\n\nThe 34-year-old Kontides is currently on 42 points, after finishing in tenth and fifth place in Saturday’s two races.\n\nAustralian Matt Wearn is currently first with 18 points and Briton Michael Beckett is second with 40 points.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Kontides said he was “satisfied with my position in the ranking, but not so satisfied that I lagged behind in the beginning and had to struggle, to push my body and use the right tactics to finish higher.\n\n“Compared to where I was at the start of the day and the first buoys, in the end it was a good day,” he added.\n\nKontides said there were still four races left, plus the medal race.\n\n“Weather conditions keep changing, so we continue focused till the end,” Kontides added.\n\nKontides won the silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics in the Men’s Laser class, the first Cypriot athlete to win a medal in the Summer Olympics.\n\nHe also won the International Sports Prize World Athlete of the Year award in 2012.\n\nCypriot Marilena Makri meanwhile ranked 35th overall after Saturday’s Women’s Dinghy, finishing 31st in the first race and 26th in the second and third races.\n\nAlso on Saturday, shooter Konstantia Nikolaou ranked ninth in the first day of qualifying in women’s skeet with 71 points.\n\nLeading is Germany’s Nele Wissmer, followed in second place by Britain’s Amber Jo Rutter and USA’s Austen Jewell Smith in third place.\n\nCyprus will be throwing itself into Sunday’s events with track and field athletes Elena Kulichenko, Milan Trajkovic and Olivia Fotopoulou, as well as cyclist Antri Christoforou.\n\nKulichenko is in the final of the women’s high jump and is aiming for a medal.\n\nShe is the first female Cypriot athlete to qualify for a track and field Olympic final.\n\nTrajkovic will be competing in the men’s 110m hurdles and Fotopoulou in the women’s 200m, both hoping to qualify for the semi-finals.\n\nChristoforou will be competing in the women’s cycling road race."
