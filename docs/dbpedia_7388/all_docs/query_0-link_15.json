Slingsby, who led the entire regatta, covered Kontides the entire race and won the gold.\n\nThe small island nation started taking part in the Olympics in the 1980 Moscow Games.\n\nKontides says he feels \"really wonderful\" and suspects the celebrations will begin once he gets home.\n\nHe adds: \"I will really understand what I have done. It's a historic day for Cyprus sport and for myself as well. I guess I wrote my name in Cyprus sport in golden letters.\""
