He couldn’t resist capsizing again a few minutes later, then waved the Australian flag at a big group of supporters watching from Nothe Fort, including his parents.\n\nLater, he planned to down a few rums in the pub that the Aussies have adopted.\n\nKontides took the silver, securing the first-ever Olympic medal for his small island nation.\n\nChina’s Xu Lijia won the women’s Laser Radial gold."
