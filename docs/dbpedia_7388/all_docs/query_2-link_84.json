And the United States women’s basketball team beat Nigeria 88-74.\n\nMedal table | How to follow | U.S. women's basketball\n\nWeightlifting: A 40-year first for USA’s Morris\n\nWell done, Hampton Morris.\n\nHe couldn’t quite sustain his challenge for silver in the men’s 61kg weightlifting, but his bronze is the first weightlifting Olympic medal claimed by an American man since 1984 — when Guy Carlton took bronze in the men’s heavyweight division.\n\nGreat work, Hampton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkateboarding: USA's Schaar back into second\n\nAmerican Tom Schaar also completes a wildly good second run, one which earns him a score of 92.23 out of 100, and sees him overtake compatriot Tate Carew into second place and the silver medal position in the men's park skateboarding final.\n\nSchaar, seventh in the running order of eight, is followed by Keegan Palmer of Australia, who falls off his board midway through his second run, but is still top with 93.11 and in the gold medal position.\n\nEach of the eight men has one more attempt left, each. Can anyone make themselves a hero?\n\nSkateboarding: USA's Tate Carew goes second with 91.17!\n\nAmerican Tate Carew just completed his second run in the men's park skateboarding final after just an 18.06 first up following an incomplete run.\n\nSporting a loose cream-coloured shirt, he smashes it, a full run, and he holds up his board to the fans, with his parents beaming proudly on the sidelines. Snoop Dogg and Tony Hawk, two legends of the game, were loving it!\n\nIt's a 91.17!\n\nHe has gone into silver medal position, above compatriot Thomas Schaar and only behind Keegan Palmer in the leaderboard!\n\n\"Oh my God, dude,\" he says to himself when the score is announced.\n\nMeet the fastest man in the world! No, not that one...\n\nThe morning after American sprinter Noah Lyles was anointed the fastest man on earth, an 18-year-old chess aficionado who still lives at home with his parents stopped Lyles in the Olympic village, with a bit of a reality check for the gold medalist:\n\n“Unfortunately,” Sam Watson told Lyles, “I am the fastest man in the world.” Imagine Lyles’ initial surprise given this particularly bold moment, and then imagine his utter shock to learn that Watson wasn’t necessarily lying.\n\nBecause Lyles can certainly stake claim to being the fastest man on earth (horizontally), but Watson can say the same about himself (vertically). The Olympics isn’t a place that lends itself to sharing glory, but this is a case of exactly that — the fastest man in the world and the other fastest man in the world.\n\nYesterday, Watson wasted no time in breaking the world record — the third time he had done so in three months. In front of a packed crowd in sweltering heat, he scaled the equivalent of a five-story building in 4.75 seconds — a real-life Spiderman. Read more below.\n\nGO FURTHER\n\nMeet the fastest man in the world: No, not Noah Lyles — speed climber Sam Watson\n\nSkateboarding: Olympic final under way\n\nAt the men's park skateboarding final at the Place de la Concorde, and four guys in out of eight, there have been no clean runs yet.\n\nFortunately everyone gets three tries.\n\nThe best score wins.\n\nTeam USA's Tom Schaar recorded the first clean score of 90.11, with Australian Keegan Palmer top with 93.11 after the full first round. Only two completed runs though.\n\nInto the second round.\n\nWeightlifting: USA’s Morris wins bronze, China’s Li takes gold!\n\nA thrilling contest in the men’s 61kg has come to an end and Hampton Morris has won a long-awaited Olympic weightlifting bronze for the United States.\n\nAfter a 126kg snatch, he was forced to attempt a world-record 178kg clean and jerk, but couldn’t quite pull it off.\n\nHis combined total of 298kg was enough for third place and the bronze medal.\n\nThat meant Thailand’s Theerapong Silachai (303kg) took silver while it was another gold for China who had Li Fabin to thank for a mammoth 310kg total, including an Olympic record of 143kg in the snatch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVolleyball: USA respond to take semis initiative\n\nAs for the indoor variety, the U.S. have recovered well from narrowly losing the opening set (25-23) of their semifinal against Poland.\n\nThe United States responded by taking the second 27-25, and has just smashed the Poles in the third, 25-14.\n\nThat puts the U.S. one set from a return to the Olympic final — a title they last won at Beijing in 2008.\n\nBeach volleyball: Canada up and running in quarters\n\nWe’ve got a volleyball double-header on right now.\n\nOn the sandy stuff under the Eiffel Tower, the Canadian duo of Melissa Humana-Paredes and Brandie Wilkerson have taken their first set against Spain’s Daniela Alvarez and Tania Moreno, 21-18 in their beach volleyball quarterfinal.\n\nThey move to within one set of the semis.\n\nSadly, the U.S. involvement in the women’s competition ended last night with defeat against Switzerland, who will await the winners of this one in the last four.\n\nBasketball: Belgium into women's semifinal after beating Spain\n\nThe Spanish deserve a lot of credit for their wonderful sportsmanship earlier in the match but it is Belgium who go through to the semifinal after a 79-66 victory.\n\nSpain took it to within 11 points in the last quarter but ultimately the Belgians were just a bit too good for their opponents, and now reach the Olympic semifinals in just their second appearance at the Games.\n\nJulie Vanloo, who nailed a clutch 3 amid her 13 points and seven assists, said:\n\n💬 “It’s been a difficult week for us. After starting so badly, I think everyone counted us out. But against all odds we’ve fought back, and it’s amazing (to progress).”\n\nThey join Australia in the semis, who will play the winner from the last quarterfinal. Here is what remains today:\n\nGermany vs France at 6pm local time, 12pm/midday ET, 9am PT, 5pm BST\n\nUnited States vs Nigeria at 8.30pm local time, 2.30pm ET, 11.30am PT, 7.30pm BST\n\nDiving: Bacon and Gibson out in the 3m springboard prelims\n\nThere will be no U.S. divers in the women’s 3m springboard semifinals.\n\nAlison Gibson was unable to recover from her first-round mistake and finished in last place. Sarah Bacon fared slightly better but finished agonisingly outside of the qualifying positions — only the top 18 divers progress to the semifinals, with Bacon finishing 19th.\n\nChina’s pursuit of a clean sweep in the diving pool continues as Chen Yiwen qualified in first place, almost 20 points clear of Australia’s Maddison Keeney in second.\n\nSailing: Matt Wearn retains his Olympic title\n\nIn the men's dinghy medal race Australian Matt Wearn, pictured, has retained his Olympic title from Tokyo, becoming the first man to secure successive gold medals in the Laser (ILCA7) class.\n\nCyprus’ Pavlos Kontides, a silver medallist at London 2012, takes another silver here, with Peruvian Stefano Peschiera edging out Hungary's Jonatan Vadnai to bronze.\n\nThat is Peru’s first Olympic medal in any sport since 1992, and just the second Cypriot medal in history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWater polo: Serbia await if USA makes semis\n\nThe team events are producing some stunning finishes at Paris 2024 today.\n\nAfter the drama of the men’s handball, it’s the turn of the water polo where Serbia has pinched victory in its quarterfinal with Greece, 12-11.\n\nGreece thought they had earned a penalty shootout with an equalizer leaving just six seconds to play, through Angelos Vlachopoulos.\n\nBut Serbia was having none of that, and Nikola Jaksic pinged in a stunner from 6m, in off the underside of the bar.\n\nAnd with that, Greek hearts were broken and Serbia make Friday’s semifinals where they will face either the United States or Australia, who clash in the pool in the coming hours.\n\nEarlier today, Croatia beat Spain 10-8 and will face either Italy or Hungary, who play out the last quarterfinal tie this evening.\n\nVolleyball: Fans are missing U.S. action\n\nThe real question is after the first set, why is Peacock choosing to run so many commercials during game action?\n\nFans are missing out.\n\nVolleyball: U.S. men lose first set against Poland in semifinal\n\nNot the start the USA will have wanted to their men’s volleyball semifinal against Poland.\n\nA super tight first set between the two sides was edged 25-23 by the Europeans and they are a set away from the gold medal match.\n\nThe U.S. has plenty of time to react, but will want to avoid going two sets behind.\n\nWhat to watch: Lyles and the men’s 200m semis\n\nTime: 2:02pm ET, 8:02pm in Paris\n\nTV: NBC, Peacock\n\nThe recently anointed fastest man in the world, Noah Lyles, will be joined in the 200m semifinals by sprinters like defending champion Andre de Grasse (Canada), Erriyon Knighton (USA), Kenny Bednarek (USA) and Letsile Tebogo (Botswana).\n\nLegendary sprinter Usain Bolt won this race across three consecutive Olympics, prior to De Grasse.\n\nLyles is looking to be the first American man to win gold in the 100m and 200m since Carl Lewis in 1984. Lyles won the 100m on Sunday, over Bednarek and Tebogo, and will look to build on his success tonight.\n\nThe 200m final is tomorrow.\n\nGO FURTHER\n\nWhat to watch at Olympics today: U.S. women’s hoops enters knockout round and a busy track schedule\n\nHockey: Netherlands into women’s final again\n\nIn the women’s hockey semifinal Netherlands, who beat Britain 3-1 in the quarters, have beaten Argentina 3-0 to reach the final.\n\nLuna Noa Fokke, Laura Nunnink and Yibbi Jansen scored the goals as the Dutch beat the team they also got the better of in the final at the Tokyo Games, where they won 3-1.\n\nNetherlands will now play either Belgium or China for the gold medal, those two teams clashing in the second semi at 7pm local time, 1pm ET, 10am PT, 6pm BST.\n\nThe final is on Friday at 8pm local time, 7pm BST, 2pm ET, 11am PT.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiving: Gibson receives zero score after mistake in 3m springboard prelims\n\nA busy day in the diving pool continues.\n\nWe saw the men’s 3m springboard prelims earlier and now it is time for the women to take to the board.\n\nThere is U.S. interest in this one as Sarah Bacon and Alison Gibson are bidding for a place in the semifinal — 18 of the 28 divers will qualify for the semifinal.\n\nGibson’s hopes are hanging by a thread after two dives though, as she caught the board with her feet on her way into the pool and entered on her knees.\n\nOuch.\n\nBasketball: Belgium’s creditable show of sportsmanship\n\nIn the women’s basketball quarterfinal, Belgium’s Becky Massey was called for a travel in the third quarter when she tried to call for a timeout mid-play after rolling her ankle.\n\nSpain inbounded the ball, then placed it straight out of bound to return the possession back to Belgium.\n\nA noble decision when losing by 18 points in the quarterfinals of the Olympics.\n\nThe Belgian players, and the crowd, applaud in unison at that show of sportsmanship.\n\nHandball: Germany break French hearts\n\nWhat a brilliant sport and an incredible end in the men’s handball quarterfinal at Pierre Mauroy Stadium in Lille.\n\nGermany was six goals down at one point in regulation, before that remarkable comeback (and France implosion) in the final six seconds. The drama continued all the way through to the last seconds of overtime too.\n\nWith 10 seconds of overtime left, Nedim Remili found an equalizer for the host and defending champion — who had just been restored to parity after a player suspension. But the 22-year-old who drew Germany level in regulation, Renars Uscins, immediately restored its lead with four seconds to play.\n\nThere was still time for a big save from Germany goalkeeper David Spaeth to deny Valentin Porte, and then survive a quick penalty check after the buzzer. But in the end, France lost out as Germany made the final 35-34.\n\nDika Mem will have to live with his error at the end of regulation, while the event ends with a lengthy reception from France handball veteran and legend, 1,300-goal Nikola Karabatic, as he signs off on a stellar career.\n\nLoad more updates"
