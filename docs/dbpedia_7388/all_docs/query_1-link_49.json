        "text": "Welcome to the first in the series of Special Collections blog posts that chart developments at the University through the themes of sporting facilities, the grounds, Rag, and the Hartley Institution’s museum. This week, we focus on the development of the University’s sports facilities.\n\nBefore the 1920s, the University hired pitches from various clubs for cricket, football, and other games. It is recorded in the Hartley University College Athletics Committee minute book and accounts on 3 March 1904, that “On the proposition of Mr Daws seconded by Prof. Chapple the following sub-committee was elected to make enquiries as to the best means of obtaining a field, suitable for the cricket, football, & tennis clubs & make its report to this committee.” [Hartley University College Athletics Committee minute book and accounts, 1903-8, MS1 A4089/1] Circa 1925, the University was gifted a field at Swaythling opposite south Stoneham House by Mrs Montefiore. A generous donation from her husband, Claude Montefiore, enabled the field to be fitted up and a pavilion to be erected. This greatly aided the student social scene. Football, hockey and netball were some of the sports in which the students could partake and these activities are well reflected in our photographic collections. A new assembly hall with a gymnasium and changing rooms was completed by March 1949. The gymnasium was used for badminton, gym, and boxing. In 1950, additional grounds for playing fields were obtained by buying 26 acres at North Stoneham. Many sports clubs were formed in the 1950s, including Golf, Squash, Basketball, Archery and Judo. The Wessex Sailing Club was also admitted by the Athletic Union during the 1952-3 session. Financial support was provided to develop sports facilities during this decade, such as the University Grants Committee providing funding towards a new Sports ground. Connections through a Mr Robertson and Chairman of the Athletic Union at the time, Dr Chapman, also achieved an additional grant for a pavilion. The new Sports Ground would provide a cinder running track and be one of the best laid-out Sports Grounds in the South-West of England according to the 1955-6 annual report. The North Stoneham sports ground began to be used in October 1957, and the new Wellington Field was opened by the University’s first Chancellor, Gerald Wellesley, 7th Duke of Wellington, during the 1958-9 session. During the 1955-56 academic year, a financial policy was designed to place in reserve monetary funds to enable the Student Union to eventually take over the West Building and run it as a Union building. The West Building dated back to the 1940s and was built in red brick style. By the session 1960-1, the Union had expanded into almost the whole of this building, and by 1967, the new Students’ Union building was completed as part of architect Basil Spence’s masterplan, offering indoor sports. The two buildings were connected by an underground tunnel. The sports facilities included provisions for squash, badminton, basketball, fencing, cricket, and tennis practice as well as gymnastics, a billiards room, table tennis room, and a judo room. “With the large and pleasant multi-purpose sports hall, the battery of six squash courts, the judo/exercise room, ands the table tennis area, together with ancillary changing accommodation, the University is fortunate to have some of the best facilities for indoor games in the country. Furthermore, they are ideally situated in the centre of the campus. The sports hall are equipped to house badminton, basketball, fencing, olympic gymnastics, trampolining, table-tennis and volleyball to international standards, as well as being able to cater for archery, cricket, nets, indoor soccer and hockey, tennis, vaulting and agility, netball, and weight training. There are also excellent facilities and equipment for team and personal training and “keep fit” exercise. It is evident that the sports complex is being well used.” [University of Southampton Proceedings 1966-67 Univ. Coll. LF 786.4 ] To promote the indoor sports centre a University Sports Week was hosted during November 1967, of which over 1,700 people attended. The aim of this venture was to promote the indoors sports centre and to provide the opportunity for the public to experience sport played at a high level in the hope that spectators would be encouraged to get involved. Well-known sportsmen and women including international golf, badminton and squash players and gymnasts, were invited to take part in demonstrations and exhibitions. This event helped strengthen links between the University and local sports associations. In line with the recommendations of the Government Sports Council, organisations outside the University were encouraged to use sports facilities during the vacations when they were not needed by students. Coaching courses and competitions in badminton, netball, tennis, trampolining and squash run by local sports associations took place in the indoor facilities. During the 1968-9 session an appeal was launched by the University of Southampton Swimming Society to provide funds for a swimming pool, and a retractable golf practice net was installed in the Sports Hall. Plans were also accepted for the construction of a climbing wall on the outside, south wall of the hall. A first class rifle range was also built at the Boat Hard, Woodmill, with funds provided by the Students’ Union.\n\nIn the 1970s, the provision of a slipway and the development of instructional courses in sailing and canoeing at the Boat Hard helped popularise water-based activities. Rowing and sailing were seen to expand rapidly, and a canoeing club and sub aqua club were also formed.\n\nUnfortunately, the development of an alternative route for the M27 South Coast Motorway in the 1970s led to the demolition of the pavilion, athletics track, and other playing areas at the Wellington Sports Ground, as well as first class pitches at the Wide Lane Playing Fields in Eastleigh. Proposals for the Stoneham Interchange and the Portswood Link also threatened the six tennis courts at the Montefiore Sports Ground and additional pitches at the Wide Lane Ground. To compensate for these losses, the University acquired 34 acres of land at North Stoneham Park, which it proposed to prepare immediately for use as playing fields. Here the University laid artificial playing surfaces for hockey, tennis, and cricket. During the 1974-5 session, the University successfully completed negotiations with Winchester College for the purchase of a second boathouse. Further losses ensued as a result of the development of the Montefiore House halls of residence, this time being the Montefiore Sports Ground during the 1975-6 session. Sporting activities, which previously took place at the Montefiore Sports Ground, were transferred to the newly developed playing fields at North Stoneham Park. During the late 1970s, the indoor sports facilities were unable to satisfy demand, due to the facilities only being appropriate to a university half its size. There was an urgent priority for the provision of a second sports hall, extra squash courts, and a fitness training room.\n\nFirst class facilities for various types of fitness training became available for the first time in the University indoors sports centre in January 1980. Circuit and weight training apparatus as well as a multi-gym were installed in the new area. In the same year, a replacement pavilion at North Stoneham Playing Fields was made available, and the Wellington Sports Ground was opened by Bruce Tulloh, champion runner of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn the 1991-2 session came the University’s new climbing wall. It was the only one of its type in the region at the time, and was available for use by local climbing clubs and individuals. The wall was constructed outside of the Students’ Union and the cost was met jointly by the University, Athletic Union, and Students’ Union. In 1991, the University submitted a planning application for another building on Wide Lane Sports Ground. In 2004 the University unveiled the Jubilee Sports Centre, at a cost of £8.5 million, on the Highfield Campus. Its facilities include a six-lane 25-metre swimming pool, 160 workstation gym and an eight-court sports hall.\n\nWide Lane was refurbished at cost of £4.3 million during the 2005-2006 session and was unveiled by BBC sports presenter and Southampton alumnus, John Inverdale. The 73-acre (30 ha) complex includes flood-lit synthetic turf and grass pitches, tennis courts, a pavilion and a ‘Team Southampton’ Gym. The University also runs facilities at the Avenue Campus, National Oceanography Centre, the Watersports Centre on the River Itchen and at Glen Eyre and Wessex Lane halls.\n\nThe sources that we hold on the history of the development of the University’s sports facilities include committee minute books, and reports, Department of Physical Education statements of accounts and estimates, as well as photographs. We also hold a University College Southampton rugby first XV team rugby jersey, dating around 1930-4. This belonged to an R.E. Brown, who was rugby captain. In our Printed Collections are annual reports, which contain updates provided by the Department of Physical Education, and prospectuses can be useful for seeing photographs of the developments of the facilities.\n\nLook out for our next blog post, which will focus on the history of the University grounds.\n\nAnd so we reach the final Special Collections blog looking at the development of the University over the last 100 years.\n\nAs we moved into the new millennium, there was a change at the helm of the University with the Vice Chancellor, Professor Howard Newby, departing and being replaced by Professor Bill Wakeham. Following the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), which placed Southampton in the top ten of research-led universities in the UK – and which was described by Bill Wakeham as “spectacular by anybody’s standard” – Professor Wakeham produced his “Vision and Strategic Direction for the University of Southampton to 2010” setting out the future organisation and direction for the University.\n\nIn 2002, and again in 2012, the University also looked back to its history, celebrating first its golden and then diamond jubilee of gaining University status in 1952. One of the events in 2002 was to recreate the relay run by members of the Athletics Union from London to Southampton: in 1953 this had been to carry a message of congratulations from the Chancellor of the University of London delivered to the Chancellor of Southampton, the Duke of Wellington.\n\nIndeed, 2012 was to be a double celebration, since it also marked the 150th anniversary of the foundation of the Hartley Institution in 1862. The Hartley Institution, which was based in the High Street, Southampton, was officially opened by the then Prime Minister, third Viscount Palmerston, who travelled from his home in Romsey for the event. Papers of Lord Palmerston form part of the Broadlands Archives, one of key collections of the Special Collections, and for which the University undertook a major fundraising campaign in 2009 to ensure that they remained in the UK.\n\nThe near two decades since 2000 has seen considerable development of the Highfield campus with amongst others the extension of the Hartley Library, opened in November 2004; the re-development and extension of the George Thomas Building housing Professional Services and Student Services; and the Life Sciences building which won an architectural award in 2011. In 2005, a major fire partially destroyed the Mountbatten Building on campus: it successor, also called Mountbatten Building – providing accommodation for the School of Electronics and Computing Science and Optoelectronics Research Centre – was formally opened in 2009. The Highfield campus continues to be developed and reshaped, with the newest building, the aptly named Centenary Building, currently being completed. Developments in sports facilities, both at Highfield campus and elsewhere, will be covered in a successive blog next week.\n\nThe new millennium also saw developments in other ways: 2004 was the year that the first female Esquire Bedell was appointed at the University. Jo Nesbitt of the International Office was the appointee and it was claimed she was the first women to hold this ceremonial post in any university in the UK. The role was created in 1953 for the first University graduation and for, according to the Rag Magazine of the time, a tall male postgraduate “with a great love of ceremonial born in him”.\n\nGraduations in 2004 were the first time that the ceremonies were broadcast live to allow all guests to see the proceedings. Graduations ceremonies now take place a number of times a year to accommodate increasing numbers of graduates and the expansion of University activities not just across several campuses in Southampton and Winchester but overseas. Southampton has a campus in Dalian, China – part of its collaboration with the Dalian Polytechnic University – and the Southampton’s Malaysia campus opened in October 2012 offering degrees in engineering. The Confucius Institute, which promotes Chinese culture and language, also was launched at the University in 2012.\n\nStudent life in the millennium is both very different and in some ways familiar with that in the decades since 1919. Student activism, details of which have been touched upon in previous blogs – such as protests in the 1960s – continued in the recent decades, encompassing such issues as higher education loans and climate change. The opportunities for distraction of social and sporting activities is yet more multiple and varied. The number of clubs and societies supported by the Student Union has risen in the period since 2000 to 300, spanning an array of subjects from Ancient History to Women in Business, numerous performing arts societies and over 80 different sporting activities ranging from court sports to clubs such as windsurfing and sailing. The University also can boast that it has sent a competitor to every summer Olympics since 1988 and in the millennium Southampton has seen success in Olympic sailing events. In Sydney 2000, rowing silver medalist Guinevere Batten competed with her sister Miriam in the women’s quadruple skulls. Subsequent successes include Pavlos Kontides who at the London Olympics, 2012, won Cyprus’s first ever Olympic medal, a silver in the Laser class sailing, and a gold medal for Giles Scott in the Finn heavyweight dingy class at Rio in 2016. As we approach the anniversary of the move to Highfield in autumn 1919, there is change at the helm of the University with the arrival of a new Vice Chancellor, Professor Mark E.Smith, marking another new phase in the institution’s story.\n\nIf these series of blogs have whetted your appetite for more about the development of Highfield over the last 100 years, then do check out Special Collections twitter account and the new series Highfield in 100 objects starting in October.\n\nAfter following intrepid travellers to far-flung places, in the last in our series of travel posts we look at those who stayed closer to home.\n\nThe south coast’s scenery and climate have attracted a range of visitors over the years – especially those in search of a picturesque view, a health cure or even a combination of the two.\n\nTowards the end of the eighteenth century, the Isle of Wight became a magnet for artists keen to record its picturesque scenery, despite the fact that William Gilpin, the main proponent of the picturesque as an aesthetic ideal, found the Island sadly lacking in this this quality.\n\nGilpin wrote that whilst there were elements of the picturesque in the shipwrecks and in the sea-fowl which darkened the air, the Isle of Wight was really “a large garden or rather a field, which in every part has been disfigured by the spade, the coulter and the harrow”, the coastal views being “much less beautiful than we had expected to find them”. Naturally, there was some consternation at this description locally and in the Hampshire Repository’s review of his book in 1799, Gilpin’s views were strongly rebuffed, the reviewer going as far as to retrace his footsteps and provide an alternative opinion on the scenery.\n\nOthers who visited the Isle of Wight were more impressed with what they saw. John Hassell, a London based artist who illustrated his Tour of the Isle of Wight (1790) with aquatints of his drawings (many with unusual colour washes), wrote of Carisbrooke Castle “it affords a fund of delight to the traveller whose mind is susceptible to the transports which picturesque scenes excite”.\n\nA few years later Charles Tomkins recorded both the architecture and the picturesque views of the Island in his Tour to the Isle of Wight (1796), describing how Blackgang Chine “strikes the mind with horror at its dark and sable aspect” .\n\nIn 1784 and again in 1791 the artist and satirist Thomas Rowlandson toured the Island and taking a different approach, made sketches of the various incidents that made up the journey. The sketches were lost for many years, reappearing at the end of the nineteenth century when they were reproduced in an article in The Graphic (Summer 1891), by Joseph Grego, who added his own commentary on the journey.\n\nMany of the Isle of Wight visitors travelled via Southampton, which offered tourists excursions to the gothic ruins of Netley Abbey as well as a mineral spring and sea-water bathing to restore their health. Royal patronage had made Southampton a fashionable resort in the later years of the eighteenth century, the Hampshire Chronicle printing a weekly list of arrivals during the summer season. Southampton’s reputation as a spa waned during the early part of the nineteenth century, as its commercial importance grew, but other resorts developed to cater for the ‘health tourists’ of the day.\n\nFavoured by their sheltered locations and warm temperatures, both Ventnor on the Isle of Wight and Bournemouth (then part of Hampshire) developed as resorts largely thanks to their promotion in prominent publications. In the second edition of The Influence of Climate in the Prevention and Cure of Chronic Diseases (1830), Sir James Clark wrote of his surprise that the Isle of Wight’s Undercliff had been so long overlooked, given its scenery, dry air and a climate which allowed myrtle and geraniums, to flourish even in the colder months. He recommended it as a location superior to any other on the south coast for invalids with pulmonary disease.\n\nSome years later Bournemouth was mentioned very favourably (especially in comparison with Ventnor) in A.B. Granvilles’s The Spas of England and Principal Sea-Bathing Places (1841) “no situation that I have had occasion to examine along the whole southern coast, possesses so many capabilities of being made the first invalid sea-watering place in England”.\n\nBoth resorts developed ‘Sanditon style’ in areas previously sparsely populated. At Ventnor, development was piecemeal, resulting in buildings of varying styles. In A few Remarks about Ventnor… (1877), William Spindler, a German industrial chemist who retired to the Isle of Wight, wrote “We have hotels, churches, shops, cottages and villas in every conceivable style and every outrageous shape” adding that an assembly room, pleasure garden and more planting for shade would be beneficial.\n\nIn contrast, Granville thought Bournemouth safe from speculative ‘ brick and mortar contractors’ as fewer landowners were involved in its development. He saw it as having commodious and well-arranged dwellings amongst the pine trees, suitable for invalids “of that class who happen to be wealthy”, with hotels and boarding houses catering for a superior class of visitor.\n\nVentnor and Bournemouth succeeded in their ambitions to attract wealthy visitors seeking the benefits of a mild climate and sea air, but eventually both resorts had to balance catering for this market with the needs of new tourists holidaying purely for pleasure and amusement.\n\nAs the holidays are behind us and we return to the normal routine, we hope you have enjoyed the travellers’ tales from Special Collections.\n\nHow about taking a trip to Europe for your summer break? But what would your journey have been like in the days before fast cars or budget airlines. Whilst industrialisation and developments in modes of transport – such as trains and steamers – throughout the nineteenth century made travel easier, journeys would have been a very different prospect from our modern experience.\n\nThis week’s blog looks at the accounts of three women between the late eighteenth to the early twentieth century, offering a glimpse of travel in the age of horse-drawn carriages, trains, steamers and early motor cars.\n\nThe first traveller is Mary Mee, Viscountess Palmerston. With her husband and children she travelled to continental Europe on various occasions during the late eighteenth century. Her account relates to the visit they made in 1792, beginning with a description of the Channel crossing on the packet boat from England to Calais and then a drive in horse drawn carriage to Boulogne:\n\n“Sunday the 29th of July. We had a very short passage of three hours which appeared to me like three and thirty…. The children were all a little indisposed but they forgot their past sickness when we landed at Calais. We breakfasted and drest and then set off for the Hotel de Ville where we were to appear in person to have our picture taken, that is to have our persons so accurately described that we could not give our passports to anybody else that they might effect their escape. Nothing, however, could be civiler and they detained us as short a time as possible…. During the examination of our baggage and the refitting of our carriage we took a walk and viewed the Duchess of Kingston’s house… We had a pleasant drive to Bologne where we arrived at the renowned Mrs Knowles, time enough to take a walk on the pier…”\n\n[MS62 Broadlands Archives BR11/18/6]\n\nTravel documentation and checking of luggage was as much part of the eighteenth-century experience as for the modern traveller. The account by Lady Palmerston emphasising the civility of the process provides a marked contrast to accounts of less scrupulous practices for border crossings, as shown in the Rudolph Ackermann illustration above.\n\nThe Paris of Lady Palmerston’s visit was that of the First French Republic created in the aftermath of the revolution.\n\nShe begins with a more typical tourist account praising the architecture and the environment: “I am extremely struck with the magnificent buildings in Paris. The fine hotels and gardens with the number of pathed walks and gardens which make a summer pass’d in Paris as pleasant as the country. The clearness of the air from burning only wood is very singular to any body used to the smoke of London…” But Lady Palmerston’s description of the city goes beyond an admiration for the sites, and in her comments provide an interesting perspective on the social changes taking place:\n\n“The total absence of everything like a person of fashion or a carriage … is very striking… We went and walked afterwards in the Palais Royal which used to be filled with all kinds of elegant people. It was crowded indeed, but with quite a different description. It’s the gayest place possible and you might pass your life in it and never want anything but what you might find there. All kinds of shops, coffee houses, taverns … dancing, gambling, politicks talking all around you and ladies without number.”\n\n[MS 62 Broadlands Archives BR11/18/6]\n\nThe second traveller is Elizabeth Waley (1821-84), the only daughter of Solomon Jacob Waley and his wife Rachael Hort. This account records her journey with her parents across Europe and around the Rhine in 1845, utilising, as well as carriages, the relatively new modes of transport – both trains and steamers.\n\nThe distance of nearly 50 years did not seem to have improved the experience of the initial part of the journey – that of crossing the Channel. The boat was described as having “pitched about tremendously” with the “women wretchedly provided for … with no stewardess nor any one to attend to them.” Border crossings and formalities at these could still be relatively simple and non bureaucratic. Elizabeth Waley records that when travelling by carriage from Koblenz to Bad Ems “not far from Coblenz a ladle at the end of a long pole was handed out of the window of a little house and we paid a trifling toll at crossing the barrier between Prussia and Nassau”. [MS371 A3042/2/4/15]\n\nThe development of the train network in Belgium and in Germany in the 1830s and 1840s meant that train travel from Ostend onwards was relatively straightforward. Crossing the state border though did mean a delay at Verviers to change to Prussian carriages to deal with the differences in the state rail networks.\n\nTheir journey included a day visit to Frankfurt by train from Weisbaden in August: this route being part of the new railway line that had been constructed in 1839. Taking in some of the main sites they visited the Römer (City Hall) and the stock exchange building on the Paulsplatz. This building, which Elizabeth Waley described as “an elegant new building”, was based on the plans of the Frankfurt architect Friedrich Peiper and had opened in 1843. It had a spacious interior and was designed “in beautiful taste, the floor laid with mosaic patterns in coloured stone and an arched roof painted in arabesque supported by marble columns….”. [MS371 A3042/2/4/15]\n\nIn parallel to the development in train networks, the introduction of steam-powered boats to regions such as the Rhine led to the increase in tourism there from the late 1820s. The Waley family in 1845 incorporated the use of steamers in their itinerary and found that these often worked in efficient cooperation with the trains. Elizabeth Waley reported of their return journey in September through Frankfurt that although they were late the Princess Marianne steamer had been “in correspondence with the train and waited for the passengers”. The final account is from the journal of Sybil Henriques who recorded her visit to Venice in 1911. This journey again at least in part embraced new modes of transport, as the party used first the train to Menton and then drove by car to Milan with the intention of then motoring on to Venice.\n\n“9 April: At 1.30 we started for Venice but nearly never got there as our bus (motor) drove slick into a tram. Smashing of glass from the tram and shock to us and a standstill. All leapt out and into a little Victoria and so to station. In train from 1.30 to 6.30 with hot sunshine pouring on to us and the surrounding country past Brescia, Peschiero at the end of Lake Garda and Verona and Padua. Wonderful towns, but ugly plains between…”\n\n[MS371 A3042/2/4/33]\n\nSybil Henriques’s account of her trip to Venice records not only the sights that she visited “10 April: Cold and grey but busy sightseeing. St Mark’s in morning. Marvellous mosaics…. After lunch … set off for the Palace of Doges where we saw the most immense rooms I have ever seen and the most immense pictures in them mostly by Tintoretto….” It also shows the impact that tourism, fueled by transport developments, were having the city even then, as she notes that their beautiful view from the balcony over to San Georgio was “rather spoilt today by a large French steamer”. [MS371 A3042/2/4/33] So modern complaints about too many cruise ships travelling to Venice are nothing new!\n\nWe wish you a happy journey and a very enjoyable holiday by whatever means you are travelling."
