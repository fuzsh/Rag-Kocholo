The Pyrrhic, or weapon dance (a form of mock combat) taken from Crete and perfected in Sparta, was the ideal. Almost every dance has a story to tell. Dancing didn’t always have the form it has now but it was more of rhythmic movements accompanied by lyre and poems reciting. From the early stages of the circle dance, there emerged the orchestra (dancing place), derived from the ancient Greek word for dance, orchesis. It was from this orchestra that the amphitheater developed as a place where people gathered to be entertained. When the element of participation changed to performance, there gradually developed a tradition of tragedy, or tragodia (goat song).
