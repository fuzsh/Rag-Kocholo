        "text": "WCNC Charlotte highlights different nonprofits making a difference in our community that help people in our community get ahead in different aspects of their life.\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. — New Covenant Community Development Center in Monroe was founded in 2009 by former teacher Osco Gardin Jr. The organization aims to uplift the community by supporting low-income students or those who have the potential to be first-generation college students.\n\nThe center is more than just a project for Gardin. It’s a labor of love.\n\n“I love teaching students,” he said.\n\nBefore teaching in public schools, he was a bi-vocational minister. He left the classroom to continue his passion for teaching in a different way.\n\n“Through a mentor, I learned about the TRIO Upward Bound math and science program,” Gardin explained. “It started with three programs, thus the name TRIO. But it has since expanded to eight programs, with ours specifically focusing on Upward Bound math and science. The goal was to level the educational playing field.”\n\nEstablished in 1964 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverthttps://www.zeffy.com/en-US/donation-form/b9cb99e6-6c91-4e2c-bf04-5dddad3832c2ge students. They also run a culture program, taking students to visit schools and cities they might never have had the chance to experience, like Atlanta, Washington DC, Charleston, and New Orleans.\n\nTo donate to the cause, visit the New Covenant Community Development Center’s website.\n\nA few weeks back, WCNC Charlotte learned about the nonprofit Culinary Connections during one of our community listening sessions, a WCNC Charlotte effort to know the big issues in our neighborhoods and how we can help seek solutions.\n\nCulinary Connections cooking classes are meant for kids in Charlotte’s underserved neighborhoods to offer various skills.\n\nChef Andarrio Johnson is one of the program founders. The program launched amid the pandemic lockdowns when some kids lost access to meals they otherwise received at school.\n\n“When the kids are out of school, we just feed them four or five days a week,” Johnson recalled.\n\nFollowing the old proverb about teaching a man how to fish, he says the program eventually branched out into the lessons.\n\n“If you receive, you got to give back and the communities take care of me,” Johnson said. “I got to take care of my community.”\n\nWCNC Charlotte, the TEGNA Foundation, the Parham Family Charitable Fund and Steel Skin Realty are proud to support Culinary Connections. All of us came together to present them with a $5,000 check.\n\nCulinary Connection has an online wishlist. For those wishing to support the program, donations can be made online.\n\nCharlotte non-profit making an impact with students and career goals\n\nROC Charlotte is a nonprofit focused on recruiting, educating and mentoring high school students for high-demand trades. Training happens during the school day, and students are bussed from six schools in under-served areas around Charlotte to ROC campuses to actively work towards their career goals. The construction-based curriculum has three main areas of focus: electrical, mechanical and carpentry.\n\nWhile many see the work at hand as a high school shop class, ROC Director Darren Ash emphasized this is training that is truly getting students ahead of the curve when it comes to the construction trade and fills a frequently missing trade training pipeline from schools to the construction industry.\n\nThe ROC tries to support students as much as possible in their transition into apprenticeships, even with services like transportation to and from job sites. Five years ago, the organization started with 25 students. Now, they serve 200. Ash said it costs after $5,000 to send one student through the program for a year.\n\nWCNC Charlotte, the TEGNA Foundation, the Parham Family Charitable Fund and Steel Skin Realty believe in helping people in the community get ahead and learn new skills. The groups presented the ROC with $10,000 to continue its education efforts and WCNC will follow two students throughout the year on their progress through the ROC program.\n\nTo donate to the cause, visit the ROC Charlotte’s website.\n\n— See our full ROC Spotlight here —\n\nAnnual Scouting for Food collects food for those in need\n\nFor 32 years WCNC Charlotte has teamed up with Boy Scouts of America to help fight hunger in the community and make a difference through the Scouting For Food drive.\n\nText the word SCOUT4FOOD to 44321 to donate\n\nScouting For Food is the super bowl of food drive for Nourish Up, formerly known as Loaves & Fishes/Friendship Trays. While the non-profit’s name has changed, their mission is still the same: to nourish neighbors with food and compassion.\n\nAll of the donations collected by the Mecklenburg County Council benefit Nourish Up. Scouting For Food is their single largest food drive of the year. In 2023 Nourish Up fed 137,806 people compared to 106,000 people in 2022. This is the highest in their 48 year history, eclipsing the height of the recession in the mid-2000’s when they fed 126,000.\n\nFood and monetary donations through Scouting for Food in Mecklenburg County provide much needed groceries and hope to neighbors in need in our community through Nourish Up. So many people in our community are living paycheck to paycheck and on such a tight budget that with the increased cost of food, fuel, and housing – there is often not enough left to also put food on the table. Parents often skip meals so their children have enough to eat.\n\nNo one should have to worry about where their next meal will come from. To make an online monetary donation, text the word SCOUT4FOOD to 44321 to support Nourish Up.\n\nScouts with the Mecklenburg County Council, Central NC Council and Palmetto Council will go door-to-door on Saturday, Feb. 3 to collect much-needed donations for various food pantries.\n\nScouts will collect donations in Mecklenburg, York, Lancaster, Anson, Union, Cabarrus, Rowan and Stanly counties.\n\nFor more on how to donate and find a location near you, click here\n\nHelp make sure every child has a gift this holiday\n\nWith inflation and the burden of high costs, thousands of families in the Charlotte area community are turning to The Salvation Army for support this holiday season.

He invited her to his barn.\n\n“I said, ‘I wonder what she’d be like on a horse,'” Swimmer recalled. “And I put her on a horse. And boy, she lit up. And I said ‘This is for me.'”\n\nChildren with special needs are invited to the barn to ride for therapy, free of charge. And once a child starts, they never age out. The Mitey Riders program lets them come for all long as they want, for free.\n\n“Horses are amazing animals,” Swimmer said. “They know what’s going on. I had a great big horse, and I had a child on the horse. And it was in the ring, and I was working the class. All of a sudden, we turned around and looked, and a horse stopped dead in his tracks. And we went over, and the little boy was having a seizure. The horse knew before we did.”\n\nAll students ride the horses free of charge thanks to generous donations to the nonprofit Mitey Riders from the community. WCNC Charlotte, the TEGNA Foundation, Steel Skin Realty and the Parham Family Charitable Fund have donated $5,000 to Mitey Riders.

WCNC Charlotte is working with 1CAN, a nonprofit that serves those in need in Cabarrus County. The nonprofit has a total of seven Blessing Boxes in Concord and Kannapolis. A Blessing Box is similar to a little free library, only it is filled with food and toiletry items. Those in need can take the items at no cost.\n\nSheryl Kluge founded the nonprofit in 2019 and said the need is even greater now than during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nVolunteers with 1CAN restock the boxes, sometimes daily. Their boxes at Rotary Square, Fire Station 4 in Concord and boxes at Cabarrus Health Alliance and Fire Station1 in Kannapolis remain the busiest boxes that serve many people daily.\n\n1CAN needs donations of food and personal hygiene items. Items can be purchased from their Amazon Smile wish list.\n\nWCNC Charlotte, the TEGNA Foundation, Steel Skin Realty and the Parham Family Charitable Fund donated $5,000 to 1CAN to help neighbors in need.\n\nWCNC Charlotte also purchased personal hygiene items and assembled them into bags to distribute in Blessing Boxes.\n\nA simple hygiene kit includes the following:\n\nToothpasteToothbrushSoapShampoo\n\nItems can be sample size or full and should be placed in a sealed Ziplock bag.\n\nAdditional suggested items to include:\n\nDeodorantWashclothWipesBand-aidsLotionCombsWomen’s sanitary productsChapstickGlovesSocksHatsQ TipsHand sanitizerDo not include razors since they can be used to hurt someone\n\nThe nonprofit also needs help keeping the boxes stocked.

It’s a labor of love.\n\n“I love teaching students,” he said.\n\nBefore teaching in public schools, he was a bi-vocational minister. He left the classroom to continue his passion for teaching in a different way.\n\n“Through a mentor, I learned about the TRIO Upward Bound math and science program,” Gardin explained. “It started with three programs, thus the name TRIO. But it has since expanded to eight programs, with ours specifically focusing on Upward Bound math and science. The goal was to level the educational playing field.”\n\nEstablished in 1964 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverthttps://www.zeffy.com/en-US/donation-form/b9cb99e6-6c91-4e2c-bf04-5dddad3832c2ge students.

The program launched amid the pandemic lockdowns when some kids lost access to meals they otherwise received at school.\n\n“When the kids are out of school, we just feed them four or five days a week,” Johnson recalled.\n\nFollowing the old proverb about teaching a man how to fish, he says the program eventually branched out into the lessons.\n\n“If you receive, you got to give back and the communities take care of me,” Johnson said. “I got to take care of my community.”\n\nWCNC Charlotte, the TEGNA Foundation, the Parham Family Charitable Fund and Steel Skin Realty are proud to support Culinary Connections. All of us came together to present them with a $5,000 check.\n\nCulinary Connection has an online wishlist. For those wishing to support the program, donations can be made online.\n\nCharlotte non-profit making an impact with students and career goals\n\nROC Charlotte is a nonprofit focused on recruiting, educating and mentoring high school students for high-demand trades. Training happens during the school day, and students are bussed from six schools in under-served areas around Charlotte to ROC campuses to actively work towards their career goals. The construction-based curriculum has three main areas of focus: electrical, mechanical and carpentry.\n\nWhile many see the work at hand as a high school shop class, ROC Director Darren Ash emphasized this is training that is truly getting students ahead of the curve when it comes to the construction trade and fills a frequently missing trade training pipeline from schools to the construction industry.\n\nThe ROC tries to support students as much as possible in their transition into apprenticeships, even with services like transportation to and from job sites. Five years ago, the organization started with 25 students. Now, they serve 200. Ash said it costs after $5,000 to send one student through the program for a year.\n\nWCNC Charlotte, the TEGNA Foundation, the Parham Family Charitable Fund and Steel Skin Realty believe in helping people in the community get ahead and learn new skills. The groups presented the ROC with $10,000 to continue its education efforts and WCNC will follow two students throughout the year on their progress through the ROC program.\n\nTo donate to the cause, visit the ROC Charlotte’s website.\n\n— See our full ROC Spotlight here —\n\nAnnual Scouting for Food collects food for those in need\n\nFor 32 years WCNC Charlotte has teamed up with Boy Scouts of America to help fight hunger in the community and make a difference through the Scouting For Food drive.\n\nText the word SCOUT4FOOD to 44321 to donate\n\nScouting For Food is the super bowl of food drive for Nourish Up, formerly known as Loaves & Fishes/Friendship Trays. While the non-profit’s name has changed, their mission is still the same: to nourish neighbors with food and compassion.\n\nAll of the donations collected by the Mecklenburg County Council benefit Nourish Up. Scouting For Food is their single largest food drive of the year. In 2023 Nourish Up fed 137,806 people compared to 106,000 people in 2022. This is the highest in their 48 year history, eclipsing the height of the recession in the mid-2000’s when they fed 126,000.\n\nFood and monetary donations through Scouting for Food in Mecklenburg County provide much needed groceries and hope to neighbors in need in our community through Nourish Up. So many people in our community are living paycheck to paycheck and on such a tight budget that with the increased cost of food, fuel, and housing – there is often not enough left to also put food on the table. Parents often skip meals so their children have enough to eat.\n\nNo one should have to worry about where their next meal will come from. To make an online monetary donation, text the word SCOUT4FOOD to 44321 to support Nourish Up.\n\nScouts with the Mecklenburg County Council, Central NC Council and Palmetto Council will go door-to-door on Saturday, Feb. 3 to collect much-needed donations for various food pantries.\n\nScouts will collect donations in Mecklenburg, York, Lancaster, Anson, Union, Cabarrus, Rowan and Stanly counties.\n\nFor more on how to donate and find a location near you, click here\n\nHelp make sure every child has a gift this holiday\n\nWith inflation and the burden of high costs, thousands of families in the Charlotte area community are turning to The Salvation Army for support this holiday season.

It’s a labor of love.\n\n“I love teaching students,” he said.\n\nBefore teaching in public schools, he was a bi-vocational minister. He left the classroom to continue his passion for teaching in a different way.\n\n“Through a mentor, I learned about the TRIO Upward Bound math and science program,” Gardin explained. “It started with three programs, thus the name TRIO. But it has since expanded to eight programs, with ours specifically focusing on Upward Bound math and science. The goal was to level the educational playing field.”\n\nEstablished in 1964 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverthttps://www.zeffy.com/en-US/donation-form/b9cb99e6-6c91-4e2c-bf04-5dddad3832c2ge students. They also run a culture program, taking students to visit schools and cities they might never have had the chance to experience, like Atlanta, Washington DC, Charleston, and New Orleans.\n\nTo donate to the cause, visit the New Covenant Community Development Center’s website.\n\nA few weeks back, WCNC Charlotte learned about the nonprofit Culinary Connections during one of our community listening sessions, a WCNC Charlotte effort to know the big issues in our neighborhoods and how we can help seek solutions.\n\nCulinary Connections cooking classes are meant for kids in Charlotte’s underserved neighborhoods to offer various skills.\n\nChef Andarrio Johnson is one of the program founders. The program launched amid the pandemic lockdowns when some kids lost access to meals they otherwise received at school.\n\n“When the kids are out of school, we just feed them four or five days a week,” Johnson recalled.\n\nFollowing the old proverb about teaching a man how to fish, he says the program eventually branched out into the lessons.\n\n“If you receive, you got to give back and the communities take care of me,” Johnson said. “I got to take care of my community.”\n\nWCNC Charlotte, the TEGNA Foundation, the Parham Family Charitable Fund and Steel Skin Realty are proud to support Culinary Connections. All of us came together to present them with a $5,000 check.\n\nCulinary Connection has an online wishlist. For those wishing to support the program, donations can be made online.\n\nCharlotte non-profit making an impact with students and career goals\n\nROC Charlotte is a nonprofit focused on recruiting, educating and mentoring high school students for high-demand trades. Training happens during the school day, and students are bussed from six schools in under-served areas around Charlotte to ROC campuses to actively work towards their career goals. The construction-based curriculum has three main areas of focus: electrical, mechanical and carpentry.\n\nWhile many see the work at hand as a high school shop class, ROC Director Darren Ash emphasized this is training that is truly getting students ahead of the curve when it comes to the construction trade and fills a frequently missing trade training pipeline from schools to the construction industry.\n\nThe ROC tries to support students as much as possible in their transition into apprenticeships, even with services like transportation to and from job sites. Five years ago, the organization started with 25 students. Now, they serve 200. Ash said it costs after $5,000 to send one student through the program for a year.\n\nWCNC Charlotte, the TEGNA Foundation, the Parham Family Charitable Fund and Steel Skin Realty believe in helping people in the community get ahead and learn new skills. The groups presented the ROC with $10,000 to continue its education efforts and WCNC will follow two students throughout the year on their progress through the ROC program.\n\nTo donate to the cause, visit the ROC Charlotte’s website.\n\n— See our full ROC Spotlight here —\n\nAnnual Scouting for Food collects food for those in need\n\nFor 32 years WCNC Charlotte has teamed up with Boy Scouts of America to help fight hunger in the community and make a difference through the Scouting For Food drive.\n\nText the word SCOUT4FOOD to 44321 to donate\n\nScouting For Food is the super bowl of food drive for Nourish Up, formerly known as Loaves & Fishes/Friendship Trays. While the non-profit’s name has changed, their mission is still the same: to nourish neighbors with food and compassion.\n\nAll of the donations collected by the Mecklenburg County Council benefit Nourish Up. Scouting For Food is their single largest food drive of the year. In 2023 Nourish Up fed 137,806 people compared to 106,000 people in 2022. This is the highest in their 48 year history, eclipsing the height of the recession in the mid-2000’s when they fed 126,000.\n\nFood and monetary donations through Scouting for Food in Mecklenburg County provide much needed groceries and hope to neighbors in need in our community through Nourish Up. So many people in our community are living paycheck to paycheck and on such a tight budget that with the increased cost of food, fuel, and housing – there is often not enough left to also put food on the table. Parents often skip meals so their children have enough to eat.\n\nNo one should have to worry about where their next meal will come from. To make an online monetary donation, text the word SCOUT4FOOD to 44321 to support Nourish Up.\n\nScouts with the Mecklenburg County Council, Central NC Council and Palmetto Council will go door-to-door on Saturday, Feb. 3 to collect much-needed donations for various food pantries.\n\nScouts will collect donations in Mecklenburg, York, Lancaster, Anson, Union, Cabarrus, Rowan and Stanly counties.\n\nFor more on how to donate and find a location near you, click here\n\nHelp make sure every child has a gift this holiday\n\nWith inflation and the burden of high costs, thousands of families in the Charlotte area community are turning to The Salvation Army for support this holiday season.
