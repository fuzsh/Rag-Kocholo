        "text": "If you are reading these lines, chances are you doing so from a major urban center. Most probably from one of the five or ten most populous cities in your country, where the ingredients necessary to achieve success are found in greater quantity. Money, opportunity, know how. This is true for all areas of life and sports are no exception.\n\nIn general, it is in the biggest metropolis that the best athletes and coaches live. Where the pool of talent is wider, the best infrastructures are located, the conditions to promote large-scale events are more favourable. Where investment in sport, regardless of the level, makes more sense, leading to sports excellence and significant outcomes. Think about the most relevant sports organizations or competitions you are aware off and the association to the major geographical landmarks jumps off the page in a way that small towns in an online map do not.\n\nUntil you zoom in, of course. To point the microscope at less preeminent places that for some combination of tradition, history and luck have contributed decisively to the evolution and popularity of many sports, forging a name for themselves due to such indelible connection. In most cases, this higher recognition stems from a local sports club that has frequently punched above its weight, but a location can also be propped up by an iconic venue and/or competition that puts the land under the spotlight on a regular basis.\n\nExamples abound of cities, towns or villages that have seen their profile exponentiated through the power of sport yet might prove fully unfamiliar to someone detached from the sports phenomena, and in this article we will highlight half a dozen of them, showing that geographical obscurity is far from an indicator of sports irrelevance.\n\nOrnskoldsvik (Sweden)\n\nSurrounded by large forests, Örnsköldsvik would be just another long-winded town in the European E4 highway, which traverses much of Sweden along the Gulf of Bothnia up to Lapland and the Finnish border, were it not for its standing as Sweden’s ice hockey hotbed.\n\nBirthplace of Mo och Domsjö AB, or MoDo, a large Swedish corporation in the pulp and paper industry, the local club, founded in 1921, would take up the name of its main sponsor a few decades later, eventually becoming an integral part of a hockey-crazy community that develops world class talent with outstanding regularity.\n\nThe likes of Peter Forsberg, Markus Naslund, twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin and 2020 NHL Playoffs MVP Victor Hedman came through the youth ranks of MODO Hockey before starring at the highest levels of the sport, and the two-time National Champions (1979, 2007) continue to be the main attraction in town despite lingering in the second tier of Swedish Hockey since 2016, with the waterfront Fjällräven Center accommodating up to 1 in 4 of Örnsköldsvik’s 33k inhabitants.\n\nKiel (Germany)\n\nThough by no means a small city, the 250k residents of Kiel place it just inside the top 30 amongst German cities, which is probably low enough to qualify for this list. A significant port city in the Baltic Sea with an history of shipbuilding and anchoring the German Navy fleet and cruise ships, Kiel’s claim to fame in international terms is sports-related and two-pronged.\n\nThe capital of Schleswig-Holstein annually organizes the biggest sailing event in the world, the Kiel week, in which hundreds of vessels compete on the wind-swept waters of the Bay of Kiel in late June to the amazement of large crowds of domestic and overseas visitors, whereas headlines are made year-round by the exploits of the local handball powerhouse, THW Kiel.\n\nNicknamed the Zebras for their colour ensemble, the record 22-times German Champions lack no pulling power, prying away the sport’s best players from more glamorous locations, such as Barcelona or Paris, due to a strong European record substantiated on four EHF Champions League titles and the allure of playing in front of full houses in a handball-loving city.\n\nRecco (Italy)\n\nA quiet commune in the Metropolitan area of Genoa, Recco lies in the same Ligurian Coast that every year attracts hordes of tourists to the picturesque, cliff-hanging towns of Cinque Terre, but on any given day feels like a world away. Its 10k inhabitants enjoy the same Mediterranean seaside views and boast about the local food delight, focaccia al formaggio, yet the town only bustles when locals flock to Piscine di Albaro, home to the most successful men’s Water Polo club in history.\n\nFounded in 1913, Pro Recco, the perennial Italian Champions, have hoarded three times more league trophies (33 to 11) than anyone else in the country, and managed to extend their ravenous streak to the continental scale, collecting the most LEN Champions League titles (9) and final appearances (16) in history. And with a women’s team, which entered the fold in 2011 and quickly claimed National and European honours, now contributing to the barrage of silverware, it is hard to see club and city taken off the pedestal any time soon.\n\nLe Mans (France)\n\nLocated on the Loire Valley but just north of the more prominent wine regions of Nantes, Angers or Tours, the old city of Le Mans would be destined to play second fiddle were it not for its place in motorsports lore.\n\nThe semi-permanent Circuit de La Sarthe, which comprises private, race-specific sections in addition to public roads on the limits of the city, has hosted since 1923 the oldest endurance sports car race in the world, the iconic 24 Hours of Le Mans, attracting to town over 100k visitors each June to double the town’s population.\n\nDriving around day and night, winners are required to clock over 5000 km and hundreds of laps around the 13.6 km course to encounter the chequered flag at lunch time, and the race, broadcasted and followed by millions of devotees around the world, truly puts the French city on the map, featuring alongside the Monaco F1 Grand Prix and Indianapolis 500 as part of the so-called Triple Crown of Motorsport, the most prestigious motor races.\n\nSt. Andrews (Scotland)\n\nKnown for its sandy beaches and harbouring the oldest University in Scotland, the mention of St. Andrews, a community of around 17,000 people located on the East Coast of Great Britain, elicits a different kind of emotion on golf enthusiasts, aware of this town’s role in the sport’s history.\n\nFirst played here in the 15th century, the town houses two of golf’s utmost markers. The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, a private, members-only club, that until 2004 was one of the rulemaking authorities of the game worldwide, and St. Andrews Links, the “Home of golf”, a group of seven undulating golf courses on the seaside, all open to the public, that includes the prestigious Old Course at St Andrews.\n\nBrimming with tradition in every hole, the latter is considered the oldest golf course in the world, and it is the most used venue for The Open Championship (British Open), the longest surviving Major tournament in the World, functioning as a mecca for both amateur afficionados and seasoned professionals, dreaming of the one victory that leaves an ultimate mark on the history books.\n\nGreen Bay (USA)\n\nOne of the oldest European settlements in America, the third biggest city in the State of Wisconsin fails to crack USA’s Top 250 rank by population, yet few fanbases are as proud of their sports team, the NFL’s Green Bay Packers, as the “cheeseheads”, who have filled the emblematic Lambeau Field for every home game dating back to 1960.\n\nA centenary institution with broad grassroots support, Green Bay’s American football team holds the distinction of being the only non-profit, community-owned franchise in North America’s four traditional major leagues, evading the usual individual or corporate property model to effectively belong to the more than 360,000 stockholders, a number three times higher than the city residents.\n\nMoreover, despite representing the smallest major league sports market in North America, the Green and Gold have been able to achieve unprecedented success, claiming a record number of titles, 13, including four Super Bowl victories (the last in 2010), and boasting the most wins (over 800) and highest win–loss record (.571) in NFL history to merit reverence that extends well beyond its base on a corner of the American Upper Midwest.\n\nA writer’s best practice when it comes to composing a simple, straight-to-the point introduction? Make sure you have no time whatsoever to get cute.\n\nFive years ago, I picked eight athletes to watch, and my hit rate was quite good (just disregard the top image selection here), so I am back for more. There will be no Katie Ledecky or Simone Biles this time, for obvious reasons, but I have broadened the group to expand coverage in a couple of sports.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are eleven athletes to watch at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics:\n\nAriarne Titmus (Australia, Swimming)\n\nFew enduring Olympic rivalries are as compelling as Australia vs USA in the pool and the pinnacle of that duel in Tokyo promises to be the women’s 400 meters freestyle event. Katie Ledecky, America’s darling, is expected to defend the title on her way to another multiple gold medal haul, yet reigning World Champion Ariarne Titmus would like to have a word on the proceedings and the Tasmanian swimmer hasn’t been afraid to spit fire towards her opponent in the recent months.\n\nNicknamed the “Terminator”, Titmus not only upset an ailing Ledecky at the 2019 Worlds, but has proven she can go head-to-head against the best version of her rival by posting the second-best time in history at the Australian trials, just 0.44 seconds off the American’s personal best and more than two seconds better than Ledecky’s top result of 2021. On the form of her life, the 20-year-old will shoot for the moon, looking to get out Ledecky’s shadow in the 200m, where the Aussie swimmer currently boasts the 2021 world leading time, and 800m freestyle.\n\nSander Sagosen (Norway, Handball)\n\nFor the first time since 1972, Norway, the most successful team in women’s handball history, will also compete in the Olympic men’s handball competition, and all eyes will rest on their All-Star left back, the man tasked with leading the nation to a maiden tournament victory following silver medals at the 2017 and 2019 World Championships and a third-place finish at the 2020 Euros.\n\nA 25-year-old bomber on course to shatter all goalscoring records in team history, Sagosen’s contributions and talent are undeniable, yet the overwhelming performance that would put team and individual over the top is still to arrive. A Champions League winner in 2020 with THW Kiel following a surprise move from the star-studded ensemble at Paris St. German, Sagosen has been a top scorer and All-Star member in several international competitions, but so far has been unable to land the coveted IHF World Player of the Year crown that many believe is within his grasp. Breaking through in Tokyo against the likes of Denmark, defending World and Olympic Champions, or France, finalists in Rio 2016, would go a long way towards correcting that gap.\n\nYulimar Rojas (Venezuela, Athletics)\n\nAn Olympic silver medallist in 2016, trailing Colombia’s Catherine Ibarguen, with whom she has fought some epic duels, Rojas finds herself on the edge of history in Tokyo, the women’s triple jump world record, one of the longest standing in women’s athletics, looming large in the horizon.\n\nThe reigning Women’s World Athlete of the Year, Rojas has held the indoor world mark since last year, and she recently equalled her personal best of 15.43m at an outdoor meeting in Spain to bring the discussion to the fore. Just 7cm short of the impression set by Ukrainian Inessa Kravets at the 1995 World Championship, soaring past it would be the ultimate achievement for the 25-year-old, a two-time World Champion who is also looking to become the first female Olympic Champion in Venezuela’s history.\n\nWout van Aert (Belgium, Road cycling)\n\nA triple stage winner at the recent Tour de France, van Aert is one of the men vying for an historical double victory in Tokyo, with his name figuring atop the oddsmakers lists for both the road race event, contested on the 24th, and the time trial, scheduled for four days later.\n\nAn outstanding bike talent whose successful cyclo-cross career merited three consecutive World Championship titles (2016-2018), the 26-year-old has gone from strength to strength since a move to the more financially rewarding road discipline in 2017, turning into, arguably, the most versatile rider in the peloton and a contender in all kinds of races. A threat to elite sprinters in bunch finales, the World Championship silver medallist is also capable of powering up short and steep climbs, dragging groups of climbing specialists to the highest mountain passes or rolling against the clock better than almost everyone.\n\nThe 234km-long race should be right up the Belgian’s alley, with a couple of long climbs in Mount Fuji’s area culling the field expected to fight for gold at Fuji Speedway circuit, whereas the time trial, which rans along hilly terrain in the circuit’s vicinity, also suits van Aert, who last weekend bested all rivals at the final Tour de France TT.\n\nLuka Doncic (Slovenia, Basketball)\n\nThe Slovenian wonderkid singlehandedly dashed the hopes of three-time Olympic medallists Lithuania in the final Qualification round to stamp his nation’s first appearance on the biggest stage of international basketball, and the best might still be to come for the 2017 Eurobasket winners.\n\nFresh of another MVP-caliber campaign for the Dallas Mavericks, Doncic’s one-man show figures to be one of the major attractions on a wide-open tournament that sees the United States ahead of the pack, but not looking as untouchable as anticipated. A savant with otherworldly vision and uncanny ability to pick defences apart, the 22-year-old guard will handle a lot of the ball for a Slovenian team missing his usual partner-in-crime, Miami Heat’s Goran Dragic, yet the single elimination format provides the platform for more heroic performances and upsets. Dragging small Slovenia to a medal would qualify as Doncic’s biggest career achievement to date and that is saying a lot for a player used to rewrite records of precociousness in the NBA.\n\nJanja Garnbret (Slovenia, Sport Climbing)\n\nOne of the newest attractions in the Olympic program, Sport Climbing’s debut will also introduce the world to extraordinary athletes of the ilk of Janja Garnbret. More than just another Slovenian making the rounds, the 22-year-old has been racking up the accolades since age 17 and is already considered the greatest competitive sports climber ever. Displaying a cat-like agility on the plastic walls, Garnbret composure stands out as she holds to crimps, balances on boulders, and completes audacious jumps to slap the top of the course faster than any other competitor.\n\nAn eight-time World Cup discipline winner and six-time World Champion, Garnbret swept all World Cup events in bouldering in 2019 and displays similar credentials in lead climbing to emerge as the prohibitive favourite for the women’s gold medal. Even if the Olympics controversial decision to attribute just one set of medals, in a combined format, clouds her prospects slightly, giving equal importance to the opening speed discipline where she rarely competes.\n\nShoei Ono (Japan, Judo)\n\nNo sport in history has shipped more gold medals to Japan than Judo, a martial art invented in the country, and a few more are about to be added to the total this summer, with Japanese judokas positioned at the top of the world rankings in every weight category. Amongst the group of medal favourites, one clearly stands out, the lightweight Shoei Ono, who is hailed as one of the most dominant athletes in the world.\n\nA three-time World Champion in the -73 kg, Ono has remained undefeated internationally since 2014, claiming Olympic gold in Rio de Janeiro in the process, and his choke on the competition gives no sign of relaxing. Aged 29, he is at the peak of his abilities after taking some long breaks in the last Olympic cycle, and his usage of the classical osoto-gari (large outer-reap leg throw) and uchimata techniques (inner tight throw) is still working to devastating effect. Renowned for winning matches by the highest score (ippon) with incredible regularity, Ono can save energy throughout the day of competition, and that usually comes in handy in the latter stages.\n\nSky Brown (Great Britain, Skateboarding)\n\nThe third-ranked park skateboarder in the world, Great Britain’s Sky Brown won’t be the youngest athlete competing in Tokyo – that honour belongs to Hend Zaza, a 12-year-old Syrian table-tennis player – but she is, by far, the most precocious medal contender on any sport.\n\nA professional skateboarder since age 10, when she signed a sponsorship agreement with Nike, Brown was born in Japan but competes for the country of her father, in representation of which she collected a bronze medal at the 2019 World Championships. Victim .of a horrifying fall in training last year, when she suffered skull fractures and broke her left wrist and hand, the girl who learns new tricks on Youtube and has trained with the legendary Tony Hawk did not let fear get in the way, continuing to spin through the air to complete the multitude of tricks that characterize her debutant Olympic sport. Based on what she has achieved so far, we doubt even the Sky is a limit for Brown.\n\nCaeleb Dressel (USA, Swimming)\n\nA double gold medallist in relay events at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Dressel was cast as the successor to Michael Phelps and all he has done in this Olympic cycle is become the most dominant swimmer in the world, hoarding medals at similar rates to the greatest Olympian of All-Time.\n\nA well-known name for any swimming fan after amassing 15 World Championship medals between 2017 and 2019, Dressel’s coming out party to the masses at home is scheduled for Tokyo, where he is expected to compete for up to seven titles. Hard to miss in the pool due to a striking tattoo on the left arm that features an eagle, a bear and a gator, the Florida-born swimmer will swim several relay events and three individual races, the 50 and 100-free, where a smattering of rivals should make things incredibly tight, plus his signature event, the 100m butterfly, where he holds the world record that used to belong to his famous compatriot. If things go according to plan, no athlete should leave Tokyo with a more decorated suitcase than Dressel and, at age 24, he might have a couple more Olympics on him to aim for a distinct spot in the all-time medal rank.\n\nNaomi Osaka (Japan, Tennis)\n\nFrom the moment she elected Japanese citizenship over American in October 2019, Naomi Osaka has been anointed as the face of Tokyo 2020. A fan favourite around the globe for her charming oddball personality, she is young, successful, marketable and the only global superstar of the host nation. And with that comes an insane amount of pressure that Osaka’s recent months have failed to diffuse.\n\nThe highest earning female athlete in the world was last seen in early June (UPDATE: Recent reports indicate she was seen playing with fire at the opening ceremony), citing mental health issues when she retired from the French Open after a public dispute over mandatory media assignments, and it is unknown what version of Osaka will show up to compete for a gold medal that would set her up for tennis immortality. Already a four-time Grand Slam Champion at age 23, she is the tour’s dominant figure in hard courts, the surface used at the Olympic event, and boasts all the tools to become the heir to Serena Williams’ throne on top of women’s tennis, but we still don’t truly know if her head will get in the way. In Tokyo and for years to come.\n\nArmand Duplantis (Sweden, Athletics)\n\nThe 2016 men’s pole vault final, which crowned home favourite Thiago Braz da Silva, went down as one of the most exhilarating events of the Rio Games, and if it is up to the prodigious Duplantis, fireworks is something we can expect from the Tokyo Final on August 3rd.\n\nThe American-born pole vaulter was catapulted to the top of the list of gold medal contenders last year when he set the all-time best marks both indoors (6.18m) and outdoors (6.14m), but he has yet to win a major global meet, taking second place at the 2019 World Championships. Outlasted by American Sam Kendricks on that occasion, the 21-year-old will be determined to not allow it to happen again and raising the bar to unreachable heights is the way to do it. Should he tag a few more centimetres to his world record, it would just be the confirmation that Duplantis is one to appreciate for years to come.\n\nAnd we finally reach the magical 11, the ultimate flag bearers whose talents are appreciated and recognized by a significant part of the global population. Footballers, NBA players and tennis legends populate this final entrance.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo (Greece 🇬🇷, Basketball)\n\nFrom hawking watches and sunglasses in the streets of Athens to NBA superstardom, Antetokoumpo’s journey is a true tale of rags to riches that has been spurred by his parents’ decision to leave Nigeria and emigrate to Greece.\n\nThe son of two former athletes, Giannis was playing for lower-division side Filathlitikos when grainy images of his performances started making the rounds in NBA circles, eventually convincing the Milwaukee Bucks to select this scrawny kid with the 15th pick in the 2013 NBA Draft.\n\nThat turned out to be the best decision in the franchise’s history, as the raw teenager that would later earn the monitor “Greek Freak” soon displayed exceptional size, speed and ball handling skills. Developing into an All-star calibre player by 2016, and one of the world’s finest basketballers soon after, he captured back-to-back Most Valuable Player Awards in 2019 and 2020, emerging as the NBA’s embodiment of the next age player, capable of playing across all five positions and impacting games on defence and offense.\n\nA Greek citizen since 2013, the 26-year-old carries sky-high expectations on his broad shoulders as unprecedented feats are expected of both his national team and NBA ensemble in the near future, however nothing in his story suggests he will not be up to the task in hand.\n\nConor McGregor (Ireland 🇮🇪, Mixed Martial Arts)\n\nOne of the most notorious personalities in the world of Mixed Martial Arts and the world’s highest paid athlete according to Forbes’s 2021 list, Connor McGregor has come a long way since his discreet beginnings in the gyms of his native Dublin.\n\nSigned up in 2013 by the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship), the sport’s premier promotion company, he soon turned into one of its main draws, snatching the Featherweight Championship title after a stunning 13-second bout in 2015 before becoming the first man to simultaneously hold titles in two weight divisions (Featherweight and Lightweight) the following year.\n\nRenowned for pulling no punches on and off the arena, McGregor was named Ireland’s Sports Person of the Year and the World’s Best Fighter on the back of these achievements, and his profile exploded amongst combat sports enthusiasts to such degree that his name is attached to two of the most lucrative fights in history: his duel with Khabib Nurmagomedov in 2018, the most lucrative MMA event in history, and his only professional boxing appearance, against Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2017, which drew more than 5 million pay-per-view buys.\n\nRobert Lewandowski (Poland 🇵🇱, Football)\n\nRecognized as the world’s best footballer for the first time after firing Bayern Munich into an extraordinary six-trophy haul, Robert Lewandowski might be one of the few persons who will regard 2020 as one of the best years of his life. However, reaching the pinnacle of his sport had been a long time coming for Poland’s national icon.\n\nFor instance, we could look back to an unforgettable night eight years ago when he hanged four goals on Real Madrid to become the first man to accomplish such feat in a Champions League semi-final, and assert himself in front of world audiences, who would soon see him as one of the most outstanding strikers’ of the 2010’s. A Polish Champion with Lech Poznan, two-time German Champion with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich’s spearhead since a controversial free transfer in 2014, ”Lewa” has always let the goals do the talking for him, bagging the most ever by a foreign player in Bundesliga history and a record-tally for his country.\n\nEven if, at age 32, the Warsaw-native is running out of time to captain his national team to an international breakthrough, Lewandowski’s face – sometimes alongside his hugely successful wife Anna – appears everywhere you look in Poland, from massive billboards to TV commercials, inspiring him to write a bachelor’s thesis, titled ‘RL 9, path to glory’, on himself and a career arch towards immortality.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo (Portugal 🇵🇹, Football)\n\nArguably the most famous athlete in the planet, Cristiano Ronaldo, born in Madeira Island, baptized after a former American President and a name that has become synonymous with a nation, is admired, followed and worshipped around the world like few men before him.\n\nA testament to his ability to promote an iconic brand that crosses all divides and borders, but also to an unmatched work ethic that has delivered individual and team success in almost unprecedented levels. One of the most decorated football players of all time, including domestic titles in England (Manchester United), Spain (Real Madrid) and Italy (Juventus), Ronaldo has always delivered when it counts the most, being named the best player in the world in five occasions as he led his teams to five UEFA Champions League triumphs and Portugal to its first ever international honours, the Euro 2016 and the 2019 UEFA Nations League.\n\nAbout to go down as the greatest goal scorer of all-time, the 36-year-old is one of sports all-time greats, full stop, even if he will forever be linked (and maybe superseded) by Argentinian rival Lionel Messi, with whom he shared one the greatest eras football has ever seen.\n\nNovak Djokovic (Serbia 🇷🇸, Tennis)\n\nGrowing up in a blasted Belgrade during the years of the Balkan War, Novak Djokovic had ample reasons to develop the resiliency and thick skin that has served him so well during his years on top of the ATP Tour and as the most divisive member of men’s tennis Big Three.\n\nForever disliked by many as the guy that blew apart the Federer – Nadal duopoly, the Serbian broke through by winning the first of his nine Australian Open titles in 2008 and catapulted himself into All-Time Great status in 2011, channelling the momentum from leading his country to a first ever Davis Cup victory (2010) into a career-defining season that included three Grand Slam titles.\n\nRepeating the feat in 2015 on his way to becoming the first man in the Open Era to hold all four Majors at once, following his 2016 Roland Garros victory, the 34-year-old’s credentials in the GOAT debate include a positive head-to-head record against his main rivals, 20 Grand Slam singles titles, just one off the outright record, and the distinction as the man who has spent the most weeks as World No.1.\n\nTime will tell whether his late career push will prove enough, especially for his detractors, and if Djokovic can ever claim Olympic Gold for Serbia, the only significant hole in his resume, however his status as one of the greatest athletes ever is unimpeachable.\n\nPeter Sagan (Slovakia 🇸🇰, Cycling)\n\nOne of cycling’s boisterous personalities, Peter Sagan has singlehandedly put Slovakia on the sport’s map after a decade punctuated by memorable performances in the calendar’s most prestigious races.\n\nCombining an unmatched ability to manoeuvre a bike out of danger, elite finishing speed and powerful acceleration in short, steep climbs, Sagan has amassed more than 100 victories at the World Tour level and in all kinds of races. A stage winner in all three Grand Tours and record seven-time conqueror of the points classification at the Tour de France, the 31-year-old has also etched his name in the history of two Monuments, triumphing at the Tour de Flanders (2016) and Paris-Roubaix (2018) while sporting the iconic rainbow jersey reserved for the reigning Road Race World Champion.\n\nThe only man to win three straight world titles (2015-17), the Slovak showman has not only cultivated a large following amongst cycling fans but has also made more for Slovakia’s international recognition than any other fellow sportsman.\n\nLuka Dončić (Slovenia 🇸🇮, Basketball)\n\nThe Wonder Boy from Ljubliana who moved across Europe to join Real Madrid’s academy at age 13 and led them to the EuroLeague title as an 18-year-old, Doncic has been tipped as one of the greatest basketball talents to ever emerge in the continent and he is still to do anything that could dispel that notion.\n\nThe youngest player ever to be named the EuroLeague MVP (2018), and a crucial part of Slovenia’s maiden international success at the 2017 Eurobasket, the Slovenian star was already the most accomplished prospect in history when he finally entered the NBA in 2018, joining the Dallas Mavericks of German Dirk Nowitzki, arguably the greatest NBA player born this side of the pond.\n\nUnanimously voted as the league’s Rookie of the Year after his first season, Doncic’s versatility, court vision and unusual blend of size and strength for a point guard are expressed both on his gaudy box score totals – he consistently posts a triple double (10+ points, rebounds and assists in a game) – as well as in the way he controls the flow of games and produces highlight-reel plays that leave spectators astonished. Seen as a perennial NBA MVP candidate for the next decade, the 22-year-old is leading Slovenia to a maiden Olympic participation, and Tokyo will provide another opportunity to have the basketball world at his feet.\n\nRafael Nadal (Spain 🇪🇸, Tennis)\n\nThe history of Spanish sports in the XXI century is littered with success at the team and individual level. However, as the likes of Pau Gasol (Basketball), Alberto Contador (Cycling) or Fernando Alonso (Formula One) have slowly ridden into the sunset, the list of transcendental Spanish athletes has dimed to the point where Nadal’s appointment is as straightforward as it comes. Which is far from an indictment, as the heavy-topspinning teenager that broke into the scene 15 years ago has barely missed a beat into his thirties, further solidifying his case as not only the best to ever grace a tennis court, but also one of the greatest sportsman in history.\n\nBecause, beyond the weight of all the titles, medals, and accolades, from the 88 singles titles and record-equalling tally of 20 Majors to the two Olympic Gold Medals and five Davis Cups won in representation of his nation, seldom has there been an athlete so dominant, so terrifying to face, so inextricably connected with a specific place and tournament as Rafa, the thirteen-time conqueror, and Roland Garros, his nirvana. Many believe that defeating the King of Clay at Court Phillippe Chartrier is the ultimate sporting challenge and since he is a preposterous 105-3 (W-L) all-time at the French Open, can you really oppose that?\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic (Sweden 🇸🇪, Football)\n\nFew athletes manage to make their given name as famous and recognizable as the patronymic that adorns their shirts, but Zlatan isn’t and has never been like the rest of mortals. About to turn 40, he is still among the most charismatic and entertaining figures in world sport, still producing startling moments of magic on the pitch and delighting fans and media alike with his regular “Zlatanisms”.\n\nBorn in the poor, immigrant-heavy neighbourhood of Rosengard in Malmo to a Muslim Bosniak father and a Catholic Croat mother, the odds were stacked against Ibrahimovic. Yet, the strong-willed youngster with a brash personality would become the ultimate symbol of Sweden’s multicultural society as one of the country’s greatest sportsperson of all-time.\n\nA former national team captain and the nation’s record goalscorer, he is also one of the most decorated footballers ever, using his large stature, agility, and exquisite technique to become a leader and inspirational figure in many league-winning sides. Having scored close to 600 professional goals and amassed over 30 trophies, Zlatan’s career path includes a who’s who of Europe’s leading clubs, from Italy’s Milan, Inter and Juventus to Ajax, Manchester United, Barcelona and Paris St. German. Although he never consistently delivered at the level necessary to supplant his contemporaries as the best player in the world, Ibracadabra’s legacy to football history is as unique as they come.\n\nRoger Federer (Switzerland 🇨🇭, Tennis)\n\nA few months away from his 40th anniversary, Roger Federer is still widely regarded as the utmost representation of grace in the world of sport for his demeanour on and off the court, enjoying popularity that stretches beyond the realms of tennis and across borders and generations.\n\nThe perfect ambassador for a country that prides itself on its neutrality, the Swiss Maestro rose to the top of the world in 2003, winning at Wimbledon the first of his record eight Majors in grass courts, and has been bewitching audiences with his effortless movement and exquisite strokes throughout the so-called Golden Era of tennis, a period of unprecedented prestige for the sport dawned out of the dominance exerted by Federer.\n\nA 2008 Olympic gold medallist in the men’s doubles competition and vital to deliver Switzerland its first Davis Cup triumph in 2014, the man many consider the greatest tennis player to ever live was the first to reach 20 singles Grand Slam titles back in 2018 and is still in the hunt for more despite nagging knee injuries in recent years. The strength of Federer’s case in the debate that splinters tennis fandom will depend on what happens in the twilight of the Big Three’s career, yet his standing as a saint-like symbol of veneration and respect will reverberate through time.\n\nLewis Hamilton (United Kingdom 🇬🇧, Formula One Racing)\n\nThe most successful Formula 1 driver in history, Sir Lewis Hamilton has shaped the white-dominated sport on and off the track since he became the first – and still the only – black man to drive in the highest class of auto-racing.\n\nA World Champion for McLaren in just his second Formula 1 season, authoring a dramatic last corner overtake in the last race of the calendar to clinch the title, Hamilton’s career took off when he joined Mercedes in 2013, vaulting the constructor to a dominant position and allowing the Brit to claim the driver’s classification six more times and equal the record of German Michael Schumacher.\n\nHolder of the most wins, pole positions and podium finishes in history, the 36-year-old’s outspoken nature and activism are as much part of his unparalleled legacy as his sporting achievements. A prominent voice against racism and for increased diversity in motorsport, and an advocate on environmental issues and animal rights, Hamilton has never shied away from using his status as one of the most influential sportsmen in the world to drive important conversations, even in a conservative and secluded environment such as Formula 1.\n\nPart I – Introduction\n\nPart II – Women\n\nPart III – Domestic heroes\n\nPart IV – International Stars\n\nPart V – Global Icons\n\nBefore we get to the global icons, we risk twelve more names from the list in our second entrance of men’s athletes, including the representatives from the smallest and biggest states in the continent.\n\nDominic Thiem (Austria 🇦🇹, Tennis)\n\nSucceeding Alpine Skiing icon Marcel Hirscher – who retired in 2019 – as the face of Austrian sport could have been an unnerving task for many. For Dominic Thiem, it was just about taking an aggressive step forward, much in the same way he prepares to unleash some of the most devastating groundstrokes in men’s tennis.\n\nThe first male player born in the 1990s to claim a Grand Slam singles title by virtue of his 2020 US Open victory, Thiem’s trophy cabinet would certainly be far more garnished in any other era of men’s tennis. Which is different from saying he has not achieved a lot by age 27.\n\nInspired by countryman and former World No.1 Thomas Muster, Thiem has been a consistent top 10 ranked player since 2016 – peaking at No.3 -, has racked up close to 20 ATP titles and competed in four Grand Slam Finals thus far. Falling short twice to Rafael Nadal in Roland Garros and once to Novak Djokovic in Melbourne, the Austrian finally broke through with a come-from-behind defeat of Alexander Zverev in New York last year, and time seems to be on his side.\n\nTipped by many as the heir apparent to Nadal in clay and possessing the weapons to exert his will in the other surfaces, he figures to take an even bigger role as soon as Roger, Rafa and Novak finally step away from the limelight.\n\nEdin Dzeko (Bosnia and Herzegovina 🇧🇦, Football)\n\nFor more than a decade, the “Bosnian Diamond” has been the touchstone of Bosnia Herzegovina’s most successful era as a football nation – whose apogee was an unprecedented appearance at the 2014 FIFA World Cup – emerging as the captain, most capped player and top goalscorer in national team’s history.\n\nElected twice Bosnian Athlete of the Year, Dzeko’s breakthrough performance came in 2008-09, when he led the line for an unforgettable Bundesliga-winning campaign of outsiders VFL Wolfsburg, and he has since built an impressive career between Germany, England and Italy. The first player ever to score 50 goals in three of Europe’s top five major leagues, he’s grown a reputation as one of Europe’s most feared center forwards, topping the goal scoring charts in the Bundesliga and Serie A with current outfit AS Roma.\n\nAt age 35, Dzeko might not be the physical force he once was, a blend of strength, height, technique and instinct that had defenders on their toes, but he continues to be an idol for kids and grownups alike in his home nation as one of finest athletes to ever come out of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nGrigor Dimitrov (Bulgaria 🇧🇬, Tennis)\n\nRenowned as much for his charming all-around game as for a couple of high-profile romantic relationships, Grigor Dimitrov, one of tennis’ mercurial talents, is Bulgaria’s leading athlete even if his achievements are not at the same level as most of his cohorts featured in this list.\n\nBlessed with fluid ground strokes, especially an exquisite backhand that has earned comparisons to Roger Federer, and supremely athletic, the 29-year-old managed to rise to No.3 in the World after winning the biggest title of his career, the 2017 ATP Tour Finals, but subsequently failed to build on the momentum of his famous triumph and take the final steps towards the top of the sport.\n\nUltimately, if he does not pivot back up, the inability to fully deliver on his potential might cost the 2014 and 2017 Bulgarian Sportsman of the Year a spot amongst the pantheon of greatest athletes ever produced in the country, yet there is nothing wrong with “only” being a regular Top 10 player, holder of eight ATP titles, a Grand Slam semi-finalist in three occasions and a cult follow for many tennis fans.\n\nLukas Krpalek (Czech Republic 🇨🇿, Judo)\n\nThe most successful judoka born in the territory of former Czechoslovakia, Krpalek was the flag bearer for Czechia at the opening ceremony of the Rio Olympics and the only Czech athlete to leave the Summer Games with a gold medal.\n\nNicknamed the Intelligent Beast for his strategic acumen on the mat, the 198-cm tall heavyweight has moved from the -100kg to +100kg since 2016 while maintaining a string of successes. First crowned a World Champion in 2014, he celebrated another victory on the world stage in 2019, taking advantage of the absence of Teddy Riner, who figures to be the main obstacle standing on Krpalek’s road to a second Olympic title.\n\nAlso a three-time European Champion, Krpalek’s talent for sports is well documented, as he tried a plethora of different ones before landing on his career of choice by mistake. Despite asking to be enrolled in karate, a clerical mistake led him to a Judo class, and he has not looked back.\n\nMikkel Hansen (Denmark 🇩🇰, Handball)\n\nThe goalscoring catalyst of the Golden Era of Danish handball, the long-haired left back has landed pretty much every individual and team honour there is to win in the sport on his way to national immortality and international acclaim.\n\nPowered by a right-shooting arm capable of the most mind-bending feats, including one of the most iconic goals in Olympic history, Hansen has become an European (2012), World (2019) and Olympic Champion (2016) with his country and delivered memorable performances on the greatest stages to rack up countless nominations as Top Goalscorer, All-Star Team Member and Most Valuable Player in international tournaments over the last 10+ years.\n\nPeerless in Danish handball history, the 33-year-old has been named the IHF World Player of the Year on three occasions (2011, 2015 and 2018), a record he shares with Nikola Karabatic, his long-time club teammate (Paris St. Germain) and international foe (France), plus the man widely regarded as his main competition for the distinction as the greatest handball player of All-Time.\n\nTeddy Riner (France 🇫🇷, Judo)\n\nDistributing 130kg for a 2.03m frame, Teddy Riner cuts an imposing figure that has exerted almost unparalleled dominance on the tatamis since 2007, when, aged 18, he became the youngest Judo World Champion in history.\n\nBorn in the French overseas territory of Guadeloupe when his parents were on vacation, the Double Olympic Champion (2012 and 2016) and owner of an unprecedented ten World Championship gold medals has catapulted the sport into a new dimension competing on the heaviest judo category (+100kg). An insuperable blend of power, length, and athleticism, Riner went unmatched and unbeaten for an incredible 9 years and 5 months, recording 154 consecutive victories until Japanese Kokoro Kageura defeated him at – of all places – the 2020 Paris Grand Slam.\n\nNicknamed “Teddy Bear” for his smile and affable personality, for a man that once chose judo over team sports so that he could directly sway the outcome, any loss, especially on home soil, stings but will not deviate him from the stated goal ahead of the next Olympics. In Tokyo, Riner will emulate national hero Tadahiro Nomura if he manages to capture a third consecutive Olympic title.\n\nKristaps Porzingis (Latvia 🇱🇻, Basketball)\n\nStanding at 2.21m, Kristaps Porzingis was always destined to stick out in a crowd regardless of his career of choice. However, few jobs he could have choosen entail the same scrutiny as being the face of an illustrious NBA franchise representing the citizens of cosmopolitan New York City, a world away from small Liepaja, Latvia, his hometown, or Seville, Spain, where he would arrive as a lanky 16-year-old with anemia and leave as one of the brightest young basketball players in the world.\n\nFamously booed by NY Knicks fans in attendance after being selected No. 4 at the 2015 NBA Draft, the Latvian turned opinions around in the blink of an eye, flourishing into a uniquely versatile giant under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden. The #PorzinGod worshipped by the NY fandom, the original “Basketball Unicorn”, who impressed opposing players and basketball fans for his combination of height, mobility and shooting range, and a hero to the population of his Baltic nation.\n\nAlthough a serious knee injury suffered in early 2018 kept him out of the courts for almost two years and contributed to a hasty trade to the Dallas Mavericks, Porzingis’ best is probably still to come as the 25-year-old promises to band together for years to come with another European superstar on the cusp of eternal greatness.\n\nCharles Leclerc (Monaco 🇲🇨, Formula One Racing)\n\nIf there is one thing that defines Monte Carlo and the riches of life at the Principality, it is, undoubtedly, the Monaco Grand Prix, the most iconic race in the Formula One Calendar. And If there is one car constructor associated with the greatest auto racing competition in the world, that is Scuderia Ferrari and their emblematic red racing cars.\n\nCharles Leclerc, the fifth Monesgasque driver in F1 history, connects the two symbols to perfection, graduating from Ferrari Driver Academy with aplomb before snatching one of the team’s premium seats ahead of the 2019 season, the final stage of a trophy-laden progression through the youth ranks.\n\nThe son of a former Formula 3 driver and godson of the late Jules Bianchi, who died after a race crash in 2014, Leclerc did not take long to show his mantle, repaying Ferrari’s faith with two victories and a tour-best seven pole-positions in his debut season. At age 23, the expectation is that he will be the man to end the team’s drought in the Drivers Classification, which lasts since 2007, and become the first World Champion representing the Monésgasque microstate and its 39,300 inhabitants.\n\nEpke Zonderland (Netherlands 🇳🇱, Gymnastics)\n\nThe Netherlands sport’s lore is brimming with athletes nicknamed as the Flying Dutchman, from footballers which seemed to float over the pitch, to drivers or swimmers that defied physics on their way to the finish line. However, in a way, artistic gymnasts of the highest ilk fit the bill better, flying gracefully through the air to the amazement of the crowds.\n\nAnd amaze is something the light-haired Zonderland has done a lot during his horizontal and parallel bars routines since 2009, when he captured the first of six medals at the World Championships and earned the first of four nominations as Dutch Sportsman of the Year.\n\nThe first Dutch gymnast (male or female) to win an individual Olympic medal, capturing gold in London 2012 with a memorable performance in the horizontal bar, Epke “Wonderland” is also popular amongst gymnastics fans across the world for his sympathy and humility, with the 35-year-old’s legacy secured due to his eponymous skill, the Zonderland (“a Swing forward with 5/4 twist on one arm through handstand and Healy to support”).\n\nAlthough his time in the sport is coming to an end – he plans to become a full-time doctor – Zonderland showed his mantle with World (2018) and European (2019) crowns in consecutive years and dreams of one final golden routine in Tokyo.\n\nKiril Lazarov (North Macedonia 🇲🇰, Handball)\n\nIf Macedonian handball has grown into a force to be reckoned in the Balkan region, where the sport enjoys tremendous tradition, talismanic sharpshooter Kiril Lazarov has a lot to do with it, as the long-time national team captain – and recently appointed national team coach – has been at the top of the game for close to two decades.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the best right backs in history, Lazarov’s whip of his prodigious left arm and bucketloads of goals have meant one and the same thing during a career littered with a stunning array of goalscoring exploits. The single-edition All-time best marks at both the European (61 goals, 2012) and World Championships (92 goals in 2012) belong to Lazarov, and he is also the top scorer in EHF Champions League history, with over 1300 tallies to his name, more than 250 clear of his closest competition.\n\nNorth Macedonia’s best ever athlete, the 41-year-old renewed his contract with French side HBC Nantes for another year to try to enlarge a trophy cabinet brimming with a count of League and National Cup medals from successful stints in Croatia, Hungary and Spain that already rivals his age.\n\nMagnus Carlsen (Norway 🇳🇴, Chess)\n\nIn a sport that throughout the centuries has marvelled at child prodigy’s aplenty, Magnus Carlsen’s trajectory has vaulted him past the moniker and into the stuff of legends through sheer consistency.\n\nA Grandmaster by age 13 and the youngest debutant in World Chess Championship history, Carlsen enlisted the legendary Garry Kasparov as a trainer in 2009 to help fast-track his ascent to the top of the FIDE World Rankings, a position he would ultimately assume at age 19, younger than all his predecessors.\n\nThat was his first step towards world dominance and the Norwegian has now been the top ranked player in the World for close to a decade – a period that his only surpassed by Kasparov – the reigning World Champion since 2013 and the man to reach the highest ever rating in history (2882), turning Carlsen into the undisputed face of chess.\n\nRenowned for his endgame prowess and for also excelling in the faster versions of the game, as his current world titles in the rapid and blitz variants attest, the 30-year-old’s skills show no signs of decline and he could continue to reign for years to come, furthering his case as the best player the sport has ever seen.\n\nAlexander Ovechkin (Russia 🇷🇺, Ice Hockey)\n\nThe Russian Tzar who has ruled in Washington for the last 15 years, Ovechkin was appointed as one of ice hockey’s shiniest lights from the moment he decided to cross the Atlantic ahead of his debut NHL season in 2005-06.\n\nThe first overall pick in the 2004 NHL Draft by the Washington Capitals, “Ovi” bested Canadian prodigy and career archnemesis Sidney Crosby for the Calder trophy, awarded to the rookie of the year, in what would be the first of the many individual distinctions that furnish his trophy cabinet. A three-time regular season MVP and record nine-times NHL top goal scorer, the 35-year-old captained the Capitals to their first Stanley Cup victory in 2018 and has already breezed past 700 goals in North America to remain on course to beat Wayne Gretzky’s record of 894 tallies.\n\nA committed member of the Russian National Team, Ovechkin has helped secure three World Championship titles, but he is still looking to plug the only significant gap on his resume, the Olympic medal that eluded him in three previous participations. He should get another crack at it next year in Beijing, yet the result will not change the fact his name is already entrenched in ice hockey’s and Russia’s pantheon of all-time greats.\n\nPart I – Introduction\n\nPart II – Women\n\nPart III – Domestic heroes\n\nPart IV – International Stars\n\nPart V – Global Icons\n\nThe first batch of men’s athletes and, as described in our introduction, a group of 12 featuring names that have probably failed to enter your radar unless you happen to follow their sports:\n\nArtur Aleksanyan (Armenia 🇦🇲, Greco-Roman Wrestling)\n\nThe most decorated Olympian of Independent Armenia, Aleksanyan upstages football star Henrik Mkhitaryan by virtue of his dominance on a sport where his nation is a powerhouse.\n\nThe Greco-Roman wrestler is a three-time World Champion (2014, 2015, 2017), and has captured five European titles to date (2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2020), but his best known for being the reigning Olympic Champion since 2016, when he climbed two steps from the third place obtained in London 2012.\n\nNicknamed the White Bear by his compatriots, the 29-year-old truly sets the standard of excellence in Armenia, having been named the country’s top athlete multiple times and flag bearer on the closing ceremony in Rio de Janeiro. The oddsmakers’ favourite for Tokyo, his legend will only continue to grow should he add more gold to his resume.\n\nRafael Aghayev (Azerbaijan 🇦🇿, Karate)\n\nOnce nicknamed the Diamond of the Karate World, Aghayev is considered by many the greatest karateka in history and a trailblazer in a sport that will make its long-awaited Olympic debut in Tokyo.\n\nA five-time World Champion and eleven-time European Champion in Kumite, Aghayev has always counterbalanced his average height and lesser reach with an explosiveness and tactical acumen that are still major assets at age 36 and against years of data and video his rivals can use to prepare for their clashes.\n\nA showman on the mat, provoking, teasing, and flashing a smile at opponents as he piles up the points, the Azeri punches, kicks and sweeps with a speed that electrifies martials arts crowds. And none are more knowledgeable and appreciative of it as the Japanese fans in front of which Aghayev will look to put the cherry on top of its glittering career with Olympic gold.\n\nPavlos Kontides (Cyprus 🇨🇾, Sailing)\n\nNamed as Cyprus’ finest athlete in seven of the last eight years, sailor Kontides cruises several miles ahead of any other athlete hailing from the Mediterranean nation, especially since the retirement in late 2019 of tennis player – and former Grand Slam Finalist – Marcos Baghdatis.\n\nThe first and only Olympic medallist in the country’s history, snatching silver in the Men’s Laser Class at the 2012 Olympics, the 30-year-old boasted his credentials with a couple of sensational seasons in 2017 and 2018, accumulating two consecutive World titles and a European crown (2018) on his way to the distinction as the 2018 World Sailor of the Year.\n\nNaturally tipped as one of the favourites ahead of the Tokyo Olympic Games, Kontides and his compatriots hold justified dreams of gold in Japan, an achievement that would echo Cyprus’ anthem on the Olympic stage for the first time.\n\nOtt Tanak (Estonia 🇪🇪, Rally Racing)\n\nThe man who once earned viral status for a dramatic escape after submerging his car in a lake during the 2015 Mexican Grand Prix has managed to change the conversation over the years, landing headlines for his achievements on the roads and driving such public interest in his homeland that he was the subject of a box-office hit in 2019.\n\n“Ott Tanak, the Movie” documented his unsuccessful attempt to become the 2018 World Champion, but both driver and fanbase would eventually get their due, with the 33-year-old completing his decade-long ascension the following season by grabbing six victories out of 13 races and finally hoisting the Championship trophy. The maiden Rally World Champion from Estonia interrupted the French monopoly on the WRC, which had been divvied up between Sébastien Loeb and Sébastien Ogier since 2004, and then stunned everyone with a move from Toyota to rivals Hyundai, a sign that Tanak’s appetite is still to be satisfied.\n\nIivo Niskanen (Finland 🇫🇮, Cross-country Skiing)\n\nHardened by dark wintery runs in the forests of Oulu in Northern Finland, Double Olympic Champion Iivo Niskanen has never hidden his fondness for going past the limits of pain, clocking over 900 hours of gruelling preparation every year to excel in the most pressure-heavy environments.\n\nYet to win a World Cup crystal globe in his career, the 29-year-old possesses a flair for the dramatic, having been voted as the Finnish Sports Personality of the Year in three occasions on the strength of his outstanding performances in selected moments. The first of those was the sprint event of the 2014 Sochi Olympics, where he claimed gold in surprising fashion, and another happened in Pyeongchang four years later, with Niskanen snatching the 50km mass start after a tense sprint finale.\n\nFor many skiers, Olympic glory would be the pinnacle, however Niskanen’s signature victory dates back to the 2017 World Championships contested in home soil. With all eyes on him, he lasered the energy of his favourite pump-up tune, Gonna Fly Now from the Rocky movies, to smash the field in the 15 km individual race, becoming the national star that Finland’s rich winter sports tradition requires.\n\nLasha Talakhadze (Georgia 🇬🇪, Weightlifting)\n\nOnly 27 years old, the Georgian star is well on the way to match his own weight in gold, courtesy of all the medals and world records he has amassed recently and that have spurred forward a sport plagued by doping scandals.\n\nThe 2016 Olympic Champion in the +105 kg (since 2018 reclassed for +109kg), superheavyweight weightlifter Lasha Talakhadze can stake a claim as the strongest athlete ever, having hit a 222kg snatch and clean & jerked 263 kg for a mind-blowing 485 kg total load at the 2021 European Championships. Owner of the four heaviest total lifts of all time across weight classes, Talakhadze has already set and improved two dozen world records, establishing himself as an athlete truly on a class of its own.\n\nNamed the IWF Men’s World Weightlifter of the Year after the last three seasons (2017-2019), Talakhadze already has four World Championship wins and five European titles to his name but, more than honours, what the Georgian is really chasing are new milestones for the sport. Including the mythical and long dreamed 500kg total load.\n\nFrancesco Friedrich (Germany 🇩🇪, Bobsleigh)\n\nThe world’s powerhouse when it comes to sliding sports, Germany has always produced its fair share of dominant figures, especially in luge and bobsleigh, yet Francesco Friedrich isn’t just another pick from the assembly line. He has always dreamed of usurping compatriot Andre Lange as the greatest bobsledder of all-time and, at age 31, he might already be just that.\n\nThe most successful slider in World Cup and World Championships history, “King Franz” was also the youngest pilot in history to conquer World Championship glory when he piloted the victorious two-man sled at the 2013 edition. Stunningly, both Germany and Friedrich would go bust at the 2014 Olympics, but that was the last time he left a major competition emptyhanded.\n\nAlso the captain of Germany’s leading four-man unit, Friedrich has swept each of the eight World titles awarded since 2017, giving him a record total of ten, and became a double gold medallist at the 2018 Winter Olympics when he drove his two-man sled (alongside breakman Thorsten Margis) to a dramatic last run tie with the Canadians. Dedicated and meticulous, Friedrich’s next challenge is extending his run of success until Beijing 2022, where he hopes to level Lange’s tally of four Olympic titles.\n\nBob Jungels (Luxembourg 🇱🇺, Road Cycling)\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Luxembourg might not incorporate enough land or population to ever be considered a sporting powerhouse, but it has managed to punch well above its weight on occasion, especially when it relates to cycling. The fifth nation in history with the most Tour de France winners (4), Luxembourg continues to churn out quality riders and the 28-year-old Jungels has been the standout in recent years, regularly bearing the country’s colours in the biggest races as a 12-time National Champion (6x Road Race, 6x Time Trial).\n\nA Grand Tour stage winner, former pink jersey holder and two-time top ten finisher at the Giro d’Italia (2016, 2017), Jungels’ signature triumph to date came in 2018 at the prestigious Liège-Bastogne-Liège, leading to his selection as Luxembourgish Sportsman of the Year. Contrary to some of his most famous compatriots, a major result at the iconic French stage race has eluded him so far, yet he still has time to achieve something that would truly etch his name in Luxembourg’s sports lore.\n\nDenis Vieru (Moldova 🇲🇩, Judo)\n\nWith a single Olympic medal secured during the XXI Century, the bronze of boxer Veaceslav Gojan in Beijing 2008, Moldova’s recent success at the international scale, even in popular sports such as weightlifting, wrestling and taekwondo has been sporadic at best.\n\nEnter judoka Denis Vieru, who might on course to change that on the strength of a sustained rise in the -66 Kg category. The Under-23 European Champion in 2016 at the age of 20, Vieru’s breakout season came in 2019, with several triumphs in Grand Prix events, a bronze medal at the World Championships, gold in the Summer Universiade and a stunning triumph on the illustrious Paris Grand Slam, one of the landmark events in the judo calendar.\n\nThird-best at the 2020 European Championships, the 25-year-old’s growing resumé puts him in the conversation for a podium appearance in Tokyo 2020 and maybe even at the highest step, something never achieved before by a Moldovan athlete.\n\nAleksandar Ivović (Montenegro 🇲🇪, Water Polo)\n\nArguably one of the best Water Polo players of the last decade, Aleksandar Ivovic’s resumé in Montenegro’s national sport is as decorated as it comes in terms of trophies, medals, and individual distinctions. Named the Best Player in the World in 2018, he is a two-time (2013, 2019) World Championships top scorer, a three-time LEN Champions League winner at club level with legendary Italian outfit Pro Recco, and an idol in Montenegro after leading the national team to a European title in 2008 and two World League victories (2009, 2018).\n\nHowever, what the 35-year-old cannot call himself is an Olympic medallist, and both athlete and country would love for that to change before the 2015 and 2016 Montenegro Athlete of the Year rides into the sunset. After dramatic fourth place finishes in 2008, 2012 and 2016, the center-back will look to cap an extraordinary career with success in Tokyo 2020, potentially delivering what would be just the second medal in Montenegro’s Olympic history.\n\nTaha Akgul (Turkey 🇹🇷, Freestyle Wrestling)\n\nThe reigning Olympic Champion in the 125kg category, Taha Akgul hails from Sivas, one of Turkey’s hotbeds when it comes to world class wrestlers. Educated at home in the fundamentals of the sport since early age, Akgul followed on the footsteps of former Olympic and World Champions such as Hamza Yerlikaya and Ahmet Ayik, and as the two-time World Champion confirmed his favouritism in Rio 2016 to collect his nation’s only gold medal in the final days of the Games, his place as a leading sports figure amongst the Turks was sealed.\n\nFamed for his feverish dedication to his craft, refusal to take any vacation time over the last decade, and for maintaining the same modest lifestyle as before all the accolades, the seven-time European Champion feels he cannot afford to let his guard down ahead of his much-awaited title defence in Tokyo and for good reason. He will once again shoulder the hopes of a massive nation and there is also danger laying in the challenge posed by Georgian rival Geno Petriashvilli, who has shared top honours with Akgul in recent years.\n\nOleksandr Usyk (Ukraine 🇺🇦, Boxing)\n\nA former European, World and Olympic heavyweight Champion (2012) as an amateur boxer, amassing a stellar record of 335 wins and just 15 losses in the process, Oleksander Usyk’s profile has grown significantly since he turned professional in 2013, and emerged as one of the most successful pound-for-pound boxers in the World and a star in his native Ukraine.\n\nWalking the trail blazed by, among others, the Klitchko brothers, the 34-year-old has gone undefeated in his first 18 professional bouts, winning the undisputed cruiserweight championship in 2018 to become just the fourth boxer in history to simultaneously hold the titles attributed by the four major boxing organizations, the WBA, WBC, IBF, and WBO. Named the Best Boxer of 2018 by most dedicated publications, Usyk, who shares a birthday with the great Muhammad Ali, decided to vacate his titles to move up to heavyweight status, where he is beefing up for the biggest paid duel of his career, a mandatory fight with the WBO Heavyweight Champion Anthony Joshua.\n\nPart I – Introduction\n\nPart II – Women\n\nPart III – Domestic heroes\n\nPart IV – International Stars\n\nPart V – Global Icons\n\nOrdered by alphabetical order of the country’s name, here are the first 11 names on the list:\n\nLuiza Gega (Albania 🇦🇱 , Athletics)\n\nOne of just two European non-microstates to never win an Olympic medal, Albania’s deep structural issues when it comes to sports funding are exemplified in the career misadventures of the first and only Albanian athlete to medal at an Athletics European Championships.\n\nA military police officer by day and Albania’s closest approximation of an Olympic medal contender by night, Gega was forced to move away from the capital Tirana soon after her greatest feat, the second place in the 3000m steeplechase at the 2016 European Championships, so that she could find a all-weather running track to train ahead of the Rio Olympics. The country’s flag bearer in the opening ceremony, she could not qualify for the final but has been knocking on the elite for a while, finishing inside the top ten at the 2019 World Championships.\n\nNamed the European Athlete of the Month in January 2020, also a first for an Albanian, the 32-year-old would need a lights-out performance to reach the Olympic podium in Tokyo and rewrite Albanian sport’s history. Unlikely, but not the strangest of outcomes in these craziest of times.\n\nVictoria Azarenka (Belarus 🇧🇾 , Tennis)\n\nDespite residing in the USA since age 15, Vika’s connection to her nation never wavered even as she became one of the most recognizable tennis players of this century. A trailblazer of the country’s transformation into a respected force in women’s tennis, Azarenka’s brilliance was at its absolute peak between 2011 and 2013, when she regularly outduelled global superstars Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova to capture two Grand Slam titles at the Australian Open (2012,2013), became the first Belarussian tennis player to be ranked No.1 in the World (2012) and claimed a pair of Olympic medals in London 2012 – gold in mixed doubles alongside Max Mirnyi, and bronze in singles.\n\nSuch run of success only found parallel amongst Belarussian athletes on the biathlon exploits of four-time Olympic Champion Darya Domracheva, but would be halted by a mix of injury problems and off-court issues. Struggling for form after giving birth and later dragged into an ugly child custody feud, Azarenka’s career bottomed out before resurging in 2020, with the 31-year-old reaching a third career US Open Final last September. Hopefully, that is a sign of more to come as she plans to resume a leading role in the WTA Tour, add more titles to what is – already – a Hall of Fame worthy career, and continue to make the people of Belarus proud.\n\nNafissatou Thiam (Belgium 🇧🇪 , Athletics)\n\nThe 2017 IAAF World Athlete of the Year fends off strong competitions, namely two-time World Champion gymnast Nina Derwael, on the strength of her multi-faceted prowess on the track and field. The reigning Olympic Champion in the heptathlon, the event which requires athletes to excel in seven different disciplines, Thiam has been a mainstay since her spectacular breakthrough in Rio, picking up the title at the 2017 World Championships to become the first Belgium athlete to achieve gold in the world even, and the European crown the following season.\n\nThird on the female heptathlon all-time list after breaking the mythical 7000 point-barrier in 2017, the 26-year-old is also a national record holder in the javelin throw and long jump, and a three-time Belgium Sportswoman of the Year. Pipped by Katarina Johnson-Thompson at the 2019 World Championships, she will try to upend the Brit in one of the must-watch duels of the next Olympic Games.\n\nSandra Perkovic (Croatia 🇭🇷 , Athletics)\n\nOne of the most dominant presences throughout the last decade of track and field meetings, the eight-time Croatian Sportswoman of the Year has gained the right to rub shoulders with legendary skier Janica Kostelic for the distinction as the most successful individual athlete in the history of independent Croatia.\n\nA charismatic personality on and off the field, whose political convictions led to a short stint as a member of the Croatian Parliament, the “Discus Queen” broke new ground by becoming the first athlete to win an European Championships event in five occasions, yet her proudest possesssions have been claimed on the world stage, with two World titles (2013, 2017) complementing a couple of Olympic gold medals (2012, 2016).\n\nStill the only woman to vault the plate past the 71m mark in almost 30 years, Perkovic’s rivals have drawn closer over the last couple of years as she prepares to tackle the crowning achievement of her career: a triumph in Tokyo would leave her as the first woman to win three Olympic gold medals in throwing events and enshrine the Croatian amongst the greatest track and field athletes ever.\n\nKatinka Hosszú (Hungary 🇭🇺 , Swimming)\n\nA four-time winner of FINA’s Swimmer of the Year Award, Hosszu is swimming’s serial medal winner and, to her competitors’ dismay, shows no signs of slowing down even as she draws into her early 30’s.\n\nThe world record holder in all the individual medley events and a three-time Olympic Champion, Hungary’s “Iron Lady” has amassed close to 100 podiums in major European and World meetings and more than 300 (!) in World Cup events, a tally only made possible by to her voracious appetite for victories and self-improvement. Regularly competing in multiple races a day to maximize her time against the world’s best, Hosszu takes full advantage of her prowess in all four swimming strokes to rack up the accomplishments, prize money and recognition she has learned to leverage in unique fashion.\n\nIn fact, the charismatic seven-time Hungarian Sportswoman of the Year has revolutionized the image of swimming icons away from the pool, venturing into the business world by exploring the “Iron Lady” and “Iron Nation” trademarked brands that extended her reach into books, meals, or apparel, developing “Iron Aquatics”, a world-class training program, and founding Team Iron, a member of the novel International Swimming League she helped come into fruition.\n\nSara Björk Gunnarsdóttir (Iceland 🇮🇸 , Football)\n\nSeveral years before the footballing world was thunderstruck by the throng of bearded men hailing from the north-western reaches of Europe, history was made in 2009, when a pioneering group of ladies became the first Icelandic national team to play at a major football tournament. Center stage to that achievement was a 19-year-old girl bearing the same last name as the country’s greatest musical export, but who has since emerged as a star of her own, climbing the sport’s ladder with the same fiery resilience she displays battling the best midfielders in the female game.\n\nHeartbeat, captain and most capped player in Iceland’s football history, Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir’s accomplishments are incommensurate to any of her compatriots across the vast sporting landscape, amassing two quadruples of league titles in Sweden (Rosengård) and Germany (VfL Wolfsburg) over the last decade on the runway to the crowning performance of her career at the 2020 Champions League Final.\n\nPulling the strings for star-studded Olympique Lyon just a few weeks after a dream transfer, the 30-year-old potted the insurance marker in a 3-1 victory over her former Wolfsburg teammates to become the first Icelandic footballer to win Europe’s showpiece club competition and cement her legend amongst the greatest athletes ever forged in the land of fire and ice.\n\nFederica Pellegrini (Italy 🇮🇹 , Swimming)\n\nThe youngest Italian athlete to win an Olympic medal in an individual event, Federica Pellegrini has now spent half of her life as one of the most recognizable faces in the Swimming World.\n\nSilver medallist in Athens 2004 as a 16-year-old debutant and crowned Olympic Champion four years later, Fede’s transformation into a national sensation culminated on her breath-taking displays at the 2009 World Championships held in Rome, where she took gold in the 200 and 400m freestyle races in world record times (the former still stands).\n\nNamed the 2009 World Swimmer of the Year for her excellence in home waters, Pellegrini’s exceptional longevity and heroics in her signature event, the 200m freestyle, have become the stuff of legends, as she continually defies the odds to best younger rivals in international meets. The first woman to hand American prodigy Katie Ledecky an individual major international defeat at the 2017 Worlds, “Fede” renewed her 200m title in Gwangju two years later to become the only swimmer − male or female − to have won eight medals in a row in the same event at the World Championships. Going into her fifth – and predictably – last Olympic appearance, the 32-year-old has desires for a final masterpiece in Tokyo, where she will once again face an incredibly stacked field.\n\nMajlinda Kelmendi (Kosovo 🇽🇰 , Judo)\n\nThe youngest independent state in Europe gained the upper hand over fellow Balkan countries Albania and Bosnia – who have yet to win an Olympic medal – courtesy of Majlinda Kelmendi, Kosovo’s golden girl.\n\nThe 2016 Olympic Champion in the women’s -52 Kg, Kelmendi’s debut on the Olympic stage happened four years earlier, competing under the Albanian flag – where her ethnic roots lay – as Kosovo’s participation was denied by the IOC. Showered with offers to train and represent other nations afterwards, the judoka decided to stay put, being rewarded the following year as she conquered her first World title.\n\nThe first Kosovar athlete in any sport to become a World Champion, a feat she would emulate in 2014, the 30-year-old is also a four-time European Champion and, more importantly, the sporting hero of a whole nation, which celebrated her by erecting a statue in Majlinda’s hometown of Peje last year.\n\nLaura Asadauskaitė (Lithuania 🇱🇹 , Modern Pentathlon)\n\nLaura Asadauskaitė, or Asadauskaitė-Zadneprovskienė by marriage, is not only one of the longest-named athletes on this list, but also one of the oldest and most accomplished.\n\nAn Olympic Champion back in London 2012, a mere couple of years after giving birth, the modern pentathlon legend is, against all odds, still the athlete to beat at age 37, continuing to excel in the all-around discipline which comprises swimming, fencing, equestrian show jumping, pistol shooting and running stages.\n\nAn eight-time European Champion, between individual, relay and team events, and 2013 World Champion in the women’s individual competition, Asadauskaitė holds the world record for the highest individual score in the sport’s history, the 1417 points obtained in Rome in 2016, and it is still renowned for inflicting most of her damage in the final leg of the pentathlon, the Laser Run, regularly dashing past opponents with the finishing line in sight.\n\nNamed the Lithuanian Sportswoman of the Year in 2011, 2015 and again in 2019, following her most recent European crown, Asadauskaitė’s upcoming Olympic participation, her fourth, offers a great opportunity to erase the sting of 2016, when her title defence fell through after a disastrous equestrian segment.\n\nSimona Halep (Romania 🇷🇴 , Tennis)\n\nThe first Romanian tennis player to be ranked No.1 in the World, Halep has been a mainstay on the WTA Top 10 since 2014, emerging as the face of Romanian sport after finishing as the year-end WTA Tour leader in 2017 and 2018.\n\nAn aggressive baseliner who lacks the disruptive power of some of her rivals yet can counterpunch with the best, Halep’s career progress has been indelibly connected to Roland Garros, the mecca of her favourite playing surface, clay. The singles’ junior Champion back in 2008, she reached her first Grand Slam final at senior level in Paris six years later, losing to Maria Sharapova, and finally broke through with her maiden Major triumph there in 2018.\n\nWelcomed back to Bucharest by thousands of compatriots after that victory, Halep is a five-time Grand Slam finalist who has reached the semi-final stage or best in all four of tennis showpiece events and grabbed a second Major title in grass, defeating heavy favourite Serena Williams at the 2019 Wimbledon Final. Named multiple times for the WTA’s Most Popular and Fan Favourite distinctions, the 29-year-old will head to tennis’ Hall of Fame one day having cemented her status as one of the most consistent and successful performers in women’s tennis over the last decade.\n\nAlessandra Perilli (San Marino 🇸🇲 , Shooting)\n\nThe greatest hope to break San Marino’s all-time goose egg when it comes to Olympic medals, Alessandra Perilli has come woefully close to the dream before. The odd woman out of a three-way shootout for silver in London 2012, she had to settle for an unfortunate 4th place, her aspirations and those of 33k compatriots dashed at the sight of an unscathed clay dish.\n\nHailing from a country with limited representation at international level, Alessandra, who followed on the footsteps of older sister Arianna, is a multiple-time winner in World Cup events and gold medallist at the 2015 Trap shooting World Cup Final. The driving force in two of the three medals her country has racked at World Championship level, leading the women’s team that took bronze in 2009 and 2010, the 33-year-old has been one of the world’s best target shooters for a long time and will arrive in Tokyo at the top of the world rankings and, naturally, as one of the favourites. Were she to make the blue-white flag flutter in a podium ceremony, a celebration for the ages awaits her in the streets of San Marino City.\n\nPart I – Introduction\n\nPart II – Women\n\nPart III – Domestic heroes\n\nPart IV – International Stars\n\nPart V – Global Icons\n\nEurope, the cradle of Western Civilization and springboard for all the major economic, cultural and social leaps that have shaped the world we live in today, has also been at the forefront of the evolution of what we call sport throughout the centuries. The Romans and Greek were already involved in rudimentary forms of entertaining and exercise that with time spawn into organized sports and all the world’s most popular sports have emerged in the old Continent.\n\nThis historical background has contributed to the rich tapestry of sports practiced at all levels across the continent, to the amazing diversity, popularity and traditions that have cropped up from it and to the role sports and elite athletes play as ambassadors of their nations around the world. With their success, influence, and prestige, they not only bring fame and recognition to the lands they hail from but are also a major source of pride and inspiration to the people they represent, a piece of national identity that can reach far-flung places faster and more effectively than any well-funded PR campaign.\n\nStill, as much as Europe is the continent of Cristiano Ronaldo or Roger Federer, whose names have grown to almost eclipse their countries the world over, it is inconceivable to think every territory will have the fortune to produce a sport megastar of such magnitude. There are simply too many variables and discrepancies at play to expect any kind of fair and equitable distribution of talent and physical greatness, but there are no such limitations when it comes to assigning a spotlight. And that is what these series is about.\n\nThe Greatest Athletes in Europe is not meant to be a simple list of the most famous athletes born in the continent. Or the wealthiest. Or even the most decorated. In truth, you will find most of the names you are expecting here, as those factors were taken into account, but we added an important caveat to the proceedings. We want the best and the greatest, yes, yet we also want to band the continent together, and therefore each country gets its own representative on this celebration of the outstanding medley that is Sport in Europe.\n\nIt sounds easy enough, no? 1 athlete per country, selected according to a series of factors we will highlight in a bit. But first, a more pressing question. What are the limits of the continent and how many countries are part of Europe?\n\nShould we consider the transcontinental nations that straddle Europe and Asia like Turkey or Russia? Definitely. The Caucasus region? Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia share strong historical and cultural ties with Europe, so they are in. The Microstates, such as Vatican City, San Marino or Monaco? As long as they have a National Olympic Committee…which Vatican does not, so it’s out.\n\nAnd that leaves only two more on the brink, Kazakhstan, and Israel. Two countries that have been accepted and integrated by many of the continent’s sports federations, but culturally and geographically are clearly a part of Asia. I went back and forth here, but eventually decided to exclude them. Call me lazy if you want, however dropping two still makes it 49 countries and athletes to profile. After further weighing the merits of contending athletes, I trimmed it to a final number of 46, excluding Andorra, Liechtenstein and Malta, who are currently lacking deserving nominees.\n\nGeographical boundaries defined, on to a few more ground rules.\n\nRegarding eligibility, it is quite straightforward: to be considered, athletes need to be active – sorry, Liechtenstein 😦 – competing at an international level and representing one of the European countries. They do not need to be born in said nation though, so naturalized citizens were contemplated. Stay tuned to see if any got picked.\n\nAs for the selection criteria, well, it is mightily complicated. Arguably there is not an objective way to compare across multiple sports, so I had to tap into my own knowledge of the wider sports landscape and dive headfirst into research to reach a decision on the many close calls you might recognize as you make your way through the series.\n\nHowever, I will do my best to explain some of the factors that were considered:\n\nInternational Success: Obvious, but still open to different judgements. What is more important, a World Championship triumph or three European titles? A medal at the Olympics or several years of international relevance without the Olympic cherry on top? What about athletes from non-Olympic sports or that have never participated because of injuries or other commitments?\n\nIn the end, the Olympics are the rarer event, the pinnacle in terms of media attention and the platform where heroes are instantaneously forged, so triumphs at such stage are crucial even if not required.\n\nWorldwide Sports Relevancy: By virtue of the sport they play, football players are amongst the most prominent people in every European country, and that helps them stand out when such exercise is made. Still, let us not forget that there is also more competition to reach the highest levels as more people get involved. The same applies, albeit in a lower scale, to tennis or basketball so athletes from higher profile sports get a boost here.\n\nNevertheless, this is not meant to imply Montenegro’s leading football star is guaranteed a spot. Or that the 100th best basketball player in the world is supplanting a World Champion in rowing or a ten-time European Champion in Karate.\n\nSports tradition in the country: Some sports are more popular than others in different geographies. A wrestler snatching Olympic gold for Germany will never achieve the same status as a rival from wrestling-mad Turkey or Azerbaijan who reaches the same heights. Ice hockey players are rock stars in Finland, basketball players the idols of kids in Greece and speed skaters more respected in the Netherlands than anywhere else. Athlete’s achievements can lift a specific sports’ profile out of the shadow in a territory, but tradition is a factor to consider.\n\nIndividual placement in the world rankings: Being a highly-ranked athlete in the world is important, and can propel a name above a more famous personality from another sport that is rated significantly lower on the established order (even if such order isn’t scientifical, but purely fanciful as happens in team sports)\n\nRecent success: If athlete A was a world beater ten years ago and boasts a decorated resume yet is clearly over the hill, whereas athlete B is younger but already the reigning Olympic Champion, we might take athlete B.\n\nLegacy: Yes, recent success is weighed more heavily, but dominance, world records, piles of silverware, all the good stuff that creates legends is important. Old guys or veterans going through slumps will not be discarded simply because they are not at their peak performance level.\n\nFame: We need to account for the marketability of athletes provided it is tied to elite performance. Fairly or not, an NBA superstar is a bigger draw than a two-time Olympic Champion in Shooting.\n\nGenre distribution: When all the rest proves too close to call, I am taking a woman over a man. Not just to balance out the group a little bit, but also because women’s sports are underfunded and underpromoted, knocking ladies down a few rungs in some of the other categories (fame, for instance, but not only).\n\nA whole lot to deliberate on, eventually leading to the distribution by sport that is presented below:\n\nA few quick takeaways from this exercise:\n\n23 different sports manage to sneak into the list, which more than an indictment of my superior and comprehensive sports expertise, is a testament to the breadth of talent and diversity Europe can offer. Additionally, this is a number I am confident could not be matched by any other continent were this exercise replicated.\n\nFair to say no one was shocked by the top 2, even if most would expect the positions to be flipped. Football is massive everywhere, but if you think about it, there are not that many European players that distinguish themselves enough from the pack to be no-brainers.\n\nOn the other hand, the epicentre of men’s tennis has shifted to Europe over the last two decades, and the fallout is felt beyond the obvious inclusions of the Big Three. Meanwhile, the female game has been at the forefront of equality calls for a long time, with women players achieving levels of notoriety their peers from other sports can only dream of.\n\nJudo closing out the podium above Basketball and Athletics might raise eyebrows, especially if we remember it is a sport whose origins lay in Japan. However, it is the most widely practiced combat sport with elite athletes spread across the continent that were bound to come up for discussion in many locations.\n\nThere was leeway for a push here and there, but I was surprised that more swimmers or cyclists didn’t force their way onto the list.\n\nThe number of non-Olympic sports represented is three: chess and the two motorsports, Rally Racing and Formula 1. Karate would make it four, but it is an addition to the program of Tokyo 2020.\n\nAs for the distribution by gender, it is as follows:\n\nSo, just short of 25% of female representation or half of what you would expect in a world of identical opportunities. Hopefully, these numbers trend in the right direction in the coming years. Athletics (3), Tennis (2) and Swimming (2), not incidentally all sports where men and women regularly share venues, appointments and attention, factor more than once.\n\nA couple of final notes before we get to know the chosen ones. This is an Olympic Year, many of these professionals will compete in Tokyo – a few will even carry their countries’ flags in the Opening Ceremony – and the results they obtain there will shape their legacy and reputation. That is why you will find multiple references to what is at stake at the coming Olympics for these individuals and why a natural change of the guard will occur when this Olympic cycle is completed.\n\nFor matters of simplicity and ease of access, the unveiling of the names will occur in four parts (II to V), with the 11 women coming up first and the men divided into three groups whose composition, it should be stressed, has less to do with their relative merits and more with what I assume would be the overall recognition levels amongst the masses. On the first group, we will discover more under-the-radar athletes who even this writer might have been unaware off, and we will make our way up to the heavyweight division, which comprises worldwide stars most non-sports folk should be able to recognize.\n\nFinally, the VI and concluding part will provide a bit of clarity on some of the closest verdicts I endured, pointing out names that missed the cut for some reason, discussing the countries that shone for the range of notable options available and those that disappointed for the lack of a clear choice.\n\nOk, roll the red carpet, turn on the floodlights and welcome the Greatest Athletes of Europe*\n\n*As of June 2021\n\nQuick Links:\n\nPart I – Introduction\n\nPart II – Women\n\nPart III – Domestic heroes\n\nPart IV – International Stars\n\nPart V – Global Icons\n\nIf you have yet to read the previous post on my experience at the 2018 IIHF World Championship, click here.\n\nAs you might already know, I was bunked in Copenhagen for the 2018 IIHF World Championship. And even though I only watched a handful of matches in full, parts of a few more and barely anything that went down in Herning, I still want to collect a few takeaways from the tournament and each team I followed. Without further ado:\n\nAustria\n\nImmediately demoted following every previous top division appearance, the Austrians arrived in Copenhagen with a single goal in mind: avoid relegation at all costs. An achievement unlocked with flying colours after their resounding 4-0 triumph over Belarus in a do-or-die situation and, impressively, just 24 hours after a traumatic 2-5 loss against fellow relegation fodder France. It’s true that way back in their tournament opener Austria had surprisingly forced Switzerland to play overtime, escalating internal expectations, but more couldn’t have been asked from a team missing star forwards Thomas Vanek and Michael Grabner.\n\nEventually Philadelphia’s Michael Raffl showed up to infuse some NHL skill into the lineup, notching two eye-popping goals against the Czech and four in total, while veteran goalie Bernhard Starkbaum (91.79 Sv%, 2.72 GAA) authored some of the most spectacular desperation saves in the tournament, nonetheless the Austrian’s 14th place in the final standings is generally representative of their potential.\n\nBelarus\n\nA team in transition now that the Kostitsyn brothers and Mikhail Grabovski are being phased out, not many expected the Belarussians to bother the big nations like they’ve done at times in the past, yet their Danish nightmare went way deeper than that. Thrashed by France (6-2) between expected routs from Sweden and Russia, five days into the competition coach Dave Lewis was relieved off his duties, however the move didn’t rally the troops and the results continued to go from bad to worse, with that embarrassing defeat to Austria sealing their first relegation since 2003.\n\nMadly inept in front of the goal, Belarus only scored 8 times in 7 games and half of those came in a washed out finale against Slovakia, where they provided their faithful with some semblance of hope, turning a 0-2 into a 4-3, before surrendering 4 straight Slovakian markers. Disastrous.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nThere was so much to like about Czech Republic’s performance in Copenhagen, so much promise, and they still headed home empty handed for the sixth consecutive year. Pushing the Swedes like few others did, and defeating Russia in a thriller, the Czech’s group prospects were eventually undone by the crucial points dropped in those early overtime encounters against Switzerland and Slovakia, forcing an extra trip to Herning and an unpredictable quarter-final with the USA decided by Patrick Kane’s genius.\n\nStill, another last-eight exit couldn’t overshadow the confirmation of Pavel Francouz as one of Europe’s best goalies and a smart pickup by the Colorado Avalanche nor the heady play of a relatively anonymous blueline, where Detroit’s prospects Filip Hronek (20-year-old) and Libor Šulák (24) as well as newly-signed Montreal Canadien David Sklenička (21) shone. Moreover, up front, beyond the boost provide by David Pastrňák and David Krejčí, there was a lot to get Carolina Hurricanes’ fans excited about Martin Nečas (19), Vegas fans expectant about what Tomáš Hyka (25) can do in a bigger NHL spell and confidence-building performances by Dmitrij Jaškin(25) or Dominik Kubalík (22). After some bare years, the Czech revolution is underway and it’s a just a matter of time before they barge into the podium again. And how sweet looks the prospect of doing it in Slovakia next year?\n\nFrance\n\nAfter threatening to reach the quarters last year in Paris, there were natural aspirations regarding a possible second ever top-eight (2014) finish for France, however, despite a positive tournament, they never got particularly close. Hammered by Russia (0-7) in the first day, Les Bleus rebounded to handily best direct rivals Belarus (6-2) and Austria (5-2), yet they would have liked to cause more problems to the Czech (0-6) or the Swiss (1-5).\n\nTaking into account that their two best forwards, Pierre-Édouard Bellemare and Antoine Roussel, didn’t don the sweater, Cristobal Huet is history, and the lack of alternatives to long-time mainstays such as Damien Fleury or the da Costa brothers is an inescapable reality, securing a 12th consecutive top division appearance in 2019 was not only an accomplishment but a nice way to bid adieu to retiring coach Dave Henderson.\n\nRussia\n\nAs I see it, you can evaluate Russia’s performance under two distinct prisms: they were without their five best players (Malkin, Kucherov, Tarasenko, Kuznetsov, Ovechkin) but still clinched second place in the group before falling in an hard-fought QF against Canada, which is obviously no shame and therefore qualifies Ilya Vorobyov’s first competition in charge as satisfactory. Or you could state that the Olympic Champions (…) dropped a winnable match against the Czech, were squarely beaten by Sweden and, once again, faltered in the moment of truth in a tournament they weren’t overwhelming favourites…\n\nNot sure which option was favoured by Russian media, so I’ll just skip ahead and note that young Kirill Kaprizov put together another star-making performance in the international limelight, netting 6 goals in 8 games (Patience, Wild fans, exert patience), and together with Nikita Gusev and Pavel Datsyuk rekindled the magic of Pyeongchang to form the most dominant line seen in Copenhagen. Want another KHL player to keep tabs on? SKA St. Petersburg’s Alexander Barabanov, a skilled 23-year-old, bottom-six winger who posted 4 goals and 4 assists to turn scout’s heads aplenty.\n\nSlovakia\n\nJust like their neighbours, Slovakia hasn’t medalled since 2012. Unlike the Czech, it’s difficult to anticipate that streak will be broken soon. Sure, the 9th place obtained in Denmark is an improvement over the disastrous 14th of 2017, but that shouldn’t be the standard for one of hockey’s traditional nations, which ought to get into the last eight regularly. Pipped to fourth place in Group A by virtue of a 0-2 defeat to the Swiss, the Slovaks showed fighting spirit against Sweden and the Czechs, failing both times in overtime, yet their well-documented struggles in graduating fresh blood into the national team setup were front and centre once again.\n\nGoalie Marek Čiliak played decently, especially against the Czech, but he didn’t steal a game, the Slovak defence was still anchored by veteran Andrej Sekera – though it was nice to see draft-eligible Martin Fehérvary getting a test run – and the attack paced by the everlasting Ladislav Nagy, who posted 10 pts (5 against Belarus) as a 39-year-old top-line winger. With just two NHL players amongst their ranks (defenseman Christián Jaroš, from Ottawa, was the other), at least the tournament gave Tomáš Jurčo (4 goals) a chance to display some signs of life, with his raw skill sticking out from the mob.\n\nSweden\n\nPreliminary round success in international play is a patented Swedish tradition and they delivered. After that, things naturally get trickier, but buoyed by the yellow wave that invaded Royal Arena, the Tre Kronor surfed high expectations in Copenhagen to end up seizing a second consecutive world title. Not that the Swedes were always overwhelming – Latvia, Slovakia and Switzerland can attest to that – however they managed to keep their nerve while trailing, continuing to pummel the opposition until they found a way to retake control of the proceedings.\n\nAnd it helped, obviously, that their roster was brimming with established NHL talent and experience, headlined by the best defence corps in the tournament (Larsson, Ekman Larsson, Klingberg and Lindholm is a sick top-four) and a top forward line that clicked immediately, as Mattias Janmark (10 pts) managed to keep pace with Mika Zibanejad and Rikard Rakell (6 goals each). In any case, if that wasn’t enough firepower for opponents to deal with, Mattias Ekholm, Viktor Arvidsson, Filip Forsberg and Patric Hörnqvist soon disembarked directly from North America just to exacerbate the problem, and their supposed Achilles heel, the goaltending position, sorted itself out as Anders Nilsson ousted Magnus Hellberg’s competition before running away with Media All-Star honours (95.4, 1.09, 3 SO)..and the Cup.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nWho would have thought the same Swiss team that struggled to squeak past Austria in their opener would eventually shock the hockey world two weeks later? In fact, not just once, which can be attributed to luck, but almost three straight times in a span of four days, upsetting established hockey nations with relentless team effort and discipline. Looking back though, the turning point for the Swiss might have been that tough back-to-back against Russia and Sweden (12/13 of May), when their battle level wasn’t enough to erase deficits but inspired belief.\n\nAfterwards, the Swiss stomped France to book a place in the QF, raided Finland in a four-minute second period blitz, and built a Cinderella story that deserved a happy ending. It wasn’t meant to be, nonetheless Switzerland paved the road to success for mid-level nations: extract tremendous contributions from your NHL players (Timo Meier, Nino Niederreiter and Sven Andrighetto notched a point per game, Mirco Mueller stepped up in the medal round, late-arrivals Kevin Fiala and Roman Josi added a new dimension), ride a hot goalkeeper (Leonardo Genoni was immense vs Canada and Sweden) and – not least – unearth a few hidden gems along the way. For the Swiss, that was synonymous with defenseman Ramon Untersander (3 goals, 7 points), sneaky forward Gregory Hofmann (4 goals) and the tournament’s revelation, Enzo Corvi, the 25-year-old HC Davos center who rode shotgun with Niederreiter and scored a beauty of an overtime winner against Austria.\n\nCanada\n\nConnor McDavid is unlikely to be available for the Worlds for much of the next 15 years (right, Edmonton?) and the Canadians, to put it simple, blew away a great opportunity to level Russia’s (including Soviet Union) record tally of 27 gold medals in the competition. Evidently not due to the young phenomenon’s efforts, since he piled up the points (17 in 10 matches), scored an hat-trick on the Norwegians and an overtime winner that avoided embarrassment versus Latvia, but it’s still a fact that McDavid didn’t exactly rip the opposition to shreds in the playoff round. This in spite of the three assists against Russia, followed up by a frustrating match versus the Swiss, and the disappearing act in the team’s putrid effort on a bronze medal contest that epitomized Canada’s tournament, one with more valleys than peaks.\n\nStill, positive grades go out to Aaron Ekblad and Colton Parayko (that cannon of a shot is a sight to behold) and all the question marks are reserved for Canada’s entire goaltending situation: a tandem of Darcy Kuemper (awful performance) and Curtis McElhinney (serviceable…)? No comments. Except we’ll take the time to report the name of Canada’s third string goalie: Michael Di Pietro. Who?\n\nLatvia\n\nWhy, Latvia? Who allowed you free reign to destroy our beautiful dream, a Sweden-Denmark quarter-final? I’ll only forgive you because Latvian hockey fans are awesome and your goalies have a penchant for creating chaos. How else can we explain the fact unheralded Kristers Gudļevskis put a scare into the Canadian hearts again? Or that Elvis Merzļikins – great name, greater numbers (94.04 Sv%, 1.50 GAA, 2 SO) – shut down Denmark, forced the USA to OT and came pretty close from doing the same to the almighty Swedes?\n\nUSA\n\nFor once the Americans didn’t tank a bronze medal game!
