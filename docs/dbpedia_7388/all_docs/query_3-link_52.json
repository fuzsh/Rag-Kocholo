        "text": "The Olympic Sailing competitions in Marseille faced delays once again yesterday as the Medal Races for the Mixed Multihull and Mixed Dinghy were postponed due to a lack of wind. However, the events that did take place provided plenty of excitement and historical achievements.\n\nWomen’s Dinghy: Bouwmeester Secures Historic Gold\n\nMarit Bouwmeester of the Netherlands clinched her second Olympic gold in the Women’s Dinghy, solidifying her status as the most successful female sailor in Olympic history. Despite having already secured gold after consistent top-five finishes in the Opening Series, persistent light wind delayed her victory lap.\n\nBouwmeester, who now holds two golds, a silver, and a bronze from four Olympics, crossed the line fourth in the Medal Race. Denmark’s Anne-Marie Rindom took silver, and Norway’s Line Flem Hoest captured bronze.\n\nBouwmeester reflected on her achievement, “In the build-up to the Medal Race, I tried to stay focused, but being a mum as well, I had to be there for Jessie Mae. It’s nice to finally finish it off, it hasn’t sunk in yet.”\n\nRindom added, “It’s huge just to get to an Olympic Games, so to secure a medal is amazing. It’s been nerve-wracking, but I kept fighting right to the end.”\n\nMen’s Dinghy: Wearn Defends His Title\n\nAustralia’s Matt Wearn successfully defended his Olympic title in the Men’s Dinghy with a decisive performance in the Medal Race. Holding a 14-point lead, Wearn executed a brilliant race strategy to secure gold, extending Australia’s dominance in the event with their fourth consecutive Olympic gold.\n\nCyprus’ Pavlos Kontides took silver, echoing his London 2012 success, while Peru’s Stefano Peschiera earned a historic bronze, marking Peru’s first Olympic medal in 32 years.\n\nWearn expressed his relief and joy, “The last three years have been an up-and-down ride, but we kept ticking boxes. It’s been quite hard to deal with the waiting at times, luckily we didn’t have to wait for another day and now we can celebrate.”\n\nKontides shared his emotions, “I’m over the moon. A second Olympic medal for my country, and it came from myself.”\n\nFormula Kite: Medal Series Line-Up Set\n\nDue to light wind, no Formula Kite races took place, leaving the standings unchanged heading into the Medal Series. The top ten athletes from both the men’s and women’s sides will compete in the Semi-Finals, divided into two groups of four. The top overall seeds, Slovenia’s Toni Vodisek for the men and France’s Lauriane Nolot for the women, will start the Final with two wins each.\n\nMixed Multihull and Mixed Dinghy: Medal Races Await\n\nThe Mixed Multihull and Mixed Dinghy Medal Races were postponed due to the lack of wind, setting the stage for a high-stakes showdown once conditions permit.\n\nItaly’s Ruggero Tita and Caterina Banti lead the Mixed Multihull standings, while Austria’s Lara Vadlau and Lukas Maehr top the Mixed Dinghy rankings. Competitors will have to wait for favourable winds to determine the final medalists.\n\nKeep up to date with all our Olympic Sailing 2024 coverage.\n\nYou can find all the Olympic sailing results at the World Sailing Olympic results page\n\nIf you enjoyed this…."
