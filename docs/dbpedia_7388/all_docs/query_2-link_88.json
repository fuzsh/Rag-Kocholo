The Americans will try to gain some separation in the afternoon's track and field events.\n\nWeightlifting is not typically a medal-producing sport for the Americans at the Summer Olympics.\n\nMorris' bronze gave Team USA more third-place finishes than any spot on the medal podiums in Paris. Team USA has 24 gold medals, 31 silver and 32 bronze."
