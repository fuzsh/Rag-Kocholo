        "text": "issue – 45\n\n24 August 2016\n\nby Richard Crockett\n\nPublisher & Editor of SAILING Magazine\n\nReader response is welcome – respond to: editor@sailing.co.za\n\nReaders are encouraged to forward this to their sailing mates\n\nThe games are now over, bar the shouting, and already in the history books.\n\nIt seems as if the negativity towards the venue prior to the event was a lot of hot air, as much of what was expected negatively simply did not materialise. And the water issue in the sailing area was not mentioned once negatively in any of the reports I received.\n\nOur sailors I am sure did not perform as well as they had hoped, especially Asenathi Jim and Roger Hudson who were hoping to make the medal race. Both teams put their all into their races, and have certainly not let their supporters or their country down.\n\nI have not spoken to any of them yet, but can assure you that the sailing was tough off Rio. Many of the favourites came unstuck and either did not win the medal they were aiming for, or were simply out of medal contention.\n\nThere will be a full report in the October issue of SAILING Magazine once our sailors have been interviewed, and once they have had an opportunity to reflect on their performances in Rio.\n\nAsenathi Jim and Roger Hudson finished 20th overall, and Stefano Marcia, sailing in his first Olympics, was 40th.\n\nIn this issue we “Talk About”…\n\n• Olympic Opening Ceremony Flag Bearers\n\n• Olympic Channel Launched\n\n• New Monohull Keelboat For RSA – The Cape 31\n\n• SAS – South African Sailing\n\n• Coffee\n\n• Barts Bash\n\n• The Northwest Passage\n\n• Splicing Modern Ropes – A Practical Handbook\n\n• Clipper Race TV Series – Simply the Best\n\n• The Humble Bucket\n\n• Entirely Recyclable Yacht\n\n• NASA Looking At Greener Aviation with Novel Concepts\n\n• ‘Comanche’ Breaks Monohull Transatlantic Record\n\n• Designers Look to Proa Sail Power Concept\n\n• There’s No Hiding – From Modern Technology Anyway!\n\n• 10 Phrases You Never Knew Came From Sailing\n\n• Some Humour\n\n• How True!

Sailing had more flag bearers in the Rio Opening Ceremony than Beijing 2008 and London 2012 combined.\n\n13 sailors led their nations around the stadium that evening for the eyes of the world to witness.\n\nThese are the nations and yachties chosen:\n\nAruba – Nicole Van der Velden – Nacra 17\n\nCyprus – Pavlos Kontides – Laser\n\nEstonia – Karl Martin Rammo – Laser\n\nFinland – Tuuli Petaja-Siren – RS:X\n\nGreece – Sofia Bekatorou – Nacra 17\n\nLithuania – Gintare Scheidt – Laser Radial\n\nNew Zealand – Peter Burling and Blair Tuke – 49er\n\nPortugal – Joao Rodrigues – Windsurfer\n\nSeychelles – Rodney Govinden – Laser\n\nSlovenia – Vasilij Zbogar – Finn\n\nUruguay – Dolores Moreira – Laser Radial\n\nUS Virgin Islands – Cy Thompson – Laser\n\nOlympic Channel Launched\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has launched its ground-breaking new media destination, the Olympic Channel, where fans can experience the power of sport and the Olympic Movement all year round. The Olympic Channel platform is available worldwide via a mobile app for Android and iOS devices and HERE\n\nIn addition, athletes and fans can follow the Olympic Channel on its newly launched social media handles on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, and sign up for Olympic Channel updates HERE\n\nIOC President Thomas Bach said: The launch of the Olympic Channel is the start of an exciting new journey to connect the worldwide audience with the Olympic Movement all year round. Fans will be able to follow sports, athletes and the stories behind the Olympic Games. The Olympic Channel will inspire us all and reach out to new generations of athletes and fans.\n\nWith the goal of providing a new way to engage young people, fans and new audiences in the Olympic Movement, the Olympic Channel is a free platform that will present original programming, live sports events, news and highlights offering additional exposure for sports and athletes all year round. Olympic Channel original programming will include both short-form and long-form content, focussing on elite athletes, their quest for success and sport around the world.\n\nDesigned for a global audience, the Olympic Channel digital platform will showcase content from around the world, and will initially be offered in English. Additional features at launch will include fantastic content as video on demand, as well as individual sport pages within a user-friendly and mobile-responsive interface, subtitled in nine different languages.\n\nThe Olympic Channel includes an option to register for a richer and more personalised experience, where users can follow their favourite athletes, teams, sports and countries to receive an individually-tailored content selection. The dynamic environment also allows videos to be easily shared across social media, and encourages users to regularly interact with the Olympic Movement.\n\nNew Monohull Keelboat For RSA – The Cape 31\n\nI recently interviewed Mike Giles about the new Cape 31 monohull that is being developed specially for the local market. This is an exciting, brand new boat that will add spice to monohull sailing locally, and give local sailors a taste of just what hi-performance sailing is all about. She has an optimized hull shape which will make her fast, very fast. Giles is the project manager for this boat.\n\nThis exciting project is the brain child of Lord Laidlaw who is actively involved in sailing locally, campaigns Cape Fling (R/P 52) in Cape waters, and races a R/P 82 and a new Swan 115 in key major international regattas.\n\nLord Laidlaw approached Mark Mills, a premier yacht designer, to draw up a 31-foot one-design boat for this country. 31′ is a good size for South African waters, being large enough for the strong winds of Cape Town. And it will be affordable. It could have been bigger, but the costs rise exponentially the bigger the boat.\n\n“There is no scrimping on this boat at all, as ALL the best people internationally, and locally, are being engaged to ensure that we get a top-flight end product” said Giles.\n\nFor every yachtie the performance of the boat is the first thing they want to know, so here’s what is expected of this slippery 31-footer.\n\n“The speeds we envisage are in the high teens downwind – so it will be a flyer and a fun and exhilarating boat to sail” said Giles.\n\nThe project is well underway already with the first boat in the water early December, with the objective of competing in the RCYC Summer Regatta later in December.\n\nSince Mills drew the lines, the services of Steve Koopman, one of the leading composite engineers in the sailing world, was engaged to ensure that the correct structural and composite decisions were made. With these two world class people on board the project had the perfect start with a very good design and engineer. Add top class good tooling and a good builder you WILL end up building a fantastic product.\n\nThe one-design aspect is critical to the entire project so EVERY hull has to be absolutely identical, and for that to happen the project has to be the best at every level.\n\n“I think where other one design classes around the world have fallen flat is their need to further fair the hull, keel and rudder after exiting the mould” said Giles. “With this project, and each key area being handled by an expert in his field, we are sure that when the boat pops out the mould it will absolutely perfect and blemish-free”.\n\nTo further the ‘perfect’ thinking, the hull tools are all being CNC milled in the US. This is a costly exercise, yet it achieves two things: it produces a hull that is absolutely perfect from the outset, and is a quick process.\n\nBuilders and tooling companies were consulted in Europe, the USA and the UK. Symmetrix Composite Tooling in Bristol, Rhode Island were appointed to build the hull tooling and interior grid mould whilst Alfresco Composites undertook to do the deck tool.\n\nTed Brown of Alfresco Composites, based in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, is the head boat builder for boat number 1. He is also overseeing the tooling production. The completed hull tool will have been delivered to the builder by the time this article is read, the deck is well in production and the internal grid tool will have been CNC cut.\n\n“You may ask why the first boat is being built in the USA and not locally? The reasons are sound though as we want to ensure that ALL the components fit together perfectly BEFORE all the moulds are shipped to Cape Town to a local builder. Alfresco Composites will build the first boat, and once all is perfect, they will then come to South Africa to supervise the building of hull number 2.\n\nSo there will be a transfer of knowledge from the USA to RSA. Lord Laidlaw has committed to fund the design, engineering and tooling.\n\nThe local builder chosen is Stephan du Toit of Performance Craft in Cape Town. He comes from a strong dinghy boat building background, and he will be upskilled to produce these boats when he goes to the USA very soon for the production of the first boat.\n\nMany of the other components will all be sourced within South Africa. Southern Spars in Cape Town will build the carbon fibre masts. Other composite pieces such as the keel fin, carbon bowsprit and rudder will all be produced in Cape Town. There is solid reasoning in this approach as we are simply using the best people possible for each and every component.\n\n“This whole project will undoubtedly uplift the sport and industry locally” said Giles. Lord Laidlaw’s intention with this project has been to introduce a new fast one-design boat that will give local sailors a taste of what is happening internationally. For us to still be sailing regattas on boats with spinnaker poles while the rest of the world is foiling, means that we as a sport are slipping further behind. So I think this is a fantastic project which will introduce a grand prix type of sailing boat” enthused Giles.\n\nThe full report with colour renderings is I the September issue of SAILING Magazine, and will be on sale throughout the country on Monday.

Regrettably the document is too long to reproduce here, so please read it on the SAS website HERE\n\nCoffee\n\nOne can never be too surprised about the things yachties get up to, or their foibles when off the water.\n\nI personally know of many yachties who are simply passionate about good coffee. And they all have a similar opinion which is simply this – unless you grind your own beans and drink your coffee black, it’s not worth having!\n\nThe reason for mentioning this is simply that a new subscriber to “Talking Sailing” is in the coffee roasting business. I noticed his e-mail address and followed him to his website where he appears to have some good beans on offer. I have ordered, but not yet tried them, so cannot report first-hand.\n\nFor those coffee lovers out there, follow this link HERE\n\nBart’s Bash\n\nCome on ALL South African Yacht Clubs, please put your full weight and resources behind this initiative, and rally your members and their friends to participate.\n\nThe sailing season is fast approaching, which means it’s the time of year to get your sailing club, sail training centre, yacht club, scout group and sea cadets units signed up to hold a Bart’s Bash race.\n\nBart’s Bash will take place over two days on 17 and 18 September. Since Bart’s Bash started in 2014 the event has seen over 45,000 sailors participate across 62 countries. In 2016 Bart’s Bash aims to encourage more sailors and countries to participate across the world and continue to be one of the highlights of the sailing club calendar bringing members and their family and friends together.\n\nIf you haven’t already done so, it’s time to sign yourself up to take part in Bart’s Bash 2016 at www.bartsbash.com!\n\nThis is your chance to sail against your sporting heroes and help us ensure that we can continue to promote Bart’s legacy. Let’s make this annual event THE mass participation sailing event where your help and involvement will continue to inspire more and more people to try their hand at this thrilling and competitive sport.\n\nThe Andrew Simpson Sailing Foundation (ASSF) continues to encourage more people to get on the water and promote the benefits it brings people of all abilities. The ASSF pledges to use the funds raised through Bart’s Bash in 2016 to help promote and develop disabled sailing globally.\n\nSince its launch, the ASSF has pledged funds of over £600,000 to a range of inspiring sailing projects across nine countries. For details on some of our other ASSF projects and more information on grants available is HERE\n\nThe Northwest Passage\n\nEver wanted to traverse this tough passage?\n\nWell, one can now do this in comfort and style aboard a cruise ship. It may not be the same as actually sailing the passage in command of your own vessel, but it does get one through this magnificent area in relative safety.\n\nThe cruise ship ‘Crystal Serenity’ voyaged over the top of the world giving its passengers breathtaking views of spectacular glaciers and towering fjords during a 32 day cruise from Anchorage to New York.\n\nIn doing so she became the first commercial cruise ship to sail through Canada’s Northwest Passage.\n\nThe Northwest Passage was first navigated more than a century ago by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, but has been ice-free only in recent years.\n\nThis was not a cheap cruise, but for those with the means and an urge to traverse this area in comfort while experiencing breathtaking land, sea and ice-scapes – this may just be the way to do it.\n\nIncidently, the Northwest Passage is the sea route connecting the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Arctic Ocean, along the northern coast of North America via waterways through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.\n\nSouth African sailor Ralf Dominick is one of less than 200 people to have completed this passage on a sailing yacht.\n\nSplicing Modern Ropes – A Practical Handbook\n\nby Jan-Willem Polman\n\nSome months ago I reviewed the above title, published by Bloomsbury, in SAILING Magazine as it is a subject yachties need to know about. It was an instant hit with orders coming in at a rapid rate. So, in case you missed it here it is again.\n\nFor any yachtie, splicing rope is an essential skill, but sadly few have mastered this art. As the traditional 3-strand rope is fast becoming obsolete aboard yachts, one now needs to know how to splice more modern braided ropes.\n\nWhat many yachties do not know is that a knot can reduce the strength of a rope by as much as 50%, whereas a well spliced rope reduces strength by only around 5 – 10%.\n\nSplicing can be fun, and it is quite easy to learn. Plus, it is a lifetime skill and one which is useful to have on your sailing CV.\n\nSplices are better and stronger than knots or shackles for joining or shortening ropes. Splicing can make your onboard setup easier, safer and even faster, and may even assist in optimising your deck layout and saving weight.\n\nWhat I like about this book is that it is well illustrated with full colour diagrams which makes following the various steps just that much easier. There are few lengthy ‘wordy’ explanations, simply loads of illustrations.\n\nSo this is what it will teach you:\n\n• to make strong, reliable splices in braided rope\n\n• to select ropes in the materials that best suit your on-board requirements.\n\n• to customise your ropes to make your setup easier and safer.\n\n• To optimise your deck layout and save weight on board.\n\n• to taper your sheets for ease of handling.\n\n• to splice an extra cover on your ropes to give better grip in clutches, avoid chafe and make them last longer.\n\nThe first part of this book describes various materials and how to use them on board, and with this insight one will be able to make a better selection when buying new ropes.\n\nI would recommend that the first four chapters be read before going headlong into the ‘how to splice’ parts. These chapters cover:\n\n1. Synthetic fibres in terms of development, technical features and types..\n\n2. Covers the construction of ropes.\n\n3. Which type of rope? Very useful in terms of choice for halyards, sheets, control lines, running backstays, moorings lines and more.\n\n4. Before you start. Covers splicing tools and more.\n\nFrom this point there is no need to go chapter-by chapter as you can then learn about the ropes you specifically want to splice – so there is lots to choose from.\n\nTowards the end is a chapter on ‘Whippings’. One thing I have always hated is frayed ends on ropes where no-one has bothered to either whip the end or even heat-seal it. Whipping is easy and gives the impression of a neat and well cared for vessel.\n\nAnother useful chapter (13) is about reeving new halyards. Read it as there are some good tips to be had.\n\nTo order a copy from SAILING Books, mail: derri@sailing.co.za\n\nClipper Race TV Series – Simply the Best\n\nThe international television series of the Clipper 2015-16 Round the World Yacht Race has won a prestigious award as the ‘Best Documentary Series-UK’ in the industry TMT Media Awards 2016.\n\nThe second season of the highly acclaimed sports adventure series ‘The Race of Their Lives 2′ follows the people taking on the latest edition of the Clipper Race in seven one-hour shows. Many are novices before their extensive pre-race training.\n\n“This is excellent news,” said Clipper Race Global Business and Communications Director Jonathan Levy, who is executive producer of the series. “It reflects the compelling nature of the story as ‘ordinary’ people take on the extraordinary challenge of racing across the world’s toughest oceans.\n\n“The team at our official host broadcast production company, 1080 Media TV, has done an incredible job in difficult conditions to capture the race as it unfolds aboard the yachts, and tell the story of these everyday people as they achieve something remarkable.”\n\nThe programmes have been distributed to broadcasters around the world, reaching well in excess of a hundred countries so far.\n\nThe Humble Bucket\n\nI have previously written about the humble bucket in this blog as at the time it was dubbed as the ultimate bucket. Well, according to the headline of a press release I received it says: “The humble bucket finally improved upon, and then some”.\n\nWell, who would have guessed that something as humble as a bucket could be improved upon even more, and that some bright spark actually sat down to improve it – again!\n\nSince its introduction in the late ’60s, the ubiquitous 20 litre plastic pail hasn’t changed much—until now. Shurhold Industries introduces the One Bucket System. It turns its World’s Best Rope Handle Bucket into an extraordinary, multipurpose cleaning and storage solution.\n\nThe 5 Gallon Rope Handle Bucket is made in the USA and features a soft, 2cm braided, nylon rope handle for easy lifting and comfortable carrying. Built to last, it won’t rust or damage delicate boat finishes.\n\nElevated off the bottom of the pail is the removable Bucket Grate. Dirt and debris fall through the grate, so the wash tool is always in clean water. Brushes can be scrubbed against it to remove grime. It also has two built-in 88ml measuring cups for accurate proportioning of cleaning products.\n\nThe Bucket Caddy is the perfect place to store bottles, tools and other supplies. It nestles within the bucket for storage, on top of the grate. Its integrated handle makes it easy to pull out and move around while working.\n\nBuilt of sturdy, high-quality plastic, the Bucket Seat/Lid snaps onto the bucket rim and keeps both the system and supplies secure. Padded, it makes the perfect place to sit and take a break.\n\nAnyone who has brushed a deck knows how difficult it is to avoid toppling over a pail. Shurhold’s optional Bucket Base keeps the One Bucket System from tipping. It’s made from soft rubber to avoid scratches and slipping.\n\nSo there we have it – now don’t all rush off at once to buy one as to my knowledge it’s not available locally. But to view it follow the link HERE\n\nEntirely Recyclable Yacht\n\nExtreme sailor Norbert Sedlacek is planning to set sail in 2018 with a racing yacht which is entirely recyclable and safe for the environment.\n\nHis passage will be nonstop, single-handed and without assistance from Les Sables d’Olonne (FRA) to the Arctic, through the Northwest Passage, down the Pacific Ocean, passing the most dangerous cape in the world Cape Horn to circumnavigate the Antarctic continent. After rounding Cape Horn a second time, the passage will continue north through the Atlantic Ocean to the final destination of Les Sables d’Olonne (FRA).\n\nHis goal is not merely to attempt a world record, but to also test several material developments and provide performance proof of an entirely new and sustainable yacht construction concept.\n\nSustainable balsa end-grain of the global leader 3A Composites, sustainable, environment harmless FILAVA volcanic fibre and harmless to health epoxy matrix of the Austrian start-up company bto-epoxy form the basis of the high performance laminate from which Sedlacek’s prototype is built. The laminate should be able to survive collisions with drifting ice, temperature differences of more than 80°c and severe wave impacts. In addition, the insulating properties of the hull material shall allow sailing in Arctic waters for months without heating and further the required energy on board is to 100% renewable.\n\nThis is an interesting concept and can be followed HERE\n\nNASA Looking At Greener Aviation with Novel Concepts\n\nNASA has selected five green technology concepts that have the potential to transform the aviation industry in the next decade by reducing aircraft fuel use and emissions.\n\nThe concepts were selected under NASA’s Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program for a two-year study. The topics, including three specifically targeted at electrically-propelled aircraft are:\n\n• alternative fuel cells;\n\n• using 3-D printing to increase electric motor output;\n\n• the use of lithium-air batteries for energy storage;\n\n• new mechanisms for changing the shape of an aircraft wing in flight; and\n\n• the use of a lightweight material called aerogel in the design and development of aircraft antenna.\n\nThese five concepts, in addition to three of the six selected in 2015, address NASA’s green aviation initiatives to cut fuel use by half, lower harmful emissions by 75 percent, and significantly reduce aircraft noise.\n\n“There definitely was an emphasis in our selections on bringing forward activities that addressed a NASA aeronautics goal to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation during the 21st century,” said program manager Doug Rohn.\n\nThough there can be no guarantee the studies will result in deployable technologies, given the novelty of the concepts, researchers are confident much critical data and information will be gleaned from the studies that will inform future green aviation concepts and research efforts.\n\n“Is failure an option? It depends on your definition of failure. We’re going to ask the questions and see if these ideas are feasible or not. A successful feasibility assessment may determine the concept won’t work,” Rohn said.\n\n‘Comanche’ Breaks Monohull Transatlantic Record\n\nLate in July ‘Comanche’ passed Lizard Point (UK) to complete the 2,880 nautical miles from West to East across the Atlantic and smashed the monohull transatlantic record.\n\nThe illustrious record had been held by ‘Mari Cha IV’ since 2003 and stood at 6 days 17 hours 52 minutes and 39 seconds. The crew of world class sailors beat the previous record by 1 day, 3 hours 31 minutes 14 seconds in a total elapsed time of 5 days, 14 hours, 21 minutes 25 seconds at an average speed of 21.44 knots.\n\nDesigners Look to Proa Sail Power Concept\n\nA design for a zero emissions cargo ship has been unveiled that again highlights the potential of a proa for reducing emissions.\n\nThe Fair Winds Trading Company is currently in the research and design stage for a sail cargo ship based on the ancient proa; a multi hull cargo sailing ship of the South Pacific.\n\nThe company plans to initially transport goods between its sustainable development project in West Africa and Argyll, Scotland. The long-term vision is to assist small island developing states and coastal communities in the least developed countries to acquire their own ships and establish their own trade routes.\n\n“Our aim is, not only to achieve a zero negative impact method of sea transport, but also to demonstrate to commercial shipping and the market that this is not only do-able but desirable,” said Madadh MacLaine, founder and CEO of Fair Winds Trading Company.\n\nSee more HERE\n\nFull Sail Ahead – A New Take on Offshore Wind Power\n\nSkySails is a German based company producing wind powered propulsion for boats over 100 feet in length. Operating on principals similar to kite boarding, this system utilizes a high altitude ‘tow kite’ to generate power for the vessel.\n\nBoasting up to a 35% reduction in fuel consumption in ideal conditions, these power generation systems launched (literally) in 2008 during the height of fuel costs, provide cargo ships some reprieve in operating costs downwind. While fuel pricing has reduced in the past several years, one thing remains constant: green initiatives that save greenbacks are here to stay.\n\nTechnological advances such as the Dyneema line, that tethers the kite to the vessel, allows the nearly 1800 square foot kite (which produces the thrust of an Airbus A318 turbine engine) to carry the cargo across open ocean.\n\nThis may sounds like science fiction, but thanks to advanced fibre technologies and physics this sustainable energy can be utilized to reduce carbon emissions for global transport.\n\nFor sailors the effect Wind Shear is often discussed as you deal with varying wind over the height of the sail. Taller masts can produce more power by catching air that may be passing over boats with less sail area above the deck. SkySails takes this atmospheric effect to the extreme by launching their football field sized kites (manufactured by North Sails NZ) thousands of feet in the air to catch oceanic breeze that is more substantial and more consistent. Utilizing their integrated mast system to launch and retrieve this mammoth kite has made SkySails a viable solution for merchant vessels looking to the future of shipping.\n\nNow whose bowman is up to dousing one of these?\n\n10 Phrases You Never Knew Came From Sailing\n\nThe American Sailing Association recently published this, which is worth sharing.\n\nWhen you stop to think about it… sailing is pretty amazing. From a historical perspective, through its role in travel, trade and war, it was the absolute hinge of western civilization for hundreds of years. Through that time, sailors’ slang and terminology became rooted in the English lexicon and still exists profoundly to this day.\n\nHere’s a list of 10 everyday phrases that you may not have realized were born in the days when sailing made the world go round… wait… is that a nautical phrase?\n\n“A clean bill of health”. According to dictionary.com this phrase derives from the days when the crew of ocean going ships might be a little less than hygienic, so they needed to present a certificate, carried by a ship, attesting to the presence or absence of infectious diseases among the ship’s crew and at the port from which it has come.\n\n“Feeling Blue”. How often do you hear people talking about feeling blue or have the blues? An entire genre of music comes from this phrase. Who knew that came from the world of sailing? See-the-sea.org explains the popular phrase comes from a custom that was practised when a ship lost its captain during a voyage. The ship would fly blue flags and have a blue band painted along her hull when she returned to port.\n\n“Pipe down”. Parents have been screaming “pipe down” to their kids forever, but where does that actually come from? Apparently, Pipe Down was the last signal from the Bosun’s pipe each day, which meant lights-out, quiet down, time to go to bed.\n\n“Over a barrel”. We all know when someone has you “over a barrel” things aren’t going well. This saying is used all the time these days to indicate being severely compromised, but it began in the most literal way. Sailor crew would sometimes be punished for their misgivings and that involved being tied over a cannon barrel and whipped. It’s no wonder that one stuck around. Yikes.\n\n“Toe the line”. Perhaps you’ve been at work and your boss has scowled at you and said, “toe the line, or you’re gone”. If this has happened to you, we are sorry, that sounds like a horrible work environment. But, if you were wondering about the origins of his demand, it’s an old naval expression that refers to a ship’s crew would be called to gather and form a line with their toes all touching a given seam (or line) of the deck planking.\n\n“By and Large”. Folks say this one all the time to refer to the big picture. “By and large, ASA is the most awesome organization in existence”… something like that. This term got started on a sailboat with the word “by” meaning into the wind and “large” meaning off the wind. So sailors would say: “By and large this ship handles quite nicely.”\n\n“Loose cannon”. Everyone has known a few people who are loose cannons – unpredictable and dangerous on some level. Not surprisingly the term comes from when a ship’s cannon would come loose from it’s lashing. The big dangerous thing would be sliding all over the place making for some uncomfortable time on deck trying to get that bad boy back in its spot.\n\n“A square meal”. People often talk about getting three “square meals” a day…what the hell is a square meal? It’s actually quite simple – the wooden plates back in the days of tall ships were square.\n\n“Hand over fist”. These days this phrase usually refers to making a bunch of money, although it can refer to anything happening fast and in abundance. It comes from a more literal origin – sailors would be tugging at lines as fast as they could, hand over fist, to trim sheets and raise sails.\n\n“Son of a gun”. It’s amazing that this phrase has lasted so long. Back in the day, as you might imagine, sailors were often less than virtuous and every once in a while a “lady friend” of a crewman might give birth to a child on the ship. A good spot for this sort of thing was between the guns on the gun deck. Now let’s say this little rascal isn’t claimed by any of the aforementioned sleazy sailors, this little grommet would sometimes be called a “son of a gun”.\n\nSome Humour\n\nWhatever You Say Sir!\n\nIt was a dark, stormy, night. The Sailor was on his first assignment, and it was guard duty. The Captain stepped out taking his dog for a walk. The nervous young Seaman snapped to attention, made a perfect salute, and shouted out, “Good Evening, Sir!”\n\nThe Captain returned the salute and said “Good evening Seaman, nice night, isn’t it?”\n\nWell it wasn’t a nice night, but the Sailor wasn’t going to disagree with the Captain, so he saluted again and replied “Yes Sir!”\n\nThe Captain continued, “You know there’s something about a stormy night that I find soothing, it’s really relaxing. Don’t you agree?”\n\nThe Seaman didn’t agree, but then the seaman was just a seaman, and responded “Yes Sir!”\n\nThen the Captain, pointing at the dog and said, “This is a Golden Retriever, the best type of dog to train.”\n\nThe Seaman glanced at the dog and said “Yes Sir!”\n\nThe Captain continued “I got this dog for my wife.”\n\nThe Seaman simply said, “Good trade Sir!”\n\nHow True! This Simply Needs to Be Said!\n\nThe Gods do not protect fools. Fools are protected by more capable fools.\n\nI Like This!\n\nI love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.\n\nSome Selected Responses to “Talking Sailing”\n\n• We owe you one for your comment in the June issue of Talking Sailing!\n\nA trip in the ‘RMS St Helena’ to the Island was on our bucket list for years, but we always found other things to do. Then realised it was too late as the airport was due to open this year and the RMS was being taken out of service. After I read your comment I actually googled the ‘RMS St Helena’ to see whether the service had been extended, but the schedule said her last voyage was terminating in Cape Town in mid-July. So the sea trip to the Island was definitely off the bucket list.\n\nIt struck me for some unaccountable reason last week that if the RMS had paid off in Cape Town we certainly hadn’t heard anything about it, and it would surely be a newsworthy event. So I googled the RMS once more – and found the new schedule of her voyages to St Helena till July 2017. So back on the bucket list and we are treating ourselves to a trip in October – entirely thanks to your article, as with our heads in the sand we hadn’t heard about the wind issue at the airport.\n\nCheers and thanks for all the news updates.\n\nA Lasting Gift – A Subscription to SAILING Magazine\n\nNeed a gift for a loved one, sailing friend or crew?
