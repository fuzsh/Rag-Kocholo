        "text": "MARSEILLE, France -- Marit Bouwmeester of the Netherlands won the gold medal in the women's dinghy at the Paris Olympics on Wednesday, marking the fourth straight Games in which she has reached the podium.\n\nDenmark's Anne-Marie Rindom, a four-time Olympian who won gold in Tokyo three years ago, took the silver medal. Line Flem Hoest of Norway got bronze and pumped her first in the air as she crossed the finish line before jumping in the water to hug her friend Rindom.\n\nThe medal races for both women and men had been postponed to Wednesday because of fickle and light winds. Two more medal races originally scheduled for Wednesday -- in the mixed-gender dinghies and multihull -- were pushed back to Thursday.\n\nAustralia's Matt Wearn made it back-to-back Olympic titles on the men's side after the race was started and paused and restarted Wednesday afternoon because of fluctuating winds.\n\nThe 36-year-old Bouwmeester won silver in this class of sailing in London in 2012, followed by gold in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and bronze in Tokyo. This was her first Olympic medal as a mother -- her 2-year-old daughter, Jessie Mae, has become a companion in training, the medalist said.\n\n\"I'm very, very, very grateful to be in the Olympics and also be a mom,\" Bouwmeester said.\n\nShe didn't rule out a fifth Olympics, but said her priority for now would be her daughter: \"I just want to go home and be there for little Jessie Mae.\"\n\nRindom said Wednesday's racing felt \"amazing\" after \"such a tricky week of sailing.\"\n\nHoest secured her bronze with a \"safe start\" and then focused on speed, she said.\n\n\"From the first downwind, I knew, 'keep breathing, keep sailing, this medal is yours,'\" said the Norwegian, who trains by cross-country skiing.\n\nBouwmeester's victory was the Netherlands' second sailing gold in these Games, following Odile van Aanholt and Annette Duetz in the women's skiffs. Dutch windsurfer Luuc van Opzeeland won a bronze, making the country the leader in sailing medals so far.\n\nRindom won bronze in 2016 before her Tokyo gold.\n\nPavlos Kontides of Cyprus won silver in the men's race, doubling his country's medal count after he won Cyprus' first Olympic medal ever in 2012. Stefano Peschiera of Peru took bronze, and \"cried like never before in my life.\""
