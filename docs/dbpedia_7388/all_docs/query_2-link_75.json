I suspect my name will be written in golden letters in Cyprus. I still don't realise what I have done for myself and when I return to my country on Thursday and people are cheering for me I will start to realise the level of achievement.\"\n\nCyprus first competed at the Games in 1980 and Kontides predicted that the country would be proud of his success: \"When I get back home there will be huge celebrations because this is a huge achievement for my country, the first-ever Olympic medal,” he said. “When I have the medal over my neck and I am back home with my compatriots, then I will really understand what's going on. I hadn't really seen it because I didn't allow myself to be emotional, just focused.\""
