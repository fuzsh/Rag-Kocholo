        "text": "A total of 15 athletes represented the country at the Games, spread across a total of seven different sports.\n\nSix of those competitors joined Michaelides at a press conference to reflect on Rio 2016 and discuss the importance of having state support to help them maintain a leading role in promoting sport and their country on the global stage.\n\nMilan Trajkovic, who finished seventh in the final of the men’s 110 metres hurdles, reflected on the importance of funding in achieving the result.\n\nHe was one of three members of the team, along with discus thrower Apostolos Parellis and high jumper Leodia Kallenou, to benefit from funding from Pavlos Kontides.\n\nKontides, who won a silver medal at the London 2012 Summer Olympics in sailing, opted to allocate funds from a sponsorship awarded to him towards six sports.\n\n\"The talent is there but talent alone cannot get you anywhere,” said Kontides, according to the Famagusta Gazette.\n\n“There should be a proper team around athletes, hard work, perseverance, patience, and then the results will come.”\n\nKontides remains as Cyprus’ only Olympic medallist following his podium finish at London 2012 in the men's laser, but Michaelides claims that Rio 2016 showed the country’s progress, stating it was their best presence at a Games to date.\n\n“I say to date because the prospects for progress in Cyprus sport are bigger, more hopeful and promising,\" Michaelides said, according to the Famagusta Gazette.\n\nSix of the country’s 15 athletes at the Games reached the finals of their respective sports, with the hope that Cyprus will be able to build on this achievement at future Olympics.\n\nCyprus weightlifter Antonis Mastasdis did not appear at the Games, after he was sent home ahead of the Opening Ceremony due to a failed drug test."
