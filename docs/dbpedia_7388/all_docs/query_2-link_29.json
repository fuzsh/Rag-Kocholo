        "text": "Freedom24 has become a Super Grand sponsor for Cypriot sailor Pavlos Kontides, the first Olympic medallist in the country's history. The strategic partnership with the famous sailor is yet another example of the company's efforts to support Cypriot athletes and promote Cyprus on the international sporting stage.\n\nBorn and raised in Cyprus, Kontides won a silver medal in the men's Laser race at the 2012 Olympics. His other sporting titles include the two-time World Champion (2017 and 2018) and two-time European Champion (2018 and 2022). Kontides will represent Cyprus at the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nFreedom24 is proud to support the renowned sailor who has not only brought his country an important international award, but also inspires other Cypriot athletes to new achievements, said Evgeniy Tyapkin, Executive Director of Freedom Finance Europe, the parent company of Freedom24. \"This year holds special significance for Pavlos and other athletes in our country as they all prepare for the upcoming Summer Olympics. Freedom24 is pleased to support Pavlos in any way we can to help him achieve new victories on the global sporting stage. Our company is greatly involved in the development of sailing, chess and football in Cyprus. Together we have many exciting projects ahead,\" said the top executive.\n\nKontides, who has been named Freedom24's EU Ambassador, expressed his gratitude to the company for its involvement in organising sporting events in Cyprus, such as the FAREAST 28R European Sailing Championship held in November 2023. \"It feels great to be a part of a company that is a leading brokerage and shares the same passions as I do. It is important to me that Freedom24 is active in Cyprus’ sports community. There will be more events in 2025,” he said.\n\nBeyond the Olympic partnership, Freedom24 and Kontides plan various joint activities, aimed at fostering sailing and other sports in Cyprus, further contributing to the country’s sports development.\n\nPavlos Kontides: Embarking on a new exciting journey with Freedom24\n\n2024 being the Olympic year holds immense significance in my career. This summer, I am going to represent Cyprus at my 5th Olympic Games. Therefore, the support of the team around me holds great importance, and plays a catalytic role in my performance.\n\nI approached the choice of a Super Grand Sponsor with great responsibility. My partner needed to share the same priorities as me. My primary goal is not only to be an athlete but also to contribute to the development of the sports in Cyprus. In this regard, Freedom24 and I align perfectly.\n\nThe company organises sports events, sponsors athletes, and assists sports organisations—essentially working towards the growth of sports on our island. Furthermore, with an equal passion for sailing, Freedom24 has four teams comprising its employees participating in various competitions. This collaboration is not just about supporting me in the Olympic season; it's a shared aspiration to reach new heights! I am confident that partnering with Freedom24 will embrace and help me to give my 100% in every upcoming competition including the Olympic Games. This collaboration is the starting point for strengthening sailing and the entire sports in Cyprus. I express my gratitude to the Freedom24 team and look forward to a long-term partnership!\n\nEvgeniy Tyapkin: Today marks a significant moment for the Cypriot athletic community\n\nOn behalf of Freedom Finance Europe, I am proud to say that today marks a significant moment for the Cypriot athletic community, as we announce a strategic partnership with Pavlos Kontides, the first-ever Olympic medallist from our country.\n\nPavlos’ historic achievement of securing the silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the Men's Laser class not only brought pride to our nation, but to this day inspires athletes from various disciplines.\n\nThis year holds particular significance for Pavlos and our nation's athletes as they prepare for the upcoming Summer Olympics. In light of this, Freedom Finance Europe pledges its support to Pavlos to ensure his continued success on the global sports stage.\n\nOur partnership with Pavlos is a long-term alliance grounded in shared values and vision, that is why this collaboration extends into the future, encompassing joint initiatives aimed at fostering yachting and other sports development throughout our country.\n\nBorn and raised in Cyprus, Pavlos has elevated our nation onto the global stage, much like how Freedom Finance Europe, a Cyprus-based company that extends its services throughout Europe.\n\nAs Pavlos Kontides sets sail for yet another Olympic triumph, we invite you to join us in cheering for him and all our athletes. Let us sail to our Freedom!\n\nUseful links\n\nhttps://freedom24.com/\n\nhttps://pavloskontides.com/\n\nhttps://freedomfinance.eu/esg"
