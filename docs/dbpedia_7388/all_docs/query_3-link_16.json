        "text": "Collaborating with an Olympic medalist athlete is more like a lifetime experience, as it emphases the magic world of sports and highlights the impressive performances of each one. easyBoat.com is more than happy to announce its partnership with one of the most brilliant Olympic athletes in sailing, first ever Olympic medalist of Cyprus, Mr. Pavlos Kontides.\n\nPavlos Kontides has a brilliant story to tell, inspiring generations and sharing faith and hope to all athletes around:\n\nIt was the year 2007 when big success started for him, as he got the qualification for the Olympic Games in Beijing and, a few days later, he won the gold medal at the ISAF Youth World’s Championship. In 2008, when he was just 18 years old, he won the ISAF Youth World’s Championship again and became the only athlete who managed to win the gold medal twice in Laser class. He didn’t stop there, as he also took part in the Beijing Olympics as the youngest athlete in Laser class and got an honorary 13th place.\n\nThe year 2009 is known as a very successful year for him as he won two silver medals in World Cups: one of which in England at the venue where the 2012 Olympics also took place, and the second one was a bronze medal at the European Men’s Championship. The winning of 5th place in the World Men's Championship and the 1st place in the under-21-years category was a huge boost for him and his wonderful carrier.\n\nThe year 2012 won the silver medal in sailing in Laser class, writing his name with golden letters in Cyprus history by giving his country its first ever Olympic medal. Pavlos Kontides completed his studies at Southampton University in July 2013 and a few months later he won the silver medal on the Laser World Championship in Oman. All of his effort rightfully gave him a place among the top ten world athletes, reaching up to 4th place in the world ranking, and placing him among the elite of world sailing.\n\nIn September 2014 at the ISAF World Championship in Santander, Pavlos Kontides was the first Cypriot athlete to get his ticket for the Rio Olympic Games in 2016, where he ranked 7th in the XXXI Olympic Games \"Rio 2016\". The same year he won his first World Cup, the World Cup Final in Melbourne.\n\nWhat is also worth mentioning is that Pavlos Kontides won the World Cup at Hyeres in France, one of the most famous sailing events around the world. Impressively he crowned World Champion for the first time by winning the Laser World Championship in Split, Croatia. In October 2017 he successfully ranked first in the Laser's World Ranking for the very first time in his career. Last but not least, the year after he crowned back-to-back World Champion in Aarhus, Denmark and European Champion in La Rochelle, France, while in October he received the title of The Rolex Sailor of the Year 2018.\n\nThe year 2019 was also an important one, as he won the World Cup in Enoshima in Japan and he launched his athletic responsibility campaign #TowardsTokyo, in order to support athletes from Cyprus in qualifying and better preparing themselves for the Olympic Games \"Tokyo 2020\".\n\nPavlos Kontides has also been voted by the Cyprus Sport Journalist Athlete of the year for 2021 for the 8th time, since 2012. More specifically, he was awarded at the 49th Festival of the Cyprus Sports Writers Association (EAK) in the presence of honored guests, a broadcasted live by Cytavision and RIK event that took place on Thursday, March 10, 2022 at the Municipal Theater of Nicosia. The event was under the auspices of the Cyprus Sports Organization (CMO), as every year. Recently, in 2021, Pavlos Kontides was 4th in the Sailing Laser at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games staying out of medals for just one place, and 5th at the Pan-European Sailing Championships in October in Bulgaria. In 2022, he attended the World Cup Competition in Palma de Mallorca, Spain and finished 6th out of 165 competitors, such a strong beginning for the season ahead.\n\nSupporting athletes like Pavlos Kontides is more than an honor to easyBoat.com, which is proudly an official part of easy family of brands of Sir Stelios Hadjioannou, creator and owner of the easy brand. A partnership built with strong ties, passion for sailing and wish to develop the leading value brand into a global force.\n\nDedicated to this corporation, Pavlos Kontides, who has offered complimentary exposure to the easy family of brands and Sir Stelios Foundation, recently attended Sir Stelios Foundation ambassador's event in Monaco and shared with all of the guests, along with the non-attendant viewers, the opportunity to talk about his wonderful success story and journey as an Olympic medalist, including all of his effort and difficulties he has to deal with. We are truly and warmly thankful to Mr. Pavlos Kontides and Sir Stelios Hatjioannou for all the continues support and corporation.\n\n​​​​​​​\n\nWhat future holds is exciting as the season ahead promises to be full on with several championships for Pavlos Kontides, including Worlds in Mexico in May and Europeans in France in November. Pavlo’s achievement inspires and gives both hope and faith to all of us, especially those who dedicate their life to sports world making us even more proud and honor to knowing them."
