This will be the third time that the French capital has hosted the Summer Games.\n\nHistorically, the U.S. has done the best at track and field, swimming, and shooting, with more gold medals in these categories than any other. These are the top 15 sports for the U.S. at the summer Olympics since the first modern Olympic games in 1896.\n\nOlympians come from almost every state in the U.S. this year. However, Colorado, Vermont, and Hawaii have the most Olympians per capita.\n\nSee where Olympians are from in your state. Click on a dot to see which Olympian is from your area."
