        "text": "We’ve wrapped up our live coverage for the day. Follow more Olympics news here.\n\nBroken records and nail-biting finishes: What you might have missed at the Olympics today\n\nTrack and Field is fully underway in Paris with everything from nail-biting semi-final races setting up the drama tomorrow, multiple broken records in one event and thrilling finishes for gold.\n\nHere’s what happened on the track and on the field on Wednesday:\n\nMen’s 400-meter run: In the final meters of the race, American Quincy Hall overtook Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith in a thrilling finish, beating the Team GB runner to the line by .04 seconds. Zambia’s Muzala Samukonga won bronze.\n\nMen’s 3,000-meter steeplechase: Morocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali charged down the final stretch to win the 3,000-meter steeplechase, chasing down Kenneth Rooks in the final stages after the American had led much of the final lap.\n\nMen’s discus: Records were being broken one after the other in the discus throw. First, Mykolas Alekna of Team Lithuania broke the Olympic record that belonged to his father. The throw went 69.97 meters. That tops his dad, Virgilijus Alekna, who had a 69.89 throw 20 years ago in Athens. Then, minutes later, Jamaica’s Rojé Ston took the record for himself with a 70-meter throw — enough to take home gold in a major upset.\n\nWomen’s pole vault: Australia’s Nina Kennedy beat Katie Moon in the pole vault after the American failed two attempts at clearing 4.95 meters.\n\nAnd here’s a look at how other events played out today:\n\nBasketball: The USA women’s basketball team cruised past Nigeria to advance to the semifinals. They won 88-74. Two-time MVP A’ja Wilson had a dominant night with a game-high 20 points to go with 11 rebounds and two blocks.\n\nVolleyball: Poland’s men’s volleyball team is gold-medal game bound for the first time since 1976 after a wild five sets full of epic back-and-forth play. They defeated the United States. Poland will play the winner of Italy and France’s semifinal match.\n\nSailing: Marit Bouwmeester of the Netherlands became the most successful woman in Olympic sailing after winning the women’s dinghy gold on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Australia’s Matt Wearn retained his men’s dinghy sailing Olympic title. The men’s dinghy race was initially abandoned midway through due to weather.\n\nWeightlifting: China’s Li Fabin successfully defended his men’s 61kg weightlifting title and set a new Olympic record.\n\nSkateboarding: Australia’s Keegan Palmer successfully defended his men’s park skateboarding title. He already had the gold medal in the bag by the time he was the last skater to compete on his third run.\n\nArtistic swimming: Team USA was thrilled with their performance scoring a 271.3166, which put them in gold medal position for a brief time. But, China followed the USA with a more difficult routine and grabbed gold. USA finished in silver.

Kennedy passed the 4.90-meter height on her first attempt.\n\nKennedy and Moon both failed on their first attempts at 4.95 meters, which meant that it all came down to Moon’s last jump. If she cleared the bar, then Kennedy would have had to match her and clear it herself. But if she missed, she handed the Aussie the gold and would have to settle for silver.\n\nMoon ran down the runway and planted her pole, but just couldn’t get her body over the bar. It fell to the ground and Kennedy began to sob as she was mobbed by her family in the stands.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Australia’s Nina Kennedy.\n\nJamaica's Rojé Stona wins the gold medal in the discus throw in a major upset\n\nRojé Stona has just ruined the Alekna family’s plan for a party in Paris.\n\nThe Jamaican has topped Mykolas Alekna, the top-ranked discus thrower in the world and the owner of the world record. Stona takes home the gold and the Olympic record that Alekna held for a few short minutes earlier tonight.\n\nAlekna had beaten his father’s Olympic record with a toss of 69.97 meters on his second throw of the competition. But just a bit later, Stona tossed the discus 70 meters even, setting a new Olympic record and doing enough to take home the gold.\n\nThe stage was set for Alekna to top Stona on his final throw, but the disappointing effort fell well short.\n\n“It’s a very special night. It’s everything I wanted, but for it to actually happen, it’s a very good feeling,” Stona said post-final.\n\nStona finished 19th in the world championships in 2023, yet became an Olympic champion one year later, a feat that surprised even the Jamaican.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Jamaica’s Rojé Stona.\n\nMohammadhadi Saravi wins men's 97kg Greco-Roman wrestling gold for Iran\n\nIran’s Mohammadhadi Saravi has beaten Artur Aleksanyan of Armenia 4-1 to take home the gold medal in the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling 97kg class.\n\nCuba’s Gabriel Rosillo and Uzur Dzhuzupbekov of Kyrgyzstan took bronze.\n\nTeam USA's Quincy Hall charges down the stretch for an incredible come-from-behind win in the 400 meters\n\nThe competitors are out for the men’s 400-meter final race and American Quincy Hall is the favorite here in an otherwise wide-open race\n\nRunning out of lane eight, Hall seemed to barely get out of a jog during qualifying for this race and feels likely to take home the gold here — possibly with a new world record.\n\nThe gun sounds and they’re off! A massive roar from the Stade de France crowd as 80,000 watch the first gold medal race of the evening.\n\nHall trails most of the race and is in sixth as they come around the final curve. But here comes Hall!\n\nCharging down the final straightaway, Hall makes up ground quickly — the effort written on his face — and he’s suddenly passing runners.\n\nIn the final meters, Hall overtakes Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith in a thrilling finish, beating the Team GB runner to the line by .04 seconds!\n\nOn his unbelievable finish, Hall told reporters afterwards: “I was just thinking, ‘Get home, sir. Get home, sir.’”\n\nAs a result, it’s a gold for Quincy Hall, silver for Hudson-Smith and bronze for Zambia’s Muzala Samukonga.\n\nHall rings the victory bell here at the Stade de France and takes off his shoes to pose for a photo.\n\nHe grabs Old Glory and goes for a shoeless victory lap around the track here, being cheered as he goes. It’s an incredible moment for the American, who ran a personal best and led for only a tenth of a second in the race, leaning across the finish line to take the gold from Hudson-Smith.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Team USA’s Quincy Hall.\n\nJamaica's Rojé Stona tops Mykolas Alekna's Olympic record in the discus, minutes after it was set\n\nAn incredible moment here at the Stade de France!\n\nMere minutes after Lithuania’s Mykolas Alekna beats his father’s Olympic record in the discus throw, Jamaica’s Rojé Stona outdoes him and takes it for himself.\n\nWith an incredible 70-meter throw, Stona is now in the lead for gold and has the Olympic record.

That tops his dad, Virgilijus Alekna, who had a 69.89 throw 20 years ago in Athens.\n\nThe world record holder was always the favorite tonight, but now he’s got a record under his belt and four more attempts to lengthen it.\n\nWomen's pole vault field narrows to 5 as the height increases\n\nThe women’s pole vault field was once 20 — and it’s now down to five.\n\nWilma Murto of Finland, Aikaterini Stefanidi of Greece, Elisa Molinarolo of Italy and Eliza McCartney of New Zealand all failed to clear 4.80 meters, and their Olympics are over.\n\nAmalie Svabikova of the Czech Republic cleared the 4.80-meter bar on her third and final attempt, allowing her the opportunity to go after 4.85 meters, which is the next height.\n\nSo far, Katie Moon of Team USA is in pole position to win the gold, having not missed a jump yet. World No. 1 Nina Kennedy missed one attempt at 4.7 meters, which could cost the Australian at the end of the competition.\n\nThe first tiebreaker, should two competitors both fail to clear a height on three attempts, is based on the number of misses earlier in the competition.

Instead, a fan offered them a ride\n\nYou might expect an Olympic champion would travel in style upon their return home with gold medal in tow.\n\nBut that wasn’t the case for Ireland’s men’s lightweight double sculls champions, Fintan McCarthy and Paul O’Donovan.\n\nHaving arriving back at Dublin Airport, the duo had planned to get the bus to Cork with all their gear, a journey of about 160 miles. But a fan who had been on the same flight from Paris took pity on them.\n\nThe man, identified only as Ciaran, offered McCarthy and O’Donovan a ride in his car after meeting them on the flight. And despite the pair acknowledging the multitude of bags they had with them, off they went.\n\nAs McCarthy put it in a comment on Dublin Airport’s Instagram post about their arrival in Ireland: “Ciaran coming in clutch.”\n\nBoth rowers are from Skibbereen in County Cork.\n\nMutaz Essa Barshim pulls up with apparent injury in high jump qualification, recovers to make final\n\nOlympic champion Mutaz Essa Barshim gave fans in the Stade de France a scare when he pulled up with an apparent injury during high jump qualification.\n\nThe Qatari athlete was attempting to clear 2.27m at the first time of asking but didn’t even attempt his jump, going to ground on the field inside the stadium clutching his right leg.\n\nWho was first to check on Barshim? His friend and co-gold medalist in Tokyo, Italy’s Gianmarco Tamberi. The two jumpers shared the gold in the Japanese capital in a historic moment where they both opted to not continue with a jump-off.\n\nThankfully, for Barshim, he was able to recover and clear the height on his second attempt, though he appeared to still be troubled by the injury, immediately grabbing at the leg after the jump.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the injury will affect his participation in the final.\n\nTamberi, meanwhile, failed to make 2.27 on all three of his attempts but still advances to the final having cleared 2.20 and 2.24 with a clean record.\n\nChaos in the men's 5000m heats as athletes tumble to the track\n\nThere is simply never a dull moment at this year’s Olympics.\n\nWhat started off as a routine heat in the men’s 5000m event, ended in utter chaos as multiple athletes were left strewn over the track.\n\nThe race had been heating up slowly and then sprung into action as the runners approached the final lap.\n\nJust as the athletes took the bell, Canada’s Mohammed Ahmed fell down, leaving him way behind the leading group which raced on frantically to the finish line.\n\nBut that was just a taste of things to come.\n\nAs the leaders swung around the bend onto the home straight, four men were sent flying to the track.\n\nThe incident seemed to start with a tussle between Team GB’s George Mills and France’s Hugo Hay, and resulted in the British runner bumping into two runners on his outside. All three men fell to the track, tripping up another runner behind them.\n\n“I got stepped out on. I was about to kick in the home straight and, boom, the French lad took me down,” Mills told BBC Sport after the race.\n\nMills was clearly annoyed at Hay and angrily confronted his rival at the finish line, shrugging off the Frenchman’s attempts at reconciliation.\n\nWhen asked what he said to his opponent, Mills added: “I’m probably not allowed to say.”\n\nHay finished seventh and was one of eight men to qualify for the final, while Mills eventually crossed the line in 18th after picking himself up off the floor.\n\nAfter a series of appeals, Mills, Mike Foppen, Thierry Ndikumwenayo and Dominic Lokinyomo Lobalu have all since been added to the final after the falls.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Team GB’s George Mills and information of appeals.\n\nJonathan Owens on \"once in a lifetime opportunity\" watching wife Simone Biles in Paris\n\nWhile Simone Biles always looks like the coolest person in the room every time she performs, it turns out watching the 11-time Olympic medalist as a loved one is a nerve-wracking experience.\n\nIn the latest episode of HBO’s Hard Knocks, Biles’ husband – Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens – headed to Paris to watch his wife represent Team USA on the world’s biggest stage.\n\nBefore he boarded the flight to the French capital, Owens video called Biles where the gymnast said hello to her dogs and reminded her husband on Europe’s rules on bringing liquids past airport security.\n\n“I try to remember her routines, so it’ll be like random times she’s on the floor and she does something, and I try to be up there [mimics a dance move] and like knowing the piece, just so I know what’s going on.”\n\nBut as for millions of spectators around the world, watching Biles on beam is a more stressful experience for the NFL player.\n\n“I’m just sitting there watching and especially when she’s on beam, oh my gosh, beam like trips me out. I’m like ‘Babe, there’s no way y’all are like doing flips, just landing on it.’ But landings, all this type of stuff and I’m just watching like [deep inhale].\n\nHard Knocks then shows Owens in the stands watching with the Biles family, keeping score of the events and cheering at every opportunity for the record-breaking star before heading back home where he supports Biles from the sofa.\n\nAs Olympic breaking debuts in Paris, a Moroccan duo is head over heels about the Games\n\nFor Moroccan b-boy Bilal Mallakh and b-girl Fatima El-Mamouny, the Paris Games will always hold a special significance. They’re the first Olympics to feature the sport of breaking, and the Moroccan pair are the only Africans competing in the discipline.\n\nMallakh and El-Mamouny earned their ticket to Paris by winning their respective finals at the inaugural World DanceSport Federation’s (WDSF) African Championship in Rabat in May 2023.\n\nEl-Mamouny says the biggest challenge so far is training with the rigor of an Olympic athlete while keeping the essence of breaking in each performance. “We’ll encounter several difficulties like any athlete on the eve of the Olympics, but I’m not going to give up. It’s both stressful and exciting,” she added.\n\nBreaking – or breakdancing, as it is most commonly known – originated on the streets of New York’s South Bronx in the early 1970s. Dancers would show off their moves during percussion “breaks” in songs played at clubs and block parties, giving the discipline its name.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nBelgian triathlete who fell ill after Seine race says she did not contract E. coli\n\nThe Belgian triathlete who fell ill after swimming in the women’s race says that she did not contract E.coli.\n\nIn a post on her Instagram page Tuesday, Claire Michel said she felt the need to “clarify a few things” following “conflicting information.”\n\n“Blood tests showed that I contracted a virus (not E.

After Phogat’s disqualification, only the gold and bronze medals will be awarded in this event.\n\nPhogat, a three-time Olympian, was set to face Team USA’s Sarah Hildebrandt in today’s final.\n\nBefore the latest cruel twist of fate, she had appeared guaranteed to come away with either a gold or silver medal.\n\nA little over a year ago, Phogat was sleeping on the streets of New Delhi as part of an athlete-led protest calling out sexual harassment allegations within her sport.\n\nIn India, she and her fellow wrestlers have become the very public face of an ongoing protest movement that has created global headlines and sparked a fierce #MeToo debate.\n\nThey camped for weeks last year demanding action on sexual harassment claims made against the president of the Wrestling Federation of India.\n\nPolice charged Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh with assault, stalking and sexual harassment. He has denied all allegations against him.\n\nPhogat’s fellow wrestlers had hailed her journey to the final as both a personal and collective triumph for India’s wrestling community.\n\nRead the full story."
