        "text": "See how Grandstand covered Day Seven of the London Olympics.\n\n8:30am: It looks like that's about it for Day Seven in London. The US dominated the pool yet again to move past China on the medal tally with 21 golds to 20. Hosts Great Britain also made a big move, taking three of the four track cycling golds to reach eight and sit fourth overall. Australia failed yet again to add to its single gold tally and has slumped to a lowly 19th, behind even New Zealand (12th), which now has three gold. Check out the full medal tally here.\n\nThere's 25 gold medals to be decided on Day Eight. Among the highlights:\n\nUsain Bolt and Yohan Blake start their 100m campaigns while Oscar Pistorius makes history as the first amputee to feature at the Olympics\n\nMichael Phelps looks for his 18th gold and 22nd Olympic medal in the men's 4x100m medley relay\n\nMaria Sharapova and Serena Williams clash in the women's singles final\n\nRead our Day Eight preview.\n\nLoading...\n\nSWIMMING:\n\n8:15am: Our reporter Phil Williams caught up with Steph Rice and spoke to her about her London disappointment and what the future holds:\n\nLoading...\n\nTENNIS:\n\n8:00am: The mixed doubles quarter-final between Lleyton Hewitt/Samantha Stosur and Andy Murray/Laura Robson has been rescheduled for 9:00pm AEST.\n\nBEACH VOLLEYBALL:\n\n7:45am: In a shock on the sand, the reigning men's gold medallists, US pair Todd Rogers and Phil Dalhausser, have been knocked out of the competition by lowly-ranked Italian duo Daniele Lupo and Paolo Nicolai 21-17, 21-19. The women's favourites, Brazilian pair Larissa Franca and Juliana Felisberta, thumped their way into the quarter-finals by beating the Dutch team of Madelein Meppelink and Sophie van Gestel 21-10, 21-17.\n\nARCHERY:\n\n7:37am: One for the humour files. We informed you earlier about South Korean Oh Jin-hyek's gold medal in the individual archery with his defeat of Japan's Takaharu Furukawa. Apparently he's been saddled with the unflattering nickname of the \"Soft Drink Pig\" due to his fondness for fizzy drinks.\n\nTENNIS:\n\n7:18am: A usually unflappable Andy Murray says he's not been able to stop smiling since beating Novak Djokovic to make the men's singles gold medal play-off against Roger Federer:\n\n\"I know how much winning tonight meant to me. It was one of the biggest matches of my career, one of the biggest wins of my career. It was one of the most emotional I've been after a match. I haven't stopped smiling since I came off the court. The atmosphere was unbelievable. We always said night matches at the US Open had the best atmosphere, but it's not even close to what it was today.\"\n\nTRACK AND FIELD:\n\n7:08am: Poland's Tomasz Majewski has retained his Olympic men's shot put title with a season's best throw of 21.89m. The 30-year-old is the first man to win the event twice since American Parry O'Brien (1952, 1956). Germany's David Stourl took silver and 2007 world champ Reese Hoffa of the US the bronze.\n\nROWING:\n\n7:05am: Our correspondent Emma Alberici (@albericie) reports that Australian rower David Booth has been sent home from the Olympics for smashing shop windows in London while drunk. Booth has apologised to the two shop owners and fronted the media to apologise to his team-mates, the Australian Olympic Committee and the country:\n\n\"The damage I caused was not motivated by any malicious intent to steal or to destroy, but was rather an emotional outburst and an inappropriate expression of my disappointment and frustrations with our result in a very close and hard-fought final.\"\n\nDo the time\n\nATHLETICS:\n\n7:00am: Ethiopian queen Tirunesh Dibaba has unleased a withering 62-second final lap to blitz the field in the women's 10,000m in 30:20.76, capturing the first track gold of the London Games. Kenyans Sally Jepkosgei Kipyego (30:26.37) and Vivian Jepkemoi Cheruiyot (30:30.44) round out the podium. Australia's Eloise Wellings finished at the back of the field.\n\n6:50am: Home favourite and 2009 world champion Jessica Ennis has a 184-point lead after the first day of the heptathlon. After clocking a world record 12.54 seconds to win the 100m hurdles in the first of the four disciplines, the 26-year-old finished off with a personal best 22.83 in the 200m sprint for a total of 4,158 points. Lithuania's Austra Skujyte (3,974) is in second position with Canada's Jessica Zelinka (3,903) third. Russia's world champion Tatyana Chernova (3,849) is in ninth position.\n\nCYCLING:\n\n6:40am: The plaudits are coming in thick and fast for the performances of the host nation at the velodrome - Team GB has won three of the four gold medals on offer so far. Says Australian silver medallist Jack Bobridge (team pursuit):\n\n\"At the end of the day, we got beat by a better team. They [did] everything perfect and they broke the world record, so you can't say anything and you can't complain. When someone does that, you have to accept it. We have to settle for silver, and we will. But hats off to Great Britain, they were perfect.\"\n\nMeanwhile, our reporter Karen Barlow has sent in another snap from the velodrome:\n\nSWIMMING:\n\n6:30am: Swimming Australia head coach Leigh Nugent said yesterday that people calling out before the race affected Melanie Schlanger in the 100m freestyle final. It seems the same happened to Eamon Sullivan in the men's 50m free:\n\n@Eamon_Sullivan: \"It's a shame spectators don't know that yelling out before the start distracts us. A few swimmers affected tonight.\"\n\nATHLETICS:\n\n6:10am: Both Mitchell Watt (7.99m) and Henry Frayne 7.95m) are through to the final of the men's long jump. With the top 12 going through, Watt was happy to settle for ninth position and didn't need his final jump. Frayne qualified in 11th. Marquise Goodwin, who won the US trials, and Brazil's world indoor champion Mauro Vinicius da Silva topped qualifying with 8.11m. However there was disaster for Panama's defending champion Irving Saladino, who relinquished his Olympic title by failing to register a jump.\n\nSWIMMING:\n\n6:05am: A disappointed Eamon Sullivan says he missed his start in finishing eighth in the men's 50m freestyle earlier.\n\n\"Again the swimming part was good, it was just the start that let me down. I was behind from the gun, which isn't a great spot to be in the 50. Tried extra hard, probably caught up a little bit but I was too far behind.\"\n\nATHLETICS:\n\n5:49pm: Henry Frayne's final effort in long jump qualifying is a 7.95m leap, placing him eighth with the top 12 to go through to the final. Mitchell Watt is currently in sixth position with one jump remaining.\n\n5:45am: Aussie Ryan Gregson has made it through to the semis of the 1,500m after running 3:38.54 to finish ninth in the faster of the two heats.\n\n5:40am: Aussie Mitchell Watt does a 7.99m in his second jump. He's not an automatic qualifier yet but should go through.\n\nTENNIS:\n\n5:37am: The Brits are guaranteed a medal in men's singles with Andy Murray upsetting Novak Djokovic to set up a gold medal showdown against world number one Roger Federer. Djokovic goes into the bronze medal match against Argentine Juan Martin del Potro, who was valiant in defeat against the Swiss earlier.\n\nCYCLING:\n\n5:35am: Our Olympics reporter Karen Barlow sent in this snap of Anna Meares preparing to race in the women's kierin earlier:\n\nSWIMMING:\n\n5:34am: It's a Dutch double in the semis with Ranomi Kromowidjojo winning semi two in 24.07. She's humbled second-placed Belarussian Aliaksandra Herasimenia (24.45). Cate Campbell's younger sister Bronte dead-heated for fourth in 24.94 but her time is not good for the final either. Disappointing.\n\n5:30am: Dutchwoman Marleen Veldhuis takes the first semi of the women's 50m free in 24.50. Australia's Cate Campbell could only manage seventh in 25.01 and won't make the final.\n\nATHLETICS:\n\n5:25am: Australia's Ryan Gregson has finished ninth in the first heat of the 1,500m in a time of 3:38.54.\n\n5:15am: Aussie Mitchell Watt fouls his first attempt in long jump qualifying.\n\nSWIMMING:\n\n5:13am: Frenchman Florent Manadudou wins gold in 21.34! American Cullen Jones grabs silver with Cielo settling for bronze. Sullivan was eighth in 21.98.\n\nWho's the Manaudou\n\n5:10am: Back to the Aquatics Centre and we've got Eamon Sullivan in lane one now in the 50m freestyle or \"splash and dash\", in case you haven't heard it called that already. World record holder Cesar Cielo of Brazil starts from lane four as the fastest qualifier.\n\nATHLETICS:\n\n5:00am: Dani Samuels gets through to the final of the discus with a throw of 63.97m. Excellent effort from the 2009 world champion. Read about it here.\n\n4:58am: Aussie Henry Frayne is leading his long jump qualifying group with a best leap of 7.82m. Countryman and one of the gold medal favourites, Mitchell Watt, is yet to compete.\n\nSWIMMING:\n\n4:56am: American Katie Ledecky wins the women's 800m freestyle final in 8:14.63, just missing out on breaking the world record. She dethrones the queen and current record holder Rebecca Adlington, who took bronze in 8:20.32 behind Mireia Belmonte Garcia of Spain (8:18.76).\n\nTRACK AND FIELD:\n\n4:53am: Australia's Melissa Breen, 21, was sixth in her 100 metres heat in 11.34 seconds to bow out. Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price took it out in 11.00. Read about it here.\n\n4:46am: Dani Samuels is in eighth position in discus qualifying with one more throw to go. Her second throw was a foul.\n\nCYCLING:\n\n4:45am: Anna Meares was at a bit of a loss to explain her kierin defeat when she spoke with Channel Nine:\n\n\"I got squeezed quite significantly with 200 metres to go and it just zapped all my speed unfortunately. I've got time bounce back for the sprint... I've got time to get over it and get ready.\"\n\nSWIMMING:\n\n4:42am: Another three-peat for Michael Phelps! His 17th Olympic gold and 21st overall comes in the 100m butterfly, his last ever individual swim at an Olympics. Astonishingly, he was seventh at the turn. South Africa's Chad le Clos and Russia's Evgeny Korotyshkin dead-heated for the silver medal. Milorad Cavic, famously pipped by 0.01 of a second by Phelps in Beijing, went out hard but faded to finish fourth.\n\nNumber 21\n\n4:36am: American superstar Missy Franklin takes gold in the 200m backstroke in a world record of 2:04.06. Australia's Meagen Nay finishes fifth in 2:07.43. Russian Anastasia Zueva took the silver with Franklin's countrywoman Elizabeth Beisel snaring bronze.\n\nRecord breaker\n\n4:29am: Well, the Night Watchman is handing over to the capable hands of Joel \"Jay Zee\" Zander, who has plans to take you through the remainder of Day Seven. Hopefully there are some medals for Australia in the pool.\n\nTRACK AND FIELD:\n\n4:24am: Keep an eye out for Mitchell Watt and Henry Frayne coming up later this morning (AEST) in the men's long jump qualifying round. Watt, the world outdoor silver medallist, and Frayne, the world indoor silver medallist, are both coached by jumps guru Gary Bourne.\n\n4:19am: Dani Samuels has started in the qualifying round of the women's discus - 60.02 metres with her first throw.\n\nCYCLING:\n\n4:06am: More gold to the Brits - Victoria Pendleton just gets home to win the women's keirin final. More disappointment for Australia - Anna Meares was never in the sprint and finished fifth.\n\nTRACK AND FIELD:\n\n4:01am: Australia's Brendan Cole impressed on Olympic debut to qualify for the men's 400 metres hurdles semi-final on day one of the track and field program in London. Not surprisingly, he is a little excited.\n\n@Brendan_Cole: \"Thanks so much for all the good wishes, tweeps! I reckon I might have another play at the Olympsies tomorrow!\"\n\nCYCLING:\n\n3:45am: Spare a thought for Anna Meares - she has to face off against Victoria Pendleton in the women's keirin final only minutes after the British national anthem was sung to mark the medal presentation for men's team pursuit. If there is anyone who can show cool nerves it is Meares.\n\n3:32am: SILVER TO AUSTRALIA! The quartet of Jack Bobridge, Glenn O'Shea, Rohan Dennis and Michael Hepburn finish second to Great Britain in the men's team pursuit final. Congratulations to the Brits on another gold and world record of 3:51.659.\n\n3:26am: It's raining medals for our friends across the ditch - New Zealand wins bronze in the men's team pursuit. Australia v Great Britain racing for gold now coming up.\n\nTENNIS:\n\n3:24am: Serena Williams' love affair will Wimbledon continues after she beat world number one Victoria Azarenka in their singles semi-final, 6-1, 6-2. That sets up a meeting with Maria Sharapova in the gold medal match.\n\nCYCLING:\n\n3:05am: No surprises but it will be Meares v Pendleton again as the highlight act in the keirin final with the Briton easily progressing from the second round.\n\n3:00am: Anna Meares advances to the final of the women's keirin. She wins her second-round heat with British rival Victoria Pendleton coming up in the second heat.\n\n2:51am: NEW WORLD RECORD!

Check out our wrap of the action here.\n\n10.11pm: It's been a big morning at the rowing, with one silver and one bronze medal going to the Australian crews.

That is a vital win, and could make a huge difference in Australia's path to the medals next week.\n\n9.51pm: The Opals are in a tight one at the women's basketball. Inside the final minute, it's Australia 68, Russia 66.

He spoke after the event.\n\nI'm happy with how I shot, the score just didn't turn out. It took a while to settle down into my usual rhythm.

New Zealand has overtaken Australia in the gold medal tally, with a win in the men's pair by world champion crew Eric Murray and Hamish Bond.

Australia's men's quad scull crew has come third in the final, behind Germany and Croatia. The time was five minutes 45.22 seconds, behind Germany's 5:42.48.

The wind was a little tricky but that happens in match play. I love match play - it's my favourite. I am happy because this is my first time at the Olympics, this is my first major experience.\n\nI will meet friends and family back home and rest. Then I'll need to sit down and re-set my goals, but I would like to go for Rio (2016 Olympics).\n\n8.20pm: Australia's Brendan Cole has had a great start to the men's 400m hurdles.

One gets the feeling it has been a bit of a distraction:\n\nIt's good that it's finally here now and I can stop getting asked those questions and move on with my job.\n\nIt's a great honour, Mark Hager (the previous record goalscorer) was a role model of mine. To be the all-time leading goalscorer for my country is a privilege.\n\n7.46pm: A little later, South Australian schoolboy Jarrod Poort will swim in the 1500m freestyle heats. Poort was the last swimmer added to the Olympic team. He broke his personal best by 11 seconds at the Olympic trials, but it was not enough for automatic qualification. His presence continues Australia's unbroken participation in the long-distance event at every Games since London in 1948.\n\n7.41pm: Jessica Ennis has sent the crowd into a frenzy at the Olympic Stadium - she has run a world's best time of 12.54 seconds in the opening event of the heptathlon, the 100m hurdles. In comparison, Australian world champion Sally Pearson's best time this year in the 100m hurdles is 12.40 seconds. Not a bad start.\n\n7.37pm: And just like that, Taylor Worth's Olympics are over! His Chinese opponent shot a nine-pointer, but Worth's last arrow drifted wide into the eight section, giving victory to Xiaoxiang Dai. Well done to Worth, however, he has had an amazing run through the elimination rounds.\n\n7.34pm: It's happening again at Lord's! Taylor Worth had a chance to take his match againsts China's Xiaoxiang Dai by winning the fifth set, but he fell just short, and now it is off to a one-arrow shootoff!\n\n7.30pm: Grandstand's Peter Walsh has reminded us about a phenomenal men's basketball match which happened last night, London time. The United States scored a phenomenal 78 points in the first half alone, going on to beat Nigeria by 156-73. The score was the highest match score in Olympic basketball history. So, who needs the old Dream Team anyway?\n\n7.26pm: At the Olympic Stadium, Australia's Dale Stevenson has had his first of three qualifying throws in the men's shot put. Stevenson threw 18.38m, well short of the automatic qualifying mark of 20.65m.\n\n7.23pm: We have a delay at the rowing.

Bronte finished in 24.87 seconds, and Cate touched the wall in 24.94.\n\n7.03pm: According to Grandstand's David Morrow, there are extraordinary scenes at the Olympic Stadium, with a capacity 85,000 crowd in place for the first session of competition, all (or most of them) there to see Britain's gold medal hope in the heptathlon, Jessica Ennis. Ennis' battle with 2011 world champion Tatyana Chernova of Russia will be a highlight of days one and two.\n\n7.00pm: It is chaos at the hockey! Australia conceded a penalty corner with three minutes left and Argentina's Gonzalo Peillat scored to make it 2-2. Argentina looked like the team had another penalty corner a minute later but it was overturned. A frantic final two minutes ensued, and after the siren sounded, both teams began arguing with the umpire over a series of controversial decisions. That is a draw, a poor result for the Australians, who have let a 2-0 lead slip.\n\n6.48pm: If anyone can explain how the men's hockey match between Australia and Argentina is still 2-1, please let us know. Every 30 seconds or so there is a new attack, with both sides having clear chances to add to the scoreline. Somehow they keep missing, Australia's Glenn Turner being the latest culprit. It could be a long few minutes at the Riverbank Arena before the end.\n\n6.45pm: We are 15 minutes away from the women's 50m freestyle heats at the Aquatic Centre, where sisters Bronte and Cate Campbell are drawn in the same heat for Australia. Cate Campbell will be far from 100 per cent after missing her 100m freestyle swim earlier in the week with a bout of gastro. Hopefully she will have enough of her strength back to make it through to the semi-finals, which start at 5.25am AEST tomorrow morning.\n\n6.40pm: Later on at 8.15pm AEST, the Opals take on Russia in a battle for second spot in Group B of the women's basketball. A win would set Australia up to play the third-ranked team from Group A in the quarter-finals, which at the moment would mean Turkey.\n\n6.33pm: It's end to end stuff at the Riverbank Arena, with Australia and Argentina having multiple chances to add to the score. The Kookaburras just had a stunning shot come back off the upright, but the Argentinians are proving dangerous as well. It's still 2-1, with a little over 20 minutes left.\n\n6.30pm: There are three Australian crews in the rowing A finals tonight. The men's quad scull crew of Chris Morgan, Karsten Forsterling, James McRae and Dan Noonan are on at 7.10pm AEST, followed by Brodie Buckland and James Marburg in the final of the men's pair at 7.20pm, and Kim Crow and Brooke Pratley in the women's double scull final at 7.50pm. All three are chances for medals, with Crow and Pratley in the best form of the lot.\n\n6.22pm: It's game on at the hockey! Argentina have scored, it's the first time Australia has conceded a goal at the Olympics. The score is back to 2-1 to the Kookaburras with half an hour left.\n\n6.20pm: The first event on the track and field program this evening at the Olympic Stadium is the men's shot put, with Australian Dale Stevenson attempting to reach the final.

The first arrow will be fired at 7.18pm AEST.\n\n6.10pm: The Kookaburras have finally scored a second goal after wasting a series of chances. Right on half-time, Australia's Jamie Dwyer popped up to score, making him the Kookaburra's all-time leading scorer. Nice one, Jamie. It's 2-0 at the break.\n\n5.58pm: Glenn Turner causing havoc on the right flank creating a number of chances but the Kookaburras unable to extend their lead with less than ten minutes to go before the break.\n\n5.50pm: The next Aussie in action is Warren Potent in the 50m prone rifle shooting.

Rey Lucas has his effort from a penalty corner well saved. The referee awarded another. Australia appealed but the decision was upheld. The Kookaburras have no more appeals.\n\n5.33pm: We're underway in the hockey and already the Kookaburras are peppering the Argentina goal."
