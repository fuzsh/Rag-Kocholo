        "text": "Is olc an ghaoth nach séideann do dhuine éigin\n\nOK. OK. OK.\n\nI admit it.\n\nI am just as bad as predicting the winners of sailing regattas as I am at sailing in them.\n\nAs of now I seem to be only 1 for 3 in predicting who will do well in the singlehanded classes at the Olympic regatta.\n\nThe one I got right was Slingo in the Lasers. After 4 races, Tom Slingsby of Australia is leading the standings but he only has a 4 point lead over Pavlos Kontides of Cyprus who won both races today. Who? Sorry. Never heard of him, but I see he was in the top ten at the 2010 and 2011 Worlds. Only 22 years old. Good for him.\n\nBut based on results so far, I was totally wrong in my prediction that Big Ben Ainslie would dominate the Finn class. He has been completely upstaged by Jonas Hogh-Christensen of Denmark who has beaten Ben in all 6 races so far and leads him by 10 points. That virtual person Noodle who only exists in some imaginary reality Second Life is virtually peeing her virtual pants with virtual excitement about Jonas. With only 4 races left until the medal race, Big Ben is going to have to turn on the jets if he is going to win a gold medal this year. It's going to be interesting.\n\nIn the Radials I hedged my bets and implied that the Olympic regatta was going to be a closely fought competition between a group of women who have all been doing well internationally in the last year or two. I didn't expect anyone to dominate the regatta. Wrong! Surprising all the pundits (well surprising me anyway) Annalise Murphy of Ireland has won every single one of the 4 races held so far. Trailing by 12 and 14 points in 2nd and 3rd are the ladies from Belgium and the Netherlands whom I did pick as favorites. And Alison Young of Great Britain whom I also picked is only 3 points further back in 4th.\n\nPause for patriotic singing of Jerusalem, God Save the Queen, Hey Jude, celebrations of the industrial revolution, the National Health Service, the World Wide Web and Mary Poppins, and a sketch by Mr. Bean... and frenzied chants of \"GBR GBR GBR!\"\n\nOh sorry. Got carried away a bit there. Still haven't got over that opening ceremony.\n\nWhere was I? Where am I? Oh yes, Annalise Murphy from Ireland.\n\nTo be fair I did sorta kinda give her a tip of the hat as one of \"a few others I could mention... who probably also have a good shot at a medal this year.\" Let me honor her properly in this post by including a couple of pictures of her too.\n\nAs sailors say in Ireland, \"Is olc an ghaoth nach séideann do dhuine éigin.\"\n\nIt's an ill wind that doesn't blow somebody some good.\n\nTaking the Rough with the Smooth\n\nWell, it's been a quiet couple of weeks in Lake Wobegon...\n\nA few of my Laser sailing friends from Massachusetts who mainly sail on an inland lake have been hankering after some sailing in waves. They tried Buzzards Bay but they said the buzzard was dead. I told them the buzzard wasn't dead, he was just resting. But I also talked up the excellent waves that you can experience at the mouth of the Sakonnet River, either launching from Third Beach Newport (not actually in Newport) or Sakonnet Harbor Little Compton (actually in Little Compton.)\n\nSo one afternoon just over a couple of weeks ago when the wind was in the south I drove down to Little Compton to check out the conditions, but the wind was only about 6-8 knots. There was certainly some swell coming in from the ocean (nothing between here and Cuba) but it was just a little too small to be able to catch any decent rides downwind. It was big enough to need some attention to the waves upwind and big enough to rock the boat on a run, and I kept feeling that if it were just a little more windy I would have caught rides. Maybe lighter people would have done so. It was a very pleasant afternoon but probably not exciting enough for my friends to drive all the way down there from Massachusetts.\n\nI tried again on Monday last week and had more success. The swells from the ocean and the wind were lined up pretty well. The wind was a little stronger than on my earlier visit, whitecaps just breaking on the tops of the waves, so I'm guessing it was around 11-12 knots, The swells were also bigger, about 2-3 feet compared with 1 foot the previous time. It all added up to ideal wave practice conditions.\n\nThe waves weren't so big that you caught every one every time anyway downwind - you had to work at it a bit. But one well-timed pump and you took off. I found myself moving forwards and backwards in the boat a lot - forwards to help the boat down the face of each wave and then back to stop it submarining into the back of the next one. You had to have your wits about you as the swells weren't totally regular. Sailing by the lee I was going straight down the waves for the most part but occasionally one would come at a different angle and I could catch a ride by heading up on to it quickly. Upwind I really had to work the boat hard with body movements to stop the boat crashing on each wave. Great workout! So I think the next time the winds are forecast to be from the south and this strong or stronger on a weekend I will encourage my friends to give it a shot.\n\nOn Tuesday the winds were from the west and around 10-15 knots so I headed over to Colt State Park in Bristol. On the drive over the weather radio was talking about a Severe Thunderstorm Watch for the area. But, hey, that just means you have to keep a watch out, right? The sky was clear when I launched but after sailing for 20 minutes or so the sky started to get darker and darker from the north and the wind picked up. By the time I had sailed back to the boat ramp the wind was around 25-30 knots and big juicy waves were crashing on to the ramp. It was a challenge getting the boat back on to the dolly by myself on a lee shore in those conditions but somehow I managed it. I turned on the weather radio in the car and it was talking about a nearby storm which had the possibility of 60 mph winds and giant hailstones not to mention continuous cloud to ground lightning. Actually I never saw anything like that but decided that discretion was the better part of the valor and headed home for a quiet dinner with Tillerwoman.\n\nOn Wednesday the front had gone through, the winds were in the north, the humidity was low, and the sun was shining so I went over to Bristol again and launched from Independence Park. What a superb day! It was probably one of the most delightful days of the summer. I sailed out of the harbor and around Hog Island and back upwind again. There was just enough wind to need to hike. There were hardly any other sailing boats out on the bay and I kept thinking, \"This is why I retired - to be able to go sailing on days like this.\"\n\nThis weekend, three of the Tiller Extensions are staying at our house.\n\nIt's been a quiet week in Lake Wobegon.\n\nLife is good.\n\nLaser Girls Kick Ass\n\nIf it's easy to pick the favorites in the Finn and Laser classes at the Olympics this year, it's impossible to be so definite about the women in the Laser Radial event. There's a fairly large group of ladies who have been doing well in all the big international regattas over the last year, but no single sailor has been dominating the Radial class the way that Big Ben and Slingo have doing in the Finns and Lasers.\n\nThere's Marit Bouwmeester from the Netherlands who was the 2011 World Champion, but couldn't do better than fifth at this year's Worlds and Sail for Gold.\n\nMarit Bouwmeester\n\nThere's Evi Van Acker from Belgium who was second to Marit at the 2011 Worlds, and who has been in the top three at pretty well very major event she has sailed in the last year. But she slipped to sixth at Sail for Gold in Weymouth last month.\n\nEvi Van Acker\n\nAnd you can never ignore Lijia Xu from China, the Olympic bronze medallist in 2008, second in this year's Worlds, and the winner in major regattas at Miami, Hyeres and Melbourne in the last year.\n\nLijia Xu\n\nThe Olympic silver medalist from 2008 is also returning this year. Gintare Volungeviciute Scheidt from Lithuania won the 2012 World Championship in Germany a couple of months ago. And if that last name sounds familiar, yes she is also Mrs Robert Scheidt, so she probably gets lots of Laser go-faster tips in her pillow talk.\n\nGintare Volungeviciute Scheidt\n\nThe gold medalist in the Radials in 2008 was, of course, Anna Tunnicliffe who is representing the USA as part of the women's match racing team this year. Judging by this photo from the ESPN The Magazine: Bodies We Want 2012 feature, Anna is still pretty hot in a Radial.\n\nAnna Tunnicliffe\n\nSari Multala of Finland is one of the most experienced sailors in the fleet. She was fifth in the women's singlehanded class at both the Sydney and Athens Olympics, Radial World Champion in 2009 and 2010, and is definitely on form again this year with a third at the Worlds and second at Sail for Gold.\n\nSari Multala\n\nUpdate: July 28. The original photo I posted was not of Sari Multala and has been replaced by the one above..\n\nAnd let's not forget Alison Young of Great Britain who took first place at Sail for Gold in Weymouth last month. Maybe she has peaked at just the right time?\n\nAlison Young\n\nPause for patriotic singing of God Save the Queen and frenzied chants of \"GBR GBR GBR!\"\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nPaige Railey of USA may not have had quite the stellar results in the last year or so as the women above, but look at this face. Wow! Does she want it bad? Do not underestimate this lady.\n\nPaige Railey\n\nAnd there are a few other I could mention, like Annalise Murphy of Ireland And Krystal Weir of Australia, who probably also have a good shot at a medal this year.\n\nIt's going to be interesting...\n\nBlue Water, Green Skipper: Book Review\n\nThis book is described on the front cover as \"A Memoir of Sailing Alone Across the Atlantic.\" My main issue with the book is that it is nothing of the kind. Truth in advertising!\n\nStuart Woods is apparently a bestselling author although I confess I haven't read any of his books before. In 1976, as a relatively inexperienced sailor, he sailed in the OSTAR solo transatlantic race. (The book was originally published in 1977 and is now being re-published.) This book claims to be his story of the race.\n\nWhen I was asked to review the book I must admit I thought I would enjoy it more. I am a single-handed racer too (although in a somewhat smaller boat than Stuart's). The idea that someone would learn to sail in dinghies and then immediately take on the challenge of a transatlantic race appealed to me. If things had taken a different turn in my life I could imagine myself doing that.\n\nI did find the first few chapters fascinating, and highly amusing in parts, as our hero learns to sail in dinghies on the west coast of Ireland. In the process he manages to make all the same mistakes that all of us did. He starts off in Mirror dinghies and goes off to the Irish National Championships where he and his mate won the prize for being the oldest and heaviest crew.\n\nThen he discovers the joys of cruising and racing in small yachts, and when his grandfather dies and leaves him some money, Stuart hatches the idea of buying a yacht and entering the OSTAR.\n\nSo far so good. But, for me the book got considerably less interesting from this point on. This book is NOT about racing in the OSTAR. Only the last 40 or so pages are about the actual race. From the point where Stuart hatches the idea of entering the OSTAR to the day when he actually crosses the start line of the race there are about 200 pages of how Stuart prepared for the race. I found this section very dull.\n\nThey say that cruising is just another word for doing \"boat maintenance in exotic locations.\" Well, if you believe this book, racing in the OSTAR is all about doing boat maintenance in not very exotic locations. If you are interested in all the things that can go wrong with a boat and how to fix them, then I guess this book might appeal to you.\n\nStuart orders a boat. Stuart goes sailing on some other boats. Stuart goes sailing on his own boat. Stuff breaks. The boat leaks. Stuff gets mended. The boat still leaks. More stuff breaks. More stuff gets mended. The boat still leaks. Then Stuart pulls something in his back and is in excruciating pain! I have to confess I actually enjoyed that bit. Not because I took any pleasure in Stuart's pain but because it was actually something I could relate to at last. Human interest! Much better than broken gearboxes, failed navigation lights and all the problems he had with something called a Dynafurl.\n\nIn the acknowledgements section at the start of the book, Stuart says that he believes he has mentioned everyone who helped his project in the text of the book. Too right he did! That's another problem I have with the middle 200 pages of this book. Name after name of people and companies who worked on his boat or gave him a sextant or helped him fix that damned Dynafurl. The whole bloody section reads like an acknowledgement section at times. And who reads them?\n\nSo I was excited when Stuart finally solved most of the issues with his boat and crossed the start line of the race. I love races. Strategy, tactics, close tussles with other competitors.\n\nAnd so it was just after the start. But soon our hero is on his own in the middle of the Atlantic and stuff starts to break again. His engine won't start which apparently is a major problem in a sailing race like this because without his engine he can't charge his batteries. And without his batteries he can't use his VHF radio or his navigation lights, or his instruments or other quite useful stuff like the stereo system.\n\nThen stuff started growing in his drinking water. Then his eggs went bad. Then his radar reflector fell off. One of his shrouds came loose and had to be reattached.\n\nThen while he was playing with the bloody Dynafurl again he broke the forestay. Uh oh. More frigging boat maintenance ensued - something to do with stopping the mast falling down involving a Barlow, a pad-eye, a deck-eye, a reefing line, a clevis pin, a split pin and a very large screwdriver. I didn't understand a word of it, but it all sounded very exciting if you're into that kind of thing.\n\nEventually our hero reaches Newport and crosses the finish line. Phew!\n\nSo sorry, not my kind of book. If you are into stories about what can break on a boat and how to fix it you might like it more.\n\nIt's probably too late now but I do have one suggestion for the author. He seems to be a very charming chap, and from time to time he mentions in passing that he calls some lady or other and she drops everything and comes and stays with him for a few days while he works on his boat or hassles other people to work on his boat. I lost track of how many times he did this with different ladies because, as best as I can recall, all of the ladies had names beginning with A. We never get much detail about his relationships with these ladies but I was always intrigued to know more.\n\nSo this would be my advice on how to make this a better book: Less boat maintenance. More sex.\n\nWhen Daddy Was a Little Boy...\n\nContinuing the story of Sailing with Grandkids...\n\nSo we all went off to the lake last Saturday. Two Laser sailors - me and my son, the blogger formerly known as Litoralis; my two eldest grandkids, Emily (6) and Aidan (4 years and 1 day); and Tillerwoman.\n\nConversations since that day have elucidated that Tillerwoman thought the kids were only going to watch Litoralis and me sailing. But I had no doubt in my mind that we were going to offer the kids the opportunity to come sailing with us (for the first time ever in their young lives) and that there was a pretty damn good chance that they would actually do it.\n\nWhen we arrived at the lake, Aidan saw a Laser with the mast up and made some remark about how tall it was and how that must be \"much bigger than your boat Granddad.\" It then dawned on me that although the kids had known for ever that Granddad was a sailor and that Daddy has a Laser under the deck (which hardly ever sees the water) these kids had not grown up hanging around yacht clubs. I'm not sure they have ever actually seen a rigged Laser before.\n\nSo, while Tillerwoman took the kids for a tour of the waterfront, Litoralis and I rigged our boats.\n\nAidan watched.\n\nHis face says it all. He's not sure what to expect but he's darned if he's going to miss out on some fun that his big sister is going to have.\n\nI was ready to launch first and asked Emily if she wanted to come and sail with me.\n\nOf course she said yes. I knew she would.\n\nI said the words that are a catchphrase in our family, \"When Daddy was a little boy....\"\n\nThe kids always cringe when they hear these words from me. They expect that I am going to tell the story (for only about the 429th time) of when we took their father camping in Spain when he was one year old and how he ate too many grapes and of the unfortunate and painful gastric consequences of his intemperance (which we don't need to describe in detail here.)\n\nSo now I say those words at every opportunity just to watch their little faces crumple up in pain as they remember the story about Daddy's dreadfully distressing grape indulgence outcome ... I really am a very bad Granddad!\n\nBut today I had a very different story about when Daddy was a little boy. About how he and his brother used to sit in front of the mast of my Laser and how they used to have sooooo much fun sailing with me in France.\n\nSo I lifted Emily on to the bow of my Laser and showed her where to sit and how to hold on to the mast. I rocked the boat a little just to give her a feel for how it would move while we were sailing and make sure she was comfortable. She hung on to the mast with grim determination.\n\nBut I think she was happy with the arrangement. It really is much better than being in the cockpit and getting tangled up with the sheet and with that crazy long tiller extension and getting trodden on by Granddad every time he tacks or gybes.\n\nSo we sailed off to the the middle of the lake.\n\nI pointed out the other Lasers racing and then we sailed towards the north end of the lake. I reminded her that that was where the public beach that she had visited several times was. We came close to a couple of Sunfish sailors out having fun and watched them for a while.\n\nThen she spotted something down the southern end of the lake that she wanted to see. Some kind of beach club by the look of it. As we sailed more she relaxed and released her death grip on the mast. She splashed her feet in the water and laughed at the effect.\n\nWe hit a bit of a lull and she told me she wanted to go faster. I took this as a good sign, but gave here a boring lecture on gusts and wind lines and all that stuff anyway. She splashed her feet in the water some more.\n\nThen she saw that her father and brother were out sailing too and wanted to sail over and see them. So we did. Aidan looked just as happy as Emily. Then she told me she wanted to \"race Daddy.\" I took this as a very good sign.\n\nSo we raced Litoralis and Aidan for a while and I gave her another boring lecture about how I was using the bad air off my sails to slow them down but she seemed to be having enormous fun in spite of that.\n\nWe sailed near the other half dozen Lasers doing informal races and I asked her if she wanted to join in with their races. She said yes. I took this as a very, very good sign.\n\nI did my best to explain to her the race course and where the start/ finish line was. I lined up outside the start line and let the other boats go off first. Didn't want to spook Emily by getting involved in any of the usual start line mayhem.\n\nI did the usual lake sailing stuff - tack on the headers, go for the puffs - and we ended up in fourth place out of eight boats at the windward mark. I was pretty pleased with that but she wanted to know how her father and brother were doing. I looked around. \"They're last,\" I told her. She seemed pleased about that.\n\nDownwind I didn't pull up the daggerboard because she was sitting on the daggerboard shockcord. And I didn't do my usual extreme windward heel because I didn't want her to fall off the boat. But we maintained our position and we rounded the leeward mark in fourth.\n\n\"How's Daddy doing?\"\n\n\"He's still in last place.\"\n\nBig smile. Her. Not me.\n\nUp the second beat I pointed out that if we could just pass that yellow boat, we would finish third. Not too shabby considering our late start and carrying a crew and not being able to sail properly downwind. So I did the usual lake sailing stuff - tack on the headers, go for the puffs - and we did pass the yellow boat and we were third. Not at all shabby considering.\n\n\"How's Daddy doing?\"\n\n\"He's still in last place.\"\n\nShe seemed extraordinarily happy about that.\n\nBy now we had been sailing for about an hour. She was having fun. She was relaxed. She was enjoying sailing.\n\nMission accomplished.\n\nBut she had had enough, so we went in.\n\nI don't know if last Saturday was the best day of my life so far, but it was pretty damn close.\n\nSailing with Grandkids - The Hook\n\nI don't know if last Saturday deserves the title of \"Best Day of My Life So Far\" but it comes pretty damn close.\n\nRegular readers of this blog will know that the two passions of my life are my sailing and my grandchildren. You have followed the ups and downs of my spectacularly incompetent Laser racing life; and you have read all the stories about (and looked at all the pictures of) my four grandchildren, Emily, Aidan, Owen and Isabel.\n\nOh yes. Sailing and grandchildren.\n\nIt's no secret that I've been looking forward to the day when I could go sailing with my grandkids. But I haven't pushed it. There's no way that I wanted to be pressuring the kids to do anything they didn't really want to do, and in any case whether or not the kids should participate in any activity is really up to the parents, not the grandparents.\n\nSo I have waited patiently and watched as the two older kids especially have had fun in the water, and learned to swim. I've always felt that before kids go sailing in small boats they should have learned that playing in the water is all about having fun; and that they should be totally confident in, on, around, and even under the water.\n\nOK. Maybe I didn't just wait patiently. Maybe I did nudge things along a little bit. Like when I used to whisper subliminal messages to my grandkids when they were babies about how much they would enjoy sailing with Granddad one day when they were older. Or when I used to play with Emily (now six) when she was two years old in the backyard pool at the house she used to live in. Or when I bought Aidan (who turned four last week) presents such as model boats to build and a water slide for the back lawn.\n\nAidan splashing into the pool at the end of his new water slide\n\nLate last week I still had no idea how this weekend was going to turn out, or even where I was going to go sailing. I was planning to sail the Newport Regatta at one point, but other family plans meant that we ended up staying over at my son's house in Massachusetts on Friday night. So I took my Laser with me intending to meet up on Saturday with some friends for some casual racing at Lake Massapoag instead.\n\nI thought I was going to be doing that on my own. The rest of the family including the kids had other plans. But those plans fell through.\n\nSo, after lunch on Saturday I played a board game with Emily, and then she said she wanted me to make a collage with her. (She's very much into arts and crafts. She gets that from Tillerwoman.)\n\nI said I was sorry but that I was going sailing and needed to start getting ready to go.\n\n\"Can I come with you?\" she asked.\n\nWow. That was a shocker. She had never been to this sailing club before. Never expressed directly any interest in sailing with me before. But my years of dropping bait had finally worked. She wanted to go sailing. It was her idea.\n\n\"Sure you can, if your Dad says it's OK,\" I replied.\n\nTo cut a long story short, it was quickly decided that my son would bring his Laser to the lake too, and that both Emily and Aidan would come sailing with us.\n\nWow. The day I had been waiting for had arrived!\n\nSo off we all went to the lake....\n\n(To be continued.)\n\nUnplugged\n\nI sailed my Laser three times last week.\n\nOn Monday I launched from Colt State Park in Bristol by myself and sailed over towards Barrington on Upper Narragansett Bay. The winds were pretty light so I worked on keeping my head out of the boat and looking for shifts and puffs, and judging lay lines to various buoys posing as windward marks, all of which I usually suck at but didn't seem too awful at on Monday. Then I practiced some roll tacks and roll gybes and proved to my satisfaction that I still suck at them.\n\nOn Thursday I thought I had arranged a group sail at noon for four sailors out of Independence Park at Bristol, But apparently I also suck at using Facebook. I didn't know that a response of \"Boo.... OK\" to my invitation doesn't actually mean, \"That's not my first choice of venue but I will be there.\" And I didn't know that a response of, \"That's good,\" doesn't actually mean, \"I am coming.\" Facebook is a mysterious world for people over 60.\n\nSo in the end it was me and the esteemed blogger Captain Judy of the famous Center of Effort blog. Apparently when Judy says, \"I'll be there,\" it actually means, \"I'll be there.\" We did a long downwind sail down the length of the harbor and out to Mount Hope Bridge. We sailed the angles. We dueled with wind shadows. It was all good.\n\nThen we saw how fast the tide was sweeping us past the Hog Island Lighthouse so we turned around and did a long upwind race, playing the shifts, trying to work out whether it was best to go inshore to avoid the tide or to go for more pressure away from the shore. It was all good.\n\nI thought my boat speed was OK, holding my own with this renowned coach. But then as Judy pulled her boat up the beach I noticed that her transom drain plug was hanging out and water was pouring out of her hull. She claimed that it had been like that all the time we had been sailing. Huh? I had spent the last two hours just barely keeping up with a Laser with its hull full of water? My boat speed must really suck.\n\n(Or had she pulled it out seconds before we hit the beach just to psych me out?)\n\nThen on Sunday I headed over to Massapoag Yacht Club in Sharon, Massachusetts and joined the Laser fleet there for their regular Sunday afternoon racing. What a scene. Friendly crowd of people, 12 Lasers out racing that day, and good winds.\n\nMaybe my solo session on Monday had done some good because I felt really \"in the zone.\" It was one of those days when I always seemed to hit the shifts just right and arrive at the windward mark in the lead, or at least with the leaders. Downwind it was important to look for the gusts and get in front of them, which I almost always managed to do.\n\nIn the first three races I scored 1,2,1 but then I ran out of steam and chose to sit out the final race.\n\nApparently my boat speed and my strategy at sailing shifts don't totally suck.\n\nBut my stamina totally does. Hey, I'm pushing 70, you know.\n\nLife is good. (It's better than the alternative.)\n\nI think I'll take a nap now."
