        "text": "Cyprus (CYP) has sent athletes to every Olympic Games held since 1980.\n\nCyprus earned its first Olympic medal in the 2012 Summer Olympics. Pavlos Kontides earned a silver medal in the men's laser sailing event.\n\nThey almost won a medal in the 2008 Olympics when Antonis Nikolaidis lost the bronze medal shoot-off in men's skeet. The first athlete from Cyprus in the modern Olympics was Anastasios Andreou in 1896. He competed under the Greek flag. At this time, Cyprus was a British colony. The olympics does not recognise Northern Cyprus and Turkish Cypriots are unable to participate.\n\nRelated pages\n\nList of IOC country codes\n\nSee also"
