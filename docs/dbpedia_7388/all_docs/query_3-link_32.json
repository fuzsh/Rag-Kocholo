Slingsby, who led the entire regatta, covered Kontides the entire race and won the gold.\n\nCyprus, an island nation in the Mediterranean Sea, started taking part in the modern-day Olympics at the 1980 Moscow Games.\n\n‘I guess I wrote my name in Cyprus sport in golden letters,’ Kontides said. ‘I guess when I have the silver medal around my neck and be back home, then all the celebrations will start, and I will really understand what I have done.’\n\nCyprus President Dimitris Christofias congratulated Kontides by telephone Saturday, when the silver medal was assured. Christofias conveyed his gratitude and that of all Cypriots for his ‘immense success,’ an official statement said.\n\nThe Cyprus Sport Organization said Kontides’ silver medal ‘marks a new beginning for Cypriot sport.’\n\nKontides said on the Cyprus Sailing Federation website that he was inspired by his father, himself a Cypriot sailing champion and former federation chief, to take up the sport at age 9.\n\nHis mother, Androulla Kontides, told a TV station: ‘He’s made us all proud. He’s a talented boy, and we always believed that he could do it.’\n\nOriginally Published: August 6, 2012 at 10:47 p.m."
