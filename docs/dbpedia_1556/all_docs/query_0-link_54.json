Their early material has been compared by critics to the blues rock of Deep Purple, but they slowly began moving toward a more commercially accessible rock style.[1] By the turn of the decade, the band's commercial fortunes changed and they released a string of UK top 10 albums, Ready an' Willing (1980), Come an' Get It (1981), Saints & Sinners (1982) and Slide It In (1984), the latter of which was their first to chart in the US and is certified 2x platinum.\n\nThe band's 1987 self-titled album was their most commercially successful worldwide, and contained two major US hits, \"Here I Go Again\" and \"Is This Love\", reaching number one and two on the Hot 100.
