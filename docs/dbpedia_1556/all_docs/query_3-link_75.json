        "text": "1. Guns n' Roses - 'Appetite for Destruction'\n\n(1987)\n\nThe Gunners’ debut stuck out like a sore appendage among the blow-dried hairdressers’ convention of the mid-‘80s, when acts like Bon Jovi, Poison, Europe, Warrant and Nelson travestied the good name of metal.\n\nAppetite hit those wussies like a scud missile. Guns N’ Roses embodied danger and charisma, rejoicing in glam-punk cred (‘Paradise City’ was a blatant tribute to Finnish gods Hanoi Rocks), and scuzzy songs about smack and urban paranoia (‘Mr Brownstone’, ‘Welcome To The Jungle’). The band could even turn their collective hand to classic Aerosmith/Lizzy-esque radio rock on ‘Sweet Child O’ Mine’, with its unforgettably liquidic opening riff. For about five minutes there, G&R were the latest, greatest bad-ass rock ‘n’ roll band in the world. Then they blew it in a mess of Las Vegas glitz, costume changes and back-up singers. Cheers Axl. 2. AC/DC - 'Back In Black'\n\n(1980)\n\nIn a word, awesome. The opening bars of AC/DC’s comeback album (following the death of original singer Bon Scott), are amongst the most filthily lascivious musical moments this side of a Howlin’ Wolf cut. Mutt Lange’s muscular production (that drum sound, those rhythm guitars), Brian Johnson’s pig-squeal vocals and songs like ‘You Shook Me All Night Long’ and ‘Hell’s Bells’ ensured that this would be the Aussie combo’s finest hour. 3. Motorhead - 'No Sleep Til Hammersmith'\n\n(1981)\n\nIt was neck and neck between this and Ace Of Spades, but Hammersmith inches it because it’s essentially a greatest hits set played with astonishing power and speed (just listen to Philthy’s fills): ‘Overkill’, ‘Bomber’, ‘We Are The Road Crew’… M’head were (and still are) a glorious fusion of unpretentious metallic wallop and scuzz-punk brutality. 4. Led Zepplin- 'Led Zepplin IV'\n\n(1971)\n\nPicking one Zep album was always going to be something of a Sophie's Choice, but in the end, IV shades it on account of sheer sonic impact (‘Rock ‘N’ Roll’, ‘Black Dog’, ‘When The Levee Breaks’), innovation (‘The Battle Of Evermore’, Plant’s spellbinding duet with Sandy Denny), plus the small matter of a wee tune called ‘Stairway To Heaven’. 5. Queens Of The Stone Age - 'Songs For The Deaf'\n\n(2002)\n\nFuck posterity – a record doesn’t have to be 30 years old to be deemed a metal classic. SFTD is the Queens’ tour de force, a demented Hunter S-style road trip through the Mojave, boasting Herculean performances from Dave Grohl (‘A Song For The Dead’), plus a spine chilling cameo from Mark Lanegan (‘Hangin’ Tree’), and that most unlikely of things, a hardcore polka (‘No One Knows’). 6. Thin Lizzy - 'Live And Dangerous'\n\n(1977)\n\nWhat can we say? The finest Lizzy album, studio or live (and by all accounts it was both). Tony Visconti’s crystal clear mix rendered Lizzy classics like ‘Jailbreak’, ‘Emerald’ and the languorous ‘Still In Love With You’ in living colour. Lynott and Downey were never better, while Robbo and Gorham operated like the left and right side of the same brain. 7. Jane's Addiction - 'Ritual De Lo Habitual'\n\n(1990)\n\nThe Janes revelled in transgressive LA noir imagery, pagan-religious esoterica, funk-rock fireworks (‘Been Caught Stealing’), goth-rock atmospherics (‘3 Days’) and even a wicked gypsy 3/4 chant (‘Of Course’). Perry Farrell’s human preying mantis poise, Dave Navarro’s wah-wah, and a virtuoso rhythm section ensured that JA endured as ‘90s avatars long after they disbanded. 8. Black Sabbath - 'Paranoid'\n\n(1970)\n\nWant to know where Nirvana and Alice In Chains got those clanging chords of doom? Or where Black Flag learned to play as sludgy and slow as a woolly mammoth? Look no further. Sabbath’s second album represented the point where metal evolved from the blues rock roots of Cream and Hendrix to become self-consciously and unapologetically theatrical and tribal. 9. Metallica - 'Metallica'\n\n(1991)\n\nHardcore fans might’ve voted for Master Of Puppets or …And Justice For All, but Bob Rock’s superior production and ‘Enter Sandman’ mean we’re sticking with the eponymous black album. 10. Deep Purple- 'Machine Head'\n\n(1972)\n\nThe original and best Purple line up of Gillan, Blackmore, Lord, Glover and Paice wasn’t destined to last, but Blackmore’s dark-hearted riffage, Lord’s churchy/classical licks and Gillan’s lungpower ensured immortality for tunes like ‘Highway Star’, ‘Space Truckin’’ and of course, ‘Smoke On The Water’. 11. Rose Tattoo - 'Rose Tattoo'\n\n(1978)\n\nOf all the AC/DC acolytes that appeared throughout the ‘70s and ‘80s (Krokus, Accept etc), the Sydney combo led by the bald-headed, heavily inked and razor-voiced Angry Anderson were undoubtedly the best. Traschcan drums, Peter Wells’ switchblade slide and rabble rousing tunes like ‘Bad Boy For Love’, and ‘Nice Boys Don’t Play Rock ‘n’ Roll’ show why Guns N’ Roses loved this lot enough to cover them. 12. Iron Maiden - 'The Number Of The Beast'\n\n(1982)\n\nOriginal singer Paul Di’Anno had a pleasingly punky edge, but his replacement, the eccentric and egocentric Bruce Dickinson, possessed greater stage presence, an air raid siren wail, and a neat knack for melody. The Londoners’ chart-topping third album was bejewelled with heavyweight songs about Native American genocide (the chart hit ‘Run To The Hills’), Hammer Horror schtick (the title tune, ‘Children Of The Damned’), and epic, mordant Sabbathry (‘Hallowed Be Thy Name’). 13. The Cult - 'Electric'\n\n(1987)\n\nWhether you view it as the greatest piss-take in metal history, or a brazen reinvention undertaken by a whiteface goth act, Electric, an unashamed homage to Zep and AC/DC, rocks. Rick Rubin’s masterful production job lends riff-heavy tunes like ‘Wild Flower’, ‘Peace Dog’ and ‘Love Removal Machine’ clarity and clout, and even the ludicrous Ian Astbury assumes a sort of gonzo dignity. 14. Aerosmith - 'Toys In The Attic'\n\n(1975)\n\nYes, the hi-gloss post rehab incarnation was one of the more impressive rock ‘n’ roll Lazarus acts of the ‘80s, but the faithful will always hanker for the original nitty-gritty dirt band’s fusion of cathouse swagger and trash talk. Here, on ‘Sweet Emotion’ and ‘Walk This Way’, Steven Tyler was at the height of his Shakespeare-of-double-entendre proto-rapping powers, while Joe Perry was a fluid and funky electric blues guitarist halfway between Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck. 15. The Black Crowes- 'The Southern Harmony And Musical Companion'\n\n(1992)\n\nThe Crowes were always more of a southern fried hard rock act than metal muthas per se, but their second album belongs in any longhair’s pantheon, a feast of Gram-like country soul balladry (‘Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye’), Sly Stone inflected funk (‘Remedy’), Stones-y sleaze (‘Sting Me’), and even a cover of Bob Marley’s ‘Time Will Tell’. 16. Van Halen - '1984'\n\n(1984)\n\nI know, I know, purists will plump for any of the first three albums, but we in HP can’t help but succumb to the synth hooks of MT-USA staple ‘Jump’ and the steamy windscreen juvenile fantasias of ‘Panama’ and ‘Hot For Teacher’. A masterpiece of ’tude, tunes and technoflash. 17. Faith No More - 'Angel Dust'\n\n(1992)\n\nInitially regarded as the darker, more complicated cousin of the Californian band’s breakthrough album The Real Thing, Angel Dust has since been given its due as a seminal and influential ‘90s artefact, incorporating hip-hop, prog, lounge, Waitsian weirdness and whatever you're having yourself. 18. Journey - 'Escape'\n\n(1981)\n\nNo metal best-of list would be complete without a bona fide AOR FM radio soft rock representative. Loathed by critics, loved by the masses, Journey’s eighth album groaned with hairblown, satin tour-jacket and cokespoon beauties like ‘Who’s Crying Now’, the big production weepie ‘Open Arms’ and the Sopranos enshrined ‘Don’t Stop Believin’. Guilty pleasure? Not a bit of it. 19. Slayer - 'Reign In Blood'\n\n(1986)\n\nSecond only to Metallica as the metal fan’s metal band, thrashmeisters Slayer reached their apogee on this Rick Rubin-produced third record and Billboard debut, voted the heaviest album of all time by Kerrang! Come and have a go if you think you’re ’ardcore enough. 20. Marilyn Manson - 'Holywood(In The Shadow Of The Valley Of Death'\n\n(2000)\n\nGiven his self-made sin-eater/national scapegoat schtick, it’s easy to forget than Manson has come up with a slew of challenging and at times intoxicating concept glam-metal albums. Holywood is his best, a meditation on epochal inversion (the Manson murders and Altamont reccurring as Columbine and Woodstock ‘99) that contained stonking tunes like ‘Fight Song’, ‘The Nobodies’ and ‘Disposable Teens’. 21. Def Leppard - 'Hysteria'\n\n(1987)\n\nWhen the Leps emerged from Sheffield in the late ‘70s, they were wide-eyed AC/DC copyists with bad hair and worse clothes. Ten years later the hair hadn’t changed much, but Mutt Lange had worked Pygmalion wonders on their sound, pumping up the Simmins drum sounds, multi-tracking layers of backing vocals, and spraying the mix with an immaculate radio gloss. 22. Therapy? - 'Troublegum'\n\n(1994)\n\nIn which the Belfast trio, shorn of industrial trimmings, slimmed down the bottom-heavy Sabs/Fugazi leanings of their early albums and delivered a record chock-full of three-minute classics like ‘Nowhere’ and ‘Die Laughing’ that paid homage to halcyon sons of Ulster such as SLF and the Undertones. 23. Rage Against The Machine - 'Rage Against The Machine'\n\n(1992)\n\nRage’s debut was a classic agitprop rap-metal record that fused MC5 revolutionary posturing with Public Enemy sonic attack and blood-red riffola. Zach De La Rocha was an incendiary frontman, while Tom Morello used his pick-up switch like a turntable scratching device, when he wasn’t pumping out great fat barre chords. 24. Rainbow- 'Rising'\n\n(1976)\n\n1979’s Down To Earth had hit singles like ‘Since You’ve Been Gone’ and ‘All Night Long’, but this 1976 album boasted stentorian shortarse singer Ronnie James Dio, Cozy Powell on drums, plus the Munich Philharmonic-assisted centrepiece ‘Stargazer’, which was resident in the upper echelons of the late Tommy Vance’s Friday Night Rock Show listeners’ polls for donkey’s years. 25. Soundgarden - 'Superunknown'\n\n(1994)\n\nChris Cornell’s mob provided brickbats aplenty for critics who insisted grunge was just metal in nu-clothes. But so what? The band’s second album was a kaleidoscope of late ‘60s pysychedelia (‘Black Hole Sun’), Zep calisthenics (‘Spoonman’) and brooding introspectiveness (‘The Day I Tried To Live’, ‘Fell On Black Days’). 26. Judas Priest - 'British Steel'\n\n(1980)\n\nBrummies Judas Priest were initially a silken-haired, flaxen-robed old school ‘70s rock band, but the quintet overhauled their image with leather and studs just in time to capitalise on the NWOBHM, and British Steel boasted classy pop-metal nuggets like ‘Breaking The Law’ and ‘Living After Midnight’. 27. Rush - 'Moving Pictures'\n\n(1981)\n\nYes, some of us might yearn for the misty Arcadian vistas of early concept records like 2112 and A Farewell To Kings, but this 1981 album proved that the Canadian powerprog trio were surprisingly suited to a trimmer, radio-friendly style. ‘Tom Sawyer’ was an unlikely UK hit, while ‘Red Barchetta’, ‘Limelight’ and ‘YYZ’ married oodles of muso noodlings (step up to the plate Mr Peart) with melodic suss 28. Motley Crue - 'Shout At The Devil'\n\n(1983)\n\nWhen the Crue’s underwhelming debut Too Fast For Love appeared amidst a wave of early ‘80s transatlantic glam revivalists (Wrathchild anyone?), they were dismissed as charlatans more adept with a make up brush than their instruments. This meaty second album silenced the critics, boasting sterling tunes like ‘Looks That Kill’, ‘Too Young To Fall In Love’, the title tune, and a respectable stab at the Beatles’ ‘Helter Skelter’. 29. Scorpians - 'Blackout'\n\n(1982)\n\nEven without Michael Schenker, everything about the German stadium rockers screamed silly. Singer Klaus’s gay traffic cop hat. The nasal shriek and teutonic pronunciation. The Flying Vs, skintight strides and handlebar moustaches. And yet, Blackout was a mighty melding of riff and melody, evidenced by tunes like ‘Can’t Live Without You’ and the throbbing ‘China White’."
