        "text": "Black Sabbath has a long and storied history, which everyone knows by now. This is an attempt to shed light on the 37 other musicians who have contributed to the legacy of The Godfathers of Metal.\n\nTONY IOMMI < 1968-- >\n\nPerformed on all Sabbath releases from Black Sabbath to Heaven and Hell, Born Again, Reunion, The Last Supper and Past Lives.\n\nAlso performed with Ozzy on Live & Loud and The Ozzman Cometh, and has had 3 solo albums.\n\nTERENCE “GEEZER” BUTLER <1968–1979 / 1979-1984 / 1987 / 1990-1994 / 1997-2017>\n\nPerformed on all Sabbath releases from Black Sabbath to Born Again, Dehumanizer, Cross Purposes, Cross Purposes Live and all releases from Reunion to 13.\n\nAlso performed with Ozzy on Just Say Ozzy, Live & Loud and Ozzmosis, he’s had 3 solo albums over the years and 3 albums with Heaven & Hell.\n\nOZZY OSBOURNE <1968–1977 / 1978-1979 / 1997-2006 / 2011-2017>\n\nPerformed on no Sabbath releases. Brought in to replace Ozzy when he quit after the Technical Ecstasy album. Wrote lyrics for what was to become Never Say Die! And performed War Pigs and an early version of what would become Juniors Eyes on a BBC show in 1978. He’s done short stints in lots of bands before his time in Sabbath. The two most notable were Savoy Brown, who I’ve heard of but not familiar with their music at all. He recorded 2 albums with them from 1971-1972. He also recorded the album Penguin with Fleetwood Mac in 1973 which was their highest charting U.S. album to date, but was asked to leave later that year before the recording of the next album.\n\nRONNIE JAMES DIO <1979–1982 / 1991-1992 / 2006-2010> VOCALS\n\nPerformed on Heaven and Hell, Mob Rules, Live Evil, Dehumanizer, The Dio Years, and The Devil You Know.\n\nAlso performed with Ronnie & The Red Caps, Ronnie Dio and The Prophets - 1 album, The Electric Elves, The Elves, Elf - 3 albums, and Rainbow - 3 albums. He also released 10 solo albums.\n\nGEOFF NICHOLS <1979-2004> KEYBOARD, BASS, RHYTHM GUITAR\n\nPerformed on all Sabbath releases from Heaven and Hell to The Last Supper, and The Dio Years.\n\nHe was originally brought in as 2nd guitarist when Sabbath doubted they would continue to use that name. He switched to bass when Geezer left briefly and then to keyboards when Geezer returned and they decided to continue using the Sabbath name.\n\nAlso performed with former Sabbath singer Tony Martin in Tony Martin’s Headless Cross, recording 2 albums and performing on those tours.\n\nCRAIG GRUBER <1979> BASS\n\nPerformed on no Sabbath releases. He was in on the early recording sessions for Heaven and Hell, co-writing Die Young, until Geezer heard Dio and returned to the band.\n\nAlso performed with Dio in Elf and then Rainbow, performed on a live Gary Moore album and formed and band in the early 80’s called Bible Black that featured Joey Belladonna before he left to join Anhrax.\n\nVINNY APPICE <1980–1982 / 1991-1992 / 1998 / 2006-2010> DRUMS\n\nPerformed on Mob Rules, Live Evil, Dehumanizer, The Dio Years.\n\nHe joined Sabbath during the Heaven and Hell tour in 1980 to replace Bill Ward who left due to personal issues. He had to learn the songs while performing on stage using hastily written notes for unfamiliar songs. At age of 16 with his original band BOMF, he met John Lennon and they were his backing band for several performances, including the final one before his death. He recorded 2 albums for Rick Derringer in 1976-77. He has also performed with a host of other bands including Dio, World War 3, Kill Devil Hill and Last In Line along with a host of others.\n\nIAN GILLAN <1982-1984> VOCALS\n\nPerformed on Born Again.\n\nReplaced Dio, he had a hard time remembering the lyrics to the older Sabbath material and would write all the lyrics down and keep them on the state floor and turned the pages with his feet. All the dry ice would make it hard for him to read the lyrics and he would frequently be seen on the floor reading the next set of lyrics. During this time the band would play Smoke on the Water as their encore.\n\nAlso performed with Deep Purple releasing 15 albums. He had variations of his own band, Ian Gillan Band and Gillan releasing 10 albums total. Gillan employed Janick Gers for 2 albums under the Gillan moniker. He has also released 7 solo albums.\n\nBEV BEVAN <1983-1984 / 1987> DRUMS\n\nPerformed on The Eternal Idol - Scarlet Pimpernel and The Eternal Idol only, and the Born Again reissue bonus live tracks.\n\nHe served as the touring drummer for the Born Again tour and played percussion on The Eternal Idol album. He also appeared in the videos for Trashed and Zero the Hero.\n\nHe was one of the founding members of Electric Light Orchestra and ELO Part II.\n\nRON KEEL <1984> VOCALS\n\nPerformed on no Sabbath releases.

Lee and Eric Singer from Sabbath. He then formed several other bands over the years but died in 1993.\n\nBOB DAISLEY <1986> BASS\n\nPerformed on The Eternal Idol.\n\nHe was brought in to play on this album as Dave Spitz had other personal commitments. Daisley was offered the role permanently but turned it down due to his commitment to Gary Moore.\n\nHe also performed with Mungo Jerry, Rainbow, Ozzy Osbourne, and Uriah Heep. He has also contributed to albums by Yngwie Malmsteen, Bill Ward, Jeff Watson of Night Ranger and many others.\n\nTONY MARTIN <1987-1991 / 1993-1997> VOCALS\n\nPerformed on all Sabbath releases from The Eternal Idol to Forbidden except Dehumanizer.\n\nHe was brought in to re-record Ray Gillen’s vocal tracks.
