Its a nice, diverse collection of songs.\n\nWith his third solo album, released in 1983, powerhouse drummer Cozy Powell wisely reverted to the format of his debut, Over the Top. At the time, Powell was a member of Whitesnake (I saw him perform with them at Castle Donington a few months after the album’s release), so he enlisted the help of some of his bandmates for the recording of Octopuss – whose title oddly recalls the James Bond movie Octopussy, also released in 1983. The album cover, which shows Powell behind his kit, looking a bit like a many-armed Hindu deity, is also clearly reminiscent of the movie’s official poster.As in the case of Over the Top, the album features a series of classy, dynamic hard/jazz-rock numbers, as well as two covers of popular pieces of music, this time soundtracks to well-known movies – respectively, 1964 war flick 633 Squadron, and William Wyler western The Big Country (starring John Wayne). The orchestral arrangements on both tracks provide the ideal background for Powell’s drum pyrotechnics, though both of them are definitely more restrained than the wonderfully bombastic title-track of the first album.\n\nThough the overall level of the compositions is quite high, there are a couple of highlights that are probably worth the price of the whole album. One is the Gary Moore-penned Dartmoore (notice the pun in the title), inspired by the camping trip that Cozy and his then-new boss, David Coverdale, had made a few months earlier to the titular, scenic area of southwestern England. It is a brilliant, slow-burning, guitar-driven piece in the style of the previous album’s stunning Sunset, though somehow lacking the latter’s deeply poignant quality. The other is the title-track, a highly original offering which is basically a dialogue between Powell’s drums and Colin Hodgkinson’s jaw-dropping bass, backed by Jon Lord’s trademark, rumbling Hammond organ. Closing track The Rattler (co-written by Powell and Coverdale) also deserves a mention: a brisk, energetic (though rather short) workout, introduced by a veritable drum explosion, it features some very tasteful guitar licks.\n\nOctopuss was to be the last solo album to be recorded by Cozy in a long time: his fourth album, The Drums Are Back, the last released before his early demise in 1998, came out in 1992. In the meantime, the legendary drummer lent his considerable skills to a large number of bands, including the ELP incarnation where the P stood for Powell instead of Palmer. This album offers further proof of his ability to play different kinds of music than the hard-hitting rock for which he is mainly known. With excellent musicianship throughout, and interesting, well-written compositions, Octopuss will appeal to both fans of vintage rock and hard-edged jazz-rock. A highly recommended addition to your collection.\n\nThird solo album from Cozy Powel entitled Octopuss from 1983. The music from this album is the most varied one from his entire solo career. Some personal changes as well here, 3 new musicians among those three John Lord from Deep Purple. Again a solid jazz rock album, better than predecessor and in the same league with the first, Octopuss brings more consistency in the pieces and in the manner of interpretation as well. This album in much more varied than previous works, in places even some symphonic elements are added like on 633 Squadron – sounds like a fanfare with orchestra, but again truly good piece. The rest of the pieces keep that jazz rock mood, but are more interesting and challenging than Tilt and on the same level, even in places quite better than Over the top. So my fav track are Up on the Downs, 633 Squadron and Princetown, the rest are good no doubt. Very pleasant album all the way, maybe not so complicated like other jazz albums from late ’70’s to early ’80’s, but without doubt a solid album with a lot to offer. Cozy Powell was maybe less pompous than other drummers from that period, less extravagant, but when he was behind the drums, no one dare to underestimate his talent. A brilliant and very confident musician who remains as one of the best and prolific drummer ever in music. Sadly he passed away in April 1998 in car crash. His solo albums are hard to find and it is shocking that they are unknown to many; this is sad, because what you find here is unmatched for sure. Recommended."
