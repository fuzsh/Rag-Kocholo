        "text": "I had high hopes for this book, but based on my reading of the “Look Inside” preview on Amazon, and now the first Amazon review, I’ll likely keep my money in my pocket.\n\nThe author is very upfront that she was in school when Cozy died, didn’t know him personally, and didn’t know any of his musical colleagues personally. So what she’s done is take articles/interviews by Cozy and others and outline his life to some degree. This translated to text that constantly reads, “... was quoted.” It’s kind of just going from one quote to the next. I dare say if you take a shot of something every time you come across “... was quoted”, you’ll be smashed by the time you’re done with the preview.\n\nI don’t want to be too harsh on the author, though. I’m sure she did her best, and heaven knows a bio on Cozy is long overdue. But as the first Amazon review of the book also seems to indicate, this isn’t the deep-dive biography we might have hoped for:\n\nWhat this lacks is a thread of Cozy's life story to even begin to link anything up. So it doesn't really tell you anything you probably didn't already know. It barely just scratches the surface with regards to who Cozy played with. Too much of Cozy's work barely receives a mention, whilst some is not even mentioned at all. Cozy's body of work alone deserves the kitchen sink thrown at it...\n\nOf course, that’s just one person’s (partial) review. And my thoughts are just on the preview. Maybe someone else here will read it and have a more favorable opinion.\n\nI think I was spoiled having recently finished Andy Aledort’s excellent SRV biography.\n\nAfter reading Bob Daisley's autobiography, I get your point. You kind of had to be there to understand the labyrinth of British bands in the late 60s and 70s, who knew whom and who may have been in what band for a short time. Those are the kind of details that make it interesting to fans who already know the story."
