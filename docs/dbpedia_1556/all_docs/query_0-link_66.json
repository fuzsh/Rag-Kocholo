        "meta_description": "I just picked up the 21 Spices album by Trilok Grutu and Simon Phillips. Its an absolutely astounding album. I wanted to post about that. But upon further thought, I want to blather on about Phillips. Hes quite easily my favorite drummer. Others are close, but Phillips always brings a smile to my face. It doesn't matter what he's playing, its always spot on and for the piece. He has his telltale signature riffs for sure, but if wasn't for that \"Simon Phillips Sound,\" as he calls it, sometimes",
