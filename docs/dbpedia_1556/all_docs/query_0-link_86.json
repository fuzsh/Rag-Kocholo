        "text": "Bernie Marsden had finished his next solo record prior to his death, and his family have wanted this to go ahead as per the original planned schedule. It is the follow up to his 2014 album Shine. Titled Working Man it will be out on November 24th this year. A lead track has been put up on the web:\n\nPeople have also been hitting us with their own memories, I particularly liked these two.\n\nYears ago a guitar playing mate visited from Holland and we decide to go and see Company of Snakes in a very small club in Plymouth called the Cooperage. Maybe only 100 people there. We were right up front, of course, and boy Bernie had his Marshall full open as if he was playing in Wembley Arena! Easily the loudest I’ve ever heard somebody play guitar. But what a tone, and what a player. The rest of the band were excellent too. If memory serves me well including Don Airey on keys, just before joining DP. Tonny Steenhagen\n\nI’ll always remember once seeing him do an acoustic gig in the highly salubrious setting of Nunnington Hall near York on a wintry night quite a few years ago. He looked around the luxurious 100-seater setting (complete with suits of armour and a grandfather clock!) and announced “This is just like Jon Lord’s Drawing Room… only smaller!” Tim Summers.\n\nIn my time running record labels I am tempted just to say on a personal level probably the nicest musician we ever dealt with and leave it at that….\n\nDespite attending any number of rock gigs in the early Seventies we somehow missed Bernie Marsden’s early career in Babe Ruth, Hammer, UFO and others. Like many others here it was Bernie’s arrival on guitar as one of the supergroup Paice Ashton Lord which introduced him to Purple fans big time (and caused some to wonder why he had not been given more of a share of the vocal duties as well!).\n\nAs PAL struggled to keep it together, Bernie bumped in to David Coverdale as he came in from the cold, and it was in Whitesnake early on that Bernie really found his spiritual home musically, contributing guitar to a proper no nonsense live hard rock blues outfit which grew in stature across several years as the line-up stabilised. Their early club tour in 1978 was a real event in the ex-Purple sphere and Manchester Rafters was over packed when we saw them. Where Bernie was stuck at the back of the PAL stage looking slightly lost, here he was almost in the crowd, properly part of the Whitesnake matrix.\n\nOn top of his playing, you don’t need me to underscore Bernie’s important songwriting contributions to their biggest albums and hits, co-writing two of the tracks on their debut EP as well as bringing Ain’t No Love to their stage show. Off stage he was always very down to earth and happy to have a chat with fans, sign albums and enjoy a joke, something which never really changed.\n\nWe were more than impressed when penning our first Omnibus Whitesnake biography and approached Bernie for a chat. Offering to meet him up somewhere, he just said “I’ll pop up, I like a drive…” As his slightly careworn Porsche parked outside a few days hence proved.\n\nLater, working with Bernie on reissues for the RPM and Purple labels we got to visit his well kitted out studio office a couple of times and while he was probably bemused that his collection of vintage guitars there went way over my head, was happy to rummage through piles of quarter inch reels looking for relevant masters and flick through files of old photos.\n\nWe last met in a local music emporium where he was doing a short but fascinating set a couple of years back, demonstrating new amplifiers, showing how well his solo and Whitesnake material broke down into a more modest environment yet still sounded excellent (he then broke off mid-set to hold a conversation with myself across the audience, much to my embarrassment!).\n\nIn recent months we had also been corresponding about him contributing to a book of vintage Blues photographs we are finishing up, and he was enthusing about seeing material from the Sixties when he was hero worshipping many of these musicians (his recent blues covers albums are really excellent homages to some of this material).\n\nHis last cheery email apologising for not having got round to finishing his bit yet still sits in my in-tray.\n\nI can’t recall when I last played a later era Whitesnake record; it is back to the classics from those early records for me, and always will be.\n\nThe photo here is from my brother Nick’s Rafters 1978 negs.\n\nStrange how everything goes quiet for a time then suddenly we’re swamped with new (and old) releases and forthcoming projects. Here’s a quick catch up with what’s happening:\n\nMade In Japan is now shipping in all the various editions. We have already gone on about this on the site so will be interested to hear what people say once they actually get to study the content in detail. I’ve opened a reviews page. DTB online stock is going out but taking ages to pack; as seems the norm these days we were left til last for stock orders. However we will hold the advertised prices on the big editions for the next couple of weeks.\n\nThe Artwoods collection has been revamped since we last posted about it. The set has been given a new title, Steady Gettin’ It, a new sleeve with a great colour photo, and an extra disc! So it has morphed into a triple album. The main reason for this is the inclusion of no fewer than FIVE BBC sessions by the band, some sixteen tracks in total from 1965, 1966 and 1967. The booklet has also been expanded to 38 pages. It’s due in at the very end of July now, so will probably ship early August. Full track list is on our online store.\n\nAlso from the sixties is a nice looking reissue of the original Zephyr debut album, Tommy Bolin‘s first major studio output. Out of print here for years (BGO first issued it in the UK on CD), this has been overseen and annotated by band member David Givens and includes a remaster of the original 1969 album, a CD of miscellaneous live tracks and a third disc which is a one-off full reunion show from 1973 in Boulder (Tommy had moved on the year before). It’s a US import due at the end of this month but DTB Online will be stocking it. All the CDs are in separate mini-gatefold covers packaged in a nice slipcase with a detailed booklet. Just think, MIJ could have looked like this!\n\nBernie Marsden has also finally set a date for his much trailed new solo album Shine, which is now due in August. As we’ve mentioned before, this features David Coverdale, Ian Paice and Don Airey in guest roles. The previews we’ve heard sound great, a really gusty blues production. There will be a limited double vinyl run as well.\n\nGlenn Hughes‘s new outfit California Breed is also due in a few days. They have added a limited edition which includes a DVD of the promo videos and other goodies.\n\nStill no sign of the triple vinyl for Black Masquerade by Rainbow, we’ll keep hammering away at the label reps for a date.\n\nThe triple vinyl of Deep Purple’s 1969 Concerto has also gone back and is now promised for late June. The Mk 1 box set is still in the pipeline but getting nearer. I’m hoping there will be some exciting news concerning this, but have to keep quiet for now.\n\nAll the above are on the DTB Online store and can be ordered – or pre-ordered.\n\nLastly we do have some stock of the limited edition Record Store Day Deep Purple releases here but will only put these on the store once we have fulfilled the pre-orders.\n\nAnd talking of online stores, we are in the final testing stages of a NEW DTB COLLECTABLES online shop. Response to our earlier lists of collectors items, rarities, second hand vinyl, etc. was so good we have decided to open a new online shop for this sort of material. More details will follow very shortly. We are also going to open a new email news and new release news service. Lots of you already get emails from Ann but her software is now starting to creak at the sheer number of addresses. So we’ve invested in a special software to organise this better and again details will be posted here soonest.\n\nAbove: Deep Purple Now (looking like they’re busy nicking scrap metal!) and Then (1969 – yes I know we thought the In Rock sleeve pics were taken in 1970, but it increasingly looks like they were shot the previous year).\n\nAs is traditional at DTB during this time of year, we’re gazing into the Slaves & Masters sleeve to see what the next twelve months might hold for Deep Purple fans. Any anniversaries to celebrate? Well it’s the 45th Anniversary of Mk 2 for starters, which is quite something (especially for us oldies who were around at the time), and also the 40th of Burn. Still not feeling your age? Then try the 30th anniversary of the reunion on for size. More importantly for the band, it will be 20 years since Steve Morse joined Deep Purple – his first gig with them being in November 1994 (though it was a little later that the UK first got to see the band). Time is all we have, as IG put it on the last album. Will they be inspired to bounce back with a quickish follow up to Now Then? They do all seem to want to work with Ezrin again as soon as, but perhaps a little optimistic to see them back in the studio just yet. Otherwise it looks like business as normal with dates already appearing (see our date sheet).\n\nThis will certainly be the year in which the shake down of the long EMI break up starts to impact on the classic catalogue, and the first projects from the various new owners of the licensing rights are set see the light of day. They do not have an easy job as EMI by and large treated the overall core albums with a degree of detail which was the envy of fans of many other bands (it’s taken Led Zeppelin 15 years to catch up!).\n\nOn one side we have Universal shaping up with their Made In Japan project, a full set featuring all the recordings in correct order. On the other Warners Europe are developing a project based around the Mk 1 catalogue. Plans are also afoot for the two labels to co-ordinate so fans don’t get a glut of releases all at the same time, which makes a lot of sense (especially if you remember the unseemly scramble around the time of the reunion with everyone trying to get something on the shelves). In the meantime, certain Deep Purple CDs are being marked up as ‘restricted trade’ and unavailable, though we assume the stock will be freed up before long.\n\nOn the Jon Lord scene, the countdown to the special Albert Hall memorial show in April is on. There are plans to record and film; I think this will be enough for me but lots of DTB folk have their tickets. I am also told the heritage plaque in Leicester on Jon’s house of birth is going to happen this year, and we will give out more details nearer the time. The Jon Lord photographic book is under way and promises an interesting collection of images (many never before seen) and possibly some previously unreleased music as well through a CD in the package. A number of Jon’s music scores are also being made available online for budding orchestras (and anyone who wants to have these open while playing the CDs) during 2014, including the 2010 Concerto For Group & Orchestra.\n\nThe book scene looks to be quite busy. The Wait For The Ricochet book finally appears in January (I know, but the printers have shipped it to us this week, so they will start going out next), there’s a Gillan biography under way in Finland, a special Deep Purple photo book from the publishers of the California Jam opus, and a rather super Blackmore photo biography project from another publisher. More on all these as and when we’re allowed (I’ve had my knuckles rapped before for saying too much!).\n\nMusically we will see Bernie Marsden‘s new blues album around March, which promises to be quite a doozy from those who have heard advance copies, never mind Coverdale’s guesting on it. The label (which is owned by Joe Bonamassa) have pushed a taster up on their Soundcloud site, which we really liked. Given label backing which he’s not really had for a long time, this could really do well for Bernie. Check it out.\n\nDavid Coverdale also sings on a Whitesnake cover on an upcoming Adrian Vandenberg album, and talking of DC, expect something special from the man (and another man) later this year too.\n\nGlenn Hughes is bouncing back from the BCC close down with a new project which includes Jason Bonham and a young American multi-instrumentalist called Andrew Watt. Julian Lennon guests on one track. I’m told April is the planned arrival date for the CD.\n\nSo, lots to look forward to and probably more besides; let us know if you have any news or info to share. We’d like to sneak in a thanks everyone who has been in touch or helped over the last twelve months and wish you all the best for 2104. Lots of nice comments on the site lately, I don’t usually publish these but they are appreciated.\n\n0.000000\n\n0.000000\n\nSome bits you may have seen on the site and elsewhere, others you may have missed…\n\nThere’s a new Tommy Bolin set due late August in America, titled Whirlwind. No final details of European editions yet but these will be available through DTBOnline. There is a limited edition but seems to be for US only. Other new titles due in are vinyl of Jon Lord’s Concerto. Vinyl of the latest Blackmore’s Night album has been issued but is not being distributed by normal channels so we cannot supply it.\n\nThe Phenomena Project is assembling (sounds like something from an upcoming Marvel Comics film!) for at least one festival slot next year at Sweden Rock Festival 2014, with Glenn Hughes – Vocals, Neil Murray – Bass, and Bernie Marsden – Guitar, plus Martin Kronlund – Guitar, Perra Johansson – Drums, Ian Haugland – Drums. Dating back to 1985, this was a series of studio albums with contributions from Glenn and others, but never toured.\n\nStill with Glenn, the Hughes / Thrall album is reissued on vinyl shortly, 180 gsm edition (pre-order at DTBOnline).\n\nI wonder if the Jon Lord BBC show we mentioned on DTB before is this: “Keyboard wizard Rick Wakeman pays tribute to his friend, Deep Purple’s Jon Lord…” Airing at 23:25, Sunday, July 14th, BBC1 TV but in the East Midlands only (due to the Leicester connection I assume). Hopefully it will be on iPlayer after, most local programming is.\n\nTalking of the man, it’s now confirmed that the memorial show takes place in April 2014, with lots of guests. We’ll let you know more when we can on the Jon Lord page on the site. I know some people were hoping to travel to catch this and a DP UK show in October this year as they were originally hoping to stage it in October. There is also a special book celebrating Jon’s life in words and pictures in the planning stages, about which more shortly.\n\nAll a bit quieter over in Deep Purple land, apart from Don Airey doing a freebie show in Italy in August, with a Deep Purple tribute band. Date and flyer on the site here.\n\nOn the back-catalogue, we should note that the 1999 Deep Purple Live At The Royal Albert Hall set is deleted; anyone needing the 2CD set should move quickly. A customer came to us asking if we could help and were surprised to find it had gone. We still have some in stock at DTBOnline store (or you can pay over £30 on Am*z*n!). A marvellous weekend for everyone really, and you have to think with hindsight it was one of the high spots of the reunion. It’s great that Jon got to do this when he did.\n\nThe DPO Archives are promising us an anniversary video single to mark the release forty years back of the Smoke On The Water single in America. It took EMI UK four years to finally release this here, not until the band had split did they put it out on 7″ in 1977.\n\nFunnily enough, the radio comedy show The Castle (recently repeated on Radio 4Extra) have the riff done on medieval instruments which sounds great (along with many other famous rock hooks). Also due is a reissue of the Live In Copenhagen ’72 DVD.\n\nThe Wait For The Riochet book majoring on the Deep Purple In Rock period of the band is now in the final proofing stages and on track to go to print later this month. There will be a cut-off date for pre-orders announced shortly so if you want the copy with your credit in best get a wriggle on. If the title has passed you by, check it out on the site here.\n\nThe latest live Whitesnake album Made In Britain is now shipping, a double CD set (see DTBOnline). Apparently Whitesnake showed head and shoulder shots of Jon Lord, Mel Galley and Cozy Powell during the performance of Gambler on the recent UK tour. Until I heard this I hadn’t really thought how many of the classic line-up we’d lost.\n\nMention of Mel sort of leads us obliquely to Judas Priest (How? Mel, Trapeze, Glenn, Deep Purple, Roger Glover, produced Priest…. peasy). John Tucker was asking me aboiut The Flying Hat Band, who supported Purple for a few shows in Europe in January 1974. This was Priest guitarist Glenn Tipton’s outfit and we were wondering how on earth they came to be selected for the tour (given that most of Purple’s supports at that time were usually bands people had heard of – Alex Harvey Band, Tucky Buzzard, Elf, etc.). Let us know if you managed the band at the time!\n\nIssue 6 of Swedish magazine Retroculture majors on Deep Purple. Though mostly in Swedish, interviews with Coverdale and Johnny Bolin have been included in English by editor Mike Eriksson. The only worry I have is the magazine’s website name which in English reads a bit strange, so I’ll just paste it as a link! Thanks also to the guys at Hush magazine for their latest issue, 41. 75 pages of DP and family content, along with other bands.\n\nThat comedy film Discoverdale we’ve been mentioning for some time is now getting screenings in various art cinemas around the country. Very nice of the producers to send us an invite to the London premier (though the thought of driving all that way in the recent heatwave to sit in a cinema didn’t really appeal). The flyer actually featured quite a big photo of David Coverdale. You can visit the movie’s official site to read more. Can’t wait to see it.\n\nFinally, Chris Poustie writes : “I was in a musical instrument shop in Bangkok a couple of days ago and as I was waiting to pay my bill a song came out of the shop’s speakers which I immediately recognized as “We Wish You Well” although it was being sung in an Asian language, most probably Japanese or Korean. It was a much bigger production than the original Whitesnake version and much longer too, probably a full 3 or 4 minutes. First verse sung by a man, and the second verse sung by a woman in operatic style!” If anyone can tell Chris who this was by let us know. The track was also covered back in the day (1979) by an outfit called Company, a 7″ single which featured four members of Whitesnake on a busman’s holiday…\n\nThanks also to Jacqueline Stokes, James Bateman, Tim Summers.\n\nGillan and Paice looked relaxed on the Later with… TV show on Tuesday evening. Jools Holland banged on about the album sleeve for a bit and then (for some reason) asked IG how dressing room riders had changed over the years? This prompted a nice (but barely audible) IG riff about asking for a rhino full of tartan ice cream and milk from two dogs! Holland then wheeled out the old Top Of The Pops clip – again – and asked them to come back and play on the show sometime. Paice said they would make that happen. IG mentioned that Roger couldn’t come as he was in hospital but didn’t say what was wrong. They may have a longer chat on the show’s repeat.\n\nThe DTB Mail Order Store have been told the Now What vinyl edition has sold out. The distributors are checking to see if any extra stock about, or if the label might be repressing given the demand.\n\nRolling Stone magazine have run a story asking readers for their list of bands which should be ion the rock and roll hall of fame but are still missing. Deep Purple tops the list. They were nominated for this year, and the next list will be announced in 2014. The place is fast becoming something of a laughing stock. Here’s the story. And even I know how to spell Nirvana correctly.\n\nAlso worth reading, a really well put together review of the new album and where it sits in the band’s career, in the Albany Democratic Herald. Nice to see such good journalism surviving in odd corners, it sure beats some of the shallow stuff which passes itself off in the UK qualities these days. And when you’re finished reading it you can even get a Beaver Sports Update… A fairly positive review in the Independent newspaper in the UK too although the writer seemed to think that Don was a replacement following Jon’s death.\n\nThe Wednesday after Jools, Coverdale popped up on the BBC Breakfast TV sofa looking chipper and plugging the tour which starts Saturday. Dates are on the Coverdale news page. There are strong rumours to the effects that Bernie will pop up again at some shows, and even that Micky Moody might join him, but we’ll have to wait and see.\n\nThe next installment of the Whitesnake live album releases has been announced, a double from the UK and ROW, the details again on the Coverdale page shortly. It looks like they decided to combine two releases into one. Apparently they decided to record every show, and the CD production team then had to sift through over eighty concerts to make the selection…\n\nIt looks as if Coverdale guests on a track on Bernie Marsden’s upcoming solo album, as well as Joe Bonamasa (it is coming out on Joe’s label).\n\nFinally who is the scallywag who posted this comment on a YouTube clip of Ritchie and The Outlaws some years ago (hoping it might become part of Blackmore myth)? It has finally been refuted! “Not many people realise that Ritchie Blackmore wrote and played most of the music for children’s television through the 1960’s – this was just before purple made the big time: Magic Roundabout, Chigley and Camberwick Green to name a few.” Mind you two more mid-sixties sessions have been mooted by one of the old engineers, so we’re trying to confirm.\n\nOh, and still wondering why Amazon are so cheap? Staff at their German offices have had to stage a strike just to try and get their wages up to the German state minimum.\n\nThanks to Mark Maddock. John McEvoy. Jamie Woodward. Stephen Clare. Tim Summers. Timothy Campbell."
