        "text": "The late 80s saw Cozy join Black Sabbath, and also play on the Comic Relief single The Stonk. Enter the 90s and Cozy played on the lion's share of Brian May's solo material (both albums), another session with Black Sabbath and then with Glenn Tipton, the Judas Priest guitarist.\n\nCozy played on Yngqwie Malmsteen's Facing The Animal album but had to abort from the tour following a motorcycle injury. We was recovering from that with the intention of touring with Brian May when he was killed in a car crash. His final work was with Colin Blunstone. More material featuring his work retrospectively has recently been issued by Glenn Tipton and Tony Martin.The career is too long to go into here but he is one of the best and most travelled hard rock drummers.\n\nMore information:\n\nArtist website\n\nÂ© 2006 Joe Geesin/GRTR!
