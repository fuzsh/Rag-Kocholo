        "text": "Former Black Sabbath frontman Tony Martin has spoken about the chances of a reunion with the band, and expressed that he is “up for” working with Tony Iommi again.\n\nREAD MORE: Ozzy Osbourne: a rock’n’roll showman like no other\n\nThe vocalist took on the role of frontman for the band for a brief time between the mid-’80s and late-’90s, when the group membership had shifted around founding guitarist Tony Iommi.\n\nComprised of Iommi, Martin, legendary drummer Cozy Powell (Whitesnake, Jeff Beck, Rainbow), and long-time Sabbath collaborator and keyboardist Geoff Nicholls (Bandy Legs, Quartz), the line-up came two decades and multiple line-up changes into the band’s career.\n\nWith him as the singer, the band released six albums: ‘The Eternal Idol’ (1987), ‘Headless Cross’ (1989), ‘Tyr’ (1990), ‘Cross Purposes’ (1994), ‘Cross Purposes Live’ (1995) and ‘Forbidden’ (1995). He was later removed from the role after Iommi reunited with his fellow original bandmates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow – following the guitarist sharing a box set of the albums recorded with Martin earlier this year, titled ‘Anno Domini 1989-1995′ – the singer has confirmed that he is open to working with Iommi once again.\n\n“I would, and I’ve already said that if he felt like doing something I’d be up for it,” he told RockSverige during a new interview, before explaining that he doesn’t think it will be likely to materialise.\n\nRecommended\n\n“I don’t think Tony is really… I think he’s come to the end of his need to do things. He doesn’t need to do this stuff. As you get older, and he had that problem with the cancer thing, he’s definitely not interested in touring, really. He could do the odd appearance, but he doesn’t need to, so I don’t know.\n\n“I’d like to, but it’s one of these things… Whilst everybody’s still alive, there’s always a possibility. I mean, they could still get Bill Ward back in the band and start again, in theory,” he added. “Once people start passing along, you can’t sort of do that anymore. I’ve already said that I wouldn’t mind doing something if they were interested. We’ll see how it goes.”\n\nIommi has shared praise for the material with Martin in the past, and openly discussed how it often flew under the radar when it came to Sabbath’s extensive catalogue.\n\n“There’s some great stuff with Tony Martin,” Iommi told DPA in a recent interview (via Blabbermouth). “The funny thing is, though, when we had that lineup together, it was difficult because people wouldn’t quite all accept it at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I financed that whole project, the touring and buses and everything else. I paid for it personally,” he said. “I really enjoyed the band, I enjoyed the stuff we were doing.”\n\nIommi also told I Heart Guitar that it was “a shame” that “it took a long time to get people to really realise how good” Martin’s work with the band was.\n\nTony Martin isn’t the only member of the heavy metal outfit who has expressed his willingness to take part in a reunion. Over the past few months, members of the most famous lineup have been opening up about their want to play one final show together.\n\nIn May, the band’s most famous frontman Ozzy Osbourne revealed that he would “jump at the chance” to play a final concert with former drummer Bill Ward. Speaking on an episode of his podcast The Madhouse Chronicles, the singer reflected on the climactic show at the Birmingham Arena in 2017, saying he was “sad” that Ward was not there.\n\nWard parted ways with the metal legends in 2012, citing an “unreasonable contract”. He would go on to miss the band’s ‘Reunion Tour’ and the swansong ‘The End Tour’, which culminated in 2017.\n\nLast month, however, the sticksman weighed in on the rumours, and confirmed that he would be open to reuniting for one final show with Osbourne, Iommi and bassist Geezer Butler. “Bill Ward checking in regarding all the updates on a possible Sabbath show in England,” he posted on X/Twitter. “I’m in for playing some of everyone’s old favourites. Loved playing them then, I’d love to play them one last time.”\n\nBassist Butler then said that he and Osbourne had “agreed” to play one last concert – news that came after the Prince Of Darkness’ wife and manager, Sharon, said Ozzy was planning “two more shows to say goodbye” before he fully retires.\n\nButler later commented in June that Osbourne “desperately wants” to play the final show, while guitarist Iommi has also expressed interest, saying it would be “a nice thing to do, but whether it happens will be another thing”."
