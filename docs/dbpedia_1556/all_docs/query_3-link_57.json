Do you wanna mess with this I'm one of the best yet We got it You can feel the realness In this business of rap Go ahead [Verse 1: Guru] Fresh out the gate again, time to raise the stakes again Fatten my plate again, y'all cats know we always play to win G-A-N-G to the Starr, son Haters took this shit too far, son So that's all for you, I'm wipin' out your whole team I'll splatter your dreams with lyrics to shatter your schemes The badder you seem, the more lies you tell The more lies you sell, and by surprise, you fell Into my deathtrap, right into my clutches Stupid, you know the God must bless Every single mic he touches I've suffered, just so I could return harder Wanna be the shit starter, f*ck around, make you a martyr I make you famous, turn around, then make you nameless ‘Cause you never understood how vital to me this rap game is Save it and hold that, you catch a hot one Rhymes chase a fake n*gga down soon as I spot one [Chorus: DJ Premier] Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
