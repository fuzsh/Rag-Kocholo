        "text": "A veteran of the British hard rock scene, drummer Cozy\n\n(Collin) Powell died Sunday night in a high speed car\n\ncrash near Bristol, England. He was 50.\n\nBorn Dec. 29, 1947, Powell reportedly slammed his Saab into a\n\ncrash barrier on Bristol’s M4 while driving in excess of 90 mph\n\nSunday night. Powell owned a Ferrari and once briefly quit the\n\nmusic business to pursue an auto racing career.\n\nThe one-time backbone for such illustrious bands and artists as\n\nRainbow, Black Sabbath, Jeff Beck, Brian May, Whitesnake,\n\nMichael Schenker and Peter Green, Powell\n\nwas one of England’s most celebrated and prolific musicians.\n\nShortly before the accident, Polydor Records in\n\nEngland released Best of Cozy Powell, and former Rainbow\n\nmembers Ronnie James Dio and Ritchie\n\nBlackmore had begun planning a reunion album with the\n\ndrummer. That album would have been No. 48 for Powell.\n\nTrending\n\n“Musically, he was one of the best drummers we’ve ever had in\n\nthis country,” producer Mickey Most told the\n\nLondon Times. “He was a great guy and always had a perfect\n\ndisposition. We had a lot of laughs and he was great fun.”"
