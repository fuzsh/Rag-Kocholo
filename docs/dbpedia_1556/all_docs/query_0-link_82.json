        "text": "As a Deep Purple fanatic, I'm obviously quite psyched for the new album, =1. It's scheduled for release on the 19th July, just under 2 weeks time. I have both the CD and vinyl on pre-order (it's rare for me to pre-order both formats, but I kinda just thought \"why not?\" this time), plus a t-shirt. =1 will be the first studio album to feature guitarist Simon McBride, who has been with the band since 2022, after Steve Morse's sudden departure due to his wife's illness. I was initially disappointed to hear Morse's departure (although I completely understand why he left) - I've always loved Morse's playing, he brought a style to Deep Purple that was different to what Ritchie Blackmore was doing, yet also crafted a new and exciting sound that was trademark to the band for several decades. A Deep Purple album with Steve Morse is not the same as a Deep Purple album with Ritchie Blackmore, but is still fantastic for different reasons.\n\nI saw the band live in October 2022, meaning I actually got to experience a Purple concert with Simon McBride. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect at first, but by the end of the night I was on board with McBride. I think his playing style is actually a little closer to Blackmore than Morse without completely impersonating him. Either way, I think Simon fits in the band just fine. Well, at least in the live setting.\n\nBut then we've also had 3 singles from the new album in the past few months - 'Portable Door', 'Pictures of You' and now 'Lazy Sod' too. And honestly, I like them all. In fact, I think 'Pictures of You' and 'Lazy Sod' in particular are great. 'Pictures of You' is full of extremely memorable hooks - it's more-or-less a pop rock track with Purple's stamp of approval, and I've played it over and over since it's release. 'Lazy Sod' on the other hand, has a much more retro rocker feel to it, and in my opinion sounds a little closer to '70s Mk. II-era Deep Purple. Meanwhile, 'Portable Door' kind of sounds like classic Purple mixed with Morse-era Purple. Good stuff. I have a limited numbered CD single copy of 'Pictures of You' (5000 in total, mine is number 1915), 'cos you know... I have collector's syndrome!\n\nIf these singles are anything to go by, I think we could be in for a diverse album with =1. I also think we could also be in for the most distinctly retro-sounding Purple album in a very long time. Aside from McBride, Purple have existed with Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Ian Paice and Don Airey since 2003's Bananas, and they've been working with producer Bob Ezrin since 2013's Now What?! (one of my favourite Deep Purple records ever) - so they definitely have a particular style of songwriting that I don't think will stray too far from any of the past bunch of albums. But at the same time I think Simon's guitar playing seems to bring a bit more '70s flair to the band than they did with Morse, at least on these singles anyway.\n\nIan Gillan is way past his prime as a singer, and he knows this. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy any of the more modern Purple albums any less. He's adapted his vocals to suit the songs as he ages. I think Glover and Paice are still a rock-solid rhythm section, and I can't fault either of them whatsoever on these new recordings. As for Don Airey, well, that man's just a keyboard wizard. Jon Lord seemed so irreplaceable, and he kinda was. I think only Airey could fill that man's shoes.\n\nI'm not sure how =1 will stack up next to albums such as Now What?! (2013), Infinite (2017) and Whoosh! (2020), but I'm quite confident it will be in a similar ballpark to them in terms of quality. I think Now What?! is outstanding, so maybe it won't be that good, but I still really like Infinite and Whoosh!, therefore am feeling very hopeful overall. And I can definitely just assume it will walk all over the 2021 covers album, Turning to Crime. I must admit, as far as covers albums go, I think Turning to Crime is actually quite fun for the most part, and seem to enjoy it more and more over time. But let's not forget that it is just a covers album, and one they recorded for fun during the COVID lockdowns, therefore is not really even worth using as a comparison. I am a little relieved that Turning to Crime will not be the final Deep Purple album however!!\n\nI don't really have any major negative emotions towards this new record, just small gripes. 'Portable Door' isn't quite as strong as 'Pictures of You' or 'Lazy Sod' in my humble opinion, but I still enjoy it. I think the album cover is a bit uninspired however. Look at it! Plain white with minimal text in the centre!! Far too similar to Now What?! (maybe the only bad thing about that album), only even more minimalistic! Yet at the same time I don't really 'hate' the artwork either... it's quite clean and weirdly artsy in a modern kind of way (not that I know anything about modern art). It is a bit odd though, because the singles have their own artwork, and the t-shirt I have on pre-order is very cool. Whatever.\n\nSo yeah, bring on =1. 13 days left...\n\nJust a ramble about CDs...\n\n2004 was the year I technically began to collect CDs. I have no regrets for choosing CDs as my primary choice of musical format. Vinyl seems to be many peoples' preference these days, but I don't remember the whole vinyl revival happening until around 2010... I could be wrong, but when I take a step back and look at things, I don't remember seeing vinyl LPs in shops again until I'd hit my late teens/early 20s. In fact, where I live in the UK (which is a town with a large population, but not big enough to qualify as a city), I don't remember even having any independent record stores until the mid-2010s. I'm sure we probably did pre-2000, but I was just a kid and didn't start buying albums until I was 12 or 13. And at that time we just had stores like HMV, MVC etc. (in fact, we still have HMV to this day, even if it has relocated about 4 times since I was at school), the kind of shop that would sell plenty of CDs, but I'd hazard a guess they made most of their sales from all the DVDs and video games they also sold.\n\nI don't remember a time when CDs were ever hard to find in stores, but I do quite clearly remember MP3 players and iPods becoming a big deal in my teenage school years. Most of the kids I went to school with weren't really buying CDs... they were downloading MP3 tracks illegally on LimeWire! And I vividly remember a lot people thinking that any kind of physical music format would soon be obsolete and unavailable as new purchases. This thought even crossed my mind a few times, and I was quite fearful of it considering I'd only been collecting a couple of years or so at that point. Of course, CDs never disappeared in the end, but they most definitely were not selling all that well in the mid-2000s, even if they were generally not hard to obtain. Independent record stores were really hard to find outside of big cities then however, like I said.\n\nAnyhow, I started buying CDs for a number of reasons. For starters, I discovered the music I loved and still love to this day of course. It's such a big deal for me personally that I don't think the average person really understands just how important music is to people like me. But anyway, another reason for collecting CDs was also because they were the format most easy to obtain at the time. As stated in the first paragraph, vinyl was wayyy harder to find back then, and cassettes almost impossible by that point. If I'd started with vinyl, I honestly think my collection would only be about 60% the size it is today. Although I do still pick up LPs sometimes, I like to look long and hard in person at their condition before I purchase, whereas brand new vinyl is often absurdly expensive nowadays and I only ever buy them as an occasional treat for myself. The price of a newly-released album in new condition on vinyl is often the price of 3 or 4 brand new copies of the same album on CD. I just can't justify it sometimes.\n\nI will say that I do sometimes really dig dropping the needle on my turntable, and flipping the record over when side 1 is finished - as opposed to simply popping a CD in my player and pressing a button. But I do not necessarily agree with the whole \"vinyl sounds better\" frame of mind. I do like the little crackles you get sometimes, it gives me more of an organic vibe. But as far maximum sound quality goes, I think CDs are superior. Sometimes I don't want to hear the actual equipment sounds of my stereo/turntable... I just want to hear the music, if that makes any sense!! So vinyl is definitely a mood-dependent kind of format for me.\n\nHa! I came into this blog post hoping to blindly write about CDs... I wasn't actually intending to debate both vinyl and CD, so I'm gonna try to move back towards general chit-chat about my thoughts and experiences with CDs now.\n\nI think, if you're passionate about certain genres that aren't quite your typical mainstream flavours, CDs (well, or any format for that matter) tend to hold more sentimental value. I mean, when are you ever gonna stumble across, say, a Saxon CD in a charity shop (or thrift store if you're American)?! The answer of course, is never! You'll be flicking through endless Madonna, Ed Sheeran and Adele CDs before you find anything even remotely close to rock... and when you do you'll be lucky to find an Oasis or U2 album. And the funny thing is, while there's a whole load of obscure bands that no one will ever have heard of unless they're passionate about the same music as me, most of my absolute favourite bands are the better-known artists of their genre. Yet I've never seen a Black Sabbath, Deep Purple or Judas Priest CD in a charity shop - ever. And when I do stumble upon used copies in actual record stores, you can betcha they'll be priced much higher than 99p.\n\nAgain, independent record stores - they're much easier to find now, and spread out all over the country. My town has had 3 since roughly 2016, and I'd have been overjoyed if any of them had been around during my school years. But obviously I was stuck with the big chain shops for a long time to begin with. And to be fair, they did the job at the time. I didn't start delving into more obscure artists until my late teens, so I'd often be walking home from town with a purchase I was happy with. In fact, I sometimes used to hop on the train to Birmingham in my school years, because their HMV was so much larger and had infinitely more choice of CDs (but almost zero vinyl from what I can recall). By the time I was 18 however, I was a ginormous metalhead and attended Bloodstock Open Air festival for the very first time. I remember coming home from it with a huge stack of hardcore metal CDs, most of which you'd never find in any HMV. Yep, they've always had a big metal market made up of multiple stalls selling merch, vinyl and CDs in the main arena. I've bought a chunk of my discs from Bloodstock.\n\nThe biggest and most obvious place to buy CDs is of course, online. I didn't have my own debit or credit cards until was 18 and working full-time... this was a primary reason why I used to visit HMV or MVC for such a long time. Sometimes I'd get my mum to order stuff from Amazon, then pay her back - but I didn't start buying CDs online regularly until I was 18. For a very, very long time I would buy the vast majority of my CDs from Amazon Marketplace. To be honest, unless I'm buying a newly-released album, I never cared if I was buying second-hand or not. As long as the disc was in good condition along with the case and booklet/inlays, I was happy (and saving a hell of a lot money in the process). And I still am... the difference being nowadays is that I very rarely buy anything from Amazon Marketplace anymore. There's a few reasons why I don't buy from them much anymore, the first and most obvious choice being that there seems to be fewer and fewer choice these days when I do look there. Like, I remember there being a huge list of UK sellers selling whatever CD I was interested in, with some crazy cheap offers. Doesn't seem to be the case anymore, unless I'm just not looking at the right CDs?\n\nI gradually shifted to eBay more as the years have passed. At least you can actually see the album you're buying there, and the prices seem to be much cheaper overall. True, you do see those big chain sellers on eBay, and they post stock photos of items rather than the actual thing you're buying - so more often than not I tend to lean more towards smaller sellers and pay that little bit extra for security reasons. But occasionally I will still chance it and buy from the bigger sellers on eBay such as Chalkys or Badlands and 95% of the time all is good. Dispatch and delivery are much slower is all.\n\nA lot of people buy CDs and vinyl from Discogs. I agree that Discogs is brilliant in that you can find almost anything on there. However, I've only bought a few CDs here and there from them, the reason being that there's always a lack of UK sellers. You'll see a disc up for sale at a reasonable asking price from somewhere like the US, but then the postage is so steep that the whole thing doubles in price. I can only assume Discogs is awesome depending on where you live in the world. Unless I'm doing something obviously wrong, as a Brit it's rarely my first choice.\n\nIn terms of CD packaging format - jewel case, digipak etc., I'm gonna say that my favourite will always be the simple jewel case. They're clean, the booklet slots in nicely and if you look after and store them properly they last forever. I can't stand those thin, flimsy cardboard sleeves that replicate LPs, but I do kinda like some of the digipaks in my collection - if done correctly that is. And I really do like those book format CDs. For example, the Deluxe edition version of the newly released Invincible Shield by Judas Priest - very nice. When I'm just sat staring at my collection (which is probably more often than I should!), I sometimes just randomly grab the fancier packaged albums for a looksee. Weirdly, being able to clearly read the side of each album is a big deal for me, hence why I like jewel cases and not thin cardboard sleeves. Although I will say that every so often you'll find a jewel case with the side text facing the opposite direction, reading upwards instead of downwards - and it annoys me... it must be a weird OCD quirk of mine!\n\nI also quite like box sets, although I don't own too many. Some are small enough to fit in alongside all my regular discs, others are huge and are stored on a shelf. I don't often go out of my way to buy box sets in truth - I tend to pick them up if they're too good to miss or if they're priced very reasonably - but I do think they're neat more often than not. I love my 30th Anniversary Super Deluxe box set of Def Leppard's Hysteria, for instance. It's a thing of beauty, and packed full of cool shit. I've also pre-ordered the recently-announced Black Sabbath box set, Anno Domini 1989-1995. It's been in talks for years now, and it's finally being released at the end of May this year. Yeah, I've owned all the albums inside it forever, but the Tony Martin era is hugely underrated, I'm a die hard Sabbath fan and it also comes with the newly-remixed Forbidden, which I'm dying to hear. So yeah.\n\nLike vinyl, a lot of CDs have various different releases throughout their history. When it comes to original releases, remasters, deluxe versions etc., I can't really say I have a specific preference. Sometimes original releases can sound better, other times I like the remaster. For example, those 2004 Megadeth remixes of their older albums are horrible in comparison to their original counterparts. Every fan knows this. But then you've a remaster like Iggy Pop's 1997 remix of the Stooges' Raw Power, which absolutely slays it's original mix by David Bowie. For the most part however, I think the vast majority of remasters are just fine when it comes to CDs, but I normally don't prioritise one or the other; if I end up with an older pressing over a remaster, then that's fine by me. And vice versa of course.\n\nObviously some reissues/special editions come with bonus tracks or even a bonus disc. I love it when unreleased studio tracks are featured as bonus songs - even if they aren't great, at least they're polished. What I'm not so keen on are demo tracks thrown in as bonus songs. Only in very rare circumstances are demo cuts better than their finished studio counterparts. They can be interesting, I'll give them that. But sometimes you'll buy a deluxe edition of an album, and the entire bonus disc is full of demos and outtakes. For example, a few years ago I bought the 2009 deluxe edition of Black Sabbath's self-titled debut, to go alongside my old standard copy which I've had forever. The bonus disc is made up entirely of studio outtakes, alternative versions and instrumentals of the tracks from the finished album. I think I listened to it once, and I don't think I ever will again. What I like as bonus material is more original studio songs (as I said), live tracks or even re-recordings of oldies to hear them from a modern perspective.\n\nI gotta admit, I don't really know where I'm going with this post... I guess I just wanted to talk about CDs and my association with them. I'm just glad they never went away, despite everything that's happened in the last 20 or so years - MP3s, iPods, streaming services... nope, CDs are still here and alive and well at that. And if you look in the right places, I don't think the prices have even changed all that much - unlike vinyl. Cassettes have also made a comeback which I think is cool as hell even if I have no interest in ever collecting them. Either way, I'm quite happy with the number of CDs in my collection now. It'll never be big enough of course, but the 15 year old me would pass out if he saw the collection I've amassed now that I'm 31 (almost 32).\n\nHere's a ramble about what I consider to be the most important albums in my collection, for me personally. This doesn't mean favourites; some might be, sure, but what it really means is the albums that shaped me and my own musical journey. I'm going right back to when I was a kid, before I really started to buy music, and I'm gonna do my best to try and get this list correct chronologically.\n\nSo the first album/band I really remember enjoying a lot was Blur with their 1994 Parklife album. I liked this album from a really young age - I'm talkin' my first couple of years of primary school in the '90s when I was maybe 6 or 7 years old. Of course, it was my mum's CD, and she likes a vast array of rock music, from Springsteen and The Jam to Pulp and the Manic Street Preachers. Anyhow, Parklife is a Britpop classic. I think I liked the occasional comedic touches, like Phil Daniels' narration on the title track. But I also liked the mix of music throughout, from the punky 'Bank Holiday', the new-wave ish feels of 'Girls & Boys' and the weird psychedelic vibes of 'Far Out'. Of course, this record doesn't really sound much like any of my favourite bands as I got older, but it's still a rock album at heart, and the first significant steppingstone for my musical journey.\n\nThe next album I remember listening to repeatedly has to be Queen's Greatest Hits. I went on a long 6-week holiday with the car and caravan around Europe in 2000 (if not 2000, then 01), and we had a Walkman with us. One of the cassettes was in fact, Queen's Greatest Hits, and I remember listening to it over and over again throughout the times we were in the car. To be honest, most of Queen's singles are perfect for any kid trying to get into the world of rock n' roll. The band absolutely nailed pop rock singles throughout their career; Freddie had such charisma and an incredible voice, you can sing along to any of their tracks and Brian May's guitar solos were always crafted so well. I still love Queen to this day, but I've gotta admit I tend to lean more towards the early, harder rocking albums. I guess I'm kinda burned out on a lot of their big hits, and as I got older I realised the genius of albums such as the debut, Queen II and Sheer Heart Attack etc., but there's no denying the importance of Queen for me and my musical obsession.\n\nIn the early noughties, my older brother was into the nu metal scene that was oh-so popular at the time. I've gotta admit, as a metalhead, nu metal is not up there as one of my favourite subgenres, but I've still gotta give it the credit it's due. And while bands such as Static X, Coal Chamber and Disturbed aren't my thing at all, there's still some albums here and there that I like, even today. Some my brother had, like System of a Down's Toxicity, Korn's Issues, Limp Bizkit's Chocolate Starfish and Slipknot's Iowa - and I enjoyed all of these as a kid back in the day. I think it was the riffs and the fact I'd never actually heard anything as heavy at the time that really stood out for me. It was different, and rebellious. I remember my brother also had all the Rage Against the Machine albums, the 2002 self-titled Nirvana compilation as well as Sum 41's All Killer, No Filler - so I guess there was something about guitar, riff-based music that really hit the nail on the head for me.\n\nThis next paragraph is a bit of a cheat, but the Tony Hawk games made an impact on both me and my brothers' musical tastes. We both played those games a lot back in the day (especially my brother), and the soundtracks to those early games were bloody brilliant. Best of any video game series if you ask me (Grand Theft Auto comes a close second). Those first 4 or 5 games had songs from some bands that are a staple of my musical taste, even today - AC/DC, Anthrax, Iron Maiden, Motorhead, Suicidal Tendencies, S.O.D., Entombed etc., and also plenty of other bands I dig a lot, such as Fu Manchu, Bad Religion, Clutch, Queens of the Stone Age... the list goes on. I don't consider myself to be a hip-hop fan, but there's still some older stuff I like, and there was a lot of great rap in the Tony Hawk games. Interestingly, hip-hop would eventually become my brothers' genre of choice, whereas I leaned more towards the rock side of these soundtracks. The biggest factor to come out of this section however, is the fact Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 had AC/DC's 'T.N.T.' on it...\n\nBecause I liked 'T.N.T.' so much - the dirty riffage, the \"OI!\" chants, Bon Scott's bad boy vocals, I had to get whichever album that song was from. It was of course, taken from the 1976 international release of AC/DC's High Voltage - or if you're Australian, the 1975 album T.N.T.. I got High Voltage as a Christmas present in 2003 and never looked back. The music may not have been as heavy as a lot of what my brother was listening to, but it sure as hell was rawer and full of attitude, but tracks like 'Can I Sit Next to You Girl' and 'It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)' were also fun as hell, and catchy. I'd never heard anything quite as sleazy as 'The Jack' and 'Little Lover' either. Yep, this was it for me - I may have liked other bands at the time, but AC/DC were the first band I truly fell in love with.\n\nThe next pick is another AC/DC record, and that's because 1980's Back in Black was the first album I actually bought with my own pocket money. So I picked it up a few weeks or so after getting High Voltage, and I knew I had to go with BiB due to it's popularity and the fact it had songs such as the title track, 'Hells Bells', 'Shoot to Thrill' and 'You Shook Me All Night Long'. Yeah, it had Brian Johnson on it and not Bon Scott, but both were brilliant in their own way. And Back in Black is a perfectly-produced, masterful rock n' roll record in every sense of the word. I listened to it about a billion times in 2004. Weirdly, I don't remember picking up many more albums in 2004. It was 2005 when I really started to buy music regularly.\n\nThe 3-CD Headbanger's Bible 2005 rock compilation from Warner Music is, for me, more significant than you'd think. I wrote an article about this thing last year, analysing it in detail. There's about a billion artists on this compilation that I'm a fan of now, but the one's that really stood out for me at the time were Rainbow, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Van Halen and Thin Lizzy. I'd buy albums from most of these bands within a year or less.\n\nThe first band I properly checked out after buying that compilation was Van Halen. I just read my review of The Best of Both Worlds compilation again and I stated \"I remember my mum buying it for me as a birthday gift in '05 when I was thirteen years old and my music collection probably only consisted of AC/DC's High Voltage and Back in Black, Led Zeppelin IV, Black Sabbath's Paranoid, Iron Maiden's Number of the Beast and Deep Purple's In Rock.\". Now that I think hard about it, there's some mistakes here. I did indeed own all those records around 2005/early 2006, but aside from AC/DC, I actually think I owned this 2-disc Van Halen compilation before any of those other CDs. Also, even though my mum did buy this record for me, I don't think it was a birthday present. I think I spotted it when food shopping in Tesco or something, and she kindly bought it for me then. Anyhow, I was blown away by Eddie Van Halen's playing on songs such as 'Eruption', 'Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love' and 'Panama' etc., and even though I leaned more towards the David Lee Roth era overall, I've always had a soft spot for the Sammy Hagar material, even at such a young age. I'll admit that looking back on this compilation today, there's a lot of holes to pick. Too much Hagar, not enough Roth - but the music is still classic stuff regardless. Needless to say I remember picking up albums such as the self-titled debut and 1984 not long after playing Best of Both Worlds to death.\n\nNext up was a seriously big deal for me - Black Sabbath with Paranoid. I absolutely adored this record and played it soo much as a teenager that it's no longer a go-to Sabbath record for me as an adult. The title track is the obvious hit that everyone knows, but it was 'War Pigs', 'Iron Man' and 'Electric Funeral' that were some of the coolest tracks I'd ever heard in my life. Tony Iommi's riffs were so heavy, yet so catchy and memorable all the same - they just screamed 'doom'!! Strangely enough, as an adult, my favourite song here is probably the trippy and mellow 'Planet Caravan'. Aside from the instrumental 'Rat Salad', it was probably my least favourite track back in the day. Like I said, I'm a little tired of Paranoid now I'm in my '30s (aside from 'Planet Caravan' and possibly 'Hand of Doom'), but the influence it's had on my life is astronomical. I bought the debut and Master of Reality not long after, the latter being one of top albums of all time, to this day.\n\nMy next pick is an album I sorta, kinda stole off my brother! It's Metallica's Ride the Lightning. Along with all the nu metal he was into, he also liked Metallica at the time, but I didn't hear them until after I'd gotten heavily into Sabbath. I decided I wanted more classic metal, and this outstanding slab of '80s American metal scratched the itch for me. The songs were so big, so heavy, and so thrashy too. From the blistering 'Fight Fire With Fire', the hauntingly heavy 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', the monstrous 'Creeping Death' and the majestic 'Call of Ktulu', every song here clicked with me. I even loved the much-overlooked 'Escape'. Again, I got kinda burned out on Ride the Lightning as the years went by due to playing it far too often, but I went through many years of not listening to it - and after re-reviewing the album back in 2022, I can honestly say it's still as good as it ever was.\n\nI can't leave Deep Purple In Rock off this list. Deep Purple would eventually go on to become my favourite band of all time (sitting just ahead of Sabbath and Priest) and In Rock was the first Purple record I purchased. I was familiar with songs like 'Smoke On the Water', 'Black Night' and 'Highway Star', but there wasn't a single track from In Rock I'd heard prior to purchase. Needless to say, I was blown away by the high octane 'Speed King' and the crazy musicianship of songs like 'Bloodsucker' and 'Flight of the Rat'. Blackmore and Lord's guitar/organ virtuosity was (and still is) everything I needed, while Gillan's banshee vocals on the utterly masterful 'Child in Time' still give me goosebumps to this day. Not necessarily the most important record in my development as a music fan, but probably my favourite on this list.\n\nLed Zeppelin IV, I think, is the next chronological choice. I remember getting this album on my 14th birthday - again, it was my mum's recommendation as she had some Zeppelin on vinyl back in the day. I remember playing 'Black Dog' over and over before actually obtaining the album (thanks a lot LimeWire, anyone else remember it?) and thinking it had some of the coolest guitar playing in history. Anyhow, Led Zep IV is one of rock's all-time greats. Some will argue III is better, others Houses of the Holy or Physical Graffiti - but IV was my gateway to Zeppelin, and with 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Rock and Roll', 'When the Levee Breaks' and the aforementioned 'Black Dog', who can blame me for falling into a Page/Plant/Jones/Bonham addiction rather quickly?! Even the mysterious album artwork had me hooked from the get-go.\n\nIron Maiden's 1982 breakthrough, The Number of the Beast, deserves to be on this list too I think. So here it is. It's not my favourite Maiden album, and I'm sure even at the time it was quickly surpassed by Piece of Mind for me, but I still love the title track, 'Children of the Damned', 'The Prisoner' and the underrated speedy opener 'Invaders'. I'll be honest and admit that if I never heard 'Run to the Hills' or 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' ever again, I probably wouldn't be all that bothered since they're still played to death to this day, but the fact is Number of the Beast was still one of the first heavy metal albums I ever bought, and it's impact on me and my musical obsession is in there mentally. The album cover and imagery, Bruce Dickinson's vocals, the riffs and solos... like Sabbath and Metallica, Maiden encouraged me to go out and buy a whole lot more metal...\n\nSpeaking of metal, I basically worshiped Dave Mustaine in my later-school years. The first Megadeth release I picked up was the Greatest Hits: Back to the Start compilation from 2005. It's missing loads of classics and in all honesty isn't actually that good at summarising Megadeth's career up until it's release, but I remember I had the first 5 Megadeth records in my collection not long after owning this greatest hits package. Like I said, it's definitely missing a lot of tracks, but either way I loved and each and every one of the songs that are featured here (aside from 'Prince of Darkness' from Risk of course!). It's bands like Megadeth that got me heavily into thrash - the first form of extreme metal I was heavily into.\n\nSo, thrash metal. Annihilator's 1989 debut, Alice in Hell, was an important record for me. I remember reading a heavy metal special issue of Classic Rock magazine around the time I was 14. It broke down each of the main subgenres, with a few examples of bands and a summary for each one. Annihilator was one of those bands, and I remember downloading the song 'Alison Hell' (again, cheers LimeWire) and immediately replaying it over and over again. I loved the super-tight precision of the riffs, the short and sweet classical guitar passages, the cheesy lyrics and the almost B-movie horror-like atmosphere. Needless to say, I knew I had to have the actual album Alice in Hell. I didn't have my own debit card and wasn't buying stuff online yet as a school kid, so me and my friend ordered 2 copies for ourselves, and just like the song 'Alison Hell', the rest of the tracks on the album blew me away and I played it continuously for months on end. It's one of those albums that dragged me further down the road of heavy metal. I'm very proud of my Annihilator collection that I've obtained over the years. So many cool albums and releases throughout the years, some kind of obscure, others not so much. But great, underrated discography regardless. Thanks Jeff Waters.\n\nIt was around this time I also really got into Faith No More. I had a compilation (The Platinum Collection), and although I enjoyed a lot of the tracks on it, not all them really clicked with me, so I ended up purchasing Angel Dust not long after. I guess I was still trying to 'figure them out'. Well, I figured Angel Dust out alright. I'll admit that it took me until my mid '20s to really appreciate each and every FNM record (although I'm still not completely won over by Sol Invictus, the 2015 comeback), but this and shortly afterwards, The Real Thing, really won me over. The songs are so diverse, ranging from funk-driven metal pieces ('Land of Sunshine'), catchy alternative rockers ('Midlife Crisis', 'A Small Victory'), oddly pretty instrumentals ('Midnight Cowboy'), all the way up to bizarrely brutal compositions ('Jizzlobber'). Every song is a classic, and the album opened me up to more experimentation within heavy music.\n\nConsidering Judas Priest are in my top 3 favourite bands ever, it's odd that I didn't truly appreciate them until my last year of school (year 11). I already had British Steel - I picked that record up around the same time I was buying Sabbath, Maiden, Saxon and Motorhead records. As much as I liked British Steel, it wasn't an album that made me want to buy more Priest albums. There wasn't really anything on it that blew me out of the water, and I assumed all Priest albums sounded this way. How wrong I was. I ended up getting 1990's Painkiller a couple of years later, and this was the album that made me a Judas Priest fan. I already had albums from Anthrax, Slayer, Venom, Testament etc. at this point, so it wasn't necessarily one of the heaviest albums I'd ever heard. No, what it was, was the most metal album I'd ever heard! I heard Painkiller and automatically Priest were the kings of pure, unadulterated heavy metal for me. This is the album that I think of when the words 'heavy' and 'metal' are put together. Not only are the songs amazing, full of some of Halford's greatest vocal performances of all time, blazing Tipton and Downing guitars as well some of the hardest drums from Scott Travis you'll ever hear, but it's also one of the best sounding metal albums of all time. The production is just perfect. So yeah, Painkiller is fully deserving of it's place on this list.\n\nAt one point I was really into death metal, especially during my college years going into my early '20s. Like most metalheads in their early stages however, I took issue with growling vocals. I liked thrash metal, sure, but I couldn't get on with death or black metal and the like due to those extreme vocals. I remember downloading Cannibal Corpse 'Hammer Smashed Face' some time in either year 10 or 11 at school, and not diggin' it at first, but eventually beginning to enjoy it with more listens. HMV (or was it Zavvi?) had a ton of CC albums in stock one time and I bought what was at the time their newest release, Kill, in my last year of school, probably because it's one of the only records in their discography to not feature gory artwork. Not that the artwork didn't intrigue me, I guess I almost felt embarrassed to buy something like Butchered at Birth at the time! Anyhow, Kill was a bit of a shock to the senses; I still consider it to be one of CC's heaviest albums, and maybe it's just my personal attachment to it, but I think it's also their best. The production is amazing, and it was the heaviest, most brutal thing I'd ever heard as a 15 year old. But the music was also so technical and precise that I couldn't not love it. Cannibal Corpse are like the AC/DC of death metal - not necessarily the best band in their genre, but you know what you're getting and they're always great both in the studio and on stage.\n\nAt first, I wasn't going to include this next pick. But the more I think about, the more I think it really did make an impact. It's Meshuggah and their 2008 obZen album. I bought this when it was first released, not knowing anything about Meshuggah other than the fact this new record was getting rave reviews in the magazines I was reading at the time. It was a little jarring on first listen; the time signatures were all over the place and the riffs like nothing I'd ever heard, but some of these songs are still incredible to this day ('Bleed' anyone?). And I really do think this is one of those records that opened me up to yet more forms of songwriting within heavy music and had a real lasting effect on me personally.\n\nMy last choice is the 1992 album Urban Discipline by Biohazard. I bought this album when I'd just left college aged 18 and began to work a full-time job. I'd always somewhat liked punk and hardcore music, but never really started buying albums in those genres until I picked up Urban Discipline. I almost picked Suicidal Tendencies' self-titled debut, but I think I had UD first! Biohazard perfectly bridged metal and hardcore punk with their fast, hard-hitting riffs and street-smart vocals and lyrics. Throughout my late teens and '20s I bought many hardcore albums from bands such as Bad Brains, Sick of it All, Cro-Mags etc., but this was the album that was my introduction to the scene. And what a classic it is.\n\nIf you couldn't be arsed to read all of that... here's a quick list of my picks:\n\n- Blur: Parklife (1994)\n\n- Queen: Greatest Hits (1981)\n\n- AC/DC: High Voltage (1976) and Back in Black (1980)\n\n- Headbangers Bible (2005, compilation)\n\n- Van Halen: The Best of Both Worlds (2005, compilation)\n\n- Black Sabbath: Paranoid (1970)\n\n- Metallica: Ride the Lightning (1984)\n\n- Deep Purple: Deep Purple In Rock (1970)\n\n- Led Zeppelin: Led Zeppelin IV (1971)\n\n- Iron Maiden: The Number of the Beast (1982)\n\n- Megadeth: Greatest Hits: Back to the Start (2005, compilation)\n\n- Annihilator: Alice in Hell (1989)\n\n- Faith No More: Angel Dust (1992)\n\n- Judas Priest: Painkiller (1990)\n\n- Cannibal Corpse: Kill (2006)\n\n- Meshuggah: obZen (2008)\n\n- Biohazard: Urban Discipline (1992)\n\nThere's also plenty of stuff that didn't make the list, but nearly did... so here's some runners-up, again in chronological order of when I bought them (if I remember correctly at least). No explanation for them however, because this post would be twice as long...\n\n- Guns N' Roses: Appetite for Destruction (1987)\n\n- Motorhead: Ace of Spades (1980)\n\n- Black Sabbath: Born Again (1983)\n\n- Rainbow: Rising (1976)\n\n- Thin Lizzy: Jailbreak (1976)\n\n- Saxon: Strong Arm of the Law (1980)\n\n- Deep Purple: Burn (1974)\n\n- Slayer: Reign in Blood (1986)\n\n- Pantera: Cowboys from Hell (1990)\n\n- Carcass: Heartwork (1993)\n\n- Suicidal Tendencies: Suicidal Tendencies (1983)\n\n- Mayhem: De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas (1994)\n\n- Smashing Pumpkins: Siamese Dream (1993)\n\n- The Stooges: Raw Power (1973)\n\n- Neil Young: Freedom (1989)"
