        "text": "I think they're both unGodly overrated.\n\nIs this post supposed to be a joke? Led Zeppelin not going on speaks volumes on the inadequacies on Plant and Page and not on any mythical status on Bonzo. The fact that like SKean said their hourglass was depleted before Bonzo was gone says a lot. This was a band that if they truly lived up to the hype and status bestowed upon them, then they shouldn't have been depleted yet. Truth is that they're in need of a critical re-evaluation. Bonzo's death builds upon the myth that they ended at the top of their game. That couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nAs for the Who, Keith Moon's demise is romanticized (like Bonzo's) and in the Who's case it coincidentally coincided with their beginning to decline. Things that had nothing to with the drumming, like declining songwriting, happened post-Moon and instead of accepting that their idols were simply past their primes or less than great, they blame it on the new drummer or Moon not being there.\n\nVery true. Bonham (along with JPJ - talk about a career-spanning radar-lock!) could turn on a dime to follow Page when he was \"on,\" and - as some of the later bootlegs seem to show - also could reel him back in when he was wandering off.\n\nAgree 100%. \"Slow Dancer\" seems exemplary of what we'd have gotten on a 1981 Zep album had Bonham lived. It perfectly mixes the direction Plant and Jones were heading in during the ITTOD sessions, with the heavier direction Page says he and Bonham wanted to return to.\n\nI'm not a drummer - or a pro musician at all - but when Page always says Bonham had a talent for tuning his drums, I believe him: to my ears no one else sounds like Bonham. I can pick his sound out immediately, whether it's an isolated backing track or the middle of dense mix.\n\nWhether that unique sounds means Zep shouldn't have continued, is a matter of personal taste. But combined with the emotional attachment and the degree to which 1977-80 Jimmy Page probably could not have performed properly without Bonham to anchor him, I think it all adds up to the decision to break up being the only viable one.\n\nAnd I agree with whomever posted earlier in the thread that their legend was cemented by the break-up - aside from Live Aid, there were no MTV-era embarrassments; and there were no internet-era embarrassments at all. All casual and even moderately intense fans have are the studio albums, the official live releases, the 2003 DVD, and the O2 - all of which range from respectable at worst, to mind-blowing at best.\n\nI used to play drums and loved both Moon and bonzo, but moon would have never fit in with another band. He was the exact right fit for the Who. He was great early on, but by the time of Quadrophenia through the end, I find his talents and confidence started falling off pretty quick. the Moon cam on TKAA dvd is awful to watch, he's lost. in later years, he needed to tune his giant kit with toms in groups of 3 tuned the same, so that going around on his kit so that if he was swinging wildly and missed, it'd still sound generally ok. His skills were definitely affected by his lifestyle. Meanwhile, Bonzo before his death was getting better - Fool in the Rain for example shows his subtlely and improvement, or those cluster bomb fills in Kashmir from Knebworth, even if he wasn't as madly pounding like he used to in the 1969 clips we have."
