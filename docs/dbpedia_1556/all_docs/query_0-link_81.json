        "text": "I recently saw the Gretsch kit that Stevie played on during the Talking Book sessions. It's a RB from around 1965. 20/12/14/snare with an added 13. The kit was originally Tangerine Sparkle but is now wrapped in black nitron. The kit belongs to an engineer that at the time was 16 and was recording during the day at The Record Plant in Los Angeles. with his band. The night was booked for Stevie. Well Stevie arrived early and sat down at the Gretsch kit that was still mic'ed up as he had some ideas. He ended up playing and recording Superstition on the Gretsch kit and sang and tracked the vocal part with no other instruments.\n\nUnfortunately the kit is in poor shape but not nearly as poor as the 1964 Gretsch kit I picked up from The Record Plant in Sausalito, CA. The kit is going to be cleaned up as best as it can and will be up for sale shortly. I have no idea what the price will be on this iconic kit but it won't be cheap that much I know.\n\nI know I've posted this before, but FWIW, Cozy Powell swore to me he was the drummer whose track was used for Superstition. He said he cut it in Detroit when The Jeff Beck Group was recording at Motown, and Stevie had given the song to the band to use.\n\nHe said he did a take playing \"Stevie Wonder style\" and that's the take used on Talking Book.\n\nI did notice when he would sit in with us and play my five piece set, he did a lot of the same fills I've heard on the turnarounds on Superstition. And, Cozy's drum sound on the Jeff Beck Groups' album does sound a little similar perhaps?\n\nI used to start soundchecks with the Superstition intro. In 1997 when we were out with Motley Crue, Tommy Lee's drum tech came up one day and told me he used to roady for Stevie back in the day and was pleased I knew the intro!\n\nNo matter who is on the track, what a great album. It's my fave Stevie Wonder album.\n\ninteresting Cozy story Bun! I would have never considered it to be anyone but Stevie, but I'd love to get confirmation one way or another. All I know is that is one of my fav intros of all time. The sound of that snare & the feel of that groove. Man oh MAN!\n\nSigned Sealed Delivered had been out a year or two before The Jeff Beck Group, with Cozy, recorded in Detroit, I think. Me and Cozy discussed his Motown recording at length, and I discussed it with him on more than one tour we did together.\n\nI'm not, and he wasn't, confusing one song with another. As for who is on either song, it's history anyway!\n\nStevie Wonder layed down alot of drum tracks on his demos and plenty were used on recordings. He's a great pocket player with very tasty chops. His older act started out with the band grooving then Stevie going to the kit then some percussion bits and then the harp to the keys. Saw him open for the Stones in Alb. around 1972 and after he played the Stones sounded like a garage band from S.W Valley Alb. hahahaha, they stunk!!!! 'Most of the Stevie sessions were played on YRC as usual the wide choice of most studios. I recorded at the NYC Record Plant but can't remember what kit was the house set up! I know it sounded like crap live but I think Bob Crew did my first session work in there (1968)and he was a fine engineer along with Eddie Kramer from the Hendrix fame! Eddie was a monster and had great ideas along with Jimi. Doc.\n\nI've heard that too, that the Jeff Beck Group laid down some of the tracks for Superstition. I also remember reading that there was a big argument in the studio over the tune, and Jeff eventually fired his band, including Cozy Powell, because of it.\n\nIt would be interesting to know who's playing the drums...it just sounds so much like Stevie. It would mess with a lot of people to learn that it wasn't him."
