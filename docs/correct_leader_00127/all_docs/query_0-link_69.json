However, the opposition Social Democratic Party leader, Janez Jansa, has argued against privatisation unless the country's public interest is first debated. Slovenia has a reputation for taking a nationalistic approach in running its economy and for not welcoming foreign investment 020517 The Bank of Slovenia yesterday increased its annual inflation forecast for 2002 from 5.8% at year-end to 7%. The bank believes that inflation will be fuelled above its original expectations by what it describes as temporary pressures, notably the rises in indirect taxes, but also through the increase in the global oil price. 020711 Following a battle between trade unions and shopkeepers, the Economy Ministry has drafted amendments to Slovenian retail law that could restrict shopkeepers to a six-day working week. According to the ministry, the draft legislation represents a compromise between the two parties. 020814 The Central Bank is to investigate the request of KBC, the Belgian banking and insurance group, for the acquisition of a 34% qualifying share in Slovenia's largest bank, the Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB). 021023 Slovenia experienced record growth in foreign direct investment (FDI) during 2001, with the figures released by the Slovenian Central Bank indicating a 10.9% rise - the highest since 1997. Austria was the largest investor in Slovenia, followed by other European Union (EU) member states, contributing a significant portion of the US$3.2bn total invested in financial services, telecommunications, manufacturing and other industries. 021105 Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis has announced its intention to purchase a 57.28% share in the second-largest Slovenian pharmaceutical firm, Lek, instead of the planned 51%. 021121 The Slovenian central bank recently increased its inflation forecast by 0.4 percentage points due to 'unexpected fiscal measures' - an increase in supervised prices and a tax shock - thus raising concerns over the country's ability to decelerate the growth of prices, at least before the end of 2002. The bank had originally indicated that the 7.2% inflation rate in October this year should level out at 7.1% for the year-end, although it is continuing to follow a sliding foreign-exchange system and a restrictive interest rate policy. 030324 Slovenians took to the polls this weekend to vote in two binding referenda on membership of the EU (European Union) and NATO. Poll results showed that Slovenians had backed membership of NATO by a 66.1% majority, with an even higher number of voters (89.6%) in favour of EU membership. 030507 Ratings agency Fitch upgraded its long-term foreign currency rating on the Slovenian sovereign on 6 May. The rating moves upwards from A to A+, with the outlook on the rating improved from stable to positive. The upgrade is pinned on the improvement in the country's economic performance and its closeness to the markets of Austria and Southern Germany. 030818 Slovenia's trade deficit widened to 487.9m euro in the first six months of the year, despite the fact that economic growth has slowed. The deficit widened as imports increased by 5.4% against the same period last year, while exports managed only moderate growth of 2.4%. 031117 The Slovenian trade deficit widened during the first nine months of the year as imports rose by 5.6%, above import growth of 2.3%. The nine-month trade deficit stood at 648.2m euro (US$765.71m). 040121 The European Investment Bank (EIB) has awarded a loan of 75m euro (US$95m) to finance municipality and small-and-medium enterprise (SME) projects in Slovenia. The loan is being made to Nova Ljublianksa Banka (NLB), and is intended for a range of uses to include energy, infrastructure, urban renewal, industry and services, as well as a number of social and cultural areas. 040209 Slovene authorities are reporting a sharp uptick in inflation during January, with consumer prices reported to have risen 0.4% on the month from December. On an annualised basis, the rate of inflation stands at 4%. Month-on-month inflation accelerated from 0.1% in December, though year-on-year it has decelerated from 4.6%. 040224 The opinion-poll ratings of both Slovenia's main parties, the ruling centre-left Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS) and the centre-right opposition Slovene Democratic Party (SDS), have fallen, according to the latest poll, published in the daily Dnevnik yesterday. 040308 Amendments to Slovenia's banking legislation have been adopted by the government, bringing it into line with European Union (EU) directives, reports BBC Monitoring. The amendments include determining the procedure for appointing supervisors to banks. 040323 The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs is set to lower visa quotas for workers from non-European Union states, reports BBC Monitoring. A quota for 2004 is estimated to be in the region of 16,900, according to the Ministry, which admits this is a lower figure than in previous years. 040423 A government bill to augment the efficiency of financial market operations has been approved by parliament, reports Slovenska Tiskovna Agencija. The bill is part of a last-minute effort to pass the remaining legislation to bring Slovenia in line with European Union (EU) directives ahead of the start of its membership of the bloc on 1 May. 040514 Ratings agency Standard and Poor's (S&P) yesterday upgraded its long-term foreign currency ratings on the Slovene economy from 'A+' to 'AA-'. The rating comes with a stable outlook. S&P pinned its upgrade on the ability of the authorities to maintain a tight fiscal position, whilst at the same time keeping to inflation targets. The economy is open, diversified and has good flows of foreign exchange."
