There have been nine officeholders since the country gained parliamentary democracy in 1989 and independence in 1991.\n\nThe prime minister of Slovenia is nominated by the president of the republic after consultation with the parties represented in the National Assembly. He is then formally elected by a simple majority of the National Assembly. If no candidate receives a majority, a new vote must be held within 14 days. If no candidate receives a majority after this round, the President must dissolve the legislature and call new parliamentary elections unless the National Assembly agrees to hold a third round. If no candidate is elected after a third round, then the legislature is automatically dissolved pending new elections. In practice, since the appointee must command a majority of the National Assembly in order to govern, the appointee is usually the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition. The National Assembly can only withdraw its support from a prime minister by way of a constructive vote of no confidence–that is, a motion of no confidence is of no effect unless a prospective successor has the support of a majority. The prime minister is also the president of the National Security Council.\n\nElection\n\nThe prime minister is elected by the National Assembly of Slovenia.\n\nFirst round\n\nFollowing the parliamentary election new National Assembly meets at the constitutive session (usually around 2–3 weeks after election; the president of the republic convenes the session after receiving the official report on election from the State Election Commission), after which new parliamentary groups are officially formed. After all groups are formed (usually within few days), the president meets with leaders of the groups for consultations. During the consultations, the president tries to identify a candidate that could secure an absolute majority in the National Assembly (46 votes). After the consultations, the president can officially propose a candidate to the president of the National Assembly, this has to be done within 30 days after the constitutive session. Assembly takes vote on the candidate within 7 days, but not earlier than 48 hours after proposal. Candidate has to present his vision of his government before the National Assembly before the vote. When a prime minister is elected, the formation of a new government begins.\n\nSecond round\n\nIf there is no prime minister elected, the second round will take place. After new consultations, the president can propose a new candidate or the same candidate again within 14 days of the first round vote. In the second round parliamentary groups and groups of 10 MPs can propose a candidate as well. Vote takes place no earlier than 48 hours from the proposal but not later than 7 days from it. If there are more candidates proposed, the National Assembly will first vote on the candidate proposed by the president, only if that candidate is not elected, The assembly will take votes on other candidates in the order of submission of the proposals. A prime minister is elected with absolute majority (46 votes). When a prime minister is elected, formation of a new government begins.\n\nIf the National Assembly once again fails to elect a prime minister, the president will dissolve the National Assembly and call a snap election, unless the National Assembly decides, within 48 hours from the vote, to hold a third round of election.\n\nThird round\n\nIn the third round, the prime minister is elected by a relative majority (majority of present MPs). Votes take place within seven days from the decision but not earlier than 48 hours. In the third round, the National Assembly first votes on all the candidates from the first and second round, and if none of the candidates receives a majority of votes, then it will vote on new proposals, first on the proposal by the president, then on the other in the order of submission. If a prime minister is elected formation of a new government begins, if not, the president dissolves the National Assembly and snap election takes place.\n\nOath of office\n\nThe prime minister officially takes office after all of his ministers take oath of office before the National Assembly, following the election of government with a relative majority in the National Assembly. The prime minister takes the oath of office after his election.\n\nThe prime minister and other ministers take the same oath of office according to the Article 104 of the Constitution: “I swear that I shall uphold the constitutional order, that I shall act according to my conscience and that I shall do all in my power for the good of Slovenia.”\n\nList of prime ministers of Slovenia\n\nPreceding posts (prior to independence)\n\nProvince within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918–1941) Name\n\n(Birth–Death) Term of office Political party King of Yugoslavia\n\n(reign) Took office Left office Prime Minister of Slovenes (1918–1919) Jožef Pogačnik\n\n(1866–1932) 31 October 1918 20 January 1919 Slovene People's Party\n\nPeter I (1918–1921) Governors of Drava Banovina (1929–1941) Dušan Sernec\n\n(1882–1952) 9 October 1929 4 December 1930 Slovene People's Party Alexander I (1921–1934) Drago Marušič\n\n(1884–1964) 4 December 1930 8 February 1935 Yugoslav National Party Dinko Puc\n\n(1879–1945) 8 February 1935 10 September 1935 Yugoslav Democratic Party Peter II (1934–1941) Marko Natlačen\n\n(1886–1942) 10 September 1935 16 April 1941 Slovene People's Party\n\nSocialist Republic within the SFR Yugoslavia (1945–1990) No. Portrait Name\n\n(Birth–Death) Term of office Political party Prime Ministers (1945–1953) 1 Boris Kidrič\n\n(1912–1953) 5 May 1945 June 1946 Communist Party of Slovenia 2 Miha Marinko\n\n(1900–1983) June 1946 1953 Communist Party of Slovenia\n\nrenamed in 1952 to\n\nLeague of Communists of Slovenia Presidents of the Executive Council (1953–1991) Miha Marinko\n\n(1900–1983) 1953 15 December 1953 League of Communists of Slovenia 3 Boris Kraigher\n\n(1914–1967) 15 December 1953 25 June 1962 League of Communists of Slovenia 4 Viktor Avbelj\n\n(1914–1993) 25 June 1962 1965 League of Communists of Slovenia 5 Janko Smole\n\n(1921–2010) 1965 1967 League of Communists of Slovenia 6 Stane Kavčič\n\n(1919–1987) 1967 8 November 1972 League of Communists of Slovenia 7 Andrej Marinc\n\n(born 1930) 27 November 1972 9 May 1978 League of Communists of Slovenia 8 Anton Vratuša\n\n(1915–2017) April 1978 July 1980 League of Communists of Slovenia 9 Janez Zemljarič\n\n(1928–2022) July 1980 23 May 1984 League of Communists of Slovenia 10 Dušan Šinigoj\n\n(born 1933) 23 May 1984 16 May 1990 League of Communists of Slovenia Party of Democratic Renewal\n\nPrime Ministers of the Republic of Slovenia\n\nSocial democrats (1); ZLSD / SD Social liberals (6); LDS PS ZaAB SMC LMŠ GS\n\nChristian democrats (2); SKD SLS NSi National conservatives (1); SDS No. Portrait Name\n\n(Birth–Death) Term of office Political party Coalition National Assembly President\n\n(term) Took office Left office Days 1 Lojze Peterle\n\n(born 1948) 16 May 1990 14 May 1992 729 SKD\n\n• SKD–SDZS–SDZ–SLS–ZS C (1990) M.
