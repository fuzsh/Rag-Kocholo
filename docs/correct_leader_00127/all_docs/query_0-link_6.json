        "text": "The year 2003 is a milestone in the impressive history of CEFTA. It is a time to evaluate the results of a 10-year-long process in which we have set up, promoted and developed cooperation among Central and South European countries that has, by far, outreached the initial purpose - free trade agreement. CEFTA has succeeded in connecting the visions and the interests of its members and has, consequently, become an important regional player, both in relation to the European Union and worldwide.\n\nIt is also the right time to take a look into the near future, May 2004, when five of the CEFTA countries will join the European Union. In Slovenia, we view this as a great challenge but, most of all, as a great opportunity that will add a new value to our development. We believe that CEFTA has provided important support for the accession countries on their path to the European Union. We are confident that it will play its role equally successfully in the future and that the ties we have built will continue to strengthen."
