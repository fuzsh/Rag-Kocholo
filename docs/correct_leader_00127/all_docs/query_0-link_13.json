        "text": "Slovenia is a republic based on a constitution adopted on 23 December 1991, one year following the plebiscite that supported its independence. The president is Janez Drnovšek, elected in November 2002. The prime minister is Anton Rop, who became prime minister upon Drnovšek assuming the presidency.\n\nThe constitution provides for a National Assembly as the highest legislative authority with 90 seats. Deputies are elected to four-year terms of office. The National Council, with 40 seats, has an advisory role, and councilors represent social, economic, professional, and local interests. They are elected to five-year terms of office and may propose laws to the National Assembly, request the latter to review its decisions, and may demand the calling of a constitutional referendum.\n\nThe executive branch consists of a president of the republic who is also Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, and is elected to a five-year term of office, limited to two consecutive terms. The president calls for elections to the National Assembly, proclaims the adopted laws, and proposes candidates for prime minister to the National Assembly. A Council of Ministers to advise the president is nominated by the prime minister and elected by the National Assembly."
