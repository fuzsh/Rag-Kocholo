        "text": "Overview of the year\n\nThe Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia after a year of delay began a census of persons, households and housing, the first after independence. Data revealed that Slovenia had 1,948,250 people, 688,733 households and 775,131 housing units in 2002. Slovenia was officially invited to become a NATO member at a NATO summit in Prague at the end of November and only few days later EU leaders named at their summit the ten candidates, including Slovenia, due to become full EU members on 1 May 2004. Slovenia concluded accession negotiations with the EU in the mid-December.\n\nJanez DrnovÅ¡ek was elected president of the republic in the beginning of December succeeding Milan KuÄan who stepped down after two terms in office. Mr. DrnovÅ¡ek resigned as prime minister after being elected president and the parliament elected Anton Rop the new prime minister right before the year-end. The newly appointed government retained virtually all ministers from the previous team.\n\nSlovenian ski jumping team won the bronze medal at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics and the Slovenian hockey team played its first match in the A Group."
