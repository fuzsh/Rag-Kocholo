        "text": "Slovenia - Election 2000 - National Assembly\n\nOn 07 June 2000 the third parliamentary elections since Slovenia's independence were won by the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia, which received 36,26 percent of the vote, while The Social Democratic Party of Slovenia attracted 15.8 % of the preliminary vote, the United List of Social Democrats of Slovenia 12.08 %, Slovenian People's Party 9,54%, the New Slovenia - Christian People's Party 8,66%, the Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia 5,17%, the Slovenian National Party 4,39% and the Youth Party of Slovenia 4,34%.\n\nThe new government lasted only until parliamentary elections in the mid-October in which liberal democrats won by a landslide and Janez Drnovek formed his fourth coalition government. Janez Drnovsek of the center-left Liberal Democratic Party (LDS) was reelected Prime Minister in the October 15, 2000 parliamentary elections. Drnovsek's coalition held an almost two-thirds majority in Parliament. In the October 2004 election, Janez Jansa became prime minister after his center-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) won a relative majority with over 29% of the vote. On 30 November 2000 Janez Drnovek formed his fourth government composed of Liberal Democracy of Slovenia, United list of Social Democrats, Slovenian People's Party and Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia. The government term ended on 19 December 2000.\n\nSlovenia's first President, Milan Kucan, concluded his second and final term in December 2002. Former Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek defeated opposition candidate Barbara Brezigar in the 2002 presidential elections by a comfortable margin and was inaugurated as Kucan's successor on December 22, 2002. Janez Drnovek resigned as prime minister after being elected president and the parliament elected Anton Rop the new prime minister right before the year-end. The newly appointed government retained virtually all ministers from the previous team.\n\nNo restrictions hinder the participation of women or minorities in politics; however, women are underrepresented in government and politics. Of the 90 Members of Parliament, 13 are women, while 3 of 18 cabinet ministers are women. During the October 15 Parliamentary elections, an increased number of women were nominated to run by political parties; however, the majority of these female candidates were assigned to run in districts in which their parties had little chance of winning (based on 1996 election results). The Prime Minister's Office has an active agency for monitoring and promoting the participation by women in public life."
