The school backs up to an untamed, wooded area that is full of deer, turkeys and other wildlife who feel free to come into our meadow in the early morning hours. Right across the Missouri River from Omaha, Nebraska, Council Bluffs is on the leading edge of Iowa and the gateway to the central plains. With a population of 62,000 it enjoys all the benefits of a small town with easy access to the conveniences of a big city.\n\nOn campus, each of our suites is fully equipped with Zoom room technology so students can remotely interact with their teachers and peers in class. There are four glass suites surrounding a generous learning center that has room for everyone. Downstairs at our campus there is a fully-equipped kitchen and an open area that has a myriad of uses and leads to the outdoors. Students enjoy a wide variety of activities that include a basketball court, volleyball court, and plenty of grass for football, soccer, baseball, or other team sports. With a recent addition to our campus, students can now enjoy more indoor sports in our new gymnasium.\n\nThe Council Bluffs Campus is so successful because the staff are a very cohesive team and work well as a unit, and individually. The Campus Administrators, past and present, are always supportive and open to suggestions. Our campus has a great collaborative environment. Every staff member has unique talents that are utilized by our campus team."
