        "text": "A spectacular and extraordinarily rare wall-size map of Council Bluffs, the main transit point for western settlers and later the eastern terminus of the Transcontinental Railroad.\n\nBackground\n\nCouncil Bluffs is located on the east bank of the Missouri River, across from Omaha, Nebraska and just upstream from the mouth of the Platte. It was first settled in 1838 by a band of Potowatomi, who-reflecting conflicting impulses among whites–were soon followed by both Pierre-Jean de Smet’s St. Joseph’s mission and the U.S. Army at Fort Croghan. The population took off beginning in the 1840s, when the area-then known as Kanesville–became the main staging point for settlers traveling west along the California, Oregon and Mormon Trails. The town was renamed Council Bluffs in 1852 and incorporated as a city the following year.\n\nThe Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 designated Council Bluffs as the eastern terminus of the Transcontinental Railroad. This came about in no small part through the city’s intimate connection with President Lincoln, who owned a parcel in the so-called “Riddle Tract” and was deeply impressed by the area during an 1859 visit. The city’s first rail link to the east was completed in 1871 by the Chicago & North Western Railroad, and the trans-continental line was opened in 1872 with the completion of a bridge across the Missouri linking Council Bluffs and Omaha.\n\nA native of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, civil engineer and surveyor Thomas Tostevin (1830-1905) arrived in Council Bluffs in 1854. He had come to the United States with his family at the age of four, was raised in New York as a Quaker and studied surveying at Friends’ College in Duchess County. He and his family moved west to Salem, Henry County, Iowa in 1849, where he married and worked as a surveyor and school teacher before moving on to Council Bluffs.\n\nThe year Tostevin arrived he was engaged by County Judge Frank Street to produce the first survey and plat of the city. Judge Street had been charged by Congress with issuing deeds to citizens with legitimate land claims.\n\n“A survey of the townsite, as entered by Judge Street, was made by Thomas Tostevin, in 1854, delimitating the boundaries of the holdings of the several occupants of the land, which served as the basis for all deeds of conveyance executed by the county judge thereafter, and upon which now rest all land titles within that portion of the present city.” (Charles Henry Babbitt, Early Days at Council Bluffs, p. 22)\n\nTostevin later worked for the Survey of Public Lands, then at various times held the elected positions of County Surveyor, County Treasurer, and Mayor of Council Bluffs. In the 1860s and 1870s he attempted a number of business ventures-including furniture manufacturing and silver mining in Utah-but these proved unsuccessful and he returned to the city and to his professional roots as a civil engineer and surveyor.\n\nThe map\n\nThough undated, Tostevin’s imposing map is the first of Council Bluffs listed in Karrow’s Maps of the Middle West and likely the first printed map of the town. It shows the entire incorporated area at the time-about 1 ½ square miles in all-with the east dominated by low bluffs and the western limits featuring low, flood-prone land either side of Indian Lake (now Indian Creek). The Missouri River lies perhaps two miles further west and is not shown. The city’s somewhat haphazard layout is evident, with “Old Town” at right, crowded along a creek bisecting the bluffs, with the 232 lots platted by Tostevin in 1854. Flanking this to the east and west are numerous “additions,” many platted by Tostevin that same year. One of these is the Riddle Tract, as mentioned earlier owned in part by Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThe lower border of the map features advertisements for seven Council Bluffs businesses, primarily bankers, land agents and lawyers, but also Thomas Henshall’s dry goods business at “Cheap Cash Corner.” The upper border is adorned by seven pictorial vignettes with interwoven foliate elements. Five of the views are generic-a steamboat, a cattle drover, a locomotive, a sheaf of grain, and an eagle bearing a banner reading “From the Atlantic to the Pacific via Council Bluffs.” Of the two other images, one depicts a mill, possibly the town’s first, shown on the map at the foot of the bluffs along Bryant Street; the other appears to show a factory, but it is partially obscured by the lots of Johnson’s Addition.\n\nAs Johnson’s Addition was platted in 1857, we may use that date as a terminus post quem for the map’s date of publication. That Tostevin included the Addition at the expense of partially obscuring one of the vignettes suggests the map was produced in 1857 and the Addition included at the last minute.\n\nOne of the more interesting features is an attractive public square in Bayliss’ 1st Addition, donated by “Colonel” Sam Bayliss for use as a courthouse and public square.\n\n“While the city he had helped establish changed around him, Colonel Bayliss suffered a further indignity in 1866 when the county purchased three lots at Buckingham and Pearl Streets for a new courthouse while the lot Bayliss had donated remained a weed patch. Since the vacant lot had been given for a specific purpose, Colonel Bayliss believed that it should revert back to him and he spent the remainder of his years waging legal battles to regain his rightful title to the land.” (“Sam Bayliss on Broadway,” at http://www.thehistoricalsociety.org)\n\nIndeed, our impression of Tostevin’s map bears a faint pencil annotation indicating the site of the new courthouse at the intersection of Buckingham and Pearl.\n\nThis map is extraordinarily rare, and this writer has been able to locate but one other example, held by the Iowa Sate Historical Department.\n\nReferences\n\nKarrow, Checklist of Printed Maps of the Middle West, vol. 8 p. 41.
