These are only suggestions, things to give you focus and to get you going, and you shouldn't feel obligated in the least to follow them. But if you don't know what to write or where to begin, following the guidelines below may be helpful. Mainly, we just want you to write articles!\n\nThis WikiProject Rivers aims primarily to describe the Earth's rivers in a consistent and complete fashion. Waterfalls on rivers are also within the scope of this project.\n\nClassification standards for river articles uses the standard classifications and definitions, including\n\nStub\n\nStart\n\nC\n\nB\n\nA\n\nGood Article (GA)\n\nList\n\nFeatured List (FL)\n\nPages that are Category, Disambig, File, Portal, Project, and Template should be classified as such. Pages that are Redirects should be classified NA.\n\nThe classification, Class=, is set in the WikiProject Rivers template. See this proposal on dividing a topic into a hierarchy.\n\nThe Importance, Importance=, is set in the WikiProject Rivers template to one of the following: Top, High, Mid, Low, NA. Articles without importance show an importance of ???.\n\nImprove the quality of river articles, striving for featured articles (currently 20 articles), featured lists (currently 8 articles), and Rivers recognized content.\n\nImprove articles by reviewing articles that have been nominated for deletion, merging, splitting or renaming (see #Article alerts).\n\nImprove articles by reviewing and making changes to articles in the #Cleanup listing\n\nUpdate river articles that need attention, maps, images, infoboxes, etc. Maintenance of river articles includes adding infoboxes, adding importance, adding maps, adding images, and assessing quality\n\nArticles needing Infobox rivers (needs-infobox=Yes): Category:River articles needing infoboxes (8,458 articles)\n\nUnassessed River Articles (class=): Category:Unassessed River articles (0 articles)\n\nUnknown Importance River Articles (importance=): Category:Unknown-importance River articles (1,465)\n\nNeeds maps (mapneeded=Yes): Category:River articles needing maps (3,274)\n\nNeeds attention (attention=Yes): Category:River articles needing attention (50)\n\nThe parent of this WikiProject is the WikiProject Geography.\n\nWaterfalls task force formerly WikiProject Waterfalls focused on Waterfalls\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject River Thames\n\nFor naming in geography:\n\nWikiProject Country subdivisions#Naming\n\nProjects covering other geographical features:\n\nWikiProject Glaciers\n\nWikiProject Lakes\n\nWikiProject Mountains\n\nWikiProject UK Waterways\n\nWikiProject Ecoregions\n\nRelated topics:\n\nWikiProject Water\n\nPlease feel free to add yourself here in alphabetical order, and to indicate any areas of particular interest.\n\nAdvanstra (talk · contribs)\n\nAfil (talk · contribs)\n\nAnupamdutta73 (talk · contribs)\n\nARoseWolf - Rivers in Alaska\n\nAndy Mabbett = Pigsonthewing (talk · contribs)\n\nArbustum (talk · contribs) – focusing on rivers in Poland, eg Grajcarek\n\nAre1718 (talk · contribs) – Rivers in Bucks County, Pennsylvania\n\nAtlantic306 (talk · contribs) – Rivers in Scotland\n\nAwickert (talk · contribs) – river morphology\n\nBbossoxx (talk · contribs) – Rivers in Burundi, Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia\n\nBill McKenna (talk · contribs)\n\nCallanecc (talk · contribs)\n\nChongkian (talk · contribs) - Rivers in Taiwan\n\nCJK09 (talk · contribs) - North America, especially the western US, especially California, especially the Sierra Nevada\n\nDaniel Case (talk · contribs)\n\nDarwinek (talk · contribs)\n\nDav4is (talk · contribs) – Categories\n\nDB1729 (talk · contribs) – Canadian rivers\n\nDentren (talk · contribs)\n\nDicklyon (talk · contribs) – Creeks in the San Francisco Bay area, and aerial views of rivers, creeks, reservoirs, etc.\n\nEpipelagic (talk · contribs) – estuarine ecosystems\n\nFinetooth (talk · contribs)\n\nG.

If you find your name on this list, feel free to move it back to the list of active participants when you return to editing.\n\nRiver articles may be named \"X\", \"X River\", or \"River X\", depending on location and most common usage. \"River X\" is used for many (but not all) rivers in the UK and Ireland. \"X River\" is the norm in the Americas. \"X river\" (i.e. non-capitalized \"river\") is not recommended. When common usage does not include the word \"River\", but disambiguation is required (e.g. the river Inn in central Europe), parenthetical, non-capitalized \"river\" should be used: Inn (river). In other words neither \"river\" (without parentheses) nor \"River\" should be used to disambiguate articles. Country-specific exceptions to this rule should be discussed within WikiProject Rivers and/or that country's WikiProject.\n\nIf different rivers with the same name exist, disambiguate with parentheses using either the parent river, country or (if both in the same country) the largest geographical entity that distinguishes them (e.g. the Vils (Danube), Vils (Naab) and Vils (Lech); the Turiec (Váh) and Turiec (Sajó); and the Colorado River (Texas), Colorado River (Potosi), Colorado River (Costa Rica), etc.) The exception is UK rivers - see below.\n\nBecause there are many rivers in the world with the same name (e.g. the Columbia River has two tributaries named the Salmon River, another flows into the lower Fraser River and one more has been identified in Nova Scotia), not all of which are recent namings in the Americas (e.g. there are four rivers in England called River Avon), the following method of disambiguation is used:\n\nThe primary topic can stay at the undisambiguated title while lesser-known ones add a qualifier, e.g., Jordan River (in the Middle East), Jordan River (disambiguation), Jordan River (Utah)\n\nIn practice, most rivers needing disambiguation have been identified by an appropriate political entity, e.g., Colorado River and Colorado River (Texas).\n\nAlways use parentheses for the disambiguating term for U.S., New Zealand, Australian and continental European rivers, not a comma, e.g., Indian River (Michigan), not Indian River, Michigan, which is actually a town.\n\nBritish rivers have used the \"River, Place\" format, e.g., River Wye, Derbyshire as stated in the UK Waterways Writing Guide.\n\nA river can be identified uniquely as a tributary of another river, e.g., Rio Puerco (Rio Grande tributary).\n\nIf a river with an ambiguous name empties directly into a lake or definable sea, then the name of that body of water could follow in parentheses, e.g., Churchill River (Hudson Bay).\n\nSome rivers have names with multiple spellings which vary with the different countries the rivers pass through. An example would be the Cunene River in Angola, which is known as the Kunene River in Namibia. Occasionally, a river can have several genuinely distinct names. For example, the Cuando River not only has the variant spelling Kwando, it's also called the Linyanti and the Chobe. The following rules are suggested for choosing a primary name for such a river:\n\nIf the river is particularly famous or most commonly mentioned under one name, then choose that name.\n\nIf the section of the river that uses a particular name is much longer than other sections, then use that as the name.\n\nIf everything else is equal, then choose the name for the section of the river closest to the river's mouth, since generally that is where the river is widest.\n\nIt is important that all the alternate names redirect to the name chosen for the article title. This helps prevent the creation of duplicate articles.\n\nThe lead section should be a self-contained description including a summary of the most important things that are described in the article. The name(s) – both historic and current – should be in bold. State the location (continent/countries/seaboards), and notable facts about the river, such as longest, second longest, main waterway of a country, etc. For more information see Wikipedia:Lead.\n\nDescribe what is known about the different inhabitants along the river, along with a description of the scientific exploration expeditions/efforts. Typically, start from indigenous people and work up from there.\n\nThe narrative description of the course should proceed from the main headwater of the river downstream to its mouth, noting direction, size, major tributaries, human settlements, waterfalls, dams, and so forth. This should be at least a paragraph, may be several paragraphs for long rivers. This section can include numerical data on length, volume, drainage basin, etc.\n\nInfo on major water basins can be found at Watersheds of the world : ecological value and vulnerability. World Resources Institute. 1998. ISBN 1-56973-254-X. LCCN 98-85401. WRI 2900., updated in 2003 as ISBN 1-56973-548-4.\n\nFor the largest one or two tributaries of the river, a short description of them should be added (perhaps under a \"Tributaries\" subsection) with \"main\" links.\n\nWhen the source of the river is complex, such as a network of smaller streams, or a spring and cave system, consider if the source would be better described in its own section or sub-section separately from the course section. In simpler cases, such as when a river merely originates from a lake, discuss in the course section.\n\nInclude information about the geography and distribution of drainage basins, the location of mountain ranges, valleys, major cities, etc. Mention climate of the different areas of the watershed, and information about water quality, etc.\n\nIn this section describe the dams, diversion canals, bridges and culverts, roads, and other engineering projects associated with or with a big impact on the river.\n\nMention distinctive plants and animals associated with any part of the river. This section may also be titled Wildlife or Biology.\n\nThe evolution of some rivers has been well explored (e.g., the Missoula Floods and their effect on the Columbia River). Such information should be placed here, with a suitable discussion of all POVs when possible.\n\nA countless number of rivers have been used as means to transport people, goods, etc., and are still used so today. All such information should be described here. Stylistically, this can be a good segue from history, connecting past uses of the river to present-day uses.\n\nList the tributaries, starting from the mouth and going upstream. Add important subtributaries in sublists. Major tributaries should be links, if there is a reasonable chance of article content, minor tributaries should be just names.\n\nList the cities and towns along the river, also in upstream order.\n\nList dams, locks, waterfalls, rapids, if there are more than a couple and/or they're not mentioned in the lead or course narrative.\n\nList crossings of the river.\n\nPreferably refer to history, ecology, public policy, books, websites, etc.\n\nThere should be at least one picture, preferably a typical view. Important rivers should have additional pictures illustrating their notable features. Maps of the river's course and of its watershed are highly desirable.\n\nEvery river article should include a map. Wikipedia:WikiProject Maps gives advice on the conventions to be used. The map should be included in the Maps section of the {{Infobox river}} template. Pushpin maps showing the location of the mouth of the river should be included if there is no tailored map for the specific river. Route maps are optional, a sample can be seen at {{River Medway map}}.\n\nEvery river article should include geographical coordinates for at least the mouth or mouth and source of the river. Wikipedia:WikiProject Geographical coordinates/Linear gives advice on the positioning of these coordinates. The coordinates of the source and mouth are included in the Infobox river template:\n\nMouth: |mouth_coordinates={{coord|lat|long|type:river|display=inline}}\n\nSource: |source1_coordinates = {{coord|lat|long|type:river|display=it}}\n\nOther significant points may be included inline in the text using {{coord|lat|long|display=inline}}.\n\nThe draft proposals for features that may be handled by this project suggest:\n\nfeature main coordinates further recommended coordinates optional additions examples river estuary/mouth source, major confluences crossings, other confluences, boundaries crossed, weirs, major changes in direction, islands valley ??? both ends? watersheds, rivers, settlements, landmarks, features canal midpoint5 both ends junctions, wharves, crossings, locks bridge midpoint both ends features crossed, support pillars\n\nEvery river article should be indexed in lists of rivers, along with its major tributaries.\n\nEvery article should have a category. If a river is restricted to one country, list it in Category:Rivers of country, e.g. Category:Rivers of Germany. If it runs through several countries, list it in each country category.\n\nA country-level category may be subdivided by region, province, department, state etc. (e.g. Category:Rivers of California.)\n\nThese may in turn be subdivided, e.g. Category:Rivers of Lake County, California\n\nWhen a river is placed in a subdivision category(s) it may or may not be also placed in the parent category. This should be done consistently, so a given parent category is either empty or holds a complete list of rivers.\n\n{{Parent cat}} may be added to the head of the parent category to provide links to reports that list all rivers in the child category, and that report any discrepancies.\n\nRivers may be categorized by other characteristics, e.g.\n\nCategory:Braided rivers in France\n\nCategory:Subterranean rivers of the United States\n\nCategory:Tributaries of the Rhine\n\nA detailed list of recognized content is available at Rivers recognized content.\n\nArticles for deletion\n\n09 Aug 2024 – Kaveri–Vaigai Link Canal was AfDed by Revirvlkodlaku (t · c); see discussion ( )\n\nCategories for discussion\n\n08 Aug 2024 – Category:Rivers of the Middle East was CfDed by Sakakami (t · c); see discussion\n\nRedirects for discussion\n\n04 Aug 2024 – Betty Brook (Bear Kill tributary) →Betty Brook (West Kill tributary) was RfDed by Peter James (t · c); see discussion\n\n27 Jul 2024 – Măluț River →Talna was RfDed by Thryduulf (t · c); see discussion\n\nGood article nominees\n\n01 Aug 2024 – River was GA nominated by ForksForks (t · c); start discussion\n\n27 Jul 2024 – Suiattle River was GA nominated by Generalissima (t · c); start discussion\n\n05 Mar 2024 – Grande Ronde River was GA nominated by Shannon1 (t · c); see discussion\n\nRequested moves\n\n09 Aug 2024 – Bee Branch Creek (Iowa) is requested to be moved to Bee Branch Creek by Quxyz (t · c); see discussion\n\n10 Jul 2024 – Tonlé Sap is requested to be moved to Tonlé Sap Lake by ទន្លេតូច (t · c); see discussion\n\nArticles to be merged\n\n15 Feb 2024 – Upper Suriname River is proposed for merging to Suriname River by P199 (t · c); see discussion\n\nArticles to be split\n\n13 Sep 2023 – Mullins River is proposed for splitting by 67.70.25.175 (t · c); see discussion\n\n01 Jan 2022 – Paluxy River is proposed for splitting by FunkMonk (t · c); see discussion\n\nArticles for creation\n\n07 Aug 2024 – Draft:Whitehouse Spring has been submitted for AfC by Qwerfjkl (bot) (t · c)\n\n01 Aug 2024 – Draft:Bear Creek (Contra Costa County) has been submitted for AfC by Peter J.
