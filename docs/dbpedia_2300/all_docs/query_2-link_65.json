        "text": "How to read a redlining map: A and B designations described neighborhoods with the lowest lending risk. These were predominantely white neighborhoods with higher property value. C and D neighborhoods represented a higher lending risk, and these areas were generally where Black or other minority populations lived. These maps were created by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), a federal program intended to rescue homeowners from foreclosure during the Great Depression.\n\nText descriptions known as \"area descriptions\" accompanied and explained the maps, often using racially loaded descriptions such as “infiltration of hazardous populations” or “invasion of hazardous groups” to describe neighborhoods."
