        "text": "About the beginning of the nineteenth century the site of the present city of Council Bluffs, Iowa, — (longitude 18° 48' west from Washington, 95° 50' west from Greenwich, and 41° 15' north latitude) — was occupied by the village of a tribe or band of aborigines known as the \"Ayauway (Iowa) Indians\" which is mentioned in the \"History of the Expedition of Captains Lewis and Clark, 1804-5-6; reprinted from the edition of 1814; with Introduction by J. K. Hosmer. Chicago. A. C. MeClurg & Co. 1902\", and indicated on a map accompanying that work. It appears from the journal of the expedition kept at the time that Captains Lewis and Clark camped July 27, 1804, on the west (right) bank of the Missouri river, slightly to the north and west from the point at which the original town was located some forty-two years later.\n\nThe name is derived from \"Council Bluff\", a hill near the present village of Fort Calhoun, Nebraska, at the foot of which was held a council with some Indians by Lewis and Clark. Their journal says : —\n\n\"The incidents just related induced us to give this place the name of the Council Bluff.\"\n\nSubsequently \"the Council Bluff\" was used by early traders, trappers and navigators of the Missouri river, and by government officials, to indicate the site of that council, and later the final word became pluralized and the term \"the Council Bluffs\" was applied to the entire region of country between the (Jouncil Bluff and the mouth of the Platte river, the designation appearing upon all, or nearly all, early maps in connection with the range of hills on the west (right) bank of the Missouri river between the points mentioned. The early history of the region contains very little regarding the territory on the east (left) bank of the river, because that history relates, primarily, to the affairs of the several fur companies doing business along the stream, and, with the solitary exception of the trading establishment of Robidoux, Papin, Chouteau & Berthold, at the mouth of the Nishnabotna, none of the trading houses were on\n\nthat side.\n\nWhen an Indian agency for the Otoes, Pawnees and Omahas was established at Bellevue, where previously a sub-agency under the Agent at Fort Leavenworth had existed, it became known as \"the agency of the Council Bluff ' ', and subsequently as the Council Bluffs agency. By treaty of September 26 and 27, 1833, the Pottawattamie Indians of Illinois and Indiana, together with the Chippewas and Ottawas, with whom they were affiliated, ceded their possessions in those States and were assigned territory for a new home in southwestern Iowa, but through errors of the emigrating agents those who removed in 1835, 1836 and early 1837 were carried into territory now in the northwestern part of the State of Missouri, opposite and near to Fort Leavenworth. They were removed to their own lands, in Iowa, in 1837, and the Council Bluffs Sub-agency was established at a point about one mile above the mouth of the Platte river, on the east (left) bank of the Missouri, which was under the jurisdiction of the agency at Bellevue. Later (about 1843) the sub-agency offices were moved up the river to Point aux Poules (Point of the Pulls), opposite Bellevue, afterward known as Trader's Point, and there are indications that, before those Indians removed from the region, the sub-agency offices were removed to or near what was afterward known as Council Point. A trading post was established at Trader's Point about the time that the Pottawattamies came to the country which was known as Hamilton's, and Peter A. Sarpy, agent for the American Fur Company at Bellevue, soon afterward opened a branch of his concern at the same place.\n\nThere is tradition, supported by much circumstantial evidence of convincing character, to the effect that one Hart or Heart had a trading or trapping station at an early day (some say as early as 1824, and the writer here believes it was established before that), at or very near the site of the present city of Council Bluffs, and that the adjacent hills, as well as those in and among which the original town was built were, for that reason, known to the early traders, trappers and navigators of the Missouri river as \"Hart's Bluffs\" (Cotes a Hart).\n\nNo record has been found to indicate in any manner that this Mr. Hart was in any way connected with the American Fur Company or any of its predecessors, subsidiaries or successors; nor does liis name appear in any of the published official lists of independent traders licensed or granted permits by the United States government. If he were a white man trading on his own account with the Indians in the vicinity without a license, he would have been reported to the Indian Department by the other traders upon whose privileges he would have been intruding, such as Roye, on the site of the original city of Omaha; Pratt, on the site of Florence; Cabanne, a few miles above, and Manuel Lisa, near the old Council Bluff. But there is no record of such proceeding.\n\nIt seems to be a fact, nevertheless, that someone named Hart or Heart did conduct a trading house or trapper's station at the indicated point prior to 1832. As late as 1843 notes in the American Pur Company's steamboat logs bore mention of \"Hart's Cut Off\" and \"Hart's Bluffs\".\n\nThe precise spot on which Hart's establishment stood is not positively known, and may not at this late day be located with absolute certainty. In Annals of Iowa (Volume 9, page 526, 1870-1871) D. C. Bloomer said that a trading point —\n\n\"was situated as early as 1824 at what was in those days known as 'Hart's Bluffs', from a Frenchman who located there, and which is found upon inquiry to have been a place in the city of Council Bluffs known as Mynster Spring.\"\n\nHon. B. F. Gue, in his \"History of Iowa\", writing of Pottawattamie Comity, said:\n\n\"The first town laid out was called Hart's Bluff and stood on the present site of Council Bluffs.\"\n\nUnfortunately neither of these historians gave any tangible authority or source of information upon which his statement was based, and those of the latter were probably simply appropriated from the works of earlier writers. Surely there is no evidence now extant to confirm the fact that a \"town was laid out\" at the point and time referred to by Gue. He probably misread the writing of some earlier historian to whom he failed to give credit.\n\nMr. Bloomer's statement is founded, manifestly, upon tradition and hearsay. He says, \"which is now found upon inquiry\", but does not say of whom inquiry was made. It might be inferred from other matter in the article quoted that he derived his information from Mr. Francois Guittar, who had long been familiar with the locality. Even if this inference be correct, the facts are not conclusively established. Although Mr. Guittar may have mentioned Mynster Spring as the site of Hart's establishment, he used that object as the place most prominent in the vicinity of Hart's plant, without meaning that it was the precise spot. There was then no suitable site immediately at the spring for a trading house.\n\nThe best evidence found by the writer tending to convincingly prove that Hart's trading house was near the site of the present city of Council Bluffs, is contained in a letter addressed to A. D. Jones, of Omaha, by Father De Smet, December 28, 1867. Mr. Jones submitted to the celebrated Missionary several inquiries, of which one, with the answer, was as follows: —\n\n\"(Question) There is an earthen remain of fortifications on the east bank of Omaha ; do you know who built it ?\n\n\" (Answer) The remains alluded to must be the site of the old trading post of Mr. Heart. When it was in existence the Missouri river ran up to the trading post. In 1832 the river left it, and since that time it goes by the name of 'Heart's Cut-Off', leaving a large lake above Council Bluffs City.\"\n\n(See Chittenden and Richardson's De Smet, Volume 4, Page 1353; also Volume I, Nebraska Historical Society's report.)\n\nThe writer of this work resided at Council Bluffs from June 4, 1853 to June 4, 1874, continuously, and from about 1855 or 1856 to the date last-before mentioned was very familiar with the lake referred to — called Big Lake — now Iowa Lake — and with its surroundings, having hunted game all around its shores and over the adjacent hills. Mynster Spring, lies back in the hills a short distance from the eastern shore of the old river bed — the original lake bed — and less than one-half mile to the north and east, over a high and sharp ridge — \"hog back\" — there was a confluence of two other live springs of lesser importance and smaller water flow, situated in a broad valley among the bluffs, from which flowed a brooklet of fair proportions that entered the original lake bed, from which the water had partly receded, probably one hundred yards north from where the Mynster Spring came out of its little gorge, and followed along the foot of the bluff for a considerable distance northwesterly entering the shrunken lake an eighth of a mile or more above the mouth of the Mynster Spring branch, th(! trend of the latter being southwesterly from the foot of the blufT wlicre it emerged.\n\nAt the confluence of springs just mentioned — less than a half mile from the lake shore as it was in 1855, and much nearer the original bank — were the remains of buildings of considerable size, surrounded, or partly so then, by what appeared to have been a sod fence within the enclosure of which had been included the meeting of the springs. The area of land embraced in the original enclosure had been two or more acres, and there were indications that at a period long before the enclosed land, together with quite a quantity outside of the enclosure, had been cultivated. When passing through this place for the first time, accompanied by his father, on a duck-hunting trip to the lake, the writer was informed that the remains mentioned marked the site of an old Indian trading post.\n\nThis site corresponds very closely with Father De Smet's all too brief reference to \"Heart's trading post\", and does not seriously conflict with the location described by Mr. Bloomer. At the time to which reference is here had nearly twenty-five years had elapsed subsequent to the change of river channel by which were formed the lake and cut-off mentioned by Father De Smet in his letter to Mr. Jones. During that period the waters of the lake had been receding and the springs had been busy carrying down from the hills and depositing large quantities of silt upon the delta — part of the old river-bed lake — so that considerable land had been formed between the bluff and the then existing lake shore.\n\nIf, as the writer verily believes. Hart's establishment was located at the confluence of springs above mentioned, the line of the bluffs being the shore of the river at the time the post was erected — perhaps thirty years or more before the writer saw the place — the trapping station was only a short distance from the river bank. The \"remains\" referred to by Father De Smet are believed to be the same as mentioned herein as a \"sod fence\"; and that the place was \"the site of the old trading post of Mr. Heart\", is not improbable.\n\nIt must not be assumed that the term \"Hart's Bluffs\" of the early traders and voyageurs was applied to any one bluff or hill in particular, but rather to the entire range of bluffs extending from the Indian creek delta, wherein the original town of Council Bluffs was built, to the delta above, through which Pigeon and Honey creeks and the Boyer river pass out from the hills and into the Missouri. The same mentioned by Lewis and Clark as \"the first highlands that approach the river on that side since we left the Nodaway\".\n\nSo, while it is not conclusively established, there is at least very convincing evidence to indicate, that the first distinctive name given to the site of the present city of Council Bluffs ; that by which it was designated and differentiated by the traders, trappers and steamboat men from other similar situations along the Missouri river, was \"Hart's Bluffs\".\n\nWho was this \"Hart\" or \"Heart\" whose name became attached to the locality in question ?\n\nMessrs. Bloomer, Gue, and others whose works relating to the place have come under the inspection of the writer, all say that he was a \"Frenchman\". However, none of them give any authority for the assertion, nor does any of them appear to have definite knowledge respecting him. Their information about him is vague, to say the least, and apparently based entirely upon hearsay, legend and tradition.\n\nA most diligent and careful search of the governmental and other records pertaining to the early traders and trappers operating in this region, as far back as 1810, fails to disclose anything by which the identity of \"Hart\" or \"Heart\" may be indubitably established. Incorporated in \"Thwaite's Early Western Travels\" is the report of Long's Expedition to the Rocky Mountains, by Dr. Edwin James, secretary. In that portion of the paper relating to the \"Winter Cantonment\", near \"Camp Missouri\" — (otherwise known as Fort Atkinson and Fort Calhoun) — has been found (Vol. 14, Chap. 9, page 250) a possible identification of the mysterious person from whom the names of \"Hart's Bluff\" and \"Hart's Cut Off\" may have been derived. It is the following : —\n\n\"The principal Iowa chief was once at our camp; he is a very intelligent Indian, with solemn dignity of deportment, and would not deign to enter our houses or even to approach them until invited. He is said to have more intimate knowledge of the manners of the whites than any other Indian of the Missouri and to be acquainted with many of the words of our language, but will not willingly make use of them fearing to express himself improperly, or not trusting his pronunciation. He remained near Council Bluffs in the autumn, in order to be present at the councils with the different nations, and to observe the conduct of the whites toward them respectively, a considerable time after his nation had departed down the river to their beaver trapping. After this he went with his family to the headwaters of the Boyer, and during their stay there trapped 163 beaver; when with us he was about to go in search of his people. . . .\n\n\"This Indian is known by several names, as Grand Batture, Hard Heart, Sandbar, and, in his own language, as Wang-e-waha. During our late contest with Great Britain he turned his back upon his nation in consequence of their raising the tomahawk upon our citizens, and, crossing the Missouri, united his destiny with the Otoes. Last autumn his nation joined him and submitted to his guidance; so that the Otoes, Missouries, and lowas were then united.\"\n\nOne of the parties who signed the treaty of October 15, 1836, at Bellevue, by which the lowas, Otoes and Missourias completed the cession of the triangle of land in northwestern Missouri known as the ' ' Platte Purchase ' ', was ' ' No Heart ' ', whose aboriginal name does not appear; and he signed as an Iowa Chief.\n\nFrom ''Hard Heart\" to \"No Heart\" is not a far change, nor would it be a surprising one. The terms have practically the same significance and were readily interchangeable under the circumstances of the lives of those people.\n\nIt was of the winter of 1819-1820 that Dr. James wrote, after or during which, the Indian mentioned \"went with his family to the headwaters of the Boyer\" and engaged in trapping. In the legends and traditions relating to \"Hart's trading house at the site of Council Bluffs\" the date of its founding is said to have been \"as early as 1824\". Now, a study of the topography of the country adjoining the Boyer river valley should make it clear that, at no point other than that herein set out as the probable site of ' ' Hart 's trading or trapping station\" would there then have been found as good accommodations for such an establishment. There is no other place on the east (left) side of the Missouri river within one hundred miles of the mouth of the Boyer, where at that time existed so fine a situation for the trading or trapping station of one operating in that region ; well protected as it was from weather, as well as against the encroachment of enemies or competing operators, immediately on the bank of the Missouri and only a few miles below the mouth of the Boyer.\n\nNo stretch of imagination is required, nor is it a violent presumption, to assume that this \"intelligent Indian chief\" who expatriated himself and became affiliated with the Otoes, in whose country the site mentioned then was, actually established his headquarters at that point; and the fact that he was known to be in occupancy thereof and operating a trading or trapping station there, would have furnished good reason for the application of the names \"Hart's Bluffs\" to the adjacent hills and of \"Hart's Cut-Off\" to the new channel formed by the Missouri river when it receded to the westward. There appears to the writer good presumptive evidence to support the belief that this Indian gave the locality its name.\n\nIn 1837 the Pottawattamie, Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, removed from Illinois and Indiana, who had been residing upon what was known as the \"Platte Purchase\", in Missouri, were brought to their new homes in Iowa, and the Village of one of their principal chiefs, Billy Caldwell, became located and a blockhouse was undoubtedly erected on the very site of the present city of Council Bluffs. Billy Caldwell died there September 27, 1841. (See Pottawattamie Indians.)\n\nMay 31, 1838, a Jesuit Mission was established at the place by the renowned Father Pierre-Jean De Smet, in connection with which the blockhouse was used. Father De Smet was transferred elsewhere in 1839 and in July or August, 1841 the mission was abandoned. (See Old Blockhouse.)\n\nMr. J. N. Nicollet, accompanied by Lieutenant John C. Fremont, of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, made explorations in the Missouri river valley in 1838 and 1839, and the place now occupied by the city of Council Bluffs was referred to in the report of the expedition published by the War Department in 1843, as \"Camp Kearney\", which, it is believed by the writer, was the name given by the explorers to their engineer encampment in that vicinity, although no specific mention of such encampment has been found.\n\nIn 1842 a company of dragoons, under the command of Captain John H. K. Burgwin, was sent from Fort Leavenworth to protect the Pottawattamie Indians against threatened attack by the Sioux. Its encampment, named ' ' Camp Fenwick ' ' which was afterward changed to \"Fort Croghan\", was located somewhere in the vicinity of the old steamboat landing, about five miles south of the site of the old blockhouse; but, on account of high water, was removed in the spring of 1843 to the highlands, and was abandoned October 6, 1843. (See Fort Croghan.)\n\nUpon the arrival of the Mormons, June 14, 1846, on their way to the \"New Zion\", a battalion of troops was recruited from their number at the site of the present city of Council Bluffs and sent to the Mexican war, and a semi-permanent camp was established at the place by the emigrating Latter Day Saints. One of their number, Henry W. Miller, settled a short distance west from the old blockhouse, where a village soon took form and was given the name \"Miller's Hollow\".\n\nUpon petition presented by Brigham Young a postoffiee named \"Kane\" was established at Miller's Hollow January 17, 1848, and at a conference meeting of the Saints held April 8, 1848, in the \"Log Tabernacle\" at Miller's Hollow, a resolution was adopted changing the name of the village to \"Kanesville\". This action was taken in honor of Colonel Thomas Leiper Kane, who had befriended the Mormons in many ways. Col. Kane was born at Philadelphia, January 27, 1822; was son of John Kintzing and Jane Duval (Leiper) Kane. His father was a prominent lawyer of Philadelphia and Wash- ington and an adviser of several Presidents of the United States, including Andrew Jackson. Another son, Elisha Kent Kane, became quite well known on account of his explorations in the Arctic. Colonel Kane visited the Mormon settlement at Commerce (Nauvoo), Illinois, in 1847, and was with the Saints at Council Bluffs in 1846 when the brigade was recruited for the Mexican war. He went to Salt Lake in 1858, with letters from President Buchanan, and assisted in settling the \"Mormon War\". In April, 1861, he raised a regiment of hunters and lumbermen which became known as the ' ' Bucktails ' ' ; was several times wounded during the war of the rebellion, on account of which he resigned in 1863. He founded the town of Kane, in northwestern Pennsylvania; was author of \"The Mormons\" (1850); \"Alaska\" (1868); Coahuila (1877). He died at Philadelphia December 26, 1883. (See The Mormons.) The population of Kanesville was increased by more than one hundred percent, by the influx of Saints from Winter Quarters, abandoned in the spring of 1848, and the place gained a number of business houses, some of which became quite prominent in after years. The population is said to have approximated seven thousand in 1849. In 1852 Apostle Orson Hyde, who had been in charge of Latter Day Saint affairs since the abandonment of Winter Quarters, departed from Kanesville, and with him went every Mormon whom he could induce to follow, and the population became greatly decreased. It was probably not in excess of two thousand or twenty-five hundred in the spring of 1853.\n\nOn page 8 of Field and Reed's \"History of Pottawattamie County,\" referring to the Mormon occupancy of the place, it is said : —\n\n\"At this time everything was controlled by the church. Idleness and dissipation were not tolerated. There was no jail nor need for one.\"\n\nThis accords with information given the writer by persons who were there at the time ; but, when he went there, in 1853, a marked change had occurred. There were numerous drinking and gambling places, running \"wide open\", the most pretentious of which was called the ' ' Ocean \"Wave ' ' on the site now occupied by the Methodist Episcopal Church, at the junction of Broadway and First street. Nor was gambling confined to the houses devoted to the purpose, all of which were named, \"Humboldt\", \"Bloomer\", &c. ; but, during emigration days, when passing \"pilgrims\" were numerous, the professionals occupied the sidewalks where they dealt many kinds of \"sure-thing\" games— \"thimble rigging\", \"chuck-a-luck\", \"monte\", etc., using empty packing boxes upturned for tables, stacked upon which might frequently be seen hundreds of dollars in gold coin to catch the eye of passers by.\n\nThere was little manufacturing in the very early days ; commercially none. Of course there were artisans of various kinds: shoemakers, blacksmiths, wagon makers, etc., but theirs was chiefly custom work and repairing.\n\nThe first saw and grist mill was built by the Pottawattamie Indian Chiefs in 1841 from their own funds, the government having failed for more than three years to keep its promise to them in this respect. It was located on Mosquito creek, about two-and-one-half miles north and east from the site of Billy Caldwell's village and the old blockhouse, and was known as the \"Pottawattamie Mill\" while operated by or for the Indians. Afterward it was called \"Wicks' Mill\", and, finally, \"Parks' Mill\".\n\nIn 1848 Madison Dagger built a grist mill at the foot of the bluff, in the western part of the Mormon settlement, less than a half mile north of the site of the present Federal Building. Its power was derived from Indian creek, the water being led by a race from the original channel at Benton street, along what were then known as Green and Race streets, to the mill site. Afterward machinery for manufacturing lumber was added.\n\nThe field notes of the government survey, made in November, 1851, mention a saw mill on section 11, township 75, range 44. It was probably ])uilt early in 1851 by cither Cornelius Voorhis or Stephen T. Carey or by them jointly, being at times given the name of each — \"Voorhis Mill\" or \"Carey Mill\"— and sometimes as \" Carey-Voorhis Mill\". They made a joint purchase from the governniCMt of the land upon which it stood. Us power came from a spring that issued from the hills there, and near by were quarries of limestone, and several kilns for calcining the product. How long it was in operation no discovered record discloses. It was in ruins when first seen by the writer, in 1855. It stood at the then extreme head of \"Big Lake\".\n\nThe writer has been informed that the little powder house which in early days was perched upon the top of the higli bluff on the south side of Pierce street, between South First street and Park Avenue, was built of bricks made in \"Duck Hollow\" in 1848. His memory recalls the fact, however, that it was commonly reported, in 1853, that the bricks for its construction were brought by boat from St. Louis or St. Joseph. There was no other brick building in the town in the spring of 1853.\n\nThe first brickyard of commercial importance was established early in 1853 and was located not far from Dagger's mill. From bricks made there was constructed the first brick building (excepting the powder house) erected within the limits of the city. It was a one-story, two-room structure; owned by W. C. James and built with his own hands except as to carpentery. Its first occupant was the United States Land Office, in the late summer or fall of 1853. My father was then Register and Dr. Enos Lowe was receiver. Each office oc- cupied a room. Subsequently the ownership passed to Gardner (\"Gid\") Robinson, by whom it was enlarged and for many years occupied as a residence. It is said that the Federal Building now covers the site.\n\nNo steam ferry existed at Council Bluffs until 1854, when the Iowa and Nebraska Ferry Company was organized and placed in service a small boat named the ' ' Nebraska. ' ' The president of the company was Samuel S. Bayliss, and when a larger boat was required a few years later, it was named for his youngest daughter, \"Lizzie Bayliss\".\n\nPrior to the establishment of this ferry line regular steamboats plying the Missouri river, especially those built for the fur trade on the Upper Missouri, visited the place at the season of emigration and carried emigrants, all called \"pilgrims\" in those days, across the stream. Such fact is mentioned by Captain Joseph La Barge in the work relating to his life and adventures elsewliere quoted and cited in this work. (See History of Early Navigation on the Missouri River, Life and Adventures of Joseph La Barge.)\n\nSubsequent to the abandonment of the De Smet mission (1841) and until the arrival of the Mormons (1846), no church organization of any kind was represented among the Pottawattamies of the region. The Indians were without school teachers or religious instructors. In 1851 a small organization of Congregationalists and Methodists was formed under the leadership of Revs. G. G. Rice and Wm. Simpson, which occupied rented quarters for use as a chapel. The first church edifice erected by \"gentiles\" was due to the efforts of Elder Moses F. Shinn, who persistently solicited in the highways and by ways until sufficient funds were raised to erect the small frame structure known as the Methodist Church which for many years stood on Pierce street, between Park Avenue and First street, where it was built in 1854.\n\nUnder act of Congress of August 22, 1852 (10 Stat., 26), the United States established at Kanesville, September 2, 1852, a land office, for which Joseph H. D. Street and Dr. Samuel M. Ballard were commissioned Register and Receiver, respectively. Delay in preparation of necessary books deferred the beginning of land sales, however, until March 12, 1853. The office name was changed to Council Bluffs in 1855. The office was discontinued May 13, 1873. Subsequent Registers were Lysander W. Babbitt, James Pollard, Lewis S. Hills (democratic) ; Frank Street, Sylvanus Dodge, N. Baldwin (republicans) ; the Receivers were Enos Lowe, A. H. Palmer (democrats), and Dexter C. Bloomer (republican), the latter serving from April 2, 1861, to discontinuance of the office — twelve years.\n\nAn act of the State legislature (approved January 19, 1853, to become effective after publication) authorizing the change of name from Kanesville to Council Bluffs, became operative February 9, 1853. (See Sess. Laws, 4th Gen. Ass., Chap. 43, page 72.)\n\nBy legislative enactment of January 24, 1853 (Sess. Laws, 4th Gen. Ass., page 108), entitled \"Incorporation of Council Bluffs City\", incorporation under the name Council Bluffs was authorized. Many letters of business men immediately following incorporation were dated and bore the printed heading \"Council Bluffs City\". This act\n\nbecame operative immediately upon its passage; so, the city was incorporated before legal change of name occurred.\n\nAlthough not strictly within the purpose of this work to make special mention of individual citizens of Council Bluffs, except as merely incidental to some other matter, it is deemed proper to state that, in 1853, Grenville M. Dodge became one of her citizens, afterward becoming a prominent figure in the history of the United States, earning the military title of Major General in the War of the Rebellion and serving with great distinction as Chief Engineer in the construction of the Central Branch of the Union Pacific Railroad. In a biographical sketch published in connection with his obituary it was stated that he \"discovered the South Pass\" through the Rocky Mountains; but history accords that honor to Etienne Prevost, about the year 1832. The pass was well known to and used by the fur companies operating in that region at an early day, and it was through information and sketch maps obtained from them that Brigham Young, with his exploring party, was aided in finding his way by that route to Great Salt Lake in 1847,\n\nBy act of Congress, approved April 6, 1854 (10 Stat, 273), it was provided —\n\n\"That the judge of the county court, as such, for the county of Pottawattamie, in the State of Iowa, be, and he is hereby, authorized to enter at the proper land office, by paying therefor, at the rate of one dollar and twenty-five cents the acre, the west half of the southwest quarter of section thirty, the west half of the northwest quarter of section thirty-one, in township number seventy -five, north of range forty-three M^est; the southeast quarter and the east half of the southwest quarter of section twenty-five, and the northeast quarter and the east half of the northwest quarter of section thirty-six, in township seventy-five, north of range forty-four west, in said State of Iowa, in trust for the several use and benefit of the occupants thereof, according to their respective interests; . . . ,\"\n\nUnder which authority Frank Street, then county judge, made what is known as the townsite entry of \"Kanesville\" or \"Council Bluffs\", May 10, 1854.\n\nPrior to this, however, on June 3, 1853, Cornelius Voorhis, who had been elected Mayor of the recently incorporated city, applied to:\n\n\". . . purchase in trust for the benefit of the occupants of said city, the NWi^SWi/4 of section No. 30, in Township No. 75, north of Range No. 43 west, and the SEi^ and the SE% SWi/4 of section No. 25, and the NEl^NWl^ and the Northwest quarter of the Northeast quarter of section No. 36, all in Township No. Seventy-five North of No. 44 West, in the district of lands subject to sale at Kanesville, Iowa; . . . which lots of land above described contain Three Hundred and Fourteen Acres and Fifty Hundredths.\"\n\nThis application was rejected on the ground, chiefly, that no law existed authorizing entry in that manner; but also because protest against allowance thereof had been made by the Bishop of the Diocese of Dubuque, who claimed for the Catholic Church ownership to twenty acres in the W3^SWi4 of said section 30, on which stood the old blockhouse formerly occupied by the De Smet mission; the claim of the church being based upon the language of Article IX, of the Pottawattamie treaty of 1846. This building stood upon the SWI/4SW14 of section 30, and it is presumed that said tract was omitted from the Voorhis application for the purpose of avoiding controversy.\n\nIn connection with the church protest proceedings were had before the General Land Office and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which were pending at the time Judge Street's entry was made, serving to suspend action thereon and preventing issue of patent for the townsite until April 20, 1883, almost precisely twenty-nine years from date of entry. (See Old Blockhouse.)\n\nA survey of the townsite, as entered by Judge Street, was made by Thomas Tostevin, in 1854, delimitating the boundaries of the holdings of the several occupants of the land, which served as the basis for all deeds of conveyance executed by the county judge thereafter, and upon which now rest all land titles within that portion of the present city.\n\nPrior to 1857 newspapers, or publications having general subscription circulation, were established as follows :\n\nFrontier Guardian, by Orson Hyde, 1849;\n\nWeekly Western Bugle, by Almon W. Babbitt, 1850 ;\n\nCouncil Bluffs Chronotype, by W. W. Maynard, 1854 ;\n\nDemocratic Clarion, by A. P. Bentley, 1855.\n\nThe Guardian was absorbed by the Bugle ; the Chronotype and Clarion died natural deaths; the Bugle was discontinued in 1870, being succeeded by the Council Bluffs Times, which died a lingering death a year or so afterward.\n\nThe Weekly Nonpareil was established in 1857 by Maynard and Long; developed a daily edition during the civil war, and is still \"doing business at the old stand\".\n\nThe first dramatic performance at Council Bluffs was by amateurs, \"The Forrest Dramatic Association\", in 1856. Babbitt's Hall, in the old Phof-nix Block, was fitted with stage and George Simons painted the scenery. The opening bill was \"The Forest Rose\" and \"Paddy Miles' Boy\". Many of the leading citizens participated in the performances of the association, which contiinicd for two or three years when the field was abandoned to professionals represented by traveling combinations."
