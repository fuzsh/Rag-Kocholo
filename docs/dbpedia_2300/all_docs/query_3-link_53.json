        "text": "The South Main Cultural District is located in and around Council Bluffsâ€™ historic Haymarket area. Its vision plan sets an innovative eye to an under-invested part of the community in order to improve quality of life for residents and visitors. As South Main Cultural District is located in one of the most economically depressed parts of Council Bluffs, it has the potential to transform the area's standard of living through increased economic activity. Its vision embraces the existing character of the district as both an asset and a pathway to preserving the buildings and historic character of the Haymarket.\n\nProject Spotlight\n\nHarvester II and Pottawattamie Art, Culture & Entertainment (PACE)\n\nIn 2017, Pottawattamie Art, Culture & Entertainment (PACE) Secured funding from Iowa Great Places to renovate the historic Harvester II building in Council Bluffs into a 50,400-square-foot arts and culture center offering art programs for all ages, especially low-income youth. The renovation, which was completed in 2020, included the addition of a 245-seat theater shared by American Midwest Ballet, the Chanticleer Theater, the Kitchen Council, community partners and arts education programs. The facility serves as home for PACE, the umbrella arts and culture organization, which works to streamline fundraising, marketing, archiving, volunteer services and more for partnering arts organizations in Pottawattamie County."
