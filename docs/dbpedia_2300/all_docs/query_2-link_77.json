Main Street). Or if you are coming from I-80 or I-29, take the Manawa exit aka South Expressway through Council Bluffs, go over the viaduct, turn East (right) on 5th Ave then South (right) on S. Main Street.\n\nThe 2hr parking is free on S. Main Street between 10th and 11th Ave. Enter the 1 story commercial building of the Harvester Artspace through door 2 (2 is painted on the building) by my light blue metal sign and the Any Age Guitar sign (the signs may not shown on Google Maps street view but it is the door behind the streetlight).\n\nLoess Hills Floral suites 600-800 are further North in the same building but do NOT connect to my area interiorly so please do NOT use door 1. (Please note that despite corrections attempted, some old map links/apps may erroneously direct you to Jennie Edmundson Hospital instead of the newer clinic site which is NOT part of the hospital campus).\n\nThanks! If you have trouble with directions, you are welcome to try texting or calling me at 402-915-2756 for assistance. Please understand that I may be unable to answer immediately if I am with another patient.\n\nCB Skin Secrets\n\n1010 S Main St., Suite 500\n\nCouncil Bluffs, IA 51503\n\n402-915-2756\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/g32ZXPxySVpXRFjeA"
