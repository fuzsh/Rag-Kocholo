Is Quicken the culprit? If so, sayig yes then requires a 6-digit passcode. Nowhere do I see Quicken requesting the 2-factor verification. So after the first time, we keep denying access. Any ideas?\n\nI solved the problem. I went to the tab \"Bills & Income\". Next to the Apple Card was a clock and on the right a button that said \"Fix it.\" I clicked on the button. It then went to a window where as I was entering my Apple ID, I again received the alert on my phone. When I accepted it and received the 6 digit code, Quicken asked for the 6-digit code. I don't know why I was receiving so many requests, I suspect that every time Quickem was trying to check — hence, the clock — I would receive the message. Thank you all for your thoughts and help.\n\n2\n\nHello @Harold-Jr,\n\nThank you for reaching out to the Community. Could you give me a bit more context what is happening and when? Is this a text message? Is it an email? Is it showing up randomly or is it being triggered specifically when you are accessing Quicken? Do you have a VPN that may be making it look like you're accessing your Apple account from Council Bluffs, IA?\n\nThank you.\n\nI solved the problem. I went to the tab \"Bills & Income\".
