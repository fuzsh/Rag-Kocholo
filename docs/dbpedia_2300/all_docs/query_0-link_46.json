We assure our patrons that, as in the past, nothing will be left undone by us in our effort to give them a Directory as nearly perfect as experience, continued vigilance, time, and money can make it. We wish to impress our constantly increasing number of friends and patrons that the claims of this publication for patronage are: 1. It is honestly revised twice a year. 2. It is complete, up-to-date, and is published nearer to the date of the information it contains than is any other similar publication. 3. It is printed in tabulated form, all similar items being placed in the same column, for the purpose of comparison —more expensive, but more satisfactory to the user. 4. It is beautifully printed in clear readable type. 5. It gives to advertisers a country-wide circulation, covering practically all of the banks in America and thousands of the large corporations and lawyers’ offices, a circulation eight times that of any other similar publication and larger than that of all similar publications combined. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis RAND M9NALLY & COMPANY 4 BANKERS TRUST COMPANY £•, Pay to % THtOftOCDOP. % com.******* nm* ** FIRST NATIONAL BANK, <^W! w#**x*, BAHKert&TRMSt COMPANY.

While cross-indexing of more important classifications are included in the Classified Section, complete listings in every case may be found here. The various classifications under which firm names appear are designated by number, and the figures below refer to these and not to the pages on which the listings appear in the Classified Section. In the Classified Section the various headings are arranged according to the noun-first principle. In some cases, however, this rule does not apply. Also, there may be several common terms which apply to the same article or service. To meet this condition, the Finding List below includes all classifications listed in every conceivable way, with cross-indexes to the standard^ headings and references to others closely related.
