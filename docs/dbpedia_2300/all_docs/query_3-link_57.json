        "text": "The best way to provide immediate relief to your neighbors facing emergency situations is through a monetary donation. Our disaster assistance programs rely heavily on the generous financial support of citizens in the Iowa-Nebraska region. Even if you only have a few dollars to spare, your donation to American Red Cross disaster relief will make a significant difference in the lives of those facing disasters. Make a one-time donation today either online, by phone, or by mail, or set up a recurring monthly donation to make an even bigger difference.\n\nThe humanitarian work that we do at American Red Cross would not be possible without our volunteers. We have a variety of disaster relief volunteer opportunities available, as well as potential positions focused on facility management, health and safety, service to the Armed Forces, and professional specialties like photography, IT, and more. Check out our current volunteer opportunities near you in Omaha, Nebraska and Council Bluffs, Idaho!\n\nHost a charity stream by playing your favorite video games while raising life-saving funds to help those in need.
