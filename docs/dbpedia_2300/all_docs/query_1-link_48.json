        "text": "In 1867, the library opened on the second floor of what then was known as the Empire Block, located on the southeast corner of Broadway and Main Street. Several hundred books were donated to the Association to create the library’s collection.\n\nIn June 1867, a fire destroyed the Empire block, and along with it, the Young Men’s Library Association and all the books in the collection. (accompanying picture)\n\n1873\n\nIn 1873, Anthony W. Street, an active and controlling member of the Young Men’s Christian Association, offered the library free use of a rear room in the Woodbury building next to the corner of Pearl Street and First Avenue, with the understanding that Y.M.C.A. officers would manage the library.\n\n1880\n\nIn 1880, the women of the board pushed to establish the library on a permanent basis by having the city vote on an annual tax for its maintenance, as provided by the Code of Iowa. An ordinance was passed to submit the proposition to a public vote, but the mayor at the time refused in his election proclamation to include the proposal, based on advice from the City Attorney that cities incorporated under special charters were not included in the general law.\n\nThe women printed the ballots anyway and the proposition carried by a “handsome majority.” The City Council then refused to proclaim the results until Judge C.F. Loufbourow of the Circuit Court issued a mandamus, ordering the City Council to levy the tax.\n\nOn November 28, 1881, the City Council passed an ordinance to establish a Free Public Library and a municipal tax of one-half mill* was levied. The City Council appointed the following to the Board of Trustees: Horace Everett, Dexter C. Bloomer, Thomas Officer, Jefferson P. Casady, Joseph R. Reed, John H. Keatley, Rev. Cyrus Hamlin, Anthony W. Street, and W. R. Vaughan. Horace Everett was elected as the first president and Mrs. Maria F. Davenport as librarian.\n\n*A mill levy is a tax rate that is applied to assessed property value. A one mill levy equates to one dollar per every $1,000 of assessed value.\n\nOn April 24, 1882, the Free Public Library opened to the public. It was located on the second story of 12 Pearl Street, on the Everett Block.\n\nLeft: The Everett Block\n\nRight: Sanborn Fire Map, 1885\n\nSee larger image of building and map.\n\n1902\n\nIn 1902, the City began raising capitol to secure a site for building a library, something that had been regularly discussed by the library board since 1884. Starting in July of 1902, the library board began to reach out and inquire about Andrew Carnegie’s willingness to donate money for a new library in Council Bluffs.\n\nIn July of 1995, a fund drive began to raise capital for a new building. The City Council appropriated $2.25 million to kick off the campaign. By 1997, over $13.5 million had been raised, with half coming from the Iowa West Foundation. Other donors included companies and foundations, as well as individuals."
