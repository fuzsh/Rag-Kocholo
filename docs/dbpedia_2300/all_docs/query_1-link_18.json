        "text": "I've lived in Council Bluffs for a little over seven months. My 3rd grader is LOVING her public school. She comes home happy almost daily and her grades have improved.\n\nThere are some dirtier parts, but a majority of Council Bluffs is average to nice. There's plenty of opportunity for an active lifestyle here and the people have been friendly.\n\nThe city is also just over the bridge from Omaha's downtown nightlife and some amazing parks, so that's a nice bonus.\n\nMy daughter and I feel very safe here and we're looking forward to staying for a few years.\n\nThis area makes it incredibly easy for a single mom to not only live but thrive.\n\nI have only been living in council bluffs for about 5 years, moved here from omaha but I like it so much better. It only takes about 15 minutes to get from one side of Council Bluffs to the next. My commute to work is 5 minutes and everywhere and everything I need is so close. Love the community here."
