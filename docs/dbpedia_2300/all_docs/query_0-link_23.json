These areas are groupings of neighbouring metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas that have economic and social links as measured by commuting to work, but at lower levels than are located among U.S. counties within individual metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. Combined statistical areas can be characterized as representing more significant regions that reflect wide-ranging social and economic cooperations, such as wholesaling, commodity distribution, and weekend holiday activities, as well as lower levels of daily commuting interaction.\n\n15 Most Populous Combined Statistical Areas in the U.S.\n\nUnder the 2010 Standards for Delineating Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas, a combined statistical area is identified when two adjacent metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas have an employment interchange measure (EIM) of at least 15. (The EIM is defined as the sum of the percentage of employed residents of the smaller area who work in, the larger area and the rate of employment in the smaller area that is accounted for by workers who reside in, the larger region).\n\n30 Most Populous Combined Statistical Areas in the U.S.\n\nBelow is the map of 169 combined statistical areas containing more than 550 metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas in the United States and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe 169 Combined Statistical Areas\n\nThe Combined statistical areas ranked by population"
