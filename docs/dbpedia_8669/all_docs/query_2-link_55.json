        "text": "DATE February 7, 2003 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/Aâ¨ TIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM AUDIENCE N/Aâ¨ NETWORK NPRâ¨ PROGRAM Fresh Airâ¨â¨Interview: Actor Michael Caine discusses his acting career and hisâ¨lifeâ¨TERRY GROSS, host:â¨â¨This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.â¨â¨My guest, Michael Caine, has made over 80 films in 40 years. Now he'sâ¨starring in \"The Quiet American,\" a film whose release was postponed in theâ¨aftermath of September 11th reportedly because of concerns that the film wasâ¨too politically touchy at a time when Hollywood felt more comfortable withâ¨unambiguously patriotic movies. \"The Quiet American\" is based on Grahamâ¨Greene's 1955 murder mystery set in French Indochina before the country becameâ¨Vietnam. It's directed by Phillip Noyce and co-stars Brendan Fraser as aâ¨young CIA operative. Caine plays Thomas Fowler, a cynical British journalistâ¨who has spent 20 years in Indochina.â¨â¨(Soundbite of \"The Quiet American\")â¨â¨Mr. MICHAEL CAINE (As Thomas Fowler): They say whatever you're looking for,â¨you will find here. They say you come to Vietnam and you understand a lot inâ¨a few minutes. The rest has got to be lived. The smell--that's the firstâ¨thing that hits you, promising everything in exchange for your soul. And theâ¨heat ...(unintelligible) you can hardly remember your name or what you came toâ¨escape from. But at night, there's a breeze, the river is beautiful, youâ¨could be forgiven for thinking that there is no war, that the gunshots wereâ¨fireworks and only pleasure measures, a pipe of opium or the touch of a girlâ¨who might tell you she loves you. And then something happens, as you knew itâ¨would, and nothing can ever be the same again.â¨â¨GROSS: Michael Caine first established himself as a playboy in \"Alfie\" and asâ¨a crook turned secret agent in \"The Ipcress File.\" He won Academy Awards forâ¨his roles in \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" and \"The Cider House Rules.\" His otherâ¨films include \"Alfie,\" \"Dressed to Kill,\" \"Educating Rita,\" \"Mona Lisa,\"â¨\"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\" and \"Little Voice.\" Of course, some of his 80-plusâ¨films were stinkers, like \"The Swarm,\" \"Jaws: The Revenge\" and \"Beyond theâ¨Poseidon Adventure.\"â¨â¨Caine has said that an actor's eyes are his most important asset. His voiceâ¨is the second most important asset. Caine is one of the most distinctiveâ¨voices in film. I spoke with him in 1992 and asked him how he realized hisâ¨own voice was an asset.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Well, I realized it when I first went into the theater. Myâ¨natural voice--having a Cockney accent for a start was difficult, but also,â¨it's where the voice is placed, and Cockneys naturally talk--I'll try and getâ¨up there. It's right up in the throat here and rather like John Major, ourâ¨prime minister. He talks like that. And the trick was to bring my voice downâ¨to the diaphragm, if you can imagine if it's right up here in the throat andâ¨then they bring it down a little bit further, like another one of ourâ¨politicians who talks like that, and it's rather strangulated.â¨â¨But if you're going to boom out in the theater without deafening the people atâ¨the front, you've got to be able to project your voice. And my first wifeâ¨taught me how to do that in about 20 minutes, and that was the most importantâ¨thing that ever happened to me with my voice, which was it was placed. Andâ¨the second thing was that, over a period of years, I never went to the normalâ¨diction lessons that you had. British actors always spoke terribly like thatâ¨and they all spoke exactly the same because they all learned how to speak atâ¨RADA, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. And what happened to me is I workedâ¨on my own because I was never a trained actor, and I worked on my own voice.â¨So what happened was, is I came out of it with a voice that was correctlyâ¨placed by accident, and a very, very individual accent. My accent is soâ¨individual that people who don't recognize me by sight, the minute I open myâ¨mouth they know who I am.â¨â¨GROSS: Absolutely. Absolutely. So how did you learn where to--how to lowerâ¨your voice? What did your wife tell you in the 20 minutes?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: She--it's very difficult to do on radio because you put her handâ¨on my throat and if--what I'm doing is I'm putting my hand on my throat, andâ¨if I talk up here and if you were to talk right about there, you've got yourâ¨hands on your windpipe, you'd find it all very tight, very, very tight. Andâ¨then she gradually moved down to the top of my chest and then felt theâ¨vibration and said, `Hit the vibration,' and she put her hand on my chest atâ¨the top and said, `Make the vibration hit there,' so my voice came down toâ¨sort of here. And then she brought it down a little further, and I hit theâ¨vibration here, and then she brought it right down to the bottom, which is theâ¨diaphragm. And it was just a case of making her hand vibrate on my chest asâ¨she brought her hand down.â¨â¨GROSS: Now when you decided to work on your accent, what did you do to workâ¨on it?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Well, I didn't do anything really because I went into repertory,â¨which means that I used to do a play a week for 50 weeks a year, and so I wasâ¨always playing someone different. And in England, we have a lot of regionalâ¨accents, lots of class accents, and so I could do almost any accent, so what Iâ¨actually did was I kept my own voice. What actually altered my voiceâ¨tremendously was becoming a movie actor in the United States. When \"Alfie\"â¨was released here, the first inkling I got that it was going to be released inâ¨America at all--because I'd never been to America when \"Alfie\" was made and Iâ¨didn't expect the film to come over here. But the first inkling I got wasâ¨they said, `You've got to do 125 loops,' which means lines of dialogue, whichâ¨are on a sort of tape loop, `to make it more understandable to the Americanâ¨ear.' And so I did 125 American loops, and if you actually listen to theâ¨American version of \"Alfie,\" it sounds as though I can't do a Cockneyâ¨accent...â¨â¨(Soundbite of laughter)â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: ...because I keep getting it wrong. But, I mean, it wasâ¨deliberate. But also, I very quickly realized that it wasn't the rhythm ofâ¨the voice that worried the Americans, it was the speed. The British speakâ¨very, very quickly and very, very--in a very clipped way. As a matter ofâ¨fact, I lived in America for a long time. I lived for nine years in Losâ¨Angeles, and I remember on one occasion I had been in America without leavingâ¨for about 10 months, I hadn't been back to England, and I was watching aâ¨British film on television with everybody talking terribly like the Britishâ¨clipped way, and I suddenly realized I couldn't understand what anybody wasâ¨talking about. And I realized the American problem. It's because we cut offâ¨the end of words and we talk terribly, terribly quickly.â¨â¨GROSS: Now did your Cockney accent stand in your way at all when you wereâ¨first starting to make movies? Also because England has a much more rigidâ¨class system...â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Sure.â¨â¨GROSS: ...in a way than America does, although we certainly have a classâ¨system here.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah. Well, you have a class system here, but you can't tell itâ¨by people's accents. In England, I can listen to a person and I'll tell youâ¨how much his house cost, how much he earns, what sort of car he drives afterâ¨listening to him for three minutes. That's how defined by accent you are.â¨The only drawback with a Cockney accent was nobody, of course, put you intoâ¨Shakespeare because, you know, you have to learn how to speak in verse andâ¨iambic pentameters and everything, but even that I did. I did Horatio. Iâ¨played Horatio to Christopher Plummer's Hamlet on television and got away withâ¨it. But normally, in England, in the theater, when I came into it, there wereâ¨no leading parts written for anybody in my natural accent. I always had toâ¨put on another accent. So in actual fact, from that point of view, it didâ¨hold me back a bit for a while.â¨â¨GROSS: Now in the movie \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,\" you and Steve Martinâ¨starred, and you were this really kind of upper-class, elegant womanizer whoâ¨came on to wealthy women and scammed them and took their money, where Steveâ¨Martin was a real kind of nickel-and-dime scam artist out for the same thing,â¨wealthy women. And you taught him how to really do the more aristocraticâ¨version of it. What kind of accent did you use for that?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Well, that would be the British upper-middle-class accent. It wasâ¨always the people--the upper middle class usually have the pretensions of theâ¨aristocrat without the class and also the pretensions of the rich without theâ¨money. And so what you get is someone with absolutely no substance who is allâ¨front, and so you get a voice which is terribly like that and it's very smoothâ¨and very, very slow.â¨â¨GROSS: Now another great role that I have to ask you about your voice in wasâ¨in \"Mona Lisa,\" in which you played a crime boss, like a gangster...â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yes.â¨â¨GROSS: ...and Bob Hoskins played somebody who was kind of under you in there,â¨and you were really intimidating him in your scenes in the film. It's aâ¨fantastic performance by you. Can you talk about how you used your voice inâ¨that? Because you needed to use it in a way that showed real authority andâ¨the willingness to intimidate and, if necessary, hurt somebody.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah. Authority is shown not only by voice, but by movement, andâ¨what it is, is first thing in authority is you never move. Only people whoâ¨are trying to attract your attention with no power move their hands. If youâ¨look at aristocracy and really powerful people, they move very little becauseâ¨everybody is awaiting their every word, wish or command, and their voice isâ¨very, very slow because everybody will wait while they have their thought andâ¨wait no matter how long it takes for them to say what they're going to say.â¨â¨What you have to add in this case, where I played a gangster, which would beâ¨menace, and menace would come if you--I mean, in that, I had a gangsterâ¨accent, which is, again, working-class Cockney accent, but there is a sort ofâ¨cheerful, chirpy working-class sort of `Hello, lads. Let's all go down toâ¨pub' and all this, you know, that sort of accent for the chirpy Cockney lad,â¨cheerful little soul. But then there's another one, which is--it's kind ofâ¨very drawn out and it's very flat. And so they will actually say things toâ¨you--I mean, I grew up with gangsters like this, and they will say, `I likeâ¨you,' and there's absolutely no emotion in the voice whatsoever. It's like anâ¨icicle, you know? They say, `I think you're one of the nicest fellows I'veâ¨ever met. I really do. I really think you're very nice. So'--and then theyâ¨say silly little things. When you know you're in trouble with a Cockneyâ¨gangster, he'll say something like, `Well, who's been naughty then?'â¨â¨(Soundbite of laughter)â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Now that question means you're probably going to get kneecapped toâ¨the floor. But it's one of those things, just flattening the voice out, theâ¨voice just flattens right out no matter what you say. It just flattens.â¨Flattens.â¨â¨GROSS: Now when you say you're in a position of power and authority, youâ¨don't move a lot.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: No.â¨â¨GROSS: That means you don't blink a lot, too.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: No. Oh, that's a trick for actors on film that I used and it wasâ¨was told--I think the first place I heard it was Marlene Dietrich who said itâ¨first, is that you don't blink. If you blink on camera, it signifiesâ¨weakness. It's very difficult to do this trick on radio...â¨â¨(Soundbite of laughter)â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: ...about blinking, but if you look in the mirror at yourself, lookâ¨in the mirror at yourself and just stare and start saying things to yourself,â¨you'll see how powerful it is. And if you just blink once in the middle ofâ¨it, you'll see how it all dissipates. It just dissipates the whole thing.â¨And, of course, if you're on a movie screen, you have to remember when youâ¨blink, each eyelid is somewhere between two to seven feet wide, if you're in aâ¨close-up.â¨â¨GROSS: That's a good point.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah.â¨â¨GROSS: Well, how do you learn to not blink? It's hard to not blink. Yourâ¨eyes start to hurt. You can do it for a little bit, but after a while, it's aâ¨real strain.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: You just walk around--I've walked around all my life not--when Iâ¨was a young lad--I wrote about this in the book. When I was a young lad, Iâ¨found a book in the public library, \"How to Teach Yourself Film Acting,\"â¨and the first thing it said in it is you must not blink. And so I walkedâ¨around...â¨â¨(Soundbite of laughter)â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: ...this sort of working-class district of London, which was usedâ¨to some very rough people, you know, without blinking, and I looked like aâ¨sort of early serial killer.â¨â¨(Soundbite of laughter)â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: I'm sure I frightened the life out of people, because I used toâ¨have long conversations with people and never blink. And I would watch peopleâ¨getting hypnotized. And they would walk away from a quite simple conversationâ¨with me quite flummoxed as to actually what went on.â¨â¨GROSS: My guest is Michael Caine. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.â¨â¨(Soundbite of music)â¨â¨GROSS: Let's get back to our 1992 interview with actor Michael Caine.â¨â¨You were born actually not only working-class, it was really a pretty poorâ¨family. You were born in the charity ward of the hospital. Your father was aâ¨porter at the fish market, your mother a cleaning woman. You spent severalâ¨years in an apartment that had no electricity.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah. Oh, I never lived in a house that had electricity until Iâ¨was 12 years old, which was in 1948.â¨â¨GROSS: So what did your friends think of your ambition to act?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Oh, they thought it was completely ridiculous, utterly derisory.â¨I mean, no one--I mean, I was just treated with absolute contempt by everybodyâ¨or ridicule.â¨â¨GROSS: Now why ridicule? I mean...â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Because--well, for a start, people of my class and in that societyâ¨never went into show business, no one knew anybody who was in show business orâ¨anything. And also, like, my family, the male members of my family wouldâ¨regard any male going into show business or acting as being homosexual anyway,â¨or a possible homosexual. There was a tremendous gay inference. I mean, weâ¨didn't use the word `gay' in those days, but if you said--when I said to myâ¨father I was going to be an actor, it was the equivalent of telling him I wasâ¨a homosexual as far as he was concerned.â¨â¨GROSS: So did you feel that you had to do things to prove your manhood whileâ¨studying acting?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: No, I was already doing those, but my father didn't know about it.â¨â¨(Soundbite of laughter)â¨â¨GROSS: I think I get what you're saying.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yes. But I really had to prove to him--I married very young,â¨which I sometimes think was an effort to prove to him that I wasn't gay. Andâ¨I had a child when I was 22. I had a daughter when I was 22. And, of course,â¨with his simple-minded way of looking at it, he was again wrong because theâ¨fact that I was married and had a baby meant to him that I was definitely notâ¨a homosexual. And so he was wrong in both cases, you know, because there areâ¨a lot of people who are married with children who are homosexuals. But he hadâ¨a very simplistic view of the world. I mean, he was a very, very tough man, Iâ¨mean, and it's very hard to get across to anybody just how tough he was. Backâ¨again to the gay analogy, he actually thought that any man who ate chicken wasâ¨gay.â¨â¨GROSS: Chicken?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yes.â¨â¨GROSS: Why?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Because this red meat thing, you know, real men ate red meat andâ¨all this stuff, and he thought that was sissy food, chicken.â¨â¨GROSS: Did he ever come see you in a performance or see your movies?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: No. No. No, he died when I was completely out of work,â¨completely broke. He died of cancer when he was 56 years old, so heâ¨never--one of my great regrets in my life is that his last memories of me wasâ¨as a complete nothing, disaster and failure. But at least he knew I wasn'tâ¨gay because I had a wife and a child.â¨â¨(Soundbite of laughter)â¨â¨GROSS: Right. In your \"Master Class\" acting video, you say that most screenâ¨tests show fear. What was your screen test?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: My screen test which showed fear was for \"Zulu.\" I did a screenâ¨test for \"Zulu.\" I did it on a Saturday morning and I saw the director, Cyâ¨Endfield, at a party on the--I did it on a Friday morning, I saw the directorâ¨Cy Endfield at a party on Saturday night, and he ignored me all evening, so Iâ¨thought, `Oh, well, he's seen the test. That part, that's gone.' And thenâ¨just as he was leaving, about midnight he was leaving this party, he came overâ¨to me on the way out and he said, `That was the worst screen test I've everâ¨seen in my life.' I said, `All right. Well, that's fine,' you know. But heâ¨said, `You've got the part.' So I said, `Well, if it was such a bad screenâ¨test, why are you giving me the part?' He said, `Because we can't findâ¨anybody else and we leave on Monday.'â¨â¨(Soundbite of laughter)â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: So that was how I got into \"Zulu.\" But the test was terrifyingâ¨for me. We did it in a--you know what happens? All your life you think, `Iâ¨think I would work on screen,' you know, because there is something magicalâ¨that happens on screen. You know, if your personality or your talent orâ¨whatever it is works on screen, this something happens. And then when youâ¨get the screen test, now you're going to find out without a doubt whether thisâ¨something is there or not. And no matter how good or bad an actor you are,â¨you can't fake that. The camera either likes you or it doesn't, and there'sâ¨nothing you can do about it. And I knew this, and that's what terrified meâ¨about my screen test, because I was going to see--they were going to see up onâ¨the screen whether I had anything. Well, what Cy told me later was--he saidâ¨although the acting was appalling and the nerves were dreadful, he sawâ¨something else and that's why he gave me the part. So that's what I wasâ¨afraid of, that it--if you spend your whole life saying, `Give me the chanceâ¨and I can prove it,' suddenly someone gives you the chance, you suddenly say,â¨`My God, I've got to prove it. I've got to prove it.'â¨â¨GROSS: Yeah.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: And that's where the nerves come in.â¨â¨GROSS: Did you ever see that screen test?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: No. I think they burned it.â¨â¨(Soundbite of laughter)â¨â¨GROSS: Michael Caine recorded in 1992. We'll hear more of the interview inâ¨the second half of the show. Caine is starring in the new movie \"The Quietâ¨American,\" which opened today in about 20 cities. Here's Nat Cole's recordingâ¨of \"Mona Lisa,\" which was used on the soundtrack of Michael Caine's film \"Monaâ¨Lisa.\"â¨â¨I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.â¨â¨(Soundbite of Nat Cole singing \"Mona Lisa\")â¨â¨Mr. NAT COLE: (Singing) Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you. You're soâ¨like the lady with the mystic smile. Is it only 'cause you're lonely theyâ¨have blamed you for that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile? Do you smile toâ¨tempt a lover, Mona Lisa, or is this your way to hide a broken heart? Manyâ¨dreams have been brought to your doorstep. They just lie there and they dieâ¨there.â¨â¨(Announcements)â¨â¨GROSS: Coming up, why he doesn't like to do love scenes. We continue ourâ¨conversation with actor Michael Caine. And David Edelstein reviews the newâ¨film \"How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days.\"â¨â¨(Soundbite of music)â¨â¨GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with more of our interviewâ¨with Michael Caine. He's starring in \"The Quiet American,\" the new filmâ¨adaptation of the 1955 Graham Greene novel. The movie opened today in aboutâ¨20 cities. I spoke with Caine about acting in 1992.â¨â¨How did you pick up everything that you know now about how to look into aâ¨camera or like where to look when the camera's looking at you? Did you pickâ¨that up over years, after watching yourself and watching yourself?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: No, I never watch myself. I never see rushes, and I only see theâ¨finished film once just to see how it turned out and who goofed, including me.â¨And no, it's--film is listening, reaction and behavior. That's what filmâ¨acting is. It shouldn't be called film acting at all because it's not acting.â¨It's something entirely--acting is what you do onstage as far as I'mâ¨concerned. And people behave--the only time real people act is if they'reâ¨showing off or trying to make an impression, like a guy with a girl orâ¨something. Then they act and then they're artificial and we can all seeâ¨they're artificial because they're acting. But normally what you do is youâ¨listen, then you react, and then you behave, and that's all it is.â¨â¨And when people say to me, `Well, what actors did you watch to learn how toâ¨act in movies?' I say, `Well, I didn't. What I watched was documentaries orâ¨people on the subway to see how they react to things,' because you'll seeâ¨actors, like, for instance, making gestures on the phone with no one there.â¨You don't make gestures on the phone with no one there. You think you do, butâ¨you don't. And so you get sort of strange things happening like that when youâ¨see actors acting. So I never took any notice.â¨â¨The only actors that I ever watched for acting lessons were minimalist actorsâ¨like Jean Gaven, the French actor, and someone who was remarkably similar toâ¨him, which was Spencer Tracy. I always think that Jean Gaven and Spencerâ¨Tracy--if you speak French, you'll find they're absolutely indivisible.â¨â¨GROSS: But what about where to look when a camera's looking at you? I mean,â¨you really learned how to work in front of a camera.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yes.â¨â¨GROSS: And if you didn't spend a lot of time watching yourself, how did youâ¨learn that?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Well, I learned by watching where the camera was. I mean, forâ¨instance, you always--the thing is if you're going to play a part--you'reâ¨playing a part with another actor and you look in their eyes, and what you do,â¨if you're acting, you suddenly go, `Well, how do I look into this person'sâ¨eyes?' Now during your lifetime, you've looked into hundreds of people's eyesâ¨every time you speak to someone, but you can't remember how you did it. Andâ¨what you do is you only look into one eye because if you look into two eyes,â¨you'll go cross-eyed. And the one eye you look into is the one that isâ¨nearest the camera because that throws the one eye that you're not usingâ¨straight into the lens.â¨â¨GROSS: Huh.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: That's how you do that.â¨â¨GROSS: How'd you learn that?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: I figured it out. I figured it out, how to do it. I figured itâ¨out myself, actually. I figured out a lot of stuff myself because you get aâ¨feeling in movies when you play someone, the actor should disappear and peopleâ¨should only see the person. I mean, it's a self-defeating thing in a funnyâ¨way because half the time people see me and they say, `Well, he's only playingâ¨himself. It's because I've made the actor disappear. And that's where youâ¨come down to this thing where you've got behavior and where you've got theâ¨camera, you can come down to the absolute minimum thing to do for the cameraâ¨to pick up, and that's what's fascinating about film acting because the cameraâ¨always finds it.â¨â¨GROSS: Now you made 73 films in 30 years.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah.â¨â¨GROSS: And as you say, some people have criticized you for not beingâ¨discriminating enough in the movies that you chose to make.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah.â¨â¨GROSS: What has your criteria been for deciding what to make?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Well, first of all, my criteria was that nobody asked me to makeâ¨anything for 30 years, so my first criteria was that they ask me at all.â¨â¨GROSS: Yeah.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: You know? And I then had to learn how to act in films, so I madeâ¨as many films as possible, as fast as possible, in order to learn how to do itâ¨because I'd never done any. I didn't have any gradual work-up. I wasâ¨suddenly a leading man, and I was fighting for my life, you know, along withâ¨all the other movie stars in the world and I had to give a performance, so Iâ¨did a lot of stuff. And then also my other criteria were--and this is one ofâ¨the great failings of what had the people done before? I remember afterâ¨\"Anatomy of a Murder,\" Otto Preminger asked me to do a picture, and I thought,â¨`Here's this great Hollywood director asking me to do a picture,' which was aâ¨dreadful picture called \"Hurry Sundown.\"â¨â¨But, I mean, I was so complimented that Otto Preminger had even asked me to doâ¨a picture that--I mean, I would have almost done it without reading theâ¨script. I mean, I did read the script; I didn't understand it. But, I mean,â¨I knew that Otto--I didn't even understand Otto Preminger because he had aâ¨thick German accent. But I was just so complimented that this great Hollywoodâ¨director had asked me to do this film, I went and did it, you know. Peopleâ¨always talk as though--first of all, I was never an American star, so I wasâ¨never this person sitting like Paul Newman or someone in a room where everyâ¨new great script that came out came to me first. I was a foreign actor, and Iâ¨was never offered the great American parts because I wasn't a great Americanâ¨actor, you know, I was a British actor. And so what eventually I had to makeâ¨a career out of what all the American stars didn't want, which was usuallyâ¨flawed people.â¨â¨There is another thing with that. If you think in terms of--this stillâ¨happens. Like with British actors, we always get flawed people to play. Theâ¨last three Academy Awards have been British actors--Daniel Day-Lewis, \"My Leftâ¨Foot,\" a flawed person; Jeremy Irons, he played Claus Von Bulow, a man accusedâ¨of murdering his wife, a flawed person; Anthony Hopkins, a cannibal, God knowsâ¨a terribly flawed person. And these are all parts that great American stars,â¨I'm sure, turned down and said, `My audience will not allow me to do this.'â¨â¨GROSS: Well, let's look at the...â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: And they quite rightfully did so. And so we are--the actors thatâ¨I've mentioned, we are stars by default in America in a funny way.â¨â¨GROSS: You got your Academy Award for \"Hannah and Her Sisters,\" playingâ¨somebody married to a character played by Mia Farrow, but you're having anâ¨affair with your wife's sister--a flawed person, I guess.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Again, always flawed. I mean, I've played a transvestiteâ¨psychopathic killer...â¨â¨GROSS: In \"Dressed to Kill.\"â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: \"Dressed to Kill.\" I've played two homosexuals. I've played allâ¨sorts of weird characters. I mean, I can't see Clint Eastwood doing \"Dressedâ¨to Kill,\" dressed as a woman going around killing people. I did it, you know,â¨and I'm just as tall as he is.â¨â¨GROSS: You know, it's interesting to me, early in your career Alfredâ¨Hitchcock offered you a role as a sadistic killer in \"Frenzy.\"â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: That's right, yeah.â¨â¨GROSS: But you turned that down.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah.â¨â¨GROSS: So, I mean, here you are talking about flawed people, but you didn'tâ¨want to play that role because why?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Because I knew who he was based on. He was based on Nevilleâ¨Heath, who was an extraordinarily--early, extraordinarily sadistic Britishâ¨woman killer, and I wouldn't play it, I mean, all those years ago. Hitchcockâ¨never spoke to me again.â¨â¨GROSS: Because you turned him down?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah. You never--I knew him quite well because he comes from theâ¨same part of London as I do, and I knew him quite well. I mean, I wasn't aâ¨close friend or anything. I'd never been to his home, but I'd always sort ofâ¨saw him around Universal and restaurants. But I remember I had lunch with himâ¨for that film, and I said to him, I said, `There's something I've got to bringâ¨up with you.' I said, `You said that actors were cattle, andâ¨(unintelligible).' `No, I didn't,' he said. `I said actors should be treatedâ¨like cattle.'â¨â¨So there's another voice, and that's a sort of halfway--trying to be terriblyâ¨middle-class, and that's a cockney trying to get it right.â¨â¨GROSS: And speaking very slowly, too.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah, well, Hitchcock was a terribly powerful person, so everybodyâ¨listened and waited for him to say anything he liked, except for me. I said,â¨`I don't want to do the part,' and he never spoke to me again.â¨â¨GROSS: My guest is Michael Caine. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.â¨â¨(Soundbite of music)â¨â¨GROSS: Let's get back to our 1992 interview with actor Michael Caine.â¨â¨Since you've given so much thought to the placement of the camera and theâ¨difference between theater and film and so on, I want to ask you about doingâ¨love scenes in front of the camera. You don't like doing love scenes veryâ¨much; that's certainly the impression I get from your book.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: No, because, you see, for a start, if you're a very good actor,â¨you see, and you play a scene--I will play a murderer, you know, and my wifeâ¨will see the picture and she'll say, `I thought that was brilliant, you know.â¨I mean, you were so convincing as a murderer,' right? So I'm a very goodâ¨actor and I played a very good part as a murderer and my wife thinks it's veryâ¨convincing and it's fabulous, and she's very pleased with me and I'm a veryâ¨good actor. If I put the same amount of sincerity and skill and dexterityâ¨into a love scene, she says, `Was there anything going on between you two?'â¨â¨GROSS: Right.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: You see? So you can't win. You can't win, because if you do itâ¨for real, if you're really a good actor, you really look as though you lovedâ¨the woman, you know? And it's very difficult for someone else who loves youâ¨to watch that. So I don't like doing them. And also, love scenes often,â¨obviously, involve a lot of kissing and cuddling and sometimes nudity and allâ¨that, and I hate it all. It sort of gets in the way of everything. And allâ¨the big stars in the old days, they never did any of these scruffy love scenesâ¨and rolling about. And if the girl has to take their clothes off, then it'sâ¨nervous breakdowns and things going on, and it's not worth it. I couldn't doâ¨a nude scene. I've never been able to do it. I mean, I've looked as though Iâ¨was nude, but I never take my shorts off. I always keep my shorts on.â¨â¨GROSS: Have you turned down movies because you didn't want to do a nudeâ¨scene?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah. I turned down--what was the movie Ken Russell directedâ¨where Oliver Reed and Alan Bates wrestled...â¨â¨GROSS: \"Women in Love.\"â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: \"Woman in Love,\" yeah. I turned down that.â¨â¨GROSS: Because of the nude wrestling scene?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Well, for a start, I turned down the thing because I won't appearâ¨stark naked in anything, you know? And the other thing, I couldn't imagineâ¨wrestling a naked guy, you know? I thought, `So supposing I like this? I'llâ¨be in trouble.' It's like...â¨â¨GROSS: Sounds like your father's influence coming back again.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: It's--sure, it's just my father. I said, `My dad will beâ¨spinning in his grave if I'm rolling around on the ground with Alan Bates withâ¨no clothes on.'â¨â¨GROSS: Did...â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: I thought, `To hell with it.'â¨â¨GROSS: Did...â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: And that's why I turned the picture down.â¨â¨GROSS: Do you think your father's fear of homosexuality stuck with you?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: No. I don't have any fear of homosexuality. But he didn't haveâ¨a fear of homosexuality. He had a fear of me being a homosexual. Heâ¨was--there was no chance of him being one. He wasn't worried about himself.â¨He was worried about me. And I'm not worried about me, but, you know, it wasâ¨just a done thing in those days, you know? There was tremendous homophobiaâ¨then.â¨â¨GROSS: You know, it strikes me you are a very close observer of otherâ¨people's behavior, but doing a love scene, you'd be at something of aâ¨disadvantage because it's not like you've sat around watching a lot of couplesâ¨make love. Do you know what I mean?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah.â¨â¨GROSS: You could say, `Well, this kind of person makes love this way, andâ¨that kind of man makes love that way.'â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah.â¨â¨GROSS: So you must have to use your imagination more to imagine yourâ¨character in a romantic situation...â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Oh, yeah. Sure.â¨â¨GROSS: ...as to imagine them on the telephone, which you've been able toâ¨witness...â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah.â¨â¨GROSS: ...or imagine them at dinner, which you've been able to witness.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah. I--yes, with the love scenes. But I've been imaginingâ¨love scenes since I was 10, all sorts of different ones, so I've got one forâ¨every occasion. Whatever. I mean, I was always--I was very sort of oversexedâ¨when I was a little boy, and I saw love scenes on the screen, you know, whichâ¨were kissing. But it was very soon--found out what happened when they cut toâ¨the seagull or the train going through the tunnel. I figured out theâ¨significance of that very quickly. And, of course, right through my teens, Iâ¨had all these imaginary love scenes worked out and I managed to get them allâ¨out of my system on- and off-screen over the years.â¨â¨GROSS: You've described yourself as a very un-neurotic person. Do you thinkâ¨that that's affected your approach to acting?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah. I have a very un-neurotic approach to acting. Basically,â¨it's--my style of acting is like--most actors would hold up a picture and say,â¨`Look at me.' I get rid of all that baggage by holding up a mirror andâ¨saying, `Look at you.' So what I'm doing is I'm playing you, not me, and soâ¨therefore, I can watch from afar, and I watch for the neuroses or the behaviorâ¨in people that I can reflect off my mirror.â¨â¨GROSS: You still do that now?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah. All the time. All the time. My--if I've been a successâ¨and you see a performance, even if you're a woman, you should say, `How doesâ¨he know that about me? How does he know I would have done that there? Whyâ¨would--how does he know that's the way I would have reacted?' It's gotâ¨nothing to do with the sexes or anything. It's just has--it's human behaviorâ¨is remarkably similar.â¨â¨GROSS: One more thing, and this gets back to eyes. You know how you've saidâ¨the eyes are the most important part of an actor?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah.â¨â¨GROSS: You were born with an eye problem called ablepharia...â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yes.â¨â¨GROSS: ...which puffs the eyelids?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yes.â¨â¨GROSS: So did that make you self-conscious about your eyes? Did it make itâ¨any more difficult for you?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah. At school, they used to call me snake-eyes because I sortâ¨of have eyes like a cobra. But when I grew up--sometimes if you're veryâ¨sleepy, you look like a cod. They used to call me cod's-eyes as well until Iâ¨sort of grew to six feet tall, then nobody called me cod's-eyes, you know.â¨But when I got into the movies, it came out as kind of dreamy and sexy, youâ¨know? Sleepy-looking. So they could use make-up on them and sort of makeâ¨them look slightly different. They put a bit of shade, which puts the eyesâ¨back further into your head, and you get a sort of dreamy quality. So thereâ¨was a producer once, an old theater producer who said, `Use the disadvantage.â¨Always use the disadvantage.' And so I used that. A lot of things worked forâ¨me like that in my life.â¨â¨GROSS: What else?â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Well, I was just thinking, when he said, `Use the disadvantage,'â¨what that means is I was rehearsing--`Use the difficulty,' I mean. `Use theâ¨difficulty,' he used to say. I was rehearsing a play, and there was a sceneâ¨went on before me, and then I had to come in the door, and they'd rehearsedâ¨the scene and one of the actors had thrown a chair at the other one, and itâ¨had gone right in front of the door where I came in. So I opened the door andâ¨then rather lamely, I said to the producer who was sitting out in the stalls,â¨I said, `Well, look, I can't get in, there's a chair in my way.' So he said,â¨`Well, use the difficulty.' So I said, `Well, what do you mean? Use theâ¨difficulty?' He said, `Well, if it's a drama, pick it up and smash it. Ifâ¨it's a comedy, fall over it,' which was a line for me for life, you know?â¨Always try and use the difficulty.â¨â¨GROSS: Oh, that's great.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Yeah.â¨â¨GROSS: On that note, I want to thank you so much for talking with us.â¨â¨Mr. CAINE: Thank you.â¨â¨GROSS: Michael Caine, recorded in 1992. He's starring in the new film, \"Theâ¨Quiet American.\" It opened today in about 20 cities. Caine first becameâ¨known for his film \"Alfie.\" He's the song \"Alfie,\" written for the film byâ¨Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Dionne Warwick had the American hit, but itâ¨was first recorded in England by Cilla Black. Here's Black's version.â¨â¨(Soundbite of \"Alfie\")â¨â¨Ms. CILLA BLACK: (Singing) What's it all about, Alfie? Is it just for theâ¨moment we live? What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie? Are weâ¨meant to take all that we give, or are we meant to be kind?â¨â¨And if only fools are kind, Alfie, then I guess it is wise to be cruel. Andâ¨if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie, what will you lend on an old goldenâ¨rule? As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie, I know there'sâ¨something much more, something even non-believers can believe in.â¨â¨I believe in love, Alfie. Without true love, we just exist, Alfie. Until youâ¨find the love you've missed, you're nothing, Alfie. When you walk, let yourâ¨heart lead the way, and you'll find love any day, Alfie.â¨â¨GROSS: Coming up, film critic David Edelstein reviews \"How to Lose a Guy inâ¨10 Days.\" This is FRESH AIR.â¨â¨(Soundbite of music)â¨â¨* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *â¨â¨Analysis: \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\" misses capitalizing onâ¨great premiseâ¨TERRY GROSS, host:â¨â¨The new romantic comedy \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\" stars Kate Hudson as aâ¨magazine columnist and Matthew McConaughey as the subject of her latestâ¨experiment in dating. The producer is Linda Obst, who gave us \"Sleepless inâ¨Seattle.\" Film critic David Edelstein has a review.â¨â¨DAVID EDELSTEIN reporting:â¨â¨I loved the premise of \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.\" It's both \"Sex and theâ¨City\"-modern and Doris Day old-fashioned. It's totally implausible, and yet,â¨it gets at something real, the way that having to play roles during courtshipâ¨can be a recipe for insanity. It begins with Michelle, played by Kathrynâ¨Hahn, getting dropped by a guy she slept with and said `I love you' to inâ¨their first week of dating. After that, he won't pick up the phone. Michelleâ¨works at a high-end fashion magazine, where her boss, played by Bebe Neuwirth,â¨as a demonic synthesis of Anna Wintour and Helen Gurley Brown, wants her toâ¨write about the breakup. The person who comes to her rescue is her bestâ¨friend, Andie Anderson, played by star Kate Hudson. Andie is the magazine'sâ¨quirky how-to columnist, and this time, she announces, she'll write aâ¨how-not-to. She'll pick up a guy and intentionally do everything wrong.â¨â¨Here are Andie and Michelle and another friend, Jeannie, all done up and onâ¨their way to a hot party.â¨â¨(Soundbite of \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\")â¨â¨Ms. KATHRYN HAHN: (As Michelle) You're never going to pull this off.â¨â¨Ms. KATE HUDSON: (As Andie Anderson) Watch me. Tonight, I'll hook a guy;â¨tomorrow, pull the switch. Before the 10 days are up, I'm going to have thisâ¨guy running for his life.â¨â¨Ms. ANNIE PARISSE: (As Jeannie) You're not going to burn his apartment downâ¨or bite him or anything, are you?â¨â¨Ms. HUDSON: No. I'm going to limit myself to doing everything girls doâ¨wrong in relationships; basically, everything we know guys hate. I'll beâ¨clingy, needy...â¨â¨Ms. HAHN: Be touchy-feely.â¨â¨Ms. HUDSON: Yeah.â¨â¨Ms. PARISSE: Ooh, call him in the middle of the night and tell him everythingâ¨you had to eat that day.â¨â¨Ms. HAHN: What's wrong with that?â¨â¨EDELSTEIN: That last little peep came from Michelle. You can guess why theâ¨guy hightailed it. What Andie doesn't know is that the hunk she ends up with,â¨Benjamin Barry, played by Matthew McConaughey, has an ulterior motive, too.â¨He's a beer-and-sneakers advertising guy who wants to land a big diamondâ¨account, and he takes a bet from his boss to prove he does, too, understandâ¨what women want. Why, he can make a woman fall in love with him in, youâ¨guessed it, 10 days.â¨â¨I know this sounds laborious and vaguely idiotic, but think about it: Youâ¨have a woman striving to be clingy and invasive and a man striving to put upâ¨with it. Neither is emotionally honest and neither behaves the way the otherâ¨expects. Benjamin just won't drop Andie, even when she calls him Bennie-Booâ¨and buys him a yappy little dog and drapes pink doilies over everything andâ¨fills his medicine cabinet with feminine hygiene products and leaves 16â¨messages on his answering machine in about 15 minutes and, oh, yes, nicknamesâ¨his penis.â¨â¨Classic screwball comedies have come from much less. As I said, I love theâ¨premise. The movie, it's OK. It's a great vehicle for Kate Hudson. It'sâ¨practically sewn onto her, like that knockout yellow Dior gown she wears inâ¨the posters, and if a schlub like me wants to know who the designer is, that'sâ¨some dress.â¨â¨Kate Hudson was wonderful as a groupie in \"Almost Famous,\" but she wasâ¨idealized and a little soft. She didn't seem quite broken in by life. Butâ¨this time, she gets to show some comic spunk. She does dingey blonde shtickâ¨like her mom, Goldie Hawn, but in quotation marks. She does it, and she sendsâ¨it up, too. Her wiggly sweetness matches well with McConaughey's slightlyâ¨wooden earnestness. They're cute together.â¨â¨But the movie gets hobbled out of the starting gate because Andie doesn't goâ¨to bed with Benjamin right away, and so the experiment doesn't have theâ¨naughty zing you've been primed to expect, and guys put up with anythingâ¨before sex. The filmmakers must have been afraid of losing their mainstreamâ¨audience if they made their heroine deceitful and promiscuous. Heavens! Andâ¨the director, Donald Petrie, has said in interviews that he objected to theâ¨first script he read in which the couple did go to bed on their first date, onâ¨the grounds it sent the wrong message to his 12-year-old daughter. Now whenâ¨you set out to make a sex comedy for your 12-year-old daughter, well, ifâ¨you're any kind of dad, it probably won't be very exciting. I bet Petrie is aâ¨great dad.â¨â¨So from moment to moment, the movie is perky and sexless and false, like aâ¨Nora Ephron comedy, but with much worse timing. And the music, by Davidâ¨Newman, is relentlessly cutesy-poo. It's fun and it will probably be a bigâ¨hit, but it's also a waste of a killer set-up. That's what happens when youâ¨make a movie called \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\" while you live in terror ofâ¨losing your audience.â¨â¨GROSS: David Edelstein is film critic for the online magazine Slate.â¨â¨(Credits)â¨â¨GROSS: I'm Terry Gross.â¨â¨We'll close with a recording by Mongo Santamaria, the Cuban conga player andâ¨percussionist.
