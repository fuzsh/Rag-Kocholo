        "text": "Caine as Charlie Croker| Caine Mini Biography| Filmography | Events & Awards\n\nMy Name is Michael Caine...\n\nMaurice Joseph Micklewhite Jr was born on the 14th March 1933 in Bermondsey, London. He was to become one of Britain's most successful and respected actors, but it wasn't going to be easy.\n\n\"I was named after my father and I was knighted in his name because I love my father\"\n\nCaine's father was a was fish-market porter and his mother a charlady. He left school at fifteen and took his first job as a meat porter. He had various working-class jobs before serving with the British Army in Korea, where he experienced combat.\n\nBattle hardened...\n\nReturning to England battle hardened and determined to create a better life for himself he threw his energy towards the theatre and managed to get a job as an assistant stage manager. He could not afford to attend stage school, but battled on with his ambition to be an actor.\n\nProud of his humble roots, he hung on to his working class accent at a time when, as an actor, it was considered both unfashionable and unwise And he has never shied away from taking on a B-list movie role and he has never shied away from taking on a B-list movie role.\n\nHe adopted the name of Caine on the advice of his agent, taking it from a \"Caine Mutiny\" marquee.\n\nIn the following years, he worked on more than 100 television dramas, with theatrical companies throughout the UK and eventually in \"The Long and the Short and the Tail,\" as Peter O'Toole's understudy, which was a stage hit.\n\nBy now Caine was on the right tracks...\n\nIt was the 1964 hit film \"Zulu\" that eventually brought international attention to Caine. He could of quite easily played a lowly Cockney soldier, but he played an articulate, aristocratic officer, something which had a major influence on his perceived acting ability. By now Caine was on the right tracks, bringing a fresh breath of wind to British cinema. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-sixties England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent - his next role couldn't have been more perfect.\n\nStarring in \"Alfie\" made Caine a household name and he was having script after script thrown at him. His carefully selected roles in films like 'Get Carter' and 'The Italian Job' were just as central to the swinging sixties as The Beatles, the mini skirt, the mini and E-Type Jags.\n\nGet Carter\n\nZulu\n\nAlfie\n\nThe Cider House Rules\n\n'Indeed, television re-runs of classic films like The Italian Job and Get Carter - both classic British movies - have elevated Caine to near icon status'"
