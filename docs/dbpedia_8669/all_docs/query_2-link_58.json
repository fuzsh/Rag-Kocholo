        "text": "Sir Michael Caine will reportedly come out of retirement in order to star in a new Netflix series. The 90-year-old actor announced his retirement in October following the release of his latest film, The Great Escaper.\n\nHowever, reports suggest the legendary actor has joined a show on the streaming platform. The Sun claimed an insider had confirmed: \"He’s been asked to star in a Netflix series. Details are kept closely guarded.\"\n\nExpress.co.uk has contacted representatives for the actor as well as Netflix over the claims. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme in October, Michael announced: \"I keep saying I'm going to retire. Well, I am now.\"\n\nThe award-winning star's career spans seven decades and he has appeared in more than 160 films. His latest role saw him depicting Bernie Jordan, a real-life World War II veteran.\n\nJordan made national headlines in 2014 when he escaped from his care home and travelled to France to mark D-Day. Speaking to the BBC, Sir Michael joked his age was another reason behind his decision to retire.\n\nHe told the broadcaster: \"The only parts I'm liable to get now are 90-year-old men. Or maybe 85.\n\n\"They're not going to be the lead. You don't have leading men at 90, you're going to have young handsome boys and girls.\n\n\"So I thought, I might as well leave with all this.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph, the actor addressed the possibility of his seven-decade-long career coming to an end.\n\nMichael revealed he is \"sort of\" retired already due to his age and not being able to \"walk properly\".\n\nReflecting on his 90 years, he added: \"I’ve had the best possible life I could have thought of. The best possible wife, and the best possible family.\n\n\"They may not be a family that other people would say is the best possible family – but the best possible family for me.\""
