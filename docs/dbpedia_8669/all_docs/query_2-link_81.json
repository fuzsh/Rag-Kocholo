        "text": "MICHAEL CAINE'S cockney accent has become so much a part of his public persona that it always comes as something of a surprise to find him in a movie using a different one. And yet actors are always ''doing'' accents, and Mr. Caine has done his share. Indeed, in his most recent movie, ''The Cider House Rules,'' this Londoner sounds -- and looks -- convincing enough as a New England orphanage director to have won an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor.\n\nYet there is something about the English that turns accents into social, even political, statements. Thus, when Mr. Caine entered the theater in the late 1950's, he could have easily disguised his working-class background by adopting a more rounded stage voice. Instead, he held onto his cockney vowels as a way of rebelling against a class system from which, in the end, he could not escape. He earned his first Oscar nomination for playing a cockney lecher in the 1966 movie ''Alfie,'' but in England he was labeled as a cockney actor.\n\nAll of which explains why he so enjoys working in the United States.\n\n''When I left to work in America for the first time 30 years ago, no one talked about my accent or my class or anything,'' he recalled over lunch near his Chelsea home. ''It was, 'Can he act?' No? Then fling him out.' It was really liberating for me. In England, I was a cockney actor. In America, I was an actor.''\n\nSo much so that he went on to make dozens of films in the United States, some memorable, many less so, and to become a familiar face on late-night talk shows. With the British movie industry stagnating in the late 1970's he even moved to Los Angeles, where he lived for eight years until homesickness got the better of him. But he remains one of only a handful of European actors who clearly feel at home in the United States.\n\nStill, when he was asked to play the role of Dr. Wilbur Larch in ''The Cider House Rules,'' Lasse Hallstrom's movie version of John Irving's best-selling novel, Mr. Caine's main concern was to get the accent right. And he worked with a dialogue coach for two weeks before he was persuaded he could do it. What reassured him was that, for Mr. Hallstrom, Mr. Irving and the movie's producer, Richard N. Goldstein, his accent was not an issue.\n\n''Forget the accent,'' he said. ''What they wanted was a performance as good as any American actor could have done. And to play an American doctor in 1943 was about as far away from me as I had ever gone, so it was very interesting to do. A lot of other actors could have played it better, but I could not have played it any better, which gives me a tremendous sense of satisfaction.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
