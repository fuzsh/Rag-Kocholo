        "text": "LONDON — Michael Caine has been looking back, and on the whole he likes the view. Regrets? He’s had few.\n\nThe 85-year-old star of “Alfie,” “Get Carter” and “The Dark Knight” — among many, many others — reminisces fondly in “Blowing the Bloody Doors Off,” whose title adapts a line from his 1969 heist caper “The Italian Job.” Just published in the United States by Hachette, it’s part memoir, part advice manual for aspiring actors and anyone else nursing an elusive dream of success.\n\nMost of the advice is resolutely old-fashioned. Learn your lines. Work hard. Be nice to people. And be lucky. Caine knows he has been extremely fortunate.\n\n“The luck I’ve had, you couldn’t make it up,” Caine said during an interview in his riverside London apartment.\n\nIn print and in person, Caine describes his success as a sequence of lucky breaks. His first big movie break, as a British army officer in “Zulu” in 1964, was followed by a role as a world-weary spy in “The Ipcress File.” On the back of that came his breakthrough as a callous man-about-town in “Alfie.” That film made blond, bespectacled Caine a symbol of Swinging London, brought him American fame and earned him the first of six Academy Award nominations.\n\nHe went on to win two Oscars — for “Hannah and Her Sisters” and “The Cider House Rules.” Later came a stint as butler and mentor Alfred in three Batman movies directed by Christopher Nolan. Along the way, he became an icon.\n\nCaine says his optimistic outlook is rooted in his hardscrabble early years. Born Maurice Micklewhite into a working-class London family, he was a child during the London Blitz and later, as a teenage conscript, was sent to fight in the Korean War.\n\n“I have found it pretty easy to be happy since then,” he notes in the book. “Once you’ve been on maneuvers in Korea, everything else seems like quite a lot of fun.”\n\nWhen he returned to London and a dead-end job in a butter factory, Caine resolved to be an actor, although he had little idea how to go about it.\n\n“I was nobody from nowhere who knew nothing about anything,” he said. His drive to succeed came from “desperation — the determination to become something other than a factory worker.\n\nAnswering a classified ad led to small parts in a provincial repertory company. Then came work on the London stage, television parts, movie roles and global stardom. If he has a secret, he says, it’s that he kept going when others gave up.\n\n“If someone rejected me, I never worried about it,” he said. “I tried again, because my only alternative was working back in the butter factory.\n\nCaine enjoyed fame, when it came, but also worked extremely hard, at one point making 12 films in four years.\n\nThe result is a resume of more than 100 features, of varying quality. Caine is cheerful about the low points, films like schlocky shark sequel “Jaws: The Revenge” or “The Swarm,” a disaster movie in both senses of the word in which Caine and his co-stars learned another lesson: Never work with bees.\n\nWhen leading-man parts dried up, Caine retired — briefly. The last two decades have brought some of the most rewarding parts of his career, including his six films with Nolan, whom Caine calls “a brilliant director … the new David Lean.”\n\nThese days, Caine is contentedly unretired, balancing work and time with his family: Shakira, his wife of 45 years; his two daughters; and his three grandchildren, ages 9 and 10, with whom he is “besotted.”\n\n“I have such great times with them,” Caine said. “What astonishes me, the things they know. It’s like talking to a 20-year-old.”\n\nOf his recent films, he’s proudest of Italian director Paolo Sorrentino’s “Youth,” in which he played an aging orchestra conductor.\n\n“I don’t play the leads in movies now — I’m too bloody old to be getting up every morning at half past six,” he said. “I just take little character parts and have a bit of fun.\n\n“You don’t give up movies — they give up you. And while I get these parts, I’ll keep doing them.”"
