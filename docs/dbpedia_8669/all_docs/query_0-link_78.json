        "text": "Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nLegendary British actor, Michael Caine, has formally announced his retirement from acting.\n\nHe made the announcement on BBC Radio 4‘s ‘Best of Today‘ podcast. The actor now 90 years old, has repeatedly announced his intention to retire, but asserts this time is for real.\n\nThe star of ‘Zulu‘, ‘A Bridge Too Far‘ and ‘Harry Brown‘, Caine has one more movie coming out, ‘The Great Escaper‘. In this his final film, Caine plays a real-life World War II veteran, Bernard Jordan, who famously walked out of his nursing home in England at age 89 to visit Normandy one last time, on the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nCaine told the BBC, “I’ve played the lead and it’s got incredible reviews. The only parts I’m going to get now are old men—90-year-old men, or maybe 85, you know—and I thought, well, I might as well leave with all this. I’ve got wonderful reviews. What am I going to do to beat this?”\n\nNearly 70-year acting career\n\nWith a career spanning nearly 70 years. Caine, born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite Jr., served in the British Army during the Korean War and has publicly shared some of his experiences fighting the Chinese in the hills of North and South Korea.\n\nHe’s been on stage and screen since leaving the army in the 1950s, and landed his first movie role in 1956.\n\nThe 1964 film ‘Zulu‘ was a major success, both critically and at the box office, but it was Caine’s role in the 1966 film ‘Alfie‘ that propelled him to stardom. He spent the next few decades playing spies, soldiers and playboys before receiving his first Academy Award for the 1986 movie ‘Hannah and Her Sisters‘.\n\nCaine won a second Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for 1999’s ‘The Cider House Rules‘. He has made 160 movies, was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1993 and was knighted in 2000. His creative career may not be over entirely, however.\n\nHe also told the BBC that he has always wanted to be a writer, and he has a book coming out at the end of 2023, ‘Deadly Game‘, which is about a Special Air Service veteran turned detective working in London’s Metropolitan Police force. The thriller is his first fiction book after writing a number of memoirs and nonfiction books on acting."
