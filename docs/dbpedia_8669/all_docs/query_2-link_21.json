        "text": "Actor and author Michael Caine has a house on the market about an hour's train ride from London just outside a town called Leatherhead, which almost sounds like a movie he could have starred in. But, no, it is a quiet English village setting where you'll find his eight-acre property, asking £3.75 million (about $5 million), with a main house, two cottages, an athletic center with indoor pool and many acres of landscaped gardens. Located down a private lane with a total combined living space of over 12,000 square feet, the property could be a place for several generations to live side by side.\n\nLeatherhead itself is in the Surrey Hills region, known for its appeal to holiday goers who want to take in a few hikes across the majestic scenery. Properties around Leatherhead typically start just under a million pounds ($1.5 million) for single-family detached houses. This is currently the priciest home for sale in the town or surrounding area. The next one down on the price list is a £2.2 million ($3 million) four-bedroom house on three-quarters of an acre.\n\nThe entire package could be straight of central casting for British homes. Original wood beams adorn some of the ceilings in the main house, numerous dormer windows look out over the lush green gardens, many of the draperies and other decor have a floral motif (so British!) and the clapboard exterior still give it a cottage feel even though it is quite large. Above is a look at the main living room in the house.\n\nThere isn't a photo of the kitchen, but this appears to be the eating area of what would be an eat-in kitchen. Several sets of double doors open out to the patio and the floor-to-ceiling windows and skylights help bring in abundant natural light.\n\nThere's a media room with drop down screen that connects to the indoor pool building.\n\nHere's the indoor pool in its own building dedicated to athletic use. Besides the pool there is a hot tub, gym, bathroom/dressing room and studio.\n\nThere's a greenhouse and potting shed to help take care of all the greenery.\n\nHere's a look at the main building.\n\nHere's an overhead view of the nearly eight acres of land and its landscaped.\n\nThe property is co-listed with Strutt & Parker and Grosvenor Billinghurst. Reps for the agent declined to comment. Here is the listing page for more information."
