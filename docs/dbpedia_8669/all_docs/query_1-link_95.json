        "text": "Despite his pronouncements at last week's Bafta ceremony on the innate snobbery of the British film industry (see our news story, double Oscar-winning actor Michael Caine could be set to receive the ultimate establishment seal of approval.\n\nOn accepting his fellowship of the academy award, the 67-year-old actor caused a controversy by telling the audience he had \"never really felt I belonged in my own country, in my own profession.\"\n\nQuoting government sources, Saturday's Sun newspaper said the actor was to be knighted in the Queen birthday honours list in June, on the personal recommendation of Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nCaine, born Maurice Micklewhite in east London, has appeared in more than 80 films, and is also a celebrated restaurateur with five eateries in London and one in Miami.\n\nHe has been nominated for an Academy Award five times, winning twice as best supporting actor, for the Woody Allen's 1986 Hannah and her Sisters and, last month, for Cider House Rules.\n\nThe Queen's Honours are bestowed twice a year, on New Year's Day and to mark her official birthday in June."
