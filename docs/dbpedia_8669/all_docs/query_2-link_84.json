        "text": "British actor Sir Michael Caine has confirmed he has retired from acting after the release of his latest film.\n\nThe Oscar, Golden Globe and Bafta-winning actor has made the announcement after appearing in more than 160 films over his seven-decade career.\n\nHis final film, The Great Escaper, which was released on 6 October, sees Sir Michael star alongside Glenda Jackson, who died in June after the completion of the film.\n\nHe plays real-life Second World War veteran Bernie Jordan, who escaped from a care home to attend D-Day celebrations in France.\n\n\"I keep saying I'm going to retire. Well, I am now,\" Sir Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"I've figured, I've had a picture where I've played the lead and had incredible reviews... what am I going to do that will beat this?\"\n\n\"The only parts I'm liable to get now are 90-year-old men. Or maybe 85.\n\n\"They're not going to be the lead. You don't have leading men at 90, you're going to have young handsome boys and girls. So, I thought, I might as well leave with all this.\"\n\nThe veteran actor initially said he was close to giving up acting in 2021, having just appeared in the film Best Sellers alongside Aubrey Plaza.\n\nRead more:\n\nNobel prize-winning poet Louise Gluck dies\n\nSteve McQueen says new film is 'a call to arms'\n\nHe told film critic Mark Kermode that he expected Best Sellers to be his last film because he had a spine problem which was affecting his walking and \"there haven't been any offers for two years\".\n\nWhile he stopped short of formally retiring, he has since revealed that he turned down The Great Escaper three times before eventually accepting the role.\n\nSir Michael's announcement comes a month before the release of his debut novel, Deadly Game.\n\nSubscribe to the Backstage podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\n\nThe 90-year-old said in June: \"It's been my ambition for years to write a thriller. It's the genre I most love to read and I've really got a buzz out of working on Deadly Game and teaming up with Hodder once again to publish it.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\"I hope readers enjoy getting to know Harry Taylor as much as I did.\"\n\nThe novel follows the adventures of DCI Harry Taylor, a detective \"with no respect for red tape or political reputations\"."
