        "text": "The actor Michael Caine named as his favourite ever “Londoner”\n\nLondon has spit out countless cultural icons spanning every art form. From Amy Winehouse to Alex Garland, the capital city has always been lucrative in its production of talented singers, directors, painters, writers and more. The world of acting is no exception – London has spawned some of the most well-loved and well-respected names within the medium, but perhaps its most iconic acting export is Michael Caine.\n\nBorn in South London, the beloved British actor has carried the influence of his hometown with him throughout his career. In fact, it forms a major part of his distinctive acting style. Whether he’s playing suave spy Harry Palmer or Batman’s confidante Alfred Pennyworth, his characteristic Cockney accent always shines through and has become his most identifiable attribute.\n\nThis, alongside a filmography filled to the brim with classics, has secured Caine’s place as one of the most recognisable Londoners in popular culture. There are few actors from the capital city with lengthier or more lucrative careers than Caine’s. Between a beloved starring role in The Italian Job and a more recent string of collaborations with Christopher Nolan, he has endeared himself to generations of cinema-goers.\n\nGiven the scope of his career and its intrinsic connection to the British capital city, it’s likely that many movie fans would pick Caine out as their favourite London-born actor, if not their favourite Londoner altogether. The Get Carter star was even afforded the title of “London’s favourite Londoner” in 2008, winning the votes of his fellow capital city-dwellers.\n\nCaine may have been certified as one of the city’s favourite Londoners, but he has his own pick for the honour. The city has no shortage of worthy contenders – from recent stars like John Boyega and Phoebe Waller-Bridge to slightly more established names like Alan Rickman and Laurence Olivier. But Caine preferred to look slightly further back for his choice.\n\nAs he divulged during a conversation with The Guardian, Caine would be more than willing to hand his title off to his acting predecessor, Charlie Chaplin. “For me,” he stated, “the greatest will always be Charlie Chaplin.”\n\nTaking his first steps into the world of cinema while it was still in its infancy, Chaplin was not only one of the most iconic film stars of all time, but one of the first. After appearing in shorts for several years, he starred in and directed his first feature in 1921, not even two decades into the existence of the medium.\n\nFrom there, the London-born actor would begin to forge a reputation as one of the most recognisable names in cinema history. Between 1925’s The Gold Rush and his 1936 magnum opus Modern Times, Chaplin forged a legacy that would last for over a century. Even today, he still remains one of the biggest actors of all time.\n\nConsidering the scope of Caine’s own career, it makes sense that his favourite Londoner has a similar magnitude within the world of acting. Before Caine was even born, Chaplin was already forging future classics and securing a place in cinematic history. They’re two of the most well-known actors to come out of the city.\n\nRevisit Caine’s iconic Cockney acting in The Italian Job below to see why he’s London’s favourite Londoner."
