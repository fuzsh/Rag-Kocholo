        "text": "CIVIL STATUS\n\nProfessions Actor, Producer, Performer (songs from the film) more\n\nBirth Name Maurice Joseph Micklewhite Jr\n\nNationality British\n\nBorn 14 March 1933 (London, England – United Kingdom)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nBorn into a poor family in South London, little Maurice Micklewhite developed a passion for theatre at an early age. At the age of 18, he was drafted into the British forces and sent to Korea. On his return, he worked a few odd jobs (errand boy, prop man, etc.) and played in regional theatres. He also took part in numerous television plays and quickly adopted a stage name, in reference to his favorite film, Hurricane on the Caine (1954) by Edward Dmytryk.\n\nHe made his film debut in 1956 in Julian Amyes’ Commando in Korea. After fifteen appearances, he finally found himself at the top of the bill with Cy Endfield’s Zulu (1964). But it was the following year that he was consecrated for Ipcress, Immediate Danger (1965), a spy film in which he played Harry Palmer, a secret agent who was the opposite of James Bond. He will reprise this role in My Funeral in Berlin and A Billion Dollar Brain. At the same time, the actor definitively established his notoriety with Alfie, the flirt, a performance as a seducer for which he received an Oscar nomination, then with Otto Preminger’s Let the Night Come, alongside Jane Fonda.\n\nFrom the 70s onwards, Caine toured more in the United States without becoming a big Hollywood star. An English soldier fighting in the New Hebrides during the Second World War in Too Late for Heroes (1970), he is a gangster demanding revenge in The Law of the Middle (1971), a hairdresser trapped by his mistress’s husband in The Bloodhound (1972) and a treasure hunter in The Man Who Wanted to Be King (1975). Over the next decade, Michael Caine continued to tour at a breakneck pace. Among his notable performances are those of a psychiatrist in Impulses (1980), an ill-intentioned playwright in Death Trap (1982) and a football coach in a German prison camp in John Huston’s Own Victory (1981).\n\nMichael Caine came close to winning an Oscar for Rita’s Education in 1984 and won the famous statuette in 1987 when he co-starred with Mia Farrow in Woody Allen’s Hannah and Her Sisters. Capable of self-deprecation, he was also at ease in comedy, with films such as It’s Your Fault in Rio (1984), The Most Crooked of the Two (1988) and Elementary, My Dear One. Lock Holmes in the same year, in which he played a rather unusual Sherlock Holmes. In 1995, he made two films in quick succession in which he reprised the role of Harry Palmer: Bullet to Beijing by Georges Mihalka and Midnight in St Petersburg by Douglas Jackson.\n\nHe then starred alongside Jack Nicholson in Blood and Wine (1996), Ewan McGregor in Little Voice (1998) and Geoffrey Rush in Quills (2000). That same year, he won a second Oscar, again for a supporting actor, thanks to L’The Work of God, the Devil’s Share’ by Lasse Hallström. A veteran actor, the younger generation sought him out as a co-star: Sandra Bullock for Miss Detective (2001), Mike Myers for Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) and Brendan Fraser for A Quiet American (2003). Norman Jewison even directed him as a former Nazi torturer in the thriller Crime Against Humanity in 2003.\n\nFather of Nicolas Cage in The Weather Man, Michael Caine has specialized in the roles of mentor in recent years, whether in the adaptation of the series My Beloved Witch, The Sons of Man by Alfonso Cuaron, or in Batman Begins in which he reprised the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman’s butler, Alfred Pennyworth (held, before him, by Michael Gough), and collaborated for the first time with Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale, whom he then reunited with on the occasion of the Prestige and The Dark Knight, a sequel to the adventures of the Batman. Opposite Laurence Olivier in The Bloodhound in 1972, the actor took over the role played by the latter in 2008, in the remake directed by Kenneth Branagh, while Jude Law slips into the skin of a character created by Michael Caine for the second time after Irresistible Alfie.\n\nIn 2011, he returned to a solitary and vengeful character style, as in his younger years, for the violent vigilante Harry Brown, after reuniting with Christopher Nolan in the impressive Inception (2010), a cult film mixing thriller and science fiction, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard. He reprised his role as Alfred Pennyworth in 2012 in The Dark Knight Rises, the last installment of the mythical Batman trilogy, still directed by Christopher Nolan.\n\nIn 2013 and 2016, Caine played the main villain in Elusive 1 and 2, spectacular thrillers revolving around a group of magicians and illusionists led by Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg. The British director then travelled to Italy to shoot Youth, directed by Paolo Sorrentino. He plays Fred, a retired composer and conductor, enjoying his holidays in a beautiful hotel at the foot of the Alps with his best friend Mick (Harvey Keitel).\n\nIn 2017, phlegmatic Michael teams up with Morgan Freeman to rob a bank in Old Fashioned Heist. Two years later, he stayed in the theme of 3rd age crime with Gentlemen Burglars. Based on a true story, the story tells the story of the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit heist in London. Caine slips into the costume of Brian Reader, the mastermind of the operation. Always loyal to Christopher Nolan, he was cast in Dunkirk in 2017 and Tenet in 2020."
