        "text": "English actor Sir Michael Caine was born on this day in 1933. Caine got his first credited film role in ‘A Hill in Korea’ (1956). It was one of many small parts in film and television before he landed his breakthrough role as an aristocratic army officer in ‘Zulu’ (1964). The role brought him international recognition and he went on to star in a string of iconic movies throughout the 1960s and 70s including ‘The Ipcress File’ (1965), ‘Alfie’ (1966), ‘The Italian Job’ (1969), ‘Battle of Britain’ (1969), ‘Get Carter’ (1971), ‘Sleuth’ (1972), ‘The Man Who Would Be King’ (1975), ‘The Eagle Has Landed’ (1976) and ‘A Bridge Too Far’ (1977).\n\nThe 1980s brought critical acclaim with ‘Educating Rita’ (1983) earning him Golden Globe and BAFTA awards for Best Actor and ‘Hannah and Her Sisters’ earning him his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Other notable film credits include ‘Dirty Rotten Scoundrels’ (1988), ‘The Muppet Christmas Carol’ (1992), ‘Little Voice’ (1998), ‘The Cider House Rules’ (1999), 'Secondhand Lions' (2003), ‘Children of Men’ (2006) and ‘Harry Brown’ (2009). More recently, Michael Caine has been a regular collaborator with Christopher Nolan on a number of highly successful movies including ‘The Dark Knight’ trilogy (2005-2012), ‘The Prestige’ (2006), ‘Inception’ (2010), ‘Interstellar’ (2014) and ‘Tenet’ (2020)."
