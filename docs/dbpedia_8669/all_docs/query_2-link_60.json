        "text": "From The Italian Job to Escape to Victory, legendary English actor Sir Michael Caine has starred in some of the most iconic films in cinema history. But did you know that 89-year-old's star's career started in Lowestoft? After serving two years in the army as part of his national service, Caine started his acting career at the age of 20 in Horsham, Sussex, before moving to Suffolk a year later.\n\nIn 1954, budding actor Caine made the move to Lowestoft to work for the Lowestoft Repertory Company. The Company was based at the town's Arcadia Theatre - now the East Coast Cinema - on London Road South.\n\nIn a fascinating interview, recorded at the Arcadia Theatre in the late 1960s - when it served as a bingo hall - Caine explains how Lowestoft performed a key role in his early acting career. He said: \"You would never have heard of the plays we did here - they were written by anybody from anywhere. But I must say, it taught me a great deal about theatre playing.\"\n\nGet more news from SuffolkLive straight to your inbox for free HERE.\n\nCaine might've travelled to Lowestoft from the south coast to develop his professional career, but as things turned out, his life in Suffolk took more of a personal turn than he ever could've imagined. It was in Lowestoft that Caine, then using the stage name Michael Scott, met his first wife.\n\nActress Patricia Haines had, like Caine, moved to Lowestoft in a bid to launch her own acting career. However, months passed before the two had their first conversation.\n\nCaine said: \"She was the leading lady and because I was a juvenile lead, I never spoke to the leading lady. There was a very definite cast system, especially if you were new. If you were new, that meant you couldn't act, no matter where you'd been before.\n\n\"But I could speak to the juvenile leading lady, whose name was Jean Marlow. One day they had a party at her flat, which she shared with the leading lady. I went to this party and got talking to the leading lady, really for the very first time. Three weeks later I was married to her.\"\n\nOn April 3, 1954, the two married at Lothingland Registry Office in Lowestoft after less than a month together. In 1956, their only daughter, Dominique, was born.\n\nA few weeks after tying the not, the couple moved to London, which Caine hoped to \"conquer\" and further his acting career. Caine and Haines were married for eight years, before separating in 1962. Haines died at the age of just 45 in 1977 after suffering with lung cancer.\n\nHis life in Lowestoft might've only lasted a few months, but there's no denying that the UK's most easterly town played a pivotal role in maturing one of the finest actors in film history.\n\nRead more:"
