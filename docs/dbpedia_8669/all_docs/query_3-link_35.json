        "text": "Michael Caine is 90 today. Born Maurice Micklewhite, he originally took the stage name Michael Scott. He was in a telephone booth when his agent informed him that there was already a Michael Scott performing as an actor in London and that he had to come up with a new name immediately. He looked around , saw a billboard advertising the film, 'The Caine Mutiny' and decided to change his name to \"Michael Caine\". I can't claim anything half as dramatic but I once came back to Delhi in January 1999 with a hundred plans but not the faintest idea what I was going to to actually do next. For some reason I picked up the land line immediately and called a contact whom a friend had casually mentioned a month before. I actually got through from the switchboard to this cultured British voice to whom I explained my life story and quiz background in about three minutes. He was, as ever, calm and collected, and he told me that it would probably be a good idea to meet. Typical line which I (and many in television) had heard a hundred times before. When I asked when, he replied that the next half hour would be good! I went immediately, met him, worked on the project.. and spent the next 7 glorious years in the same company in many different capacities. But it all started with that one phone call and that one friend who started it all for me. When I asked him much later why he had reacted as he had, he told me that it helped that the head of production based in Singapore had called just half an hour before to tell him that they were doing an India Pakistan cricket quiz the next month and they needed to get a team together asap. The next time you think it's all happening for you just because of your talent and ability, look back and figure out how much fate has conspired in your success..."
