        "text": "(born 1933). British motion-picture actor Michael Caine was renowned for his versatility in numerous leading and character roles. He was the recipient of two Academy Awards for best supporting actor, for his work in Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) and The Cider House Rules (1999).\n\nCaine was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, Jr., on March 14, 1933, in London, England. He took his screen name from the 1954 film The Caine Mutiny. Caine entered motion pictures in 1956 and played a variety of roles in British productions such as A Hill in Korea (1956), How to Murder a Rich Uncle (1957), The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961), and Zulu (1964). He earned wide success with The Ipcress File (1965)—the first of four films in which Caine portrayed British spy Harry Palmer. His real breakthrough, however, was in the title role of Alfie (1966), for which he received an Academy Award nomination as best actor. His other successful films of the 1960s include Funeral in Berlin (1966), Gambit (1966), The Wrong Box (1966), Hurry Sundown (1967), and The Italian Job (1969).\n\nBy the 1970s Caine had achieved international stardom. He appeared in the cult classic Get Carter (1971) and received another best actor Oscar nomination for Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s Sleuth (1972), in which he starred opposite Laurence Olivier. He followed these successes with popular films such as John Huston’s The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and John Sturges’s The Eagle Has Landed (1976).\n\nCaine continued his prodigious output during the 1980s, appearing in some two dozen films during the decade. Though many of these films were dismal failures, Caine’s reputation did not suffer, because he had garnered respect for being such a tireless workhorse. His better films of the 1980s include Brian De Palma’s Dressed to Kill (1980), Deathtrap (1982), Educating Rita (1983; best actor Oscar nomination), Mona Lisa (1986), Woody Allen’s Hannah and Her Sisters, Without a Clue (1988), and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988). The Cider House Rules was a standout film in the 1990s and earned Caine his second Oscar. By the end of the 20th century, Caine had appeared in more than 100 films.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Caine was nominated as best actor for his performance as a conflicted British journalist in Vietnam in The Quiet American (2002). In 2005 he appeared in Batman Begins, playing the superhero’s butler and confidant, Alfred. The film was a critical and commercial success. He reprised the role in the sequels The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Caine’s other notable films from this time include the thrillers Children of Men (2006) and The Prestige (2006). In 2007 he starred in Kenneth Branagh’s remake of Sleuth, portraying the character originally played by Olivier. Caine later appeared as a vigilante in Harry Brown (2009) and as the mentor to a corporate spy (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) in the science-fiction thriller Inception (2010). He then provided voices for the animated films Gnomeo & Juliet (2011) and Cars 2 (2011) and played a stranded adventurer in the family-oriented film Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (2012).\n\nCaine authored several best-selling books. Acting in Film (1987) is considered an invaluable resource for actors, and his memoirs What’s It All About? (1993) and The Elephant to Hollywood (2010) were popular with general audiences. In 1993 Caine was made Commander of the British Empire, and he was knighted in 2000. In 2011 he was made Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, the highest cultural honor in France."
