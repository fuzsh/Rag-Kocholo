        "text": "After six decades in the business, Michael Caine has earned his retirement. Appearing on BBC Radio’s Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review programme, the actor said that his current film Best Sellers is likely his last.\n\nThe mid-budget comedy-drama, in which he stars as a cranky, reclusive author butting heads with a modern publisher played by Aubrey Plaza, has “turned out to be what is my last part really,” he said. The two-time winner of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar (for Hannah and Her Sisters and The Cider House Rules) remarked “I haven’t worked for two years, and I have a spine problem which affects my legs so I can’t walk very well.”\n\nThough he has other work that was shot prior to Best Sellers that has yet to see release, including the Czech historical action picture Medieval, he reiterated to interviewer Simon Mayo that he “think[s Best Sellers] would be” his last film. He added, “there haven’t been any offers honestly for two years, because nobody’s been making any movies I’d wanna do.”\n\nThe actor, who has entertained film audiences from Alfie to Zulu, added “you know I’m 88. There’s not exactly scripts pouring out with a leading man that’s 88, you know?”\n\nCaine, who has published a number of successful books about Hollywood and the acting craft, recently turned his quill toward fiction. During the pandemic he wrote a thriller called If You Don’t Want To Die, that is being readied for publication. “My professional—my life has been with 150 people all day long every day. So I now sit down to do something on my own. And I think that’s what it is all about,” he told NPR about the writer’s life, while also slyly quoting a phrase forever associated with him as a young man.\n\nBut then comes the twist! A short while after this story hit, Caine’s representatives told The Wrap that retirement may be too strong a word. The trade paper wrote that they had confirmed that Caine “is not fully retiring.” (V.F. has reached out for further clarification.)\n\nOne suspects that, with Christopher Nolan readying a biopic on J. Robert Oppenheimer, there might be room for at least a quick Caine cameo. The two have worked together on nine previous projects. (Who else but Michael Caine could sell a line like Interstellar’s “I will have solved the problem of gravity”?)\n\nDon’t Recommend It\n\nOne Weird Trick for Acting Like Michael Caine\n\nDid you know the talented Mr. Caine could do this?\n\nit's about time\n\nTenet’s Tortured Trip to the Screen: A Complete History\n\nChristopher Nolan’s cerebral thriller arrives in many U.S. theaters this week.
