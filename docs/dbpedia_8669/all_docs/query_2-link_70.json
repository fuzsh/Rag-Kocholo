        "text": "The world of cinema is experiencing a day of sadness with the retirement of actor Michael Caine.\n\nThe 90-year-old Briton has decided to step out of the limelight for good after his latest film, 'The Great Escaper'.\n\nIn it, the actor plays Bernie Jordan, a former World War II combatant who escaped from the old people's home where he spent his last days to attend the celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings.\n\nCaine expressed his desire to no longer perform whilst speaking to the BBC.\n\n\"I keep saying I'm going to retire. Well, I will now,\" the actor confirmed. \"The only roles I can get now are 90-year-old men. Or maybe 85. They won't be leading roles. There are no 90-year-old leading men, there are young, seductive guys. So I said to myself that the best thing to do was to leave,\" said the actor, who will not be back on the big screen.\n\nMichael Caine has been in more than 160 films and is the winner of two Oscars.\n\nIn a sublime career, Michael Caine has appeared in more than 160 films in almost 70 years as an actor.\n\nMichael Caine's Oscars success\n\nHe will always be remembered for being the winner of two Oscars, as well as being nominated six times.\n\nThe first statuette he won in 1986 for 'Hannah and Her Sisters', directed by Woody Allen.\n\nIn 1999 he was awarded for 'The Cider House Rules', directed by Lasse Hallstrom. The following year he was made 'Sir Michael' by Queen Elizabeth II of England, one of the highest honours for a citizen of the islands.\n\nHe rose to fame in the 1960s with the feature film 'Zulu' and went on to have roles in 'The Italian Job' and 'The Footprint'."
