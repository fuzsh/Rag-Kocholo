        "text": "Absolutely Fantastic\n\nThis was my first time ordering from SciFier but it definitely won't be my last. When it comes to buying books online the packaging needs to be good, SciFier were great they used bubble wrap to make sure they arrived perfect. Amazing range of books that majority are lower priced than most book retailers. Wonderful service, I'll definitely be recommending to everyone. Thank you.\n\nL - United Kingdom\n\nMy favourite pick for manga\n\nGreat delivery to EU, no issues with customs. Very good packaging. A nice selection of manga and, so far, the best prices I could find :)\n\nM - Slovenia\n\nMy first time buying from this shop\n\nMy first time buying from this shop, but not my last. My books arrived lovely and wrapped up perfectly, just the way we like them. Looking forward to reading then and ordering more, a wonderful online experience. Check it out for yourself, go full geek.\n\nJ - United Kingdom\n\nGreat as always\n\nSame old, same old. Amazing experience, great packaging, shipping was faster since it was a bit smaller and check out was smooth as butter. I have now put myself on a buy allowance because I cannot be trusted lol.\n\nR - United States"
