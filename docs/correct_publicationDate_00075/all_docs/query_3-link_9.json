This best-selling novel is an \"American pastorale, a hymn to self-sufficiency and the virtues of small-town life ... {The] book has something of the appeal of George Stewart's EARTH ABIDES, although it lacks that work's sweep and grandeur. Fundamentally a cosy fantasy, ALAS, BABYLON belongs very much to its period. It would be impossible to write such a hopeful novel about nuclear war today.\" - Pringle, Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels 29. Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-421.
