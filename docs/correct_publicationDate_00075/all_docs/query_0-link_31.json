        "text": "Alas, Babylon.\n\nFRANK, Pat.\n\n$8,800.00\n\nItem Number: 122391\n\nPhiladelphia: J.B. Lippincott Company, 1959.\n\nFirst edition of this classic apocalyptic novel. Octavo, original cloth. Signed and dated by the author in the year of publication on the front free endpaper, “Pat Frank ’59.” Near fine in a very good dust jacket. Jacket design by Arthur Hawkins. First editions are exceptionally rare signed, as the author passed away in 1964.\n\n“Alas, Babylon.” Those fateful words heralded the end. When the unthinkable nightmare of nuclear holocaust ravaged the United States, it was instant death for tens of millions of people; for survivors, it was a nightmare of hunger, sickness, and brutality. Overnight, a thousand years of civilization were stripped away. But for one small Florida town, miraculously spared against all the odds, the struggle was only just beginning, as the isolated survivors—men and women of all ages and races—found the courage to come together and confront the harrowing darkness. “An extraordinary real picture of human beings numbed by catastrophe but still driven by the unconquerable determination of living creatures to keep on being alive\" (The New Yorker)."
