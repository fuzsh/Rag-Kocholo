        "text": "Description\n\nIn Pat Frank’s riveting, insightful, and thought-provoking novel, young, outspoken Jeff Baker comes out of World War II determined to work for the State Department. When he lands his assignment in 1949, he becomes the third secretary of the US embassy in Budapest, an observation post behind the Iron Curtain.\n\nJeff’s experiences as a soldier fighting on a hill in Italy left him scarred and instilled in him a hatred for war in all forms—including the emerging Cold War. But when he is assigned to the “Atlantis Project,” a top-secret mission for organizing an underground resistance in Hungary, he grapples with his beliefs and his loyalty to his superiors. And when he meets Rikki, a dancer in Budapest, he also finds himself torn between this new love and Susan Pickett—the love he left back home in Washington.\n\nAs he becomes more immersed in the Atlantis Project, Jeff must decide what he is willing to risk for a chance to strike a blow for peace."
