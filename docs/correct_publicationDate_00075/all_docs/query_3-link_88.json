        "text": "A powerful post-apocalyptic tale!\n\n“Alas Babylon” is a gripping story of survival of war in the nuclear age. The story focuses on a small group of people in Florida that face the challenges of how to survive after a nuclear holocaust. While the story centers on the group’s ability to adapt and overcome the challenges of living in this new and very different world, it also tells about the survival of humanity, community, charity and most of all, hope. The story also serves as a warning of how situations can escalate catastrophically during times of great international tension! Any small misstep can result in irreversible consequences. As this story takes place in 1959-1960 time period it would helpful if the reader has knowledge of that time period. “Alas Babylon” by Pat Frank is a great read and I highly recommend it.\n\nVerified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned\n\nVery readable intro to the mindset of being prepared for any disaster.\n\nThis was the first \"preparedness\" novel I ever read, and being written in the late 50's, it reflects the political and economic and military thought of its day. While the author and/or his hero make some mistakes, it put my mind to thinking about being prepared, and remains one of my favorite books for helping people prepare for whatever worst-case-disaster they may some day face. Well worth the read, and young readers will enjoy it as well."
