The day after the bomb dropped the thousands of years of ‘progress’ that had covered the treacheriesand weaknesses of ordinary man with a thin veneer of civilization were dissolved and melted like snow on the desert’s dusty face. Then the law of the jungle reigned, but in the wreckage a few courageous surviviors, men and women with the guts to have hope, were determined to build a new and better world on the ruins of the old. This is their story."
