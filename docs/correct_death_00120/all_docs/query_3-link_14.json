        "meta_description": "Robert Mitchum. Actor: Goldenes Gift. Robert Mitchum was an underrated American leading man of enormous ability, who sublimated his talents beneath an air of disinterest. He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to Ann Harriet (Gunderson), a Norwegian immigrant, and James Thomas Mitchum, a shipyard/railroad worker. His father died in a train accident when he was two, and Robert and his siblings (including brother John Mitchum, later also an actor) were...",

        "text": "Turned down the lead role of Gen. George S. Patton in Patton: Rebell in Uniform (1970), allegedly because he believed he would ruin the film due to his indifference. During a Turner Classic Movies interview with Robert Osborne, Mitchum said that he knew the movie could be a great one due to the script, but that the studio would want to concentrate on battles and tanks moving around on screen rather than on the character of Patton. Mitchum believed that with himself in the role, the movie would turn out mediocre; what was needed was a passionate actor who would fight his corner to keep the focus on Patton, an actor like George C. Scott, whom Mitchum recommended to the producers.\n\nTurned down the role that eventually went to Tony Curtis in Flucht in Ketten (1958). Mitchum, a real-life veteran of a Southern chain gang, did not believe the premise that a black man and a white man would be chained together and said that such a thing would never happen in the South. Over the years, this reason was corrupted to the point where many people now believe Mitchum turned down the role because he did not want to be chained to a black man, an absolute falsehood. Curtis repeated the inaccurate story in his autobiography, but later recanted after Mitchum's real reason was explained to him.\n\nKatherine Hepburn once shouted at him: \"You can't act! You know you can't act and you would never have gotten a single picture if you weren't handsome! I'm sick of working with people who have nothing to offer!\" Mitchum's only response was to shrug his shoulders.\n\nIn 1959, the Mitchums moved out of Hollywood and into a farm they had bought on the Maryland shore of Chesapeake Bay, near the town of Trappe. In 1965, the family returned to Hollywood, largely at wife Dorothy Mitchum's insistence, and moved into a modest, ivy-covered mansion in Bel Air. Mitchum also purchased a 76-acre ranch near Los Angeles, mostly as a home for his growing collection of quarter horses.\n\nIn 1981, he fired his secretary, Reva Frederick, when he closed his office. Mitchum was subsequently sued as she claimed he owed her a pension back-dated to 1961. There was no paperwork to support this claim, and she dropped her suit when evidence was discovered that she had stolen millions of dollars from Mitchum over the years. As part of the \"deal\", he agreed not to prosecute. During the course of these events, Ms. Fredrick suffered a stroke from which she never fully recovered.\n\nHe was accused of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial after an interview he gave to Barry Rehfeld of \"Esquire\" magazine promoting Der Feuersturm (1983) at his home in February 1983. Mitchum wrote an apologetic letter on 9 March 1983 to Herbert Luft, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency's Hollywood columnist. Mitchum claimed he had recited views expressed by the bigoted football coach he had played in Champions (1982), which Rehfeld \"mistakenly believed to be my own. From that point on, he approached me as the character in the script and in playing the devil's advocate in a prankish attempt to string him along we compounded a tragedy of errors.\" Mitchum added he was \"truly sorry that this misunderstanding has upset so many people, especially since it is so foreign to my principle. The attendant misfortune is that it has brought me a spate of mail from people and organizations who are encouraged to believe that I share their bigotry and discrimination.\".\n\nBriefly served in the United States Army during World War II, with service number 39 744 068, from April 12 - October 11, 1945, after he was drafted. According to Lee Server's 2001 biography, \"Robert Mitchum: Baby I Don't Care\", Mitchum said he served as a medic at an induction department, checking recruits' genitals for venereal disease (a \"pecker checker\"). Always the iconoclast, although he did not want to join the military, he served honorably and was discharged as a Private First Class and received the World War II Victory Medal.\n\nHe seriously considered retiring from acting in 1968 due to concerns over the quality of his recent movies. After a year's absence, during which he spent much of the time driving around America visiting old friends and staying in motels, he was lured back to star in Ryans Tochter (1970).\n\nIn the film 'Angel Face he was told to slap Jean Simmons across the face which he did while holding himself back. Director Otto Preminger wasn't happy with the result and kept asking him to do it again and not to hold back. Mitchum turned round gave him a good slap across the face and asked if it was hard enough.\n\nTodfeinde (1968), the showdown between Hollywood's two deities of indifference, produced no sparks on or off the screen. Dean Martin remained in his trailer watching television after filming was completed, and delivered his lines as though he had memorized them phonetically. The only excitement came when a massive camera collapsed and nearly hammered Mitchum into the ground. Instead, the star moved casually aside while thousands of dollars worth of equipment smashed around him."
