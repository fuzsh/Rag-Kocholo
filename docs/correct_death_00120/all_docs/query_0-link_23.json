Mitchum rose to prominence for his starring roles in several classic films noir, and is generally considered a forerunner of the antiheroes prevalent in film during the 1950s and '60s. His best-known films include The Story of G.I. Joe (1945), Out of the Past (1947), The Night of the Hunter (1955), The Enemy Below (1957), Thunder Road (1958), Cape Fear (1962), and El Dorado (1966). He was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor for The Story of G.I. Joe in 1945. He is rated number 23 on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest male stars of Classic American Cinema.[1]\n\nRobert Charles Durman Mitchum was born 6 August 1917 in Bridgeport, Connecticut,[2] the son of James Mitchum and Ann Gunderson. His mother was a Norwegian immigrant and sea captain's daughter, while his father was of English descent. As a youth, Robert was known as a prankster and got into a lot of trouble.\n\nFor a few years in the late 1930s, Mitchum bounced back and forth between Delaware and Southern California. He arrived in Long Beach, California, in 1936, staying with his sister Julie. Within a few years, though, he was back on the east coast, where he married his wife, Dorothy Clements Spence 16 March 1940 in Dover, Delaware. [3] They were the parents of three children: James (Josh), Chris and Petrine.\n\nThe Mitchums returned to Hollywood soon after their marriage. He found steady work in the L.A. area as a machine operator, but this didn't last. A nervous breakdown (which resulted in temporary blindness), from job-related stress, led Mitchum to look for work as an actor or extra in movies. After impressing director Mervyn LeRoy during the making of Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, Mitchum signed a seven-year contract with RKO Radio Pictures.[4] Shortly after making the film, Mitchum himself was drafted into the United States Army, serving at Fort MacArthur, California.[5]\n\nAfter his stint in the service, he began to make critically acclaimed movies and garnered the rewards associated with them. AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars lists Mitchum as the 23rd greatest male actor (Carole Lombard is the 23rd greatest female actress) in American cinema. AFI also recognized his performance as the menacing rapist Max Cady and Reverend Harry Powell as the 28th and 29th greatest screen villains, respectively, of all time as part of AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains.[6]\n\nRobert Mitchum died 1 July 1997 in Santa Barbara, California, at the age of 79.[7] His remains were buried at Odd Fellows Cemetery in Camden, Delaware.[8]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Robert Mitchum on Wikipedia.\n\n↑ California, World War II Draft Registration Cards, 1940-1945,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QGF9-LCN3 : 2 March 2020), Robert Charles Durman Mitchum, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, United States; from \"Draft Registration Cards for California, 10/16/1940 - 03/31/1947.\" Database and images.
