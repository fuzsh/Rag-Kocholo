        "text": "The Town of Lane and Williamsburg County will unveil a historical marker commemorating Robert Mitchum, one of the greatest motion picture stars of the 20th century, in the square in Lane on December 10. The unveiling will be followed by a screening of the 1958 film Thunder Road, an action film about moonshiners and the drivers who drove the liquor past the police sent to stop them. Robert Mitchum was the leading man. Immediately after the film, Petrine Mitchum, his daughter, will appear and address the attendees and answer questions.\n\nSchedule:\n\n1 p.m., Saturday, December 10, unveiling of Robert Mitchum marker, Square in Lane\n\n2:30 p.m., Saturday, December 10, screening of Thunder Road and appearance of Petrine Mitchum, Williamsburg County Council Chambers, 201 West Main Street, Kingstree\n\nROBERT MITCHUM AND WILLLIAMSBURG\n\nIt’s a remarkable story, one that could be, well … a movie. In 1908, a young Williamsburg County farm boy from Lane was drawn to see the wider world. He went to New York City and enlisted in the Army. The Army taught him about railroads and locomotives during his three-year hitch at a Fort on Long Island Sound. Across the Sound in Connecticut, he met and fell in love with a girl, the daughter of a Norwegian sea captain. When the soldier mustered out of the Army in 1911, he returned to South Carolina and went to work for the railroad in Charleston. Soon, he went back to Connecticut, married the girl who won his heart and brought her back to Charleston.\n\nThe farm boy was James Mitchum, always called “Jimmy.” Annie Gunderson was the girl he married. On Nassau Street in downtown Charleston, they made a home at number 89 and started raising a family, while Jimmy took jobs in railroad work. The last two years, he worked at the Navy Yard. They lived in the same house for three years and it was there Annie had their first child, Annette in 1914. They moved back to Annie’s home in Connecticut in 1916 and lived there for two years. In August 1917, Annie gave birth to a son they named Robert.\n\nIn late 1918, the young couple made the decision to return to South Carolina. It was a fateful choice. Jimmy took a job as a trainman at the Navy Yard, working alongside many men he knew from the years he worked there before. They took a room at 34 Chapel Street, where a number of other families and one single woman lived. Several men in the house worked at the Navy Yard along with Jimmy. Chapel Street was a pleasant place with larger houses and less crowded than Nassau had been. Two grocery stores were only two blocks away. One shared telephone was located in the hall. Jimmy’s job as a trainman was more dangerous than his earlier railroad jobs. Annie remembered that he told her once he might come home in a box one day.\n\nHis prediction came true on February 20, 1919 when he was crushed between two rail cars. He was trying to connect the cars. They were slick from a cold, steady rain. When a wrong signal was sent to the engineer, Jimmy slipped trying to get free. Someone called the phone in the hall at 34 Chapel to tell Annie the terrible news and someone got her to the Navy Yard’s Dispensary. That was where they took Jimmy. The damage to his chest was too great to survive, but he lived long enough for her to get there. She held him in her arms as he died. He was only 32. The men and women Jimmy and Annie knew from their years in Charleston rallied around her in the wake of this tragedy. So did Jimmy’s family in Williamsburg. Annie and the two children, moved in with Jimmy’s younger sister, Idell, and her husband, Alfred, on their farm on Heineman Road just outside Lane. They stayed there for six months before Annie took the children to her parents’ home in Connecticut.\n\nYoung Robert Mitchum had no memory of his father, but he felt the loss deeply. He told his younger brother, John, he intended to see the place their father was born. In 1933, he did exactly that, but he did more than just see Lane. When the Great Depression engulfed America, Robert, like many teens, left to ride the rails and lessen the financial burden on his family. In September 1933, at the age of 16, he was arrested in Savannah, Georgia for vagrancy and sentenced to 30 days on the chain gang. Scared of a guard he was told was a killer, he ran away. As if to prove what the other prisoners told Robert, the guard shot at the fleeing teenager. The shot missed. Robert hopped a freight train north. When it stopped in Lane, SC, he got off and was very quickly shown to the farm of Idell and Alfred Mitchum. Idell was shocked when Robert knocked on her door, but she immediately embraced the young son of her lost brother. Robert stayed for days and told them about the chain gang. Idell and Alfred spared nothing caring for their nephew. He came back a number of times in the next few years, sometimes with friends who were also riding freights. Sometimes Idell found him sleeping on their front porch. Young Robert Mitchum bonded with his large Mitchum family in Williamsburg County. It was a bond that lasted the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1940, Robert Mitchum married Dorothy Spencer in Delaware. He was living in Hollywood writing and already acting. On his way back to California, he brought Dorothy to Lane to meet his family. He started winning roles in cowboy movies in 1943. Then the roles expanded to other kinds of films. In 1944, he co-starred with Spencer Tracy in Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo. The following year, he co-starred with Burgess Meredith in The Story of GI Joe and won nomination for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. His career exploded after that and he became one of the biggest film stars of the twentieth century, making over 80 major motion pictures until his death in 1997. The details of his career are well known to anyone who follows Hollywood. What is very little known, even in Williamsburg County, is the extent of the ties he carefully maintained with his father’s family.\n\nRobert never lost contact with his Williamsburg family. He invited them up to Asheville, NC in 1957 when he was filming Thunder Road and 23 of them went, including his Aunt Idell and Uncle Alfred, all riding in cars Robert rented for them. The same year he was interviewed for a syndicated column by Earl Wilson. When Wilson asked him where he was from, Mitchum said, “I’m from Lane, South Carolina.”\n\nThree years later, he was in Savannah making Cape Fear and invited his relatives to visit. Many did just that. He hired his cousin, Douglas Mitchum, Idell and Alfred’s son, to be his driver during the filming. His visits to the family were legendary among the Mitchums in Williamsburg. He sometimes called Douglas when he was in Charleston and take the family to dinner. One relative recalled him visiting Kingstree and going to the drug store for lunch without anyone bothering him. These connections were practically unknown outside the family until Williamsburg County decided to commemorate its connection to this remarkable member of one of its oldest families. Today, with a historical marker in the park in Lane and designation of a week-long Robert Mitchum Film Festival, the County celebrates this great actor and claims him as truly one of our own."
