        "text": "THE most interesting thing about ''Promises to Keep,'' the television movie on CBS at 9 o'clock tonight, is the album of family photographs woven into the production. They, at least, are believable, or as believable as snapshots of a famous Hollywood family are likely to get. ''Promises to Keep'' stars Robert Mitchum as Jack Palmer, a roustabout who left his family 30 years earlier; his son Chris Mitchum as Tom Palmer, Jack's still resentful son, and Chris's son Bentley Mitchum as Jack's grandson, Johnny.\n\nSo all those old photos of fathers and sons really do come from the Mitchum archives. And that is about as genuine as ''Promises to Keep'' gets. The rest, embalmed in a Phil Penningroth script, is an exercise in pointless motion. Characteristically to the point, Robert Mitchum has disclosed the prime purpose of the movie: ''I thought it would be good for the family bank account.''\n\nThe scenario, produced by Sandra Harmon and directed by Noel Black, finds Jack being told that he must undergo a serious operation, presumably for cancer. On the way from a ranch in Wyoming to the hospital in Los Angeles, he decides to stop off in Santa Barbara to look up the wife and son he abandoned three decades earlier. His wife, played by Claire Bloom with as much dignity as she can muster under the circumstances, is understandably furious but still finds the old codger attractive. She warns him that Tom remains bitter. Jack mutters, ''I know it's been a long time.'' The motivations never get more specific or enlightening.\n\nTom is having his own problems. His fishing-boat business is in trouble and his son, inheriting some of the grandfather's wanderlust, wants to postpone college and travel around the world for a while. As might be suspected about a star of Mr. Mitchum's stature, he is not likely at this stage of his life and career to indulge in downbeat projects. It is a virtual certainty that his film projects will inevitably have happy, upbeat endings. And, despite the formidable odds, ''Promises to Keep'' is no exception as father, son and grandson are finally brought together for -what else? - a fistfight to vanquish the villains."
