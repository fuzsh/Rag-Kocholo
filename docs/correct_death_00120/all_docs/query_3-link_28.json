        "text": "There was no disguising the sadness as John Mitchum spoke Monday afternoon,\n\nhis voice a bass nearly as deep as his famous brother's laconic growl. The\n\nJamestown resident had learned of Robert Mitchum's death only hours before,\n\nin an 8:30 a.m. telephone call from his nephew Chris.\n\n''Only Bob and I really know of the intimacy we've had over the years,''\n\nJohn Mitchum said. ''We hoboed across the country when I was 14 and he was\n\n16. Of course, we fought together, and the worst fight I ever had in my\n\nlife was with him.\n\n''He was the most generous man I have ever known. I consider him one\n\nof the finest individuals I've known in my life. I have beautiful memories.''\n\nThose recollections leavened Mitchum's grief, along with the knowledge\n\nthat he had done something to cheer his brother's final weeks. John -- an\n\nactor in his own right who long toiled in the shadow of Robert's legend\n\n-- spent the winter organizing Them Ornery Mitchum Brothers Days.\n\nA celebration of the siblings' careers, the May 2-3 festivities included\n\na celebrity roast that brought such Hollywood stalwarts as Anne Jeffreys,\n\nJack Elam and James Drury to Jamestown. Robert, too ill to attend, enjoyed\n\nthe proceedings via telephone from his Montecito home.\n\n''We started the whole thing when I recognized the fact that he hadn't\n\nvery long (to live,'' John Mitchum said. ''I just told them he was not\n\nstrong enough to come up. But he was in pretty bad shape.''\n\nThe event, Mitchum said, offered an opportunity to repay in some small\n\nway all Robert had done for him. ''I was so grateful for that,'' he said.\n\nMitchum was unstinting in expressing his admiration for Robert.\n\n''Courageous, profoundly brilliant, tender. He could be very fierce when\n\nthe occasion demanded. He was an enormous talent -- he wrote poetry, he\n\nwrote music -- but he rose above that from a standpoint of ego. (He never\n\nallowed ego to enter the talent field.''\n\nThat lack of ego concerning his work, talent and legacy persisted into\n\nRobert's final weeks.\n\nIn a Record interview conducted in conjunction with Them Ornery Mitchum\n\nBrothers Days, he turned aside all questions relating to his status as a\n\nHollywood legend.\n\n''I have to repeat the old saw that one of the greatest movie stars was\n\nRin Tin Tin, and he was a dog,'' Robert Mitchum said.\n\n''It's been worth it,'' he added. ''I did it, and I'm done with it.''\n\nIt was his brother's generosity perhaps more than any other attribute\n\nthat sticks with John Mitchum. On Monday, he recalled a period in the late\n\n1940s and early '50s when his marriage was in trouble. One day, the phone\n\nrang, and it was Robert.\n\n''He said, 'What are you doing?' I said, 'Nothing, just staring out the\n\nwindow.' ''\n\nRobert told his brother he needed him on a movie set in Colorado, that\n\na plane ticket was waiting for him at the airport. He was not actually needed\n\non the shoot, John Mitchum said, but brother Robert knew he needed a project\n\nto keep his mind off his marital woes.\n\n''It's the kind of thing he did all the time,'' Mitchum said. He noted\n\nthat he had received more than 30 calls from Robert's friends, ''all just\n\nflattened'' by his death.\n\n''He is truly a great man,'' Mitchum said. ''I feel elevated having known\n\nhim that long. I can't put it any other way.''\n\nStockton fans react\n\n\"He was a very workmanlike actor who took his roles seriously and\n\nenjoyed creating all those characters. He was a leading man or a villain,\n\ncowboy and soldier, and played both sides in thrillers. One of the comedic\n\nroles he played was in 'What a Way to Go,' with Shirley MacLaine. MacLaine\n\nwould get all excited and emotional, and he would remain calm, collected,\n\nunflappable and in control.\n\n-- Leslie Crow,\n\nBank of Stockton archivist\n\n\"He was one of a kind, the droopy-eyed anti-hero. I never saw a\n\nbetter performance from him than the one he gave in 'Ryan's Daughter.' It\n\nwas a little daring for him at that time. And in films like 'Night of the\n\nHunter' and 'Cape Fear,' he could be menacing without being overtly menacing.\n\nWhen he appeared on screen, you began to squirm. He could do anything, even\n\nlight comedy, like 'The Grass is Greener.' \"\n\n-- Vince Perrin,\n\nexecutive director,\n\nStockton Arts Commission\n\n\"I had a personal experience with Mitchum. ... In the late 1970s,\n\n... they showed 'The Big Sleep' in its entirety at a convention on Coronado\n\nIsland. Mitchum was in the audience. After the movie, the house lights came\n\non, and he made a joke: 'Well, if everyone had a big sleep through that,\n\nI can really understand.' \"\n\n-- Dale Davison,\n\npresident and CEO of CinemaCal Enterprises,\n\nowner of Stockton Royal Theater\n\n\"Bob Mitchum had a kind of chemistry that no actor at that time\n\n-- and maybe since that time -- had. He seemed reasonably tough, but at\n\nthe same time, he was easygoing and 'cool.' One of my favorites is a film\n\nhe did with Kirk Douglas -- 'Out of the Past.' The two of them worked well\n\noff of each other.\"\n\n-- Don Walker,\n\nUniversity of the Pacific archivist\n\n\"I'm saddened by the loss of yet another great star. Robert Mitchum\n\nwas a giant of an actor. One of my favorite movies was one he made with\n\nDeborah Kerr, 'Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison.' It was a touching story, the\n\nkind that you don't see anymore.\"\n\n-- Marian Jacobs,\n\npublic-relations executive, Stockton\n\nCompiled by Record staff writer Howard Lachtman."
