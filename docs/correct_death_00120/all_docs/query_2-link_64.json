        "text": "Fire Down Below, Dir. Robert Parrish, 1957, 116 mins, Talking Pictures TV\n\nLooking at that film poster, I’m thinking I saw some other movie. This very odd, 1950s melodrama is a pretty poor effort, only really notable for its above-average cast (and it was seeing Jack Lemmon’s name attached in particular that got me watching it). Lemmon being one of my favourite actors, I like to watch anything he’s been in at least once – just like I tend to watch anything with Peter Cushing in, or, lately, Robert Ryan. Sometimes the film turns out to be a winner, which feels all the better if its a film I might not otherwise have seen without the actor’s name attached, and sometimes, well, it turns out to be a stinker, but at least that has the consolation of another tick on the bucket list of a favourite actor’s filmography.\n\nWell, this one is definitely a stinker. The casting is really quite bizarre; is there an unlikelier pair of smuggling sailors than Robert Mitchum and Jack Lemmon, especially with the silly sailor outfits the costume dept. makes them wear? They play two skippers smuggling people and goods around the Caribbean in a small boat they purchased together, who get hired to take enigmatic red-haired beauty Rita Hayworth (Gilda, Affair in Trinidad) across the islands and a bit closer to Cuba. I confess to feeling sorry for poor Rita; she looks bored and lost, as if she’s fully aware that the films a dud but perhaps also because she knew her career at this point was definitely going south, her days of being Hollywood’s biggest sex siren well over. There’s a sadness about her performance that is almost tangible: real life or great acting? This feeling is intensified by an embarrassing dance number in which Rita cavorts with some partying locals (life is one long party in the Caribbean, it seems) only offers poor comparison with Rita’s earlier films and feels shoe-horned into this film because, well, its Rita.\n\nIf Rita’s better films were behind her, Lemmon’s lay ahead of him- this was only his seventh film and his first with a cast as substantial as this. He’s horribly miscast (was his earlier role in Mister Roberts to blame?) but he gamely attempts to make the best of it; its clearly a stepping-stone to better films (Some Like It Hot was only two years away, with all those other Billy Wilder classics beyond it). One feels MItchum could do this kind of role in his sleep, and he certainly seems to be coasting by via presence alone, and doesn’t seem to be making any effort, certainly not like Lemmon is. I had the distinct feeling watching this film that Lemmon is trying to lift the material while his co-stars have experience enough to know it isn’t worth the bother and have cut their losses with the pay check and pleasures of the exotic locale, sort of like a paid holiday.\n\nThe film is intended to be a steamy, exotic romantic triangle with the two skippers at odds over who gets Rita, but it never ignites or works at all. Rita, for her part, fails to have any chemistry with either of them, looking thoroughly bored and uncomfortable; she knows this kind of thing should be behind her. Lemmon falls for Rita, Mitchum betrays Lemmon, and Lemmon ends up trapped in the cargo hold of a freighter about to blow up. The dialogue is horrible, the film lacks any pace at all and has a very curious structure- it suddenly shifts from romantic potboiler to naval survival drama like its two different films stuck together, so much so that Mitchum and Rita seem irrelevant in the films last section. A final coda between the three, possibly intended to be a climactic, dramatic moment, falls horribly flat, landing with such a thud as the film closes that it leaves the film feeling utterly broken. Nobody’s finest hour, this.\n\nAngel Face, 1952, 91 mins, BBC iPlayer\n\nIt always surprises me watching old films, well, pre-1960 films anyway, whenever they manage, out of the blue, to completely shock. I’m not entirely sure why, but its probably censorship of the time, the motion picture production code, curtailing films from any wild excess that might corrupt audiences – which is funny, considering how films of the day treated women, racial stereotypes and nonchalantly portrayed excessive drinking and smoking. So its tempting when watching them – remarkable as it is what some films got away with, certainly film noir of the 1940s- to think you are in some kind of safe zone. But its not entirely true, and its possibly why when the shocks come they can be so intense. Otto Preminger’s Angel Face has two such moments, and each left me dumbstruck at what I was watching. Maybe in modern movies they wouldn’t shock quite so much, but in a period film such as this they really come out of leftfield.\n\nLike Richard Widmark as the psycho killer Tommy Udo in Kiss of Death, suddenly throwing Rizzo’s aged mother -in a wheelchair no less- down a flight of stairs to her death, or the shower scene in Psycho… these are moments you never forget, and Angel Face is right up there.\n\nIts foolish of me, maybe, considering its a film from 1952, to consider spoilers, but this was the first time I’d seen the film, aftercall, and I had never heard anything about this film’s shock moments so I’ll refrain from describing them here in order that those curious can watch the film similarly unspoiled. Maybe I’m hyping them too far, but I don’t think so.\n\nMaybe its so more shocking in Angel Face because its a noir wrapped up and largely hidden in some domestic, romantic drama starring, of all people, a young, graceful and demur Jean Simmons the definition onscreen of the film’s title and perhaps the unlikeliest femme fatale that I have yet seen. This isn’t some gangland murder story, and its title isn’t Angelic Face of Death or Death Wears the Eyes of An Angel, I mean that would tip what was coming. This is Angel Face, its the story of a frustrated Daddy’s Girl who hates her rich step mother so much she’ll scheme to part Daddy and stepmom, whatever it takes, including seducing poor Robert Mitchum into it, but it doesn’t even slightly suggest…\n\nWell, its definitely noir.\n\nHot on the heels of Crossfire comes another noir thriller starring Robert Mitchum and Robert Ryan – Hollywood was a pretty small world back then when actors were signed to studio contracts, and they sure were kept busy. In 1951 alone, Ryan appeared in five movies (including the wonderful On Dangerous Ground), Mitchum in three and co-star Lizabeth Scott appeared in four herself that year; one of the pleasures of watching these noir is seeing familiar faces turning up in all sorts of roles and movies (Scott for instance appeared in Dark City and I Walk Alone, two noir which I saw last year).\n\nI actually first watched The Racket in early September, but although I enjoyed it didn’t write about it at the time – after having seen Crossfire with Ryan and Mitchum onscreen together again, I decided it might be timely to give The Racket a re-watch, and hey, then opportunity to finally write a post about it.\n\nThe Racket is a crime thriller, in which mobster Nick Scanlon (Ryan) has become increasingly marginalised as his turf has become amalgamated by a high-level organised crime syndicate, more prone to hire corrupt officials and law officers to manage its will rather than resorting to Scanlon’s old-school violence. This is a familiar theme in noir during this period (711 Ocean Drive is an example) – the idea of a nameless criminal syndicate operating across the nation, led by unseen masterminds corrupting the system from within and rendering the law powerless seems to have been perfect for the increasingly paranoid, reds-under-the-bed, enemy-within times. Science fiction films of the time suggested alien menace, while many noir suggested faceless criminal threats and communist espionage, but it all feels very similar and a reflection of the Cold War era.\n\nScanlon’s foil in this film is incorruptible police captain Tom McQuigg (Mitchum), who has been repeatedly sidelined to ever-more backwater precincts by corrupt superiors in the pay of the Syndicate in order to undermine him doing his job. Ryan is brilliant as the fiery mobster getting angrier and angrier at being reined back by his Syndicate superiors, bristling and ready to explode, but Mitchum possibly proves to be the films weakest link. To be fair his relentlessly honest police captain is sadly one-dimensional, but Mitchum just seems happy to stride around like a cowboy from one his western flicks transplanted onto the then-modern day streets. His whole demeanour (walk, sneer and drawl) is so much that of a cowboy its a little irritating, but one has to remember Mitchum wasn’t a trained actor (at least that’s what I gather from what I’ve read) but seems confident that he can get by with just his sheer physicality alone. He’s ruggedly handsome, tall and powerfully built: he looks the part of a cinematic hero and it seems that was enough: guys wanted to be him, girls wanted to be with him, its a familiar story in Hollywood.\n\nUnfortunately while its a competent crime thriller, The Racket has the air of almost comfortable routine- its cinematography doesn’t look as arrestingly imaginative as, say, that of Crossfire did, the script doesn’t surprise too often and the last reel fails to generate the tension it needs to. It certainly isn’t as edgy and dark as the best noir prove to be. This is a police procedural morality tale of an honest police captain inspiring one of his men, and a reminder of the supreme price some lawmen (and their wives) have to pay. A tale of corruption and frustrated lawmen trying to clean the dirty streets, unfortunately for the film those lawmen are awfully plain and unmemorable compared to the bad guys like Ryan and, in a nice sleazy turn William Conrad as an openly corrupt Detective, Turk. Strangely enough, its the latter who struck me as likely inspiration for Tim Burton and one of his films corrupt cops ( Lt. Eckhardt) in the 1989 Batman movie: it seems quite evident that Burton likely looked at films like The Racket for inspiration for the gothic noir look of his comicbook film that enabled its own timeless look.\n\nI think its safe to say that The Racket is Ryan’s movie though- he seems perfectly suited to playing ruthless, hardboiled bad guys and having seen him in a few films lately, he’s really caught my attention and impressed me. Maybe the reason Mitchum seems so lazy and seemingly uncommitted in this, is that he knows that its a waste of time trying any harder, Ryan is stealing every scene- mind, to be fair, the villains always tend to steal movies, and Mitchum would play some memorable ones himself (The Night of the Hunter, for one).\n\nWell we’re back to noir and the 1947 drama Crossfire starring Robert Mitchum (Out of the Past), Robert Ryan (On Dangerous Ground) and Robert Young. Directed by Edward Dmytryk (The Sniper, Bluebeard) the film also features Gloria Grahame (It’s A Wonderful Life, In a Lonely Place, The Big Heat) in a supporting role. That’s quite a pedigree, and also so many connections to other films I’ve seen; how could it fail?\n\nWell, it can’t fail, really- as far as noir films go, this one looks utterly gorgeous, photographed by J.Roy Hunt, whose work here is simply high-art; its so beautiful (I only wish I had watched this on a Blu-ray, instead of an off-air recording). Although the script and acting are very good, its how the film looks that really struck me. Regular readers of this blog will know I’ve watched plenty of noir, particularly over the last year or so, so I’ve plenty to compare it to, and this film’s visuals compares with the best. Its moody, atmospheric and full of all sorts of creative and imaginative touches, painting with light indeed.\n\nPolice investigating the brutal death of Joseph “Sammy” Samuels (Sam Lavene) find that the evidence leads towards a group of demobilized soldiers, “Monty” Montgomery (Ryan), Arthur “Mitch” Mitchell (George Cooper), Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie), and Floyd’s friend Leroy (William Phipps) who were seen with Samuels in a bar – particularly Mitchell whose wallet is found near the body, and who has gone missing. Capt. Finlay (Young) of the police department is approached by a fifth soldier, Sergeant Keeley (Mitchum) who is convinced his friend Mitchell is incapable of murder and sets out to investigate the crime himself, and try track down Mitchell before the police do.\n\nCrossfire is a very atmospheric and gripping murder mystery telling the tale partially via seperate flashbacks of the events leading to Samuels murder, which we see in the immediate post-titles sequence but in such a way that we cannot identify the assailant. Gradually the film reveals to the audience who the murderer is and how he intends to cover up his guilt, instead pointing the blame upon Mitchell, and from that moment on it becomes a drama regards if the police or Keeley will discover the truth. The film is very good, with plenty of twists and turns, featuring some memorable characters and simply superb acting, particularly from Robert Ryan whose work resulted in him Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Gloria Grahame, whose turn as Ginny, a girl from the wrong side of the street resulted in a Best Supporting Actress nomination.\n\nThe film received five Oscar nominations in all, perhaps indicating just how well the film was regarded at the time, and its aged very well, except for when it becomes, for me, a little too preachy towards the end. That last observation really is just a personal viewpoint, films back then, as I have mentioned before concerning films of that period, had an habit of preaching messages at the audience and sometimes its just, well, a little too forced, as I thought it was here, in the form of a long monologue from one character to another but clearly intended direct to the audience: I half-expected the speaker to directly face the camera. I’m not contesting the moral point that is voiced at all, the film carries a worthy and important message that’s unfortunately as timely now as it was back then, its just that I would have preferred more subtlety, but as I say that’s a personal view and many will likely have little problem with it.\n\nOther than that, the film is pretty much perfect, and I hope a Blu-ray release arrives over here in the UK so that I can watch it again in better quality. Its funny; noir films have been well represented on Blu-ray over the past few years and its clear I’ve been rather spoiled. It just goes to further prove just how important home video releases on physical media really are for older, classic films such as this, especially HD and 4K.\n\nJeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) has spent the past three years running a gas station in the small Californian town of Bridgeport, where he dates a local girl Ann (Virginia Huston) to the disapproval of her parents and the local sheriff who is sweet on her. Its a quiet, small-town life, one broken when someone from Jeff’s past turns up in town, pulling him back into his old life and the troubles he thought he had left behind. The only person Jeff can confide in is Ann, so on a late-night drive to a rendezvous with his past, Jeff relates his story to Ann. Jeff’s real name is Jeff Markham, and he was once a private eye in New York. He was hired by gangster Whit Sterling (a charmingly threatening Kirk Douglas) to track down a woman, Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer in the definitive femme fatale role). Kathie had shot Will and left with $40,000 of his money- Will wasn’t bothered about the money though, he just wanted Kathie back; “when you see her, you’ll understand better” Will told Jeff. And when he does see her, he does understand. And at that point, he’s doomed.\n\nOut of the Past is one of the very best film noir, but deceptively so- indeed, it starts like any other 1940s melodrama, so much so you could be forgiven for thinking you’re watching the wrong movie, with bright scenery of the sierras and idyllic small-town life, complete with gentle music score. Its quite the opposite of, say, Double Indemnity, another classic noir that instead wears its noir credentials from the very first titles. Its only when Jeff relates to Ann the truth of his past that the film’s visuals turn towards the traditional nightmare dark of noir, as it relates in flashback the events that led to Jeff hiding away in Bridgeport. When we finally first see Kathie, as Jeff tracks her down to Mexico, she just looks like any beautiful woman, maybe even an innocent victim. There is a subtle ambiguity to her- when some noirs would frame her in shadows immediately revealing her true nature, Out of the Past prefers to suggest she may indeed be a victim. We have no idea, just like Jeff, that this woman will be his doom. Greer is simply astonishing as Kathie; beautiful, exuding innocence and sexiness at the same time, Kathie will do anything to survive, even fall in love, only later throwing greed and treachery into the mix.\n\nRobert Mitchum is perfectly cast as Jeff- I’m not a big fan of Mitchum, but his real-life laconic, laid-back reputation bleeds into his onscreen persona well here, ignorant of the trouble he is in, always thinking he has a way out, a trick to play, yet always falling back into the mistakes that ultimately seal his fate. When he falls for Kathie he thinks he’s in control. His over-confidence is in his eyes, his smile. At the end he realises he has no escape, his character finally reaching the stature of noir hero. What starts as a simple romantic melodrama slowly darkens into a labyrinthine plot of lies and double-crosses and deceit and murder; its fascinating to see this film turn from romantic melodrama into a completely different movie and earn its reputation as a classic film noir. Out of the Past is a very, very good movie. How strange to think I’d never seen it until now. Looks like that unwatched pile still has plenty of surprises…"
