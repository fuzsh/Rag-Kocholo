Soon, however, he becomes embroiled in a battle with gangsters and federal agents.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz\n\nDespite its crude production values, Thunder Road was effectively made. It was based on a story by Mitchum, who also served as the executive producer. In addition, he cowrote and recorded a song for the soundtrack, entitled “Whippoorwill,” that was a surprise hit. In an interesting casting decision, Mitchum’s 16-year-old son, James, played his brother. The popularity of the movie was especially noted at drive-in theatres, where the movie continued to be played for years after its release."
