His father died in railroad accident before Mitchum's second birthday and it's perhaps that lack of authoritative father figure that caused him to be difficult and unruly in his youth. As a child, Mitchum preferred roughhousing to schoolwork, forcing his mother to send him to live with his grandparents in Delaware. He was immediately expelled from school for fighting. In 1930 Mitchum went to New York to live with his sister, following his habitual pattern of was immediate school expulsion. Soon after, he traveled the county using his preferred method of freight train hopping. He took several odd jobs, including professional boxer. At the age of 14, he was put on a chain-gang for vagrancy. According to Mitchum himself, he then escaped the chain gang and hoped a train back to Delaware but soon after found himself back on the railroads. In 1936, he made his way to California, living with his sister in Long Beach.\n\nEarly Acting Career\n\nWhile in Long Beach, Mitchum joined the local theatre guide at his sister's behest.

At the start of the decade, Mitchum did mostly extra work but in 1942, he found steady work as the villain is a series of b-move westerns. He appeared inn over 25 films between 1942 and 1944. He finally got shot to play the hero in opposite Spencer Tracy and Van Johnson in the Melvyn LeRoy war drama Thirty Seconds Over Toyko. RKO then signed Mitchum to seven-year contract, where he continued to star in B-Westerns.\n\nBig Break, Film Noir, and Arrest\n\nIn 1945, Mitchum was loaned to United Artist for the William Wellman film The Story of G.I Joe.
