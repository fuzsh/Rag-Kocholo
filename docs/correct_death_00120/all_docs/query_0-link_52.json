        "text": "What is Robert Mitchum's Net Worth?\n\nRobert Mitchum was an American actor who had a net worth of $10 million dollars. Born August 6, 1917 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, he was one of the most memorable leading men of the 20th century. A legendary tough guy on and off-screen, Mitchum was associated with post-war film noir (stylish Hollywood film dramas) during the '50s and '60s. He will most likely be best remembered for his roles in such films as The Story of G.I. Joe (1945), Crossfire (1947), Out of the Past (1947), The Night of the Hunter (1955), and Cape Fear (1962). Mitchum arrived in Long Beach, California in 1936 and stayed with his sister Julie who convinced him to join the local theater guild along with her. In his years with the Players Guild of Long Beach, he made a living as a stagehand and occasional bit-player in company productions and even wrote several short pieces which were performed by the guild."
