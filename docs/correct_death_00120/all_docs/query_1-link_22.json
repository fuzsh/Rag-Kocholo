        "text": "The Chris Mitchum Interview, Part Five [Conclusion]\n\nCompared to your father Robert, little is known about his brother, Dirty Harry character actor John Mitchum. What was your relationship like with your uncle?\n\nUncle John was almost like a second father to me. He was a wonderful, very talented person. My dad explained to me that after he had hoboed for a year or two — incredibly starting at the age of 14 — he went back and picked up my uncle. They went on the rails together.\n\nHe said that John had a knack for picking up accents. They might land in Savannah, Georgia. If the railroad bulls caught them, my uncle would immediately start talking in the local dialect. They thought he was a local kid [laughs]. That way they wouldn’t get him for vagrancy and throw him in jail.\n\nAnother little hobby my uncle had — he always loved music and had taught himself to play guitar. He had a Burl Ives style of singing. He would dig out the local folk songs. God knows how many thousands of songs he knew from all over the country. It was considerable."
