        "text": "Robert Mitchum was a prolific American actor who appeared in over 110 films and TV series over the course of his career. Best remembered for his roles in several classic films noir, he is rated No. 23 on the American Film Institute's list of the 50 greatest American screen legends of all time. He ventured into Hollywood as an extra in movies, playing minor and supporting roles. Eventually he forayed into the genre of film noir with a supporting role in the B-film ‘When Strangers Marry’ and it did not take him much long to establish himself as one of the major actors in the genre. After being cast as Lt. Walker in ‘Story of G.I. Joe’, his popularity began to soar and he became a much sought after actor in Hollywood. A troublemaker from a young age, he was a tough guy both on and off the screen. His “Bad Boy” image lent him a sense of mystery and made him even more appealing to the audiences. Interestingly, his troubles with the law did not affect him negatively—in fact, they made him even more famous! He was once arrested for possession of marijuana and spent a week at the county jail. The movies released soon after his arrest ended up being big box office hits. In addition to being an actor he was also a moderately successful singer and composer"
