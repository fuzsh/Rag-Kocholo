A self-proclaimed graduate of the I-Just-Show-Up-and-Read-My-Lines School of Acting, Mitchum presents the media and his devotees with a portrait of himself as a no-nonsense underachiever who lucked into his career. For a man whose first minor break come when he volunteered to ride a horse that had just killed another bit player, the truth about his casual attitude might be complex enough for the kind of treatment Kurosawa gave Rashomon.\n\nBrimming with the sort of he-man sexuality that swept away women's better judgment, Mitchum might have been stuck playing muscle-bound rascals if he had come to prominence sooner, but his ascendancy coincided with the postwar turmoil encapsulated in film noir. A man of few words, all of them packed with dynamite, the terse Mitchum was a minimalist actor; since he did not call attention to himself with Oscar-grabbing flourishes, his economical methods make his cleanly delivered performances seem all the more modern today. Winning his first and only Oscar nomination for The Story of G.I. Joe, Mitchum always had the luxury of alternating hero and villain roles as he effortlessly changed his wardrobe from leather chaps to soldier fatigue to P.I. trench coat, with an innate fashion sense of what the well-dressed antihero wore. Never letting up with his official line about not taking his career seriously, Mitchum outlasted his more highly regarded contemporaries until he was the last Golden Age male superstar still billed above the title.\n\nAt the time when he was RKO's resident screwed-over everyman, his notorious drug bust actually enhanced his reputation by jazzing up his social outlaw image. Ingrid Bergman, Tom Neal, Rory Calhoun and many others were not so fortunate in an era when Confidential magazine began invading stars' homes to look for skeletons in their closets.\n\nPerpetuating his persona as a frontiersman with a past (Rachel and the Stranger, Blood on the Moon), Mitchum brought an equally haunted quality to bear on RKO's other genre staple, the fatalistic urban thriller in which Mitchum hinted that resignation to corruption was often an antihero's only recourse. If Out of the Past engraves the tough, soul-sick Mitchum image in stone, his other RKO standouts hint at something more sinister than entrapment in a cycle of crime. What is endlessly fascinating about movies such as Angel Face, The Locket, Where Danger Lives, and My Foolish Past is that the solidly built male star at the center of these whirlpools is primarily a fall guy for women. In the provocative Angel Face, Mitchum is the heterosexual's worst nightmare, a man of action turned impotent by a controlling beauty. Less perilously paired with Jane Russell in a series of robust adventures, Mitchum's lighter side received a workout, but he continued adding to his star luster with straightforward leading-man roles opposite Deborah Kerr, Marilyn Monroe, and others, in exciting romantic films that explored his good-natured skepticism while exercising his broad appeal to men and women.\n\nIn the course of easing into his own played-down legend, Mitchum broadened his range with subtle turns in sophisticated misfires such as Secret Ceremony, singlehandedly salvaged the epic Ryan's Daughter with his quiet authority, and brought heartbreaking purity to bear on his portrayal of an Australian sheep farmer cursed with wanderlust but blessed with Deborah Kerr in The Sundowners.\n\nKnocking the socks off even his admirers, Mitchum also made chilled-to-the-marrow moviegoers shudder with his interpretations of rotten villains in Cape Fear and The Night of the Hunter. The former is a taut psycho-thriller about a sadist conversant with legal technicalities; Mitchum fashions a stalker monster clearly ahead of his time—an achievement all the more impressive since critics-darling Robert De Niro failed to outdo Mitchum in the dreadful Scorcese remake. Even finer is Mitchum's venal bible-thumper in The Night of the Hunter, Charles Laughton's expressionist fairy tale now regarded as a horror classic. If these two performances do not clinch the argument that Mitchum is a great screen actor then the definition of great screen acting needs to be modified.\n\nLate in his career, Mitchum's seen-it-all wariness and offhanded gallantry redefined forties detective iconography for contemporary times with Farewell, My Lovely. In a fitting career capstone, the miniseries The Winds of War and War and Remembrance consolidated Mitchum's position as one of Hollywood's durable icons. It is fortunate that Mitchum endured to receive accolades for a body of work that he consistently undervalued. Somewhere behind those heavy-lidded eyes and are-you-kidding exterior, Mitchum have felt secretly vindicated. Although filmgoers have enjoyed this late bloomer's laconic presence for years, the critical and popular consensus has finally caught up with Mitchum's greatness as a screen star.\n\n—Robert Pardi"
