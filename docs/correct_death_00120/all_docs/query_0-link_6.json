        "text": "(ran PT)\n\nStrong and sexy, the surprising Robert Mitchum has become with age even more of what he always was: a tough-guy superstar with a deadpan demeanor, bedroom eyes and a wicked sense of humor.\n\nRecently hitting age 75 has not diminished his appeal one iota; he's grander, funnier and more outrageous than ever. Instead of getting older, as the saying goes, he's gotten better.\n\n\"I have played everything,\" Mitchum admits, \"midgets, women, anything! The first picture I worked on at RKO I was in drag! (The Girl Rush, 1944). Every time I encounter one of those impossible egos in our business I simply say that one of the greatest movie stars that ever lived was Rin Tin Tin, an old spayed hound most of the time.\"\n\nTalking in his comfortable Santa Barbara home beside his wife of more than 50 years, the lovely Dorothy Mitchum, the actor says he never considered himself handsome.\n\n\"I came into being during the era of the ugly leading man started by Bogart just after World War II. Then, if you didn't look like Tyrone Power, you didn't work. Then Bogart and a few others came along, altered the picture and I slipped in.\n\n\"They used to say to me, \"Did you ever think about getting your nose fixed?' I'd say, \"I had it fixed three or four times _ by a straight left!\"' Mitchum once tried his luck as a boxer.\n\nPerceived as a rebel and one of Hollywood's original bad boys, Mitchum shrugs, \"I don't know what a rebel is. I don't think I've been late on the set once in over a hundred pictures!\" (The actual count is 130.)\n\nHe dismisses his 1948 marijuana arrest, for which he served time at a California honor farm, as tame by today's standards. But he likes to repeat what he told reporters upon his release: \"Jail is like Palm Springs without the riffraff. A great place to get in shape, only you meet a better class of people.\"\n\nUnderneath Mitchum's tough-guy stance is a rather withdrawn, emotional man. He's wary of strangers, terse with his answers. Ask about his immediate plans and he says, \"Lunch.\" Ask why he and his wife were invited to President Reagan's White House and he answers, \"Dinner.\"\n\nDon't be fooled. Robert Mitchum is a very surprising man. He's a poet, playwright and composer. He wrote the text for an oratorio produced by Orson Welles at the Hollywood Bowl. He wrote all the songs for his two albums, \"Calypso I Like So,\" produced in 1957 by Capitol, and \"The Ballad of Thunder Road,\" issued in 1958 by RCA. Both made the charts.\n\nIn 1960, he was named best actor by the National Board of Review for his work in The Sundowners, and in 1983 he received the third annual Life Achievement Award of the American Theatre Arts.\n\nAs his friend and former co-star Deborah Kerr observes, \"He is a far more complex person than his lazy, relaxed manner would have you believe, a man who hides many lights under many bushels.\"\n\nBorn in Bridgeport, Conn., in 1917, Mitchum was only 18 months old when his father, James Mitchum, a railroad worker, was killed in a switchyard accident. His Norwegian-born mother, Ann, worked to support her three children until she remarried when Mitchum was about 10.\n\nShe noted that her first-born was a natural leader, but always a loner, and once remarked, \"Robert doesn't have any friends, he has disciples.\"\n\nActually, he has close friends, most of them women. \"I like women,\" he says. \"I'm more at ease with them, enjoy their company more.\" But reminded that all of his leading ladies wanted to act with him again, he has a flip response: \"I guess they just wanted to work.\"\n\nOne of his close male friends is Ol' Blue Eyes, Frank Sinatra. Mitchum tells a story about Sinatra when the two were making Not as a Stranger in 1955.\n\n\"Frank had gone to a premiere one night, and when I came to work in the morning I found him lying there in full dinner dress.\n\n\"I went to the fridge and got vodka and tomato juice and some Worcestershire, and because it was a hospital set, I got one of those feeding tubes, which I put in the corner of his mouth. Frank drank half the mixture, opened his eyes and said \"Mother!' To this day he sends me Mother's Day cards.\"\n\nWhile it may seem at times that Robert Mitchum walks through his roles, he cares deeply about his work and once acknowledged that he was \"obsessed with the phantom of failure.\"\n\nNow, Mitchum confesses, it's a fear that never leaves. \"Well, of course! It's an ingredient of self-preservation,\" he says. \"It's what keeps you striving. It's your ace in the hole.\""
