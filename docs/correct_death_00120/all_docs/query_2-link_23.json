        "text": "Robert Mitchum was an American actor.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBorn in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Mitchum first began to act with the Players Guild of Long Beach and worked as a writer before becoming a screen actor with a number of early roles in westerns. He soon appeared in The Story of G.I. Joe, gaining an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and would make a number of ventures into film noir before playing two of his most popular roles, Reverend Harry Powell in The Night of the Hunter and Max Cady in Cape Fear.\n\nThough known for playing sinister characters, Mitchum received plaudits for his sympathetic role in Ryan's Daughter, and the hard-bitten detective Philip Marlowe in Farewell, My Lovely. Towards the end of his career, Mitchum continued to be succesful, but mostly focused on television work. He passed away in 1997.\n\nSinging[]\n\nMitchum sang a number of times during his screen career, and in addition had a number successful album releases. He generally sang brief snippets of songs, though he also performed some duets, such as \"Streets of Laredo\" in Pursued and \"Botany Bay\" in The Sundowners with Deborah Kerr, Peter Ustinov and Glynis Johns.\n\nMitchum released two albums, Calypso... is like so and That Man Robert Mitchum... Sings, and the music he performed in these albums were used in several films even after his death.\n\nFilm[]\n\nThe Human Comedy (1943)[]\n\nThe Last Round-Up (Git Along, Little Dogie, Git Along)\n\nTil the End of Time (1946)[]\n\n(I Got Spurs) Jingle Jangle Jingle (solo)\n\nPursued (1947)[]\n\nDanny Boy (duet)\n\nStreets of Laredo (solo)\n\nRiver of No Return (1954)[]\n\nRiver of No Return (solo)\n\nThe Night of the Hunter (1955)[]\n\nLeaning on the Everlasting Arms (solo)\n\nThe Sundowners (1960)[]\n\nThe Wild Colonial Boy (solo)\n\nMoreton Bay (solo)\n\nBotany Bay\n\nYoung Billy Young (1969)[]\n\nYoung Billy Young (solo)\n\nJake Spanner, Private Eye (1989)[]\n\nDance in the Old Fashioned Way (solo)\n\nAlbums[]\n\nCalypso... is like so (1957)[]\n\nJean And Dinah (solo)\n\nFrom A Logical Point Of View (solo)\n\nNot Me (solo)\n\nWhat Is This Generation Coming To?
