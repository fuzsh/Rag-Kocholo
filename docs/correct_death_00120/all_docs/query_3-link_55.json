        "text": "Arthur Hunnicutt (left) with Ross Bagdasarian, the creator of Alvin and the Chipmunks\n\nALMOST EVERY MORNING, I sit at my nicked and scarred oak dinette table, sipping English breakfast tea while scanning the daily newspaper. What’s significant here is not that I have a morning ritual or that I’m reading an actual paper newspaper, but the table where this takes place. I call this vintage piece of furniture, which wouldn’t look out of place in a farmhouse kitchen, my storyteller table—as in, “if this table could talk, the stories it would tell.”\n\nIf the slab of wood could talk, it would most likely tell tales of my most famous family member, Arthur Lee Hunnicutt, who was an honest-to-goodness movie star. OK, not really a star like his friend John Wayne (that’s right, the Duke), but still a highly regarded and Oscar-nominated character actor."
