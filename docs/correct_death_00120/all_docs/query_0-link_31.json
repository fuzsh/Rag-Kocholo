        "text": "American actor; politician\n\nChristopher Mitchum (born October 16, 1943) is an American film actor, screenwriter, and businessman. He was born in Los Angeles, California, the second son of film star Robert Mitchum[1] and Dorothy Mitchum. He is the younger brother of actor James Mitchum.\n\nFilm career[edit]\n\nMitchum appeared in more than 60 films in 14 countries. He appeared with John Wayne[1] in the motion pictures Chisum (1970), Rio Lobo (1970), and Big Jake (1971). He was cited by Box Office magazine as one of the top five stars of the future and the recipient of Photoplay's Gold Medal Award for 1972. He won both The Golden Horse Award (1981) and The Golden Reel, Best Actor award (1988, Indonesia). He has been a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1978. He was the Screen Actors Guild national first vice president, in 1987–89 and a member of the SAG board of directors, in 1983–89.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nMitchum married Cynthia \"Cindy\" Davis in 1964. Together, they had children Bentley, Carrie, Jennifer, and Kian before divorcing in 1996. For four years in the 1990s, Mitchum was father-in-law to Carrie's husband, Casper Van Dien. Mitchum is the grandfather of Cappy Van Dien, Grace Van Dien, Allexanne Mitchum, Carrington Mitchum, and Wyatt Mitchum Cardone.\n\nMitchum has resided in the Santa Barbara, California area (Central Coast) since 1984. He ran unsuccessfully for the California State Assembly in 1998 and the U.S. House of Representatives, 24th Congressional District, in 2012 and 2014.\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\nState and federal office candidacies[edit]\n\nMitchum has run once for the California State Assembly (35th District), and twice for the U.S. House of Representatives (California's 24th District). Since January 1, 2011, under California law, candidates are voter-nominated for state and federal offices; political parties cannot nominate candidates for office.[2]\n\nCalifornia Assembly[edit]\n\nIn 1998, Mitchum was the Republican nominee in the general election for the California State Assembly in the 35th district, which included portions of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, where he served on the Republican Central Committee (1998–2000). His opponents were Democrat Hannah-Beth Jackson and Natural Law Party candidate Eric Dahl. Mitchum came in second behind Jackson with 44.5 percent of the vote to Jackson's 53 percent.\n\nU.S. Congress[edit]\n\nIn 2012, Mitchum ran for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican candidate in California's 24th district (San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and part of Ventura counties), challenging incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Lois Capps.[3] In the June 5, 2012 primary, he came in third, behind Republican Abel Maldonado and Capps, and ahead of Independent candidate Matt Boutté.\n\nIn 2014, Mitchum ran again for the U.S. congressional seat held by Representative Capps. He won the June 3, 2014, primary (running alongside four other Republicans, two additional Democrats, and an Independent candidate), coming in second behind Capps with 15.8 percent of the vote, and narrowly defeating Republican Justin Fareed by slightly over 600 votes.[4] In the November 4 general election, Mitchum received 48.1 percent of the vote to Capps's 51.9 percent, in the closest race of Capps's entire congressional career.[5][6]\n\nDespite the close margin by which Mitchum lost to Capps, as well as the announcement that Capps would retire in 2016, Mitchum ultimately declined a third run for the same seat again, and instead endorsed Assemblyman Katcho Achadjian for the race to succeed Capps.[7]\n\nElection statistics[edit]\n\nCalifornia State Assembly, 35th District: 1998 Party Candidate Votes % Invalid or blank votes 7,602 5.66 Total votes 135,359 100.00\n\nU.S. House of Representatives, California, 24th District: 2012 Primary election Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 156,087 100.0 General election Total votes 284,495 100.0\n\nU.S. House of Representatives, California, 24th District: 2014 Primary election Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 133,263 100.0 General election Total votes 198,794 100.0\n\nPhilanthropic positions[edit]\n\nMitchum has served on several organizations'boards of directors and has been a fundraiser for a number of charities.\n\nHollywood Benefit Horse Show, advisory board, 1996–present\n\nZONA SECA, Board of Director, 2011–present\n\nCommunity Outreach for Prevention and Education chairman and honorary chairman, 1998–present\n\nLiberty Program—gang-member rehabilitation program—board member, Santa Barbara, 1999–2001\n\nCriminal Advisory Board for Fighting Back, Santa Barbara, 1999–2004\n\nPublic Policy Advisory Board for Fighting Back, Santa Barbara, 1999–2004\n\nBoard of directors, Police Activities League, Santa Barbara, 1999–2001\n\nJuvenile Justice & Delinquency Prevention Commission, chairman, for the governor's Office, State of California, OCJP January 1999\n\nAutistic Treatment Center \"Roundup of Autism\": Honorary Advisory Council: 1994–2002\n\nNorth American Riding for the Handicapped Association Advisory Board: 1992–96\n\nSanta Barbara International Film Festival: Honorary Board 1988–92\n\nSanta Barbara International Film Festival, board of directors: one-year term, 1987\n\nSanta Barbara Civic Light Opera: founding chairman of the \"Star Circle\" fund-raiser, 1989\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
