        "text": "Robert Mitchum, the insouciant actor whose heavy-lidded eyes gazed on the world with cynical amusement as he radiated rugged strength in more than 100 movies, died in his sleep yesterday at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 79.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that he had been suffering from emphysema for more than a year and was told in the spring that he had lung cancer.\n\nThroughout his long career, Mr. Mitchum pretended to regard his profession casually, repeatedly remarking in his droning baritone, ''It sure beats working.'' But associates respected him as one of the most talented and dedicated people in their profession, a no-nonsense craftsman who was always punctual, word perfect in his lines and a battler for making his movies better.\n\nHe appeared in war movies, westerns and films noir. He was a villain in Hopalong Cassidy movies; he portrayed heroic G.I.'s and battle-weary officers, flinty private eyes and homicidal killers.\n\n''I think when producers have a part that's hard to cast, they say, 'Send for Mitchum; he'll do anything,' '' he once remarked. ''I don't care what I play. I'll play Polish gays, women, midgets, anything.''\n\nOff the screen in his early years, he accumulated a reputation as a bad boy, a ladies' man and outlaw who shocked naive movie fans in the 1940's when he was arrested on a marijuana charge at the home of a starlet.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
