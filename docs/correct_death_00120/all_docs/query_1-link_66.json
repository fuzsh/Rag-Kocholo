        "text": "Blonde-haired heartthrob Christopher “Chris” Mitchum dreamed of being a writer. Obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in Literature degree from the University of Pennsylvania, the second son of disturbing Cape Fear antagonist Robert Mitchum transferred to the University of Arizona and picked up gigs as a day extra in TV westerns filmed at the Old Tucson Studios. Then the acting bug bit. Three back to back John Wayne westerns — Chisum [1970], Rio Lobo, and Big Jake — should have been a blessing. Insisting that he was “blackballed by Hollywood liberals,” action hero parts in schlocky foreign flicks kept Mitchum’s name on marquees through the ‘80s.\n\nIn the fourth chapter of an eyebrow-raising exclusive interview — “‘John Wayne Built My Career:’ Durango Prop Guys and Pistoleros” was the preceding installment — the two-time U.S. House of Representatives candidate unashamedly details the Duke’s conservative red state politics and critical disdain for The Green Berets in spite of racial injustice protesters urging that John Wayne Airport in Orange County be renamed. Further anecdotes abound about unprofessional, dangerous film sets in China and the Philippines, martial arts, and whether The Wild Bunch and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid singlehandedly destroyed the Western genre.\n\nThe Chris Mitchum Interview, Part Four"
