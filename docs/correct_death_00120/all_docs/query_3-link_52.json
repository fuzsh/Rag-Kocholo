        "text": "From Lillian Gish's 1969 autobiography, The Movies, Mr. Griffith and Me, on the subject of the 1955 film The Night of the Hunter: \"I played in the movie, which was about the battle between good and evil. Parts of the film were excellent, but it was not fully sustained because Mr. Laughton [Charles Laughton, in his sole effort as a director] did not want to 'ruin' Robert Mitchum's image by having him play a thoroughly wicked man. In the earlier days of films, it would have been considered a triumph to play evil convincingly.\"\n\nI'm quoting this not to mock an elderly actress's rather astonishing opinion. I'm instead quoting it to point out the late Robert Mitchum's peculiar gift of making absolute evil look like glittering charm. There's a scene in The Night of the Hunter in which Gish holds Mitchum's Judas priest Harry Powell at bay in her yard.\n\nGish sits on her porch on her rocking chair all night, shotgun across her lap, watching the preacher sitting on tree stump as he sings \"Bringing in the Sheaves.\" Trusting Powell as you would trust a fanged adder, she still can't help harmonizing with him, singing 'bringing, bringing, bringing in the sheaves,' as she rocks and holds her shotgun and watches him all through the night.\n\nMitchum made a lot of movies, and most of them weren't any good. He knew it and made sure you knew it, too. The reptilian bask-and-drowse look could, at worst, be a smirk. (\"Movies bore me. Especially my own.\") A 1975 biography of Mitchum was titled It Sure Beats Working. And why would he care? As critic David Thomson wrote, \"The more praise Mitchum got, the less interesting he became.\"\n\nHis best work didn't make money. He was cool-blooded enough about his marvelous voice not only to record that famous calypso record but also to not mind too terribly much being mocked about that record decades later by David Letterman.\n\nEverybody knows he used to like to smoke a little weed. He liked to write poetry, too, just like Stewart, but he didn't publish his. I read one Mitchum poem excerpted in an interview in Penthouse 20 years ago, and it was almost indistinguishable from a Jimmy Stewart poem. It was about a boy all alone reading a book and fishing in a brook.\n\nAnd like Stewart, I don't think Mitchum considered himself a very complex man. Mitchum had that mysterious gift of a presence. Those who have this presence to the degree Mitchum had it rarely question the gift. As the baseball slang has it, You don't want to get caught looking.\n\nMitchum was best in the aristocratic noir film Out of the Past; and in two pictures that would make a natural double bill, if only they weren't too blood-curdling to watch in tandem: The Night of the Hunter and Cape Fear, in which he played superhuman killer Max Cady. That 1962 thriller (remade by Martin Scorsese, with a cameo by Mitchum) was the first version of the yarn that goes \"I'm sorry, we police can do nothing about that homicidal maniac stalking your family. We are handcuffed by those liberal courts.\"\n\nThe two roles and the two films are similarly situated. Cady and Powell are two alligators who never get far from the river; and Walter Schumann, composer of the \"Dragnet Theme,\" did the bombastic theme for Powell, which was mirrored in Bernard Herrmann's thundering music for Cape Fear.\n\nThe Night of the Hunter was a resounding flop--what would someone from the 1950s think, if we could talk to them from our place in the future, about which American movies of their era we consider the greatest? Night of the Hunter, Vertigo and Touch of Evil, a few Nicholas Ray movies--hardly any Rock Hudson, little Robert or Elizabeth Taylor, certainly not The Robe or Ben Hur, only a handful of those dozens of sub-J.B. Priestly dramas about uneasy WASPS that represented prestige in the era of Ike.\n\nWatching The Night of the Hunter now, I am puzzled at how it could have been made at all. No censor excised the leap of the blade of a switchblade out of Powell's pocket--a pants-bursting erection--as the sexually twisted preacher watches a burlesque show; no executive overrode the climax: the vanishing and reappearance of Powell, the pull of the trigger, Mitchum's war whoop as he bounds into the night like Satan before a cross.\n\nPerhaps in Gish's opinion, if evil were portrayed \"realistically,\" you wouldn't be interested in singing along. Still, our imagining of evil, of knowing its tune, comes partially from watching Mitchum's gimlet eyes and from hearing that buttery voice.\n\nOf the other moth-faced and scarred devils that I've daydreamed about--Karloff, Christopher Lee's Dracula, Henry Fonda in Once Upon a Time in the West, Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth, my childhood terror Blofeld (who would detonate atom bombs for money), the scientists who kill for knowledge, the bad cops and worst robbers, the megalomaniacs and fascists, the rapists and murderers--none was as frightening as that country preacher with \"love\" and \"hate\" tattooed on his massive knuckles.\n\nRest in peace. Be seeing you both."
