        "text": "Hollywood tough guy Robert Mitchum made a career of playing insouciant fatalists and unscrupulous rogues, especially in noir films of the 1950s.\n\nHe was in the movies for more than five decades, breaking out early on with an Oscar-nominated supporting performance in 1945’s The Story of G.I. Joe. Mitchum was a lovable bad boy on screen and off, and even 50 days in jail for marijuana possession (1948) didn’t slow his rise to stardom.\n\nThese days he’s best remembered for Out of the Past (1949), The Big Steal (1949), The Night of the Hunter (1955, written by James Agee) and Cape Fear (1961, starring Gregory Peck). A familiar face in crime dramas, westerns and war movies, Mitchum’s films include The Longest Day (1962), El Dorado (1967, with John Wayne), The Friends of Eddie Coyle (1973) and, as Philip Marlowe, Farewell, My Lovely (1975) and The Big Sleep (1978)."
