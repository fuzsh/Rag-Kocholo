        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- Robert Mitchum, the gruff, sleepy-eyed actor who played tough guys, cynics and all-around hard cases in such movies as \"Night of the Hunter,\" \"Cape Fear\" and \"Thunder Road,\" died at his home yesterday at 79.\n\nThe brawny, granite-faced Mitchum, who suffered from emphysema and lung cancer, appeared in more than 100 Westerns, comedies, war movies and dramas, remaining a star for over half a century and working well into his 70s.\n\n\"I think when producers have a part that's hard to cast, they say, 'Send for Mitchum. He'll do anything,'\" Mitchum once said, adding, \"I don't care what I play. I'll play Polish gays, women, midgets, anything.\"\n\nFilmmakers realized they could rely on Mitchum for powerful performances. He proved this in such movies as \"River of No Return\" with Marilyn Monroe, \"The Sundowners,\" \"Crossfire,\" \"Ryan's Daughter\" and \"The Way West.\"\n\n\"He was a wonderful actor to work with. He never made a mistake, he was always on time, very patient, and just a damn good actor,\" said Jane Russell, his co-star in \"Macao\" and \"His Kind of Woman.\"\n\n\"He had a hell-raising image, but it was tremendous to work with him. He was a very charming man with a great wit,\" said Edward Fox, who starred with Mitchum in \"The Big Sleep.\"\n\nMitchum's last picture, \"James Dean Race with Destiny,\" is scheduled for release Sept. 30. It also stars his granddaughter Carrie Mitchum.\n\nRobert Charles Duran Mitchum was born in Bridgeport, Conn. His mother was a Norwegian immigrant, his father a soldier and barroom brawler who was part Scottish-Irish, part Blackfoot Indian.\n\nAfter World War I, Mitchum's father took the family to South Carolina, where he worked in the Charleston Navy Yard. He was crushed between two freight cars in 1919. At 16, Mitchum took to the road, riding the rails to California.\n\nMitchum claimed to have worked as a coal miner, deckhand, ditch digger and professional boxer, lasting 27 fights. He said he was arrested for vagrancy in Savannah, Ga., and worked on a chain gang, escaping after six days.\n\nIn 1937, Mitchum joined his family in Long Beach and became involved in local theater at the urging of his sister.\n\nMitchum was cast in eight Hopalong Cassidy Westerns. In 1943 he began appearing in war movies. He played a crewman in \"Thirty Seconds over Tokyo.\"\n\n\"The Story of G.I. Joe\" was his ticket to stardom. As the valiant Lt. Walker in the movie about Ernie Pyle's war stories, he was nominated for an Oscar as supporting actor.\n\nHis stone face and gruff manner fit perfectly in the public's taste for rugged heroes in contrast to the pretty-boys of the 1930s.\n\n\"After the war, suddenly there was this thing for ugly heroes, so I started going around in profile,\" he remarked. He also gained a reputation as a world-class boozer and a ladies' man.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 56 years, Dorothy; his actor sons, James and Christopher; daughter Petrine; five grandchildren and one step-grandchild.\n\nThe funeral will be private, and Mitchum's ashes will be scattered at sea."
