        "text": "Best Italian Omelet\n\nMonterey Street Café, 1885 Monterey St., SLO\n\nFluffy eggs, big chunks of spicy Italian sausage, roughly diced bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms, and plenty of cheese and marinara saucein the right combination these ingredients form the perfect Italian omelet, perhaps the most delicious breakfast invented by man! If you scour the county, sampling them all, the best one youll find is at Monterey Street Café. Warning: not for the weak-stomached!\n\nBest Beer Garden\n\nGuss Grocery, 1638 Osos St., SLO\n\nGot an afternoon to blow? Head over to Guss Grocery, buy a beer out of the coolernot at bar but at convenience store pricesand hit the sunny patio for camaraderie and conversation. Guss is the only place in SLO with a help-yourself beer garden, and its a favorite hangout of downtown dwellers from the surrounding neighborhoods. Youll always find plenty of bikes parked out front and folks vying for space under the big green umbrellas. Ah, this is the life!\n\nBest Arts Superhero\n\nJeffrey Emrick of the American Institute of Architects\n\n1998 Santa Barbara St., SLO\n\nAs Mardi Gras grappled with the city, another festival was struggling as well. I Madonnari, the Italian Street Painting Festival that turns Mission Plaza into something like the tiles in Will Wonkas bathroom, was searching for a leader after long-time liaison Kathy Friend stepped down last year. After many rumors swirled about who, if anybody, could take over the daunting task, a ray of hope broke through the thunderheads.\n\nIn stormed the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Central Coast Chapter and their president, Jeffrey Emrick. With a brightly chalked cape flowing behind, Emrickman and his fellow superheroes at the AIA took on the duties of organizing the festival locally, now slated for sometime in the fall, for the Santa Barbara-based Childrens Creative Project.\n\nThe fundraising event will go on as planned and the kids will get the arts programs provided by CCP. All is right with the world again.\n\nBest Place to Spend So Much Time Browsing You Upset Your Girlfriend\n\nInsomniac Video/Stuff-O-Rama\n\n2161 A Broad St., SLO\n\nIf you want to know why Insomniac Video has survived while all other mom-n-pop video shops have been eaten alive by Hollywood Video and Blockbuster, try going into one of those big chain rental store and asking for \"Faster Pussycat Kill Kill!\" or \"Master of the Flying Guillotine.\" Ask them to direct you to their Speedsploitation or Cannibalism sections.\n\nYou can walk into Insomniac Video, turn to the helpful clerk and say, \"Im in the mood for a car chase-type flick, but not a recent one. And, if it features Robert Mitchum, all the better.\"\n\nTheyll say, \"You should try Thunder Road, which also features a song by Mitchum.\"\n\nThese guys know so much about movies, youll curse your film history teacher for short-changing you.\n\nYou can also meander through Stuff-O-Rama, which is your one-stop shop for lounge kitsch. You can get a Hula girl for your dash, a Bettie Page doll for your shelf, and a leopard-print pillow for your couch. They also feature a selection of books you may feel simultaneously compelled and strangely embarrassed to flip through.\n\nBest Mexican Food that Should\n\nWin Best Mexican Food, but Never Does Tacos de Mexico\n\n374 Santa Rosa Street\n\nSan Luis Obispo\n\nIts too bad Tacos de Mexico isnt better known so it can get the accolades it deserves. But maybe thats good for the rest of us who dont want to stand in a longer lineso if youve never experienced this place, stop reading right now and go have a seven-layer something at Taco Bell.\n\nCuriously, this small, authentic Mexican restaurant is right across the street from Mexicorporate Taco Bell on Santa Rosa Street near Highway 101. Tacos de Mexico occupies the old A&W Root Beer stand, so its got sheltered parking out front where car hops used to zip over to take your order. Look fast, or youll zip right on by.\n\nThe food is simple, honest, and tasty, and matches the authentic flavors of Mexico better than any restaurant in San Luis. The hot sauce is especially good, with a tangy extra something that compels you to have another bite and then another until its all gone and you want another.\n\nTacos de Mexico deserves to win. Its customers would agree, but they selfishly (and understandably) hope it wont. The lines too long already.\n\nBest Bloomin Project\n\nThe San Luis Obispo Botanical Garden\n\nEl Chorro Regional Park\n\nHighway 1\n\nSanta Barbaras botanical garden is well-knownbut if the one here in SLO County thats taking seed right now out on Highway 1 ever reaches its full dimension, Santa Barbaras might find itself scrabbling for visitors.\n\nThe San Luis Obispo Botanical Garden is taking shape right now in a 1-acre preview garden that eventually will become the entry to the 150 acre garden, showcasing plants from the worlds five Mediterranean climatesCalifornia, Chile, South Africa, Australia, and the Mediterranean Basin.\n\nThis is a terrific long-term project with an award-winning master planwhich you really need to see to understand the full scale and direction of the garden. But not enough people know about it. This is not good. More people need to help out. The garden needs more seed money, if you will.\n\nSo heres what you should do.\n\nDrive out and see it for yourself. Walk around the preview garden, talk to people, check out the master plan, be amazed at whats in the works, and resolve to help make the San Luis Obispo Botanical Gardens dream of the future a reality.\n\nThen become a member/contributor. Call them at 546-3501 to find out more. Theyve got a 24-hour information line and voice mail. You can make your tax deductible contribution to the San Luis Obispo Botanical Garden and send it to Box 4957, SLO 93403. Or check out their Web site at www.slobg.org.\n\nThen tell Cal-Trans to quit stalling and let them have a sign on Highway 1 so you can more easily find them.\n\nBest Reason to Leave SLO County\n\nIt costs too damn much.\n\nTheres not a whole lot to say other than that. Not a single other reason comes to mind to explain why anyone would want to leave this Paradise by the Sea other than that pretty soon youll get tossed from your apartment and have to bum spare change outside the 7-11 store and wonder if you really should buy something to eat like you told all those nice people whove given you money, or instead go buy a bottle of cheap Nebraska wine at Trader Joes and get totally looped so youll forget how great things were before the rest of the world showed up to price you out of your apartment, and maybe you should just get totally looped and forget how great things were before you got arrested for being drunk, then thrown in jail where you cant even do that, but at least now youve got a place to sleep.\n\nBest Place to End a Speed Chase With the Police After Stabbing Your Neighbor\n\nPismo Beach\n\nPerhaps it is true that felons generally have flawed logic, thus believing they can get away with whatever crime they are pursuing, but David Carey, 31, of Orcutt took the cake this year. On Feb. 20, after stabbing his neighbor and then fleeing the scene, he led the Pismo Beach Police Department on a high-speed chase that led through the town and ended up at the beach, where he drove his truck into the sand and then ran into the ocean. Carey held the officers at bay for a time while wading hip deep in the surf but then was apprehended by three officers, weapons brandished, and brought in to shore. So tell me, if you were trying to run away from the cops and headed into the ocean, where did you expect to end up? Perhaps Japan. Or maybe, just maybe, Atlantis?\n\nBest Chairman of the Board\n\nDistrict 2 Supervisor Shirley Bianchi leads the SLO County Board of Supervisors meetings with incredible patience and humor, keeping both her fellow supervisors and public speakers on track with a firm hand.\n\nIts not an easy job and Bianchi does hers with dignity, despite an increasingly dangerous situation. Local resident Terrill Graham, a zealous environmentalist, is furious over recent development decisions. He has been addressing the board weekly from the speakers podium with increasingly hostile diatribes. Graham has invested a great deal of personal money and time attempting to find redress in the courts without success. He is now trying to win in the court of public opinion, by personally attacking Bianchi. Her ability to remain calm in the face of this frightening verbal abuse is admirable. In fact, we think shes the best!\n\nBest Place to Camp\n\nMontaña de Oro\n\nThe surf, the sand, the forest. Montaña de Oro is well-known for being one of the prettiest spots in the county, but locals might not realize its got one of the nicest, yet most affordable, camping areas around. Its pretty small, so now that weve gone and told everyone about it, youll want to head there early while the spots are still open. Everything you need is there, as long as you dont need a shower.\n\nBest Place to Burn Your Butt\n\nPirates Cove\n\nNestled in the Pismo Beach coastline is a magical little slice of sand known affectionately as Pirates Cove. A short wander through aromatic and picturesque trails takes you to a shoreline dotted with seals, shells, and skin. You dont have to bother with annoying little conventions like bathing suits herejust let it all out and discover the bliss that comes from sun shining where the sun dont normally shine! Happiness is no tan lines!\n\nBest Band if You Want to Dance and Party\n\nStank Finatra\n\nJust because one of the guys in the band sells advertising for New Times and because two of the other guys share a house with our calendar editor does not mean that we have a bias toward this band. Even if we didnt know them so, uh, intimately, wed still know that when they play at Mothers, its virtually impossible to get a drink.\n\nBest Place to be Bad When on a Diet\n\nArt Café\n\nThe Cremery, 570 Higuera St., SLO"
