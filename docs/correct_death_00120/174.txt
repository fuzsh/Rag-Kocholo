Quotes:

"The only difference between me and my fellow actors is that I've spent more time in jail."

"I gave up being serious about making pictures around the time I made a film with Greer Garson and she took a hundred and twenty-five takes to say no."

[on his acting talents] "Listen. I got three expressions: looking left, looking right and looking straight ahead."

"People think I have an interesting walk. Hell, I'm just trying to hold my gut in."

"RKO made the same film with me for ten years. They were so alike I wore the same suit in six of them and the same Burberry trench coat. They made a male Jane Russell out of me. I was the staff hero. They got so they wanted me to take some of my clothes off in the pictures. I objected to this, so I put on some weight and looked like a Bulgarian wrestler when I took my shirt off. Only two pictures in that time made any sense whatever. I complained and they told me frankly that they had a certain amount of baloney to sell and I was the boy to do it."

"I worked three pictures for 28 days straight. We'd shoot all night at RKO [The Locket (1946)], then I'd report to Undercurrent (1946) from seven in the morning until noon, when I'd be flown to Monterey to work all afternoon with Greer Garson [Desire Me (1947)]."
