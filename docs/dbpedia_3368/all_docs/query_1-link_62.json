When coming here, i was informed by my people on the square of knowledge and they told me that;here in St. Benedict, i'll be given all the great opportunities by the incredible audience of the club. And so, i'll try my best to do more for the club by winning titles,\"\n\n\"Also i've my former colleague here at Como called Nadir Minotti, whom i had a great season with in the Serie B and that will make things easier for me.I once again like to thank the Club President and the people of Rossoblu society for believing in my ability by reposing their confidence in me and i'll surely pay them back as i'm here to win with my playing mates for Sambenedettese and i hope to realize my dream too,\" the former Brescia man stated.\n\nIsaac Toah Ntow is yet to feature for Ghana."
