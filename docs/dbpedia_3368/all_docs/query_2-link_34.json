        "text": "SAPHO syndrome associated spondylitis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTanaka, Masato; Nakanishi, Kazuo; Misawa, Haruo; Sugimoto, Yoshihisa; Takahata, Tomohiro; Nakahara, Hiroyuki; Nakahara, Shinnosuke; Ozaki, Toshifumi\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe concept of synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome has been well clarified, after Chamot et al. suggested this peculiar disorder in 1987. The most commonly affected site in SAPHO syndrome is the anterior chest, followed by the spine. However, the clinical course and taxonomic concept of SAPHO spinal lesions are poorly understood. This study was performed to analyze: (1) the detailed clinical course of spinal lesions in SAPHO syndrome, and (2) the relationship between SAPHO syndrome with spinal lesions and seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Thirteen patients with spondylitis in SAPHO syndrome were analyzed. The features of spinal lesions were a chronic onset with a slight inflammatory reaction, and slowly progressing non-marginal syndesmophytes at multi spinal levels, besides the coexistence of specific skin lesions. SAPHO syndrome, especially spinal lesions related to palmoplantar pustulosis, can be recognized as a subtype of seronegative spondyloarthropathy.

Prevalence, etiology and pathogenesis of the disease are unknown, while diagnosis is made both clinically and by the specific gammagraphic image of Â«bull hornÂ» in the sternoclavicular joint. The following case of a 64-year-old woman diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast pT1N0Mx is reported. When studying the extent of the disease, a gammagraphic image of diffuse blast injury in the sterna manubrium was evidenced, which allowed the suspicion of Paget's disease or metastatic injury. Study was completed with a chest CT in which manubrium sclerosis was evidenced, suggesting metÃ¡stasis. Res ults of the studies pointed out SAPHO syndrome as the most likely diagnostic option. The low tumor stage of the patient prompted the idea of possible alternative diagnoses. A deeper knowledge of this clinical condition may be crucial to avoid mistakes when classifying a subject in more advanced tumor stages, and consequently, to prevent the use of more aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments.

Retrospective study (1984-2007) was performed in a single center. All patients with the SAPHO syndrome were included. Fifty-two patients were included: 26 male, mean age at diagnosis is 42Â±12 years. Ostearticular involvement was present before cutaneous involvement in 59.6% of patients and concomitantly in 23.5%. Anterior chest pain was the commonest clinical manifestation, it was present in 38 patients (73%), followed by peripheral arthritis in 17 patients (32%), and sacroliliac pain in 14 patients (26.9%). Cutaneous involvement was present in 33 patients (63.5%). HLA B27 antigen was present in eight patients (17.7%). Bone scintigraphy showed an increased uptake in 42 patients (93.3%). The location of the uptake was mainly in sternoclavicular and manubriosternal joints. CT scan was performed in all \"hot joints\" showing sclerosis, erosions, hyperostosis, and soft tissue involvement. Refractory patients were treated mainly with pamidronate. Although SAPHO syndrome is an entity that share features that fit into a variety of established disease categories, the present study has a homogenous clinical and radiological pattern that gives support to believe that the SAPHO syndrome is an isolated clinical entity.\n\nSAPHO Syndrome â A Pictorial Assay\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKhanna, Lokesh; El-khoury, Georges Y.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis) syndrome is a distinct clinical entity representing involvement of the musculoskeletal and dermatologic systems. It is well known to rheumatologists because of characteristic skin manifestations and polyarthropathy. However, few reports exist in the orthopaedic literature. It is important to be aware of sAPHO syndrome as it can mimic some of the more common disease entities such as infection, tumor, and other inflammatory arthropathies. Anterior chest wall pain centered at sternoclavicular and sternocostal joints is an important and characteristic clinical finding which can point to its diagnosis. A patient may undergo different diagnostic tests and invasive procedures such as biopsies before a diagnosis is made. Imaging can be helpful by offering a detailed evaluation of the abnormalities. More importantly it helps in revealing subclinical foci of involvement due to the polyostotic nature of the disease. The treatment is mostly nonsurgical. NSAIDS are the first line agents. However multiple new agents are being used for refractory cases. Surgery is reserved to treat complications. PMID:23576940\n\nThrombotic manifestations in SAPHO syndrome.

The objective of this study was to review the cases published in the medical literature related with the presence of thrombotic complications in patients diagnosed with SAPHO syndrome and to try to determine their possible pathogenic mechanism and risk factors. We analyzed 11 published reports of isolated clinical cases or case series, a total of 144 patients, which described a total of 15 cases of venous thrombosis. The clinical characteristics of these patients, evaluated to determine whether they meet the ASAS criteria for axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis, is analyzed the need for early diagnosis and treatment is highlighted.

Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive thickening and enhancement of the right frontal dura, muscle and fascia, as well as abnormal signal intensity and enhancement of bone marrow at the lesions. Synovitis-acne-pustulosis-hyperostosis osteomyelitis (SAPHO) syndrome was diagnosed based on the patient's 8-year history of treatment of palmoplantar pustulosis and abnormal accumulations in the right temporal, sternum, and left medial clavicula on bone scintigraphy. SAPHO syndrome may be associated with skull lesions, which can contribute to the onset of repeated headache or dural thickening, thus these symptoms should be recognized as manifestations of this syndrome.\n\nSequential Combination Therapy Leading to Sustained Remission in a Patient with SAPHO Syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHuber, C.E; Judex, A.G; Freyschmidt, J; Feuerbach, S; SchÃ¶lmerich, J; MÃ¼ller-Ladner, U\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe SAPHO syndrome represents a variety of clinically similar disorders with the key features of hyperostotic bone lesions in combination with chronic pustular skin disease. The respective pathophysiology of bone and joint manifestations in SAPHO syndrome is still a matter of discussion. For example it does not appear to represent reactive arthritis and HLA B27 antigen, with the latter being typically present in patients with spondyloarthopathies. Treatment of SAPHO syndrome is also not well established and consists of various antiinflammatory and antirheumatic drugs. Here, we report a female patient with active SAPHO syndrome suffering from sternal swelling of unknown origin that had been known for 10 years and a 4-year-history of severe lower back pain. Remarkable were also a typical pustulous palmar erythema associated with swelling and decreased motility of both MCP-I joints. Inflammation parameters were high with an ESR 68 mm/1st hour and a CRP of 19.6 mg/l. She was initially treated with rofecoxib and doxycycline, followed by sulfasalazine with only partial clinical response. Thereafter, both articular symptoms as well as cutaneous lesions responded well to a combination therapy with methotrexate and sulfasalazine. Thus, the case illustrates nicely that methotrexate in combination with another DMARD can be successfully applied to patients with long-term active SAPHO syndrome.

SAPHO syndrome is a rare disease, characterized by specific clinical manifestations of synovitis, acne pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis. It is a disease that manifests with a combination of osseous and articular manifestations associated with skin lesions (2). Venous thrombosis complicating SAPHO syndrome seems to be uncommon with an unclear pathogenesis (3-9). Coexistence of antiphospholipid syndrome and SAPHO syndrome was not previously mentioned in literature. A 33-year-old white woman was diagnosed with SAPHO syndrome at the age of 31. The patient was previously diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome and depressive syndrome. She was treated with sulfasalazin (2 g daily) and methotrexate (20 mg weekly). Seven months before admission to our department she experienced an episode of deep vein thrombosis of the left leg, successfully treated with subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium (40 mg daily) that was continued for the following 6 months as secondary prophylaxis. Pustular skin changes on palmar surface of the hands and plantar surface of the feet (characteristic for palmo-plantar pustulosis), tenderness of sterno-clavicular joints, swelling and restricted motion of both wrists, and pain on motion in both elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles were found on physical examination. There was also a moderate amount of effusion in her left knee. There was a 3-centimeter difference between the circumferences of the shins. The level of C reactive protein was increased (6.21 mg/L). The patient was positive for antiÎ²2glicoprotein-1 (anti-Î²2G-1) antibodies. Tests for anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), antiannexin V antibodies, antiphosphatidylserine antibodies (aPS), and antiprothrombin antibodies (aPT) were negative. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and D-dimer level were normal, and\n\nF-18 FDG PET/CT in 26 patients with SAPHO syndrome: a new vision of clinical and bone scintigraphy correlation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Xiaochuan; Li, Chen; Cao, Yihan; Shi, Ximin; Li, Li; Zhang, Weihong; Wu, Xia; Wu, Nan; Jing, Hongli; Zhang, Wen\n\n2018-05-22\n\nWhole-body bone scintigraphy (WBBS) and MRI are widely used in assessment of patients with synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome. However, the value of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( 18 F-FDG PET/CT) in SAPHO syndrome was unclear. The aim of this study was to characterize the manifestation of SAPHO syndrome on 18 F-FDG PET/CT and explore its relationship with clinical symptoms and WBBS. Twenty-six patients who suffered from SAPHO syndrome and had undergone whole-body 18 F-FDG PET/CT were recruited in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2004 to 2016. Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings were recorded for all patients. Imaging data on 18F-FDG PET/CT and WBBS were collected and analyzed retrospectively. All the 26 patients (20 females and 6 males) exhibited skeletal abnormalities on 18 F-FDG PET/CT. Multiple skeletal lesions affecting the anterior chest wall or spine with low to moderate 18 F-FDG uptake and coexistence of osteolysis and osteosclerosis presented as the typical features of SAPHO syndrome. Sixteen (61.5%) patients had abnormal 18 F-FDG uptake outside the osteoarticular system. PET scan had moderate to substantial agreement with CT and WBBS in revealing lesions in the anterior chest wall and axial skeleton. Nonetheless, the correlation between increased 18 F-FDG uptake and clinical symptoms was weak. SAPHO syndrome exhibits characteristic features on 18 F-FDG PET/CT. It showed comparable capacity in revealing skeletal lesions with bone scintigraphy.\n\nSAPHO syndrome in an adult with ulcerative colitis responsive to intravenous pamidronate: a case report and review of the literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nSiau, Keith; Laversuch, Catherine J\n\n2010-06-01\n\nSynovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome is a rare group of sterile, inflammatory osteoarticular disorders classically associated with skin lesions. It is occasionally associated with enteropathic disease such as ulcerative colitis. We present a 39-year-old patient with chronic ulcerative colitis who developed enteropathic SAPHO and responded well to pamidronate. We discuss the clinicopathological features with particular attention to bone pathology, and perform a literature review of this fascinating syndrome.\n\nThe salivary proteome profile in patients affected by SAPHO syndrome characterized by a top-down RP-HPLC-ESI-MS platform.\n\nPubMed\n\nSanna, Monica; Firinu, Davide; Manconi, Paolo Emilio; Pisanu, Maria; Murgia, Giuseppe; Piras, Valentina; Castagnola, Massimo; Messana, Irene; del Giacco, Stefano Renato; Cabras, Tiziana\n\n2015-06-01\n\nSAPHO syndrome is a rare and often unrecognized disease with prominent inflammatory cutaneous and articular symptoms characterized by musculoskeletal manifestations (synovitis, hyperostosis, osteomyelitis) associated with dermatological conditions (severe acne and pustulosis). The acidic soluble fraction of whole saliva from 10 adult women affected by SAPHO syndrome and from a group of 28 healthy women was analysed by RP-HPLC-ESI-MS with the aim of discovering salivary biomarkers of the disorder. The levels of the oral proteins and peptides were correlated with clinical data. The following proteins showed a significant decreased concentration in saliva of SAPHO subjects with respect to controls: cystatin S1 and SN, histatins, the major acidic PRPs, P-C and P-B peptides. The cystatin SN abundance lowered according to the disease duration and histatins showed positive correlations with the C reactive protein. Statistical analysis performed excluding one patient with a different pattern of salivary proteins/peptides highlighted a positive relationship between cystatin S1, histatins 3, histatin 5, and the neutrophil count. Moreover, histatin 3 correlated positively with the total white cell count and negatively with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Levels and frequency of S100A12 protein showed a trend to increase in SAPHO patients. The high expression of this pro-inflammatory protein is probably related to the inflammatory response and to the altered neutrophil responses to functional stimuli that characterize SAPHO syndrome suggesting a possible application as a salivary biomarker.\n\nChronic mandibular osteomyelitis with suspected underlying synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome: a case report\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMochizuki, Yumi; Omura, Ken; Hirai, Hideaki; Kugimoto, Takuma; Osako, Toshimitu; Taguchi, Takahide\n\n2012-01-01\n\nChronic mandibular osteomyelitis is an intractable disease. In recent years, some case reports have related this disease process to synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome, which is chronic with frequent remissions and exacerbations. This report describes a case of chronic mandibular osteomyelitis suspected to be SAPHO syndrome. A 68-year-old woman presented with pain on the left side of the mandible. On the basis of clinical and radiological findings, chronic mandibular diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis was initially diagnosed. We administrated oral clarithromycin (400 mg daily) and levofloxacin (500 mg daily), and her pain subsequently resolved. On 99mTc-labeled methylene diphosphonate scintigraphy, tracer uptake in the asymptomatic mandible was unchanged, but there was increasing tracer uptake in the sternocostal and sternoclavicular joints, compared with 99mTc-labeled methylene diphosphonate scintigraphic findings of the first visit. We diagnosed SAPHO syndrome and administrated oral sodium risedronate hydrate (2.5 mg daily). Although there has been no pain or swelling in the area of the left mandibular lesion, we have followed up on other skin and osteoarticular manifestations in conjunction with other medical departments. PMID:22427727\n\n[Inflammatory spondylodiscitis as a unique radiological manifestation of the SAPHO syndrome].\n\nPubMed\n\nCabay, J E; Marcelis, S; Dondelinger, R F\n\n1998-04-01\n\nWe describe two cases of SAPHO with an exclusive spinal involvement. Diagnosis was established by sterno-clavicular arthralgias, palmar and plantar pustulosis and by radiological signs of inflammatory spondylodiscitis and vertebral osteitis. Spondylodiscitis and medullary edema resolved as shown by MRI after administration of steroids in one case and methotrexate in the other.\n\nDifferent Contributions of CDKAL1, KIF21B, and LRRK2/MUC19 Polymorphisms to SAPHO Syndrome, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, and Seronegative Spondyloarthropathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Nan; Ma, Junfen; Li, Kai; Guo, Changlong; Ming, Liang\n\n2017-02-01\n\nSynovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and seronegative spondyloarthropathy (SPA) are autoimmune diseases of unknown etiology, which share some clinical manifestations in common. Previous family-based investigations support genetic contributions to the susceptibility of these diseases. The current study evaluated whether three previously reported AS-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs6908425 T>C in CDKAL1, rs11584383 T>C near KIF21B, and rs11175593 C>T near LRRK2/MUC19, have any genetic overlap across multiple autoimmune diseases including SAPHO syndrome, RA, AS, and SPA. Genomic DNA was obtained from 71 SAPHO, 125 RA, 67 AS, and 35 SPA Han Chinese patients, as well as 104 healthy controls. SNPs were genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Genotype and allele frequencies were analyzed using chi-square test. rs6908425 T>C in CDKAL1 was significantly different between SAPHO cases and healthy controls (odds ratiosâ=â2.056, 95% confidence intervals: 1.211-3.490; pâ=â0.007), but no SNPs were associated with the risk of developing RA, AS, or SPA (pâ>â0.05). Analysis of genotype distributions showed similar results. A significant difference was only found in the genotype frequency of rs6908425 in SAPHO cases (pâ=â0.004); no significant differences were detected among patients with RA, AS, and SPA (pâ>â0.05). Our results suggest that rs6908425 in CDKAL1 is associated with the risk of developing SAPHO in Han Chinese populations. People who carry the risk allele T of rs6908425 might be more prone to developing SAPHO syndrome.\n\nEfficacy of antibiotic therapy for SAPHO syndrome is lost after its discontinuation: an interventional study\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIntroduction The acronym SAPHO was introduced in 1987 to unify the various descriptions of a seronegative arthritis associated with skin manifestations and to show synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis with and without sterile multifocal osteomyelitis. The etiology of SAPHO syndrome is unknown, but an association with infection by semipathogenic bacteria like Propionibacterium acnes has been suggested. We conducted an interventional study of SAPHO patients receiving antibiotics. Methods Thirty-seven patients met the clinical criteria of SAPHO syndrome, 21 of them underwent a needle biopsy of the osteitis lesion, and 14 of them showed positive bacteriological cultures for P. acnes. Thirty patients (14 bacteriological positive and 16 without biopsy) were treated with antibiotics for 16 weeks. The activity of skin disease and osteitis were assessed by a physician using a scoring model (from 0 to 6). In addition, patients completed a Health Assessment Score (HAS, from 0 to 6). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was determined and a MRI (of the osteitis lesion, radiologic activity score from 0 to 2) was performed in week 1 (W1), week 16 (W16), and week 28 (W28, 12 weeks after antibiotics). Results Twenty-seven patients continued the medication (azithromycin, n = 25, 500 mg twice a week; clindamycin, n = 1, 300 mg daily; or doxycycline, n = 1, 100 mg daily) for 16 weeks. After W16 the scores for MRI (1.5 to 1.1, P = 0.01), skin activity (3.2 to 1.2, P = 0.01), osteitis activity (4.0 to 2.1, P = 0.02), and HAS (3.3 to 2.1, P = 0.01) decreased significantly. However, this was followed by increasing values for MRI scores (1.2 to 1.4, P = 0.08), skin activity (1.2 to 1.7, P = 0.11), osteitis activity (1.9 to 2.7, P = 0.01), and HAS (2.2 to 3.3, P = 0.02) from W16 to W28. The comparison of the scores in W1 and W28 in these 12 patients showed no significant differences. Conclusions For the period of application, the antibiotic therapy seems to have controlled\n\nA case of synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome presenting with hypertrophic pachymeningitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nShiraishi, Wataru; Hayashi, Shintaro; Iwanaga, Yasutaka; Murai, Hiroyuki; Yamamoto, Akifumi; Kira, Jun-ichi\n\n2015-02-15\n\nA 43-year-old woman with a 3-year history of headache, fever, and swelling of the forehead, presented to our hospital. A general examination revealed palmar and plantar pustules. Blood analyses showed an elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Brain MRI revealed a partially thickened cranial bone with gadolinium enhancement, and also abnormally enhanced dura mater. Bone scintigraphy showed involvement of the cranial bone and bilateral sternoclavicular joints. Palmar skin biopsy indicated palmoplantar pustulosis. From these results, SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis) syndrome with associated hypertrophic pachymeningitis was diagnosed. After corticosteroid therapy and tonsillectomy, the clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities were improved. Clinicians should be aware of SAPHO as a potential unusual cause of hypertrophic pachymeningitis. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosero, A; Ruano, R; Martin, M; Hidalgo, C; Garcia-Talavera, J\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis report concerns a male adult admitted for sternal and left arm pain, who was diagnosed and treated for acute deep venous thrombosis in the left subclavian and axillary veins. X-ray and a hybrid single photon emission tomography and computed tomography (SPECT-CT) scintigraphy scan revealed high intensity uptake in both sternoclavicular joints, which corresponded to hyperostosis, thereby suggesting a SAPHO syndrome. Upon reviewing the patient's medical history, we found dermatological pustulosis disease and an intermittent sternal chest pain untreated since 10 years ago. In the biochemical study we found erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation, hyperglobulinemia, and mild anaemia. Initial treatment included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with low response, which then changed to methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and prednisone. The patient's pain was controlled almost completely in 10 months. A control bone scan revealed a marked decrease in intensity of bone deposits according to clinical response. To our knowledge, there are only a few cases of SAPHO and thrombosis and none are followed up with a bone SPECT-CT scan.\n\nParadoxical skin lesions induced by anti-TNF-Î± agents in SAPHO syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Chen; Wu, Xia; Cao, Yihan; Zeng, Yueping; Zhang, Weihong; Zhang, Shuo; Liu, Yuehua; Jin, Hongzhong; Zhang, Wen; Li, Li\n\n2018-04-03\n\nThe objectives of the study were to characterize the clinical picture of paradoxical skin lesions in SAPHO patients treated with anti-TNF-Î± agents and to explore its pathogenesis. Patients treated with anti-TNF-Î± therapy were identified from a cohort of 164 SAPHO patients. The clinical data and skin biopsies were collected. The usage, efficacy, and side effects of anti-TNF-Î± therapy were recorded. Forty-one (25.0%) patients received anti-TNF-Î± therapy, of which seven (17.1%) developed paradoxical skin lesions after 1 to 14 infusions. Patients with such lesions were older at onset of skin lesions than those without (pâ=â0.034). Expression of TNF-Î± in palmoplantar pustulosis increased after anti-TNF-Î± therapy in the two examined patients with exacerbated skin lesions. Anti-TNF-Î± therapy induces paradoxical skin lesions in 17.1% SAPHO patients. Late onset of skin manifestations is associated with an increased risk of such lesions. The paradoxical elevation of TNF-Î± expression in lesions may contribute to this phenomenon.\n\n[Headache as a manifestation of SAPHO syndrome with a lesion extending to the dura mater, parietal bone, and temporal muscle].\n\nPubMed\n\nUematsu, Miho; Tobisawa, Shinsuke; Nagao, Masahiro; Matsubara, Shiro; Mizutani, Toshio; Shibuya, Makoto\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA 50-year-old woman with a history of palmoplantar pustulosis, femur osteomyelitis, and sterno-costo-clavicular hyperostosis presented with a chronic severe left temporal headache that had progressed during the previous year. Her CRP level was elevated. Cranial images showed Gadolinium-enhancement of the left temporal muscle, left parietal bone and dura mater. (99m)Tc-HMDP scintigram showed increased uptake in the left parietal bone, left sterno-costo-clavicular joint, right femoral head and intervertebral joints. Biopsy of the lesion demonstrated 1) proliferation of connective tissue in both perimysium and endomysium of the temporal muscle with mild inflammatory cell infiltration within the interstitium, 2) marked infiltration of granulocytes to the bone marrow of the parietal bone, 3) necrosis and moderate fibrosis in the interstitium with inflammatory cell infiltration in the parietal bone, and 4) moderate fibrosis and slight infiltration of inflammatory cells in the dura mater. The patient was diagnosed with a cranial lesion of synovitis-acne-pustulosis-hyperostosis-osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome. There was a moderate response to treatment with intravenous steroid pulse therapy and subsequent methotrexate. In a case of headache accompanied by inflammatory response, palmoplantar pustulosis and joint lesions such as hyperostosis, the possibility of a rare cranial manifestation of SAPHO syndrome should be considered.\n\nSAPHO: What radiologists should know.\n\nPubMed\n\nDepasquale, R; Kumar, N; Lalam, R K; Tins, B J; Tyrrell, P N M; Singh, J; Cassar-Pullicino, V N\n\n2012-03-01\n\nSAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis) is an umbrella acronym for inflammatory clinical conditions whose common denominator is aseptic osteoarticular involvement with characteristic skin lesions. It involves all ages, can involve any skeletal site, and has variable imaging appearances depending on the stage/age of the lesion and imaging method. It mimics important differentials including infection and neoplasia. Awareness of the imaging features, especially in the spine, facilitates early diagnosis, prevents repeated biopsies, and avoids unnecessary surgery, while initiating appropriate treatment.

The skin lesion developed after she was treated with isoniazid (INH) following exposure to active tuberculosis (TB). After resolution of the skin lesions, this child developed sterile hyperplastic osteomyelitis consistent with SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis) osteomyelitis in her right mandible triggered by an odontogenic infection. This child had congenital heart disease, dysmorphic facies, recurrent sinopulmonary infection, gastroesophageal reflux disease, scoliosis, reactive periostitis, and developmental delay. She had a low CD4 and CD8 T cell count with a normal 4/8 ratio, but normal cell proliferation and T cell cytokine production in response to mitogens. When she was presented with sterile osteomyelitis of right mandible, she revealed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)/angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels, but negative CRP. Autoimmune and sarcoidosis workup was negative. Inflammatory parameters gradually normalized following resolution of odontogenic infection and with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The broad clinical spectrum of DGS is further expanded with the development of autoimmune and inflammatory complications later in life. This case suggests that patients with the DGS can present with unusual sterile inflammatory lesions triggered by environmental factors, further broadening the clinical spectrum of this syndrome.\n\nPustulotic Arthro-Osteitis (Sonozaki Syndrome): A Case Report and Review of Literature\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKose, Reyhan; Senturk, Taskin; Sargin, Gokhan; Cildag, Songul; Kara, Yasemin\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPustulotic arthro-osteitis (PAO) is a rare chronic inflammatory disease, which has now been classified as a seronegative spondyloarthritis. The sternoclavicular and sternocostal joints, pelvis, vertebra, hip, and long bones are affected. Skin findings of the disease are accepted as a variant of pustular psoriasis, but some authors have suggested that palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a different entity. The synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis. PAO differs from SAPHO by the absence of hyperostosis and the difference in skin manifestations. Here, we aimed to present a 34-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of PAO with typical skin findings and joint involvement.

No editorial grounds exist for denying Donne's authorship of \"Sapho to Philaenis\"; rather the interpretive task is to reconstitute the poem's significance in period terms. The task is complicated by Donne's penchant for flouting literary and social convention as he successively overturns Ovid's influential portrayal of Sappho as an aging voluptuary reclaimed for heterosexuality, the virulent homophobia of Renaissance humanists, and the coy idealizations and transient evocation given to lesbian affectivity by the very few Renaissance writers (including Shakespeare) who touched on the subject at all. When \"Sapho to Philaenis\" is set in the context of Donne's other love elegies in verse as productions by a young intellectual moving in sophisticated London circles and writing for a coterie audience, lesbianism looks like a master trope for positively resolving a dilemma that confounded Montaigne and many other authors of the age. Could the perfections of love and friendship be united in a relation of equality between two persons? Gender hierarchy and separate socialization precluded a heterosexual construction of any such equality in the Renaissance, and the greater opprobrium cast on male homosexuality in this era must have influenced Donne's decision to figure his equal lovers and friends as a lesbian couple. Yet the disclosive power of \"Sapho to Philaenis\" goes far beyond the entailments of a specific choice of poetic representation. Donne really undertakes to imagine the pleasures, sustenance, and ideological implications by which lesbianism, as a mode of loving and being, resists patriarchal disposition and diminution of women. Donne anticipates the advances of\n\nDiagnosis of antenatal Bartter syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nNarayan, R; Peres, M; Kesby, G\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBartter syndrome is a rare heterogeneous group of autosomal-recessive salt-losing renal tubular disorders that can present in fetal life (antenatal Bartter syndrome; ABS) as \"unexplained\" early-onset polyhydramnios, often associated with growth restriction. Prenatal diagnosis of the condition involves assessment of amniotic fluid biochemistry in a setting of polyuric polyhydramnios; with elevated chloride levels considered a consistent and diagnostic finding. Other amniotic fluid biochemical markers have been described, notably increased aldosterone levels, and low total protein levels. NOVEL INSIGHT: Antenatal Bartter syndrome is a heterogeneous group of renal disorders. While certain biochemical features in amniotic fluid might heighten suspicion, final diagnosis can only be made in the postnatal setting. In the setting of unexplained severe polyhydramnios, clinicians should continue to entertain the diagnosis of antenatal Bartter Syndrome and maintain neonatal surveillance, even if amniotic fluid markers do not support the diagnosis.\n\nSymptoms and Diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

Early recognition and proficient diagnosis is imperative to facilitate prompt treatment and prevention of clinical complications. Experts in Asia Pacific reviewed medical records focusing on presenting signs and symptoms leading to a diagnosis of Morquio A syndrome. Eighteen patients (77% female) had a mean (median; min, max) age of 77.1 (42.0; 0.0, 540.0) months at symptom onset, 78.9 (42.0; 4.5, 540.0) months at presentation and 113.8 (60.0; 7.0, 540.0) months at diagnosis. Orthopedic surgeons and pediatricians were most frequently consulted pre-diagnosis while clinical geneticists/metabolic specialists most frequently made the diagnosis. Delayed diagnoses were due to atypical symptoms for 5 patients (28%), while 4 patients (22%) experienced each of subtle symptoms, symptoms commonly associated with other diseases, or false-negative urine glycosaminoglycan analysis. Two patients (11%) each experienced overgrowth within the first year of life. Two patients with Morquio A syndrome (11%) were diagnosed with craniosynostosis and 1 (6%) for each of Legg-CalvÃ©-Perthes disease, Leri-Weill syndrome, and pseudoachondroplasia. Early radiographic features of Morquio A syndrome led to more efficient diagnosis. Increased awareness of clinical symptomology overlapping with Morquio A syndrome is essential. Clinicians encountering patients with certain skeletal dysplasia should consider Morquio A syndrome in their differential diagnosis. Atypical or subtle symptoms should not eliminate Morquio A syndrome from the differential diagnosis, especially for patients who may have non-classical phenotype of Morquio A syndrome.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis of Joubert syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhu, Lingling; Xie, Limei\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract Introduction: Joubert syndrome (JS) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disease belonging to ciliopathy with the causative mutation of genes. Except for X-linked inheritance, the high recurrence rate of a family is about 25%. After birth, it may cause a series of neurological symptoms, even with retina, kidney, liver, and other organ abnormalities, which is defined as Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD). Molecular genetics research contributes to disease prediction and genetic counseling. Prenatal diagnosis is rare. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually the first-choice diagnostic modality with typical brain images characterized by the molar tooth sign. We describe a case of JS prenatally and Dandy-Walker malformation for the differential diagnosis based on ultrasonograms. We also review the etiology, imaging features, clinical symptoms, and diagnosis of JSRD. Case presentation: A 22-year-old woman was pregnant at 27 1/7 weeksâ gestation with fetal cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. Fetal ultrasonography and MRI confirmed a diagnosis of JS at our center. The couple finally opted to terminate the fetus, which had a normal appearance and growth parameters. The couple also had an AHI1 gene mutation on chromosome 6. Conclusions: Currently, a diagnosis of JS is commonly made after birth. Fewer cases of prenatal diagnosis by ultrasonography have been made, and they are more liable to be misdirected because of some nonspecial features that also manifest in Dandy-Walker malformation, cranio-cerebello-cardiac syndrome, and so on.

Patients with affirmative diagnosis of Alport syndrome from Department of Pedatrics, Peking University First Hospital in the past 20 years (1995-2015) were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical data including initial symptoms, visit reasons, age at onset of disease, family history, hereditary mode, methods of diagnosis, misdiagnosis and mistreatment were collected. A total of 398 patients with Alport syndrome were included in this study, 48.2% of patients had the onset of symptoms before age of 3 years. The rate of onset of symptoms and diagnosis before age of 17 years were 95.7%. The initial symptoms included gross hematuria (37.2%), microscopic hematuria and proteinuria (25.1%), microscopic hematuria (14.8%), edema of eyelid and lower limbs (10.3%), increased foam in urine (4.3%), etc.; 39.5% of patients had no symptoms of urinary tract. Only 14.0% of the patients were diagnosed as Alport syndrome for the first time, and 86.0% of the patients were misdiagnosed. Hormones and immunosuppressive agents were used in 19.0% of patients diagnosed as Alport syndrome, and in 43.0% of patients there was misdiagnosis. Skin biopsy and immunofluorescence of type â £ collagen É5 chain in epithelial basement membrane had a detection rate of 77.8%. Electron microscopy of glomerular basement membrane had a detection rate of 92.6%, and genetic testing 96.6%. The time interval of diagnosis was 18.2 months and was gradually shortened in recent years. Alport syndrome developed at a very young age. Hematuria was the most frequent initial symptom. There was a high rate of misdiagnosis and mistreatment for Alport syndrome. Genetic testing for Alport syndrome had advantages of high detection rate, genetic consultation and prenatal diagnosis.\n\nInterstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome: diagnosis and management.\n\nPubMed\n\nOffiah, I; McMahon, S B; O'Reilly, B A\n\n2013-08-01\n\nThe bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is a spectrum of urological symptoms characterised by bladder pain with typical cystoscopic features. Diagnosis and management of this syndrome may be difficult. There is no evidence-based management approach for the diagnosis or treatment of BPS. The objective of this study was to critically review and summarise the evidence relating to the diagnosis and treatment of the bladder pain syndrome. A review of published data on the diagnosis and treatment of the BPS was performed. Our search was limited to English-language articles, on the \"diagnosis\", and \"management\" or \"treatment\" of \"interstitial cystitis\" and the \"bladder pain syndrome\" in \"humans.\" Frequency, urgency and pain on bladder filling are the most common symptoms of BPS. All urodynamic volumes are reduced in patients with BPS. Associated conditions include psychological distress, depression, history of sexual assault, irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia. Cystoscopy remains the test for definitive diagnosis, with visualisation of haemorrhage on cystoreduction. A multidisciplinary treatment approach is essential in the management of this condition. Orally administered amitriptyline is an efficacious medical treatment for BPS. Intravesical hyaluronic acid and local anaesthetic, with/without hydrodistension are among new treatment strategies. Sacral or pudendal neuromodulation is effective, minimally invasive and safe. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases. There remains a paucity of evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of BPS. We encountered significant heterogeneity in the assessment of symptoms, duration of treatment and follow up of patients in our literature review.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism retardation and dysmorphism (HRD) syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nHershkovitz, E; Hershkovitz, R; Hertzug, L; Gorodischer, R; Mazor, M; Parvari, R\n\n2000-06-01\n\nWe used linkage analysis for prenatal diagnosis of the recently reported hypoparathyroidism, retardation, and dysmorphism (HRD) syndrome. Five cases from four families were evaluated. Three fetuses were carriers and were born healthy. Two fetuses were affected but the parents decided not to terminate the pregnancies. The diagnosis of HRD syndrome was confirmed in these newborns. This is the first report about prenatal diagnosis of HRD syndrome.

Most syndromes have no external criterion standard of diagnosis. The predictive value of a clinical sign used in diagnosis is dependent on the prior probability of the syndrome diagnosis. Clinicians often misjudge the probabilities involved. Syndromology needs objective methods to ensure diagnostic consistency, and take prior probabilities into account. We applied two basic artificial intelligence methods to a database of machine-generated patients - a âvector methodâ and a set method. As reference methods we ran an ID3 algorithm, a cluster analysis and a naive Bayesâ calculation on the same patient series. The overall diagnostic error rate for the the vector algorithm was 0.93%, and for the ID3 0.97%. For the clinical signs found by the set method, the predictive values varied between 0.71 and 1.0. The artificial intelligence methods that we used, proved simple, robust and powerful, and represent objective diagnostic methods.

Common clinical features include corneal edema, secondary glaucoma, iris atrophy, and pupillary anomalies, ranging from distortion to polycoria. The main subtypes of this syndrome are the progressive iris atrophy, the Cogan-Reese syndrome, and the Chandler syndrome. ICE syndrome is usually diagnosed in women in the adult age. Clinical history and complete eye examination including tonometry and gonioscopy are necessary to reach a diagnosis. Imaging techniques, such as in vivo confocal microscopy and ultrasound biomicroscopy, are used to confirm the diagnosis by revealing the presence of âICE-cellsâ on the corneal endothelium and the structural changes of the anterior chamber angle. An early diagnosis is helpful to better manage the most challenging complications such as secondary glaucoma and corneal edema. Treatment of ICE-related glaucoma often requires glaucoma filtering surgery with antifibrotic agents and the use of glaucoma drainage implants should be considered early in the management of these patients. Visual impairment and pain associated with corneal edema can be successfully managed with endothelial keratoplasty.

In these conditions, interleukin (IL)-1 is overproduced, and this overproduction plays a major role in disease onset and progression. CAPS include three variants, ranging in order of increasing severity from familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, previously termed familial cold urticaria, through Muckle-Wells syndrome, to chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous articular syndrome, also known as neonatal onset multisystemic inflammatory disease. Diagnosis of CAPS is initially based on clinical manifestations and medical history, and later confirmed genetically. CAPS should be suspected when characteristic skin lesions, typical periodic fever episodes, bone/joint manifestations, and CNS involvement are recognized. CAPS are life-long diseases, and early diagnosis and early treatment with IL-1-targeted therapies may improve prognosis.\n\nThe Importance of Correct Diagnosis of Crocodile Tears Syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Oliveira, Danila; Gomes-Ferreira, Pedro Henrique Silva; Carrasco, Leandro Carlos; de Deus, Ciro Borges Duailibe; Garcia-JÃºnior, Idelmo Rangel; Faverani, Leonardo Perez\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe excessive unilateral tearing as a result of gustatory stimuli is a characteristic of crocodile tears syndromes. The aim of this study is to report 2 cases of Frey and crocodile tears syndromes, considering diagnosis, monitoring, and selection of appropriate treatment. A 74-year-old female patient presented with a history of Bell palsy, tearing on left eye at the moment of chewing, and absence of pain. The patient opted only for periodic case monitoring because the symptoms presented by the syndrome did not bother her, which made any invasive procedure unnecessary, and with the closed diagnosis she may be reassured and really know what was happening to her. So scientific divulgations about this syndrome should be made in order to increase the knowledge of dentists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons, because it is a rare syndrome and easily diagnosed. Due to the low knowledge in Brazil, the patient of this report had to wait about 9 years to get a diagnosis.\n\nPrevalence, incidence, and age at diagnosis in Marfan Syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nGroth, Kristian A; Hove, Hanne; Kyhl, Kasper; Folkestad, Lars; Gaustadnes, Mette; Vejlstrup, Niels; Stochholm, Kirstine; Ãstergaard, John R; Andersen, Niels H; Gravholt, Claus H\n\n2015-12-02\n\nMarfan syndrome is a genetic disorder with considerable morbidity and mortality. Presently, clinicians use the 2010 revised Ghent nosology, which includes optional genetic sequencing of the FBN1 gene, to diagnose patients. So far, only a few studies based on older diagnostic criteria have reported a wide range of prevalence and incidence. Our aim was to study prevalence, incidence, and age at diagnosis in patients with Marfan syndrome. Using unique Danish patient-registries, we identified all possible Marfan syndrome patients recorded by the Danish healthcare system (1977-2014). Following, we confirmed or rejected the diagnosis according to the 2010 revised Ghent nosology. We identified a total of 1628 persons with possible Marfan syndrome. We confirmed the diagnosis in 412, whereof 46 were deceased, yielding a maximum prevalence of 6.5/100,000 at the end of 2014. The annual median incidence was 0.19/100,000 (range: 0.0-0.7) which increased significantly with an incidence rate ratio of 1.03 (95% CI: 1.02-1.04, pâ<â0.001). We found a median age at diagnose of 19.0 years (range: 0.0-74). The age at diagnosis increased during the study period, uninfluenced by the changes in diagnostic criteria. We found no gender differences. The increasing prevalence of Marfan syndrome during the study period is possibly due to build-up of a registry. Since early diagnosis is essential in preventing aortic events, diagnosing Marfan syndrome remains a task for both pediatricians and physicians caring for adults.\n\nAutopsy diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiller, Peter; Prahlow, Joseph A\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThe fat embolism syndrome (FES) is considered a clinical diagnosis. It typically occurs within several days following major traumatic injury, usually involving fractures of the pelvis and/or lower extremities. Fat embolism syndrome is characterized by the onset of respiratory, neurological, cutaneous, and hematologic manifestations and is thought to be related to intravascular embolization of fat, presumably arising from within the fractured bone marrow space. In its most severe form, FES can be lethal. The presence of fat emboli within the microvasculature of the lungs, brain, and sometimes other organs verifies the clinical impression of FES. Despite its relatively well-known clinical characterization, debate exists within the clinical literature regarding the most appropriate diagnostic criteria for FES. Given this fact, along with the fact that FES is a clinical diagnosis, it is not surprising that forensic pathologists may be somewhat reluctant to make a postmortem diagnosis of FES, especially in cases where insufficient clinical information is available. A case of fatal FES is presented in which rapid clinical deterioration occurred, followed by death, such that a clinical diagnosis of FES was never rendered. We propose that, given the correct circumstances, clinical scenario, and autopsy findings, it is appropriate and acceptable to make a postmortem diagnosis of FES. A multitiered approach to the postmortem diagnosis of FES is presented.\n\nMetabolic syndrome in children and adolescents - criteria for diagnosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMancini, Marcio C\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn recent years, there has been a greater concern about the presence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents. However, there is no consensus regarding the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents. It is evident that each component of the syndrome must be identified as early as possible in order to prevent definitive lesions. The question is how to do this and which cut-offs must be adopted for this diagnosis. For a matter of convenience, the definition chosen as the most appropriate is the one proposed by the IDF, with cut-offs fixed for pressure, lipids and glycemia, and abdominal circumference points assessed by percentile. Although on the one hand this definition could fail to include some children in the diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome, on the other hand, it would be of easier acceptance as it does not use multiple tables to assess several anthropometric and metabolic criteria.

Persistent microscopic hematuria is the hallmark of Alport syndrome, occurring in almost all boys according to previous reports. We report the case of a 20-year-old man presented with proteinuria but no hematuria that was initially misdiagnosed with refractory nephrotic syndrome and was eventually diagnosed with Alport syndrome following kidney and skin biopsy. During the follow-up period, he experienced a rapid progression to end-stage renal disease. Timely diagnosis of Alport syndrome is important, because patients may benefit from early intervention and avoid suffering from unnecessary nephrotoxic drug use.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis of brain abnormalities in Wolf-Hirschhorn (4p-) syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe Keersmaecker, B; Albert, M; Hillion, Y; Ville, Y\n\n2002-05-01\n\nAlthough there have been occasional reports of prenatal diagnosis of this syndrome, most cases are diagnosed postnatally. The objective was to evaluate the presence of brain abnormalities in the prenatal diagnosis of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Prenatal ultrasound and MRI examination of the fetal brain were performed in a case of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. A comprehensive review of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome reported between 1960 and 2000 in the literature was carried out. The late diagnosis of a growth-retarded fetus with normal amniotic fluid volume, normal Doppler and negative infection screen calls for a detailed examination of the fetal brain and heart. Multifocal white matter lesions and periventricular cystic changes, which are often attributed to perinatal distress, are possible prenatal features causing suspicion of 4p- syndrome in an IUGR fetus. Subtle abnormalities on ultrasound may suggest a chromosomal problem. Standard cytogenetics cannot always demonstrate a microdeletion. High-resolution banding and molecular analysis can help to confirm the diagnosis.

Although first described in 1943, it was included in the ICD-10 not before 1992. The knowledge about this lighter autistic disorder spread only slowly. The increasing prevalence rates can be explained by the increased knowledge about this disorder and the growing clinical experience. In contrast to the public that gives repeated medial attention to it, and to would-be affected who seem to see an attractive excuse for social problems in an Asperger diagnosis, many psychiatrists appear cautious to state a diagnosis with which they are not familiar and which is discredited as a fashionable diagnosis.\n\nPsychosocial Characteristics of Women with a Delayed Diagnosis of Turner Syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nReimann, Gabrielle E; Bernad Perman, Martha M; Ho, Pei-Shu; Parks, Rebecca A; Comis, Leora E\n\n2018-05-09\n\nTo characterize the psychosocial profiles of adult women diagnosed with Turner syndrome before (early diagnosis) and at or after (late diagnosis) 13 years of age. Women with Turner syndrome ages 22 and older at evaluation (nâ=â110) participated in a cross-sectional study at the National Institutes of Health. Researchers performed nonparametric and logistic regression analyses to assess early and late diagnosis cohorts on measures of depression, substance use, and perceptions of competence and identity. Of study participants, 47% received a Turner syndrome diagnosis at or after age 13 years. Median age at diagnosis was 12.0 years (range, 0-43). Covariate-adjusted models revealed that women with late diagnoses had an increased likelihood of developing mild to severe depressive symptoms (OR,â 7.36) and a decreased likelihood of being perceived as competent (OR,â0.26). Women with a late diagnosis also exhibited more frequent substance use compared with women with early diagnoses. These data suggest that Turner syndrome diagnoses received at or after age 13 years may contribute to adverse outcomes related to depression, substance use, and perceptions of competence. Delayed Turner syndrome diagnoses may place women and girls at risk for negative psychosocial development extending into adulthood. These findings indicate it is important for pediatricians to evaluate psychosocial domains in girls with Turner syndrome regularly, particularly among those diagnosed at age 13 years or older.

However, in clinical practice, there is complex and nonlinear relationship between symptoms (signs) and syndrome.

Different instruments for the diagnosis of burnout exist, accompanied by many associated problems, however. This paper describes a proposal aiming at supporting the diagnosis of burnout using measures complementary to the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). It specifically focuses on emotions detection to provide useful information that contributes to the decision making process about the syndrome.\n\nPearson Syndrome, A Medical Diagnosis Difficult to Sustain Without Genetic Testing.\n\nPubMed\n\nSur, Lucia; Floca, Emanuela; Samasca, Gabriel; Lupan, Iulia; Aldea, Cornel; Sur, Genel\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe detection of sideroblastic anemia in a newborn may suggest developing Pearson syndrome. The prognosis of these patients is severe and death occurs in the first 3 years of life, so it is important to find new ways of diagnosis. Case Presentation: In the case of our patient the diagnosis was supported only at the age of 5 months, highlighting the difficulties of diagnosis at this age. The diagnosis of Pearson syndrome with neonatal onset is difficult to sustain or even impossible at that age. This diagnosis can be confirmed and supported during disease progression.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFiocchi, Alessandro; Claps, Alessia; Dahdah, Lamia; Brindisi, Giulia; Dionisi-Vici, Carlo; Martelli, Alberto\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPurpose of review To assess all the possible differential diagnosis of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), both in acute and chronic presentation, reviewing the data reported in published studies. Recent findings There is an increase of reported cases of FPIES in recent years. As the disease presents with nonspecific symptoms, it can be misunderstood in many ways. The differential diagnosis includes, in acute presentations, the following: sepsis, other infectious diseases, acute gastrointestinal episodes, surgical emergencies, food allergies. In its chronic forms, FPIES may mimic malabsorption syndromes, metabolic disorders, primary immunodeficiencies, neurological conditions, coagulation defects, and other types of non-IgE-mediated food allergy. Summary A thorough clinical evaluation, including symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings, is necessary to lead the clinicians toward the diagnosis of FPIES. The major reason for delayed diagnosis appears to be the lack of knowledge of the disease.

Diagnosis in the adolescent is difficult due to the high background rate of menstrual irregularity, the high prevalence of polycystic ovarian morphology and hyperandrogenic features in this population. Recent guidelines suggest that menstrual irregularity for over two years, reduced reliance on ultrasound diagnosis of polycystic ovarian morphology, and accurate assessment of hyperandrogenic and metabolic features are suitable strategies for the diagnosis of PCOS in the adolescent. Accurate diagnosis is important given the long-term implications of the disorder, with increasing emphasis on metabolic sequelae. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Although the pathophysiology of the syndrome is complex and there is no single defect from which it is known to result, it is hypothesized that insulin resistance is a key factor. Metabolic syndrome is twice as common in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome compared with the general population, and patients with polycystic ovary syndrome are four times more likely than the general population to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patient presentation is variable, ranging from asymptomatic to having multiple gynecologic, dermatologic, or metabolic manifestations. Guidelines from the Endocrine Society recommend using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosis, which mandate the presence of two of the following three findings- hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries-plus the exclusion of other diagnoses that could result in hyperandrogenism or ovulatory dysfunction. It is reasonable to delay evaluation for polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescent patients until two years after menarche. For this age group, it is also recommended that all three Rotterdam criteria be met before the diagnosis is made. Patients who have marked virilization or rapid onset of symptoms require immediate evaluation for a potential androgen-secreting tumor. Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome is individualized based on the patient's presentation and desire for pregnancy. For patients who are overweight, weight loss is recommended. Clomiphene and letrozole are first-line medications for infertility. Metformin is the first-line medication for metabolic manifestations, such as hyperglycemia. Hormonal contraceptives are first-line therapy for irregular menses and dermatologic manifestations.\n\nRetrospective diagnosis of Kindler syndrome in a 37-year-old man.\n\nPubMed\n\nThomson, M A; Ashton, G H S; McGrath, J A; Eady, R A J; Moss, C\n\n2006-01-01\n\nKindler syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by acral blisters in infancy and early childhood, followed by photosensitivity, progressive poikiloderma and cutaneous atrophy. Other features include webbing of the toes and fingers, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, gingival fragility, poor dentition, and mucosal involvement in the form of urethral, anal and oesophageal stenosis. The recent finding of KIND1 mutations in Kindler syndrome facilitates early diagnosis, prophylactic measures and more precise definition of the phenotype. In the family described here, molecular diagnosis of Kindler syndrome in an infant with acral blisters led to the belated diagnosis in a severely affected relative whose condition had remained unidentified for 37 years.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nMagini, Pamela; Palombo, Flavia; Boito, Simona; Lanzoni, Giulia; Mongelli, Patrizia; Rizzuti, Tommaso; Baccarin, Marco; Pippucci, Tommaso; Seri, Marco; Lalatta, Faustina\n\n2016-12-01\n\nSimpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) is an overgrowth syndrome and it is usually diagnosed postnatally, on the basis of phenotype. Prenatal ultrasonography may show fetal alterations, but they are not pathognomonic and most of them are frequently detectable only from the 20th week of gestation. Nevertheless, early diagnosis is important to avoid neonatal complications and make timely and informed decisions about the pregnancy. We report on four fetuses from two unrelated families, in whom the application of whole exome sequencing and array-CGH allowed the identification of GPC3 alterations causing SGBS. The careful follow up of pregnancies and more sophisticated analysis of ultrasound findings led to the identification of early prenatal alterations, which will improve the antenatal diagnosis of SGBS.

A number of factors make receiving a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome in adulthood a unique experience. This study used a phenomenological approach to examine the experiences of 10 adults receiving such a diagnosis. Results suggested that six major themes were associated with receiving a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. Individuals discussed their negative life experiences and their experience of services prior to diagnosis, which led to individuals holding certain beliefs about the symptoms of Asperger syndrome. These beliefs had an effect on the formation of each individual's perceived self-identity. Participants made links between how they felt when they received the diagnosis and their current beliefs about both their ;symptoms' and themselves. Finally, participants highlighted the importance of the societal view of Asperger syndrome. The implications of these findings are reappraised in the context of previous research and the wider literature on identity formation.\n\nThoracic outlet syndrome: definition, aetiological factors, diagnosis, management and occupational impact.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaulan, Jacky; Fouquet, Bernard; Rodaix, Camille; Jauffret, Penelope; Roquelaure, Yves; Descatha, Alexis\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThoracic outlet syndrome is a controversial cause of neck and shoulder pain due to complex mechanisms involving muscular dysfunction and nerve compression. Although management of thoracic outlet syndrome must be based on a multidisciplinary approach, physicians and occupational therapist should be familiar with the principles of diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this article is to review the definitions, diagnosis and management of this syndrome. A particular emphasis was described on the links between the workplace and the individual in the pathogenesis, prevalence in the workforce and the course of this disease.\n\nThe diagnosis and lived experience of polycystic ovary syndrome: A qualitative study.\n\nPubMed\n\nTomlinson, Julie; Pinkney, Jonathan; Adams, Linda; Stenhouse, Elizabeth; Bendall, Alison; Corrigan, Oonagh; Letherby, Gayle\n\n2017-10-01\n\nTo explore the impact of the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome on health/ill health identity, how women experience this diagnosis and their health beliefs. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common and heterogeneous condition, giving rise to a wide range of different health concerns. Previous research on polycystic ovary syndrome has been dominated by the medical perspective and less is known about the experiences and needs of women. A qualitative study of 32 premenopausal adult women with polycystic ovary syndrome (diagnosis confirmed by Rotterdam criteria), aged between 18 and 45Â years, recruited from a primary and secondary care setting. Thematic analysis of transcripts from 11 focus groups conducted between 2013-2015. Women identified a range of concerns affecting personal and reproductive identity, health knowledge and beliefs: (1) delays and barriers to diagnosis; (2) general lack of empathy by the medical profession; (3) difficulty in accessing specialist referral; (4) lack of information from professionals; (5) inconsistent and sometimes unsatisfactory experiences with medications; (6) insufficient help and advice regarding in/fertility; (7) relative lack of awareness or concern about longer term risks such as diabetes; and (8) significant discrepancies between the beliefs of women with polycystic ovary syndrome and how they experienced the attitudes of healthcare professionals. There appears to be a divergence between women's experience and attitudes of healthcare professionals. The diagnosis, support and lived experience of women with polycystic ovary syndrome could be enhanced by better professional recognition of these concerns, improved knowledge and communication about polycystic ovary syndrome and better access to support and specialist advice.

Cases of BehÃ§et syndrome have been reported worldwide, but the highest prevalence occurs in countries that border the ancient Silk Route, such as Turkey and Iran. Although oral ulceration, genital ulceration and eye disease are the classic triad of manifestations, the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and central nervous systems can also be affected. The syndrome is chronic and relapsing with some patients having benign episodes whereas others have more serious complications, including blindness or the rupture of a pulmonary arterial aneurysm. Diagnosing BehÃ§et syndrome, particularly outside of endemic regions, often incurs a considerable delay owing to the rarity of this condition. Furthermore, a paucity exists of data from randomized controlled trials on the optimal therapeutic approaches to use in patients, as well as a lack of informative laboratory surrogate markers to monitor disease progression. This Review discusses the issues surrounding the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of BehÃ§et syndrome and presents the current approaches to managing patients with this complex group of disorders.\n\n[Visual diagnosis: Waardenburg syndrome].\n\nPubMed\n\nHager, T; Walter, H-S; Seitz, B; KÃ¤smann-Kellner, B\n\n2010-07-01\n\nWaardenburg syndrome (WS) is a rare disease characterized by a sensorineural hearing loss and pigment anomalies of the iris, skin and hair due to mutations in PAX3. WS can be subdivided into four groups according to major and minor clinical signs. We report the case of a 2 1/2-year-old coloured patient who presented in our department of paediatric ophthalmology for a syndrome search. The patient presented with hearing loss, brilliant blue iris colour and dystopia canthorum. The patient was slightly hypermetropic. Visual acuity was within normal limits according to the Cardiff acuity test. The ocular fundus examination revealed no abnormalities. According to the major and minor criteria defined by the Waardenburg consortium our patient showed the major criteria of WS1, i.e. hearing loss, hypopigmentation of the pigment epithelium of the iris and dystopic canthi. Diagnosis of WS is usually based on the clinical presentation. An additional molecular genetic analysis is possible.\n\n[Diagnosis and treatment of the most frequent vestibular syndromes].\n\nPubMed\n\nKanashiro, Aline Mizuta Kozoroski; Pereira, Cristiana Borges; Melo, Antonio Carlos de Paiva; Scaff, Milberto\n\n2005-03-01\n\nThe aims of this study were to identify the most common vestibular syndromes in a dizziness unit, and to observe their clinical aspects and response to treatment. Five hundred and fifteen patients were studied retrospectively in two institutions. Aspects of anamnesis, physical examination and the response to treatment were evaluated. The most frequent syndromes were: benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (VPPB) (28.5%), phobic postural vertigo (11.5%), central vertigo (10.1%), vestibular neuritis (9.7%), Meniere disease (8.5%), and migraine (6.4%). A good response to treatment was observed in most patients with migraine (78.8%), VPPB (64%), vestibular neuritis (62%), Meniere disease (54.5%) and vestibular paroxismia (54.5%). On the other hand, patients with downbeat nystagmus and bilateral vestibulopathy had poor response (52.6% and 42.8%, respectively). The diagnosis of these most frequent vestibular syndromes were established through anamnesis and physical examination (with specific clinical tests for evaluation of the vestibular function). The correct diagnosis and adequate treatment are important since these syndromes may have a good prognosis.\n\nThe diagnostic value of late-night salivary cortisol for diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuzu, Idris; Zuhur, Sayid Shafi; Demir, Nazan; Aktas, Gokce; Yener Ozturk, Feyza; Altuntas, Yuksel\n\n2016-01-01\n\nLate-night salivary cortisol is a frequently used and easily implemented diagnostically valuable test for the diagnosis of overt Cushing's syndrome. The use of late-night salivary cortisol in the diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome is somewhat controversial. In this study, we aimed to determine the diagnostic value of late-night salivary cortisol in diagnosing subclinical Cushing's syndrome and compare it with 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels (UFC). The study consisted of 33 cases of subclinical Cushing's syndrome, 59 cases of non-functioning adrenal adenoma, and 41 control subjects. Late-night salivary cortisol and UFC were measured in all the cases. The diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome was based on combined results of 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test > 1.8 Î¼g/dL and ACTH < 10 pg/mL. Mean late-night salivary cortisol levels in subjects with subclinical Cushing's syndrome were significantly higher than in subjects with non-functioning adrenal adenoma and the control group (p < 0.001). Using a cut-off value of 0.18 Î¼g/dL, the sensitivity and specificity of late-night salivary cortisol for diagnosing subclinical Cushing's syndrome were determined as 82% and 60%, respectively. Using a cut-off value of 137 Î¼g/day, the sensitivity and specificity of UFC was determined as 18% and 90%, respectively. Because the sensitivity of late-night salivary cortisol for the diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome is limited, using it as the sole screening test for subclinical Cushing's syndrome may lead to false negative results. However, using it as an adjunct test to other tests may be beneficial in the diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome.

According to present knowledge, Down's syndr ome can be classified cytogenetically into 4 groups: regular trisomy, translocational trisomy, mosaic forms and double trisomies. Knowledge of the karyotype is used in genetic counselling for further prevention of Down's syndrome in unborn fetuses. Prenatal chromosome analyses, a form of intrauterine diagnosis, has been used in Hungary since 1968. The average incidence of Down's syndrome has been estimated at 1.5:1000 among newborns. The mother's age and genetic deviations are determinant s in whether or not the syndrome will occur. The risk of Down's syndrome increases from 1 per 1000 in mothers under 30 to 10-20 per 1000 in mothers over 45. Since risk increases with the mother's age amniocen tesis should be routinely performed in pregnancies of older mothers. In the case of trisomy verified by intrauterine diagnosis, termination of pregnancy is advised. If population cytogenetic investigations are practiced, the carriers of the balanced translocation will be revealed and within a few years there will be only 3 indications for amniocentesis: 1) in cases of mother's advanced age, 2) in cases of bala nced translocation carrier and 3) in cases of a previously affected chil d disregarding the parental karyotypes. The expected risk of Down's syn drome predictable from available data if higher than 1-5% justifies intr auterine chromosome analysis.\n\n[Lemierre's syndrome: Diagnosis, exploration, treatment].\n\nPubMed\n\nMesrar, H; Mesrar, J; Maillier, B; Kraoua, S; Chapoutot, L; Delclaux, B\n\n2018-05-01\n\nLemierre's syndrome is a rare and severe sepsis that can rapidly lead to a life-threatening condition in the absence of early management. This syndrome described at the beginning of the 20th century combines oropharyngeal infection complicated with septic thrombosis of the internal jugular vein and septic emboli predominantly pulmonary. Fusobacterium necrophorum, anaerobic germ, Gram negative bacillus is the main germ in this \"necrobacillosis\". The diagnosis is should be confirmed precociously with cervicothoracic CT-scan, reference exam, and bacteriological examinations (especially in atypical forms). Its management consists of an emergency antibiotic treatment, combining a third-generation cephalosporin or a betalactam with metronidazole, anticoagulant therapy to be reserved for high-risk situations related to thrombosis.

Cushing's syndrome is a complex metabolic disorder that is a result of excess glucocorticoids. Excluding the exogenous causes, adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas account for nearly 70% of all cases of Cushing's syndrome. The suspicion, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis require a logical systematic approach with attention paid to key details at each investigational step. A diagnosis of endogenous Cushing's syndrome is usually suspected in patients with clinical symptoms and confirmed by using multiple biochemical tests. Each of the biochemical tests used to establish the diagnosis has limitations that need to be considered for proper interpretation. Although some tests determine the total daily urinary excretion of cortisol, many others rely on measurements of serum cortisol at baseline and after stimulation (e.g., after corticotropin-releasing hormone) or suppression (e.g., dexamethasone) with agents that influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Other tests (e.g., measurements of late-night salivary cortisol concentration) rely on alterations in the diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion. Because more than 90% of the cortisol in the circulation is protein bound, any alteration in the binding proteins (transcortin and albumin) will automatically influence the measured level and confound the interpretation of stimulation and suppression data, which are the basis for establishing the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. Although measuring late-night salivary cortisol seems to be an excellent initial test for hypercortisolism, it may be confounded by poor sampling methods and contamination. Measurements of 24-hour urinary free-cortisol excretion could be misleading in the presence of some pathological and physiological conditions. Dexamethasone suppression tests can be affected by illnesses that alter the absorption of the drug (e\n\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENTOF DUMPING SYNDROME AND ITS RELATION TO BARIATRIC SURGERY\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCHAVES, Yasmin da Silva; DESTEFANI, AfrÃ¢nio CÃ´go\n\n2016-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Introduction The dumping syndrome is frequent in bariatric surgery. It is probably the most common syndrome following partial or complete gastrectomy. Its prevalence in partial gastrectomy can reach up to 50%, thus it can be a significant complication arising from some types of bariatric surgeries. Objective: Critical analysis on dumping syndrome, its pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Methods: A literature review was performed using the key words: 'dumping syndrome', 'bariatric surgery' and 'rapid dumping syndrome'. Inclusion criteria were: books, original works, case reports and meta-analyzes, and the exclusion criterion was literature review. Concerning the publication time, articles were screened between 1960 and May 2015. Results: The dumping syndrome is complication arising from obesity surgeries, but also can be a result of vagus nerve damage. Diagnosis is done primarily through the use of questionnaires based on scores. Conclusion: The Sigstad score and Arts survey are valid means for assessing the dumping syndrome. Initial therapy consists in the adoption of dietary measures, short acting drugs administration.

However, the diagnosis of RLS in primary care remains low and mistreatment is common. Methods The current article reports on the considerations of RLS diagnosis and management that were made during a European Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (EURLSSG)-sponsored task force consisting of experts and primary care practioners. The task force sought to develop a better understanding of barriers to diagnosis in primary care practice and overcome these barriers with diagnostic and treatment algorithms. Results The barriers to diagnosis identified by the task force include the presentation of symptoms, the language used to describe them, the actual term \"restless legs syndrome\" and difficulties in the differential diagnosis of RLS. Conclusion The EURLSSG task force reached a consensus and agreed on the diagnostic and treatment algorithms published here.

When endogenous cortisol secretion is suspected, several screening tests are conducted in order to confirm or to rule out the diagnosis. In recent years, as the cut-off point of cortisol concentration on the 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test was lowered, the prevalence of Cushing's syndrome has increased, and more cases of mild syndromes, with negative results on one or more screening tests, have increasingly been reported. In this paper, we will describe the various screening tests used for Cushing's syndrome, and will discuss their degree of sensitivity in the diagnosis of mild cases. We conclude that, in cases of mild syndromes, the sensitivity of some tests appears to be notably lower than has been reported. Until recently, the major challenge has been to distinguish between pseudo-Cushing's states and Cushing's syndrome. Today, however, the challenge has become to avoid misdiagnosis of mild cases, presenting with normal results on some screening tests. The sensitivity of urinary free cortisol seems to be lower than previously reported. Therefore, we recommend not to rely solely on this test in ruling out Cushing's syndrome.\n\nSuccessful application of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for Leigh syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nUnsal, Evrim; AktaÅ, Yasemin; Uner, Ozge; BaltacI, Aysun; Ozcan, Sarp; Turhan, Feriba; Baltaci, Volkan\n\n2008-11-01\n\nTo perform preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for a SURF1 gene mutation of the Leigh syndrome to transfer unaffected or carrier embryo/embryos.

When there are alarm signs, they should be classified on an anatomical basis through anamnesis and physical examination. A significant group is of facet origin (lumbar facet syndrome [LFS]), but the precise clinical diagnosis remains cumbersome and time-consuming. In clinical practice it is observed that patients with an advanced degenerative disease do not perform extension or rotation of their lumbar spine when prompted to extend it, but rather knee flexion, making the manoeuvre meaningless. For this reason, a new simple and quick clinical test was developed for the diagnosis of lumbar facet syndrome, with a facet block-test as a confirmation. The new test is better than a classic one in the diagnosis of facet syndrome, and probably even better than imaging studies A prospective study was conducted on a series of 68 patients (01/01/2012-30/06/2013).

It is characterized by keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOT) in the jaw, multiple basal cell nevi carcinomas and skeletal abnormities. This syndrome may be diagnosed early by a dentist by routine radiographic exams in the first decade of life, since the KCOTs are usually one of the first manifestations of the syndrome. This article paper reports the case of a patient, a 10-year-old boy with NBCCS, emphasizing its clinical and radiographic manifestations.

We discuss this differential diagnosis in the context of a boy from a consanguineous union with Van den Ende-Gupta syndrome, a diagnosis initially confused by the atypical presence of intellectual disability. SNP microarray and whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous frameshift mutation (p.L870V) in SCARF2 and predicted damaging mutations in several genes, most notably DGCR2 (p.P75L) and NCAM2 (p.S147G), both possible candidates for this child's intellectual disability.

Highest prevalences were found in 40â-â59 year olds, in people with middle and high socio economic status and in women with low and men with high social support. Among the 12-month cases, 70.9â% had at least one DSM-IV disorder. Associations were found for the diagnosis of burnout syndrome with somatoform, affective and anxiety disorders. The diagnosis of burnout syndrome is less frequently given and reported than expected. People with a burnout diagnosis often have a manifest mental disorder.

Prenatal diagnosis of fetal syndromes is not straightforward, and it is a difficult puzzle that needs to be assembled and solved. Detection of one anomaly should always raise a suspicion of the existence of more anomalies, and can be a trigger to investigate further and raise awareness of possible syndromes. Highly specialized software systems for three- and four-dimensional ultrasound (3D/4D US) enabled detailed depiction of fetal anatomy and assessment of the dynamics of fetal structural and functional development in real time. With recent advances in 3D/4D US technology, antenatal diagnosis of fetal anomalies and syndromes shifted from the 2nd to the 1st trimester of pregnancy. It is questionable what can and should be done after the prenatal diagnosis of fetal syndrome. The 3D and 4D US techniques improved detection"
