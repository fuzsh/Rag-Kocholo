        "text": "IntroductionIn this paper, we consider the application a constraint satisfaction problem solving(CSP) framework recently developed for deadline scheduling to more commonly studiedproblems of schedule optimization. Our hypothesis is two-fold: (1) that CSPscheduling techniques can provide a basis for developing high-performance approximatesolution procedures in optimization contexts, and (2) that the representationalassumptions underlying CSP models allow these procedures to naturally...\n\nAbstract The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is considered as one of the difficult combinatorial optimization problems and treated as a member of NP-complete problem class. In this paper, we consider JSSPs with an objective of minimizing makespan while satisfying a ..."
