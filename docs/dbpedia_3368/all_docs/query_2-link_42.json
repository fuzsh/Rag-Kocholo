At that time FIFA had not yet restricted youth player’s international transfers.\n\nIn June 2002, he was signed by A.S. Roma, but in pure financial tricks to raise profit, which the net asset of the club was just increased in terms of player contract value. Eliakwu and Akande Ajide were exchanged with Daniele De Vezze and Fabio Tinazzi in co-ownership deal, all 4 were valued €2 million thus the 50% registration rights “worth” €1 million each. Tinazzi and De Vezze created false profit of €2 million and €1.93 million for Roma alone."
