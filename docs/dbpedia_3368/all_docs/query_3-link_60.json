        "text": "Destruction and reconstruction question (urge) architecture primarily on the possible ethical and then political role that the project can assume in dialogue with the city and its citizens for a reconstruction that is not only physical but, above all, moral and identity-oriented. This theme challenges architecture not only in the required content but also in expressive and communicative methods; no images – a favored tool of architecture – but measured words, precise sentences, concise thoughts that can reach everyone, conveyed through an instrument that is close to citizens: the radio. Two communicative experiments that link architecture to the radio are proposed here. Although united by an urgent, immediate expressive language aimed at addressing the whole community, they are located in two distinct historical moments.\n\nIn 1942, a young Bruno Zevi (Rome, 1918 - Rome, 2000), recently moved to New York and determined to continue his anti-fascist action, participated in a research program on shortwave radio broadcasts for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in New York1. The outcome of this collaboration, as well as his commitment to broadcasting his propaganda overseas, was translated into the realization of approximately 35 radio transmissions over almost a year and an activity that did not end with his American stay. The following year, Zevi received a significant assignment from the American Intelligence, leading him to move to London. In the English capital, forced to live as a refugee, he worked as a speaker on the “clandestine” radio Giustizia e libertà2, producing a series of broadcasts dedicated to Italy.\n\nA few years later, after the conclusion of the global conflict, Ignazio Gardella (Milan, 1905 - Oleggio, 1999) – a leading figure in a period known as “cultivated professionalism”3, he directed a certain way to do –, through a series of short, little-known texts, read on Radio Milano4 between 1945 and 1946, revealed a less evident side, compelled in this case to translate into words what he had previously expressed almost solely through architectural projects. These typewritten texts with titled Functions and forms of the city (Milan, June 20, 1945), The house in the city (Milan, August 1, 1945), and Functions of the city (Milan, February 13, 1946)5, in their necessary didactic synthesis, represent, in fact, the first written evidence of the Lombard architect’s critical stance. Transcending his personal professional experience, Gardella reflected aloud in those years on the themes of reconstruction in an Italy devastated by the global conflict that increasingly revealed a precise design for rebirth, primarily of an identity nature.\n\nIn a particular historical moment for our country and as testimony to this unique event that ties architecture, its dissemination beyond disciplinary boundaries, and the radio medium, the authors have chosen to present two translated typewritten texts by Bruno Zevi and Ignazio Gardella in chronological order.\n\nITALIAN COMRADES. BROTHERS. LISTEN6.\n\nAn Italian from America speaks to you, your blood and homeland brother.\n\nAs you heard in our commentary [deleted word] news, yesterday Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of the British Commonwealth, spoke to the Italian people.\n\nChurchill addressed us as he did to you, Italians — to each one of you listening at this moment in clear and precise terms.\n\nThe British Prime Minister, a fighter essentially both in the past in [deleted word] during the First World War and still today, presented a dilemma to us Italians that, before being political, is strictly military.\n\nIn short, Churchill said this: Italy is not fascism; rather, only the oppression of dictatorship has led the Italian people unwillingly [deleted word] against their will to the present state of affairs. We know that Italians do not love Mussolini, that they are tired of war, and rightfully fear the destruction of their cities. But the problem is clear: either the Italian people can separate their responsibilities from Nazism, or they are responsible for participating in the Nazi cause. Either the Italian people can free themselves from dictatorship, or they will have to suffer all the consequences that passive submission to dictatorship imposes.\n\nThe speech is precise; there is nothing rhetorical or pleasant for us Italians. It is, I repeat, a speech of war.\n\nFor us Italians who see things from the perspective of the Italian interior, the meaning of contemporary events may be different. But this depends on different attitudes, interests and feelings, and does not establish a fault on either side. [deleted phrase]\n\nThere was a time when the fortunes of war were exactly the opposite of what they are now. It was the time of the invasion of Poland, the fall of latin sister [deleted phrase] France, the betrayal of Mussolini towards the Latin sister, the assassination of Greece and Yugoslavia, the bombings of London7.\n\nThe dictators, having broken all the international bonds that alone could guarantee peace and having firmly prepared for war, had the hour — almost two years — of clear supremacy.\n\nNeither Hitler nor Mussolini ever made peaceful speeches and proposals to the people they were about to conquer.\n\nIf you have seen German films where Nazis flatten cities and machine-gun unarmed civilian populations, if you know the terrifying conditions in which the Polish people find themselves by order of the Berlin government, and the tragic conditions of hunger for the Greek people by order of the fascist regime — you understand that, now that the times and fortunes of war have changed, it is difficult to pretend that the treatment of the enemies of fascism towards fascism is much different from what the fascists had towards them.\n\nAnd fascist misdeeds are not over. The people of France crying FREEDOM, the people of Greece crying BREAD, thousands of Polish girls forcibly transported to Germany to become Nazi prostitutes, mountains of dead Russian children, tortured to death by the “heroic” deeds of the German invaders — millions of men in Europe waiting in fear for a new winter of famine and frost, the shadows of hundreds of hostages shot — the entire anti-fascist and revolutionary Europe, this outraged Europe, still cries today — and to the liberating armies of America and England approaching for the battle of Europe, they shout: VENGEANCE!\n\nFor those among you, Italian listeners, who have a sense of love for our country, for those among you who have heard faintly to discern the voices of Europe, of our prostrate and crushed Europe, it will not be difficult to discover — among the many cries and the many agonies — the cry and the agony of our Italy.\n\nYes! Even from the soil of eternal Italy rise the voices of freedom assassinated for twenty years, the voices of social oppression, of national independence sold to the Germans, after so much blood spread [added word] to conquer it, the shadows of the martyrs of the Risorgimento and the six hundred thousand dead of the great war whose cause and sacrifice have been tarnished by the fascist regime, and finally the voices of all the heroes of Italian anti-fascism, the 3000 men murdered by the fascists until 1926, the thousands of young workers, peasants, intellectuals condemned to rot for decades in the prisons of the oppressors of our people. Even from Italian soil rise, as from the soil of all suffering and dying Europe, the martyrs of the revolt and revolution against fascism, the shadows of Matteotti, Don Minzoni, Gramsci, Rosselli8 — these shadows of our great Italians, and to all the men and peoples who want freedom, who fight for freedom, who die for the freedom of Europe — they shout: VENGEANCE.\n\nTherefore, we Italians are neither more nor less in the same conditions as all the brother peoples of Europe: we are a people invaded and dominated by the fascist oppressor. I think there are few now who believe that Italy has a more privileged place than other countries conquered by Nazism, just because our dictator is of Italian blood.\n\nMoreover, my speech today is not addressed to that minority of intellectual imbeciles who have not yet understood that fascism is not a national phenomenon. That fascism is a form, a conception of society and life, to which dictators like Mussolini are capable of sacrificing even the national independence of the countries they dominate. NO: Today, I do not address the deluded, the sold out, or the foolish servants of the dictatorship.\n\nThe hour is too serious to waste time with people who were born slaves, who will always be slaves, who will always go where the wind blows, who will not even make the slightest impact on the history of humanity, and who, when they are dead, will be the same as if they had never been born.\n\nAfter Churchill’s speech and especially after yesterday’s terrible bombing of Turin, I address you, listener, to you, Italian brother, to you, woman, to you, especially young person who believed in good faith in fascism and who now sees the disaster of your homeland.\n\nTo all of you, comrades, who anxiously wonder: WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ITALY? To all of you who search amid the torments of the moment for your place in the struggle for a truer, higher Italy, for a just and free Italy, to all of you, I fraternally address myself in this heavy hour in the history of our people.\n\nEverything we have suffered and are suffering is nothing compared to what we will [deleted phrase] will have to [added phrase] endure. The bombings of the northern Italian cities are nothing compared to the destruction that will befall all the cities, all the ports, all the industries, all the warehouses of our country.\n\nThe dilemma is precise: there is a war between a fascist world and a world that rejects fascism. The forces of justice, the forces of freedom must win, win at any cost, at any price. At the cost of any sacrifice, fascism must disappear from the face of the earth if men and people want to live in peace.\n\nItaly will be bombed, destroyed, razed to the ground if necessary. It is heartbreaking, I know, to think about it; but it is a fatal law of our history [deleted phrase] today. Fascism is war, destruction, hunger, the murder of intellectual and social freedoms. We must fight even at the cost of many lives. The pacifist illusions are over; the fascist war must be answered with war. To the bombings of London, Coventry, Rotterdam, Warsaw, Moscow, and Stalingrad, we respond with the bombings of Cologne, Turin, Genoa, Milan.\n\nThere is only one alternative that can avert such disaster: IT IS THE ANTI-SEMITIC [added phrase] REVOLUTION. It is understanding that one does not betray Italy by going to the side of the adversaries, but rather fights for Italy by revolting against the fascist oppressors of our country. They, and only they — the fascists [added word] — are the true traitors of Italy: they are Mussolini, Ciano, Farinacci9 — they are all the institutions of the state that have supinely signed every act of crime of fascism — they are the sharks of heavy industry and the landowners who wanted war to make more money, Volpi, Agnelli, Vaselli, Donegani, Ansaldo, Torlonia, and many [deleted word] a few others. These will answer for their betrayals before the tribunal of the anti-fascist revolution of Italy. They were not fascists like many of you, between Fellini black shirt [added phrase] deluded in good faith. They never believed in fascism; but cowardly, they took advantage of it for their interests. A liberating revolution must be waged against them.\n\nIf this does not happen, all Italians, on a sad day, will discover what the fascist legacy is. Fascism did not only assassinate 20 years of Italian life; it destroys the effort of 50 years of democratic and free Italy: the railways, the industries, all the assets of our country.\n\nThere is no room for illusions. Either people understand the ultimate meaning of this war, which before being a war between nations, was a civil war between free men and slaves, or they are destined for suicide. The illusion of being able to remain alongside fascism without participating in its misdeeds and responsibilities must end [deleted phrase] is over. You saw it with the French fleet. The Vichy French10 — at least some of them — were in good faith, they truly believed in the possibility of cooperating with Hitler’s Germany preserving independence and honour [deleted phrase]. When they saw the breaking of the collaborationist illusion with fascism, they sank the fleet.\n\nArchitect Ignazio Gardella\n\nTHE HOUSE IN THE CITY11\n\nThe house -our house- is not merely a space enclosed by walls, covered by a roof; it is also family, friends, joys and sorrows of our most intimate life.\n\nToday, I will talk about certain urbanistic aspects12 of the house, understood as the dwelling of the humankind; yet, let us not to forget the metaphorical resonance of the term that broadens its initial technical meaning.\n\nThe house is one of the fundamental tools of our civilized living, a right and a duty for all of us as human beings.\n\nArchitects from every country have passionately worked and struggled, in this first half of the century, to ensure that the home of man13 was an instrument of life and not a false folkloric museum piece.\n\nA useful tool, precise, coherent with those civilizations that we are now painfully [deleted word] sorely14 recovering on a political level, but which was already present or anticipated on the planes of art and science.\n\nHowever, the achieved results remain isolated laboratory experiences, confined within the sacred walls, unknown or worse misunderstood outside of them.\n\nIf we want the housing issue to change to transition from this experimental phase, where it has been clarified for technicians, to the extensive developments demanded by reconstruction, it’s necessary for the problem to be clear to all citizens15.\n\nI believe that each one of us has finally understood that any human action, even the most intelligent, will ultimately be sterile if it doesn’t find active understanding among people.\n\nLet us try to break down the diaphragm that has formed between life and science, between life and art.\n\nWe architects don’t want to impose on you the new houses, the new city shapes that we love, we want you to love them too, and we want you to realize that only they harmonize, without sounding false, with the happiness toward which you strive to approach.\n\nWhat do we ask of the house?\n\nWe still ask of it, as the inhabitants of the Lombardy terremare16 [deleted phrase] as our distant ancestors, for shelter against the elements, a bed to sleep on, a fire to cook on.\n\nBut upon these unchanging basic needs have been overlaid with a web of more subtle material and spiritual needs that the house must satisfy.\n\nIn the house, we spend many hours of our day in that recreation of nervous forces, consumed by work, which is accomplished not only in the deep sleep, but also in reading, in conversation, in the internationally renowned “dolce far niente”17.\n\nOur wives live in the house; our children live, grow up, and are educated there.\n\nWe need spaces on a human scale, modernly equipped, rationally distributed without unnecessary waste.\n\nBut we also want, in our house, ample air and sunlight, we want to be able to rest, read, and chat without being annoyed by traffic noise, we want to see not just stones from the windows but trees and sky.\n\nTherefore, the problem of the house immediately arises – and so it must in fact arise – as an urbanistic issue: the house in the city.\n\nSpace on a human scale. Sunlight, greenery, silence. Happy men.\n\nWhat instead is the reality?\n\nThe bombings of August 194318 displayed, with tragically realistic cross-sections, all the misery hidden within the body of the city.\n\nDecrepit building organisms that have survived, against any logic of sound economics, solely due to an unjustifiable interweaving of private interests. Thousands of individuals mourn in them.\n\nThis moves our feeling of human solidarity.\n\nBut there is an even more striking indication of urban and social disorganization.\n\nHave you ever seen houses in the suburbs that still stand isolated in the middle of the fields?\n\nDue to an absurd adherence to random road layouts, whimsical property limits, and poorly conceived building regulations19, they turn their fronts to the north, raise huge [deleted word] dreary windowless walls toward the south. Instead of stretching out blissfully in the sun, they roll up -with so much free space- around enclosed courtyards where the air stagnates.\n\nThe harmonious courtyard, the intimate central element of the ancient palace, has degenerated into the dreary deep pit of modern rented houses.\n\nLet’s bring order to the city.\n\nLet’s finally abolish closed courtyards and arrange our houses in open constructions, with that constant orientation that gives every room the necessary insolation.\n\nLet's space them apart like rows of vineyards, as much space as necessary so that one does not cast a shadow on the other.\n\nLet’s convert the open land into gardens. Let’s plant trees. Let’s immerse the house in greenery.\n\nWe will finally breathe pure air. And our children will be able to play at the foot of the houses under their mothers’ eyes. We will have sports fields nearby for our recreation after work.\n\nLet’s free our houses from the busy streets.\n\nLet’s group them along quiet residential streets, in exclusively housing districts, equipped with all the necessary collective services and where no smoky and noisy industries arise.\n\nIt’s not utopia. It is merely order.\n\nNo new construction should be allowed outside of this human order.\n\nOur right to housing corresponds to our duty of intelligence and will.\n\nAnd what will we do with the old building fabric?\n\nIn the forthcoming conversations, you will be told how we can also work orderly in it to gradually transform it from the current house-speculation relationship to a house-human relationship20.\n\nThe town planner like the farmer works patiently [deleted word] with patience in the present for the future harvest.\n\nFrom Radio Milano 1/8/1945 [deleted phrase]"
