        "text": "Synopsis The neuroplastic effects of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury have recently become more evident, demonstrating underlying nervous system changes in addition to the expected mechanical alterations associated with injury. Interventions to mitigate these detrimental neuroplastic effects along with the established biomechanical changes need to be considered in the rehabilitation process and return-to-play progressions. This commentary establishes a link between dynamic movement mechanics, neurocognition, and visual processing regarding ACL injury adaptations and injury risk. The proposed framework incorporates evidence from the disciplines of neuroscience, biomechanics, motor control, and psychology to support integrating neurocognitive and visual-motor approaches with traditional neuromuscular interventions during ACL injury rehabilitation. Physical therapists, athletic trainers, strength coaches, and other health care and performance professionals can capitalize on this..."
