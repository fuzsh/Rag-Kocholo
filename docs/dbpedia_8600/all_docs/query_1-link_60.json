        "text": "An independent Ukrainian Orthodox church was created at a signing ceremony in Turkey on Saturday, formalizing a split with the Russian church it had been tied to since 1686.\n\nThe Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew I, signed the \"Tomos\" in Istanbul in front of clerics and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, forming the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.\n\nIt forces Ukrainian clerics to pick sides between the Moscow-backed Ukrainian churches and the new church as fighting persists in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russia-backed rebels.\n\n\"The pious Ukrainian people have awaited this blessed day for seven entire centuries,\" Bartholomew I said in his address.\n\nThe patriarch, considered \"first among equals\" in Orthodox Christianity, said Ukrainians could now enjoy \"the sacred gift of emancipation, independence and self-governance, becoming free from every external reliance and intervention.\"\n\nPoroshenko thanked Bartholomew I \"for the courage to make this historic decision\" and said that \"among the 15 stars of the Orthodox churches of the world a Ukrainian star has appeared,\" referring to the updated number of churches that don't answer to an external authority.\n\nLast month, Ukrainian Orthodox leaders approved the creation of a new, unified church split from the Moscow Patriarchate and elected 39-year-old Metropolitan Epiphanius I to lead it.\n\nBartholomew I's decision in October to grant the Ukrainian church autocephaly, or independence, infuriated Moscow and the Russian church severed ties with Istanbul, the center of the Orthodox world.\n\nKiev has been pushing for a church free from Moscow's influence, which intensified after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and amid the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nPoroshenko, president since 2014, has pushed for the creation of the church as he campaigns for the March 31 elections. Though the church is not formally part of the state, it is closely tied. Recent opinion polls suggest he is in second or third place in the race.\n\nPoroshenko met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan before the ceremony."
