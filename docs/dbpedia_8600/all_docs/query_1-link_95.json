        "text": "When Constantine moved the capital to Constantinople the Christian churches of Rome and Constantinople found themselves at odds. They ended up differing on many subjects. Over the years they gradually grew apart until the final split happened in 1054. This continues to today. The differences are slight but significant. The Roman church continued with using Latin as the official language, giving the Pope the ultimate authority, but not allowing priests to get married (Doc C). Whilst the Eastern Orthodox church decided to have Greek as the official language, instead of a Pope they had a ceremonial leader, also known as the Patriarch (who could marry); this is because Constantinople failed to see the Pope as the supreme authority. Their interpretation of the bible was also a bit different (Doc C). In the world there are about 120,845,374 people who worship Orthodox Christianity. Though there are many branches of it. Most of the religion stays in the Eastern side of the world, except the 5,000,000 or so Americans (Doc C). If it hadn’t been for the Byzantines stepping out\n\nAs shown in Document C: The World Fact Book, Eastern Orthodox Christianity still exists in the world. Russia is listed on the chart as having the world's highest Eastern Orthodox population. Greece is listed on the chart as having the highest percentage of Eastern Orthodox. In 2010, there were 250,000,000 Eastern Orthodox in the world. To this day Eastern Orthodox Christianity is still worshipped and people should know that this is all because of the\n\nAsk most people today if they have heard of Baptist and Catholic religion and most would say yes. In many ways the two are very similar. For instance, both are based on the Christian faith, belief in the trinity, and that God is the one true God. The two religions agree that Jesus died on the cross and rose again to atone for our sins. They share a 27 book New Testament and insist that salvation comes from Christ alone. On the other hand, while the Baptist and Catholic religions do have similarities, they also have differences, such as their services, communion, and views regarding salvation.\n\nOrthodox and Catholics perception on scriptures and tradition is different from Protestant perceptions. For example, Protestants believe that they don’t need any scared writings other than the Bible and other traditions and rituals are made by humans and not by God. On the other hand, Orthodox and Catholic Christians believe that they can come to know\n\nThe Russian Church arose after Christianity was introduced in the 9th century. Christianity was introduced in Kievan Rus, an East Slavic State, and was only accepted after the prince of Kiev was baptized. In the 17th century the church was known to be autocephalous after the bishops decided to elect their own patriarch. One of the chosen patriarchs, Nikon, managed to get involved in a very violent conflict with the Russian Tsar Alexis. The origin of the church led to all the bloodshed found in the history of this church.\n\nThe theological differences were some of the biggest reason why the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches split. The Eastern churches had theological roots in Greek philosophy and the Western churches had theologies that constructed on their Roman law (“Schism of 1054”, 2014, para. 3). A strong issue that the two churches had was the theological proposition of the placement and addition of “the Son” to the Roman creed. The Roman churches included the “Father and the Son” in the Nicene creed without consulting the Eastern church while the Eastern church only used the Father. The Orthodox Church believe it should have been written with “the Father” proceeded by the Holy Spirit.\n\nChristianity is broke in to three divisions Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant. In 1054 a major break in Christianity took place, giving birth too two major sects. The major sects were called Catholic and Orthodox. In the 16 century another split became, and that sect was called Protestant. The issue of religious authority continues to be a fundamental difference and perspective between the sects of Christianity. For example, the Pope was not acknowledged by the Orthodox as a worldwide supremacy. Comparison is the Catholic's religious structure cored around the Pope. Thus Christianity has multiple sects and is far more complex.\n\nThe Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox temples offer numerous center convictions with respect to Jesus Christ, including his celestial and human instincts, his virginal conception, his passing and resulting restoration, and his foreseen come back to earth. Both categories likewise perceive the teachings communicated in the initial seven ecumenical boards. At the foundation of the Great Schism between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox houses of worship was the routes in which the thought of the Trinity was communicated. While the Eastern Orthodox Church stressed the particular personhood of every individual from the Trinity, the Roman Catholic Church accentuated the Trinity 's solidarity of pith. The houses of worship additionally contrasted on the interminable virginity of Mary and additionally the way of unique sin.\n\nThough each religion is unique, some religions have several traits in common. For example, many religions are polytheistic, meaning that there are many gods. But, some religions only believe in one god, meaning that the religion is monotheistic. The religions also have many things that differ with each other, like the sacred text, symbol, and traditions. These qualities are what make each religion different and special.\n\nIn eastern religions it is common to worship more than one god. Eastern religions believe in polytheism, and polytheism is when someone believes in many gods. After death, Eastern religions believe in reincarnation. Reincarnation is the rebirth and spirit-matter distinction and is the liberation cycle of existence. In western religions only one God is worshipped. Western religions believe in monotheism. Monotheism is the belief of one God and it is the belief that only God has created the world and everything in it. After death, western religions believe in heaven. A similarity of eastern religions and western religions are that they both believe in an afterlife, although they do not believe in the same kind of afterlife. Another similarity is that both eastern and western religions have had a huge impact throughout history.\n\nWhen it comes to different religions within a marriage, there will be complications if communication between the couple is limited. They will have many issues unless they work out the differences in what they each practice. Orthodox Judaism is a religion that has evolved over time. Another sub religion that evolved from Orthodox Judaism is Reformed Judaism. There are similarities as well as differences between the two how they view the Torra. The observant Jew believes that Torah is the word of God. There are two types of laws in the Torah. Mishpatim are laws whose purpose is readily understandable in any civilized society, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, etc. Chukim are laws with no discernible practical reason."
