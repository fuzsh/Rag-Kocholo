        "text": "Brian McFadden-Dinicola prevails in matter involving an appeal to the New Jersey Superior Court Appellate Division regarding the final judgment of divorce, challenging alimony, child support, equitable distribution and counsel fee awards. This case involved the termination of a 22-year marriage, including two teenage children born of the marriage. Counsel McFadden-DiNicola represented the defendant-respondent and prevailed in both the trial level and appellate division, with the appellate court denying the plaintiff’s appeal and affirming the entirety of the trial court decision. Plaintiff’s claims for appeal were determined erroneous and the entire original verdict was upheld for our client.\n\nIf you would like more information, or are seeking counsel for Family Law, please do not hesitate to contact Brian McFadden-DiNicola at bmcfaddendinicola@hoaglandlongo.com, or call (732) 545-4717."
