        "text": "Brian hopes to work with the guys in the future and thinks there could be an opportunity when they aren't all so busy with their new careers.\n\nFormer bandmate Shane is releasing his first solo album 'You and Me' this November, Nicky has moved into TV and is presenting 'The Hit' alongside Aidan Power, while Mark is currently a coach on talent contest 'The Voice', Ireland.\n\nTalking on UK TV show 'Daybreak', Brian said: \"I would definitely love to do something with the guys one day.\n\nHe explained: \"I don't think it's going to happen for a long time, the boys are all going off on their solo ventures now.\"\n\nDespite his enthusiasm he insists he would never appear on reality documentary series 'The Big Reunion', which has seen several successful pop bands reform for tours.\n\nThe musician - who is married to Irish DJ and reality star Vogue Williams - said: \"I wouldn't [reunite], not for 'The Big Reunion' or something like that but I would love to do something with them again of course we used to have so much fun touring and singing together so I would never rule it out.\"\n\nBrian has released four well-received solo LPs, the most recent being 'The Irish Connection', and he insists he isn't worried about Shane's new music eclipsing his, as he is a fan of his single 'Everything to Me'.\n\nHe explained: \"I really like what he's doing. I wouldn't say there's competition because obviously we're in different times in our career, this is his first single out and it's all an exciting time for him, it feels like I've been doing it for a long time. We've got different styles as well at the moment and I think he's really creating his own sound.\""
