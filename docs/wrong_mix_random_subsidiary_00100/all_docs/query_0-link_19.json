My great grandfather was William (Smith ?) Burd. He was born in ?-?-1865, he lived in Muskegon, Michigan and family members have said that he was originally from Pennsylvania. He became a doctor and moved to Blind River, Ontario, Canada in 1898, got married there in 1901 (to Marie Argue), became the town's first resident doctor, medical officer and coroner. He died in 1916. A family friend told us he was adopted, but after that the trail went cold. His (adopted) parents were Francis Burd and Mary (nee. Brown) and I am uncertain where they are from. I have been searching for quite some time and have yet to find out where in the United States he is from and who his adopted and/or birth parents were and where they were from (country of origin, etc.). Could you tell me if he was from Pennsylvania ? Any way you could help me would be greatly appreciated.

His adopted name was Charles A, Geddes and the family resided in Philadelphia. We found the family on the 1880 census (His adopted father was Alexander Geddes and a plumber) My great grandfather Charles A. Geddes had a patent for the first seltzer machine. We did find the patent online. He must have learned his skill from his adopted Father Alexander (plumber). We believe he was adopted sometime between the 1870 census and the 1880 census as Charles A. Geddes was not on the census living with Alexander and Sarah Geddes in Philadelphia in 1870. In speaking to my Dad's second cousin, he remembers his Grandmother (Sarah Geddes, a child of Charles A. Geddes) telling him that her brother saw his Dad (Charles A. Geddes) birth mother in the neighborhood and that she was Irish and that her mother was born in Ireland. This means that the information on his birth mother was known by Charles A. Geddes' children. Charles A. Geddes married in 1889 Alice Grimes in Philadelphia and unfortunately she was admitted to a mental institution leaving Charles A. Geddes to raise the children (they had many. children (Jennie, Alice, Sadie, Rose, John, Charles J. (My grandfather), Anna and James. Chares A. Geddes spent many years after 1920 as a boarder living in New York. We don't know the year he died but believe it was after 1940 and before 1950. We were also told by my Dad's second cousin that his funeral was at St. Raymond's in the Bronx, New York. The latest info we were able to find is that he was listed as a boarder on the 1940 census living in the Bronx.\n\nDate Received: 3-30-2018\n\nDate Posted: 3-31-2018\n\nLast Updated: 3-31-2018 Adoptee Birth Date: ?-?-1872 to ?-?-1874 ?\n\nAdoptee Gender: Female\n\nAdoptee Birth Race: White\n\nName given to Adoptee by Birth Parents: Julia Sweeney\n\nAdoptee Birth City: Philadelphia, ?

Birth father was around 27 years old. Julia was extremely short, under 5'0\" tall and very slender in build. She probably had brown eyes and brown hair, The story was this: Julia's birth mother died within six months of her birth. Her birth father then died within a year or two. That is why she was adopted.\n\nDate Received: 7-23-2019\n\nDate Posted: 7-24-2019\n\nLast Updated: 7-26-2019 Adoptee Birth Date: ?-?-1876 ?\n\nAdoptee Gender: Male\n\nAdoptee Birth Race: White, German descent ?\n\nName given to Adoptee by Birth Parents: ?\n\nAdoptee Birth City: ?, PA\n\nAdoptee Birth County: ?\n\nAdoptee Birth State: Pennsylvania\n\nAdoptee Birth Country: USA\n\nAdoptee Birth Mothers Name: ?\n\nAdoptee Birth Mothers Maiden Name: ?\n\nAdoptee Birth Mothers Race: ?\n\nAdoptee Birth Fathers Name: ?\n\nAdoptee Birth Fathers Race: German descent ?\n\nAdoptee Birth Hospital: ?\n\nAdoption Agency or Attorney: ?\n\nAge of Adoptee when Adopted: ?\n\nName given to Adoptee by Adoptive Parents: William Koons Rey (Deceased)\n\nCity adoption took place: ?, PA\n\nCounty adoption took place: ?\n\nState adoption took place: Pennsylvania ?\n\nCountry Adoption took place: USA\n\nAdoptive Mothers Name: Anna (Deceased)\n\nAdoptive Mothers Maiden Name: ?\n\nAdoptive Fathers Name: Albert B Rey (Deceased)\n\nEmail Address: kunjirey@gmail.com\n\nSearching For: My Great Great Grandfathers Birth Family Lineage, Genealogy Records.\n\nAll Other Information: I am searching for my great great grandfathers family lineage\n\nDate Received: 5-11-2013\n\nDate Posted: 5-31-2013\n\nLast Updated: 5-31-2013\n\nAdoptee Birth Date: 8-24-1876\n\nAdoptee Gender: Female\n\nAdoptee Birth Race: White\n\nName given to Adoptee by Birth Parents: ?\n\nAdoptee Birth City: Wysox, PA or North Orwell, PA ?\n\nAdoptee Birth County: Bradford County ?\n\nAdoptee Birth State: Pennsylvania\n\nAdoptee Birth Country: USA\n\nAdoptee Birth Mothers Name: ?\n\nAdoptee Birth Mothers Maiden Name: ?\n\nAdoptee Birth Mothers Race: White\n\nAdoptee Birth Fathers Name: ?\n\nAdoptee Birth Fathers Race: White\n\nAdoptee Birth Hospital: ?\n\nAdoption Agency or Attorney: ?\n\nAge of Adoptee when Adopted: ?\n\nName given to Adoptee by Adoptive Parents: Georgia E.

Ancestry has her birthplace listed as a Wysox, but her death certificate lists her birthplace as North Orwell, PA. Her death certificate also states she was born on 8-24-1881 in North Orwell, PA, but Ancestry states she was born on 8-24-1876 which was five years earlier. A census from 1880 stated that she was 3 years old at the time the household was questioned, so I suspect that the actual birth year is 1876. I have a picture of her adoptive mother, Frances Tuttle Cass, and the studio where the photo was taken was located in Myersburg, PA. My paternal grandmother's adoptive father, Anson Benjamin Cass, was definitely from New York State. Both adoptive grandparents died in Schenevus, NY in 1921 (Frances) and 1926 (Anson). They were married in 1866. Frances was 19 years old at the time of their marriage. They remained childless until they adopted my grandmother, Georgia E. in 1876. I tried repeatedly over the last 45 years to obtain information about my paternal grandmother for whom I was named. My parents passed away when I was in my late teens within a few months of each other. My father only knew that his mother was adopted and we visited some of the Cass family in the early 1960's. I remember a lake with cottages and a riding stable that a cousin named Emory or Ellery Cass owned and it was called Lake 'O Meadows somewhere in upper NY state. Another cousin's name was Phoebe Cass. My grandmother passed away on 3-24-1926 in Oneonta, NY, according to the death certificate. At the time, she was married to my grandfather, James Homer Douglass and they resided in Schenevus, New York, Delaware County. I have her marriage book stating that she was living in Schenevus, NY, on the date of her marriage, 9-23-1908, to my paternal grandfather, James Homer Douglass, from Davenport, NY.! My father, Carlyle Benjamin, was their only child and only 15 years old when she died in 1924. Please contact me at any time, if you think I can provide more information. I submitted my DNA testing kit to Ancestry and the company received it last week. Thank you for any assistance you can provide regarding my biological grandmother's background.

In one instance he said he was born in Burnside, PA. On census forms he lists his place of birth as PA, Iowa, PA & PA, from 1900-30. In 1930, he said his father was born in MO and mother in PA - not sure if this is for his birth parents. His actual place & date of birth are unknown. He was told he was left with a note reading, \"please take care of our little Harry.\" Harry tried to track down his birth family for the whole of his life, and at one time believed he'd found them. He believed the last name started with an \"H\" and the family had moved to Texas after leaving him, then back up north at some time later. They had older children living with them. We aren't sure if this was the correct family. We don't know the date of his adoption, but do know he thought he was in an orphanage in Northern Missouri, or Southern Iowa. Harry married Laura Sumner and they had 8 children. Harry worked as a policeman for many years. One of his nicknames was 'shorty.' His adoptive parents had 3 biological children, 2 living as of the 1900 census. (Update) Harry's date of birth, according to his WWI draft card registration was 8-22-1883, which is different from other records stating 8-22-1884. Since he filled out the card in his own hand, I believe he may have actually been born on 8-22-1883\n\nDate Received: 3-19-2014\n\nDate Posted: 3-22-2014\n\nLast Updated: 1-29-2015 & 3-22-2014 Adoptee Birth Date: ?-?-1884 ?\n\nAdoptee Gender: Female\n\nAdoptee Birth Race: White, Irish descent\n\nName given to Adoptee by Birth Parents: Luna B.

I always thought I was a Harman but after DNA test at 23&me, I don't match any of them. Also, on Gedmatch, I match no Harman's on there either. Annie Brooks married John Harman who was a servant of Fred Brooks. They all lived in Tivoli, PA for a while, I think. I just found that out and am going over there to look for churches that might have some information. Later the Harman's moved to Muncy on Glade Run where they kept a farm for many years. My grandfather was supposed to be John D Harman but he is not according to what I've been able to deduce. I'm thinking my grandmother had a liaison with someone which produced my bio mother who had me I guess.

Horn was my grandfather. He was adopted from the Friend's Home in Philadelphia. PA in the early 1900's. From what I have been told the home burnt down along with the records. I did find information on the people that adopted him to work on their farm in Dover, DE. and in the census report he was listed as a boarder. Not a son. He always used to tell me he wasn't a Raughley but was more like an indentured servant. My grandfather worked on the Raughley farm in Dover Delaware. He came from the home in Philadelphia via steam boat into Lebanon, Delaware. He arrived wearing a tag around his neck with his information. The Raughley farm was located on part of what is now Dover Air Force Base. He also dropped the \"e\" on the end of his last name as he was teased. My grandfather never drank alcohol or swore so he took great offense when he was called \"Hornie\". Ernest Burton Raughley 12-10-1878 – 7-24-1972 Buried in Denton, MD. 1920 Census: address was Ritten Hammock Rd. Dover, DE Ernest was 41. Eva 38. My grandfather was 19. He also had a brother, Carl Stallings that was adopted by a family in North Carolina. William Carl (Carl Alfred Snyder Horn) Stallings 2-17-1903 • Pennsylvania 2-15-1972 • Harrington, Kent, Delaware. I remember my Great Uncle Carl and how he found out he had a brother and came to Delaware to find him. He then ended up marrying my Grandmother's sister, Sadie. So sisters married brothers.

In 1918, he enlisted in the Army as Harold Nelson. Mother Gertrude Lucille Simons b. 1874 in PA. She was living in Swedish Township Potter Co, PA in 1900, 8 months before Harold was born, with her brother and his wife. Harold died 8-10-1944 of TB as Harold Nelson; don't know if he was legally adopted by E. Nelson, but no marriage cert is found for Gertrude Simons to Rice, just a reference to Rice on her marriage cert to Nelson in 1905; says it was her second marriage. It isn't just a matter of geneology, but our family is shocked to find out our lineage is Rice, not Nelson. It was kept a secret by Gertrude until her death in 1957-8. As far as we know, Harold was an only child to Gertrude, but did he have brothers/sisters by father named Rice? Harold married Helen Sutherlin and had 3 children: Richard, Yvonne & David (my dad).

My brother and I would also like to have any potential family medical information because of health issues that he and I have both had. We understand that there was a fire in the Veil Maternity Hospital and all records were lost. Donald's birth record number is 77022, Commonwealth of PA. Donald Perry lived in Cornwall, NY most of his life and still lives there. He may have originally been taken to NJ after adoption but the family moved to Cornwall, NY in a relatively short time. I can confirm that information and will post it. Of less know information, my father believes that the birth mother and birth father were students at either the University of PA or Penn State.

(It became legal, per court decree, on 11-9-1931.) His biological mother had the surname of “Spaulding.” I don’t yet know her first name. She was a young Roman Catholic girl, age 23 years old, unmarried, and worked as a school teacher. Per documents I have, she stood 5’5” tall, and weighed 130 lbs., with brown eyes and brown hair. She had two brothers. At the time of birth, one was an attorney and the younger brother was in law school. Her father was in the newspaper business. She gave birth to my father at the “Veil Hospital for Unwed Mothers” located in West Chester, Pennsylvania. She named my father James Spaulding. Her one major requirement for the adoption was that the couple be Roman Catholic. My grandparents, Lester and Eileen Swicker, adopted my father and named him Richard Kerwin Swicker, and raised him in New Jersey. My father’s biological father had the surname of “Thomas.” He was 32 years old at the time, had blue eyes and reddish brown hair. Couldn’t tell his height, but documents show he weighed 185 lbs.

Her mother died in childbirth with another child one or two years after my mother was born. Charlotte's father, Walter Dilone, placed her with The Jewish Home For The Friendless where she lived for a few years, I am told, before being adopted by Abraham and Victoria Kline. Dr. Aaron S. Cantor was the head of the home at the time. Charlotte's father disappeared after placing her. She was never able to locate him. At some point the Klines returned Charlotte to the Jewish Home, where she remained until she became pregnant as a teenager. She was then sent to a home for unwed mothers, where she gave birth to a daughter she named Cheryl Lee Garrity. Cheryl was adopted by Samuel and Sarah Sturim. They changed her name to Paula Sturim. Paula died in 9-?-1997 without ever meeting Charlotte, but they were in communication with one another. Charlotte got sent away from the home after she had the baby and, with no where to go, she married a man named Bernie Polakoff, whom she later divorced. She later married William Mattingly and lived in Arlington, VA for about 50 years. I am looking for any information about what happened to Walter Dilone. I am also looking for the name of the home for unwed mothers Charlotte was sent to. I am trying to get a better picture of my mother's life. Charlotte is my mother. Charlotte has passed away, as has Paula, the Klines, and to my knowledge, the Sturims and Paula's birth father. (Update) Charlotte was adopted by Abraham and Victoria Klein 4-?-1940. The adoption papers show Charlotte's father's name as Morris Dillon. The daughter Charlotte placed for adoption, Cheryl Lee Gerrity, was born 10-1-1949 at The Staten Island Hospital. That would have put her in a home for unwed mothers in the possibly 6 months up to the birth. Margaret Gleason died 10-9-1932 at the West Side Hospital.

(Update) I am 90%+ sure I found my mother's birth-mother's family using DNA testing. Either the birth mother or the Veil listed the birth-mother's surname as Stuart. It was, in fact, Stunkard. I am continuing to look for Mom's birth-father's family. I know which large Colonial family she belongs to, but not his name -- not yet. I am continuing to pursue DNA testing.\n\nDate Received: 4-9-2014\n\nDate Posted: 4-10-2014\n\nLast Updated: 6-3-2015 & 7-16-2014 & 4-18-2014 Adoptee Birth Date: 7-3-1931\n\nAdoptee Gender: Female\n\nAdoptee Birth Race: Caucasian\n\nName given to Adoptee by Birth Parents: Gladys Cram\n\nAdoptee Birth City: West Chester, PA\n\nAdoptee Birth County: Chester County\n\nAdoptee Birth State: Pennsylvania\n\nAdoptee Birth Country: USA\n\nAdoptee Birth Mothers Name: ?\n\nAdoptee Birth Mothers Maiden Name: ?\n\nAdoptee Birth Mothers Race: Caucasian ?\n\nAdoptee B"
