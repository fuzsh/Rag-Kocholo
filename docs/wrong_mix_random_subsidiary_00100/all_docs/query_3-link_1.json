        "text": "–\n\nHello Friends & Farm-ily,\n\n–\n\nHappy Summer Solstice everybody! It’s the first official week of summer – hurrah! And it was also a full moon last night – the strawberry full moon – such magical mystical happenings all around.\n\n–\n\nJackson update: He’s separated from the herd and doing much better! Last week we had the vet as well as the local hoof trimmer. He’s basically been on bed rest and we’re seeing some signs of improvement – much more solid movement. Keeping our fingers crossed. It’s looking like a long road ahead but he’s mobile and we couldn’t be more thankful.\n\n—\n\nThis time last year farmer Brian was building our coolbot cooler and with the crazy list that June brings we can hardly believe that was actually happening. Necessity is the mother of all invention though and when you’re experiencing the hottest spring and summer ever you do what you gotta do. Now we can’t imagine farming with out it! This summer we have a few pretty big projects lined up. Our first on the list is to build two 30×96 high tunnels. Earlier this Spring we received a grant through the NRSC’s High Tunnel Initiative that will fund this project and will allow us to grow even more through the winter months under covered space which is coveted on the farm. Having any bit of insurance when you’re working with nature, the elements and everything in between really helps to mitigate risk. Exciting times! The materials arrived last week so we hope to start putting posts in the ground in the next few weeks.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nIn the meantime, our propagation greenhouse is filling up again! Over the weekend we began seeding kale, collards, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, romanesco etc for the Fall season. As well as transplanting another round of broccoli, lettuce, onions, pac choi etc. Farmer Brian has been busy prepping beds for fall and winter carrots and other root crops.\n\n–\n\nWe’ve had a lot of success with carrots this year mostly in part to integrating new systems on the farm (#growingbetter). One of our biggest variables on the farm is weed pressure. It’s hard to keep up with the newly germinating weeds (especially with direct seeded crops) which lead us to flame weeding last season. Stale seed bedding and flame weeding have been integral to our success with direct seeded crops like carrots. Carrots can take 8-21 days to germinate (i.e. emerge from the soil) and in that time 4-5 successions of weeds have already emerged and have a jump on the carrots. This is where the two methods come in to rescue us from a lifetime of hand weeding and sadness and lots of carrots for our CSA members.\n\n—\n\nWe start with stale bedding:\n\namending/spreading fertilizer and compost, tilling the soil and making the beds,\n\nsetting up overhead irrigation and watering the beds to germinate weeds\n\nWait 5-10 days\n\nSeed carrots into the weedy beds – plant a handful of beet seeds at the top of the bed. Since beets always germinate a few days before carrot seeds you use the beets as your sign to flame weed. Once the beets come up it’s time to flame the bed before the carrots emerge!\n\nFlame! It is not necessary to burn the weeds. The flame only needs to overheat the tissues and rupture the cells of the plants (weeds).\n\nCarrots emerge and they have way less competition to grow up and be delicious carrots!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nSo far we’ve had success with these two methods! Before we incorporated this system into our direct seeding plan the newly seeded bed would turn into a carpet of weeds (pigweed, amaranth, grass, bind weed, thistle) before the crops even had a chance. Now that we’re flaming, a little handweeding/wheelhoeing once a week on these beds and we will be able to keep up with the crops. In new (sometimes scary or overwhelming) situations, when it comes down to it, you just have to trust yourself and try something new and trust that it will all work out for the best! For those interested, here’s an article on Flame Weeding from Growing for Market\n\n–\n\nThere are many steps to getting any projects done on the farm but we’ve found the more thoroughly and thoughtfully you go about it the less backbreaking work you have to go through in the end. When you have many stones in the fire though it’s easy to miss a step (and instantly regret it). It’s a fine balancing act! These steps definitely give us hope though that things will only continue to get better as we work smarter, not harder.\n\n–\n\nWe’re excited to say that we’ve harvested most of the garlic out of the field. We have 1,200 bulbs to go and we’ll be finished for the 2016 season. All of the garlic is curing in the barn (proper curing is integral for long term storagability!). As some of you may remember the rust came through last year and stunted our crop of garlic leaving us with pretty puny bulbs and no seed garlic to plant in the Fall. This year we utilized the stale seed bed and flaming methods mentioned above (farmer brian actually flamed the beds multiple times over a 2 month period) ensuring that we would keep the beds free of weeds and healthier garlic! Sure enough this season they were a lot happier. The rust still came in on the breeze but it was far later this year well after they sent up scapes which meant they were way more established and well on their way to being harvested!\n\n–\n\nHurrah! Growing better for the win!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nPastured Pork! With the coming of summer it’s officially grilling season! We have over 10 different kinds of pastured pork sausages available on the WHF Online Farmstore as well as many other beautiful cuts of pork. We slow cooked some pork shoulder butts over night and had the most amazing pulled pork sandwiches the days to follow. Be sure to check out our farmstore here: http://workinghandsfarmstore.com/collections/all! All orders can be conveniently picked up on your CSA pick up day.\n\n–\n\nThe sowing, flaming, prepping, weeding and seeding continues this week… not to mention the harvest – ohhhh the harvest… all 3,000lbs for our amazing members! Here we grow week 6! Keep cool out there and enjoy the first official week of summer!\n\n–\n\nWith kind regards,\n\n–\n\nYour Farmers\n\n–\n\nJess & Brian –\n\ndirty hands, clean hearts\n\n–\n\n–\n\nthe first tomatoes are forming, all the different varieties of garlic that we’re growing this season & the first basil!\n\n–\n\nHi Friends & Farm-ily,\n\n–\n\nWe hope you all have been enjoying the delicious Spring veggies as we roll into our second month of harvest! We can hardly believe how quickly the time passes between one harvest week to another. We’ve been extra bee-zy this weekend taking care of the farm and have been gearing up to ceremoniously begin sowing seeds for our Fall succession of crops. Does anyone else think June is just flying by… ?\n\n–\n\nTwo farmers, One farm. In 4 weeks of harvest we’ve distributed 9,600lbs of produce to our members! All of that produce has been grown thoughtfully and prepped, seeded, transplanted, weeded & harvested by 2 sets of hands (each and every berry was picked by farmer Jess or farmer Brian). With the shares getting a touch more bountiful with summer crops, that puts us on track to grow and distribute over 80,000lbs of produce for the Spring/Summer/Fall season. It’s a pretty amazing number and we look forward to harvesting the bounty over the next 6 months. **Last year on Week 5 we had distributed 8,400lbs of produce, two years ago at this time we had distributed 6,800lbs of produce and three years ago at this time we had distributed 2,100 lbs of produce to our members which means your farmers are growing better with each passing season. This is our 7th season running the CSA and every year it just gets better and better.**\n\n–\n\n–\n\nThe new pole barn is getting close, the summer squish have arrived and the potato patch looking good!\n\n–\n\nSince our last harvest day we managed to plant another ¾ of an acre! A few miles of melons, winter squash & pumpkins. We even managed to plant a third succession of corn. We sure were bushed at the end of the day on Friday and Saturday – even more than normal. I think we headed to bed around 9:30pm which was amazing. We also begun harvesting our garlic crop and it looks amazing! We’ll get the rest of it in the barn this weekend so it can cure and dry in order to enjoy it all season long! Wahoo!\n\n–\n\nWe’ve been making major progress on our new WHF wash, pack & storage building! Concrete is going in this week and insulation the following. This building will enable us to expand our winter CSA by providing us with temperature controlled environment for long term storage of root crops. Our ultimate goal is to offset our summer work load by increasing our revenue in the winter. Maybe with time we can have an equitable distribution of work throughout the year. You know, cool it on the workends and tryout a weekend every once and a while. ‪#spaceisthefinalfrontier\n\n–\n\n–\n\nWHF Share 4, some beautiful romaine lettuce heads, and fennel starting to bulb out!\n\n–\n\nThe summer solstice, the longest day of the year, is just a week way and we certainly feel all the energy as we’ve been up with the sun at 20 past 5 and heading in at sunset around 9:30. We’ve been getting better at taking breaks during the hottest times of the afternoon/early evening to make dinner and get back out in the fields at 7 for a few hours. We call 7-9pm the “magic hours” here on the farm… from the low, glimmering sunlight to the cooler breeze – it’s just such a joy to be out in the garden. The animals love it too – they’re all out there filling their bellies – in the settling of the day – before perching or laying down for the night. On the farm, we’re all ready to hit the hay hard by the end of the evening.\n\n–\n\nBesides the long days, June is also an incredibly busy time in the garden (perhaps one of the busiest of the year). It’s a balancing act between maintaining Spring crops, weeding, sowing summer successions, watering, weeding, preparing stale seed beds, trellising tomatoes and beginning to seed all our fall brassicas (kale, collards, broccoli, cauliflower etc) and root crops (carrots, parsnips, storage beets etc) to name a few. There is much to be done and the list is ever long but we are focusing on the daily tasks at hand. We are being mindful and supportive, patient and encouraging. The simplest thing we can do for each other as farmer’s (and as a husband-wife team) is to remind each other of all the things we have accomplished and try not to worry too much about the things that remain on the list. The balancing act continues..!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nGarlic harvest commences, checking in on the pepper patch & Rosie cools off in the heat by wading in her wallow..\n\nSo, happy early summer solstice to you all. We hope you all find yourself enjoying all that summer has to offer. Take time for yourselves, keep being inspired in the kitchen and filling your tummies with delicious food.\n\np.s.

Ms. Mary Oliver and ‘The Summer Day’…\n\n–\n\nThe Summer Day\n\nby Mary Oliver\n\n–\n\nWho made the world?\n\nWho made the swan, and the black bear?\n\nWho made the grasshopper?\n\nThis grasshopper, I mean—\n\nthe one who has flung herself out of the grass,\n\nthe one who is eating sugar out of my hand,\n\nwho is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down—\n\nwho is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.\n\nNow she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.\n\nNow she snaps her wings open, and floats away.\n\nI don’t know exactly what a prayer is.\n\nI do know how to pay attention, how to fall down\n\ninto the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,\n\nhow to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,\n\nwhich is what I have been doing all day.\n\nTell me, what else should I have done?\n\nDoesn’t everything die at last, and too soon?\n\nTell me, what is it you plan to do\n\nwith your one wild and precious life?\n\n–\n\n–\n\nHi Friends & Farm-ily,\n\n–\n\nWe hope you all made it out of the blistering hot heat wave we’ve had the past 4 days. PHEW… we almost forgot what 100 degrees feels like! The sun was so oppressive and we were in full triage mode just trying to keep everything (the farm, the critters, the veggies) happy. Sometimes I look back on newsletters from years past to see what was going on at this time the previous year. Last year’s week 4 share newsletter was called Beat the Heat. . featuring the abnormally hot temperatures we had during the start of June (sound familiar this year?) Overall, it’s been a much more ‘mild’ Spring season (and a lot more precipitation) than last year but the hot Summer season’s do appear to be coming earlier and earlier in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n–\n\nThe Spring avalanche is challenging for small farmers everywhere and when you add extreme heat it feels like you’re in full survival mode. Like you’re not really even a person anymore – just a hot sweaty ball of a human, with heavy legs. We’ve been running (in my mind.. but slogging in real time) around making sure all the crops have cool roots and are well watered. Same for all the critters. We are also adjusting to our summer schedules to begin work by 5:00am and come in during the hottest part of the day to reenergize, hydrate, prepare dinner and maybe even take a 15 minute recharge nap (or, write the newsletter!) – it’s just too darn hot from 3-5pm to be doing manual labor. If there’s a lot of planting and tilling and seeding to be done we’ll often go back outside after 6 and work until 10:00pm or so. The hours in the day when the sun is the least oppressive. That can make for a pretty long work day – upwards of 15-16 hours. In these temps everything is serious. If you want to keep a crop you make sure it has what it needs or you lose it. If you don’t want to finish a task well too bad, you get it done because the heat has no sympathy for the garden. –\n\n—\n\nIn the midst of this last heatwave I started to have flashbacks to last season. As many of you know, last season was our hottest we’ve experienced to date (The Only Way Out is Through, When the Farm Farms You, The Hump, Variable Quandary) and even though most of the time spent outside in the oppressive heat was truly a grin and bear it type situation we also learned a lot through that experience. Since then, we’ve implemented better irrigation systems, weeding systems, planting systems in order to minimize plant stress and have worked hard at establishing better time management … with the heat you have a much smaller window to get done everything you need to get done so it forced us to really begin exploring better systems and ways to manage all the things that the two of us manage. We also launched our first ever Winter CSA which gave us a much greater perspective on the growing season as a whole. We’ve seen plants live through deep freezes and 110 degree day heat – the extremes – the highs and lows – and the resilience and adaptiveness of both the plant and the farmers. Necessity is the mother of invention. It took a lot of effort and time to see these successes through and we’re learning all the time. Some risks are bigger than others and we feel more prepared than ever – if it turns out to be another scorcher of a summer – we’ll be way better prepared than we were last year and have a much better expectation and healthier way to manage it all.\n\n–\n\nAdding to the heat wave chaos, Jackson, our bull/sire was badly injured earlier this week. After being separated for months (in order to keep a strict breeding schedule), Jackson finally met up with the rest of the herd a few days ago to begin the breeding with our mama cows. In the midst of all the excitement (the mounting, the reintroductions to the herd, the jousting etc) within 24 hours or reintegration, he has badly injured his back. A completely freak accident that puts a knot in our stomachs. Our Vet believes he has nerve damage and most likely fell while dismounting one of our cows. At the moment he can barely walk and when he does his hind legs give out. It’s heartbreaking to watch. To see an animal that is so emblematic of power become so weak is heart breaking. Not to mention that we have come to really care deeply for this animal, he’s become part of our farm-ily. It’s a time will tell type of situation. He’s young and virile enough that he might have a full recovery. It took all afternoon yesterday but we’ve separated him from the herd (to prevent further injury) and he is now in a safe place where he can rest and hopefully get better. Send good thoughts our way and we will keep you updated on the situation. – In times like these I’m so happy to be farming with Brian. In good times and in bad, we really do make such a good team even when things get stressful or we’re both exhausted from the sun. We check in with each other and bring each other water. We commiserate at how much the heat sucks, encourage each other to go in for a break and know ourselves well enough to know our boundaries and limitations. Most times, on the farm, we go to work on one project and a bunch of mini projects pop up aka “mini fires” that must be put out immediately. It’s not always easy to switch gears but we’ve been doing this for so many years together now that we often times can get it done without saying too much.\n\n–\n\nThe ten day looks very promising though and seems as though there is a reprieve coming our way starting today! 70’s and mixed clouds and sun (our favorite!) It’ll make farming that much more enjoyable. So send some cool thoughts our way – we’ll take all we can get!\n\n–\n\nWe’ll be planting out our melons, winter squash, pumpkins, lettuces, onions, third succession of corn and broccoli this week. We’re also beginning to seed, plant and prepare for our Fall and winter crops. So, keep your eyes open for details about our 2016/2017 Winter CSA in the coming weeks!\n\n–\n\n–\n\n–\n\nOnline WHF Farmstore. Thank you for your orders at the WHF Farmstore this past week.

Please see email “Final CSA Payment Due by June 1st” for details.\n\n–\n\nThe Spring Avalanche.\n\n–\n\nIt’s that time of the year where all the things on the farm must be done. Tending to early Spring crops, harvesting, preparing beds for mid summer crops, seeding, transplanting, weeding, flame weeding, watering and irrigating, filling trays and starting seeds for Fall crops and thinking of all the things to be started later in the month for over wintering/the Winter CSA. And then there’s 3,000lbs of produce that we harvest each week for our amazing CSA members. Rotating the livestock, building fences, irrigating the pasture, loading and stacking the first of the hay… Some farmers call it the Spring Avalanche. Now it feels like it’s turning into the Summer Tsunami. Where the lists keep growing and you hardly have time to cross something completely off the list without something else quickly taking its place. It’s kind of insane and a whole lot of crazy. We must be crazy, right? The good kind? It’s a pretty darn productive kind of crazy.. but crazy nonetheless. And we love it (that must be the crazy part). Makes us think of this quote,\n\n–\n\n“‎A farm is a manipulative creature. There is no such thing as finished. Work comes in a stream and has no end. There are only the things that must be done now and things that can be done later. The threat the farm has got on you, the one that keeps you running from can until can’t, is this: do it now, or some living thing will wilt or suffer or die. Its blackmail, really.” -Kristen Kimbell\n\n–\n\n-=\n\nThe most important thing we can do is eat well because that’s what keeps us so darn productive – gotta take good care of ourselves. Farmer Brian wanted me to mention that his favorite kind of cookie is oatmeal raisin if any of our members happen to be baking near or on their CSA day.. who’s he kidding.. he likes all kinds of sweets 😉\n\n–\n\nIt’ll probably be another long week for us with the 10day forecast (98 degrees?!) The days always start out with taking care of the livestock followed by early morning harvest, irrigating and other random things that need to get done followed by some planting, seeding or weeding after early dinner (have you seen the video of the new Stand ‘n plant we bought last week? It’s been a game changer for planting!) We’ll be busy prepping new ground over the next few days with compost, fertilizer and lime for our winter squash, pumpkins and melons. An acre of delicious goodies all ready to be planted! There is too much to get done, as we ease ourselves into 16 hour work days, so we probably won’t be at pick ups this week but do cheer us on and send us some of that awesome energy you all are storing up from the tasty veggies. We always appreciate a friendly wave if you see us bouncing along on the tractor or hoeing the fields!\n\n–\n\nOur 10,000th CSA Share! We figured out that this week marks harvesting our 10,000th CSA share! Two farmers, one farm… that means we’ve each harvested roughly 5,000 shares each and it also means by the end of this year we’ll have harvested and distributed over HALF A MILLION POUNDS of produce total over the last 7 years! Crazy sauce.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nLearn a little bit more about your farmers…. Last Fall your farmers had the amazing opportunity to be interviewed for the Farmer to Farmer podcast with Chris Blanchard. Chris asked us about the start of the farm, how we manage the farm as a couple and we even take a trip to Uganda. The Farmer to Farmer podcast has been a huge inspiration to us and many other farmers and we couldn’t have been more excited to participate! Have a listen at the link below and enjoy.\n\n–\n\nPodcast Link: farmertofarmerpodcast.com/episodes/powers or look up the Farmer to Farmer podcast episode #40 on iTunes.\n\n–\n\nLast October I reflect on how farming brought Brian and I together and you can read more about that here: https://workinghandsfarm.com/2015/10/13/to-adventure-week-22/\n\n–—\n\nWords of Encouragement. We wanted to give a shout out to all our members for their amazing feedback and slurry of food and recipe related posts on the WHF Members Page of Facebook. You all have been killing it. SERIOUSLY! It’s been such a huge source of inspiration for us – we eat a lot of vegetables (as you can imagine) and it’s been SO fun to cook and prepare some new things! Thank you all for sharing. It’s really such an amazing resource for members both new and old. And as we’ve said before it completes our food journey here on the farm to hear and see how the hard work is being utilized and enjoyed! We love it so so much.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nOnline WHF Farmstore.

Check out the email ‘Final CSA Payment Due by June 1st’ for more details!\n\n–\n\nHi Friends & Farm-ily\n\n–\n\nCSA Week 2 is here and over the next few weeks everyone will be getting into the groove of the CSA (including your farmers!) Making more home cooked meals, feeling more confident in the kitchen, being open to trying new veggies! We decided to keep the encouragement high with some helpful tips for CSA success. These aren’t all the ways to be successful as each person’s journey is there own but eating well, preparing food at home, being conscious of our own food journeys, and staying inspired and curious about nourishing ourselves, our families & friends is what it’s all about. If anything, reading through these should encourage you and make you feel great about the choice to sign up for CSA and be a part of your local farm!\n\n–\n\nNewsletter & Recipes. First and foremost, read the weekly newsletter and emailed recipe pdf each week! There are lots of farm updates that you don’t want to miss out on.. as well as some tried and true recipes and suggestions from your farmers on how to prepare your weekly share. We love growing the food but it’s just as important to us that you are eating and preparing the food and therefore have a life changing and positive experience!\n\n–\n\n=\n\nMeal planning. This is a great way to utilize each week’s bounty. For those who have their meals planned each week you know that planning goes as follow: collect your CSA, pick recipes, make a list and then purchase complimentary groceries. With CSA the idea is to start planning your meals after you pick up your share. If meal planning seems overwhelming, start with just a few planned meals a week. This change in the process means cooking with what’s in season, and it’s a good habit to get into to eating better and feeling great. Pro tip from farmer Brian: Try preparing a meal that will provide sufficient left overs the night before you collect your CSA. This way when you arrive home with your share you have time thoughtfully break everything down and store it without anyone getting hangry!\n\n–\n\nHow to stride ahead. This is a great video showing the simplicity and ease of processing veggies when first bringing them home. Oh, the practical pleasures of eating.. of just how washing or soaking the greens, pre-roasting/cooking, & storing veggies can make for many more homemade meals in a busy week, increase the longevity of the produce and make cooking enjoyable (as it should be!) And as one of our tenured CSA members said last year, “Make friends with your knife, cutting board, sink, dish towel, salad spinner, stove, and oven. They aren’t instruments of drudgery, they are keys to liberation. The time you spend prepping and cooking food is time to think and be present in the moment–“mindfulness” is a free benefit of CSA membership, so take advantage and enjoy it!”\n\n–\n\nStoring the veggies: Root veggies (beets, carrots etc) and other bulb veggies (radish, turnip, kohlrabi, onions, fennel etc) all have leafy greens attached. Make sure to cut the greens right where they meet the root and store them separately so that they stop drawing moisture out of the veggie through the process of respiration (if your carrots, radishes, beets etc get floppy.. now you know why).\n\n–\n\nOur bagged greens should keep wonderfully during the week in the “Bio-Bags.” One feature of the BioBag is that it “breathes” without leaking. This unique benefit allows excess moisture to evaporate, which keeps fruits and vegetables fresher, longer. For other items, it’s important to prep bunched greens and lettuce heads by washing, chopping and storing them in a tightly sealed container with a moist paper towel or try washing them wrapping them in a moist towel/paper towel and putting them in a bag. Otherwise the refrigerator has its way with them and sucks out all their moisture… leaving much to be desired.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nGetting your fridge ready for fresh goodies! Take the time the night before to make space for a new box of goodies, and to take inventory of any veggies that would love to be used up in a ‘end of the week’ stirfry, curry, soup, roasted veg, kale chips, smoothies, or green pesto! Making vegetable stock is always a happy solution for extra veggies – rough chop them, simmer them in a few quarts of water (a cup or two of veggies to one quart of water) for 30 – 40 minutes, and you have stock. Strain it, freeze it, and so versatile! Flavorful, rich in vitamins and minerals..\n\n–\n\nSave those “scraps”! Save the stems from the kale, collards, chard, spinach, the thick stalks from the broccoli, the ends and peels of carrots, tops of peppers, radish stems etc… Wrap up the scraps as you accumulate them (a pyrex or a bag with a moist towel works) and stash them in the fridge. At the end of the week you can make a delicious stock. Some folks make a gallon sized bag of “stock items” and freeze it for later… Check out this helpful blog post with all the details! Or, try out this recipe by Tamar Adler for Garlicky Leaf Stem and Core Pesto! Or, as one of our awesome members pointed out – make a quick pickle out of the stems (chard, beet, kale, collard stems etc)! Pickled stuff is delicious with all meals.\n\n–\n\nEat More Veggies! Add or double the amount of vegetables in your meals! See how many different vegetables you can pack in to what you’re already cooking. Eat the most tender greens and veggies first! For breakfast try a simple sautee with greens & garlic, biscuits, with eggs, in a quiche, simple salad or veggie pancakes. Drink your veggies! There are so many great veggie smoothies out there – whatever you have give it a go!\n\n–\n\n=\n\n=\n\nEnjoy eating new vegetables! One of our greatest examples of this is the amount of people who grew up on boiled to death beets.. or worse, canned tasteless beets. When people try the beets from the farm in a new way (roasted, in a salad, as burgers or even in brownies) they change their minds and there are so many things that contribute to that. Mostly, it’s the openness of trying something new or trying something in a new way. Branch out and explore your palette and see what tastes great to you. You have your farmers to consult and a wealth of resources at your fingertips so don’t hesitate to be inspired!\n\n–\n\nJoin the Working Hands Farm CSA Member Group on Facebook.

Some suggestions include: The Fermentation Bible: Wild Fermentation – by Sandor Ellix Katz, Food in Jars: Preserving in Small Batches Year-Round, Ball Blue Book of Preserving etc. Don’t forget that although you’re enjoying your veggies now there’s something satisfying about saving your extras for later in the year! We are on our last dozen jars of homemade tomato sauce and can’t express how lovely it is to pop open a jar of our summer tomatoes!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nEating in season! We live in such a fertile part of the US and should relish in all the wonderful things that grow where we live. Waiting for those first seasonal crops can be hard after a winter of root veggies, brassicas, soups etc but everything tastes that much sweeter (because it’s fresh, in season and grown just down the road in the dirt & in the open air!) It’s easy to enjoy the conveniences of the grocery store (that’s what it’s there for) but we tell ya that waiting all winter and spring for that first seasonal vine ripened tomato is the best thing for ya!\n\n–\n\nAs your CSA farmers, throughout the 28-week season we provide you with the most nutrient rich, organic, thoughtfully-grown, fresh picked & seasonal produce! We strive to grow produce according to the seasons and to the best of our abilities. To introduce you to new varieties of veggies & include delicious ways to prepare them! To encourage you to enjoy your time in the kitchen, be playful and to have fun. Each week that you pick up your bounty we pass the torch to you. We’re a part of each others food journey and we look forward to hearing week to week about what you’re cooking, what was eaten first and what you really enjoyed. It completes our food journey here on the farm to hear and see how the hard work is being utilized and enjoyed!\n\n–\n\nThanks again for all your support and we look forward to sharing in the bounty with you this season.

We are so happy and appreciative of all your support and encouragement over the last 5 months (since our 2016 season started). Our Spring, Summer and Fall CSA has been months in the making and we look forward to the season beginning and to celebrate with a bountiful harvest this week!\n\n–\n\nFlow of the CSA. Over the next few weeks we will all begin to get into the flow of pick ups, harvests, seasons, you name it. Spring is a great time to adapt-to and learn new habits, to eat seasonally and fresh. We remind you to be patient, to be excited and to enjoy the ride. There are so many decisions that one person must make everyday – a daunting task at times – revel in those food choices your farmers and the changing of the seasons are making for you each week. Get creative & be inspired. Ask questions & be open – you’ll be surprised what you might find as the season unfolds.\n\n–\n\nEnjoy all the benefits of eating fresh (picked THAT morning), eating seasonally (sorry, no tomatoes in May), and local (your local farmer, Brian and I, need the support of our community)!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nSafety note on pick ups: We are putting up a new pole barn near the pick up area (check out our post from Sunday for the details). Please watch your children and keep them away from the heavy machinery. The project is set to finish in early July so we will keep you all posted with updates. The wee-farm goat greeters! The goats should be back upfront after the building is finished. The “Lost Boys” are currently mowing our backyard and eating back the Himalayan blackberry hedgerow around the farm’s periphery. *It’s also important while the pole building is going up that folks do not arrive early so that the building crew can tidy things up before members arrive. *\n\n–\n\nFarm Pick Up Time. Farm Pick Ups take place on Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday from 4 – 7pm (please double check on your assigned day). Note: Bi-Weekly share members pick up their produce every other week throughout the course of the 28 week CSA season (a total of 14 shares). Bi-Weekly members will pick up their share on weeks 1,3,5,7, etc… or 2,4,6,8, etc… depending on your assigned CSA start date.\n\n–\n\nIt’s important to pick up between 4-7pm on your assigned day (and not a minute before) as it’s just the two of us and we harvest most everything fresh that morning so your farmer’s need the time to harvest, wash and set up the pick up area. *It’s also important while the pole building is going up that folks do not arrive early so that the crew can tidy things up before members arrive.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nParking. There is a nice big parking area for a convenient and stress free pick-up. Please park facing the new pole barn as this will help to keep a consistent flow of traffic which will help to keep children crossing the parking lot safe. Park thoughtfully as folks tend to come in waves and the parking will fill up fast! There are also children and families who will be moving from the pick-up area to the parking lot so please drive slowly. We are located on a busy country road so please be patient coming and going from the farm (oh the pros and cons of living on a main country road!)\n\n–\n\nPick-Up Area. We are breathing new life into a very old and forgotten farm property so you will see it become more and more beautiful as the seasons and years go on… over 4 years ago all that remained on this property was a dilapidated old barn that was covered in 12ft tall blackberries and the old farmhouse by the road. The CSA Member Area is now located on the side of this original farmhouse (“Freda’s House”) built in the early 1900’s. Thank you for growing with us and for being a part of this process.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nThe Pick-Up. Please sign in before grabbing your goodies. You will enter the member area and move counterclockwise, packing your own share with the allotted amounts of vegetables written next to each varietal. Please bring 2-3 reusable shopping bags, a crate or some members even use a laundry basket to put your produce in. It’s nice to have a few bags for heavier items and a bag for bunched greens/more fragile items etc.\n\n–\n\nPick-Up is also a great opportunity to meet other members and share over the common bonds of food, health and community! If you are unable to come pick up your share from 4-7pm on your assigned day, you can either arrange for a friend, family member, colleague etc to pick it up for you. If you cannot find anyone to pick-up the share on your behalf please give us 48hr notice (emails are best).\n\n–\n\nBe sure to visit our FAQ’s for any other questions you may have: https://workinghandsfarm.com/q-a/\n\n–\n\n–\n\nWHF Pastured Pork, Grass-Fed Beef Shares & Pastured Eggs. All available items are updated on our Online Farmstore! You can make an order there and we will have your order ready to pick up at your next CSA pick up day. We will be updating the online store this weekend with even more selections of ham, new blends of sausage, smoked pork chops etc! Our Grass-Fed Beef shares will be available at the end of this summer/early Fall. For egg orders, we are sold out of egg shares for May & June but expect to have more shares available when our newest layers come in to egg production in July. Please send us an email with your interest and we’ll add you to our waiting list! To learn more about our golden yolked eggs rich in color, flavor and nutrients: click here.\n\n–\n\nCSA Recipes. There will be 2-4 recipes emailed to you with each weekly share. These recipes have been tried and tested (and doubly approved by your farmers)! If you happen to try a different recipe with some of the veggies from that Week’s Share feel free to send it our way so that we too can try it and share it with others! Click here to check out your farmer approved cookbooks and food blogs!\n\n–\n\nEgg cartons, Berry Boxes, Rubberbands etc. For all those who purchase eggs, please save up your WHF egg cartons for us and return them. We also reuse all berry boxes (1/2 pints, pints, quarts) and rubberbands so you can return those as well. We are a thoughtful farm in terms of minimizing waste and reuse what we can! There will be a place to return these items by the sign-in sheet.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nWorking Hands Farm CSA Member Group on Facebook! An email has been sent out with instructions to join the Working Hands Farm CSA Member Group on Facebook. It’s a safe place (a private group) exclusively for Working Hands Farm CSA members to share recipe ideas, kitchen prep successes, food preservation ideas, articles, resources etc. Check your email to join the group. Participation is highly encouraged!\n\n–\n\nFarm livestock. All of our members will have the opportunity to see/visit the livestock on our farm during our to-be-scheduled CSA Farm Day. Keep in mind that almost all of our livestock are kept inside of electrified fences so parents please keep a close eye on you children during this day.\n\n–\n\nCSA Farm Day, Pumpkin Day, Newsletters etc. Throughout the season we offer opportunities to enjoy a CSA Member Farm Day, pumpkin pick day etc all on the farm. Also, to keep our farm-ily connected to the farm, the seasons and what it takes to grow food locally we send a weekly farm newsletter so be sure to read the whole thing through! We post frequently on instagram, facebook to share in our day-to-day and to stay connected with people (as you can imagine we spend 99% of our time with vegetables and 2-4 legged critters ha!) All of these opportunities are a great way to see the farm, chat with your farmers, meet other CSA members in the community and enjoy the seasons on the farm.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nThank you again for all your support! It’s been a busy Spring and there is much anticipation to get this season started. We have another exciting season ahead with over 70 different types of vegetables and several different varieties of each (it’s never a dull moment on the farm!) Your farmers have been working harder than ever to get the season started early and have more variety in the shares early on!\n\n–\n\nEnjoy the leafy greens and cool weather brassica crops that you will find in the first few week’s of the CSA (the Spring seasons natural cleanse… after a Winter full of root crops and heavier foods). The greens will be tender, delicious and untouched by the heat that summer brings. Enjoy them while they are here! The bounty will continue to grow and grow and grow as we near the longer, warmer days of Summer! Thanks again for all your support and we look forward to sharing in the bounty with you this season.\n\n–\n\nWith kind regards,\n\n–\n\nYour farmers\n\n–\n\nJess & Brian\n\n–\n\ndirty hands, clean hearts\n\n–\n\nJoshua McFadden’s Book, Six Seasons a new way with vegetables (one of our recent favorites): https://www.powells.com/book/-9781579656317\n\n–\n\nDishing Up the Dirt & Let Them Eat Dirt: Recipes created from an Oregon Farmer for the whole family to enjoy! https://www.powells.com/book/let-them-eat-dirt-9781645679608 https://www.letthemeatdirtkids.com/\n\n–\n\nRuffage: A Practical Guide to Vegetables is not your typical cookbook–it is a how-to-cook book of a variety of vegetables.

We’re officially SOLD OUT for the 2016 Spring, Summer & Fall CSA Season! If you’d like to be added to our waiting list please fill out the sign up form here: https://workinghandsfarm.com/signupform/and we’ll email you should a share become available! We can’t wait for the 2016 CSA season to start! Thank you to all of our amazing CSA members both new and old who have signed up for the 2016 Spring and Summer CSA season!\n\nWinter CSA Success! This week is the final pick up week of our inaugural Winter CSA season and I know we’ve said this before but we LOVE the Winter CSA! We didn’t know what to fully expect back in June when we began planning, prepping, seeding and transplanting for the winter CSA but are so pleased that all the planning turned out even with the wettest winter weather ever – the vegetables proved just how resilient they are and how much we’ve learned over 7 years of growing. It’s given us a whole new perspective on farming and we’ve never ate so good through the winter! Thank you for being willing to experiment with us over the course of this inaugural Winter CSA.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nThe Winter Bounty. We started our Winter CSA journey on December 2nd and we’ve made it all the way to the middle of April! Our expectation for the Winter Shares were 5-10 items (dependent on weather) in each weekly share. Over the course of 18 weeks we had 11+ items in each weekly share. We were also impressed with the variety of veggies we harvested through the winter months – most weeks we had more fresh picked produce than storage veggies which is amazing! To top it all off, it was an average of 400lbs per share which comes in under $1.50 per lb of produce.\n\n–\n\nSo many different kind of goodies in the winter shares…Asparagus, arugula, beets, broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celeriac, celery, cilantro, collards, garlic, greens mix, italian dandelion, kale, kohlrabi, komatsuna, leeks, lettuce heads, onions, herbs (rosemary, thyme, oregano), pac choi, parsley, parsnips, pumpkins, radish, rapini, radicchio, rhubarb, romanesco, rutabaga, shallots, spaghetti squash, spinach, sprouting broccoli, sweet potatoes, swiss chard, storage tomatoes, turnips, winter squash and more!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nWe are so excited to learn and grow for the next winter season! Keep your eyes and ears open when we launch the 2016 Winter CSA Sign Ups later this summer! We’ll be starting Fall and Winter veggie starts in the coming months (we’re always thinking ahead…!)\n\n–\n\nA wonderful family visit. After an amazing 2 week visit my folks headed back east to their home in Massachusetts. I can’t express just how much their visit meant to Brian and I. The last time they were able to visit was at our wedding which was almost 2 years ago! It was amazing spending the days together – eating three square meals, talking, working side by side and just enjoying each other’s company. We accomplished so much in just a few weeks time… we were like loaded springs waiting for the turn in the weather and finally, when my parents arrived, there was sun (and even some 90 degree weather!) All the composting, fertilizing, liming, tilling, and planting began! The start of the 2016 growing season had officially begun and it felt right to have them there with us by our sides. They brought their A game and it felt great to reconnect with them as if a day never passed since the last time we saw them. It’s amazing how much we miss them already and hope it’s not too long until we see there faces again. Love you guys!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nAfter my folks left Brian worked extra hard into the evenings to disc and seed the lower pasture with our old-but-new-to-us seed drill. The extra soggy el nino winter left that bottom acreage under water for a few months time. We talked to a handful of farmers near by and our local forage land specialist at OSU extension and we came up with a pasture mix that we hope will thrive in wetter conditions. It will be amazing to turn those 4 acres into productive ground to graze the cows through the drier part of the season. Fingers crossed this little bit of rain moving through the valley helps germinate all those seeds!\n\n–\n\nCalf Update! The last calf, a beautiful (and giant) heifer calf was born to our mama 1047 last week. She has been warmly taken in by the herd and has been running around the pastures with her other two calf buddies. They are so animated and light on their feet, drinking out of the water trough and getting their fill at the milk bar. All three calves take after their sire Jackson, with the British White markings which makes them easy to spot in the pasture and are pretty darn cute to watch!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nThe planting and seeding continues.. we’ll be starting our first curcubits (cucumbers, summer squash, zucchini) in the propagation house this weekend as well as a bunch of greens, flowers and other goodies! We have some cippolini onions, cauliflower, pac choi, greens, herbs etc that will be planted this weekend during the forecasted sunny stretch. It’s hard to believe it’s already the middle of April! Pretty soon harvest will begin again and a whole new adventure awaits! #keepswimming #endlesspossibilities\n\n–\n\nWe look forward to seeing and meeting all our Spring/Summer/Fall CSA Members next month! We’ll be in touch with updates about the start date etc. In the meantime, follow us on Instagram & Facebook to keep in touch with our daily happenings on the farm. Here we grow! Whoo hoo!\n\n–\n\nWith kind regards,\n\n–\n\nyour farmers\n\n–\n\nJess & Brian\n\n–\n\ndirty hands, clean hearts\n\n–\n\nHi Friends & Farm-ily,\n\n–\n\nWell, we’ve loaded up the ark and are ready to set sail! Just kidding.. (kind of) but the flood is back! After 7+ inches of rain in the valley last week the rushing rivers are cresting as we speak. El nino certainly has had other plans for us this season compared to last year. Last year it was sunny and 70 and we were able to get in our strawberry and onion plantings. This year, we’re waiting out the rains and testing our patience, as these two farmers are ready to go! Our first plantings of chard, kale, broccoli, beets, lettuce etc are all ready to get in the ground too. The 10-day looks promising as the rains begin to taper off. We’re gonna need a week of sunshine to dry out the soggy fields before we can plant. We’re keeping a close eye on things though for any opportunity we might get! We’re ready to get our hands dirty. #dirtyhandscleanhearts\n\n–\n\nIt’s crazy to think that we have just a month left of harvest for our first ever Winter CSA. Crazy! The Winter CSA has been a blast and we are so excited to reflect on the successes and to do even better next season. In just 4 months time we’ll be planting for winter harvest. Time sure is a funny thing on the farm.\n\n–\n\nSome excellent news! Remember when we asked you guys for a little good luck a few months back? Well, we have some good news: we received the funding through the NRSC’s High Tunnel Initiative and will be putting up a few new high tunnels this Spring and Summer!!! WHOO HOOO! This will allow us to grow even more through the winter months under covered space which is coveted on the farm. Having any bit of insurance when you’re working with nature, the elements and everything in between really helps to mitigate risk. Exciting times!\n\n–\\\n\n–\n\nNew Nitrate Free Products & Winter Pork Sale! We are excited to share that the WHF Farmstore is fully stocked with new nitrite and sugar free items (bacon, fresh sausages, canadian bacon, hams etc), an amazing Winter Pork Sale & individual cuts for purchase!\n\n–\n\nWe are thrilled to announce that we are working with a new USDA certified processor who is also a lady farmer and has been selling custom cuts at the Beaverton Farmers market for the past 16 years. Her and her husband have built a beautiful new facility and proudly provide a completely allergen free environment (for those concerned about peanut, gluten and dairy allergies). Between their knowledge of providing the finest uncured/no nitrate added options and our unbelievable heritage pork we couldn’t be more excited to offer these new products to you. –\n\nVisit our online WHF Farmstore here: WHF Farmstore\n\nAs you all know, our pigs live a wonderful completely stress free life and are raised in the sunshine on pasture. They are fed a supplemental diet of certified organic/non-gmo grain that is grown locally by farmers in the NW and vegetables from our organic garden. And as they are raised on pasture they have more heart healthy omega 3 fatty acids and are higher in conjugated linoleic acid, a type of fat that’s thought to reduce heart disease and cancer risks. As with all of our livestock our animals are raised without use of antibiotics or hormones.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nKnow your farmers, know your food! The Spring, Summer and Fall CSA is drawing near and we have a few shares left for the 2016 CSA season! We are really excited and are waiting patiently for the CSA to fill up this year… help us get there by spreading the good word because it makes all the difference. As a farm-ily member once said, “keep your friends close and you farmers closer.” ––\n\n3 Steps to Signing Up:\n\n–\n\n1 Read all about the 2016 CSA season\n\n2 Fill out the CSA Sign Up Form & Member Agreement\n\n3 Mail or drop off a Check or Make a Payment Online to reserve your share\n\n–\n\nWe can’t wait for the 2016 growing season to start!

Reminder: First CSA payments are due by April 1st!!\n\n–\n\nSo send some dry and sunny wishes our way… as we are eager to get our hands dirty. Thankfully there are always things to do on the farm so we will be keeping plenty busy in the mean time.\n\n—\n\nWith kind regards,\n\n–\n\nyour farmers\n\n–\n\nJess & Brian\n\n–\n\ndirty hands, clean hearts\n\n–\n\n–\n\n“Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influence of the earth.” ― Henry David Thoreau\n\n–\n\nHi Friends & Farm-ily,\n\n—\n\nWelcome March! Spring is certainly in the air and March has definitely lived up to the whole ‘coming in like a lion.’ Hopefully the ‘out like a lamb’ rings true too. The 10-day is looking awfully soggy and we keep crossing our fingers for a dry stretch at the end of it. There are strawberries and onions to plant in the next few weeks followed by our first crops for the Spring/Summer CSA season. The soil has to be dry enough to plant so keep your fingers crossed and say a little prayer to the sun gods above!\n\n–\n\nIn between the rainstorms we continue to push things forward in the field. The cover crops have been mowed and disc-ed. Brian spent a few solid days drop spreading lime and compost. We picked up our custom fertilizer blend yesterday from Marion Ag. Step by step, now, we wait for the sun so the soil can dry out and become workable (and practice patience!) If we work the soil when it is too wet it will become cloddy and more difficult to transplant, cultivate and weed. But some years you have no choice otherwise it will push back the start date of the CSA too far! Fingers crossed for 3-4 days of solid sunshine!!!\n\n–\n\nBesides getting our ducks in a row with our fertilizer order we’ve also been busy researching pasture grasses to seed in the lower area of the farm. With all the flooding and rain this year most of the bottom pasture was under water for 2+ months – December and January. We’ve talked to a handful of farmers near by and our local forage land specialist at OSU extension and have come up with a mix that we hope will thrive in wetter conditions. Now we just gotta wait until the sky clears and the rains wane so we can get out there to seed! Everything seems to be waiting on the sun…\n\n–\n\n–\n\nIn the meantime, we will be turning up soil in our 100ft high tunnel/greenhouse and transplanting a few crops and seeding in a few things. We are on week 12 of the Winter CSA which means we have 6 more weeks to go (18 total). We didn’t know what to expect back in December when it started but are so pleased that all the planning turned out even with the ups and downs and slog that the winter weather brought our way. It’s given us a whole new perspective on farming and like we’ve said before… we’ve never ate so good through the winter!\n\n–\n\nThe true test of a winter CSA. The winter CSA has been filled with new challenges that we have faced for the first time and it has also been filled with incredible unforeseen successes. This period in the season will prove to put your farmers through the ultimate test! We are coming up on a challenging time for harvest. The hunger gap. It’s very much an in-between time where the crops that were planted last fall are beginning to bolt (i.e. rapini) and go to flower. The soil is still too wet and cool for things to really germinate quickly which is why high tunnel/greenhouse space is so valuable this time of year. Many of the storage crops are on their last hurrah (onions, garlic etc) who are all starting to sprout as the longer/warmer day are upon us (they say, let us grow!) This part of the season is the true test of a winter CSA. Thank you for being willing to experiment with us over the course of this inaugural winter CSA.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nNew life! The propagation house is really filling up with Spring and Summer starts. We have eggplant and peppers on the heat mats waiting for germination (they like the soil to be hot, hot, hot) and in the next few days we’ll be seeding tomatoes, leeks, onions, etc.. The fun never stops.. whoop whoop! It’s crazy to think that in 4+ months we will be enjoying the bounty of summer – tomatoes, peppers, eggplant etc…\n\n–\n\nThe trials and tribulations of garlic! Every Fall we plant a significant amount of garlic (this year we planted 3,000 ft/6,000 cloves) that over winters and gets harvested June-July. As past members might remember, our 2015 crop of garlic was hit with the awful Rust fungus which lead to significantly smaller bulbs, smaller yields, less storability and buying all new garlic seed since ours didn’t size up enough. 80lbs of garlic seed x $20/lb adds up quick but we love garlic and are hopeful that this years yield will be better (we buy all our organic garlic seed from a local Pacific NW company – Filaree Garlic Farm)! There’s so much to learn all the time especially with the changes in weather and seasons.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nBeds are prepped and ready to irrigate (before flaming!), planting garlic and mulching with straw\n\n–\n\nGarlic can be a tricky crop to grow. It seems easy for the first few years but after that your weed seed bank gets churned up and you have way more competition to deal with from weeds come Spring. They are also in the garden growing for 8 months which is a pretty long time! We usually plant in October and this year we wanted to do better so we decided we would prepare the beds in August (compost, fertilize, till 2 months before planting) and lay irrigation to germinate weeds and put our trusty new flame weeder to good use. After a few weeks (once the weeds were established) farmer Brian went through all 10 beds and flame weeded the germinating weeds. It takes about 15-30 minutes per bed to flame them. Once flamed we watered them again. Waited a few weeks and flamed them again. By October we were looking at some pretty weed free and perfect stale seed beds for planting garlic into. We were hoping all that pre emergence flame weeding would really cut down or eliminate or need to hand weed it in the Spring (ouch my back!) In October, after we dibbled the beds (made holes for the cloves to go into) Brian flamed the beds again while I planted behind him… ensuring once and for all (3 times a charm) that weed issues of the past would be a distant memory. To top off all our hard work we put a nice thick layer of organic straw ontop of the beds. This is where things get hairy….\n\n–\n\n–\n\nOur nice thick lawn of straw popping up in the garlic (center) and (on the R & L)removing all the mulch and cleaning it up last month!\n\n–\n\nIn October & November, the rains came back which was great because the garden loves the rain. A few weeks after we planted the garlic and mulched we noticed there was a lawn growing – a nice even layer of grass coming up in the whole garlic patch. Our hearts sank. We did not know that the straw was full of viable seed as we bought it from a trusted local source who failed to inform us that the ‘straw’ we purchased was in fact not ‘straw’ at all as it was full of seed (that the grains had been lodged while being harvested.. so they knew, they just didn’t tell us). We had a perfect stand of straw growing where we had just invested so much time, labor, resources and energy into. Would we be able to save the crop? How many hours of labor would it take to remove all the straw and weed the new thicket of rye we had growing (not including all the labor we already put into it). It was crazy. So, for the past month Brian and I have each spent about 40 hours each removing all the straw and pulling out the grass/weeds. It was such a bummer but after all the hard work we have successfully rescued the garlic. We have also decided to go sans-mulch on the garlic this coming Fall. It’s really hard to find an organic local source of straw (especially straw that isn’t full of seed apparently…) so we’re gonna try not using any after seeing the success other fellow farmers have had without mulching. We’re hoping that the worst is over and that any weeding needing to be done from here on out can be done with our Allis Chalmers G cultivating tractor. Onward and upward!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nSpring Piglets! Tami decided to celebrate #nationalpigday on Tuesday by having her first litter of piglets and she did great! She had seven piglets in the wee hours of the morning. This is her first litter and she’s showing a strong maternal instinct and is keeping her little ones close. We are amazed at how different our two mama sows are – as Rosie (Tami’s mom) has a much more relaxed mothering approach. Tami who is 300+ lbs moves slowly and carefully around her 1-lb piglets – lifting a single leg if she hears a squeal or grunts until everyone is on one side of her before she lays down. She has also positioned her body in such a way to keep the piglets in their house so she can easily watch them. Rosie lets you come in and give her a pet and observe the piglets – no problem.. Tami on the other hand seems to like it better when no one else (including other pigs) is around. Her litter is a cross of a few different heritage breeds – LargeBlack/Tamworth/Berkshire x Duroc.\n\n–\n\nThis year’s newest layers arrived last week so there’s a lot of peeping going on in Chateau Poulet They grow so fast and in 20-24 weeks (4.5-5months) they will be integrated with the rest of the flock and laying their very first eggs. It’s amazing though how quickly they imprint and discover how to eat and drink for the first time. Watching them scratch and dust and fan and do all those chicken things right off the bat is amazing.\n\n–\n\n–\n\n2016 CSA Spring & Summer CSA! Thank you to all of our amazing CSA members both new and old who have signed up for the 2016 Spring and Summer CSA season! There are less than a dozen shares available for the 2016 season so be sure to sign up quickly! We are really excited and are waiting patiently for the CSA to fill up this year, more so than ever, as a full CSA and a tight finanical projection means we will be able to hire our first employee! Help us get there by spreading the good word because it makes all the difference. As a farm-ily member once said, “keep your friends close and you farmers closer.”\n\n–\n\n3 Steps to Signing Up:\n\n–\n\n1 Read all about the 2016 CSA season\n\n2 Fill out the CSA Sign Up Form & Member Agreement\n\n3 Mail or drop off a Check or Make a Payment Online to reserve your share\n\n–\n\nWe can’t wait for the 2016 growing season to start!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nSo send some dry and sunny wishes our way… as we are eager to get our hands dirty. Thankfully there are always things to do on the farm so we will be keeping plenty busy in the mean time.\n\n–\n\np.s. Has anyone watched the Cooked series on netflix with Michael Pollan? Check out the trailer here. We’ve begun it this week and encourage you all to watch it too (as Farmer Brian said, “finally, something worth watching!) Here is the write up: “Explored through the lenses of the four natural elements – fire, water, air and earth – COOKED is an enlightening and compelling look at the evolution of what food means to us through the history of food preparation and its universal ability to connect us. Highlighting our primal human need to cook, the series urges a return to the kitchen to reclaim our lost traditions and to forge a deeper, more meaningful connection to the ingredients and cooking techniques that we use to nourish ourselves.” Check out the book too!\n\n–\n\nWith kind regards,\n\n–\n\nyour farmers\n\n–\n\nJess & Brian\n\n–\n\ndirty hands, clean hearts–\n\n–\n\n“A seed is small but rich with possibility, like love, which is as humble as it is powerful.” —Pir Zia Inayat-Khan\n\n–\n\nHi Friends & Farm-ily,\n\n–\n\nFebruary is just flying by and your farmers are keeping pace as things keep moving right along here on the farm! The first seeds have sprouted in the greenhouse and are even forming their ‘first true leaves’. We worked extra late on Tuesday and Wednesday night to get the first seeds in the ground (outside in the field) and to beat the rain and stormy weather that was headed our way. Hence, the tardiness of the newsletter… one step at a time.\n\n–\n\nWe’ve had a blast figuring out stuff this month. So many projects to begin and so many fun things to check off the list. We got our soil test results back a couple week ago and our soil is looking healthier than ever! Soil Organic matter is up almost 2% over the last couple years! Based on the this years test results, we’ve just about finalized our 2016 custom organic fertilizer blend, which means let the bed prepping begin! Liming, composting, fertilizing, tilling all that in and getting the ground ready for the first transplants in March. Hopefully we have a nice long stretch of dry weather coming up so we can work the soil. The few days of dry followed by a few days of wet doesn’t allow the soil to dry out quite enough to the texture and consistency that we like to plant and seed into. Fingers crossed!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nThe custom cover crop we seeded in late September – of triticale, peas and vetch – has really taken off with the mild temperatures and soon we gotta get that tilled in too. It takes about 6-8 weeks, depending on the weather, to fully incorporate it, break down and let the soil dry out. Cover cropping is so important in our long term fertilizer program as it’s nitrogen-fixing, soil-conditioning, erosion-preventing & bio-mass-building. Since we officially turned ground on this property in 2013 the soil’s health just keeps on getting better (before that we were farming just few miles down River Rd. from 2009-2013). It is because of our CSA members investment and our methodology that we can improve the soils on our farm! And it is working! We have the tests to prove it! We have really enjoyed learning about the history and the soil here and making improvements from season to season. It’s amazing that we get to invest only the best into our soils in order to produce healthy, organically grown, fresh, nutrient rich produce! “If I grow good soil, I can forget about the vegetables.” – Nigel Walker Here’s to another season of growing and learning and everything in between!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nThis poem fits. Not Anyone Who Says by Mary Oliver. photo taken in 2011 at the Nile River\n\n–\n\nIn the midst of the February projects and excitement, Valentine’s day had me looking through some old photos of Brian and I when we first met. Some of you already know the story (if not, you can read about it here) It doesn’t feel like time passes by too quickly while you’re living it but looking at those old photos… it’s crazy to see just how much time has passed or how many things have happened in between. It’s really nice to remember where you were and how far you’ve come and to appreciate the person who’s been there with you through it all.\n\n–\n\nBrian and I have both grown a lot as individuals and as husband and wife, as friends, farmers and business partners. Through it all we both feel grateful that the universe brought us together. Together we thrive and we absolutely love what we do every single day. We bring out the best in each other and it’s not always easy – the farm being a manipulative creature and what not – but every day we give it our best shot. Farming is the reason we met and were brought together. We had a good chuckle and a bunch of smiles while looking through those old farm photos. All the hand dug beds, hand seeded crops, city deliveries, extra back breaking labor etc.. that this farm was built upon – the work – the challenge – the risk – the excitement – the bounty – the stick-to-itiveness – the ‘growing’ better from season to season – and the deep satisfaction of providing safe, delicious, fresh produce to our community with a connection to the farm and it’s farmers. In our infancy as farmers these are the things that brought us together and helped us to build upon that foundation and really see it thrive. Those smiles that seemed to go on for miles without a dime in our pockets but plenty of dirt under our fingernails (and vegetables in our bellies). We definitely don’t have it all figured out but looking back on earlier farming days I’d say we have figured out some things… 😉\n\n–\n\n–\n\n2016 CSA Spring & Summer CSA!

Pretty soon the greenhouse will be brimming with starts and as the end of March approaches we will be putting plants in the ground. Exciting times!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nWith kind regards,\n\n–\n\nyour farmers\n\n–\n\nJess & Brian\n\n–\n\ndirty hands, clean hearts\n\n–\n\nHi Friends & Farm-ily,\n\n–\n\nWelcome February! The ol’ groundhog – Punxsutawney Phil – did not see his shadow yesterday which means an early Spring is coming. And ol’ El nino ,with it’s crazy winter weather all around the states, seems to be telling us that is bringing an early Spring too – we shall see! (Did you see that 2015 was the warmest year on record?!) All we know is that it sure has been lovely weather of late with some extra spring-like weather on the horizon (60’s and sunny next week?!) A break from the rain sure has been nice.. and just in time it seems as we’re all geared up to start the first of the 2016 seedlings in the propagation house in the next few days. Whoo hoo! Let the sowing begin! We’re so excited for the 2016 growing season!\n\n–\n\nFebruary really is an exciting month on the farm as it’s a time for pushing many things forward on the farm. It’s a month when we bring out ‘farmer ninja mode’ to the max. A time where we’re feeling rested from the change of physical pace that winter brings and feeling extra inspired by the momentum of CSA sign ups, seed orders, planning etc…. and there’s oh-so-much planning to do!\n\n–\n\n–\n\nSoil tests, crop planning, seed starting, tractor tune ups, building projects and more, oh my! One of the first things we like to do in February is get our custom made fertilizer for the garden all set to go. The first step to soil success is submitting our yearly soil test to A&L Labs which we happened to get back last week. Next to seed orders this is seriously up there with Christmas! How did we do? What can we do better? The challenges and possibilities that farming brings starts right here in the planning stages. Our custom made organic fertilizer mix paired with the omri certified garden compost we’ve been using has really improved the soil over the past 3 years and it’s fun to see those previous seasons soil test results change in a positive way! “If I grow good soil, I can forget about the vegetables.” – Nigel Walker It brings a big smile to these farmers faces to see the land become more productive over time and to see things truly thrive (it’s members and farmers included) from season to season. This week we are working with a local lady soil guru on organic soil recommendations specifically for veggie production on our farm and look forward to feeding the soil and all of our wonderful members through our 7th growing season! Whoop whoop!\n\n–\n\nFeeding and building the nutrition in the soil and rotating all the 70+ different kinds of veggies we grow around the farm is so important (in order to combat disease and pests etc and make sure there is the right amount of nutrition to meet the needs of the many different crops that we grow). We also need to plan out our successional crop plantings in order to have food for our members each and every week! It seems like a crazy amount of information to grow so many different crops for over 120 households for 7 months (+ 5 months of winter CSA) of the year which is why the systems we’ve created are so important for the two of us to run this ship smoothly. We’re buttoning up the crop plans for the season and are really excited about the crops and varieties of veggies that we’re growing this year. With all the hot weather 2015 brought we feel better prepared (mentally and physically) for whatever 2016 will throw at us. Nature waits for no one and the more experience we take on (high fives!) the better prepared we will be.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nTuning up the tractors to make sure everything is in working order is also at the top of February’s list. Brian has been having fun tuning up and tending to the old 1953 Allis Chalmers G to get it in tip top running order as it won’t be long now before we’re spreading compost, making beds, and cultivating! We even worked on it together one day and it was fun to problem solve with such an old piece of machinery (they definitely don’t make em like they used to! and there sure isn’t a lot of helpful information to be found on the world wide web!) Strawberry and onion plants will be here before you know it and although these two farmers might be a little soft and out of shape it’s nice feeling to know the tractors are rearing to go!\n\n–\n\nFarmer ninja mode begins when we’re bringing all the plans together. In any given day you might start 5 different projects and finish one… the work is “never done” as we say but we’re also never bored.. so there’s that 😉 We are multi-tasking extraordinaire’s (or, trying to be!) Starting seeds, prepping ground, mowing cover crops, prepping beds and setting down occultation covers in the garden – where weeds germinate in the warm, moist conditions created by the tarp but are then killed by the absence of light. Thinking weeks and months ahead so that when May rolls around we are greeted with the first bountiful harvests of the Spring season.\n\n–\n\nAnd what kind of Spring would it be without anticipation of new life? We’ve got a new batch of layer chicks heading to the farm later this month as well as Tami’s first litter of piglets. It sure will be a sweet way to welcome the coming of Spring with new life.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nAnd in the midst of the season that lies ahead, we are just a week away from the halfway point of the WHF Winter CSA! We can’t believe that this is the first season that we’ve grown through the Winter. We are seriously loving it and already talking about growing and making plans for next winter. We really do feel that it’s an amazing addition to the farm to provide produce through the shorter days of the year all while providing supplementary income to the farm that will help us achieve some balance in the crazy months of summer. We are big fans all around – eating delicious farm fresh veg in the winter – yes please! We definitely set a low expectation when we embarked on this journey last fall as the winter weather is more variable than other times of the year. Crop losses can happen from a hard freeze, disease pressure, bugs, etc… and many of these things are out of your farmers control. Also, keep your fingers crossed we applied for a grant through the NRSC’s EQUIP program for a couple new green houses for next winters veggie production! We should find out if we will receive the grant in the next couple of months!\n\n–\n\nAnd we’ve had a pretty up and down winter as far as weather goes – we’ve had cold, and warm, sunny, and frozen, windy and rain – record breaking – rain. Despite the variability in weather we have experienced many winter farming successes and has given us a greater perspective when it comes to growing in extreme conditions! The shares have been larger than we expected – with 11-12 items in each week’s share – as opposed to the 5-10 that we were hoping for (whoop whoop!) It’ll be fun to see what the rest of the Spring will bring! It is February which is also the beginning of the “hungry gap” in the farming world. “The hungry gap” is the “gardeners’ name for the period in spring when there is little or no fresh produce available from a vegetable garden or allotment. It usually starts when overwintered brassicavegetables such as brussels sprouts and winter cauliflowers and January King cabbages “bolt” (i.e. run up to flower) as the days get warmer and longer.” We assure you, as always, that no one will go hungry at WHF as we have some amazing “over-wintering” crops that are just now beginning to produce after 200+ days of growing (so cool) among other fun things. And as we’ve said before, you have gotten to know Brian and I, and our work ethic over the course of this season (and for the majority of you over several seasons) and you know we will do our very best to ensure you have food on your table all winter long!\n\n–\n\n2016 CSA Spring & Summer CSA!

We had a few days of sun a few weeks back (remember..?) and it appears that the rain is back. Between the overflowing creek and the rising ground water the lower pastures are flooded out again. The Tualatin is just beginning to break it’s banks to join the party. Such a different winter than we’ve had the past two years – both which were a lot drier. They are saying that El Niño is having it’s second peak currently through the early part of the year and we should have higher than average temperatures Jan-March. We shall see!\n\n–\n\nWe’ve said it before that we are constantly amazed at the resilence of the plants growing in the garden with all the weather we’ve been experiencing (mostly wet, along with a few weeks of freezing temps and some bone chilling winds). We’ve been through it all in the past 12 months – extremely dry conditions and excessively wet… all of it feels like we’ve gained a greater perspective and new found respect for each season. Each one comes with it’s challenges and successes and we welcome the opportunity to grow better through them all and to have the experience and the confidence to know better the next time around.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nWe’re still hoping for a little winter sun here in the 10-day. We just need a few days coming up to give the garden and the pastures a moment to drain and feel the ol’ sun on our faces. It’s amazing what a little sun will do! When it graced us for several days in a row Brian and I couldn’t believe the difference it made in our energy level and excitement to be outside. It felt like a renewed sense of vigor! We’ve been making progress though – both inside and outside. Two weeks ago we finally hit send on our big 2016 seed order and are busy making the crop, field and planting plans. A few days ago we headed down to Concentrates in Milwaukee to pick up a few 6 cu ft. totes of organic potting soil and a whole pallet of organic amendments for the garden and minerals for the cows. We spend more time off the farm this time of year (than any other) preparing for the season to come. Once the end of February comes along we seldom leave the farm except when we need some diesel for the tractor or need to restock the pantry with the food items that we don’t grow. My Dad came to visit a few years ago for 10 days in May and still jokes that he didn’t see me leave the farm once… haha. It’s a different kind of lifestyle that’s for sure… that always manages to keep us busy and able to grow amazing, fresh, nourishing food for our community!\n\n–\n\nThere is plenty to do on the farm too. One of my next projects is to get the propagation house all ready for the first vegetables seeding of 2016.. it’s less than a month away! We’re also getting the tractors all tuned up for another season of growing… so many things to maintain during the winter months and opportunities to improve upon the systems that are already in place. All day long while we’re working we talk about how we can improve the systems on the farm to make the work load easier, more efficient, more enjoyable and more balanced. It seems impossible to talk about farming as much as we do… but somehow there is always something to talk about (and get started on…) 😉\n\n–\n\n–\n\nThe Winter CSA has been one of those opportunities that means finding a little bit more balance on the farm. Giving us the ability to spread out some of the workload throughout the year. . which could mean some pretty exciting things for us moving into the future. And can we just say that we have been loving the Winter CSA! The best perk so far is having access to so much delicious fresh food in the winter – with the Winter CSA it means that we (the farmers and the farm’s members) have eaten better than ever before. It’s been a truly enjoyable addition to the WHF CSA growing season and we’d like to extend a big thank you to all the first WHF Winter CSA members for joining us on this new journey! We’ve got some yummy winter goodies coming your way this week and look forward to hearing all the delicious home cooked meals you’ve prepared with them. Keep up the great work!\n\n–\n\nAnd…. a big thank you to all of our amazing CSA members both new and old who have signed up for the 2016 Spring and Summer CSA season!

We hope you all had a healthy, happy holiday and New Year! Although the winter has its perks with the shorter days, your farmers are feeling inspired and excited for Spring and another year of farming ahead! Thank you for all of your support this last season – we couldn’t be more excited for what is in store for 2016. Because of you and your investment in our farm it continues to thrive and get better and better with every passing year. The learning curve is becoming less steep, and we are feeling more confident no matter what ol’ mother nature throws at us.\n\n–\n\nAs most of you know sign ups for our 2016 CSA Season began last week!

We are just 6 days into January and we are more than halfway there to being full for the 2016 season. A big thank you to all of our amazing CSA members both new and old! Keep spreading the good word because it makes all the difference. As a farm-ily member once said, “keep your friends close and you farmers closer.”\n\n–\n\nAnd how about that snow, huh? The crazy cold winds and brisk weather before the snow left a lot of crops looking a little lack luster and dried out in the field at the end of last week. But it seems as though the snow and the milder weather that January has brought in has reinvigorated all the veggies that remain in the field. Vegetables really are incredibly resilient! Being a farmer is all about keeping the faith and being willing to take risks (and like it, to boot!) On a personal note, the snow was a warm welcome as it has this way of slowing everything down. The roads get a lot quieter and everything looks peacefully tucked into a giant blanket of white. The crunch beneath your feet.. all of it allows you to be exactly where you are and appreciate nature and the seasons. Change is a welcome thing.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nIt seems we went through it all in the 2015 season… after experiencing our driest Spring/Summer CSA season to date ol’ December was the wettest we’ve ever experienced here on the farm. The record breaking rain last month brought the biggest flood we’ve seen as well.. the pigs and cows have had a nice waterfront view for over 3 weeks and we’re happy to see our pastures again.\n\n–\n\nAs always, we are taking advantage of the mild days and are plowing ahead with projects and are VERY excited for the coming season on the farm. Spring is just around the corner (thank goodness the days are now getting longer). Winter can be a time of rest and recuperation for farmers but it is also a time for planning, revisiting notes from the previous year, solidifying the crop plan, ordering soil amendments, getting the propagation house up and going for the start of seeding, submitting the seed order, going over financial projections, figuring out ways to manage workflow in the busy season better etc, as well as some winter projects outside. This week, we’re buttoning up the rest of our seed order (we’ve made it to Peppers in the ol’ seed catalogues!) and are in the midst of our crop plan in anticipation of our greatest year yet!\n\n–\n\nWe’re so excited to continue on in this farming journey and to share it all with you.\n\n–\n\nStay warm out there!\n\n–\n\nWith kind regards,\n\n–\n\nYour Farmers\n\n–\n\nJess & Brian\n\n–\n\ndirty hands, clean hearts\n\n–\n\n–\n\nHappy New Years Friends & Farm-ily!\n\n–\n\nCSA Sign-Ups begin TODAY – January 1st! We hope the winter and holiday season is treating everyone well. Although the winter has its perks with the shorter days, your farmers are feeling inspired and excited for Spring and another year of farming ahead! Thank you for all of your support this last season – we couldn’t be more excited for what is in store for 2016. Because of you and your investment in our farm it continues to thrive and get better and better with every passing year.
