        "text": "As one of the leading boybands of the late '90s, Westlife took the world by storm, and still have legions of loyal fans to this day.\n\nFormed in 1998 as the Irish answer to Take That, Westlife went on to release 13 albums and embark on 12 world tours before going their separate way in 2012. And they were able to whip up the same magic formula following their 2018 reunion, with their comeback album Spectrum reaching a coveted number one spot.\n\nBehind the glamour of screaming crowds and packed out concerts spanning the globe, the five talented bandmates have all endured many ups and downs in their personal and professional lives, including a recent health update that left fans shaken.\n\nShane Filan, Mark Feehily, Brian McFadden, Nicky Byrne, and Kian Egan rose to fame through Westlife, but this was only the beginning of their stories. Here, the Mirror takes a look at what came next for the boys, from agonising IVF battles, to debt woes...\n\nShane Filan\n\nLead singer Shane Filan, 45 studied business and accounting before joining Westlife, but was left devastated when his property empire went bust in 2012, leaving him with debts of £18million. The Irish star and his brother Finbarr ran property development company Shafin Developments, and had taken out loans to build a 90-house estate in Dromahair, Co Leitrim, as well as a nursing home and a supermarket. But when the recession hit, their plans had to be shelved and the company collapsed.\n\nIn a statement issued at the time, Shane said: “I have worked long and hard to try to reduce my debts, and I am devastated that it came to this conclusion.\" Meanwhile Shane released three albums as a solo artist - You and Me in 2013, Right Here in 2015 and Love Always in 2017.\n\nHe married childhood sweetheart, Gillian Walsh, in 2003, who happens to be the cousin of bandmate Kian Egan. Together they have three children - Nicole, born 2005, Patrick, born 2008, and his namesake Shane, born 2010.\n\nBut his idyllic home life was shattered in the space of 10 months in 2020 when his 'hero' dad Peter died shortly after his beloved mum Mae. \"I lost the most important man in my entire life, my dad Peter,\" Shane told fans, revealing his father died 'peacefully in his sleep' in hospital after a year of ill-health. He was my best friend, my guidance through life and an absolutely amazing father. He was my hero,\" Shane continued.\n\nHis mum Mae died the December before, prompting an outpouring of grief from the showbiz industry, especially as she had been the one who convinced Westlife creator Louis Walsh to give her son a chance all those years ago.\n\nSpeaking to the Irish Independent, former X Factor judge Louis said: \"She rang me and said how good her son and the group were, and for some reason I believed her. Every mother says their son is brilliant. I believed Mae Filan. And I met them and there was something about them. They were rough around the edges.\"\n\nIn 2023, Shane and Gillian celebrated their 20th anniversary by returning to Ashford Castle in County Mayo where they first said 'I do'. 'Lucky' Shane penned the following sweet Instagram post: \"What an incredible 20 years married to this Lady@gillianfilansligo..and an unforgettable few days back in@ashfordcastleto celebrate. I’m a lucky man! Thank you to Catherine, Niall & Robert & all the staff at Ashford for making it so special for us both.\"\n\nMark Feehily\n\nMark, now 44, got everything he'd ever dreamed of in 2019 when he and fiancé Cailean O'Neill welcomed their baby daughter Layla. \"We’re the happiest Dads in the world!\" gushed the pair, who have been together for seven years and got engaged in the Maldives.\n\nMark came out as gay back in 2005 but sought therapy after bandmate Kian Egan noticed he was struggling. He explained: “I went to a counsellor at one point but I couldn’t get to the bottom of it and I couldn’t move forward.\n\n“And she said to me, it was in London, ‘You are homophobic’, and I was so shocked. I was so worried about what everyone else thought, none of them ended up giving a crap, it was all within me. I was the one who had the problem. It was a big lightbulb moment and it changed my life. It was the best thing I ever done. Like Kian from the band was one of the main people who helped me in that situation. He could just see that I wasn’t happy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mark was tipped to become one half of Strictly Come Dancing's first same-sex couple in 2020, with rumours swirling that he would be paired with dance professional Johannes Radebe. However, the gig ultimately went to Katya Jones and boxer Nicola Adams. Mark has also released solo music under the name Markus Feehily, and premiered his single, Love Is a Drug, back in February 2015.\n\nThings took a turn this past February however when Mark announced he would be temporarily leaving the band amid 'traumatic' health struggles. Taking to the band's official account on Instagram, Mark wrote: \"Hello and much love to you all! It's Mark here.. Most of you are aware that I have had some health challenges over the past while. It actually all started 3.5 years ago in August 2020 when I had surgery. Within a few days of this surgery I was in severe pain and was rushed into A&E.\n\n\"I eventually ended that awful day in ICU (Intensive Care Unit) where I was informed that due to a complication with the surgery, I had developed severe \"s epsis \", a life-threatening infection that would require immediate emergency surgery to rectify the problem and basically save my life. I spent the next few months in hospital. It was during lockdown. For months, due to strict Covid restrictions, I was not allowed any visitors including my fiance and my then 10-month-old daughter. It was physically and mentally a very difficult time, not to mention traumatic having to spend so long in ICU.\"\n\nAlthough he was discharged from hospital in December 2020, Mark has since suffered from ongoing medical problems. He continued: \"In late 2021, I became very ill in Newcastle before a concert and ended up back in A&E, this time being told I had pneumonia. I was told I had to go straight home to recover and regrettably miss the rest of the concerts that December. I was referred to a consultant who told me I needed more surgery which I went ahead with in May 2022 meaning I was forced to miss more of The Wild Dreams tour.\"\n\n\"Three months after that surgery, I tried my best to soldier on for you guys and to go back on tour but unfortunately the physical demands of the concerts and extensive travel were proving too much for me. I developed a very large 'incisional hernia' and I was told that I needed further surgery to fix it. This would be my fourth major surgery since the start of it all, but I had no option.\"\n\nThe surgery went according to plan, however Mark now needs to now focus on his recovery. \"It is with the upmost level of regret that I must now temporarily stand down from all Westlife touring until a time that I have had the chance to fully recover from the turbulent journey I have been through as an individual,\" he shared. \"Believe me, I wish things could be different! I would like to thank you so very much for your support and understanding of me and my health over the past few years.\"\n\nNicky Byrne\n\nNicky, 45, started out as a professional footballer with Leeds United, joining the team as a goalkeeper in 1995. He was a member of the squad when they won the FA Youth Cup in 1997, and played for the team for two years before his contract expired. A year later, he auditioned for Westlife and a very different career path suddenly opened up.\n\nIn 2003 he married childhood sweetheart Georgina Aherne, whose father is former Irish Taoiseach Bertie Aherne and sister is PS I Love You author Cecelia Aherne. They have 17 year old twins Rocco and Jay and a 10-year-old daughter called Gia. But like Shane, Nicky's world was blown apart by the premature death of a parent.\n\nIt was in 2009 that Nicky received an odd phone call from his mum as he was about to board a flight to the UK, asking if he'd seen his dad Nicholas because she couldn't get hold of him. Concerned, Nicky also tried repeatedly and asked his dad's colleague Neil to go to his workplace to check, where Nicholas was found unconscious on the floor. Nicky told Brian Dowling on his Death Becomes Him podcast: \"[Neil] said 'I'm just opening the door to his office now' and then the phone went dead.\"\n\nBy then Nicky's plane was taxiing down the runway, but the kind pilot agreed to stop to let the distraught star off. He immediately phoned the hospital, and their response told him everything he needed to know. \"They said, 'You need to come into the hospital, you don't need to rush but you need to come into the hospital,' so I knew he was gone,\" Nicky recalled. Nicholas was later found to have died of a sudden heart attack.\n\nIn between his years with Westlife, Nicky competed on Strictly in 2012 and has carved out a successful TV and radio career, hosting shows such as the Irish version of Dancing With the Stars.\n\nLast year, Nicky and Georgina redeclared their love for each other in a sweet vow renewal ceremony, sharing joyous snapshots of the celebration on Instagram. Nicky captioned the post: \"Summer House Party and we tied the knot again!!\"\n\nKian Egan\n\nKian, 44, won the 2013 series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here, and deeply moved viewers with his uncontrollable tears as he was reunited with his Hollyoaks actress wife Jodi Albert for the first time.\n\nHe released his solo album Home in 2014, which reached number 9 in the UK charts, and lives in his native Sligo with Jodi and their sons Koa, 12, Zekey, eight, and Cobi, six. Tragically, the couple were forced to endure two devastating bereavements. First they lost his father Kevin to cancer in 2010. He had been too ill to attend their Barbados wedding the year earlier.\n\nThen Jodi's mum Eileen was killed by the disease while her daughter was six months pregnant with Zekey in 2015. Eileen had first been diagnosed in 2009 but was given the all clear before the cancer returned. And the double loss broke their hearts. Kian told the Irish Independent: \"Eileen was a very strong woman and she had eight years of fighting really hard. It's never easy to see someone fight for her life for a long time, then lose the battle.\"\n\nAnd the experience has left its scars. \"I lost my dad that was a big low for us 10 years ago, same as Nicky, and my wife lost her mum,\" he told the Irish Mirror. \"But you know they are all things that happen in life no matter what you do so I suppose we're just living now in the real world and we're coming to that age where people are getting sick and starting to pass on us and the circle of life is just happening to us. I’m not that 20 year old little bubbly fella who is unscathed and unscarred anymore.\"\n\nIn 2022, Jodi shared that they have suffered a miscarriage in a heartbreaking Instagram post. Jodi wrote: \"This one hit differently because we allowed ourselves to get excited and dream about what the future would look like with a new beautiful little blessing to add to our family.\" Praising her 'amazing' husband for being her rock, Jodi concluded: \"You are the most amazing man.. I love you and our boys so much and am so grateful for what I already have.\"\n\nBrian McFadden\n\nBrian, now 44, quit Westlife in 2004, just months before his marriage to Kerry Katona ended. Announcing his departure, he explained he wanted out to spend more time with Atomic Kitten star Kerry and their two daughters Molly and Lily.\n\nBut after parting ways with Kerry, he launched a solo career, started dating Australian singer Delta Goodrem and moved Down Under. And he later admitted his decision to walk away from Westlife came after the band was told to cover Barry Manilow's hit Mandy.\n\nHe told the Irish Independent: \"That was definitely a turning point. I've always been very proud of Westlife, and I still think that we never got the respect we deserved, but I was f**king ashamed of that song. From the second we went into the studio to record it, I lost all interest.\"\n\nHe insisted that while there had been 'arguments', the parting had been on good terms and they all remained friends. Over the years, Brian has made several murmurings about wanting back in, but in 2006, Nicky made it clear that door was firmly closed.\n\nHe told The Mirror: \"The honest answer would be that we wouldn't have him back in the group anyway. We all get on great with Brian but we couldn't go back to having five in the group because it was such an upheaval when he left. We had to re-build and start from scratch and we're a different group now. We've moved on and Brian knows that as much as we do. If you are asking me if we would let him re-join the group then the answer is no.\"\n\nAnd in 2018, Brian claimed they'd been offered a mega-bucks deal to reunite as a five-piece, but said the other four had snubbed him. I was offered a big multi-million pound deal. It was the other boys in Westlife who said 'no'. They didn't want me back,\" he told the Irish Sun. How does that make me feel? It makes me pretty upset because I didn't realise they still had those feelings towards me.\"\n\nIn 2023, the Daily Star reported that Brian admitted he wasn't friends with his former Westlife bandmates, and that they didn't stay in touch. He revealed: \"It's the same as, you know, you have friends in college. A lot of them you probably won't see after you leave college, so it's just because our lives took different directions. My life was in Australia and America. So I had a very short time in the UK. It is not a conscious decision of 'we don't talk to each other'. It's more of a 'we have moved on with our lives'.\"\n\nBrian's personal life has been equally as tumultuous. After splitting with Delta, he married Vogue Williams in a lavish Tuscan ceremony on 2 September 2012. \"We instantly clicked and talked non-stop for eight hours the night we met and I proposed eight months later,\" Brian told The Belfast Telegraph. Within three weeks she moved to Australia to be with me. Although it was a whirlwind romance, it was just so right from the beginning, so we knew it would work.\"\n\nHe added: \"Meeting her was a life changer for me – she's my soulmate. Getting married hasn't changed anything – it was perfect anyway – but it has made us both feel quite grown-up. We like nothing better than just staying in and spending time together as a couple when we're not working.”\n\nBut after three years it was all over, with Vogue - who is now married to Made In Chelsea's Spencer Matthews - harshly claiming the thought of their union \"makes me a little bit sick in my mouth.\" Brian is now engaged to Danielle Parkinson, a sports teacher from Rochdale. the pair welcomed daughter Ruby in 2021 following three attempts at IVF.\n\nThe couple suffered two heartbreaking miscarriages before Zara and Mike Tindall put them in touch with a nutritionist who helped them conceive through IVF. Danielle said: \"It does [feel like a miracle] but I feel awful saying that, as I've had so many messages on Instagram. The IVF community is so lovely and I've heard real traumatic stories from people who have been trying for 10 years, people who have had eight-plus miscarriages, so I feel we got lucky on our third attempt.\"\n\nOpening up during an interview with OK! magazine, Brian gushed about baby Ruby saying: “She’s brilliant. She’s sleeping right through, waking up after me!” He added: “She’s still very young. We balance our life very well. We make sure our home life does come first. We still love what we do, but it will never trump the time we spend with our families. It’s not like we’re gone for six months any more.”\n\nWould you like to see Brian McFadden rejoin Westlife?
