        "text": "Cape Town - Irish singer and songwriter Brian McFadden’s SA tour will kick off on 16 November at Platteland a new venue in Centurion. The former Westlife heartthrob will then continue his tour with two shows in Stellenbosch on 17 and 18 November 2018.\n\nAhead of the series of shows Channel24 gave Brian a call just as he was about to tee off in The UK.\n\nThe new contestant on Britain's Dancing on Ice, told us about how he tries to visit South Africa at least once a year, his new album and tour and what he always takes with him on tour.\n\nHERE’S CHANNEL24’S INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN MCFADDEN:\n\n(Photo: Getty)\n\nAbout coming back to South Africa on tour, Brian said: \"South Africa is one of my favourite countries in the world. I’ve already been back once this year and I actually try to get to South Africa at least once a year. I play at the Gary Player Invitational most years, and if I’m not doing that I just enjoy a great holiday in SA with my family and friends.\"\n\nAbout his favourite town or place to visit in South Africa, Brian said that he is a big fan of the Mother City, explaining: \"I love Cape Town, it is beautiful. I also do love to go to Sun City, it is magical.\"\n\nWhen it comes to one of the exports Cape Town is most famous for, wine, Brian confessed: \"To be honest with you, I’m Irish, so if it’s wet and it’s made out of alcohol we enjoy it.\"\n\nOn what makes this album and upcoming tour different than his previous ones the prolific musician mused: \"Well, I have had a band with me before, on my own solo records. But this is a first time I am doing a show with a nine-piece-band because it was different in the studio. You know, usually you record everything separately and then all the tracks get put together, but with this record the nine-piece was in the studio with me, recording the song with me in just one take, all together. It was a new experience.\n\n\"So, as far as the show goes, I’ll have the big band with me on stage to try and replicate that onstage. I think, pretty much, nobody does that (recording live in one take) anymore.\"\n\nWhen it comes to choosing between being a presenter and being a muso, Brian's response is immediate: \"My favourite thing in the world is being live in front of an audience. It’s always been my favourite. I do like presenting though, it’s something different. Just to give myself a bit of a break and to do something different is good because I have been doing music for over 16 years now. But obviously, singing is my priority and I am happy to be back doing that again.\"\n\nBrian is just as easily forthcoming about the one thing he always takes on tour with him: \"My golf clubs. I have to take my golf clubs with me everywhere in the world, it used to be my guitar but it got replaced with my golf clubs. I'll be playing at the Gary Player Invitational again this year.\"\n\nBRIAN MCFADDEN - SOUL JAM TOUR DATES:\n\nCENTURION, GAUTENG\n\nDATE: Friday, 16 November 2018\n\nVENUE: Platteland\n\nTIME: Doors open at 19:00\n\nTICKET PRICES: All tickets are R180 and can be bought at the Webtickets website.\n\nSTELLENBOSCH, WESTERN CAPE:\n\nDATE: Saturday, 17 November 2018\n\nVENUE: Spier Wine Estate, Spier Amphitheatre\n\nTIME: Doors open at 16:30\n\nTICKET PRICES: All tickets are R180 and can be bought at the Webtickets website.\n\nSTELLENBOSCH, WESTERN CAPE:"
