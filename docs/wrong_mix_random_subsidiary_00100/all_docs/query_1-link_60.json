        "text": "Life Story\n\nBrian E. McFadden age 61, was a wonderful man born on October 5, 1959, to Raymond McFadden and Elizabeth “Mae” O’Conner Clark in South Bend Indiana.\n\nBrian attended the Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall in his youth. He could weld anything metal or steel. He enjoyed his hobbies, including camping, fishing, electronics and scrapping. He thoroughly enjoyed nature, hiking in the woods and watching animals and wildlife interact. Many evenings you could see him making jokes and making others smile. And quite occasionally singing karaoke at local establishments, and even received a Second-Place ribbon and Trophy. He also enjoyed flying, especially in small airplanes whether that they be conventional or powered hang gliders.\n\nBrian would always stand up for the underdog always trying to be a good person. He was a friend of everybody. He loved being the center of attention.\n\nHe leaves to cherish his love and memories: his mother; Elizabeth Mae Clark of Elkhart, two daughters: Kayla McFadden, and Trenda McFadden of Argos; a brother Terry Duncan of Elkhart, and twelve grandchildren and the love of his life Christine Butterworth and his special adopted children, Jeremy, Jennifer and Justin.\n\nServices celebrating Brian’s life will begin at Billings Funeral Home at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday, July 21st, 2021, with visitation from 1:00 p.m. 3:00 PM at Billings Funeral Home. Interment will follow at Olive West Cemetery, Elkhart.\n\nTo share a memory of Brian or send a condolence to his family, please visit www.billingsfuneralhome.com."
