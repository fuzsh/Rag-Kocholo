        "text": "Brian Nicholas McFadden (born 12 April 1980) is an Irish singer-songwriter and TV presenter who rose to fame in 1998 as a member of the Irish boyband Westlife. When he resided in Australia, he was a judge on Australia's Got Talent. Following his departure from Westlife in 2004, McFadden released his debut solo album, Irish Son, which peaked within the top 5 on both the Danish and Irish Albums Charts, and produced his first two No. 1 solo singles \"Real to Me\" in four European countries and also \"Almost Here\", a duet with his now ex-fiancÃ©e Delta Goodrem which gained a platinum accreditation in Australia. \"Like Only a Woman Can\", the lead single from his second album, Set in Stone (2008), became his third No. 1 single as a solo artist. In 2010, McFadden scored his fourth No. 1 with the hit single \"Just Say So\", featuring American singer Kevin Rudolf, and gained his second Australian platinum accreditation. The single received a nomination at the 2010 ARIA Music Awards for Most Popular Australian Single.\n\nEarly life\n\nMcFadden was born in Dublin, Ireland, and was raised Catholic. Throughout his younger years, he always had an interest in singing, dancing and football. Along with his sister Susan, McFadden attended the Billie Barry Stage School in Dublin, which led him to doing stage and TV roles, including a role in the Irish TV show Finbar's Class, a comedy revolving around a group of student-swingers. In early 1998, he formed a pop-R&B group with his friends Tim and Darragh, called Cartel, and performed live gigs in Dublin pubs.\n\n1998â2004: Westlife\n\nn June 1998, McFadden auditioned for Irish male band Westlife and was against another blond Nicky Byrne and eventually both joined the group alongside Kian Egan, Mark Feehily and Shane Filan. After joining, he changed the spelling of his name from Brian to Bryan to make it easier to sign autographs. With McFadden as part of the group, Westlife released their first single, Swear It Again, four Irish No. 1 studio albums and a No. 1 greatest hits album. They also released seventeen Irish top 5 singles including the hit single \"Uptown Girl\", which peaked within the top 10 in seven European countries and also in Australia and New Zealand. In March 2004, McFadden left the group to spend more time with his family and work on solo projects. He subsequently began a solo career and decided to revert the spelling of his first name back to its original, \"Brian\". Before launching his solo career he co-wrote the song \"If My World Stopped Turning\", which was sung by Ireland's entry Chris Doran in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004.\n\n2004â06: Irish Son\n\nFollowing his departure from Westlife, McFadden signed to major record label, Sony BMG. In September 2004, he released his debut solo single \"Real to Me\", which became his first solo No. 1 single in Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Norway. His second single and title track, \"Irish Son\", peaked within the top 10 on the British and Ireland Singles Charts. Following the release of the two singles, McFadden released his debut solo album, Irish Son, in November 2004 and it peaked within the top 10 on the Irish Albums Chart. McFadden co-wrote most of the songs on the album with Guy Chambers, best known for his successful collaboration with Robbie Williams and INXS. The third single \"Almost Here\", a duet with Australian singer Delta Goodrem became McFadden's second No. 1 single in Ireland as a solo artist and his first in Australia and gained a platinum accreditation there.[2] The fourth and final single, \"Demons\" peaked within the top 30 on the charts in Ireland and Britain. McFadden continued writing songs for artists such as, Il Divo and Girls Aloud, as well as co-writing the theme song \"Together We Are One\" for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. That same year, McFadden collaborated with American singer LeAnn Rimes on the song, \"Everybody's Someone\".\n\n2007â08: Label change and Set in Stone\n\nWhile working on the second album, McFadden's record label, Sony BMG insisted that he work with an A&R man, after disappointing sales of his last album, which only sold 800,000 copies worldwide. However, there were claims that McFadden's A&R man did not want McFadden to work with Guy Chambers, who had previously worked with McFadden on his last album and fought about his songs and musical direction. His A&R man wanted him to make songs like James Morrison, Paolo Nutini and the Scissor Sisters but McFadden insisted he make songs that are of his style. It was later revealed in March 2007 that McFadden parted ways with Sony BMG. Later that year, he set up his own record label under the name of BMF Records and released his new single \"Like Only a Woman Can\" in Ireland, through the label. \"Like Only a Woman Can\" became his third Irish No. 1 single as a solo artist. In early 2008, McFadden signed to Universal Music Australia and released the single there in April 2008, which peaked within the ARIA top 15. Following the release of \"Like Only a Woman Can\", McFadden released his second studio album, Set in Stone. The album peaked in Australia at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Other singles were released from the album: \"Twisted\" peaked within the top 30 on the ARIA Singles Chart and \"Everything But You\" failed to chart the ARIA top 50.\n\n2010: Wall of Soundz\n\nIn April 2010, McFadden released \"Just Say So\", which features American rapper Kevin Rudolf. The single debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at No. 1 and stayed there for three weeks. It spent seven weeks in the ARIA top ten and thirteen weeks in the ARIA top 50 and gained a platinum accreditation. Following the release of \"Just Say So\", McFadden released his third studio album, Wall of Soundz, in Australia on 23 April 2010. The album was originally going to be released as a side-project McFadden embarked on with American songwriter Rob Conley but both decided to release it as McFadden's third solo album. It debuted at No. 27 on the ARIA Albums Chart and spent only three weeks in the ARIA top 50. \"Chemical Rush\" was the second single released from the album in June 2010 and peaked at No. 12 on the charts. In September 2010, McFadden released the third single entitled \"Mistakes\", a duet with his then fiancÃ©e Delta Goodrem. McFadden also recorded a duet with Ronan Keating on Keating's duet album, a cover of the Bee Gees' \"To Love Somebody\".\n\n2011â12: Just The Way You Are and the controversy\n\nOn 25 February 2011, McFadden released a new single \"Just the Way You Are (Drunk at the Bar)\". The song has been criticised as a glorification of date rape. McFadden's cancelled the shooting of a proposed pop video for the song; he asked that the song not be played on the radio and pledged via his Twitter account to donate all proceeds from the song to rape victims. \"Just the Way You Are (Drunk at the Bar)\" debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at number sixty-one on 8 March 2011, and peaked at number forty-nine the next week.\n\nIn June 2011, McFadden appeared on Australian radio show The Kyle & Jackie O Show to launch both of his new singles Come Party and That's How Life Goes, which was co-written by multi-platinum singer, songwriter and producer Ray Ruffin. Despite heavy promotion and appearances on TV shows such as Dancing With the Stars, the new singles failed to impact the charts at all, which was surprising considering his high-profile appearances on Australia's Got Talent. Some of this has been attributed to the negative press surrounding his previous single \"Just the Way You Are (Drunk at the Bar)\". This, as well as his much-publicized split with Delta Goodrem, appear to have had a negative impact on his music career. There is speculation that the release of his fourth album may be put on hold.\n\nMcFadden released his new single \"Wrap My Arms\" on 20 January 2012 in Australia. The song was used in a Promo for Home and Away and it managed to peak at 70 in the ARIA top 100.\n\n2012â17: The Irish Connection and Boyzlife\n\nOn 13 September 2012, McFadden announced the release of his fourth studio album, The Irish Connection, featuring covers of his favourite Irish songs as well as duets with Ronan Keating and SinÃ©ad O'Connor. The album was recorded in both Sydney and Dublin. This album features none of McFadden's past five single releases which do not appear in an album format to date.\n\nOn 18 September 2012 Ronan Keating announced that McFadden would be joining him on his 2013 UK Fires Tour. He toured with Keith Duffy as Boyzlive in 2017 and 2016.\n\nsources cited form https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_McFadden"
