        "text": "Bronx-based author and community leader Sulma Arzu-Brown and NYU professor Dr. Shatima Jones will take part in a panel discussion following the film.\n\nIn this documentary Chris Rock visits beauty salons and hairstyling battles, scientific laboratories and Indian temples to explore the way hairstyles impact the activities, pocketbooks, sexual relationships, and self-esteem of the black community.\n\nPrompted by Rock's daughter approaching him and asking, \"Daddy, how come I don't have good hair?\", Good Hair shows Rock engaging in frank, funny conversations with hair-care professionals, beauty shop, and barbershop patrons, and celebrities including Dr. Maya Angelou and others - all while he struggles with the task of figuring out how to respond to his daughter's question.\n\nSULMA ARZU-BROWN is community leader with an extensive resume, Sulma Arzu-Brown has authored a children’s book that centers on positive awareness for young readers.\"Bad Hair Does Not Exist!\" a bilingual book that encourages young Black, Afro-Latino, and multi-racial girls to see themselves, and their hair, as beautiful. Sulma Arzu-Brown, is a Garifuna woman and Afro-Latino from Honduras, was inspired to write the book after her three-year-old daughter's babysitter used the colloquial term \"pelo malo,\" which is a Spanish term for \"bad hair\" to describe little Bella's curly textured hair.\n\nArzu-Brown has worked as a job developer for BronxWorks helping formerly incarcerated fathers find employment opportunities. Arzu-Brown now serves as the New York City Hispanic Chamber of Commerce’s director of operations and is tasked with providing quality networking events, seminars, and fundraisers which seek to establish long lasting partnerships with members in support of Hispanic businesses and the community NYCHCC serves. In addition to her work with NYCHCC, Arzu-Brown is a Hunts Point Community Advisory Board member and co-owner of the Boogie Down Grind Cafe.\n\nArzu-Brown has received the Entre Nosotros Award from former Councilwoman Maria del Carmen Arroyo and Assemblywoman Carmen Arroyo in recognition of her book and was honored by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli for her work with NYCHCC.

JONES is an Assistant Professor Faculty Fellow in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis and the Department of Sociology. She earned her doctorate in sociology at Rutgers University, where she also received her master’s degree; and she holds a BA in sociology from Hunter College. Shatima is interested in the intersection of race, space, gender, and culture. Her dissertation, “Performing Race and Shaping Community in the Black Barbershop” focuses on how black people interpret and perform their racial identity, the processes by which they create community based on these understandings, and the significance of place and space in shaping these sentiments. The bulk of Shatima’s research employs ethnographic methods to uncover what black people think constitutes an “authentic” racial identity, how they signal this to others in everyday interaction, and how racially exclusive places shape understandings and performances of race.\n\nAt NYU, Shatima is writing a book manuscript based on her dissertation research. She is also embarking on a new ethnographic project focusing on women’s hair salons in order to explore gender differences in racial performance.\n\nThis screening is held in conjunction with the BDC's current exhibition \"From Mobutu to Beyonce\" by Émilie Régnier, which explores the ongoing cultural conversation between Africa and the West.

If passed, the rezoning will lead to construction of housing units, but also, many believe, to the end of a proud culture of industry and work in this last bastion of New York City’s working class.\n\nThe Bronx Photo League (BPL), a project of the Bronx Documentary Center, is made up of 16 Bronx photographers committed to documenting social issues and change in our borough.\n\nThe portraits in this show were shot on Kodak Tri-X negative film with Hasselblad cameras and lenses. Authentic silver gelatin darkroom prints will be on display.\n\nLearn more about the project and the BPL at www.jeromeaveworkers.com\n\nMembers of the Bronx Photo League will be in attendance as well as the portrait subjects and their families.\n\nFEATURING\n\nRozlin Ahmed\n\nTajonnie Amoah\n\nAmber Castillo\n\nDavid Delgado\n\nFanta Diop\n\nNailea Dominquez\n\nKeven Estrella\n\nSamantha Fajardo\n\nAlejandro Flores\n\nFritzi Garcia\n\nMelanie Genao\n\nBrenda Hernandez\n\nJanet Hernandez\n\nJanet Lozano\n\nTianna Maldonado\n\nTamara Mitchell\n\nHarry Montas\n\nIsis Negrón\n\nNicholas Noriega\n\nGeorgianna Oyola\n\nJoseph Pacheco\n\nEthan Perez\n\nChloe Rodriguez\n\nShianne Williams\n\nThe Bronx Junior Photo League is a free after-school program where Bronx students learn how to utilize the power of documentary photography and storytelling to explore their community.\n\nThe class, comprised of 11-18 year-olds from our Bronx community, will be displaying their final photo and multimedia projects at the Bronx Documentary Center on June 3rd.\n\nThe Bronx Junior Photo League was taught by Bianca Farrow, Cynthia Rivera, Elias Williams, Kholood Eid, Jon Santiago, Michael Kamber and Groana Melendez.\n\nThis program was generously supported by Fujifilm USA.\n\nPhoto © Fanta Diop, 7th Grade, Bronx Junior Photo League\n\nJoin us as photographer Fabio Bucciarelli presents his work and talks about his long term photographic project The Dream, on view at the BDC from March 10-27th.\n\nBucciarelli has spent five years documenting the causes and consequences of the largest refugee migration since World War II.

Horvath\n\n“Photography is not a hobby for me. It’s a way of life.” Mahmoud Abou Zeid, better known as \"Shawkan\", an Egyptian photojournalist wrote from the infamous Tora prison. Shawkan has been imprisoned since August 14, 2013, when he was arrested while covering the dispersal of a protest of supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsi, one of the most violent events in the country’s modern history. Shawkan, who was 25 at the time of his arrest, has now spent more than 1000 days behind bars.\n\nShawkan’s photos are a poignant reminder of the early optimism of the Egyptian revolution and the uprisings which swept the Arab world. From celebrations in Tahrir Square to revolutionary graffiti, the fact that his last photos feel dated is a visual testament to how long he’s been behind bars. Shawkan’s arrest is a marker of a dramatic change in Egypt, which has since transformed into one of the world’s worst jailers of journalists.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) is showcasing the work of Shawkan in order to advocate for his swift release, and to highlight the plight of journalists and journalism in Egypt today. Shawkan is a recipient of CPJ’s 2016 International Press Freedom Award.\n\nThe first screening of our 2nd Annual Women’s Film Series.

A portion of the prison population certainly consists of pathological criminals. But what about all the others?”– Jan Banning\n\nIn 2008, Dutch photographer Jan Banning gained worldwide recognition with the release of his book Bureaucratics (Nazraeli Press) that garnered rave reviews and sold out quickly. Edited by Martin Parr, it contains 50 environmental portraits of civil servants in eight countries: Bolivia, China, France, India, Liberia, Russia, the United States and Yemen.\n\nJan Banning’s newest book, Law & Order: The World of Criminal Justice, which releases in the United States this fall, is a natural extension of Bureaucratics. The book is a rare and innovative examination of criminal justice combining the world of photographic art with that of legal science. Banning’s photographs reveal the daily realities of the police, the courts, the prisoners, and the often hidden prison conditions in four countries: Colombia, France, Uganda and the United States.\n\nJan Banning will discuss his work with noted photo editor and independent curator Elisabeth Biondi followed by a book signing.\n\nJAN BANNING is a Dutch autonomous artist/photographer, based in Utrecht, the Netherlands. He was born in Almelo\n\n(Netherlands) on May 4, 1954, from Dutch East Indies parents, and he studied social and economic history at the Radbout University of Nijmegen. Banning’s art work has been acquired by museums such as the High Museum of Art, Atlanta, GA; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX; and the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. His photo series have been published in print media that include Days Japan, GEO (France, Germany, and International), l’Espresso, Newsweek (US and Japan), One World, Sunday Times Magazine, The New Yorker, The Guardian Weekend, National Geographic, Time, Vrij Nederland, among many other outlets. Banning has been the subject of a television documentary by Frank van Osch entitled A Touch of Cruelty.

The book, though acclaimed at the time, was also controversial. Critics applauded the revealing nature of the stories, but often added, as if in the same breath, that what was being shown was a negative view of the country, one that lacked hope. Pushed to reply, Richards countered that these stories were, in fact, portraits in courage. Each person encountered on his journey across America was struggling, against great odds, to better him or herself.\n\nOn the occasion of its 5th anniversary in October 2016, the BDC is honored to present Below the Line: Living Poor in America by Eugene Richards. The exhibition will feature more than two dozen black and white photographs from Richards's seminal project that depicts the extent of poverty in the United States in the mid 1980s. The project garnered Richards the 1987 International Center of Photography Infinity Award for Outstanding Accomplishment in Photographic Reportage.\n\nPublished by Consumer Reports Books in 1987, Below the Line consisted of taped interviews and photographs made by Richards during a seven-month journey across America in 1986 visiting poor rural and urban communities in eleven states from Massachusetts to Wyoming. Richards writes: \"As one person's history unfolded, I was often directed towards others. When I was with embattled farmers in South Dakota, I was moved to think of the migrant laborers who also worked the land, yet have no title to it. The family I visited in the Tennessee Mountains was barely hanging onto their ancestral homeland. How must it be, then, for people newly arrived in this country that must adapt to a new language, different customs, to an inhospitable economy? In the Arkansas Delta, the grandchildren of the aging and weary sharecroppers I photographed could barely wait to get away from home, to Chicago or New York, which held more promise for them... \"\n\nThe BDC's Melrose neighborhood in the Bronx remains one of America's poorest communities, located just four subway stops away from one of the country's wealthiest, the Upper East side of Manhattan. It is the BDC's hope that Richards's powerful exhibition will stimulate a dialogue between the local communities it serves and the world at large about actionable steps to fight poverty.\n\nBelow the Line: Living Poor in America was made possible with the support of: NY Culture, Ford Foundation, State of the Arts NYSCA, Art Works, National Endownment of the Arts\n\nRejoice and Shout is the definitive history of gospel music - some of the most emotional and powerful music in the world, and the foundation of the blues, country and rock n' roll.\n\nPacked with evocative photos, rare audio, recordings, stirring film appearances and TV performances, Rejoice and Shout is a jubilant journey through the 200 year musical history of African-American Christianity. Culled from hundreds of hours of music, the film features interviews and performances from the most celebrated voices in gospel music, including: Smokey Robinson, Mavis Staples and the Staple Singers, Mahalia Jackson, Clara Ward, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Andrae Crouch, The Blind Boys of Alabama, the Selvey Family, Darrel Petties and many more.\n\nThis screening is held in conjunction with our current photo exhibition Not Forgotten: An Arkansas Family Album by Nina Robinson on view at the BDC until May 29th\n\nIn 2014, Nina Robinson traveled to Dalark, Arkansas to document her grandmother's passing and her family's grieving process. She became engrossed in the often overlooked rural African American communities surrounding Dalark, communities whose members are mostly working and middle class landowners. Her visit turned into a two-year project, Not Forgotten: An Arkansas Family Album.\n\nMs. Robinson’s family has a storied history in Arkansas extending back six generations. In her photos, the viewer witnesses the passing of older members as traditions are preserved and handed down to the young. The photographer has extensively documented the many gatherings, celebrations and reunions--at churches and a once segregated local high school--that serve as anchors for Dalark’s Black community.\n\nNot Forgotten: An Arkansas Family Album is a unique and intimate exploration of loss, love and tradition in a rural Black community.\n\nNINA ROBINSON is a documentary and portrait photographer based in the South Bronx and Arkansas. In her work, Robinson examines issues in underrepresented communities, aiming to break the visual prejudices of race, class and age. She has been published in The New York Times, was named one of Time Magazine’s “Instagram Photographers to Follow in All 50 States” and has exhibited at the Bronx Museum of the Arts. Robinson teaches a phototherapy program at the William Hodson Senior Center, where, through the use of photography, older residents are able to openly explore personal and social issues. She is a member of the Bronx Photo League, a collective of documentary photographers in the South Bronx.\n\nNot Forgotten: An Arkansas Family Album is sponsored by Fujifilm Cameras, New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, Art Works and National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nPractical Information, Concrete Steps\n\nSunday March 5th, 1-6PM\n\nImmaculate Conception School, 378 East 151st Street, Bronx, NY\n\nJoin us for the BDC's 4th Annual Bronx Gentrification Conference bringing together community residents with leading experts in zoning, tenants' rights, investigative practices and much more.\n\nBronx residents and workers only. Limited workshop seating is available--you must pre-register.\n\nThis year’s conference will focus on a series of workshops that will provide residents an understanding of gentrification in the Bronx and the organizing tools to push back and/or mitigate the effects. Each workshop will take place in three 30-minutes sessions, giving participants the opportunity to attend in three workshops during the conference. Childcare will be available.\n\nInformation is Power\n\nThe following are the workshops that will be available during the conference:\n\nWho Makes the Plans?\n\nDaphne Lundi\n\nThe urban planning profession has historically been, and still remains, a predominately white field. Urban planners are one of the many agents that help shape housing policy, infrastructure planning, and economic development initiatives in neighborhoods across the city. It is important that the planning field better reflect the diversity of the city as a whole. In this workshop participants will be introduced to the urban planning profession, explore ways in which their local knowledge and understanding of neighborhoods mirrors many of the skills that urban planners are trained in, and identify key points that planners need to know working in New York City neighborhoods.\n\nAddressing Landlord Harassment: A Holistic Approach\n\nTiffany Femiano, Michele Yankson, Porsha Shaf'on Venable, and Runa Rajagopal, The Bronx Defenders\n\nAre you experiencing harassment from your landlord? Know your your rights! This workshop will address your rights and responsibilities around what to do if you are experiencing harassment/in fear of landlord retaliation and are worried about your housing. We have housing, criminal defense/immigration expertise to address your questions and concerns.\n\nWhat is Zoning?\n\nMark Torrey, The Center for Urban Pedagogy\n\nZoning law regulates land use across the city and shapes buildings, blocks, and whole neighborhoods. It can be a tool for preservation or for rapid physical and economic development. How does it work? Why is it so controversial? This set of activities explains the zoning of density, bulk, land use, and how proposed rezonings could affect your neighborhood.\n\nReimagining Community Land Trusts\n\nA. Mychal Johnson and Angel ‘Monxo’ López Santiago, South Bronx Unite\n\nThis workshop will examine how community land trusts can help stop hyper real estate speculation in the age of mass development and community displacement.\n\nUrban Renewal, Redlining, Rezoning and Race\n\nHarry DiRienzo, Banana Kelly; Tahica Fredericks, Banana Kelly Resident Council/Picture the Homeless Leader; Fitzroy Christian, CASA Leader/Bronx Coalition for Community Vision Leader and Spokesperson\n\nThis workshop will explore the historically racist motivations behind major government-sponsored and supported land use actions. We will look at lessons learned, and how the Bronx Coalition for a Community Vision is building power to plan in a way that is fair and equitable first and foremost to the local residents and businesses, as well as those in surrounding communities.\n\nWhat’s On My Block?\n\nLisa Riordan Seville\n\nWhat's coming to your block? In this workshop, you'll learn step-by-step tools to use public databases to get insight into what new developments are being built and who owns the buildings your block. We'll also talk about tools that don't require a computer for those without a computer or internet at home.\n\nGentrification and Health Equity: Strategies for Community Wellness\n\nElizabeth Hamby\n\nIn New York City, your zip code says more about your health than your genetic code. Differences in health outcomes, from rates of disease to life expectancy mean that your neighborhood might literally be making you sick. This is unfair, and unjust. Join public health researchers from New York University to learn about the connections between neighborhoods, gentrification, and health. We will talk about how to understand the health of your neighborhood, as well as concrete steps you can take to protect community wellness.\n\nHome Ownership and Collective Power\n\nJasmine Murrill and Jason Isaacs\n\nDuring this interactive, solution-focused workshop, participants will be invited to reflect on their own relationship to money and ownership from an emotional and psychological perspective. We will also discuss practical resources and strategies for those interested in ownership as well as share our own path to homeownership.\n\nActivist Oral Histories\n\nMarty Rogers and Libertad Guerra\n\nCome share your stories! Activists and community members Marty Rogers and Libertad Guerra will moderate and encourage attendees to tell their stories of organizing and community successes in pushing for fair and just communities. They will also discuss struggles and successes from years past, including reopening firehouses and closing the medical waste incinerator in the South Bronx.\n\nArt, Culture, Community: Examining Strategies\n\nDanielle Jackson\n\nWhat can the arts look like in our community in the face of new real estate development? This workshop explores the ways artists and non-artists can get together to shape the places where the live and work.\n\nBuilding and Preserving Affordable Housing In Today's Bronx\n\nNancy Biberman, WHEDco\n\nThe workshop will discuss issues that affect Bronx residents in the current real estate landscape: (1) Achieving deeper affordability in publicly-financed new housing construction; (2) Maintaining a community preference for new affordable housing without running afoul of Fair Housing Laws; and (3) The inherent tension between advocacy and development.\n\nConference Agenda:\n\n1:00-1:45PM: Welcome and Workshop Announcements\n\n1:45-2:00PM: Transition to First Workshop\n\n2:00-2:30PM: Workshops [Round 1]\n\n2:30-2:40PM: Rotate to Next Workshop\n\n2:40-3:10PM: Workshops [Round 2]\n\n3:10-3:20PM: Rotate to Next Workshop\n\n3:20-3:50PM: Workshops [Round 3]\n\n4:00-4:15PM: Reconvene for WNYC Panel\n\n4:30-6:00PM: ”Keeping the South Bronx Affordable”\n\nWNYC Panel Discussion with Mychal Johnson, Diana Hernandez, Jacob McIntosh, Juanita Lara, and Dilcia Mercedes\n\n5:30-6:00PM: Closing Remarks\n\nAs part of the Bronx Documentary Center's Holiday Portraits, Bronx residents and families are invited to be photographed as part of our Father's Day Portraits.

Just try to put down this book without looking at every image, without feeling each person in your gut, in your heart. It’s impossible.”– Kim Barker\n\nIn the fall of 2001, the award-winning American photojournalist Paula Bronstein travelled to Afghanistan on assignment for Getty Images to document the U.S-led “Occupation Enduring Freedom” in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Captivated by the indomitable resilience and spirit of the Afghan people and the rugged beauty of their country’s landscape, Bronstein has made Afghanistan her mission ever since. She has returned to the country repeatedly over the past 14 years to document the lives of the Afghan people against the backdrop of a brutal and protracted war. This remarkable and nuanced body of work is gathered together for the first time in Bronstein’s powerful new monograph Afghanistan: Between Hope and Fear (University of Texas Press, June 2016).\n\nWhat sets Bronstein’s photographs apart from many of her peers is her choice to spend most of her time with the Afghan people. Her work goes beyond war coverage to reveal the full complexity of daily life in what may be the most reported on, yet least understood country in the world. The result is an intimate photographic portrait of this war-torn country’s people spanning 2001-2015. With empathy born of the challenges of being a female photojournalist working in a conservative Islamic country, Bronstein gives voice to many Afghans who remain silenced by Taliban repression, particularly women and children.\n\nRepresented by Getty Images Reportage, Bronstein documents the on-going challenges still facing the country today—among them, human rights abuses against women, poverty, heroin addiction and increased violence and instability—to the stirrings of new hope, including women participating in elections for the first time, education for girls, and expanded job and recreational opportunities for both men and women.\n\nAfghanistan is cited by international rights groups as one of the worst places to live if you are born female and Bronstein’s searing photographs bear this out – from her depiction of the struggle of Afghanistan’s over 2.5 million war widows many of whom are left penniless and powerless and forced to beg on the streets, to the anguish and desperation of Afghan women who practice self-immolation to escape forced marriages and domestic abuse. Bronstein counters the tough issues with positive photographs of women active at political rallies and girls engaged in learning in school classrooms.\n\nAt the core of Bronstein’s work is her compassion for her subjects and her ability to gain extraordinary access to document the hope and beauty as well as the harsh realities of their lives. She is relentless in her pursuit of stories she believes must be shared with the world, and she goes after them, sometimes at great personal risk.\n\nIn her afterword in the book, Bronstein writes: “I have made some of the most extraordinary photos of my career in Afghanistan, with face after face offering a complex and intriguing gaze and revealing the constant tension between optimism and reality that shapes the lives of so many here. I keep going back, motivated and inspired by those faces, pushing against the difficulties, hoping to find fewer doors slamming shut and more people seeing reasons to smile.”\n\nIn her introduction, fellow award-winning journalist Christina Lamb describes the gains that Afghan women have made since the overthrow of the Taliban, as well as the daunting obstacles they still face, and Kim Barker, a staff reporter for The New York Times, writes the foreword. Afghanistan: Between Hope and Fear is an eloquent portrait of everyday life and a story about the legacy of America’s longest war. This important and beautiful volume is the most complete visual narrative history of the country currently in print.\n\nWith over 30 years in the news business, Paula Bronstein is one of America’s most distinguished female photojournalists. She has won numerous awards, among them: Pictures of the Year International; National Press Photographers Association (Runner up: “Photographer Of The Year”); The Pulitzer Prize (Finalist: “Breaking News”); The Overseas Press Club of America (John Faber Award); Foreign Correspondents Club: Thailand (“Asia Photographer of the Year”); Leica Oskar Barnack Award (Finalist); and China International Press Photo (“Photo Of The Year”).

We recommend audience members watch episodes 1 and 2 in advance here.\n\nWith unprecedented access, Flint Town is an intimate look inside a struggling police department that follows an ensemble cast of officers as they grapple with the challenges of policing a broken city while nationally, tensions between the police and community are more fragile than ever. Through very candid, and often unheard voices, both black and white police officers confront notions of race, implicit bias, and use of force in policing a city like Flint.\n\nFlint is one of the most relevant cities in America. It’s also one of the poorest and most violent. But it wasn’t always this way. Flint used to be the poster city for middle-class America. In the 1970’s, when General Motors employed most of the city, Flint had the highest median income in the country. Today, it has the lowest. Schools have shut down, thousands of homes are abandoned and those that remain occupied have little to no value. People are desperate. As a result, crime and murder rates continue to soar. And now, with the water crisis, Flint has become the focal point for Americans who have been left behind in this new global economy.\n\nIn the middle of this situation is the Flint Police Department. Despite the need for adequate resources to deal with the high crime rates in Flint, the FPD has long been one of the most understaffed police departments in America. Over the last ten years, they’ve seen their numbers go from 300 officers to less than 100. They have 8 officers on patrol at any given time. For a city of 100,000 people, that’s ¼ the national average. Now, with all that’s going on in Flint, the water crisis, a new mayor, a new police chief and rumors of civil unrest, the Flint Police are trying to keep the city and themselves from imploding.\n\nBIOS\n\nZACKARY CANEPARI (USA, 1979) is a visual storyteller working in a variety of different mediums. He began his career as a photojournalist in India/Pakistan before teaming with filmmaker Drea Cooper in 2010 and launching California is a place, a documentary film series which screened at Sundance and was viewed more than two million times.\n\nThe California series created new opportunities in both the commercial space and the editorial space for Canepari’s work and led to the project that first sent him to Flint, Michigan. The documentary feature film T-Rex, also co-directed by Drea Cooper, told the story of teenage Olympic boxer and Flint native, Claressa \"T-Rex\" Shields. T-Rex premiered at SXSW in March 2015 and was featured on PBS in August 2016.\n\nCanepari then released his first monograph about Flint, titled REX, which was published by Contrasto and won Photobook of the Year at the POYi Awards. In 2016, he launched Flint is a place, a sort of version 2.0 to the California project. Flint is a place consists of reportage, short films, found photos, virtual reality, interactive maps, and archival material. Canepari’s ongoing work in Flint resulted in his first World Press Photo Award and being named as Multimedia Photographer of the Year at the POYi Awards in 2016.\n\nJESSICA DIMMOCK is the recipient of numerous international awards for her photography and video work, including two World Press Photo awards for short films, The Inge Morath Award from Magnum, the F Award for Concerned Photography from Forma and Fabrica, The Infinity Award for Journalist of the Year from the International Center of Photography, and The Kodak Award for Best Cinematography at the Hamptons International Film Festival.\n\nShe is a Sundance Edit and Story Lab Fellow, and her first feature film, The Pearl, was awarded the Grand Jury Prize at the Dallas International Film Festival. She was listed as one of the \"25 New Faces of Independent Film\" by Filmmaker Magazine and was nominated for an Emmy for her work for a Doctors Without Borders short film series.\n\nJessica began her film work when the artist Moby asked her to direct a music video for his upcoming single, \"Wait For Me,\" and since then her clients have included HBO, The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, Microsoft, The UNFPA, Showtime, and PBS. She is also the director of the Netflix documentary series, Flint Town.\n\nBRIAN WILLINGHAM was born and raised in Flint Michigan during the civil rights era.
