        "text": "Veteran broadcast journalist Brian McFadden has covered the entertainment industry for many years. In addition to working for UPI, he wrote for several magazines devoted to movies and music. A Wall Street Journal Radio anchor for more than two decades, he also freelanced at some of New York City's largest radio stations, taught online at Seton Hall University and lectured at The New School for Continuing Education in New York. McFadden began interviewing celebrities while still in college, where he met with show business icons like Bob Hope and Judy Garland. He continued to speak with major film, television and recording stars throughout his career, and has written several popular books about those he found most interesting. Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly were among his favorites. These two wonderful actresses will always be known for their groundbreaking show \"Cagney and Lacey,\" and for their commitment to the realistic portrayal of working women. McFadden tells of their successful efforts to save the show and their triumphs and sorrows later on. As in his previous work, \"Remembering Perry Mason with Raymond Burr,\" much of the material comes from exclusive interviews. McFadden is also the author of the first-ever book about another ground-breaking woman in Hollywood, Debra Hill. He met the extraordinary producer of the original \"Halloween\" just after she and John Carpenter had finished shooting the film, but before it was a hit. She went on to produce \"The Fog,\" \"Escape from New York,\" \"The Fisher King,\" and so many others. In his books, the author often includes pertinent material from less frequently interviewed personalities as well, like character actors, friends and family. Extra touches like these are what make his books so special to TV, film and music fans.\n\nRead full bio"
