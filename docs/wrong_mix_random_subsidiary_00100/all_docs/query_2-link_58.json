        "text": "Brian McFadden\n\nClient Services Director\n\nClient services director Brian McFadden has worked in recruitment for more than 20 years. He set up RECRUITERS with Gerard Doyle in 2006 because he saw a gap in the market between large recruitment agencies and niche professional services firms.\n\nAs a consultant, Brian works with clients to simplify problems and find solutions either through better recruitment processes, benchmarking existing talent within organisations to leverage them or indeed sometimes replace them with new talent that can drive the business forward. He also drives our executive search service for employers at RECRUITERS having many years' experience both in Ireland and internationally placing C-Suite Executives. In addition to overseeing the quality of service that each of our consultants provides to our clients, Brian specialises in placing the following executives:\n\nCIOs, CTOs, CMOs and Directors.\n\nBefore RECRUITERS, Brian became the highest performing consultant in technology and senior appointments in one of Ireland's largest plc recruitment companies, then specialist executive search internationally for consumer goods. He also holds a masters in work and organisational psychology.\n\nIn his spare time, Brian likes going to the gym, running, swimming and cycling as well as cooking, reading, photography, woodwork and joinery."
