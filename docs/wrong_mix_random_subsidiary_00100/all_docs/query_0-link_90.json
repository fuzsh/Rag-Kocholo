His name is synonymous with Saturday Night Live, the iconic American late-night TV show that he created and produced.

In the mid-1960s, he wrote for various shows like Laugh-In and The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show before making his mark with Saturday Night Live in 1975. Michaels's role in shaping Saturday Night Live was instrumental. Under his pioneering leadership, the program became a platform for many rising comedians who later turned into industry stalwarts. Comedians like Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler, and Tina Fey owe their big break to Michaels. He was not just a producer but also wrote for the show, which amplified its success across audiences.

In 1998, Grand Ayatollah Sistani issued a statement against Sachedina that advised Muslims not to listen to his talks or to ask him questions about religious matters. In 1997, Grand Ayatollah Lotfollah Safi Golpaygani thanked him for his translation of a book on Imam Mahdi into English, originally written by Ayatollah Ebrahim Amini. The acknowledgement letter was published by the Iranian Hawza magazine.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell ('Graham' pronounced ) (March 3, 1847 â€“ August 2, 1922) was a Scottish-born American inventor, scientist, and engineer who is credited with inventing and patenting the first practical telephone. He also founded the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1885.Bell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work. His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone in 1876. Bell considered his invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.Many other inventions marked Bell's later life, including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils, and aeronautics. Although Bell was not one of the 33 founders of the National Geographic Society, he had a strong influence on the magazine while serving as the second president from January 7, 1898, until 1903."
