        "text": "Brian Laurence McFadden, 50, passed away March 7, 2024. He was born December 11, 1973 in Akron, the son of the late James A. And Wilma McFadden. Brian will always be remembered as a laid back guy with a great sense of humor. He would talk to anyone and was always friendly. Brian was employed at the Schaeffler Group. In his free time, Brian could be found working on his 1987 Monte Carlo SS. He was a skilled mechanic and an avid car enthusiast. At home, Brian loved making breakfast for his family and he was known for his amazing blueberry pancakes. Going fishing with his family was one of his favorite things. Brian is survived by his loving wife Nicole; daughter Rebecca; sons Alexander and Brandon; siblings Ronald (Sherri) McFadden, Kelly (Jerry) Duhme; James Michael McFadden, and Randy McFadden; mother-in-law Vonne Mitchell; brother-in-law Ryan Mitchell; niece and nephew “who were like siblings” Paula Marie Mook and Arthur James McFadden; great nieces and nephews A.J., Amaya, Alyssa, Dan, Steven, and Ashley Nicole; special friends Roger (Kim) Haas, Tom Rock, and Matt Spinks; as well as his husky Stella, miniature weiner dog Reese, and his cat Jupiter. The family will receive friends 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, Friday, March 29, 2024 at the Adams Mason Funeral Home (791 E. Market Street), where a memorial service will immediately follow at 4:00 PM. Pastor Dwayne Ray will officiate.
