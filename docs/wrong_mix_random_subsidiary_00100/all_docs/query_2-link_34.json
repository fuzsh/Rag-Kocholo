        "text": "One fifth of one of the biggest boy bands in the world, now a solo artist in his own right, at the age of just 26, Brian has all the hard won wisdom of a music veteran, but with none of the cynicism. Having sold 30 million records and picked up twelve UK number 1s with Westlife, Brians passion for making music is undiminished and invigorating.\n\nHis debut solo album, Irish Son released in October 2004, produced the number smash 1, Real To Me and the top 5 singles, Irish Son and Almost Here.\n\nBrian then took to the road on a series of short intimate sets showcasing material from the new album and has just announced a 24-date tour for May and June 2005. The tour kicked off May 23rd in Southend and ended June 26th in Brighton.\n\nThats the difference with the album. I love touring with it, its got a live feel and you can really perform it.\n\nEngaging and frank, Brian describes his new solo album as largely autobiographical, every song he admits is a true story. Half the album was written in collaboration with Guy Chambers and the other half with Paul Barry and producer Mark Taylor. The album is a genuine tour de force, a record stuffed with anthemic rock hits, perfectly showcasing the genuine rock and roll swagger of Brians voice. The album is produced by Guy Chambers, Richard Flack and Mark Taylor. Going in I had some ideas about what I wanted it all to sound like but basically we started from scratch and just saw how things went. Lyrically I had loads of ideas and concepts and those guys were great at just bringing things out of me.\n\nProduction started on the album in May 2004, Its been quick but then some of the best tracks on the album were written really quickly. Paul and I formed a strong writing relationship right away and I wrote, Real To Me with Guy on our very first meeting. We just clicked right away.\n\nBrian approached the album entirely focused on the music. When Brian talks about the album he speaks with all the fresh and infectious energy of someone making their very first record. For Brian the primary aim was to make the best record possible and find a sound that truly reflects his style, all other factors were secondary. I just really want to be an artist on my own terms making music that I am really proud of, says Brian. Of course I want people to like it and listen to it and hopefully they will. Westlife fans have grown up with us and I think there is space in the new sound for everyone.\n\nThis tough new sound is influenced by a whole range of different bands and groups including the band he manages in Ireland: Franklin. I really like Maroon 5 and Snow Patrol at the moment, says Brian, I have always been into guitar stuff, from Bryan Adams to Nirvana.\n\nAs a solo artist, Brian has truly found his voice, producing lyrically mature and incisive music with energy and passion. Willing to take risks and experiment with his new sound, Brian is also proud of his past, well aware that he was part of something special with Westlife. I am blessed to be where I am, and am just really excited to be able to make music I love.\n\nIn recent months Brian has collaborated with numerous luminaries including Paul Barry (Enrique Inglesias/Cher) and Phil Thornalley (Natalie Imruglia/The Cure). The net result is a more mature artist than we have previously known. Brian claims that he has never been happier and more focussed. Right now is the best place Ive been in my life. Im really enjoying writing and recording the album and personally things have never been better!\n\nApart from his success as a recording artist McFadden can feel justifiably proud of his achievements as a songwriter. With solo records reaching Number 1 in UK, Ireland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Holland Belgium and Australia, he has also been critically recognised with his song Demons being featured in the U.S. TV series Lost. In addition, Brian has also written songs for artists as diverse as Il Divo and Girls Aloud, as well as the theme for the Theme for the Commonwealth Games.\n\nFuture projects include further writing with Delta Goodrem, a collaboration with Westlifes Mark Feehily as well as the completion of the new solo album and the development of the BMF label internationally. I admire artists like George Michael who had the guts to establish their own identity in the business and thats what I aspire to do.\n\nAlthough McFaddens name appears on over 50 million CDs throughout the world, he stresses that this release means most to him. I am proud of my past, but Im really excited about my future."
