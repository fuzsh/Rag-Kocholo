Darcie Friesen Hossack\n\nAnother child is dying in Gaza as I type. Another one now. And now. And now.\n\nA mother slides into the blood of what’s left of her son, her daughter, and picks up a severed hand to hold, one last time. A father gathers the pieces of his children into a Ziploc bag so they can have a grave that isn’t under their shattered home.\n\nIn Israel, women wait, wail for their husbands, their sons, to come home. Will they? Will they still be themselves if they do? And what is happening to the women and girls still held by Hamas, who slink through their tunnels, paid for with bread money, meant to feed their people?\n\nDoes anyone outside Israel remember the music festival now? The kibbutzes now? The murdered families? The hatred that was ejaculated into women, into girls, before a shot to their heads?\n\nAnd Ukraine. Do we still weep for Ukraine two years into Russia’s invasion? Or think of Sudan, ten months into a war of unspeakable violence that must be spoken and loudly, for all the world to know. A war that’s been invisible to the West, including myself. With gang rapes (there are always gang rapes). And the killing of parents in front of their children (there is always killing of parents in front of their children). 1.7 million refugees have fled their homes.\n\nIn Russia, Navalny is dead. Who will fight for a different vision of Russia now? Who will dare oppose power now?\n\nFor those of us at WordCity Literary Journal, the poetry and most of the prose in this issue deal with war. It is dedicated to those lost to and lost in the violence of humankind’s collective failure to love one another enough not to take aim and kill. It is an indictment of our failure to elect (where that is possible) leaders who understand that the loss of one innocent life is one too many. A memorial to our human failure to see ourselves and our loved ones in the faces of the “other.”\n\nWe have no solutions here.\n\nTerrorists and authoritarians and the corrupt, those who have destroyed their own humanity for the sake of power, and hide from the consequences of their own crimes, will not stop and will not surrender.\n\nAt the same time, on the streets of our cities, in our shops and workplaces and schools, we throw sticks and stones with our words, too foul to repeat here. Too foul, too, to close our ears and refuse to hear.\n\nAntisemitism is on the rise. Islamophobia, too. And instead of reaching to one another with compassion and mutual sorrow, to many of us tighten our fists with hate for one other and for each other’s flags.\n\nStop. Just stop.\n\nThat’s what we ask.\n\nTake this time to read. Read aloud, even. Listen. And really listen to the words in this issue. To what those who are in pain have to say. And then go out and love your neighbour, knowing that everyone is your neighbour.\n\nPlease.\n\nFiction. edited by Sylvia Petter\n\nWilliam Cass\n\nReckless\n\nWhen I was a little boy, I lived for a short time with my uncle’s family while my mom, his younger sister, spent a stint in rehab. He had a big house on a lake in a wealthy enclave of Detroit and stayed home most of the time, so I was never sure what he did for work. Besides his wife, who I remember as grim and generally invisible, my cousin, Gary, also lived there. I was nine at the time, and Gary was a few years older. He wasn’t happy about me moving in and treated me with open disdain. As a result, I avoided him and sequestered myself in the bedroom they put me in. The room had a small roll-top desk, antique and mahogany, that I loved and which my uncle had owned since before he was married. I was intrigued by all its little nooks and hidden crannies; for some reason, it felt both exotic and cozy to me. My uncle knew how I felt and held a similar affinity for the desk, and it created a kind of quiet bond between us.\n\nMy mother’s rehab stint, which was finally a successful one, ended after six weeks, and I returned with her to Cleveland where they’d grown up and where she’d secured a job in a halfway house. Even with our proximity to my uncle’s family, we had no real contact with them again that I was aware of aside from Christmas cards. My mother eventually ran several halfway houses in the area, and I matriculated through college there, too, before beginning my career as an elementary school teacher in an older suburb nearby. My brief marriage ended abruptly when my wife left me for another man, but I filled my time afterwards outside work as best I could with activities like long walks, baking, and trying to learn to play the clarinet. My mother passed away not long after my divorce, just after I turned thirty, and several years later, I received an email at work from Gary telling me that his mother and father had died, too, in a car accident.\n\n“I located your email address on your district’s website,” he wrote. “I remembered from one of your mom’s Christmas cards that you’d been teaching in Middleburg Heights. Anyway, I wanted you to know about my parents’ deaths and that my father left you that old roll-top desk of his in his will. I don’t have your home address, so I shipped it to your school. Hope that’s okay.”\n\nI was in my classroom during a lunch break as I read his message and sat back shaking my head when I finished. I frowned as I re-read it and wasn’t sure how to reply, so just typed, “Okay, thanks. Very sorry for your loss.” Then I logged off and stared out over the empty student desks. It was raining, I remember, the sound of it mingling with student voices from the cafeteria down the hall. I’d already begun imagining which important items I’d store in the desk and how I’d arrange them.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nMaria Saba\n\nDad’s Work\n\nMy mother sews. She buys yards and yards of white fabric, cuts them into long pieces, which she stiches together to make large sacks. Once, when she was out, I went into one and rolled around on the floor. I couldn’t see her coming because I was inside the sack. I heard her scream and tried to unwind myself. She pulled me out and then she squeezed me in her arms and made me promise never to do that again. I didn’t understand why but promised just to stop her tears.\n\nMy father shoots. On the last Friday of each month my father takes me to work. We carry these white sacks and place them on a shelf. Then my father takes his gun from a cabinet and goes to the prison courtyard. I spread my notebook and crayons on his desk at the office. I tear up a page and put it aside to keep a ledger.\n\nYek, do, seh. Bang.\n\nI hear a thud and draw a line on my ledger and then a two-storey brick house with four windows, two on each floor, and a purple door.\n\nYek, do, seh. Bang.\n\nI hear a thud and add a line to my ledger and a chimney to my house. Smoke goes out of the chimney toward a yellow sun with rays spreading in all directions.\n\nYek, do, seh. Bang.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nNon-Fiction. Edited by Olga Stein\n\nOlga Stein and Yahia Lababidi\n\nConversation\n\nHe who fights monsters should see to it that, in the process, he does not become a monster.\n\n— Nietzsche\n\nOpen Letter To Israel\n\nBy Yahia Lababidi\n\nTell me, what steel entered your heart,\n\nwhat fear made you rabid,\n\nwhat hate drove out pity?\n\nHow could you forget\n\nthat how we fight a battle\n\ndetermines who we become.\n\nWhen did you grow reckless\n\nwith the state of your soul?\n\nWe are responsible for our enemy.\n\nCompassion is to consider the role\n\nthat we play in their creation.\n\nIf you prick us, do we not bleed?\n\nIf you poison us, do we not die?\n\nAnd if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?\n\nStrange, how one hate enables another;\n\nhow they are like unconscious allies,\n\ndarkly united in blocking out the Light.\n\nYes, we can lend ideas our breath, but ideals —\n\nPeace, Justice, Freedom — require our entire lives,\n\nand, all who are tormented by such ideals\n\nmust learn to make an ally of humility.\n\nTruth and conscience can be like large, bothersome flies —\n\nbrush them away and they return, buzzing louder:\n\n30,000 souls lost, 2/3 of whom are women & children …\n\nthese are unbearable casualties to ignore.\n\nTo speak nothing of the intangible casualties:\n\ndamage done to our collective psyche, trust, and sleep.\n\nNo more nightmares. Please, give us back our dreams.\n\nWe can still begin, again, and must.\n\nWisdom is a return to innocence.\n\n* * *\n\nI do not love you right now\n\nBy Olga Stein\n\nI do not love you right now,\n\nthough one day I may.\n\nRight now, I do not love the you with angry eyes,\n\nintense and beautiful.\n\n(Pardon me, for the unintended exoticizing;\n\nand for nearly writing exorcizing, by mistake.)\n\nI see you standing across the street\n\nbeneath the arched doorway with colourful stones,\n\nannouncing the gateway to a home.\n\nYou remind me of a panther, with eyes that watch,\n\nwait for me to lower my guard,\n\nso you can spring and tear me to shreds.\n\nI do not love this you.\n\nYou do not acknowledge the beauty in me/us.\n\nOne day, when you begin to love me back —\n\nwhen you smile and call me sis or aunt or your Rita —\n\nthen I will love and honour you\n\nperhaps more than myself.\n\n* * *\n\nContinue Reading\n\nCy Strom with Bänoo Zan\n\nWoman, Life, Freedom: Poems for the Iranian Revolution\n\nReflections on the Anthology and on Activism in the Arts\n\nI have been thinking for a time of what I’m about to say from an outsider’s perspective. Well, the world is small enough to make all of us insiders.\n\nThis is another insider’s perspective.\n\nIran is on the other side of the world. Ukraine, on the other hand, is a little bit closer to us here in Canada, and if anyone here has been transfixed by the war in Ukraine, they will most likely know that Russia uses Iranian drones against Ukraine’s cities. Similarly, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard army has sent thousands of Syrian refugees our way with the part it played in viciously suppressing the uprising against Syria’s dictator.\n\nIf Canadian citizens can’t always count on their safety in China, as we saw with the imprisonment of the two Michaels, Canadians also can’t count on being safe in Iran, where twenty years ago the journalist Zahra Kazemi, a Canadian citizen, was tortured to death in Tehran’s Evin Prison.\n\nThere’s all that to ruminate on at a time like this, and there’s also the simple reality that women’s rights are human rights. A Nobel Peace Prize laureate spoke here in Toronto in September 2023. This was Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian woman.[1] She was a judge in Tehran before the Islamic Republic swept her and other women off the bench. So she resumed her career as a human rights lawyer, and she’s now forced to live in exile. What Shirin Ebadi told her Toronto audience was that democracy in Iran would come in through the gate of women’s rights.\n\nWe can no longer imagine a working democratic government anywhere on earth where one-half of the population are second-class citizens and all leadership positions are reserved by law and custom for men alone. And we can’t imagine a benevolent, humane, or even workable society that marginalizes its women.\n\nPut simply, it has been 44 years since the revolution that led to the Islamic Republic, and a large part of Iran’s population has had enough. We would say that the regime has lost its legitimacy: its aims and ideals no longer ring true for the people, and its systems and methods don’t serve any desirable purpose for them. You can compare this disillusionment and frustration with the level of alienation the populations of Eastern Europe felt towards their own governments before the Berlin Wall fell.\n\nBut a government that has lost its legitimacy can still carry on if it has cold steel in its heart.\n\nOver the years there have been periodic waves of protests in Iran. Many of these were quashed with rivers of blood, sometimes targeting the country’s minorities for special violence. The protestors complained about things like the government raising prices of necessities, or the national election commission falsifying the count in the presidential election. Yet it took one atrocity against a single woman, Mahsa Jina Amini, to spark the revolution (no mere protest) happening now, which is a call for an end to the system, not for its reform.\n\nThe slogan chanted by the demonstrators in Iran and by their supporters outside Iran is now recognized worldwide: Woman, Life, Freedom. It encompasses hopes and ideals for all people everywhere. The poetry anthology we are publicizing and supporting aims to echo the cry “Woman, Life, Freedom,” and to spread it.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nLiterary Spotlight. Lisa Pasold in Conversation with Sue Burge\n\nFor this issue, I am delighted to be interviewing Lisa Pasold, a peripatetic powerhouse of a writer who defies definition!\n\nLisa, you are a very well travelled writer and I know you are based in both Paris and New Orleans as well as having grown up in Canada. So firstly, how did you become a writer? Did you know from early on that that’s what you wanted to do and did where you were living at the time feed into/influence your writing? What drew you to Paris? Was it the city’s rich associations with literature, language and culture or something else…?\n\nI knew I wanted to be a writer from the time that I could read. The first book I read for myself was Dr Seuss’ Hop on Pop, a poetry classic of sorts. Growing up in Montréal, I heard many languages—two official ones, French & English, but also a great cosmopolitan range of other languages including Kanyen’kéha (Mohawk) the main Indigenous language of the area. My parents accumulated books in every room of the house, from Shakespeare to Sci-Fi paperbacks to multi-volume academic histories of Peru. Plus, while I was a kid, my mother was studying to get her Masters degree in Canadian Literature—a radical move in the 1970s, since Canadians traditionally studied “classics”, aka European writers. So, from the moment I understood books were a thing, I also understood that literature was alive, especially as I went with my parents to all kinds of readings—formal university author talks, bookstore launches, and wild hippy performance events. I started writing “officially” when I was six, making chapbooks out of left-over fabric and paper bags—my mum was very into recycle/reuse before it was cool, so there were always craft materials available. As for Paris, that was more of a chance encounter: my father is originally Czech, and when I was twenty, I wanted to rediscover my European roots; since I don’t speak Czech or German, I ended up in Paris for purely practical reasons—I can speak French. But then, I fell in love with the city.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nBooks and Reviews. Edited by Geraldine Sinyuy\n\nWinter’s Reward of Words. A Review of Books by Gordon Phinn\n\nBooks Referenced:\n\nDirty Money, Financial Crime in Canada, Christian Leuprecht & Jamie Ferrill, (McGill/Queens 2023)\n\nThe Scent of Flowers at Night, Leila Slimani (Coronet, 2023)\n\nStray Dogs, Rawi Hage (Knopf Canada 2023)\n\nThe Syrian Ladies Benevolent Society, Christine Estima (Anansi 2023)\n\nImagining Imagining, Gary Barwin (Wolsak & Wynn 2023)\n\nWe Could Have Been Friends, My Father and I, Raja Shehadeh (Other Press 2023)\n\nLike Figs in Autumn, Ben Bastomski (Delphinium Books 2023)\n\nInstead, Maria Coffey (Rocky Mountain Books 2023)\n\nAnd The Andes Disappeared, Caroline Dawson (Bookhug Press 2023)\n\nTwo Purdys, A Double Portrait, Brian Purdy (Pottersfield Press 2023)\n\nSome would say summer at the cottage or the beach, while others might argue for the cool departures of autumn, and yet others the front porch with the first tastes of spring sun, coffee, toast, fruit of one’s choice, but for me winter is the optimum season for postponing one’s life with all manner of narrative detours, the poetry of exhilaration, exhaustion and all points in between. Those long hours of dark can become a contagion of cozy once the burden of indoor chores is shoved aside. Skiers and skaters need not apply, while domestic pets are required to sleep by one’s slippers.\n\nNow that that is taken care of let’s plunge into the snake pit of Dirty Money, where moral compasses always point to cheating, a sobering compendium of financial skullduggery right here in our home and native land. With chapters like “Washing Money In A Canadian Laundromat”, “Taken To The Cleaners: How Canada Can Start To Fix Its Money-Laundering Problem”, “Underground Banking In Canada”, “Canadian Cryptocurrency Conundrums: A Socio-Technical Systems Analysis of Crypto Laundering In Canada” and “Task Specialization in Organized Crime Groups: Money Laundering and the Montreal Mafia”, you can see the breadth of the investigative scope involved. If you found yourself satisfied with the one or two articles and scandal scooping you may have come across in the popular press, then go no further. This worthy collection is aimed at those involved in the field as analysts, investigators and ambitious thesis architects. It belongs on reference shelves where it can be consulted for the deep dive it provides. Make no mistake though, our beloved country is up to its neck in financial irregularities and illegalities, despite the continued efforts of those involved in its discovery, exposure and eradication. If I may go all Zen on you for a moment, both problems and their solutions arise simultaneously out of the void, ready to be activated. Life invites you to cheer for whatever team strikes your fancy, and it has lately come to my attention that purveyors of lies and fraud seem to be doing awfully well in the heroes and villains’ stakes.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nDiana Manole’s Praying to a Landed-Immigrant God.\n\nA review by Adriana Onita\n\n“Stubbornly I keep writing poems in Romanian”: Review of Diana Manole’s New Dual-Language Collection\n\nDiana Manole immigrated to Canada in 2000, but she never stopped writing in her mother tongue. After twenty-three years in the country, her seventh poetry book, Praying to a Landed-Immigrant God / Rugându-mă la un Dumnezeu emigrant (2023), found a home with Niagara Falls, Canada-based indie publisher Grey Borders Books. This English-Romanian dual-language edition surprises the reader with every turn of the page:\n\nMă încăpăţânez să scriu versuri în româneşte\n\nşi mă îndrăgostesc de fiecare cuvânt\n\nStubbornly I keep writing poems in Romanian\n\nand falling in love with every line\n\nManole wrote all but three of the autobiographical poems in this collection in Romanian and then co-translated them into English with her long-time collaborator, Adam J.

He had a big house on a lake in a wealthy enclave of Detroit and stayed home most of the time, so I was never sure what he did for work. Besides his wife, who I remember as grim and generally invisible, my cousin, Gary, also lived there. I was nine at the time, and Gary was a few years older. He wasn’t happy about me moving in and treated me with open disdain. As a result, I avoided him and sequestered myself in the bedroom they put me in. The room had a small roll-top desk, antique and mahogany, that I loved and which my uncle had owned since before he was married. I was intrigued by all its little nooks and hidden crannies; for some reason, it felt both exotic and cozy to me. My uncle knew how I felt and held a similar affinity for the desk, and it created a kind of quiet bond between us.\n\nMy mother’s rehab stint, which was finally a successful one, ended after six weeks, and I returned with her to Cleveland where they’d grown up and where she’d secured a job in a halfway house. Even with our proximity to my uncle’s family, we had no real contact with them again that I was aware of aside from Christmas cards. My mother eventually ran several halfway houses in the area, and I matriculated through college there, too, before beginning my career as an elementary school teacher in an older suburb nearby. My brief marriage ended abruptly when my wife left me for another man, but I filled my time afterwards outside work as best I could with activities like long walks, baking, and trying to learn to play the clarinet. My mother passed away not long after my divorce, just after I turned thirty, and several years later, I received an email at work from Gary telling me that his mother and father had died, too, in a car accident.\n\n“I located your email address on your district’s website,” he wrote. “I remembered from one of your mom’s Christmas cards that you’d been teaching in Middleburg Heights. Anyway, I wanted you to know about my parents’ deaths and that my father left you that old roll-top desk of his in his will. I don’t have your home address, so I shipped it to your school. Hope that’s okay.”\n\nI was in my classroom during a lunch break as I read his message and sat back shaking my head when I finished. I frowned as I re-read it and wasn’t sure how to reply, so just typed, “Okay, thanks. Very sorry for your loss.” Then I logged off and stared out over the empty student desks. It was raining, I remember, the sound of it mingling with student voices from the cafeteria down the hall. I’d already begun imagining which important items I’d store in the desk and how I’d arrange them.\n\n~\n\nWhen I was passing through our school’s front office a few afternoons later, our attendance clerk pointed to a large cardboard box in the corner and told me that it had been delivered for me earlier that day. I saw that it had come from Detroit, tried its weight, and was able to carry it awkwardly to my truck in the staff parking lot. I got it into my house and unpacked it in my living room. It looked exactly the same as I remembered it, right down to its dark, faded finish. Even the dust accumulated in its corners appeared unchanged. I settled it against the wall in an open spot next to my wood stove, moved an extra dining room chair in front of it, and tried the lid. It opened easily, making the little ratcheting sound I recalled fondly as it did. But I was surprised to see that none of its contents had been removed. Those, too, seemed to be identical to the dim memories I had of them as a boy: stacks of letters in envelopes yellowed with age in the same slot behind a sliding false wall, rusted paper clips in a tiny dish, fountain pens arranged by size in a felt-lined drawer, old black-and-white photographs scattered under the leather blotter, and a smattering of other items exactly as I last recalled seeing them when I was nine years old. They retained, as well, the same musty smell that I remembered from all those years ago. Why hadn’t Gary emptied it before shipping it to me? Had he even looked inside it before doing that? Had he ever?\n\nI took out a handful of the weathered envelopes and saw that they all had an identical return address in Toledo scrawled in neat script. As I read a few of the letters inside, a flush spread through me; they all expressed my uncle’s undying love for a woman named Rita. I rifled through the stack examining the postmark dates, which comprised a period of about a year before my uncle had married my aunt and then had Gary. All were unabashedly romantic; many included sexual references. There were more than fifty of them.\n\nI turned next to the photos under the blotter. There was only a dozen or so of those, and each featured the same young woman. Some also included a younger version of my uncle with his arm around her or holding her hand. She was taller and slimmer than my aunt, very attractive, and always wore a smaller smile than my uncle’s. A few had her name, Rita, on the back and dates that approximated those on the envelopes.\n\nI finished studying the last of the photos, then sat back in my chair and wondered what to do. Sending the letters and photos back to Gary seemed somehow a violation of my uncle’s privacy. Similarly, I was reluctant to replace them with items of my own, then storing them away somewhere instead of the home they’d silently, and it appeared secretly, occupied over those many years. I didn’t remember anyone else in their family using that bedroom I’d been given in my uncle’s house when I’d been there, and I imagined him entering that room by himself from time to time, closing the door behind him, sitting at the desk, re-reading those letters, fondling those photos. After a while, I realized it had begun to rain again outside. I closed the lid on the desk, patted it once to be sure it was secure, and went into the kitchen to start dinner.\n\n~\n\nI did nothing about the roll-top desk’s contents except ponder for the next couple of weeks. I spent some time clearing space in the crate where I’d stored my ex-wife’s things after she left – lingering over the framed photos from our wedding, the few clothes that still retained her scent, the snow globe that I’d bought her for our last anniversary, the brief note from her that was waiting for me on the kitchen counter the day she’d left. There was room in the crate afterwards for the desk’s contents, and I considered the symmetry of a joint sanctuary of loss for my uncle and me, but in the end, to put them there seemed somehow irreverent. I thought, too, about not doing anything at all with them, but then the desk would serve nothing but an ornamental purpose for me to stare at in my still, silent living room. I did, instead, eventually read all the letters and arranged the photos in the most accurate chronological manner I could manage; their abrupt ending puzzled me.\n\nIn mid-November, an idea finally occurred to me. I knew the prospects were unlikely that Rita was still connected to the return address on the envelopes or that, already in her mid-sixties, she was even alive anymore, but I still took a chance and wrote to her. I simply explained who I was, how I’d come to obtain the desk, about the letters and photos, and asked her if she’d like to have them. I was surprised to receive a letter in reply from her in just over a week. She thanked me for reaching out to her and said that my letter had been forwarded to her by a college roommate who still lived in the house they’d shared at the time. She said she’d love to take me up on my offer and was coming to Cleveland for the Thanksgiving holiday. Could she possibly, she asked, stop by to pick them up then? She included a cell phone number. I had nothing at all going on for Thanksgiving, so I sent her a text and we quickly agreed upon a time for her visit.\n\n~\n\nRita was scheduled to come by at ten o’clock the morning after Thanksgiving. Overnight, Cleveland had its first snowfall of the season, only a dusting, but I’d made a fire in the wood stove and put on a CD of chamber music at low volume to soften the mood. I wasn’t sure what to expect, and I found myself growing strangely anxious as the time for her arrival approached. I changed sweaters three times, settling on a heavy cardigan in an attempt to make my appearance as welcoming as possible.\n\nThe front doorbell rang at precisely ten o’clock. When I opened it, Rita stepped back revealing an old station wagon parked in my driveway behind her. Though her hair was almost all gray and she stooped a little, I recognized her immediately from the photos: the pleasing, angular features, the thin carriage, the gentle eyes, the same small, sad smile. I asked her in, took her coat, and hung it from a peg on the wall. My entryway opened directly into the living room, and when I turned back around, I saw that she’d already taken a few steps towards the desk and was staring directly at it.\n\n“I gave that to him,” she said softly. “It had been in my grandmother’s attic before she died. No one in my family really cared about having it.”\n\nI felt my eyebrows raise and said, “That so?”\n\nShe turned to me with pursed lips and nodded. “Yes. Winter of 1971.”\n\n“No kidding,” I said and pointed to the desk where I’d already pulled out the chair in anticipation of her arrival; I’d left the lid closed. “Why don’t you go ahead and sit down? The letters are still stacked inside. He’d kept the photos under the blotter, but I’ve arranged them on top of it for you.”\n\nI watched her nod again, swallow, then go over to the desk and rub her hand, almost longingly it seemed to me, across its lid.\n\n“That lifts,” I told her. “It’s not locked.”\n\nShe lowered herself onto the chair, keeping her hand and eyes on the lid. I asked, “How about some tea?”\n\n“All right,” she said. She hadn’t turned around. “That would be nice.”\n\nI went into the kitchen and started the kettle, but didn’t turn it on high; I wanted to give Rita some time alone. I fixed two mugs with tea bags, then stood looking out the kitchen window into the backyard with its thin carpet of fresh now. It covered the mound of earth my ex-wife had used as a garden but that I’d left untouched since she’d left. The hummingbird feeder we’d bought together hung empty from a lower branch of the bare maple tree in the corner; I hadn’t filled that since she’d been gone either. Just outside the window, the windchimes she’d made from sand dollars and fishing line dangled from the eave and tinkled gently on the small, cold breeze.\n\nSeveral minutes passed before the kettle began a soft whistle. I turned down the heat, waited a bit longer, then fixed our tea and brought the mugs into the living room. Rita was turned my way with the stack of envelopes on her lap, but she’d only opened and gotten through a handful of the letters inside. She wiped at the corner of one of her eyes and managed one of her small smiles when I set her mug down next to the blotter; as I did, I could see that the photos had been sorted through.\n\n“Thank you,” she said.\n\nI sat on the edge of the couch across from her and held my mug between my legs. She left hers untouched and looked down at the letters in her lap. A log cracked in the wood stove.\n\n“Well,” I finally said. “Looks like you found things okay.”\n\nShe nodded and sighed.\n\n“So,” I said. “If you don’t mind my asking, what happened with the two of you? Back then, I mean.”\n\nShe blew out a longer breath, looked from the letters to me, and said, “We were in love. Deeply. I actually met him here in Cleveland through your mother while we were in high school together. She and I were close friends at the time, and I used to visit her at their home while he was still living there. Then he was drafted, went off to Vietnam, and we started dating after he returned. We were only together here a short time before he moved to Detroit to work with an Army buddy he’d served with and I started college in Toledo. But we still saw each other almost every weekend.” She paused and looked away. “For a while.”\n\nI waited a moment before saying, “And then?”\n\nShe kept her head turned towards the wood stove and said, “He told me he was drunk one night, slept with the woman who eventually became your aunt, and she got pregnant. Both their families were Catholic, hers devoutly, so he did what he said he had to do: he married her.” She looked back my way and shrugged. “End of story.”\n\nI felt a little shiver thinking back to how my aunt and uncle hardly spoke to each other. I thought, too, about how I’d only learned about my ex-wife’s affair in that short note she’d left for me on the counter. I watched Rita take the mug and set it on her lap on top of the letters, its steam curling upward. She didn’t drink from it.\n\n“Wow,” I said, “and you never saw each other again?”\n\nShe shook her head. “Not after his last visit when he told me…what had happened.”\n\nFor some reason, a memory from when I was hardly more than a toddler invaded my mind of a possum who’d lived for a while under our back deck. It was one of my earliest memories, and my father was still living with us at the time. He wanted to get rid of the possum\n\nand had heard somewhere that it would not cross a line of flour sprinkled around its domain. So that’s what he did. The specific memory I returned to at that moment was of getting up late one night when I heard the possum outside, looking out my bedroom window, watching it in the moonlight nose around the line of flour, hesitate, then crawl away: expectations suddenly and inexplicably dashed. My father left soon thereafter, and I never saw him again.\n\nRita blew out another breath, set her mug down on the woodstove’s brick hearth, and said, “Well, I should get on my way.”\n\nAs I watched her begin shuffling letters back into envelopes in her lap, I thought about things that are irretrievable. She was more than twice my age, so I supposed that she had many more of those than I did, although I couldn’t be sure of that. Like everyone, though, her life had been filled with events – meaningful, joyous, regrettable, mundane – of that, I was certain. I became vaguely aware of the chamber music changing from one piece to another.\n\nAfter a few moments, I said, “Why don’t you just put those back inside, close the lid, and take the whole desk? I’ll carry it to your car.”\n\nHer eyes widened with a kind of quiet joy. “Really?”\n\nI nodded, set my own mug on the coffee table in front of me, and stood up. She readied the desk while I got her coat. Then I hoisted the desk up against my chest like I had bringing it\n\nin, followed her out to her station wagon, and got it situated it in back. She closed the hatch, and we stood looking at each other. It had begun to snow again lightly.\n\n“What exactly did my uncle do for a living?” I asked her.\n\nShe made a sound that was something between a small chuckle and a snort. “Fenced stolen property. He and his Army pal. Antiques. Mostly jewelry, but other things, too.” She gestured with her chin towards the desk. “He was going to sell that.” I watched her blinking become rapid. “Then he decided not to.”\n\nI said, “I never knew that.”\n\nShe gave a small shrug. “We were all pretty reckless then. Your mom, your uncle, me. Your aunt, I suppose. Lots of young people were in those days.”\n\n“Not sure that’s changed much.”\n\n“Maybe not.” She gave me another of her small smiles. “I still subscribe online to the Cleveland newspaper online and read about your mother’s death. I’m sorry. She was a wonderful girl, a free spirit. So sweet.”\n\n“My mom?”\n\n“Yes. I’m very glad she got her life straightened out.”\n\nI made a small shrug of my own. When she reached out her hand, I took it, and she clasped her other on mine. She nodded once and said, “Thanks so much.”\n\nI watched her car creep down the driveway in the snow and make its careful way up the street, exhaust bouncing off the pavement, until it turned at the next corner. The breeze picked up and the snow began to blow sideways, but I didn’t go back inside for several minutes. When I did, I stood staring at the space where the desk had briefly stood. At that moment, if I could have, I would have called or written to my ex-wife just to ask how’d she’d been, to see how she was doing. Despite the way things had gone, I hoped she was well. But there was no way for\n\nme to contact her; I had no idea where she was or how to reach her. So instead I just stood looking at that empty spot against the wall listening to the quiet music, the wood stove’s hiss, the knock of the wood chimes, and let my thoughts tumble over themselves.\n\nReturn to Journal\n\nWilliam Cass has had over 300 short stories accepted for publication in a variety of literary magazines such as december, Briar Cliff Review, and Zone 3.

Well, the world is small enough to make all of us insiders.\n\nThis is another insider’s perspective.\n\nIran is on the other side of the world. Ukraine, on the other hand, is a little bit closer to us here in Canada, and if anyone here has been transfixed by the war in Ukraine, they will most likely know that Russia uses Iranian drones against Ukraine’s cities. Similarly, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard army has sent thousands of Syrian refugees our way with the part it played in viciously suppressing the uprising against Syria’s dictator.\n\nIf Canadian citizens can’t always count on their safety in China, as we saw with the imprisonment of the two Michaels, Canadians also can’t count on being safe in Iran, where twenty years ago the journalist Zahra Kazemi, a Canadian citizen, was tortured to death in Tehran’s Evin Prison.\n\nThere’s all that to ruminate on at a time like this, and there’s also the simple reality that women’s rights are human rights. A Nobel Peace Prize laureate spoke here in Toronto in September 2023. This was Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian woman.[1] She was a judge in Tehran before the Islamic Republic swept her and other women off the bench. So she resumed her career as a human rights lawyer, and she’s now forced to live in exile. What Shirin Ebadi told her Toronto audience was that democracy in Iran would come in through the gate of women’s rights.\n\nWe can no longer imagine a working democratic government anywhere on earth where one-half of the population are second-class citizens and all leadership positions are reserved by law and custom for men alone. And we can’t imagine a benevolent, humane, or even workable society that marginalizes its women.\n\nPut simply, it has been 44 years since the revolution that led to the Islamic Republic, and a large part of Iran’s population has had enough. We would say that the regime has lost its legitimacy: its aims and ideals no longer ring true for the people, and its systems and methods don’t serve any desirable purpose for them. You can compare this disillusionment and frustration with the level of alienation the populations of Eastern Europe felt towards their own governments before the Berlin Wall fell.\n\nBut a government that has lost its legitimacy can still carry on if it has cold steel in its heart.\n\nOver the years there have been periodic waves of protests in Iran. Many of these were quashed with rivers of blood, sometimes targeting the country’s minorities for special violence. The protestors complained about things like the government raising prices of necessities, or the national election commission falsifying the count in the presidential election. Yet it took one atrocity against a single woman, Mahsa Jina Amini, to spark the revolution (no mere protest) happening now, which is a call for an end to the system, not for its reform.\n\nThe slogan chanted by the demonstrators in Iran and by their supporters outside Iran is now recognized worldwide: Woman, Life, Freedom. It encompasses hopes and ideals for all people everywhere. The poetry anthology we are publicizing and supporting aims to echo the cry “Woman, Life, Freedom,” and to spread it.\n\n***\n\nBänoo Zan and I, the anthology’s editors, invite all poets everywhere who take inspiration from this slogan to contribute poems. We will read the submissions blind—that is, anonymously—to select the best ones to publish.\n\nWe are assembling this anthology to mark a world-historical moment: the first ever feminist revolution. In Iran, poetry is a national treasure; imagine a culture that has six Shakespeares (or more), in terms of the poets’ stature and people’s familiarity with their lines. Amid human societies everywhere, words that are spoken may be forgotten, books of essays may lie unopened on the shelf, but lines of poetry live and speak forever.\n\nBänoo and I are eager to discover new voices. We hope that the international contributors to the anthology will become a virtual community, and that their interest will be transformed into activism. We aim to raise awareness of the women’s revolution in Iran and demonstrate to the world that this cause is alive and will not be put down.\n\nAn Anthem\n\nThe Iranian revolution that began in September 2022 responded to no political manifesto. Instead, it flared up in response to an unforgettable line of people’s poetry: the slogan Zan, Zandeghi, Azadi! This is what the slogan “Woman, Life, Freedom” sounds like in Persian. In Kurdish, the language in which this slogan was first spoken, it goes Jin, Jiyan, Azadî!\n\nWithin days, the revolution also found its anthem. Amidst Persian-language reworkings of the World War II partisan song, “Bella Ciao” (which kept its wildly incongruous Italian refrain), and the 1970s’ insurgent chant, “El Pueblo Unido Jamás Será Vencido,” a string of found poetry began to sound out in Iran, artfully arranged and set to music by singer-songwriter Shervin Hajipour. The people in the streets quickly taught themselves to sing this winding melody, which begins as a murmur but gathers force until a last intake of breath pushes out the words Azadi! Azadi! (Freedom!).\n\nHajipour assembled the words to this song, which he called “Baraye,” from people’s tweets. Some of these were political slogans, some were complaints, some were sweet dreams: “For a dance in the alley . . . For the dreams of the dumpster kids . . . For the jailed beautiful minds . . . For the tranquilizers and insomnia.” The title, “Baraye,” means “for the sake of.” The song is said to have gained 40 million views in 48 hours, and it earned Hajipour six days in prison with the promise of more to come.[2] In February 2023 “Baraye” also earned the first ever Grammy awarded for the best song for social change.\n\nBänoo and I are looking for poems that themselves somehow join in the struggle for social and political change being waged by the women of Iran, not unlike Servin Hajipour’s creation. We hope that these will be voices that call back and forth across uneasy borders to proclaim transnational solidarity.\n\nThe Role of Poetry in Iran\n\nThe link between poetry and struggle is nothing new in Iran.\n\nHere is the English title of a political poem that was put to music early in the 20th century: “Tulips Bloom from Youths’ Blood.” Aref Qazvini (1882–1934) composed it to salvage shreds of hope from the wreckage of Iran’s Constitutional Revolution, a series of events extending from 1905 to 1911. The poem’s stanzas are a litany of desolate landscapes and desolate souls, including the poet’s own.\n\nThe following are lines taken from Bänoo Zan’s translation from the Persian[3]:\n\nTulips have bloomed from the blood of the youths of our land\n\nLamenting those cypresses, Cypress can no longer stand\n\nA mourning nightingale creeps under Rose’s shadow\n\nAnd Rose, like me, has torn her robe in sorrow\n\nAnd the refrain:\n\nHow vicious are you, Heaven!\n\nYou’re headed to vengeance, O Heaven!\n\nYou have no faith\n\nYou have no creed—no creed\n\nO Heaven!\n\nBut note the image that Qazvini leaves us with: “the tulips are in bloom.”\n\nOn a late September day in 2023, on the one-year anniversary of Mahsa Jina Amini’s murder, hundreds of marchers assembled in downtown Toronto, carrying posters with the photos of dead Iranian protestors against a white background. Red droplets showed against the white, and as they fell, these drops of blood sprang up as stylized red tulips in the lower register of the poster. The words of Qazvini’s poem have arced over more than a century and returned in 2023 as a visual on a series of protest posters.\n\nThe chants and slogans called out on the streets and in the squares of Iran and across the globe are themselves a kind of poetry of the masses. In the heat of the struggle, they motivate activists, transmit information, proclaim solidarity—and construct solidarity where it used to be hard to find. We can call these chants an artistic performance of revolt.\n\nLet’s reflect on this. The subtitle of this anthology is “Poems for the Iranian Revolution.” We need to ask ourselves what we mean by “poems for a revolution.”\n\nWe sent out our call hoping to bring in poems that spring out of the present moment. We expect to find denunciations of injustice, laments for the fallen, and bitter curses. We expect prayers, examinations of a poet’s own conscience, celebrations of life, lyrical musings, autobiographical fragments, and visions of a better future.\n\nWe want this collection to uncover the dimensions of the Iranian revolution and the meaning it has for the people of Iran, and the whole world. We want this to be a book in the shape of a revolution.\n\nBut what does a book of poems do “for” a revolution? Does it stand up and participate? Does it mark the occasion? Bear witness? Lend a hand? The answer is that its best, an anthology like this brings together a community of creators and readers whose support for the revolution goes beyond the borders of Iran. To reiterate, this is the world’s first feminist revolution, and it’s a beacon for the human race. Perhaps one of the poems we select will speak to people reading it a hundred years from now.\n\n***\n\nLet us remember that we are fortunate in that we can publish these poems and speak them freely here where we are assembling this anthology. There are lands and languages in which the poems would be suppressed and the poets punished. By publishing these poems in English, regardless of where or in whichever language they were composed, we intend them to reach an international audience and encourage activists around the world.\n\nNo one questions the power of the word. Dictators and oppressors of all kinds fear and despise it.\n\nWe want the selections in this anthology to be poems that trouble oppressors. We are looking for poems that breathe freely and speak their mind without fear.\n\nCall for Assistance\n\nGuernica Editions has agreed to publish this anthology. They have accepted to open submissions to the international community of poets. However, this international focus means that Guernica expects to lose the opportunity to receive government credits and Canadian content cultural grants for this title; it’s the kind of financial support that Canada’s small independent publishers depend on. Beyond printing and promotion, the costs of publishing this book would fall on Bänoo and me as co-editors. We would have to cover costs from the calligraphy to be incorporated into the cover art, the honorariums to contributors, and even the postage to mail them their copies.\n\nThat is why we have opened a GoFundMe account, which you can reach through Guernica Editions’ submissions web page, as well as directly here: Fundraiser for Cy Strom by Bänoo Zan: Woman Life Freedom Anthology (gofundme.com). We thank all our volunteers and participants.\n\n***\n\nAt the first couple of marches we attended in Edmonton last year, where Bänoo was the University of Alberta’s Writer-in-Residence, the crowd wasn’t yet used to the call-and-response chanting of the typical protest rally. The responses, and even the calls, were pretty ragged, whether in Persian or in English. Finally, one of the rally organizers came out with a simple chant—just three words. One word, actually, repeated in rhythmic triplets. The organizer stamped his right foot in the dirt as he led this chant. It’s the Persian word for “freedom,” repeated three times. It goes like this: Azadi Azadi Azadi …\n\n__________\n\nLink to submissions and GoFundMe campaign: Submissions – Guernica Editions\n\nWhat kind of poems are we looking for? https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-kind-poems-we-looking-b%C3%A4noo-zan\n\nArticle in Asymptote journal (January 4, 2024): https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2024/01/04/poetry-and-resistance-in-iran/#more-33317\n\nShab-e She’r Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/ShabeSherTO\n\nLink to the series of protest posters discussed in the talk: https://linktr.ee/diasporairan\n\nNOTES\n\n[1]In October 2023, Narges Mohammadi, another Iranian woman, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

He holds MA and MPhil degrees from Columbia University in early modern European history and has published in academic and other areas, including a chapter in the dazzling art monograph Oscar Cahén. He edits in different genres and sometimes languages, and has had a role in developing professional editorial standards and educational materials. A draughtsman and painter, for years he ran a drop-in session at an art studio. Cy and Iranian-born poet Bänoo Zan are co-editors of the forthcoming poetry anthology Woman, Life, Freedom: Poems for the Iranian Revolution (Guernica Editions, Canada).\n\nFor this issue, I am delighted to be interviewing Lisa Pasold, a peripatetic powerhouse of a writer who defies definition!\n\nLisa, you are a very well travelled writer and I know you are based in both Paris and New Orleans as well as having grown up in Canada. So firstly, how did you become a writer? Did you know from early on that that’s what you wanted to do and did where you were living at the time feed into/influence your writing? What drew you to Paris? Was it the city’s rich associations with literature, language and culture or something else…?\n\nI knew I wanted to be a writer from the time that I could read. The first book I read for myself was Dr Seuss’ Hop on Pop, a poetry classic of sorts. Growing up in Montréal, I heard many languages—two official ones, French & English, but also a great cosmopolitan range of other languages including Kanyen’kéha (Mohawk) the main Indigenous language of the area. My parents accumulated books in every room of the house, from Shakespeare to Sci-Fi paperbacks to multi-volume academic histories of Peru. Plus, while I was a kid, my mother was studying to get her Masters degree in Canadian Literature—a radical move in the 1970s, since Canadians traditionally studied “classics”, aka European writers. So, from the moment I understood books were a thing, I also understood that literature was alive, especially as I went with my parents to all kinds of readings—formal university author talks, bookstore launches, and wild hippy performance events. I started writing “officially” when I was six, making chapbooks out of left-over fabric and paper bags—my mum was very into recycle/reuse before it was cool, so there were always craft materials available. As for Paris, that was more of a chance encounter: my father is originally Czech, and when I was twenty, I wanted to rediscover my European roots; since I don’t speak Czech or German, I ended up in Paris for purely practical reasons—I can speak French. But then, I fell in love with the city.\n\nThat’s fascinating – to have been surrounded by such a rich mix of language from such a young age must have been so nourishing… Now, I know that you love research, and that you love libraries! Which is your favourite library and why? How do these scholarly places affect your writing?\n\nOh, what a question! My mother worked in libraries, so they’re my home habitat. I love browsing in libraries—the way one book happens to be above another can lead to perfect juxtapositions and unexpected ideas. When I’m in Canada, my favourite library is the Toronto Reference Library, which is a big 1970s Sci-Fi fantasy of a building created by Canadian architect Raymond Junichi Moriyama—lots of natural light, the largest public reference library in Canada, and writing there is like going to work in a space station. I love it! In Paris, it’s the opposite vibe: I love to write in the Saint Geneviève library, named for a 5th century nun, one of the patron saints of Paris. At a time when most Parisians were worshipping a mélange of Christianity, Celtic river god and Roman household gods, Geneviève convinced the brand new leader of France—a violent 20-year-old Frank named Clovis—to become Christian. The Franks came from West Germany and claimed to be descended from a sea god. But Geneviève argued for the political advantages of Christianity, and at her death, Clovis and his wife founded an abbey in Geneviève’s honour. Manuscripts were copied, books collected, and the Ste-Geneviève librarians worked steadily through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Age of Enlightenment. The library survived the Revolution and in 1807, the books were moved to this purpose-built hall with beautiful light and cosy radiators near the work tables. That’s where I wrote all last winter. I am not religious but I do think there is something miraculous about the survival of this library.\n\nLisa, I know you write in a range of genres, and I’m interested that your poetry volumes are called “poetic narratives” – could you maybe talk a little about this choice and how the contents reflect this?\n\nI tend to write book-length poems, and the work is a cumulative narrative. Definitely poetry, not fiction, not memoir, but often my long line and long form sits uncomfortably if readers are expecting a book of individual poems. This way, readers know what they’re getting.\n\nAh, that makes perfect sense, thank you! In your bio you say that in the course of research, you have been “thrown off a train in Belarus, eaten the world’s best pigeon pie in Marrakech, and been cheated in the Venetian gambling halls of Ca’Vendramin Calergi.” This sounds deliciously exciting! Tell us more!\n\nI worked as a travel writer for a while, which gave me the opportunity for great adventures, including a series of articles about casinos. One of those casinos is a stupendous former mansion on the Grand Canal in Venice—and while my husband and I were playing roulette (for tiny stakes) my number won. Before I could rake in my winnings, a slick stranger in an expensive suit grabbed my chips. And that was spotted by the pit boss, which led to a really tense half hour. So far as I know, no one was murdered, but buy me a Bellini sometime and I’ll tell you the whole story. I also briefly counted money in the back of a casino; no surprise, the dealers were fascinating characters. They inspired me to write a novel set in the 1940s about a woman card player, Rats of Las Vegas.\n\nYou are a journalist, lecturer and a podcaster on top of your novel and poetry writing. It sounds as if you are one of those rare and very eclectic beings for whom writing and research is a full-time career. I also know you are a great walker and have a podcast series called “Improbable Walks”. What is it about being a flaneuse that you find so appealing?\n\nI’m very lucky to do what I love! To be fair, I’ve also written real estate fluff, ad copy, and edited annual reports, alongside the more glamourous gigs. Through it all, I’ve been able to explore my deep love of history. There’s so much we can learn from the past as we go forward in the now. I’ve always loved walking with people, especially in Paris, because history is easy to see—under our feet, in the buildings, in the layout of the city. We can feel the stories, and that’s the core of writing, really, to feel present in the story—whether you’re writing a poem, an article, or a novel. What’s more, walking has always been the best way to sort out my ideas, the best kind of mental therapy—I think better when I’m walking, wherever I am.\n\nLouisa May Alcott wrote something along the lines of: “A stormy day withindoors, so I went out.” I can’t find the citation right now (ah, the internet—so much information and not what I need.) But for years, I kept this quote over my writing desk. My worst storms have always been indoors, by which I mean, in the tightly-claustrophobic space of my mind. Perhaps Alcott meant actual arguments between family members, but she’d also have understood the unrestful mind: Alcott wrote her way out of poverty, published thrillingly lurid gothic bodice rippers (yes, as well as her bestseller Little Women), nursed Civil War soldiers, suffered through mercury poisoning and its attendant hallucinations, and used to answer the door pretending to be the maid, in order to get rid of autograph-seekers. My life is much more mundane! But sometimes a person just needs to go for a walk. And that act—especially as a woman—is a political and cultural act, because each walker claims space in the public world, as Rebecca Solnit has examined in Wanderlust: A History of Walking. For instance, I’ve spent years walking in New Orleans, but I only take long solo walks in daylight. And in the Canadian North, I don’t walk more than an hour alone, because if I take myself further away from other people, I don’t have the outdoor skills to manage whatever problem could arise (a turned ankle, frostbite, wildlife.) So walking in Paris has a special place in my heart, because I’ve spent years working through ideas and problems, studying the history of the city as it is laid out under our feet. Walking the glorious spiral that is the design of the City of Light.\n\nYou are the host and co-writer of Discovery World’s TV Travel Show “Paris Next Stop” and, having seen you perform your work in Paris, I know how engaging you are as a speaker and presenter. How did this confidence and ability to beguile an audience come about, were you always a “performer” or did you start from shyer origins?! Any tips for those of us still finding our feet?!\n\nAt a party, I am the shy person awkwardly lurking in the kitchen, mispronouncing my own name because I’m nervous. But being a journalist was like a superpower: people actually had to answer my questions, and I had a purpose, a job to do! So that gave me the confidence I can now draw on, when on-camera or on stage. Of course, it helps that as I get older, I care less and less about looking silly.\n\nThat’s so true! One of the upsides of ageing! And so, finally, Is there anything you haven’t done as a writer that you are burning to do?\n\nThere are so many places to walk, people to walk with, and stories to read! I’d like to write more, collaborate more, and get more stories out into the world. Time! Time is really the problem!\n\nThank you Lisa, I could talk with you all day! And next time we meet, the Bellinis are definitely on me!\n\nReturn to Journal\n\nLisa Pasold is a writer originally from Montréal. Her 2012 book of poetry, Any Bright Horse was shortlisted for Canada’s Governor General’s Award. Her first poetry collection, Weave, was called “a masterpiece” by Geist Magazine; her second, A Bad Year for Journalists was nominated for an Alberta Book Award and turned into a theatre piece premiering in Toronto. Her poems have appeared in magazines such as Fence and New American Writing. The Winnipeg Free Press called her 2009 historical literary novel, Rats of Las Vegas, “as glittering as the Las Vegas strip.” Her most recent poetry book, The Riparian, is an exploration of a river ghost story. “Pasold strikes a meticulous balance between the hideous and the sublime, a song with a love story and thirty tragedies, overheard on a piano ‘dismantled, marooned, With the river washing through its exposed strings,” says John Wall Barger. To develop her book-length works, Lisa has been writing daily poems as the touchstone of her creative process for nearly two decades. As a journalist, Lisa’s feature writing has appeared in diverse publications including The Chicago Tribune and Billboard.

Those long hours of dark can become a contagion of cozy once the burden of indoor chores is shoved aside. Skiers and skaters need not apply, while domestic pets are required to sleep by one’s slippers.\n\nNow that that is taken care of let’s plunge into the snake pit of Dirty Money, where moral compasses always point to cheating, a sobering compendium of financial skullduggery right here in our home and native land. With chapters like “Washing Money In A Canadian Laundromat”, “Taken To The Cleaners: How Canada Can Start To Fix Its Money-Laundering Problem”, “Underground Banking In Canada”, “Canadian Cryptocurrency Conundrums: A Socio-Technical Systems Analysis of Crypto Laundering In Canada” and “Task Specialization in Organized Crime Groups: Money Laundering and the Montreal Mafia”, you can see the breadth of the investigative scope involved. If you found yourself satisfied with the one or two articles and scandal scooping you may have come across in the popular press, then go no further. This worthy collection is aimed at those involved in the field as analysts, investigators and ambitious thesis architects. It belongs on reference shelves where it can be consulted for the deep dive it provides. Make no mistake though, our beloved country is up to its neck in financial irregularities and illegalities, despite the continued efforts of those involved in its discovery, exposure and eradication. If I may go all Zen on you for a moment, both problems and their solutions arise simultaneously out of the void, ready to be activated. Life invites you to cheer for whatever team strikes your fancy, and it has lately come to my attention that purveyors of lies and fraud seem to be doing awfully well in the heroes and villains’ stakes.\n\n*\n\nLeila Slimani, a Moroccan-French writer now taking refuge from both cultures in Lisbon, hit pay dirt some years back with her second book The Perfect Nanny, winning the Prix Goncourt for a literary thriller, a retelling and repositioning of an actual New York murder/suicide. Such an honour can be as much of a burden as a gift to a young writer. She seems to have survived the adulation so far, publishing regularly and travelling widely, and this year issuing two titles, the novel Watch Us Dance and the essay/memoir The Scent of Flowers at Night, (both ably reshaped into English by her regular translator Sam Taylor) where, on invitation, she spent the night at the Punta Della Dogana museum in Venice. That is alone, after closing, on a camp bed with acres of opportunity, all silent and tourist free, to interact with and reflect on the various artworks on display.\n\nShe uses this spot of good fortune to examine both the legends of Venice and her own life. From free thinking, fairly liberal and book-imbibing parents in a hypocritical conservative Islamic culture that kept young women safe from the twentieth century as long as they, like the society around them, conveniently lied about the details of their lives, and thence to the city of every artist’s dreams, where freedom of choice is a given for those who retain the means, unlike those at the bottom of the barrel who scrape and scuffle as their dress, religion and lack of education keep them penned in the service economy for the ever that is better than the wars and repression they left behind.\n\nSlimani is well aware of these contradictions, portraying them with insight and sensitivity in the her award winning novel then exploring them in depth in her collection of encounters and interviews “Sex and Lies”. The memoir seems to step aside from those concerns to explore the esthetics of creation and what by now are the customary existentialist quandaries of those who have shucked the comforts of religion, the challenges of science and the dire warnings of the god fearing to flounder in the philosophical speculations of the god denying.\n\nIn doing so she barges into some fine expositions: “I did not grow up in a harem and no one ever stopped me living my life. But I am the product of that world, and my great-grandmothers were women who believed in the necessity of those boundaries. I never suffered what my ancestors went through, but all the same the idea persisted, even in my childhood, that women were immobile, sedentary beings, that it was safer to keep them inside than let them out. They had less value than men. They inherited less. A woman was always somebody’s wife or daughter.”\n\nThis leads her to quoting Paul Morand’s The Man in a Hurry: “‘Pierre you’ll put on weight, you’re taking root. You’re becoming immobile. Remember some snails are crushed to death by the weight of their own shells’. Because I was a woman, I was always afraid of the shell that would crush me. It seemed to me that existence was nothing other than an attempt to destroy the wildness within us, to rein us in, to control our instincts. In all my novels the mothers felt the desire to abandon their children. Each of them is nostalgic for the woman she used to be. They suffer from the compulsion to build a safe and comfortable home for their children, a doll’s house in which they will be the smiling prisoners.”\n\nAnd on to the inevitable and eminently quotable Virginia Woolf: ‘The question of women is a question of space. It is impossible to understand the domination women are subjected to without studying its geography, without evaluating the constraints imposed upon their bodies by clothing, by places, by other eyes.’\n\nOn literary matters she is equally clear eyed: “I often see myself as my characters’ defense lawyer. Like someone who is not there to judge them, to lock them up in boxes, but instead to tell their story. To defend the idea that even monsters, even the guilty, have a story. When I write, I am inhabited by the desire to work for the salvation of my characters, to protect their dignity. Literature, in my eyes, is the presumption of ignorance.\n\n“I have always been more than curious about other people. Have always felt a ferocious hunger to know them. A desire to enter inside them, to walk in their shoes for a minute, an hour, a lifetime. I have never been able to relax in the cold comfort of indifference. The passer-by in the street, the baker who talk too loudly, the little man walking slowly, the nanny daydreaming on the beach, they all move me. When we write, we feel an affection for the weaknesses and faults of others. We understand that we are all alone but that we are all the same.”\n\nWhile Slimani has played her cards smartly in her adopted culture, becoming a government approved cultural spokesperson, she has continued to spread her wings in matters of story and its elegant spinning. This brief but incisive memoir will likely cement her reputation as a voice to be reckoned with in contemporary European literature.\n\n*\n\nSpeaking of paydirt Rawi Hage hit the jackpot with his first novel DeNiro’s Game, which took Ireland’s Impac Dublin award back in 2006, and established him as a novelist to watch as descriptors like ‘masterpiece’ and ‘gorgeous and grandiose’ were tossed about with the kind of gay abandon not employed in his gruesome account of life in Beirut during the apocalyptic madness of civil war. Later titles like Beirut Hellfire Society rather cemented his reputation for damnation on wheels. The short fictions of Stray Dogs display a calmer cast of characters domiciled in a variety of European capitals. They follow their life paths with modicoms of dignity achieved in middle age. Yet most are trailing the memories of the merciless bloody rivalries of their youth, drawing them remorselessly back to the scenes of moral depravity in the half-repaired towns and mountainous villages of Lebanon, now bulging with refugees from their former oppressor Syria. Rather than existential anguish of those caught in the crossfire and endless bombing we now see the brooding despair of minds and hearts permanently scarred. Some of the narratives take their cues from legend, myth and folktale, where the inevitability of outcome is calmly accepted without the boiling over of rage and lust for vengeance. These fictions find their home in the tradition of the tale, where the reader cannot escape the notion that they are being comforted in the genteel defeat of resignation. There there now, such is life.\n\n*\n\nChristina Estima’s Syrian Ladies Benevolent Society follows the paths of an Arab family fleeing the Middle East for Montreal in the 19th century and coping with the overpowering cultural shifts as tradition clashes with modernity in the 20th Century. The post-modern West is a playground of freedoms in which almost anything goes, as long as you can stand being surveyed and tut-tutted by the thought police, camouflaged as clowns. Migrants and refugees usually arrive breathless from territories where surveillance is the first step in violent repression, so their lack of adaptive abilities is appreciated. Shifty citizens can be such a bother.\n\nThis is her first book of short stories, but her extended journeys through the worlds of theatre and journalism deliver her safely beyond that threshold of newbiedom that all writers wish to hurry on by. Drawing on her mixed ethnicity of Lebanese, Syrian and Portuguese cultures she fashions a narrator whose struggles and confusions are at once nuanced and predictable. Young women from conservative societies shaped by centuries of tradition and customised repression look for any chance to rebel and redraw boundaries as far from the personal as possible, and Estima’s protagonist takes every opportunity to puncture any pretension or falsity with outrageous and scandalous behaviour. I was alternately amused and appalled. Throwing herself at white boys is one thing, but deliberately dripping menstrual effusions on the floors of fashionable shops seems a bridge too far to me, but I can easily see legions of young women raising their rebel yell fists in some righteous Instagram chorus. Declaring that’s she “feels her ancestors in her blood”, despite its trendy insinuations, does not absolve her from the inanity of her transgressions.\n\nThere are times in a reader’s life when one realises one is not in the projected demographic of the creator’s intentions. One is expected, perhaps even required, to cheer on from the sidelines. In this case I feel polite applause is the appropriate response. Estima is a writer of prodigious gifts, of that there is no doubt, but she has yet to resist the temptation to show off her talents every other metaphor.\n\nYoung virtuosos in any field of expression need to temper their enthusiasm for fireworks and see that the quietism of the candle can illuminate just as effectively. That trip to terminal boredom when all juiced up with jangly bracelets and quilts of tattoos can seem more attractive as age assumes its directorship.\n\n*\n\nThere’s plenty of fireworks, intellectual, esthetic and humorous in Imagining Imagining, Gary Barwin’s latest assault on the bastions of the traditional and conventional. Not a page goes by without several reminders that language is there to be played with, ideas to be turned inside out, assumptions to be revoked and reordered, and narratives to be nuanced and then knocked sideways before the reader can retain her balance. Barwin is too far gone into the mayhem of many viewpoints and colliding perspectives to be lectured and tsk-tsked by the likes of me. The virtuosity on display trumps any claim to a critical stance. Other than, perhaps, the carnival ride where keeping one’s seat and hanging on to one’s hat for the sake of decorum becomes less and less desirable as the giddiness induced by the dance as it dissolves all boundaries between reader and read, author and audience, imagination and negation.\n\nFortunately, the work is divided into twenty-three sections that only briefly shoulder the burdens conveyed by the definition chapters. One can actually ease out of the frenetic flow, close the book and disabuse oneself of the notion that the reader engages with the text. One actually engages only with one’s desire to engage, as the almost constant white water rafting over the enigmas of ideas and language propels you beyond. Beyond the beyond.\n\nPerhaps you think I jest: “Before we talk about everything else, lets stay a while longer with uncertainties, mysteries and doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason, as John Keats says, Negative capability. It’s what my gym teacher always said I had.” That’s from Writing as Rhizome: Connecting Poetry and Fiction with Everything. “Cell walls? I’m against them. Also divisions between things. Between physical objects. Between people. The separations between things are, in some ways, working fictions. Yes, there are different ‘zones’, but I have this notion of everything being part of this huge protoplasmic unity. From galaxies to the inside of dogs and the underside of sweat socks. Air our lungs, birds. Ash. Fire. Turnips. Do we really need cell walls?”\n\nLater, in the same essay, On Between: “The same is true of concepts and abstractions. One person’s manbun is another’s mantra. Is it true that someone’s pain is my pain and it is only the self and society which creates reasons to keep them at a distance? I want my thinking and feeling to reflect the fundamental unipanrhizomatubiquity between/of things.” Employing words to approach and embrace the unitary consciousness, the self as other and all as One: hey I’m all for that. Nice work if you can get it, and not always within reach as our pockets bulge with tissues, reminders, duties and appointments.\n\nFor those who easily tire of such semantic semaphore signalling there is always Elegy for a Poodle, a heartrending recitation of the sad details surrounding the death and burial of family pets. Or The Archive of Theseus, a rumination on personal libraries and their domestic scatterings, several pages that I easily inserted my book-loving self into, making a resting place in the Dylan Thomas quote: To read “indiscriminately and all the time with my eyes hanging out”. And for those who appreciate the solitary stroll, talking to the wind while the moon nods serenely, there is The Selected Walks.\n\nIn all these daring escapades in essaydom the author allows, indeed encourages, the mind, his mind your mind our mind and for god’s sake do not mind the gap, to meander, exploring that alley, sniffing that flower, removing that rubbish indiscriminately thrown, seeking out the “poorer corners where the ragged people go” or finding that “one man’s ceiling is another man’s floor”. Such freeing of language’s detainees can be as liberating to the reader as it is to the creator. All that’s required is grabbing hold of the string as the kite flies away.\n\n*\n\nOf course, the game of language and ideas is not the only game in town. In We Could Have Been Friends, My Father and I, Raja Shehadeh plays the memoir game, a favored genre in this column. He situates the fluctuations in the evolving relationship with his father within the larger context of Palestine’s passage through the turbulence of the twentieth century. Sure it’s been a rough ride, no surprize there. Saeed Teebi calls it “the defining tragedy of the twentieth century” and Rashid Khalidi insists on “the unrelenting resistance to the British perfidy, Hashemite tyranny and Israeli colonization that have tormented the Palestinians since 1917.” While there is merit in such accusations, it is altogether too easy to focus on local real estate rivalries and ethnic squabbles while ignoring the rest of this tormented century with its relentless decimation of conscripted armies and hapless civilians to further the insanity of ideology and imperialism. I imagine the Armenians, Irish, Kurds, Basques, and the ‘former Yugoslavians’ would have much to contribute on this. Every nation has something to answer for and the many truth and reconciliation commissions only go part of the way, the easy part.\n\nWell, what about the book, you say. It performs its narrative and geopolitical functions with a precise and unerring detailing of the aforementioned perfidy that others might consider constructive and unavoidable. And yes, there’s always the other side of the equation, and in the Middle East there is often several other sides. And yes, Europe is not immune from such: the crazy quilt of alliances that sucked everyone into the catastrophe of World War One might suffice as the glaring example.\n\nRaja Shehadeh, an activist himself, speaks warmly and sensitively of his father and uncle particularly, both of whom were judges during the formative post-war years of the Palestinian carve up, mainly between Israel and Jordan once the British fled the dead end of the Mandate, circa ‘46-8, and did their best as community leaders to hold the line against what now seems like an extended denial of statehood and forced assimilation. Comparisons to the once trampled-on Kurds are not out of place and demonstrate the possibility of the seemingly impossible.\n\nIf a background to the current hostilities in and around Gaza is required by any reader willing to be immersed in the ethnic rivalries and hatreds of what was once called the Levant and go beyond the propaganda of all sides, this is a good a place as any to start.\n\n*\n\nNot to be too trendy or provocative, although it will likely seem like it, Like Figs in Autumn provides a challenging and intriguing balance to the familial and cultural concerns presented by Raja Shehadeh above. A memoir by a Jewish American man who reacts to a personal tragedy by emigrating to Israel and signing up for the I.D.F., an acronym that resonates loudly these days. But this was around 2010, this “one year in a forever war”. Both books fell into my path around the same time and I couldn’t help but see the hand of fate stirring my simmering pot.\n\nSo you are about to graduate from an Ivy League school with a degree in moral philosophy, a supportive family and wide circle of friends when a best buddy is killed by a drunken driver on a late night walk home. Tumbling through the turmoil of grief and resentment, you come to the conclusion that jumping ship from Rhode Island and emigrating to Israel with the express purpose of joining the IDF to serve your adopted homeland despite never having held a firearm in your life, is an ideal escape hatch to your dilemma. Maybe the Mahal, the “special set of volunteering non-Israeli Jews” will make a fit. Parents remind you that yes, it’s your choice and life son, but don’t let your grief do the talking. Friends are taken aback but hold off from laughing in your face. Older friends return at graduation to report on promising careers in business, banking and academia. But no, you want to go to a war zone and fight for what is right and maybe right yourself in the process. Sounds like a plan, huh? Maybe he missed all that Vietnam and Iraq era ‘no blood for oil’ and ‘what if they gave a war and nobody came’ stuff. The decades and their imperatives have a habit of disappearing in the relentless rush of headlines and outrages. Ironically, he winds up with a decommissioned M-16, Vietnamese sand grains etched into the barrel, but that’s just for training.\n\nSigning up, boot camp, practicing your rusty Hebrew in the midst of all the bluster and bravado male bonding insists on. “Idiots together, our Hebrew was a primitive code, a syntactically bankrupt set of short words and phrases”. Finding that the myth of the friendly welcoming kibbutz is much more and actually a familial reality. Guarding checkpoints with the approved suspicions, waiting for sudden eruptions, boredom punctuated by panic. Travelling in a, well let’s be kind, compact troop carrier through narrow winding streets, seemingly as old as history itself, watching, always watching.\n\nBen was five when Baruch Goldstein committed his now infamous massacre of Muslims at prayer, gathered for worship in the Hall of Issac, where, before being beaten to death by a fire extinguisher, managed to kill 29 and wound 125. He thinks of it as his own on rifle jammed on shooting practice decades later. When his much-admired colleague Shai, his squad’s ever so cool “squared jawed playboy” expresses the thought “I admire his devotion but not his act”, Ben imagines “a cool kid from home saying of a Klan lynching that he admired the devotion just not the act”. Maybe he might also “admire the devotion of an Intafada suicide bomber, if not the act”. Ben felt the distinction was impossible, that” admiring the devotion aloud meant admiring the act in quiet” and this was “serving only to conceal him from his own hatred” and “permit it to poison him from the hiding place he had constructed for it”. But he had not the “Hebrew to say it with grace, and I did not merely want his friendship, I needed it”. Of course, he was not “in uniform to play the peacemaker”, so he held his own peace, “even though Baruch would not soon give me his”.\n\nIn his own final year, before his own assassination, by extremist or patsy depending on who you read, Yigal Amir, then PM Yitzhak Rabin pronounced Baruch “an arrant weed” and “Sensible Judaism spits you out”.\n\nNothing is the final word in such murderous rivalries, whipped up again and again by the lust for righteous vengeance, and Bastomski resists the temptation to shriek or spew slogans. On his return, when his acceptance from Harvard Law School comes through and his future opens up, he realises he had decided to “Join the army after Avi died because it gave me something new to be about” and although he “could not go back through the yellow gate into Be’eri or back to Kisufim, even though he” still did in his dreams” and that now he “would take a step forward toward leaving things behind.” That step forward played out as law school graduation and employment at a prestigious law firm, with, believe it or not, a little male modeling on the side. This astutely observant and finely rendered memoir, quite the triumph for a first book, proudly contributes to the ranks of the coming-of-age tale.\n\n*\n\nTravel memoirs can provide a welcome escape to exotic locales and the wild high-wire adventuring necessary to their attainment. For us all-too-sober stay-at-homers they can certainly lend more than a dash of spicy threat to our comfortably predictable days. Maria Coffey’s newest slice of daring exploits, Instead, Navigating the Adventures of a Childfree Life, is as rambunctiously enjoyable as any in the genre of reckless adventuring that I have come across in my cozy bookfest life.\n\nSpringing herself free from a middle class suburban English existence into the company of hard drinking hiking and hill climbers, most of whom are revving up the money and guts necessary for mountain ascents in distant locales, she sets herself up for the trauma of a beloved boyfriend’s death on Everest, following on from her own near drowning in a rip tide, which, not surprisingly, sets her up for the long road to recovery and reassertion of inner strength. A young woman of her times she watches with growing discomfort the marriage and baby announcements of friends, all of whom, in the first flush of nesting, want the same joy for her, despite her inner urge to run a mile in the opposite direction. About 10,000 miles and a ‘nanny visa’ later she winds up in British Columbia, taking the Island ferry in five days a week for her mainland duties, caring for three children who hate all the previous nannies and the strict vegan diet their travelling father insists on. The irony of this choice, squirting out from under her Catholic mother’s guilt-tripping as well as her coterie of bun-in-the-oven pals, does not escape her.\n\nIndeed, her excoriating self-examination, parsed from contemporary notebooks forty years on, is to be praised. She makes no excuses for her determination to remain childless, which seems challenged at every turn; initially by her starter family friends and later by many native women in the third world cultures on that kayak-around-the-world vacation that is the meat of this many layered narratives. Women from Malawi, the Solomon Islands, India and Vietnam, all express sadness at her childless state, some even offering one or two from their copious broods. Husband Dag is regularly pitied for having married an older and barren wife. Ah, the oppressions of cultural expectations! One recalls that Dylan line, “Well I try my best to be just like I am, but everybody wants you to be just like them”.\n\nCoffey has made a life out of snubbing expectations, both familial and cultural, a daring exploratory life, sometimes following and sometimes leading husband Dag, a fearless explorer in his own right, that most would only fantasize about while camping fifty miles from home and taking advantage of the site’s washroom and shower facilities. Let’s face it sharing hotdogs with strangers can be an adventure in itself.\n\nOn this, perhaps her tenth book, Coffey has polished her evocations of nature, – landscape, seascape, the heavens at night, – to a fine sheen, a sheen the reader can glide on while sucking in the sensuous and enticing details of coral, rock, tropical fish, div"
