        "text": "Brian McFadden joined Westlife with Nicky Byrne alongside Kian Egan, Mark Feehily and Shane Filan after auditioning in 1998.\n\nMcFadden was one of the five young men assembled by then A&R executive Simon Cowell in 1998 to form the boy band Westlife\n\nThey had four number one albums in Ireland while he was there, and ten number one singles including 'Uptown Girl' and 'Flying Without Wings'.\n\nREAD NEXT: Westlife star Mark Feehily to perform in West End show after star-studded Wembley gig\n\nBrian, 42, quit Westlife in 2004, just months before his marriage to Kerry Katona ended.\n\nAfter he left Westlife, he explained he wanted to spend more time with Atomic Kitten star Kerry and their two daughters Molly and Lily.\n\nAfter his split with Kerry Katona he launched his solo career.\n\nHe signed to Sony BMG records and released his debut number one solo single 'Real to Me' in 2004.\n\nThat year he released his debut solo album 'Irish Son'.\n\nHe then moved on with Australian singer Delta Goodrem and moved to Australia.\n\nIt comes as Brian previously said he departed the band just as they were asked to record hit song ‘Mandy’, and that he was ashamed of the song.\n\nHe told the Irish Independent: \"That was definitely a turning point. I've always been very proud of Westlife, and I still think that we never got the respect we deserved, but I was f**king ashamed of that song. From the second we went into the studio to record it, I lost all interest.\"\n\nBrian’s solo career was short-lived and he left Song BMG in 2007 after disagreements about his songwriting following some disappointing record sales.\n\nHe instead set up his own label, BMF Records, before releasing single 'Like Only a Woman Can' which became another Irish number one.\n\nBrian McFadden became a co-host of FOX8's 'Football Superstar' in Australia in 2008.\n\nThe following year he was a guest judge on 'Australian Idol'. In 2010, he joined the judging panel on 'Australia's Got Talent' with Kyle Sandilands and Dannii Minogue.\n\nHe released a new single 'Wrap My Arms' in 2012 and later his fourth studio album, 'The Irish Connection' which featured duets with Ronan Keating and Sinéad O'Connor.\n\nSpeaking to the Sun, Brian expressed how himself and Westlife were offered the chance to reunite the five of them through a potential multi million deal..\n\nBrian said: \"I was offered a big multi-million-pound deal. It was the other boys in Westlife who said 'no'. They didn't want me back,\" he told the Irish Sun.\n\n\"How does that make me feel? It makes me pretty upset because I didn't realise they still had those feelings towards me.\"\n\nOver the years, it’s evident that Brian has made it known he would like to get back in with the band, but Nicky said no.\n\nIn an interview with The Mirror, band member Nicky Byrne answered the question, and said: \"The honest answer would be that we wouldn't have him back in the group anyway.\n\n\"We all get on great with Brian but we couldn't go back to having five in the group because it was such an upheaval when he left.\n\n\"We had to rebuild and start from scratch and we're a different group now. We've moved on and Brian knows that as much as we do.\n\n\"If you are asking me if we would let him rejoin the group then the answer is no.\"\n\nBrian is currently one half of duo, ‘Boyslife’, which he fronts with Boyzone member Keith Duffy.\n\nOn 19 January 2022, the duo announced the release of their second studio album, Old School.\n\nHis personal life has been less than smooth sailing, with two marriages and a 7 year relationship with ex Delta Goodrem.\n\nBrian McFadden married singer Kerry Katona in 2002 with whom he has two daughters; Molly Marie and Lilly-Sue.\n\nThey were divorced in 2006.\n\nIn 2004, he started dating Delta Goodrem and got engaged in 2007.\n\nHowever, in 2011, they announced their separation.\n\nHe married Irish model Vogue Williams in 2012 in Florence, Italy. They separated in 2015] and divorced in 2017.\n\nBrian is currently engaged to PE teacher Danielle Parkinson who he met through mutual friends.\n\nThe pair welcomed her first child Ruby Jean in May 2021, and live in Rochdale, Manchester in his first home.\n\nSpeaking to OK!, Brian gushed about baby Ruby saying: “She’s brilliant. She’s sleeping right through, waking up after me!”\n\nHe also hinted he will struggle to leave Ruby behind when he hits the road with Keith later this year.\n\nRead next:"
