        "text": "Horticultural Expert and Irrigation\n\nJune 2014\n\nIn the two or three years since a major renovation of our Berkeley garden, a few large old plants have died and some of the newer planting hasn't worked out. We're looking for someone who knows plants well and works in varied styles to help us choose some new trees and other plants and integrate them into our garden. It would be a bonus if this person can help with installation. We are not looking to change the hardscape. Also, we are unhappy with the new irrigation system. Some plants get too little water while others (and the hardscape) get too much. We've made some adjustments, but it's still not good enough. So we're seeking recommendations for a plant-savvy, water-wise irrigation specialist. Thanks! cassis\n\nI highly recommend Martina Ladova of Bohemian Roots Design/Build bohemianroots [at] yahoo.com(510) 717-2236. She completely redesigned my back garden and installed an arbor, irrigation, lots and lots of plants and built planters as well. I get so many compliments now from everyone who comes over. She really has an amazing eye for design. She has a wealth of information on which plants work well locally, and she likes to pick out unusual varieties to make the garden more interesting. She's got several decades of experience in the local area. She also continues to maintain the garden after installation was complete, and is reasonably priced. rain\n\nWe had our backyard redone this spring from fence to flagstones and everything in between. I highly recoomend the people we worked with and their subcontractors: McCaffrey Brothers Construction, Darren and Kevin - website:www.mccaffreybrothers.com Darren #(510) 455-0724 Also, their planting and irrigation guys were Indra Designs-Tony Poeck - www.indradesignsinc.com. We now have a smart system that monitors weather as well as ground moisture. After fine tuning our choices over a few weeks, all the major work was done in 10 days and we are thrilled. For our redwood fencing we got JB Fence Co. to do the job (this was done last fall) and that is all they do - http://www.jbfence.com (510) 339-6371 Sales: Matt Julian . Very good crew. Good luck, happy in my garden oasis. judy\n\nFront lawn needs help!\n\nApril 2014\n\n12 years ago we put sod/grass with a sprinkler system in our small front lawn, and it is now dying. We need recommendations for someone who can tell us what our options are for either fixing it, replacing it, or coming up with an option other than grass. We do not use this area; it exists purely for curb appeal, so we're open to a world of LOW-COST, low-maintenance options, but need professional advice. Thanks!\n\nThere have been so many people looking for landscapers recently... look no farther than Urban Botanics. Check them out on Yelp, Facebook, or their website (just google them) for pictures. You will be amazed! They are professional, reliable, efficient, and on the cheaper end. I used them to completely re-do my backyard and it came out beautifully. This was my first big project as a homeowner, so I was pretty anxious about it and pretty clueless, too, but they handled everything from soup to nuts and stayed within my budget. It was completely hassle-free for me and I am thrilled with the result. They work all over the Bay Area and they are just terrific at what they do. Definitely give them a call (415-734-1030)or shoot them an email. backyard makeover\n\nLandscape contractor for permeable pavers\n\nApril 2014\n\nI'm replacing the old concrete in my driveway with permeable concrete pavers. I'm pretty confident in the installation details but I'd like an installer familiar with this type of system. It seems like most companies that specialize in pavers are used to much larger jobs--this is a tiny area the size of one car, but I could include rebuilding the low concrete planter walls on either side too. Recommendations appreciated, especially if you've had experience yourself with this material. toshi\n\nI highly, highly recommend Jose Zamora of Zamora Landscape. I have worked with him on three projects and my landscape design colleagues use him as their contractor of choice for their designs. He is working on my house at the moment, and it looks amazing. Among many other things, we are putting in pavers in the driveway. He has installed the same pavers but they are permeable on another job- they just have a gap in between for drainage and a permeable base. Both installations are beautiful. Jose is not only a small licensed business owner, but also a Cal grad- so he knows design, he knows plants, and he knows construction. http://www.zamora-landscape.com/ Zamora Landscape Design Lic 971336 PO Box 2756 San Rafael CA 94912 415.419.4075\n\nI think Matt Hornby would be perfect for the job you are doing. He is a garden designer (actually landscape architect)whose specialty is stonework. He has done some great work on my garden - design, pavers, carpentry - and is very reasonable. http://www.matthornbygardendesign.com Rain\n\nLandscaper for Drought Tolerant Design\n\nJan 2014\n\nI live in North Berkeley and am looking for a landscaper/hardscaper to do a total redesign of my small L-shaped backyard. With the drought, I would really prefer not to have to water at all or to water very little. (Cactus Jungle in Berkeley has things I like.) I would like to make use of decomposed granite and concrete pavers and would like to go for a modern look with clean lines with some curved concrete seating structures and some low walls/borders to offset the angular look of the yard. And a place to have a table for dining. I want someone who has a modern flair who could help me execute this. Thank you!\n\nIt is SO dry and windy, I know why you're thinking about this! I would see if you can get Wabi.Co Urban Gardens. This fellow seems particularly 'on' the water thing. He has installed surface drip for our gardens and we run it sparingly. Managing the controllers is a thing he is good about training the owner too. Kathy\n\nI can highly recommend Yard Art, a 2-woman crew of designer/landscaper who have been in the Bay Area for many years and have an impressive set of gardens, both big and small, to their name. They do a lot of low water, native native plant design that looks great. Not to mention they are just the kindest, most generous people you could imagine.\n\nCarol and DJ (mom and daughter!) proposed a total re-do of our once unsightly back yard - a large flat space that was too much for us to consider tearing apart ourselves. They convinced us of removing most of the lawn (which I was happy to abide) and replacing it with smaller, more manageable plantings within a user-friendly design. The outcome was really wonderful. We now have what feels like a comfortable extension to our home that includes thriving, colorful gardens, lower water bills, and a place for us to retreat to when the weather is cooperative. They also come by once a quarter to do very reasonable maintenance and I look forward to seeing them. They are a joy to work with. Couldn't recommend them more highly. water-friendly yard owner\n\nI have worked with Sue Oda, Landscape Architect, and found her to be very easy to work with and very knowledgeable in native and drought-tolerant plants. A recent project I have worked with her on is the 'Sacred Hoop Garden' at Northbrae Community Church in North Berkeley. It is all native plants, and has many of the elements you have in your program (decomposed granite pathway, low retaining walls, curved stone seating.) Howard\n\nCheck out www.bay area stone gardens.com. Bill is very well versed in creating a welcoming outdoor hardscape space that reduces water usage. Stacy\n\nI recommend Claudio Rohrsetzer. He is an expert in California Natives and drought tolerant plants an also knows a lot about drip irrigation. If you want more information about his work and background, check his website: http://www.myurbangardener.com Freitas\n\nI highly recommend Carlo Pessano for garden design, especially because you mention contemporary look, decomposed granite, and drought tolerant. He is an artist in the garden. I have used him for years for my own garden and for houses that I am preparing for market. He can be reached 967-4303. heidi\n\nI had a border of some sort of bushes that would die one after another due to my lack of regular watering. Then Sue Oda came over and basically saved the day. Not only did the replacement plants solve the drought tolerant problem but the new plants create a much better division between our property and that of the neighbor. I recommended her to some people up the street who wanted a major project done and they were thrilled with her design. Sue is a landscape architect based in the El Cerrito area. She has a website which is www.SueOda.com and her phone number is 684 8789. symetrick\n\nBackyard potential\n\nNov 2013\n\nGreetings! I need the creative input from our community. My family has a modest sized backyard that has a few smallish but nice trees but is mostly a dirt patch. The space is primarily shaded and refuses to grow grass. I want to make it into something my family will use, as our home is on the smaller side, and this area could provide us another space to enjoy. There is a minor slope to the area and if we level it out, our fence will look funky. Ideas? Recommendations of an inexpensive landscape designer? Grateful neighbor\n\nI have a recommendation for you. I have worked with Heidi Tarver (Berkeley Garden Coach) and I think she would be perfect for the kind of landscaping challenge you describe. My garden is also smallish and somewhat shady. Heidi helped me remove a tired lawn and convert the landscaping to plantings that were site appropriate as well as beautiful and functional. We have been really happy with the results. You can review her services and pricing on her website: berkeleygardencoach.com. She is very affordable, and great to work with. M.B.\n\nPeter Gradjansky will help you work within your budget. He's a great designer and can do the whole job or help you piece it out to do it yourself. His work speaks for his skill and integrety. 524-6919. Good luck. June\n\nIf anyone can convince you that your tiny backyard has much more potential than you see in it, its Brother Perry. We have worked with him to completely overhaul our tiny backyard in a way that requires little maintenance and still looks amazing. We were so impressed with his work that we have recommended him to at least 5 friends where he's done similar overhauls of their yards. Can lay flagstone patios, create decking spaces, put down new sod, landscape, etc. He also does a lot of other home maintenance and repair. He has a website: www.brotherperry.com and his email address is brotherperryhome @ gmail.com. yard happy\n\nWe contacted UC Berkeley's landscape architecture program, since students are always looking for experience. A first year student designed our front and back yards/gardens (planting plans) earlier this year for $300. Now it's just up to us to make it happen! Dean's Office, College of Environmental Design University of California, Berkeley 230 Wurster Hall #1820 Berkeley, CA 94720-1820 (510) 642-0831 Phone laepchair [at] berkeley.edu Kiren\n\nHello, You mentioned that your backyard is too shady to grow a lawn and I thought of our experience with eco-lawn. We found that the shadiest side of the lawn area grew in the lushest and best, much to our surprise. If you are interested in having part of your backyard to be lawn, I'd recommend eco-lawn http://www.eco-lawn.com/ and we got the seed locally in Richmond at Annie's Annuals and Perrenials (we got just one bag and have used only a small amount). It takes much less water than a typical lawn, you don't have to mow it because it is slow growing and you might like the long length of the lawn look (we do). We found that it did take a few seedings to really get a lush lawn, it seemed to be really helpful to get special soil for seeding grass (we got that at OSH), and when you plant the seeds you do have to water it frequently until it starts growing. We really missed having a part of our yard where we could just plop a blanket down on a lawn and read a book and are happy with our new eco-lawn. K\n\nI highly recommend Matt Hornby Garden Design in Berkeley. www.matthornbygardendesign.com He helped turn my small backyard into a little sanctuary and his prices are very reasonable! good luck!\n\nLandscape Designer needed\n\nOct 2013\n\nHi, I'm looking for recommendations for a landscape designer and or a landscaper who can create a design. Thank you! Amy\n\nHi- I'd like to recommend Cecelia Littlepage for your project. She's a design-build garden designer and contractor with a great eye and the ability to put your ideas into a coherent plan. She also has 30 years of experience so knows what she's doing. She helped me figure out how to make a garden out of a big mess of a yard and we love it. cflittlepage [at] earthlink.net, 510-848-4178. Melissa\n\nI recently re-designed my front garden, and I can enthusiastically recommend Heidi Tarver (aka Berkeley Garden Coach) as a terrific designer to work with. She was thoughtful, paid attention to what was important to me, and came up with great solutions for a couple of troubling challenges. She is very reasonably priced as well, which was important to us because we didn't have a huge budget. She doesn't do installation herself, but works with a great team that does - also reasonably priced. We were completely happy with her work, and have recommended her to some of our friends. Her website is www.berkeleygardencoach.com, and all the contact information is there. Good luck with your project. Belinda\n\nI highly recommend Manual Garcia for landscape design and gardening. He is very fast but shows careful attention to detail. He is easy to work with and has over 20 years experience in the field. I have also had several home repair jobs done by him and was very pleased with with his level of expertise and knowledge in this area as well. He mounted track lighting in my apartment in addition to a large curtain divider. His number is 510 652 5612. Felicity\n\nI suggest you contact Heidi Tarver at www.berkeleygardencoach.com. She did a wonderful job creating a design for our North Berkeley garden. We are extremely happy with her work, and the project came in under budget. Dr. D\n\nBackyard Landscape ideas - student or beginner landscaper?\n\nSept 2013\n\nmy backyard needs a facelift! It's an open palate. Does anyone know of a school or beginning landscaper etc who might want to use my backyard as a template or learning/experimental space? Or to give me ideas? It's flat, roughly 30' x 100'\n\nThey now have an online job board where you can post what your needs are. You might want to specify that you want someone who is a couple of years along in the program, then you will get someone who is just starting out and has both inspiration and a bit of practical knowledge. New landscapers build up a business client by client, so they should be quite happy to fix up your yard. I was in the program myself 25 years ago and now know someone currently in the program. They've come a long way in understanding the principals of sustainability and I think you will get a lot of great ideas from them. Liz\n\nWhen I was looking for a student landscape designer, I posted a message on the bulletin board at Merritt Community College Landscape Horticulture School. I think I sent the post by fax or email and they printed it out and put it on the board. Joanie\n\nIf you decide to consult a professional we can recommend Geogia Madden: www.fmlanddesign.com / 510-450-0803\n\nMid-century modern landscaping\n\nJune 2013\n\nWe just moved into our midcentury ranch and the yard is a mess of 'deferred maintenance.' We need a short-term and a long-term landscaping plan from a professional with a modern aesthetic. I love an English garden, I just don't want one, and it won't fit with the house. The plan would include a patio, fence, garden, as well as a long term plan for an outdoor kitchen. mid-century yard\n\nI highly recommend Matt Hornby http://www.matthornbygardendesign.com/Home.html He has excellent design sense and is especially skilled at stonework. R S\n\nGarden designer w/ style similar to Lurie Garden\n\nJune 2013\n\nOn a recent trip to Chicago, I fell in love with the Lurie Garden in Millennium Park. The garden was designed by Piet Oudolf et al. using midwest perennials and lots of grasses for a modern, bold effect. I would like to do something similar in my front yard, but with California plants. Is there a landscape garden designer in the area who could do something for me in that style?\n\nI highly recommend Suzanne Arca of Suzanne Arca Designs. She understands native plants and grasses and how to integrate them into your existing garden and she is skilled in drought resistant plants as well. She does beautiful designs as well as implementation but you can choose your preference. Her website is suzannearcadesign.com and her phone number is 510-558-0638 Sharon\n\nI cannot say enough good things about our gardeners, Bill Lloyd and Dina Blackwell (http://blackwelloyd.com/). They have an extraordinary array of skills, to which they continue to add. We have three locations where they work for us, two of which have benefited from installations as well as on-going maintenance. They are efficient, thoughtful, thorough, and creative. We actually learned of them because of the work they did next door. Now, several neighbors have hired them to do their gardening. Specific to your needs, they are quite partial to using natives and minimizing water usage. One installation was chosen for the 2014 garden tour, a testimony to excellence in this profession. Nori\n\nLooking for a landscape designer/contractor\n\nJune 2013\n\nWe're looking for a landscape designer/contractor to help us with a side yard project at our south Berkeley home this summer. Job will include some basic visioning and planning, removal of a fairly large tree (and stump), fence design/construction, construction of a garbage/recycling enclosure, landscaping and irrigation. We'd prefer to hire one company that can do it all rather than separately hire a designer and labor. We're looking for a good value but mostly we'd like to find someone reliable who will return calls! Thanks in advance. - Ashleigh\n\nI love working with Kellie Owen - she's certified, from Petaluma, but works down here some days. She's done everything in my Emeryville garden from advising to clean up to installing irrigation. Kellie: 415 509 1431. louise\n\nJosh Thayer at Native Sun Gardens is a plant genius! He can help you plan to get the most out of your yard spaces. He helped transform my steep, empty, arid yard in Montclair into an edible orchard, working with me and my wife to pick fruit trees and vines, berry bushes, and native plants that would work in pretty challenging terrain. He now comes by several times a year to check on plants and advise on care, which I try to do. He has a crew of workers that can come in and do the work for you, or he can just do the design work and advising piece. We did not use him as a 'one stop shop,' but he is well-connected to the landscape contractor community and could probably coordinate most of the work you want if you let him know that's what you're looking for. But even if he can't, I would highly recommend bringing him into your project so you are happy with your landscape down the road. - Ben\n\nI saw your post in an earlier newsletter but didn't have time to respond then. Please call landscape contractor Cece Littlepage about your project. She's a very talented designer, extremely knowledgeable about plants, as well as very professional and reliable. Cece has helped me with a number of projects in my garden and her advice is always spot on. I feel like she really listens to what I'm wanting to accomplish and has the experience and expertise to put it all together into a plan that works. I also appreciate that she works to keep costs within my budget without ever sacrificing quality. And- she's a pleasure to work with! Call Cecelia Littlepage 510-848-4178 or email her at cflittlepage [at] earthlink.net. Nancy\n\nNeed a landscaper for my front garden in El Cerrito\n\nMay 2013\n\nHi. I have had a lot of trouble finding landscapers who are either reliable or available to help me plant a new garden in the front of my house. Looking for a designer to help me pick out plants that will thrive without a lot of watering or fussing. A Mediterranean garden ideally with a lot of succulents and native plants. Also someone who knows how to transform our sprinklers in the front to an irrigation drip system. Please only recommend people who are known to you. Would also hire someone who is not a professional but knows how to do all of this. Thanks! Mari\n\nCall Michael McFadden at Planted Earth, http://plantedearthdesign.com/ He lives in El Cerrito and has for several years, so the Planted Earth team has done lots of local work, both big and small projects. I have seen some of his low-maintenence designs and the are beautiful and practical, as well as kid-friendly. Welcome to El Cerrito! Long-time El Cerrito gardener\n\nLandscape services needed in Lamorinda\n\nApril 2013\n\nWe need a landscape designer to help us add to the landscaping we have in our front and back yards. We also need this person to help us add an irrigation system. There are many recommendations on the BPN website, but I need someone who would be willing to work in the Lamorinda area. I would prefer someone who could help us design and plant a low-maintenance, drought resistant, dear resistant garden. Please send recommendations. Thank you! Seeking landscaper for Moraga\n\nWe live in Lafayette and have worked with a wonderul landscaper named Chris for several years. When we first hired him, he helped us design our sprinkler system and our yard. He's done our weekly maintenance since. Contact Chris (925) 788-3065 Happy Customer\n\nSue and Matt Royter of Lantech Design helped us put in exactly the type of yard you are describing, as well as an irrigation system, in our house in Lafayette. We also have them come quarterly or semi annually to do major seasonal cleanup...other than that and mowing our (now) very small patch of lawn, our yard needs almost no work. I have rarely seen people work as hard as Sue and Matt, and all the people who work for them are long time employees. http://www.lantech-design.com/index.html Claire\n\nLooking for Landscape Designer\n\nMarch 2013\n\nWe would like to have help in transforming our disaster of a backyard into a beautiful outdoor space that we can enjoy. We have many challenges: There are safety concerns as we don't have anything blocking the backyard from the top of the garage; we have an old fireplace that we believe was part of an existing back house back in the day; there is an ugly, ugly fountain that we would like removed or hidden; there is a huge pergola structure that we would like removed; there is an ugly cement bunker looking space directly outside our backdoor that has steps leading up to the backyard that we would like transformed somehow,etc. You get the picture it is a mess. We also need advice on types of plants and spatial organization. We live in Oakland. We probably don't have the money to do everything at once but we need someone who has a vision and can provide plans in stages so that we can divide the project and take one thing at a time but have an overall picture of what the end product will look like. Any recommendations out there would be greatly appreciated. JC\n\nHello - last year I worked with Sue Oda (http://sueoda.com/) to redesign my backyard. She spent a lot of time with me over a few visits to really get a feel for what I needed and would be able to maintain. She also brought her trusted contractors over to give me quotes on work that needed to be done. She gave me the whole blueprint for the re-do and a lovely binder with the plants and description and care so that when I am ready to install the design I have it and can use whoever I chose or do it myself. I know you can have a full service level from her and she will get the whole project done, but like you we have to do it in phases for budget so I have been very happy using her suggested contractors and doing piece by piece. I also like how mindful she was of my small children and making the space with them in mind. good luck! new yard mama\n\nWe used Lou Dixon with Bio Friendly Gardens and have been really pleased with the results. He is reasonably priced and does good work. http://biofriendlygardens.com/index.html Dawn H\n\nI can heartily recommend Heidi Tarv\\xc3\\x83\\xc2\\xabr. She's an artist and sculptor as well as landscape designer, and she only does the design work, so no conflict of interest. Wonderful, beautiful ideas, but she works with you to get what you want. http://berkeleygardencoach.com/ Landscape lover\n\nHeidi Tarver (www.berkeleygardencoach.com) Check out her website. Heidi is a good designer and affordable. I have a challenging backyard and a while back, I worked with her on a garden project that has made my garden a wonderful place to be! She is easy to work with, has great ideas, and she has a number of different design packages so you can find one to fit your budget. I have recommended her to several friends, and they have all been really happy with the results. Good luck! Elsa\n\nThe Berkeley Garden Coach is your answer! Heidi is sooo good: great eye, great contacts for contractors, just great to work with. We're in the middle of a big project transforming our barren hill and chicken yard into something really pretty and useful. She's really worth it. http://berkeleygardencoach.com/bio/. heiditarver [at] gmail.com. 510-928-5591 Not a green thumb\n\nI can definitely recommend Tomi Kobara. We worked with her very recently on our back yard and she is happy to work in phases as you save up for different elements. What was previously a sea of lava rock is now a gorgeous multi-level deck, with small lawn, plantings, veggie box and more. Just what we wanted. Tomi works directly with a great, reliable contractor for demo/construction/installation and it was so nice having one point of contact for this whole project. Happy to answer more questions if you have them. http://www.tomi-kobara.com/index.html\n\nrosiem\n\nLandscape Contractor Referrals\n\nMarch 2013\n\nHi there, We are looking to renovate our backyard this spring and are searching for a quality/affordable landscape contractor. We are in the Redwood Heights neighborhood of Oakland. We will be tearing out the old pavement, repaving a new area, adding a tiny area of grass and hooking this up to the sprinkler system. Forewarning, we have a huge Redwood Tree in this very small backyard and we have no idea what issues this will pose. If you have someone to recommend, please send them my way! Thanks! Alexandria\n\nAs the husband of a landscape architect, I would say that 'the huge Redwood Tree in your very small backyard' means that 'quality' will trump 'affordable' when searching for your landscape contractor. The plant pallet compatible with redwood trees is quite limited, so someone could design and install a very nice backyard for you that would slowly (or maybe rapidly) die out. Though it doesn't seem you are looking for one who works with native plants, I recommend Michael Thilgen (4 Dimensions, 510-893-1999) for his knowledge of plant compatibility. . Andus B\n\nI would like to recommend landscaper Chris Freeman. He is new to the Bay Area and has a company called Deep Roots Urban Gardens.He did some excellent work for us recently. His website is www.deeprootsurbangardens.com He can be reached at 516-849-7970 douglas\n\nSaw the responses to your post and have to chime in with another 'yes' for Michael Thilgen and Four Dimensions Landscape. We have two very large redwoods (and a massive cedar) and Four Dimensions created a beautiful new native landscape for our yard. They are extremely knowledgable and excellent listeners. Redwood garden too\n\nReasonably priced landscape design?\n\nJan 2013\n\nI am looking for someone who can help me redesign my garden, but I'm on a tight budget, and the bids I've gotten from landscape architects are WAY over what I have to spend. Has anyone found a garden designer who charges reasonable rates? My garden space is small, but I think it could be really nice if I could get some help with design. Any suggestions are welcomed. Thank you so much. Belinda A.\n\nI hired Lara of Bountiful Botanicals (http://bountifulbotanicals.com/) and liked what she did with my small front yard. I don't recall the price exactly, but I think she was reasonable. anon\n\nGarry Bernhardt might be a good fit for your garden and budget. He is both a gardner and landscape designer, very creative and reasonably priced. Phone 847-5070. w\n\nHi Belinda, Check out Kroeger Gardens. Link below: http://www.kroegergardens.com/ Anne is very talented and it shows in her work. Her first consultation is free as stated on her website. In addition, you will find alot of free advice and information on the site, which in my opinion simply translates into an individual that is extremely passionate about what they do. Good luck with your project. julie\n\nConsider calling Teri Hayes at 510-697-2503. She is not a landscape architect so her prices are as lot more reasonable. She is a gardener who has a flair for design and can work with an owner to plan a garden suited to his/her wants and desires. Her abilities also allow her to be able to create attractive areas as well as design drought tolerant gardens which save money on water and monthly maintenance. Roger\n\nTake a look at this website: www.berkeleygardencoach.com. I worked with Heidi on a garden project last fall and found her help invaluable. My garden is also small, but she came up with a way of utilizing space that makes it feel much larger. I now have tiny 'rooms', different areas for sitting, veggies, flowers, etc. I love my new garden, it didn't cost an arm and a leg, and Heidi is also coaching me on how to take care of the plants and keep the garden healthy and beautiful. I really recommend her as an great alternative to expensive landscape architects. Her phone number is 510-928-5591. A.R.\n\nWe have been extremely pleased with the services provided by Heidi/Berkeley Garden Coach. I believe Heidi saved us thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars on our garden project. She worked with us to come up with a hardscape plan, identify appropriate professionals, select plants that would thrive in our location, etc. We did a lot of the labor ourselves, and with her guidance it was fun and we learned a lot. Heidi was respectful of our likes and dislikes, she listened carefully and made suggestions that were in keeping with our goals and vision for the garden. She never tried to push her own agenda, which we really appreciated. In the course of a year we were able to redesign our whole yard and get most of the ideas implemented. With her help we were able to avoid making the kinds of errors that could have cost us a lot of money and also a lot of headaches and frustration. We could not be more happy as we see our garden (and ourselves, the gardeners!) evolving. Check out the Berkeley Garden Coach website at www.berkeleygardencoach.com. Amy\n\nNeed a landscape architect for Kensington home\n\nJuly 2012\n\nHi, we are remodeling our yard, and need a landscape architect to help us with the hardscape and landscape design for our home in kensington. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated. Lesbeth\n\nContact Lesley Golden. She did my parent's garden and it turned out beautifully. lesley [at] ltladesign.com Kelly O\n\nGardening/Landscaping advice for new house\n\nMay 2012\n\nHi all. My wife and I recently bought a house that has a huge back and side yard. It's been relatively maintained, but not much love or creativity has gone into it. We see amazing potential in it, but are frankly overwhelmed with the possibilities and work involved. Ideally we'd like to do the work ourselves, but we have a 6-month old and I'm having a hard time finding the time to do even basic maintenance. We'd love to have a deck or patio type space where we can eat and BBQ. We also want to grow our own food, probably in garden beds. I think the lawns need to be replanted and there are a bunch of bushes that we want to remove, but what we do with the space is the big question. I look at a lot of yards when I'm walking my dog around the neighborhood, but then get overwhelmed with the possibilities. Where can I get ideas advice on this type of thing. Is it crazy to think that I can do this all myself? Are there landscapers/gardeners that can help with the work and/or give ideas? How much does it cost to get a landscaper to completely redo the yard for you? I have no clue when it comes to these kinds of things. Overwhelmed gardener\n\nYou should call Heidi Tarver, the 'Berkeley Garden Coach'! We had a similar problem, and she worked with us to develop a vision for our garden, then put us in touch with professionals who could help us turn our garden plan into a beautiful livable outdoor space. Heidi has both the creative vision (she uios quite the artists) and the organizational skills to help you move forward on your project, and the cost is way less than hiring a landscape architect to install a garden for you. Also, she can coach you on how to care for your garden so it will stay beautiful all year and for years to come. She is a pleasure to work with. Her website is www.berkeleygardencoach.com. Liz J\n\nYou should definetly check out WWW.bayareastonegardens.com. Bill Armijo is very good and can help you with what you want as well as suggest ideas. He's very easy to work with and there are a number of BPN readers who have used him. He makes the process simple. Happy Customer\n\nI can't say enough good things about Arthur Brito of Arboralis, but fortunately I don't need to because you can see his designs on his website. We used him for a small project, but he works well with projects of any size. He's easy to talk to, and he'll work within your budget. For a small investment in design at the start, you'll end up with a landscape you're really happy with - at least that's my experience. You can reach Arthur at www.Arborealis.com or 510.522.2708. Good luck!\n\nYou certainly could do it yourself, but it sounds pretty overwhelming to me. I recommend you give Joshua Thayer of Native Sun Gardens a call. (510 332-2809 www.nativesungardens.com). Josh is a wonderful designer who likes working edibles as well as decorative plants. He's also super flexible about how he works with you, he'll provide everything from a quick sketch to a full blown plan, to an installed garden and coach you on how to plant or maintain it. He can also plan in phases if you know what you want but can't afford to do it all at once. He did a great job taking into account the different tastes of my partner and I (I love cottage, he loves Asian, and did such a great job with our front that we hired him to do some things in our backyard. Kirsten\n\nI would like to recommend a unique and amazing designer and gardener, Michelle Bayba. I have never had a gardener like her. She is knowledgeable about all aspects of gardening, and she designs gardens as if they were her own. She's full of energy and natural creativity. She is personable and fun to work with, willing to roll up sleeves with me or leave me homework, she does amazing work, and has very reasonable rates given her skill level. She's now worked with four families in our neighborhood, and I attest to the fact that one of her many strengths is helping people to formulate a realistic plan based on their budget, interests, and the limitations of their location. A Berkeley native, Michelle knows the local plants and takes into account the practicality of a garden and how you use it. She knows how to design a garden from scratch, or as in my case, take a straggly garden and properly prune it, fill it in with new plants, nourish them organically, and upgrade the irrigation system. As I said, since I hired Michelle, she now has four clients just on my neighborhood block. She has individualized to each of our needs-- and we are all thrilled. She can be reached at 510-385-6535. anon\n\nGarden design that can be implemented over time\n\nMay 2012\n\nWe would like to redesign our backyard; a design employed a dozen years ago did not end up being very workable, and our sprinkler system is pretty much gone, so we need a new one. Our goal is to have an area for seating with room for a table, chairs and so on so we can eat outside now and then as well as entertain. We would like to form a division from the front and back part of the yard so we can have raised beds for veggies. We would like to have mostly native/drought resistant plants. We have a small side yard that we would want to retain for flowers--the only area I would want to give a little more water to, as it is small. I do love roses. We need to put in some trees for screening and privacy, as well. We also have the unfortunate presence of a neighbor's redwood tree, which scatters debris into our yard. We need someone who can work with these issues and restraints. So we are talking landscaping/hardscaping (we want the seating area to be one that does not require any weeding--weeds poking through pavers is not in the picture for me--done that). Here is the biggest issue: we need a plan that can be carried out over time, as it is not affordable for us all at once (self-employed spouse). Does anyone have experience with any landscape designers who will do this? Thank you!\n\nI saw your post and have to send you a recommendation. Last year we hired Sarah Ray who had worked with a very good friend of mine. We also had a difficult time finding anyone who would work with us in stages. Sarah respected our budget and was able to design a master landscape plan that we could implement over time. Having a plan in place before we began the actual work, allowed us to budget for each phase. She was amazing and insightful and was able to actually hear my ideas, even if they weren't exactly what she would have done. So far we have done our front yard and back patio with a trellis. We are so happy with our garden and having someone so knowledgable and approachable made the whole process enjoyable. We would hire her again in a second! Her phone number is 510-812-7498. Good luck to you, Gina\n\nPaul Burns has done a lot of multiuse spaces like the one you describe, and would likely be open to working in stages. He's honest, reliable and pleasure to work with. (510) 390-1057. MV\n\nLandscape designer to include children's play\n\nMay 2012\n\nWe have a large backyard and would like a designer/landscaper help plan for optimal use for child play -- jungle gym, bikes, grassy area, etc. Do you have any recommendations?\n\nThere is a garden designer/coach in Berkeley who I think is really exceptional. Her name is Heidi Tarver, and her website address is www.berkeleygardencoach.com. My neighbor worked with her last year on a back yard design that included a lot of play space for their 3 young children, and while I don't have children myself, I was extremely impressed with the result in terms of how she integrated the play spaces into the overall landscape design. After seeing my neighbor's yard come together, I hired her to work with me on my garden, and I love her designs, which I am in the process of implementing. I would definitely recommend you check her out. A.J.\n\nWe have used Tomi Kobara, wwww.tomi-kobara.com, Landscape Architect, for our backyard, frontyard, and deck remodel. She is wonderful at bringing our ideas to life, and our backyard and front are both beautiful and functional (garden space, pingpong table, planting area). She also was great with working with existing materials and incorporating new ideas. I highly recommend her. She can be reached at tomiskye [at] gmail.com Chan\n\nDiane designed a functional (for our 2 kids) and beautiful (for the parents) space for us in the front of the house. We love her work! Your backyard sounds bigger and I'm sure she can come up with some great ideas for you! She incoporated most of her design and love the yard. Her contact info follows. Feel free to email me for more information.

We already have a pretty good idea of what we want the yard to look like, but we need a professional to let us know how and if our vision would work, and how much. We'd like to get multiple bids, and it would be great to have someone who would do multiple sketches for us - to give us options. We live in South Berkeley and have a large yard. Part of the job includes a large play structure, raised beds, and a deck. Thanks for any leads! Heather\n\nI've worked with and highly recommend Arthur Brito of Arborealis (510.522.2708) and Robert Cruikshank ((510) 486-8282). Arthur is a landscape designer, is very low key, willing work with any budget or job size, and is very willing to give you several design options so you can choose. His designs are creative and beautiful, and he's good at designing spaces that are both affordable and comfortable to live in. http://arborealis.com/ Robert is a landscape contractor, who is also willing to work with you and very competent. He specializes in wood and fine masonry construction. http://www.robertscruikshank.com/ Arthur made several sketches for us, and Robert did some wood and flagstone work to enclose a tricky porch area. Good luck with your project, Pat\n\nLooking for good landscape designer in East Bay\n\nApril 2012\n\nHello, We're looking for a good, affordable landscape designer to help with a front yard. Thanks, Julia\n\nAfter many years of unsuccessful starts on our backyard, we broke down and finally hired a professional to do our backyard. We hired Fiddlehead Gardens in Berkeley and we are so happy about our decision. The back yard is finally a place where we can relax and entertain. We have a small back yard in Berkeley (1000 square feet) and Mya (the Fiddlehead owner) helped us transform it into an outdoor living space. It looks gorgeous and fits all of our needs. Mya was really great about working with our vision for the backyard at a reasonable cost. We have yet to start working on our front yard (we need to save up a little more before we do so) but when we do, we will definitely hire her again. I highly recommend that you contact this company. You will be so happy that you did. hilge34\n\nWe hired Sandra Nevala-Lee to help us w/ shady & windy spots in our yard. She introduced native plants that do well in windy West Berkeley. And it's been amazing! Things are growing, blooming, etc. Sandra is also a lot of fun to work with - and very informative. You can contact her: 510-502-0992 s.nevalalee [at] gmail.com P.O. Box 2128 Castro Valley, CA 94546 Her website: https://sites.google.com/site/cagardensbyanativecalifornian/ a flower lover w/o a green thumb\n\nI highly recommend Tamar Carson Landscaping (tamarrogelio [at] yahoo.com). Tamar and her husband/partner Rogelio were brilliant last summer in design vision and execution of the project of my back yard cement driveway which was transformed by unbelievable stonescape and equally impressive ground preparation and selection of plants. They are extremely knowledgeable and creative in their solutions. 9 months later, my garden simply gets better and better. It was such a pleasure to work with them and their staff. I enjoyed the process and the result. Excellent follow through, attention to every detail and a wonderful collaboration. Tamar gave me about 20 addresses in Bekeley to show their work and seeing what they have done locally is what convinced me. kstreets\n\nHeidi Tarver (www.berkeleygardencoach.com) might be just the designer for you. Check out her website and I think you will see what I mean. She is very affordable for one thing. And she is a fabulous designer of gardens, as well as furniture, jewelry and probably other things. I worked with her on a garden project a few years ago, and I was delighted with what she came up with for my complicated, challenging back yard. She is really easy to work with, full of great ideas, and she has a number of different design packages so you can find one to fit your budget. I have recommended her to several friends, and they have all been really happy with the results. Good luck! Angie\n\nCheck out the website for Berkeley Garden Coach Heidi Tarver (www.berkeleygardencoach.com). I am currently working with Heidi on re-landscaping our back garden, and I am delighted with her work. She has great design sense and creative ideas, but also really listens to what I want and works with me to bring my vision into being. Her pricing structure is extremely reasonable, and she is very flexible and accommodating. Really a great person to work with - I couldn't recommend her more. My project isn't finished yet, but I have seen some of her finished work and it is absolutely lovely. Her phone number is 510-928-5591. Good luck with your project! kb\n\nReview of Tamar Carson - Landscape Architect\n\nMarch 2012\n\nI'm thinking of using Tamar Carson for a much-needed landscape design for the front of our house...We've heard good things but most of the reviews are old. Does anyone have recent experience with her? We've done a lot of work on our home including re-shingling and now want a landscape project with a lot of visual impact, something that will highlight the house and give us strong curb appeal. vanclej1\n\nHi, I wanted to respond to the question about Tamar Carson landscaping. Tamar redid my yard last year, and the garden she created is a source of ongoing pleasure, pride and joy for us. She basically took the most hideous patch of weeds and concrete and turned into a glorious, lovely garden -- for sure the nicest on our block . Please email if you want to come take a look!!! What I love about Tamar is how personal her artistry is. She really listened to my preferences about plants and colors, studied our house (paint colors, architectural style) and designed something that feels both very personal and beautiful and harmonizes with and enhances our home. She's an artist and a great listener and brings, with her wonderful husband and business partner Rogelio a lot of integrity to her designs - it's not cookie cutter but totally personalized. I really, really love my garden and of all the work we've done on our house, this is the project that gives me the most ongoing pleasure. Email me if you would like to see it - now that it is early spring plants are flowering and looking better than ever. Tamar's email is tamarrogelio [at] yahoo.com, 654- 8242. Rinat\n\nI'm glad you asked about Tamar--you never know what to think when the reviews are old! I'm happy to say that she did a fabulous job for us--our front and back yards were both total disasters, and she transformed them. In the back, she needed to take out a jungle of plants, plus some broken-down structures, and she replaced them with a yard that everyone comments on--a combo of paving and wonderful plantings. In the front yard, she removed our decaying benches and plants, and created a lovely, unified garden (and low wall) that passersby always stop and admire.\n\nShe's also GREAT to work with--truly good listener, totally approachable, smart, creative, knowledgeable, etc. And her crew is her husband (a great person himself!) plus longtime workers who are incredibly considerate. Really, we can't recommend her highly enough! --LOVING our landscape in Albany\n\nArtful Landscaper with a Berkeley feel\n\nJan 2012\n\nWe've decided that first impressions really matter.. so we want to improve the landscaping in the front of our house. We'd like to work with someone artful, but who listens, and does not promote their design. I really don't want to be pushed toward drought-resistance or irrigation project. I want to be guided by plants, a sense of place, and a Berkeley feel. We want that feeling to surround our house. Anyone have recommendations for people, companies, or interview questions for landscape architects. -chris\n\nI would like to recommend Heather Clauss at Aspect Design Landscape (http://www.aspectland.com/). Heather really listens to her clients and comes up with designs based on their desires and the needs of the site. She has a lot of experience with local residential gardens, she is reasonably priced, and she has a fabulous design aesthetic. She also has great taste when selecting plants. Leslie\n\nI know exactly what you mean about wanting a garden resource who really listens carefully for what you're after and then looks for ways to work with the energy in the existing plants and landscape. Heidi Tarver ((510-928-5591; http://berkeleygardencoach.com/) is an affordable Berkeley garden expert who does exactly that. What I loved about working with her was how much she taught me about doing as much as I could for myself. But she also put me in touch with good helpers when I needed more muscle. She's great. --Happy Berkeley Gardener\n\nI highly recommend www.berkeleygardencoach.com Heidi is wonderful to work with, really listens to what you want, and is an incredible artist, with plants and otherwise.

Here is her email address. juliehicks24 [at] comcast.net Good luck Eric\n\nHi there - I have to recommend a FABULOUS and inexpensive landscaping team - Pat Hannon of Your Green Spaces (http://www.yourgreenspaces.com/) and cell 925-435-2801. He has been doing various improvements for me since last year, and I have recommended him to several people - all are delighted. He can do everything from hardscapes to fences (just finished a huge one for a friend of mine), lawns and irrigation, and very knowledgeable about plants and landscaping. He also does yard maintenance and clean up. Moreover, a super nice guy, responsive and responsible, honest, and very reasonably priced. Give him a call. Sarah\n\nI highly recommend Tracey Goldberg of GoldDirt Design to find the right solution for your front garden. She's easy to work with, listened to our needs, likes and dislikes, incorporating all that into a design that works beautifully with the architecture and aesthetic of our house. It's easy to maintain, relaxing to live in day after day, lovely without looking too fussy or designed. She has a strong knowledge of plant materials and hardscape and has no agenda or axe to grind.

Jane G\n\nNeed someone to advise me about the plants in my yard\n\nDec 2011\n\nI am a new homeowner in Albany and need someone to give me some info about my new backyard. I basically want someone to walk around with me and tell me what type of trees and plants we have, how to care for them, etc. Our backyard is tiny and I am not asking for landscaping advice. Just a green thumb to help me out. Also, we are going to put in a tiny patch of lawn (I want my kids to have some grass to play on) so I'd prefer not to have someone who will give me a really hard time about putting in grass. Thanks! New yard owner\n\nI recommend Berkeley Garden Coach Heidi Tarver. She does landscape design, and also the kind of coaching/advising you are seeking. I worked with her on several projects and found her to be extremely knowledgeable, creative and fun to work with. You can check out her rates and also her blog at www.berkeleygardencoach.com. Couldn't recommend her more highly. A.Smith\n\nI think our gardener, Sai Duhamel would be a great fit for you. He's a 'plant nerd' who used to work at the Botanical Garden and a great guy to work with. He's been a great help for us in planning our edible backyard and maintaining the decorative landscape up front. I think he has small children at home too so probably could help you make child friendly decisions.

The hardscape (garden wall, path) as well as irrigation system was installed two years ago and in good condition, we simply need assistance with choosing plants and designing a garden layout. Our garden is currently a hodge-podge of plants, some old, some new. It definitely lacks cohesion and that 'wow' factor. We know what we like (modern aesthetic, Mediterranean plantings) but really need help with choosing plants and designing the overall look. Thanks for any suggestions! brown thumb in Alameda\n\nI know a GREAT landscape designer. He has wonderful ideas about how to create 'just enough garden' for his clients. If you want 'more' he will also pay close attention to his clients desires. Peter has many beautiful pictures to show you the work he has done in the past. Aside from that, he's just a really nice guy to work with. He worked for me quite recently and it was a very harmonious experience! You can reach Peter at: 699-5441 or gradjansky [at] gmail.com. Best of Luck and have fun! Leah M\n\nI highly recommend Michelle Bayba (385-6535). She completely designed/ landscaped my front and backyards (she also did the irrigation and continues to do maintenance/pruning) It is a joy to work with Michelle and my backyard is a beautiful retreat which has now become the favorite 'room' in my house. Michelle is an excellent listener, creative and dependable. I went through a number of gardeners over the decades and when I wanted someone new I interviewed about a dozen people from BPN and looked at their gardens. Michelle won hands down. 524 4867\n\nDefinitely recommend Heidi Tarver. She's a wonderful sculptor and painter who is also a landscape designer, and she works closely with you to shape something that reflects your aesthetic. She's lovely to work with, as well. BerkeleyGardenCoach.com. Dan\n\nI recommend you contact Heidi Tarver. She redesigned my neighbor's garden, and it went from juniper and weeds to a lovely mediterranean hillside full of colorful and interesting plantings. The redesign happened in the spring, and the garden looked great throughout the season. Even now the colors and textures are gorgeous. I am planning to make some changes to my own garden in a few months, and I will definitely be working with Heidi. You can look at her website: http://berkeleygardencoach.com/ for lots more information on her services. Incidentally, the website itself is a good source of garden information, including a great blog about Bay Area Gardening. Good luck with your project! Alice\n\nDesigner for small garden who will work with me\n\nJune 2011\n\nI have a small, very sunny garden that is, quite frankly, a mess. I would like to redo it completely, but maybe keep a few of the plantings that I like. The hardscape is mostly ok, but I want to add a stone path and maybe a little terracing. I want to be involved in recreating the garden, so I'm looking for a garden expert to work WITH me on remaking this space into something lovely. I don't want someone to do it for me - in fact I plan to do most of the labor myself, with hopefully a little help on the heavy lifting. Mostly what I need is someone with vision, who can see the potential in my space and help me redesign it, for a reasonable price. Any recommendations would be much appreciated. Alana\n\nLeigh Gronet can help you create a wonderful garden design. Here is the link to her website: http://www.leighdesigns.biz She did a plan on paper for our small Berkeley yard which we then had some help with planting and installing. She can also do a digital garden design that allows you to see what it will look like before it's finished. Our yard has become a little paradise for the local birds, including some nesting hummingbirds. A small fountain that she suggested has become a favorite drinking and bathing spot for our feathered friends as well. Melanie H\n\nHeidi Tarver, www.berkeleygardencoach.com, 510-928-5591. She's a wonderful artist/designer/coach who works closely with you to design your garden in a way that speaks to your personal taste. It really turns your garden into something sculptural and beautiful that fits you very specifically. Inspired Gardener\n\nI can personally recommend Claudia Vieira. She helped me re-make my yards of water-devouring lawn to islands of beautiful, native and drought-resistant plants. She worked with me as a garden coach - offering instruction and inspiration. I did most of the hands-on work, but she was there to literally 'dig in' when I needed it. And I learned a lot from her expertise. Call her: 510.653-6535. Pat C\n\nHeidi Tarver is wonderful to work with on small gardens. I hired her to work with us on an overhaul of our garden, which had been neglected for years. She had wonderful ideas for reconfiguring the planting spaces, and for an extremely reasonable price developed a whole step-by-step plan that we were able to implement with ease. Heidi has great vision and a deep knowledge of Bay Area gardening. I really enjoyed working with her, and I love my new garden! Her web address is www.berkeleygardencoach.com, and her phone number is 510-928- 5591. Amy\n\nLandscape designer for Oakland front garden\n\nJune 2011\n\nI'm looking for a landscape designer to help me develop a plan for both hardscape and plantings for a medium to small front yard in Oakland. I would be willing to hire a student or someone just starting out -- I'm on a tight budget. I want to do as much of the actual work as I can myself, but cannot do the plan myself. It's hard times out there for these folks, so I wonder if anyone knows of someone who might want a smallish project. Thanks for any ideas. Signed, my neighbors will thank you\n\nSounds like the Berkeley Garden Coach would be perfect for your needs. I have been working with her on a similar redesign and it's been a great experience. She helped me figure out what to do with my overgrown and not very interesting back garden, then put me in touch with some really wonderful people who helped install irrigation, clear some of the old ugly shrubs and prep the soil for planting. I am doing quite a lot of the work myself, but needed some assistance in specific areas, especially design. Her pricing is extremely reasonable, and you can tailor it to your specific needs. Really great, and she is super easy to work with. Her website is www.berkeleygardencoach.com. Good luck with your project.\n\nI've used Arthur Brito of Arborealis. He does only design work, not the actual planting or construction, if any is needed or desired. I like his designs a lot - you can see his style at www.arborealis.com. He works in different ways. We just needed ideas and a rough sketch, and he charged us a very reasonable hourly rate. He also does complete construction drawings and will arrange for subcontractors for bigger projects, but sounds like your needs are closer to ours. His number is 510.522.2708. Good luck\n\nHeidi Tarver is an accomplished painter and sculptor who is a wonderful landscape design coach. She works differently from most, she collaborates with you, works with you to come up with the design you most want and coaches you through that process. It's a more personal way of getting the garden you want. Much less expensive than a landscape contractor. www.berkeleygardencoach.com/510-928-5591 Happy Gardener\n\nLandscape Designer for small backyard in Berkeley\n\nMay 2011\n\nMy family lives in Berkeley and we have a small back yard that we would like to landscape. We do like to go to nurseries, look at plants and garden ourselves but what we don't do is agreeing on an overall landscape design. We have two kids and a dog and ground cover needs to be picked carefully (grass, stone, gravel, sand?). Also, where does the grill go, what type of flowers/plants grow in the semi-shade and are we able to accommodate a vegetable garden? We are looking for a landscape designer who is willing to meet us in our garden, spend two hours with us and come up with a 'vision'. I will be happy to execute the project once we know how to arrange things but we need some basic ideas first. Can somebody recommend a landscaper who is not after 'the big job' but would be willing to brainstorm some ideas for/with us? Wanna-be-landcape-designer\n\nA great company is TrainaThought Landscape Designs. They are out of Southern California, but are often in the bay area. I heard about him through a friend and was able to find a time that worked for us both to meet. He does amazing work and isn't too expensive! Minor changes have made our outdoor space more enjoyable and even added value to our home. The onwers name is Jason Traina, 805-801-6439. Joedy M\n\nJosh Deutsch is a gardener and landscaper with a bent towards sustainability--using yards for growing food, reusing materials that would otherwise become landfill, etc. I knew him when he was tutoring my son, and just getting his landscape business--his true love--off the ground. I think he might be very flexible in suggesting yard alternatives and encouraging the homeowners to take care of the yard. His contact information is at http://www.backyardfoodgardens.com/contact-us/ Cynthia\n\nJeannie Fitch is very good at looking at your property and coming up with a variety of very creative ideas that will all work with your particular yard. She is very knowledgeable with landscaping and in many different kinds of gardens. She will come to your home and give you her suggestions and a price of how much it will cost at no charge. She has worked wonders at my preschools where there are children playing. My yard is beautiful! I would gladly recommend her.Her tel # is 925-922-0322 a fan\n\nHi there. I would highly recommend you call Kathleen Carson-Asher of LANDesign. She used to work for a big-name high-end landscape design firm but now has her own small but powerful team. She literally loves plants (and understands them and what they need) and loves to educate her clients about them. She does hourly consulting as well as on-going 'garden coaching' for people who want to steer their gardens themselves.We have her come once per quarter and do a major clean-up, and she always takes time to replant, make recommendations, and cut back very carefully and skillfully. We love her -- and so does our garden! Call her at 510/531-4905. Good luck! Lauran\n\nWe hired Lara Wilson from Bountiful Botanicals for our landscaping. We have an unusual yard space with some sloping and it was difficult to envision a plan for our yard. She worked with us to come up with a plan that met all of our needs (we have young kids and one of our priorities was a very safe, kid-friendly yard). She is very reasonably priced with no cost surprises, meticulous, and creative, and the end result looks terrific! She knows her plants, what grows best in shade vs. sun, colors that look good together, etc. She also is very good with choosing between flagstone, mulch, grass and granite. I would highly recommend her! http://www.bountifulbotanicals.com/ Rebecca\n\nI do have a recommendation and that is to Michael Monahan. He is a 25 year Certified Arborist, Green Certified Horticulturist and a CAL Poly grad in Horticultural Science. But more importantly he is a great person with great prices. I have used him for various projects over the years and have been extremely satisfied with his work. He also is avialable for consultations. So give him a call at 510.501.6791 or email him at michaeldmonahan [at] gmail.com. Carol\n\nI have just the person for you!! Her name is Jamie Rutherford, and she has 10 years of landscaping/gardening experience in the bay area. She specializes in mixing ornamental and edible landscapes and focus on keeping the garden organic and inviting to nature; birds, bees and butterflies. She has been working for Sacred Space Gardens for the last 6 years as the head gardener and is currently working on going into business for herself. I emailed her to ask if your type of project was interesting to her, and she replied, 'I would love to consult and help design her space with an active family in mind while respecting budgetary constraints.' Kim rutherfordgardens [at] gmail.com kimander\n\nAnthony Fontaine is incredible. He can walk into any size garden in any shape and have a vision that is classy, clean and in line with the structures around it. He's also incredibly affordable. He's a one man whirlwind - jackhammered out about 40 square fee of our driveway and then went on to replant a 4'x4' sage, dig up a weeping cherry and amend the soil in about a 1/3 of our garden all in about an hour and a half. He'll work with you and your ideas or he'll give you his and then you can work together to plan. Ask him for his photo albums of previous jobs - amazing. Fontaine Design 510-320-0184 or fontonio [at] yahoo.com happy garden owner\n\nYou should check out Brian Whyte of Brian Whyte Designs. Super nice guy who knows his stuff. He is based out of North Berkeley but works all over the Bay Area. I've found him equally willing and able to do small and big jobs - from irrigation to full design. 510-388-4006. Heather\n\nI recommend you contact Heidi Tarver, Berkeley Garden Coach. We hired her for a small garden redesign similar to yours, and she was terrific. Heidi consults with clients on an hourly basis, and also has several cool packages that include an initial consult and then a written plan and, if you want, ongoing coaching. She also does full installation for clients that need it. Take a look at her website and see what you think: www.berkeleygardencoach.com. Angie\n\nLandscape architect for child-friendly backyard\n\nMarch 2011\n\nHi, We are looking for a landscape architect that can help us design a backyard that will be toddler-friendly and grow with us as our family grows. We have a steep upslope in our backyard with some terracing, but it is a 'death trap' for our toddler. Our hope is to put in a play area for our child, a dining area, maybe a firepit, and a space for a garden. We are really interested in using edible plants in the landscaping. We are looking for someone who has great ideas on making this a usable space for our family, listens and responds to our ideas, can make drawings for the backyard, help us phase the overall plan, and is responsive. Needing an outdoor space\n\nI highly recommend Arthur Brito at Arborealis. We've worked with several landscape professonals over the years (we have kids and a steep slope too), and Arthur is a great listener, thoughtful, willing to work with our ideas and budget, and great at proposing a design that works in stages (do some now, some in a few years). His number is : 522-2708 Pat\n\nI recommend Larman-Garro landscape architecture (larmangarro.com). They designed our entire yard including retaining walls, paths, patio, fences, irrigation,and planting. They even designed our deck for us (though we used our building contractor to install it). They are a design-build firm, so they do the design work and have their own crew do the work; so it coordinates nicely. We were happy both with the quality of the design work and the construction. DR\n\nLooking for a great gardener/landscape architect for Rockridge garden/patio\n\nFeb 2011\n\nMy wife and I live in a Spanish style home in Rockridge. We are in need of a competent, reasonably priced landscape architect to help us with our patio garden and an upper lawn areas. We need someone who can a) help with space planning, b) make sound planting and landscaping recommendations, c) source materials and d) handle the actual work itself. Lastly, we hope to find someone who is pleasant and reasonably priced. Many thanks and always! Fred\n\nWe love Sarah Herman. Knowledgeable, practical and lovely to work with. http://www.sarahscapedesign.com/ Mardawn\n\nI highly recommend Claudia Vieira landscape design. She lives in Oakland, very knowledgeable about plants, esp drought tolerant natives, great resources for contractors, artistic, low key and easy to talk to. heidi\n\nIt sounds like a fun project! I'd like to recommend Jeni Webber. She is marvelous. She re-did my backyard a few years ago and I've been extremely pleased with the results. We did a total re-design with space planning, planting drought tolerant plants, building a beautiful stone patio, installing a small pond, and setting up an efficient irrigation system. She did a lot of the actual installation herself with several very competent helpers. You can see samples of her work on her website at www.jeniwebber.com. You'll love it. Rosie\n\nI would like to recommend our beyond fabulous landscape designer to you. His name is Andy Lenz of Sempervivum, Tel. 510-812-8954. He can help you with everything on your wish list. He just turned the weed-and-concrete landscape of our recently purchased fixer into a jewel of a front and back yard that is beautiful, useful to the kids as well as us, and was very reasonably priced. We needed to address major drainage and irrigation problems, and Andy came up with functional as well as creative solutions, e.g. diverting rainwater into a large, stone filled pit in the corner of the backyard that soaks up the water and slowly dispenses it into three neighboring gardens. Andy seems to know every plant under the sun and is able to make great recommendations towards more traditional or more native plants, whatever is needed. He is a very gifted designer and I was able to just let him know how I wanted to use the space and design solutions would just come to him. He is very conscientious of the environment, which I was very pleased with -- in our case we were able to use the larger concrete pieces and old bricks salvaged from the yard and put them back together as a retainer wall and walkway which looks amazing -- we get so many compliments and inquiries as to who did the work. And he and his crew are really nice and very easy to work with too! We are really happy we found him. Happy As Can Be\n\nI highly recommed Sarah Ray Landscapes to anyone looking for an amazing landscape designer and contractor. After interviewing several landscape companies last year when my wife and I needed to revamp our steep North Berkeley backyard, we ultimately chose Sarah Ray Landscapes. Sarah was recommended by a business associate who worked wonders on his backyard in Orinda.Being a landscape company that does both design and construction (Sarah is a UCB trained landscape architect and licensed landscape contractor) was a selling point for us. Sarah and her workers turned our weed infested hillside into a totally usable, beautiful space with a outdoor dining patio, trellises, vegetable garden and lawn where my son and I practice soccer. We are always in the backyard and it feels like we doubled the square footage of our home. Sarah Ray Landscapes isn't the cheapest company, (nor the most expensive), but it was the best investment my wife and I have made for our home. Sarah Ray Landscapes 510.812.7498 sarahray_landdesign [at] yahoo.com Michael D\n\nI would highly recommend Francisco Mayo (510 207-4974 , fmayo3065 [at] comcast.net) We have a big garden in North Berkeley and Francisco has been continuously working for us since 2001 and we couldnC,bt be more pleased with him and his crew. They do the regular maintenance and through the years they have done a variety of jobs, all to the highest standards. Francisco also helps with gardening/landscape decisions. We have always been impressed by his tremendous talent as a gardener and landscaper and also by his organizational and managerial skills. He has been totally reliable and available and is a very nice person. Barbara\n\nWhile my husband was in Mexico our water main broke. Thinking it was an irrigation sprinkler problem in our garden, I called Bruce Sutorius for help. I can't say enough good things about Bruce. I found him extremely knowledgeable, professional, reliable and trustworthy. He quickly assessed that it was the water main instead of the sprinkler system. Not being able to turn off the 60-year old main water valve and not wanting to risk breaking it, Bruce called EBMUD and requested that they come out and turn it off. Bruce then referred me to a reputable plumbing company. After taking his wife and sick newborn to the hospital, Bruce returned the same day and thoroughly checked the water and irrigation pipes/systems to give me added pertinent technical information to the problem. Per my request, he then gave me a recommended design and estimate for having the galvanized water pipe replaced with copper piping. Bruce also recommended questions and things to consider when getting estimates from other contractors. His fee for his time and work was extremely reasonable. More importantly, Bruce was able to explain the problem to me so that I was able to understand the technicalities. Bruce answered all my questions and was able to 'think out-of-the-box.' Talking with and listening to Bruce enabled me to calm myself and feel like I could handle the situation to the surprise of my husband who was getting ready to fly back from Mexico. My husband and I would not hesitate to hire Bruce for any irrigation-type work. He has good, working technical expertise in his field, high work ethics, and exceeded my expectations of customer service. He is local -- lives in Richmond. Best to call him on his cell 510 332 0076. toconniem\n\nRecommendation for Landscaper that does small yards\n\nSept 2010\n\nWe've attempted to contact many of the landscaper listings on the website and we've only had one actual reply (they said no). Everyone else did not reply at all. Sooo... We need a landscaper / landscape designer for a small front yard. Is there someone you know is willing to take on smaller jobs? Rich\n\nWe were very happy with our landscape architect Matt Hornby (not to be confused with matt horn - who may also be very good). Matt designed the outdoor space for our small Berkeley yard. We had him draw the plans with the intention of phasing the installation. Matt then installed the first phase of the design and he did a great job. He is a well trained landscape architect with tons of hands on expertise in masonry, fence and gate building. We are constantly receiving compliments on our front gate and fence from people passing by. He also strives to re-use materials and uses good environmental practices. His contact info is: http://www.matthornbygardendesign.com/ bv\n\nI recommend Heidi Tarver (Berkeley Garden Coach) for your job. She is actually a garden coach rather than a landscape designer, which means that in addition to redesigning your yard she will also help you learn how to maintain your plantings and continue to nurture a healthy, happy garden. She can teach you how to perform the work yourself, or hook you into her extensive network of garden professionals who can do the job for you. Heidi is great at understanding your needs and turning your vision into a magical garden space. Her rates are really reasonable too. Take a look at her website: berkeleygardencoach.com or give her a call at 510-928-5591. Best of luck with your garden! Maxine\n\nLandscape architects -- Four Dimensions?\n\nSept 2010\n\nHas anyone worked with or knows of the work of Four Dimensions Landscape Co. in Berkeley? The pictures on their website look gorgeous, but I'd love to hear more about the process of design and build oversight with them. We are looking for someone with landscape architecture experience to advise on regrading and hardscaping our yard. Thanks! Anon\n\nYou may also want to look at www.bayareastonegardens.com Stacy\n\nWe just finished a major grading and hardscaping project at our house. While I know you've asked specifically about Four Dimensions, I wanted to respond to your question. We met with 3 people (from landscape architects to landscape contractors) and went with Matt Horn http://matthornlandscaping.com/. We are thrilled with the outcome. He completely transformed our space. He was able to get our vision (veggies, play space, eating space) and make use of all aspects and challenges of our yard without charging a lot for plans. Our lot is sloped and he problem solved the issues with us. He met with us often and was mindful of our budget constraints. His crew is kind and efficient as well. We highly recommend him and truly appreciate the space he has created.\n\nHi, I'm not familiar with Four Dimensions, but I do know a great landscaper: Pablo Cepero, of California Landscape Service. He does beautiful work and is super reliable and well priced. His number is 510.635.7017. Kathy\n\nI have known and worked with Michael Thilgen of Four Dimensions for many years and I highly recommend them! Michael is a great listener, extremely creative, budget conscious, and a local expert on Bay Area plants and ecology. I am sure you will be very happy with his work! Kathy Rogers, Architect\n\nI first heard of Michael Thilgen because of his work on Sausal Creek near our house. It turned out he was known for his work with native species, propagating many small plants wherever he could. Later, while working on a Kitchen Remodel in Rockridge, I had the opportunity to work with him. The project included a deck and a postage-stamp back yard. He was very responsive, and the project turned out really nice. Andus H Brandt, Architect\n\nLandscape architect to transform lawn into Japanese garden\n\nDec 2009\n\nHi there, My North Berkeley house is set back from the street with a garden in front; much of which is a water-guzzling lawn. I am looking for a landscape architect who could transform my lawn area into a Japanese garden, possibly with a small meditation area. Any new design would need to integrate with my existing fruit trees and flower beds. Many thanks, jamie\n\nRichard Larson in Piedmont is an outstanding Landscape architect! He's been in the business for more than 20 years & has done work on residential projects as well as large scale corporate projects. He's a great resource that I would highly recommend.

Judy\n\nA fantastic lanscaper is Brad Goya - SF Greenspaces, 415- 845-3596, sfgreenspaces [at] gmail.com. He does small yards, big yards, builds decks, fences, irrigations systems, lighting, stone and concrete work... Great designs with drought tolerant, native plants.

Elizabeth\n\nI highly recommend Sue Oda Landscape Architect she is highly experience and her portfolio is wonderful you will be really impress once you see it her number is (510) 684-8789 give her a call you will be glad you did. Mr. Martinez\n\nI highly recommend Sue Oda, Landscape Architect. She's very experienced in native and low maintainance garden design, as well as Japanese gardens. I'm sure she'll do a great job in creating a design that integrates with your existing plants and architecture, gives expression to your aesthetic vision, and enhances the curb appeal. As an architect, I've recommended her often. She's very attentive to the needs and wishes of the client, loves her work, and is a pleasure to work with. Her website is http://sueoda.com/, and phone is 510-684-8789. You can also call at 510-234-4088 Milton Tong Architect\n\nPamela Gleason www.pamelagleasondesign.com does beautiful garden designs. She's very knowledgeable about all aspects of landscaping and plants. She does whatever you want - in the way of just a discussion to throw up ideas, a plan, or following through a whole project, plus organizing maintenance. Fiona\n\nStephan Landau of Landau Landscapes (316-6691) is a great designer, should you decide you don't need the expense of an architect. He's got decades of experience and also installs hardscapes in stone and wood, water features, and ecological irrigation and water cachement systems. Stephan's done many Japanese-inspired, zen-like gardens, including a recent koi pond and waterfall, and has great taste. He knows how to integrate design with existing plantings and trees (like at my place and my hillside neighbor's). He truly blends form & function, aesthetics & ecology, listening & creating - all within a budget. Stephan's a real pleasure to work with and might be the right match for your project. Good luck. goldman\n\nLandscape designer needed in Rockridge\n\nAugust 2009\n\nHello. We are in need of a competent, dependable and reasonably priced service to help up landscape/maintain our garden and assist with the repair of (or perhaps installation of a new) an irrigation system. We're in the upper Rockridge area. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks! Fred\n\nWe recently had our backyard landscaped by McCaffery Brothers and had a very positive experience. Darren spent great time and effort writing up a detailed menu bid based on our needs. We live in the Berkeley Hills and had special problems with our shady, sloping back yard. Darren was able to come up with cost effective suggestions, always detailing exactly what his crew would do and what materials they would use. His bid was not the lowest one we received, but it was the most precise.\n\nWhen Darren and his crew did the work, the only surprises were good ones. The work they did was excellent and cost exactly what he promised it would. I heartily recommend them for any landscaping project.\n\nIn addition to being honest, skilled, knowlegable, and professional, Darren and his workers (some family and some long-time employees) were great to have around. They were very kind to my 2-year-old son, who became quite attached to them. My son started calling our yard ''Darren's back yard''. They were also considerate about noise during his nap times.\n\nI wish that everyone we had hired to work on our house had done as good a job as McCaffery Brothers. I encourage you to talk with them about your project. phone # 510-455-0724 Anne\n\nWant to dress up my deck and patio\n\nJuly 2009\n\nI have a deck and patio that are a blank canvas and I'd like help putting in place a nice ''look'' plants in pots, etc. I think it's less than a landscape designer, but someone who understands plants and placement and watering needs. And although I have a very modest budget I'd love to achieve a sunset / smith look ....any suggestions on with whom to work? Thanks for your recommendations!\n\nFrancisco Mayo (510-527-1355 or cell 510-207-4974) is a landscape designer with a wonderful aesthetic eye. He will understand your small space and will know what plants will work, what irrigation to use, etc. He is genuine and easy to work with. We have used him for several projects (big and small) and have always been pleased with the result. Good luck! -RK\n\nJames Bronson is a landscape designer who worked for me. He's very reasonably priced and does a very nice job. He's also very pleasant to work with. You can call James at 544-9729. David\n\nLandscape designer who listens!\n\nJuly 2009\n\nCan anyone recommend a good landscaper with vision at an affordable price. we want to re-do the area in the front of our house. Right now its full of weeds but I was thinking with the water conservation everywhere, that a nice rock design might look nice. Maybe a few drought resistant shrubs in the middle surround by black rock/bark/mulch. Nothing too complicated I've had bad experience with landscapers not doing completely what you asked for so I am looking forward to referrals from happy customers. Please advise if you have someone in mind. Hopefully i can take a look at their previous work. HELP!! es\n\nWe had a terrific experience with Lara at Bountiful Botanicals (415-290-6609) when we re-did our front yard earlier this year. She listened to what we wanted, incorporated all of our requests, and made terrific suggestions for things we would never have thought of. She and her crew have a great eye for aesthetics- what they designed and installed ended up even nicer than I could have imagined. They took care to preserve existing structures (walkways, brick) that we didn't want to have to re-do, which was a challenge since we were also installing irrigation and lighting. Lara was mindful of costs, and the project ended up coming in slightly under estimate. The final result was gorgeous- I truly enjoy coming home to my house every day. The crew was professional, and it was a pleasure working with them. I couldn't be happier with how it all turned out. Lauren\n\nI would highly recommend Jose Curiel and his crew for landscape projects. They did numerous jobs for us (and our neighbors) this spring. Jose did everything he told us he would do and then some. Everyone was reliable, friendly, flexible, competitively priced and everyone worked hard every single day. They never showed up late, and in fact, they were always early. I give Jose and his crew the highest possible recommendation. Jose can be reached at 510.821.4270. kw\n\nLandscape Architect to design our front stairs and yard\n\nJune 2009\n\nWe're looking for a Landscape Architect to design our front stairs and yard.

Does anyone have any recent deck and landscape architect recommendations? Thanks! judye\n\nInsideOut Design did an amazing job on our back yard. Gorgeous, unusual design for deck (curved, no less!) and hardscaping (decomposed granite with slate for paths; stone benches). Creative plant and tree selections. Penn Phillips, who heads up the landscape end of the design firm is easy to work with and very hands-on and accessible when the project is being completed. He remains a good resource to consult as our yard evolves. I highly recommend their firm for landscaping and architectural projects alike. Contact Penn Phillips of InsideOut Design at 510-655-7674. Jenny\n\nYou should contact Erin Conner ? she and her partner Anne started their own architecture and design firm several years ago after both working for well-known design firms in San Francisco. This project sounds like it is the exact kind of work they do; focusing on the connection between indoors and outdoors with an emphasis on maximizing living space in creative and cost effective ways. Both of them have extensive backgrounds in residential architecture and landscape architecture / horticulture so they are really good with projects that integrate both. They have designed some of the most creative decks and back yards that I have seen. We hired them to do some schematic design on a house remodel and they were wonderful to work with and affordable compared to others we interviewed. They do have a website ? www.tierneyconner.com - but you should call or email them to see more in-depth photos & projects ? their phone is 510-531-0540 or email erin [at] tierneyconner.com.

He's into basketball, skateboarding and baseball. We have a pretty small space...however, if properly utilized, could be much more conducive to what he wants to do. Currently, we have to go to the park for every activity. It'd be nice to have a space where he could go out right here at home. Thanks. Mom of Active Boy\n\nJose @ Maravilla Landscaping 510-381-0399,has been my go to guy for quite some time now. He is amazing. He's very reasonable and does exceptional work for the price.

A\n\nGreen Gallery Landscaping\n\nMay 2009\n\nIf anyone has worked with Nathan Parsley of Green Gallery Landscaping in Berkeley, I'd appreciate hearing about your experience. We're thinking of hiring him to do a rather extensive overhaul of our back yard, including a deck and patio. We're not working with an architect - we have a conceptual design but no specifications and will rely on him to work out the details - so I'm particularly interested to hear if you had a similar situation and if you're happy with the end result. thanks! anon\n\nGreen Gallery Landscaping does excellent work. Nathan Parsley has a great crew of guys that work for him. They come on time and get the job done in a timely fashion. We had them do a few jobs for us over the years and have always been happy. I also have friends how have worked with Nathan and been quite pleased. He has a complete understanding of landscaping and plants and knows how to get the job done. You'll be happy with your results using Green Gallery Landscaping. marie\n\nLandscape designer/contractor for small garden walkway\n\nMarch 2009\n\nI would like to take out some parts of our backyard lawn and make it into a walkway to save water and to give my three year old an area where he can ride his tricycle. We have a well established garden with plants so the project will be small, just the walkway. I haven't decided whether to do natural stone or gravel (recommendation welcome!) I am hoping to find someone who doesn't mind small projects, has a good design capability so that the walkway will be integrated smoothly into our existing landscape, and can install at reasonable cost. I read past posts but most of the recommendation seemed to be for larger projects. We are located in Orinda. Thank you! shiho\n\nYou should call Tamar Carson Landscaping. I started with her for a small project and have since used her and her company to redo all of my yards. She and her husband are a great team, reasonably priced and very detail oriented. They also know how to stick to a budget. I was really really happy with her and have recommended her to a lot of people who are also happy. Kim\n\nLandscape design for major yard re-do\n\nFeb 2009\n\nI am planning to re-landscape my large yard in North Berkeley, and am more than a little overwhelmed with all the choices presented here. Can anybody help me narrow it down by recommending a local, personable contractor who is reliable, skilled, and reasonable? My project involves tree work, lots of carpentry, hot tub installation, some stonework, planting, irrigation, etc. Thanks, Renee\n\nWe LOVED our work with McCaffrey Brothers last summer. They re- designed and re-planted our backyard...including dealing with a lot of bamboo, building a fence, putting in a watering system, replacing stairs, facing a retaining wall and more. The folks are GREAT to work with and their prices were favorable compared to 2 other bids we got. Nikki\n\nI would definitely suggest you call Matt Horn for Landscaping. He helped us plan and design our front and backyard, demo an old brick patio and an overgrown jungle, level out an uneven slope, install a drip system, build a beautiful fence and arbor, and put in a large flagstone patio. He and his crew were always polite, neat, and friendly and showed up everyday, in spite of some pretty horrible weather. Matt is a great guy and although his bid wasn't the lowest, it was reasonable, and you get what you pay for. His number is 510-658-6088 or matthornlandscaping [at] mac.com. sarah\n\nYou need Matt Horn Landscaping! We had Matt and his team do our front, side and back yards last summer. We had lots of rock and overgrown, leggy plantings that just weren't working for us. Now we have a beautiful flagstone patio with pathways throughout our yards, gorgeous fencing (that our neighbors like as well -- nice on both sides), wonderful arbors and raised-bed planting boxes, not to mention the amazing plantings throughout! We were able to save what we wanted and Matt welcomed our participation--as much as we desired--to pick out and place the plants. He installed a small lawn for us with pop-up sprinklers and drip irrigation throughout. He's also an arborist and really helped bring in light on one side of our yard that is dark due to a neighbor's huge tree. With our neighbor's permission, Matt trimmed their tree nicely for both of us. He transplanted a tree we wanted to keep and gave us great guidance on all the plantings. Matt and his team were also wonderful to work with. The project lasted exactly the estimated amount of time and on budget. His crew left everything clean and tidy at the end of each day and were great with my toddler, who napped through their work every afternoon. Matt moved to Berkeley last summer from Marin, so he's local. Our lot if fairly small, but with all the demo required, ours was not exactly a small job. I know he has worked on much larger yards as well. I can't recommend him highly enough. You can reach Matt at 510.658.6088 or matthornlandscaping [at] mac.com. Good luck! Tamara\n\nJan 2009\n\nI strongly recommend Bountiful Botanicals. They recently designed and installed an amazing garden for our Oakland residence. Lara, the owner, was so helpful and really listened to what we wanted. The garden came out better than we had expected, and on a smaller budget than anticipated. The crew that worked at our home was respectful and cleaned up everyday before they left. Their attention to detail was amazing. I wish all contractors could stay on schedule and budget like this. We also hired them to maintain the garden going forward since so much care was given to it from the start. You can call or email Lara with any questions. lara [at] bountifulbotanicals.com or 415-290-6609 Betsy\n\n2007 - 2008 Recommendations\n\nLandscape architect/designer for tiny backyard\n\nOct 2008\n\nWe're ready to give up our tiny patch of (now dry) grass that has passed as a backyard. We'd like professional help (landscape architect or designer?) in creating a primarily hardscape design that is appropriate to our home, our soil (yes, it's clay), our lot, and community. Any suggestions? Looking forward to being outdoors\n\nHello, I would like to recommend Jose Maravilla (510) 381- 0399. He's fabulous, he will work with you to create a beautiful and functional backyard. He has been my go to guy for a few years now. He is knowledgeable in masonry work as well as irrigation, decking and more! He's also very reasonably priced. I am sure you won't be disappointed with his work. Best of luck! Aurora\n\nTry Sharon Silverman, proprietor of Dans le Jardin; 510.851.2203;Kensington. She is in the business of designing, building, and maintaining gardens, (in conjunction with a network of skilled experts). I have not used her services, yet a group of ladies met in her garden to tour her work and learn how she approaches her business. She is a gracious hostess, maintains a beautiful garden and enthusiastically/competently addressed our gardening questions. karen\n\nI know someone who does beautiful natural stone work -- laying flagstone patios, walkways, retaining walls, etc., along with designing the whole space, including all the planting. He's done work for two friends of mine, and transformed their yards, and has done some lovely stone tree surrounds for my sidewalk. He's really an artist with a great eye for design, as well as a skilled craftsman. He can work wonders with a dead, weedy back yard! His name is Robert -- his business email is urbanoasissf [at] yahoo.com. Mary\n\nAs has been posted to similiar questions, Bay Area Stone Gardens (Bill Armijo is the owner) has done some beautiful work in the East Bay. Check out www.bayareastonegardens.com for before and after photos as well as contact info. He is very easy to work with and has a keen sense of detail. He walks you through the process, takes you on stone tours and lays out everything so it is easy to understand. Happy Customer\n\nYou can contact Tomi Kobara, a licensed landscape architect in Oakland. Her new website is under construction (www.tomi-kobara.com) so it's best to phone her at (510) 420-1197. (She was also featured in Sunset magazine last summer). She specializes in residential landscaping -- she works closely with you to determine what works best for your family. Her work is beautiful, ecologically sensitive, and she is also a very lovely person. My friends have all been really happy with the work she's done. Karen\n\nI can highly recommend the Bluhon Planning Group (contact Peter Bluhon, 510- 841-3255). We hired Peter to implement a design plan for our front yard. He did an amazing job! He was able to evaluate the plans with a critical eye, suggesting changes to create a more functional and beautiful space. He approached each decision with great thought, care and precision. Peter has a great vision for overall site planning, materials and plants. He also took into account the budget we were working with. Our project included hardscape (stone steps and walkway, cement driveway, stucco), planting and irrigation. His group of workers were highly skilled and hardworking. We will be using Peter's full range of talents, design and build, to landscape our backyard. Peter is a perfectionist, whi"
