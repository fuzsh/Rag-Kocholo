They had two daughters, Molly and Lilly-Sue. However, Brian McFadden split from Kerry Katona and later got together with Delta Goodrem. Brian McFadden later married and divorced Vogue Williams.\n\nIn March 2004 Brian McFadden announced he was leaving Westlife. It was around this time, that he acknowledges he was at a low. He told The Guardian: \"Westlife was collapsing, my marriage with Kerry was on the rocks, and then I went out and smashed my car into the wall. That afternoon I wrote a song called Walking Disaster, and I can safely say that it will never get any lower than that. But everything happens for a reason.\"\n\nSolo Career\n\nBrian McFadden's first solo single, Real To Me got to No. 1 in the British singles chart. According to the BBC, McFadden said: \"I feel like Coventry City have won the FA Cup.\"\n\nMcFadden's debut album was Irish Son.\n\nFrom the aforementioned Guardian article, Leaving the West Behind, there are some Brian McFadden facts: First record bought was I Should Be So Lucky by Kylie Minogue; Favourite film is Tin Cup; Album to grab in an emergency is Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys; Inspiration is Brian Wilson and Recent discovery was Grace by Jeff Buckley.\n\nTelevision Appearances\n\nIn 2010 Brian McFadden became a judge on Australia's Got Talent alongside Kyle Sandilands and Dannii Minogue.\n\nIn 2013, Brian McFadden and his wife Vogue Williams appeared on ITV's dance reality TV show, Stepping Out.\n\nIn 2015, they divorced but remained close.\n\nIn 2016, McFadden became one of the celebrities on Channel Four's the Jump.\n\nBefore The Jump, he was asked about whether he could ski and replied:\n\n\"I can ski at a very beginner level; I’ve been a couple of times. What I learnt though I learnt very fast so I’m a quick learner when it comes to skiing.\"\n\nMcFadden ended up being the fourth celebrity to be eliminated from The Jump.\n\nHe was lined up to be one of the celebrities on Dancing on Ice in 2019. He was partnered with Alex Murphy.\n\nThey came fourth, just missing out on the final.\n\nBack to Top"
