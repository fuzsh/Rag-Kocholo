        "text": "BRIAN McFadden shocked the pop world when he dramatically left Westlife in 2004.\n\nHe then went on to carve out a career as a solo artist, talent show judge and TV host, and he recently starred in this year's series of Dancing on Ice.\n\nWho is Brian McFadden dating?\n\nBrian is dating a high school PE teacher who works in Rochdale - a far cry from the famous exes he's settled down with before.\n\nThe Dancing On Ice star has been with Danielle Parkinson, a one time Olympic athlete hopeful and teacher, since 2016.\n\nDanielle was introduced to the singer by crooner Cole Paige.\n\nDanielle, who lives in Heywood, Lancs, used to compete in the heptathlon for Rochdale Harriers at Under 21 level and dreamed to making the Olympics as a teenager.\n\nHowever she ended up teaching PE at Matthew Moss High School in Rochdale, where she is said to be popular with the pupils.\n\nA pal in the camp said: “Danielle was a fanatical athlete in her teens and entered loads of regional competitions and people really thought she would actually make the GB Olympic squad – but sadly it never happened.\n\n“She is happy at her PE job right now and has kept the relationship with Brian McFadden fairly quiet.\n\n“It will become high profile no doubt when he starts his Boyzlife tour and he is in the news again – and to be honest the two of them are a happy item.\"\n\nThings are so serious between them that Brian has even moved to Rochdale to be closer to Danielle.\n\nHow did Brian injure his shoulder on Dancing On Ice?\n\nBrian partially dislocated his shoulder during rehearsals on Saturday, January 12.\n\nHis accident followed another nasty fall during rehearsals, which was exclusively revealed by The Sun Online.\n\nThe 38-year-old was left feeling \"anxious\" on the ice after taking a tumble.\n\nHis professional skating partner, Alex Murphy, told The Sun Online: \"We had a fall, it was pretty bad.\n\n\"He was really anxious after that but I told him not to worry and hopefully it's out of his system.\"\n\nHow did Brian do in Dancing On Ice?\n\nAs tough as rehearsals were following his injuries, Brian soldiered on.\n\nIt was feared that he would have to pull out of the competition due to his shoulder, however, medical experts deemed him fit enough to carry on - which he did.\n\nHe was the ninth celebrity contestant booted off the show in the semi-finals.\n\nWhy did Brian McFadden quit Westlife?\n\nAs a member of the Irish five-piece band Westlife - alongside Shane Filan, Nicky Byrne, Mark Feehily and Kian Egan - Brian experienced huge chart success.\n\nThe group made history when their first seven singles hit number one and they were at the height of their fame when Brian shocked everyone by quitting in 2004.\n\nAt the time he blamed his departure on struggling to juggle the band's hectic, jet-setting lifestyle with his responsibilities as a husband and father to then-wife Kerry Katona and their young daughters, Molly and Lilly-Sue.\n\n\"It was incredible, amazing, but during the seven years in the band, we worked 365 days a year, living on planes, in hotels and out of suitcases, and never being in the same country for two days,\" he told the Belfast Telegraph.\n\n\"After a while, you realise there's no point in being successful if you can't enjoy it, share it with someone else or be with the people you care about.\"\n\nHe was not part of the Westlife reunion in 2018 after the band turned down a €50m offer to reunite with their original line up.\n\nIn January 2018, it was revealed Westlife had snubbed Brian all over again as they confirmed there’s \"no longer space\" for him in the band.\n\nWhat did Brian McFadden do after Westlife?\n\nBrian signed a solo recording deal and in 2004 he released his debut album, Irish Son, which featured the number one smash Real To Me.\n\nHe also moved to Australia in 2004 and enjoyed success Down Under as a TV and radio presenter and talent show judge, while writing his own albums and penning tracks for other artists.\n\nHe joined the judging panel for three series of Australia's Got Talent from 2010-2013 and presented an Australian radio show.\n\nReturning to the UK, he participated in TV shows including Stepping Out with then-wife Vogue Williams and Channel 4 extreme sports show, The Jump.\n\nHe's also hosted the TV series Who's Doing The Dishes and a dating series called Stand By Your Man.\n\nThroughout his career so far, he's released four studio albums, most recently The Irish Connection in 2013, which featured ten cover versions of popular songs by Irish artists and a collaboration with Ronan Keating.\n\nFour of his solo singles have hit number one around the world.\n\nIn 2016 Brian teamed up with ex Boyzone singer Keith Duffy to create the duo Boyzlife.\n\nWho is Brian McFadden and what's his background?\n\nBrian Nicholas McFadden is 38 years old.\n\nHe was born on April 12, 1980, in Dublin, Ireland, and got his first taste of performing at an early age thanks to roles in local stage productions and an Irish TV show called Finbar's Class.\n\nAs a teenager, he worked at McDonald's on Friday evenings and it was after one such shift, when he joined his friends at a party, that Brian found out auditions for a new Irish boyband to be managed by Louis Walsh were taking place the following day.\n\nNot expecting anything to come from it, Brian turned up at the auditions the next day and boldly volunteered to sing first.\n\nThe future pop star performed the Boyzone track Picture of You and secured his place in the band.\n\nHe joked in an interview with The Mail on Sunday: \"I sometimes wonder how far up the career ladder I'd have gone if I'd stayed with McDonald's. With a bit of luck, I reckon I might have made it as far as restaurant manager!\"\n\nWhat is Brian McFadden's net worth?\n\nAccording to Spear's magazine, the pop star's net worth is estimated at around £12million.\n\nThe mag cites his huge success with Westlife - who had four Irish studio album number ones and seventeen Irish top five singles - and subsequent solo career success in Ireland and Australia, as well as his various TV projects.\n\nHe's also penned tracks for other artists including Girls Aloud.\n\nIn 2013, Brian told Weekend magazine he regretted \"wasting so much of the money I earned from Westlife. I went through millions of pounds on cars, private jets and lots of rubbish. I have a lot less money now, but I'm far happier.\"\n\nWhen was Brian McFadden married to Kerry Katona and Vogue Williams?\n\nBrian married his first wife, Atomic Kitten founding member Kerry Katona, in County Meath, Ireland in 2002.\n\nThey had two children together: Molly, now 17, and Lilly-Sue, now 15.\n\nWhen he quit Westlife, he said it was to spend more time with Kerry and the kids, but just two years after tying the knot, in 2004, they announced their split.\n\nBrian then moved to Australia and began romancing another pop star, former Neighbours actress Delta Goodrem.\n\nHe popped the question to Delta in 2007 but they called off their relationship four years later, with Brian calling Delta \"one of God's living angels\" and thanking for \"for giving me the best years of my life\".\n\nBrian went on to find love again with Irish model and DJ Vogue Williams after they met a charity event in Dublin in 2011.\n\nThey married in 2012 at a lavish Tuscan ceremony but just three years later, the couple announced their split on Twitter.\n\nWhen is Dancing On Ice 2019 on TV?\n\nDancing On Ice 2019 returned to ITV in January, and the final airs TOMORROW (March 10) at 6pm.\n\nPhillip Schofield is back to present the hit show once more alongside Holly Willoughby, who revealed the news of the show's return live on This Morning in late January.\n\nSkating icons and current judges Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean returned as judges, alongside Jason Gardiner and Ashley Banjo."
