As Captain John B. Knights remarked in 1833, if a friend expressed “a desire, to view, human nature, in its most disgusting colours, pass a considerable portion, of his own life, in intense anxiety, subsist entirely on oily pork, and yams, without, a shadow of pleasure, to cheer his dull hours,” Knights would say to him, “‘Go! my friend Go! a Fegee voyage.’”2 But if Fiji was so horrible, why did Americans go there? Several thousand of them voyaged to Fiji on merchant, whaling, and naval vessels in the decades before British colonization of the islands in 1874. And more than a hundred Americans lived and died there. From a macro perspective, explaining the American presence in Fiji seems simple. Their rationale was economic: Americans went to Fiji to extract resources to sell in China. In 1804, a castaway American sailor broke the news that the aromatic sandalwood tree grew plentifully on Vanua Levu, Fiji’s second-largest island. American and British ships rushed to harvest this commodity highly valued by the Chinese as incense. A second boom\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\ntargeting the sea slug bêche-de-mer, a food delicacy esteemed in Chinese cuisine, flourished a generation later and attracted another wave of traders to the islands, this time almost entirely from Salem, Massachusetts. Thus Fiji became one leg in the U.S.-China trade and a source of great wealth for the American merchants who gambled their fortunes on it.3 Zoom in closer, and it becomes apparent that the foot soldiers of early U.S. global expansion, the individual Americans who ventured overseas, did so for more complicated reasons. They were not mere cogs in a U.S. foreign relations history that treats big-picture abstractions—capitalism, resource extraction, or imperialism—as the motor. Rather, an assortment of personal ambitions impelled Americans to travel to distant locales. Their motivations, albeit multiple and divergent, often derived from a desire to be respected by others and thereby attain a sense of self-worth, or so I propose in this book. Their strivings to rise in others’ estimation influenced the course of Fiji’s history and, albeit more subtly, the history of the United States. To study this phenomenon up close, I delve into the Fiji experiences of the three Americans who left the deepest imprint on the islands’ history: Fiji’s most respected foreign resident, David Whippy, a runaway Nantucket whaleman and beachcomber (the term used in Pacific studies for foreigners who settled in Oceania); sea captain’s wife Mary D. Wallis, author of Life in Feejee: Five Years Among the Cannibals, By a Lady (1851), an essential source for nineteenth-century Fiji history; and Salem merchant John B. Williams, whose greed is often cited as a factor in Britain’s accession of the islands.4 In three sections, with two chapters devoted to each person, I explore the different paths they took to earn others’ respect and the larger consequences of their activities on two places half a world apart. Differing in their social backgrounds, personalities, and objectives, these three individuals otherwise had characteristics in common. They came from Massachusetts port towns and identified as American, even the expatriate Whippy. They had a stake in the extractive economy, which altered local environments and transformed Fiji’s material culture by introducing muskets, gunpowder, metal tools, and machine-woven cloth. They meddled in internecine affairs by siding with one of Fiji’s multiple polities in wars against another, and though forced to ally with Fijians to further their own ends, they wished to see Fijians reduced to tractability. Their persistent belittling of Fijians as the world’s most savage people helped push Fijians to abandon various traditions and accept Christianity, monogamy, and other foreign practices in their stead. In short, all three whittled away at Fiji’s economic,\n\nWhy Go a Fiji Voyage?\n\n3\n\npolitical, and cultural autonomy and thereby opened up the archipelago to further foreign encroachment. These three Americans figure large in histories of nineteenth-century Fiji. But their collective story falls outside the usual scope of American history and the paradigms prevailing among historians at this moment: this book is not about empire, borderlands, or settler colonialism. It may look like empire to those historians who use that word to signal expansionist power, but I prefer limiting empire to mean formal, administrative control over a stretch of territory.5 By that definition, there never was a U.S. empire in Fiji. During the peak years of American activity in the islands, the 1800s through the 1850s, Americans ceded deference to Fiji’s power structure. Infiltrating Fijian polities in a piecemeal fashion—along with the British, Tongans, and to a lesser extent the French—Americans exerted influence from within until, made vulnerable by the multitude of forces angling for supremacy, Fiji ultimately fell to British subjugation and became part of the British Empire. For the same reason, Fiji cannot be considered an American borderland. Popularized by Greg Dening’s Islands and Beaches, a history of Europeannative encounters at the Marquesas (on the other side of the South Pacific from Fiji), and Richard White’s The Middle Ground, which deals with Europeannative encounters in the Great Lakes region, a borderlands approach imagines people meeting at the edges of sovereign territories or at places in between that no one polity controls. However, casting parts of the American West or the Pacific as European borderlands risks denying natives sovereignty over land and sea.6 The cross-cultural exchanges and political contestations mediating encounters between Americans and Fijians might resemble what Dening described for the Marquesas or White for the Great Lakes, but Fijians had the upper hand in Fiji at least into the 1850s, when they began to lose political control over parts of the archipelago to Tongans, and later to the British. As for settler colonial theory, in a short essay published in 2016, “A Typology of Colonialism,” I addressed my concerns about how it has become dogma in indigenous studies and shut out other lines of inquiry. Settler colonial theory sheds light on the egregious dispossession and depopulation of native peoples as European settlers became the majority. It has little to say about Fiji, where today about 85 percent of the land is deemed “Native Land” and remains in possession of ethnic Fijians (“Itaukei”), who make up over half the islands’ population. The second-largest demographic group\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nconsists of ethnic Indians, descendants of plantation workers imported by the British.7 If colonialism is defined as interference by outsiders, Fiji experienced colonialism, just not settler colonialism. In “A Typology of Colonialism,” I sketch out twelve forms of colonialism differentiated by colonizers’ intentions: settler, planter, extractive, imperial power, trade, transport, legal, missionary, romantic, rogue, not-in-my-backyard, and postcolonial. Many of these forms of colonialism swept through Fiji at some point in the country’s history. The first major foreign intervention occurred with the extractive colonialism of the sandalwood and bêche-de-mer trades: over five decades, about one hundred trading vessels, most of them American, spent months, sometimes years, in Fiji harvesting natural resources.8 Missionary colonialism began in the 1830s with the founding of the English Wesleyan Methodist mission.9 In the 1850s, Tongans from the neighboring archipelago to the east invaded in a bid to aggrandize Tonga’s domains and sphere of influence, which I categorize as imperial power colonialism.10 Planter colonialism took hold in the 1860s when the collapse of cotton markets during the U.S. Civil War brought aspiring planters, mostly British, to the islands.11 Fiji remained a planter colony after British annexation, when sugar replaced cotton as the islands’ leading export.12 Transport colonialism also shaped Fiji’s history, first whale ships, then steamships, then airplanes, all needing replenishment of food or fuel.13 Fijian independence in 1970 initiated postcolonial colonialism as the British legacy continued to inform Fiji’s fraught politics, race relations, and international allegiances.14 Finally, even though Fiji is an independent nation today, tourism, or romantic colonialism, has become the mainstay of the islands’ economy and a force for change as Fijians adapt to meet outsiders’ desires.15 If the only framework we had was settler colonialism, there would be no way to comprehend the large-scale changes in Fiji brought about by an assemblage of adverse foreign intentions. If this book is not about empire, borderlands, or settler colonialism, then what is it about? It is one example, perhaps the most extreme example, of the vast global reach of the United States in the first half of the nineteenth century. From the nation’s origins, Americans could be found nearly everywhere. Some lived overseas. Most just worked there. The usual term for such people is Americans Abroad, but that is so insipid a phrase, I prefer extending the legal term extraterritorial. I elaborate on the extraterritorial United States as a “non-territorial yet still national space constituted by mobile Americans” in a 2018 essay in the journal Diplomatic History. This article compares five of the most common vectors drawing nineteenth-century Americans outside\n\nWhy Go a Fiji Voyage?\n\n5\n\nthe country—the China trade, whaling, missionizing, the consular service, and the navy—and illustrates how early U.S. foreign relations bubbled up from the bottom. Extraterritorial Americans’ varied initiatives gave global expansion its momentum, and the federal government enlarged its overseas presence and authority to meet their needs.16 The extraterritorial United States deserves more notice as a place where American history happened. Two impulses explain why it has been understudied. First, a territorial bias leads us to favor events occurring inside the nation’s current borders. Many histories of the United States in the world represent the nineteenth century as a period of continental consolidation and mark U.S. entrance onto the world stage with the territorial acquisitions of Hawai‘i, Guam, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico in 1898.17 Multiple history books deal with the massacres of Native Americans at Sand Creek in 1864 and Wounded Knee in 1890, yet there is no book, not even a single research article, on the massacre at Malolo (see figure I.1), where in 1840 the U.S. Navy went on a rampage, slaughtering about one hundred men, women, and children, destroying their houses, planting fields, and fruit-bearing trees.18\n\nFigure I.1.

Agate, one of the artists employed by the U.S. Exploring Expedition, made this drawing of the expedition’s July 1840 assault on Malolo, which resulted in the deaths of about one hundred Fijians.

Instead of conceptualizing global expansion as westward expansion’s successor, more historians are pointing out their concurrence and symmetry. In the American West and the Pacific, the same tactics—a discourse of native savagery, extortion, violence, the application of Euroamerican legal traditions, and a sense of entitlement—characterized Americans’ economic and political engagements.19 This similitude between westward and Pacific expansion does not mean that they were identical processes. Without articulating why, the nation’s leaders delegated continental and overseas regulatory responsibility to different branches of the federal bureaucracy. The army defended Americans from Indians; the navy defended Americans from Pacific Islanders. In 1824, the War Department created the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which in 1849 moved to the Department of the Interior; the State Department managed the problems posed by U.S. nationals, including American Indians, who traveled, lived, or worked abroad. Most important, land acquisition and settlement predominated on the continent whereas few Americans overseas planned to settle there permanently. The majority were employed at some other endeavor—resource extraction, commerce, or proselytization—that did not aim at the acquisition of territory for settlement but nonetheless bore heavily on indigenous people.20 The second reason why the extraterritorial United States rarely makes it into the history books is because U.S. foreign relations history has in the past been told more from the top down than from the bottom up. This, too, is now changing as more foreign relations scholars look for protagonists beyond the small cadre of high-level officials headquartered in Washington, D.C. As actors in U.S. foreign relations history, ordinary Americans are sometimes called “non-state actors.” This is misleading, however, since they were as embedded in the state as their elected and appointed leaders.21 This is especially evident in the early American period, when extraterritorial Americans constituted the vanguard of U.S. global expansion. Their activities greatly benefited the nation as a whole. Most tangibly, the federal government depended on commercial shipping for its operating funds. By 1833, the U.S. Treasury had taken in $624 million in customs duties, more than ten times the second-largest source of federal income, the $45 million gleaned from the sale of lands previously in Indian possession.22 One shipowner involved in Fiji’s bêche-de-mer trade, Salem merchant Joseph Peabody,\n\nWhy Go a Fiji Voyage?\n\n7\n\nwas credited at his death with having paid a remarkable $1.8 million in customs duties to the federal treasury in the period from 1825 to 1833. How much Fiji by itself contributed to the U.S. economy would be impossible to calculate. But it can safely be said that Peabody was not the only merchant magnate who made money in Fiji and brought those profits home.23 Capital acquired abroad financed westward expansion and domestic improvements as merchants active in global commerce invested in banks, insurance companies, railroads, and textile mills.24 Extraterritoriality’s rewards also trickled down to consumers. Luxury imports and produce extracted from the sea and tropics enriched the daily lives of stay-at-homes.25 And a prolific literature detailing the strange customs of distant lands based on extraterritorial Americans’ firsthand observations allowed Americans at home to imagine themselves as a distinct and superior people.26 Fiji similarly had a role in the political evolution of the United States. The U.S. government oversaw extraterritorial space with a growing and at times heavy-handed infrastructure of consuls, diplomats, and naval forces. These government agents acted under the obligation to protect Americans who ventured outside the nation’s borders. American shipping in the Pacific, especially the whaling industry and China trade, made that region a special concern. In 1821, the government commissioned the Pacific Squadron, a naval fleet stationed off Chile, and charged it with periodically touring hotspot archipelagos where Americans had gotten into trouble. From 1838 to 1842, the United States Exploring Expedition, or Ex Ex, plied Pacific waters to chart reefs, shoals, and safe harbors. It spent three months in Fiji in 1840 conducting the first extensive survey of the islands. Six years later, anticipating the British by more than ten years, the U.S. government, at merchant Williams’s request, appointed him its consular representative in Fiji. Every few years thereafter, U.S. warships visited the islands to redress a proliferating litany of American grievances against Fijians.27 As one British writer put it, “In those days the American Eagle ‘screeched considerable’ throughout the Great South Sea and enforced the demands of its subjects almost indiscriminately.”28 The value of extraterritoriality and the government protection afforded extraterritorial Americans pushed the United States to enlarge its global scope and power. With extraterritorial Americans as the motor, it can be difficult to make sense of how U.S. foreign relations worked in the early American period. It looks like an uncoordinated mess of individuated ambitions. In the contentious politics of nineteenth-century Fiji, for example, Americans often took\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nopposite sides and aligned with like-minded people regardless of national affiliation: Whippy with other beachcombers, Wallis with the English missionaries, and Williams with whoever was expedient. Even though they set about realizing their objectives through different means, this concatenation of divergent intentions cumulatively advanced American expansion overseas, albeit in uneven, often contradictory, ways. Their underlying motivations were self-serving, not because they were inordinately selfish but because they were human. Other studies in U.S. foreign relations history and in the history of the Pacific offer parallel observations. Frank Costigliola, my colleague at the University of Connecticut, has highlighted emotions as factors in the foreign policy of Franklin Roosevelt, George Kennan, and other American officials.29 If the inner selves of twentieth-century politicians and diplomats impinged on policymakers’ decisions, as Costigliola delineates, then the same could be assumed for early nineteenth-century foreign relations when extraterritorial Americans spearheaded expansion from the bottom up. Personal emotions shaped British expansion into the Pacific as well, according to literary scholar Jonathan Lamb. In Preserving the Self in the South Seas, he delved into the mental worlds of familiar figures usually depicted as rational, confident, and decisive. Captain James Cook and other European explorers of the Pacific, Lamb contends, were instead anxious, confused, and prone to spontaneous fits of unruly passions.30 In the case of Whippy, Wallis, and Williams, the aspect of their inner selves most conspicuous in their words and deeds is how they sought others’ respect. Respect has yet to be recognized as a causal factor in historical change. The closest historiography is on respectability, which is typically cast as an obsession of the middle classes, as in studies about consumption and politeness in Britain and the United States or about the “politics of respectability” among African Americans. In this literature, respectability invokes a host of cultural ideals related to taste, manners, and virtue. Believing oneself to be a respectable person or trying to pass as a respectable person required self-regulation of public behavior while offering individuals in return a language for asserting moral authority and a higher social status.31 I see respect as serving a similar social function but without the class connotations. The term resists concrete definition because it is an intangible human striving lacking uniform, stable criteria. Being respected means that one has others’ approval, admiration, or deference. But the traits making someone worthy of others’ respect vary across time, space, culture, personality, and context.\n\nWhy Go a Fiji Voyage?\n\n9\n\nIf the pursuit of respect is fundamental to the human psyche, the Americans in Fiji could be considered unexceptional. Yet, they were a bit peculiar since their ambitions took them to the geographic and cultural antipodes. One would expect Fiji’s dangers, deprivations, and cannibal notoriety to keep outsiders away. Instead, Fiji offered Americans a unique platform to express social superiority. Hobnobbing with cannibals, people in American society deemed undeserving of others’ respect, could have made self-enhancement seem easy. On the issue of cannibalism, scholars have disagreed strenuously as to whether any society has ever condoned it. Fiji features prominently in this debate. Some writers take the view that descriptions of cannibalism in historic records are mere “cannibal talk,” European fabrications intended to dehumanize natives. Other writers, cultural relativists, point to the preponderance of evidence showing that Fijians conceived of cannibalism as “a perfectly normal social institution” and that to argue otherwise privileges European morality as a universal standard.32 This narrowly conceived debate ignores the many other Fijian customs foreigners castigated and ridiculed— widow strangling, euthanistic burials of the sick and elderly, and elaborate hairstyles—to compose a tableau of savagery against which to assert precedence.33 Yet, more than any other Fijian custom, cannibalism constituted the idea of civilization as its antithesis. Sensationalist accounts of Fijian cannibalism sanctified economic exploitation and military interventions while buttressing Americans’ self-identification as civilized people. After the Malolo massacre, Ex Ex midshipman William Reynolds likened the expedition’s three months in the islands to “some hideous dream”: “Ye who read or hear of Cannibals in your quiet Homes can have but a faint idea of the absolute & nervous horror & the loathsome disgust that oppresses one who has been among them & witnessed the foul traits that place them below the beasts.”34 Reynolds saw no cannibalism while in Fiji, yet the specter of it afforded him a foil against which to measure himself and his compatriots so as to come out on top. Such stigmatizations of Fijian culture barred Americans in Fiji from pondering the moral implications of their actions, since the absolute savagery of Fijians legitimated whatever Americans did there. Civilization, like respect, was a system of social one-upmanship, a means to assess people’s value and to determine whether they were better or worse than other people. But the ideology of civilization starkly distinguished good from bad whereas respect was more ambiguous and contestable. Who among the civilized most deserved others’ respect and why? Antebellum\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nAmericans could not agree. They saturated their speech and writings with “respect” and “respected” as though the meaning of these words was patently obvious to all, but they never specified exactly what conditions or behaviors would guarantee others’ respect. As Americans, along with the British and French, coalesced around a collective identity as civilized people in opposition to Fijians, the pursuit of respect enmeshed them in a hornet’s nest of animosity, backbiting, and recrimination. The key figure and lens through which to see the consequences of their jostling for self-esteem is Cakobau, ruler of Bau at midcentury and the most powerful person in precolonial Fiji. One of many independent polities making up the Fijian archipelago before unification under British colonization, Bau began its rise to power at the start of the nineteenth century by gaining an advantage in the sandalwood trade. In 1845, the English missionary John Hunt estimated that Bau had only 15,000 of the islands’ 300,000 people under its authority, yet it was revered and feared throughout the Fiji group. Cakobau’s aggrandizement of his domains through military conquest and strategic alliances made him the “Napoleon of Feejee.”35 Under Cakobau’s leadership, Fiji seemed on the verge of consolidating into a kingdom as King Kamehameha I had accomplished at Hawai‘i, the Pomare dynasty at Tahiti, and King George Tupou I at Tonga.36 Then, in the 1850s, amid a crescendo of warfare, resistance from his people at the imposition of new labor demands, and convoluted political realignments that involved Whippy, Wallis, Williams, the English missionaries, and the Tongans King George and Ma‘afu as major players, Cakobau’s ascendancy faltered. For years, he had defended Fijian customs. To abandon tradition would entail losing the respect of other Fijians. But foreigners despised cannibalism and widow strangling, and the pressures to accept what these foreigners called “civilization” mounted. To save his crumbling empire, he became Christian and outlawed polygamy, widow strangling, and cannibalism.37 Cakobau also wished for respect, but to preserve his status and authority, he had to adjust to new criteria introduced by outsiders. Before turning to the microhistories of Whippy, Wallis, and Williams, I set the stage with an overview of the sandalwood and bêche-de-mer trades, which brought the majority of Americans to Fiji and through which much of the earliest information about Fiji spread to the rest of the world. To assist readers in keeping track of the many foreign vessels visiting Fiji, I provide three appendixes listing the voyages of sandalwood traders (A), bêche-demer traders (B), and foreign naval vessels prior to 1860 (C). In accord with\n\nWhy Go a Fiji Voyage?\n\n11\n\nhow later chapters focus on individuals and one form of respect, the first chapter uses as focal points two Salem sea captains, William P. Richardson and Benjamin Vanderford, with knowledge as the avenue by which they pursued others’ respect. Overtly, Richardson and Vanderford came to Fiji to make money by extracting the islands’ natural resources, but simultaneously, possession of a rare and specialized knowledge offered them the means to elevate their social status. Other Americans in Fiji also deployed knowledge as a way to gain respect. The remaining chapters are organized in approximate chronological order but also overlap since these three Americans knew each other well and participated in some of the same events. Chapter 2 recounts how Whippy initially accommodated to Fijian customs to earn respect vakaviti (according to Fijian ways). Certain Fijian customs he derided, however, and tried to change. Chapter 3 is about Whippy’s turn away from dependence on Fijians as he engineered the emergence of an independent foreign community. Increasingly, he sought the regard of other foreigners and made himself the helpmate of missionaries, traders, and naval commanders. His knowledge of Fiji now satisfied their needs, and they commended him for his usefulness and good character, ironically so since he lived in polygamy with a large family of half-Fijian children. Chapter 4 analyzes Life in Feejee to illustrate how Wallis challenged the double standard of gendered respectability in her own society by claiming the credentials to speak about Fijians’ moral inequities. Chapter 5 documents how her comfortable middle-class status sprung from the forced labor of Fijians, which became increasingly oppressive with the rise of foreign trade and from which all Americans in Fiji benefited. Chapter 6 details Williams’s frustrated efforts to live up to the legacy of Salem’s mercantile culture. Even though he failed to acquire other Salemites’ respect for his business acumen, he achieved a different kind of respect by marshaling U.S. warships to attack and threaten Fijians on his behalf, events described in chapter 7. As Whippy, Wallis, and Williams pursued respect in different ways, they became party to the many changes taking place in Fiji due to foreign influence. Although I see this book as contributing mainly to U.S. history by spotlighting the global reach of the early United States and the role extraterritorial Americans played in bringing that about, I have tried to do right by the history of Fiji. To convey a person’s social position or a cultural practice that has no English-language equivalent, I use Fijian words, which are defined in the text when they first appear and also in a glossary in the back of the book. Except when quoting, I adhere to the Fijian orthography developed\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nby Wesleyan Methodist missionaries David Cargill and William Cross in the late 1830s, which is the country’s official orthography today: C=th, B=mb, D=nd, G=ng, Q=ngg. Note that in writings from the time period, the spellings are more random but accord with how English speakers pronounced words. For example, Bau usually appears in the documents as “Ambow,” “Mbau,” or “Bow”; Cakobau as “Thakombau”; Nadi, a place name on both of Fiji’s largest islands, as “Nandy”; Gavidi, head of the Lasakau fishing clan and Cakobau’s great friend and henchman, as “Navinde”; and Qaraniqio, Cakobau’s foe during the Bau-Rewa war, as “Naringio.”38 Fiji had a complex political structure in which the largest unit was the matanitu, a confederated polity usually called in English-language texts “territory,” “district,” “state,” or “kingdom” (see Map 3). Bau referred both to the islands’ most powerful matanitu and to that matanitu’s headquarters, the small island of Bau situated off Viti Levu’s southeastern coast. Rewa was a large and important town on Viti Levu and the name for another powerful matanitu, which embraced satellite peoples on the islands of Viti Levu, Kadavu, and Beqa. Other matanitu that saw a lot of American ship traffic were Bua, Cakaudrove, Lau, Macuata, and Ba. The Americans in Fiji were usually able to figure out who belonged to which matanitu even though diplomacy and war put allegiances between allied and subject peoples in constant flux.39 Individuals’ political roles and titles also have no direct match in the English language. Americans in Fiji usually called ruling men “kings” and “chiefs.” “Chiefs” were elite men, turaga, who inherited a high rank from their mothers; marama was the female equivalent and translated into English as “queen” or “queens.” A ruler over a territory, or “king,” was tui, as in Tui Levuka, ruler of Levuka, or Tui Cakau, ruler of Cakaudrove. The title did not always match the place. For instance, Tui Dreketi ruled Rewa, and Tui Nayau ruled at Lakeba. A turaga levu was a “great chief,” very likely the same man as tui. The majority of Fijians were kaisi, which English speakers in nineteenth-century Fiji interpreted as commoners, poor people, or slaves. The willingness of kaisi to heed the turaga class without question or complaint made their status appear akin to slavery, but more precisely kaisi meant someone without rank or land and subject to turaga. Kaisi carried with it “a dash of contempt” and often appears in the documentary record as an insult regardless of a person’s actual rank.40 The overarching social, or ethnic, division operating in island politics broke the population into three groups: Kai Viti (Fijian people), Kai Toga (Tongans), and Kai Papalagi (foreign people). Papalagi encompassed\n\nWhy Go a Fiji Voyage?\n\n13\n\nAmericans, British, French and, as best as can be discerned from scattered remarks in the documents, Filipino, Lascar, and Pacific Islanders who were neither Fijian nor Tongan, men who had arrived as sailors on trading vessels and stayed on as beachcombers. The term papalagi occurs throughout the Pacific and has uncertain origins, meaning perhaps ghosts, spirits, ships and their sails, musket fire bursting through the sky, clothed people, or people trading in certain manufactured goods such as cloth or beads. Those who translated the word into English in the nineteenth century usually treated it as a synonym for “white,” “white men,” or “Europeans,” but given the racial and ethnic diversity of people who came by ship, its meaning best approximates foreigners.41 I use papalagi frequently because it is the term people at the time employed and because it frees me from having to resort to the wordier “Americans and Europeans” or the word whites, which would be a misnomer since Fiji’s foreigners included several African Americans and the Seminole Indian John Sparr, about whom I have written in Native American Whalemen and the World. I do not say much about Sparr in this book since I have told his story elsewhere, but he associated closely with the merchant Williams. As consul, Williams advocated for Sparr’s rights as a U.S. national as did U.S. naval commanders. From the Fijian perspective, Williams and Sparr were both papalagi. Besides their shared status as foreigners in Fiji, their nationality as Americans also shaped their experiences, since that was the pretext for the protections the U.S. government extended to Sparr in his complaints against Fijians. Sparr’s race mattered to some extent since Americans and Britons often attached “Seminole” or “Indian” to his name when mentioning him in their writings. But as I argued in Native American Whalemen and the World, the racial divides among Americans lost valence overseas.42 Even though the ideology of civilization had a racial cast in that lightskinned people typically claimed civilized superiority over dark-skinned people, the racial diversity among Americans in Fiji limited race’s potency as a weapon to diminish others. And so even though Americans sometimes referred to Fijians as blacks or used more derogatory racial epithets, race was not as powerful a dynamic in nineteenth-century Fijian social relations as was indigeneity versus foreignness, nationality, and culture. Cannibalism especially became the hallmark of Fijians’ savage natures. Fijians had complexions “bordering close to the Negro,” bêche-de-mer trader John H. Eagleston noted when speaking of his first glimpse of them upon arrival in Fiji on the Peru in 1831. With more drama, he penned, the “long talked of Savage and Cannibal was now before us.”43\n\nChapter 1\n\nButenam Knowledge\n\nThe American seafarers who came to Fiji for sandalwood and bêche-demer earned a slight share of the wealth generated but derived additional satisfaction from their time in the islands. Their unique experiences granted them a rarefied, socially elevating expertise. Returning home with fantastic stories and curiously wrought souvenirs, they became knowledge brokers whose firsthand observations shaped American perceptions of Fiji and Fiji Islanders for decades to come. They produced two kinds of knowledge, one pragmatic and logistical, the other ethnographic and ideological. Practical knowledge made navigation safer and faster, fostered commercial networks and routines, and identified exploitable natural resources. In the mercantile culture of the early republic, this kind of knowledge was critical. Merchants advised younger generations that “knowledge is power” and that they should learn foreign languages and customs regulating the conduct of business unique to each country. They corresponded incessantly with family, friends, and strangers to ask about current prices at Batavia, Lisbon, Amsterdam, Canton, and other places around the globe, to inform associates of the availability or impossibility of obtaining certain cargos at certain ports, and to maintain channels of sociability through which news of commercial value flowed. Accurate and timely information decided the\n\nButenam\n\n15\n\nfate of financial speculations.1 This was especially so for the carrying trade, which derived profit from the differential value of things: buying low in one place, selling high somewhere else. Cultural differences in consumer tastes and demand created the large gaps in value that made the triangular trade between the United States, Fiji, and China immensely profitable.2 Ethnographic knowledge intersected with pragmatic knowledge but resulted in more than monetary rewards. By reporting on the bizarre customs of Fijians, Americans consigned its people to the opposite end of the humanity spectrum and affirmed for a larger public Americans’ cultural superiority. Americans who traveled overseas occupied a singular position from which to demonstrate intellect, initiative, and worldliness. Their esoteric knowledge attached them to the enlightenment traditions that celebrated knowledge accumulation as the epitome of civility and progress. To “know what men are and may be in a savage state” was bound up with the effort to comprehend “the human character in a civilized state” to thereby “arrive at a better knowledge of human nature in the abstract.”3 To know the other was to know oneself. Both pragmatic and ethnographic knowledge production were fundamental to U.S. global expansion. In Fiji, American traders had to learn to navigate the archipelago’s island-studded, reef-ridden geography; what sandalwood and bêche-de-mer were, where to find them, and how to process them so as to meet the quality standards of Chinese consumers; and how to negotiate with Fijians to access their knowledge, territory, and labor. American traders could not harvest Fijian resources without Fijian help, so they needed to figure out how to communicate with Fijians, what trade items appealed to Fijian consumers, and who held power over whom. At the same time, Fijians became knowable in American popular culture as ethnographic objects, the ultimate savages.Two traders nicknamed “Butenam” exemplify the practical and ethnographic rewards awaiting Americans who entered the Fiji trade. When in 1811 Captain William Putnam Richardson of the Active came to Fiji after sandalwood, Fijians called him by his middle name because Richardson was too cumbersome to pronounce. Benjamin Vanderford, second mate on the Active and later a captain and supercargo in the bêche-de-mer trade, inherited Richardson’s nom-de-trade.4 Richardson and Vanderford hailed from Salem, one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the United States due to its preeminence in global commerce. Salem was also home to the nation’s most renowned maritime knowledge repository, the East India Marine Society. The society encouraged its members to deposit logbooks in its library and bring back oddities for its museum. Put on display\n\n16\n\nChapter 1\n\nFigure 1.1. This magazine illustration captures the contrast between the gentility of museum goers and the exoticism of the East India Marine Society artifacts exhibited in Salem.

Courtesy of the American Antiquarian Society.\n\nin the hodgepodge manner typical of cabinets of curiosities, these artifacts allowed for the museum’s many visitors to marvel vicariously at the primitivity of distant places (see figure 1.1). Richardson and Vanderford joined this prestigious association as soon as they were eligible and donated a large amount of Pacific material to the society’s collections.5 As one of the last Pacific island archipelagos visited by Europeans, Fiji was a cipher on maps of the world when the sandalwood trade started in 1804. Over the next fifty years, a more detailed picture of Fiji emerged, much of it produced by Americans whose jobs took them there. Before the sandalwood boom, Americans knew only two things about Fiji: it was northwest of the Tonga Islands, and Fijians were ferocious cannibals. These inklings came from scant, secondhand remarks in the writings of British explorers.6 Captain James Cook’s famous voyages of exploration included a sighting of Fiji and comments about Fijian people. In 1774, on his second voyage to the Pacific, he reached Vatoa on the archipelago’s eastern edge but saw its\n\nButenam\n\n17\n\ninhabitants only from a distance. He named it “Turtle Island” and noted its location. At Tonga three years later, while on his third voyage, Cook heard of a large island to the west called “Feejee,” probably a reference to Viti Levu, and met Fijians, whom he described as “a full shade darker” than Tongans and “addicted, like those of New Zealand, of eating their enemies, whom they kill in battle.” Cook further claimed that Fijians were “much respected” in Tonga for the “cruel manner of their nation’s going to war” and their ingeniously crafted clubs, spears, tapa bark cloth (masi in Fiji), mats, and pottery.7 Cook influenced other travelers’ expectations. Captain James Wilson of the Duff, at Tonga in the late 1790s to drop off London Missionary Society fieldworkers, cribbed from Cook nearly verbatim in his account of the Duff’s voyage, describing Fijians as “cannibals of a fierce disposition.” He imagined them “dancing round us, while we were roasted on large fires.”8 Thus the earliest images of Fiji to circulate in Europe and the United States fixated on cannibalism. Other seafarers sailing through the archipelago on the way to somewhere else filled in more specifics on the location and extent of “Feejee” as it appeared on early charts of the Pacific.9 William Bligh sighted northern Viti Levu and the Yasawa group as he steered the Bounty launch from Tonga to Timor after the 1789 mutiny by members of his crew.10 On a second voyage in 1792, this time successfully transporting breadfruit from Tahiti to the Caribbean, Bligh more deliberately marked islands passed on his course from Tonga through southeastern Fiji and claimed “Bligh’s Islands” as his discovery.11 Americans, too, recorded islands spotted while traversing the archipelago. On the Ann & Hope—a Providence, Rhode Island, trader en route to China—someone charted several islands and later publicized their geographic coordinates in American newspapers.12 The impact was moot, however, since no one in the United States had any reason to go to Fiji. The China trade made Fiji an American destination. Chinese luxury goods had been imported into the British North American colonies since the seventeenth century, but the British East India Company’s monopoly thwarted colonists’ ambitions to conduct their own trade.13 Immediately after the revolutionary war, in 1784, the Empress of China departed New York, the Grand Turk from Salem two years later, and every year thereafter several vessels from Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, and other eastern port cities. American ships carried the medicinal herb ginseng and Spanish dollars around the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn, returning home flush with tea, silk, and porcelain wares.14 Because the Chinese had little interest in what Americans had to offer, merchants set about to discover what\n\n18\n\nChapter 1\n\nelse besides ginseng and dollars the Chinese might want. They sent ships to North America’s Northwest Coast to trade with Indians for sea otter pelts and other ships southward to slaughter seals. Slashing and burning through one commodity after another, they happened upon Pacific sandalwood.15 The essential oils found in the slow-growing heartwood of the sandalwood tree exude a heady, ethereal aroma. Pacific peoples favored sandalwood as a scent and soaked scrapings of it into coconut oil. Fijians valued it most as a trade item, and before papalagi came in search of it, they regularly exchanged it with Tongans for stingray barbs, tapa, and other items of Tongan manufacture. Some sandalwood grew in Tonga but not very well. The Chinese also treasured sandalwood. Americans in China remarked on the sandalwood “Joss” or “Josh” sticks burned before altars in religious rites and the fans, boxes, and chests carved from it. But unlike ginseng, sandalwood did not grow in North America and so was not feasible as an American export. The highest quality sandalwood came from India and arrived in China on British East India Company ships. Pacific sandalwood was not as fragrant as Indian sandalwood, but the species that grew in Fiji, santalum yasi, was one of the more aromatic. Small cargos of Pacific sandalwood dribbled into China’s foreign trading entrepôt at Canton in the 1790s, but it was not until the American sailor Oliver Slater noticed extensive sandalwood groves in Fiji in 1804 that foreign ships began large-scale cutting of Pacific sandalwood. The rush began at Fiji, spread to the Marquesas in the 1810s, lasted at Hawai‘i into the early 1820s, and ended at the New Hebrides and New Caledonia in the 1830s and 1840s.16 Little is known about Slater and his ship, the Argo, which wrecked on a reef while sailing through Fiji around 1800. He found refuge among Fijians at Bua Bay on Vanua Levu. Two years later, El Plumier, a former Spanish vessel owned by Sydney merchants, pulled into Bua Bay to make repairs and transported Slater to Manila. He then took a Manila-registered ship named the Fair American, to Port Jackson, the harbor of Sydney, New South Wales. At that time mainly a penal colony for British malfeasants, Sydney was emerging as a shipping hub for Pacific commerce, and a Sydney firm run by former convicts—Lord, Kable, and Underwood—responded to Slater’s report of Fijian sandalwood by sending him back to Bua Bay on their schooner Marcia in September 1804. The Marcia soon returned with fifteen tons, the first cargo of sandalwood collected at Fiji bound for Chinese markets.17 Meanwhile a sandalwood frenzy erupted at Sydney. British vessels licensed through the East India Company to enter the port of Canton and colonial vessels that operated out of Sydney left for the islands. The\n\nButenam\n\n19\n\nAmericans involved early on were sealers in the China trade who happened to be anchored at Port Jackson, replenishing food stores and waiting out harsh winter weather on southern sealing grounds. The Fair American, the ship that had brought Slater to Sydney, and the Union, a sealing brig owned by New York merchants Edmund Fanning and Willet Coles, stocked up on scrap iron and trinkets and left for Bua Bay. The Union thwarted an attack by islanders at Tonga, retreated to Sydney, and departed again for Fiji, but upon arriving in the Fiji group, shipwrecked off Koro Island. Its crew and passengers were never heard from again.18 The Fair American apparently loaded up on sandalwood and sailed to Manila or Canton.19 The following year, Captain Peter Chase of the Nantucket sealer Criterion collaborated with Sydney investors and, with Slater in company as guide and interpreter, made a highly profitable voyage to Fiji and Canton.20 When the news reached merchants in the United States, they added Fijian sandalwood to the lengthening roster of items Chinese consumers wanted and began directing vessels to Bua Bay. The promise of stellar profits outweighed the risks of shipwreck and savagery. Unfazed by the loss of the Union and demise of its crew, Fanning financed at least three more voyages to Fiji: the Hope in 1807, Tonquin in 1808, and Hope again in 1809.21 John Dorr and Company, a family firm headquartered in Boston, sent out the Jenny in 1807, commanded by the owners’ cousin, William Dorr Jr.22 The Dorrs instructed Jenny supercargo Lewis Francoeur to consider “procuring sandal wood like the sample of a fan given you, Birds’ nests or other articles suitable for China” but warned him, “At the Island of Fegie and others the natives are generally hostile so that not the least dependence can be placed on them.”23 Concurrently, Brown & Ives of Providence dispatched the Eliza, Captain Ebenezer H. Corey. They had heard that Sydney vessels had “made very great profits by carrying Sandal Wood from the Fejee Islands to Canton,” and if Corey deemed it “safe,” they recommended it.24 In June 1808, the brig crashed into a reef off Nairai, near where the Union had wrecked. Most of the crew survived, but they could not retrieve all of the Eliza’s $30,000 in Spanish silver, which along with sandalwood was meant to purchase a homebound cargo in Canton.25 Fijians on Nairai stripped the crew of their possessions, then housed and fed them. With Tui Nairai’s permission, Corey and some of his men took a boat to Bua Bay two weeks later and went aboard the Jenny. The remaining castaways continued to live off Fijian hospitality until they escaped the islands over the next few years on other sandalwood vessels. A Swedish sailor in the Eliza’s crew, Charles Savage, would become notorious in Fijian history. He and some of his shipmates stayed on as\n\n20\n\nChapter 1\n\nbeachcombers, abetting Bau in its wars of expansion, until one by one they met a violent end.26 The islands were now a hive of foreign activity. More than fifteen American and British trading vessels visited Bua Bay in 1808 and 1809.27 Most of what we know about the trade comes from this time period due to two accounts written by the Jenny’s Scottish-born first mate, William Lockerby: a short manuscript called “Directions for the Fegee or Sandle Wood Islands” drafted while in Fiji and a later memoir edited and published in 1925. When the Jenny sailed for Canton in July 1808, Captain Dorr stranded Lockerby and a boat’s crew at Bua Bay. Tui Bua invited Lockerby into his home until the British Favourite and General Wellesley arrived in October, at which point Lockerby went to work for them. Eight months later, he sailed with the Wellesley to Canton and from there left on another ship for Boston.28 Lockerby became fully versed in the sandalwood trade. His urge to write a memoir and, as will be discussed, the utility of his “Directions” to other traders testify to the high value placed on knowledge possession as a conduit to reputability. Reputations were much at stake in a trade roiling with personal animosities. Captain Dorr of the Jenny especially drew others’ ire. On the passage to Guam, where the Jenny stopped to repair storm damage, Dorr abused Captain Corey of the shipwrecked Eliza with insults and deprivations. Inexplicably, he then turned Corey over to the island’s Spanish authorities, telling them a half-truth about how Corey had piloted an invasion of British troops up the River Plate in South America. Corey thought Dorr the “worst of villains” and as “grate a Rogue” as he had ever met in his life.29 Dorr also had a falling out with Lockerby and abandoned him in Fiji deliberately. Dorr gave two reasons for leaving Lockerby behind. He told Corey that he dismissed Lockerby for stealing some of the Eliza’s Spanish coins but, to his cousins in Boston, claimed that contrary winds forced him to leave the islands suddenly.30 Lockerby offered a third explanation, one that made Lockerby out to be a dedicated ship’s officer—courageous, ambitious, intelligent, and possessed of critical knowledge about Fiji and the sandalwood trade. When Dorr saw how risky the trade was, he tried to ensure Lockerby’s loyalty by offering him a privilege of several tons to trade in sandalwood on his own account. Then Dorr retracted the offer, “and high words passed between us.” The “real cause” of their dispute, Lockerby then put forth, was that Dorr did not want Lockerby to make his knowledge of the trade available to competitors. While in Fiji, Lockerby had recorded “the bearings of the headlands, the\n\nButenam\n\n21\n\nsoundings, with the time of high water at the full and change of the moon, with other necessary information to enable me to make a correct chart, and accompanied with directions for making the Islands.” Dorr, “the craven coward,” knew of Lockerby’s plans to “publish the same on my return to America.” Thus, “it was not unnatural for him to wish to secure for his friends the monopoly of this equal-to-coining [super-profitable] business, or at least until he might make one or two trips before his countrymen knew the secret.”31 Boasting aside, Lockerby’s knowledge indeed had value. After Jenny owner John Dorr apologized and compensated Lockerby for his cousin’s treatment of him, he asked to buy “the copyright of my chart.” Lockerby chose instead to advertise it for sale, first in Boston and a year later in New York newspapers, “should any Gentlemen wish to engage upon the speculation of SANDAL WOOD.” He did not offer his services, only his information, but that alone was worth $100 each to two buyers who separately purchased a copy of it. One buyer must have been Richardson or a Richardson business associate because, even though Lockerby’s chart has not survived, the seven densely packed pages of “Directions” did and are among Richardson’s contributions to the East India Marine Society.32 Since Richardson gave Lockerby’s “Directions” to the East India Marine Society and not, as was more common, a logbook he had kept himself, he must have found Lockerby’s advice accurate and useful. However, Richardson did not rush blindly to Fiji with only Lockerby’s text to guide him. Though young (Richardson had just turned twenty-five years old when the Active left Salem on June 1, 1810, he was an experienced master mariner and far from naive as a consumer of information. Part owner of the Salem-built Active since 1806, he had made two voyages as its captain, one to Marseilles and the other to Sumatra. In 1810, he partnered with Salem merchants James Cook, John Dodge, and Charles Saunders under the rubric James Cook and Company. Cook was also a seasoned investor in global commerce.33 In determining whether to undertake a Fiji voyage, Richardson and his partners had to weigh profit and risk. Before acquiring Lockerby’s “Directions,” Richardson likely knew about the enormous gains to be had from a sandalwood voyage with only a miniscule investment in trifles. An 1806 “Letter written . . . by an Intelligent American” in Canton and reprinted in dozens of newspapers throughout the United States reported that, for only $1,500 in trade goods, the Criterion sold 3,000 piculs of Fijian sandalwood at $27 per picul (a picul was an East India and China trade measure equivalent\n\n22\n\nChapter 1\n\nto 133 pounds). The Criterion thus generated an $81,000 return on a $1,500 investment.34 Price was as much a risk as it was an incentive, however, since Richardson could not count on sandalwood prices staying high. By 1810, prices had already dropped. In his memoir, Lockerby exaggerated the rate of return by estimating that the Jenny’s £50 in scrap iron, beads, and looking glasses would have multiplied to £20,000 at Canton. Lockerby’s estimate would have entailed a better return on investment than that of the Criterion. The Jenny instead resulted in a complete loss since the British charged Captain Dorr with violating a blockade at Guam, condemned his vessel at Calcutta, and impounded its cargo. When Lockerby arrived in Canton on the General Wellesley, its sandalwood sold for only $18 per picul, a sharp reduction from the Criterion’s $27.35 A Sydney merchant in Canton in September 1809 attributed “so extraordinary a depreciation in the price of sandal-wood” to “the immense quantities of that commodity lately sent to that market.”36 The possibility of a speculation ruined by quixotic markets was compounded by the three to six months news took to travel the globe in the age of sail. Richardson would have anticipated that Lockerby’s information could have been out of date at the moment of its purchase. Another risk—or so one might think—was the savagery thought to be rife in the Pacific and especially in Fiji. Surprisingly, however, it did not deter trade. Even insurers seemed undaunted by it. Underwriters of the Active, Brutus, and Sally voyages to Fiji asked for a high premium in the range of 15 percent, but the most expensive marine insurance premiums at the time, on the eve of the War of 1812, were the 22½ to 25 percent charged U.S. vessels bound for certain European ports. Hence places believed to be at the apex of civilization engendered the highest shipping risk. In their insurance applications, owners of the Brutus and Sally identified Fiji as the destination, but James Cook and Company did not do so for the Active, suggesting that Richardson took Lockerby’s “Directions” along with Fiji in mind as a prospect, pending further enquiries upon arriving in the vicinity.37 Once in Fiji, Richardson appears to have heeded Lockerby’s recommendations and benefited from how Lockerby’s lengthy stay in the islands made him attuned to the intricacies of Fiji’s physical environment, political divides, and cultural distinctiveness. No logbook or journal survives from the Active, but one of its eighteen crew members, seaman Thomas Saul, later superintendent of the East India Marine Society museum, recorded the ship’s course. From Salem, the Active headed around the Cape of Good Hope to the Isle of Bourbon, on to Sydney, and then Fiji.38 When the Boston\n\nButenam\n\n23\n\nship Hunter arrived at Vanua Levu in May (its owners were possibly the second purchaser of Lockerby’s “Directions”), one of its crew mentioned in his journal that the Active, anchored in Bua Bay, was “partly loaded with sandalwood.”39 With Lockerby’s “Directions” in hand, Richardson had access to Lockerby’s experience to help him manage the trade’s greatest hazards: reefs, sandalwood depletion, and cannibals. Though optimistic in tone, so as not to scare off buyers, the “Directions” address these risks while portraying them as surmountable for those armed with specialized knowledge. In his “Directions,” Lockerby advised ships to sail northwest from Tonga, past Vatoa, to the island of Koro, where the people were friendly, hogs and fowls could be had, and a pilot could be brought on board to guide the vessel to Bua Bay. He warned that vessels must keep a sharp lookout, for a clutter of reefs, often submerged and hidden from view, encircled most islands. For narrow passages, he suggested that a boat go ahead to steer the ship along the safest track. Having lived in Fiji for over a year, Lockerby was able to pass along insights into how seasonal weather patterns changed the direction of the winds. The bulk of Lockerby’s “Directions” delve into the trade itself: how to overcome scarcity after five years of intensive cutting and how to manage local politics to obtain a workforce. Lockerby directed ships to head directly to Bua Bay and make contact with Tui Bua. Lockerby knew him by the title Buli Bouwalu and called him “King.” Of the four “kings” who ruled over different parts of Vanua Levu, Lockerby wrote in his memoir, Tui Bua was “considered the most powerful, being able to bring into the field three thousand men.” Tui Bua’s political connections made him still a player in the trade, even though, as Lockerby acknowledged in the “Directions,” “more than one Thousand Tons of sandlewood has been procured from the chief Beumbowala & his subjecks but it is rarther scarse now.” By 1808, the trade had migrated north to Wailea Bay, which is where the Jenny, Favourite, General Wellesley, and Tonquin sent their boats while the ships remained near Tui Bua’s town. Soon Wailea Bay faced shortfalls. In company with other vessels’ boat crews, Lockerby made excursions further north to Galoa Bay and inland along the Dreketi River, searching for untapped sandalwood reserves. Although his memoir admits that sandalwood grew only on Vanua Levu, his “Directions” paint a more positive prospect of “plenty of wood” reportedly at Cakaudrove to the east of Bua Bay and on Viti Levu, about which foreigners in Fiji then knew almost nothing, not even that it was the largest island in the group.40\n\n24\n\nChapter 1\n\nRichardson found enough sandalwood while anchored at Bua Bay to make his voyage but must have noticed its rarity. Francoeur, Lockerby’s coworker on the Jenny, hesitated to recommend another venture to his employers partly for this reason. “It is very astonishing,” he wrote John Dorr from Calcutta as he waited for the fate of the Jenny to be determined in British courts, that “this wood grows only on one Island & only on one end of that.” Moreover, so many ships had come for sandalwood, the Fijian men employed to cut and carry it to the ship’s boats were now “obliged to pack it a long ways, from 6 to 8 miles.”41 The Hibernia and Hope, both at Galoa Bay from November 1809 to January 1810, found the trade so dismal, they left with at most only a few tons each.42 Conducting trade in a war zone was an even greater obstacle. When Francoeur informed his employer that “the Feegie Trade I expect is about over,” he mentioned foremost how “the Natives are getting very troublesome and hostile.” Francoeur blamed the unrest on the growing population of “European” castaways and deserters turned beachcomber. These new residents of Fiji encouraged the islanders to “attempt bolder enterprises than they otherwise would.”43 Lockerby’s “Directions” compensate for these difficulties by listing the trade goods that Fijians would find most appealing and dissecting the internal and external politics of the Bua matanitu. In his lengthy recitation of trade goods, Lockerby emphasized whales’ teeth. In Fijian culture, Lockerby explained, whales’ teeth held a privileged place as exchange items. They sealed marriages and political pacts. Fijians “that is possessd of any of them lays them up as graet riches as porshens for their Daughters & Making peace with their offended Supiriors.” If actual whales’ teeth could not be had, any ivory—elephant tusks from India or Chinese fans—could be cut into the shape of a tooth and would be as desirable. A tooth weighing one pound could buy two tons of sandalwood. Also on Lockerby’s list were red fibers “for Slinging the Teath” around the neck or hanging them from rafters, white shells, axes, nails, knives, razors, scissors, cloth, beads, and looking glasses.44 In addition, Lockerby supplied Richardson with a glossary of trade jargon. A whale’s tooth was “Tamboo” (tabua). Sandalwood was “Iarse” (yasi). Questions such as “What will you take for this pile of wood?” gave Richardson and his men the phrases needed to complete a transaction. Lockerby listed the verbs “to cut wood,” “to sap wood” (strip the bark and sap to trim the log to its heartwood), “to carry wood,” and “to put it up in piles,” thus breaking down the process of sandalwood harvesting into stages. Lockerby further informed Richardson that it had become common practice to hand\n\nButenam\n\n25\n\nout axes and saws to Fijians to do the cutting in the interior, mountainous regions because sending “Europeans into the bush to cut the wood” had proven “dangerous.”45 With comments like this, Lockerby addressed the trade’s violent setting, yet he promised traders success if they understood the political landscape. Ships should go “well armed & niver to be of their gard for althow they are a hospitable people yet they are Canables & will take every Advantage from their propensity to Stealing the low Class of them in particular.” Even if the people one was trading with were “friendly . . . they are always at war among themselves & those that are their Enomies will be yours.” Lockerby ended with brief character studies of the eight most important men on the northwestern side of Vanua Levu, stressing the need to find trading partners who could command territory and labor or, as Lockerby described them, “the prinsipal Chiefs with Whome it is best to be on good termes with that they may encurage the poor people to cut wood.” He most recommended Tui Bua, who “having more men than any of the other chiefs is the most powerfull of them all & is understood to be the King of the Island.” He was “very parshall to Europeans” and would go along to Galoa Bay “& Introduce you to the Chiefs their.” Lockerby also spoke favorably of one Fijian ruler who had “his people under good subjection” and another who was “very usefull he can speack a few words of English.” Several others would arrange to have wood cut but had to be watched carefully: Tui Korovatu was “a grait Villen,” the people of Wailea were “grait theaves,” and the Tavea islanders were “a set of Rubbers and lives by Plunder.”46 The alleged villainy of the people of Korovatu, Wailea, and Tavea stemmed not from the innate savagery Lockerby implied but from rivalry for dominance in foreign trade. Initially, sandalwood traders had found Tonga the more dangerous place. The Portland, Union, and Port-au-Prince had been attacked at Tonga, and other ships, such as the Jenny, had fired on Tongan canoes or experienced skirmishes on deck while stopping there on the way to Fiji. In contrast, the only difficulty encountered by the earliest foreign vessels in Fiji came from colliding into reefs. By 1808, the trade had turned violent. When the Jenny arrived at Bua Bay in May, its crew immediately fell into a brawl with seamen on the Sydney brig Elizabeth, who “tried to run our ship on shore” to rid the islands of competition. Thereafter, however, British and American traders afforded each other mutual protection. All subsequent acts of hostility in Lockerby’s memoir pitted Fijians against papalagi except for two major battles between Fijians, in which papalagi took a side. Muskets were not yet a trade item as they would be twenty years later,\n\n26\n\nChapter 1\n\nbut sandalwood vessels had armament galore—four-pounder and twelvepounder cannons and swivel guns loaded with grapeshot—while crew members always went ashore carrying pistols and muskets. Sandalwood traders resorted to firepower whenever they felt threatened and to support Fijians who promised to bring them wood.47 Tui Bua remained the ally of choice for foreign traders even though the sandalwood in his domains was now tapped out. The environmental serendipity bestowing on him the role of kingpin had a ripple effect across Vanua Levu and further south to the island of Bau. The influx of trade goods empowered him but simultaneously energized rivals to take his trading monopoly from him. In mid-1808, a number of towns affiliated with the matanitu of Bua balked when he refused to give up “a part of the property he had received from Europeans.” He told Lockerby that “ever since the white men traded with him, he had always given them a portion of what his own subjects had worked hard for; but now he and his people had determined to give them no more.”48 Bua’s rebels, the towns of Tacilevu and Korovatu, combined forces with Bau and others jealous of Bua’s supremacy in the papalagi trade. These challengers to Tui Bua formed a fleet of 150 war canoes, the largest of which came from Bau and carried two hundred men. They attacked Tui Bua’s nephew at Tavea first and killed several hundred people in a battle lasting three days. The fleet then headed toward Tui Bua’s stronghold, but the Favourite and General Wellesley, soon joined by the Tonquin, inadvertently blocked the fleet’s passage upriver to Tui Bua’s fort. These foreign ships were not passive bystanders but intervened on the side of Tui Bua. During the battle at Tavea, the Bau alliance kidnapped Lockerby and two boats’ crews belonging to the Favourite. In retaliation, its captain fired his ship’s guns on the town of Tacilevu, killing many inside the fortress.49 For the sandalwood traders, the immediate crisis was that warfare among Fijians kept Fijian men from leaving their forts to cut wood in the highlands. The traders encouraged Tui Bua to negotiate peace with his rebels, some of whom came back into the fold. But the people of Tacilevu, resenting the Favourite’s bombardment of their town, refused. So an armed party of papalagi joined nearly two thousand of Tui Bua’s men in a devastating raid on Tacilevu. The battle so “reduced” the town, it had still not recovered forty years later, when survivors told a missionary that “Tui Bua at that time was very angry with the people of Tacilevu, so he agreed to give a cargo of sandalwood on condition that the captain should destroy Tacilevu.” Trade resumed, and the three trading vessels, one after the other, quickly arrived at a full cargo. Lockerby’s list of Vanua Levu’s most influential men sidesteps\n\nButenam\n\n27\n\nthe increasingly deadly politics of the trade by identifying who was amenable and powerful without elaborating on the historical events that had made them so.50 When the Active arrived at Bua Bay, the same problems described in Lockerby’s “Directions” still prevailed: sandalwood depletion, a dependence on Tui Bua whose hold on the trade was slipping, and wars between Fijians. Because there was no longer any sandalwood to be cut in Bua, the other vessels in Fiji at the same time as the Active—the Boston ship Hunter, a British ship from Calcutta also named Hunter, the ship Bordeaux of New York, and the brig Brutus, commanded by William Dorr Jr., Lockerby’s nemesis from the Jenny—did not anchor in Bua Bay. They passed through the reefs to move closer to the remaining stands of sandalwood on northern Vanua Levu, near Wailea Bay and at the mouth of the Dreketi River. They all found that “sandalwood was very hard to be got in this place as the natives were constantly at war with each other.”51 Captain Dorr took the initiative. He made a deal with the head man of the town of Dreketi, whose people would not go into the mountains to cut wood for fear of the people of Druadrua. If Dorr would join Dreketi in an assault on Druadrua, the ruler of Dreketi promised Dorr he “would fill his Brigg with S wood.” So Dorr sent his first mate and four other men armed with muskets, pistols, and cutlasses to attack the Druadrua fort. But their wet muskets would not fire, and the five men from the Brutus were all “speard to deth by those savige Canibals, 3 of them was rosted and eat.” A few days later, Dorr sent a cannon ashore with orders to his men to take Wailea by force. Again defeated, the Brutus in company with the Bourdeaux headed for Viti Levu, where Dorr’s hopes to find rich sandalwood reserves in less war-ridden climes would have come to naught, since not much sandalwood grew on Viti Levu. These two vessels soon left the group, probably for the Marquesas or Hawai‘i. With only forty tons of Fijian sandalwood, the Hunter of Boston sailed to the Marquesas and, adding two hundred more tons, arrived in Canton in February 1812 with a cargo that sold for $75,000.52 As the Marquesas began to draw most sandalwood traffic, a few traders continued to visit Fiji, where the wars on northern Vanua Levu continued. In 1813, these conflicts climaxed in a battle at Wailea. As recalled in a memoir by Peter Dillon, then an officer on the Hunter of Calcutta, Charles Savage and other beachcombers working for Bau and the Hunter were killed in a failed offense on the town of Wailea. A few sandalwood traders appeared in the group subsequently, but that infamous battle served as a dramatic finale to Fiji’s sandalwood boom.53\n\n28\n\nChapter 1\n\nDespite sandalwood depletion and mounting warfare, the Active’s voyage was highly profitable. Richardson had left Salem with $18,000 in preserved meats, tobacco, codfish, liquor, iron bars, nails, spermaceti candles, glassware, shoes, hats, and tar, goods that he probably sold at the Isle of Bourbon and Sydney in exchange for the Fiji trade items on Lockerby’s list. He returned to Salem less than two years later with a cargo of tea and other China merchandise valued by the customs inspector at nearly $180,000.54 As was common in the life course of Salem merchants, Richardson’s several voyages as captain gave him a sufficiency to leave the seafaring to others and enter fully into the life of a merchant.55 Although Richardson apparently never left New England again, he continued in the sandalwood business. In 1815, he and several previous partners bought the ship Indus. He hired his second mate on the Active, Vanderford, to act as first mate under Captain Nathaniel Page and sent the Indus to the Marquesas. The Indus left again for the Marquesas in 1817, with Vanderford as captain, and stopped in Fiji for more sandalwood on its way to Canton.56 In 1821, Richardson sent the newly purchased Roscoe, under Vanderford’s command, to Bua Bay, where in four months the vessel took aboard several thousand pounds of sandalwood per day.57 Scarcity thwarted a dedicated trade in it, however. Just as the news of Chinese demand for sandalwood and the islands’ possession of it had spread quickly around the world, the knowledge of sandalwood’s decline snuffed out foreign interest in Fiji. Utilitarian knowledge, which was so critical to the profits merchants hoped to amass from their speculations, worked like a faucet to turn on and off the flow of foreign ships through the archipelago. Another boom, targeting bêche-de-mer, revived ship traffic in the late 1820s. Although the two rushes on Fijian resources fell into distinct time periods, there was some overlap. The Roscoe, in Fiji from April through July 1822, could be considered either the last sandalwood trader or the harbinger of the next big thing, since Captain Vanderford collected bêche-de-mer as well.58 And the Clay, under Vanderford’s command five years later, initially had sandalwood as its objective but turned into a bêche-de-mer operation, inspiring a deluge of copycats.59 Bêche-de-mer—called “beach la mar” by Yankee traders, dri in Fiji, trepang in Manila, and sea cucumber on Chinese restaurant menus in the United States—feeds on and alongside coral reefs. The many species vary in texture, color, size, and edible desirability. The Chinese preferred a six-inch black variety and used it to flavor soups (see figure 1.2). Like bird’s nests, coral moss, and shark fins, which foreign vessels also harvested in the Pacific to sell in China, bêche-de-mer’s distinctive taste did not appeal to Americans,\n\nButenam\n\n29\n\nFigure 1.2. The most valuable bêche-de-mer was a black variety that, when dried, measured about four inches in length. Captain Benjamin Wallis acquired this specimen in Fiji.

They rarely ate dri.61 From the Fijian perspective, a useless object suddenly gained value as a trading commodity. The bêche-de-mer trade differed from the earlier sandalwood trade in when, where, and how it operated and who was involved. Salem sent only the Active to Fiji during sandalwood’s heyday but dominated the bêche-demer trade. There were other geographic differences. Instead of taking cargos directly to China, bêche-de-mer traders preferred to deal with Chinese merchants in Manila for that port’s affordability and proximity. And in Fiji itself, natural habitats of these valuable resources altered the routes traders took: sandalwood grew only on northwestern Vanua Levu, but bêche-demer flourished on coral reefs throughout the archipelago. Although it still was the case that the Fijians who controlled territory and laborers had the advantage, bêche-de-mer traders more often dealt with the two powerhouse matanitu of central Fiji: Bau and Rewa. Even more important a contrast between the two trades was that sandalwood had not required any shore facilities, whereas bêche-de-mer had to be cured in a laborious and delicate\n\n30\n\nChapter 1\n\nFigure 1.3. Inside bêche-de-mer houses, workers smoke-dried the slugs over wood fires. Original by Alfred T. Agate in Charles Wilkes, Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition, During the Years 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, 1842, 5 vols. plus atlas (Philadelphia: C. Sherman, 1844), 3: 232.

Supervision of a workforce at these houses increased the risk of violence.62 Otherwise, the two trades had much in common: Chinese tastes inspired the harvesting of a natural product found in Fiji, little outlay in cost promised a high rate of return, foreign traders had to motivate Fijians to do the heavy labor, traders embroiled themselves in Fijian power struggles to secure a cargo, and success depended on the acquisition of knowledge. While trading for sandalwood, Edmund Fanning warned, it took “the judgement of an experienced person” to distinguish “genuine” sandalwood from a “spurious” look-alike, the smell of which evoked sandalwood but faded quickly. Fanning similarly cautioned those seeking bêche-de-mer. Once taken from the sea, the slugs had to be kept out of the sun, or they would dissolve into a gooey mass. On shore, workers slit each slug open with a knife to remove its guts, submerged it in a boiling “pickle” of water, saltpeter, and “a mite of allum” to give it the “clear amber color” prized in the China market and then placed the slugs on racks or “flakes” to dry over a wood fire. Fanning strongly advised “that a person who undertakes to collect it should have had\n\nButenam\n\n31\n\nexperience in the business.”63 Of the two extractive industries, bêche-de-mer had the steepest learning curve, so steep that one or two cargos of rotten slugs delivered at Canton or Manila could explain why bêche-de-mer did not electrify speculators as sandalwood had. European and American traders knew early on of the Chinese demand for bêche-de-mer but were slow to exploit it. A British surveying expedition of 1803 observed “Malays from Macassar” diving for slugs in the Gulf of Carpentaria, north of Australia, and reported that it “seems to bring the Malays a good many thousand dollars annually from the Chinese.”64 Sandalwood traders in Fiji, on the Jenny in 1808 and the Hibernia a year later, itemized bêche-de-mer as part of their cargos but without stating if they had procured it in Fiji.65 Lockerby’s “Directions,” in the manuscript itself and as announced in his newspaper advertisements, included a recipe “for the curing of BEACHLEMARE,” but there is no evidence that he or Richardson dealt in it.66 In 1810, one American vessel—the Amethyst of Boston (like the Jenny, owned by the Dorrs)—did collect bêche-de-mer, but at Palau, not at Fiji. Captain Seth Smith intended to go to Fiji for more bêche-de-mer and sandalwood, but a rotting hull cut short his venture.67 Not until 1827, with the Clay, did the bêche-de-mer trade at Fiji take off. The earlier effort, on the Roscoe, may have failed out of ignorance. Vanderford had put a twenty-year-old New England seaman “on shore to inform the natives in curing beach-le-mar,” but how would he have known what to do?68 Maybe he followed Lockerby’s instructions, but as an American in charge of a bêche-de-mer house in the 1840s attested to, experience with the arduous and finicky curing method made the best teacher: it “requires considerable practice to be a judge of it . . . if boiled too much or too little, it will spoil, if dried too much or not enough it is equally liable to rot, while if any of it touch iron or has not air enough, or if the least bit of water should get amongst it, in two weeks the ship’s hold would be nothing but one mass of slimy corruption.”69 If the Roscoe had succeeded, surely Vanderford would not have waited another five years to return for more. And the Clay had trouble at first. Rainy weather “destroyed much of our Beach lee Marr,” second mate William Driver recorded in his journal. Then a barrel of it “spoilt . . . the sun not having power enough to dry it.” This remark suggests that the crew did not yet know that smoke drying the slugs worked better than leaving them out in the sun. In an addendum to his journal written nearly sixty years later, Driver claimed credit for figuring out how to prepare bêche-de-mer correctly: “Here I stayed & cured 480 Piculs of Beach le mar, the first ever cured by white men. Ben Vanderford\n\n32\n\nChapter 1\n\nhad Read Kotzbues Russian Voyages and dreamed of cureing a fortune by boiling snails in a dinner Pot after punching their Enterels out with a Stick . . . but he knew no more of curing Beach le Marr than my Dog does of the Nicene Creed.” Of course, Driver knew nothing of it himself until he learned the process correctly from others. Fortuitously, the crew from a Manila brig, variously referred to as the bêche-de-mer trader Laurice or sandalwood trader Concepción, had mutinied in Fiji two years before the Clay’s arrival. After murdering the captain and officers, the mutineers abandoned the brig near Bau, where the islanders broke it apart for its iron. The Clay hired these “Manilla Pirats” to man the bêche-de-mer house under Driver’s management, and he acquired their expertise through observation.70 Once learned, the process lost its mystery. Interest in bêche-de-mer mushroomed among Salem’s leading merchants. N. L. Rogers and Brothers, Stephen C. Phillips, Joseph Peabody, Robert Brookhouse, S. Chamberlain and Son, and others commissioned more than a dozen vessels to enter the trade, including the Quill, Glide, Niagara, Charles Doggett, and Peru.71 Barring shipwreck, native attempts to commandeer vessels, and periodic slug depletion, such voyages reaped great profits for their investors. As with sandalwood, the gap in the exchange value across three locales—Salem, Fiji, and China (by way of Manila)—produced high rates of return. In an 1847 report to the U.S. State Department, John B. Williams summarized average expectations. An investment of $3,500 in trade goods, the most valuable of which from the islanders’ perspective were whales’ teeth, would result in twelve hundred piculs of bêche-de-mer and one thousand pounds of tortoise shell, reaping $40,000.72 Bêche-de-mer and other Pacific products inspired a need for more knowledge to mitigate danger and maximize profits. So in 1838, the U.S. government responded to merchants’ demands for greater protection by sending the U.S. Exploring Expedition to the Pacific on a mission of discovery. Commerce in bêche-de-mer made Fiji a priority, and Salem’s influence on the Ex Ex was conspicuous. One Salem bêche-de-mer vessel, the Leonidas captained by John H. Eagleston, happened to be in the Fiji group while the Ex Ex was there, but in addition Salem contributed key personnel, including Vanderford, who was hired as master’s mate and expert in all things Fijian.73 In truth, before the Ex Ex gave Vanderford an outlet for demonstrating his Fijian expertise, he appears to have been the least respected of Salem’s bêche-de-mer traders. Others besides his second mate, Driver, did not like him. While competing with Vanderford for bêche-de-mer houses on the\n\nButenam\n\n33\n\nMacuata coast in 1834, Eagleston railed against Vanderford’s “unmanly doings” and “treacherous and underhanded proceedings.” Even Fijians were “not over fond” of Butenam, according to Eagleston’s clerk, Warren Osborn.74 And yet, Vanderford’s six voyages to Fiji over two decades (the Active, Indus, Roscoe, Clay, Niagara, and Consul) had taught him “a smattering of the language,” who ruled Fiji’s multiple polities, and how to barter for hogs, yams, coconuts, and bananas, all of which helped make the first large-scale American exploration of the Pacific a success. Bemused, Ex Ex naturalist Charles Pickering observed how Vanderford as Butenam was “evidently known to more persons among the Feejees, than in his native town.”75 But after his March 1842 death on the Vincennes’ homeward passage, Vanderford became known to other Americans as well. In the Ex Ex’s official, published report, expedition commander Charles Wilkes eulogized Vanderford for his “usefulness” and “familiarity with the manners and customs of the Feejee Islands.”76 Knowledge of global markets, manufacturing processes, and varied consumer cultures undergirded Salem’s prosperity and had the power to establish some among its citizenry as men of ability and attainment. Richardson and Vanderford were just two among hundreds of seafarers who parlayed their foreign experiences into a modicum of public recognition. They advanced American commercial expansion into the Pacific by learning how to exploit and sell exotic commodities, while on the domestic front, they had another kind of influence as ethnographic collectors and commentators. Traders in sandalwood and bêche-de-mer returned home eager to tell others about their adventures in such a strange, faraway place. In their writings and display of artifacts, they elaborated on British explorers’ depictions of Fijian savagery without resolving what seemed like contradictions between “the ferocity of their character, their ceaseless treachery, and shameless Cannibalism” and how Fijians simultaneously seemed “very good natured,” “very hospitable,” “segacious,” and more “civilised” than other Pacific Islanders.77 Images of Fiji that reached a broader American public tended to obliterate these complexities to portray a unidimensional, horrific caricature of the “Feejees” as a Hobbesian nightmare, in which there were no rules, only an innate desire for ruthless warfare and an appetite for human flesh. The sandalwood trade introduced an array of Fiji materials and tales into American popular culture. Probably it was some crew member from the Tonquin or Hope who acquired the objects that Mix’s Museum in New\n\n34\n\nChapter 1\n\nHaven, Connecticut, put on display in 1812: a “collection of Battle Axes, War Clubs, Spears, Darts, Death Malls, and Death Clubs brought from the Fegee and other Islands.”78 That same year, John Scudder’s American Museum in New York City advertised its “WAR CLUBS—BATTLE AXES— DEATH MALLS, and BOWS and ARROWS, all curiously wrought, and used in the wars by the natives of South America and the Fegee Islands.”79 This panoply of frightful weaponry in museums cast Fijians as war hungry and lethal. British accounts also circulated in the United States. In 1810, numerous American newspapers reprinted “The Fejee Islands” from the Sydney Gazette, retitling it “An Island of Savage Cannibals.” The article assailed the violence the British sandalwood trader Favourite met with, as though the ship’s crew were victims of an unreasonable Fijian hostility, and not, as would have been more accurate, leading actors in the violence that ensued: Fiji islanders had recently been “considered of an amicable turn of mind, until, by a recent conduct, they also [like Tonga islanders] have betrayed affections more to be dreaded than caressed.”80 The Gentleman’s Magazine was another early purveyor of Fiji imagery in a two-part series originating with British sandalwood trader Richard Siddins. In the first story, Siddins described the ceremony by which a widow accompanied her husband into the afterlife. She approached the body of her husband and kissed it. She then sat in the lap of another woman who held the back of her neck and mouth. Suddenly, a man wrapped a cord around her neck, which six other men pulled taut to strangle her in an instant. The second story details the rites of cannibalism against a captured enemy, how the islanders cut off first the hands and feet, then the legs at the knee joint and midway along the thigh, and finally the head. They cooked the body parts in an earth oven heated with hot stones and planned to eat it the next day.81 American sandalwood traders made the most substantial contributions to world knowledge about Fiji. In May 1812, after the Active returned from Canton, Richardson entered the ranks of the East India Marine Society, its 143rd member. Vanderford joined in December 1820, once his command of the Indus’s 1817–19 voyage made him eligible. Along with Lockerby’s “Directions,” Richardson deposited a “Fegee Vocabulary” and at least sixteen Fijian objects with the society. Most were weapons of war: clubs, spears, bows and arrows, and several “Sceptres,” one of which Tui Bua gave him. Also attributed to Richardson were two liku, described in the society’s catalog as “Girdles or Sashes being the entire dress of females at the Fegee Islands.” The\n\nButenam\n\n35\n\ntagline “entire dress,” a common refrain in descriptions of Pacific women’s clothing, conveyed the near-nudity of women in tropical climes. Vanderford’s numerous gifts included war clubs as well as armlets, necklaces, and gorgets.82 These things joined other artifacts from around the world in the society’s collections. Visitors to the East India Marine Hall found its cornucopia of curiosities wondrous, and the society’s annual parades, when members dressed outlandishly in foreign garb and carried paraphernalia from the society’s collections through the streets of Salem, were widely celebrated and well attended.83 Richardson’s “Fegee Vocabulary” proved to be one of the society’s most significant items. Just as artifact collection had become common ethnographic practice by the time Richardson left for Fiji, vocabularies too had developed into a form of humanistic enquiry. Richardson heeded the call of such luminaries as Catherine the Great and Thomas Jefferson, who encouraged the compilation of vocabulary lists for comparative philological study.84 Richardson’s word list resembles Lockerby’s in its many references to finding, cutting, carrying, and buying sandalwood and the whales’ teeth, hatchets, beads, scissors, and other barter necessary to acquire it. But while Lockerby’s list was entirely oriented toward the trade, Richardson produced a more deliberately ethnographic document. He made some effort to organize terms systematically, beginning with numbers and methods of counting to large sums, followed by the words and phrases useful for trading. He then translated into English the Fijian words for social categories such as husband, wife, mother, “a great chief,” “a petty chief,” “a prophet,” and “a white man or a ghost” (“Pappelange”). Next are about two pages of words for common foods, one of which is “Boegoolah the dead body of an enemy which they intend to eat.” His two pages of warrelated words often comment on customs. Thus, “Cumbah ne Coro” was “to take a fort or town or to burn it, which is their constant practice when at war.” The remaining pages then become more random, suggesting that after composing an overview he began adding new words as they came up in conversation.85 Some of Richardson’s explanations of words may have had commercial utility from a trader’s perspective but deserved inclusion more as a way of seeing and describing cultures not one’s own. For “Tamboo,” he wrote, “anything forbidden by a chief is tambooed . . . the chiefs are in the habit of tambooing the different kinds of provisions . . . while this restriction remains any person eating of the forbidden articles would be put to death.”\n\n36\n\nChapter 1\n\nThis could have been useful for a trader to know, but it also was a custom foreigners would have found unusual and savage in the autocratic, capricious powers chiefs held over life and death. Richardson’s final page breaks from the usual ethnographic content to list what we might call rude or dirty words. These are nine words that he translated into English as “the privates of a man, a womans privates, Copulation, a private vice, to piss, to fart, excrements, lice, a crooked c-t.” The East India Marine Society cultivated a public persona as a gathering of “gentlemen,” but one wonders if, behind closed doors, they did not share reminiscences in a more ribald manner.86 An abbreviated, alphabetized version of Richardson’s vocabulary reached a broader readership through the auspices of Salem lawyer, politician, and noted philologist John Pickering. Recognized in his time for expertise in North American Indian languages, Pickering reflected a cosmopolitanism beyond North America in his approach to philology. He was an early advocate for the development of a universal orthography to make possible more systematic comparison of “the barbarous and unwritten languages of the globe in general.” In his European correspondence and scholarly objectives, Pickering represented the opposite of the American exceptionalism promoted by the isolated crank Noah Webster. Situated in a region deeply connected to the rest of the world through commerce and missionary organizations, such as the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Pickering became a node for ingoing and outgoing data within a global philological network.87 Pickering recognized the value of Richardson’s vocabulary and forwarded notes on it to colleagues as a sample of a little-known language. He either saw the East India Marine Society version or received a copy directly from Richardson, whom Pickering referred to as “an intelligent supercargo.”88 One recipient of Pickering’s notes, William Ellis, reproduced them in his Journal of a Tour around Hawaii, published in 1825, and concluded that “the Fejeean language has not probably the same origin with the Polynesian.” A former British missionary in the Society Islands and Hawai‘i, Ellis later published the four-volume, ethnographic classic Polynesian Researches, which helped popularize the term Polynesia, a Greek word for “many islands.”89 Ellis’s observations on differences between Fijian and the languages of the Society Islands and Hawai‘i aligned with theories then unfolding among nineteenth-century ethnologists whose attention to racial, cultural, and linguistic variety in the Pacific led them to place Fiji in “Melanesia,” a term\n\nButenam\n\n37\n\ncoined in an 1832 address by French explorer and philosophe Jules-SebastiénCésar Dumont D’Urville.90 In 1828, Pickering sent his “Fegee Vocabulary” notes to his longtime German correspondent Wilhelm von Humboldt, who shared with Pickering the view that language investigation necessitated a global, comparative framework. As European philologists amassed and published compendia of the world’s languages, the Pacific was underrepresented, and Humboldt greatly "
