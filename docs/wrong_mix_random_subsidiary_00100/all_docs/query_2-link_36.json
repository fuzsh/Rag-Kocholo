        "text": "Brian McFadden, a Partner in Hoagland, Longo, Moran, Dunst & Doukas’ Family Law Department, is ready and prepared to help you with your family law matter. Whether you are going through a divorce, separation, or are involved in domestic violence, child custody, alimony, child support or parenting time issues, Brian is qualified and ready to stand with you and provide you with the steady guidance you need to get you through your case. Brian is available to provide consultations on family law matters and can be reached directly at bmcfaddendinicola@hoaglandlongo.com, or you can call to schedule an appointment with him at (732) 545-4717. Contact him today to get the advice you need.\n\nBrian has been awarded a prestigious AV Preeminent rating by Martindale Hubbell, which is determined through legal peer reviews and only provided to lawyers with the highest ethical standards and professional ability. Brian is also certified by the Supreme Court of New Jersey as a Matrimonial Law Attorney. The Board on Attorney Certification was established by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in 1980 for the purpose of helping consumers find attorneys who have a recognized level of competence in particular fields of law. Attorneys may be designated by the Supreme Court as \"certified attorneys\" if they: are able to demonstrate sufficient levels of experience, education, knowledge and skill in a specific area of law or practice; have passed a rigorous examination; and have been recognized by their peers as having sufficient skills and reputation in the designated specialty.\n\nBrian is a Rule 1:40 Qualified Mediator, admitted to the New Jersey Superior Court’s list of mediators for economic mediation in divorce matters. He received these accolades for his quality representation and experience litigating matters before the New Jersey’s Trial Courts and at the Appellate Division, and the reputation he has earned in alternative dispute resolution settings, amicably resolving favorable agreements for his clients.\n\nBrian’s practice and no-nonsense approach to family law has been strongly influenced by his experience overseeing thousands of divorce and custody cases annually, while working in the Family Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Middlesex Vicinage, in the early 2000s. This practical experience instilled in Brian a sense of the overwhelming issues clients face when going through the difficult process of divorce. He also understands that the litigation process in the Courts is imperfect and challenging, even in the best of circumstances. He is a strong believer in Alternative Dispute Resolution methods for resolving cases, but he understands and has significant experience with the cases and issues that must be litigated. He has successfully tried many cases to conclusion and made successful appearances defending trial results in the Appellate Division.\n\nBrian practices throughout the State of New Jersey, frequently appearing in Middlesex, Union, Somerset, Mercer and Monmouth Counties. He volunteers as a Family Law panelist at the Middlesex County Court in the Early Settlement Panel program. He is also a member of the Middlesex County Bar Association and their family law section, which recently honored him with the Martin S. Goldin Family Law Award.\n\nAffiliations\n\nEarly Settlement Panel of Middlesex County\n\nSuperior Court of New Jersey Roster of Economic Mediators for Divorce\n\nMiddlesex County Bar Association, Trustee\n\nMiddlesex County Assignment Judge’s Family Lawyers Committee\n\nCertified by the Supreme Court of New Jersey as a Matrimonial Law Attorney\n\nManavi Legal Clinic, Volunteer\n\nWomen Aware Legal Clinic, Volunteer\n\nAwards"
