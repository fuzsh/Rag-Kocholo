        "text": "This database core, desktop client and administration platform is the prerequisite for all HxGN NetWorks deployments.\n\nHxGN NetWorks Core enables operators to maintain a definitive source of reliable, location-based information describing their network and its connectivity and share with users and systems across their organization.\n\nIt delivers records that are more accurate, consistent and current by applying intelligent, rules-driven tools that streamline and enhance the processes for designing and documenting the network. It is able to assess, manage and track the status of projects, equipment and connections and coordinate with other business systems to manage the full engineering lifecycle.\n\nThese secure web services extend HxGN NetWorks Core workflows across the enterprise, allowing other HxGN NetWorks applications and external applications to integrate with NetWorks Core.\n\nHxGN NetWorks Web Services provides secure, real-time access to location-based engineering and operational data and capabilities across the enterprise. By leveraging web services to simplify the development and maintenance of interfaces, integrations and task-oriented portals and mobile applications, HxGN NetWorks Web Services connects the enterprise to the HxGN NetWorks Core network model, making it available and usable wherever needed.\n\nEasy to configure and powerful to use, HxGN NetWorks Web Services unlocks value in existing geospatial investments; enhances the reach, quality and currency of enterprise information; and improves business processes and capabilities.\n\nHxGN NetWorks Comms enables utilities, communications providers and local governments to design, document, administer, analyze, maintain and manage their fiber optic networks.\n\nHxGN NetWorks Comms is an advanced telecommunications GIS that provides location-based information and tools for the complete lifecycle of civil infrastructure and fiber network management – from design and construction to maintenance and operations, in the back office and the field. It facilitates key business processes, such as work order design and execution, mapping, asset records management and maintenance records of the entire system.\n\nIts feature-rich interface helps plan, connect and deploy fiber networks, supporting full tracing capabilities, fault analysis and path redundancy. It can assess, manage and track the status of projects, equipment and connections and coordinate with other systems to model the full engineering lifecycle.\n\nWith the HxGN NetWorks Utilities suite, numerous pre-configured modules, branch-specific data models and functions for various supply networks (including gas, water, electricity and multi-utility) are available, which ensure optimal support for utility-specific work processes.\n\nEVU-specific process chains can be designed effectively and economically using these tried-and-tested tools and functionalities. Work steps such as recording and documentation, planning, mobile use, maintenance and management of the entire infrastructure can be fully supported.\n\nThis suite of modules is used for importing, exporting, analyzing, quality control and protection of valuable network and company data.\n\nDiverse import and export functionalities / tools ensure that seamless work and smooth workflows are possible across system boundaries.\n\nAnalyst tools support the user with workflows for creating, maintaining and providing customer-specific queries for targeted analyses and evaluations of existing company data.\n\nHxGN NetWorks Data also offers tools for integrated data protection, data history management and effective process-integrated data quality management.\n\nThese effective and cost-saving internet map services help users coordinate “call before you dig” concerns between other utilities and customers.\n\nThe provision of maps and additional information related to underground pipes and cables is an integral service offered by utility and grid operators. With HxGN NetWorks B4U Dig, organizations in this field can efficiently and affordably provide these services. Similarly, construction firms, planning offices and other external users can radically reduce the time to obtain a provision after an information request.\n\nThis suite enables utilities and grid operators to provide planning information efficiently and securely using a web portal. It offers a consistent and integrated workflow that supports planning information and automated documentation of complete information processes.\n\nUtilities and grid operators will benefit from this user-friendly, cost-saving solution with its guarantee of open and secure planning information. Important safety aspects are seamlessly integrated into the solution workflow."
