        "text": "Government Regulations\n\nThe government potentially has several regulations that can impact data security requirements.\n\nFor example, in the United States the Privacy Act, HIPAA, Sarbanes-Oxley, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, SEC and other agency regulations, and various other accounting and reporting requirements. Similar regulations in other countries include national privacy acts, transborder data flow regulations, and accounting and taxing regulations. Also, consider any state, provincial, or other local regulations.\n\nLegal Requirements\n\nMany legal requirements are tied to government regulations, such as requirements about controls over Electronic Fund Transfers. Others can be contractual, such as union agreements (unauthorized employee record accessibility). You can be subject to other requirements if you operate as a service bureau and have contractual agreements with customers about the confidentiality and protection of their data and programs.\n\nIndustry Practices and Agreements\n\nSome industries share certain data, while many highly competitive industries tightly guard much of their data. In some areas, the possibility of industrial espionage can be a factor. Using access control software and personal passwords for individual identities are examples of data security.\n\nSabotage, White Collar Crime, and Computer Frauds\n\nWeigh threats from external forces and internal forces.\n\nComputer virus\n\nSpyware\n\nHackers and predators\n\nPhishing threats\n\nGood Business Practices\n\nExisting Corporate Policies\n\nAlmost every company or agency has some written policies already in place. Many of them do not relate to data or system security. Others are due to the factors previously mentioned and can be reviewed as part of these other areas. Identify and consider all existing policies relating to data security, access control, and computer control auditability when you select\n\nACF2\n\noptions and build an overall security plan. Do not overlook future policies because they are probably easier to implement and enforce if you consider them when designing the initial overall plan.\n\nOrganizational Impact\n\nSites usually want to implement data security that is transparent to users. While\n\nACF2\n\nprovides options to assist in its implementation and transition phases, these alone do not make security transparent. Normally, a site is changing from little or no data access control to significant controls. This is a big difference that cannot be totally transparent. With the proper planning, education, and phased implementation,\n\nACF2\n\ncan alleviate most problems and even create a positive, progressive attitude among users.\n\nThe IT can also make organizational decisions about how to implement\n\nACF2\n\n. These decisions include separation of function and centralization or decentralization in the administration of\n\nACF2\n\nand related controls.\n\nProcedure Enforcement Needs"
