        "text": "draw.io, this project, is a configurable diagramming/whiteboarding visualization application. draw.io is jointly owned and developed by JGraph Ltd and draw.io AG.\n\nAs well as running this project, we run a production-grade deployment of the diagramming interface at https://app.diagrams.net.\n\nThe source code authored by us in this repo is licensed under the Apache v2. The full core is open source, but there are some boundary functions that are difficult to publish in a way we can maintain them.\n\nThe JGraph provided icons and diagram templates are licensed under the CC BY 4.0. Additional terms may also apply where the icons are originally defined by a third-party copyright holder. We have checked in all cases that the original license allows use in this project. Also see the terms for using the draw.io logo below.\n\nAdditional minified JavaScript files and Java libraries are used in this project. All of the licenses are deemed compatible with the Apache 2.0, nothing is GPL or AGPL, due diligence is performed on all third-party code.\n\nWe make no copyright claim on the content you create with this software, regardless of the copyright of individual icons used in such content.\n\ndraw.io is a diagramming or whiteboarding application, depending on which theme is selected. It is not an SVG editing app, the SVG export is designed only for embedding in web pages, not for further editing in other tools.\n\nThe application is designed to be used largely as-is. draw.io is not suitable as a framework for building other products from. For this try either Tldraw or Excalidraw.\n\nNote, in particular, we don't have support for collaborative editing in this project. If this is important, one of the projects above is likely a better choice.\n\nIf you are using a draw.io project/product and have issues or questions about the editor itself, the issue tracker and discussion in this GitHub project are likely a good place to look.\n\nOne way to run draw.io is to fork this project, publish the master branch to GitHub pages and the pages sites will have the full editor functionality (sans the integrations).\n\nAnother way is to use the recommended Docker project or to download draw.io Desktop.\n\nThe full packaged .war of the client and servlets is built when the project is tagged and available on the releases page.\n\ndraw.io supports Chrome 98+, Firefox 94+, Safari 15.4+, Opera 84+, WebView Android 98+, Safari iOS 15.4+ and Edge 98+.\n\ndraw.io is also closed to contributions. We follow a development process compliant with our SOC 2 Type II process. We do not have a mechanism where we can accept contributions from non-staff members.\n\ndraw.io is not suitable as a framework for building other products from. For this try either Tldraw or Excalidraw.\n\ndraw.io is a registered EU trademark, #018062448\n\nDo not use the draw.io name or any draw.io logo in a way that suggests you are JGraph, your offering or project is by JGraph, or that JGraph is endorsing you or your offering or project.\n\nDo not use any draw.io logo as the icon or logo for your business/organization, offering, project, domain name, social media account, or website.\n\nDo not modify the permitted draw.io logos, including changing the color, dimensions, or combining with other words or design elements.\n\nDo not use JGraph trademarks or logos without JGraphâ€™s prior written permission."
