        "text": "A. As of 2022-2023, six MPD leaders have been enrolled in the Federal Bureau of Investigations National Academy (FBINA); At present, 4 members have graduated.\n\nB. Enrolled 6 MPD leaders into the Senior Management Institute for Police Leadership course (SMIP) at Boston University–Police Executive Research Forum (PERF)\n\nC. Reorganized the police department to align similar functions and responsibilities to create operational efficiency and effectiveness:\n\n1. A Strategic and Special Projects Section was created to manage CALEA and conduct planning and research activities to implement “best practices”. As well as creating new written policies, this section reviews existing policies and updates them if necessary.\n\n2. Created External Relations to ensure a proper relationship could be established and maintained with our stakeholders (e.g., courts, community, etc.).\n\n3. Aligned Patrol Operations under a single Deputy Chief. A Colonel was added along with other support staff. The Patrol Division’s office was moved to 2714 Union Extended to support the division’s overall functional responsibilities.\n\n4. Divided the Investigations Bureau into a Crimes Against Persons section and a Crimes Against Property section. A Colonel is assigned to oversee both sections.\n\n5. Separated The Traffic Unit from the Special Services Section and renamed it the Traffic Section.\n\n6. Aligned the Grants Unit with the Finance Division in order to ensure consistent accounting principles across all MPD financial units. In addition, the PIO’s office has been overhauled to add more sworn staff with specific responsibilities and a media professional with broadcast experience.\n\n7. Created the Fugitive Unit on February 22, 2022, for the purpose of locating and apprehending violent offenders, who are fugitives from justice. The “Memphis Most Wanted” webpage, which was a part of the new unit was officially launched on April 7, 2022.\n\n8. Created the Gun Crimes Unit to investigate and apprehend those individuals responsible for aggravated assaults involving the use and/or displaying of a firearm.\n\nD. Recruited and hired more than 390 new police recruits over the past 24 months.\n\nE. In 2023, the department graduated 25 police commanders in the inaugural “Memphis Police Leadership Academy.” This is a 5-week leadership course developed and conducted in partnership with the University of Tennessee.\n\nF. Created the first-line supervisor rank of 2nd Lieutenant to fill the supervisory void at the line level. Approximately 125 patrol supervisor positions were created while expanding career options for officers.\n\nG. Modified the promotional process to include tenured commissioned officers; ensuring that a wide range of experienced officers can participate in the promotional process, essentially adding career advancement opportunities at all levels of the police hierarchy.\n\nH. Re-established the Special Traffic Enforcement Unit (STEU) unit to focus on traffic enforcement and investigations.\n\nI. Consolidated patrol shifts from four to three 8-hour shifts to redistribute manpower to cover peak periods.\n\nJ. Expanded the (C.O.P.) Community Outreach Program by creating 50 Community Impact Officer positions. Moreover, the unit partnered with the Parks Division to co-locate and offer Park activities to those associated with the Police Athletic League (PAL).\n\nK. Expanded the size of the Motors Unit, adding nine new officers to help facilitate services."
