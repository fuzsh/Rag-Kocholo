        "text": "911 Computerized Telephony\n\nComputerized telephony provides a redundant, secure, and robust emergency telephone network. All wireless (cellular) carriers have been placed on the District’s own selective router. Once all carriers are connected directly, the District will be the first and only Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) in the nation to accept and route calls within an independent, municipally-owned infrastructure.\n\n311 Telephony and System Application\n\nThe DC 311 telephony system processes over 1.8 million annual calls, including city information and city service requests. In April 2015, the OUC migrated to a Level 3 SIP Solution.\n\nThe OUC uses a cloud-based, customer relationship management (CRM) application, Salesforce. This application is built on a reliable infrastructure that provides an enhanced experience for the end-user, customer, partner agencies, and API providers. Salesforce provides improved functionality, enhanced data interoperability, and security through an API, and enhanced reporting features. Salesforce also allows the OUC to push critical upgrades with minimum disruption to operational workflow.\n\nComputer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) and Associated Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\n\nThe OUC's CAD system is an online, real-time collection of critical services and applications designed to enhance emergency communications center and field operations. The OUC's CAD system typically processes over 800,000 dispatched events annually. These technologies use computerized mapping and analytical features to track and display AVL/GPS-equipped fire and police units and helps dispatchers make recommendations by finding the closest and best-equipped units for any given emergency.\n\nEmergency Dispatch Instruction Software\n\nThis software enables OUC staff to provide 911 callers with life-saving, pre-arrival instructions over the phone. These instructions can help District callers stabilize and, in some cases, save the lives of patients during the vital seconds between the 911 call and unit arrival.\n\nTDD/TTY Computerized Systems\n\nThese systems instantly recognize TDD/TTY calls from citizens who are deaf or hard of hearing. The systems provide customized, pre-programmed phrases that enable call-takers to speak directly to the TDD/TTY devices.\n\nComputerized Radio Dispatch Systems Consoles\n\nThese consoles connect OUC staff with both handheld and mobile radio systems used by police, fire, and emergency medical services.\n\nRedundant Trunked Radio Network\n\nThis network comprises nearly a dozen radio towers connected by a computerized master controller. The controller contains the master radio database and acts as the primary point for audio path control within the network. Each tower site can also function independently, providing first responders with the solid redundant communications they need.\n\nComputerized Recording Systems\n\nThese systems provide both operational and legal protection. They allow OUC personnel to instantly replay the last 20 minutes of calls made to the center. They are also used for training, quality assurance, and, in some cases, various legal proceedings."
