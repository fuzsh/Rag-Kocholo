(TSXV: TTGI) (\"Turnium\" or \"the Company\"), an industry leader in cloud-native software-defined wide area networking solutions (SD-WAN), announces that its partner, Netview Consulting Inc. (\"Netview\") has deployed Turnium to improve access to community-based services in 30 remote communities spread across Northern Ontario.\n\nNetview deployed Turnium to combine multiple landline, wireless, or Starlink satellite connections at community-based locations. This solution enables a community-based organization to support its stakeholders and overcome challenges posted by the vast area of Northern Ontario, the distance, and the quality of available connectivity solutions.\n\nMike Millar, Principal at Netview Consulting Inc. said, \"Turnium is one of the solutions that we provide to customers that need to improve the reliability of connections to the internet and to cloud services. Many of these sites are accessible by floatplane only. Turnium's solution greatly improves performance, speed, and reliability of voice, video, and other hosted or internet-based applications that are critical to delivering on our customer's mission and mandate.\"\n\nObtaining usable connections at each location was a considerable issue, as often only dial-up speeds of 100 kilobits per second speed were available. Such extremely low speed access made it impossible to use cloud-based applications, video conferencing, or deploy IP-based telephone services.\n\nThis project delivers good network performance and enables support for future applications by aggregating broadband services, satellite internet, and fiber connections at larger locations. To deliver a single, cohesive network, Turnium SD-WAN is used to connect all offices and provide visibility and control.\n\nTurnium is an independent software developer and vendor that has been building software-defined wide-area networking software since 2012. Turnium software can be hosted, deployed, managed, branded, and bundled into integrated solutions by its channel partners to enhance the customer experience of the internet and their hosted, managed services. Turnium is also available for resale as a Turnium-branded managed service.\n\nAbout Netview Consulting\n\nFounded in 2002, Netview Consulting provides business networking and cyber security solutions to mid-market businesses in Canada and the USA.
