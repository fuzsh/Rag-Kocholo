        "text": "Hi Ty! Unfortunately, as you have found, the .NET Windows Forms CR viewer does not provide the copy function. We will have to investigate this as a new feature for the next release.\n\nIn the meantime, the only workaorund I was able to find is to use the WinForm (CrystalReportViewer class) viewer's ClickPage() event which provides a PageMouseEventArgs object which you can use to get the text of the object clicked on the report. You can find more information in [SAP Note 1202102|http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/servlet/prt/portal/prtroot/com.sap.km.cm.docs/oss_notes_boj/sdn_oss_boj_dev/sap(bD1lbiZjPTAwMQ==)/bc/bsp/spn/scn_bosap/notes%7B6163636573733d36393736354636443646363436353344333933393338323636393736354637333631373036453646373436353733354636453735364436323635373233443330333033303331333233303332333133303332%7D.do].\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nThanks for the information, Mandeep. We're already acting on the CrystalReportViewer.DoubleClickPage() event, so I suppose we could use ClickPage() to show a context menu or something -- but that doesn't quite get us the the user-friendly solution we need. Rather than Right Click --> Copy, the user should be able to hit Ctrl+C to copy the text in the currently-selected field.\n\nWhat if we acted on the KeyDown() event or something -- is there any way to ask the CrystalReportViewer control what (if any) the currently selected field is? Or some other event? With the DoubleClickPage() event, we get e.ObjectInfo to query for information like field name and text; but KeyDown is simply inherited from System.Windows.Forms.Control, so we get no Crystal-specific data in the \"e\" argument.\n\nIt would be a shame to have to write this ourselves (add it to a growing list of functionality we lost when moving from the RDC to the .NET viewer); but we can do it if possible, we just need some help on how to drill into the CrystalReportViewer's object model to find helpful clues.\n\nSounds like you've already gone down the path of using the (Double)ClickPage events. Unfortunately, the viewer does not expose the ObjectInfo class in any other event. I agree that using the ClickPage event is not the best solution, but it's currently the only solution I can think of. I don't think you will be able to write your own KeyDown (or any other event) and provide the same information as ObjectInfo does. We will have to look into providing the copy functionality in the next release."
