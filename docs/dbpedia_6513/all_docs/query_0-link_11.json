        "text": "In case you are or someone in your company is still using the “old” Netviewer one2meet release today, please be informed about alternatives.\n\nIn order to facilitate a smooth transition from Netviewer one2meet to another SAP remote connection type, SAP has decided to upgrade Netviewer one2meet to version 6.4 and thus extend the available time window for the customers. This temporary and interim solution will be until the end of December 2016.\n\nAfter this period, it will be mandatory for all customers to replace the Netviewer one2meet with an alternative SAP remote connection type. SAP currently supports several remote connection types, e.g: VNC, WTS, WTS with NLA, Citrix Xen App, GoToAssist. Please click here for more information on available connection types.\n\nFurther information on requirements and possibilities for Netviewer one2meet, can also be found here.\n\n< Back to all news"
