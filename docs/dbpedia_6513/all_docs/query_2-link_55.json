        "text": "The enviolet GmbH has been producing high quality units since April 2012 in a new manufacturing process specially developed to supply the best and highly reliable products. 2016 and 2018 we expanded our capacities in Karlsruhe Factory:\n\nabout 570 m² for project managment, administration, laboratory and clean-room\n\nabout 1200 m² for production\n\nabout 50% of our energy is produced by our cogeneration unit and PV\n\nThis enables us to be more efficient while optimizing our services and protecting the environment already at the first stage of the manufacturing of your installation.\n\nIn 2018 was opened our factory in China, operated by Gungzhou Enviolet Umweltechnology Ltd.\n\nIn 2019 we have opened a third factory in Germany, owned and operated by a.c.k. aqua concept GmbH.\n\nMore\n\nWe combine a state-of-the art UV technology with additional chemical, physical or biological process steps to create an innovative unit in wastewater treatment.\n\nUV oxidation processes are very sustainable and climate-friendly processes, particularly in the wastewater treatment of organic ingredients. With UV oxidation, problematic substances are actually removed and destroyed. The UV oxidation can transform toxic, mutagenic or poorly degradable substances in such a way that they are degraded, or they can be fed to an equally environmentally friendly biological oxidation. With these processes, organic ingredients are disposed of sustainably with a minimal CO2 footprint.\n\nWastewater treatment processes such as evaporation or membrane technology that enrich a problem substance in a concentrate phase do not solve a problem. Often a lot of energy (= CO2) is expended for evaporation and the concentrate then goes to the incineration, where water is sent through a flame with the formation of an extremely large amount of CO2. Wastewater treatment cannot be less sustainable. The real solution is not far away and is usually much cheaper, because the conservation of resources is usually reflected in lower operating costs, you need less energy, less chemicals, fewer raw materials, ....\n\nenviolet stands for substancial and sustainable solution and not for relocating problems!\n\nMore"
