When this option and 'Put Icon On Tray' option are turned on, the main window of Wireless Network Watcher will be invisible on start.\n\nVersion 1.35\n\nAdded 'MAC Address Format' option, under the Options menu.\n\nCopy MAC Address option now allows you to copy multiple MAC addresses.\n\nVersion 1.32\n\nAdded new menu items to the tray context menu: Start Scanning, Stop Scanning, and Advanced Options.\n\nVersion 1.31\n\nFixed the sorting of the IP Address column.\n\nVersion 1.30\n\nAdded command-line options to scan your network and save the result into text/html/xml file, without displaying any user interface.\n\nVersion 1.27\n\nAdded 'Automatically Copy Device Name To User Text' option. When it's turn on, the user text of new device is automatically filled with the name of the device.\n\nVersion 1.26\n\nAdded 'Scan On Program Start' option. You can turn off this option if you don't want that Wireless Network Watcher will start scanning automatically when you run it.\n\nVersion 1.25\n\nAdded option to choose the desired IP addresses range to scan. (In the 'Advanced Options' window)\n\nVersion 1.20\n\nAdded 'Put Icon On Tray' option. When it's turned on, icon of Wireless Network Watcher is added to the system tray of Windows.\n\nAdded 'Tray Balloon On New Device' option. If it's turned on, Wireless Network Watcher displays a tray balloon when a new device is detected.\n\nVersion 1.15\n\nAdded 'Background Scan', under the Options menu. When this option is turned on, Wireless Network Watcher make a continuous background scan to automatically discover new devices or computers that connected the network, without activating the scan again. The background scan is slower and less intensive then the regular scan, so it won't overload your computer.\n\nAdded 'Beep On New Device' option. When the background scan is turned on, you can use this option to get a 'beep' sound when a new device is detected.\n\nVersion 1.10\n\nAdded 'User Text' column, which allows to enter your own text for a specific computer/device, from the Properties window (Alt+Enter). The text that you write will be displayed for the same device in future scans. (The devices information is stored in the .cfg file of Wireless Network Watcher)\n\nWireless Network Watcher now displays the first date/time that the specified device was found, and the number of times that the device was detected. (The information is saved in the .cfg file)\n\nWhen there are multiple IP address blocks on a single network card, Wireless Network Watcher now scans all of them (In previous versions, it scanned only the first IP addresses block)\n\nFixed bug: In previous version, Wireless Network Watcher randomly skipped some devices after the scanning the first 64 IP addresses.\n\nVersion 1.05\n\nFixed Wireless Network Watcher to scan the entire network when the subnet mask is not 255.255.255.0, for example, if the subnet mask is 255.255.254.0, Wireless Network Watcher will scan 512 addresses. For now, it's limited for up to 4096 IP addresses, to avoid from very long scanning.\n\nImproved the scanning on slow computers or slow networks.\n\nVersion 1.00 - First release.\n\nUsing Wireless Network Watcher\n\nWireless Network Watcher doesn't require any installation process or additional dll files. In order to start using it, simply extract the executable file (WNetWatcher.exe) from the zip file, and run it.\n\nIf you want, you can also download WNetWatcher with full install/uninstall support (wnetwatcher_setup.exe), so a shortcut for running WNetWatcher will be automatically added into your start menu.\n\nAfter running WNetWatcher, it automatically locates your wireless adapter, and scans your network. After a few seconds, you should start see the list of computers that are currently connected to your network.\n\nIf from some reason, WNetWatcher failed to locate and scan your network, you can try to manually choosing the correct network adapter, by pressing F9 (Advanced Options) and choosing the right network adapter.\n\nColumns Description\n\nIP Address: IP Address of the device or computer.\n\nDevice Name: The name of the device or computer. This field may remain empty if the computer or the device doesn't provide its name.\n\nMAC Address: The MAC address of the network adapter.\n\nNetwork Adapter Company: The company that manufactured the network adapter, according to the MAC Address. This column can help you to detect the type of the device or computer. For example, if the company name is Apple, the device is probably a Mac computer, iPhone, or iPad.\n\nif the company name is Nokia, the device is probably a cellular phone of Nokia.\n\nBy default, this utility uses an internal MAC addresses database stored inside the .exe file, but it's not always updated with the latest MAC address assignments.\n\nYou can manually download the latest MAC addresses file from http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.txt and then put oui.txt in the same folder where WNetWatcher.exe is located. When you run WNetWatcher.exe, it'll automatically load and use the external oui.txt instead of the internal MAC addresses database.\n\nDevice Information: This column displays 'Your Computer' if the device is the computer that you currently use. This column displays 'Your Router' if the device is the wireless router.\n\nUser Text: You can assign your own text to any device detected by WNetWatcher. By default, this field is filled with the device name. In order to change the User Text, simply double-click the item and type the desired text.\n\nActive: Specifies whether this device is currently active. When a device is not detected anymore, the 'Active' value is turned from 'Yes' to 'No'\n\nDetection Count: Number of times that this device was detected on your network. Every time that a network scan is running and the device is detected, this value is increased by one.\n\nFirst Detected On: The first time that this device was detected.\n\nLast Detected On: The last time that this device was detected.\n\nBackground Scan\n\nStarting from version 1.15, there is a new option under the Options menu - 'Background Scan'.\n\nWhen it's turned on, Wireless Network Watcher first make the regular fast network scan to discover all current connected devices. After that, a continuous background scan is activated to discover when new devices are connected to your network. The background scan is slower and less intensive then the regular scan, so it won't overload your computer and you can leave it to run in the background while using other programs.\n\nWhen the background scan is running, a counter of the scan process is displayed in the second section of the bottom status bar.\n\nWhen the background scan is used, you can use the 'Beep On New Device' option to get a beep sound when a new device is detected.\n\nCustom Context Menu\n\nStarting from version 2.30, you can add your own custom menu items into the context menu of Wireless Network Watcher.\n\nIn order to do this, you have to exit completely from Wireless Network Watcher and then edit the WNetWatcher.cfg file, located in the same folder of WNetWatcher.exe. You can edit WNetWatcher.cfg with notepad or any other text editor.\n\nThe structure of the custom menu configuration is very simple, and looks like this:\n\n[CustomMenu] Caption0=Menu Caption Command0=Menu Command Caption1=Menu Caption Command1=Menu Command Caption2=Menu Caption Command2=Menu Command . . .\n\nYou can create up to 10 different menu items (from 0 to 9). The command string is an executable file with parameters that provide the information about the selected items.\n\nFor example, the following menu item will ping the selected IP address in a command-prompt window:\n\n[CustomMenu] Caption0=Ping This IP address Command0=cmd.exe /K ping %IPAddress%\n\nWireless Network Watcher will replace the %IPAddress% variable with the IP address of the selected device. You can use the following variables for the custom menu command (They are identical to the column names, but without the space characters): %IPAddress% %DeviceName% %MACAddress% %NetworkAdapterCompany% %DeviceInformation% %UserText% %FirstDetectedOn% %LastDetectedOn% %DetectionCount% %Active%\n\nFinally, here's an example for full custom menu items. Notice that Caption3 and Caption6 are actually a menu separator. Also, Command7 is a 'ShellExecute' command, which means that instead of specifying .exe file, you specify a file, URL, or network resource to open (In this case it's Admin share of the remote computer).\n\n[CustomMenu] Caption0=Ping IP address Command0=cmd.exe /K ping %IPAddress% Caption1=Ping Host Name Command1=cmd.exe /K ping %DeviceName% Caption2=Check IP Address With Nbtstat Command2=cmd.exe /K nbtstat.exe -A %IPAddress% Caption3=- Caption4=Open IP Address In Chrome Command4=chrome.exe %IPAddress% Caption5=Open IP Address In Firefox Command5=Firefox.exe %IPAddress% Caption6=- Caption7=Open Admin Share Command7=ShellExecute:\\\\%IPAddress%\\Admin$\n\nThe custom menu of the above example looks like this:\n\nCommand-Line Options\n\n/cfg <Filename> Start Wireless Network Watcher with the specified configuration file. For example:\n\nWNetWatcher.exe /cfg \"c:\\config\\wnw.cfg\"\n\nWNetWatcher.exe /cfg \"%AppData%\\WNetWatcher.cfg\" /stext <Filename> Scan your network, and save the network devices list into a regular text file. /stab <Filename> Scan your network, and save the network devices list into a tab-delimited text file. /scomma <Filename> Scan your network, and save the network devices list into a comma-delimited text file (csv). /stabular <Filename> Scan your network, and save the network devices list into a tabular text file. /shtml <Filename> Scan your network, and save the network devices list into HTML file (Horizontal). /sverhtml <Filename> Scan your network, and save the network devices list into HTML file (Vertical). /sxml <Filename> Scan your network, and save the network devices list into XML file.\n\nTranslating Wireless Network Watcher to other languages\n\nIn order to translate Wireless Network Watcher to other language, follow the instructions below:\n\nRun Wireless Network Watcher with /savelangfile parameter:\n\nWNetWatcher.exe /savelangfile\n\nA file named WNetWatcher_lng.ini will be created in the folder of WNetWatcher utility.\n\nOpen the created language file in Notepad or in any other text editor.\n\nTranslate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally, you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site. (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information, it'll be used in the 'About' window.\n\nAfter you finish the translation, Run WNetWatcher, and all translated strings will be loaded from the language file.\n\nIf you want to run WNetWatcher without the translation, simply rename the language file, or move it to another folder.\n\nLicense\n\nThis utility is released as freeware.
