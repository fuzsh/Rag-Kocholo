        "text": "Our healthcare organization has been run for 25 years by the same core people. Consequently change to digital systems has not happened. They still do EVERYTHING on paper, from accounting to patient/client/personnel records. We have a new CIO and we are setting plans in motion to start getting away from paper. One thing that is pushing the issue is in one of our states they need to downsize the office they are in by 2/3rds. There are too many fireproof file cabinets of paperwork that needs to be be kept for 10 years to move. I estimate there are 800,000 to 1 million pages of documents that will need to be scanned. Luckily each page doesn’t need to be made into a unique electronic file. For example: all of the papers for John Doe from 2013 can be scanned into one PDF file. So that will speed things up having 50-100 pages scanned into one file.\n\nQuestions: (budget is a huge issue…)\n\nHow many TB of data is 1 million pages of this kind of data?\n\nWhat would be the least expensive way to store this amount of data (encrypted) Ultimately these files are hoped to be incorporated into a document management system, but for now, I need to plan on these being in a stable condition for 10 years.\n\nWe need to have HIPPA complaint encryption. Right now we encrypt laptops with Bitlocker. Can we use Bitlocker for this? Is there a better way to do this?\n\nAny suggestions for how to proceed on such a daunting task would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI’d scan to TIFF files. It’s a horribly big file format, but has been around forever and is an industry standard in document/image storage. Scan at at least 200 DPI, since this is “fine” fax resolution. I’d recommend 300 DPI because that is a fairly standard printer/copier resolution.\n\nAS far as storage size, you’re looking at around 5 MB per page @ 300 DPI, so 5 TB is the neighborhood to start with. Most indexing systems support good encryption, but they are definitely not cheap. It’s going to be a pain to convert everything to another system down the road, so pick a good one now and stick with it, even though it’ll be more expensive. Paperport is a fair system for this type of project, but it may not support encryption. If that is the case, you can use TrueCrypt to encrypt your data.\n\nWow, there’ s a lot of paper there that you may never touch, but document retention is document retention…\n\nSeriously for that amount of volume, your scanning requirements, and everything, check out Laserfiche Document Management. We’ve been running it since about 2005 and now our users can’t live without it (we’re a medical billing office that processes all kinds of written and typed documents, including patient charts).\n\nFor best use in a DMS later on (if you don’t use it now), TIF files are generally recommended and are better for OCR’ing the images. And if this something that needs to be worked on sooner than later, there’s metadata to consider for faster searching and retrieval.\n\nGenerally speaking you’re looking at 24Kb per PAGE at 150 DPI. Anything over 150 DPI in some systems might be overkill.\n\nFor reference, we have several volumes across three companies holding about 7-10 years worth of data (including back-scanned documents) and we’re pushing about 900GB - 1TB of data. This doesn’t including the SQL server running on a different server.\n\nAs far as encryption is concerned I believe it will handle it just fine, considering there is a server / datastore / DB element that are separate, but it’s worth checking with a VAR to see if that will work.\n\nMy biggest concern is the backup during the scanning so we’re covered and won’t lose a day or more of data. I did some searching and found Box.com/enterprise as a great solution. We only need 2 users (the scanner and me) during the scanning. It’s $35/ month/user, HIPAA compliant, 5gb file size limit, unlimited storage. Once the project is done we’ll move it somewhere else. This addresses all my concerns, even integrates with our AD. Now to get this implemented so we can start scanning next week!\n\nBoy did I open Pandora’s Box! Our company has a strict HIPPA policy that no patient data is ever to be placed in cloud storage. I’m pushing the new CIO on this one. He’s also the new information security officer so he’s begun the long process of educating all the members of the HIPPA team, which includes several lawyers, so this won’t be a quick process. Amazing the Luddites around here!\n\nFor now we scan to external USB HD’s. How secure is that? For now? Not my problem. I’ve expressed all my concerns, came up with the best practice, came up with the proper, industry accepted methods. Now it’s out of my hands."
