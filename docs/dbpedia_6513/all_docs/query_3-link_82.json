        "text": "The easiest way to view images through NetcamViewer Monitor is to select the camera brand and enter the IP address, username and password.\n\nIf this does not lead to the desired result, the following step-by-step plan can be used:\n\n1. Make sure the camera password does not contain any special characters. Some characters can cause confusion, so no image is retrieved.\n\n2. Check whether you can log in to the camera directly via the web browser with the specified user name and password.\n\n3. If the camera supports Onvif protocol, learn how to enable it on the camera. Sometimes a separate Onvif user needs to be created. This is brand dependent. Under \"Brand\" you can then select \"Onvif\" in the NetcamViewer monitor.\n\n4. It is also possible to enter an RTSP URL directly. This can be done in the advanced settings when adding a camera.\n\nYou can find the RTSP path of the camera on this website:\n\nhttps://www.ispyconnect.com/ca...\n\nUnder RTSP Path, enter the entire image path: rtsp://<username>:<password>@<ipad_camera>:<rtsp-port>/<image_path_to_the_stream>\n\nOmit the various variables and the \">\".\n\nExample: rtsp://root:pass@192.168.5.90:554/video.h264\n\nThe image path can also be tested in the program VLC (https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). If the stream from the camera doesn't play in it, it won't work in the NetcamViewer Monitor either.\n\nIf the camera is not on the same network, both the HTTP port (typically 80) and the RTSP port (typically 554) in the internet connection of the router on the camera must be forwarded to the camera. For more information, visit https://portforward.com\n\nSome cameras support multiple channels that need to be configured in the camera. The NetcamViewer monitor only supports H264 with a maximum resolution of FullHD (1920x1080) in single view. Choose a lower resolution for multi-view display, depending on the desired number of cameras in the picture (1/2 for dual and quad view and 1/3 for 6 or 9 view).\n\nNetcamViewer Monitor only supports MJPEG and H264 streams. Check whether the camera also supports this.\n\nIn order to display an image from the camera in the overview, the JPEG path can also be entered. This can be looked up and constructed in the same way. The JPEG path can be tested in a web browser.\n\nDownload the complete list of HDMI API Commands and modes:\n\nhttps://netcamcenter.nl/media/...\n\nChange HDMI mode via API:\n\nStandard the communication between the TV or monitor and the NetcamViewer Monitor takes place via the HDMI cable.\n\nIf the automatic settings are not correct it is possible to change them via the API HDMI mode.\n\nAPI:\n\nhttp://[IPADRES]/commands/set-hdmi/[GROUP]-[MODUS]\n\nThe default state of the NetcamViewer Monitor is set to group 0: auto detect. The groups (if group 1 or 2 is specified) must be used together with the appropriate mode.\n\nThe most common group is 1 (CEA).\n\nThe most common resolutions are 1080p and 720p, both on 60Hz.\n\nThis results in the following common API commands:\n\nhttp://[IPADRESS]/commands/set-hdmi/1-16 (1080p)\n\nhttp://[IPADRESS]/commands/set-hdmi/1-4 (for 720p)\n\nAfterwards the NetcamViewer Monitor will restart.\n\nOther HDMI API commands:\n\nInformation about the connected monitor or TV can be retrieved with the command below (if there is no multi view displayed)\n\nhttp://[IPADRES]/commands/get-display-properties\n\nUse the modes 'preferred' or 'native'.\n\nReset settings to automatically hdmi:\n\nhttp://[IPADRES]/commands/reset-display-settings\n\nTip: PAL countries were historically 50Hz and NTSC countries 60Hz. However all newer HDMI tvs standard will be 60Hz."
