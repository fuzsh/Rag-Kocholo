        "text": "𝗜𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗮𝗻 𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝟭𝟵𝟵𝟴. (1/3) Databases have always been a central part of my professional life. At that time, in 1998, I already had a fairly extensive CD and vinyl collection, which I wanted to bring some order into with the help of some tool, by first documenting or cataloging the components of the collection. When I was looking for a tool, I somehow got stuck with Microsoft Access. I guess it was Microsoft Access 97. In addition to creating the forms in Access, of course, the data also had to be entered and/or read out again. And so it happened that in 1998 I executed my first SQL statement ever. At the time, I had no idea that I had laid the foundation for my future career. Shortly afterwards, I applied for a practical semester at an industrial electronics and automation company. I don't know why, but one of the topics discussed in the interview was Microsoft Office. At the time, I said that all programs would be no problem for me, except for Access. I was accepted and what was the project I worked on during the practical semester? Exactly, I got the opportunity to work with Access! 🙄 But not just like that! My job was a migration project, from #Claris #Filemaker to #Microsoft #Access. It wouldn't be me if I hadn't said back then: #ChallengeAccepted! Some time later I worked for large and well-known German credit reporting agency. A fairly centralized system of the company was also running there - oh, wonder! - with Microsoft Access, combined with Microsoft SQL server tables linked via ODBC. I don't know why both solutions were in use there. I can only guess here. At some point, it took me to the online business directory sparten.de. The idea for it was literally born in a beer garden. And even though the company no longer exists today, I don't want to miss the time I spent there, as stressful as it was at times. Back then, for example, the paths of a good friend to this day and mine crossed. It's no joke: when I started, students were transferring address data into Excel lists, which were then transferred to static HTML pages. My first project was to make the entire portal dynamic. In other words, I converted it completely to PHP. Part of the project was also to develop a search engine for the portal. We had a few #MySQL databases running in the background, so I became a fan of this database solution that originated in #Sweden. Anyway, until then, things like data privacy, data protection or data security were not really an issue for me. However, this was soon to change with an experience or two. You can find out more about this and what else shaped me professionally in the past years in one of my next postings. To be continued... #StayTuned. 😉 #Databases #MicrosoftAccess #MicrosoftSQLServer #SQLServer #MSSQL #MySQL"
