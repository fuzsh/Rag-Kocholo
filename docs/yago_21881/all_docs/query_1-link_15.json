        "text": "Akhenaten the Heretic 1352–1336 BC\n\nAmenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten and defied tradition by establishing a new religion that believed that there is but one god; the sun god Aten. By the time Akhenaten took the throne, his family had been ruling Egypt for almost two hundred years and had established a huge empire dominating Palestine, Phoenicia, and Nubia.\n\nA century before, Thutmose III had swept all before him, conquering the Middle East and Nubia and establishing a military priesthood which now controlled the empire. At the centre was the god Amun of Thebes, and his priests had become powerful. The imperial elegance of Egypt was supreme. It exuded wealth and confidence, with soldiers and officials stationed in foreign lands. Of course foreigners came to live in Egypt, bringing new customs and ideas. The young prince and future king grew up in this new and changing Egypt.\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, the young pharaoh, Amenhotep IV, still worshiped the old gods, especially Amun of Thebes and the sun god Re-Harakhte. Yet, a few years later, there were significant changes. He abandoned work on a temple dedicated to Re-Harakhte and built a new temple to worship the sun god Aten.\n\nThe Aten was never shown in human or animal form, but represented as the sun disk with extended rays ending in hands. Aten was the life-giving and life-sustaining power of the sun. Unlike the old gods, he had no carved image hidden in a dark room deep within a temple, but was worshiped out in the light of day.\n\nQueen Nefertiti, famous for her portrait bust, is thought to have been an Asian princess from Mitanni. She encouraged and supported her husband in his revolutionary ideas, and together they took on the religious establishment. In the fifth year of his reign, the king declared his new religion by changing his name from Amenhotep (“Amun is Pleased”) to Akhenaten, or “Servant of the Aten.” He moved his capital from Thebes to a place now called Tell el-Amarna or Amarna, over 200 miles (300 km) north, on a desert bay on the east side of the Nile River. Here he built a new city, which he called Akhenaten, “Horizon of Aten.”\n\nThe new city had many spacious villas with trees, pools, and gardens. Akhenaten encouraged artistic inventiveness and realism and the walls of the temples and houses were painted in an eccentric new style. Among the surviving works of this period are the colossal statues of Akhenaten, the paintings from his private residence, the bust of his wife Nefertiti, and that of his mother, Queen Tiy. These works are unique in Egyptian art, as they do not flatter the king and his family but reveal them as real people, in all their beauty and decay.\n\nThe religion of the Aten is not fully understood today. We know that Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti worshipped only the sun god, and the names of other gods and goddesses were removed from view. The funerary religion of Osiris was dropped, and Akhenaten became the source of blessings for people after death. But this religious and artistic renaissance was short-lived; Akhenaten made himself unpopular by closing the old temples, and his lack of enthusiasm for the practical duties of kingship was detrimental to Egypt’s Imperial interests. Surviving documents show that Akhenaten paid little attention to the army and navy, foreign trade fell off, and internal taxes disappeared into the pockets of local officials.\n\nLetters to the king discovered in the ruins of Tell el-Amarna, known as the Amarna Letters, show the discontent of the army commanders and high commissioners in Palestine and Syria. The local princes, who had been loyal to Egypt, no longer saw any advantage in trading with Egypt. The Hittites from the north made gains, and this led to a general disintegration of the empire. Eventually, dissatisfied priests and civil officials combined with the army to discredit the new religion. There is some evidence that at the urging of Tiy, the queen mother, Akhenaten made compromises to placate the different factions growing within Egyptian society. He also became estranged from Nefertiti.\n\nWhen Akhenaten died, Smenkhkare briefly succeeded him, being his favourite, and then Tutankhaten took over, changing his name to Tutankhamun, dropping the Aten and embracing Amun.\n\nTutankhamun eventually returned Egypt to its traditional values, and Akhenaten’s memory was erased. Later Egyptian historians would refer to him only as “the heretic king.”\n\nThe city of Akhenaten was abandoned, and the court returned to Thebes. Later, Horemheb razed the city to the ground and Rameses II reused the stone blocks of its temples for his work at nearby Hermopolis.\n\nAkhenaten was an intellectual and philosophical revolutionary who had the power and wealth to indulge his ideas. The ancient Egyptians were a devoutly religious people who loved their ancient traditions and were not ready to embrace such radical changes. It would not be until the Christian era that the Egyptians would finally reject the old gods in favour of a single universal deity.\n\nMelvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Pharaoh Akhenaten.
