Akhenaten, known before the fifth year of his reign as Amenhotep IV, was a pharaoh of the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt who ruled for 17 years and died in 1336 BC or 1334 BC Neferneferuaten Nefertiti (1370 BC, 1330 BC) was the Great Royal Wife (chief consort) of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten. Nefertiti and her husband were known for a religious revolution, in which they worshiped one god only, Aten, or the sun disc. With her husband, they reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of Ancient Egyptian history. Sunk relief was mainly restricted to Ancient Egypt."
