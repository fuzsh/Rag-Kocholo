Your opinion would be greatly appreciated.\n\nIn real-world El-Amarna, there was a burial site for nobles on the cliffs overlooking Tel El-Amarna, so your idea of having the Ruins of Akhenaten be a burial site makes a lot of sense, when taking real-world history into account. I did notice that it was mentioned as a provincial capitol, but the text was vague to the point where I didn't come to any conclusions.\n\nIs Akhenaten really well known? People are quite familiar with his son (and within the past few months, they finally found evidence that Tutankhamen really was his son and not someone else's), but I'm not sure that there are that many people who would know the first thing about him if you were to casually mention his name. That's why I found his inclusion by name on the map so interesting. As a side note, with Green Ronin's Mythic Vista's series, they went with real world names and locations for most products, but they changed everything in Egyptian Adventures - Hamunaptra. I'm not sure why, but that was one place where I was actually expecting real world names to appear.\n\nSo what would I do with this? As long as the name is the same (and El-Amara is close enough to the same), you might as well make it close to the real world guy. Maybe he tried to overthrow the worship of the gods in Osirion, or maybe just one of the gods (the fact that the Egyptian pantheon didn't make the transition to Osirion is an interesting complication), but in any case he failed, his city died, and the people at the time tried to bury his legacy. Perhapse his tomb still stands, and he might even be in it, but of course since he was so despised by his people he's beyond cursed. He probably exists as a form of undead, but possibly not a traditional mummy. Maybe he's in some form that causes eternal pain and suffering. You could really base some sort of large scale curse here, where simply wandering in and breaking some sort of seal unleashes a horrible horrible evil upon the land, something on par with what we see in the first Mummy movie. It could make for an exciting adventure path.\n\nOf course the more I thought about this today, the more this sparked my creativity for another non-Golarion project I've had on the backburner for a while, which actually may end up providing me with the BIG story idea I've been trying to come up with for a series of novels. As such, I'm keeping that under my hat, but I assure you that it's a cool idea (if I do say so myself!).\n\nWell, Groetus is the \"god of end times\" so he might fit the bill as a sort of \"alpha-omega\" god (monotheism because all the other gods are gone now), plus he has a celestial body, Golarion's moon, as an aspect, which kind of parallels Aten as Terra/Earth's sun...The only problem is that as the god of madness his portfolio doesn't quite fit Akhenaten either, and reminds me of Grayhawk comic's cultists of Tharizdun.\n\nSarenrae would have been \"after his time\" depending on when he arrived and was imprisoned on Golarion, but I don't think he would have been weirded out by a female sun goddess -- Aten is both mother and father, and \"everyone\" knows the gods can change gender if they want to. What would probably get his goat would be that his special relationship as \"the god's represenatitive/son on Earth\" would be annulled. It could even turn into a vendetta against her followers for having \"scorned/forsaken\" him!\n\nPlus, if he was banished by the wizard priests of Osiris, Isis, etc. on Earth, he might be understandably atheistic.\n\nHeck, maybe he even arranged things so that he played an important behind-the-scenes part in Rahadoum's embrace of atheism!"
