        "text": "I've found the mention of a label with Year 30 mentioning Sitamun as GRW. Anyway, back to Daressy: in that chapel Sitamun isn't [!!!!]. Checking in Petrie's works I've noted that in the nearby the temple of Thutmose II was probably reused as place of worshiping for Sitamun by Amenhotep III ... So the research of our blessed sandstone is becoming more and more difficult. I do hate forums where posters don't give accurate references about finds.\n\nIf that sandstone really exists ... of course.\n\nYes, frustrating.... I find blank statements with no sources quoted to back them up frustrating too. Some statements are made by Egyptologists in books, or by forumers, and it feels impolite to ask 'how' they know what they know. People think you are personally attacking them, or their intelligence. Not at all on my part! For me to question is to show I am listening and want to know more, or have things explained if something seems askew or missing. To be questioned is to be respected. You may even find out you are in error sometimes. That is good for personal growth IMO. But you must be in a rational frame of mind to accept being questioned. You must be in a 'logical' frame of mind. I suffer from feeling attacked when questioned too. I try now to take a breath and think about the question instead of being insulted by it. It's not always so easy. Rational, critical and clear thinking is a big effort, I know. Hurt feelings are easier to come by. Don't I know, lol.\n\nWe can all believe we know something, but it is good to sometimes ask ourselves how come we know. Life is full of 'persuasion', we can't stop every few seconds to question what we 'know' ( we would never get anywhere if we stopped to ask how we know anything) but it is amazing how often we only know because we were told and/or learned by rote, not through clear thinking logical research. So much we 'know' about anything at all is based on blind 'belief' on what we were told or saw on the news. Progress in anything is by asking questions, but no one really likes to have their 'knowledge' questioned. It 'feels' so personal to have our ideas questioned. But they're often not 'our' ideas, just 'ideas' that were fed to us by other unsuspecting unquestioning, mostly good intentioned, folk like us. It's all good fun.\n\nSince at Amarna Sitamun is present [according to Wiki, all to be checked, as usual] just as a figure on an object coming from the previous Court at Malkata ... Sitamun didn't go to Akhetaten [like the other daughters of Amenhotep III, btw]. It seems that the only daughter of Amenhotep III to have been at Akhetaten was Beketaten [we have seen that Tiye carried her to the city of the son].\n\nUnless Sitamun went there as Nefertiti. Indeed, as Nefertiti Neferneferuaten. Akhenaten is never referred to as Amenophis at Akhetaten. So why would his sister/s be referred to by old names?\n\nRe-cap on some players...\n\nYuya and Thuya seem to have had a very close and intimate connection with their eldest granddaughter, Sitamun meritre.\n\nAy and Tey seem to have had some familial connection with Yuya and Thuya. Ay inheriting (?) roles of Yuya seems to suggest that familial connection. If not Yuyas son, it might seem reasonable to assume he was his chosen heir in some things. [His son, Anen, was a Priest. Why did did he not inherit some of Yuya's roles? Did Anen die?] As often stated here, all these players were from Akhmim. The way things worked inter-generationally, with sons following in the footsteps of their fathers, surely we must guess Ay (or Tey? or both?) are relatives of Yuya (and Thuya).\n\nTey is wet nurse to Nefertiti. This depicted in one of Ay's tombs. This looks back to a time when Nefertiti - whatever her name at the time - was a baby and/or child. (NB Nebetkabeny may not be our Sitamun's nurse. Eric Cline and others say it was an earlier Sitamun in the dynasty). So, as we have discussed, Nefertiti was important early, and may well have been a Thuthmosside Princess. To become a king's Great Royal Spouse suggests to me a princess high in the pecking order of princesses.\n\nThe fact that Akhenaten, with or without a Coregency, begins begatting babies with Nefertiti very soon after ascending the throne, suggests to me that Akhenaten and Nefertiti only became conjugal partners around the time he became pharaoh/co-Regent. I can't help wondering if Akhenaten and Nefertiti getting all conjugal has something to do with Akhenaten becoming pharaoh. Obviously you know where I am going with this (as usual!): Nefertiti was a Heriditary Princess.\n\nWith Tiye very much on the scene, she would seem to have been Akhenaten's mentor. This is suggested strongly by his close association with her at Amarna. So who would Tiye advise her son to get conjugal with and begin further begatting of the divine bloodline? Was Sitamun so un-beloved, she was dumped for some secondary Princess? I thought Sitamun was high in the estimation of Amenophis, Tiye, Thuya and Yuya???\n\nNefertiti... the beautiful one has come... what about something about 'future' in the name, I seem to recall. The 'future' of the 'divine monarchy' and of Kemet itself!? Who is clearly on the stage, up front and central, prior to her 'sudden' disappearance? Mmmm... I wonder.... And there's Tiye off to Akhetaten to hold her son's hand, leaving her daughters behind - save, maybe, Beketaten, who may have been Nebetah, who knows? - while getting all so 'familial' with another princess, but not her daughter, Nefertiti...who had been wetnursed and tutored as a child by the wife of a close family member, by name Ay, possibly Tiye's brother...\n\nTiye was a real player, as we know, during Amenophis III and Akhenaten's reigns, as was Ay, it seems clear. And Yuya and Thuya must have had influence...Who would they most favor Akhenaten marrying to further establish himself as pharaoh... 'The' Heriditary Princess, perhaps?\n\nMy question now is: could Sitamun meritre have been Great Royal Spouse to both her father and brother at the same time? Could this be, essentially the same question as: was Meritaten Great Royal Spouse to both Neferkheperure Waenra and Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten at the same time? I ask these questions because of that business of Sitamun still being GRS in Year 30... apparently....\n\nWandering semi-aimlessly around the Internet, I chance upon an essay by Amy Bradshaw 2016 of Kent University. 'What can the archeological evidence uncover concerning the disappearance of Nefertiti\". (I am guessing it is an essay by a student).\n\nI browsed through the essay a bit fleetingly, so maybe I need go back and read it thoroughly. Anyhow, I stumbled across the view of Joan Fletcher that KV35YL's double pierced earlobes suggest the mummy is Nefertiti. Bradshaw states that she was not the only woman of the time with the double piercing, identifying Thuya as having double pierced earlobes. If true, I find that tantalising! Just me, maybe... Yuya, Thuyu, Sitamun, Ay, Tey, Nefertiti, and now, doubled pierced earlobes.... that's Thuya and Nefertiti! I have a memory (maybe a false one) that Thuya is shown somewhere with a Nubian wig... and Nefertiti wore one... or was it Tiye with a Nubian wig??? Anyway, sure makes you wonder how closely related all these folks were. How closely related were Sitamun and Nefertiti, that Nefertiti seems to have supplanted Sitamun as (Number 1?) Heriditary Princess? Odd, I might state, at the grave risk of boring you folks with my repetitions, that Sitamun vanishes and Nefertiti appears: one dazzling (like the Aten?) personage replacing another, in the blink of an eye!\n\nAnother concern just popped into my head. What ever happened to Prince Amenophis, brother of Crown Prince Thutmose? One minute he is with us, then he disappears completely from the records during the Akhetaten sojourn! So clearly Prince Amenophis did not go to Akhetaten. I wonder what happened to him? His nomen is never mentioned again! Though the throne name is reused by a fellow called Akhenaten. So we have two Pharaohs with the same name. Never Neferkheperure Amenophis and Neferkheperure Akhenaten. Maybe we should look into this mystery? I do jest. Though the points I make, I think, has relevance.\n\nIncidentally, AlpinLuke, I am swinging between Nefertiti and Meritaten for KV35YL. If you can only find that Sitre Meritamun business of Daressy, the hieroglyohs that have the name, and the context of the find, it would surely be a help for our investigation!\n\nAbout names, remember at Malkata we've got Neferkheperure Amenhotep with Nefertiti at the Window of Appearance under the Aten. [Right page, note that the author writes \"AKHENATEN AND NEFERTITI AT THE WINDOW\" with the usual freedom of interpretation ... actually it's AMENHOTEP AND NEFERTITI Davies, Norman De Garis - The Tomb of the Vizier Ramose (1941) : Davies, Norman de Garis (1865-1941); Peet, Thomas Eric (1882-1934) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive].\n\nOn the boundary stelae we see Akhenaten and Nefertiti Neferneferuaten [even if I've noted the simple form Nefertiti, in one occasion].\n\nSo, if \"Sitamun\" lost that \"epithet name\" acquiring \"Nefertiti\", it happened at Malkata, in occasion of the Royal Marriage with Neferkheperure Amenhotep.\n\nIt's still all to be proved, of course.\n\nRegarding Sitamun in the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep II, I'm reading Petrie and I begin to think that we have met a rumor. Petrie doesn't mention an inscription about Sitamun, he mentions the famouse sandstone with the figure of a Princess and he says that she can be only Sitamun, since the \"Si\" is visible. And he makes reference to the famous relief attribuited to Sitamun [right page, no. 6 \"Si\" is actually visible Six temples at Thebes, 1896 : Petrie, W. M. Flinders (William Matthew Flinders), Sir, 1853-1942 : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive].\n\nNefertiti may have begun as a pet name. She may have got it at the time of her conjugal linking with Neferkheperure Amenophis. It does sound like a compliment to a woman at the time of her arrival in Amenophis' bed, so to speak...\n\n... but it is a possible problem with the Sitamun-Nefertiti nexus we are exploring. As is the GRS business in Year 30 of Amenophis III appears to be... These possible 'issues' may not really be issues though, if we keep raking those coals over....\n\nNefertiti's 'importance' from the time she was still a nursing babe has an explanation. There is something going on in the whole Yuya-Thuya-Sitamun Ay-Tey-Nefertiti dictomy IMO. The Sitamun-Nefertiti correspondence just seems the best one I can think of at the moment.\n\nEven if, the last check I made generated a doubt: [Sitamen]\n\nIt's not said that the stele we are considering showed Sitamun, daughter of Amenhotep III, but probably it depicted a daughter of Ahmose with the same name.\n\nThis solves the matter of the two nurses.\n\nRead your first post first! Yes. I think we must forget Nebetkabeny in this adventure. Probably was an issue for the Sitamun-Nefertiti hypothesis anyhow. I must not think emotionally, but I kind of do like the Sitamun-Nefertiti hypothesis. It seems so neat in so many ways.\n\nMy interest in the before-Akhenaten, during-Akhetaten and post-Akhetaten personages still simmers away. If Nefertiti was named Nefertiti at birth, then where does she fit in? Really, I think we need to re-examine the familial relationship - if any - between Yuya and Thuya, and Ay and Tey. We have discussed it before, but can we re-examine this anyway. The stronger the link we make between Yuya, Thuya and Tiye, and Ay and Tey, the stronger our curiousuty must be about Nefertiti and her 'importance' from birth. Really, we must explain how Nefertiti, if not Akhenaten's sister, whichever one, managed to become do prominent so quickly! How did Sitamun and Isis and their sisters get pushed aside without further mention of any of them, this while Tiye was alive, and, possibly, Amenophis III as well?\n\nAnd pleeeeease... can we find Daressy's 'Sitre meritamun'... It is driving me nuts!!! I want to know what that's all about."
