        "text": "PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 8 — History has short‐changed Queen Nefertiti of ancient Egypt's Golden Age by stressing only her beauty, Ray Winfield Smith, an archeologist, believes.\n\nThe young queen may well have wielded the major religious, political and economic power of the day, he said in an interview.\n\nIf so, the comely Nefertiti was influential in establishing what was probably the world's first single‐god religion, the worship of the sun disk Aten.\n\nShe may also have guided a change to greater naturalism in Egyptian art.\n\nBoth developments of the mid‐14th century B.C. have been attributed to her husband, the eccentric King Akhenaten (or Ikhnaton). But Mr. Smith said his studies in’ Egypt for the last five years point to a far loftier role for Nefertiti than ever before accorded her.\n\nShe may not only have been the brains in the family, he said, but may also have done without the aid of the king in conceiving their six daughters.\n\nCarvings Analyzed\n\nMr. Smith based his observations on his analysis of carvings of some 35,000 stones of a temple to Aten that the youthful pharaoh had built at Karnak in the Egyptian capital of Thebes early in his 17‐year reign.\n\nThe archeologist, a research associate at the University Museum of the University of Penn1sylvania here, headed a team that has used photographs and computers to reconstruct in pictures enough of the temple's scattered sandstone wall blocks so inscriptions and decorations can be seen and studied in proper relationship to each other rather than in fragments. Sponsors of the project include the museum, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Department of Antiquities of the United Arab Republic.\n\nThe temple was razed by successor of Akhenaten after it stood for only two decades. The Smith team found individual blocks in museums and in private hands throughout Europe and in the United States. Many others had been stacked by excavators in storehouses in Karnak or in the open at Luxor. Since the demolition of the temple, many of these had been used as foundations and fill in monuments built in Thebes by rulers who did not share Akhenaten's monotheistic view of religion.\n\nMassive Jigsaw Puzzle\n\nMr. Smith, just back from Egypt to publish a book on his Ifindings, said the 35,000 pieces of the massive jigsaw puzzle his team put together amounted to only 15 per cent of the original structure but enough to establish Nefertiti's pre‐eminence in her day.\n\nImages of the queen rather than the king dominated the temple carvings. An entire courtyard was devoted exclusively to her. Never before had a temple in the country's capital so emphasized a woman over the king, Mr. Smith said.\n\nA century earlier a queen had ruled Egypt, but she (Hatshepsut) disguised her sex by calling herself the king and wearing a beard. Nefertiti, whose name means “the beautiful one has come” retained her femininity.\n\nEach Egyptian king was god as well as secular ruler, but the temple drawings showed that Nefertiti matched her husband in religious stature. She was revered as a goddess. Depictions of the holiest of ritualistic ceremonies of the time, the offering of a treasured object to Aten, show twice as many gold statues of Nefertiti used in the ceremonies as statues of her husband.\n\nEgyptians addressed prayers to Nefertiti. No other queen, Mr. Smith said; was accorded divinity while her husband lived. The loftiness of her role, he said, was not known before the pieces of the temple puzzle were put together.\n\nAdditional Evidence\n\nMr. Smith said supplementary evidence of Nefertiti's standing can be found at Tell el Amarna, 240 miles down the Nile from Thebes, where Akhenaten built a new capital. An inscription on a stone boundary panel reports that the queen had an idea of her own about building the city. Never before in Egyptian history, the archeologist said, had there been a recorded concession that a queen expressed ideas different from those of her husband.\n\nMr. Smith said his interpretation of the evidence was that the tributes to Nefertiti at Karnak were not the result of the initiative of an admiring husband but flowed from her own dominant personality.\n\nHe noted that existing literature gives the revolutionary god‐king credit for the religious and cultural innovations of the day and for a powerful personality and intellect. But he said this was done without proof.\n\nHe pointed out that panels and statues of Akhenaten found at the temple depicted him as “a physical monstrosity,” with a long narrow face, thick lips, hatchet chin, thin neck, vestigial breast development, wide hips, thick thighs and spindly legs, apparently the result of glandular trouble.\n\nSyndrome Cited\n\nPersons born with such syndrome, he said, are not likely to be particularly intelligent and tend to be easily influenced. He believes Nefertiti held strong sway over him and her subjects from the time they married as teen‐agers till the young Pharaoh died in his 30's after a reign of 17 years.\n\nIn wall carvings the six princesses were almost always shown with their mother. Mr. Smith said it would have been customary to show them with the king some of the time if he had been the predominant figure historians have credited him with being.\n\n, He said that because some people with Akhenaten's physical abnormalities are sterile, there has been speculation that others sired the children attributed to him.\n\nNo maitter how forceful her personality, Mr. Smith said, Nefertiti had no desire to embarrass her husband. When pictured together on stones of the temple “she always brought up the rear.”\n\nSubtle Power Base\n\n“Whatever power she wielded was probably wielded subtly,” he said.\n\nThe influence of neither was strong enough to perpetuate monotheism much beyond their reign. The previous proliferation of gods returned to favor under succeeding pharaohs, the Aten temple was razed and its pictorial testament to the history of the day was hidden from view.\n\nMore of the temple building blocks will be turned up, Mr. Smith said, but never enough for a physical reconstruction of the vast structure.\n\nNevertheless, he said, researchers will henceforth have his team's large pictorial panels, some incorporating as many as 30 stone blocks, available for study instead of separate individual stones that showed only part of the picture.\n\nMr. Smith reported on how computers were used to put the panels together in a 1970 article in National Geographic. Many of the integrated panels and his analysis of the stories they tell will be contained in his forthcoming book."
