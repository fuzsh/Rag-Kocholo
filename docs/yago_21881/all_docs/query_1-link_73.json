        "text": "The portrait bust of Nefertiti is one of the most famous icons of Ancient Egypt, yet the queen herself is still shrouded in mystery and intrigue. As consort to Pharaoh Akhenaten the couple ruled from 1353 to 1336 BCE during one of the most contentious periods of Egypt's cultural history. At this time, Pharaoh Akhenaten remodeled Egypt's religion around the worship of the sun god Aten and moved the empire's capital to Amarna.\n\nAlthough not pharaoh herself, Nefertiti's name has persisted because written evidence suggests she held a uniquely influential role as wife and queen in the court. Historians have gleaned that Nefertiti was a major proponent of Akhenaten's religious and cultural movement. She represented the female element of Aten while her husband represented the male—and both acted as a bridge between Aten and the Egyptian people. The Nefertiti bust is identified as her likeness because of the characteristic blue crown, which she wears in all other inscribed depictions of her. The limestone sculpture was believed to have been completed by the artist Thutmose in 1345 BCE. Upon its discovery in 1912, the portrait immortalized Nefertiti as the symbol of ideal feminine beauty and continues to be a popular attraction at the Neues Museum in Berlin.\n\nDespite the little surviving evidence we have of Nefertiti, there is enough to build a picture of the remarkable woman who made an impact on the ancient world. To gain a more in-depth understanding of queen Nefertiti, read on to learn 11 facts about her life.\n\nHere are 11 facts about the Ancient Egyptian Queen Nefertiti.\n\nNefertiti was a teenage queen.\n\nUnsurprisingly for the era, Nefertiti was fifteen when she married sixteen-year-old Amunhotep IV and assumed the throne as queen consort. In his fifth regnal year, the pharaoh began his religious movement and renamed himself Akhenaten.\n\nAkhenaten and Nefertiti built a new city.\n\nWith the foundation of their new monotheistic religion worshipping the sun god Aten, Nefertiti and Akhenaten further separated themselves from the “old reign” of Ancient Egypt and built a new capital city named Amarna.\n\nNefertiti might have been of royal heritage.\n\nNefertiti's parentage is mostly conjectured with two prevailing theories. Some historians believe her father to be Ay, who was an important advisor to the royal family, including Nefertiti's future husband. (Ay even became pharaoh himself after King Tut's death in 1323 BCE.) Other academics speculate that Nefertiti was a princess from the Mitanni kingdom in northern Syria.\n\nWe do know that Nefertiti had a younger sister named Mutbenret (or Mutnodjemet), who is mentioned in the surviving art of Amarna.\n\nShe held many titles.\n\nLike most royalty, Nefertiti held many titles during her time in power, including:\n\nHereditary Princess\n\nGreat of Praises\n\nLady of Grace\n\nSweet of Love\n\nLady of the Two Lands\n\nMain King's Wife\n\nHis beloved\n\nGreat King's Wife\n\nLady of all Women\n\nMistress of Upper and Lower Egypt\n\nNefertiti lived up to her name.\n\nNefertiti was born in 1370 BCE in the Egyptian city of Thebes. Her name in English means “the beautiful woman has come.” When she and her husband Akhenaten initiated the shift in Egypt's religion, Nefertiti adopted the additional name of Neferneferuaten. Altogether, her full name means “beautiful are the beauties of Aten, a beautiful woman has come.” According to surviving images of Nefertiti, she had beauty in spades.\n\nShe ruled over the wealthiest period of Ancient Egyptian history.\n\nAkhenaten and Nefertiti ruled over the possibly wealthiest period in Ancient Egyptian history. During Akhenaten's reign, the new capital of Amarna achieved an artistic boom, distinct from any other era in Egypt. The Amarna style showed movement and figures of more exaggerated proportions, with elongated hands and feet. The depictions of Akhenaten during this time give him distinctly feminine attributes with wide hips and prominent breasts.\n\nShe was a powerful wife.\n\nNefertiti was the favored consort, or Great Royal Wife, of Akhenaten from the very start of his reign. According to historical records, Nefertiti had six daughters with Akhenaten by the names of Meritaten, Meketaten, Ankhes-en-pa-aten, Neferneferuaten-tasherit, Neferneferure, and Setepenre. Despite having no sons, the art of Amarna depicts the royal couple as having a strong, loving relationship. Nefertiti is also shown in a variety of roles, including driving chariots, attending ceremonial acts with Akhenaten, and smiting enemies.\n\nShe was both loved and loathed.\n\nAlthough Nefertiti and Akhenaten governed Ancient Egypt at a time of unprecedented wealth, their new religion unsettled the empire. As queen, Nefertiti was loved by some for her charisma and grace. However, she was also largely hated because of her important religious role in the Aten cult.\n\nNefertiti possibly ruled as pharaoh after her husband's death.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Nefertiti's death are a mystery, as her name disappears from the historical record at about the 12th year of Akhenaten's 17-year reign. A popular theory suggests that Nefertiti abandoned her old title at that point and became an official co-regent under the name of Neferneferuaten.\n\nSome also propose that Nefertiti actually served as the female pharaoh Neferneferuaten, whom Egyptologists know was a female ruler who ruled toward the end of the Amarna Period.\n\nTwo of her daughters became Egyptian queens.\n\nNefertiti and Akhenaten had six known daughters: Meritaten, Meketaten, Ankesenpaaten (later known as Ankhesanamun), Neferneferuagen Tasherit, Neferneferure, and Setepenre. While we don't have substantial records of all of the princesses, historians know that two of them served as queens of Egypt.\n\nMeritaten, whose name means “She who is beloved by Aten,” became the Great Royal Wife to Pharaoh Smenkhkare. After his death, she might have even served as a female king under the name Neferneferuaten—the same figure whom some Egyptologists speculate was Nefertiti.\n\nNefertiti's other daughter, Ankesenenpaaten became Ankhesanamun after her father's death, reflecting Egypt's return to polytheism. Sometime after the short reigns of King Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten, she was wed to her half-brother Tutankhamun, becoming the Great Royal Wife.\n\nShe is “related” to King Tut (but not by blood).\n\nAs Nefertiti had no sons of her own, the succeeding pharaoh Tutankhamun (or “King Tut”) was the son of Akhenaten and one of his lower consorts.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is Nefertiti known for?\n\nAlthough not pharaoh herself, Nefertiti's name has persisted because written evidence suggests she held a uniquely influential role as wife and queen in the court. Historians have gleaned that Nefertiti was a major proponent of Akhenaten's religious and cultural movement. She represented the female element of Aten while her husband represented the male—and both acted as a bridge between Aten and the Egyptian people.\n\nHow did Nefertiti rise to power?\n\nNefertiti was fifteen when she married sixteen-year-old Amunhotep IV and assumed the throne as queen consort.
