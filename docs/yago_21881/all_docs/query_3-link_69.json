NOMA is the final North American venue for this traveling exhibition.\n\nPurchase tickets here\n\nAre all of the women in the sculptures Queen Nefertari?\n\nNo, the only known representations of Nefertari in human form are at an architectural scale. The sculptures and objects on view feature other royal wives, sisters, daughters, and mothers of pharaohs, as well as goddesses of the Egyptian pantheon.\n\nIs Nefertari the same person as Nefertiti?\n\nNo, Nefertari was the first wife of Ramesses II, who ruled 1279–13 BCE (19th Dynasty). She is most known for her presence on the Lesser Temple at Abu Simbel and her Tomb in the Valley of the Queens.\n\nNefertiti (Neferneferuaten-Nefertiti) is most known by her painted bust in the Archeological Museum in Berlin. She was the royal wife of Amenhotep IV (reigned ​​1353–36 BC), the 18th Dynasty pharaoh who controversially changed the state religion to a monotheistic worship of Aten, the sun god. He moved the capital from Thebes to Tell el Amarna, changed his name to Akenaten, and encouraged a new style of art.\n\nThe prefix “Nefer” means beautiful, hence its use in both names.\n\nHow is Nefertari related to King Tut?\n\nNefertari is not related to Tutankhamen, commonly known as King Tut. Tutankhamun, born Tutankaten, was the son of Amenhotep IV and either Nefertiti or another wife. He ruled for 10 years (c. 1332–23 BCE, 18th Dynasty) and reversed his predecessor’s religious reforms. He was the last of his family to rule during the 18th Dynasty. Nefertari was married to Rameses II, the third pharaoh of the 19th Dynasty.\n\nAre there any mummies on view in this exhibition?\n\nNo, there are not any human remains included in Queen Nefertari’s Egypt. The exhibition does include wooden coffins and stone sarcophagi.\n\nWhich museum do the objects on view belong to?\n\nAll of the objects on view in Queen Nefertari’s Egypt are part of the collection of the Museo Egizio in Turin, Italy.\n\nWere the objects on view acquired ethically?\n\nThe objects from Queen Nefertari’s tomb were brought from Egypt by Ernesto Schiaparelli, then director of the Museo Egizio, at the start of the 20th century. They were allowed to leave Egypt with the permission of the Egyptian department of antiquities, in accordance with the laws and practices of the time.\n\nWith funding from the Italian king Vittorio Emanuele III and exclusive excavation permits from the Egyptian Antiquities Service, Schiaparelli established an official archaeological mission, which worked between 1903 and 1920 in 11 different sites. Under the partage system, the Italian mission was allowed to keep a part of the many thousands of objects they unearthed. The objects that you see in Queen Nefertari’s Egypt represent a selection of the Museo Egizio’s portion of the findings from Schiaparelli’s mission.\n\nToday, the Museo Egizio still maintains one of the largest collections of ancient Egyptian artifacts outside of Egypt. The touring of these objects is supported by the Egyptian government.\n\nWhile exploring the exhibition, we hope that the objects presented in Queen Nefertari’s Egypt encourage dialogue about the acquisition of ancient Egyptian artifacts, the history of colonization, and your feelings about seeing and experiencing the objects outside of their original home in Egypt.\n\nRead more about the history of these objects and how they came to be in the collection of the Museo Egizio."
