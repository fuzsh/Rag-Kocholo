        "text": "The electrical/electronic architectures of today’s vehicles are reaching their limits in terms of complexity and performance. Connectivity, electrification, shared mobility, and last but not least, automated and autonomous driving require great amounts of computing power.\n\nAccordingly, the central computing power with corresponding functions is concentrated in a few, but powerful central High-Performance Computers (HPCs). This supports the decoupling of software and hardware and simplifies continuous updates and improvements to the “lifelong learning” vehicle.\n\nThe new solution combines the powerful processors of the Telechips Dolphin family with pre-integrated functions for cluster, infotainment and visualization of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, enabling great user experience beyond\n\nthe premium segment. ​\n\nIn collaboration with Google Cloud, Continental integrates generative AI technology directly into the vehicle server. This allows drivers to interact\n\nwith their car in a natural dialogue. ​\n\nWith the fusion of cockpit and advanced driver assistance features on one chip, the HPC not only powers a broad set of functions such as automated parking, surround view, holistic motion control or multimedia but also allows for over the air software updates. The cross-domain HPC marks a milestone on the path towards full domain integration.​\n\nHigh-Performance Computers (HPCs) form the computing backbone of the software-defined vehicle. They provide the necessary computing power for the software functions in the vehicle enabling them to be further developed throughout their life cycle. This allows vehicles to become an integral part of their users’ digital life. With HPCs at the center of service-oriented architectures, improved functions and important firmware or cyber security updates can be installed over-the-air throughout the entire lifetime of a vehicle – just as convenient as on a smartphone."
