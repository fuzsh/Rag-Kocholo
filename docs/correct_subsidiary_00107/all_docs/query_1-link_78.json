Price does not include local and state taxes and fees.\n\nSection 631 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (\"Cable Act\") requires us to inform you of the following matters.\n\nCOLLECTION\n\nThe Cable Act requires us to inform you of the nature of personally identifiable subscriber information that we collect and of the nature of the use we make of such information. Generally, the Cable Act permits us to collect and use only the information needed for the business of providing cable and other services to subscribers. In order that we may continue to provide reliable, high quality service and maintain adequate records, we keep regular business records that contain your name, address, telephone number, social security number, and other personally identifiable information. Such records include billing, payment, deposit, complaint and service records, records of information you have furnished to us, such as the location and number of television sets connected to cable and the service options you have chosen. We maintain records of research concerning subscriber satisfaction and viewing habits, which are obtained from subscriber interviews and questionnaires. At such time as interactive or other transactional television services become available in your area, the cable system will automatically collect information on your use of such services, including information on the choices that you make along the range of services offered, including the programs you view or order, the time you actually use the services, products you order, and the use of other features, such as which menus and menu screens are used most often, the time spent using them and the use of the remote control feature.\n\nWe use this information to sell, maintain, disconnect, reconnect and market services; to make sure that you are being billed properly for the services you receive; to maintain financial, accounting, tax, service and property records including records required by the terms of our franchise; for the purposes described below; and as otherwise necessary to provide the service.\n\nDISCLOSURE\n\nThe Cable Act allows us to collect personally identifiable information and to disclose it to a third party only if (a) you consent in advance in writing or electronically; (b) disclosure is necessary to render cable service and other services we provide to you and related business activities; (c) disclosure is pursuant to a court order and you are notified of such order; or (d) for mailing list as described below. The Cable Act requires us to inform you of the nature, frequency and purpose of any disclosure which may be made of such information, including an identification of the type of persons to whom the disclosure may be made. We may make your records available to employees, agents and contractors to install, market, provide and audit cable service on each occasion access is needed for the specific job at hand. Access for these purposes is routine, and does not occur with any specific frequency. We may also occasionally release our subscriber list to a consumer research organization to conduct market research for programs shown by the cable system. This typically occurs no more than once each year. Further, we make our subscriber lists available to mailing services and programmers and outside auditors to check our records whenever such checks are required, which occurs irregularly; to attorneys and accountants on a continuous basis as necessary to render service to the company; to potential purchasers in connection with a system sale which occurs only at the time such sale is contemplated; to franchising authorities to demonstrate compliance at irregular times when compliance concerns are raised; and to collection services if required to collect past due bills at such time as bills are submitted for collection. Subscriber information also is disclosed to our bill payment lock box service each month as necessary for processing subscriber payments. We reserve the right to include information about you in collective or aggregate formats, such as ratings surveys and other statistical reports, which do not personally identify you, your particular viewing habits or the nature of any transaction you have made over the cable system.\n\nSECURITY\n\nWe take reasonable security precautions to protect your personally identifiable information that we collect on the service from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. For example, we store billing records on computers in a controlled and secure environment. However, we cannot guarantee that our security precautions will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your personally identifiable information.\n\nMAILING LISTS\n\nThe Cable Act also allows us to disclose your name and address for mailing list and other purposes unless you object. We do not presently sell our subscriber list or otherwise disclose it to commercial users, and do not anticipate making any such disclosure in the future. Should we make any such disclosure in the future, we will not disclose the extent of your viewing or use of a particular service or the nature of any transaction you may make over the cable system, but we may disclose that you are among those who subscribe to a particular service. If you do not wish to have your name and address included on a subscriber list disclosed to a commercial or charitable user, please contact us at the address shown on front of this form or call us at 1-800-427-8449.\n\nRETENTION\n\nWe will maintain most, if not all, of the personally identifiable information we have collected during the time you are a subscriber. We generally will destroy the information after a reasonable period of time has elapsed following the termination of your account with us, if the purpose for which such information was collected has been accomplished and we no longer need to retain the information for compliance with law, tax or other legitimate business activities.\n\nDISCLOSURE BY COURT ORDER\n\nThe Cable Act also provides that the government may obtain disclosure of personally identifiable information by court order, if it offers evidence that such records are material to a criminal case, and if you are given the opportunity to appear and contest the evidence.\n\nSUBSCRIBER RIGHTS\n\nAs described above, the Cable Act establishes your rights as a subscriber and the limits upon the cable operator with respect to the collection and disclosure of subscriber information. You have the right to inspect and copy our records, at your expense, that contain information about you and to correct any error in our information. If you wish to inspect the records at our system office pertaining to you, please contact us 1-800-427-8449 during regular business hours to set up an appointment. You may bring a private civil action in U.S. District Court and you may seek to recover damages, costs, and attorney fees if the limits under the Cable Act have been violated.\n\nA/B SELECTOR SWITCH AVAILABILITY NOTICE\n\nPresently the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) rules do not necessarily require a cable TV system to carry all local broadcast stations. As a result, at this time or at a later date, you may not be able to receive all local broadcast stations over your cable system. To ensure that you will retain the capability of receiving all of the broadcast stations that are available off-the-air which might not be carried on the cable system either now or in the future, it may be necessary to use an input A/B selector switching device in conjunction with an antenna. This device, which connects to both your cable service and your antenna will enable you to select between cable service and local broadcast stations, television signals. Such switches are available for a fee from local electronics suppliers. A wide range of switching devices are available including, but not limited to mechanical, electronic, multiple input and remote switches which can be adapted to fit most needs. All questions related to this notice should be directed to the CentraCom Interactive Customer Service Department at 1-800-427-8449.\n\nConnection Contract and Use Agreement\n\nThis agreement is made by and between Central Telcom Services, LLC dba CentraCom Interactive CTS, a Utah limited liability company (“CentraCom”) having its offices at 35 South State, Fairview, Utah, 84629, and Subscribers.\n\nCentraCom is a conduit entity through which the Subscriber may obtain access to the internet, video and television programming, broadband/bandwidth and telephone communications (together “Telecom Services”). The Subscriber desires to utilize the Telecom Services offered by CentraCom to enable the Subscriber to access, receive, and distribute information, programs, data and other services available. As such, in exchange for a monthly fee to be received by CentraCom from the Subscriber each month in advance, and other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows:\n\nPursuant to the terms of this agreement, and in exchange for the monthly amount, the Subscriber shall have the right to utilize the Telecom Services of CentraCom. Consistent therewith each Subscriber is responsible for his or her own account, and for ensuring full compliance by any individual user of the Subscriber’s account with the terms and conditions contained herein.\n\nThe Subscriber agrees to use the Telecom Services in a manner consistent with any and all applicable laws and the laws of foreign countries. The Subscriber agrees that the use of the Service, without limitation, is their sole responsibility, is at their own risk and is subject to all applicable local, state, national and international laws and regulations. The Subscriber is liable for the use of the Service by others, with or without their permission. The Subscriber may not resell, assign or otherwise transfer the Service or Agreement to any other person for any purpose, or relocate or make any change for the use of the Service, without advance written permission from CentraCom.

In the event of termination by the Subscriber, the Subscriber shall remain liable for any charges incurred until the effective date of termination, as well as any penalties or fees associated with early termination. The effective date of termination shall be the date upon which CentraCom receives the above described written notice, or on a future date so specified by the Subscriber.\n\nThe Subscriber is responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy their particular requirements for accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a means external to CentraCom for reconstruction of any lost data. The Subscriber agrees to assess their own need for protective measures, and implement where necessary, whether under professional advice, including voltage spike protection, computer equipment insurance, virus detection and elimination software, security and system administration policies and obtain such protection as they see fit and not to make any claims against CentraCom, its users or faculty, for the loss or damage to their equipment.\n\nThe Subscriber understands, and agrees, that opinions, advice, services and all other information expressed by, information providers, service providers or other third parties on the internet are those of the provider and not those of CentraCom. CentraCom exercises no control whatsoever of the content of the information passing through its Telecom Services.\n\nThe Subscriber is responsible for all charges for connection directly to CentraCom’s Telecom Services. CentraCom assumes no responsibility or liability for any phone charges including but not limited to, long distance charges, per minute surcharges, and or equipment or line costs incurred by the Subscriber while accessing CentraCom’s Telcom Services.

CentraCom also disclaims any warranty of merchantability of fitness for a particular purpose. CentraCom will not be responsible for any damage suffered by the Subscriber.

Some of this information is personally identifiable information, but much of it is not. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular person.\n\nTo make use of some features on our website visitors and users need to register and provide certain information as part of the registration process. We may ask, for example, for your name and e-mail address. Our systems may remember some of this information the next time you log in and use our website, but you can always review and change your information by following the instructions below under Changes to Information in this statement.\n\nThe more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying this information is entirely voluntary. But if you choose not to supply the information, we may be unable to provide you with the products and services we make available to other users of and visitors to our website. When you submit any personally identifiable information over this website, CentraCom (i) will use the information for the purposes described at the time you submit it and (ii) may use the information to contact you. Of course, if you want to remain completely anonymous, you’re still free to take advantage of any publicly available content on our website without registration.\n\nWhat categories of persons or entities do we share personally identifiable information with?\n\nWe consider the personally identifiable information contained in our business records to be confidential. We may sometimes disclose personally identifiable information about you to our affiliates or to others who work for us. We may also disclose personally identifiable information about you to service providers and vendors, and to others who provide products and services to us. For example, when you use certain functions on this website you may notice that the website actually collecting or processing the information may be other than a CentraCom website. We may be required by law or legal process to disclose certain personally identifiable information about you to lawyers and parties in connection with litigation and to law enforcement personnel. For example, we may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information about you without your consent and without notice in order to comply with a valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.\n\nWhat do we do to personalize your use of this website?\n\nTo help make our website more responsive to the needs of our users and visitors, we use a standard feature of browser software called a “cookie.” We use cookies to help us tailor our website to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service, and to remember certain choices you’ve made so you don’t have to re-enter them.\n\nCentraCom uses cookies, among other things, to remember your username and password, if you choose to store them, from the home page of the website, as well as to remember some of your personalization preferences and website features. CentraCom does not store your name or other personal information in cookies. Of course, if you set your browser not to accept cookies or you delete them, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to and users of our website.\n\nThe cookies we use don’t directly identify visitors to or users of our website as particular persons. Rather, they contain information sufficient to simplify and improve a visitor’s or user’s experience on our website. For example, we may use session-based cookies to track the pages on our website visited by our users. We can build a better website if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Or, we may use persistent cookies to simplify access to a user’s account information over our website, for example.\n\nIn connection with the standard operation of CentraCom’s systems, certain non-personally identifiable information about visitors to this website is recorded. This information is used primarily to tailor and enhance visitors’ experience using the website. We may use this information in an aggregate, non-personally identifiable form to, among other things, measure the use of our website and determine which products and services are the most popular with website visitors.\n\nWhere do we permit visitors and users to opt in or out of CentraCom promotional e-mail?\n\nYou may choose to receive, or not receive, promotional e-mails about CentraCom’s products and services by going to the web page located at www.centracom.com and following the instructions there. If you have otherwise provided your e-mail address to CentraCom, or CentraCom has already obtained it, then CentraCom may have already contacted you about receiving promotional e-mails separately. You will always be able to unsubscribe to the email list from the email you received.\n\nOther Websites\n\nTo make our website more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features in conjunction with other providers. Our website may also include links to other websites whose privacy policies and practices we don’t control. Once you leave our website by linking to another one, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the website you’re visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can’t find the privacy policy of any of these websites via a link from the site’s homepage, you should contact the website directly for more information.\n\nSecurity\n\nAll information gathered on our website is stored within a database maintained by or for CentraCom and its specifically authorized contractors and vendors. However, as effective as any security measure implemented by CentraCom and its partners may be, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the complete security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. If you don’t want us to know any particular information about you, don’t include it in anything that you submit or post to this website or send to us in e-mail.\n\nChanges to Information\n\nYou may review and change information that you provide to us through this website by returning to the pages where you entered it, and reviewing or changing the information directly.\n\nChanges to this Privacy Statement\n\nWe may change this privacy statement from time to time. If we change this privacy statement at some point in the future, we’ll post the changes on our website and by continuing to use the website after we post any changes, you accept and agree to this privacy statement, as modified.\n\nPrivacy Policies for CentraCom Products and Services\n\nThis privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for this website only.
