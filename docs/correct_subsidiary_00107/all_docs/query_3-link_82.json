The knowledge management approach to learning in organizations has achieved limited success, primarily because it has focused on knowledge as a resource rather than on learning as a people process. Many world-class organizations, such as Procter & Gamble, Cisco Systems and Deloitte Consulting, are now employing a new breed of systems known as Learning Management Systems (LMS) to foster and manage learning within their organizations1. This article reports on the deployment of an LMS by a major US multinational, CEM Corporation, and proposes a framework for understanding learning in organizations, which highlights the roles that LMS can play in today’s knowledge-intensive organizations.\n\nComplete Chapter List\n\nSearch this Book:\n\nReset"
