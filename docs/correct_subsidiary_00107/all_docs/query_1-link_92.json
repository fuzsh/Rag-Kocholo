Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.\n\nFor the purpose of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, the data controller is Musgrave Limited trading as Musgrave Retail Partners Ireland of Ballycurreen, Airport Road, Cork.\n\nInformation we may collect from you\n\nWe may collect and process the following data about you:\n\nInformation you give us (Submitted information): You may give us information about you by filling in forms on the App or using the Services or by corresponding with us (for example, by email). This includes but is not limited to information you provide when you download or register the App, subscribe to any of our Services, search for an App or Service as well as sharing data via the App’s social media functions, entering a competition, promotion or survey and when you report a problem with an App or our Services. The information you give us may include but is not limited to your name, address, email address and phone number, the Device’s phone number, age, username, password and other registration information and financial and credit card information. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.\n\nInformation we collect about you and your device. Each time you use our App we may automatically collect the following information:\n\ntechnical information, including but not limited to the type of mobile device you use, a unique device identifier (for example, your Device’s IMEI number, the MAC address of the Device’s wireless network interface, or the mobile phone number used by the Device), mobile network information, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile browser you use, or time zone settings (the “Device Information”);\n\ninformation stored on your Device, including but not limited to contact information, friends lists, login information, photos, videos or other digital content associated with your use of Facebook and/or Twitter or other social media providers, or check ins (the “Content Information”);\n\ndetails of your use of any of our Apps including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access (the “Log Information”).\n\nLocation information. We may also use GPS technology or other similar positioning technology to determine your current location. Some of our location-enabled Services require your personal data for the feature to work. If you wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked to consent to your data being used for this purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by turning off locations services for the App in the settings of your Device.\n\nInformation we receive from other sources (Third Party Information). We are working closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you from them.\n\nUnique application numbers: when you install or uninstall a Service containing a unique application number or when such a Service searches for automatic updates, that number and information about your installation, for example, the type of operating system, may be sent to us.\n\nCookies\n\nWe use cookies to distinguish you from other users of the App. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you use the App or browse any of the sites and also allows us to improve the App.\n\nThe following cookies may be placed on your device:\n\nWe may also from time to time use tools to analyse the data collected via the App including, but not limited to, Google Analytics which may include the details below.\n\n__utma Cookie\n\nA persistent cookie - remains on a computer, unless it expires or the cookie cache is cleared. It tracks visitors. Metrics associated with the Google __utma cookie include: first visit (unique visit), last visit (returning visit). This also includes Days and Visits to purchase calculations which afford ecommerce websites with data intelligence around purchasing sales funnels.\n\n__utmb Cookie & __utmc Cookie\n\nThese cookies work in tandem to calculate visit length. Google __utmb cookie demarks the exact arrival time, then Google __utmc registers the precise exit time of the user.\n\nBecause __utmb counts entrance visits, it is a session cookie, and expires at the end of the session, e.g. when the user leaves the page. A timestamp of 30 minutes must pass before Google cookie __utmc expires. Given__utmc cannot tell if a browser or website session ends. Therefore, if no new page view is recorded in 30 minutes the cookie is expired. This is a standard 'grace period' in web analytics. Ominture and WebTrends among many others follow the same procedure.\n\n__utmz Cookie\n\nCookie __utmz monitors the HTTP Referrer and notes where a visitor arrived from, with the referrer siloed into type (Search engine (organic or cpc), direct, social and unaccounted). From the HTTP Referrer the __utmz Cookie also registers, what keyword generated the visit plus geolocation data. This cookie lasts six months. In tracking terms this Cookie is perhaps the most important as it will tell you about your traffic and help with conversion information such as what source / medium / keyword to attribute for a Goal Conversion.\n\n__utmv Cookie\n\nGoogle __utmv Cookie lasts \"forever\". It is a persistant cookie. It is used for segmentation, data experimentation and the __utmv works hand in hand with the __utmz cookie to improve cookie targeting capabilities.\n\nDISCLOSURE and Uses made of YOUR information\n\nYour personal information will be collected, processed and used by Musgrave for the purposes of providing the Services in connection with the App or other purposes as follows:\n\nprocess your registration application,\n\ncreate and maintain accounts\n\ncalculate and charge for Musgrave services, as appropriate\n\nprovide customer care services\n\nsupply any products and services\n\ncarry out analysis of your personal information, in order develop our relationship with you and/or to develop and personalise the Services,\n\nkeep you informed about new services, developments, special offers, and any discounts or awards which we believe may be of personal interest to you, or which you may be entitled to.\n\ninform you of Musgrave sponsored events\n\ninform you of Musgrave promotions\n\ncarry out market research\n\nprevent, detect and investigate fraud, or any other criminal activity\n\ninvestigate improper use of the App;\n\ncarry out activities necessary to the running of our business, including system testing, network monitoring, staff training, quality control and any legal proceedings\n\ncarry out any activities or disclosures to comply with any regulatory, government or legal obligations\n\nachieve any other lawful purpose, including the sharing with third parties for the above purposes\n\nYour personal information will be used by Musgrave only in a manner consistent with the purpose for which we obtained it.
