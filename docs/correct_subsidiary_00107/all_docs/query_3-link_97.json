        "text": "Abstract Can we find effective substitutes for face-to-face teaching, especially for student-led problem sessions and collaborative practical work? Although Internet technology and the WWW have been hailed as a panacea for education, and 'distance education in particular, few people are making effective use of the technology or demonstrating scalable examples, especially in terms of replacing face-to-face teaching. This paper presents some models attempted and lessons learned in large-scale Internet teaching on Computing courses.\n\nUse of the Internet and Web are leading to significant changes in educational models. Effective exploitation of these changes requires adequate attention to understanding the technology, the educational processes and issues, student’s characteristics, etc. As this use of Internet is increasing, a traditional classroom has shifted to E-Learning. Thus, E-Learning can be defined an approach to facilitate and enhance learning by means of personal computers, CD-ROMs, and the Internet. It may be as simple that teachers may simply post their material on Internet,students can read it online or can download it for further access.The interaction between the professor and the student will happen via e-mail, discussion board, forums etc. Since the class doesn’t meet in a physical space at a scheduled time, the student will have to learn independently. Virtual classroom aims to simulate the experience of attending a class over the web. So everyone is able to see other participant virtually. Key words: Educational models, E-Learning, Internet, virtual."
