        "text": "Centra's Web Privacy Policy\n\nThis notice applies to all information collected by or submitted to the Centra patient/consumer website. Centra reserves the right to amend it at any time without notice.\n\nWhen you access our website(s), Centra collects information from you in three ways: (i) from your computer device and activity, (ii) with cookies and web analytics tools, and (iii) directly from you.\n\nComputer Device and Activity\n\nIP Addresses (Server Log Information) An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. Centra collects IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report Aggregate Information (as defined below) to affiliates or partners, and to conduct web site analysis. Centra will also use IP addresses to identify any users who refuse to comply with applicable Terms of Use, and to identify users who threaten the Centra service, web site, users, clients or others.\n\nComputer Activity. We may collect identification of the page or service you are requesting on our website; the type of browser and operating system you are using; the date and time of access; the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Website; and the \"cookie information\" described below.\n\nCookies and Web Analytics Tools. Centra places a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Centra uses cookies during your online session to secure your information and improve performance of our online resources. These cookies do not contain any personal information. Most browser software can be set to reject cookies. If you disable cookies in your browser, doing so will restrict your access to only public pages and you will no longer be able to access resources made available for you individually such as HealthyU. In addition to cookies, some web analytics tools used by Centra may place a single-pixel GIF file on a computer as a tracking indicator.\n\nUser-Supplied Information\n\nRegistration. Some Centra web resources, such as HealthyU registration systems, may require you to give us your contact information (such as your name and e-mail address) and demographic information (such as a ZIP code, organization and/or role). Your information is used to contact you when necessary. We may use this information gathered through HealthyU or other web pages to communicate with you about our services.\n\nServices. We may use your account and e-mail address to communicate with you about our services. If you sign up for a new service, we may collect personal information such as contact information (e.g., name, address, telephone number and alternate e-mail address), demographic information (e.g., ZIP code, organization and/or role), billing information (e.g., credit or debit card numbers), or sensitive information (e.g., healthcare information).\n\nOther User-Supplied Information. You may deliberately send other information to us via our websites and online forms, such as when you click on a link to send us an email or pay a bill online. For example, when you send us an email we collect your email address and the message content; and when you make a payment online we collect your credit card or other payment information.\n\nCentra websites may contain links to websites operated by third parties. Centra has no control over the privacy policies and practices of these third-party sites, and if you have any concerns, we encourage you to review the terms of those sites for more information about their policies.\n\nYour information is used to route the requested webpage to your computer for viewing. In theory, the requested webpage and the routing information could be discerned by other entities involved in transmitting the requested page to you. We do not control the privacy practices of those entities.\n\nWe do not rent, sell or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, except when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:\n\nDisclosures to Third Parties Assisting in Our Operations. We may provide your personal information to affiliates, subsidiaries and trusted partners who work on behalf of or with us, and who are subject to confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to assist us in our operations.\n\nAggregate Information. We may provide information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted (\"Aggregate Information\") to third parties, such as usage information and trends. When Aggregate Information is provided, it is pooled with many individual records and stripped of any data that could be used to identify you before it is used. For example, we may report that X number of individuals filled out a particular form on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women clicked on a link.\n\nDisclosures Under Special Circumstances. We may provide information about you to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take legal action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.\n\nWe use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order or request only to complete that order or request. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or request. Similarly, we use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order or request only to complete that order or request. Again, we do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or request.\n\nWe generally use return e-mail addresses only to answer the e-mail we receive, to provide requested services (such as e-newsletters) or to send updates about Centra programs and services. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ways described above without a notice on the website and without also providing you a way to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.\n\nYour Ability to Edit and Delete Your HealthU Information or Your Connection\n\nShould you decide that you no longer wish to use HealthyU you may delete your connection to HealthyU from within your Cerner Health account. This removes your access to HealthyU by removing HealthyU's ability to use your Cerner Health identity (username and password) for sign-in. Deleting the connection does not notify us that you no longer wish to receive communications in HealthyU. If you no longer wish to receive communications via HealthyU or if you wish to edit or delete your information that is maintained in HealthyU please contact us at centrahealthyu@centrahealth.com.\n\nChildren's Privacy Protection\n\nCentra websites, including, but not limited to HealthyU, are not designed for or targeted at children. We will not knowingly collect and maintain personally identifiable information directly from children under 18 years of age. In compliance with state law for the Commonwealth of Virginia, Centra will treat minors as adults when required to do so.\n\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n\nThis policy may be revised from time to time as we add new features and services, as laws change, and as industry privacy and security practices evolve. We display an effective date on the policy above so that it will be easier for you to know when there has been a change. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this policy. Your continued use of Centra websites, including, but not limited to, HealthyU constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy. Small changes or changes that do not significantly affect individual privacy interests may be made at any time and without prior notice."
