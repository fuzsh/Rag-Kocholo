First off, it’s worth noting that Saba does not seem to have been suffering like so many of its competitors through the downturn: It gained 113 new customers in 2010, which was a record year.\n\nLMSs that kick ass: Saba\n\nJanet Clarey\n\nThe sixth LMS in the LMSs that kick ass Friday series is Saba. Saba’s primary market is corporate learning with just more than half of all implementations installed behind-the-firewall (largest implementation 2,000,000 learners). Saba is a major player among corporate LMSs -you can say it’s a benchmark system.\n\nProfile of a learning architect: Tiina Paju-Pomfret\n\nClive on Learning\n\nIn this next profile, extracted from The New Learning Architect , we see another fine example of how a learning and development department has been able to break free from the confines of the face-to-face course to provide support for learning across multiple contexts.\n\nCammy Beans Learning Visions: Adobe/Bersin Overview of the eLearning Industry\n\nLearning Visions\n\nCammy Beans Learning Visions Musings on eLearning, instructional design and other training stuff. Tuesday, May 22, 2007 Adobe/Bersin Overview of the eLearning Industry I listened in this afternoon to the Adobe seminar: Overview of the eLearning Industry. 72% of training content is used informally.\n\nMulti-Generational Learning in the Workplace\n\nJanet Clarey\n\nHere are the slides from an online session I did yesterday on Multi-Generational Learning in the Workplace. This was the first time I presented on this topic and the first time I led a session using Saba’s Centra platform. Know the learning theories behind your craft damn it! Multi Generational Learning."
