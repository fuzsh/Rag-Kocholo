        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis study investigates lecturers’ experiences of employing blended learning in a vocational education context. The participants were six full-time lecturers working in three different departments at the institution. All of them have at least one-year experience teaching in a blended learning setting. Open-ended questions were utilized to collect their conceptions of blended learning, their approaches to teach as well as the challenges they encountered in blended learning courses. Semi-structured interviews were employed, and the lecturers’ responses were content-analyzed. The findings reveal that the lecturers illustrated a wide spectrum of ideas about the nature of blended learning. They also provided information about various approaches they use to teach in the blended learning courses. In addition, a number of challenges confronted by lecturers during the blended learning courses are seen leading to the need to have prompt actions. The findings are valuable for the stake holders at the institution who would like to ensure the quality and sustainability of the blended learning implementation.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nLTD. (n.d.).
