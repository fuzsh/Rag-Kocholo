        "text": "AcqKnowledge software utilizes guided channel setting dialogs, allowing the user to easily input channel data parameters. Once parameters are established, recording settings can be saved as a graph template for future use. This allows for instant start up for subsequent recording sessions.\n\nDuring recording, see real-time live raw physiological data as well as real-time filtering or calculation channels such as Heart Rate, Respiration Rate, etc. Easily insert markers for different stimuli presentation or experimental conditions throughout recording or interface with a stimulus presentation program such as SuperLab® or E-Prime® for automatic stimulus delivery and markers.\n\nExample file with various markers denoting unique stimuli in AcqKnowledge\n\nPhysiological data and stimulation events can also be synchronized to video recording via BIOPAC Camera Systems. With Camera Systems AcqKnowledge data and Video Data are time linked. Simply scroll through either the video or physiological data to be taken to the corresponding data point in the other file.\n\nAcqKnowledge Data with Time-Synchronized Video\n\nAfter recording, take advantage of fully automated Stim-Response analysis routines in AcqKnowledge. Use guided video tutorials to get the most out of all available analysis tools.\n\nStimulation-Response Automated Analysis Package Overview\n\nDigital Inputs to Stim Events\n\nDigital Input to stim events identifies and labels stimulus events corresponding to any combination of digital inputs. A light bulb icon is placed in the global event marker bar, the event is labeled with the stimulus event type, and the mouse-over tag includes the event time. All event information is accessible and exportable from the Event Palette.\n\nThe Digital input to stim events function works with TTL trigger information coming from applications such as E-Prime®, SuperLab®, DirectRT®, MediaLab®, Inquisit®, and Presentation. It converts TTL data acquired on the digital channels of an MP device into stimulus events. The system also works with analog and calculation channel signals coming from switch transducers.\n\nSee Digital Inputs to Stim Events in Action:\n\nStim-Response Analysis\n\nStim-Response Analysis extracts measurements within fixed width intervals occurring at/around Stimulus Delivery events. Stimulus events must be present to perform this analysis. The Stimulus Delivery events can be defined either manually, with the Cycle Detector, or using the Digital Input to Stim Events analysis option. Measurements extracted can be customized and include most measures available from the AcqKnowledge Measurement drop-down boxes (BPM, Delta T, Max, Min, Mean, P-P, etc.)\n\nAnalysis results for each individual stimulus type are summarized in separate tables either in the journal or exported as an Excel spreadsheet. Each independent text table contains an average of each chosen measurement over that stimulus type.\n\nSee Stim-Response Analysis in Action:\n\nNoldus Observer XT Import/Export\n\nNoldus Observer XT is a popular Human Behavioral analysis software package. AcqKnowledge allows behavioral markers from Noldus to be imported into AcqKnowledge and AcqKnowledge marker information to be exported into Noldus Observer XT Software.\n\nThe Import markers feature will read the Noldus file data and define the events in the active AcqKnowledge graph. For each range of behavior, a pair of global markers will be added with labels correlating to the behavior type as well as the start of and end of the behavior.\n\nLearn more about the Noldus Observer XT import/export feature:\n\nSMI BeGaze Import and Synchronization\n\nSynchronize and merge BIOPAC physiological data and SMI BeGaze eye tracking data with AcqKnowledge 4.3 or above. Connect the SMI parallel port to BIOPAC isolated digital interface STP100C, then set SMI experiment center to send a trigger with each stimulus presentation, and set AcqKnowledge to record the triggers on a digital channel. When SMI data is imported and merged with an AcqKnowledge file, the trigger data is used to precisely align the data. Using the merged data, it’s easy to explore the relationship between a stimulus presentation and the physiological response that follows.\n\nLearn more about the SMI BeGaze import/synchronization feature:\n\nGet Started!\n\nRecord high-fidelity physiological data either wirelessly with BioNomadix or with standard wired amplifiers while presenting visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli. Contact BIOPAC today to customize a complete package with amplifiers, leads, electrodes, and/or transducers for your application."
