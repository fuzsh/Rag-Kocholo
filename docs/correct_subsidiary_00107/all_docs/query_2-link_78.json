        "text": "(a) If the contractor has furnished a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) when completing the solicitation provision at 52.204-3, Taxpayer Identification, or paragraph (l) of the solicitation provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, the contracting officer shall, unless otherwise provided in agency procedures, attach a copy of the completed solicitation provision as the last page of the copy of the contract sent to the payment office.\n\n(b) If the TIN or type of organization is derived from a source other than the provision at 52.204-3 or 52.212-3(l), the contracting officer shall annotate the last page of the contract or order forwarded to the payment office to state the contractor’s TIN and type of organization, unless this information is otherwise provided to the payment office in accordance with agency procedures.\n\n(c) If the contractor provides its TIN or type of organization to the contracting officer after award, the contracting officer shall forward the information to the payment office within 7 days of its receipt.\n\n(d) Federal Supply Schedule contracts. Each contracting officer that places an order under a Federal Supply Schedule contract (see subpart 8.4) shall provide the TIN and type of organization information to the payment office in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(e) Basic ordering agreements and indefinite-delivery contracts (other than Federal Supply Schedule contracts).\n\n(1) Each contracting officer that issues a basic ordering agreement or indefinite-delivery contract (other than a Federal Supply Schedule contract) shall provide to contracting officers placing orders under the agreement or contract (if the contractor is not required to provide this information to the System for Award Management)-\n\n(i) A copy of the agreement or contract with a copy of the completed solicitation provision at 52.204-3 or 52.212-3(l) as the last page of the agreement or contract; or\n\n(ii) The contractor’s TIN and type of organization information.\n\n(2) Each contracting officer that places an order under a basic ordering agreement or indefinite-delivery contract (other than a Federal Supply Schedule contract) shall provide the TIN and type of organization information to the payment office in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.\n\n(a) Executive Order12829, January 6, 1993 (58 FR3479, January 8, 1993), entitled \"National Industrial Security Program\" (NISP), establishes a program to safeguard Federal Government classified information that is released to contractors, licensees, and grantees of the United States Government. Executive Order 12829 amends Executive Order 10865, February 20, 1960 (25 FR1583, February 25, 1960), entitled \"Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,\" as amended by Executive Order 10909, January 17, 1961 (26 FR508, January 20, 1961).\n\n(b) The National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) incorporates the requirements of these Executive orders. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with all affected agencies and with the concurrence of the Secretary of Energy, the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, is responsible for issuance and maintenance of this Manual. The following publications implement the program:\n\n(1) National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (32 CFR part 117).\n\n(2) DoD Manual 5220.22, Volume 2, National Industrial Security Program: Industrial Security Procedures for Government Activities.\n\n(c) Procedures for the protection of information relating to foreign classified contracts awarded to U.S. industry, and instructions for the protection of U.S. information relating to classified contracts awarded to foreign firms, are prescribed in 32 CFR 117.19.\n\n(d) Nondefense agencies that have industrial security services agreements with DoD, and DoD components, shall use the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, to provide security classification guidance to U.S. contractors, and subcontractors as applicable, requiring access to information classified as \"Confidential\", \"Secret\", or \"Top Secret\".\n\n(1) Provided that the data submittal is unclassified, the DD Form 254 shall be completed electronically in the NISP Contract Classification System (NCCS), which is accessible at https://www.dcsa.mil/is/nccs/ . Nondefense agencies with an existing DD Form 254 information system may use that system.\n\n(2)\n\n(i) A contractor, or subcontractor (if applicable), requiring access to classified information under a contract shall be identified with a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code on the DD Form 254 (see subpart 4.18 for information on obtaining and validating CAGE codes).\n\n(ii) Each location of contractor or subcontractor performance listed on the DD Form 254 is required to reflect a corresponding unique CAGE code for each listed location unless the work is being performed at a Government facility, in which case the agency location code shall be used. Each subcontractor location requiring access to classified information must be listed on the DD Form 254.\n\n(iii) Contractor and subcontractor performance locations listed on the DD Form 254 are not required to be separately registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) solely for the purposes of a DD Form 254 (see subpart 4.11 for information on registering in SAM).\n\n(e) Part 27, Patents, Data, and Copyrights, contains policy and procedures for safeguarding classified information in patent applications and patents.\n\n(a) Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID). Agencies shall have in place a process that ensures that each PIID reported to FPDS is unique Governmentwide, for all solicitations, contracts, blanket purchase agreements, basic agreements, basic ordering agreements, or orders in accordance with 4.1601 to 4.1603, and will remain so for at least 20 years from the date of contract award. Other pertinent PIID instructions for FPDS reporting can be found at https://www.fpds.gov.\n\n(b) Unique entity identifier. The contracting officer shall identify and report a unique entity identifier for the successful offeror on a contract action. The unique entity identifier shall correspond to the successful offeror's name and address as stated in the offer and resultant contract, and as registered in the System for Award Management in accordance with the provision at 52.204-7, System for Award Management. The contracting officer shall ask the offeror to provide its unique entity identifier by using either the provision at 52.204-6, Unique Entity Identifier, the provision at 52.204-7, System for Award Management, or the provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Products and Commercial Services. (For a discussion of the Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, which is a different identifier, see subpart 4.18.)\n\n(c) Generic entity identifier.\n\n(1) The use of a generic entity identifier should be limited, and only used in the situations described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Use of a generic entity identifier does not supersede the requirements of provisions 52.204-6, Unique Entity Identifier or 52.204-7 System for Award Management (if present in the solicitation) for the contractor to have a unique entity identifier assigned.\n\n(2) Authorized generic entity identifiers, maintained by the Integrated Award Environment (IAE) program office ( http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105036), may be used to report contracts in lieu of the contractor's actual unique entity identifier only for—\n\n(i) Contract actions valued at or below $30,000 that are awarded to a contractor that is-\n\n(A) A student;\n\n(B) A dependent of either a veteran, foreign service officer, or military member assigned outside the United States and its outlying areas (as defined in 2.101); or\n\n(C) Located outside the United States and its outlying areas for work to be performed outside the United States and its outlying areas and the contractor does not otherwise have a unique entity identifier;\n\n(ii) Contracts valued above $30,000 awarded to individuals located outside the United States and its outlying areas for work to be performed outside the United States and its outlying areas; or\n\n(iii) Contracts when specific public identification of the contracted party could endanger the mission, contractor, or recipients of the acquired goods or services. The contracting officer must include a written determination in the contract file of a decision applicable to authority under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii).\n\n(d) American Recovery and Reinvestment Act actions. The contracting officer, when entering data in FPDS, shall use the instructions at https://www.fpds.gov to identify any action funded in whole or in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5).\n\n(e) Office codes. Agencies shall by March 31, 2016—\n\n(1) Use the Activity Address Code (AAC), as defined in 2.101, assigned to the issuing contracting office as the contracting office code, and\n\n(2) Use the AAC assigned to the program/funding office providing the predominance of funding for the contract action as the program/funding office code.\n\n(a) Actions required to be reported to FPDS.\n\n(1) As a minimum, agencies must report the following contract actions over the micro-purchase threshold, regardless of solicitation process used, and agencies must report any modification to these contract actions that change previously reported contract action data, regardless of dollar value:\n\n(i) Definitive contracts, including purchase orders and imprest fund buys over the micro-purchase threshold awarded by a contracting officer.\n\n(ii) Indefinite delivery vehicle (identified as an \"IDV\" in FPDS). Examples of IDVs include the following:\n\n(A) Task and Delivery Order Contracts (see subpart 16.5), including–\n\n(1) Government-wide acquisition contracts.\n\n(2) Multi-agency contracts.\n\n(B) GSA Federal supply schedules.\n\n(C) Blanket Purchase Agreements (see 13.303).\n\n(D) Basic Ordering Agreements (see 16.703).\n\n(E) Any other agreement or contract against which individual orders or purchases may be placed.\n\n(iii) All calls and orders awarded under the indefinite delivery vehicles identified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.\n\n(2) The GSA Office of Charge Card Management will provide the Government purchase card data, at a minimum annually, and GSA will incorporate that data into FPDS for reports.\n\n(3) Agencies may use the FPDS Express Reporting capability for consolidated multiple action reports for a vendor when it would be overly burdensome to report each action individually. When used, Express Reporting should be done at least monthly.\n\n(b) Reporting other actions. Agencies may submit actions other than those listed at paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if they are able to be segregated from FAR-based actions and this is approved in writing by the FPDS Program Office. Prior to the commencement of reporting, agencies must contact the FPDS Program Office if they desire to submit any of the following types of activity:\n\n(1) Transactions at or below the micro-purchase threshold, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n\n(2) Any non-appropriated fund (NAF) or NAF portion of a contract action using a mix of appropriated and non-appropriated funding.\n\n(3) Lease and supplemental lease agreements for real property.\n\n(4) Grants and entitlement actions.\n\n(c) Actions not reported. The following types of contract actions are not to be reported to FPDS:\n\n(1) Imprest fund transactions below the micro-purchase threshold, including those made via the Government purchase card (unless specific agency procedures prescribe reporting these actions).\n\n(2) Orders from GSA stock and the GSA Global Supply Program.\n\n(3) Purchases made at GSA or AbilityOne service stores, as these items stocked for resale have already been reported by GSA.\n\n(4) Purchases made using non-appropriated fund activity cards, chaplain fund cards, individual Government personnel training orders, and Defense Printing orders.\n\n(5) Actions that, pursuant to other authority, will not be entered in FPDS (e.g., reporting of the information would compromise national security).\n\n(6) Contract actions in which the required data would constitute classified information.\n\n(7) Resale activity (i.e., commissary or exchange activity).\n\n(8) Revenue generating arrangements (i.e., concessions).\n\n(9) Training expenditures not issued as orders or contracts.\n\n(10) Interagency agreements other than inter-agency acquisitions required to be reported at 4.606(a)(1).\n\n(11) Letters of obligation used in the A-76 process.\n\n(d) Agencies not subject to the FAR. Agencies not subject to the FAR may be required by other authority (e.g., statute, OMB, or internal agency policy) to report certain information to FPDS. Those agencies not subject to the FAR must first receive approval from the FPDS Program Office prior to reporting to FPDS.\n\n(a) Except as stated in 4.703(b), contractors shall make available records, which includes books, documents, accounting procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and regardless of whether such items are in written form, in the form of computer data, or in any other form, and other supporting evidence to satisfy contract negotiation, administration, and audit requirements of the contracting agencies and the Comptroller General for-\n\n(1) 3 years after final payment; or\n\n(2) For certain records the period specified in 4.705 through 4.705-3, whichever of these periods expires first.\n\n(b) Contractors shall make available the foregoing records and supporting evidence for a longer period of time than is required in 4.703(a) if-\n\n(1) A retention period longer than that cited in 4.703(a) is specified in any contract clause; or\n\n(2) The contractor, for its own purposes, retains the foregoing records and supporting evidence for a longer period. Under this circumstance, the retention period shall be the period of the contractor’s retention or 3 years after final payment, whichever period expires first.\n\n(3) The contractor does not meet the original due date for submission of final indirect cost rate proposals specified in paragraph (d)(2) of the clause at 52.216-7, Allowable Cost and Payment. Under these circumstances, the retention periods in 4.705 shall be automatically extended one day for each day the proposal is not submitted after the original due date.\n\n(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude a contractor from duplicating or storing original records in electronic form unless they contain significant information not shown on the record copy. Original records need not be maintained or produced in an audit if the contractor or subcontractor provides photographic or electronic images of the original records and meets the following requirements:\n\n(1) The contractor or subcontractor has established procedures to ensure that the imaging process preserves accurate images of the original records, including signatures and other written or graphic images, and that the imaging process is reliable and secure so as to maintain the integrity of the records.\n\n(2) The contractor or subcontractor maintains an effective indexing system to permit timely and convenient access to the imaged records.\n\n(3) The contractor or subcontractor retains the original records for a minimum of one year after imaging to permit periodic validation of the imaging systems.\n\n(d) If the information described in paragraph (a) of this section is maintained on a computer, contractors shall retain the computer data on a reliable medium for the time periods prescribed. Contractors may transfer computer data in machine readable form from one reliable computer medium to another. Contractors’ computer data retention and transfer procedures shall maintain the integrity, reliability, and security of the original computer data. Contractors shall also retain an audit trail describing the data transfer. For the record retention time periods prescribed, contractors shall not destroy, discard, delete, or write over such computer data.\n\nThe following are examples of the records normally contained, if applicable, in contract files:\n\n(a) Contracting office contract file.\n\n(1) Purchase request, acquisition planning information, and other presolicitation documents.\n\n(2) Justifications and approvals, determinations and findings, and associated documents.\n\n(3) Evidence of availability of funds.\n\n(4) Synopsis of proposed acquisition as required by part 5 or a reference to the synopsis.\n\n(5) The list of sources solicited, and a list of any firms or persons whose requests for copies of the solicitation were denied, together with the reasons for denial.\n\n(6) Set-aside decision (see 19.1506) including the type and extent of market research conducted.\n\n(7) Government estimate of contract price.\n\n(8) A copy of the solicitation and all amendments thereto.\n\n(9) Security requirements and evidence of required clearances.\n\n(10) A copy of each offer or quotation, the related abstract, and records of determinations concerning late offers or quotations. Unsuccessful offers or quotations may be maintained separately, if cross-referenced to the contract file. The only portions of the unsuccessful offer or quotation that need be retained are-\n\n(i) Completed solicitation sections A, B, and K;\n\n(ii) Technical and management proposals;\n\n(iii) Cost/price proposals; and\n\n(iv) Any other pages of the solicitation that the offeror or quoter has altered or annotated.\n\n(11) Contractor’s representations and certifications (see 4.1201(c)).\n\n(12) Preaward survey reports or reference to previous preaward survey reports relied upon.\n\n(13) Source selection documentation.\n\n(14) Contracting officer’s determination of the contractor’s responsibility.\n\n(15) Small Business Administration Certificate of Competency.\n\n(16) Records of contractor’s compliance with labor policies including equal employment opportunity policies.\n\n(17) Data and information related to the contracting officer’s determination of a fair and reasonable price.

Contracting officers shall make no changes to the data retrieved from SAM.\n\n(d)\n\n(1)\n\n(i) If a contractor has legally changed its business name or \"doing business as\" name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the contractor is required to provide the responsible contracting officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to change the name in SAM, comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12, and agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible contracting officer. Along with the notification, the contractor is required to provide the contracting officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.\n\n(ii) If the contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of the clause at 52.204-13, System for Award Management Maintenance, or fails to perform the agreement at 52.204-13, paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C), and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the contractor to be other than the contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the \"Suspension of Payment\" paragraph of the EFT clause of the contract.\n\n(2) The contractor shall not change the name or address for electronic funds transfer payments (EFT) or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).\n\n(3) Assignees shall be separately registered in SAM. Information provided to the contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the \"Suspension of payment\" paragraph of the EFT clause of the contract.\n\n(a) Establishment of a Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID). Agencies shall have in place a process that ensures that each PIID used to identify a solicitation or contract action is unique Governmentwide, and will remain so for at least 20 years from the date of contract award. The PIID shall be used to identify all solicitation and contract actions. The PIID shall also be used to identify solicitation and contract actions in designated support and reporting systems (e.g., Federal Procurement Data System, System for Award Management), in accordance with regulations, applicable authorities, and agency policies and procedures.)\n\n(b) Transition of PIID numbering. No later than October 1, 2017, agencies shall comply with paragraph (a) of this section and use the requirements in 4.1602 and 4.1603 for all new solicitations and contract awards. Until an agency’s transition is complete, it shall maintain its 2013 PIID format that is on record with the General Services Administration’s Integrated Award Environment Program Office (which maintains a registry of the agency unique identifier scheme). The 2013 PIID format consisted of alpha characters in the first positions to indicate the agency, followed by alpha-numeric characters; the 2017 format instead has the AAC in the beginning 6 positions.\n\n(c) Change in the Procurement Instrument Identifier after its assignment.\n\n(1) Agencies shall not change the PIID unless one of the following two circumstances apply:\n\n(i) The PIID serial numbering system is exhausted. In this instance, the contracting officer may assign a new PIID by issuing a contract modification.\n\n(ii) Continued use of a PIID is administratively burdensome (e.g., for implementations of new agency contract writing systems). In this instance, the contracting officer may assign a new PIID by issuing a contract modification.\n\n(2) The modification shall clearly identify both the original and the newly assigned PIID. Issuance of a new PIID is an administrative change (see 43.101).\n\n(a) Identifying the PIID in solicitation and contract award documentation (including forms and electronic generated formats). Agencies shall include all PIIDs for all related procurement actions as identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.\n\n(1) Solicitation. Identify the PIID for all solicitations. For amendments to solicitations, identify a supplementary PIID, in conjunction with the PIID for the solicitation.\n\n(2) Contracts and purchase orders. Identify the PIID for contracts and purchase orders.\n\n(3) Delivery and task orders. For delivery and task orders placed by an agency under a contract (e.g., indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, multi-agency contracts (MAC), Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs), or Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contracts), identify the PIID for the delivery and task order and the PIID for the contract.\n\n(4) Blanket purchase agreements and basic ordering agreements. Identify the PIID for blanket purchase agreements issued in accordance with 13.303, and for basic agreements and basic ordering agreements issued in accordance with subpart 16.7. For blanket purchase agreements issued in accordance with subpart 8.4 under a MAS contract, identify the PIID for the blanket purchase agreement and the PIID for the MAS contract.\n\n(i) Orders. For orders against basic ordering agreements or blanket purchase agreements issued in accordance with 13.303, identify the PIID for the order and the PIID for the blanket purchase agreement or basic ordering agreement.\n\n(ii) Orders under subpart 8.4. For orders against a blanket purchase agreement established under a MAS contract, identify the PIID for the order, the PIID for the blanket purchase agreement, and the PIID for the MAS contract.\n\n(5) Modifications. For modifications to actions described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (4) of this section, and in accordance with agency procedures, identify a supplementary PIID for the modification in conjunction with the PIID for the contract, order, or agreement being modified.\n\n(b) Placement of the PIID on forms. When the form (including electronic generated format) does not provide spaces or fields for the PIID or supplementary PIID required in paragraph (a) of this section, identify the PIID in accordance with agency procedures.\n\n(c) Additional agency specific identification information. If agency procedures require additional identification information in solicitations, contracts, or other related procurement instruments for administrative purposes, separate and clearly identify the additional information from the PIID.\n\n(a) Elements of a PIID. The PIID consists of a combination of thirteen to seventeen alpha and/or numeric characters sequenced to convey certain information. Do not use special characters (such as hyphens, dashes, or spaces).\n\n(1) Positions 1 through 6. The first six positions identify the department/agency and office issuing the instrument. Use the AAC assigned to the issuing office for positions 1 through 6. Civilian agency points of contact for obtaining an AAC are on the AAC Contact list maintained by the General Services Administration and can be found at https://community.max.gov/x/24foL. For Department of Defense (DoD) inquiries, contact the service/agency Central Service Point or DoD AAC Monitor, or if unknown, email DODAADHQ@DLA.MIL for assistance.\n\n(2) Positions 7 through 8. The seventh and eighth positions are the last two digits of the fiscal year in which the procurement instrument is issued or awarded. This is the date the action is signed, not the effective date if the effective date is different.\n\n(3) Position 9. Indicate the type of instrument by entering one of the following upper case letters in position nine. Departments and independent agencies may assign those letters identified for department use below in accordance with their agency policy; however, any use must be applied to the entire department or agency.\n\nInstrument Letter designation\n\n(4) Positions 10 through 17. Enter the number assigned by the issuing agency in these positions. Agencies may choose a minimum of four characters up to a maximum of eight characters to be used, but the same number of characters must be used agency-wide. If a number less than the maximum is used, do not use leading or trailing zeroes to make it equal the maximum in any system or data transmission. A separate series of numbers may be used for any type of instrument listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. An agency may reserve blocks of numbers or alpha-numeric numbers for use by its various components.\n\n(5) Illustration of PIID. The following illustrates a properly configured PIID using four characters in the final positions:\n\n(b) Elements of a supplementary PIID. Use the supplementary PIID to identify amendments to solicitations and modifications to contracts, orders, and agreements. The supplementary PIID is reported as a separate data element used in conjunction with, but not appended to, the PIID.\n\n(1) Amendments to solicitations. Number amendments to solicitations sequentially using a four position numeric serial number added to the 13-17 character PIID beginning with 0001.\n\n(2) Modifications to contracts, orders, and agreements. Number modifications to contracts, orders, and agreements using a six position alpha or numeric, or a combination thereof, added to the 13-17 character PIID. For example, a modification could be numbered P00001. This would be added to the end of the 13-17 character PIID illustrated in (a)(5) of this section.\n\n(i) Position 1. Identify the office issuing the modification. The letter P shall be designated for modifications issued by the procuring contracting office. The letter A shall be used for modifications issued by the contract administration office (if other than the procuring contracting office).\n\n(ii) Positions 2 through 6. These positions may be alpha, numeric, or a combination thereof, in accordance with agency procedures.\n\n(iii) Each office authorized to issue modifications shall assign the supplementary identification numbers in sequence (unless provided otherwise in agency procedures). Do not assign the numbers until it has been determined that a modification is to be issued.\n\n(a) Thresholds.\n\n(1) Except as exempted by OFPP guidance, service contractor reporting shall be required for contracts and first-tier subcontracts for services based on type of contract and estimated total value. For indefinite-delivery contracts, reporting shall be determined based on the type and estimated total value of each order under the contract. Indefinite-delivery contracts include, but are not limited to, contracts such as indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts, Federal Supply Schedule contracts (FSSs), Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs), and multi-agency contracts.\n\n(2) Reporting is required according to the following thresholds:\n\n(i) All cost-reimbursement, time-and-materials, and labor-hour service contracts and orders with an estimated total value above the simplified acquisition threshold.\n\n(ii) All fixed-price service contracts awarded and orders issued according to the following thresholds:\n\n(A) Awarded or issued in Fiscal Year 2014, with an estimated total value of $2.5 million or greater.\n\n(B) Awarded or issued in Fiscal Year 2015, with an estimated total value of $1 million or greater.\n\n(C) Awarded or issued in Fiscal Year 2016, and subsequent years, with an estimated total value of $500,000 or greater.\n\n(3) Reporting is required for all first-tier subcontracts for services as prescribed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.\n\n(b) Agency reporting responsibilities.\n\n(1) Agencies shall ensure that contractors comply with the reporting requirements of 52.204-14, Service Contract Reporting Requirements and 52.204-15, Service Contract Reporting Requirements for Indefinite-Delivery Contracts. Agencies shall review contractor reported information for reasonableness and consistency with available contract information. The agency is not required to address data for which the agency would not normally have supporting information. In the event the agency believes that revisions to the contractor reported information are warranted, the agency shall notify the contractor no later than November 15. By November 30, the contractor shall revise the report, or document its rationale for the agency. Authorized agency officials may review the reports at www.sam.gov.\n\n(2) Agencies are required to compile annually an inventory of service contracts performed for, or on behalf of, the agency during the prior fiscal year in order to determine the extent of the agency’s reliance on service contractors. Agencies shall submit a service contract inventory to OMB by January 15 annually. Then, each agency must post the inventory on its Web site and publish a Federal Register Notice of Availability by February 15 annually.\n\n(3) Most of the required information is already collected in the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). Information not collected in FPDS will be provided by the contractor, as specified in 52.204-14, Service Contract Reporting Requirements and 52.204-15, Service Contract Reporting Requirements for Indefinite-Delivery Contracts.\n\nAs used in this subpart—\n\nBackhaul means intermediate links between the core network, or backbone network, and the small subnetworks at the edge of the network (e.g., connecting cell phones/towers to the core telephone network). Backhaul can be wireless (e.g., microwave) or wired (e.g., fiber optic, coaxial cable, Ethernet).\n\nCovered foreign country means The People’s Republic of China.\n\nCovered telecommunications equipment or services means–\n\n(1) Telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei Technologies Company or ZTE Corporation, (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entities);\n\n(2) For the purpose of public safety, security of Government facilities, physical security surveillance of critical infrastructure, and other national security purposes, video surveillance and telecommunications equipment produced by Hytera Communications Corporation, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company, or Dahua Technology Company (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entities);\n\n(3) Telecommunications or video surveillance services provided by such entities or using such equipment; or\n\n(4) Telecommunications or video surveillance equipment or services produced or provided by an entity that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence or the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, reasonably believes to be an entity owned or controlled by, or otherwise connected to, the government of a covered foreign country.\n\nCritical technology means–\n\n(1) Defense articles or defense services included on the United States Munitions List set forth in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations under subchapter M of chapter I of title 22, Code of Federal Regulations;\n\n(2) Items included on the Commerce Control List set forth in Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the Export Administration Regulations under subchapter C of chapter VII of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations, and controlled-\n\n(i) Pursuant to multilateral regimes, including for reasons relating to national security, chemical and biological weapons proliferation, nuclear nonproliferation, or missile technology; or\n\n(ii) For reasons relating to regional stability or surreptitious listening;\n\n(3) Specially designed and prepared nuclear equipment, parts and components, materials, software, and technology covered by part 810 of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations (relating to assistance to foreign atomic energy activities);\n\n(4) Nuclear facilities, equipment, and material covered by part 110 of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations (relating to export and import of nuclear equipment and material);\n\n(5) Select agents and toxins covered by part 331 of title 7, Code of Federal Regulations, part 121 of title 9 of such Code, or part 73 of title 42 of such Code; or\n\n(6) Emerging and foundational technologies controlled pursuant to section 1758 of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. 4817).\n\nInterconnection arrangements means arrangements governing the physical connection of two or more networks to allow the use of another's network to hand off traffic where it is ultimately delivered (e.g., connection of a customer of telephone provider A to a customer of telephone company B) or sharing data and other information resources.\n\nReasonable inquiry means an inquiry designed to uncover any information in the entity's possession about the identity of the producer or provider of covered telecommunications equipment or services used by the entity that excludes the need to include an internal or third-party audit.\n\nRoaming means cellular communications services (e.g., voice, video, data) received from a visited network when unable to connect to the facilities of the home network either because signal coverage is too weak or because traffic is too high.\n\nSubstantial or essential component means any component necessary for the proper function or performance of a piece of equipment, system, or service.\n\n(a) Prohibited equipment, systems, or services.\n\n(1) On or after August 13, 2019, agencies are prohibited from procuring or obtaining, or extending or renewing a contract to procure or obtain, any equipment, system, or service that uses covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system, unless an exception at paragraph (b) of this section applies or the covered telecommunications equipment or services are covered by a waiver described in 4.2104.\n\n(2) On or after August 13, 2020, agencies are prohibited from entering into a contract, or extending or renewing a contract, with an entity that uses any equipment, system, or service that uses covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system, unless an exception at paragraph (b) of this section applies or the covered telecommunications equipment or services are covered by a waiver described in 4.2104.

The applicability of FASCSA orders to a particular acquisition depends on the contracting office's agency, the scope of the FASCSA order, the funding, and whether the requirement involves certain types of information systems (see the definition of FASCSA order at 4.2301). The contracting officer shall coordinate with the program office or requiring activity to identify the FASCSA order(s) that apply to the acquisition as follows:\n\n(1) Unless the program office or requiring activity instructs the contracting officer otherwise, FASCSA orders apply as follows: contracts awarded by civilian agencies will be subject to DHS FASCSA orders, and contracts awarded by the Department of Defense will be subject to DoD FASCSA orders. See paragraph (b) of 52.204-30, Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders-Prohibition.\n\n(2) For acquisitions where the program office or the requiring activity instructs the contracting officer to select specific FASCSA orders, the contracting officer must select “yes” or “no” for each applicable type of FASCSA order ( i.e., “DHS FASCSA Order” “DoD FASCSA Order” or “DNI FASCSA Order”). See paragraph (b)(1) of 52.204-30, Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders—Prohibition, with its Alternate I.\n\n(b) Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts, multi-agency contracts specific procedures—\n\n(1) Applying FASCSA orders. An agency awarding this type of contract may choose to apply FASCSA orders in accordance with agency policy as follows:\n\n(i) Application at the contract level. The agency awarding the basic contract may choose to apply FASCSA orders to the basic contract award. This is the preferred method, especially if small value orders or orders without a request for quotation (RFQ) are expected. Ordering activity contracting officers may use this contract vehicle without taking further steps to identify applicable FASCSA orders in the order. The contracting officer awarding the basic contract would select “yes” for all FASCSA orders ( i.e., “DHS FASCSA Order” “DoD FASCSA Order” and “DNI FASCSA Order”) (see paragraph (b)(1) of 52.204-30, Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders—Prohibition, with its Alternate I). If the contracting officer becomes aware of a newly issued applicable FASCSA order, then the agency awarding the basic contract shall modify the basic contract to remove any covered article, or any products or services produced or provided by a source, prohibited by the newly issued FASCSA order.\n\n(ii) Application at the order level. The agency awarding the basic contract may choose to apply FASCSA orders at the order level, as implemented by the ordering activity contracting officer.\n\n(2) Collective FASCSA orders. If a new FASCSA order is issued collectively by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence, then the contracting officer shall modify the basic contract based upon the requirements of the order, removing any covered article, or any products or services produced or provided by a source (see 4.2303(b)).\n\n(3) Interagency acquisitions. For an interagency acquisition (see subpart 17.5) where the funding agency differs from the awarding agency, the funding agency shall determine the applicable FASCSA orders.\n\n(4) Inconsistencies. If any inconsistency is identified between the basic contract and the order, then the FASCSA orders identified in the order will take precedence.\n\n(c) Updating the solicitation or contract for new FASCSA orders. The contracting officer shall update a solicitation or contract if the program office or requiring activity determines it is necessary to:\n\n(1) Amend the solicitation to incorporate FASCSA orders in effect after the date the solicitation was issued but prior to contract award; or\n\n(2) Modify the contract to incorporate FASCSA orders issued after the date of contract award.\n\n(i) Any such modification should take place within a reasonable amount of time, but no later than 6 months from the determination of the program office or requiring activity.\n\n(ii) If the contract is not modified within the time specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, then the contract file shall be documented providing rationale why the contract could not be modified within this timeframe.\n\n(d) Agency specific procedures. The contracting officer shall follow agency procedures for implementing FASCSA orders not identified in SAM (see 4.2303(c)(2)).\n\n(e) Disclosures. If an offeror provides a disclosure pursuant to paragraph (e) of 52.204-29, Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders—Representation and Disclosures, the contracting officer shall engage with the program office or requiring activity to determine whether to pursue a waiver, if available, in accordance with 4.2305 and agency procedures or not award to that offeror. For FASCSA orders handled at the order level, the disclosures language is found at paragraph (b)(5) of 52.204-30, Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders—Prohibition, with its Alternate II.\n\n(f) Waiver. An acquisition may be either fully or partially covered by a waiver. Partial waiver coverage occurs when only portions of the products or services being procured or provided by a source are covered by an applicable waiver. If the requiring activity notifies the contracting officer that the acquisition is partially covered by an approved individual waiver or class waiver under 4.2305, then the contracting officer shall work with the program office or requiring activity to identify in the solicitation, RFQ, or order, the covered articles or services produced by or provided by a source that are subject to the waiver (see 41 CFR 201–1.304(b)).\n\n(g) Reporting. If a contractor provides a report pursuant to paragraph (c) of 52.204-30, Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders—Prohibition, the contracting officer shall engage with the agency supply chain risk management program in accordance with agency procedures.\n\n(a) An executive agency required to comply with a FASCSA order may submit a request that the order or some of its provisions not apply to—\n\n(1) The agency;\n\n(2) Specific actions of the agency or a specific class of acquisitions;\n\n(3) Actions of the agency for a period of time before compliance with the order is practicable; or\n\n(4) Other activities, as appropriate, that the requesting agency identifies.\n\n(b) A request for waiver shall be submitted by the executive agency in writing to the official that issued the order, unless other instructions for submission are provided by the applicable FASCSA order.\n\n(c) The request for waiver shall provide the following information for the issuing official to review and evaluate the request, including—\n\n(1) Identification of the applicable FASCSA order;\n\n(2) A description of the exception sought, including, if limited to only a portion of the order, a description of the order provisions from which an exception is sought;\n\n(3) The name or a description sufficient to identify the covered article or the product or service provided by a source that is subject to the order from which an exception is sought;\n\n(4) Compelling justification for why an exception should be granted, such as the impact of the order on the agency's ability to fulfill its mission-critical functions, or considerations related to the national interest, including national security reviews, national security investigations, or national security agreements;\n\n(5) Any alternative mitigations to be undertaken to reduce the risks addressed by the FASCSA order; and\n\n(6) Any other information requested by the issuing official.\n\n(d) The contracting officer, in accordance with agency procedures and working with the program office or requiring activity, shall decide whether to pursue a waiver or to make award to an offeror that does not require a waiver in accordance with the procedures at 4.2304(f). If a waiver is being pursued, then the contracting officer may not make an award until written approval is obtained that the waiver has been granted.\n\n(a) In all Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts, and multi-agency contracts where FASCSA orders are applied at the order level, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.204-28, Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders—Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts, and Multi-Agency Contracts, in the basic contract solicitation and resultant contract (see 4.2304(b)(1)(ii)).\n\n(b) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 52.204-29, Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders—Representation and Disclosures—\n\n(1) In all solicitations, except for Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts, and multi-agency contracts.\n\n(2) In all solicitations for Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts, and multi-agency contracts, if FASCSA orders are applied at the contract level (see 4.2304(b)(1)(i)).\n\n(c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.204-30, Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders—Prohibition—\n\n(1) In solicitations and contracts if the conditions specified at 4.2304(a)(1) apply, except for Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts, and multi-agency contracts. For acquisitions where conditions specified at 4.2304(a)(2) apply, then the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I.\n\n(2) In Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts, and multi-agency contracts—\n\n(i) Where FASCSA orders are applied at the contract level, with its Alternate I in all solicitations and resultant contracts. See 4.2304(b)(1)(i).\n\n(ii) Where FASCSA orders are applied at the order level, with its Alternate II in all RFQs, or in all notices of intent to place an order. See 4.2304(b)(1)(ii)."
