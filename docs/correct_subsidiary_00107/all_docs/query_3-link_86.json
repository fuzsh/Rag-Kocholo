        "text": "The year 2000 was a scary one for most people around the world.\n\nPeople were afraid of many things, including the world ending and the Dot-com Bubble bursting.\n\nDespite the turbulent times, a large number of companies still went public and hit the stock exchange for the first time.\n\nKeep reading to find out which major events happened, which companies went public, and how they're performing today.\n\nMajor world events that happened in 2000 that affected the stock markets\n\n2000 was a year to remember. From the Olympics to the Y2K bug, people had a lot to talk about. A number of major world events occurred alongside IPOs by various companies. Here are some of the major ones that had an impact on financial markets.\n\nDot-com Bubble Burst: The dot-com bubble was the excessive speculation in internet-based companies. It reached its peak in early 2000 and subsequently burst. Loads of tech companies went public during this period, most of them weren't high-performing companies and were eventually acquired or shut down.\n\nNasdaq Composite Index High: On March 10, the Nasdaq Index hit its peak at 5,048.62. The record high reflected the unreasonable optimism and surrounding internet businesses since most of the companies driving this were tech stocks (almost similar to the 2020 rally).\n\nY2K Bug: The turn of the millennium brought concerns about computer systems' ability to handle the date change from 1999 to 2000. This was known globally as the Y2K bug, and some people were genuinely worried. Many companies invested heavily in fixing potential issues, leading to increased spending on technology and related services.\n\nOther Global Events: The presidential election in the United States, with George W. Bush winning against Al Gore was another major world event. On top of this, the Sydney Summer Olympics were held in Australia. The outbreak of the Second Intifada (Palestinian uprising) in the Middle East also caused chaos in the stock market.\n\n5 household brand names that had their IPO in 2000\n\n1. Energizer Holdings Inc.\n\nCountry: United States of America\n\nStock Exchange: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)\n\nIndustry: Electrical Equipment & Parts\n\nIt's safe to say we all rely on Energizer (at least I know I do). The company offers a portfolio of products including Energizer® batteries, flashlights, portable charging solutions, and lighting products. They also provide specialty batteries for hearing aids, and health and fitness devices, as well as for keyless remote entry systems. Their batteries are sold in 160+ countries and territories worldwide making them an extremely valuable company.\n\n2. Garmin\n\nCountry: United States of America\n\nStock Exchange: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)\n\nIndustry: Scientific & Technical Instruments\n\nIPO Price: $14\n\nIPO Date: December 8, 2000\n\nGarmin is a leading provider of navigation and communication technology for retail consumers. As a cyclist, I rely on their watches and GPS devices to help guide my rides. Their products are designed to help people explore, navigate and stay connected in their daily lives. Garmin also provides mapping, traffic, weather, and other related services. If you've ever used Strava you'll see the power of their products. Garmin is truly committed to providing innovative GPS and technology solutions to help people stay connected and explore the world.\n\n3. Rakuten\n\nCountry: Japan\n\nStock Exchange: Tokyo Stock Exchange (TYO)\n\nIndustry: Internet Retail\n\nIPO Price: ¥1,400\n\nIPO Date: April 21, 2000\n\nMost people know Rakuten as an affiliate network as a result of their “Rakuten Advertising” arm. However, it offers a lot more than this, including e-commerce, fintech, and digital services. The Japanese company services over 1.2 billion users around the world. Their most notable offering is their cash-back deal available at 3,500+ stores.\n\n4. Krispy Kreme\n\nCountry: United States of America\n\nStock Exchange: NASDAQ\n\nIndustry: Grocery Stores\n\nIPO Price: $17\n\nIPO Date: April 5, 2000\n\nI think the world is grateful for this IPO. Krispy Kreme is one of the most popular international doughnut and coffee chains. It was founded in 1937, and the company has grown to become a global leader in the doughnut industry, offering a wide variety of doughnuts, coffees, and other treats. Krispy Kreme is known for its signature Original Glazed doughnut. They have locations in more than 30 countries. One thing that stands out with Krispy Kreme is their commitment to collaborations (including their famous Halloween and Suicide Squad).\n\n5. Hallmark Media\n\nIf you've ever sent or received a nice greeting card then it was probably produced by Hallmark Media. They're a huge company that operates several divisions focusing on various aspects of entertainment and media production. Even though they're widely recognized for their greeting cards, they expanded into other areas, including television channels, movies, and publishing.\n\nList of the 431 companies that had their IPO in 2000"
