        "text": "Summary: In this article, you will find a list of Corporate Learning Management Systems that is as comprehensive and up-to-date as I can make it. One crucial step for eLearning professionals when developing their eLearning strategy is to choose the proper LMS. But, how many LMS's are there? How can you find them? How do you pick one?\n\nA List of 571 Corporate Learning Management Systems\n\nE-learning has become a way of life for many businesses. In 2012, corporate training was a $200 billion industry. eLearning represented $56 billion of that and is expected to double by 2015. According to a 2013 Kineo study, over 41.7% percent of global Fortune 500 companies now use some form of educational technology for training and about 46% of college students are taking at least one course online. The LMS market alone is expected to grow to over $7 billion by 2018, according to MarketsandMarkets.\n\nDiscover the best LMSs for Large Enterprises\n\nFind, choose and compare the eLearning Industry's Top LMSs for Large Enterprises!\n\nA Learning Management System (LMS) is a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of e-learning education courses or training programs.\n\nCommon Learning Management Systems Features\n\nOnline (eLearning) course launching and tracking.\n\nClassroom instruction management is included in most full-fledged corporate LMSs but not in all and is not normally included in education LMSs.\n\nBlended learning is the ability to manage course which mix online and classroom instruction and is included in the more ambitious systems.\n\nTalent management includes tools for recruitment, performance management, compensation and benefits, succession, retention and career planning. They are included in several of the most ambitious corporate systems but are not normally included in Education LMSs.\n\nCommunication and collaboration (Web 2.0). These tools have long been included as part of education LMSs and more and more corporate LMSs are including them now. Also called social learning and networking.\n\neLearning development tools (authoring and publishing) are not always included in corporate LMSs but are included in LCMSs and education LMSs.\n\nContent management of internal course materials is normally part of LCMSs and education LMSs and may be included as part of a suite.\n\nAssessment and testing. The ability to produce tests and assessment both as part of courses and separately is normally included as part of LCMSs and education LMSs but only occasionally for corporate LMSs.\n\nVirtual classrooms. They are not normally included as part of an LMS but may be included as part of a suite. Many LMSs provide integration with third party virtual classrooms.\n\nE-Commerce. The ability to charge users for the courses internally and externally is a feature which is being included in more and more systems. Sometimes called extended enterprise when companies use their system to extend their offerings to customers, suppliers, partners, etc.\n\nReporting. All good systems provide good reporting functions and the ability to customize reports.\n\nMobile learning. Many vendors are beginning to add mobile learning functionality to their LMSs so learning can be accessed on smartphones and other small mobile devices. Many offer “responsive” output that automatically adjusts to the size of the viewing screen. Many mobile features are available as “apps” for which there are many suppliers. I have not attempted to list them here.\n\nSocial learning. Along with mobile learning, social learning (offering tools like Facebook) is an important new offering which LMS providers are rushing to include.\n\nSaaS (Software as a Service). Some Learning Management Systems are offered as software that is installed internally in the organization (“behind the firewall”). Some are offered as hosted or SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions. The terms Cloud Computing and “on-demand” are also used for this. Many are offered both ways.\n\nE-learning standards: There are a variety of standards that exist to help support interoperability of courses and applications. Most LMSs subscribe to at least one of these standards. There are AICC, SCORM, the new Tin Can/Experience API, IMS (including LTI – Learning Tools Interoperability), and others.\n\nTalent Management Systems\n\nCorporate Learning Management Systems are often part of Human Resource (HR) solutions. Several of the major LMSs are moving into the area of talent management. Talent management includes recruitment, performance management, compensation and benefits, succession, retention, career planning, learning and development. As a rule, they are oriented to planning and do not provide the day-to-day processing capabilities such as payroll. The terms human capital management and workforce productivity are also used.\n\nCorporate Learning Management Systems (LMSs)\n\nLearning Management Systems (LMSs) can be divided into two categories - corporate and education. They are not mutually exclusive. It is not possible to have a comprehensive and completely up-to-date list. Companies go in and out of business and are purchased by other companies. Re-branding is a regular occurrence. Many corporations and universities have built their own proprietary systems and have made them available only in a limited way if at all. On my list, I have included vendors that offer products that are commercially and readily available. The focus is on those available in English and for which information is available on the World Wide Web. As a result, there are numerous tools in other languages not listed here. The list evolves monthly as I learn of new products and changes.\n\nThe following LMSs are designed primarily for use in corporate environments although some products may also be used in educational institutions.\n\n24x7 Learning Learntrak LMS (24x7 Learning Pvt.
