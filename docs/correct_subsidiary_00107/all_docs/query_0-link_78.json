        "text": "The Software Report is pleased to announce The Top 100 Software Companies of 2020. These companies provide some of the most important and impactful software solutions for businesses across the globe. They span a wide array of functionality from data analytics and business intelligence to workflow tools, sales enablement, and security, among other solutions.\n\nThis year’s awardees were selected based on nominations from industry professionals as well as company customers. Each nominated company was further evaluated across multiple categories including product strength, management team caliber, organizational composition and company growth.\n\nCongratulations to each of the companies named to The Top 100 Software Companies of 2020 awards list.\n\n1. Salesforce\n\nCategory: Customer Relationship Management\n\nLocation: San Francisco, CA\n\nSince the turn of the century, Salesforce has become one of the most trusted customer relationship management (CRM) platforms across the globe. In 1999, co-founder/CEO Marc Benioff, along with Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez, created the company in an effort to eliminate the burden of physical software and inadvertently innovated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) in the process. Salesforce was the first company to focus on SaaS from its inception and continues to pioneer the industry.\n\nSalesforce is driven by its Customer 360 platform, designed to unite customer data across multiple applications and between departments and provide a clear, robust image of every customer. Features such as the Lightning App Builder and Trailhead Training Platform offer businesses more control over learning and operating their entire cloud-based infrastructure, while other apps provide automation for sales and marketing processes. Salesforce is truly an effective all-in-one CRM tool for businesses large and small.\n\nAs the number one CRM platform worldwide, Salesforce enhances operations for over 150,000, including Farmers Insurance, ADP, and Amazon Web Services.
