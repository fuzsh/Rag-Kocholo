        "text": "Renishaw in the robotics industry\n\nWe have created the RCS product series to make installation consistent, easy, fast and traceable. This series is based on established and reliable Renishaw technology.\n\nThe series is designed for the industrial automation market. It offers two options: portable \"toolkit\" products and permanently installed \"in-process\" products. These products make robot set-up, health checks, and recovery of robotic applications easier.\n\nWorking with our robotics software, RCS Software Suite, RCS product series supports a large variety of robot manufacturers.\n\nWhat is industrial automation?\n\nIndustrial automation is increasingly playing a significant role across multiple sectors. Robotics, control systems and flexible lines are used to automate manufacturing processes. These supplement human intervention, increase operational efficiencies, and improve productivity. Integrating various technologies such as sensors, controllers, robotics, and software enables the monitoring and control of industrial processes.\n\nThe goal of industrial automation is to minimise errors, increase production speed, reduce costs, and enhance safety. This is achieved by enabling machines and systems to operate autonomously with minimal human input. Examples of industrial automation applications include assembly lines, material handling, manufacturing processes and quality control.\n\nConduct set-up or diagnostic tests with a guided software process\n\nRCS hardware products are supported by RCS Software Suite. This suite contains tests specific to RCS L-90, RCS T-90 and RCS P-series.\n\nA free-to-use version of industrial automation software is available. It supports the set-up of robot systems and defining tests. A range of paid subscription options are available for test implementation using RCS products.\n\nDownload RCS Software Suite"
