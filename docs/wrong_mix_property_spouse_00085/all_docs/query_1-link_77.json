        "text": "Frankfort - FRANKFORT - William \"Bill\" Kenneth Dunham, 79, died unexpectedly Thursday, Nov. 8, 2012. The son of Kenneth Dunham and Eleanor (Beede) Dunham, he was born in Bangor and raised in Brewer. He was a longtime resident of Winterport and later Frankfort.\n\nWhile still in high school he worked for a local baking company delivering goods. Bill graduated from Brewer High School in 1951. He joined the U.S. Army, where he attained the rank of corporal while stationed in Alaska. After serving with the Army he moved the family back to Maine and worked at Winterport Hardware - owned by his father, delivering heating oil and snowplowing, as well as working in the store. After the hardware store closed he took over the oil and snowplowing business for many years. He had many other jobs throughout his life, including school bus driver, auto mechanic and lighting salesman. He was involved with the Boy Scouts of America for many years, as well as being a member of the Lions Club and a lifetime member of American Legion. He loved spending time at his summer camp enjoying the quiet time sitting at the campfire drinking his coffee.\n\nHe leaves his wife of 16 years, Evelyn (Nelson) Dunham; and his many stepchildren, stepgrandchildren and great-stepgrandchildren. He also leaves his children from his marriage to Betty-Jean Junkins: daughter, Rhonda (Dunham) Morgan, and sons, Wayne and Stephen Dunham; six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He also leaves a sister, Jeanne (Dunham) Hatt. Bill was predeceased by his brother, Robert Dunham.\n\nA gathering/remembrance for family and friends will be held 3-6 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 17, at Frankfort Congregational Church, Route 1A, Frankfort."
