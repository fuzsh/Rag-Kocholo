        "text": "Dorothea Mable Herrmann Dunham passed away peacefully surrounded by family and friends. Dorothea (Dorie) was born May 13, 1921 in Rochester New York to Otto W. Herrmann and Ruth Marie Hudon Herrmann. She was married to Gordon Gerling Dunham on June 9, 1945 who preceded her in death in 1993. They were blessed with five children who survive her. Carol-Aynn (Ron) Knott, Lynda Dunham, Stephen (Lily) Dunham, John (Evon) Dunham, and Michelle (Charles) Jaques. Dorie is also survived by thirty one grandchildren, nineteen great grandchildren, and ten great, great, grandchildren. “Dorie” enjoyed life to the fullest. As a youngster she would swing from the trees in the neighboring gully. She also loved to dance, go hunting, fishing, and boating with her father and later with her hubby “Gordy”. Summer camping trips with all her children were regular adventures. As grandchildren started to enter her life she loved to hear their stories and also plan adventures together at any time of the day or night. Dorie was also an avid reader and shared much of her knowledge while having a passion to listen to others who experienced like-mindedness. Her greatest passion was, however, the love of photography. She would take a picture of anyone in any position “from” any position. It did not matter whether she was in a wheelchair, walker, chair or sofa or if you were eating, standing, sitting, walking or talking, you had better freeze where you are at and smile for the camera. And she always, without exception rewarded you with a smile and a “thank you” knowing that you had earned it. Dorie worked as a secretary at Eastman Kodak and was often asked to model because of her “perfect complexion”. She went onto support Television WXXI PBS for many years and was responsible for supporting many other worthy causes. Dorie was baptized as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1954. She loved to serve in whatever capacity or “calling” she could and “consequently” she had a distinct love for the savior, scriptures and especially the book of Mormon. With a deep interest in family history she became involved in family research (genealogy) and discovered thousands of relatives previously unknown during her lifetime. Dorie loved to share her findings with anyone she could and inspired others to become interested about “their roots” as well. Wit and wisdom and a God -gifted alertness, unparalleled, followed her up to the day of her passing. She will be missed by many whose hearts she touched over the last century. A special thanks for all the caregivers and friends that helped care for Dorie, allowing her to stay in her home until the last week of her life. She passed while in in Park Ridge (Unity) Hospital. Visitation will be held Friday, July 8th 4-7 pm at Vay-Schleich and Meeson 1075 Long Pond Road, Rochester New York- Church Service –The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints 1250 English Road Sat. July 9th 11am Interment to follow Riverside Cemetery. In lieu of Flower and gift donations may be made at HeritageChristianServices.org then click on Ways To Make Donations.
