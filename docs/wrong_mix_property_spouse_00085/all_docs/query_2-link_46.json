        "text": "The story of Milton Hershey, who created the chocolate candy empire and became a leading philanthropist. Follows Milton's rise from poverty to the development of his chocolate formula and creation of his \"candy city\", complete with hotels, hospital, and amusement park.\n\nRenowned for his chocolate chip cookies, Wally \"Famous\" Amos has actually led many lives, and this revealing hour examines his life, which is far more complex than the public knows. We'll look at his years as the first black talent agent at the William Morris Agency, representing Simon and Garfunkel and the Supremes; the rise and fall of his cookie business; his difficult relationships with his wives and children; comeback in business; and charity work.\n\nWith flavor names like Phish Food and Karamel Sutra, Ben & Jerry's Homemade ice cream has built a reputation over the years as a fun-loving company with a unique and creative approach to business. When Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield met in gym class in 1963, they realized that they shared two important qualities: a hatred for running and a love for food. They also agreed that it was no fun being in business just to earn a living--they wanted to enjoy themselves too. So in 1977 they turned to ice cream making by enrolling in a $5 correspondence course to learn the craft. Their recipe was a sophisticated concoction: a blend of fresh Vermont milk, cream and generous portions of whatever ingredients took their fancy.\n\nStory of the lovable guy behind the Wendy's fast-food empire. He began with Kentucky Fried Chicken and invented the famous bucket of chicken with Colonel Sander's face on it. After leaving KFC, he started doing Wendy's commercials in 1989--the first of 500.\n\nPortrait of Ernest and Julio Gallo, the wine masters who ended up running the largest and most successful winery in the world. Discover how the Gallos did business with Chicago gangsters in the 1930s; learn about Joseph, the \"unknown\" Gallo brother; and, find out how they fought wine snobs to make a product for common people.\n\nNow an accomplished food star and restaurateur, Flay picked up cooking at the age of 17 at theatre row favorite, Joe Allen's, where he came under the watchful of Joe himself. Mr. Allen was so impressed with the teen's knack for cookery that he paid his tuition to the French Culinary Institute. First being introduced to Southwestern ingredients and influences by restaurant owner Jonathan Waxman, Flay made these a part of the distinctive style that led him rapidly up the \"Foodie\" ladder of success. Now a TV star of his own shows, a food correspondent for CBS's the Early Show and author of a number of stellar cook books including the hugely popular \"Boy Meets Grill,\" Flay's star continues to rise."
