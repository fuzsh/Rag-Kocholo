        "text": "Gary \"Big Dog\" Dunham, 64, passed away peacefully on Thursday, December 9, 2021. Gary was born on October 19, 1957 in Chicago to Gerald and Gloria (Kaspar) Dunham.\n\nGary loved to golf and was an original member of Golf Club of Illinois in Algonquin, IL. He loved to take road trips on his motorcycle and was teaching himself to play guitar. Gary was an active member of the Patriot Guard Riders. He was on the construction team when the current White Sox stadium was built and shortly after it opened, they found him in the stands to replace a broken filter on one of the ice machines. Gary was an avid White Sox, Blackhawks and Boise State fan and loved discussing sports with his daughter Jenny. Gary had many friends he considered family.\n\nGary is survived by his loving wife of 25 years, Cindy (Mrowiec), his daughter Jenny Stauner, his sister Kim Dunham (Brian Schooley), his brother Keith (the late Donna) Dunham, his nieces Kelsey (Billy) Donahue, Tessa Dunham (Leo Johson) and his best friend Ted (Caecilia) Payton.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, his maternal and paternal grandparents, brother Steve (Janie) Dunham and his sister Cindy Dunham."
