Liberty Hall (Irish: Halla na Saoirse), in Dublin, Ireland, is the headquarters of the Services, Industrial, Professional, and Technical Union (SIPTU). It was formerly the tallest storeyed building in the state, at 59.4 metres, (195 feet) high until it was superseded by the County Hall outside Cork city, which was itself superseded by The Elysian in Cork.
