WIC is a nutrition education and food assistance program for pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women and children up to five years of age. WIC can help families find other needed resources like doctors, dentists and medical insurance. I-Smile services will also be offered to children and pregnant people at these clinics which includes a dental screening, fluoride varnish, education and referral to a dentist.\n\nJCPH is offering WIC clinics throughout Johnson County to improve the accessibility to services for county residents especially where transportation is a barrier. “We analyzed the addresses of families currently receiving WIC and families who are eligible for Medicaid to identify clusters of where they live and sites for clinics to close these clusters. We anticipate this will help families already on WIC as well as attract families who have never been on WIC due to transportation issues,” said Chuck Dufano, WIC Coordinator for Johnson County.\n\nClinics will be open monthly from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the following sites in North Liberty and Coralville:\n\nSecond Tuesday of the month beginning Oct. 11\n\nNorth Liberty Community Center\n\n520 W.

WIC is a nutrition education and food assistance program for pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women and children up to five years of age. WIC can help families find other needed resources like doctors, dentists and medical insurance. I-Smile services will also be offered to children and pregnant people at these clinics which includes a dental screening, fluoride varnish, education and referral to a dentist.\n\nJCPH is offering WIC clinics throughout Johnson County to improve the accessibility to services for county residents especially where transportation is a barrier. “We analyzed the addresses of families currently receiving WIC and families who are eligible for Medicaid to identify clusters of where they live and sites for clinics to close these clusters. We anticipate this will help families already on WIC as well as attract families who have never been on WIC due to transportation issues,” said Chuck Dufano, WIC Coordinator for Johnson County.\n\nClinics will be open monthly from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the following sites in North Liberty and Coralville:\n\nSecond Tuesday of the month beginning Oct. 11\n\nNorth Liberty Community Center\n\n520 W.
