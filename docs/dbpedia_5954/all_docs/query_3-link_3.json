Up and Down arrows will open main level menus and toggle through sub tier links. Enter and space open menus and escape closes them as well. Tab will move on to the next part of the site rather than go through menu items.\n\nAs Lake Countyâ€™s principal guardian of open space and natural areas since 1958, we set the standard in nature and historic preservation, and in outdoor recreation and education. We offer a broad range of employment opportunities, including career and temporary positions.\n\nBrowse available opportunities below.
