Making their Australian debut, label heads Kahani & Kunal Merchant are bringing their distinct ‘Indo House’ sounds to Liberty Hall this June. Renowned for their sense of community & connection, 2023 saw a string of sold out Indo Warehouse shows across North America, London, India, and a debut show at the globally recognised Amsterdam Dance Event. Join us for the Australian debut of Indo Warehouse this June."
