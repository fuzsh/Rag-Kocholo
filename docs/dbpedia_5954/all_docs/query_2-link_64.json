        "text": "From 1892 through 1954, the CRRNJ Terminal stood with the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island to unfold one of this nationâs most dramatic stories: the immigration of northern, southern and eastern Europeans, among others, into the United States. After being greeted by the Statue of Liberty and processed at Ellis Island, these immigrants purchased tickets and boarded trains at the Terminal that took them to their new homes throughout the United States. To learn more about the CRRNJ's history, visit the Historic CRRNJ Train Terminal site.\n\nThe CRRNJ Terminal is open daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Memorial Day through Labor Day, and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. after Labor Day until Memorial Day\n\nThe âEmpty Skyâ 9/11 Memorial is the official State of New Jersey Memorial that honors the memory of the 750 people that lived in or had ties to New Jersey that lost their lives at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, PA on September 11, 2001\n\nThe names are placed randomly on the twin brushed stainless steel walls. Individuals' names (4 inches tall) are within reach and engraved deep enough for hand rubbing. The memorial, designed by Jessica Jamroz and Frederic Schwartz, was dedicated on September 11, 2011, the 10-year anniversary.\n\nThe brushed stainless steel twin walls are 210 feet long, the width of each side of the World Trade Center Towers. They rise 30 feet, standing parallel to each other with a 12-foot wide paved path of bluestone between them. Like the World Trade Center, the stainless steel reflects the constantly changing light of day. The memorial invites visitors to literally and metaphorically look toward the empty sky in memory and look forward as a community.\n\nNJ 9/11 Memorial Foundation Site\n\nTrailered Boats\n\nPermit Required\n\nFee Applies\n\nLiberty State Park’s boat launch provides access to the Hudson River for trailered boats and vessels, and is located within Parking Lot 2.
