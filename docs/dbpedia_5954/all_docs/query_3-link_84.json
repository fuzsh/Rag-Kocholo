We will discuss foundations of the First Amendment’s protections for speech and assembly; challenges in applying those protections in a democratic and pluralistic society; and how speech principles play out in a rapidly changing digital world. We will also address dynamics of academic freedom and the role of speech and debate in an academic setting, with particular attention to how individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives interact on campus. A Q&A session will follow the main discussion.\n\nMore About"
