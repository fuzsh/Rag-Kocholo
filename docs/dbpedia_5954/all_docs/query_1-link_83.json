Based on additional damage reports, aerial drone surveys, and further radar analysis, this statement provides further analysis that include several more tornadoes, along with a change to reflect two tornadoes in Montgomery County instead of one single long track tornado. .Overview... On the afternoon and evening of Wednesday, June 5th, 2024, a warm front slowly lifted northeast across the eastern Panhandle of West Virginia into northern Virginia as well as central and northeastern Maryland. At the same time, low pressure tracked along the warm front causing severe thunderstorms and tornadoes to develop. At this time, the National Weather Service is confirming thirteen tornadoes in this report. .Montgomery County, Poolesville Tornado Update... Rating: EF-1 Estimated Peak Wind: 105 mph Path Length /statute/: 9.1 miles Path Width /maximum/: 150 yards Fatalities: 0 Injuries: 0 Start Date: June 05 2024 Start Time: 7:01 PM EDT Start Location: Poolesville / Montgomery County / MD Start Lat/Lon: 39.1206 / -77.4851 End Date: June 05 2024 End Time: 7:27 PM EDT End Location: Seneca Creek State Park / Montgomery County / MD End Lat/Lon: 39.1498 / -77.3247 National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington Weather Forecast Office staff conducted a ground survey of storm damage that occurred in central Montgomery County MD on the evening of Wednesday, June 5, 2024. A mini-supercell thunderstorm formed southeast of Leesburg, VA, near the Potomac River. Montgomery County Emergency Management reported multiple trees down just east of the Potomac River along Elmer School Road, River Road, and Edwards Ferry Road. An eyewitness reported a tornado at a vineyard near West Willard Road. Numerous trellises were snapped and a shipping container weighing approximately 9,000 pounds was partially lifted off the ground then bounced twice over the course of 100 yards. Significant divots were in the ground, as well as damage to telephone poles from the container being lifted. Damage surveyed was at Tudor Farm along Whites Ferry Road (MD-107). About 2 dozen pine trees with trunk diameter exceeding two feet were snapped or uprooted at this location, laying in various directions. Media reported collapse of doors to a barn on the property. From this location, additional damage was located in the vicinity of the 16000 block of Darnestown Road (MD-28). Here, about a dozen softwood trees were snapped and uprooted, falling in differing directions. These downed trees caused the closure of Darnestown Road for a period of time. The tornado continued on the ground for about 0.5 miles, where additional damage was observed along and near White Ground Road. Here, many pine trees were snapped, with one pine tree debarked of about half of its bark on its remaining trunk. The tornado track shifted northeast where several trees were uprooted around the Seneca Creek State Park before finally dissipating as it headed northeast. The alterations to the track were corroborated by further surveying and radar imagery from NWS Doppler Radar in Sterling, Virginia. The National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington Weather Forecast Office acknowledges the assistance of the Montgomery County Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security and the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services in helping conduct and provide information to this storm survey. .Montgomery County, Gaithersburg Tornado Update...

Staff at the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commissions (WSSC) Seneca Water Resource Recovery Facility witnessed the tornado moving west-to- east directly adjacent to the south of their facility where power lines leading to the facility were snapped causing the facility to switch to backup power. After its trek south of the facility, it produced large broken branches that fell onto Great Seneca Highway (MD-119), partially blocking the roadway. The storm continued east and entered the City of Gaithersburg. The first damage surveyed was along Desellum Avenue north of Gaithersburg High School. Here, pine trees were snapped, with large limbs downed. A pair softwood trees, approximately 30 yards apart, were snapped and fell directly towards each other, evidence of a tornado. The storm proceeded towards Old Town Gaithersburg, depositing a large limb on top of St. Martin of Tours Church at the intersection of South Summit Avenue and South Frederick Avenue (MD-355). The housing development directly east of the Gaithersburg City Hall was particularly hard-hit, with seven houses being condemned from trees and branches falling onto them. One large oak tree with a trunk of about three feet was uprooted, and fell into a house on Dogwood Drive, where five occupants were injured and transported to the hospital. Several other trees were uprooted including one in the 200 block of Rolling Road, along with numerous large branches downed. One resident interviewed said they heard the Tornado Warning on their phone about three minutes before damage occurred near them. Once notified, their family took action to go to the basement of their home to remain safe. Video recorded the tornado moving east, north of the Intercounty Connector (ICC/MD-200) near Redland. Additional tree damage was reported by Montgomery County Emergency Management and trained weather spotters between Redland and Olney. The Sandy Spring Volunteer Fire Department reported trees down near Sandy Spring. Additional trees were down just east of Ashton per Montgomery County Emergency Management. This was the last area of concentrated damage in Montgomery County. The National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington Weather Forecast Office acknowledges the assistance of the Montgomery County Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services, WSSC Water, and the City of Gaithersburg in helping conduct and provide information to this storm survey. .Eldersburg MD Tornado Update...

The National Weather Service conducted a damage survey and noted an initial area of tree damage near the intersection of Tanglewood Drive and Covington Court. A rotational damage signature was evident as tree damage was pointed in opposite directions. The tornadic storm continued its track toward the northeast with additional damage observed along Bartholow Road near Sarah Drive. This included multiple large trees which were uprooted, one of which fell onto a house. Further damage was noted up the road just north of the intersection of Bartholow Road and Cherry Tree Lane. Dozens of trees had large sections and branches snapped off and topped. Observed tree damage was spread out into multiple directions. Drone footage passed along by a trained spotter showed hundreds of hardwood and softwood trees that were snapped near the western shore of Liberty Reservoir, behind Cherry Tree Lane. Later, the tornado passed over Morgan Run before causing additional damage to the Lakeland Heights area. A home was seen with siding and shingle damage and a small section of roof removed near Sun Berry Court and Lake Forest Court. Multiple large broken tree branches were noted behind the home. Drone footage showed hundreds of hardwood and softwood trees snapped in an area of forest to the northwest of Lake Forest Court. A few trees were damaged along Legacy Drive. The damage signature to the northeast became more intermittent in nature as the tornado began to weaken. By 8:11 PM EDT, the final damage point was noted about 1 mile northeast of Gamber MD. Along Pin Oak Drive, a mid-sized tree was uprooted with multiple downed tree branches. Thereafter, the circulation dissipated while approaching MD State Route 140. No damage was noted along Route 140. A circulation evident on NWS Doppler weather radar corroborated this track as well. The National Weather Service would like to thank the Carroll County Emergency Management Division and trained spotters for their assistance with this damage survey. .Carroll County Airport, Maryland Tornado... Rating: EF-0 Estimated Peak Wind: 80 mph Path Length /statute/: 0.3 miles Path Width /maximum/: 100 yards Fatalities: 0 Injuries: 0 Start Date: June 05 2024 Start Time: 7:42 PM EDT Start Location: Carroll County Regional Airport / Carroll County / MD Start Lat/Lon: 39.61 / -77.00 End Date: June 05 2024 End Time: 7:43 PM EDT End Location: Carroll County Regional Airport / Carroll County / MD End Lat/Lon: 39.62 / -77.00 Staff from the National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington Weather Forecast Office worked with Carroll County Emergency Management and trained weather spotters to confirm a tornado near the Carroll County Regional Airport occurred on Wednesday evening, June 5, 2024. The tornado touched down around Carroll County Regional Airport before moving east-northeast into the Bear Branch neighborhood. This was verified by video taken from a resident within the area along with NWS Doppler Radar in Sterling, Virginia that showed rotation within a thunderstorm. Overall damage was sparse and brief within the tornado aside from a few trees down and minor structural damage to residences in Bear Branch. It appears that the tornado lifted before reaching Miller Road, as no additional damage was noted. The National Weather Service would like to thank the Carroll County Emergency Management as well citizens of Carroll County and trained weather spotters in the area for their help and support in conducting this survey, and providing storm damage reports. .Kearneysville WV Tornado...

The National Weather Service would like to thank the citizens of Baltimore Citys Canton neighborhood for their help and support in conducting this survey, and providing storm damage reports. .Southern Baltimore County Maryland Tornado Update... Rating: EF-1 Estimated Peak Wind:105 mph Path Length /statute/: 3.3 miles Path Width /maximum/: 175 yards Fatalities: 0 Injuries: 0 Start Date: June 05 2024 Start Time: 8:45 PM EDT Start Location: Arbutus / Baltimore County / MD Start Lat/Lon: 39.2348 / -76.7063 End Date: June 05 2024 End Time: 8:57 PM EDT End Location: West Baltimore / Baltimore City / MD End Lat/Lon: 39.2576 / -76.6516 The National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington Forecast Office staff conducted a survey of storm damage that occurred in southern Baltimore County on Wednesday, June 05, 2024. NWS Doppler Weather Radar in Sterling, Virginia showed a rotating thunderstorm that developed a tornado based on this survey. Weather spotters and residents reported a tornado touchdown in the vicinity of the I-95 and I-195 interchange around 8:45 PM EDT. This was confirmed with ground reports of several large tree trunks twisted and snapped in the vicinity of Riverchase Apartments along Selford Road and Deer Run Court. The tornado continued east northeast along a narrow path toward Friendship Road and Francis Ave. Multiple trees and wires were down along this route in a confluent pattern. The most notable was a large oak tree snapped midway up the trunk. The tree ended up laying in the north-northeast direction onto two cars and a house nearby. An additional large oak tree and its root ball were laying 500 feet nearby closing off Friendship Road. Beyond this point, the tornado continued east northeast between Francis Avenue and Ingate Terrace. Additional large trees were sheared off along with large root balls toppled. Numerous power and phone lines were down as well with BGE and Verizon crews assessing and repairing the damage. Similar damage was observed as the tornado moved east southeast toward Elm and Oakland Road. Several large trees were snapped midway along Elm Road, Huntsmoor Road, Oakland Road, and Ashbourne Road. Wires were down as well with one power pole twisted at its base at the intersection of Oakland Road and Elm Road. Beyond this point the path widened a bit with two medium spruce trees down along Oregon Avenue and several large branches along Carville Avenue. The tornado proceeded to lift and cycle as it crossed US-1 at I-95 and Potomac Avenue around 8:48 PM EDT. The storm continued 1.4 miles east northeast toward Halethorpe, MD where an additional touchdown was noted around 8:50 PM EDT. This was confirmed with several damage reports in the vicinity of the 3600 block of Commerce Drive and Washington Boulevard and Lansdowne Road. Multiple trees were snapped along a narrow path from the Home Depot over toward Alside Building Materials and Amazon HQ. The most notable damage was along Robert A Young Way between Alside Products and Amazon HQ. Four heavy overhead doors were blown out of the distribution warehouse along with pieces of the awning and roofing material removed from the Alside building. Several trees were also sheared at the canopy top within this same area. Additional large trees were taken down behind the LA-Fitness and Store-it storage facility along Washington Boulevard. More tree damage was evident from a distance along a small ridgeline that extended from the end of Hilltop Avenue to West Patapsco Avenue parallel to the B and O Railroad nearby. The tornado continued past this point, twisting and snapping the trunks of several medium to large hardwood trees along Nieman Avenue. The most notable damage was just before the tornado lifted at Overflo Warehouse LLC. Large pieces of the warehouse roofing material were peeled back along with pieces of flashing. Radar indicated the circulation clearing this point and lifting at the back of Nieman Avenue around 8:57 PM EDT. The National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington Forecast Office would like to thank the Baltimore County Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management for providing helpful information and assisting in the survey today. .Middle River MD Tornado... Rating: EF-1 Estimated Peak Wind: 105 mph Path Length /statute/: 1.0 miles Path Width /maximum/: 110 yards Fatalities: 0 Injuries: 0 Start Date: June 05 2024 Start Time: 9:27 PM EDT Start Location: Middle River / Baltimore County / MD Start Lat/Lon: 39.3359 / -76.4156 End Date: June 05 2024 End Time: 9:30 PM EDT End Location: Middle River / Baltimore County / MD End Lat/Lon: 39.3423 / -76.4000 National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington Forecast Office staff conducted a ground survey of storm damage that occurred in southeast Baltimore County on Wednesday, June 05, 2024. NWS Doppler Weather Radar in Sterling, Virginia showed a rotating thunderstorm that developed a tornado based on the survey. The circulation developed just to the south of Essex, MD shortly before 9:00 PM EDT before racing northeast and strengthening toward Martin State Airport around 9:27 PM EDT. This is where a notable debris signature started to show up on radar as the storm pushed north- northeast. This signature was confirmed with ground reports of fencing damage near a warehouse across from Martin State Airport, and multiple mobile homes damaged in the Williams Estates area as the strongest winds pushed through. The damage path was fairly narrow and short lived. Most of the damage included the removal of underpinning from several single and double wide mobile homes in the Williams Estates community. This included several mobile homes along Wagon Train Road and Roundup Road as well as Cowhide Circle. Carports, sheds, and a trampoline were tossed around the neighborhood as well. Several trees were also snapped and turned in several different directions along Roundup Road and Cowhide Circle. The most notable damage was between Dahlia Lane and Roundup Road. This where the height of the circulation looks to take place right around 9:28 PM EDT. Within this area there were two double wide mobile homes with significant damage. One of the mobile homes had underpinning removed from two sides of the building with the windows completely blown out and a shed tossed 50 yards in the opposite direction from its foundation. The resident who owns this home had roughly 30 seconds of video showing the tornado as it passed through. He recalled a loud boom which was most likely the shed being tossed from the foundation to the other side of the residence. Pieces of the shed and other debris were impinged into the side of the mobile home as well. The neighboring double wide mobile home was also missing a majority of its underpinning along with several shingles and shingle material off the roof of the structure. Strapping on both units appeared to be secured with no other distinct structural damage to be observed. Beyond this point, the tornado continued toward Roundup Road and Cowhide Circle where the path widened. Much of the same damage was noted, but to a lesser extent with underpinning and shingles removed from several mobile homes in the area. The tornado continued toward the back of Cowhide Circle where it eventually lifted. No additional damage was found beyond this point nor any injuries reported. The National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington Forecast Office would like to thank the Baltimore County Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management for providing helpful information and assisting in the survey. .Inwood WV Tornado... Rating: EF-0 Estimated Peak Wind: 75 mph Path Length /statute/: 0.9 miles Path Width /maximum/: 65 yards Fatalities: 0 Injuries: 0 Start Date: June 05 2024 Start Time: 4:04 PM EDT Start Location: 2 SSE Inwood / Berkeley County / WV Start Lat/Lon: 39.3375 / -78.0330 End Date: June 05 2024 End Time: 4:08 PM EDT End Location: 1 SE Inwood / Berkeley County / WV End Lat/Lon: 39.3506 / -78.0298 Staff from the National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington Weather Forecast Office conducted a ground survey of storm damage in Inwood WV that occurred on Wednesday afternoon, June 5, 2024. NWS Doppler Radar in Sterling, Virginia showed a rotating severe thunderstorm that developed a tornado. The tornado touched down south/southeast of Inwood in a field where tall grass could be seen disturbed in a rotating pattern. The tornado proceeded to move north across a cow pasture where a line of trees contained tree damage with large branches broken off. The tornado then tracked north across the field, where additional tree damage and shingle damage occurred along Emery Lane. The tornado continued north towards Lucy Drive where gutter damage and additional tree damage occurred. The tornado then crossed Lucy Drive where large tree branched were broken off. It is believed that the tornado lifted before reaching Middleway Pike as no further damage was observed past that point. The National Weather Service would like to thank the citizens of Inwood for their help and support in conducting this survey, and providing storm damage reports to the National Weather Service. .Leesburg VA Tornado... Rating: EF-1 Estimated Peak Wind: 95 mph Path Length /statute/: 1.0 miles Path Width /maximum/: 125 yards Fatalities: 0 Injuries: 0 Start Date: June 05 2024 Start Time: 6:42 PM EDT Start Location: 3 N Leesburg / Loudoun County / VA Start Lat/Lon: 39.1655 / -77.5648 End Date: June 05 2024 End Time: 6:43 PM EDT End Location: 4 NNE Leesburg / Loudoun County / VA End Lat/Lon: 39.1767 / -77.5516 Staff from the National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington Weather Forecast Office conducted a ground survey of storm damage that occurred north of Leesburg on Wednesday, June 5, 2024. NWS Doppler Weather Radar in Sterling, Virginia showed a rotating severe thunderstorm that developed a tornado. Radar also showed a tornado damage signature due to lofted debris from the tornado as it was occurring. The tornado touched down southwest of Garriland Drive, north of Leesburg, in a wooded area where broken trees could be seen. The tornado proceeded North/northeast across Garriland Drive, south of the intersection of Garriland Drive and Turning Leaf Lane, where several trees were uprooted in different directions and minor vinyl damage and window damage could be seen. The tornado then crossed over Garriland Drive again into a field where tree damage could be seen in the distance. Garriland Drive turns north at this point where the tornado crossed it at London Council Lane. Near London Council Lane, a small tree was uprooted and small branches had been snapped off. The tornado continued northeast towards Springrun Lane where a small shelter had the plastic roof ripped off. Across Springrun Lane, tree damage could be seen going into the woods, but was not found any further beyond this point. The National Weather Service would like to thank the citizens of Leesburg for their help and support in conducting this survey, and providing storm damage reports to the National Weather Service. .Columbia MD Tornado...
