        "text": "Grab the kid s, grab a friend, because once again its that time to ride the rails into history.\n\nOn Oct. 15 and 16, Union County celebrates Four Centuries In A Weekend, when historic sites and museums across the county open their doors to the public, free of charge.\n\nMany of the sites are within walking distance of the train stations across the County, with some sites offering shuttle service.\n\nKean University will once again provide trolley service from NJ Transit’s Union Station to Liberty Hall Museum. Meanwhile, Mountainside will provide a shuttle that will make a loop from the Westfield train station to the Deserted Village, with stops at the Miller-Cory Museum, the Reeve House, ucnj.org/reeve, and Mountainside’s Deacon Hetfield House, ucnj.org/deacon, before reaching the Deserted Village , ucnj.org/dv, where Union County Parks sponsors a host of activities and tours for young and old alike.\n\n“It’s a fun outing, with a train ride and a little history along the way,” said Freeholder Bette Jane Kowalski. “Many of the towns’ historic sites are within walking distance of the stations,” she said, noting that the County has put together a listing of all the sites along the County’s three train lines.\n\n“Some sites, like Fanwood, are right at the train station,” Kowalski said. “Others have further walks but if it is a beautiful fall day, it may be just the day to enjoy a leisurely stroll.”\n\nA full listing of directions from the County’s rail stations to the historic sites is available at: ucnj.org/trainthrutime or ucnj.org/TTT.\n\n“Four Centuries is such a great event,” Kowalski said. “A train ride is just the icing on the cake and adds to the fun of learning about our area’s incredibly rich history.”\n\nNJ Transit allows children to ride free on weekends. Monthly commuter passes are also valid. (Fare details are available at njtransit.com) . For those wishing to cycle from a train station, be sure to check with NJ Transit’s guidelines for bringing bikes aboard the trains.\n\nBelow is a brief guide to the sites. The (#) below refers to site numbers in Union County Across the Centuries, the County’s guide to sites of historic note in the area. Union County Parks (ucnj.org/parks) is also rolling out routes for cyclists to visit several historic sites along a 10–12 mile ride.\n\nLong before the Raritan Valley Line, there was the Central Railroad of New Jersey. From stations across Union County, from Plainfield to Elizabeth, it was possible to board a train to Chicago, or from Jersey City, to board a ferry to New York City. The CNJ is long gone, however some of the historic sites along the route remain, and you can ride the train to visit some of them."
