        "text": "History\n\nThe building was erected c1860 and one of the earliest known owners was Chief Constable Edward Quinn.\n\nJames Sloan bought the property from Quinn’s estate. Following Sloan’s death the title passed to his widow.\n\nIn 1906 the house became the residence of blacksmith Hugh Campbell, a member of the first family of free settlers who came to Ipswich in 1842. In 1947 the house passed out of the ownership of the Campbell family to the Queensland Country Women’s Association (QCWA). They converted it into a women’s hostel, and named it Mary Tregear Hostel, who was the wife a Police Magistrate and the first President of the Ipswich QCWA. She worked hard for the welfare of country women and children.\n\nBuilding Description\n\nA three storeyed rendered brick building, including cellar, erected on the property line with the street elevation symmetrically arranged about a central doorway, with three double-sashed windows on the upper floor and four on the ground floor. It is sparsely ornated with plain window surrounds and gable-hipped corrugated iron roof, and a plain chimney on the western wall.\n\nThe front door is covered with a recent canopy. Despite the unusual disposition of windows on the front façade, the building has a Georgian flavour because of its austere profile and refined detail.\n\nThe house was designed for a sizeable family with five bedrooms upstairs and two downstairs plus dining and sitting rooms, and an annexe at the back comprising kitchen, breakfast room and bathroom. The cellar contained the laundry, workshop and store. The building marks the street frontage of Limestone Street, which contains so many gaps that it risks losing its coherence.\n\nA similar role is played by the St. Paul’s Young Men’s Club opposite, with which it shares not only streetscape value but a stylistic sympathy, which both appear again in the Technical College group further up Limestone Street.\n\nConstruction periods:\n\nMain house: 1857-1860\n\nKitchen wing: 1958-1963\n\nHall:"
