        "text": "Pawlet is located in the south-west corner of the county, in lat. 43° 21; and long. 3° 54' east from Washington, bounded north by Wells, east by Danby, south by Rupert, in Bennington County, and west by Hebron and Granville, in New York, and contains an area of 23,040 acres, or a tract six miles square, granted by Benning Wentworth, Governor of New Hampshire, to Jonathan WILLARD and sixty-seven others, the charter bearing date August 26, 1761, and receiving its name from the principal river, which was formerly spelled Paulette, or Paulet, probably of French derivation. Of the sixty-eight grantees but few ever settled in the town, Willard having made some improvement here in 1761 of 1762, but did not remain. The usual reservations and restrictions incident to all the grants issued by Wentworth were made, and, like the others, became nullified by the Revolutionary war, but did not deprive the grantees of their rights nor take from them their homes, as was attempted by New York and our mother country during the land title controversy.\n\nThe surface is quite uneven and mountainous in most parts, yet between the mountain ranges there remain considerable tracts of level fertile land. Through the middle of the town, from north to south, extends a high range of mountains, cutting the territory into a natural division of east and west town, Haystack Mountain, in the north part, and extending into Wells, being the principal elevation of the range, and much resorted to by pleasure parties. Indian Hill, also, lying in the north-western part, is a considerable elevation.\n\nThe principal stream is Pawlet River, which enters the south-east corner of the township from Bennington County, and flows in a serpentine course, a north-westerly direction, to Wood Creek, in New York, and thence to Lake Champlain; it contains numerous tributaries, of which Flower Brook, entering from Danby, is the largest, and nearly all of sufficient size to afford good mill-sites, many of which are occupied.\n\nThe rocks in the western part are of the Georgia slate deposit, while the eastern portion is composed of talcoid schist, cut by a considerable bed of limestone, and containing some available deposits of roofing-slate and marble.\n\nThe soil of the town is mostly susceptible of cultivation, even to the tops of the mountains, all but two or three of which can be tilled to their summits, while many fields that cannot be plowed make excellent pastures. On the banks of the larger streams are alluvial deposits of rare fertility, and constantly enriched by periodical overflows. A large proportion of the soil is gravelly loam intermingled with slate, and well adapted to the growth of all grain raised in this latitude.\n\nThe timber is that common to the surrounding towns; the forests, however, becoming rapidly thinned, the inevitable result of the populous growth of a community. Lumbering is carried on to some extent, while the rich saccharine of the maple is largely utilized in the manufacture of sugar, which receives a ready market in localities less favored in this respect, finding, together with the other exports of the town, a convenient avenue for transportation in the Rutland and Washington Railroad, which enters the town from Rupert, extending thence to West Pawlet, and thence nearly on the line of the State, to Granville, N. Y.\n\nIn 1880 Pawlet had a population of 1,698, was divided into eleven school districts and contained eleven common schools, employing four male and, nineteen female teachers, at an aggregate salary of $1,742.02. There were 350 pupils attending common school, and the entire cost of the schools for the year ending Oct 31st, was $1,967.02, with Mr. Edward I. VAIL, superintendent.\n\nPawlet, a post village located on Flower Brook, near the center of the town, contains two churches, (Meth. and Cong.,) one grist-mill, saw-mill, cheese-box manufactory, cheese factory, a fork handle and baby carriage stock factory, six stores, one hotel, two blacksmith shops, wagon shop; harness shop etc.\n\nWest Pawlet, a post village and R. R. station, located in the west part of the town, on the Rutland and Washington R. R., contains four stores, two hotels, one grist-mill, two churches, (Baptist and Christian,) one wagon shop, one harness shop, two blacksmith shops, and several large stone-quarries.\n\nNorth Pawlet is a small hamlet located in the north-west part of the town, near Indian Hill, containing about a dozen dwellings.\n\nANDREW's saw-mill and cheese box manufactory, located at Pawlet, is operated by steam power and manufactures 125,000 or more cheese boxes, and saws about 300,000 feet of lumber per annum.\n\nJ.

EVANS, who acquired his partners interest, and who employs 15 to 20 men, and produces 20 to 30 squares of sea-green roofing slate per day.\n\nWELCH's slate quarry, situated in the western part of the town, was opened by Robert STEVENS in 1871, and is now operated by M.

Y., in 1881, and has the capacity for cutting 6,000 feet of lumber per day, and also manufactures chair stock, lath, etc.\n\nGOODSPEED's cider mill, located on road 14, was built by Peter GOODSPEED, and has the capacity for manufacturing 10 barrels of cider per day\n\nDILLINGHAM Slate Quarry, located at West Pawlet, was opened by Howell DILLINGHAM IN 1877-78, and employs 10 men in the manufacture of sea-green roofing slate, producing 200 squares per month.\n\nRISING & NELSON's slate quarries, located at West Pawlet, employ from 30 to 35 men and manufacture 200 squares of slate per week.\n\nBROWNELL Slate and Flagging Co.'s quarry is situated in the west part of the town, where they manufacture about 800 squares of slate, and 3,000 feet of flagging per month, employing 40 men.\n\nIndian Hill Slate Company was organized in 1876, consisting of Owen and Even EVENS. The quarry is situated at West Pawlet, and yields about 7,000 squares of slate per year.\n\nPawlet Woolen Company, E. COLVIN & Son, proprietors, was organized in 1846 by Asa S. JONES, the present company being formed in 1877. Their factory is located on road 32, two miles south of Pawlet, where they manufacture into cloth, about 25,000 lbs. of wool each year, employing eight hands.\n\nThe Leach Cheese Factory, located in the south part of the town, on road 30, was established by a stock company in 1846, and is now owned by Wm. LEACH, who uses the milk from 175 cows per year in the manufacture of cheese.\n\nPawlet Cheese Factory, located at Pawlet, was established in 1865 by R. C.

FAIRFIELD, the former receiving fifty, and the latter thirty acres of land, donated by the proprietors to them in 1768, as first and second settlers of the township. The earliest record extant of any town-meeting, bears date July 29th, 1768, at which meeting Reuben HARMON was moderator and Simeon BURTON, clerk. The first grist-mill was erected by Remember BAKER, about the year 1768, and was located on Wells Brook. This was soon after followed by one on Flower Brook, built by Wm. BRADFORD, and not long after this, one was erected on the present site of the Red Mill, built by Col. Samuel WILLARD, in 1783. The first hotel was kept by Capt. Jonathan WILLARD, on the site of the present homestead of Henry ALLEN. In 1814 a cotton-mill was erected on Flower Brook, by the Pawlet Manufacturing Co., which was successfully operated for thirty years, and the only cotton mill ever erected in the county. The building was 70 feet long by 39 feet wide and three stories high, and manufactured heavy cotton goods and warps. The machinery of the mill, power-looms and all, were made on the spot by Nathaniel ROBINSON, an ingenious mechanic.\n\nIndian Hill, located in the western part of the town, is accredited with being the scene of a battle between the French and English, the latter force under the command of Gen. PUTNAM. It is said PUTNAM was ordered from Fort Edward to the east, to dislodge a body of French and Indians who were lurking in the vicinity of Lake St. Catherine. The battle or skirmish is supposed to have occurred in June, 1785, upon the farm now owned by Marshall BROWN, the English losing two men, who were buried near a large rock upon the battle field. In 1880, Mr. BROWN cleared a spot of ground upon the hill, upon which he built a log house or lodge, commanding an excellent view.
