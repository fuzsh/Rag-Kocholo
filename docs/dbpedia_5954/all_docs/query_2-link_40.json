        "text": "Following the style of Egyptian Revival architecture, the Liberty Memorial was designed in the early 1920s by H. Van Buren Magonigle. From 1995-2006, Abend Singleton Associates restored the original Memorial to meet national standards for accessibility and security and designed the state-of-the art Museum space and supporting facilities underneath the Liberty Memorial. Ralph Appelbaum Associates designed the innovative and engaging exhibitions in the new gallery space.\n\nLearn about the many architectural and symbolic elements that make the National WWI Museum and Memorial one of Kansas City’s iconic landmarks.\n\nLiberty Memorial Tower\n\nThe Liberty Memorial Tower rises 217 feet above the main courtyard and 268 feet above the North Lawn. The cylindrical tower is 36 feet in diameter at its base, tapering to 28 feet at the top. Guests can purchase tickets to take an elevator followed by 45 stairs to the open-air observation deck for a breathtaking view of the Kansas City skyline. At night, a Flame of Inspiration, created by steam and lighting effects, is emitted from the top of the tower and can be seen from miles away. The monument received designation as a National Historic Landmark in 2006 and recognition from Congress as a national memorial in 2014.\n\nGuardian Spirits\n\nCarved by Robert Aitken and each standing 40-feet tall, four Guardian Spirits watch over the Memorial from the top of the Tower. As protectors of peace, each guardian holds a sword and is named for the virtue it represents: Honor, Courage, Patriotism and Sacrifice.\n\nCinerary Urns\n\nTwo empty cinerary urns, which traditionally contain the remains of a cremated body, flank the entrance of both Memory Hall and Exhibit Hall. Sculpted from limestone, each urn is decorated with a band of laurel with emblems recognizing each of the branches of service that helped to win the war: the Army and Navy, the Red Cross, Agriculture and Manufacturing and Transportation.\n\nExhibit Hall\n\nLocated on the west side of the Liberty Memorial Tower, Exhibit Hall served as the main museum gallery of the Liberty Memorial from 1926 to 1994. Today, Exhibit Hall serves as gallery space for the Museum and Memorial's limited-run exhibitions. It also contains a surviving section of the Panthéon de la Guerre mural, depicting the figure of Victory in front of a “temple of glory,” surrounded by thousands of French heroes. Colorful flags of the 22 Allied nations of World War I, arranged in the order in which each country entered the conflict, line the north and south walls. The exterior of both Exhibit and Memory Halls are decorated with mosaic tiles that depict a night sky strewn with gold stars. These gold stars represent the sacrifice of the Gold Star Mothers during the Great War.\n\nMemory Hall\n\nLocated on the east side of the Liberty Memorial Tower, Memory Hall contains a portion of the Panthéon de la Guerre, a monumental French painting depicting the Allied nations of World War I. Additionally, Memory Hall houses bronze tablets listing 441 Kansas Citians who died in World War I, computer kiosks that provide in-depth information about the Liberty Memorial and limited-run exhibitions.\n\nDedication Wall\n\nAt the northern edge of the grounds near Pershing Road, this stone wall displays the bronze busts of the five Allied leaders at the site dedication on Nov. 1, 1921: Gen. Baron Jacques of Belgium, Gen. Armando Diaz of Italy, Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France, Gen. John J. Pershing of the United States and Sir Admiral Earl David Beatty of Great Britain.\n\nThe Great Frieze\n\nLocated on the North Wall, the Great Frieze measures 148 feet by 18 feet and represents the progression of mankind from war to peace. Sculpted in 1935 by Great War veteran Edmond Amateis, each collected figure or grouping of figures is rich in symbolism. At each end of the Frieze is a sword with the Stars and Stripes representing the defense of our country. The story of the Frieze depicts the end of the war and the creation of an era of greater peace and amity."
