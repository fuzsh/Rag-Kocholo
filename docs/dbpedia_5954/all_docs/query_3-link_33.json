        "text": "Facts\n\nFollowing a United Nations resolution, President Harry Truman brought the United States into the Korean War after North Korea invaded South Korea. There was no congressional declaration of war to support his action. To further the war effort, the government relied on defense contractors that in turn relied on the steel industry. Truman created a Wage Stabilization Board that was designed to minimize labor disputes while curbing the inflation of prices and wages. During this time, however, the United Steel Workers of America planned to launch a nationwide strike across all of the major steel producers based on the industry's reluctance to grant wage increases without an increase in prices by the government.\n\nThe strike loomed ever closer as both sides showed no interest in compromise. Determined to keep supplies flowing to the troops in Korea, Truman seized the production facilities of the steel companies so that they could be operated by the federal government under their current management. There were several alternatives to this aggressive move. The government could have used the Taft-Hartley Act to declare a national emergency and forestall the union's strike, but the fault for the dispute seemed to lie more with the industry than the union. The government also could have used the recently passed Selective Service Act, but the process required by this law seemed too cumbersome for the demands of the time-sensitive situation. For the same reasons, Truman relied on the inherent powers of the President rather than seeking special Congressional authorization. These decisions would prove costly.\n\nAfter Truman announced the seizure to the national media, the steel industry sought a temporary restraining order from a federal district judge. He denied the motion on equitable grounds, but a different judge issued a preliminary injunction after a possible tactical error by an assistant Attorney General, which suggested that the government supported a spectacularly broad interpretation of executive power. (Not even Truman likely agreed with this view.)\n\nOnce the government was ordered to surrender its control of the steel plants, the union began the strike. On appeal, however, the government received a stay of the injunction pending review by the Supreme Court. Negotiations stalled after the court issued the stay, since it also barred increasing wages while review was pending and left the steel industry with no motivation to meet the union's demands.\n\nAttorneys\n\nJohn W. Davis (plaintiffs)\n\nArthur Goldberg (plaintiffs)\n\nPhilip B. Perlman (defendants)\n\nOpinions\n\nMajority\n\nHugo Lafayette Black (Author)\n\nFelix Frankfurter\n\nWilliam Orville Douglas\n\nRobert Houghwout Jackson\n\nHarold Hitz Burton\n\nThe formalist perspective of Black led him to argue for a clear rule that only authorization by Congress or the Constitution, whether explicit or implicit, could give the President the power to act.\n\nConcurrence\n\nWilliam Orville Douglas (Author)\n\nSimilar to Black, Douglas felt that even a national emergency did not give the President inherent powers beyond those that could be found in the Constitution or were granted by Congress.\n\nConcurrence\n\nFelix Frankfurter (Author)\n\nAlthough he took a more measured approach than Black and Douglas, Frankfurter analyzed the legislative history surrounding the Taft-Hartley Act and similar provisions in finding that Congress had shown its opposition to this type of executive action. If Congress had passively accepted it, even without formally authorizing it, that might have been enough for Frankfurter to accept its legitimacy. The lack of a formal declaration of war played a role in his analysis.\n\nConcurrence\n\nRobert Houghwout Jackson (Author)\n\nAlthough he did not write the majority opinion, Jackson crafted the most influential perspective on this case. He cleanly identified three categories of situations that could involve the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. The President would be owed the greatest deference when he had received authority from Congress, whether explicit or implicit. In the middle category lay situations in which Congress was silent, known as the twilight zone. This case, however, fell in the third and most problematic category for the government, which contains situations when the President directly conflicts with Congress.\n\nConcurrence\n\nHarold Hitz Burton (Author)\n\nLike Frankfurter, Burton examined the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act. He argued that only Congress could take this type of emergency action through its authority to make laws, and nothing in his statutory analysis persuaded him that it would permit the President to carry out these seizures without its consent.\n\nConcurrence\n\nTom C. Clark (Author)\n\nIn a vaguely written opinion, Clark suggested that the availability of alternatives was fatal to the legitimacy of the President's action. He identified the procedures under the Taft-Hartley Act and the Selective Service Act as well as the Defense Production Act that the executive branch had failed to use. His background as U.S. Attorney General may have persuaded him to take a relatively lenient view of the President's inherent power in national emergencies, but it did not extend so far that he believed the President able to disregard the procedures specifically outlined by Congress.\n\nDissent\n\nFrederick Moore Vinson (Author)\n\nStanley Forman Reed\n\nSherman Minton\n\nAlthough he recognized the control of Congress over the area of enacting legislation, Vinson felt that the national emergency gave the President the inherent authority to seize property to further the war effort. He pointed out that Congress could respond by signaling its approval or disapproval, at which stage the courts could intervene to resolve a dispute between the branches. Vinson saw the seizures as simply freezing the current situation in place rather than as an aggressive intervention.\n\nCase Commentary"
