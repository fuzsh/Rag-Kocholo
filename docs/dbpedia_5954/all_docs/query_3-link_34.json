        "text": "The LMU Style Guide provides basic standards for grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is intended as a general guide and extension of the Associated Press Stylebook, one of the most popular and standardized mass communication guides used throughout the world for the past century. Writers working in broadcasting, magazine publishing, marketing departments and public relations firms traditionally adopt and apply AP grammar and punctuation styles. Therefore, LMU has adopted AP style for its official communications and publications.\n\nThe first section covers matters of style and preferences specific to Loyola Marymount University. Like every style guide, our aim is consistency, clarity and correctness. While you may not agree with every \"rule\" set forth in this guide, you may find an answer to a persistent question. If you have a question that is not addressed in this guide, please feel free to contact Marketing and Communications.\n\nCommunications Style Guide\n\nUpdated July 2023\n\nPreferred Style, Quick Reference\n\nLMU References / Landmarks\n\n1 LMU Drive – not One LMU Drive\n\nAcademy for Catholic Thought and Imagination – ACTI on subsequent reference\n\nAd Majorem Dei Gloriam – The Jesuit motto.

The rules for dividing items in a series by commas should be followed.\n\ncommas, Oxford or serial comma – The university has formally adopted the use of the serial comma.

If referring to students as they, for example, do not refer to them elsewhere as you.\n\nFor consistency and ease of identification in photo captions, list subjects from left to right, using each person's full name and title, if any, and include the obligatory \"left to right\" or \"from left\" instruction in the caption.\n\nconvince, persuade – A person is convinced about something, but is persuaded to do something.\n\ncountry names – Country names are not generally abbreviated.\n\nU.S.—adjective (the U.S. Department of State)\n\nUnited States—noun (living in the United States)\n\ncourse, subject – Capitalize a specific course or subject name, such as ACCT 10350, Federal Taxation.

Tony Coelho, a 1964 Loyola graduate, was the primary sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush in 1990.\n\nDivision of / Office of – Avoid this construction in text whenever possible and clarity isn't sacrificed; this usage has become largely extraneous. In most cases, the proper noun is clear enough, e.g., Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion refers to all the activities and departments under that heading. This also works when a sentence refers to the physical place, e.g., Send your compliments to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. This slightly modifies the Associated Press guideline, which allows for office to be part of an official name. (For institutional reasons, the Office for International Students and Scholars, OISS, will continue to use that construction.)\n\nExamples: The Registrar announced today ... not: The Office of the Registrar announced today ...\n\nThe dean of BCLA set a policy ... not: The Office of the Dean of BCLA set a policy ...\n\nThe President cordially invites ... not: The Office of the President cordially invites ...\n\nThe Provost's office hours are open ... not: The Provost's Office Hours are open ...\n\nUniversity Advancement announced today ... not The Division of University Advancement.\n\nDr. – Dr. is used to refer to a doctor of medicine, dentistry, or veterinary medicine.

Avoid including it if possible. Web addresses do not need to be italicized but can be bolded or placed in color to attract attention or to clarify.\n\nWhen including a URL in running copy, aim to avoid placing it at a line break; rewrite the sentence if necessary. If a Web address is at the end of a sentence include a period or other ending punctuation as necessary.\n\nellipses – Ellipsis points are used to show omission within a quotation. However, it is not necessary to place the points at the beginning or end of a quotation, even if an omission is being made at that point.\n\nUse ellipsis points in sets of three. Leave a space between each point, as well as between the words on either side of them.\n\nI pledge allegiance to the flag . . . with liberty and justice for all.\n\nEllipses should be used sparingly.\n\nemail – The word email is not capitalized unless it is the first word of a sentence.

Newsrooms and organizations may need to make decisions, based on necessity and audience, on terms that differ from or are not covered by Associated Press' specific recommendations. Gender is not synonymous with sex. Gender refers to a person's social identity while sex refers to biological characteristics. Not all people fall under one of two categories for sex or gender, according to leading medical organizations, so avoid references to both, either or opposite sexes or genders as a way to encompass all people. When needed for clarity or in certain stories about scientific studies, alternatives include men and women, boys and girls, males and females. For guidance on pronouns, see they, them, their.\n\nExamples include:\n\nGendered noun Non-gendered noun man person, individual mankind people, human beings, humanity freshman first-year student man-made machine-made, synthetic, artificial the common man the average person chairman chair, chairperson, coordinator mailman mail carrier, postal worker policeman police officer congressman representative, legislator\n\ngender nonconforming (n.), gender-nonconforming (adj.) - Acceptable in broad references as a term for people who do not conform to the traditional view of two genders.

Roberta identifies as both male and female. Not synonymous with transgender. Use other terms like bigender (a term for people who identify as a combination of two genders) only if used by subjects to describe themselves, and only with explanation.\n\nGospel, gospel – Lowercase when referring to the genre of music. Capitalized when referring to the Gospel of the Bible.\n\nGrade point average (GPA), no hyphen\n\nGraduate-level (adjective)\n\nHe enrolled in four graduate-level courses as a senior.\n\ngroundbreaking (one word)\n\nH\n\nhands-on (hyphenated)\n\nWilliam H.

Though internment has been used historically, the broad use of the term is inaccurate -- about two-thirds of those incarcerated were U.S. citizens, and thus could not be considered interns -- and many Japanese Americans find it objectionable.\n\nJr. – There is no comma between the last name and Jr., Sr., III, etc.\n\nK\n\nkickoff, kick off – No hyphen when used to designate a starting point.\n\nSaturday's kickoff will be at noon.\n\nThe game will kick off at noon.\n\nL\n\nlaw school (generic term), but LMU Loyola Law School; the law school is the preferred subsequent reference, but LLS is acceptable when necessary.

In most cases, the proper noun is clear enough, e.g., Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion refers to all the activities and departments under that heading. This also works when a sentence refers to the physical place, e.g., Send your compliments to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. This slightly modifies the Associated Press guideline, which allows for office to be part of an official name.

Avoid broad generalizations and labels; race and ethnicity are one part of a person's identity.
