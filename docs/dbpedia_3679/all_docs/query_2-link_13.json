        "text": "Contrary to word on the street, In a Violent Nature is not a “deconstruction” of the slasher, nor is it a “meta” slasher.\n\nTo those tempted to take a tragic view this election season, I would counter that the Christian vision of reality is in fact a comic one.\n\nSegaloff is in a unique position to bring all of this material together for people who cherish the original film not simply as a cinematic rite of passage for thrillseekers, but also as a genuine work of art.\n\nVague, boring, sad, and unnerving, the new face of enchantment belongs to a cultural moment that sees people tying themselves in knots over what it means to be human.\n\nThough we just lost Frederick Buechner at the age of 96, I suspect that part of his legacy will consist in his bold reminder that preachers are poets.\n\nIs Vecna’s evil really exemplified best by the tumultuous sounds of black metal artists like Darkthrone and Mayhem?\n\nSilliman argues that each of these stories prefigures the current crisis within evangelicalism.\n\nAs Mare of Easttown poignantly depicts, when we’re in serious pain ourselves, it’s tempting to hide behind other people’s grief.\n\nChernobyl is an excellent show… with its emphasis on the net effect of human sin—the disproportionately catastrophic results of seemingly small errors.\n\nThough plenty of other podcasts display all the hallmarks of slick production, In the Dark is unique in eschewing the entire, folksy podcast ethos.\n\nBalancing compassion with firmness, Khang leads her readers through the current morass of social media, and offers a thoughtful and constructive way forward for those who want to do more than seethe on the sidelines.\n\nPart of Hannah Gadsby’s subversive power consists in the fact she still manages to be hilarious even as she refuses to let us rest in the abridgments necessary to her former punchlines."
