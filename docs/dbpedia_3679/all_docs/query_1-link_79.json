        "text": "At 1:31 PM, David Valensky jerks the dusty, bug-spattered rental car into the open left lane for the fifth time and bears down again to pass the vehicle they’ve been tailing since leaving Canyon de Chelly. It has grown from an indistinct gray hump to a maroon SUV bearing Utah plates with the numbers and letters partially obscured by a layer of thick, baked-on mud, and now they’re climbing up its backside.\n\nHe glances over at Svetlana. The rising heat and the endless smooth motion of the car lulled her to sleep thirty minutes earlier. She hasn’t gained much on the horrendous fatigue she accumulated before they started this vacation, and he knows she’ll now sleep for several hours, deeply and without dreams. A thin sheen of perspiration moistens her neckline as the air conditioning strains to keep up with the blazing mid-day sun. The pink tee-shirt she picked up in Moab is already damp and rumpled, a look she hates.\n\n1:32 PM\n\nStaring out over the brown, patchy landscape, he thinks back on the last ten days. The vacation has been a disaster from the get-go. They had bickered fruitlessly on the plane to Salt Lake, arguing about the inconsequential and ridiculous, his failure to pack the prescribed number of briefs, her forgetfulness in leaving behind the hiking boots. Each of them knew these things were their combat camouflage, desert gray ovals fused with irregular sandy white circles, mountain greens interwoven with earthy browns, the uniforms of illusion they wore with each other so they could sidestep the deeper truths. They shielded themselves brilliantly from each other’s armaments, the cache of weapons that, if ever unleashed, would surely strip away the cover-ups, unmasking disappointment and failure.\n\nFailure. Their problems reduced to this piercing singularity. His. Hers. But in his mind, mostly his. He perceives their issues, important or otherwise, as entirely the consequence of his own imperfections. It’s an inaccurate assessment, disproportionate and cruel, but deeply embedded. His psyche is an open wound, twisted and disfigured.\n\nHe knows about her affair. He is certain that she does not know that he knows, and he’s right about that. Fourteen years married, he has seen her roving eye in action, watched her at restaurants, at corporate affairs, at hospital fundraisers where she openly admires the handsome waiters, the polished, distinguished senior partners, the carefully manicured hospital executives. She will often lure them into a sassy, provocative conversation with a flirtatious smile or a well-executed turn to the side, her back arched just enough to playfully throw her ample breasts into a delicious profile. Secretly, perversely, it turns him on when he sees it—he loves her, doesn’t he?—and he feels the stirrings and pressure in his groin she has always caused. But it’s not his stirrings and pressure that concern him right now. It’s those of Elliott Cooper, the Medical Director of her surgical group practice, whose manhood he would like to sever carefully with her\n\nmost precious scalpel, the one she uses for the initial incision of her most challenging surgeries. He sees himself washing the blood away and bathing it with formaldehyde or some other fixative in a mason jar, shaking the jar and watching it undulate a moment in the thick, viscous liquid as the chemicals begin to firm the flesh, a grotesque reminder of the gruesome price of her infidelity.\n\nThey each wonder privately why they didn’t cancel the vacation. They know they are coming up to a dark brown place in the marriage, and survival is not assured. But they’ve been to these western parks and national monuments once before, in their happiest times, and secretly they’re each thinking it could be an opportunity for resuscitation. Breathe deeply, my sweet, cleanse your lungs, purify your body. Begin again.\n\nDespite perfect weather—flawless blue skies, dry, bracing mornings that quickly give way to scorching heat and an occasional stray thundercloud—they can’t seem to get untracked. Escalante, Arches National Park, Canyonlands all bore them. At Bryce, with its fairytale limestone castle formations and the easy descent to the canyon floor, they go through the motions: a few photographs, the obligatory rim drive. No hiking, not even the easy trails; they are content in the cool recirculating air of their cramped rental car, a prison cell of their own choosing. It’s almost like solitary confinement. They don’t even stop in Zion. Say something, she thinks. Say anything.\n\nEach morning, David vows to tell her how the day before they left he was unceremoniously fired. But he can’t do it. She knows he was on the verge of the promotion that would ensure his position in the firm, the progression to Managing Director, the money, the prestige, the security. She’ll never understand. He barely does. He shot his mouth off to a know-it-all client—politely, but with that unmistakable air of disdain he can’t mask when he’s on the receiving end of arrogance and belittlement. The client was his boss’s college roommate and best man. Exit David, career in ruins. Go directly to jail, do not pass GO, do not collect $200.\n\nWhen David thinks about the affair, the firing, the crumbling marriage, he envisions his life as a series of devastating accidents, the wreckage strewn everywhere. Here, at the site of a murderous plane crash, he sees his wife’s smile reflected fleetingly off the twisted metal of an engine that has rolled across a golden field of wheat and come to rest awkwardly against a barrel-shaped bale. Before he can reach it, the reflection turns from a smile to a torn, bloodied mouth and disappears. There, in one of the charred, ruined first class seats still smoldering at a lethal train derailment, he sees his briefcase crushed, its contents destroyed, the computer containing his entire life’s work flattened like scrap metal on the way to a salvage yard somewhere in northern New Jersey. There are signs of ruination everywhere in the detritus he imagines: body parts, clothing in flames, pieces and parts of their most precious keepsakes scattered across the plowed up, steaming landscape. The hectoring voices of his parents, demanding and intolerant, echo over and\n\nover in his head, knifing home once again the old familiar pressures from high school and college, even from his grad school days.\n\nIn Las Vegas, there’s a breakthrough of sorts.\n\n“Wallensky?” she says. It’s her most affectionate term of endearment for him, a riff on his last name, spoken with a w interchanged for the v, the way she prefers he pronounce Svetlana. Swetlana.\n\n“Dr. Petrova-Wallensky?” he throws back playfully. He smiles at her. “Petrova, what’s on your mind?” They’ve got a suite high up in the Mandalay Bay, two bedrooms, an absurdly spacious living room. There’s a stunning view of the glittering Strip below.\n\n“Do you think we’ll be OK?” Her voice is timid, uncertain. So much is unsaid between them. So much ground to be covered. The promises they’ve made. Their mutual expectations, their individual ambitions. Her rise. His fall. The affair. The wine has fogged his mind, and he knows it’s no time to be serious. She throws her hair back, flowing and luxuriant, that Slavic iridescent black with its bluish hues radiant and almost painfully alluring. The movement invites him to the soft, dark skin of her neck. It is so unexpected that it takes him a moment to react.\n\n“Do you want us to be OK?” he asks, moving to her side, touching his fingers to her closed eyelids, the bridge of her nose, the perfect white teeth her slightly parted lips have exposed. She doesn’t answer. They close the bedroom door softly, open the curtains to the bright lights of the night to charge the moment with an erotic current. When he touches her, he finds that she is already wet with anticipation, a river of fierce, unexpected desire.\n\nThe next day, on the way to the north rim of the Grand Canyon, her cell phone rings. She listens with the phone pressed tightly to her ear as if to contain the sound, suppress the vibrations of whatever is being said. David can hear only the muffled words of a male voice.\n\nFinally, she speaks. “No, Elliott, that’s just not possible. No, no…I can’t. See if you can get Chandravarti to do the procedure. Truthfully, she’s as good as I am for this.” She listens another moment. “Only in a genuine emergency. Please.” There is no goodbye. She closes the phone and powers it off, her face suddenly closed and brooding as if deep gray storm clouds were scudding toward them, bringing a deluge to ruin the sweeping vista stretching out to the distant horizon.\n\nShe turns to David. His eyes glance away from the road to look at her for only a second or two, trying not to show his disgust—no, his contempt—that Elliott, he of the fancifully embalmed genitalia, has actually called her when he knows how overwrought she has\n\nbeen for many months now. “It’s a complicated surgery. It was scheduled for the day after we get back, but Elliott thinks we can’t wait that long. You heard what I said. But if he calls back again, God, I don’t want to hear myself say this, I’m sorry, but if he does call again, can we find a way to shorten the rest of the trip?”\n\nShorten the trip, he thinks. For always and always, until death us do part. He chews on this slowly, digesting the import of what he is about to say. He bites off each word. “Yes, Petrova. We. Can. Shorten. The. Trip.”\n\n1:37 PM\n\nDavid turns into the passing lane once more, pulls even with the maroon SUV. The road looks clear, its gritty, pock-marked surface an endlessly straight pathway to the far off, indistinct horizon. Four miles ahead on the shimmering pavement, barely a speck at that distance, an eighteen-wheeler is heading in their direction. They are hurtling toward each other, but lulled by the heat, his eyes drifting to the desert on his left, David is distracted and pays no attention to the looming whiteness. Has the SUV sped up? Suddenly it seems to be keeping pace with him. He presses the accelerator more firmly, trying to gain speed and front end clearance.\n\nThe SUV’s driver side window is opening, scrolling down. The driver’s profile has come into view, a young man in his early or mid-twenties. He’s gesturing to David, pinrolling his left hand as if he wants David to open the passenger window of the rental car. He’s\n\nholding a cigar, and now he’s thrusting forward with it, pointing toward the open roadway up ahead. There is only the far off semi. What’s he trying to say? Does he think they’ve entered a game of chicken at 85 miles per hour? There is a passenger in the SUV, a male considerably older than the driver. He leans over the steering wheel, grinning at David, then thrusts his right arm into view, clenching his fist. He tightens his bicep, a body-builder’s physique, rippling its blue and red rattlesnake tattoo. David feels a frisson\n\nof excitement at this, an inexplicable surge of adrenalin. The passenger has a swarthy, unkempt look. He’s unshaven and grizzly, maybe the driver’s father, maybe his pimp. If this man were to open his mouth, David is certain he would see a single shining gold tooth, a tooth that signals criminality, or a gaping space where such a tooth might be.\n\nDavid thinks the driver is quite handsome, a James Dean face, square-jawed, entrancing blue eyes. He admires this face, so clean-looking, so young, though not innocent. Definitely no longer innocent and naïve. David’s state of mind is deteriorating quickly now. He finds himself thinking absurd, sick thoughts about the driver’s life as a gigolo, bound in slavery to his passenger who is bringing him to Mexico where he will service the wealthy Latinas, plump and buxom senoras, svelte, anorexic senoritas, and the occasional ricachon.\n\n1:38 PM\n\nThe driver who is now a gigolo on his way to Mexico points forward with his cigar once again. His mouth curling into a snarl, he throws the cigar onto the hood of David’s rental\n\ncar where it rolls into the shallow gulley below the windshield washers, its phallic swollen mass coming to rest like something obscene and fecal. That’s when David notices that the speck up ahead has turned into something well-defined, the silver vertical exhaust pipes gleaming in the sun on both sides of the square featureless cab. There’s a shape in there that might be the driver’s head or a passenger, perhaps the driver’s son. David’s stomach turns over; his heart is hammering. He does not look at the gigolo as he\n\nhits the accelerator pedal again. He is no longer racing or passing. The way he likes to think about it, he’s just….shortening the trip.\n\n1:39 PM\n\nWith his right arm David reaches over toward the passenger seat to touch his wife. The fingers of his right hand first trace the small bony structures at the top of her shoulder, then move across her neckline, the place he used to love to kiss, the place she used to love him to kiss, and then to the rise of her breast. In his mind he hears Dylan singing the lyrics that have haunted him for so many years. And if my thought-dreams could be seen, they’d probably put my head in a guillotine.\n\nNow comes the tricky part. He sets his left knee against the steering wheel to keep it steady and turns his head and shoulders toward the passenger seat, reaching for Svetlana with his left hand to shake her awake. He wants to be looking into her eyes when it happens. He glances into the back seat, imagines for just a moment that there is a child there, a phantom daughter, seven or eight years old, the Nadia or Elena for whom they never had time. He sees so much in that one moment. He sees her lying across the back seat, sleeping, and when he awakens her she hears, as he does, the urgent low pitch of the eighteen-wheeler’s horn bellowing at them uselessly. She says to him in her hoarse, carefree voice “Daddy, are you crying? Why are you crying? Daddy?” Through the rear window he sees that the gigolo has desperately braked the maroon SUV, screeching off the roadway. David watches it disappear behind them down a shallow embankment,\n\ncareening onto the hard-packed desert floor. Laughing at their cowardice, he holds Svetlana’s hand very tightly as he pushes the gas pedal to the floor.\n\nAt last, Svetlana startles awake. David slips his knee forward and wedges his thigh, his straining, rigid quadriceps, tightly against the steering column, trying to lock it in place. He looks into Svetlana’s eyes as he digs the fingers of his hands into her soft, trusting flesh. He envisions the wreckage.\n\nStan Lee Werlin’s short stories have previously appeared in Southern Humanities Review, Los Angeles Review, and Sheepshead Review, with another story forthcoming in Glassworks. Since 1987, his humorous children’s poetry has been published in children’s magazines including Cricket, Spider, Highlights for Children, and Odyssey, as well as in several anthologies. He is an avid reader, enjoys competitive tennis and online Scrabble, and is a lifelong fan of the Boston Bruins!\n\nQ&A\n\nQ: What was the inspiration for this story?\n\nA: Driving to New Hampshire for a family vacation when I was 9 or 10, my father turned the car into the left lane of a two lane road, misjudged the distance of an oncoming car, and wound up driving into the breakdown lane on the far left and then completely off the roadway to avoid a headlong collision. A few years ago, when my wife and I were driving in remote Arizona from Canyon de Chelly to Sedona, I pulled us out into the left lane of a two lane highway to pass the car we were trailing. I daydreamed a moment and came out of it to find an eighteen wheeler heading toward us and the car I was passing still abreast of us on the right. I had about 20 seconds to pass or pull back and it was completely unnerving. The story gradually formed from these two incidents.\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by the human capacity to reach a flashpoint at which rational behavior—overcome by emotions, anger, stress, loss, humiliation, failure, a chance word, or who knows what other causes—suddenly disappears. And I don’t think IQ has much to do with it. I think—like the character David Valensky in \"Wreckage\"—we all harbor the capacity for unpredictable, violent, and horrific post-flashpoint behavior. Fortunately, for most people, it is never triggered.\n\nQ: What does your writing space look like?\n\nA: Nothing special. Desk and laptop.\n\nQ: What’s your writing process?\n\nA: I seem to need extreme quiet. Without the muse, there's no point in trying to force the writing. When the muse is present, I can't not write.\n\nQ: What living writer do you admire most and why? Is there a particular book you refer to again and again?\n\nA: James Lee Burke. His insight into the human psyche and his ability to write about his characters in ways that reveal their psyches is breathtaking. To me his police/crime genre novels are literature in its finest sense.\n\nQ: What are you working on now?\n\nA: Several short stories underway, waiting for the muse.\n\nAryeh had come too early to the airport. His cousin Leo’s fax had informed him that Stella Richter, his girlfriend Harriet’s widowed ex-mother-in-law, would be landing at seven in the evening. It was now only five-thirty. Except for the airline, flight number, and time of arrival, and an oblique reference to Mrs. Richter’s “tragic circumstances,” Leo hadn’t even included a description of the woman Aryeh was supposed to meet.\n\nRemoving the crumpled message from his pocket, Aryeh read it for the twentieth time. A testy maintenance man in a baggy jumpsuit and high rubber boots was trying to mop the floor under his seat.\n\n“Do you want me to get up, friend?” Aryeh said, annoyed, though his voice was low-pitched and polite. It might be that the maintenance man was a security agent in disguise. Then again, knowing his countrymen as well as he did, it might be just a rude maintenance man at that.\n\n“Not at all, you needn’t get up on my account,” said the mustached man, resting his chin on his mop handle.\n\nI’ve been sitting here too long; that’s what it is. I look suspicious, Aryeh thought, getting up and making a conciliatory gesture with his hand. Thank heaven for these security boys. Aryeh elbowed his way through a crowd of Scandinavian tourists to the coffee bar and ordered an espresso. Leaning against the packed counter, he eyed himself in the mirror over the bar. Reflecting back at him was a dour-faced man in protracted mourning wearing a shabby gray jacket and pants, unfashionably pointed wing-tip shoes, and with hair so long that even his son referred to him, in English, as, “My father, the hippie.” What would the American lady think of him?\n\nLeo didn’t give me enough time to reflect on this, to prepare, or to refuse, he thought, trying at the same time to avoid the frank gaze of the girl in the white cap who was standing in front of him at the counter waiting for him to pay for his coffee.\n\n“How do I present myself to a stranger, a woman I’ve never met before?” he’d asked his daughter Naomi in Jerusalem on the telephone that morning, immediately after the fax had arrived.\n\n“Tell her you’re a widower with a wounded son to take care of,” Naomi had advised him. “Tell her you’re still mad with grief over your wife who’s been dead for four years. If she’s rich, let her take you to the Hilton for dinner. Try to be your usual adorable self, Abba. Try not to be distracted; don’t smoke like a chimney if you can help it; and above all, don’t go on about your being a Freemason and a believer in the Brotherhood of Man and all that. Stay out of arguments about the Arabs.”\n\nUnlike her gentle brother Yosef, Naomi could joke about such things. Her appointment as assistant professor of philosophy at the precocious age of twenty-seven had made her proud and more than a little caustic. Maybe, too, the fact that she had lost her fiancé in a skirmish on the Golan Heights. Now she no longer seemed interested in dating, but devoted every minute of her time to preparing her courses and to some arcane piece of work she was writing that had to do, she’d once let drop, with an eighteenth-century British philosopher whose name he’d forgotten. Now that Naomi lived alone in Jerusalem and hung around with intellectuals, Aryeh could no longer hold a serious conversation with her; all she did was joke.\n\nBut she’s right, Aryeh thought. I do smoke like a chimney. His jacket lapels smelled of stale tobacco. He’d bought a packet of breath mints at a kiosk before entering the airport. Now he unwrapped it and put one into his mouth. Hating the chalky taste, he spat it into his hand then threw it, along with the entire packet, into a nearby trash basket. Mrs. Richter would have to tolerate his tobacco smell.\n\nIn the men’s room, he combed his hair and washed his hands with fragrant green soap. Here, too, he was stalked by the ubiquitous maintenance man. Only three days before an Arab boy of twelve had left a homemade bomb on a toilet seat. Luckily, when it exploded the men’s room had been empty. Aryeh nodded at the maintenance man and walked out of the men’s room. He went back to the kiosk and scanned the newspapers, then thought of buying a paperback to while away the time, but did not, because he was too restless to read. Besides, he didn’t want to waste the money on a book he might end up throwing away. Aryeh did not like to think of himself as stingy, but since his retirement he’d begun to worry about wasting money. Yosef’s army pension had provided additional money toward rent and household expenses, but even that hadn’t kept up with inflation. Everyone in Israel these days was suffering from lack of money—everyone he knew, anyway. Not counting, of course, the diplomats, politicians, businessmen, and espionage agents who traveled around the world at the taxpayer’s expense. Aryeh had once toyed with the idea of becoming a diplomat himself (his English, Russian, and Arabic were almost as fluent as his Hebrew), but Yosef’s condition on returning from the front had put any notion of travel to rest.\n\nThen there were the wealthy Americans. He’d watched them lolling about on the beaches near the hotels only a few blocks from his flat. They were good for Israel, pumped millions into the economy; but that didn’t keep Aryeh from disliking them. Their bloated bellies and gross conversations appalled him, and he no longer walked in the direction of the hotels when he went to the market in the morning. The last time he’d taken the beach road, he’d been outraged by an American woman he’d seen pointing to a passing military jet overhead. “See that up there?” she’d smirked at her Israeli escort, “that’s my Phantom, paid for with my American dollars.” The handsome young Sabra hadn’t really understood her. Only the word “Phantom” seemed to have registered. He’d thrown back his curly head and, showing his beautiful white teeth, laughed up at the sky. Both the crudeness of the woman and the pitiful laughter of the Sabra had disgusted him. These ignorant, swaggering Americans were always making boastful remarks at his country’s expense unaware (and probably not caring) that the “natives” might understand what they were saying. Aryeh could no longer count how many times he’d had to restrain himself from walking up to these American Jews on the street and telling them to take their money and go to hell. When he complained to Naomi, she brushed him off.\n\n“Don’t listen to them, Abba,” she said in her joking tone of voice. “Just as long as the money keeps coming, what do you care what they say?”\n\nChildren were like that. They grew up, became preoccupied with their arcane philosophical treatises and their radical politics; radical today, conservative tomorrow. Aryeh knew, he’d been through it all himself. But he was sick and tired of politics, would rather spend his time thinking of Marti. Every so often, in the midst of a crowd, he might catch sight of a woman who reminded him of her. Even a small detail could set his heart to banging between his ribs like a loose hinge on a door, make him short of breath and bring dry sobs to his throat. Only a moment ago he’d been set off by the glimpse of a glossy black chignon. But then, as the woman passed by, awkwardly clomping along on thick platform shoes, he’d noticed that her expression was bland and stupid, her eyes dull. Her face looked nothing at all like Marti’s, which, defined by its high Slavic cheekbones, had been wide and intelligent. The light illuminating his wife’s green eyes had been otherworldly, like no other light he had ever seen.\n\nBefore moving to Israel, Marti had been an artist and a photographer’s model in Paris. A Hungarian beauty with long legs and a ready laugh, she’d been an excellent dancer. They’d met at a nightclub where Aryeh and his friends, a group of idealistic young engineers with big plans for irrigating the desert, had gone dancing.\n\nJaffa. A cool night swarming with stars. A club called The Scorpion. The “Pride of Lions,” as he and his friends called themselves, had worn their best clothes. Three beret-clad strolling musicians were playing a balalaika, a clarinet, and a violin. What they lacked in technique, they made up for with flashy bows, out-thrust chins, and sheer loudness. Aryeh and his friends were in a particularly good mood that night, since one of them, Yakov, had lost a distant uncle in Prague who’d left him a small inheritance. The Pride of Lions planned to celebrate Yakov’s newly acquired “wealth” with wine and dancing.\n\nA tall girl with a pockmarked face and big feet was the first to approach their table. She’d been sitting with two companions a few tables away and had ignored her friends when they tried to stop her. But her friends hadn’t objected strenuously enough, and the big girl had had her way. Soon the two tables were joined and the separate parties converged, making a group of six. Lea, pale and fragile except for her great bulging bosoms, shyly flirted with Uri, a muscular giant with a beard and drooping mustaches, which, Lea said, reminded her of a circus wrestler she’d seen as a child. Uri, who lifted weights, took this as an immediate invitation to regale them all with the story of his life, which, of course, had nothing to do with either circuses or wrestlers. Uri was to marry his shy Lea and become a high school math teacher. Two years later, along with ten of his students, he would die in a bomb attack on his school.\n\nYakov, a sputtering Marxist, was immediately chosen by Irina of the big feet. Hardly paying her any mind, he was busily lecturing his friends on the inevitable decay of capitalism and the triumph of the proletariat. But the music was loud, and his friends were too busy flirting to pay any attention to him. It was a perfect evening for the young. Wonderful to be alive with your back pressed against the hard iron coils of a café chair, the circular designs imprinted on the skin under your shirt, boasting, pontificating, shouting platitudes at no one in particular, and feeling totally invulnerable.\n\nAryeh sat and stared at Marti as she talked about her life in Paris among the artists. “Don’t be deceived by her refined features,” Yakov had leaned over and whispered in his ear. “This girl is far from being a delicate flower.”\n\nMarti had challenged him and his friends to dance that night at The Scorpion. “You all talk a good game,” she’d said, placing her hands on the table in front of him. “Now let’s see if even one of you can do something.”\n\n“Go on, Valentino,” Uri cried, pushing Aryeh up from his chair. “Give her number 35B,” he urged, referring to a classification of techniques the Pride of Lions had developed among themselves for impressing women.\n\nThe frantic musicians had launched into a tango. Mimicking a Parisian apache dancer, Aryeh had gotten up from the table and pulled Marti close to his chest. She’d responded by pressing her cheek against his and vamping them across the crowded dance floor. Then she’d led him out the open door to a small patio on the beach, the musicians and their friends following after them. Though it smelled strongly of fish, the patio provided a perfect Hollywood set, and they were soon joined outside by the other dancers, who began clapping in time to the music. Marti had taken the crowd’s clapping and shouting as a cue to show off her considerable dancing skills. Giving him no warning other than a broad, toothsome smile, and clutching the ends of her wide skirt in her hands, she’d swung herself out of his grasp, jumped up on a table, and graced her audience with a furious flamenco performance. Ending with a loud “Ole!” she’d leapt from the table into his arms. Aryeh had been so caught up in Marti’s performance that, without realizing what he was doing, he had dipped her low to the floor and landed a passionate kiss on her mouth.\n\nYakov came up and clapped him hard on the shoulder as they made their way back into the club through the stamping, cheering crowd. “I fear you’re headed for the bourgeois domestic trap, my friend Aryeh. Never before have I seen such an obvious surrender of— ”\n\n“Enough! No more pontificating tonight, Yakov,” Aryeh scolded after they’d sat down again at their table. Not wanting to spoil the remainder of the evening with an argument, he’d made a big show of ordering a large bottle of cognac; it had been a symbolic gesture, really, a way of announcing to his friends that he’d fallen passionately in love with Marti and wanted them to help him celebrate the occasion. But as it happened so often with him, Aryeh hadn’t been able to come up with the right words. If he’d been an orator, like Yakov, or a boaster, like Uri, he might have climbed on a chair and publicly made his declaration of love. But he was an introvert by nature, and the very best he’d been able to do to celebrate his newfound love was order a bottle of cognac.\n\nNow, everyone else but Aryeh was drinking and smoking and talking. The musicians had packed up and gone, the dancers had dispersed; only an ancient radio grinding out popular tunes in Arabic was left to provide them with background music. Aryeh leaned back in his chair. Through the open door of the club, he could see the port of Jaffa with its jutting Andromeda’s Rock. He had dreamed great things for that harbor; had entered Palestine that way himself. Many relatives had died, would never see the new homeland. Aryeh considered himself lucky to be sitting in The Scorpion; lucky to be surrounded by friends, dreaming dreams for the future with Marti.\n\n“The bottle’s almost empty.” Looking like a rabbi speculating on a moral problem Yakov shrugged and creased his forehead.\n\n“Never mind the cognac. Lea, it’s time for you to hear Aryeh’s story,” said Uri, who could not enjoy an evening out unless it included someone’s life story and, because he’d already told his own, wanted to impress Lea with Aryeh’s. “I was born here, in Palestine, Yakov came as a babe in arms, but what a tale Aryeh has to tell!” Snuggling Lea, Uri rocked back in his chair and almost crashed them both into the tray of a passing waiter.\n\n“Aren’t you bored with it by now?” Aryeh had intended to reserve the details of his life for Marti when they were alone. The gardenia scent of her perfume was still clinging to his shirt collar, arousing him, and he had no desire to share himself with anyone but her. But Marti would not be put off. Leaning forward on her elbows and giving him an impish grin, she said, “Yes, let’s hear it. Let’s hear this amazing life story of yours.”\n\nYakov snorted. “Fled from the only hope we Jews ever had in all our miserable history,” he said. “Mother Russia wasn’t good enough for you after the Revolution, eh? You enjoyed those pogroms, did you?”\n\nThe others booed him.\n\n“Let the man give us his own story, will you?” Irina kicked Yakov under the table with her outsized shoe, settling him into grudging silence.\n\nPleased at seeing his newfound importance reflected in Marti’s eyes, Aryeh had given in.\n\n“Well, do you want it from the beginning or from the time we had to leave Siberia?”\n\n“Sketch in the details for us,” said Uri, waving his huge calloused hands at him impatiently. “And don’t forget the Tatars.”\n\n“Oh,” squealed Lea. “You grew up in Siberia, among the Tatars, how exotic!”\n\nNodding, Aryeh poured the last of the cognac into his glass and drank it down in one gulp.\n\n“I’m from Odessa,” Lea said excitedly. “It’s so coo-ld in Siberia; how could you stand it?”\n\n“Shush,” intercepted the massive Irina, “let the man tell his story. You can give weather reports later.”\n\n“Loz zein shah!” cried Yakov in Yiddish, banging his fist on the table. “Let there be silence!”\n\nFeeling the cognac burning a hole in his gut, Aryeh smacked his lips and winced. Then he said, “My father was a rich textile merchant in Irkutsk. We lived in luxury; my mother played the piano, we had a maid and a chauffeur, carpets on every floor and the smoked side of a cow in the cellar, along with sacks full of sunflower seeds, halvah, caviar, pistachios—plenty of good things to eat, always. As for Yakov’s pogroms, we never knew any, where we lived, because it was too cold for the anti-Semites. The community was interdependent; my father had plenty of non-Jewish friends and customers. In fact, according to Jewish custom, we used to invite one Gentile friend to our Passover Seder each year.\n\n“We might have been wealthy, but we were raised with a strong social consciousness. The poor were always welcome at our table; we kids were often moved out of our beds and sent to sleep on top of the huge stove in the kitchen to accommodate a wandering scholar or a pianist down on his luck. I was ten, my brother Sasha thirteen, and my sister Olga nineteen when the sons of the Glorious Revolution finally made their way to Siberia. My father had always done business without gouging any of his customers. He treated his workers fairly; he was a deeply ethical, deeply religious man and was held in high esteem by everyone in the community. Even the Tatars, known for their shrewd bargaining abilities, trusted him. He was the only merchant in Irkutsk they would trade with.\n\n“I remember them in their great, shaggy fur coats and soft reindeer skin boots, sitting on pickle barrels spitting sunflower seed shells on the floor as they countered my father’s prices. Sometimes they would sit like that for hours without saying a word, only blurting out a bargain price for a rug, which they must have wanted very badly, because those Tatars never showed their eagerness over anything. They were so placid, with their round golden faces, piercing black eyes, and thick, straight hair hanging past their shoulders to the middle of their backs, or, occasionally, braided into long pigtails.”\n\n“There’s the old stereotype . . . the inscrutable Oriental,” Yakov interrupted sarcastically.\n\n“Shut up!” Irina prodded him with her elbow. Giving her a disgusted look, Yakov folded his arms on his chest and pretended to doze.\n\n“My sister—unknown to the rest of us—”Aryeh resumed, talking only to Marti now, “had joined the Reds and worked her way up the bureaucratic ladder, becoming a minor functionary in the Komsomol group she’d secretly joined. Ironically, that was what saved us all. It turned out that someone had gone to the Communist authorities (my father later found out it was a jealous neighbor, a Jew, by the way) and told them that he was hiding an enormous fortune in his cellar. This wasn’t true, at least not by then, because my father, who was always one step ahead of politics, had sent the bulk of his fortune to his brother in Palestine in the hope of settling here one day.”\n\n“And the money . . . ” Uri interposed. “Tell them what happened to it.”\n\n“Later.” Aryeh smiled indulgently. He’d wanted so much to be alone with Marti at that moment, to forget the past—as dangerous, colorful, and exciting as it was—and begin a new life with her. Looking into her eyes had made him want to erase it all, and he’d had to grope for memories that had once come to him so easily.\n\nUri, who’d heard the story many times, sensed that Aryeh was growing distracted and prodded him on. Wrinkling his forehead, he said, “Okay, so the sister by this time was a Communist and the neighbor squealed about the money, then what?”\n\n“Then one fine day a gentleman with a mustache like Stalin’s and a red armband on his coat sleeve knocked at our door. He was soon followed by other gentlemen with red armbands on their coat sleeves who demanded to search the house.\n\n“‘We hear you have a fortune stashed away in this house,’ said the first gentleman, his eyes traveling over the furniture, the silk shawl on the piano, the shivering maid. ‘For the sake of the Revolution, comrade, surely you won’t mind if we have a look.’\n\n“Seeing a bulge under my mother’s apron, the first gentleman asked her, politely, to remove her ‘money belt’—and was clearly disappointed to find that it wasn’t a money belt but the rolling pin my mother, who’d been in the middle of baking, had stuffed under her apron in case she would have to bang heads. Finding nothing of importance, they took the food from our cupboards, confiscated, they said, for the good of Yakov’s ‘glorious revolution,’ and told us we’d better be prepared to move—fast.\n\n“I’m sure it was only because of my sister’s Komsomol connections that we weren’t all put on ice and left to freeze to death, like our wealthy neighbors. Instead, we were allowed to take some clothes and books—but no money—and were sent to the district commissar who would ensure our safe departure from the Soviet Union. Handing us glasses of tea stuffed with jam, respectfully bowing to my mother, and apologizing profusely for the delay, that gentleman informed us that he could do nothing until he’d heard from Central Headquarters. After four days of my mother’s weeping and my father’s appeal to the commissar as “one human being to another,” we were rudely pushed onto a dock with our few belongings and packed into steerage on a leaky tub headed for Jaffa. Despite our pleas, my sister had chosen to remain behind.\n\n“‘Never mind,’ my father would comfort us against the stench of humanity in steerage. ‘Olga will join us once we get there, and we’ll all be happy again. Wait and see, the weather will be warm and we will live in a pardes, a garden.’\n\n“‘Like Adam and Eve?’ my brother Sasha, a serious Bible scholar, wanted to know.\n\n“‘Better than Adam and Eve,’ said my father, patting him on the head. ‘We’ll live in an orange grove and you’ll pick juicy oranges from the trees and eat them right there’—”\n\nYakov snorted, his eyelids still closed in ostensible sleep, “Some orange groves!”\n\n“Will you shut up and let the man tell his story,” Uri chided, thrusting his face up close to Yakov’s.\n\nMarti threw back her shoulders, pushed her chair to one side and crossed her long legs. “I’ll bet you landed and found yourself paupers,” she said.\n\n“How did you guess?” Aryeh asked, his heart overflowing with tenderness toward her.\n\nTurning to face him, Marti clasped his hand. “Because it happened that way to ninety nine percent of those who came here with high hopes for the Promised Land. Instead of milk and honey, our parents came here and found sand and rocks.”\n\n“Lea, your parents were never poor; you always went to French school and took lunches with the children of diplomats, as I recall,” said Irina, having always envied her friend’s good fortune.\n\n“My father is a doctor. Professional people were desperately needed here. The place was full of malaria then,” said Lea defensively.\n\n“What do you mean then? What about today, may I ask?” Yakov opened his eyes fully, now abandoning all pretenses at sleep. It was a subject close to him that they were discussing here, none of the old nostalgic driveling over the Tsarist murderers. “I have two cousins right now down with malaria. They’re draining swampland in the North, and a lot anyone cares for them,” he finished testily.\n\n“I guess no one wants to hear my life story anymore,” said Aryeh.\n\n“Me, I do.” Marti and he were now holding hands openly. “Why don’t you walk me home and finish it.”\n\nGiven the clue to disband, the Pride of Lions coupled off—Yakov still in a bad temper, with stooped shoulders, his hands in his pockets, scuffing along like a truculent schoolboy, Uri disgruntled at having lost control of the evening’s direction, yet excited at the prospect of pressing his chest against Lea’s enticing breasts in her doorway, and Aryeh wildly, overwhelmingly in love.\n\nWhen he and Marti were alone, she turned to him and said, “Did the uncle steal the money?”\n\nCaught off balance, Aryeh asked, “What uncle?” It was a tactic Marti would use throughout their life together, picking up the strand of a long-lapsed conversation and surprising him with a question.\n\n“The one your father gave all the rubles to in advance.”\n\n“Oh, my uncle . . .” He guided her down a narrow cobblestone staircase into the town square and led her to a bench in front of the Tower of Abdul Hamid. “No, he didn’t steal the money. He was a poet, a sincere Orthodox Jew; he would never steal it outright. But he did manage to invest it poorly and lose every last ruble.”\n\nMarti laughed. “Forgive me. I know it must seem like a tragedy to you but I was just picturing the looks on your faces.”\n\n“It wasn’t very funny to my mother. She was a lady, with fine hands and superior manners.”\n\n“Did your father punch the uncle in the nose?”\n\n“Of course not. Where do you get such ideas?”\n\n“That’s what my father would have done.” Again she laughed, covering her mouth with her hands, her shoulders bobbing. “I’m really sorry. I’m given to laughing fits—sometimes over nothing. When I was little they used to keep me after school for punishment, making me write a thousand times on the blackboard that I would not laugh in class. But that didn’t help, I went right on laughing anyway. My classmates called me ‘the laughing fool.’ I think I inherited the tendency from my mother. She and I would only just have to look at each other in a shop and we’d burst out laughing so hard we’d nearly collapse.”\n\n“How strange.”\n\n“Yes, isn’t it?” Marti stopped giggling suddenly and gave him a serious look. “I guess it’s what psychologists would call nerves.”\n\n“I guess so.”\n\n“I think you might want to kiss me now.” Closing her eyes, she lifted her face and puckered her lips into a cupid’s bow.\n\nAryeh moved toward her, but something about her exaggerated preparation for his kiss tickled him and he guffawed. Marti joined in, and for a full five minutes the two of them had sat in the square rocking the bench with their laughter . . .\n\nLike a man reaching out for a phantom limb, Aryeh forced his wife back into consciousness, forming and re-forming their life together, as he was now, in his mind, though outwardly preoccupied with scanning the faces of the tourists as they emerged from behind the customs barrier.\n\n“Excuse me,” someone was interrupting the flow of his thoughts. Aryeh looked in the direction of the voice that had addressed him in English and saw that it belonged to a brisk, sturdy little woman wearing a smart gray suit and matching gray felt hat and carrying an expensive alligator purse.\n\n“Excuse me,” she said again, “you wouldn’t happen to be Mr. Lieber, would you? Aryeh Lieber?”\n\nRecipient of the Theodore Hoepfner Fiction Award and past writer-in-residence at the Mishkenot Sha’ananim Artists’ Colony in Jerusalem, Pushcart Prize-nominee Perle Besserman was praised by Isaac Bashevis Singer for the “clarity and feeling for mystic lore” of her writing and by Publisher’s Weekly for its “wisdom [that] points to a universal practice of the heart.” Her autobiographical novel Pilgrimage was published by Houghton Mifflin, and her latest novels, Kabuki Boy, and Widow Zion, and two story collections, Marriage and Other Travesties of Love, and Yeshiva Girl, are available from Aqueous Books, Pinyon Publishing, and Homebound Publishing, respectively.

I sit quietly in front of my computer and wait until the stage inside my head is occupied by characters, dialogue, and situations that demand to be told, before I start writing. It’s a very visual, and even auditory, experience—a bit like dreaming. After the story appears on the page, I shift into editorial mode, revising, reworking, and “revisioning” the material, in a conscious effort to find “le mot juste”.\n\nQ: What living writer do you admire most and why? Is there a particular book you refer to again and again?\n\nA: Too many to name here. But, if I have to pick only one, I’ll say Alice Munro.\n\nThe particular book I refer to, though, is Dickens’s Great Expectations.\n\nQ: What are you working on now?\n\nA: Two novels (The Kabbalah Master and The Infamous Doctor Dee) and a story collection (Fay’s Men) all very different in character, setting, and tone—yet related by the common theme of spiritual searching, its misadventures and, too often, baleful encounters. “The Beach Incident,” a slightly different version of the first chapter of The Kabbalah Master was recently published in the online literary journal “Imitation Fruit.” And most of the stories in Fay’s Men appeared in a number of literary journals both in the United States and in Australia.\n\nSue Ellen enjoyed the drive from Cincinnati to White Burley more than she was willing to admit. The trees and fields looked clean and fresh. She was a city girl, and all the seemingly untamed land seemed like some kind of frontier to her. She felt like she imagined the colonists must’ve felt entering the “virgin” woods. Except, of course, for the fact that it wasn’t at all “virgin.”\n\n“So you’re saying southern Ohio is a whore?” Joan said when Sue Ellen told her. This was during the first time Sue Ellen made the drive, to check out the town neither of them had even heard of before Sue Ellen got the internship.\n\nThe town was essentially a cluster of businesses along one main road, none of them chains, with a few houses radiating out from it. It was difficult to tell if all of the businesses were even open; one that claimed to be an auto parts store appeared closed, for example, until the women watched a man exit. There were a handful of people walking along the street or between buildings.\n\n“What are there, four hundred people in this hamlet?” Joan said.\n\n“Four thousand,” Sue Ellen said. She took Joan’s hand, but Joan jerked it away.\n\n“You want to get us lynched?” Joan said. “Two black girls holding hands out here? You might as well paint a target on us.”\n\n“Come on,” Sue Ellen said.\n\n“My momma didn’t raise no fool,” Joan said. “Until we get back to civilization, we are two straight girls. And I’m Puerto Rican.”\n\nSue Ellen laughed, in spite of herself.\n\n“This is a really good opportunity,” she said. “Do you realize how lucky I am? I had had no internship. I was the only one in my class before—”\n\n“Because you put it off till the last minute so this was all you could get.”\n\n“Yeah, well. Call me lucky.”\n\n“You’ll think lucky when Cletus and Jethro get a hold of you.”\n\nJoan wouldn’t look her in the eye. “Honey,” Sue Ellen said.\n\nJoan waved her away. “I get it,” she said.\n\n“This is huge. It could be the biggest anthropological discovery in southern Ohio.”\n\nJoan laughed, but at least she finally made eye contact. Sue Ellen laughed, too.\n\n“Thank God for Wal-Mart,” Joan said. “So if it’s such a big deal, why are there only a couple people working it?”\n\n“Money,” Sue Ellen said. “We’re going to be like the advance scouts, laying the groundwork and securing the site.”\n\nThey passed the town and went out to the site where Sue Ellen hoped to be spending most of her time.\n\n“Nice place to settle down, raise some kids,” she said.\n\nJoan mimicked shooting herself in the head.\n\nSue Ellen pulled over. There was a field beside them, roped off with wooden pegs and twine. A little ways away, a bulldozer sat, impassive. Near it, they could just make out plastic sheeting on the ground.\n\n“This is it?” Joan said.\n\n“According to the GPS.”\n\n“The greatest anthropological discovery in southern Ohio, huh? This is going to propel you to fame and fortune?”\n\n“Dr. Yeager says I’ll probably be able to publish,” Sue Ellen said. It sounded lame in her ears. Joan wouldn’t look at her again. “I’ll be home every weekend,” Sue Ellen said. “Maybe you can come stay with me a few times. Might be nice to get out of the city.”\n\n“Not a chance.” Joan turned from the window. “I like the city. But if you want to stay out here, you go right ahead.”\n\nIt was a grudging acceptance, but Sue Ellen took it. She turned the car around and headed back for Cincinnati. After they passed the town, Joan let her hold her hand again.\n\n***\n\nTwo weeks later, Sue Ellen pulled off onto the road that led to the dig site and slammed on her brakes inches from the lines of pickup trucks blocking the dirt drive. There were a half-dozen of them and several smaller, junky, American-made cars as well, all bearing American flags and bumper stickers Sue Ellen knew better than to read. A group of locals—had to be—were gathered near them, most of them sitting in tattered nylon and aluminum lawn chairs, or the cheaper plastic ones. They held signs that said things like “Wal Mart is good for White Burley!” or “Let the past stay Buried!” There were big, bearded men, and angry women with children running around. She texted Joan quickly, OMG There are protestors!\n\nJoan texted back, Are their signs misspelled?\n\nSue Ellen laughed. They’re scary, she texted back.\n\nFuck ‘em.\n\nEasy for you to say, she thought. She set the phone in the passenger seat and breathed deep. The protestors stared at her with malevolent eyes—well, a couple of them did. Most of them just looked bored, actually, and several of them weren’t even paying any attention to her. She edged around them and eased past, followed by boos. She flinched and sped up when she heard the impacts as they threw empty cans and bottles at her. She heard Joan’s voice in her head yelling, “Those are recyclable, assholes!” It gave her strength.\n\nThere were a couple sheds probably from Lowes containing the generators and all the equipment they had, which, Sue Ellen had been shocked to discover, was far inferior to what she regularly used in lab classes back at the University of Cincinnati. Only a few of the bodies had actually been removed; most had simply been exposed and were covered with plastic tarp to protect them from the elements. The ones that had been unearthed were stacked inside the sheds, along the walls. None of the bodies had been removed from the scene for two reasons: one, because at first Milo, the coroner Sue Ellen was actually working for, was afraid they might be American Indian remains and would have to be reburied anyway; and two, there was nowhere else to put them.\n\nBefore she got out, Sue Ellen twisted all the way around in her seat to make sure none of the protestors had followed her, but they were all still back in their seats by the road. Thank God for diabetes, she mouthed. Milo was inside the first building, bent over a body.\n\n“What’s with the protestors, Milo?” she asked.\n\nWithout looking up from the body he was examining, he spoke, “They’re afraid we’ll take away their Super Wal-Mart.”\n\nShe stared at him. He pointed to his desk. There was a copy of the Brown County Citizen with a story on the front page about the dig.\n\n“Hey, we’re famous,” she said.\n\n“Keep reading.”\n\nThe gist of the article seemed to be that because of the bad press, the locals were afraid Wal-Mart might pull out and go to a different county, which they thought would be devastating to the local economy.\n\n“Don’t they know Wal-Mart is bad for small towns?” Sue Ellen said.\n\n“Folks get tired of driving forty-five minutes for groceries.”\n\n“Even if it means every other business in town dies?”\n\nHe shrugged. “Take a look at this.” He stepped back so she could get close to the body and then swiveled a light over. “You’re the student, here; what do you see?”\n\nShe leaned in close. There was nothing left of the body but bones, which Milo had laid out on the table. They were in bad shape. Most of the ribs were broken. The pelvis was shattered. It was hard to tell if it had even been male or female.\n\n“He didn’t die well,” Sue Ellen said. She flinched a little when she said it. The first skull she’d examined had been the first one unearthed. It had strange markings on it, and Sue Ellen had declared that they resembled knife marks, even butchery marks. Milo had led her out to the bulldozer still parked outside and showed her that the marks matched one of the treads. The skull had been damaged when it was unearthed. Sue Ellen felt like an idiot.\n\nThis time, though, Milo nodded. “How do you know it’s a he?”\n\nSue Ellen shrugged. “Seems to be pretty big, probably male.”\n\n“My guess as well.” Milo’s eyes twinkled a little. “So what does this tell us?”\n\nShe thought about it. “They’ve all been like this, victims of severe trauma.” It was true. Many of the skulls were practically shattered. Most had broken bones. “There’s no evidence of healing, so they were probably beaten to death or…” She searched for an alternative. “Died in some kind of disaster.”\n\nHe smiled. “Exactly.”\n\nShe examined the skull, which was in good shape. “Seems to be African American. The lower vertebrae are fused, so this was an older black male with arthritis.”\n\n“Seems likely.”\n\n“Well, that works with our pauper grave theory.” Milo’s theory was that the cemetery was a pauper cemetery, which would explain why it lacked grave stones. “I mean, life would be hard for poor people, especially during the Depression.”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“And the fact that they’re all black…well, black people were traditionally poor. But the violence is odd.”\n\n“We got the dates back,” Milo said. He found a folder on his desk and showed her. The bones had been dated to about ninety years ago.\n\n“So some time in the ´30s, a couple hundred blacks, mostly men, were either in some kind of…” She tried to think of possibilities. “Train crash? Or…what?”\n\nHe shrugged. “Who knows?”\n\n“How long have you lived here, Milo?”\n\n“How old do you think I am?”\n\n“No, I mean, did your parents or grandparents ever talk about anything like this?”\n\nHe shook his head. “I was born and raised in Cincinnati, Sue Ellen. I transferred to Brown County because it seemed like an easy gig. So in the twenty-three years I’ve been here, no, I’ve never heard of anything like this.”\n\n“Weird,” she said. “I followed up on the pauper cemetery theory.” She dug out her own folder and gave it to Milo. “The old hospital you mentioned that used to be here? I found one that was actually several miles away. And the nearest prison is a hundred miles away, and their cemetery is pretty well documented. There are records for two other old pauper cemeteries in the area, as well as several other cemeteries. So why is this one undocumented?”\n\n“Good question,” Milo said. He turned back to the bones. “Let’s see if we can find anything else.”\n\n***\n\nThat evening, Sue Ellen picked up some fast food and went back to her hotel room to Skype with Joan.\n\n“What are you eating?” Joan asked, immediately. “Is that fast food again?”\n\n“I don’t have time for anything else,” Sue Ellen said in between mouthfuls.\n\n“It’s a bag of grease,” Joan said. “No wonder you’re so tired all the time.”\n\n“I’m tired because I don’t have time to sleep. And there’s nowhere else to go, really, for food around here.”\n\n“Do they have a store? You could get a can of soup or something. But make sure it’s low sodium.”\n\nSue Ellen grunted.\n\n“At least get some fruit to eat.”\n\nSue Ellen held up a French fry slathered in ketchup. “Ketchup’s a fruit according to the government.”\n\n“I’m serious,” Joan said. “I’m not there to take care of you, so you have to take care of yourself.”\n\n“Yes, mother,” Sue Ellen pouted.\n\n“So what earth-shattering discovery did you make today?”\n\nSue Ellen told her about the evidence of violence on the bodies. “Milo thinks there are at least a couple hundred bodies, just about all buried without caskets. Every time we dig, we find one. Mostly men, but we’ve found some women and children as well.”\n\n“So what is it, some sort of massacre?” Joan was distracted but at least trying to look interested, which Sue Ellen appreciated.\n\n“Probably a pauper cemetery,” she said. “Poor people live violent lives.” Sue Ellen finished her food and tossed it in the trash. She made a mental note to take the trash out to the lobby so it wouldn’t make her room stink like grease.\n\n“Huh,” Joan said. “Listen, I can’t do this weekend. Something came up with my mom. I have to go see her.”\n\n“Is everything okay?” Sue Ellen asked. “Is she off her meds?”\n\nJoan shrugged, noncommittal. Joan’s mother was bipolar and recently born again, which she was using as an excuse not to take her meds.\n\n“Listen, honey, you can talk to me.” Sue Ellen sat up on the bed.\n\n“You’re not even here,” Joan said.\n\n“I can be. I can be there in a couple hours.”\n\nJoan shrugged. Sue Ellen was already mentally packing—the fact that Joan even mentioned Sue Ellen not being there for her was tantamount to another person breaking down and pouring out their life’s story. “You’re busy,” Joan said. “And tired. You’ve got to get back to looking at dead bodies first thing.”\n\n“I’m on my way. I’ll text you when I’m in the car,” Sue Ellen said. She slammed the computer closed, ran to the bathroom and did her best to freshen up, and grabbed her keys. She was out the door and to her car in less than five minutes.\n\n***\n\nFriday evening, Sue Ellen drove back to U. of Cincinnati a little early to meet with her advisor, Professor Yeager, who was actually the dean of the history department, a relationship from before Sue Ellen switched from majoring in history to anthropology. She’d made the appointment once she learned Joan wouldn’t be around that weekend.\n\nThey met in a dive bar near campus called Flanigan’s where all the students and professors hung out.\n\n“How’s White Town treating you?” Professor Yeager said with a smirk. He was a middle-aged white male who, Sue Ellen believed, would’ve done just about anything not to be.\n\n“White Burley.”\n\nHe laughed and took a drink. “And the difference is?”\n\n“Actually…” she told him about their findings. “It’s weird that we can’t find any records. There are at least two hundred bodies, maybe more.”\n\nHe was swaying a little in his seat, but she was nervous about asking him anything too personal. “From the 30s, you said? And they mostly met violent ends?”\n\nShe nodded.\n\nYeager considered this. “Do you know where the name White Burley came from?” She shook her head. “Tobacco,” he said. “It’s a strain of tobacco that became enormously popular. It was created near where the town now stands. After the Civil War and up through the early part of the 20th Century, Brown County was primarily an agricultural area. It still is very agricultural, but back then the main crop was tobacco.”\n\n“You think they were tobacco farmers?”\n\nHe shrugged. “The interesting thing is—what’s the racial breakdown of White Burley nowadays, do you think? 95% white?”\n\n“I’d say 99 at least.”\n\n“Traditionally, who tended to do the actual labor of farming tobacco, do you think?”\n\n“Blacks,” she said.\n\n“Nowadays, you go there, and it’s 99% white, but it wasn’t always.” He checked his watch. “I’ve got to run.”\n\n“Wait,” Sue Ellen said. “What are you saying?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Professor Yeager said. “But you want to be careful you don’t uncover any hornets’ nests.” He drained his drink and swayed on his feet. “Call me next week and let me know how it’s going.”\n\n***\n\nThe next morning, she hit the University library to search the archives but didn’t have a lot of luck. On a hunch, she drove to Columbus to hit the city library. She spent the day searching the newspaper archives and called Milo after they kicked her out for the night.\n\n“Sorry, I know it’s your day off,” she said. “But I’m working something out.”\n\n“Tell me what you have,” he said. That was something she loved about Milo—he never acted annoyed or put out; he was always supportive.\n\n“I still haven’t found any records of the cemetery,” she said. “But I started thinking that was kind of evidence by itself. So I searched the archives for the Brown County Citizen and all the papers I could find in the state from the 30s, and from March through June, 1932, there are no archives. For any of the papers.”\n\nShe made herself pause to hear his reaction. He hardly had one. “Was there some kind of fire in the library, maybe?”\n\n“I checked two libraries,” she said. “The university one and the one in Columbus. And I called two other ones. None of them have newspapers for that four month period.”\n\n“That is strange,” Milo finally said.\n\n“I’ve got an appointment in Wheeling, West Virginia tomorrow,” she said. “At the Jesuit college, there.”\n\nThere was a long pause before Milo responded. “Remember the bulldozer. Don’t get too worked up when you might well find out there’s a simple explanation for this. Probably is.”\n\n“I know,” she said. “But I want to know what it is.”\n\nAfter she hung up, she texted Joan. Joan’s mother lived in Columbus. Joan agreed to sneak out for coffee. When she got to the coffee shop, Sue Ellen could see Joan had been crying.\n\n“She called me a whore of Babylon,” Joan said. She laughed, but not with her eyes.\n\n“That’s absurd,” Sue Ellen said. “You’ve never even been to Babylon.”\n\nJoan didn’t acknowledge the joke. “John Von Impe, this televangelist she watches all the time, said homosexuality is a sin, so now I’m the whore of Babylon because I went to the prom with my girlfriend. She’s been calling me. I didn’t tell you about it because you’re busy and everything. But she’s been calling me and proselytizing and everything.”\n\nSue Ellen took Joan’s hand. “She’s sick. You know this.”\n\n“I know,” Joan said.\n\n“You can’t let her get to you.”\n\nJoan nodded.\n\n“What can I do?” Sue Ellen said.\n\nJoan turned bloodshot eyes to Sue Ellen. “Come home.”\n\nSue Ellen stared at her and didn’t answer.\n\n***\n\nThe next morning, she left the hotel room she and Joan had rented and hit the library as soon as it was open. She made a note to keep her phone on in case Joan called, but she got so involved in the research, she forgot about it.\n\nShe called Milo late that afternoon, but he didn’t answer. “I’ve found it,” she said to his voice mail. “Get this: The Wheeling Gazette has a series of stories referencing a riot in Brown County, Ohio. They blame it on an unnamed man, an African American, a sharecropper, who supposedly attacked and killed the owner of the tobacco farm he worked for. You have to read between the lines, but the black guy was shot, along with his family, who were hiding him, and then some kind of riot broke out, apparently. The rioters were tried and a bunch of them executed. That’s who we’ve found, Milo! The rioters, but it’s way more than the newspapers reported.”\n\nShe’d had to turn her phone back on to call Milo, and after she left the message, a voice mail came through from Joan. Her voice was frantic. Sue Ellen could hear tears, which scared her more than anything Joan could say. Joan’s mother was definitely off her meds. She’d disappeared and left a note threatening violence against several people, apparently. Sue Ellen called Joan, but she didn’t answer. She drove over to Joan’s mother’s house, but no one answered the door. She drove back to the hotel and waited.\n\nSue Ellen decided she should watch the news in case there was a story about Joan’s mom. She waited through the opening story about politics, the sports, and weather, until the newscaster got to the local news.\n\nThere was a story about a dog that stayed with its mate for sixteen hours after the mate died, which was sad and kind of beautiful, but not what Sue Ellen was looking for. They went to commercial, and she tried calling Joan again. She didn’t answer, and the news came back on. All that was left was the last couple minutes before primetime started. They usually put quirky, little stories there.\n\n“Construction workers at the site of a new Wal-Mart Supercenter in White Burling made an unusual discovery recently, when they found the remains of a pauper cemetery from the Great Depression. But the discovery has stirred controversy in this idyllic town.”\n\nThere was footage of the site and an interview with a protestor. Sue Ellen felt her jaw literally drop, and her phone rang. It was Joan. She answered, and Joan wasn’t crying or injured-sounding. Sue Ellen thanked whatever deity might be listening.\n\n“Hey, sorry,” Joan said. “I’ve been trying to find mom. She ran off.”\n\nOn TV, Milo was being interviewed about his theory that the grave site was a pauper cemetery. “Because of the poor record keeping,” he said. “It would be nearly impossible to find the families of the deceased.”\n\n“Hello?” Joan said.\n\n“Hey…” Sue Ellen forced herself to focus on Joan. “Are you okay? Is your mom okay?”\n\nJoan laughed. “Yeah, I’m just tired.” She continued, but Sue Ellen was only half listening. The news report went back to the anchorwoman who said something about Wal-Mart agreeing to pay to relocate the remains to the site of another pauper cemetery.\n\n“They’re nice folks at Wal-Mart,” she said.\n\nSue Ellen was stunned but she also remembered that Joan was telling the story of her day. Her mother, apparently, had attempted to attack the manager of a bookstore that sold adult magazines.\n\n“They were going to let her out tomorrow morning on bail.”\n\n“She’s in jail?” Sue Ellen said.\n\n“She stabbed the guy with a chopstick!” Joan said. “So I had to get the lawyer to convince them she needed psychiatric observation, which really shouldn’t have been that hard. Money, you know?”\n\n“Yeah,” Sue Ellen said, her mind still racing from the news report. “So is he okay?”\n\n“Yeah. He was already released from the hospital. He even said he didn’t want to press charges, when he found out her condition. But that would’ve meant they let her out even sooner.”\n\n“Listen, where are you?” Sue Ellen asked.\n\n“I’m at the courthouse.” Joan laughed. It was close to becoming something more.\n\n“I’ll come get you. You’ll stay with me tonight.”\n\nJoan didn’t argue. “We can eat fastfood if you want.”\n\n“Are you kidding?” Sue Ellen said. “That stuff tastes like crap.”\n\nJoan laughed.\n\nAs soon as she hung up with Joan, Sue Ellen called Milo. He answered as she got out to her car.\n\n“I saw the news,” was all she could think to say.\n\n“They say the camera adds forty pounds.” Milo chuckled.\n\n“Did you get my message? I don’t think it’s a pauper cemetery, Milo.”\n\nHe sighed. “I know.”\n\nShe waited for him to elaborate while she typed the courthouse address into her GPS.\n\n“I know you have a theory,” Milo continued, picking his words carefully. “And it’s a very attractive theory. But we don’t have any evidence, do we?”\n\n“What do you mean?” Sue Ellen slammed on the brakes to keep from running a red light and cursed. “I’ve got newspaper reports from six different papers saying there was a race riot.”\n\n“Okay,” Milo said. “Do any of them mention where the bodies were buried? Do they even give the number of victims?”\n\n“They’re all whitewashed; you have to read between the lines. There was a riot.”\n\n“How many victims do they mention?”\n\n“It doesn’t matter!” She screamed.\n\n“And do they give the location of a cemetery? Do they even say there was a cemetery?” Milo continued, ignoring her outburst.\n\nShe turned into the parking lot behind the courthouse. “I don’t get it,” she said. “You know—you have to know there’s something going on here. This is bigger than a pauper cemetery.”\n\n“It’s over,” he said.\n\nJoan waved and moved toward the car. Sue Ellen hung up and put her head to the wheel.\n\n***\n\nIt was a few days before Sue Ellen could bring herself to return to White Burley. Joan came along for moral support and managed not to complain the whole way, though Sue Ellen hardly noticed. When they got to the site, the portable buildings were gone. There were crews of men with backhoes dumping dirt and bones into trucks. Sue Ellen felt Joan’s hand on hers and realized she was crying.\n\nMilo answered his phone on the first ring.\n\n“Where are you?” Sue Ellen asked. “Have you seen what they’re doing?”\n\nMilo paused before answering. “You should go home. You did a great job, but it’s over.” He sounded tired, defeated, even. It made Sue Ellen soften her tone.\n\n“It’s not over,” she said.\n\n“I’ve already written you a recommendation and sent it to your department head and advisor.”\n\nSue Ellen didn’t know what to say to that, but she wasn’t about to say thank you.\n\n“I’m going to talk to the media,” Sue Ellen said. “And to the mayor and to anyone I can.”\n\nMilo sighed. “Do what you have to do, but don’t ruin your career over this before it’s even started. This isn’t a fight we can win, Sue Ellen.”\n\nIt struck her that he’d said “we.”\n\n“You’re not even trying,” she said. “What, did Wal-Mart pay you off?” She felt like an idiot for saying it, but it was out there.\n\n“Who do you think paid for the equipment we used, for the research we did? Wal-Mart. Now they’re paying to move the bodies.”\n\n“But they can’t move them! We have to study them! We have to find out the truth!”\n\nMilo sighed again. “I’m sorry this happened,” he said. “The truth is, we don’t have enough evidence to go any further with this.”\n\nWhen she got off the phone, she called the mayor’s office to make an appointment, then she called the Brown County Citizen.\n\n***\n\nSue Ellen met with her advisor a few days later, this time in his office, at her insistence. She felt older, haggard. None of the newspapers she’d contacted would run the story. The mayor had agreed to meet with her but cancelled at the last minute. She’d contacted Wal-Mart several times and gotten nowhere.\n\nDr. Yeager was on the phone when she knocked. He waved her in, and she sat down. A moment later, he hung up the phone. “Buddy of mine is looking for a couple interns for the summer to work on a dig with him. He was really excited by the rec. I forwarded from that White Burley thing. How do you feel about Peru?”\n\nHe grinned, and Sue Ellen couldn’t even answer. Afterwards, back in her car, she started to text Joan but ended up throwing her phone into the passenger seat. She wanted to punch the steering wheel or maybe drive the car into the building. She’d written several letters to the editors of newspapers all over the country, and now she was thinking of writing her theory up and maybe trying to get it published somewhere, anywhere, really. Maybe even just put it on a blog or something. Then people would think she was a kook. The phone rang. It was Joan.\n\n“How’d it go?” Joan asked.\n\nSue Ellen started crying. She hated it, she hated herself for it, but she couldn’t stop. “I’m going to Peru,” she managed.\n\n“Honey,” Joan said. “Come home.”\n\nC.L. Bledsoe’s most recent book is Riceland, a poetry collection. He currently lives in Maryland with his wife, the poet Jillian Meyer, and their daughter.\n\nQ&A\n\nQ: What was the inspiration for this story?\n\nA: I’ve been reading a lot about racial violence, which led me to write this story. There’s a prevailing attitude that race riots either have been exaggerated or didn’t happen, or that they happened so long ago they don’t matter. I wanted to address the idea that these things happened and are still relevant.\n\nQ: What does your writing space look like?\n\nA: I write wherever and whenever I can: at work during lunch breaks, in the evenings at home, or wherever I happen to be. My writing space is essentially my laptop and wherever I can plug it in.\n\nQ: What’s your writing process?\n\nA: It differs from piece to piece. I’ve sat on stories for years trying to get them right. Others, I’ve typed out in one sitting. I think you have to be flexible. If you can only write under optimal circumstances, you aren’t going to get much done. One thing I do that’s different from some other writers is I edit as I write, even if that means going back and reworking a significant portion of a piece before moving forward. I’ve found this to be more time effective.\n\nQ: What living writer do you admire most and why? Is there a particular book you refer to again and again?\n\nA: I really enjoy Terry Pratchett. He writes fantasy parodies. He’s incredibly talented and funny. That’s who I read for fun. I’m currently reading Etgar Keret, who is a somewhat Kafka-esque flash-fiction writer. Most of my favorite writers are dead. Donald Harington. Italo Calvino. Laurence Sterne.\n\nQ: What are you working on now?\n\nA: This story is part of a series of stories about racial violence, something like a left-leaning Turner Diaries. I’m working on the last story in the series, along with a novel about a private boarding school.\n\n. Maureen\n\nI was Owen McAllister’s secretary, not his wife. The fact that I loved him didn’t change that. The fact that he already had a wife—an inappropriate, stupid wife, but still a legal spouse––made it even worse. But one morning in October 1950 I walked into Owen’s office and found him alone and weeping at his desk. That didn’t change anything either, but it was a start.\n\nI went in and locked the door. He glanced at me as I came around his desk to stand beside him. Owen was the chairman of the Department of Geology, Fremont College, Xenia, Ohio. Apart from a handshake on the day he interviewed me fourteen months ago, I had never touched him. Now, with a sheaf of correspondence clutched in one hand, I rested my other hand on his shoulder. “Owen?”\n\nHe had asked me months before to call him by his Christian name––an endearing request––and even then I was falling in love with him. Falling in love with his brilliant mind and his pure white hair and his thick shoulders under his Harris tweed jackets and his courtly way of speaking to me. Maureen, would this be a good time to take a letter? Maureen, could I trouble you to take my hat to the cleaners? I had never had such a considerate boss.\n\n“Owen, what is it?” I studied his white collar where it pressed into the pink flesh of his neck. That Owen was a man of strong emotions, I had no doubt. But the energy that emanated from his six-foot frame was typically channeled into his workload: the textbook he was writing––Geology for Engineers––with its bold-ink and nearly illegible pages transcribed by me on a new Underwood typewriter; the talks he gave, in his beautiful baritone, at seminars and conferences; the students and scientists he trained. I supposed some of that energy was also channeled toward his shallow wife, Jeanette, but she never seemed to notice.\n\n“Forgive me.” He took a white handkerchief from his jacket pocket. “I’m an old fool.” Owen often called himself “old,” laughing ruefully when he said it, but he was only fifty. I was thirty-five. I wasn’t certain of his wife Jeanette’s age. She was always cleverly made up and costumed and coifed in order to look practically twenty or twenty-one, but I imagined she was close to thirty.\n\n“Owen, how can I help you?” I took dictation at 130 words per minute, typed at 100, maintained a Variadex file system in perfect order, kept his calendar, answered his telephone, and arranged his travel. But I was prepared to go well beyond the boundaries of my job to help Owen.\n\n“It’s Jeanette,” he said, wiping his eyes.\n\n“Is she ill?” I knew she wasn’t. I had seen her the day before when she breezed past my desk in a brown velvet hat with a veil, deigning to say Hello, Maureen, trailing Tabu and condescension as she pushed into Owen’s office. They had been married for three years. I imagined the marriage had allowed Jeanette to hurdle several social strata in one leap––away from the shop-girl, Midnight-In-Paris, cut-on-the-bias existence she seemed to spring from and into the faculty-tea, DeSoto-and-fur-coat life she currently enjoyed. I saw her as a fake, a rhinestone ring in a Tiffany box.\n\n“No, not ill.” Owen straightened his back, tucked the handkerchief away and reached for the stack of correspondence, which I had placed on his desk. He seemed prepared to continue with the morning’s tasks, but, just as suddenly, a fresh wave of sobs overcame him. I was still standing next to his chair, and he clasped me about the waist and pressed his face into the placket of my freshly ironed pin-tucked blouse. I had dreamt of his embrace, but never in circumstances such as these. “She’s…Jeanette’s… different,” he said, and I felt his moist breath where it penetrated the pin-tucks and warmed my skin. “I fear I may be losing her.”\n\nThese words produced a storm in my heart and an image in my mind of walking with Owen under the cliffs at Scourie in Scotland where he had done so much research. How many times had I typed the details of the famous rock formations along that coast? Like a schoolgirl, I had often imagined myself there with him.\n\n“Please let me help you.” I put my hands on his beautiful white hair and cradled his head beneath my breasts.\n\nThe doorknob rattled. Then a sharp knock. I had forgotten the door was locked, but thank God it was. We drew apart, startled and staring at one another. Again, Owen pulled out the handkerchief and wiped his eyes. He smiled weakly and motioned for me to open the door.\n\nIt was Philip Carstetter, the new professor in Chemical Engineering who was contributing some material to Owen’s book. He did not have an appointment, but then he never did. He clumped in with his cane. “Locked doors?” he said, laughing. “What’s going on?” He held a cloth-bound book in one hand and steadied all his weight against his stick with the other.\n\nHe was ten years younger than Owen, but he had smashed up his leg in the war. He was a bombardier and his plane crash-landed on a mission over North Africa. I felt he quite overplayed the part of the world-weary hero, with his unruly black Irish hair always pushed to one side of his forehead and his tie askew and his suits rumpled.\n\n“What have you got for me?” Owen said. After sobbing into my midsection moments earlier, he managed to revert rather admirably to his grand-professor voice.\n\nPhilip Carstetter held the book aloft, a preacher waving a Bible. “Calcination!” he called out. “Cement! Limestone!”\n\n“Excellent.” Owen rubbed his hands together and reached for the book. “You are a life-saver, Carstetter.”\n\nI left them and returned to my desk and the afternoon’s tasks.\n\n2. Philip Carstetter\n\nMaybe I thrive on anger, maybe that’s it. All I know is when a woman makes me mad I tend to fall in love with her. And Jeanette McAllister made me furious. I met her last summer when I first got to this jerkwater campus. Owen hosted an endless, bottomless, worthless weekend forum for a geologist visiting from Germany. A real blowhard. I didn’t hesitate to tell him I knew his people well: they shot my ship out from under me seven years ago, and I’d like to thank Rommel and his pals personally for this. I stabbed my cane in his direction. That meant I didn’t have to speak with the German geologist for the next two days.\n\nBut Jeanette. Jeanette was a different story. She sashayed up to me at the drinks party and stuck her hand out and said, “Hi, I’m Jeanette, the tramp who landed Owen McAllister. Who the hell are you?”\n\nShe always looked soft. She always wore fur and cashmere and pale wool, and underneath, silk and satin––yes, I finally did get underneath all the layers––but Jeanette was really tempered steel. She knew what she wanted and she went out and got it. That made me furious, which, as I said, made me love her. It was either love or something more violent. Can love be violent? Maybe the war screwed me up. What the hell, I liked pretending the world owed me something because my leg was shattered and I spent twelve days in a tent in Tripoli where they were short on morphine and long on flies. But I came through it; I even stopped minding the cane when I saw how women were drawn to it.\n\nNot that things clicked right away with Jeanette. She always said: “I’m a gold digger, Phil, but I’m a faithful gold digger.” She didn’t really want to fool around or get involved or leave Owen. She said, “You know what you need? You need a girl.” She offered to find me one.\n\nThe quacks at the VA told me to practice walking without the cane. I didn’t want to practice anything. I didn’t want to teach my damn classes with all those entitled pretty boys sitting there twiddling their thumbs. I didn’t want to find a nice girl and settle down. I wanted to grab Jeanette and run off somewhere and do loving, violent things to her and to hell with everybody else.\n\n3. Maureen\n\nI needed my job not only for myself. My mother lived with me and depended upon me utterly. That evening, the evening after Owen embraced me and wept, I watched Mother pick the pearl onions one by one out of her creamed peas with the concentration of a jeweler sorting gems. Her iron-gray hair was set in curlers so tightly rolled that a ridge of skin puckered whitely across the top of her forehead. Her patience seemed as stretched as her scalp. She looked up from the peas and demanded, “What exactly is it you want, Maureen?”\n\nI assumed this was a continuation of the only conversation we ever really had. She did not care what I wanted. Her real questions were: What will happen to me? And Why don’t we have more? More money, more furniture, more appliances, more security for her old age.\n\nShe had been as thrilled as I when I accepted the job with Owen. My previous job had been in a steno pool where I was surrounded by girls who made fun of me behind my back but were friendly enough when they needed me––Maureen, could you change this typewriter ribbon? Maureen, could you decipher my shorthand? Maureen, could you spell Philadelphia? Their letters were misfiled, their tab keys were jammed, and their erasures left holes. One Friday, without notice, I quit. My only satisfaction was the panic and chaos I imagined in the wake of my departure. Mother did not partake of my triumph. “What if we starve?” she had asked.\n\nFather left when I was twelve. I grew up with Mother telling me I was plain, I was pathetic, I was not marriage material and I should have something to fall back on. So I completed a two-year course at Hartley School for the Secretary and worked my way with no help from anyone through file clerk and steno pool jobs to the position of Personal Secretary to Professor and Departmental Chairman Owen McAllister. Still, Mother wanted more.\n\nNow, after years of not-marriage-material talk, she had begun to imply I should be landing a husband. She had even hinted that I should try to get Owen away from Jeanette. It troubled me that her venal wishes should somehow coincide with the secret dreams I had about Owen––dreams I had no intention of acting upon until that day, when his tearful confessions made me think there was a chance. Was Jeanette having an affair? Could I prove it to Owen? End his agony, after which he would turn to me? Owen would be traveling to Chicago that weekend. Perhaps I could visit Jeanette and learn something further.\n\n4. Jeanette McAllister\n\nPhilip was with me that evening, the evening Maureen showed up pretending to be “on her way to a dinner engagement.” She looked pathetic. A melted green Hubbard squash of a hat and a silly cloth coat the color of spoiled chocolate pudding. She announced quite loudly that she had promised Owen she would “drop off some pages.” That meant typed pages for his book––the endless, unreadable book he worked on––and it was true, she had brought typed drafts to our home before. Now she brandished a brown envelope as if it contained vital wartime secrets. “I told him I would bring this by,” she chirped.\n\nI felt certain she had some ulterior motive––bringing pages on a Saturday evening?––and I was intrigued. Was she spying on me? I decided to give her an eyeful and invited her in.\n\n“You know Philip, of course,” I said.\n\nWhen Maureen discovered Philip Carstetter standing by our fireplace with a scotch and soda in his hand, she turned as gray as her ugly pocketbook. I pressed her to stay for a drink. “Owen is in Chicago,” I said. “But then you knew that.”\n\n“Yes.” Maureen tried to sit down, remove her coat, remove her gloves, and hold onto her envelope and pocketbook all at the same time. “But,” she added, “you know how Owen is about his pages.”\n\n“No,” I said. “How is Owen about his pages?” I put a scotch and water in front of her on the coffee table.\n\n“I thought he might want this for Sunday night.” Maureen held the envelope in her lap. “When he returns.” She had just gotten everything settled and taken a sip of her drink when she looked at her watch and said, “I’m almost late for my dinner engagement.”\n\nI lit a cigarette. “Who is your dinner date?” I asked, all curiosity.\n\n“Just a friend.” The scotch was making her neck flush.\n\nI leaned in. “A new beau?”\n\nMaureen put her glass down. She began to reverse the process, gathering up her gloves and pocketbook. “I’m a trifle old for a new beau, don’t you think?”\n\n“One is never too old to fall in love,” I said. “Don’t you agree, Philip?”\n\nPhillip looked annoyed. When Maureen had rung the doorbell, Philip had been about to kiss me. We had kissed perhaps three times before that night––furtive kisses in a hallway or a taxicab––but Philip managed more passion in one kiss than poor Owen had mustered in three years. Philip drained his glass. “That is true,” he said, warming to my game. “Love can strike at any age. But Maureen is perhaps more dedicated to her work.”\n\n“Oh, Maureen’s a professional little gatekeeper all right,” I said. “Sometimes I can’t see Owen myself unless I have the proper hall pass.”\n\nPhilip leaned on his cane with one hand and poured fresh scotch with the other. “Owen and Maureen had their heads together behind locked doors the other day,” he added.\n\nLocked doors? I hadn’t heard about that one, but it was useful information. “That’s because Maureen loves my husband,” I said.\n\nPhilip pretended to ponder the idea. “No, Jeanette, I believe Maureen loves her Underwood typewriter. I’ve watched her hands on the keys and it’s true love.”\n\nMaureen stood up. “I’ll be late if I don’t leave now.” Her lips were so white that I knew we had gone too far but I couldn’t resist one last question. “So which is it, Maureen? Owen or the Underwood?”\n\n“I’m sorry I interrupted your evening.” She picked up her coat and the envelope and started for the door.\n\n“Aren’t you going to leave that?” I pointed at the envelope.\n\nShe thrust it toward me and I took it.\n\nWhen she left, Philip let his cane clatter to the parquet floor and grabbed me by both arms. I looked into his eyes and tried to understand what I saw there, in that mix of fury and love. I tried to understand why women fall for a man with a limp. Is it the feeling that a flaw makes a man more a woman’s equal?\n\nPhilip and I were already equal. Our backgrounds were the same. No money, hopeless parents, trash jobs. But Philip had gotten scholarships and an education. He joined up right after Pearl Harbor even though he was almost too old and was in graduate school, doing vital work. When he came back from North Africa, he wrote some doozy of a dissertation on the Hydraulicity of Limestone and got himself a professorship. All this, while I was sewing my own black cocktail dresses at the YWCA, buying fake pearls, and crashing parties where I could meet well-heeled men. Men like Owen McAllister. And I had gotten what I wanted. A husband who had money, a career, a pension, and no wandering eye. Then Philip showed up.\n\n5. Maureen\n\nMonday morning as I took the cover off the Underwood, my stomach still roiled over Jeanette and Philip and the events of Saturday night. Everything about me––my livelihood, my professionalism, my respect for Owen––was hilarious to them.\n\nI rolled in a piece of stationery and began typing Owen’s agenda for the day. But the ribbon was worn, so I took a fresh one from my bottom desk drawer and bent over the gleaming, black Underwood thinking it was true, I loved it, how solid it felt. I wheeled the old ribbon to one side and took the spools off.\n\nMaybe they would stop laughing when I told Owen that his fears were well grounded and the interloper was his trusted colleague Philip Carstetter. Maybe that would silence them. I loosened the ribbon-leader from the new spool.\n\nAt that moment Owen arrived, still in his hat and coat. He was carrying the envelope, which I recognized at once.\n\n“Very kind of you,” he said, holding it up. “Not necessary, but thank you.”\n\n“I thought you might like to see it.” I could feel my face grow hot.\n\nHe took off his hat and hooked it on the coat tree. “Jeanette tells me you have a new beau.”\n\nI was confused. Then I remembered Jeanette’s insistence that I had some sort of romantic date, even though I had denied it clearly enough.\n\n“Philip Carstetter was there,” I blurted. “With Jeanette.”\n\nOwen unbuttoned his coat. “She mentioned it.” He pressed his lips together as if to keep from saying more.\n\nOf course Jeanette would mention it. She wouldn’t wait for me to tell him. What a fool I was. I had no proof of anything. I tried to hook the end of the new ribbon into the slot on the empty spool, a task I had performed a hundred times, but my hands were shaking and I could not do it.\n\nOwen watched me. “Maureen, are you all right?”\n\nI was smearing my hands with ribbon ink, something I usually managed to avoid. Then the new, full spool slipped from my fingers, dropped to my desk, rolled off and across the pine floor, unraveling yards of thin black ribbon as it went. I fell to my knees to gather it. Owen knelt across from me, trying to help.\n\n“No, I can do it.” My voice came out in a furious cry, shocking me. I scooped ribbon with both hands, blackening them. “I can do it,” I said again. I was weeping, but dared not put my soiled hands to my face. I must have looked an utter fright, kneeling there with my face wet and my hands black, trying to control my twisting mouth.\n\n“Maureen.” Owen put his hands on my shoulders. The beautiful weight of his warm hands. “What is it?”\n\n“Don’t you understand?” I said. “Philip was there. You were right. You were right about Jeanette.”\n\nHe let go. For a wild moment I wanted to grab his hands and put them back on my shoulders. But my hands were full of typewriter ribbon and grimy with ink. Owen stood up.\n\n“Let us not speak of Philip Carstetter,” he said. “All right?” He took his coat off and went to the coat tree and hung it up. He walked into his office and closed the door. I found the empty spool and began slowly winding the ribbon back on. It twisted about hopelessly. I would have to throw away a perfectly good, unused ribbon.\n\n6. Owen McAllister\n\nWork on the book has been slow going. The publisher sends letters quizzing me as if I were a grad student begging for thesis approval. Why isn’t there more on the magnesium and titanium compounds in clay? Aren’t most industries changing their requirements for siliceous materials in fireclay? What is the future of lime concrete?\n\nI’m not in the business of predicting the future. If that makes me a throwback, then so be it. My doddering-codger status is already well known. Indeed, it provoked tittering behind my back when I married Jeanette three years ago. People find it amusing enough when a life-long bachelor decides to marry––as if he won’t be capable of making coffee for two or will blanch at the sight of ladies’ panties on the bathroom doorknob or, worse, won’t know that they are ladies’ panties––but they find it even more amusing when his bride is as young and vibrant as Jeanette.\n\nPeople don’t understand that a man falls in love with what he does not possess. Jeanette is bold. Impetuous. That is why I love her. Why would I want someone as reticent and plodding as I? I have feared losing her from the day we married, and perhaps now it is coming to pass.\n\nPhilip Carstetter. I liked the man straight off, and he has been a godsend on the book. Extensive fieldwork with limestone. Much more practical experience with engineering applications, including the nitpicky siliceous materials the publisher natters on about. And Philip offered up his research and papers and books and experience to me, claiming he wanted only simple attribution. Now I must ask myself: was this because of Jeanette? Jeanette says no. Jeanette claims she is helping Philip “find a wife.” Now this––Maureen almost hysterical. Jeanette says Maureen is in love with me, but that is preposterous.\n\n7. Philip Carstetter\n\nThat day we met––at the forum for the blowhard German––Jeanette stared at my cane, pointed, and said, “What happened to you?” I gave her the bullshit story about crash landing, but later, the first time she came up to my place, I told her the truth. I had never confessed it to anyone.\n\nShe didn’t care that my apartment was at the end of a bus line where all the drunks got off and wove their way down the sidewalk, asking for nickels and trailing their shoelaces. She did say, “Phil, on your salary? You don’t have to live here. Why do you?”\n\n“I like the neighbors,” I said. She laughed. She laughed a lot, but she still wouldn’t sleep with me, at least not that night. Not for months.\n\nBut that night I told her. Yes, I was in North Africa and yes, I was a bombardier on B-25s, but no, I did not receive my wound in a “crash landing.” I would have if I hadn’t been the only coward to bail out of a plane that did crash land. Everybody survived, thanks to the show-off, Princeton-grad of a pilot, who took the ship down in the desert without any landing gear. My chute opened fine, but I came in crooked and lay cringing like the coward I was for 36 hours in the dirt with a shattered leg before the search party found me.\n\nJeanette had a drink in her hand and her bare feet on my footstool and she put her head back and laughed that sexy laugh again and said, “Hell, I would’ve been right behind you.” She didn’t care what anybody thought. She said, “As long as we’re confessing secrets…” and lit a cigarette.\n\nShe told me she had, more than once, done it for money. “That’s how desperate I was,” she said, and in two seconds she went from laughing to crying. “My mother and dad had kicked me out,” she said. “What was I going to do? I was seventeen. I was nothing. I never told Owen.”\n\nSo––Jeanette and I––we knew all about each other.\n\n8. Owen McAllister\n\nMaureen fought and won all the battles with the publisher. She pushed everything through. She edited manuscripts until two a.m. sometimes. She arranged the contracts. She arranged the speaking engagements. She protected me from petty details. She saved the book and I suppose she saved me. Swooping in when Jeanette left, making me eat the vile soup her mother had made, fluffing my pillows (I was ill for a while), washing my underwear and cutting my hair. Certainly Jeanette never would have done what Maureen did.\n\nWe are on the SS America bound for Scourie on our honeymoon. Maureen claimed she wanted to see it ever since she read my description of the famous gneiss outcroppings on the Scottish coast. I can’t imagine Jeanette ever being interested in Precambrian rocks, or any rocks. She used to joke that diamonds were the rocks she liked. I suppose it is a good thing for a man’s wife to take an interest in his work.\n\nMaureen’s mother will live with us. I feared she would want to come to Scotland too, but no. She was overjoyed to stay in my house and boss the maid about. Jeanette and Carstetter are in that ridiculous apartment of his. And he left the university. Maybe they are happy.\n\n9. Maureen McAllister\n\nThe sky here is pearl-gray-blue and close, misted with sea spray and the warm damp of the Gulf Stream. When you love someone, you notice things like the color of the sky. You notice every sea-softened, egg-sized rock on the beach and every slate-roofed cottage with its black-framed windows. You even do foolish things like go in the Scourie village kirk and say a prayer of thanks.\n\nPebbled pathways have taken us up and down this part of the coast. From the higher vantage points we view all the little sea lochs, ringed with islands that look like sleeping beasts in the low-lying water. The islands and headlands are gray rock––this is the famous gneiss––that looks ancient and gnarled and pockmarked wherever green moss or black lichen does not fur the surface. At dusk, sky and rock merge into a single shade of cinder gray; hardness and softness becoming one ghost-like disappearance, something humans are not meant to decipher.\n\nThe gneiss in many places, as Owen is quick to point out, is thrust through with igneous rock in vertical pinkish slabs. Owen enjoys going on about the quartz-dolerite extruding itself into the much-harder Lewisian gneiss, but I prefer simply contemplating the vastness of time. Some of the outcroppings here match up with formations in Canada, showing that the two coastlines were once joined. To think that now the Atlantic Ocean stretches in all its restiveness north and west from here to North America in one blue-gray unbroken expanse.\n\nToday we are walking a path that takes us close to the beach and the lapping water. Owen strides ahead of me, carrying a furled umbrella and a waterproof notebook. He keeps his head down and his shoulders hunched against the damp. I must remind him constantly to unhunch his shoulders. I carry my guidebook, noting plants and outcroppings as we go. The headland in front of us is Craig a’Mhail. Near my feet, slippery shore rock is wrapped in bladder wrack. I feel wrapped myself, enclosed in this landscape that seems at once welcoming and primeval, familiar and forbidding. A place where the very earth is breathing deeply, keeping its counsel, and speaking to me of endurance.\n\nAndrea Lewis writes short stories and essays from her home on Vashon Island, Washington.
