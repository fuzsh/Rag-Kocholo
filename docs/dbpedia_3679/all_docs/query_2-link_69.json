        "text": "The Feud\n\nPhil is upset to have lost his elected office of social chair to his nemesis Gil Thorpe, and when he finds out Luke is competing against Gilâs kid in a wrestling match, it becomes his own personal battle. Claire is nervous for a big client meeting but things get extra hairy when Mitch and Cam ask her to pick up Lily from school and conveniently leave out the fact that her class just had a lice scare. Elsewhere, Gloria chaperones Mannyâs school field trip to the museum.\n\nBoca\n\nUncle Junior enjoys a romantic tryst in Boca with his girlfriend Bobbi, not realizing that she's been gabbing to her beauty-parlor friends about his oral talents. Meanwhile, controversy arises when Meadow's soccer coach announces he's leaving the school.\n\nNobody Knows Anything\n\nAfter Jimmy and Pussy are arrested in an FBI raid, Makazian tells a stunned Tony that Pussy may be wired for the Feds. Tony sends Paulie to find out for sure. Later, Tony learns that Makazian might be trying to frame Pussy to get out of his gambling debts."
