He lives in Brighton with his wife and four sons.\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nMcAllister began directing in television in the early 1990s, on series like Gamesmaster and Brookside. Towards the end of the decade, he transitioned into writing. In 2001, USA Network bought the rights to Daylight Robbery, commissioning an eight-part remake, with McAllister acting as a consultant producer. However, the remake was unexpectedly cancelled mid-production, and did not make it to air.[1] He has since written for Hollyoaks Later (As the title suggests, the late night spinoff allowed for more sexual content, 'edgier' storylines and stronger language than the main series), Mile High, Spooks: Code 9, Holby City, Emmerdale and in 2009 co-wrote an episode of New Tricks. From 2009 to 2017, McAllister worked as a core writer on soap opera Emmerdale. He transitioned onto fellow ITV soap opera Coronation Street that same year.\n\nHe has also written two novels, The Tin Snail and The Demon Undertaker.[2]\n\nWriting credits[edit]\n\nProduction Notes Broadcaster Daylight Robbery\n\nCo-creator (1999-2000)\n\nITV Mile High\n\n(2005)\n\nSky One Spooks: Code 9\n\nEpisode 1.5 (2008)\n\nBBC One Crusoe\n\nHeroes and Villains (2008)\n\nNBC Primeval\n\nEpisode 2.4 (2008)\n\nEpisode 3.8 (2009)\n\nITV New Tricks\n\nBlood is Thicker Than Water (2009)\n\nBBC One Holby City\n\nThe Cost of Loving (2009)\n\nBBC One Hollyoaks Later\n\n1 episodes (2009)\n\nChannel 4 Emmerdale\n\n103 episodes (2009-2017)\n\nITV Coronation Street\n\n(2017 - present)\n\nITV\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial Website\n\nCameron McAllister on IMDb\n\nCameron McAllister at TV.com"
