        "text": "A sighting of a strange creature occurs on the outskirts of the Forest of Dean, leading a small team of scientists and government officials to investigate it. They find a Scutosaurus in the forest and discover a time anomaly that leads to the late Permian period, 250 million years ago. The team soon realize that a Gorgonopsid also came through and they must find it before it kills anyone.\n\nAfter a London Underground cleaner is fatally bitten by some type of giant bug, James Lester brings the team together to investigate. They find another anomaly that leads to the late Carboniferous, and a colony of giant spiders that have come through. Using powerful lights to send the spiders back, the team are then attacked by the true killer.\n\nA man at a local swimming pool is killed by a Cretaceous Mosasaur when an anomaly appears there. But when the anomaly disappears and reopens several miles away in a reservoir, Cutter realizes that the anomalies have the ability to move, and his theory is confirmed when the anomaly opens for a third time in a residential basement.\n\nHelen escapes from custody at the Home Office by taking the team to an anomaly that unleashes a flock of dodos. These dodos are carrying deadly parasites capable of infecting humans. Unknown to the team, Connor's friends Tom and Duncan capture one, but when Tom is infected by the parasite and goes on the rampage, Cutter and the team must find him before they have a pandemic on their hands.\n\nA Pteranodon turns up at a golf course, and a golfer is killed. Cutter and his team go to investigate and find the anomaly up in the air. The team track the flying reptile down to send it back to its time, but Cutter and Claudia become trapped in a mansion by a flock of bloodthirsty Anurognathus. As Cutter goes to get help, Claudia finds salvation in the unlikely hands of Helen Cutter."
