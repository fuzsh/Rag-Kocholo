        "text": "Episode 5.6\n\nby Steve Bailie\n\nand Adrian Hodges\n\nPulled into the New Dawn anomaly, Connor is transported into the future, to a barren desert world plagued by intense heat and toxic sandstorms, and populated only by hideously mutated future predators. Back at the Prospero complex, Philip is overjoyed at the apparent success of his and Connors work  until the anomaly begins to destabilise, sending shockwaves throughout the building. Matt escapes from his guards and re-joins Abby and Emily; learning of Connors disappearance, he follows his friend into the portal and finds himself back in the future he has striven so hard to prevent; luckily for Matt, Connor is lying nearby, now suffering from the effects of the extreme climate. As Matt leads Connor back to the anomaly they are confronted by three future predators; but as the vicious creatures fight over their prey, Abby arrives on the scene and holds them at bay. Familiar with the territory, Matt leads Abby and Connor into an underground bolthole, where they find provisions to help Connor. Back at New Dawn, Emily is captured and locked up. With the anomaly continuing to expand, the base begins to break apart and the sky begins to churn and boil; as the base personnel abandon Philip and flee for their lives, a massive EMP erupts from the portal and blasts across the whole of London, disabling all electrical systems across the city. At the A.R.C., in Connors lab, the systems controlling the mini-anomaly shut down  and the portal reopens. Meanwhile, Jess brings the A.D. back online with emergency power, and then informs Lester that with everyone out in the field, they are the only ones left in the A.R.C.  they are unaware that a pack of future predators has come through Connors anomaly, and are now at large in the base In the future, Matt, Abby and Connor manage to evade the predators and return through the anomaly; horrified at the sight of the massive anomaly now consuming the base, the trio then find Philip, now all-too painfully aware of the repercussions of being exploited by Helen Cutter. Finally taking responsibility for his actions, Philip orders the A.R.C. team to safety while he remains behind to activate the bases self-destruct systems. Pausing only to rescue Emily, Matt, Abby and Connor race outside and watch as the base and the anomaly machine explode; but Philip was too late: the anomaly has become too powerful, and as it continues to grow to colossal size, it looks like nothing can prevent the coming apocalypse\n\nCiarán McMenamin (Matt Anderson), Andrew-Lee Potts (Connor Temple), Hannah Spearritt (Abby Maitland), Ben Miller (James Peregrine Lester), Alexander Siddig (Philip Burton), Ben Mansfield (Captain Becker), Ruth Kearney (Jess Parker), Ruth Bradley (Lady Emily Marchent), Juliet aubrey (Helen Cutter [Voice])\n\nDirected by Cilla Ware\n\nProduced by Tim Bradley\n\nExecutive Producer Tim Haines, Adrian Hodges and Cameron McAllister\n\nAn Impossible Pictures production for ITV / ProSeiben\n\nTX: (Watch)\n\n28th June 2011 @ 8:00 pm\n\nNotes:\n\n*Featuring Connor Temple, Abby Maitland, Matt Anderson, Jess Parker, Captain Becker and James Lester"
