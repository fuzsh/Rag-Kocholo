        "text": "The Atlanta Film Festival has chosen twelve finalists in the feature screenplay category and five finalists in the pilot category for the 2016 Screenplay Competition! Representing three countries and six states, the advancing screenplays have been selected from a record 482 submissions—over double the submissions received for last year's competition. Additionally, three feature screenplay winners and one pilot screenplay winner have been selected from the finalists. Congratulations to all!\n\nThe three feature screenplay winners are flown to Atlanta during the festival for the ATLFF Screenwriters' Retreat, a three-day immersive experience where they will work with three established screenwriters and industry professionals on how to develop, sharpen and produce each screenplay. Our pilot screenplay winner will receive a one-on-one business dinner with an industry professional.\n\nAll winners will have full access to all events and resources available during the ten-day festival, including screenings, panels and parties, as well as the opportunity to meet and interact with a host of visiting filmmakers and media professionals from around the world. Winners will also receive a one (1) year-long CONNECT membership with the International Screenwriters Association.\n\nFeature Screenplay Finalists (Winners in Bold)\n\n“The Audition” by Eric Carlson (Virginia)\n\n“Black Sunday” by Heidi Willis (Alabama)\n\n“Catch the Devil” by Martin Blinder (Hawaii/California)\n\n“Dietrich Danzig” by John Pisano-Thomsen (Canada)\n\n“Do You Wanna Talk About It?” by Michael Boyle (California)\n\n“Faith” by Steven Brooks (Georgia)\n\n\"Going Dark” by Alexis Pelot and Jessica Coleman (Georgia)\n\n“Homegrown” by Jacques Edeline (California)\n\n“Lemon Made” by Erik Adolphson (California)\n\n“Melon Head” by Andy Fortenbacher (New York)\n\n“The Midnight Special” by Christy Hall, Rebecca Comerford, Sol Tryon (New York/California)\n\n“Twelve Strays of Christmas” by Ken Lemm (Georgia)\n\nPilot Screenplay Finalists (Winner in Bold)\n\n“Bloodworth” by Jonathan Katz (Virginia)\n\n\"Cold Spring Harbor” by Mike Makowsky (California)\n\n“Immaculate” by Colleen Scriven (California)\n\n“Janus” by Pearse Lehane (United Kingdom)\n\n“Off The Menu” by Dennis Camlek (Georgia)\n\nThe 2016 Screenwriters' Retreat will be held once again by Serenbe Film and AIR Serenbe.
