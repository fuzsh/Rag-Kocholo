        "text": "alism too much. Some of the suggestions, like the one mentioned above, suggest that it is incumbent upon the scholar to engage in additional labor, and labor with which s/he may not have experience, in order to brand the research (as well as the researcher) in a more accessible way. Are these steps toward the marketization of academia – particularly in relation to the neoliberal capitalist market? While the text seems to grapple with this question, it would benefit from additional problematizations of its own implications. In addition to its complex relation to neoliberalism, this book also presents a tension between the general and the specific. While Freeman sets out to provide a UK-centric consideration of media industry research methods, there is, in some chapters scant mention of the specificities of the UK media industries. For example, Freeman’s chapter text will sometimes refer to Hollywood, and at other times to the UK industries, but most of the nuts-and-bolts discussions ...\n\nBroadcasting is undergoing a period of profound change. Convergence and digitisation are reshaping production and consumption. In the multi-channel environment, public service broadcasting (PSB) finds itself under threat, as traditional funding models are threatened by increased choice, new modes of delivery, and, for commercial public service broadcasters, a reduction in advertising revenue. In the UK, the industry base has undergone significant restructuring over the last twenty-five years. This has occurred following the creation of Channel 4 in 1982, and the emergence of the independent television production sector (ITPS) , coupled with a steady process of employment and industry deregulation. Labour in the sector is now predominantly freelance (Skillset, 2006a, 2007a), and increasingly concentrated in the ITPS, largely in London but with growing production bases at a regional level. Furthermore, the independent sector itself is reshaping, from a sector predominantly made up of ...\n\nThis paper seeks to fill a gap between existing theories of cultural work and the lived experience of creative labourers. After identifying certain limitations in mainstream theories of cultural work that are implicitly based on the image of traditional artistic labour, the paper suggests that there is a need to consider the various desires of creative workers in current creative industries. Arguing that the multiple wishes of creative workers are based on their multiple identities, the paper examines the idea of multiple identities and its relationship with creative autonomy by analysing the case of Korean television PDs (Producer-Directors) in the light-entertainment genre. Finally, a new analytical framework of creative autonomy that elucidates the paradoxical and complex nature of creative production process and creative labour is suggested."
