Four housewives who find themselves suddenly in desperate need of money for dire individual circumstances begin to consider the possibility of armed robbery as a way out of their various dilemmas. Kathy is a previously wealthy whose former football star husband has absconded with their funds and left her and their children to face his violent creditors. Pat needs money to get her drug-addicted son into an expensive rehabilitation center. Val struggles for options in her crisis: pregnancy, possibly by her white husband's black best friend. And Paula, Val's sister, needs the thrill of danger even more than money. Together they plot a robbery that leads them further into crime and possible disaster.",

        "text": "wow!!!!!! what a film. i love this film and think the acting is superb which makes a film all more special. There nothing i dislike about this film and think its one of the best series I've seen. If you're going to buy this you wont be disappointed it 5 star *****.\n\nThere so many twists you will be kept entertained throughout. It a film that makes you think \" what going to happen next \". It is a rather sad ending but i suppose thats the way it is. As the film caries on so does the tension.\n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as i do and your watch it over and over again"
