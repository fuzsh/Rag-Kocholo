With the case hitting so close to home, the team has no choice but to suspect their own colleagues and question everyone from the upper echelons of the Jeffersonian scientists to the victim's fellow interns. When they learn that the intern had been working on artifact authentication for the Widow's Son serial killer case. they begin to wonder if her involvement could have put her life in danger. But when they discover a romantic link between the intern and a Jeffersonian employee, the motives behind her murder become even more complicated. Meanwhile, Booth agrees to pose as Cam's boyfriend and accompanies her on a family get-together, eliciting more attention than he bargained for from Cam's sister."
