        "text": "Each week we'll be asking people from all parts of the media industry - from channel controllers to catering staff, directors to digital technicians - to tell us about themselves and their job.\n\nAhead of next weekend’s launch of sci-fi drama Primeval, we spoke to Cameron McAllister, the show’s executive producer.\n\nName\n\nCameron McAllister\n\nJob Title\n\nProducer and executive producer\n\nAge\n\n40\n\nLives\n\nBrighton\n\nIn the role since\n\nSeptember 2005.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nCo-responsibility for the overall project - storylines, casting, employing crew, managing shoot and post production, joint overall editorial responsibility.\n\nBest thing about your job\n\nTelling stories.\n\nWorst thing about your job\n\nFilming.\n\nFirst thing you do in the morning when you get in?\n\nDrink coffee and check emails.\n\nAny downsides to working in your job?\n\nSome of the egos.\n\nFirst media/TV job\n\nTrainee director with LWT in September 1989.\n\nBiggest achievement to date\n\nThis show.\n\nAnything you wish you'd done differently?\n\nMaybe gone to film school and made feature films.\n\nDream job/company/lifestyle\n\nWriting movies from a house in the Greek Islands.\n\nBest media jolly you've ever attended\n\nBafta film awards and brushing past Kate Winslet.\n\nDo you think Primeval will be as much of a success for ITV has Doctor Who has been for the BBC?\n\nIt would be great but Dr Who is an national institution - we have to start from scratch.\n\nIf you found a “rip in time” like in Primeval, which time period would you go back to??\n\nPrimary School, down the end of the playing field where the girls would do anything for you if you kissed them. Not unlike casting I guess?"
