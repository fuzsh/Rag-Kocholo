        "text": "For those who have a reactive dog, you're no doubt familiar with the idea that their overzealous behaviour often stems from fear - protectiveness over themselves or their owners. Nonetheless, it's a taxing challenge dealing with continuous barking at someone knocking on your door or even just walking by outside.\n\nDog trainers are sharing key advice on how to keep your canine friend quiet and stress-free when visitors arrive. At The Good Dog in Yorktown, Virginia, experts Morgan Strack and Katie Eaton are known for their helpful training tips.\n\nThey recently shared a post on Instagram saying: \"Bad habits at the front door? This is the easiest way to teach your dog how to be calm when people are coming over. Using a tether will prevent bad habits from forming while also being able to attend to your guest.\"\n\nDemonstrating with her own pet Cooper, Morgan revealed a straightforward leash technique, securing it under the door which keeps the dog away from newcomers. She added: \"It's important to realise that ATTENTION is a reward to your dog. Rewards reinforce behaviours. So, the more your dog gets attention while they're jumping and barking, the more they're going to offer those behaviours.\"\n\nFast forwarding Cooper's reaction, it became evident that over time, the anxious canine began to settle. Morgan explained, \"Tethering is a great option if you don't have anyone around to hold the leash or help you with training. The tether will prevent your dog from being able to crowd your guests so that the wrong behaviours don't accidentally get reinforced.\n\n\"You want to reinforce CALMNESS instead - so don't let them greet your guests until they are much calmer! You'll notice over time that you don't have to use the leash nearly as much, till you can do away with it completely.\"\n\nWrapping up the video, Morgan clarified, that once your dog has achieved complete calmness, you can then place them on a lead and introduce them to your guest but only when they're relaxed.\n\nViewers were impressed by the advice and quickly expressed their gratitude toward the dog trainers. One viewer commented: \"Thank you! ! I needed this tip. My dog has excitement pee! Drives me crazy cuz people don't always accept my request to please not touch him until he calms down. This will be a game changer I'm sure.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another chimed in saying: \"OMGosh! Lol. This made me want to cry! Haha. His adorable little tail he got so excited! And everyone just walked by!!!!! Poor bubba. I get it though. Just broke my heart for a minute.\"\n\nNumerous individuals had further queries. One user questioned: \"What should you do when they calm but once getting attention get wild again? \" Morgan responded with advice, saying: \"I would just put less emphasis on the greeting. Have your guest ignore your dog indefinitely, till they're nice and calm!\"."
