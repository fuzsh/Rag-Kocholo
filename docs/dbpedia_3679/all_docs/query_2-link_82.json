        "text": "Survivalism has been such a popular theme on television in recent years that an adaptation of “Robinson Crusoe” was probably as inevitable as a second season of “Ice Road Truckers.” “Crusoe,” as the 13-part NBC series beginning on Friday calls itself, was going to come, and there was nothing to be done about it  and no one, apparently, to constrain all of its camp and splashy budget.\n\n“Crusoe” is pure spectacle absent any allegorical ambition. It was not developed with the affinities of the Defoe Society in mind, and if Daniel Defoe himself is going to be watching via a very special satellite dish positioned in the beyond, I’m going to warn him right now that he might want to make a very angry call to his agent, because textual faithfulness is not the production’s guiding imperative.\n\n“Crusoe” begins with the hero of its title (played by Philip Winchester, with his romance-novel looks) already shipwrecked and confronting pirates for whom you wish that a UPS delivery of Crest whitening strips would simply plop down on the sand. Sequestered on his island, Crusoe has apparently figured out a good way to keep his teeth clean, but out on the high seas, dental hygiene is in constant peril.\n\nWhatever ingenuity Crusoe applied to his makeshift toothpaste is showcased to even greater effect with his homemade ammunition system. Arms dealers ought to know just how much damage can be done with an apparatus triggered by a couple of coconuts. And yet the novel’s D.I.Y. elements aren’t fully exploited: Crusoe’s painstaking creation of his setup on the island, the construction of shelter, the foraging and the baking of bread. We don’t really see Crusoe making anything  it is as if he were marooned in a theme park.\n\nThe series forgoes any interest in the novel as a treatise on systems of production and consumption. It also doesn’t get bogged down in the book’s understanding of natural man and moral conversion. The writers seem to understand that “Robinson Crusoe” is something more than an 18th-century children’s book, but beyond turning out a wench with good cleavage, they don’t do much to prove it. During the series’s two-hour premiere the novel’s theism is addressed in one line, Crusoe saying, “I have faith that providence has not yet given up on me.”\n\nA meditation on solitude is turned into an advertisement for co-dependence: Friday (Tongayi Chirisa), the kindly savage, is served up as Crusoe’s sidekick. Crusoe jovially makes Friday promise he’ll stay away from that silly cannibalism. The two are Crockett and Tubbs.\n\nThere would be no crime in any of this if “Crusoe” didn’t feel like such a drag. “Lost” requires a vague familiarity with names that turn up on the syllabus for an introductory political theory class, but “Crusoe” just demands caffeine. It sedates, and its fabricated sentimentality does not save it.\n\nCrusoe battles mutineers, and he pines for his wife, Susannah (Anna Walton), a wholesome beauty of misty flashbacks. It would probably seem petty to point out that the hero of Defoe’s imagining wasn’t longing for the ladies. You can pin a lot of labels on Defoe’s masterwork, but love story isn’t one of them."
