WULLIE AND RAB.\n\nAmong the hills that divide the county of Ayr from Kirkcudbright, and near the bonny Doon, lived, in the early part of this century, a man named William Murdoch, but who was called by all his neighbors \"honest Wullie.\" He was a farm-laborer, and lived alone in a cottage which he rented. He feared God and regarded man. His word was indeed as good as his bond. He had been called honest Wullie while yet a boy, and by common consent he still retained the name. At the time our story opens he was about thirty-five years of age.\n\nIt was the morning of the first of January. The departing year had robed the earth in spotless white, that its successor might behold nothing but beauty and purity, and might begin its course with gladness. The rough places were made[Pg 8] smooth and the waste places concealed. The sun shone brightly, and the earth glittered and sparkled as if nature had purposely arrayed herself in jewelled robes to welcome the coming year. But men looked out upon the frozen earth and saw only wastes of snow, and began to cut their way through it that they might look after their cattle and all that belonged to them. While all other hands were busy, Willie Murdoch's were not idle. He was shovelling paths about his door, and, while so employed, his thoughts were running in this manner.\n\n\"I suppose I shall hae to look after that ne'er-do-weel brither o' mine. A man canna let his ain brither suffer, even if it s'ould be through his ain faut. Rab was aye a careless lad. He s'ouldna hae married withoot changing his ways. Hoo did he suppose he would support a wife and weans! He aye depends o'er muckle on me.\" While he was thus mentally soliloquizing his brother appeared, struggling through the snow.\n\n\"Weel, Wullie, ye are aye warking; ye are o'er industrious.\"\n\n\"A man canna sit in the hoose and be snawed in. Hae ye no made paths aboot your ain door?\"\n\n\"I didna feel the courage to do it, the snaw is that deep. I am a'maist beat oot wi' coming here.\"\n\n[Pg 9]\n\n\"What brings ye oot on sic a morning? Are ye no all weel at hame?\"\n\n\"We are all weel, I am thankful to say, but I am in trouble aboot the rent. Ye ken it is due, and I hae na made oot to save it. I am sair set upon to pay it, and I cam to ask if ye could gie me a helping hand.\"\n\nIt seemed but natural for Robert to ask this help. As his brother had said, he depended on Willie. The two were all that were left of their family, or, rather, of two families; for, though brothers by adoption and affection, they were in reality cousins. Willie's parents had died when he was but a few months old, and his mother's only sister, then lately married to a brother of Willie's father, had taken the orphaned little one and brought him up as her own child. He had repaid her with all the devotion of a loving and thoughtful son; and on her death-bed she had given him, then only fifteen years of age, the charge of Robert, who was six years younger. Her other children had died in infancy, and she had been a widow several years.\n\n\"Wullie, ye are a douce lad, for ane o' your years,\" she had said. \"Ye maun aye hae a care o' your brither, and if he doesna get on weel in the warld, dinna spare to lend him a hand. And may the gude God guide you both.\"\n\n[Pg 10]\n\nWillie had never forgotten the injunction of his foster-mother, which seemed to him doubly binding from the peculiar character of their relationship. He had had too much care of his brother, in fact, to the manifest detriment of both; for Robert was sadly deficient in self-reliance, and Willie's hard-earned money was too often applied to the support of his brother's family. So when this new demand was made, Willie, with a perplexed look, leaned upon his shovel and remained a moment silent and thoughtful. At length he spoke.\n\n\"I dinna see what is to be dune. I am sair straitened for siller mysel'.\"\n\n\"Weel, if ye dinna see a way I canna tell what is to become o' us. I thought I could coont on you to help me out o' my trouble.\"\n\n\"Ye hae coonted on me o'er mony times for the gude o' my purse,\" said Willie, half in jest and half in earnest; for he had always said to himself, \"I can never find it in my heart to be hard upon Rab.\" \"But come into the hoose, Rab,\" continued he; \"we will talk aboot it, and see if there is ony way to mend matters. I hae a few p'un's laid by for ony case o' emergency; but I would be loath to break in upon that just noo. Ye s'ould wark better and plan better. I dinna want to be hard upon you, but ye maunna forget[Pg 11] that ye are na longer a laddie, but a man, and a husband and father forbye. I will help you this ance, but I canna be always ready to meet your obligations at a moment's warning. I hae been casting aboot in my ain mind, for some time, whether it wouldna be better to tak ye a' in wi' me, sin' ye are maistly no prepared on rent days. The hoose is sma'; that is ane thing against it; and I hae sa long lived in quiet that it might be hard at first to become accustomed to the prattle o' the bairns; but if you choose to come, you will be welcome.\"\n\nThis generous offer had cost Wullie no little self-sacrifice. He had lived alone since Robert was married, and he liked that way of living. \"He could mak his ain parritch, and help himsel' amazin' weel,\" as his neighbors said. His wants were few and simple. He went to his labor each morning, and returned in the evening. As he left his house, so he found it; but how would it be if he opened his door to his brother's family? This is what he often thought about, and for this reason he had hesitated to propose the subject to Robert. But it was becoming a serious matter to pay so much for rent, for he almost always had it to pay for both cottages. Besides, hardly a week passed that he did not carry or send something to relieve the necessities of[Pg 12] Robert's family. Having made the proposition, he watched to see how it would be received.\n\nRobert's face brightened at first; then a shadow overspread it as he thought that, if he were in his brother's house, he could not conceal from him the fact that he was often out at night, and in bad company. So he sat trotting his feet, with his eyes on the floor, and made no reply.\n\n\"Hoo would that please you, Rab?\" asked Wullie, after a long silence.\n\n\"I would be almost ashamed to accept sic a favor. Then, too, I might feel mair bound to think like yoursel' aboot mony things that I hae my ain opeenion aboot.\"\n\n\"Hoo is that, Rab? Ye dinna want to do wrang, I hope; or do you think I hae na sense to judge what s'ould be accounted wrang? If you do what is right, we will hae na difference o' opeenion. It is time ye had your wild oats a' sown. A man s'ould think mair aboot wark and less aboot diversion.\"\n\n\"Ilka ane canna think like yoursel', Wullie.\"\n\n\"Ilka ane s'ould consult duty before pleasure, Rab.\"\n\n\"A' folk dinna see duty in the same light. But we will mak na mair words aboot that. If Jeannie has na objections, we will accept your kindness and be thankful for it.\"\n\n[Pg 13]\n\nThis he said to cover his own hesitancy, for he well knew that his wife would be glad of any change that would insure for herself more comforts and fewer cares. Her daily life was harassed by the all-absorbing questions, \"What shall we eat? what shall we drink? and wherewithal shall we be clothed?\"\n\nRobert for once hastened home to tell Jeannie the good news. As may be supposed, her necessitous circumstances overcame her pride, and she readily consented to a proposition which would lessen her anxieties; for she was a sensible, well-meaning woman, and was much pained at her husband's want of thrift. \"Wullie was aye a douce, honest man,\" said she, as she made hasty preparations to leave her comfortless home. There was little to pack and little to move; and before night closed in upon the short day, Robert and his family were brought by a kind neighbor to his brother's door. Wullie heaved a sigh of regret for past quiet, and hastened to welcome the pale, careworn woman to her new home.\n\nTears of gratitude stood in Jeannie's eyes as she crossed the threshold. She extended her hand to Wullie, and endeavored to express her thanks; but sobs choked her utterance, and she burst into tears.\n\n\"Ye maunna greet, woman; ye are mair than[Pg 14] welcome. Sit doun by the fire, and warm yoursel' and the bairns,\" said Wullie in the kindest tones.\n\nJeannie sat down and soon regained her composure. Then she arose, and began to place and put in order the few things she had brought with her. This done, she returned to the fire where Wullie was preparing the evening meal. She assisted in arranging the table, and soon they sat down to a frugal but substantial supper.\n\nAfter the repast was finished, Robert went to pay his rent. Jeannie busied herself about the house for a while; then she put the children to bed, and sat down to her usual evening occupation, knitting.\n\nWullie did not as usual get his Bible; he sat on the opposite side of the room and watched Jeannie's nimble fingers and listened to the clicking of her needles.\n\n\"Jeannie, ye are o'er pale and thin; are ye no weel?\" he asked.\n\n\"I maistly think I am weel; but whiles I misdoot it. I think laneliness has had muckle to do wi' my ill looks. I was reared in a large family, and I canna but feel the change. Then Rab has a way o' gaen oot in the evening, and I am all alane, savin' my sleepin' bairns; and it is weary waitin', for he is lang a-comin'. I doot if he[Pg 15] would like me to tell you, but lately I hae suffered bath laneliness and fear.\"\n\n\"O Jeannie, ye s'ould hae tauld me before. I didna ken he was gaen that gate.\"\n\n\"Weel, I hae tauld ye noo, and I hae a purpose in tellin' ye. I want ye to look after him. He willna heed me, but perhaps he will heed you.\"\n\nWullie was about to reply when they heard a footstep, and Robert entered.\n\n\"Weel, Rab, ye are square ance mair,\" said his brother cheerily, though his own small store was much smaller on that account.\n\n\"Ay am I, thanks to yoursel', Wullie.\"\n\n\"I am right glad we hae stoppit rent-payin' for ane o' the places. Noo, if ye stick to wark as ye s'ould, ye will get on in the warld better than ye hae been doing. I will seek a gude place for ye the neist year. If ye are wullin' to wark weel, I hae na doot but ye can wark wi' me. Farmer Lindsay will need anither man in the spring, and ye would do better on a farm than wi' your hedging and ditching. With him ye would hae every kind o' wark in its season; and if ye wark as weel as ye ken hoo, ye will hae wark the hail year round, and nae trouble in gien satisfaction. We will hae to look weel to oor affairs, and then I see na reason why we [Pg 16]s'ouldna gather comforts aboot us. I will get a coo; it willna cost muckle to keep her, and the milk will be gude for the bairns. And we'll hae to fatten a couple o' swine. I hae had naebody but mysel' to feed, and I hae been sa strang and weel that onything would do me. But your wife and bairns need mair than I hae needed. I dinna like to see them sa thin and pale.\"\n\nA cry from one of the children attracted Jeannie's attention, and she left the room.\n\n\"It canna be, Rab, that they hae na been weel keepit,\" he continued. \"Plenty o' aiten meal would mak them look better than they do.\"\n\nRab was confused, and did not reply. He could not look into the clear gray eyes of honest Wullie and tell him that a part of his wages went to the innkeeper, that he often treated a set of idle, jolly fellows with the money that should have given bread to his family. So he only said, \"Jeannie has never complained o' her fare.\"\n\n\"Weel, Rab, the pale cheek will sometimes tell o' suffering when the tongue refuses to speak o' it. I dinna say it is so in Jeannie's case; ye ken that best yoursel'.\"\n\n\"Wullie, ye are o'er plain o' speech. Ilka ane wouldna tak it frae ye.\"\n\n\"I am plain-spoken, Rab. I never say yea[Pg 17] when I mean nay; neither do I stand aboot tellin' a freend his fauts when ony gude can come o' it. 'Faithful are the wounds o' a freend,' ye ken.\"\n\n\"That may be; but sic talk maistly sits too snug to fit weel. Ye are ca'ed honest Wullie, and ye cam as honestly by the name through your plain, outspoken way as by your fair dealing.\"\n\n\"Weel, I am no ashamed o' the name, however I cam by it.\"\n\nJeannie's return changed the conversation to some other subject.\n\n[Pg 18]\n\nCHAPTER II. THE NEW HOME.\n\nThe next morning was the Sabbath. Of course honest Wullie was at home on that morning. It was a strange thing for him to have children in his house. But his face brightened as little Jamie's curly head and happy face appeared, and instinctively he extended his hand. \"Come to me, come to your uncle, my wee man,\" he said in winning tones.\n\nThe child approached him rather slowly, and suffered himself to be lifted to his uncle's knee. Soon the broad palm of honest Wullie was stroking Jamie's head, and from that time Uncle Wullie's knee was the child's favorite seat. The other child was a mere babe, a sweet, delicate little girl, named Isabel, whom Wullie always called \"the wee lass.\" This child he did not at first attempt to take, for she was \"sic a wee bit thing,\" he said, he would be \"a'maist sure to let her fa'.\"\n\nThere was soon a decided improvement in Rab's family. The children grew plump and rosy, and the mother lost the pale, sad look.[Pg 19] Rab seldom went to town, and when he did he returned early. His wife began to breathe more freely; she inwardly felt that Wullie's influence would save her husband.\n\nSpring came, and with it a change of labor for Robert Murdoch. His brother secured employment for him on Mr. Lindsay's farm, as he had proposed. Jeannie now moved about the house with a light step and a lighter heart. The cottage too was undergoing a change; not under the carpenter's hand, but under the skilful, remodelling hand of a woman. The bareness was less apparent. In the best room were a chest of drawers and a clock, the only heirlooms Jeannie possessed. The windows were curtained, some of the rough chairs and unsightly stools were cushioned; here was a small mirror, and there a bright pincushion and housewife. The cradle, too, with its many-colored covering and tiny pillow, and little Isabel's sweet face half hidden in it, made the cottage seem more like a home. True, there was no elegance or beauty, but there was a change; for honest Wullie had considered his home furnished when he had a bed, a table, a few chairs, shovel and tongs, parritch-pot, and bake-kettle. As to time, he could always tell that by the crowing of the cock or the position of the sun. He was so accustomed to[Pg 20] these methods of telling time that he seldom needed to look at the noon-mark cut in the south window. But Wullie appreciated the change that had taken place, and smiled approvingly. He even went so far as to say, \"It taks a woman's hand to mak hame tidy.\" He began to perceive that he had received as well as afforded comfort by opening his door to others.\n\nQuickly passed the spring and summer seasons. On warm afternoons Jeannie often sat in the pleasant cottage door sewing on some pretty garments for the little ones who were playing at her feet. She had watched the budding trees with unusual interest, for the new life in nature seemed to harmonize with her own fresh hopes. Her heart was again blithe and hopeful, and as the birds carolled their notes of joy, she too sang old songs of love and happiness. But hers was a happiness founded on the constancy of frail humanity. Alas, that cannot always be trusted.\n\n[Pg 21]\n\nCHAPTER III. DAFT JAMIE'S.\n\nAbout two miles from the cottage was a small inn and dramshop familiarly known as Daft Jamie's. The nominal proprietor was James McAllister, but the house was kept by his wife; for, many years before, McAllister had been so badly injured in a drunken brawl that he had never fully recovered his reason, and had ever since borne the name of Daft Jamie. This was a place of resort for all the idlers of the neighborhood, who came here to gossip and drink and empty their pockets into Mrs. McAllister's money-drawer. Rab well knew the road to this place, but since he had brought his family to his brother's house he had kept away from it.\n\nOne evening late in autumn Robert Murdoch failed to come home as usual. As the evening advanced Jeannie's fears fast deepened into certainty; but she concealed her anxiety as well as she could and endeavored to appear cheerful.\n\nWullie had no fears concerning his brother. He sat down near the fire, preparing to doze until Rab should return; but before he was lost in[Pg 22] slumber Jeannie broke the silence by remarking that the night was dark, and it was a long way to Daft Jamie's.\n\n\"What puts Daft Jamie's into your heid?\" said Wullie. \"Surely Rab is no there. He is crackin' wi' Donald McPherson or some o' the neebors. Dinna worry yoursel'. Gang to your bed, and I'll wait for Rab.\"\n\nBut Jeannie did not go to bed. She resumed her work and relapsed into silence.\n\nAgain Wullie settled himself into an easy posture and succeeded in falling asleep. The unhappy wife still listened for the footsteps of her husband, but all the sound she heard was the heavy breathing of the weary man in the chimney-corner. After another hour had passed she again roused the sleeper.\n\n\"I am right sorry to disturb you,\" she said, \"but I am worried about Rab. Would you be sa kind as to gang and look for him?\"\n\n\"Ay, I will gang, to please you,\" said he, putting on his bonnet and going out into the darkness. It was now late. As he passed the neighbors' houses one after another, he found only darkness and silence. The inmates were wrapped in slumber. Rab was not there. He kept on till he saw the light of Daft Jamie's. As he approached the house he heard loud laughing.[Pg 23] He opened the door and beheld with astonishment his brother, who had always been as lithe as a willow, performing sundry feats for the amusement of the company. Rab was so much engaged that he did not notice the entrance of the new-comer.\n\n\"Gude save us!\" exclaimed one of the company, \"if here isna honest Wullie! I would liefer see the de'il himsel' in this place.\"\n\nWullie walked straight to his brother. \"It is time all honest folk were at hame,\" said he.\n\nRobert looked at him a moment, hardly knowing whether to be angry or to yield and feel foolish.\n\n\"Can a man no hae a bit o' merriment but ye maun come spierin' aboot after him?\" he asked.\n\n\"Come hame. Dinna stop here makin' a gowk o' yoursel',\" said Wullie in an undertone. \"I could hide my face wi' very shame to see your foolish pranks to mak sport for these idle haverals.\"\n\nRab went home, but he was much displeased. He did not like the idea of his free moral agency being interfered with. He remained silent and sullen. When the Sabbath came he refused to accompany Wullie to church. Wullie remonstrated, but to no purpose. \"Then ye can mind the bairns, and let your wife gang,\" he added.\n\n[Pg 24]\n\n\"She can gang if she likes,\" Rab replied.\n\nThe day passed wearily to Robert Murdoch. He felt as one always feels when he is wilfully drifting from the right. To Wullie the day and means of grace had not been without profit. Ever since his brother came to live with him he had been debating with his conscience whether he ought to have family worship. That day he made up his mind to act on the side of duty. When the time for rest drew near, the time when so many of those honest, devout sons of Scotland bowed before the King of kings, Wullie took down the Bible he had so often read in private, and read aloud. Then he knelt in prayer, and one more altar was set up for the worship of God. Short and simple, yet touching, was the prayer of honest Wullie. Especially did he pray that they all might be delivered from the power of the tempter. After he arose from his knees he remarked to Robert,\n\n\"Ye dinna mind when our faither kept the fire o' devotion burning on sic an altar as I hae this night set up, but I mind it weel; and I mind, mairover, that God's fury is to be poured out on the families that call not on his name; so I hae made up my mind that, come what will, I will daily raise my voice in praise to God, to whom I owe every good thing I possess.\"\n\n[Pg 25]\n\nJeannie, who had often in her hours of trouble turned her thoughts towards God, heartily assented to this arrangement. But Rab said to himself, \"What is the need o' sic an ado?\" He felt that the breath of piety in his home was a constant rebuke to his wilful course, and it vexed him. Truly, \"the way of the transgressor is hard.\"\n\nBut Rab's resentment gradually wore away, and the little household had nearly regained its wonted cheerfulness when, in a few weeks, Rab was again absent.\n\n\"I wonder what is keeping Rab,\" said Jeannie, as they sat down to supper without him. Wullie was as anxious as herself; for when the demon of drink has once entered a household, one never knows at what moment shame, or a worse thing, may come to the door.\n\nAs the candle burned low, and the evening was far advanced, Wullie arose and took his bonnet and plaid. \"The night is cold, and it is o'er late. I will go and seek Rab. Something has gone wrang, or he would be here.\"\n\n\"He said ye werena to come again,\" was sobbed out by Jeannie, rather than spoken.\n\n\"I canna bide this suspense, and it is my duty to go. We are each our brother's keeper.\"\n\nIt was a still, cold night. The stars shone brightly, and the crusted snow sparkled in the[Pg 26] moonlight. Wullie drew his plaid closely about him and strode forth in the direction of Daft Jamie's. He knew by the remark that greeted his ear on the former occasion that his presence was not regarded as desirable, so he slipped in very quietly. There was Mrs. McAllister, who was anxious to shut up for the night, and Rab with his boon companion Donald McPherson. When Wullie entered, Donald was vainly endeavoring to induce Rab to go home.\n\n\"Hands off,\" said Wullie, coming quickly forward; \"I'll tak care o' him mysel'. He has had mair o' your care than is gude for him.\" Then, turning to the landlady and addressing her, he said, \"Ye s'ould be mair careful hoo ye deal oot your foul whiskey.\"\n\nHe raised his brother to his feet, put his bonnet on his head, drew him to the door, and turned his face towards home. He took him by the arm and led him along as fast as possible. Jeannie had sat there anxiously waiting their return. They laid the scarcely conscious man in his bed, and then with aching hearts sought their own pillows, where at length tardy sleep came to relieve exhausted nature.\n\nRobert awoke next morning too late to go to his work in time. His head ached; he felt angry with himself and angry with others. His wife[Pg 27] bore his ill-humor with patience, and that annoyed him. Little Jamie noticed the change in his father. \"What ails ye, faither, that ye dinna smile to wee Jamie?\" he asked.\n\n\"Faither has a sair heid; rin awa and play by yoursel',\" said the father.\n\nJeannie prepared a nice dinner, and she tried to wear a smile, but failed; for in her heart she felt that thick darkness hung over her future.\n\nWhen honest Wullie returned from his work that evening his face was very grave. Thought had been active all day. Had he been too lenient with his brother when he was young and under his care? Had he failed to impress his mind with Bible truths? What was the cause of his intemperance? and why his aversion to vital piety? These and similar questions had troubled him all day. So while Rob had a \"sair heid,\" Wullie had a sair heart. He took his Bible and read long to himself. Once, some large tears fell on the book. Rab saw them, and his heart was softened. He had never before seen tears in his brother's eyes. He moved uneasily about the room, and spoke pleasantly to his family. He even felt so nearly penitent as to listen patiently to the reading of the Scriptures, and to a lengthy prayer wherein were some allusions to his own shortcomings, for Wullie carried all his troubles to the[Pg 28] throne of grace. So he besought the Lord, who is a present help in trouble, to draw near to his household, and to deliver them from the snare of the fowler; he entreated that, if Satan desired to have any of them, the blessed Master might pray for them as he did for Peter of old, and plead their poor prayers before the throne of mercy, and that delivering power might be felt in all their hearts.\n\nThe next day Rab was himself again. He went to his work, and came home at the usual time. He had thought a good deal during the day. He was ashamed of his weakness, and he had resolved to let strong drink alone. He told Wullie that he would never have to go again to Daft Jamie's to bring him home; and he promised Jeannie that he would drink no more. Jeannie rejoiced to hear him say so, although she knew a promise is more easily made than kept.\n\nBut Rab kept his resolution. He worked steadily all the next year. He attended church, and seemed anxious to do right. Hope sprang up in the hearts of his wife and brother. Wullie felt sure that God had heard his prayers. And God had heard them. But human strength, at best, is weak; and there was to be one more trial, the hardest and the last.\n\n[Pg 29]\n\nCHAPTER IV. DEATH IN THE CUP.\n\nThe rolling year again brought the winter. During the coldest weather there was little to be done on the farm, and Wullie and Rab spent many days at home. One very cold evening Rab went out \"to look after the coo,\" as he told his wife. While he was at the cow-shed, Donald McPherson, who was passing that way in hope of seeing his old comrade, approached him softly.\n\n\"Come awa wi' me to Daft Jamie's, and get a drop to warm you this cauld night.\"\n\n\"I canna gang, Donald. It isna gude for me nor you to gang there.\"\n\n\"Hoot, man! I'll be bound ye are as dry as a fish oot o' water.\"\n\n\"Weel, dry or no dry, I canna gang. I hae na claes on that would keep me frae the cauld to gang that length, and but a puir pair o' auld shoon to my feet; and if I went to the hoose to get better, Jeannie would say, 'Where are ye gaen?' and Wullie would say, 'What are ye after noo?' Sa ye see yoursel' I canna gang.\"\n\n\"I hae it. Ye jist gang in and say ye are[Pg 30] but noo tauld to gang for the doctor for a seek neebor.\"\n\n\"Na, na. I canna lee, wi' a' my fauts. I would liefer rin fast eneuch to keep mysel' warm.\"\n\n\"Weel, do that,\" said the tempter; and Rab consented, though rather reluctantly.\n\nHe did run fast enough to keep himself warm while going; but alas for the home-coming! He had, of course, drunk more than was good for him. Mrs. McAllister, who feared another visit from honest Wullie, urged Donald to take him home. Donald took him a part of the way and left him. \"We hae had a gude auld-fashioned time tagither,\" said he; \"but noo ye maun hasten hame. Rin, for the life o' ye!\" But poor Rab did not comprehend his situation; he could not have hurried if he had. The cold soon benumbed him; his feet refused to carry him, and he soon sank down into the snow.\n\nMeantime he had been missed at home, and search had been made for him. It was a long time before it entered into the minds of his family that he might have gone to Daft Jamie's. But with the thought Wullie quickly seized his brother's plaid and his own, and hurried in the direction of the inn. He had gotten about half the distance when he found the object of his search.[Pg 31] He succeeded in arousing him, wrapped him in his plaid, and took him home as fast as his ill condition would permit. Rab was allowed to remain near the fire until he was supposed to be warm. Then Wullie offered to \"loose his shoon.\" To his horror he discovered that his feet had been frozen.\n\nIt was a trial to all, but particularly to Rab, that he had to be kept in the house with sore feet. Still, no one at first realized the extent of the injury; and many days had elapsed before a conviction fastened on Rab's mind which found expression in these words:\n\n\"I will hae to lose my taes.\"\n\n\"No so bad as that, I hope,\" said his wife.\n\n\"I see nae help for it. Oh, why did I gang oot that unlucky night! I wish I had let the coo gang withoot her supper; then I wouldna hae seen Donald. I am afeared I will be a cripple a' the rest o' my days; and if I am crippled in sic a way, I will never shaw my heid again.\"\n\n\"But, Rab, ye might hae been frozen to death; think o' that!\"\n\n\"Ay, I hae thought o' that; and I hae thought o' anither thing, and that is just this: Donald McPherson will hae gray hairs on his heid before I forgie him for that night's wark. I would hae been at hame in my warm bed but for him. I[Pg 32] was aboot my ain business, and had nae intention o' gaen to Daft Jamie's, when he cam along, and naething would do but I maun gang wi' him. But, as God helps me to keep my promise, I will never be found wi' him again.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear ye say that,\" said Jeannie, \"and I hope ye will stick to it as lang as he is the same wild, warthless Donald; but if God s'ould change his heart, it would be different, ye ken.\"\n\n\"It is my opeenion that God's grace will never reach Donald.\"\n\n\"Ye maunna say that. Wullie would tell ye no to limit the grace o' God.\"\n\n\"Ay, and Wullie would say there is mercy for me; but I canna feel sure aboot it.\"\n\n\"And why s'ould there not be mercy for you?\"\n\n\"Because, Jeannie, I hae been, and am still, a great sinner.\"\n\n\"Weel, Rab, it was but yester morn that I read in the gude Book, 'They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick;' and I thought to mysel, here Jesus holds oot hope for the warst o' folk.\"\n\n\"It would seem so, Jeannie, but I ken little aboot sic things.\"\n\n\"And I am nae judge o' thae things either,[Pg 33] although I would fain learn aboot them. We will ask Wullie.\"\n\nAccordingly, after Wullie had returned from his work, and had settled in his favorite corner, with Jamie on his knee, Jeannie began to speak upon the subject uppermost in her mind.\n\n\"Wullie, doesna the Bible hold forth hope and pardon to the warst o' sinners?\"\n\n\"Of course it does. Wha says it doesna?\"\n\n\"Rab says he doesna feel a'thegither sure aboot it.\"\n\nWullie smiled a glad smile, not unmingled with surprise, while he answered, \"If you will test the promises, Rab, ye will ken better than to doot them. Only turn to the Lord wi' full purpose o' heart. Tak the promises as your ain, and cling to them, and ye shall save your soul; for the Lord is ever ready to hear all that call upon his name.\"\n\n\"I hae only lately begun to think aboot sic things. I had some conversation to-day wi' Jeannie that led her to speak to you aboot it.\"\n\n\"It is the strivings o' the Spirit, Rab. Oh, that ye would 'seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near!' He is near to you noo. He is speaking to your conscience. He has said, 'Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts;[Pg 34] and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.'\"\n\n\"I am sure I would like to have that abundant pardon. But there is are thing I canna mak clear in my ain mind. I canna weel see what maks sic a difference between us. It may be that you are to be saved and I am to be lost. Ye ken the ministers preach that one is sure to go to the gude place, and anither to the bad, according to God's plan.\"\n\n\"I ken, Rab, some say that. But I dinna fash my held aboot election while I can find sic words as these: 'Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?'\"\n\n\"But, Wullie, might not that be only for the chosen people, the Israelites?\"\n\n\"Na, Rab, na. 'The Gentiles shall come to Thy light.' And listen to this: 'Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.' And again: 'Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' This is eneuch for me; for I ken weel[Pg 35] our blessed Maister wouldna call us to him to send us empty awa.\"\n\n\"Weel, Wullie, there be folk wha say ane thing, and folk wha say anither thing. Wha kens wha has the right o' it?\"\n\n\"I will tell ye, Rab; ye just read the Ward o' God for yoursel. I am sure ye are nae fule; and if ye were, ye could understand eneuch to be saved; for the Bible declares that the wayfaring man, though a fule, needna err therein. Noo read for yoursel, as I said, and tak the plain, simple truths o' the Bible. Dinna gang aside frae the general course to pick at what ye canna understand, for in so doing ye may wrest the Scriptures to your ain destruction. Nane by seeking can find out God; neither can they understand all the wards o' him wha is infinite in wisdom.\"\n\n\"But what wad ye think if ye were in the kirk and ye s'ould hear it sounded in your ears that some were left to eternal death?\"\n\n\"I would no dispute it; but I would whisper softly to my heart sic passages o' the Holy Ward as these: 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that whasoever believeth in him s'ould not perish, but have eternal life.' 'For God so loved the warld that he gave his only-begotten Son,[Pg 36] that whasoever believeth in him s'ould not perish, but have everlasting life.' 'For God sent not his Son into the warld to condemn the warld, but that the warld through him might be saved.'\"\n\n\"That you would say to yoursel; but if a man was in trouble aboot the doctrine o' election, and s'ould ask ye to comfort him, what would ye tell him?\"\n\n\"I would say, dinna meddle wi' decrees. Never gang back o' the promises. They are strang eneuch to bear us up, and sweet eneuch to comfort us; and I think a' we hae to do is to lay hand o' them as they are held oot to us. And I will tell ye, Rab, what I honestly think: mair folk catch at the question o' election as an excuse for putting off God's claims upon them, than through fear that they are not o' the elect.\"\n\n[Pg 37]\n\nCHAPTER V. A YEAR OF GLOOM.\n\nSpring came, but Robert Murdoch was still in his chair. It was then evident that not only his feet had been injured, but that he had also contracted disease. The physician plainly told Wullie that his brother's working days were over. \"It is but right to tell you,\" said he, \"that he has consumption; and though its work may not be swift, it will be sure.\" Honest Wullie staggered under the weight of this sad intelligence. But he took this trouble where he had long since learned to take all others—to his Father in heaven. He also tried to appear cheerful, though his heart was very heavy.\n\nRab began to think that his health had been undermined, and he became very despondent. During the day he would sit many hours without speaking; but in the evening he would converse with his brother on indifferent subjects. Wullie soon perceived that he was speaking of that which was least in his thoughts. Therefore, one evening when Jeannie and the children were in another room, he endeavored to lead Rab to talk[Pg 38] of that which more nearly concerned his true welfare.\n\n\"Hoo is it,\" said he, \"that ye speak aboot sic things? I can see right weel that your heart is no in your talk. It would be better to lay aside sic pretences, for ye hae na deceived me frae the vera first. Ye hae a trouble that is pressing sair upon you. Will ye no tell me at ance what it is? Perhaps I might comfort you.\"\n\n\"Wullie,\" replied Rab, \"ye hae had ane look into my heart, and noo I will mak it bare to you. I am thinking I will never be a sound man again. It isna my feet alane, but I hae a sair pain when I cough; and I hae nae mair strength than wee Jamie; and it is nae wonder, for I sweat sae muckle o' nights. But that is not all: the end of it will be death—death to the body at least; and wha kens but it will be death to the soul as weel! It is this that troubles me. I sit and ponder it o'er and o'er, and Jeannie thinks perhaps that I am ill-tempered; but I canna bring mysel to tell her. It would break her heart if I were to dee without hope. Puir lass! I hae never been gude eneuch for her. Many a time I hae pitied her that she wasna better mated.\"\n\nWullie was much moved. As soon as he could trust his voice he replied, \"Rab, I hae seen all that ye hae tauld me, and mair than ye[Pg 39] hae tauld me. Ye are seeking to find favor in the sight o' God; and ye are looking within yoursel to find something to recommend you to him, but ye canna find onything. Ye hae been vexing yoursel wi' a notion a'thegither wrang. Hae ye never understood that ye are to come with a' your guilt upon you, and fall doun at the feet o' sovereign Mercy, and ask God to accept you as ye are, since naething but the bluid o' the Son of God has power to cleanse you frae your sins? That is the way you are to come to God. Ye shall read it for yoursel.\" Handing him the Bible, he continued, \"Read frae the eleventh to the twenty-fifth verse o' the fifteenth chapter o' St. Luke, and ye will see if the prodigal son did mair than just come to his faither.\"\n\nRab read the story carefully.\n\n\"Ye are right, Wullie. He went wi' a' his fauts, and was thinking to be coonted as a servant; but he wasna, for the servants were called to put the best robe on him, and a ring on his hand, and shoon on his feet.\"\n\n\"Ye hae missed ane strang point, Rab, if ye didna notice that the mere sight o' the sinfu' son, wi' his face turned hameward, gave the faither sic joy that he ran to meet him while he was yet a lang way off, and fell on his neck and kissed him.\"\n\n[Pg 40]\n\n\"Sae he did; sae he did. Weel, it was sae full I couldna tak it all in at ance.\"\n\nJeannie had returned and sat quietly listening. She had been praying that her husband might be brought to see the promises so clearly as to be led to accept them. Finally she ventured to speak.\n\n\"It is plain that a' the young man did, saving his rising and gaen to his faither, was to confess his fauts; and he was met wi' compassion even before he made any confession. So ye see, Rab, God is waiting to forgive if we forsake sin and rise up and go to him. I am sure that I, for ane, need a strang freend to flee to when doots and fears get hold o' me.\"\n\n\"And I feel the need o' sic a freend mair than ye think, Jeannie,\" said Rab. \"Wha will lead me to him?\"\n\n\"I hae pointed you to the Word o' God, my brither. Ye maun ask to be led by the Holy Spirit. Meantime ye hae my puir prayers that ye may be accepted,\" said Wullie.\n\nHonest Wullie soon found his hands more than full. Expenses had greatly increased, and were not likely soon to diminish. He now had the entire charge of providing for his brother's family. Besides, there were extra expenses in the way of medicines and occasional visits from the [Pg 41]physician. It required all his energy to meet these constantly recurring demands on his resources. The remainder of the small sum he had laid by was spent. Autumn came, and he found that his wages would barely purchase provisions for the winter. There could be no surplus for an emergency. Rab's family now numbered five instead of four, for another little girl had come to be cared for; and the father's illness increased. Wullie felt that he was being sorely tried. He was obliged to apply to his employer to advance him money.\n\nFarmer Lindsay was accompanied by a strange gentleman when honest Wullie met him and preferred his request. The money was immediately put into his hand.\n\n\"How is this,\" said the stranger when Wullie was gone, \"that you advance money in that fashion? If he cannot meet his expenses this year, how will he do it next year with this amount deducted?\"\n\n\"I admit,\" said Farmer Lindsay, \"that I couldna do it wi' a' my men; but wi' honest Wullie it is a' right. He has ta'en his brither's family into his hoose, and there is seckness amang them. The brither himsel is seck, and his wife has a wee bit bairn, and they hae na onything laid by. I am right sorry for Wullie,[Pg 42] for a better man never put his hand to a sickle. I would help him though I s'ould never be paid. But there is nae danger o' that. He hasna come to his name withoot gude reason. I ken him weel. He has a generous nature; and he is aye ready to help ithers when he has the means in his hands.\"\n\nHere the subject dropped. But the gentleman, who was a cousin of Mrs. Lindsay's, had also a generous nature, and he did not forget honest, struggling Wullie. The next day when he left he put a ten-pound note into Mr. Lindsay's hand, saying, \"Give this, with my compliments, to the man that has earned the name of honest Wullie.\"\n\nWullie went to town, paid the doctor's bill, bought a few delicacies for the sick, and some necessaries, among which was a pair of thick warm shoes for Jeannie. He paid out nearly all the money he had taken, but still more things were needed. When he reached home he gave the shoes to Jeannie. \"I hae brought you some shoon,\" said he. \"Noo your feet will no be weet.\" Jeannie had not expected them. Her happy surprise gave him no small pleasure. But the pleasure suddenly vanished; for no sooner had he taken his seat by the fire than Jamie climbed on his knee and asked,\n\n[Pg 43]\n\n\"Uncle Wullie, did you bring me too ony new shoon?\"\n\n\"Nae, my wee man, I couldna spare the siller.\"\n\n\"Will ye bring me some when ye gang again? My shoon are fu' o' holes.\"\n\n\"I canna promise, puir laddie,\" said he, stroking the child's head as he spoke.\n\nJamie hid his face on his uncle's neck and cried from disappointment.\n\nWullie felt very sorry for his little nephew. \"Dinna greet, laddie, dinna greet,\" said he. \"Ye will hae me keepin' you company if ye dinna stop.\" In reality he felt perplexed as well as sorry; for he could not help seeing that to keep comfortable would require his utmost efforts.\n\nThe signs of perplexity had not left his countenance, when Farmer Lindsay entered. Mr. Lindsay seemed the bearer of good tidings, so happy was his face. He wished them all a good evening, and then inquired particularly after Rab.\n\n\"I am nae better,\" said Rab.\n\n\"And hoo are a' the bairns, Mistress Murdoch?\"\n\n\"They are a' vera weel, I thank ye.\"\n\n\"And hoo hae ye made oot wi' your marketing in the town, Wullie?\"\n\n[Pg 44]\n\n\"I found things o'er dear; and I hae na got a' I s'ould hae fetched, for this wee man has but noo been greetin' for new shoon. I brought his mither a pair, and he lookit doun at his ain feet; then he climbed to my knee and spiered at me aboot shoon for himsel. It is nae wonder, as ye see,\" said Wullie, holding up both the small feet in his capacious hand and displaying the condition of the shoes.\n\nFarmer Lindsay smiled peculiarly. \"Come here, my wee man,\" said he. \"So ye hae been greetin' aboot new shoon, hae ye? Weel, your uncle will bring them the next time he gaes to town.\"\n\n\"I dinna ken hoo that will be,\" interposed Wullie.\n\n\"Weel, ye will hae the means to get them, at ony rate,\" replied Mr. Lindsay; \"for the man ye saw wi' me yesterday, when he learned more aboot you, gied me a ten-pound note, saying 'Gie that, wi' my compliments, to the man that has earned the name o' honest Wullie.'\"\n\nWullie was dumb with amazement. But collecting his thoughts he said, \"I hae nae suitable words to express my thanks; but if I ever see the gentleman I will do my best to thank him, for I am right thankfu'. But, Mr. Lindsay, I hae seen the time when I wouldna hae taen sic[Pg 45] a gift. But God has shawn me that it is pride, and not wisdom, that refuses the help that gude men offer to their struggling fellow-men. Especially would it be wrang for me, sin' I hae the comfort o' ithers to consider.\"\n\n\"That is my ain opeenion, Wullie; and I thought ye would hae the sense to see it in that light. I hae nae sympathy, nor patience either, wi' puir folk that haud their heids sae high, and willna accept help when it is offered to them, and then sink into want or disgrace through their ain fulish pride.\"\n\n\"Ye are right, Mr. Lindsay. If God puts it into the hearts o' gude men to help those wha are in need, and they willna receive that help, they stand in the way o' Providence, sin' they shut up channels through which the Lord would send blessings to them. Every ane can understand that it is mair gratifying to give than to acknowledge ane's needs so far as to accept gifts; but pride maun hae a fa'.\"\n\n\"Just so, Wullie. Now, if ye s'ould find yoursel again in want o' means, come to me. I wish ye a' a good-night.\"\n\n\"Hae ye ever heard o' sic a thing!\" exclaimed Wullie when the door had closed behind Farmer Lindsay. \"Yesterday I was that discouraged that I hardly kenned what to do nor[Pg 46] which way to turn. But I clung to the promise o' God, and I said to mysel, 'The siller and the gowd are his;' but I couldna see in what way he would send it to me in my sair need. My heart wouldna quite trust yet. I thought o' the wee helpless bairns, and I said again to mysel, 'He hears the young ravens when they cry, and he will hear the prayer o' his unworthy servant for those His ain providence has put into his care.' Then I gaed aboot my wark as light o' heart as the birds o' the air. But my faith was o'er weak, for when wee Jamie was disappointed I had a'maist gien o'er again to fear.\"\n\n\"Weel, Wullie, if ye lack faith, what would ye think o' me?\" asked Rab.\n\n\"Ah, Rab, ye hae na proved what comfort ane gets in just takin' God at his ward. I dinna see hoo folk can endure life withoot the Heavenly Father's smile. It is true they hae the bonny things in nature; but they are far bonnier when ane can not only see their beauty, but can trace in them the gudeness and wisdom o' the Creator, and can feel that he has this all-wise Creator for his freend. Mony a time when I am weary wi' my wark, I see a bonny wee flower, and the sight o' it gladdens me. I hear the blithe sang o' a bit bird, and that cheers me. I see the drooping plant revive, and I say to mysel, 'Though I[Pg 47] fa', I shall rise again.' I tell ye, there is naething like having the Bible hidden in your heart when your een are lookin' oot on the face o' nature. The ane makes you think o' the ither. They blend weel thegither, and strengthen ane's faith, for it isna hard to see that He that created the ane inspired the ither.\"\n\n\"Hoo differently you and I hae aye lookit on life, Wullie. Did ye ever think o' it?\"\n\n\"Ay, I hae thought o' it mony times. Ye hae been fond o' company, while I hae been fond o' quiet. I hae made a companion o' my Bible; and I gie it as my verdict that it is not only a safe, but a profitable ane.\"\n\nWullie's heart was full of glad thankfulness. He rose and stirred the fire, and added fuel. There should be no lack of anything now. \"Jamie, ye s'all hae new shoon, and wee Belle s'all hae new shoon; and Rab, ye s'all no want for medicines. Jeannie, ye will see till 't that there is plenty o' parritch made, for if the meal gies oot ye can hae mair. Weel, weel, I canna forget it. Is it no wonderfu' that the gentleman s'ould hae left the money for me! I hae nae doot he is a servant of the Lord, sin' he considers the puir. Oh, how I wish that ilka ane would set his heart on serving the Most High!\"\n\n[Pg 48]\n\nCHAPTER VI. A CLEAR SUNSET.\n\nWullie now felt a great relief with regard to ways and means. Ten pounds seemed quite a sum to those frugal cottagers. But as Rab's illness increased Wullie became very anxious about his brother's future welfare, and earnestly desired that he should experience a good hope through the Saviour of sinners. He missed no opportunity to set before him the love of Christ, and his willingness to save all who come to him with a humble and contrite heart. He proposed to bring the parish minister. But Rab said, \"Not yet. I like best to talk wi' yoursel, Wullie. I would be ashamed to talk to onybody aboot my past life.\"\n\n\"Are ye sorry for it as weel as ashamed o' it.\"\n\n\"Ay, I am baith ashamed and sorry.\"\n\n\"There is a godly sorrow that warketh repentance. Hae ye that sorrow?\"\n\n\"I dinna ken right weel what that s'ould be.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what it is as near as I can come to it. If the remembrance o' sin is painfu'[Pg 49] to us because it is hateful in the sight o' God; if our misspent, unprofitable lives grieve us because they hae grieved our Saviour, to whom we owe obedient, faithful service; if we wish to forsake sin, because it is sin, and not from fear o' punishment alane, then I think it is the sorrow that warketh repentance.\"\n\n\"I think I feel something like that. I dinna ken hoo it would be if I were oot again wi' my auld comrades; but noo as I lie here I am seck o' sin, seck o' the things I ance loved. I canna bear to think o' my past life. In the night season I often put oot my hand in the vain attempt to push it far frae me, but it willna gang oot o' my memory. Then I think o' Him wha deed to save us frae oor sins, and I remember that I hae never turned towards him, but awa frae him, and I feel that my condemnation would be just. But at ither times I feel that I will, I must, lay hold o' some promise; that I will lay me doun just outside the door o' mercy, and wait to see if the Maister willna lift the latch and bid me come in.\"\n\n\"Brither, it is yoursel maun lift the latch to the door o' your heart, and bid the Maister come in and possess it. Beyond a doot the Saviour is noo knocking to be admitted. Do ye no remember that passage o' Scripture that reads, 'Behold,[Pg 50] I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me'? Noo, my brither, in faith bid the Maister enter your heart, and all will be weel. Only believe, Rab. 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.'\"\n\n\"Wullie, I am gaen to believe noo.\" Then closing his eyes, he said aloud, \"Lord, I will believe thee. I do believe thee; and if I do not believe aright, wilt thou teach me how to believe?\"\n\nWullie went to the bedside, and, kneeling down, he poured out his soul in prayer that God would bless them all, and bless them then. When he arose from his knees Jeannie was weeping softly, but Rab had a glad light in his eyes. \"Wullie,\" he said, \"the darkness is o'erpast, and light is breaking through. Oh, the wondrous condescension o' the Saviour! Jeannie, my puir wife, ye maun find Jesus and hae him for your dearest freend.\"\n\n\"I hae found him, Rab. Ane can greet wi' joy as weel as sorrow.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Wullie, as he wiped away the great joy-born tears from his own cheeks. It was a sight for angels—and angels do know of such scenes, for \"There is joy in the presence of[Pg 51] the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.\"\n\n\"I think I would hae been comforted sooner,\" said Rab, \"if I could hae brought mysel to forgive Donald the wrang he has done me. But I couldna do it, although I aye remembered what oor Saviour himsel said, 'If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Heavenly Father forgive you your trespasses.' It was only this morning that I forgave him, and noo I am rejoicing in forgiveness mysel. I would like to tell Donald that I forgive him, for perhaps after I am awa he may feel troubled aboot it.\"\n\nDonald McPherson had always felt very guilty concerning his own part in Rab's illness. He never came near the cottage, and he took care to avoid honest Wullie. But now that Rab had expressed a desire to tell Donald that he had forgiven him, Wullie went to Donald's cottage and told him that Rab would like to see him. Donald looked embarrassed and troubled.\n\n\"He wants to upbraid me,\" said he, \"but God knows my ain conscience has upbraided me eneuch for that night's wark.\"\n\n\"Na, naething o' the kind. I could tell you what it is mysel, but he would rather tell it.\"\n\n\"I will come and see him. I hear he isna lang for this warld.\"\n\n[Pg 52]\n\n\"He willna be here lang,\" replied Wullie.\n\n\"God hae mercy on us a',\" said Donald, with emotion.\n\nThat night there was a timid knock at honest Wullie's door. \"Come in,\" said Wullie in a loud tone. The latch was lifted, and in walked Donald McPherson. Jeannie set a chair for him, and Wullie spoke pleasantly to him. But Donald was ill at ease. He seemed looking for some one he did not see. A voice from the bed said, \"Good evening to ye, Donald.\" Donald approached the bed, and Rab extended his hand.\n\n\"I am o'er sorry to see you here,\" said Donald, grasping the proffered hand. A shiver ran through him as he saw and felt how emaciated it was.\n\n\"I am o'er sorry to see you here,\" said Donald.\n\n\"My hand is o'er thin,\" said Rab, noticing his emotion.\n\n\"Ay is it, and it is a' my ain faut.\"\n\n\"Not a'thegither, Donald, for I s'ould hae been proof against temptation.\"\n\n\"Ye would hae dune weel eneuch if ye had been left alane.\"\n\n\"That is true as to the night I got my seckness; but I might hae fallen some ither time, for I hadna the grace o' God to keep me in the right way. Noo I willna fall into that sin ony mair—I canna. And ye maunna think ye are no [Pg 53]forgien your part in that night's wark, for I hae forgien ye, and that is what I wanted to tell you. God has forgien me, but he wouldna do it until I had forgien you. Noo I hope ye will ken what it is to hae God's forgiveness as weel as mine. Ye hae, as ye say, led me in the wrang way; let me noo seek to lead you in the right way. It is a fearsome thing to live withoot God for a freend. I hae found that oot the last year o' my life. To feel, as I hae felt, that life is fast passing awa, and to see nae hope in the darkness beyond, is dreadful, dreadful, Donald. Your life will hae an end too, Donald, though it mayna be for mony years. Then ye will stand alane before your Maker. Do ye no ken that there are robes provided, so that each wha will may wrap himsel around wi' them as he wraps his plaid aboot him? only thae robes cover us entirely. They are robes o' the Saviour's righteousness. Wi' sic a robe aboot us we may stand before the Judge o' all the earth and not fear condemnation. I dinna ken as I mak it plain to you, for I am but a beginner in the scule o' Christ; but I am in his scule, Donald; yes, I am; praised be the gude Lord for that! And what I canna learn here I can learn in the warld above.\"\n\n\"I hope I shall meet you there,\" said Donald, wiping the tears away with his hand.\n\n[Pg 54]\n\n\"Dinna put off repentance till ye come to your death-bed, Donald. Gie your heart to God noo; and then, whether ye are called sooner or later, ye are aye ready.\"\n\nDonald was much affected. He remained an hour or more talking with Wullie, and then left, promising to come again, and offering his assistance if it should be needed.\n\nDuring Rab's illness Jeannie was very quiet in her manner, but her heart was heavy and sad. Slowly but surely proof was added to proof that her husband was soon to die. With many fears and anxieties she had looked forward to the long, weary time that must elapse between the sad event about to befall her and the time when her children would be old enough to seek their own livelihood. But since she had obtained a hope of eternal life she had learned to regard the future with less anxiety, and to cast her cares on One stronger than herself. Still the sadness remained. She could not forget that disease was fast wasting all that was mortal of Robert Murdoch. That which is spiritual within us may assent to God's providences, and we think it to be in the ascendency, and so it is; but sometimes, when the chill and gloom of a starless night settle down upon our spirits, our natural desires assert themselves, and we clutch again our passing friends and [Pg 55]comforts. Poor Jeannie! More thorns than roses seemed to grow along her pathway. And now the saddest trial of all was before her. But she had promised in her heart that, if God would save her husband eternally, she would not murmur at the dispensation that was to separate him from her in this life. For this reason she strove to control her feelings; and the quivering of the face was often stayed before the tear-drop started.\n\nOnce, when her husband noticed these outward signs of inward grief, he called her to him. She drew her chair to the bedside, and laid her head on the pillow. \"My puir wife,\" said he, while he pressed her pale cheek with his thin hand, \"I hae never been as gude to you as I s'ould hae been, and noo I am gaen frae you. I ask your forgiveness. I leave you in the hands o' God, and under him to the care o' Wullie. I couldna leave you in better hands. And, Jeannie, if Wullie would ever wish to mak you his wife, hear till him.\"\n\nShe raised her eyes with a look of surprise and reproof.\n\nHe understood her, and continued, \"Weel, never mind noo what I hae said. Some time ye may remember it withoot sae muckle pain, and be glad ye kenned my mind aboot it.\"\n\n[Pg 56]\n\nThe winter passed slowly away. Rab's death was expected from week to week. The neighbors were untiring in their kindness and sympathy. Farmer Lindsay called often, and many a kind word he spoke to the afflicted family. Mrs. Lindsay sent many a dainty to tempt the sick man's appetite. The pastor, too, called, and was satisfied with the dying man's profession of faith.\n\n\"I am so thankful,\" said Rab, \"that I had time gien me for repentance. If I had been cut off suddenly I s'ould hae gane to eternal death.\"\n\nDonald McPherson fulfilled his promise and came often. \"I hae seen eneuch o' the evils o' strang drink,\" he said to Rab, \"and I want ye to carry wi' you to heaven my promise that, wi' God's help, I will never taste anither drap.\"\n\nWhen the milder days of spring succeeded the rigors of winter, Robert Murdoch's lamp of life flickered and went out. He met death with a calm resignation and a happy trust.\n\nMrs. Murdoch yielded to sorrow after her husband was dead. No one interfered with her grief until Wullie thought she had wept \"o'er lang.\" \"Compose yoursel, sister Jeannie,\" he said, speaking in a persuasive manner. \"I ken it is hard to bear; but neither yoursel nor the bairns will want for a freend while it is in the[Pg 57] power o' Wullie Murdoch to help you. He wha has gaen frae us can never return to us, but we can gang to him in the Lord's ain gude time.\"\n\nA simple funeral service was held at the church, and the body was committed to the earth whence it came.\n\n[Pg 58]\n\nCHAPTER VII. DONALD MACPHERSON.\n\nNo one, not even the widow, wept more at the grave than did Donald McPherson. The once light-hearted, mischief-loving, whiskey-drinking Donald was overcome with sorrow and contrition. He took Rab's death greatly to heart, and, standing by that open grave, he firmly resolved that from that hour he would change his manner of life; that he would fear and serve God, and never again place a stumbling-block in the way of his fellow-creatures. After the funeral he went to honest Wullie's cottage, \"to see if there was onything to be dune,\" as he said.\n\nWullie thanked him for his kindness, adding, \"The little that is to be dune I can do mysel. I would liefer be busy than not. But I am glad to see you, for a' that.\" Then, laying his hand on McPherson's shoulder, he said, \"Ye will no forget the lesson o' this day, Donald!\"\n\n\"I trust I never shall.\"\n\nThe widow had bowed to Donald as he entered, and then left the room. She went to attend the children; but she was glad of the excuse, for[Pg 59] memory was too busy with the past to render the presence of Rab's old comrade desirable on that sad day.\n\nDonald went slowly from the home of mourning to his own cottage. He hung his bonnet on a peg, then went and sat down beside his wife. She was holding a troublesome child and trying to sew at the same time. \"Here, gie me the bairn,\" said he. He took the child in his strong arms and dandled him, much to the satisfaction of wee Donald. Then with much seriousness he addressed his wife.\n\n\"Katy, I dinna think I will gie you as muckle trouble as I hae dune. I maun gie up auld habits. They wunna do ony langer. I hae just seen Mistress Murdoch, and I hae been thinkin' what if it had been yoursel, Katy, that this day was clad in garments o' dool instead o' her, where would the soul o' Donald McPherson hae been noo!\"\n\nThe person addressed was a tall, straight, well-formed woman, whose face showed both thoughtfulness and firmness. She only replied, \"It is weel to think.\"\n\n\"I hae thought, and I hae felt as weel. Noo dinna think there is nae gude in me, wifie, but trust me ance mair. I am no gaen to drink any mair whiskey. I hae promised him that they[Pg 60] this day laid law that I wouldna, and that I would gang to kirk. Noo I will tell ye my plans. I will gang to Daft Jamie's but ance mair, and that will be to pay fourpence ha'penny, for that is a' I owe them, I am blithe to say; and then never a penny mair will I gie for grog; but I will save a' that I can earn, and we will soon hae decent claes, and gang to the kirk like Christian folk.\"\n\n\"That sounds gude, and I hope ye will do as ye say; and ye may do it if ye look to the Strang for help.\"\n\nAfter supper Donald put on his bonnet and went to Daft Jamie's. Mrs. McAllister smiled very blandly as he entered.\n\n\"Gude evenin' to ye, Donald. Ye hae keepit yoursel a great stranger o' late. What will ye be wantin'?\"\n\n\"I am wantin' naething but to pay a bit debt. A man maun pay his debts, I suppose, though what he has bought has dune him no gude.\"\n\n\"Hoot, man! Hae ye taen to preachin'? Ye ken as weel as ony ane that it is gude whiskey we keep; and a drap o' gude whiskey hurts naebody.\"\n\n\"Na, Mistress McAllister, a drap wunna hurt ony ane; but wha stops at a drap, tell me?\"\n\n\"Weel, Donald, ye ken it is a decent hoose[Pg 61] we keep, and we dinna want ony drunken folk around us.\"\n\n\"Ay, I ken it; and that is ane reason why puir Rab went oot i' the cauld the night he got his death.\"\n\n\"Weel, weel, hae your ain opeenion aboot it, but dinna stand quarrellin' wi' me. Sin' ye dinna want onything ye may as weel be gaen.\"\n\n\"I will, Mistress McAllister, and there'll be mony a weet day afore I again cross your doorstane. Gude evenin' to ye.\"\n\nDonald was soon at home again, much to the joy of his wife; for she thought if he could go to Daft Jamie's and return without the scent of liquor about him, there was indeed some room for hope.\n\n[Pg 62]\n\nCHAPTER VIII. IMPROVEMENTS.\n\nWidow Murdoch now gave more time and attention to her children. The youngest had not yet been named, but had always been called \"the wee lass.\" Now that more notice was taken of her, she began to smile and play.\n\n\"It is time this bairn had a name, Wullie,\" said Jeannie one evening when the baby was lying on her lap. \"What would ye think o' callin' her Annie? It would be for Rab's mither, and it is a bonny name forbye.\"\n\n\"That I would like right weel.\"\n\nSo this important matter was happily decided, and Annie was the little one's name.\n\nSpring brought warm, bright days, Jamie and Belle played at the cottage door, their innocent prattle often beguiling their mother's sad hours.\n\nHonest Wullie was not long in paying by his labor the debt which he had contracted, and he felt glad that his accounts were again even. Farmer Lindsay let him have a small piece of ground near the cottage to be made into a garden. This[Pg 63] was to be the joint care of Wullie, Jeannie, and Jamie, for \"Jamie is auld eneuch noo to pu' the weeds frae the beds,\" said his uncle.\n\nBut with all the work to do that one could easily accomplish, widow Murdoch often felt lonely. She had been three years in honest Wullie's cottage, but she had made very few acquaintances. Mrs. Lindsay never came into the cottage except in time of sickness. Mrs. McPherson, like herself, had hitherto been kept closely at home by care and poverty, and there had been no intercourse between the two women. At this time, however, they were brought together.\n\nDonald was the first to propose a visit. One pleasant evening in the early summer, when Katy had just finished the first dress that Donald had ever bought for her, he surprised her by saying, \"Mak yoursel ready, Katy, and gang wi' me to honest Wullie's; then ye will become acquent wi' widow Murdoch. She is but poor, like yoursel, and I am thinking she maun be lanely. At ony rate, it is but neeborly to call and see her.\"\n\nMrs. McPherson readily assented. She put a clean cap and dress on the baby, and arrayed herself in her new gown. Donald combed his hair until it was smooth, and put on his best coat.\n\n\"Katy, ye look as fine the night as a leddy,\" said Donald as they were ready to start; \"but ye[Pg 64] aye did keep yoursel tidy, though ye hae na had muckle to do wi'. There is muckle difference in folk. Some people's claes fit them, while other people's claes seem to hing on them. Mrs. Murdoch is like yoursel. She has a way o' makin' the maist o' ilka thing. It wasna muckle she brought to Wullie's cottage, but ye s'ould hae seen the difference she made in the looks o' it.\"\n\nThe two soon found themselves at honest Wullie's cottage, where they met a kind reception and spent a pleasant evening. The conversation often turned on moral and religious topics, as would necessarily be the case where honest Wullie took part.\n\nDonald was full of new hopes and courage.\n\n\"Wullie, ye s'ould come and see hoo nicely we are getting alang,\" said he. \"We hae eneuch to eat and drink, and some new claes for Sunday forbye. Katy, there, thinks I am quite a man noo.\"\n\n\"I always thought ye would do weel eneuch if ye would let whiskey alane.\"\n\n\"I will let it alane frae this oot, or I dinna ken mysel.\"\n\n\"Donald, ye dinna depend a'thegither on yoursel, I hope,\" said Wullie.\n\n\"Nae, Wullie, I ken better than that; but I hae changed my purpose, and I hae asked help o'[Pg 65] the Strang Ane. That is what Katy said I must do. Puir lass! I am sure she has kenned the comfort o' gaen to him mony times when sairly tried wi' me.\"\n\n\"It is gude to go to the Lord in times o' trial,\" said Wullie; \"and it is gude to go to him wi' thankful hearts when the trials are o'erpast. I hae nae doot, Mistress McPherson, but that ye find it baith pleasant and profitable to come wi' your heart full o' gratitude and praise to him wha has heard your prayers.\"\n\n\"Ay, I like weel to acknowledge his gudeness to me in saving Donald frae the evil that threatened him; but it grieves me noo to think I had sae nearly distrusted Him because He didna answer my prayers at ance. Mony a time did I a'maist feel that there is nae gude in prayer, and that God wouldna hear a puir body like me. But I dinna think he has set it doun against me, sin' he has answered my prayer. Besides, he kens I was but a weak woman, and sairly tried forbye.\"\n\nTears filled Jeannie's eyes. Katy's experience had been her own. And although it recalled her trials, to which she would not allude, because we instinctively cover the faults and follies of our dear dead, she felt, nevertheless, drawn towards Katy. Both had had trials, but not more than they were able to bear; and the discipline of an[Pg 66] all-wise Father had chastened and strengthened them both.\n\n\"We a' hae cause for thankfulness ilka day o' oor lives,\" Wullie hastened to say, as he perceived Jeannie's emotion. \"Let nane o' us be remiss in the duty o' prayer and thanksgiving.\"\n\nThis visit proved the precursor of many others, and the two women became good friends. Wullie strengthened Jeannie's good impressions of Katy McPherson.\n\n\"She was aye a canny lass,\" he said. \"Folk wondered that she wedded wi' sic a giddy chiel as Donald was; but if he sticks to his ward noo, he will mak a gude living for her, for he can wark weel when he sets himsel to it, and naebody can ootstrip him in the harvest-field.\"\n\nDonald soon learned to go to honest Wullie for advice, and he was as anxious to meet him as he had been to avoid him. He seemed changed in many ways. His new hope and trust had lifted him above that frivolity which had always been so prominent a characteristic of his. He found the influence of his wife much more elevating than that of his boon companions, and he said to her, \"Ye s'all see what a man can be made oot o' me, frolickin' as I hae been. I would na wonder if folk s'ould yet ca' me 'douce Donald.'\"\n\nWullie's garden proved a success, and the[Pg 67] fresh, tender vegetables added much to the frugal fare. Then, as Donald had said, Jeannie made the most of everything. Her skill in cooking also added to their comfort. Her neat, orderly ways were everywhere apparent. It was a pretty sight to see the three rosy children, with clean hands and faces, clean pinafores, and carefully combed hair, gathered at the family board, Annie seated on her mother's knee, the others on their stools. They were trained to be obedient and respectful, to keep the Sabbath with due strictness, and, above all, to fear and honor God. Thus not only shadows, but sunshine, too, rested on the little moorland cottage. Peace and harmony reigned in the household, and signs of thrift were also apparent. Wullie could now sometimes allow himself the pleasure of bringing little gifts to the children, and their childish delight hardly surpassed his own.\n\nJeannie did not forget to thank God for the blessings she enjoyed. And although the recollection of the early death of her husband often brought sorrow to her heart and a shade of sadness to her countenance, the sorrow was softened by the cherished hope of his eternal happiness and a future reunion. Thus passed two years more, but these were years of comparative comfort.\n\n[Pg 68]\n\nCHAPTER IX. NEW TIES.\n\nOne evening, when the McPhersons were spending an hour or two at the cottage, Donald took it into his head to joke Wullie about matrimony.\n\n\"Hoot, man, what ails ye, to talk after that fashion?\" exclaimed Wullie.\n\n\"And what for no? Is it no a gude fashion? I daur ye to say it is no a gude fashion!\"\n\nWullie did not reply, but a smile was on his face.\n\n\"Honestly, noo,\" continued Donald; \"Katy and I hae talked it over mair than ance, and we baith think it is the best thing that could be dune. Ye ken there is naething against it, for Rab was no your vera ain brither.\"\n\nKaty smiled, but Jeannie knitted busily, showing neither pleasure nor displeasure.\n\nDonald's suggestion seemed to have struck Wullie favorably, for after the visitors had gone he ventured to renew the subject.\n\n\"Jeannie, what think ye aboot oor neebor's talk?\"\n\n[Pg 69]\n\n\"His talk aboot what? He says sae muckle, wha can mind it a'?\" she said with that persistent dullness of comprehension that is often assumed by her sex.\n\nWullie, seeing he would have no help in the matter, came to the point at once, \"His talk aboot wedlock, to be sure.\"\n\n\"It is but ane o' his daft notions,\" she replied, but in a tone less severe than the words.\n\n\"It isna sae daft a notion, perhaps,\" he said, following up his advantage. \"It is true I hae neither riches, wit, nor beauty. I hae naught but a hamely living to offer ye, and that ye s'all hae at ony rate if I can win it. I will always do my best to provide for Rab's family, but it might be mair proper to hae the family a' in ane. What do ye say till it?\"\n\n\"I will say naething against the wish o' him wha is gaen awa. He said, 'If Wullie would ever wish to mak ye his wife, hear till him.'\"\n\n\"Noo, then,\" said Wullie, \"I will tak the first kiss I hae had o' a woman sin' my mither died. Hoo soon s'all it be?\"\n\n\"As it suits yoursel. Ye ken my best earthly affections lie in the grave wi' your brither; but if ye can tak respect and esteem instead o' affection, I willna oppose your wishes.\"\n\n\"Weel, I will accept what ye hae to gie me,[Pg 70] and perhaps the affection will come after a while.\"\n\n\"Ye are mair than warthy o' it, Wullie; sae I hope it will come. But sin' I didna hae it, I wouldna deceive ye.\"\n\n\"Ye hae been honest aboot it at ony rate, sae it wunna fret me.\"\n\nA few days later Wullie returned from town with a nice dress-pattern for Jeannie, some tartans for the little girls, cloth to be made up for Jamie, and a new suit for himself. After a few weeks there were gathered in the best room of the cottage Farmer Lindsay and his wife, Donald and Katy McPherson, the children, and the parish minister. Before him stood honest Wullie and the widow, who was then to become Mrs. William Murdoch. After the ceremony and the congratulations were over came a supper such as had never before been seen in the cottage. After this was finished Farmer Lindsay took his seat by the window, and often looked out into the twilight. Presently he saw, as he expected, his herd-boy leading a fine young cow.\n\n\"I suppose ye hae room in your byre for anither coo?\" he asked, addressing Wullie.\n\n\"Ay, I hae room eneuch, if that was a' that stood in the way o' twa being there.\"\n\n\"Weel, then, ye will hae twa, for here comes[Pg 71] a lad wi' the heifer we ca' Spot. Did ye think I would forget my auld and tried servant at sic a time as this?\"\n\n\"Weel, weel, weel! This is wholly unexpectit! Mony thanks to you, Maister Lindsay.\"\n\nDonald McPherson rejoiced in the good fortune of his neighbor, but he felt somewhat crestfallen that he had brought nothing to give, and he expressed his regret to his host. But Wullie relieved him by saying, with a smile,\n\n\"We canna a' gie presents, Donald, but we can a' gie gude wishes, and I am sure ye gie me them, neebor.\"\n\nThe evening passed in pleasant talk, and when these neighbors separated it was with a kindly feeling towards each other that is often wanting in the higher circles of life.\n\nHonest Wullie continued to prosper, though in a small way. The years glided by, bringing nothing but pleasing changes, the most pleasing of which was the birth of a son. Jamie had long since left his uncle's knee to younger claimants. He was a strong, healthy lad, possessing his father's wit and sprightliness, and also uncommon beauty. His mother's eyes often rested on him with maternal fondness, if not with pride. He found plenty to do in collecting fuel, helping with the garden, and doing the work in and around the[Pg 72] cow-shed. He attended the little parish school a few months in the year. He was fond of books, too, although there was nothing in his surroundings to foster a love of study. True, Farmer Lindsay once patted him on the head, and said, \"If ye could stand a fair chance, Jamie, ye would mak a man no to be ashamed o';\" and the schoolmaster sometimes gave him the praise he merited. But the days came and went, bringing him nearer to the time when he must be put to steady employment to help to defray the expenses of the family, with which time we will open the next chapter.\n\n[Pg 73]\n\nCHAPTER X. JAMIE.\n\nJamie had now entered upon his thirteenth year, and was to commence life's labor as a shepherd-lad. Farmer Lindsay, knowing that it would pain the family to have the lad leave home, found a place for Jamie by giving other employment to his former shepherd-boy. So Belle and Annie went to school without Jamie, and he took his way to the field. He was faithful, as might have been expected, for honest Wullie had not failed in his duty to his brother's son. He had striven, both by example and precept, to inculcate in him right principles, knowing that right doing would be their legitimate outgrowth.\n\nThe summer passed pleasantly enough with Jamie, for he was a favorite with all on the farm. Even Mrs. Lindsay often called after him to add a slice of cheese to the frugal lunch he carried with him. But summer hurried by, and dull, short, foggy days succeeded the long, bright, sunny ones. One evening Jamie was belated in collecting the flock. The darkness was coming on apace, and he was hurrying along where the path,[Pg 74] slippery with the dampness, led over some steep, rough rocks; he missed his footing and fell.\n\nNight, black night, settled down upon the earth, but no Jamie came to the cottage. Honest Wullie put on his bonnet and retraced his steps to Farmer Lindsay's. Jamie was not there. Then the other farm-hands, headed by Wullie and Mr. Lindsay himself, set out in search of the shepherd-boy and the flock. They lighted up the darkness with torches, and looked to the right hand and to the left. They found the flock huddled together not far from the steep pass, which all had thought of, but none had dared mention. Vainly did they peer down the steep mountainside. Vainly did honest Wullie shout, \"Jamie! Jamie, bairn!\" No answer was returned. If the boy had fallen there, he had fainted, or was too badly hurt to answer. Wullie signified his intention of crossing the mountain and coming around at the base; but the air became so thick with mist that the torches would not burn, and loath as the anxious searchers were to turn back, they were forced to do so, for the path was too dangerous to be attempted in the darkness. Weary and heavy-hearted returned Wullie to the sorrowing mother. The night was spent by these sad cottagers in prayer, and with the first streaks of morning light Wullie again started out to renew his search.\n\n[Pg 75]\n\nDay broke as beautifully as if the preceding evening had not been dull and dismal. Before Wullie reached the pass the sun rose, scattering the mist, and bathing in mellow light moor and crag, mountain and glen. But the anxious father hastened on, not heeding the rich glory of the autumnal morning.\n\nOthers, too, in that vicinity had early bestirred themselves, not in search of the missing boy, but in pursuit of game. Laird Erskine, with his kinsman John Cameron from Edinburgh, were first at the foot of the mountain. What was their surprise to see a boy lying as if dead among the rocks! They hastened to him. He was not dead; he was breathing. Erskine lifted him from his rough bed and laid him on the smooth grass. Cameron looked at him with wondering eyes.\n\n\"Saw ye ever a finer lad! Who is he, Erskine?\"\n\n\"That is what I would like to ken mysel,\" said the other.\n\nThey spoke to him; they tried to rouse him; but he only moaned, and murmured, \"O mother, I dinna want to tend the sheep ony mair. I want to gang back to the scule.\"\n\nBefore they had succeeded in rousing him they saw the stalwart form of honest Wullie striding towards them. So anxious was he that he forgot[Pg 76] the usual courtesies, and did not raise his bonnet, but called out, \"Is he dead?\"\n\n\"No, he is not dead,\" was the cheering answer.\n\n\"Praise the gude Lord!\" came reverently from the lips of honest Wullie.\n\nOn reaching the boy he lifted his head in his arms, shook him gently, and called his name: \"Jamie! rouse up, Jamie!\" After much shaking and calling, Jamie opened his eyes and looked wonderingly around, as if trying to identify himself and his surroundings. Then gradually recovering consciousness, he recognized his father.\n\n\"Faither, I missed my footing and cam to the bottom. I am no sure but I fainted, for I canna remember what happened after I fell. When I was able to think I felt a pain in my back, and I was so sair that I could hardly stir. I didna dare to move in the darkness for fear I should get another fall, so I just prayed a' by mysel here, and I kenned weel ye would pray for me at hame, so I wasna afeard. But where is the flock?\"\n\n\"The flock is a' right. Dinna fash your heid aboot the flock,\" said Wullie, brushing away a tear.\n\nJamie tried to rise, but the first movement gave him pain. Wullie lifted him tenderly. \"I feel,\" he said, \"that I could tak ye in my arms[Pg 77] and rin wi' you to your mither, I am that glad to find you alive. It is naught but the care o' God, Jamie, that saved ye frae being dashed to pieces amang the stanes.\"\n\nErskine and his friend lingered till Jamie was on his feet again. \"I am thankful it is no worse,\" said Cameron, as he turned to go, \"and I will not forget you, my lad.\"\n\nJamie, in addition to his bruises, took a severe cold from spending the night on the cold, damp ground. He kept his bed a few days, and two weeks passed before he was able to be about. During this time the sheep had been brought in for the winter, and there was no more herding to be done that year.\n\nWhile Jamie was confined to the house by his injuries Cameron called at the cottage. He was greatly pleased with Jamie. He thought the boy had capabilities that were worth cultivating. He sounded the parents concerning their plans for their son's future, and ascertained that they indulged no higher hope than that he should be a trusty farm-hand like honest Wullie. But the boy's eyes followed every movement of the stranger with a look of expectancy, and when Cameron asked him if he would like to become a man of learning, Jamie quickly answered in the affirmative.\n\n[Pg 78]\n\n\"He can gang to scule this winter,\" said Wullie.\n\n\"That will do for the winter,\" replied Cameron, \"and when I come next year I will see what arrangement can be made to put him into a better school.\"\n\nAfter the gentleman's departure the parents were very grave and thoughtful. They did not know whether the interest the stranger took in Jamie portended good or ill. \"If he is no a godly man,\" said Wullie, \"I wouldna like to hae him meddle wi' the bairn; but if he is a gude man, and will tak care to keep him frae evil communications, I would be slow to mak objections or to pit onything i' the way o' the man's wishes.\"\n\nBut Jamie was full of bright anticipations. He talked so often about what Mr. Cameron said, and asked so many questions concerning the probable meaning of his words, that the mother was weary of hearing it. \"Jamie, Jamie, will ye never hae dune talking aboot that man?\" she asked. \"Ye will drive me beside mysel. I wouldna be surprised if he had forgotten all aboot you.\"\n\nJamie did stop talking, but he was sad and dispirited for many days.\n\n\"What is wrang wi' ye, Jamie? Ye needna[Pg 79] think it is a sin to smile,\" his mother said, noticing his listlessness.\n\n\"I dinna think I will ever smile ony mair, sin' ye think Mr. Cameron has forgotten me,\" said Jamie, turning away his face to hide a starting tear.\n\n\"Ye are takin' it harder than I meant. I am no sure but he will be looking after you o'er soon, and I canna bear to think o' it. He will be wanting to tak you frae hame; that is the warst o' it.\"\n\n\"Weel, mither, every laddie canna bide at hame. I have read in books about folk that hae been mair useful for their knowledge, and I think knowledge maun be a grand thing to hae. I read in the sculemaster's books about men that could call the stars by name, and measure the heights o' the mountains; and I read in a history about mony great men, and I like weel to think that Jamie Murdoch may some day be a great man too.\"\n\n\"It would be better to wish to be a gude man.\"\n\n\"But, mither, can a man no be baith gude and great?\"\n\nEarly in the spring Farmer Lindsay brought a letter for honest Wullie. It bore the Edinburgh postmark. As a letter was a rare thing at that time and place, Mr. Lindsay waited till Wullie spelled it out. It contained a proposition from[Pg 80] Mr. Cameron. He would pay Wullie as much as Jamie could earn, and his tuition besides, if the parish minister would undertake to instruct him preparatory to his entering a high school at Edinburgh. This plan pleased them all exceedingly well, and the more so because Mr. Cameron said they must not hesitate to accept his offer, as he was a friend to education, and had means to spare. He further said that he had taken a great fancy to their son, and would be disappointed if they were unwilling to let him receive a liberal education.\n\nThe minister readily undertook the charge, and was glad of the opportunity to eke out his small salary. Jamie did not disappoint his friends. He proved an apt pupil. His parents soon became reconciled to his treading a path in life different from their own. The minister not only approved of the plan, but congratulated Jamie on his prospects. Little by little Jamie came to receive more deference in his own family, and also in the neighborhood. Donald McPherson met him one day, and after a cordial greeting said to him,\n\n\"So ye are to be the man o' the parish, are ye, Jamie? We will a' hae to lift oor bonnets to you. Weel, ye will hae a grand chance, for Laird Erskine says that whatever John Cameron[Pg 81] taks intil his heid has to gang through. He tells me Cameron lost a son aboot your ain age, and that is why he taks sic an interest in laddies.\"\n\nAutumn brought John Cameron again to Laird Erskine's. This time he saw more of Jamie, and he told his kinsman that he would be glad to adopt him as a son. But the warm-hearted, simple-minded parents would not consent to this.\n\nThe time came when Jamie was to go to Edinburgh. Mrs. Murdoch took leave of her son with many tears. Honest Wullie had no tears, though he felt the pain of separation scarcely less than did the mother. He repeated his admonitions to virtue, and again warned him to shun every appearance of evil. \"Warldly wisdom is gude in its place,\" he said in conclusion, \"but ye maunna forget to seek anither kind, for 'the wisdom that is frae aboon is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full o' mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.'\"\n\n[Pg 82]\n\nCHAPTER XI. HOME LIFE.\n\nWe will now leave Jamie in school and turn to the other children. Belle was now as old as Jamie was when he was put to work, and Jeannie feared that Wullie would soon speak about putting her to service. This would have seemed well enough, quite in keeping with the circumstances of the family, had it not been for Jamie's good fortune, which made it appear rather out of place. So the mother and daughter knitted for Mrs. Lindsay and others as they had opportunity, and the mother was always sure to buy Belle's clothes with the proceeds of the knitting. Annie was a bright little girl ten years old. She too was busy, for none were allowed to eat idle bread in honest Wullie's cottage. Wullie's own son David, or Davie as he was called, was also taught to save steps. But the most stir and activity was in the morning. No one was allowed to lie in bed after the sun was up. The mother called to any one who was likely to transgress this rule, \"Come, dinna let the sun beat you up the morn.\" The girls attended school quite regularly in [Pg 83]summer, but in winter they often did not attempt to walk the long distance. Then, when there were neither lessons nor out-of-door work, the balls of yarn fast disappeared and took other shapes. Annie, young as she was, did most of the knitting for the family.\n\nHonest Wullie thought himself a happy man; and so he was. In the evening, when he put labor and care alike aside, and looked around at the industrious, cheerful inmates of his well-kept home, he often thought, \"Surely the lines hae fallen to me in pleasant places.\" Every day brought its work. In the morning the poultry was to be fed and the cows must be milked, besides the work indoors. In summer the garden was to be kept free from weeds, and the berries and wild fruits were to be gathered in their season. When there was no work to be done, the children were sometimes sent out with the order to \"gang and play themselves;\" but very often they were told to learn a Psalm first.\n\nOne thing they looked forward to, whether at work or at play, and that was a letter from Jamie. They had little else to break the monotonous days and the long winter evenings. True, Archie Lindsay came in sometimes, bringing his little sister with him; but that soon passed, and then nothing was heard but the click of the [Pg 84]knitting-needles. Many times when the children were alone they told over threadbare riddles, simple rhymes learned at school, and the marvellous tales that tradition handed down to every new generation. They had no story books. They were always glad when Donald McPherson came in for an hour, for he never failed to have some news to tell. So passed the time until the early summer, when the children began to count the days that must elapse before Jamie should be at home again. All were anxious for his coming, but no one looked forward with so much longing as did the mother.\n\n[Pg 85]\n\nCHAPTER XII. THE FIRST VACATION.\n\n\"Jamie will be home the day!\" the happy children shouted, as the wished-for morning at last arrived. He was expected to walk from the town where the stage-coach left him; but Mr. Lindsay remembered the lad that was coming from Edinburgh, and he made it convenient to have business in town that day. He brought Jamie home earlier in the day than he was expected.\n\nMrs. Murdoch was busy preparing some unusual delicacies to do honor to her returning son, and she did not notice his arrival. Jamie entered the open door, and, seeing that his mother did not turn to observe who came in, he thought he would surprise her. He walked softly, and she supposed him to be one of the other children. Jamie shook a warning finger at his sisters, and approaching his mother, he suddenly threw his arms about her neck and kissed her. She started, looked around, and joyfully exclaimed,\n\n\"O Jamie! hoo ye hae frightened me!\" Then she kissed and embraced him in return. \"Hoo[Pg 86] are ye, my bairn? My! but ye are a'maist grawn a man! Ye are as tall as your mither!\"\n\nThe children then came forward and gave him a happy greeting. Belle, who had also changed, blushed as her brother complimented her on her improved appearance. Annie placed herself in front of him, with her arms akimbo, and with face brimful of happiness asked, \"What think ye o' me?\"\n\n\"Think of you! I think you are the same sunny-faced little Annie, and I doubt not you are as good at a race as ever. I will try you to-morrow. Come here, Davie. Do you mind me?\"\n\n\"Ay, I mind Jamie,\" said he, climbing on his knee.\n\n\"And Jamie minds that you like sugarplums.\"\n\n\"I like them oftener than I can get them.\"\n\n\"Well, let me see what I can find,\" said Jamie, putting his hand into his pocket and giving him a handful of candies. Then, tossing some to his sisters, he remarked, \"You are looking very well, mother.\"\n\n\"I feel weel, and I hae plenty to eat and plenty to do; why s'ouldna I look weel?\"\n\nThere was no lack of talk and no end of questions. As the afternoon advanced Annie was[Pg 87] reminded that she must go and bring the cows from the pasture.\n\n\"Jamie, will ye gang wi' me for the coos?\"\n\n\"Yes, Annie, I will.\"\n\n\"Noo for a race,\" said Annie.\n\nLong before they reached the pasture-lands Jamie was left in the rear. Annie, speeding on, came face to face with honest Wullie, who was working near the path. \"Hoot, lassie! Why are ye rinnin' in sic a fashion?\" he called out. \"What would Jamie say if he s'ould see you gaen at sic a gate?\"\n\n\"It is Jamie that is rinnin' wi' me,\" she replied, laughing.\n\nJust then Jamie appeared, and Wullie's face relaxed. He hastened to meet him. \"Welcome hame, Jamie! welcome hame!\" he said, grasping his hand. \"Hoo ye hae changed! but ye look weel.\"\n\n\"I am well. How are you, father?\"\n\n\"I am vera weel. Thanks to the gude Lord, we are a' weel.\"\n\nThen followed mutual inquiries and answers. Annie went after the cows, and Jamie remained with his father, whose day's work was not quite finished.\n\nThere was a happy family in honest Wullie's cottage that evening. The supper was the best[Pg 88] the cottage could afford, for what company was so grand as Jamie!\n\nJamie had improved very much in appearance, in manner, and in knowledge. His conversation interested both parents and children. His accounts of the city, of its buildings, and bits of history connected with them, were highly entertaining to the family whose horizon was so limited. All listened while he was talking. The conversation was prolonged to a late hour, and the children were allowed to sit up much after their usual bedtime.\n\nIn the morning all again paid homage to Jamie. He was the hero of the house and of the neighborhood. The neighbors all found opportunity to call at the cottage to see the lad who had been away at school. Archie Lindsay frequently spent the evening there, listening with wonder to all that Jamie had to tell.\n\nThe children were allowed more liberty for Jamie's sake, and the whole summer was a long gala day. Very little time was lost, however, for the girls were taught to use their fingers and ears at the same time. Even Jamie had not forgotten how to work. He spent many a day in the garden, the children at his side; for to them work was pleasure, if they could only be with brother Jamie.\n\n[Pg 89]\n\nThe time for the return to Edinburgh came full soon for the children, and indeed for all. They had never tired of hearing the wonders of the outside world. Their narrow horizon had been widened. But Jamie was gone, and their lives slipped back into the old grooves.\n\n\"Come, lassies, buckle to noo, and mak up time. I liked weel to see ye hae pleasant times wi' Jamie; but if ye are sensible lassies ye will see it wunna do to spend mair time in sic an easy way. There maun be nae lack o' the knitting-siller: ye ken weel what maun be dune wi' it.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the mother's vigilance in preventing any approach to idleness, or even leisure, the children were well and happy.\n\n[Pg 90]\n\nCHAPTER XIII. BELLE.\n\nBelle Murdoch had now reached her sixteenth year. She was tall, well-formed, fair, and a picture of perfect health. No allusion to her going out to service had yet been made. But the family expenses becoming each year heavier, the proposal so much dreaded by Mrs. Murdoch at length came.\n\nWullie had been ailing for a month, and he felt somewhat despondent. So one evening when the children were in bed, and husband and wife were sitting by the cheerful fire, Jeannie busied with mending little Davie's clothes, Wullie broached the subject as gently as he could.\n\n\"Ye are aye warking, Jeannie,\" he said, \"and I am no idle when I am weel, and still I hae muckle to do to gie my family a' the comforts that I would like to gie them. I misdoot the judgment we use in keeping Belle at hame. She is a strang healthy lass noo, and I dinna see hoo I am to keep my heid aboon water unless the lassies as they get age and strength gang to service as ithers do, or find a better way to earn honest pennies.\"\n\n[Pg 91]\n\n\"Weel, Wullie, I wouldna mind the lass gaen to service but for the way it has turned oot wi' Jamie. He will, nae doot, hae the sculing o' a born gentleman, and so be fitted to win his bread like ither gentlemen; and it looks no quite right to hae ane o' the same family oot at service, and that ane a lass, forbye.\"\n\n\"I see, wifie, I see. And I hae thought o' the same thing. But right is right, and wrang is wrang; and rather than we s'ould gang beyond oor means and mak debts, we might better let her gang to a gude place.\"\n\n\"That is o'er true,\" said Jeannie, \"and if things get muckle waur we'll hae to sacrifice oor wishes to oor necessities.\"\n\nA few days after this conversation Farmer Lindsay came to honest Wullie's cottage. \"Mistress Murdoch, I hae come to ask a favor,\" he began. \"The gude-wife is taen ill, and we are pressed wi' the wark; will ye be sae kind as to let Belle come and stop wi' us a wee while till the wife is on her feet again?\"\n\n\"Oh, ay, she can gang, and we are glad to oblige ye. Ye will find her no afraid o' wark; and she kens hoo to tak hold o' things as well as maist lassies o' her age.\"\n\nAccordingly Belle made a few hasty preparations, and went immediately to Farmer Lindsay's.[Pg 92] Mr. Lindsay conducted her to his wife's room. \"Noo ye needna fash your heid aboot the wark,\" said he. \"I hae brought ye a strang lass wi' willing hands, and a cheerfu' face that it will do your een gude to look at.\"\n\n\"Ay, lass, it does a body gude to see ye the morn, ye are sae fresh and rosy,\" said Mrs. Lindsay. \"I ken naebody that I would like better than yoursel to come into the hoose and help till I am able to tak my place again. Betty is a gude strang lass, but she canna do the wark o' twa, and sae we will be muckle obliged to ye if ye will stay wi' us and help her.\"\n\nBelle proved the truth of her mother's statement concerning her. After Mrs. Lindsay recovered she still kept Belle with her. \"She minds me o' the sang-birds, she is sae blithe and cheerfu',\" said Mrs. Lindsay to her husband.\n\n\"Ay, she is a winsome lass, and I would like weel to hae ye keep her. Ye can keep baith lassies if ye like. Ye are no strang yoursel, and there is wark eneuch for baith. But I dinna ken whether Wullie means to let her gang oot to service; I asked her to come only to do us a favor.\"\n\n\"Weel, if she will stop here she will be treated mair like a daughter than a servant.\"\n\n\"I wouldna wonder to see her a daughter[Pg 93] some day, wifie. Archie thinks there is nae lass like Belle.\"\n\n\"He is welcome to think sae. I would liefer ken wha comes into the family. I dinna want a lass frae the toun, wha wouldna ken, perhaps, whether the dairy was clean or no, and that couldna mak butter nor cheese fit to gang to the market. Fine parritch and bannocks would then be made in this hoose; and wha kens whether the totties\" (potatoes) \"would come to the board cauld or het!\"\n\n\"Ye are looking a lang way aheid, and coonting withoot your host,\" said Mr. Lindsay, laughing. \"It would be weel to find oot first if they will let the lass stop wi' us.\"\n\nMrs. Murdoch had noticed the friendship between her daughter and Archie Lindsay, and she secretly hoped it would ripen into love. Now that Belle was so well liked by both the farmer and his wif"
