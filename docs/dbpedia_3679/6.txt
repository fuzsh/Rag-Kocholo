Cameron McAllister is a British television screenwriter, director and producer, best known for producing television series such as Daylight Robbery, Jericho and ITV science-fiction drama Primeval. He lives in Brighton with his wife and four sons.

Career[edit]

McAllister began directing in television in the early 1990s, on series like Gamesmaster and Brookside. Towards the end of the decade, he transitioned into writing. In 2001, USA Network bought the rights to Daylight Robbery, commissioning an eight-part remake, with McAllister acting as a consultant producer. However, the remake was unexpectedly cancelled mid-production, and did not make it to air.[1] He has since written for Hollyoaks Later (As the title suggests, the late night spinoff allowed for more sexual content, 'edgier' storylines and stronger language than the main series), Mile High, Spooks: Code 9, Holby City, Emmerdale and in 2009 co-wrote an episode of New Tricks. From 2009 to 2017, McAllister worked as a core writer on soap opera Emmerdale. He transitioned onto fellow ITV soap opera Coronation Street that same year.

He has also written two novels, The Tin Snail and The Demon Undertaker.[2]
