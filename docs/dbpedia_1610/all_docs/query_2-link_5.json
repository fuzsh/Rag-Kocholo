What were the consequences of the First World War? When the First World War ended, Europe did not return to peace. In fact, by some estimates, the five years following 1918 were deadlier than the 4 years of war preceding it. In this week's episode of IWM Stories, Assistant Curator Geoffrey Spender takes a closer look at three of these conflicts; The Irish war of Independence, The Russian Revolution and The Greco-Turkish War.\n\n© OP-TELIC 03-010-17-145\n\nContemporary conflict\n\nTimeline of 20th and 21st Century Wars\n\nMilitary conflict took place during every year of the 20th Century. There were only short periods of time that the world was free of war. The total number of deaths caused by war during the 20th Century has been estimated at 187 million and is probably higher. Explore the timeline of 20th and 21st century wars using IWM's extensive online collection.\n\n© IWM (Q 110864)\n\nContinuing Conflict: Europe after the First World War\n\nContinuing Conflict: Europe after the First World War\n\nThe First World War ended - but it did not mean an end to fighting in Europe.\n\nShare this"
