        "text": "Harbors are fascinating. Every one I have ever seen has something new to be seen.\n\nOne might forget that Murmansk is Russia's only year-round open seawater port. So guess where they do all of their maintenance? Yes, Murmansk! As my cruise ship was leaving Murmansk I saw a Russian Aircraft Carrier, a couple battle ships, and TWO submarines ... well actually THREE if you count the one that was being worked on in dry dock.\n\nJust thinking what might be under the lids of those sub hatches is both exciting and terribly frightening.\n\nWe were departing on what only could be described as a \"Chamber of Commerce: day. That's an American expression meaning that the weather was fabulous. We weren't very close to any of the ships, but a telephoto lens gave me (and now you) a close up view.\n\nTo prove it, look at my attached picture of my cruise ship THE PACIFIC PRINCESS. I don't think the weather to take that picture could be better in any harbor, let alone Murmansk. Fyi, it was docked directly across from THE LENIN, the retired nuclear ice breaker.\n\nKola Bay is an interesting anomaly-- the gulf stream sweeps up around Scandinavia, and sweeps into Kola Bay. The bay itself never freezes, even when the air temperature is -20 C. I'm told that on such days steam rises from the warm water.\n\nMurmansk is a town of 300000 with a large port situated on the bay-- inside the arctic circle. I was surprised that this is an important port for transshipment of coal. Murmansk-- as you'd expect, even in June, cool weather (I was there Jun 3, with temperature just at freezing, a stiff wind, and light snow). Worth the trip for history buffs.\n\nI spend one evening discovering different places on the city site of the bay with the help of a friend. It is totally worth spending time here: overseeing the port, the plants and different industries close to water. Now it seems a bit deserted but seems that in time of the USSR there were vibrant life. One thing with was striking for me that there were no close to water promenade - there is almost no way to get close to the water. But the rest was ok. And if you have car and time to go the other side, do it. I am sure it is amazing. We just crossed be bridge close to Cola town and went back.\n\nThe Kola Bay is the main natural attraction of the Murmansk region, to which the city owes its appearance. From school geography lessons, everyone knows that the Barents Sea does not freeze due to the warm Gulf Stream. If you come to Murmansk, then you will see the bay in any case, but I think there is no point in writing anything else about it.\n\nKola Bay is a narrow fjord bay of the Barents Sea, with a width of 0.2 to 7 km. and 57 km long. on the Murmansk coast of the Kola Peninsula. It owes its name to the settlement of Kola, which arose in the 21st century. The shores are indented by numerous bays, and the water area is replete with islands. The western shore is steep and rocky, the eastern shore is relatively flat. Two main rivers flow into the bay - Tuloma and Kola. The largest seaport beyond the Arctic Circle, Murmansk, the closed city of Severomorsk and the port of Polyarny are located here. It is interesting that the Kola Bay has one important feature: in winter the water in it practically does not freeze, which is due to the presence of the North Atlantic warm current. There are only five known cases of the bay freezing, the last of which occurred in January 2015.\n\nIn Murmansk there are several observation platforms that offer views of the bay, port and city, the main of which are located on Cape Verde, next to the monument to the “Defenders of the Soviet Arctic” and next to the monument “Waiting”."
