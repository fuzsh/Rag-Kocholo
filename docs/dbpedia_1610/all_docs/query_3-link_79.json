Photograph of the Inchgarvie superstructure, showing erection of 'skewbacks'. Mistakenly dated 14 Dec. 1887 [really 1886]. This is the first view in the series of Inchgarvie superstructure. To any one familiar with the island the difficulties in the way of securing good pictures in boisterous winter weather must be obvious, and if this photograph, which was obtained in a storm of hail and sleet, is not therefore all that might be wished, due allowance must be made. The \"skewbacks\" are here complete, and the connecting members between north and south piers seen at full length. Staging for lifting platforms is in course of erection, a portion of same being already in position. Transcription from: Philip Phillips, 'The Forth Railway Bridge', Edinburgh, 1890.. Dated: 1890. Topics: national library of scotland, construction of the forth bridge, high resolution, industrial history, construction sites, construction, bridge construction, bridge",
