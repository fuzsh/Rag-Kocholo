You may choose to not have the tracking include your user identification.\n\nTPC also collects certain information about your computer hardware and software.

They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose, in accordance with all current global data protection regulations.\n\nTPC may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on TPC or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of TPC, including its paintsquare.com website; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of TPC services or members of the public.\n\nPersonal information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which TPC or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities; by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.\n\nAs part of this agreement, you are also providing TPC with the authorization to send you information regarding its products and services via fax if you choose to provide us with your fax number.\n\nControl of your Personal Information\n\nTPC offers its customers choices for the collection, use and sharing of personal information. You may choose not to receive marketing material from TPC or on behalf of third-party business partners. You may also stop the delivery of future promotional email from TPC by following the specific instructions in the email you receive.

Subsequent SARs from an individual within a 12-month period will be charged USD15 per additional SAR.\n\nTPC will aim to provide the relevant data within 14 days. TPC will always verify the identity of anyone requesting this data before providing any such information.\n\nSecurity of your Personal Information\n\nTPC is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, located in controlled facilities. All internal and external sites that process personal information are encrypted through a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.\n\nUse of Cookies\n\nPaintSquare.com uses \"cookies\" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.\n\nOne of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, a cookie helps paintsquare.com to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as your username and password. When you return to paintsquare.com, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the paintsquare.com features to which you subscribe.\n\nYou have the right to accept or decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to experience all interactive features of the TPC online services or websites you visit. Further, if you choose to decline cookies, TPC will issue one cookie that contains no personal information in order to remember your chosen option.\n\nUse of Web Beacons\n\nPaintSquare.com web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons -- sometimes called single-pixel gifs -- that allow TPC to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. TPC may include web beacons in promotional email messages or paintsquare.com newsletters to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon.\n\nWeb beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. Web pages at other TPC websites may also contain web beacons placed there by third parties to compile aggregated statistics and to help determine the effectiveness of our joint promotional or advertising campaigns. TPC prohibits third-party web beacons from being used to access your personal information.\n\nUse of Third Party Ad Networks\n\nThe majority of the online banner advertisements you see on paintsquare.com web pages are displayed by TPC.\n\nIn addition, TPC may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on TPC web pages. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows members of the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads have been clicked. This information allows ad networks to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. TPC does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.\n\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act Notice\n\nThis PRIVACY NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS supplements the information contained above and applies solely to visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (\"consumers\" or \"you\") when you visit the paintdquare.com website or subscribe to receive the paintdquare.com services (collectively, our \"Services\").
