        "text": "A bridge in northern Russia has disappeared in what nearby residents say was a case of theft.\n\nThe rail bridge near an abandoned Murmansk region village had been dismantled several years ago, the mvestnik.ru news website reported Monday. Aerial footage shared on social media on Monday shows the opposite sides of the structure with its span over the Umba river missing.\n\nResidents believe the span was stolen because photographs said to be taken in mid-May showed a metal structure sticking out of the water. Monday’s photographs show that the metal structure has disappeared.\n\n“Natural phenomena could not have brought down the bridge,” the authors of the social media page that shared the images said. “Metalworkers likely pulled the structure into the water, where they slowly took it apart for scrap parts.”\n\n“Even if you drag an icebreaker here, it’s strange that a nearby road bridge standing at a lower height wasn’t knocked over,” they wrote.\n\nA lawsuit has been filed with local police, who were quoted as saying that the bridge owner may have dismantled it himself.\n\nA Message from The Moscow Times:\n\nDear readers,\n\nWe are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an \"undesirable\" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a \"foreign agent.\"\n\nThese actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work \"discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership.\" We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.\n\nWe, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.\n\nYour support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.\n\nBy supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.\n\nOnce\n\nMonthly\n\nAnnual\n\nContinue\n\nNot ready to support today?\n\nRemind me later.\n\n×\n\nRemind me next month\n\nRemind me\n\nThank you! Your reminder is set.\n\nWe will send you one reminder email a month from now. For details on the personal data we collect and how it is used, please see our Privacy Policy."
