        "text": "Digital Photographs Relating to Cooperative Threat Reduction Program Activities in the Former Soviet Union, ca. 1996 - 2001 (374-GTD)\n\nThis series contains digital photographs documenting the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)-monitored disarmament of the former Soviet Union's nuclear weapons systems, other weapons of mass destruction, and associated infrastructure in accordance with the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II). In focus are former inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos, previously nuclear-armed aircraft, previously nuclear-armed submarines and other vessels, weapons factories, railways, storage facilities, and support structures and systems in various stages of dismantlement; heavy equipment, vehicles, and processes deployed in dismantlement work; and weapons sites reduced to ruins, or cleared away entirely. Shown, as well, are inspection activities of DTRA contractors, working in cooperation with personnel from Russia, Ukraine, and other former states of the Soviet Union. Along with the coverage of dismantling progress and results--and the close verification thereof--at locations such as Zheleznogorsk and the Murmansk Naval Yard in Russia and the Priluki Air Base in Ukraine, there are views of the visits of the CTR's leading champions in Congress, Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and Richard Lugar of Indiana, to former Soviet nuclear sites. The finding aid for the series is available in the Still Pictures Research Room. This series is fully digitized.\n\nPhotographs of Atmospheric Nuclear Testing at Pacific Island and Nevada Test Sites, 1946 - 1962 (374-ANT)"
