        "text": "Saturday, February 04, 2017\n\nMurmansk, North-West Russia, Russian Federation\n\nKola Peninsular\n\nIt was not a good start to our day as the taxi took us to the station that the train for Helsinki leaves from… not ours! We were going to Murmansk and were a little concerned as Russian trains run on time . No worries though as we were there in time to board. For whatever reason known only to Yuriy, my Russian train expert in London who I had booked through, I had only purchased two of the four berths in this cabin so we were sharing with two teenage boys. They were going to Arpatity, the same stop as us, to enjoy some snowboarding as the school holidays had just begun. One of the lads, Vlad, had a smattering of english so we sort of got their story. They were both very polite and courteous, offering us food that their thoughtful mothers had prepared for the overnight train trip. Still, it was quite a squeeze with our bags as well as their snow boards and equipment.\n\nOnce again we arrived exactly on time and had only five minutes to detrain. Most of our carriage was getting off at Arpatity as well, so the passageway and doors were packed.\n\nOur driver was there to greet us and we left the station for our next adventure.\n\nA short time later we arrived at 'Wild and Free,' an outdoor adventure centre, to begin our experience on snowmobiles into the Khibiny Mountains of the Kola Polar Region north of the Arctic Circle .\n\nKitted up in warm clothing and helmets, all we needed was a talk on how to use a snow mobile. There were six of us as well as our leader in the group. He spoke to the others in Russian for about ten minutes, I think explaining the features of the Skidoos and giving riding tips. Now as he had no English and we had no Russian, our explanation was “this for go, this for stop” - all of about one minute.\n\nWe were away, with Pam on the seat behind me, I had the “go” part sorted at least. Followed the leader down the short road before heading out onto a frozen lake...this was easy - stay behind and in his tracks. We crossed what must have been a small island with a few trees - no problem - then back onto the lake’s surface and we raced away. We must have made the edge of the lake, as we passed over a small rise before the passengers had to get off to cross the railway lines. Safety first is this company’s motto.\n\nCruising though a small village we hit the forest. Now the fun began. We wound our way along what must have been a forest track before starting to run along the side of a creek. It was Spring and the snow and ice was beginning to melt. Pristine landscape, spoilt only by our roaring machines. We crossed a couple of ice bridges and I was starting to become conscious of the fact that I hadn’t quite worked this machine out, still all was going well\n\nWe come to a small crossing and the leader told the passengers to get off. He crossed first, then took the snowmobile that a couple of ladies were driving across next. He indicated for me to follow. I started to get off but he waved me over. Mistake number one. This crossing had a sharp right hand turn before the ice bridge which was just wide enough for the snowmobiles’ tracks. I began, made the turn then started across - but I had miscalculated and the back started to slide over the edge. The machine started to slide. I jumped off, as the machine and I headed for the freezing stream. I thought to myself \"What am I doing? It was last century that I was in my thirties and full of daring do.\"\n\nNow some good luck, the stream was only knee deep. That was the only good thing. I had gone face first. I jumped up quickly, my boots now full of extremely cold water.\n\nFirst things first, we had to recover the snowmobile . This was done quite efficiently, not the first time I think. Other riders offered me dry socks which I accepted gladly. I put my feet into plastic bags as my boots were now saturated. We were away again with my toes starting to freeze.\n\nWe rode through the forest which opened up to beautiful mountain views, stopping a couple of times for photos. It was wonderful, except my feet were getting even colder. I kept wriggling them to try and get some warmth and to make sure that they were still on the end of my feet.\n\nOur misfortunes do not end with a pleasant ride through the forest. Pam and I came off twice more - I kept blaming her for not leaning correctly, but maybe it was my lack of driving skills. Still it was only snow and we laughed each time, although our leader didn’t. The girls on the other snowmobile went bush a couple of times, ran into the back of Pam and me and ended up sunk into the mush and water on a creek crossing. I helped to get the machine out and, yes, it was back into the freezing water again. My feet were now numb, so no worries\n\nOur snowmobile expedition finished with us racing back over the ice covered lake as fast as we could - I’m thinking 80k’s per hour but it was most probably only 70. “How good was that?” I asked Pam, who said something along the lines of “I am so glad that it is finished”.\n\nBack at the base I changed into dry, warm clothing as we were going on to a snow village. This village is at the base of a mountain range that is the ski resort most popular with people from Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe locals make the snow village each year and it consists of tunnels lined with Russian motifs carved out of ice. There was Lenin of course, battle ships, submarines, (we were told later that Murmansk is a nuclear submarine base), children and workers in typical communist poses. The figures were lit in various colours and it was amazing to see.\n\nWe had lunch watching children - big and small - on tubes sliding down a snowy slope.\n\nOutside the restaurant there were large ice carvings of all shapes and sizes. One was a Cosmonaut, I think Yuri Gagarin, the first man into space. Finishing our visit, we found our driver and were taken to Monchogork. This is an nickel processing town and as we drove into the main square, the power plant and processing plant loomed on the surrounding hills. The town was that very depressive soviet grey with dirty snow - nothing attractive at all. Our hotel, the Laplanda, looked down upon the city square and by morning, with the wind howling for sound effects, it looked like a scene from a movie . You know the ones where the people are leaning over as they push into the cold, windblown snow - and we were going husky sledding.\n\nThe Siberian Husky farm was located in Lovozero area, a place where the Sami people in Russian Lapland still survive today. Our driver droped us off at the road junction and Nicolai, a giant of a man wearing a fur reindeer hat, greeted us with a wonderful Russian/ English accent. We sat on a sled covered in reindeer skins and were pulled by a snowmobile for the couple of kilometers into the farm.\n\nWe heard the wonderful ‘Siberian Husky’ as we arrived - they are going off, barking and yelping just waiting to meet us. Alex, the farm owner, met us with a smiling face and even better English. He explained the activity schedule to the group. First we walked to the area of the farm where the reindeer lived. These animals will only come to you if you have some bread and Nicolai had a bag full. They have no teeth so no problems. A ride on a sled pulled by reindeer was fun and surprisingly fast.\n\nThen the dogs were brought up and were tethered to a sled. We walked amongst them and patted them - they loved it and so did we. They nearly all have incredibly beautiful light blue eyes. Then it was all aboard for a race through the forest. After stopping the run, we watched the dogs almost bury themselves in the snow to cool down . Off we went again for more sledding before arriving back at the “Chum.” This is a bit like a wigwam and provided a welcoming fire as we ate a lunch of salmon soup, reindeer meat, bread and tea. A visit to the kennels and a bit more time with these magnificent dogs before it was time to go.\n\nIn the early days they would kill all dogs born with blue eyes, something to do with bad luck but not anymore, thankfully.\n\nI understand that the first Siberian Husky was raised by Chukchi in North-East Siberia. The dogs lived inside the Chukchi’s dwellings so this is why they are very kind to people and love children. Siberian Husky history is inseparably linked with the endless snow plains where the long winters and storms forced people to look for not just a friend, but a true friend and helper. The Huskies provided all of this.\n\nOur trip to the Husky farm finished with another trip on the snowmobile towed sled and then a 150 km drive to Murmansk.\n\nMurmansk\n\nOur hotel for two nights was the Arctica . We were now above the Arctic Circle, staying in the largest hotel in the tallest building in the biggest city north of the Arctic Circle. Pam had a bit of a headache .…too much excitement…. so I went out with a local guide for a city tour.\n\nMurmansk is a city in northwest Russia. It stretches over 25 km along the rocky eastern coast of the Kola Bay and is about 4 km wide. It is 50 km from the open water (the Barents Sea) and is about 1,850 km north of Moscow.\n\nThis port city in the Arctic Circle began in the 1870’s during the Russian Empire.\n\nBut 1915, during the First World War, Murmansk sea port and Semenovskaya village were established to create a North Atlantic supply route to the Russian Empire.\n\nThe official year of foundation of the town is 1916. It was named Romanov-on-Murman in honour of the Romanov dynasty and after the Pomor people’s name for the Barents Sea (Murman). In 1917, after the February Revolution, it was changed to Murmansk.\n\nWe started in the October district on Pyat Uglov (Five Corners) Square and Lenin Avenue (of course there’s a Lenin Ave). In a small park outside the hotel there is a monument to 30 citizens who died during an uprising. There’s also a time capsule that will be opened this year, fifty years after being buried. Should have some interesting articles inside.\n\nNext was the first nuclear icebreaker, the Lenin, built in 1959. It was an intriguing visit. The technology of the day was amazing.\n\nThe Lenin, Russia’s firstborn of a fleet of nine nuclear icebreakers built since 1959 was decommissioned in 1989 . Everything on board remains exactly as it was in the 1950s.\n\nAfter being taken out of operation, the Lenin almost followed the sorrowful fate of the first Russian icebreaker, the Yermak, named after the famous Russian explorer of Siberia, Yermak Timofeyevich. Often referred to as the world’s first true icebreaker, it was built in England in 1898 for the Imperial Russian Navy and served for almost 70 years until, in 1964, this legendary vessel ended up in a scrapyard.\n\nThe Lenin, however, was rescued by a group of enthusiasts led by the vessel’s Captain, Boris Sokolov.\n\nCaptain Sokolov held his Commission for forty years and when the ship was retired he spent a further year onboard. When the Captain of a nuclear icebreaker retires he spends a year on the Lenin before pension time.\n\nThe tour started in the saloon, the officers’ dining and social room, and the finest place on board. Here, our guide narrated the history of the ship and it’s people. Following our guide we saw the seamen’s messroom and their cabins, and the control room of the nuclear propulsion system . The reactor compartment, naturally, remains the chief attraction. We viewed through thick window panes and were told that it was safe for us to be around since all hazardous materials was long gone from the site.\n\nWe finished on the bridge where we were all captains for a moment, taking the ship through ice covered Arctic waters as we tried to make our way to the North Pole.\n\nOnce ashore our tour continued with a stop at the statue that represented the ‘Women of the Sailors’ who were left behind when their partners went to sea. Victor my guide, told me how his father who was a chief in the Russian Navy died of radiation poisoning. His job was to maintain the spent fuel rods in an outpost near the Nuclear Submarine base. There was a leak or accident and his dad tried for years to prove his case, however the authorities refused to acknowledge the incident. He said that they offered his father 300 roubles for food. “Three hundred a week?” I asked, but no it was 300 a month - about $7 AUS.\n\nNext stop was at the Church of Our Savior on the Waters, dedicated to seamen who had lost their lives at sea . Nearby was the conning tower of the Kursk, the nuclear submarine that sank in the Barents Sea during a maritime exercise in 2000. All 118 crew members died after international efforts to save them frustratingly failed.\n\nNearby stood a lighthouse which is a memorial to sailors who died in peacetime.\n\nMy tour finished late in the cold, grey evening at the Murmansk Alyosha, the monument to the defenders of the Soviet Arctic. It is a gigantic concrete monument of a soldier facing west, on watch for an attack from an enemy ( Germany). There are a series of anti aircraft guns that were manned by women in WW11 while the men were out repelling the German Army in the harsh winter. The city was almost bombed into oblivion by the Germans.\n\nMy tour ended in the dark.\n\nI needed to find something to eat. It was cold, the wind not helpful, and the footpaths were piled high with snow and black ice. I spotted a Mac Donald’s - yes, the only Macca’s north of the Arctic Circle . A Ceasar wrap and Pam was happy.\n\nNew day, new adventure. We were going to spend time with the Sami people of Lapland. These were traditionally reindeer herders, getting all they needed for survival from the Taiga and Tundra animals.\n\nToday, their living is made from people like Pam and me visiting them. We played Sami games, ate traditional food and rode in a sled pulled by three reindeers. Then we had a ride on a large inflated ‘banana’ pulled by a snowmobile. The leader was a bit crazy and loved to race across the snow as fast as possible while we hung on for grim death. Bouncing up and down was fun at first but then our backs started to feel the impact. Strange, that didn’t happen a few years ago.\n\nAll good fun before another long drive back to Murmansk.\n\nOur Russian sojourn finished, we dined at our hotel which has a panorama restaurant on the top floor. Our Russian curse continued. What is it? - dirty windows .\n\nAfter a very nice dinner we made sure that we were all packed as we had an early start in the morning\n\nOur bus to Kirkenes, Norway left at 7.00am.\n\nWe were up early. It was still dark, snow had fallen overnight and continued to do so, and we had about 100m across the square to walk with our bags. The ice was slippery, the temperature around minus 7 degrees. There was a wind blowing from the north and it was chilling to the bone. We said a silent farewell to Russia and begin our drive to Norway.\n\nKirkenes\n\nThe bus trip was an easy one. The Russian border crossing was the longest that I can remember, considering that we were leaving the country. I think that the border official checked out every visa I had in my passport. At one point he indicated “only one more to go,” then he used a jeweller’s loupe to check the photos. The Norwegian crossing, simple.\n\nThe bus arrived in the town center and, although our apartment was less than a kilometre away, we still needed a taxi. The roads were ice and snow and the bags were heavy. Our apartment was ready and we could easily access it because the owner, Roar, had emailed the door code.\n\nWhat a surprise! I had read a few comments about this stay, all very positive and everyone had mentioned the full fridge. Let me tell you that breakfast came with the apartment. We had breakfast, lunch and some evening meals as well because it was so well stocked . Everything that you would need was included. Washing powder for the washing machine and luxury of luxuries, a dishwasher. We had been on the road for ages so this stay proved to be relaxing and re-energising.\n\nRoar arrived to meet us and proved to be an enthusiastic character. He said that he would take us for a drive, on Thursday, out to a valley where his family has cabins and a farm.\n\nA walk to get some supplies and we passed the best hotel in town, Thon Hotel, sited right on the waters edge - a fabulous position. A cup of coffee was all we had and we used the toilet of course, as the cold has that effect. We seem to be utilising some of the best places in Europe.\n\nWe walked to the Hurtigruten wharf area to familiarise ourselves with where we would be boarding in a couple of days. The MS Lofoten, the oldest of the Hurtigruten Fleet, had just arrived. You only book this small ship for the nostalgia, not for the stability.\n\nPam was not all that happy about walking up and down the small hills on the icy footpaths and roads, so she returned to Roar’s place . I headed out to investigate this small village, north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nI walked uphill heading for the museum, passing an outdoor iceskating ring, a new shopping mall and a bus load of Hurtigruten passengers on an excursion during their couple of hours turn around.\n\nBy the time I made the museum, I was the only one there. It displayed the history of the border people - three countries meet at the one point, Russia, Norway and Finland. Ancient history in this area had no borders.\n\nThere was a lot about the first and second World Wars exlpaining the suffering that the local people experienced. An interesting visit.\n\nI simply meandered along the streets of Kirkenes looking at how life is lived in this town. Other than a ore processing plant and a ship building hanger, I think that this is a service town for fishing.\n\nThere was an old WWII bunker built into the hill behind our place that I found interesting as it was to be used during the Russian threat of the late 50’s but was never completed . There was also a statue of a soldier, built after the German defeat of WWII, who originally stood with one foot on an eagle (Germany). However, once Norway signed an agreement with Germany to align against Russia, the eagle was removed. Now the soldier stands with one foot in the air.\n\nNow this is Northern Lights area and everyone helps to announce the lights. Roar sent us emails when they appeared. There were two balconies and the lights could be seen in the north from the downstairs one. I got the email, grabbed my camera and one coat to join Roar on the downstairs balcony and yes, the lights were there. I took some photos but the lights only lasted a minute or so. We were waiting for more and it was freezing. I had the wrong gear on to be standing out in the late night air. Even Roar was feeling it, so I agreed to go back upstairs and watch from the bedroom window. Unfortunately, no more for the night. Maybe on the Hurtigruten\n\nJoining Roar the next day, we left Kirkenes and headed out to the Pasvik River Valley. On the way we stopped at a mine to look around. Kirkenes began modern life as a mining town and iron ore is mined about ten kilometers from town in a large open cut mine. Recently it was owned and operated by an Australian company that, as Roar puts it, would not listen to the old hands. They detonated the soil in a different way than usual which caused the crushers to wear out quicker. I sort off got it - something to do with removing the ore in a certain way allowed longer use of the crushers blades. The end result was that the Aussies went bankrupt, however the mine has opened again with new owners.\n\nThe river is the border between Russia and Norway in this area. We were going out to see a dog sled race or, at least, the preparation for the race. As we drove down the river valley Roar explained that his grandfather started a farm here after WWII . He was given land by the government as they tried to repopulate the Finnmark. He built his home by himself while his wife looked after the farm and animals. Roar has a cabin on the family farmland and a cousin also has a cabin, but is extending - just because he wants a bigger house than the others, Roar suggested. An Uncle here and another there, the valley is populated by two families.\n\nThe dog race was starting in the National Park Headquarters. This was an old farm with a new modern building used for conferences and the like. We were given a lot of history about Roar's family as we drove along. A good day to finish our Kirkenes stay. Tomorrow we have our taxi booked as we join the Hurtigruten’s MS Nordlys for our trip south."
