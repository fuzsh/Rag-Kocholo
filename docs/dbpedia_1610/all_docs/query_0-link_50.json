        "text": "Governor Andrey Chibis took part in a meeting on the integrated development of the Murmansk transport hub under the leadership of First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Andrey Belousov, who instructed to complete the construction of the Murmansk transport hub in December 2024.\n\nThe project \"Integrated development of the Murmansk transport Hub\" is being implemented in accordance with the Transport Strategy of the Russian Federation. Earlier, the issue of activating the Murmansk transport hub development project was repeatedly raised by Governor Andrey Chibis. As a result of a number of working meetings, the support of President Vladimir Putin was received.\n\n\"A strategically important part of the Northern Sea Route is being created on the western shore of the Kola Bay. Thanks to the Murmansk transport hub, cargo turnover through the port of Murmansk will grow to 110 million tons by 2027,\" Andrei Chibis stressed.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport of Russia noted that the work on the near approaches to the port of Lavna was carried out in accordance with the roadmap. Recall that the working traffic on the railway bridge across Tuloma â€“ from the Exit station to the port of Lavna on the western shore of the Kola Bay was launched on December 15, 2023. The start of the labor movement was given by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe meeting discussed the implementation of the project, taking into account the construction work ahead of schedule. Russian Railways, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, with the participation of Glavgosexpertiza, need to work out this issue and submit proposals.\n\nDuring the meeting, the First Deputy Prime Minister drew special attention to the inadmissibility of disrupting the deadlines for the implementation of this project.\n\n\"The Lavna seaport is a strategic one, and its importance is increasing today. The failure of the deadline set by the responsible department is unacceptable,\" Andrei Belousov noted.\n\n/ Ministry of Information Policy of the Murmansk Region /"
