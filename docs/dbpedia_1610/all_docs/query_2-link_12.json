        "text": "A criminal case has been launched in Russia's Arctic region of Murmansk after suspected metal thieves made off with a railway bridge.\n\nLocal prosecutors say the unknown perpetrators removed a metal structure 23m long and weighing 56 tonnes from the bridge - its main central span.\n\nThe disused bridge is located in a remote forest near the abandoned settlement of Oktyabrskaya, around 170km (100 miles) south of the regional capital, Murmansk.\n\nLuckily, the bridge was disused and the tracks lifted long ago, according to state newspaper Rossiskaya Gazeta.\n\nThe railway over the bridge was once used to transport concentrated rare earth elements from a nearby plant, but was closed when the business went bankrupt in 2007, the daily said.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nResidents first noticed the disappearing bridge in May.\n\nA picture posted on the Russian social network VK showed that the bridge was already missing its central section.\n\nBut a chunk can still be seen resting in the middle of the river, suggesting the structure was first brought down and then taken apart piecemeal.\n\n'Eyesores'\n\nThe post's anonymous writer predicted that the two remaining end sections would be \"eyesores\" for a long time to come.\n\n\"Ah, who cares - this isn't Germany, and restoring order to the vandalised landscape is not high on the agenda,\" the writer added.\n\nDespite the apparently spectacular nature of the theft, the damage caused is estimated at only 600,000 roubles ($9,000) to the local company that owns the structure, according to the Znak news website.\n\nThe theft of metal objects by thieves interested in their scrap value has long been a problem in Russia.\n\nIn 2017, a 10m-long Soviet-era anti-aircraft missile exploded at a recycling centre, apparently after being sold for scrap.\n\nReporting by Adam Robinson\n\nNext story: Japanese city tries to improve tourists' manners"
