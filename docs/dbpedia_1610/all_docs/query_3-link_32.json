        "text": "Orbx proudly presents the DCS: Kola map, which covers northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Russian Murmansk Oblast and parts of the Karelia region. The map also includes large areas of the Barents Sea and Norwegian Sea to the north and west, ideal for aircraft carrier operations. The Orbx DCS: Kola map is represented in its current-day state, with some allowance for late-Cold War military features and functionality.\n\nThe Kola map spans about 1,400 km east-west by 1,000 km north-south, with more than 575,000 sq km of land and a total coverage area of ~1,350,000 sq km. Its southern boundary roughly aligns with 65 degrees latitude, meaning most of the map area falls within the Arctic Circle. The Kola map covers various natural landscapes, from the dramatic fjords and island chains to vast forested areas with myriad lakes and wetlands, to rugged mountains, to the Arctic tundra. Cities, towns, mines, ports, and infrastructure corridors, all have unique characteristics determined by their location and cultural association.\n\nThe area's geopolitical significance stems from its largely ice-free Arctic ports, rich natural resources, important military installations and training areas, and past and present East-West tensions, the latter of which have significantly increased by the recent accessions of Sweden and Finland to NATO and Russian military operations.\n\nThe Russian portion of the map is home to its Northern Fleet and includes the mostly ice-free ports of Murmansk, Severomorsk, and the strategically important submarine bases of Polyarny. Also in this area are the important Russian air bases of Olenegorsk, Monchegorsk, Severomorsk, and others. The narrow land corridor from the Kola Peninsula towards the Baltic region has evolved into dense clusters of military airfields and installations, and has been listed as having the highest concentration of nuclear weapons, reactors, and facilities in Russia. This area, along with parts of central Finland adjacent to its border with Russia, is the focus of the early-access release.\n\nThe included regions of Norway, Sweden, and Finland also feature critical airbases, army bases, weapon and fuel storage depots, and training areas. Notable airports include Rovaniemi and Kemi-Tornio in Finland, Kiruna and Vidsel in Sweden, and Bodo, Andoya, and Lakselv in Norway. Sweden and Finland also feature multiple road runways, for defensive force dispersal of military aircraft.\n\nKey Features of the Early Access Release\n\nComplete base terrain for the entire map area, with highly detailed topography, summer ground textures, shorelines, and lakes and rivers.\n\nAn initial focus area spans the Finland/Russia border and encompasses central Finland and the western parts of the Murmansk and Karelia regions of Russia (see map).\n\nFour high-detail areas, focusing on two airports in Finland (EFRO, EFKE) and five in Russia (XLMV, ULAK, RU-1110, RU-4464, ULMM), and their urban and rural surroundings and infrastructure.\n\nTwo road runways in Finland, near Rovaniemi and Sodankylä, respectively.\n\nTwo additional airports in Norway (ENBO, ENNA) and three in Sweden (ESNQ, ESNJ, ESUK) are functional but not fully detailed at early-access release.\n\nSignificant civilian POIs include bridges, vertical obstructions, monuments, hydro dams, power stations, port facilities, landmark buildings, open-pit mines, towns and small villages, and industrial sites.\n\nImproved night lighting for cities and towns.\n\nMain road and railroad network, with bridges and tunnels, which is connected across the map that allows long-distance AI routing.\n\nNatural landmarks and geographic features, like Norwegian fjords, detailed coastlines, snowfields, forests and wetlands, tens of thousands of lakes, and large river systems.\n\nMap features represent the current era but includes allowances for the late-Cold War era – e.g., operational road runways and fully functioning Russian air bases – to enhance mission options.\n\nThe Orbx team is collaborating with experienced DCS campaign creators Baltic Dragon and Reflected Simulations to create engaging campaigns.\n\nAdditional Features after Early Access Release\n\nComplete set of winter textures that load dynamically based on mission date, to accurately represent the cold and harsh climate of the Kola area.\n\nAdditional detailed military airfields, including Andøya, Bardufoss, Kirkenes, Evenes, Vidsel, Kilpyavr, Alakkurti, and others.\n\nAdditional military installations like naval and army bases, barracks, ports, storage areas, training areas/ranges, radar and communication sites, and air defense sites.\n\nAdditional Cold War era Swedish and Finnish road runways.\n\nAdditional civilian airports, including Tromsø, Hammerfest, Ivalo, Luleå, and others.\n\nAdditional detailed cities and towns, POIs, and industrial sites.\n\nImprovements to landscape features and detail, as well as additional areas with high-resolution aerial orthoimagery."
