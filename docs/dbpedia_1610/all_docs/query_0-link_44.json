        "text": "Kola is a city and the place of business of Kolsky District of Murmansk Oblast, Russia. The district of Kolo became first attested in Russian chronicles in 1264. The first documented mention of the town itself dates to 1565 the area was settled by means of the Pomors, who constructed the castle of Kola. Over time, Sweden extracted the Kola Peninsula from each Russia and Denmark-Norway in a series of wars and resulting treaties. However, inside the later Treaty of Teusina in 1595, Sweden stated Russian rights in Kola.\n\nClaims from Denmark-Norway remained, but, and in 1582, a Russian voivode became appointed to Kola to offer for higher defenses of the peninsula. The voivode governed the territory which became referred to as Kolsky Uyezd. During the Russo-Swedish War of 1590â€“1595, the Swedes didn't seize the fort. In the 17th century, it prospered as a start line for naval expeditions of the Pomors to Spitzbergen and Novaya Zemlya.\n\nThe brethren of the Pechenga Monastery moved there as well. Although it was included as a metropolis in 1784, Kola declined after Russia received get entry to to the Baltic Sea, and changed into used by the Tsarist government as a place of exile. Kola become decreased to ashes with the aid of a 20-hour bombardment in 1854 by a 3-ship squadron led with the aid of the Royal Navy sloop HMS Miranda, at the time of Crimean War. As a effect, Kolsky Uyezd changed into abolished and merged into Kemsky Uyezd."
