        "text": "A great movie BTW with good Canadian participation.\n\nHMCS Sackville stars in Tom Hanks movie Greyhound | SaltWire\n\nThe last of 269 corvettes of her kind that was built during World War Two, she was obvious choice to be featured in a film about the battle of the Atlantic\n\nCanadian warships give 'Greyhound' authentic touch thanks to Ont. naval consultant\n\nFrom script to sea, there are many Canadian connections to the new Second World War drama 'Greyhound.' Gordon Laco of Midland, Ont., was the film's naval consultant and incorporated several homegrown elements into the story, which stars Tom Hanks and is set in winter 1942 during the Battle of...\n\n\"Laco also got the crew to film scenery shots aboard HMCS Montreal for a week at sea in January 2018, to help depict the dramatic winter waves and sky of the North Atlantic in the story. CGI crews digitally added ships from the story into that footage. \"In the film, whenever you see a bow wave or a wake or a ship turning, that's the computer-generated ship in the film with HMCS Montreal's wakes under her,\" Laco said.\"\n\nI do not think it had anything to do with more or less sensors (unless you are talking about Mark 1 eyeballs). The role of the bridge personnel was slightly different between the two navies. Direct observation and communication amongst the bridge personnel, for spotting of attacking aircraft and ships, and for navigation, was given a higher priority in the RN than in the USN. Not that it was not important in the USN, just that the duty assignments and chain of communication were different. Trying to see out through windows, particularly at night and in bad weather (rain, snow, etc) is significantly more difficult than directly without the glass in the way. Spotting incoming aircraft was almost impossible from an enclosed bridge unless they were at low level. Some of the US bridges had windows that could be lowered or raised when desired.\n\nAll (I think) inter-war US built DDs (including I think the last of the WWI 'flush-deckers') had enclosed bridges, and since this was 20 years before radar I doubt that radar played a role."
