The schedule for its repairs was not disrupted,” he said.\n\nInvestigators announced they had opened a criminal investigation into the incident that would look at whether safety rules had been violated.\n\nMarina Kovtun, Murmansk's governor, said in a statement a rescue operation had been launched and 71 people evacuated as the floating dock sank.\n\nOne person is unaccounted for and four others are being treated for hypothermia after being rescued from the water.\n\nThe Admiral Kuznetsov, a Cold War relic with a reputation for technical problems, had been due to undergo a renovation of its power and electronic systems.\n\nWorld news in pictures\n\nShow all 50\n\nThe carrier, which first launched in 1985, was recently seen in military action in Syria during 2016 air strikes targeting rebels in Russia’s campaign supporting president Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIt gained notoriety in Britain as it returned from its Mediterranean mission through the English Channel in January 2017, leading then-defence secretary Michael Fallon to brand it the “ship of shame”.\n\nThe Admiral Kuznetsov remains Russia’s only aircraft carrier after construction on its planned sister ship, known initially as Riga and then Varyag, was abandoned following the break-up of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe vessel’s stripped-out hull was sold to a Chinese company by Ukraine in 1998 and later transferred to the Chinese Navy, which completed it for use as a training ship.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
