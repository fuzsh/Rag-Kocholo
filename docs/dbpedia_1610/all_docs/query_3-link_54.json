        "text": "“Convoy is to scatter.” These words sent chills down the spines of the men sailing in these merchant ships. While the thought was that scattering the convoy would make it harder for the Germans to sink the ships, what followed was the exact opposite and meant disaster for PQ-17. Without support from warships and left to fend for themselves, the merchant ships were sitting ducks for the German Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe.\n\nOn July 5, 12 merchant ships were sunk by German attacks. Seaman Naggatz and the Pan Atlantic’s luck ran out on July 6. The ship was valiantly trying to fight off German aerial attacks, but was hit by two bombs dropped by a Ju-88 bomber at 6:10 pm. The bombs set off the supply of cordite the ship was carrying, blowing apart the forward section of the vessel. The damage was so severe the ship sank in three minutes, preventing any distress signal from being sent.\n\nNaggatz was manning a machine gun when the bombs hit and was thrown into the frigid sea. He clung to pieces of floating ice until he found a raft with a dead body on it. He was forced to push the body into the water for his own survival. After floating alone for a day, Naggatz was picked up by a lifeboat of his fellow survivors. The men spent three more days floating in the lifeboat until being rescued by the HMS Lotus. Out of a merchant marine crew of 37, 18 were killed. Seven of the 11 US Naval Armed Guard were lost as well. The survivors were taken to the Soviet Union for recuperation. Naggatz had to have his shoes and socks cut off because his hands and feet were so swollen.\n\nWhile Naggatz would return to service and fight in the Pacific, many men and ships involved with PQ-17 would not. Out of a total of 35 ships in the convoy, only 11 reached Arkhangelsk. Matériel losses in the convoy were staggering as well: 3,350 vehicles, 210 aircraft, 430 tanks, and 99,316 tons of other cargo such as food and ammunition were lost. Adding insult to injury, the reports of the Tirpitz coming out to intercept the convoy were false. Winston Churchill called PQ-17 “one of the most melancholy naval episodes in the whole of the war.” The heavy losses of PQ-17 and the follow-up PQ-18 in September caused convoys to the Soviet Union to be suspended until December 1942.\n\nThe men of the US Merchant Marine and US Naval Armed Guard fought against long odds during the Battle of the Atlantic. Most of the large convoy battles fought during the war have been overshadowed by other important events such as D-Day or the Battle of the Bulge. But without the courage and sacrifice of men like Seaman Naggatz fighting to make sure the goods got through, the whole course of the war could have been very different and stretched on for many more years.\n\nTop image: SS Pan Atlantic Passing under Railroad Bridge at Cape Cod Canal, 1938.
