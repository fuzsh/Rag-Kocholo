        "text": "THE disappearance of a 56-ton bridge in Russia has sparked controversy, and prompted the police to start an investigation into the incident. In Russiaâs Murmansk region, this bizarre incident has sent the local residents into a tizzy.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, the bridge is roughly 75 feet (22.86 meters) in length and weighs over 50 tons. It is located on the Umba river in the Arctic region. In May, reports of the bridgeâs mysterious disappearance began to circulate on VK â a Russian social media platform.\n\nAnother bizarre thing is that the bridge has disappeared without a trace. Some 10 days ago, pictures of the bridge were again shared on VK, which showed that a part of the bridge had broken down and the debris was lying in the water below.\n\nNow, a few days later, there is absolutely no sign of the broken bridge. In fact, the debris also disappeared. This triggered a detailed investigation which revealed that the bridge had not sunk to the bottom of the river, according to News 18.\n\nâIt was taken away by unknowns. At the bottom, too, there are no large debris. Natural phenomena could not bring down the bridge,â wrote the VK page, where aerial shots of the bridge that disappeared were posted.\n\nLocals believe that the bridge was torn down and then stolen by metal thieves. Its disappearance has been reported to Kirovsk Police.\n\nâMost likely, metal workers pulled the structure down into the water, and there they slowly took it apart into scrap pieces,â the VK page also speculated.\n\nThere is a reason everyone believes that itâs the doing of metal thieves â it wasnât the first episode of scrap metal thieves damaging infrastructure in the region. There were attempts to steal transmission towers in the nearby Apatity in summer 2018.\n\nIn 2008, Russian police hunted scrap metal thieves who stole an even larger 200-ton metal bridge in a night-time raid.\n\nAccording to The Independent, Kirovsk Prosecutorâs Office confirmed an investigation was under way regarding the bridgeâs disappearance. Police say that thieves may have acted to sell scrap metal, but their identities and the way they operated are still unknown.\n\nPolice said in their statement that the bridge belonged to a company operating in the area, and estimated material losses of about 600,000 Russian rubles (US$9,193) had been incurred.\n\n(SD-Agencies)"
