        "text": "1) Target Designation Sight. For azimuth, the red ring rotates the entire sight. There is also a crank for elevation. A pair of binoculars (missing) was fitted to the top arm which is just outside the view of the photo. There is an identical unit on the starboard side.\n\nUse: For visual acquisition of targets.\n\n2) IC-KAA intercom.\n\nUse: Connects to two other units on the Flag Deck in the vicinity of the Flag Lockers.\n\n3) Remote Control for CM11 transmitter/receiver. but its not connected to any CM11. this was an abandoned project of the Nortown Radio Club circa 1985. HAIDA never had a CM11 remote control on the bridge.\n\n4) Remote Control Unit- 1 of 3\n\nUse: Allows bridge personnel to use any VHF or UHF radio channels (voice) . To participate in NATO exercises, each ship needed to have a minimum of seven UHF voice channels.\n\n5) Pelorus\n\nUse: A navigational instrument resembling a mariner's compass but without magnetic needles and having two sight vanes by which relative bearings are taken on an object/target of interest. The Pelorus is the stand which supports the gyro repeater for the bridge. The topmost portion is called the Azimuth ring and has been removed for safekeeping.\n\n6) Torpedo Bearing Indicator. Its hidden and ahead of the Pelorus in this view. Its face is marked with the words \"RED\" and \"GREEN\". To the top and slightly to the left of the bearing indicator are the sonar dome \"Up/Down\" indicator lights.\n\n7) AN/SPA-4 radar repeater.\n\nUse: A switch allows the SPA-4 to be connected to either the Sperry Mk 2 navigation radar or the AN/SPS-6C air search radar. Â“ Before the SPA-4 was installed,, there was a window in the deck which allowed bridge personnel to view the plot table in the Operations Room below. The window had a little enclosure over it along with a curtain to keep out light.\n\n8) Wheelhouse viewing window.\n\nUse: This window was added when the ship was berthed in Toronto in order that visitors could view the Wheelhouse from the bridge.\n\n9) AN/SPA-4 input selector switch.\n\nUse: Selects one of two inputs for the SPA-4 display. - ie either the Sperry Mk2 or SPS-6C radars.\n\n10) Magnetic compass in binnacle but the binnacle is missing\n\nUse: Backup in case the gyrocompass fails."
