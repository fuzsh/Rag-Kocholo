        "text": "The Northern Lights return to Russia's Murmansk. Get a first glimpse as they start to appear elsewhere in the extreme north of the globe, Oct. 21, 2022, Murmansk, northern Russia.\n\nAA\n\nThe Northern Lights illuminate the night sky of the far-northern Russian city of Murmansk in the autumn season with different colors. The images of the Northern Lights, which are the result of the interaction of the earth's magnetic field and charged particles from the sun, attract a lot of attention.\n\nAA\n\nThe lights have captivated, frightened as well as inspired humans for thousands of years.\n\nAA\n\nSolar storms on the sun's surface produce vast clouds of electrically charged particles that can travel millions of kilometers, while some eventually colliding with the Earth.\n\nAA\n\nMost particles are deflected away, but some get caught in the Earthâ€™s magnetic field, accelerating down toward the north and south poles into the atmosphere, resulting in the auroras at the magnetic poles.\n\nAA"
