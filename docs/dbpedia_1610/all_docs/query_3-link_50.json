        "text": "In January 1943, the Red Army broke the Siege of Leningrad, which had lasted from 1941, when the big city ended up without any supplies.\n\nCzech hedgehogs strewn around Leningrad during the siege.\n\nA soldier taking in the view of the beautiful Neva River in Leningrad.\n\nFebruary 1943 marked the successful end of the most important pages of the war - the Battle of Stalingrad.\n\nIn the summer of 1943, the Battle of Kursk took place, the biggest tank battle in history.

A girl nursing a baby bear in the Moscow Zoo is pictured below.\n\nFemale aviation division dancing during a break.\n\nTankmen celebrating Labor Day near Kursk.\n\nAnd there was always time for love and friendship.\n\nEven a soccer game was imaginable, like in this makeshift field near the Polar city of Murmansk.\n\nWar correspondents and a photographer saluting on the front line.\n\nHappiness of a family reunited.\n\nA concert in a ruined city.\n\nSoldiers of the equestrian unit taking a break.\n\nNo less important than soldiers fighting on the front line were rear workers. Two kitchen hands washing and drying dishes in a hospital are pictured below.\n\nA woman preparing tank shells at a Chelyabinsk Defense Plant.\n\nSchool girls sewing uniforms.\n\nA unit of soldiers fixing a damaged bridge.\n\nDirector Grigory Alexandrov and actors Khosrov Melikov and Lyubov Orlova taking a break between scenes on the set of the movie ‘A Family’.\n\nA young steelworker at the Magnitogorsk Stalin Iron and Steel Works working for the needs of the front line.\n\nA partisan peasant being honored with a medal for courage.\n\nA woman returning home from captivity with her kids.\n\nPioneers marching in Moscow near the Worker and Kolkhoz Woman statue.\n\nA farmer’s boy tending to pigs.\n\nSchoolgirls making agitation stands in a school.\n\nKids playing peacefully outside.\n\nDear readers,\n\nOur website and social media accounts are under threat of being restricted or banned, due to the current circumstances.
