The sole railway bridge that connects Murmansk in northern Russia with the rest of the country has collapsed due to the weight of water in the Kola river.

As a result, no passenger or freight trains can reach the Artic city, home to 300,000 people, for the foreseeable future.

Trains are being terminated short of the bridge and passengers are having to complete their journeys by bus as the road bridge is still intact. What arrangements are being made for freight are unknown.

Murmansk, which lies north of the Arctic Circle, has a relatively mild climate due to the Gulf Stream. However, the surrounding area still has a high snowfall and it is this that is melting, raising the water level in the river.
