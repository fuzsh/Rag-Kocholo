Militarization: A Reader has twelve sections, each highlighting a theme ­related to militarization or militarism. A general introduction to the volume (immediately following this note) provides an overview of ­these subjects and how the twelve sections relate to one another. Each of the twelve sections contains a brief introduction and several exemplary readings, compiled by a section editor who is an anthropologist specializing in the field. Most se­lections are abridged versions assembled from excerpts of longer pieces. Original source information can be found at the end of each section introduction. We encourage readers to refer to the original articles for more information and analy­sis. A master reference list can be found at the end of the book, incorporating bibliographical references from all of the contributions and section introductions.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nACKNOWL­EDGMENTS\n\nMany ­people helped us plan, prepare, and publish this book, which has been nearly a de­cade in the making. Austin Miller played a critical orga­nizational role by securing reprint permissions, weaving together bibliographical references, and providing sound editorial advice at crucial moments. Founding members of the Network of Concerned Anthropologists who ­were not directly involved in this proj­ect provided encouragement—­most notably, Gregory Feldman, Jean E. Jackson, and Kanhong Lin. Much of the conceptual work for this book came out of a workshop at Brown University’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs in May 2012, or­ga­nized by Catherine Lutz. At that event, Cynthia Enloe, Neta Crawford, Gregory Feldman, and ­others provided interdisciplinary perspectives that added depth to the proj­ect. We are especially grateful to Neta Crawford for her incisive ideas and intellectual generosity. Thanks, too, to June Sawyers, who created the index. This book was supported in part by the San José State University (sjsu) College of Social Sciences, which provided grant funding to help defray the costs of reprint permissions and indexing. Walt Jacobs and Shishir Mathur ­were instrumental in securing that support. The sjsu Department of Anthropology provided financial and logistical support for preparation of the final manuscript. Special thanks to Agnes Borja, Shannon Gallagher, and Kristen Constanza for their assistance. The George Washington University provided funds for indexing. We express gratitude to all t­hose contributors who generously allowed us to include their work in this reader. In addition, we appreciate the support of the American Anthropological Association’s Ed Liebow (executive director) and Janine McKenna and Chelsea Horton of the association’s Permissions Department. Thanks, too, to Karin Beesley and Mary Ann Muller of Taylor and Francis; to John Mecklin (editor-­in-­chief ) and Rachel Bronson (president) of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists; and Margie Guerra of New York University Press. We are especially grateful to our colleagues at Duke University Press. Gisela Fosado provided unwavering editorial support and advice, and Jenny Tan expertly answered literally dozens of queries regarding copyrights, reprint permissions, and final manuscript preparation. Ellen Goldlust helped guide the book through its last stages. Without their patient guidance, we would not have succeeded in completing this volume.\n\nFig. I.0. ​In the United States, militarization often begins at home, where ­children are frequently socialized in ways that normalize armed conflict. Toys, books, tele­vi­sion ­programs, video games, and other media not only reflect but also shape social values. Plastic army men ­were first pop­u­lar­ized in the early 1950s and have been in production ever since. Photo­graph by Roberto J. González.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRoberto J. González and Hugh Gusterson\n\nIn the silence of his basement workshop, Peter Cleary delicately sliced away a few thin slivers of plastic from his latest proj­ect. Using a razor-­sharp cutting knife, the sixty-­year-­old Cleary—­a retired military man—­sculptured the last facial features of a twelve-­inch-­tall ­human figurine clad in camouflage combat gear. For years, Cleary had created miniature historical dioramas, usually related to war­time scenarios: a U.S. Civil War campsite; a Paris nightclub from the World War II period; a model of the famous meeting of Franklin D. Roo­se­velt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin. Local museums, schools, and churches occasionally displayed Cleary’s work. But his newest proj­ect was dif­fer­ent. As he worked late into the night, Cleary’s thoughts transported him to another place and time. His head filled with memories of his only child’s first birthday, in late November 1985, when he was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia. That day, he gave his baby boy a G.I. Joe action figure. He hoped that Pete Jr. would enjoy playing with G.I. Joe as much as he had nearly twenty years ­earlier—­and he did. Over the years, G.I. Joe served as a link connecting ­father and son. By the late 1990s, Pete Sr. and Pete Jr. would even compete with each other to acquire rare and often valuable collectible G.I. Joe action figures and accessories. Another bond the two shared was a commitment to military ser­vice. Following in his ­father’s footsteps, Pete Jr. joined the U.S. Army in 2008 and trained as a cavalry scout. ­Later, his wife, Beth, said, “Pete was ­really proud of his grand­father and dad being in the ser­vice. He loved the war movies, he loved John Wayne, and he loved G.I. Joe.” In January 2011, Army First Lieutenant Peter Cleary Jr. was deployed to Af­ ghan­i­stan’s Khost Province, near the Pakistan border. Just a few months ­later, on April 3, he was killed when a mortar shell struck while he was on patrol. Pete Jr. died within minutes of the blast. When he learned that he had lost his only child, Peter Cleary Sr. was stunned, speechless. He descended into the basement workshop and knew that, somehow, he needed to memorialize his son.\n\nSo he created a twelve-­inch image in his likeness by modifying and customizing a G.I. Joe action figure. Cleary gathered photos of his son in combat gear, and over the next few weeks he scoured the Internet for websites selling miniature pixelated Army uniforms, tiny patches, even a meticulously crafted helmet replete with a “helmet cam.” He l­ater said, “It helped me work through the grief. I wanted to make it as much like him as pos­si­ble. It was very therapeutic for me to sit ­there and feel like I was ­doing something to honor him.” ­Others ­were also affected. Some of Pete Jr.’s Army buddies visited his parents. One said admiringly, “You captured his image, Mr. Cleary.” Another silently cradled Pete Jr.’s miniature body in the crook of his arm for the better part of an after­noon. Fast forward to November 30, 2014, the day that would have been Pete Jr.’s thirtieth birthday. Beth and her two sons—­seven-­year-­old Adam and five-­year-­ old Pete III—­celebrated ­Daddy’s birthday by ­doing what they had done for the past three years: visiting the beautifully manicured Dallas–­Fort Worth National Cemetery. The young f­ amily took flowers, cupcakes, toys, and a can of Bud Light to their ­father’s grave. And ­there they spent the day. Beth said, “The boys feel ­really comfortable ­here, so they just run and play. It’s a safe place for us to come as a f­amily.” ­Later, she added, “They both know how much Dad loved G.I. Joe.”1 Merchandising War The story of the Cleary ­family resonates deeply—­a triumphant and unusual case in which bonds of love and affection between ­father and son, between parent and child, are publicly recognized and celebrated. But from a dif­fer­ent perspective, this account illustrates the subtle means by which militaristic values can be designed, manufactured, packaged, and marketed. It also reveals how ­human connections—­including intimate ­family relationships—­can be influenced by the “military-­industrial complex,” a concept first developed by President (and former World War II commander) Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower used the term to warn Americans about the growing po­liti­cal influence of the defense industry and the threat it posed to democracy in the United States. One can only won­der how many thousands of times similar dramas have played out over the years. For more than half a c­ entury, the Hasbro toy com­ pany has sold G.I. Joe, its plastic doll—or “action figure,” to use Hasbro’s 2\n\nGonzález and Gusterson\n\nterm—to millions of Americans. (G.I. Joe was introduced in 1964; its creators ­were motivated to compete with Mattel’s wildly popu­lar and lucrative Barbie doll by marketing a new toy to boys.) Its commercial success was due in large part to hundreds of additional accessories, such as uniforms, weapons, vehicles, and ­battle stations that Hasbro sold to enthusiasts. T ­ oday ­there are dozens of official and unofficial G.I. Joe fan clubs and collectors’ clubs, and original action figures and accessories sometimes sell for hundreds of dollars at antique shops and on eBay. But Hasbro went a step further. In 2003, it franchised G.I. Joe to Paramount Pictures, which then created the blockbuster G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra (2009). The film was panned by critics, but it was a commercial success, due in part to extensive “tie-­ins” with fast-­food chains, technology companies, and other corporate sponsors. In 2014, Paramount released a sequel, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, which was also a box-­office success. Paramount Pictures was strongly supported by its partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense. As in the case of many Hollywood films (from Top Gun to Iron Man), the Pentagon lent a ­great deal of equipment and personnel for the making of the G.I. Joe films, including Apache he­li­cop­ters, Humvees, and even members of the Army’s 21st Cavalry Brigade.2 According to a report published by the Bloomberg news ser­vice, “Pentagon officials and weapon makers say ­they’ve found a savvy way to make US military ser­vice seem attractive to teenage boys” and more recently girls: by placing the weapons of war on the big screen (Lococo 2007). The synergy of the Paramount-­ Pentagon partnership was ­simple but power­ful: ­free high-­tech stage props in exchange for a two-­hour recruitment advertisement for the military. Weapons manufacturers enjoyed the added benefit of product promotion. Scott Lusk, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin, provided a candid assessment of including F-22 fighter planes in Paramount films: such appearances “help promote the state-­of-­the-­art, high-­tech products that are designed, developed and manufactured” by Lockheed Martin for the US military (quoted in ­Lococo 2007). Even before its partnership with Paramount, the Pentagon was involved in a symbiotic relationship with toy companies. In an eye-­opening report that followed the U.S.-­led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the journalist William Hamilton revealed how Mattel, Hasbro, and other companies inspired state-­of-­the-­art weaponry: “The M-16 ­rifle is based on something Mattel did,” says Glenn Flood, a spokesman for the Pentagon, which is looking to toys and electronic\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\ngames for parts, prototypes and ideas that can be developed effectively and inexpensively as battlefield tools. Inspiration has come from model planes (reconnaissance drones), “supersoaker” ­water guns (quick-­loading assault weapons), cheap cellular phones for teen­agers (video-­capable walkie-­talkies) and gaming control panels (for unmanned robotic vehicles). . . . ​­Today’s troops effectively received basic training as ­children. (Hamilton 2003) Given ­these connections, the G.I. Joe franchise might be described as a massive joint venture of Paramount Pictures, Hasbro, the Pentagon and its contract firms (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and am General), fast-­food companies, and other firms that benefit from box-­office sales, action figure sales, weapon systems sales, junk food sales, and the like. But such endeavors can be mea­sured in more than dollars and cents. The social and psychological consequences are also impor­tant considerations, for ­people and families sometimes get caught in the crosshairs. Hollywood churns out films that glamorize soldiers, projecting them as archetypical American men whose strug­gles define the quest to come of age and find meaning in life. Filmmakers routinely submit their scripts to the Pentagon and rewrite them in exchange for access to military hardware and military locations (Fleischer 2004; Koppes and Black 1990). Militarized cultures also tend to idealize men, masculinity, and patriarchy. In the context of the con­temporary United States, it is striking that so many accounts of military families are framed as intergenerational links in which grand­fathers, ­fathers, and sons share common experiences and identities centered on military service—as in the case of the Cleary ­family highlighted at the beginning of this chapter. Frequently, ­women are left entirely out of the picture or are portrayed as passive bystanders. As noted in the section of this reader entitled “Gender and Militarism,” this gender imbalance does not provide an accurate repre­sen­ta­tion of real­ity. Even when ­women are drawn into militarist narratives, as in the case of the Hollywood film G.I. Jane (1997), they are typically portrayed as p­ eople who can be just as aggressive and “tough” as their male counter­parts. (This has become an impor­tant gendered dimension of con­temporary militarism in many nation-­states, including the United States, extending militarism by promoting active participation in the armed ser­vices, including combat roles.) The intersections of militarism, war, and gender are being analyzed by a growing number of social scientists, including anthropologists (Altinay 2004; Davis et al. 2014; Enloe 1983, 2007; Peteet 1992). 4\n\nGonzález and Gusterson\n\nLike any cultural product, G.I. Joe reveals much about American society, including the power­ful role played by the complex that links the Pentagon, Hollywood, weapons manufacturers, toy companies, and other industries; the mechanisms by which such institutions succeed in diffusing militaristic ideologies widely and effectively; and the disproportionately large effects of ­these proj­ects on youth. Nick Turse (2008) has gone as far as to call this interconnected system “Amer­i­ca’s military-­industrial-­technological-­entertainment-­ academic-­media-­corporate” complex, expanding on Eisenhower’s notion of the military-­industrial complex.3 Apart from the web of corporations and government agencies connected by symbiotic business relationships, and apart from the economics of profitmaking, ­there is the question of attitudes and values. What are the consequences of a culture industry that produces war films, toys, clothing, video games, and comic books year a­ fter year, in lockstep with the Pentagon’s military adventures abroad? How can we better understand the long-­term effects of what the anthropologist Catherine Lutz (2009b: 23) has called the “military normal”—­a condition in which science, entertainment, business, and even high fashion deeply reflect militaristic values?4 In short, what are the consequences of militarizing culture? The story of the Cleary ­family might be viewed as a bittersweet human-­ interest story with a heartwarming ending. It might even make Americans feel better about fighting wars that create hometown heroes. But from a more critical perspective, it illustrates how ­today’s U.S. military-­ industrial complex is power­ful and sophisticated enough to infiltrate and mediate intimate social relationships—­between parent and child, ­family and community, civilian and soldier—­colonizing the imagination of t­ hose who can help it further its own ends. What makes such situations troubling—­even tragic—is that they reveal how in American society heroism, valor, and love are often expressed in the idiom of a military-­industrial-­entertainment complex whose architects have altogether dif­fer­ent motives. We begin with the story of the Cleary ­family and G.I. Joe ­because it is in many ways the story of us all. Defining Militarization This book is a collection of readings selected to give readers a clearer understanding of militarization—as both a cultural product and a process—­across a range of socie­ties. The contributions to this collection ­were chosen to provide broad anthropological perspectives on the topic. Militarization: A Reader is intended to serve two purposes: first, to encourage other anthropologists to Introduction\n\n5\n\nbegin their own explorations, particularly t­ hose who might not other­wise be inclined to do so; and second, to serve as a handbook for researchers and instructors who are already interested in militarization and who are interested in how a distinctly anthropological approach might inform the topic. This volume was designed as a cross-­cultural reader that explores militarization in dif­fer­ent cultural contexts, but readers w ­ ill discover a disproportionate amount of material dedicated to the analy­sis of militarization in the United States. This was done intentionally for two reasons. First, the United States ­today accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world’s military expenditures e­ very year; and second, the United States is the most studied and leading model of what might be called a militarized society. Militarization—­and militarism—­are integral to global society ­today. ­These pro­cesses can be seen around the world in the growth of standing armies, paramilitaries, and military contractors; the stockpiling of weaponry; burgeoning state surveillance programs; the colonization of research by the national security state; the circulation of militarized imagery in popu­lar culture; and “the tendency to regard military efficiency as the paramount interest of the state.”5 In militarized socie­ties we are always memorializing past wars, planning for ­future wars, or debating the nature of war, even when we are technically at peace. No one in the world ­today is untouched by militarization. However, given the enormous range of local experiences of the phenomenon, from the immiserated war refugee from Syria to the suburban American happily watching Saving Private Ryan on its flat-­panel living room tele­vi­sion set, it may be as appropriate to speak of militarisms as of militarism. Before ­going any further, we should ask: What exactly is militarism? What is militarization? How are they connected? The historian Richard H. Kohn defines militarization as a wide-­ranging pro­cess that codes “the degree to which a society’s institutions, policies, be­hav­ iors, thought, and values are devoted to military power and ­shaped by war.” He argues that for nearly seventy years, the United States has “experienced a degree of militarization heretofore unknown in American history.” What particularly concerns Kohn is the possibility that American militarization ­will blur into militarism, which he defines as “the domination of war values and frameworks in American thinking, public policy, institutions, and society to the point of dominating rather than influencing or simply shaping American foreign relations and domestic life.” For Kohn—­who served for ten years as the U.S. Air Force’s chief historian and has held vari­ous academic positions at the U.S. Army War College—­militarism is the more acute condition. Kohn’s analy­sis of the post-9/11 era and the subsequent open-­ended “war on terror” raises the 6\n\nGonzález and Gusterson\n\nquestion of “­whether the very character of the American ­people changes [as a result], with the emphasis on freedom and individualism displaced by obedience, discipline, hierarchy, collectivism, authoritarianism, pessimism, and cynicism” (see Kohn 2009).6 It is striking that a scholar with career-­long connections to military institutions would issue such a warning, but ­others who have served the national security state have echoed Kohn’s concerns. Andrew Bacevich, a professor of international relations and a Vietnam War veteran who graduated from West Point, argues that “­today as never before in their history Americans are enthralled with military power.” He warns that “Amer­i­ca ­will surely share the fate of all ­those who in ages past have looked to war and military power to fulfill their destiny. We ­will rob ­future generations of their rightful inheritance. We ­will wreak havoc abroad. We w ­ ill endanger our security at home. We w ­ ill risk the forfeiture of all that we prize” (Bacevich 2005: 1, 255). By observing increases in defense spending (the U.S. military bud­get ­rose from $266 billion in 1996 to more than $700 billion in 2017), the constant growth of the U.S. military arsenal, the worldwide expansion of American military bases, a greater propensity for our leaders to use force as a foreign policy tool, and a “new aesthetic of war” manifested through a sanitized “public enthusiasm for the whiz-­bang technology of the U.S. military,” Bacevich convincingly argues that the rise of American militarism represents a threat to the country’s long-­term viability. More recently, Catherine Lutz (2009b: 23) has noted that “the ascendance of the military came about only relatively recently in US history,” since Amer­ i­ca’s found­ers ­were suspicious of standing armies and used the Constitution as a means of ensuring civilian control over the military. U ­ ntil World War II, most Americans generally “saw the military as a burden in peacetime and at best very occasionally necessary. . . . ​[M]iddle class families ­were reluctant to send their ­children into a military they saw as a virtual cesspool of vices.” Like Kohn and Bacevich, Lutz describes Amer­i­ca’s most recent phase of militarization as a pro­cess that began taking shape seven de­cades ago as the United States mobilized for World War II and then the Cold War, with its protracted blurring of the bound­aries between peace and war­time mobilization. She reminds us that militarization mobilizes a co­ali­tion that includes “all of the institutions and groups who benefitted from a large military bud­get”: Not only weapons manufacturers but companies like Proctor & ­Gamble and the Disney Corporation came to enjoy and rely on im­mense military contracts. US universities w ­ ere drawn up in a concerted government campaign to put much of the nation’s scientific talent and university Introduction\n\n7\n\ntraining at the disposal of the military, to the point where 45 ­percent of all computer science gradu­ate students with federal support get it from the Pentagon, and 25 ­percent of all scientists and engineers work on military proj­ects. The military-­industrial-­Congressional-­media-­entertainment-­ university complex is a massively entangled system. (Lutz 2009b: 28–29) In her book Homefront—an ethnography of Fayetteville, North Carolina, a town located near one of the largest U.S. military bases in the world—­Lutz observes that “­there are many places like Fayetteville in Amer­i­ca, from its nearly nine hundred other domestic military bases in such towns as Norfolk, ­Virginia, New London, Connecticut, and Killeen, Texas, to the thousands of places from Seattle, Washington, to Binghamton, New York, where weapons and equipment are made.” W ­ hether they are military bases or production facilities, they produce ingrained patterns of local economic dependence. The economy, geography, customs, fashions, forms of entertainment, and even values of the United States have been ­shaped by military institutions. Lutz notes: “In an impor­tant sense, we all inhabit an army camp, mobilized to lend support to the permanent state of war readiness that has been with us since World War II.” Militarization truly affects us all, and it may well be the case that U.S. society has become “addicted to war” (Lutz 2001: 3). Lutz’s analy­sis provides us with a glimpse of what the anthropology of militarization means and how it might differ from other disciplinary analyses. Anthropology, which integrates several subfields, including cultural anthropology, archaeology, and physical anthropology, can offer impor­tant insights into pro­cesses of militarism and militarization. The discipline combines empirical methods with culturally informed perspectives and can offer a long-­term historical perspective stretching back thousands of years. It can provide valuable information about the biological consequences of militarism, both on h ­ uman bodies and on ecosystems. Fi­nally, its methods include both cross-­cultural comparison and ethnographic approaches based on long-­term fieldwork and participant observation, which can provide a ground-­level view of how militarism is experienced by t­ hose who are most affected by it. The combination of t­ hese ele­ments can bring a power­ful multidimensional approach not found in other disciplines. A comprehensive review of the anthropology of militarization would include topics beyond the scope of this book, including the anthropology of social conflict, the anthropology of war, and the anthropology of peace and conflict.7\n\n8\n\nGonzález and Gusterson\n\nAncient Militarized Cultures: Spartan, Mongolian, Aztec Of course, the United States is not the first society to follow a military imperative. ­Others have also placed a high value on military prowess and war fighting, but at a cost. It w ­ ill put our analy­sis of con­temporary militarism in broader perspective if we put it in the context of other socie­ties from the historical rec­ ord who or­ga­nized themselves around military conquest and martial virtues. Archaeologists and cultural anthropologists have researched the rise and fall of such cultures in vari­ous regions of the world. Although ­there are many differences among them, they hold in common several salient characteristics. The ancient Greek city-­state of Sparta is among the most famous. It was the dominant military power in Greece for nearly three centuries, beginning in approximately 650 b.c. A male citizen’s primary obligation was to be a good soldier, and Sparta ­rose to prominence on the strength of its infantry. According to Plutarch, Spartan ­mothers bathed their newborn sons in wine rather than ­water to test their resilience. Even more remarkable was the extraordinary dominance of the Spartan state and its institutions. Unlike its rival Athens (and many other Greek city-­states), Sparta was a society in which c­ hildren, particularly boys, ­were separated from their parents at an early age. All boys ­were required to undergo a lengthy, physically challenging collective upbringing called the agoge, supervised by the city-­state’s most prestigious officers. By the time they w ­ ere seven years old, Spartan boys spent part of the day with peers in physical training. Boys w ­ ere subjected to harsh conditioning: they lived barefoot, w ­ ere forced to steal crops to supplement their inadequate rations, and improvised their sleeping quarters. Their overseers brutally punished them with beatings if they ­were recalcitrant or fell short of expectations (Golden 2003: 20). The Spartans placed ­little importance on lit­er­a­ture, the arts, or commerce. Instead, education focused on strength, discipline, and austerity. The agoge made ever greater demands on young Spartans by age twelve, when most Greek boys had completed their schooling. Boys lived in barracks u­ nder constant surveillance from their elders and military officials. They ­were also faced with frequent ordeals, including massed brawls. According to the historian Mark Golden, “Only ­those who proved their fitness could eventually earn election to one of the common messes where Spartan males lived from the ages of twenty to thirty and ate their main meal for thirty years more. The agoge aimed to instill soldierly virtues: strength, endurance, solidarity” (Golden 2003: 20). Introduction\n\n9\n\nPerhaps it is for this reason that the ­great Athenian statesman Pericles once noted that Spartan youth had no childhood at all. A striking effect of this prolonged training was a severed bond between parents and their sons; indeed, Spartan m ­ others and f­athers had no significant role in raising their ­children: “The boy belonged, effectively, not to his own ­family but to the state, and the goal was to produce a strong and efficient military machine whose men w ­ ere loyal only to each other and to Sparta” (Shapiro 2003: 107). The nomadic ­peoples of Mongolia ­were another society that placed ­great importance on war fighting and military expansion. Prior to the thirteenth c­ entury ad, localized raids among dif­fer­ent nomadic groups in that region ­were not unusual, but Genghis Khan managed to e­ ither unite or subdue the vari­ous groups by 1206. Then he and his descendants led the Mongol confederation on a series of conquests that would lead to the creation of the largest empire the world had ever seen. The Mongol army was or­ga­nized in a strict hierarchy, and its fighters w ­ ere ruthless. As it expanded across Asia (and eventually into Eu­rope), the army laid siege to towns and cities. Th ­ ose who refused to surrender ­were often massacred, and surviving soldiers w ­ ere incorporated into the Mongol military. Genghis Khan earned the loyalty of his growing army by distributing the spoils among his soldiers and by promoting officers based on merit rather than kinship. He demanded absolute allegiance. ­These tactical and po­liti­cal strategies ­were grafted onto the nomadic pastoral culture of the Mongols. According to the historian Stephen Turnbull (2003: 26), “To be a Mongol man was to be a Mongol warrior. Th ­ ere is no word in the Mongol language for ‘soldier.’ . . . ​[ T]he ­whole of a Mongol warrior’s daily life was a preparation for war. The same techniques that ­were learnt for survival, for herding or for hunting had direct application in the Mongol campaigns. . . . ​ Mongol society [was] arranged on a war footing.” An essential part of childhood, particularly for boys, included herding and hunting with bow and arrow. Th ­ ese ­things ­were commonly done on ­horse­back; consequently, Mongolian men w ­ ere experts in h ­ orse­manship by the time they ­were conscripted into the army at age fifteen. The Mongol army relied heavi­ly on its cavalry, which allowed it to move, strike, and, if necessary, withdraw from ­battle quickly. But perhaps what is most remarkable about thirteenth-­century Mongol warfare is the fact that the entire ­family—­and the entire society—­was mobilized in support of the Khan’s wars of conquest. In the words of the historian John Masson Smith Jr., “The Mongol armies ­were the Mongol ­people in arms: 10\n\nGonzález and Gusterson\n\nall adult males ­were soldiers, and all ­women, ­children of age to do [sic] herding, and animals served as the logistical ‘tail’ of an army,” resulting in a constantly moving “citizens’ army” (quoted in Turnbull 2003: 26). As the Mongol Empire was disintegrating into smaller entities in the 1400s, Aztec society was beginning to take shape on the other side of the world. It offers yet another example of a culture in which warfare was a central part of the identity of a ­people. The Aztecs settled on an island in the lagoon of Texcoco, situated in central plateau of Mexico, in the 1340s. ­Here they established the famed Tenochtitlán, a sophisticated city connected to the mainland by a series of causeways. Some have suggested that the Aztecs served as mercenaries for other indigenous groups in the region before their ascent to imperial power in the late 1400s (Aguilar-­Moreno 2007: 100). Warfare was a defining feature of Aztec life. It was the means by which they established po­liti­cal and economic hegemony over their empire. Warfare also had religious significance, for most of the victims that the Aztecs sacrificed to their gods ­were captured in ­battle. Military ser­vice was mandatory for all Aztec men. Commoner families, who made up the majority of the population, prepared their sons for the military by having them do hard physical work and by strictly rationing their food. Such hardships w ­ ere designed to instill discipline. By the time they w ­ ere fifteen, boys ­were required to undergo rigorous military training at an institution called the telpochcalli. ­There the lessons of home ­were reinforced and expanded: teams of youth w ­ ere expected to complete public works proj­ects such as the cleaning and repairing of causeways and aqueducts and to carry firewood over long distances. Veteran soldiers trained youth in a series of exercises that eventually culminated in battlefield experience. Experienced soldiers taught novices to shoot arrows, master the use of the atlatl (spear thrower), and deftly swing a maquahuitl (a sawtoothed sword studded with sharp obsidian blades). According to Eric Wolf (1957: 145–47), “Youths w ­ ere taken as apprentices to carry supplies and arms for the instructing warrior when he went to war. . . . ​Eventually, they would be allowed to participate fully in b­ attle and to attempt to capture e­ nemy prisoners for sacrifice.” Mock b­ attles between groups of boys w ­ ere valued highly in Aztec society. Youth who deviated from telpochcalli training ­were publicly humiliated. ­Those who excelled might one day join the ranks of the elite soldiers: the military ­orders known as the ea­gles (cuacuauhtin) and jaguars (ocelomeh). Aztec emperors granted special rights and privileges to the members of the ­orders: “the right to wear other­wise proscribed jewelry and daily military attire, to dress Introduction\n\n11\n\nin cotton and wear sandals in the royal palace, to eat ­human flesh and drink octli (pulque) in public, to keep concubines, and to dine in the royal palaces” (Aguilar-­Moreno 2007: 105). Aztec ­women ­were profoundly affected by warfare. Although they ­were not allowed to become soldiers, ­women defended their families from external attacks, even if that meant jeopardizing their own lives. But as in any society undergoing constant warfare, ­women ­were most directly affected by the real­ity and the effects of death. Aztec ­women frequently lost their husbands, ­brothers, and ­children in ­battle, and the burdens of everyday life ­were heavier as a result. A range of experiences differentiates Spartan, Mongol, and Aztec socie­ties. At the same time, certain commonalities appear: the dominance of state or empire over personal relationships; child-­rearing and educational practices characterized by hard physical training, harsh discipline, and separation from parents; the extraordinary role of military symbols in songs, rituals, and art; a cult of masculinity; and subordination of the ­family unit to the warfare state. Militarism has ­shaped American society, too, though in dif­fer­ent ways. In the twenty-­first ­century, militaristic socie­ties generally do not require boys to be physically separated from their families to be transformed into soldiers. Instead, it is more common for the con­temporary national security state to reach into all aspects of life. In the con­temporary United States, spending on war and defense is generally unquestioned; economic life is tightly tied to the imperatives of war-making, war preparedness, and national “security”; and popu­lar culture is saturated with entertainment—­video games, tv programs, films—­that glorify and normalize militarism. War and ­Human Nature So many socie­ties have engaged in warfare that it is tempting to ask: Is war a part of ­human nature? Are militarism and warfare inevitable? Sociobiologists such as Napoleon Chagnon argue that ­humans have been hardwired by evolution to wage war, and a poll conducted by Zogby International in 2009 revealed that nearly three out of five Americans agreed that “waging war is a part of h ­ uman nature” (Chagnon [1968] 1977, 1988; Zogby 2009). However, a ­great deal of anthropological evidence refutes this assumption. In 1940, in an article that has stood the test of time, Margaret Mead made a distinction between vio­lence (aggression at the interpersonal level) and warfare (a social institution with norms and rules). Vio­lence is found in all socie­ ties; warfare is not. As Mead pointed out, or­ga­nized armed conflict among rival groups—­that is, the institution of warfare—­was unknown in some 12\n\nGonzález and Gusterson\n\nsocie­ties, which did not even have a word for it. Mead noted that some con­ temporary hunting and gathering groups, such as the Inuit of the Arctic region and the Lepchas of the Himalayas, did not engage in war but instead resolved conflicts through other means (Mead 1940). The ethnographic rec­ord reveals that h ­ umans have been creative when it comes to ending conflicts: mediation, duels, ordeals, games and contests, court systems, and other means have all functioned as alternatives to war. More recently, ­others have expanded on Mead’s observations. In his book Beyond War, the anthropologist Douglas Fry identifies seventy-­four “nonwarring” socie­ties, mostly hunter-­gatherers such as the Mbuti of the Demo­cratic Republic of Congo and the Semai of the Malay Peninsula. (Many of ­these socie­ties are not completely f­ ree from vio­lence but have used means other than or­ga­nized armed conflict to ­settle disputes.) The evidence is clear: warfare is not intrinsic to ­human nature. Fry (2007: 2) argues that Homo sapiens has “a substantial capacity for dealing with conflicts non-­violently,” suggesting that this might help humanity pave the way ­toward a ­future in which warring is less common. From an evolutionary perspective, war as we know it is a product of a par­tic­u­lar form of social organ­ization—­stratified state socie­ties—­and only emerged with the first states, approximately six thousand years ago. Occupational specialization was a hallmark of t­hese socie­ties, including occupational specialization of full-­time military specialists—­namely, soldiers. Consequently, prehistoric warfare (small-­scale, ­limited, and episodic) prob­ably emerged ­after the Neolithic Revolution (about twelve thousand years ago). Homo sapiens emerged as a species approximately 200,000 years ago; therefore, h ­ umans have waged war for less than 5 ­percent of their existence as a species. This long-­term perspective makes it clear that war is a relatively recent phenomenon. Peace and social cooperation are much more “normal” (in the statistical sense) than war. Another anthropologist, R. Brian Ferguson (2008: 33–34), has reached similar conclusions. He summarizes his findings in an essay entitled “Ten Points on War” and notes that “Our Species Is Not Biologically Destined for War” and “War Is Not an Inescapable Part of Social Existence.” ­After presenting a devastating critique of t­ hose who argue that h ­ umans have an innate predisposition to vio­lence, including Napoleon Chagnon, Ferguson systematically outlines the preconditions that make war more likely to occur—­namely, sedentary agriculture (which creates settled territory to attack and defend), increased population density, pronounced social hierarchies and occupational specialization, trade (particularly in prestige goods), and rapid ecological transformations. Introduction\n\n13\n\nIn other words, Ferguson argues that war is a relatively recent ­human invention that has spread as humanity has become more agricultural, more or­ga­nized into hierarchical state socie­ties and expanding empires, and more involved in cross-­cultural conquest and trade. ­Here Ferguson’s arguments converge with ­those of the distinguished po­ liti­cal theorist Charles Tilly, who argues that, over centuries of increasing state centralization, “war made the state, and the state made war” (Tilly 1992: 42). And, as Andrew Bard Schmookler (1994) points out, in an environment where some states devote g­ reat resources to war and the preparation for war, t­ here ­will be pressure on neighboring socie­ties to emulate them to protect themselves. It is worth noting that the general anthropological consensus goes beyond ­these points: anthropologists tend to agree that war played a crucial role in the evolution of the state and that states evolved as the most efficient and power­ful war-­making institutions in ­human history (Cohen 1984; Cohen and Ser­vice 1978; Fried 1969; Fried et al. 1968). Ferguson concludes with a disturbing point: “­People have the capacity to learn, even to enjoy, war and build it into their social lives and institutions.” Furthermore, he argues, “Once a given society is internally adapted for war, making war becomes much easier—­a necessity, even, for the reproduction of existing social relations. Commentators have often compared war to a disease, but a more apt analogy is an addiction” (Ferguson 2008: 34, 40). Now that we have briefly discussed war and militarism in historical cross-­ cultural perspective, let us consider the complex and evolving relationship between anthropology and militarism. How War and Militarism ­Shaped Early Modern Anthropology Anthropology has been subtly molded by the priorities of the national security state and the exigencies of other ­peoples’ wars, but ­until recently anthropologists have written ­little about militarism or international conflict. They have written still less about their own relations with the national security state. This is ironic given that modern anthropology crystallized in the context of war. In the United States, anthropology emerged as the state sought to understand and administer native populations in the Indian wars (Borneman 1995). In ­England, Bronisław Malinowski—­a Pole and therefore an e­ nemy alien during World War I—­devised anthropology’s signature methodology of extended participant observation when he was advised, for his own good, to extend his sojourn in the Trobriand Islands for the duration of the war. In 1918, Franz Boas—­often called the “­father” of American anthropology—­was censured 14\n\nGonzález and Gusterson\n\nfrom the American Anthropological Association ­after he publicly decried the secret involvement of anthropologists in espionage in Central Amer­i­ca during World War I. The involvement of anthropologists in the war effort during World War II was even more profound (Price 2008). Anthropologists’ choices of field sites and research proj­ects ­were also often ­shaped by war. Anthropologists have generally sought to avoid field sites engulfed by war, and in the Cold War anthropologists in Eu­rope and the United States found the territory of the Soviet bloc largely off-­limits even as they had easy access to countries controlled by the Western powers.8 Meanwhile, from World War II through the first de­cades of the Cold War many U.S. anthropologists ­were sponsored by the national security state to carry out research on places of interest to the national security state, whereas ­others learned during the McCarthy years not to ask the wrong kinds of questions about the Cold War order (Lutz 1999; Nader 1997). During World War II, a small number of anthropologists in the United States ­were also, in one of the more shameful episodes in the discipline’s history, involved in the administration of internment camps for Japa­nese Americans (Starn 1986). Ruth Benedict’s classic The Chrysanthemum and the Sword ([1946] 1989), a World War II study of Japa­nese national character, exemplifies ethnographic work commissioned by the national security state. It was followed during the Cold War in the United States by more anthropological studies of national character, by the rise of area studies, and by the emergence of a positivistic approach to cultural description that was favored by government agencies. At the same time, many Eu­ro­ pean anthropologists ­were employed by colonial governments in Africa and the ­Middle East to study the cultural practices and structures of social organ­ izations of socie­ties ­under colonial rule to enhance the ability of the colonial governments to control them. The World War II generation of anthropologists, their attitudes ­shaped by the “good war” against fascism, often saw their work for military and intelligence agencies as relatively unproblematic. By the 1960s, a new generation of anthropologists—­trained, ironically, thanks to the educational largesse generated by the gi Bill and Cold War boom years—­began to question anthropology’s private bargains with ­these government entities. This generation questioned (and, according to their opponents, exaggerated) anthropologists’ covert work in the ser­vice of counterinsurgency in Latin Amer­i­ca and Southeast Asia in the 1960s (Berreman 1968; Jorgensen and Wolf 1970). A few anthropologists who had studied the relationship between war and the evolution of the state in the late 1960s began directing some of their attention to modern warfare. Introduction\n\n15\n\nAnthropology ­after the 1960s embodied a strong sentiment against war and militarism, and the American Anthropological Association’s “Princi­ples of Professional Responsibility” (1971) took a clear stand against the kind of covert anthropological work the national security state had sponsored in the past. Given the geopo­liti­cal context in which anthropology grew to maturity, some striking gaps exist in the targets of the ethnographic gaze during the mid-­twentieth ­century. Anthropologists hardly wrote about nuclear weapons; about the U.S. military bases or colonial aggression in the countries where they did their fieldwork or where they lived; or about colonialism, imperialism, or the Cold War as a cultural system—­with a few notable exceptions (Gough 1968). And although the Vietnam War fractured the American Anthropological Association in the late 1960s, anthropologists wrote surprisingly ­little about Viet­nam­ese culture or about the Vietnam War ­until the 1990s. Instead, during the mid-­twentieth ­century, most anthropologists struck an informal bargain with po­liti­cal scientists, ceding to them the international state system while taking for themselves the “tribal zone.” Anthropological Work on Militarism ­after the Cold War One could make a compelling argument that for much of the Cold War, anthropologists suffered from a kind of myopia. Many w ­ ere too narrowly focused on traditional cultural forms u­ ntil militarism, terror, and vio­lence fi­nally began to come into anthropological focus in the 1980s. This change came about partly ­because communal vio­lence and terror in ethnographic sites such as Sri Lanka and Latin Amer­i­ca ­were becoming impossible to overlook, and partly ­because theoretical shifts in anthropology in the 1980s authorized the investigation of new subjects, often by a generation of anthropologists who had come of age during or ­after the Vietnam War. The end of the Cold War also produced new structures of international conflict, stimulating new theoretical and empirical work in response. Numerous anthropologists began documenting and theorizing terror and communal vio­lence in many regions, including Latin Amer­i­ca, South Asia, Northern Ireland, and Africa (see, e.g., Feldman 1991; Kapferer 1988; Manz 1988; Sluka 1989; Tambiah 1986; Taussig 1986). Th ­ ese years also saw the publication of compendia on war, vio­lence, and torture (Nordstrom and Martin 1992; Nordstrom and Robben 1995). During the post–­Cold War era, initiated by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, ­there was a boom in anthropological studies of militarization, war, and vio­lence that 16\n\nGonzález and Gusterson\n\nrepresented a major ethnographic and theoretical advance. This body of work focused on ethnic vio­lence and genocide; research on war and memory; the phenomenology of vio­lence; nuclear weapons; the impact of U.S. military bases; and last, but not least, American militarism. Anthropological research on ethnonational vio­lence and genocide emerged as globalization pro­cesses eroded the state’s old mono­poly of legitimate vio­ lence from above—­through the “transnationalization of military forces” (e.g., via an expanded and more active North Atlantic Treaty Organ­ization)—­and from below, as force was increasingly privatized and subcontracted. The old legitimating ideologies of the Cold War w ­ ere replaced by reinvented ethnonationalisms, and wars took shape in which the stake was identity. Partly ­because most of t­ hese ­were internal wars that sought to s­ ettle the identities of entire populations that contested their place in countries established through conquest and imperialism, 80–90 ­percent of the casualties ­were civilian—­the exact inverse of the military-­civilian casualty ratio at the start of the twentieth ­century, when most wars w ­ ere between states rather than within them. Such wars have taken place in the former Yugo­slavia, Chechnya, Sri Lanka, Somalia, Rwanda/Burundi, and now, Iraq, Af­ghan­i­stan, and Syria (Besteman 1996; Bringa 1996; Hayden 1996; Malkki 1995; Mamdani 2002; Tishkov 2004). The body of work addressing such conflicts is subtle and historically sensitive in its deconstruction of popu­lar deterministic assumptions about ancient hatreds. It is striking that identities that, according to this lit­er­a­ture, are manufactured and contingent are nevertheless so power­ful in mobilizing populations for mass murder and that when nations fractured in the 1990s and 2000s, they often did so along ethnic lines. It is understandable why this would be the case. Many con­temporary nation-­states ­were created in the aftermath of a global history of imperialism during which thousands of more-­or-­less in­de­pen­ dent socie­ties ­were forcibly incorporated into expanding empires, where they ­were redefined as “ethnic groups” rather than autonomous p­ eoples. ­Because they did not give their consent, did not dis­appear or assimilate, and frequently have been exploited and oppressed, it is not surprising that the vast majority of wars around the world ­today are internal wars between ethnonational groups and central governments rather than wars between nation-­states. In addition to researching ethnonational vio­lence and genocide, anthropologists have conducted studies of war and memory, often bearing witness to suffering endured by communities they study. Especially in Latin Amer­i­ca, ­after two de­cades marked by widespread torture, death squad activity, and guerrilla insurgency, some anthropologists have sought (often at risk to themselves) to ensure that their writing speaks for the dead and bereaved and does not contribute Introduction\n\n17\n\nto the culture of silence that often enabled the killing in the 1980s and 1990s (Binford 1996; Falla 1999; Green 1999; Manz 2004; Nelson 2015; Sanford 2003; Sluka 2000).9 Another rich body of anthropological work focuses on the phenomenology of war and vio­lence: how vio­lence works as a set of cultural practices and what it does to p­ eople to live in a society wracked by civil war or state-­sponsored terror. In socie­ties where fear is “a way of life” (Green 1999), one often finds a range of interrelated phenomena: a disabling uncertainty as to what might get one killed and which neighbors and friends might turn into enemies; a sense that the f­ uture has been forever lost; the use of pain and terror to socially disconnect victims; a public culture of silence and denial about atrocities; a pervasive militarization of daily life often lived ­under surveillance; waves of vio­lence that, taking ­people out of everyday mundane real­ity, create a perverse sense of communitas among perpetrators; the sundering of families by death, forced conscription, or eviction; dead, mutilated, and tortured bodies intended by the perpetrators as semiotic messages in a context where victims experience terror and bodily suffering at the very bound­aries of representability; and exaggerated ideologies of masculinity among perpetrators and the feminization of male victims, often achieved in part by the rape of “their” ­women. In situations of prolonged military occupation and re­sis­tance (e.g., in Northern Ireland, the West Bank, and Gaza) such conditions become internalized in pro­cesses of cultural reproduction. Prison detention and torture at the hands of security forces can become rites of passage into adulthood among subordinate populations, often effecting shifts in the balance of power between the sexes and the generations in the pro­cess (Arextaga 1997; Peteet 1992). In the Occupied Territories, for example, the young men of the Intifada have parlayed beatings and detentions into enhanced authority within communities that formerly accorded greater re­spect to an older generation. Meanwhile, weapons training and combat are increasingly common teenage and even preteen experiences, especially in parts of Africa (Singer 2005). A de­cade that has seen increasing anthropological interest in globalization has also produced more studies exploring the transnational linkages of cultures of vio­lence and terror. For example, at the School of the Amer­i­cas (now called the Western Hemi­sphere Institute for Security Cooperation), American military trainers shared techniques with Latin American military officers, many of whom ­were involved in ­human rights violations (Gill 2004). If such violations ­were once legitimated by the U.S. strug­gle against communism, the organ­izing frame shifted to the “war on drugs” in the 1990s and the “war on terror” ­after September 11, 2001. In reference to such conflicts, Carolyn Nordstrom argues 18\n\nGonzález and Gusterson\n\nthat “the w ­ hole concept of local wars is largely a fiction,” since local wars are enabled by a globalized shadow economy of arms traffickers, diamond smugglers, and even nongovernmental organ­ization workers (Nordstrom 1997: 5). Other anthropologists are probing the connection between wars in the Third World and the recent growth of the new mercenaries or “private military contractors” in the burgeoning military ser­vices industry—an industry whose rise is undermining the mono­poly on the legitimate use of vio­lence that Max Weber saw as essential to the modern state (Higate 2012; Li 2015b; Singer 2004). Yet another fruitful area of anthropological research on militarism has focused on U.S. nuclear weapons testing and production. Pacific Islanders and residents of the American Southwest have experienced exceptional suffering, including environmental contamination and high rates of cancer and birth defects (Barker 2003; Johnston 2007; Johnston and Barker 2008; Kuletz 1998; Masco 2006). Nuclear testing has been challenged by antimilitary activists, and several anthropologists have chronicled their efforts (Krasniewicz 1992; Masco 2006). American nuclear weapons laboratories have been the subject of vari­ous ethnographic studies focusing on the web of local relationships within which weapons laboratories are embedded and on the dynamics of simulations in nuclear weapons scientists’ scientific practices. This ethnographic work has also scrutinized the public discourses that legitimate nuclear weapons (Gusterson 1999b; Masco 2006; McNamara 2001). The Anthropology of Militarism in the Twenty-­First ­Century U.S. militarism was almost invisible in anthropology ­until recent years, despite the fact that the United States accounts for nearly 40 ­percent of all global military spending and arms sales in the world while stationing half a million troops, contractors, intelligence agents, and their dependents on nearly eight hundred overseas bases in more than seventy countries. Militarism provides a power­ful set of pro­cesses for structuring the U.S. economy and society, organ­izing U.S. relationships with allies and adversaries, shaping the flow of information in the public sphere, and molding popu­lar culture. A growing body of ethnographic work has focused on military bases, both abroad and at home. By now, it is clear that U.S. military bases abroad contaminate the environment and exacerbate in­equality and ­human rights abuses while military bases at home deplete local resource bases, inflect asymmetrical race and gender relations, and create a privileged category of militarized “super-­citizens.” At the same time, military contracts often have public support ­because they provide a significant boost to state and local economies, even as Introduction\n\n19\n\nthey shift resources away from social ser­vices (Lutz 2001, 2009b; McCaffrey 2002; McLeish 2015; Vine 2011, 2015). Less tangible but equally damaging is the way militarist apol­o­getics have distorted U.S. media coverage of international affairs and helped shape a degraded popu­lar culture saturated with racial and nationalist ste­reo­types, aestheticized destruction, and images of violent hypermasculinity (Bishara 2012; Gibson 1994; Gusterson 1999b; Hammond 2007; Hannerz and Car­ter 2004; Jeffords 1989; Pedelty 1995; Weber 2006). In this cultural milieu, the toxic combination of a smoldering backlash against national humiliation in Vietnam and the hubris of being the world’s only superpower, aggravated by the injuries of 9/11, has produced a virulent militaristic nationalism that threatens both the American way of life and the stability of the international security system (Bacevich 2005; Johnson 2004; Turner 1996). Donald Trump’s electoral triumph is connected to his “Amer­i­ca first” brand of militant nationalism—he has called for “the greatest military buildup in American history,” describes the U.S. military as “the best fighting force in the history of this planet,” and has appointed more generals to positions of power than any president in recent history. In the years following the U.S.-­led invasions of Af­ghan­i­stan and Iraq, the American military began turning to social scientists for help. A few responded by enthusiastically joining the U.S. Army’s ­Human Terrain System (hts) program, an initiative that embedded researchers with combat brigades beginning in 2007. Most anthropologists responded with deep skepticism, and as counterinsurgency theories and methods regained popularity in U.S. military circles, a number of anthropologists responded with critical analyses (González 2009; Joseph 2011; Kelly et al. 2010; Network of Concerned Anthropologists 2009; Price 2011). By 2008, both the American Anthropological Association and the Society for Applied Anthropology expressed concerns over the ethical prob­lems inherent in such an effort. In 2007, the Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association issued a statement strongly condemning the hts, noting that the “Board views the hts proj­ect as an unacceptable application of anthropological expertise” (American Anthropological Association 2007). Unlike during the Vietnam War era, anthropologists conducted a range of studies directly related to the U.S.-­led wars in Af­ghan­i­stan and Iraq (and, more broadly, the so-­called war on terror) during the first de­cade of the twenty-­first ­century: ethnographic interviews with Iraq War veterans who came to oppose the war as well as studies of the challenges facing U.S. combat veterans seeking to reintegrate themselves into civilian life (Gutmann and Lutz 2010; Hautzinger and Scanlan 2013; Wool 2015); accounts of lives ­under occupation in Iraq, 20\n\nGonzález and Gusterson\n\nAf­ghan­i­stan, Kashmir, and elsewhere (Al-­Ali 2007; Aziz 2007; Bhan 2013; Daulitzai 2006; Duschinski 2009; Enloe 2010; Robben 2010; Visweswaran 2013); the development of new technologies of warfare such as drones, virtual wars, and war gaming (Der Derian 2009; Finnström and Whitehead 2013; Gusterson 2016; Sluka 2011; Stroeken 2012); social and psychological studies of the motivations of terrorist groups, as well as the impact on Muslim communities of the “terrorist” label (Atran 2010); studies of the application of law in the “war on terror” (Li 2015a, 2010); an analy­sis of the transformation of the “war on terror” into a new kind of conflict pitting the United States and its client governments in Central Asia and the ­Middle East against “tribal” socie­ties (Nordstrom 2004; Richards 2004); research on how the inhabitants of war zones adapt to living ­under difficult conditions (Finnström 2008; Lubkemann 2008; Măcek 2011; Nordstrom 1997; Tishkov 2004); and studies of situations in which wars have formally ended but po­liti­cal vio­lence or armed conflict continues (Ahmed 2013). It is a telling sign that the U.S. national security state itself has become a subject of anthropological inquiry (Masco 2014; McNamara and Rubenstein 2011). At the same time, military agencies in the United States and beyond (and private military contractors) are increasingly interested in coopting a simplified version of “culture” that can be incorporated into heuristic techniques, computerized algorithms, and predictive modeling software. Looking further afield, other recent anthropological work on militarism and war focuses on a relatively new phenomenon: the rise of nonstate paramilitary organ­izations, including gangs and religious extremists, in postwar settings (Burrell 2014; Campbell 2009; Hoffman 2008, 2011b; Moodie 2012; Muehlmann 2014; Zilberg 2011). The groups tend to be transnational, and in many ways neoliberal economic pro­cesses (e.g., deregulation of capital controls, increasing international trade) and other globalizing trends (e.g., the Internet and social media) have enabled ­these organ­izations—­and their ideologies—to thrive. Anthropologists have recently become interested in analyzing state-­ sanctioned memorializations of war and vio­lence, as well as the use of new biotechnologies and forensics to identify the dead (Ferrándiz 2013; Wagner 2008). Fi­nally, anthropologists have been tracking new attempts to link humanitarianism, disaster relief, and militarization (de Waal 1998; Fassin and Pandolfi 2010; Forte 2014; Tate 2015). The anthropology of militarism and war has broadened in scope, but t­ here are numerous topical and geo­graph­i­cal areas in need of investigation. For example, ­there is ­great potential for ­future anthropological research into the ways in which “formal” wars often lead to cycles of ever more intractable prob­lems Introduction\n\n21\n\nof vio­lence and instability. And ­there is broad agreement ­today among regional scholars that many aspects of the U.S.-­led invasion and occupation of Iraq—­ “de-­Baathification” policies that put thousands of armed military men out of work; wanton incarceration of thousands of Iraqis (many, if not most, of whom ­were innocent); inadequate training of Iraqi security forces; U.S. support for a corrupt Shia-­led government; importation of massive quantities of weaponry, military vehicles, armaments, and so on—­created the conditions by which the self-­styled Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (isis) was able to rise to power. Much work also remains to be done on other militarized socie­ties—­for example, China, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Rus­sia, France, Indonesia, Myanmar, Egypt, Nigeria, India, Sudan, Pakistan, Venezuela, and the United Kingdom. A better comparative understanding of militarism ­will surely lead to more sophisticated theoretical frameworks. Militarism, like capitalism, is a lifeworld with its own escalatory logic that takes dif­fer­ent local forms while displaying fundamental under­lying unities. Despite ­these under­lying unities, local pro­cesses of militarization are invariably rationalized and legitimated as defensive reactions to someone ­else’s militarism from which they therefore differ in moral character. One task for anthropological analy­sis is to unmask such ideological pro­cesses of legitimation. Despite many advances, anthropology still has much theoretical and empirical work to do to illuminate militarism, the source of so much suffering in the world t­ oday. About This Book We have edited this collection as a primer on militarism, viewed from a broadly anthropological perspective. In other words, we have attempted to approach militarism holistically, historically, and cross-­culturally. As we chose the selected readings, we ­were determined to include work that analyzed militarism in its full social, economic, po­liti­cal, cultural, environmental, and symbolic contexts. Readers should note that nearly all of the se­lections are edited or excerpted, in some cases very extensively. We encourage interested readers to seek out the original material for more depth and detail. Collectively, we thought carefully about who to ask to edit each of the constituent sections and tried to approach ­those who have special expertise in that subject area. Our reader begins with section I, “Militarization and Po­liti­cal Economy.” The se­lections analyze how war and militarism have transformed national economies, and how the global movement of weapons, soldiers, and defense contractors have played a role in redistributing wealth and power. 22\n\nGonzález and Gusterson\n\nSection II, “Military L ­ abor,” broadly explores the work of warfare—­from mercenary l­abor in West Africa and U.S. soldiers being displaced by robots to sex workers stationed near military bases. A key theme of this section is that military ­labor is more than just “soldiering.” It encompasses a wide range of auxiliary activities. Section III, “Gender and Militarism,” delves deeply into the ways in which concepts of masculinity and femininity are used for war­time mobilization and to justify killing. The se­lections also call into question cherished assumptions about men’s aggression and w ­ omen’s passivity. Section IV, “The Emotional Life of Militarism,” addresses the question of how ­people in militarized socie­ties grapple emotionally with daily life. What are the structures of feeling, or the po­liti­cal aesthetics that characterize their interactions with ­others? To what extent does fear (e.g., about a terrorist attack or nuclear war) influence the everyday decisions of a person living in militarized state? Section V, “Rhe­torics of Militarism,” analyzes the ways in which words and images are manipulated to make war seem natu­ral and even beneficial, to encourage military action, and to dehumanize enemies. This section also focuses on the ways in which soldiers are transformed into heroes worthy of veneration. In short, it dissects the controlling pro­cesses by which symbols can be deployed to stimulate war fever. Militaristic policies have profoundly altered physical and cultural landscapes. This is the subject of section VI, “Militarization, Place, and Territory.” A wide range of activities—­nuclear testing, military occupation, the creation of checkpoints and barriers, the construction of military bases, the development of “strategic hamlets” and United Nations refugee camps—­have geo­graph­i­cally reshaped space and place. In section VII, “Militarized Humanitarianism,” special attention is given to the growing role of the United Nations, nongovernmental agencies, and relief agencies over the past twenty-­five years. As this pro­cess has unfolded, it has become clear that humanitarian aid has become tightly intertwined with military intervention in many dif­f er­ent regions. The se­lections in this section view ­these changes through a critical lens. Section VIII, “Militarism and the Media,” explores the complicity of journalists with U.S. military operations while noting that journalists have also made impor­tant critical revelations about the U.S. wars in Vietnam, Af­ghan­i­ stan, and Iraq. This section also explores the valorization of warfare by Hollywood and the emergence of the paramilitary hero in popu­lar culture. Introduction\n\n23\n\nSection IX, “Militarizing Knowledge,” explores the long-­standing relationship between American universities and U.S. military and intelligence agencies. Although popu­lar ste­reo­types often cast academics as detached, apo­liti­cal scientists who inhabit ivory towers, the real­ity is much dif­fer­ent. Over the past ­century, many university researchers from both the “hard” and the “soft” sciences have conducted their work in close collaboration with the military, particularly during the Cold War. Section X, “Militarization and the Body,” focuses on the many ways in which war and militarism have physically and physiologically transformed ­humans. More specifically, the se­lections address the question of how ­human bodies have been inscribed, altered, damaged, and destroyed by living in a constant state of war readiness. Disciplinary practices, pharmacological innovations, prolonged exposure to traumatic stress—­all of ­these ele­ments and many more have left indelible marks on ­human bodies and psyches. Section XI, “Militarism and Technology,” explores the aestheticization of military technology and the ideological power of discourses of technical rationality that promises (often mistakenly) victory in war. It is often said of military technology, particularly of nuclear weapons, that “you c­ an’t put the genie back in the ­bottle,” but this section gives the striking historical example of Japan’s decision to eliminate guns ­after they ­were introduced by the Portuguese in the sixteenth ­century. The final section, “Alternatives to Militarization,” provides a range of ideas for lessening the harmful impact of militarism in the world. The goal is to inspire readers to think creatively about ways to build alternatives to war and militarism. To paraphrase Margaret Mead, if war and militarism are ­human inventions, then perhaps it is time for us to recognize that they are obsolete. We hope that this reader ­will play a role in moving us a step closer to that moment of recognition. notes The authors wish to thank Catherine Besteman and Katherine McCaffrey for their ­assistance and advice in preparing this introduction and Gustaaf Houtman for his careful coordination and editorial work.

In 2017, the U.S. Congressional Bud­get Office reported spending nearly $600 billion on the five military branches. This does not include funding for the Department of ­Veterans Affairs, the nuclear weapons program, and related bud­get items. Millions rely on such spending for their livelihoods—­not just the 1.3 million active-­duty troops, but also civilians such as employees of Oshkosh Defense in Wisconsin. However, federal spending for many nonmilitary purposes creates more jobs per dollar spent. Photo­graph courtesy Oshkosh Defense.\n\nS E C T I O N I.

This section includes readings that review several key issues in the po­liti­cal economy of militarization. In each reading, the prob­lem is to explain how militarism shapes economic life, from the class and marriage aspirations of Sri Lankan w ­ omen to the fortunes of the sports industry in the United States or the mining industry in West Africa. Examining the po­liti­cal economy of militarism means looking at how capitalism and the global flow of arms, soldiers, and military contractors have come to redistribute wealth and shape po­liti­cal life globally. It also means coming to understand why military occupations are so widespread and historically long-­lasting in the con­temporary world (Visweswaran 2013). The lit­er­a­ture on the po­liti­cal economy of militarism in the United States identifies the mythic status of two popu­lar beliefs. The first is that objective security threats drive levels of military spending, and the second is that the U.S. population has prospered as a result of that spending. This belief is promoted by a media environment structured around the press releases of military and other government officials that inflate threats and celebrate military ­labor as self-­sacrificing. The second narrative about the economic healthfulness of militarism took off most strongly with the aid of an observed correlation between massive federal spending associated with World War II and the end of the ­Great Depression.\n\nJohn Bellamy Foster, Hannah Holleman, and Robert McChesney begin the section with a history of U.S. corporations’ interest in maintaining a high level of military spending ­after the end of World War II. They build on an early argument (Baran and Sweezy 1966) that the installation of a massive “peacetime” military in the United States was the result of the desire to absorb extensive surplus production capacity via military production. This was a high-­profit and low-­risk enterprise in comparison with nonmilitary production and had the added advantage, when that military was widely deployed overseas, of creating a secure international environment for the accumulation of wealth. Research has identified the opportunity costs of government investment in the armaments industry. The siphoning of research and development (R&D) money and scientists to the work of war has resulted in much more effort g­ oing into creating baroque warships than efficient fishing vessels or more power­ful rocket engines than car motors (Melman 1985). Heidi Garrett-­Peltier (2014) has shown how depressed employment rates have been a direct result of outsize military spending in the 2000s. The next piece in this section includes excerpts from President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s famous “Farewell Speech” on the military-­industrial complex. In it he observed the installation of a permanently high military bud­get through the 1950s and compared it with the small peacetime force and government armories when he joined the military in 1911. In the original draft of the speech, he termed this a “military-­industrial-­congressional complex.” William Astore’s contribution examines how the military-­industrial complex even e­ xtends into the U.S. sports industry, which has intensified its cele­bration of the military—­profiting from it, recruiting to it, and using it to support a politics of authoritarianism. The evolution of capitalism since the last part of the twentieth c­ entury has involved both the erosion of the idea of a national economy and the informalization of the l­abor force, pro­cesses that now shape militarized economies worldwide. Informal militarized ­labor is also on the rise in the form of militias, security guards, and the widespread privatization of military work. In his fieldwork in West Africa, Daniel Hoffman focuses on the ­labor involved in war-making and argues that it needs to be seen within the context of a larger set of spaces where that ­labor is alternately deployed and from which its redeployment in war becomes pos­si­ble. The section ends with excerpts from Carolyn Nordstrom’s work, based especially in extensive fieldwork in the war zones of southern Africa. It identifies the special consequences for ­women of the invisibilization of ­these pro­cesses. 28\n\nCatherine Lutz\n\nReadings 1.1 Excerpts from John Bellamy Foster, Hannah Holleman, and Robert W.

McChesney The United States is unique ­today among major states in the degree of its reliance on military spending and its determination to stand astride the world, militarily as well as eco­nom­ically. No other country in the post–­World War II world has been so globally destructive or inflicted so many war fatalities. Since 2001, acknowledged U.S. national defense spending has increased by almost 60 ­percent in real dollar terms to a level in 2007 of $553 billion. This is higher than at any point since World War II (though lower than in previous de­cades as a percentage of gross domestic product). Based on such official figures, the United States is reported by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (sipri) as accounting for 45 ­percent of world military expenditures. Yet so gargantuan and labyrinthine are U.S. military expenditures that the above grossly understates their true magnitude, which, as we s­ hall see below, reached $1 trillion in 2007.1 Externally, ­these are necessary expenditures of world empire. Internally, they represent, as Michal Kalecki was the first to suggest, an imperial triangle of state-­financed military production, media propaganda, and real/imagined economic-­employment effects that has become a deeply entrenched and self-­ perpetuating feature of the U.S. social order (Kalecki 1972: 96).

Imperialism and Military Spending\n\n29\n\nMany analysts ­today view the pre­sent growth of U.S. militarism and imperialism as largely divorced from the e­ arlier Cold War history of the United States, which was commonly seen as a response to the threat represented by the Soviet Union. Placed against this backdrop, the current turn to war and war preparation appears to numerous commentators to lack a distinct target, despite concerns about global terrorism, and to be mainly the product of irrational hubris on the part of U.S. leaders. . . . Such a view . . . ​downplays the larger historical and structural forces at work that connect the Cold War and post–­Cold War imperial eras. In contrast, a more realistic perspective, we believe, can be obtained by looking at the origins of the U.S. “military ascendancy” (as C. Wright Mills termed it) in the early Cold War years and the centrality this has assumed in the constitution of the U.S. empire and economy up to the pre­sent (Mills 1956: 198). The Permanent War Economy and Military Keynesianism In January 1944, Charles E. Wilson, president of General Electric and executive vice chairman of the War Production Board, delivered a speech to the Army Ordnance Association advocating a permanent war economy. According to the plan Wilson proposed on that occasion, ­every major corporation should have a “liaison” representative with the military, who would be given a commission as a col­o­nel in the reserve. This would form the basis of a program, to be initiated by the president as commander-­in-­chief in cooperation with the War and Navy departments, designed to bind corporations and military together into a single, unified armed forces-­industrial complex. . . . ​Wilson went on to indicate that in this plan the part to be played by Congress was restricted to voting for the needed funds. Wilson . . . ​was articulating a view that was to characterize the U.S. oligarchy as a ­whole during the years immediately following World War II. In e­ arlier eras, it had been assumed that ­there was an economic “guns and butter” trade­ off and that military spending had to occur at the expense of other sectors of the economy. However, one of the lessons of the economic expansion in Nazi Germany, followed by the experience of the United States itself in arming for World War II, was that big increases in military spending could act as huge stimulants to the economy. In just six years ­under the influence of World War II, the U.S. economy expanded by 70 ­percent, fi­nally recovering from the ­Great Depression. The early Cold War era thus saw the emergence of what l­ ater came to be known as “military Keynesianism”: the view that by promoting effective demand and supporting mono­poly profits military spending could help place a 30\n\nFoster, Holleman, and McChesney\n\nfloor u­ nder U.S. capitalism (Cook 1964; Feldman 1989: 149–50; Wilson 1944; “wpb Aide Urges U.S. to Keep War Set-up” 1944). John Maynard Keynes, in his landmark General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, published in 1936 in the midst of the Depression, argued that the answer to economic stagnation was to promote effective demand through government spending. The bastardized Keynesianism that came to be known as “military Keynesianism” was the view that this was best effected with the fewest negative consequences for big business by focusing on military spending. . . . In the 1943 essay “The Po­liti­cal Aspects of Full Employment” and in subsequent essays, Kalecki argued that mono­poly capital had a deep aversion to increased civilian government spending due to its intrusion on the commodity market and the sphere of private profit, but this did not apply in the same way to military spending, which was seen by the vested interests as adding to rather than crowding out profits. If absorption of the massive economic surplus of large corporate capital through increased government spending was the key to accumulation in post–­World War II U.S. capitalism, this was dependent principally on military expenditures, or what Kalecki in 1956 labeled “the armament-­ imperialist complex.” This resulted in a “high degree of utilization” of productive capacity and “counteracted the disrupting influence of the increase in the relative share of accumulation of big business in the national product” (Kalecki 1972: 75–83, 95–97). . . . Mass communication occupied a central place in this imperial triangle. An essential part of Kalecki’s argument was that “the mass communication media, such as the daily press, radio, and tele­vi­sion in the United States are largely ­under the control of the ruling class.” As none other than Charles E. (General Electric) Wilson, then defense mobilization director, put it in a speech to the American Newspaper Publishers Association on April 26, 1951, the job of the media was to bring “public opinion, as marshaled by the press,” to the support of the permanent war effort. . . . (Kalecki 1972; Cook 1964). The result by the mid-1950s was a fairly stable militarized economy, in which intertwined imperial, political-­economic, and communication ­factors all served to reinforce the new military-­imperial order. Kalecki (1972: 96–97) observed that U.S. trade u­ nions ­were “part and parcel of the armament-­ imperialist set-up. Workers in the United States are not duller and trade ­union leaders are not more reactionary ‘by nature’ than in other cap­i­tal­ist countries. Rather, the po­liti­cal situation in the United States, is simply, in accordance with the precepts of historical materialism, the unavoidable consequence of economic developments and of characteristics of the superstructure of mono­ poly capitalism in its advanced stage.” . . . Imperialism and Military Spending\n\n31\n\nMany of Kalecki’s ideas ­were developed further by Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy in 1966 in Mono­poly Capital. Baran and Sweezy argued t­ here ­were at least five political-­economic-­imperial ends propelling the U.S. oligarchy in the 1950s and ’60s t­oward the creation of a massive military establishment: (1) defending U.S. global hegemony and the empire of capital against external threats in the form of a wave of revolutions erupting throughout the world, simplistically viewed in terms of a monolithic communist threat centered in the Soviet Union; (2) creating an internationally “secure” platform for U.S. corporations to expand and monopolize economic opportunities abroad; (3) forming a government-­sponsored research and development sector that would be dominated by big business; (4) generating a more complacent population at home, made less recalcitrant u­ nder the nationalistic influence of perpetual war and war preparation; and (5) soaking up the nation’s vast surplus productive capacity, thus helping to stave off economic stagnation through the promotion of high-­profit, low-­risk (to business) military spending. The combined result of such political-­economic-­imperial ­factors was the creation of the largest, most deeply entrenched, and per­sis­tent “peacetime” war machine that the world had ever seen (Baran and Sweezy 1966: 178–217). Like Kalecki, Baran and Sweezy argued that the U.S. oligarchy kept a “tight rein on civilian [government] spending,” which, they suggested, “had about reached its outer limits” as a percentage of national income “by 1939,” but was nonetheless “open-­handed with the military.” Government pump-­priming operations therefore occurred largely through spending on wars and war preparations in the ser­vice of empire. The Pentagon naturally made sure that bases and armaments industries w ­ ere spread around the United States and that numerous corporations profited from military spending, thus maximizing congressional support due to the effects on states and districts (Baran and Sweezy 1966: 159, 161, 177, 208–11). . . . U.S. militarism was therefore motivated first and foremost by a global geopo­ liti­cal strug­gle but was at the same time seen as essentially costless (even beneficial) to the U.S. economy, which could have more guns and more butter, too. It was thus viewed as a win-­win solution for the U.S. empire and economy. . . . As Eisenhower’s secretary of defense, Charles Erwin (General Motors) Wilson (best known for having created a major flap by saying, “What is good for General Motors is good for the country”), observed in 1957, the military setup was then so built into the economy as to make it virtually irreversible: “So many Americans are getting a vested interest in it: Properties, business, jobs, employment, votes, opportunities for promotion and advancement, bigger salaries for scientists and all that. . . . ​If you try to change suddenly you get into trou­ble” (quoted in Cook 1964: 277, 299). . . . 32\n\nFoster, Holleman, and McChesney\n\nThe need for the gargantuan military-­industrial complex that the United States developed in t­ hese years was not so much for purposes of economic expansion directly (though military Keynesianism pointed to its stimulating effects) but due to the real­ity, as Baran and Sweezy emphasized, that the cap­i­tal­ ist world order and U.S. hegemony could only be maintained “a while longer,” in the face of rising insurgencies throughout the world, through “increasingly direct and massive intervention by American armed forces” (Baran and Sweezy 1966: 205). This entire built-in military system could not be relinquished without relinquishing empire. Indeed, the chief importance of U.S. military power from the early Cold War years to ­today has been that it is used—­either directly, resulting in millions of deaths (counting ­those who died in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the Af­ghan­i­"
