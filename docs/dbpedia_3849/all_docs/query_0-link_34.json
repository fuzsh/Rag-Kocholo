        "text": "As a fundamental research program, the International Technology Alliance (ITA) aims to explore innovative solutions to some of the challenges confronting US/UK coalition military forces in an era of network-enabled operations. In order to demonstrate some of the scientific and technical achievements of the ITA research program, we have developed a detailed military scenario that features the involvement of US and UK coalition forces in a large-scale humanitarian-assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR) effort. The scenario is based ...\n\n: Military Coalitions are examples of large-scale multi-faceted virtual organizations, which sometimes need to be rapidly created and flexibly changed as circumstances alter. The Coalition Agents eXperiment (CoAX) aims to show that multi-agent systems are an effective way of dealing with the complexity of real-world problems, such as agile and robust Coalition operations and enabling interoperability between heterogeneous components including legacy and actual military systems. CoAX is an international collaboration carried out under the auspices of DARPA&#39;s Control of Agent-Based Systems (CoABS) program. Building on the CoABS Grid framework, the CoAX agent infrastructure groups agents into domains that reflect real-world organizational, functional and national boundaries, such that security and access to agents and information can be governed by policies at multiple levels. A series of staged demonstrations of increased complexity are being conducted in a realistic peace-enforce...\n\n: The distributed, heterogeneity, and dynamic nature of the coalition context has raised the need for new advanced technologies. These technologies aim at managing the coalition informational infrastructure, in terms of autonomy, adaptability, and scalability. To achieve this support, Software Agents (SAs) seem to be a promising approach. To develop this approach, different aspects of a coalition has to be identified. These aspects include the coalition structure; the roles and responsibilities held by people within the coalition; the flow of information within the coalition; the capabilities required or available within the coalition; and the context in which the coalition operates. For many of these aspects, SAs can be used. For instance, the coalition structure can be associated with several SAs of different types and with different roles.\n\nappears in Procs KSCO-2002 Military Coalitions are examples of large-scale multi-faceted virtual organizations, which sometimes need to be rapidly created and flexibly changed as circumstances alter.
