        "text": "To those who voted for me\n\nThank You\n\nDebt matters - Your nation, The United States of America, is $35.001 Trillion in the hole, interest payments already exceeds $956 Billion (through July) for 2024. You, your kids and your grandkids are inheriting this nightmare.\n\nThis isn't a game, this isn't a joke; the Gamblers on Wall Street, the Federal Reserve Bank, the Republicans and the Democrats have been blowing smoke up your ass for decades. There is no 15 to 30 second sound bite that can cut through the stench. Reading and math scores in the nation are abysmal, the hand wringing over Fentanyl overdoses and deaths is unconscionable and leaving a $35.001 Trillion mess for the kids is disgusting, the kids got hosed and it is past time to clean things up. This year(2024) interest on the debt is running $3.145 Billion per day; last year (2023) $2.418 Billion per day, year over year increase of over 30%. Interspersed throughout this website are solutions offered. Honest, sincere discussion followed by action will be the only way to get off this highway to hell. These problems are serious, the time for humor is over and there are no participation awards.\n\nYour elected officials, current and former, should have picked up on what caused this nightmare, during the Reagan (R) years the Deficit increased over 185% from all the years previously (Tax Cuts & Starve the Beast); Clinton (D) gutting Glass-Steagall (Unregulating investment banks) and The Commodity Futures Modernization Act (Deregulated Derivatives), Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act, changes in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Sub-prime Mortgage Mess). Cantwell, McConnell, Schumer, Grassley, Murray, Graham, Romney, Biden when he was a Senator, Trump when he was President; these are supposed to be intelligent people, they all should have recognized this. If not then, at least by the time the Debt reached $5 Trillion, sure should have recognized the problem by $10 Trillion. There are two options here, either the political parties and their minions weren't capable of figuring this out or they did not care. If they didn't care the question becomes, Why? Which one or combination of the three options was/is it; Power, Control or Greed? If you want this country back that is what has to be figured out.\n\nWay to many Elected Officials are out of touch with reality; any time somebody is beating the crap out of others, (slamming someones head into the ground, kicking someone in the head or any where else), shooting someone, stealing from others, selling drugs that kill or maim our kids (Fentanyl, Meth) there is already greed or hatred or a general disregard for the well being of people involved, generally society is already dealing with a psychopath or a sociopath. When dirt-bags inflict pain on others through their criminal activity simple prosecution of the crime should be sufficient. When an animal has rabies, you put it down! Adding Hate to the charges is only done because your Elected Officials want you to believe they are actually doing something. They are, they are blowing more smoke up your ass. There are over 30 Million laws on the books, too many are just feel good or special interest legislation..\n\nNot interested in your money, need something more valuable, your time! The equalizer that the Millionaires and Billionaires worry about is your vote, they get one vote each, we all get one vote each. With their money they can obfuscate issues, buy off entrenched career politicians, buy off Federal and Supreme Court Judges and flood Washington D.C. with lobbyists. The only way to stop the Millionaires and Billionaires with their special interest groups and political action committees (PAC's) is the involvement of people who have been steam-rolled by their agenda. The Constitution of the United States starts out with We The People, that means all of us, not just the Special Interest Groups and Political Action Committees. Are we going to continue living this way or opt for change before it is forced upon us; they have already legally stolen hundreds of thousands of people's retirement, they have been sniffing around to \"privatize\" your Social Security and the kids are saddled with $35.001 Trillion National Debt. Your involvement is always optional and the Millionaires and Billionaires prefer it when people don't pay attention. Your call.\n\nDespite being warned, President Woodrow Wilson signed the 1913 Federal Reserve Act. A few years later he wrote: I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men. -Woodrow Wilson\n\n\" Stock Options\" The Destruction of the Middle Class\n\nIn order to attempt to reign in the contempt of the sycophants in public office have for We The Little People because of their Love of Power, Control & Money lets repair a couple problems.\n\nA Constitutional Amendment structured on the 22nd Amendment to include Term Limits for House Members of (2) 5 year terms, Senate Members (2) 6 year terms and Supreme Court Members (1) eleven year term.\n\nReduce the National Debt (35.001 Trillion) to the point that Interest Payments not to exceed $2.5 Million per Hour (currently paying out over $131 Million per Hour, $3.145 Billion per Day). This game of kicking the can down the road needs to end.\n\nInterview with Kyle Pauley https://soundcloud.com/ kxronews/6-27-24-chuck- jackson-for-us-senate.\n\nhttps://tvw.org/video/2024-video-voters-guide-chuck-jackson-2024061156/\n\nSpokane podcast with Tim Binn interactive portion starts at 3 min. 7 seconds\n\nParts of George Washington’s\n\nFarewell Address\n\nTo the People of the United States\n\n224 Years ago\n\nPotentates\n\nAll obstructions to the execution of the Laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels, and modified by mutual interests.\n\nHowever combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of government; destroying afterwards the very engines, which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\n\nI have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party, generally.\n\nThis spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but, in those of the popular form, it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n\nThe alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries, which result, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public Liberty.\n\nWithout looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight,) the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n\nIt serves always to distract the Public Councils, and enfeeble the Public Administration. It agitates the Community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.\n\nPresident Washington's view on Debt\n\nAs a very important source of strength and security, cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is, to use it as sparingly as possible; avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but remembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the debts, which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burthen, which we ourselves ought to bear. The execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it is necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should practically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there must be Revenue; that to have Revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can be devised, which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that the intrinsic embarrassment, inseparable from the selection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties), ought to be a decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the government in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the measures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.\n\nWe the people of the United States of America can not repair that Hell Hole called the Middle East, only they can and they don't really want to; yet\n\nE-Mail from American Muslim\n\nThe Truth and the Lie met one day. The Lie says to the Truth: \"It's a marvelous day, Let's take a bath together, the water is very nice.\" The Truth, suspicious, tested the water and found it really was nice, so they got naked and bathed; but suddenly, the Lie leapt out of the water and fled wearing the clothes of the Truth.\n\nThe Truth, furious, climbed out of the water to get her clothes back but the World, upon seeing the naked Truth, looked away with anger and contempt. Poor Truth returned to the water and disappeared forever, hiding her shame.\n\nSince then, the Lie runs around the world dressed as the Truth and society is very happy - because the world has no desire to know the Truth. Are you interested in the Truth?\n\n*********************\n\nInternational Insanity\n\nThe first steps in repairing a problem is seeing the problem, understanding the problem; acknowledging lack of action will be hazardous to your well being or the well being of your children\n\nThe real reason Afghanistan was invaded: Vast mineral wealth Oct 17, 2011\n\nTrump Finds Reason for the U.S. to Remain in Afghanistan: Minerals / July 25, 2017\n\nMillions in Off-the-books cash was given to President Karzai of Afghanistan, why, was some pay-off for the vast mineral wealth in the previous articles?\n\nOne has to wonder, was it incompetence or malfeasance; $28 Million Wasted on Afghan Uniforms only part of U.S. problem\n\nIt is amazing what can be overlooked when it come to the Love of Money\n\nMade In China, with American Technology - China Removed Secret Equipment From US Spy Plane (2001)\n\nIBM sells PC group (ThinkPad) to Lenovo (China) (2004)\n\nMicrosoft develops Windows 10 version for China’s government (2017)\n\nIn General Electric (G.E.) give-aways to China; Greed pays off big for the CEO (2011)\n\nChinese supremacy - Meet Your New Boss: Buying Large Employers Will Enable China To Dominate 1000s Of U.S. Communities (2013)\n\nEven the Mouse Capitulated: How China Won the Keys to Disney’s Magic Kingdom (2016)\n\nThe Chinese Party Bosses do not care about you, “Tycoon behind Syngenta bid China's most aggressive dealmaker\" (2016)\n\nSmithfield Farm (Foods) is owned by WH Group formerly known as Shuanghui Group, a Chinese Multinational Company.\n\nSome of the Subsidiaries of Smithfield Foods are John Morrell, Cracker Barrel, American Farm, Cumberland Gap Provision Co., Eckrich, Nathan's, Farmer John, Farmland, Armour, Carando, Cook's Ham, Curly's, Gwaltney, Healthy Ones, Kretschmar, Margherita, Sunnyland, Smithfield Packing Company; plus approximately 120 other Companies.\n\nThis is just one Chinese company with that many subsidiaries, any idea how many Cement Plants are Owned/Controlled by the Foreign Entities such as Saudi Arabia, China and Russia; how many Companies, their Subsidiaries and how much land is owned by Overseas Entities.

Although I wasn’t physically dragged to the bus that I caught in a small Eastern Washington town, it was painful in other ways. I recall my mom crying for hours and unwilling to accompany me to the bus to Spokane. Oh yes, I had choices: Go to Canada or go to jail.\n\nI went from Spokane to California and then back to Fort Lewis for combat training for Vietnam. We were all draftees, and I was assigned the position of squad leader. To this day I don’t know why. Not only was I responsible for my life but for the lives of my squad. Off we went to war in September 1966.\n\nAfter a week in combat, I asked myself why we were in another people’s land, killing mothers, fathers, grandparents and, worst of all, children. I have never been able to justify that. To this day that haunts me. So, my focus of the war changed from “killing the enemy” to getting my squad and myself home in one piece. Unfortunately, that never happened.\n\nWhen my year was up, I flew to California, was issued brand-new uniforms and put on a plane to Seattle. Upon arrival, my parents, two sisters and their husbands greeted me at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Hugs and tears flowed. We drove to my sister’s home in Renton for the night before returning home to my small Eastern Washington town. My nephew, in his teens, greeted me and asked, “How many did you kill?” I had to walk outside to regain my composure. I never answered his question.\n\nHere we are 55 years later. A lot has happened over the years. I never see the casualty numbers in the media. I guess the 58,000 American soldiers killed in the war plus some 1,626 still missing don’t mean much today. Nor do the estimated 2 million Vietnamese civilians, or the 275,000 to 310,000 Cambodians or 20,000 to 62,000 Laotians. Always wondered how they celebrate veterans day in those countries.\n\nYes, I am a bitter old man, one who has never shared my experiences in Vietnam with anyone, including my family. No one wins wars. Times were different in Iraq and Afghanistan, as the U.S. soldiers were volunteers. But the results were the same. No one won. Were those wars worth it?\n\nSo come Nov. 11, I may be thanked for my service. To this day I don’t know how to respond. Probably nod my head and walk away.\n\nDenny Wagenman\n\nMilitary service: The ghosts of Vietnam\n\nNov. 18, 2022\n\nThe Seattle Times\n\nBy John Humnicky, Woodinville\n\nI read the guest essay by Denny Wagenman about his reluctance to be “proud” of his tour in Vietnam in 1966. I share the same feelings about this war as Wagenman. Although my “conscripted” tour in Vietnam wasn’t until 1971, I asked the same questions that Wagenman outlined in his essay. Why were we in another people’s country killing fathers, mothers, grandparents and children? Apparently, nothing much changed between 1966 and 1971. There were no heroics, no charges of the light brigade and no obvious displays of valor or sacrifice. All there seemed to be was an attitude of making it out alive and in one piece.\n\nNow, 52 years later, I still dwell upon these questions. I do not feel “proud” of what we accomplished in Vietnam. When I came home through Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, I was jeered at, yelled at and spat at for being a “baby killer.” When people thank me today for my service, I’m like Wagenman: I nod and walk away.\n\nJohn Humnicky, Woodinville\n\n41 Senate Republicans Voted Against Veterans' Healthcare\n\nJuly 2022\n\nA bill aimed at protecting veterans exposed to toxic materials during their service was shut down yesterday in the Senate, in a 55 to 42 vote that failed to meet the 60-vote threshold necessary to advance the legislation.\n\nThe new legislation would expand care to 3.5 million veterans who were exposed to burn pits, adding 23 toxic and burn pit exposure-related illnesses to the VA database.\n\nThe bill would also expand support for Vietnam-era veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange in places like American Samoa, Cambodia, Guam, Johnston Atoll, Laos and Thailand.\n\nWhat's killing Staff Sergeant Wesley Black?\n\nThe VA doesn't want to talk about it\n\nThe unseen toll of traumatic brain injuries\n\nVietnamese children and the effects of Agent Orange\n\nWasn't just the Veterans that had a knife shoved in their backs and twisted around.\n\nYep, still wondering why I bother to go church; I truly want to understand how any mainline churches can support these grubbers, they are nothing to be proud of or write home about.\n\nThese are the 41 Republican Senators who voted against the bill:\n\nMitch McConnell & Rand Paul, Kentucky ; Jim Inhofe & James Lankford, Oklahoma; John A. Barrasso & Cynthia Lummis, Wyoming; Marsha Blackburn & Bill Hagerty, Tennessee; Roy Blunt & Josh Hawley, Missouri; Mike Crapo & Jim Risch, Idaho; Mike Braun & Todd Young, Indiana; Richard Burr & Thom Tillis, North Carolina; Bill Cassidy & John Neely Kennedy, Louisiana; Deb Fischer & Ben Sasse, Nebraska; John Cornyn & Ted Cruz, Texas; Cindy Hyde-Smith & Roger Wicker, Mississippi; Mike Rounds & John Thune, South Dakota; Richard Shelby & Tommy Tuberville, Alabama; Mike Lee & Mitt Romney, Utah; Tom Cotton, Arkansas; Kevin Cramer, North Dakota; Steve Daines, Montana; Joni Ernst, Iowa; Ron Johnson, Wisconsin; Roger Marshall, Kansas; Rob Portman, Ohio; Rick Scott, Florida; Tim Scott, South Carolina; Dan Sullivan, Alaska; Patrick Toomey, Pennsylvania\n\nJon Stewart, the former talk show host who's become a high-profile veterans advocate, lambasted the Republican senators in a furious, expletive-laden speech.\n\nStewart noted at one point that the lawmakers being addressed were likely indoors enjoying air conditioning, ignoring the veterans — at least one of whom was wearing an oxygen tube — braving the scorching heat for over an hour to try to make their point.\n\n\"You don't support the troops,\" he said. \"You support the war machine.\"\n\nThis site accepts no outside money and has been online since 2004.\n\nIf you run across an ad getting to this site do not open;\n\nThere are no sanctioned ads on this site\n\nSite contains over 400 articles and runs over 4000 pages.\n\nHave been questioning the wisdom of running up these kinds of debts,\n\ndeficits and interest payments dating back to the spring of 1992.\n\nIf you have questions may this site help some in your search for answers.\n\nEditor: Insanity Rules.org\n\nNext Page"
