He saw it in the devotion they exhibited during the Civil War. As he stood by the beds of dying soldiers in Washington, he marveled at the way they faced death and their refusal to show \"cowardly qualms.\" Their gallantry, in the opinion of the noted poet, was rooted in their dreams of democracy. The movements of the late secession war and their results, to any sense that studies well and comprehends them, show that popular democracy, whatever its faults and dangers, practically justifies itself beyond the proudest claims and wildest hopes of its enthusiasts. Probably no future age can know, but I well know, how the gist of this fiercest and most resolute of the world's war-like contentions resided exclusively in the named, unknown rank and file; and how the brunt of its labour of death was, to all essential purposes, volunteered. The People of their own choice, fighting, dying for their own idea, . . . not for gain or even glory, nor to repel invasion—but for an emblem, a mere abstraction, for the life, for the safety of the flag.1 How accurate was Whitman? Was patriotism in America largely grounded in the aspirations of its people for democracy and equal rights for all? At plenty of moments in American history this certainly appeared to be the case. Abraham Lincoln told his audience at the Gettysburg battlefield in 1863 that the sacrifices made at the site were justified only if living Americans continued to foster the creation of a nation of equals devoted to the principles of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. A century later Martin Luther King, Jr., in a speech to demonstrators for civil rights insisted that the nation must deliver on its promise of equality for all citizens. Both Lincoln and King were patriots: they saw their fates interconnected with the This introduction has benefited from the valuable criticisms of Casey N. Blake. The entire collection benefited from the assistance of Barb Truesdell and Beth Glenn. 1 Walt Whitman, \"Democratic Vistas,\" in Leaves of Grass and Other Selected Prose, ed. Ellman Grasnow (London: Everyman, 1993), 616-19.\n\n4\n\nJOHN BODNAR\n\ndestiny of other citizens in a common project to build a democratic and egalitarian society.2 But there were other rationales for serving flag and country. In 1782, George Washington rebuked an officer of the Revolutionary Army for suggesting that he accept the crown of a king as a reward for the role he played in serving the new nation. Washington felt that virtuous men manifested loyalty by serving the common good with no expectations of return. The first president said nothing about creating a nation of equals, but he did aspire to the values of eighteenth-century republicanism and its promise of a society where prominent men would serve and govern the public rather than tyrannical despots or the \"unknown rank and file.\" And what are we to make of the loyalty of either Boston protestors in 1976 who carried an American flag to denounce \"antiwar hippies and radical blacks\" and defend their working-class neighborhood against government plans for school integration or Ku Klux Klan organizations in the 1920s that sought to purify their nation of certain religious, ethnic, and racial groups? They did not appear to be calling for either more virtue or democracy. But how do these citizens relate to the views of Lincoln or Whitman? This collection of essays on the manner in which Americans defined their patriotism describes a people with a complex understanding of the nature of loyalty and affiliation. The beliefs of Lincoln and Whitman were widely shared and central to American political thought over time. But patriotic thought could be a maze within both the minds of individuals and the nation as a whole. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, citizens were influenced powerfully by the ideas of republicanism and classical liberalism. They often blended ideals of service to the common good of all with hopes for a nation that would insure individual freedom from any form of tyranny. Frequently, their veneration of universal ideals such as virtue masked more particular goals of male domination. In the twentieth century, the articulation of specific goals in patriotic language became more pronounced. Workers invoked the traditional symbols of freedom and democracy to call for the right to unionize, and women asked for fairness from their government in the quest to meet family and career responsibilities. But Americans also debated more extensively the issue of national power. Some patriots attacked the state for wielding excessive influence over their private lives. Others applauded the dominance of the nation over other nations. Throughout this collec2 Roy Basler, ed., Abraham Lincoln: His Speeches and Writings (Cleveland: World Publishing, 1976), 577, 579-91, 734; Joyce Appleby, Liberalism and Republicanism in the Historical Imagination (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992), 1-3, 20-24; James Melvin Washington, A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings of Martin Luther King, Jr. (San Francisco: Harper Collins, 1991), 217-20.\n\nT H E A T T R A C T I O N S OF P A T R I O T I S M\n\n5\n\ntion of essays we must keep in mind an important point made by Merle Curti, a pioneer in the study of American patriotism: loyalty in the United States derived its strength from its ability to accommodate several interests at once.3 In the late twentieth century, the need to understand the tangled history of this patriotism is compelling. Some Americans feel that their fellow citizens have lost many ties they formerly had to their country. This anxiety over loyalty has revolved to a great extent around the issues of multiculturalism and individualism. Lewis Lapham, editor of Harper's Magazine, wrote in 1992 that he felt himself to be just a \"plain American\" because he could not place an adjective before his nationality. He lamented that citizens now only \"acquire a presence as an old American, a female American, a white American, a rich American, a black American, a gay American, a poor American, a native American, or a dead American. \" When Lapham argued that the subordination of the noun to the adjectives mocked the \"democratic spirit,\" he meant to affirm the universalist character of the liberal view of patriotism and critique the more insular expressions of various groups. Inferentially, he also rejected the twentieth-century pattern of expecting rights and benefits from the liberal state as a grounds for loyalty, although such expectations may explain the proliferation of narrow identities he abhors.4 Authors like Arthur Schlesinger and Allan Bloom crafted best-selling books that discussed the threat of multiculturalism to the existence of the American nation. Both writers felt that the increased veneration of racial, gendered, and even individual identities poses a distinct threat to the common project of nation building. Schlesinger scolded extremists who distorted the teaching of United States history for the sake of engendering pride in minority groups. The prominent historian feared that minorities were forgetting that, in the absence of common ethnic and racial origins, the United States was held together by adherence to \"ideals of democracy and human rights.\" For Schlesinger a \"cult of ethnicity\" had emerged among minorities that challenged the dream of creating \"one people.\"5 3 Washington's letter of rebuke, along with other \"republican\" expressions of patriotism, is reprinted in William J.

Norton, 1992), 102-26.\n\n6\n\nJOHN BODNAR\n\nAllan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind located the threat to national unity and loyalty in the selfishness of individuals rather than in the group-based interests of minorities. In place of Schlesinger's \"multicultural zealots,\" Bloom saw the nation threatened by egocentric citizens who appear to have few group attachments of any kind. Thus, he saw the sexual revolution, rising divorce rates, and an overall transformation in private life as destructive of social stability. Like Schlesinger, he also detested the fragmentation of the educational curriculum and the failure to teach a common core of subjects that offer instruction in human values and civic responsibility. Both authors, to an extent, longed for a return of past ideals: Schlesinger for Whitman's and Bloom for Washington's.6 The persistent critique of narrow interests and group loyalties and the quest for a common ground originated, moreover, in more than just the fear of social fragmentation. It also represented a deeply held belief in American exceptionalism. The political culture of the United States was thought exemplary in its ability to moderate group differences through its faith in the notion of equality and democracy. And to a great extent this was a true, if at times myopic, point of view. Modern studies of nationalism, in fact, demonstrate just how unique the idea of a nation totally committed to \"democratic vistas\" has been. For instance, after visiting modern battlefields of nationalism in Croatia, Serbia, and the Ukraine, Michael Ignatieff distinguished civic nationalism from ethnic nationalism. The former affirms that a nation is composed of citizens, equal regardless of their special identities; such a political community is held together by a patriotic attachment to the ideals of equal rights and democracy. To the contrary, ethnic nationalism (or any particularistic form) fosters the idea that a community of racial, ethnic, or religious groups defines the individual and the nation. The fundamental appeal to loyalty is usually made as part of an effort either to defend the political community against external threats or to purify it of unwanted elements within the community. Equality, reciprocity, and fairness do not count for much in this conception.7 Scholars now acknowledge, perhaps more than they once did, that nationalism is greater than a dream of equality and that narrower interests 6 Allan Bloom, The Closing of the American Mind (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1987). 7 Michael Ignatieff, Blood and Belonging: Journeys into the New Nationalism (New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1993), 7—11. For a discussion on the appeal of equality and fair treatment for all citizens as a basis for nationalism and patriotism, see Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread of Nationalism (London: Verso, 1991), 141—54. For an incisive and fresh discussion of the idea of America's unique political culture, see Michael Kammen, \"The Problem of American Exceptionalism: A Reconsideration,\" American Quarterly 45 (March 1993): 1-43.\n\nTHE\n\nATTRACTIONS\n\nOF\n\nPATRIOTISM\n\n7\n\nwere never far removed from the politics of nationhood. As Tony Judt has incisively suggested, the \"optimistic universalism\" of the liberal vision may have been confined only to a \"few fortunate people and places during the past two centuries.\" Most nationalisms, in fact, have emerged from encounters with external forms of power and fears of further domination by others, often generated in the breakup of old empires. This was certainly the case for Greece as it emerged out of the old Ottoman Empire or Croatia as it grew from what was Yugoslavia. Liah Greenfeld has underscored the point that nationalism almost always promises self-respect and relief from domination by others. Thus, she argues that ethnic forms of nationalism make people feel better (and more secure) than civic nationalism with its unspecified pledge of equality. I would add that they are also potentially more attractive than simple but earnest calls to moral action and selflessness. Put another way, it may be easier for people to feel self-respect in belonging to a group of heroic soldiers, proud blacks, or chosen Protestants than to a larger, unspecified community of equals. Greenfeld argues correctly that the United States went further in achieving civic nationalism and liberal patriotism than nearly every other country, and in this sense it is unique. She attributes this to its rich legacy of English liberalism and to the New World's absence of entrenched hierarchies that usually counter such liberal impulses. But this collection also suggests that the attachments to particularistic loyalties—gendered, ethnic, racial and religious—were not only pervasive (which most people know), but also fundamental to popular understandings of patriotism. As much as most of us want Lincoln to be our hero, his vision was modified throughout American history.8 This is the import of a recent essay by political scientist Rogers M. Smith. Directly confronting the myth that American politics has been largely dominated by the adherence of its people to free and egalitarian ideas, Smith advances a more nuanced view. He prefers to talk of \"multiple traditions\" when describing American political culture.9 From the beginning of the American nation, political culture was variegated. The republican attempt to create a society in which public affairs were conducted by men in a disinterested fashion and animated by virtue rather than self-interest was never a true reflection of what most citizens thought and felt. Republican patriotism was fixed on the notion of selfsacrifice for the good of all, but it was extended by liberal aspirations for a more democratic and equal society. The problem with republicanism 8 Liah Greenfeld, Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992), 400-484; see also Tony Judt, \"The New Old Nationalism,\" The New York Review of Books 42, no. 10 (26 May 1994): 44-51. 9 Rogers M. Smith, \"Beyond Tocqueville, Myrdal, and Hartz: The Multiple Traditions in America,\" American Political Science Review 87 (September 1993): 549—66.\n\n8\n\nJOHN BODNAR\n\nwas its failure to address the democratic and special aspirations of the masses. As Gordon Wood has so brilliantly explained, the egalitarian impulses inherent in the republican dream of replacing a monarchy with a society of virtuous citizens gave way to the stronger attraction of equality and democracy. Most leaders of the American Revolution would not have been comfortable with fostering such a pervasive leveling of American society, but the issue moved beyond their control. By the era of the Civil War, as James M. McPherson discovered in reading letters and diaries, soldiers in both the North and the South were moved to fight because of a genuine belief in the ideas of freedom and liberty. The Union men saw their ideal threatened in the attempt to destroy national solidarity; rebels viewed the federal government as a danger to their states' rights version of political aspirations. But equality was not just an end in itself. Even in the eighteenth century, Wood is quick to note that both republicanism and liberalism had limits. While people eagerly pursued democracy, they also attempted to use their membership in the new nation and their \"equality\" to secure private interests. \"Everywhere,\" Wood writes, \"the 'tender connections among men' that the Revolution was supposed to foster were being 'reduced to nothing' by 'the infinite diversities of family, tribe, and nation. '\" In both the American past and present the pursuit of equality involved the quest for advantage as well.10 The expression of narrow interest became so widespread by the middle of the nineteenth century that some political leaders sought to defend and expand the power of the central government more forcefully over its constituent parts. At this point in the nation's history Lincoln purposefully transformed the notion of liberalism that had inspired so much patriotism and national sentiment. In the crisis of the Civil War, Lincoln concluded that it was no longer sufficient to venerate the ideals of popular government and equal rights alone. As J. David Greenstone has so effectively argued, the sixteenth president realized that political institutions now had to intervene in society and resolve moral issues such as slavery. Unlike many abolitionists who felt that moral problems could be settled by attempts at transforming the ethical outlook of individuals, Lincoln, retaining his faith in democracy and equality, now added the ideal of an activist state to the ideology of American liberalism. He could not, of course, foresee the vast expansion of state power in response to industrial capitalism in the twentieth century. Lincoln raised the expectations of citizens by inferring that the state could not simply represent 10 Gordon Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York: Knopf, 1992), 249-52; James M. McPherson, What They Fought For, 1861-1865 (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1994), 6, 9, 35-36.\n\nTHE ATTRACTIONS OF PATRIOTISM\n\n9\n\nideals but had an obligation to engage in practices that would correct injustices in the real world. He would not ask citizens simply to have faith in American ideals as Schlesinger did. Rather, he offered the possibility that American political institutions could not expect support if they did not actively pursue a just society.11 Following the war and Lincoln's death, the powers of the central government and the state steadily increased, although not always in pursuit of equal rights for all. Curti demonstrated how the conception of the nation as an organic whole that subordinated the interests of its various parts—states, classes, ethnicities—emerged more forcefully in the late nineteenth century. This movement, however, was not some falsehood foisted by powerful industrial leaders to facilitate the growth of a national, capitalistic economy; rather, it was a joint effort of managerial, professional, labor, agricultural, and cultural ranks to create a new form of state-managed liberalism, often called corporate liberalism. Unfairness was not eradicated, and equality remained an unfulfilled dream. New immigrants, African Americans, and women certainly held marginal voices in this political world. But the direction was toward some form of accommodation between many constituent parts of society under the aegis of a strong state. Leading political figures like Theodore Roosevelt staunchly defended the concept and combined a belief in state power over private interests, a love of country transcending devotion to any section or class, and the need for reciprocity. Roosevelt could not see how allegiance to the country could exist if the country did not make life worth living for its diverse citizens.12 The activist role of the liberal state became so great by the 1930s that economic justice and industrial democracy became its stated political goals. In the twentieth century equality was pursued through organized groups who used the state to advance their interests and return their loyalty in the form of influence or benefits. They did this not because they had abandoned hope in popular government and equal rights but because they now believed, as Lincoln did, that state intervention was necessary for attaining a liberal society. The New Deal favored working men and class interests over matters more defined by race and gender, but the administration of Franklin Roosevelt did attempt to redistribute political power to workers and farmers so that they could compete effectively against business and acquire the wages needed to sustain a consumerist 11\n\nJ. David Greenstone, The Lincoln Persuasion: Remaking American Liberalism (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), xx-xxxii, 244-54, 284-85. 12 Curti, The Roots of American Loyalty, 92-93, 174-79, 196-97; John Bodnar, Remaking America: Public Memory, Commemoration, and Patriotism in the Twentieth Century (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992), 28; Martin J. Sklar, The Corporate Reconstruction of American Capitalism, 1890-1916 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), 35-36.\n\n10\n\nJOHN BODNAR\n\neconomy. As Gary Gerstle has shown, the New Deal was able to tap a \"reservoir of patriotism\" from the American public because it was perceived to be in part a \"moral crusade\" for economic justice. Workingclass leaders now joined the traditional liberal language of equal rights and democracy with the mechanism of an activist state.13 Not until the 1960s, when the liberal state was attacked by various groups for its policies regarding race and South Vietnam, did Lincoln's idea of a state that resolved moral issues and Roosevelt's notion of one that settled economic issues fall into disfavor. Certainly some patriots felt Roosevelt's path toward state management of social life was contrary to older traditions and, therefore, unpatriotic. During the 1940s the government relied on both traditional liberal promises of egalitarianism and modern ones of rewarding loyal citizens to generate support for its war policies. But in the 1960s an erosion of faith in an activist liberal state opened up public space for celebrations of power and particularistic loyalties in ways that resembled the 1920s. Thus, lower middle-class whites used patriotic symbols and language to resist court-ordered (and statesponsored) integration of their schools and neighborhoods because they no longer felt the state supported their moral views. Various religious groups fervently opposed the state sanction of a woman's right to an abortion and the plan to pass an equal rights amendment to the constitution. Black power advocates and radical feminists expressed reservations toward any form of veneration of the liberal state, an institution they saw as merely a bastion of white male domination. The demise of the liberal state continued into the 1980s and 1990s with victories by conservatives who sought to dismantle or alter much of the liberal agenda. Indeed, precisely at the moment when the activist state lost much of its hold over the popular imagination did public anxiety over patriotism and national cohesion emerge so forcefully. Today, what Raphael Samuel has written of postwar Great Britain can be applied to the United States: \"these years have seen a decline in the majesty of the state . . . and a valorization of the private at the expense of the public sphere.\"14 13\n\nSee Steven Fraser, Labor Will Rule: Sidney Hillman and the Rise of American Labor (New York: Free Press, 1991), 330; Gary Gerstle, Working-Class Americanism: The Politics of Labor in a Textile City, 1914-1960 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989).

Marian Wright\n\nT H E A T T R A C T I O N S OF P A T R I O T I S M\n\n11\n\nThis collection intends to demonstrate that, indeed, the nature of patriotism in the United States is controversial. The appeal of egalitarianism and the promise of democracy is powerful but limited. Throughout U.S. history desires for a more equal society have clashed with sectarian aspirations of purity and dominance. The attempt to encase patriotism within the dream of equality or the call to virtue was contested by many who sought rewards for their loyalty in more explicit forms or wanted to realize desires for power and mastery. The liberal version of patriotism was an agreement between not only citizens and the nation but also citizens themselves. Each person had to respect both the nation-state for its ability to protect the ideal of equality and the right of fellow citizens to fair treatment. The attempt to direct loyalty to the nation-state alone, an effort that consumed much time in the past, was never a guarantee that citizen rights would be protected. And citizens saw this flaw. As this collection of essays shows, the call to obligation toward the nation and exhortations toward virtuous behavior, which punctuate the culture today, were continually refashioned by popular expressions of equality, justice, self-interest, and power. By taking Washington, Whitman, Lincoln, and King further than they wanted to go, these essays suggest that the meaning of patriotism in America was molded by competing understandings of what the nation should be. Lincoln's terms of loyalty were sustained and expanded to an exceptional extent; alternative versions abounded. Contemporary disputes over whether patriotism is disappearing in the United States, as a matter of course, almost never raise the issue of how its citizens have defined their allegiance. Our bonds of affection have always been subjected to complex interpretations. The earliest view of a virtuous nation of equals gave way by the late nineteenth century to a dream of a powerful nation rooted in the desires of powerful men and women who supported it for order and moral certainty at home and in the world. This position, often presenting patriotism as a virtue, was heavily influenced by the more aggressive sentiments of nationalism and the quest for domination of others, both inside and outside the United States. In this version true patriots were often represented as male warriors. Alternatively a liberal version of patriotism was grounded in the hope of fair treatment for all citizens.

In the twentieth century this outlook involved a more explicit call for reciprocity from the nation in the form of state intervention in both private and public life and in the form of benefits. Because all people and groups are susceptible to the attractions of power and justice, and because both coexisted in the language of patriotism, its appeal frequently crossed class, ethnic, regional, and gender borders and took unexpected turns. Citizens used patriotism for good and for malice. Thus, this history of patriotism cannot be confused with our society's endless calls for patriotism by voices that are often more partisan than they appear. In the early nineteenth century, as Cynthia Koch shows, the public discussion over patriotism was dominated by the tenets of republicanism and the standpoints of powerful men. George Washington stood as an emblem: a citizen who served his country to promote the common good, and a male who protected women. Asking for nothing in return, he acquired power but did not want to keep it. His philosophy of republicanism certainly sought to create a society more just than the one it replaced. But it also moderated drives toward democracy and equality, not by venerating national power, but by celebrating virtue. After the Civil War the opinions of males, especially veterans and businessmen, continued to dominate the discourse over patriotism. But the essays of Cecilia O'Leary, Stuart McConnell, Gaines Foster, and Andrew Neather demonstrate that agreement over the meaning of loyalty in the late nineteenth century was not easily achieved. Despite a strong tradition of republicanism and the pleas of Lincoln at Gettysburg to link loyalty and democracy, the doctrines of virtue and equality were widely challenged. This collection explains that the period from the Civil War to World War I presented American citizens with new problems that forced them to redefine their notion of faithfulness. The emasculation of southern manhood, the need for political reconciliation, the intensification of class conflict, and the acquisition of economic and world power all combined to encourage a greater idealization of male warrior heroism and aggressive nationalism at the expense of older republican and democratic dreams. O'Leary's work shows that the drive for reunification resulted in the valorization of battlefield deeds and the creation of heroic warriors by veterans in both the North and the South. The veteran construction of patriotism not only replaced the focus on virtue with valor but also eradicated the patriotic struggle for black rights from the public memory of the war. A militaristic, masculine sense of nationalism alone could not hope to attract the interest of men and women in a society as diverse as the\n\nTHE\n\nATTRACTIONS\n\nOF P A T R I O T I S M\n\n13\n\nUnited States, however. Stuart McConnell explains that a determined effort emerged in the 1890s to create an even more abstract form of national unity that could appeal to various regions and groups. As American society simultaneously became more integrated economically and more diverse culturally, an attempt was made to fashion patriotic symbols that would appeal to the broadest possible segment of the nation. McConnell's study of the \"patriotic boom\" of the 1890s suggests that the ideals of republicanism or liberalism were insufficient to sustain loyalty by themselves in the face of growing class and ethnic conflict and inequality. Thus, to reduce the attachments people had to vernacular symbols, the veneration of patriotic symbols like the national flag was intensified. Andrew Neather offers a unique contribution: he demonstrates that the forces celebrating greater national unity and power met resistance from the old attachment some Americans had to the ideals of equality. Neather shows that the late-nineteenth-century working class made a determined bid to use patriotic messages and symbols to sustain the notion of equality, but a spirit of empire and commerce cut the proletarians short. Responding to the longing of many males for domination over others, workers and businessmen rallied to a vision of empire and loyalty that was determined more by nationalist than by democratic aspirations. The idea of a powerful nation-state became so pervasive by 1900 that, as Gaines Foster implies, it could successfully compete with older religious loyalties that had been deeply held for years. Although many Americans continued to believe that the nation was part of God's overall plan, reason enough to elicit their loyalty, the grounds for patriotism were becoming more secular than sacred and implicated in the lust for power to a greater extent than the dream of fairness. The triumph of state liberalism was pivotal to the history of patriotism in the twentieth century. Although based partially in an attempt to insure justice for workers, farmers, professionals, and businessmen, state liberalism also led more directly to the glorification of state power and a more robust form of nationalism. This fact ultimately had two crucial implications for our times. First, a powerful state was inevitably a masculine state—a reflection of male longings for dominance at home and abroad. The gendered aspect of loyalty was fortified by the tumultuous experience of warfare in this century and the opportunity it created to venerate the sacrifices of male warriors for the nation. Second, the awesome power of the state turned it into a battleground. Conservatives who feared the authority of the state but not the concept of authority mounted efforts to protect local interests from a centralized government. This idea was manifested by the marchers in Boston in 1976 as well as by the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s or the Moral Majority in the 1980s. Liberals,\n\n14\n\nJOHN BODNAR\n\nhowever, retained a faith in the state to both promote fairness and reward loyalty in just and beneficial ways. Thus, modern feminists who worked for more government money for child care also thought of themselves as patriotic. They proved the assertion that Kimberly Jensen makes in her essay: the more the state demanded of its citizens, the more they were able to ask in return. Dreams of power and dreams of fairness continued to collide to an exceptional extent even in wartime. The essays of Kimberly Jensen, David Glassberg and J. Michael Moore, Lawrence Samuel, and Robert Westbrook reveal how crucial war is to the modern definition of patriotism and how much it forces the state to concede the basic point that citizens earn credit for their loyalty. Consequently, Jensen demonstrates how during World War I some women in different sectors of American society exhibited their devotion in the hope of gaining a greater voice in public affairs. She complements O'Leary and Neather by revealing that despite the rise of a masculine, business-centered patriotism and its ability to undermine the public view of women and minorities, the dream of equality did not vanish. In a few instances, voices of women completely opposed to the very concept of a warrior nation were heard. David Glassberg and J. Michael Moore make this point in their study of how one town in Massachusetts finally decided to commemorate World War I. In a similar manner, Lawrence Samuel and Robert Westbrook find American citizens expressing hope that their service to the nation and national institutions will be rewarded in the 1940s. Samuel's examination of how war bonds were sold to African Americans during World War II presents the case that racial minorities still clung to ideals ofjustice, reciprocity, and solidarity despite the reality of injustice and subordination. The wartime administration of Franklin Roosevelt, obviously sensitive to these desires, in return for support of the war effort determined to promise more rewards to not only blacks but all American citizens. Westbrook further acknowledges that popular patriotism during the war was strongly based both in private interests and the dream of reciprocity. Astutely investigating the reaction Americans had to Japanese political culture during World War II, Westbrook shows that Americans were attached to a sense of individualism and particularistic goals. They certainly found the culture and loyalty of the Japanese that called for unquestioned devotion to state authority and unlimited sacrifice unappealing. Thus, Westbrook's work effectively raises the issue of how a liberal society, committed to a vision of free and equal individuals, can nurture strong bonds of affection to other citizens and to the nation itself. He suggests that in the war with Japan the American state maintained loyalty only by extending the vision of Lincoln with promises to reward and protect the particular ties Americans had to families and local, ethnic, and\n\nTHE A T T R A C T I O N S\n\nOF P A T R I O T I S M\n\n15\n\nracial communities. But much of the collection suggests that this was a central theme of American patriotic meaning throughout the twentieth century. In the flush of postwar victory American patriotism became more tangled than ever. The last half of this century has witnessed a decided struggle over whether illiberalism with its devotion to individualism and abstract symbols of national strength will gain supremacy over explicit calls for justice and democracy through state action. In the aftermath of the \"Good War,\" it was difficult to deny the attractive symbols of a strong nation and the men who defended it. Thus, John Wayne was a patriotic box office hero by 1950. The reality of the Cold War further reinforced the power of illiberal patriotism and its need to venerate national strength. In this climate masculine versions of nationalism pervaded the culture at large. The fruits of victory were delivered more directly to the warriors in the form of jobs and educational supports. Women were generally expected to vacate their wartime occupations and return to serving men in the home. The quintessential patriotic symbol of the wartime experience, the Iwo Jima Memorial, conveyed the supremacy of masculine power and the authority of a triumphant and united nation. Thus, it comes as no surprise to learn that when Wendy Kozol investigated the manner in which Life magazine represented and discussed the nation in the 1950s it stressed the value of the nuclear family. Kozol notes that the wartime version of patriotism was now reconceptualized into images of female domesticity and consumerism, a formula that left the public life of the nation largely in the hands of men. Unlike World War II, the conflict in Vietnam did not result in promises that loyalty to the nation-state would be rewarded in victory. Government officials were busy attempting to defend their policies from many who came close to fitting John Schaar's description of citizens who no longer thought patriotic thoughts.15 The loudest proclamations of patriotism in the 1960s emanated from groups who associated it with the desire to win the conflict in Asia. Studies by George Lipsitz and Barbara Truesdell also prove that efforts to define loyalty in terms of masculine heroes and a strong nation continued even after the war was lost. Lipsitz's inquiry into the version of patriotism that dominated American discourse in the 1980s makes clear that masculine dreams and warrior heroes were not erased from public memory or political discourse during the 1960s. Lipsitz describes how the \"new patriotism\" of the 1980s differed from the old patriotism of the 1940s. In the recent era government leaders like Ronald Reagan rarely addressed aspects of our national identity like the four freedoms defined by Franklin Roosevelt. In place of 15\n\nSchaar, \"The Case for Patriotism.\"\n\n16 JOHN BODNAR\n\nwhat the state could do \"for the people,\" especially those dislocated by plant closings and corporate restructuring, patriotism in the 1980s offered spectacles of power and the veneration of elite groups of warriors. The \"new patriotism\" even attempted to revise the memory of Vietnam: the war was recalled not as a loss or a mistake but as a valiant effort to preserve the free world. Women who supported this masculine version of the nation and national loyalty are ably described by Barbara Truesdell who visited a national meeting of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She found these patriotic women celebrating not only male warriors but patriot missiles as well. As America entered the 1990s, however, the meaning of patriotism was unresolved. Public opinion polls suggested some ambiguity. A 1994 Gallup survey found that while 64 percent of Americans felt they were \"extremely\" or \"very\" patriotic, 35 percent described themselves as \"somewhat\" or \"not especially\" loyal. Visions of the nation grounded in unity, virtue, democracy, reciprocity, and group interest were all expressed with regularity. Commentators like Schlesinger and Bloom blamed multiculturalists and egoists for abandoning \"liberal creeds\" and moral traditions; these authors refused to confront the intricate history of American patriotism. In our times virile patriotism was strongly opposed by many defenders of state liberalism. In the eyes of Robin Wagner-Pacifici, the masculine and militarized renditions of national loyalty are actually under severe stress, perhaps more than the nation itself. President Bill Clinton, in his support for homosexuals and failure to accept the role of a warrior-patriot in his youth, evoked open hostility from the guardians of traditions of a strong nation. Wagner-Pacifici's study of encounters between the new president and the military revealed that the promotion of a feminized and more democratic vision of the nation was strong but not unopposed. In an examination of how a working-class community recalled the experience of loyalty in the past, my essay on an industrial town reveals a complex story that, despite its local base, approximates the mixed nature of patriotism on the national level. Informants exhibit both an attachment to the ideal of reciprocity as a basis for devotion, a fundamental ingredient in twentieth-century liberal thought, and a dream of national unity and solidarity. Despite particularistic communal attachments, much of their narrative about the past is told in the present out of a genuine concern that the nation remain a viable community of citizens with some concern for each other.16 This book does not cover all aspects of the history of American patriotism or the career that it has enjoyed over two centuries. But the volume 16\n\nThe Gallup poll was conducted 17-19 June 1994. I would like to thank Kim Elaine Neighbor of The Gallup Organization for sending me the results.\n\nTHE\n\nATTRACTIONS\n\nOF P A T R I O T I S M\n\n17\n\ndoes indicate that Americans drew upon certain fundamental ideals time and again when thinking about how they would pledge allegiance. Universal and parochial aspirations intermingled; elements of liberalism in both classic and modern forms were remarkably powerful. The concluding essay on Europe by William Cohen infers that the intermingling of traditions within the idea of a nation was not unique to the United States. But Cohen's essay also suggests that Europe may have been more consumed with a fear of foreign domination throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries than the United States. Thus, European nationalisms and patriotisms were more focused on national unity and power at the expense of a powerful tradition of liberalism. This collection suggests also that current debate over loyalties is not new. Past and present Americans took the idea of nationhood seriously and extensively debated its character. What else can explain all the arguments over the bonds of affection?\n\nChapter 1 TEACHING PATRIOTISM: PRIVATE VIRTUE FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD IN THE EARLY REPUBLIC CYNTHIA M. KOCH We have changed our forms of government, . . . but it remains yet to effect a revolution in our principles, opinions, and manners, so as to accommodate them to the forms of government we have adopted. {Benjamin Rush)1\n\nA\n\nTHE ARMIES withdrew in 1783, Americans began the task of self-definition—a revolutionary process that continues to this , day. As modern students of the Revolution have shown, from the beginning the United States was a nation of competing interests, variegated in its cultural composition. Those who held political power shared but perhaps a single commonality—the need to assure the survival through peacetime government for the ideology their military victories had at least momentarily secured. Somehow the high emotions of the revolutionary period had to be perpetuated into a constructive national sensibility. Political leaders turned to those they had constituted as the polis—largely propertyowning white males—and began to shape a national consciousness. Those new Americans, born as British colonists, needed to feel themselves Americans. In the face of continuing threats to national survival— externally from a British government that had hardly conceded defeat and internally from a populace that still carried cultural ties to mother England—a patriotic canon began to emerge in the first decades following the Revolution. Emotional attachment to a cause is at its highest as individuals in a society embark on cultural transformation, such as a revolutionary war, 1\n\nQuoted in Lawrence Cremin, American Education: The National Experience 1783—1876\n\n(New York: Harper & Row, Torchbooks, 1980), 1.\n\n20\n\nCYNTHIA M. KOCH\n\nand success depends on the routinization of such enthusiasm until ultimately the new culture is maintained through the preservation of doctrine and the performance of ritual.2 The political leaders of the American revolutionary generation faced this task as the war drew to a close and they turned from the high excitement of the rage militaire to the more sober task of nation building. Inheritors of the British distrust of the military and a traditional Protestant worldview, these men were also Enlightenment intellectuals who believed in the value of decentralized power and the use of reason to improve human affairs. Most important to this discussion of early patriotism, they also held a common faith in the value of education as a means of perpetuating the Revolution's goals. Jefferson wrote to Madison from Paris in 1787, \"Educate and inform the whole mass of the people. . . . They are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.\" Washington's Farewell Address stressed a fundamental relationship between education and good government: \"In proportion as the structure of government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened.\" Madison found a system of primary education a \"vital desideratum\" and endorsed the recommendations of Monroe, Hamilton, and Washington for the establishment of a national university. John Jay considered knowledge the \"soul of a Republic,\" and John Adams argued that the states' revenues could be put to better use providing public education than in \"maintaining the poor.\" In the language of the 1787 Northwest Ordinance, their commitment to education was first affirmed in law: \"Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\"3 Among these voices were those who expressed the opinion that not just education, but rather patriotic education, was the surest foundation for a lasting republic. These leaders intuitively grasped the importance of emotional attachment to one's country. Perhaps because there was no long history and few national traditions, perhaps because they perceived a continuing threat to national independence despite the absence of armed conflict, and perhaps because they were appealing to an unsophisticated male audience, the authors of this patriotic canon employed the story of America's war for independence to organize a logical and emotionally 2\n\nAnthony F.

Expressed with particular clarity in the popular schoolbooks of the era, its elements are recognizable today as icons of American patriotism. Such an education had to be established quickly because the success of the fledgling nation depended on the rapid dissemination of the values, attitudes, and ideology of a new culture. 4 It needed to be powerful, dramatic, and true. It needed to be mythic. Noah Webster was one of the most articulate spokesmen for patriotic education: Our constitutions of civil government are not yet firmly established; our national character is not yet formed; and it is an object of vast magnitude that systems of education should be adopted and pursued which may not only diffuse a knowledge of the sciences but may implant in the minds of the American youth the principles of virtue and liberty and inspire them with just and liberal ideas of government and with an inviolable attachment to their own country.5 Modern political theorist George Fletcher describes patriotism as an \"attitude of sentiment and devotion\" toward a state or nation into which we are born. Like learning a first language or religion, exposure to a political culture and learning a national history normally occur as part of a socialization process. It involves few independent choices and is integral to an individual's identity. Inherent in personal character, patriotism is an active emotional attachment born of early training and affinities. A similar definition of patriotism is advanced by Charles Taylor who emphasizes the concept of emotional attachment by describing patriotism as based on an \"identification with others in a particular common enterprise\" that involves binding commitments \"somewhere between friendship, or family feeling, on one side, and altruistic dedication on the other.\" Altruism requires a commitment to all people everywhere, while friendship or family attachments are highly specific. Patriotism entails ties to a broad group of people, most of whom are strangers but who share emotional allegiances based on a \"common political entity.\" He describes patriotic ties in a republic as particularly strong because people are bound together by their \"common history,\" much as in a family or friendship where shared experiences intensify the emotional bonds. 6 But in the early American republic precious few bonds of history were 4\n\nWallace, \"Revitalization Movements,\" 270, explicates this process and terms it \"mazeway reformulation.\" 5 Noah Webster, \"On the Education of Youth in America,\" in Essays on Education in the Early Republic, ed.

KOCH\n\nshared, and the new nation lacked all the traditional cultural affinities—a national literature, a common religion, or the authority of a monarchy. No child living in 1790 had developed patriotic attachment to the United States in the normal process of socialization: all such sentiments among the populace were the products of the extraordinary upheavals of war. Worse yet, in the usual expressions of culture based on language, literature, religion, and even political tradition, America's ties were strongest to England, the nation against which the United States most needed to assert its cultural independence. And many Americans and Britons continued to see this relationship in familial terms—the mother country and the newly independent offspring—and held varying opinions on the wisdom and long-term success of the United States of America as a nation. Just how did the leaders of the new republic go about the business of promoting patriotism in such a country? Most Americans are familiar with the political history of the federal years: how, after recognizing the inadequacies of the Articles of Confederation, the disparate interests of the former colonies were forged together under the new Constitution and Bill of Rights. We have learned about the founding of such basic institutions as the U.S. Mint and the postal service, the election of George Washington as first president, and the building of a \"Federal City.\" National symbols—the eagle and theflag—wereadopted, and the states reluctantly submitted to taxation to secure common economic goals and national defense; at the same time the new government struggled with questions of the degree to which political power is vested in the central government. But this familiar story does not tell us much about the cultural values that made this political history possible. What was the ideology behind the nation building of the federal years? How did some Americans set themselves to the task not just of forming a government, but of fostering emotional attachment to this new government?\n\nINVENTING AMERICAN PATRIOTISM\n\nAmerican Revolutionary leaders were not entirely without cultural traditions. With their republican counterparts in Europe, they shared a deep intellectual faith in the value of education in shaping the political sensibilities of a populace. Like the French Physiocrats of the 1790s, who demanded secular schooling supervised by the state including the basics of morality as well as reading, writing, and arithmetic, they saw education as essential to political reform. For the French it was to be a useful education in the rules of public morality, divorced from the church and suitable for the unlettered masses, not the higher learning that involved\n\nTEACHING PATRIOTISM\n\n23\n\nsophisticated social and political theory. These political reformers, according to social historian Harvey Graff, envisioned a nation of \"minimally educated, virtuous, and peaceful farmers and workers. That would be a major step toward the new society of a population capable of being well-governed. A properly educated people would understand and accept its place in life and society. \" 7 The development of republican education in America was not very different, and the inculcation of patriotism was at its core. Virtue was most important among the moral concepts the republican educators sought to instil, and it carried highly specialized meaning in this period. Drawn largely from Enlightenment philosophy, especially deism, virtue applied equally to public and private life by moderating individual morality as well as the integrity of nations. This conflation of individual and national character formed the basis for the popular identification of either Washington's morality with American national policy or the American struggle for independence with God's will. As a regulator, virtue was not unlike the system of checks and balances so carefully built into the frame of government. But unlike the Constitution, which was the product of human reason, virtue was the expression of divine will. Without virtue, as James Madison put it, even the the most elegantly crafted republican government was doomed to failure: \"No theoretical checks, no form of government can render us secure. To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in a people is a chemerical [sic] idea.\" 8 Just how social harmony was linked to virtue was explicated in a highly popular schoolbook lesson of the period. \"Virtue our Highest Interest,\" by the little-remembered essayist James Harris (1709-1780), appeared in four different texts—three of them compiled in England, but highly popular in the United States, and one by the American compiler James Staniford.9 The essay described humankind's common interdependence as the strongest argument for the practice of virtue: \"I find myself existing upon a little spot, surrounded every way by an immense, unknown expansion.—Where am I? What sort of place do I inhabit? Is it exactly accommodated in every instance to my convenience? . . . Is every thing subservient to me, as though I had ordered all myself? No— 7\n\nHarvey J. Graff, The Legacies of Literacy (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991), 179; see also 341 for similar educational philosophy in America. 8 Quoted from Barry Schwartz, George Washington: The Making of an American Symbol (New York: Free Press, 1987), 115. 9 The schoolbooks discussed in this essay were the subject of my dissertation, \"The Virtuous Curriculum: American Schoolbooks, 1785-1830\" (Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylvania, 1991). See 108-9 for sources on the following extracts from James Harris and Richard Price.\n\n24\n\nCYNTHIA M. KOCH\n\nnothing like it—the farthest from it possible.\" Harris, describing the ways in which each individual thrives on mutual support, equated humanity's \"social interest\" as akin to that of the \"bee, the beaver, and tribes of herding animals.\" But he described humanity's ties to one another as even greater and included the general intercourse of \"arts and letters\" and an interest in \"honor and justice . . . [and] the whole train of moral virtues . . . and all I owe to this great polity, and its great Governor, our common Parent.\" In Harris's popular formulation, virtue was moral action in human society that is controlled by the individual's effort to behave in accordance with—and glorify—divine intention. The English nonconformist minister and philosopher Richard Price (17231791), also excerpted frequently in the schoolbooks, described virtue not as the \"creature of [human] will,\" \"not local and temporary, but of equal extent and antiquity with the Divine mind.\" Virtue was in fact nothing short of \"everlasting truth . . . the guide of all power.\" Most important, Price described the social value of virtue as \"the foundation of honour and esteem, . . . the source of all beauty, order, and happiness.\" Without it a reasonable being suffers \"hideous deformities.\" Virtue alone is \"honour, glory, wealth and happiness. . . . Secure this, and you secure every thing. Lose this, and all is lost.\" Republican America was a place very much in transition. As Gordon Wood demonstrated in his recent history, it had strong roots in the monarchical and hierarchical world of the eighteenth century, but by the early nineteenth century, Americans proudly proclaimed themselves a nation of the \"middling sort,\" even as they ignored the plight of millions of enslaved African Americans.10 To our eyes America was a highly stratified society, and we see distinctly the differences in status between whites and nonwhites, free and enslaved, men and women. The majority of the population—slaves, women, Native Americans, and landless white men—were not only excluded from the political process, but they were also to a greater or lesser extent dependent on those who were more affluent, better educated, and situated because of their class, race, or sex in a more powerful social position. This dependency was a condition of life, and the smooth functioning of society was seen, not only by the ruling classes, as one of its proper results.11 White republican America grew from approximately four to close to thirteen million between 1790 and 1830, while African Americans, 90 percent of them slaves, numbered about three million by 1840. The white population was ethnically and economically homogeneous: almost 10\n\nGordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1992), discusses the monarchical and hierarchical state of colonial American society on 11-42 and the new middle-class consciousness on 347-49. 11 See Wood, Radicalism, 51, 56, 89-92.\n\nTEACHING PATRIOTISM\n\n25\n\ntwo-thirds was of English descent, and more than 90 percent resided in small towns and rural areas.12 People such as these saw themselves, and they in the eyes of their contemporaries were seen, as members of a virtually classless society by the early nineteenth century. Such a vision was revolutionary in a society where inherited class difference, buttressed by religious and civil ideology, had always inveighed against the leveling of society. A growing literacy was one measure of this transition. Wealthy men, and those engaged in business, had been literate since colonial times, but in the early republic, often in response to republican ideology, many more people began to be educated. By the late eighteenth century, American society could boast a white male literacy that was nearly universal in New England and approached two-thirds in other regions of the country. Beginning in the 1790s opportunities for women increased, a few more schools were opened (in the North) for African Americans and Indians, and education for white males extended to more Americans. By 1840 it seems that only the lowliest white men could not at least sign their names, although other groups continued to lag behind.13 This literacy was achieved through educational activities that took place in a patchwork of homes, private schools, common schools, libraries, and voluntary societies supported by local governments and charitable agencies. But this was traditionally a moral education and not directly related to the way most people earned their living. Reading and writing were unnecessary except for those whose daily occupations involved government, trade, or religion. Members of the elites read the newspapers, delivered the sermons, wrote the books, and taught in the schools. And as republican government admitted new members to the polis, it became increasingly important that moral education include large doses of patriotic training as well. Yet most people's contact with the written word continued to be through oral communication. Reading aloud, memorization, and recitation, in both schools and families, were important, essentially oral, activities. Printed sources were increasingly important, but as Harvey Graff has shown, America continued to be a \"semi-literate society.\" As they had since colonial times, printed sources were important because they validated social discourse conducted conversationally.

KOCH\n\nin the colonial period serve as an example. With their \"fine print, long reports from European courts, and polemics in a learned style\" they were hardly readable by a mass audience whose literacy, where it existed at all, was rudimentary. Instead, \"persons of rank were expected to receive the more important messages contained in the fine print through reading aloud and through conversations at courthouses, ordinaries, and other places of assembly as news became part of the common stock of knowledge, opinion and feeling.\" Even in the law, \"it was not in printed opinions of authors, but in ritual actions, in face-toface familiar meetings in the courthouse, that the reality of law unfolded in a formal setting modulated by routine and repetition.\" Much the same took place through popular schoolbooks, which were often advertised for use in homes and families as well as schools. Contemporary educational methods, in which a number of students shared a single textbook and which emphasized reading aloud, repetition, memorization, and recitation, meant that much of the texts' educational value was transmitted orally.14 Through such means people exchanged information, values, beliefs, and attitudes. A changing world such as Americans were experiencing made sense in terms of its resemblance to familiar things and familiar ideas—Bible stories, legends, parable, heroes, and demons. Stories, orally communicated, were the real transmitters of culture, but only shadows of these oral stories remain today. The patriotic story told through the popular schoolbooks is one way of hearing those stories. And the persistence of traditional ways of life—and a limited functional literacy in a newly enfranchised republic—helps us make sense of the limited worldview they projected. Because they were successful in their day, the most widely used schoolbooks are valuable today as expressions of popular patriotic sentiment. More editions were printed because more parents and educators found them to be reliable vehicles for inculcating cultural values. As compilations of textual material from a variety of printed sources, the stories they carried as lessons became, quite literally, the earliest elements in America's patriotic canon. In important ways they helped shape a mythology, a series of important stories conveying the political and moral values of a culture, that motivates patriotism to this day.15 14 Graff, Legacies, 252-55, 342; Charles Carpenter, History ofAmerican Schoolbooks (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1963), 15—17. 15 Koch, \"The Virtuous Curriculum,\" 28-29.

Knopf, 1991) applies myth theory to later periods of American history; his discussion of myth is set forth on 18-19.\n\nTEACHING PATRIOTISM\n\n27\n\nThe origins of American patriotism, unlike that of most nations, are not obscured in preliterary traditions. In fact, those who set about to craft this story told us exactly what they were doing. \"Americans, unshackle your minds and act like independent beings. . . . You have been children long enough, subject to the control and subservient to the interest of a haughty parent. You now have an interest of your own to augnient and defend: you have an empire to raise and support by your exertions and a national character to establish and extend by your wisdom and virtues.\"16 In the language of a religious zealot or conquering general, Noah Webster sounded the alarm in his first reader, published in 1785. He urged his countrymen to reject specifically European values associated with governments now viewed by Americans as not only the enemy but also as corrupted models for national well-being. A corollary to this thinking sought to diminish the amount of British cultural material contained in the textbooks used by American students. The stories we see in the schoolbooks were disseminated by a group of cultural leaders who were broadly engaged in education, they were expected to shape society and provide its leadership, particularly its moral leadership. They were clergymen, elected officials, medical doctors, teachers, and authors of books on diverse subjects. Only one of them was female. As so often stated in the prescriptive literature of the period, they were responsible for preparing the people of the new nation for selfgovernment. Of particular concern were the new white male voters of the new middle class. The schoolbook compilers shared the republican belief in the value of education to advance civic goals.17 The American press was already quite active during this period; more than 113 different titles of school readers were issued between 1785 and 1830. Like most American imprints, identical (or nearly identical) schoolbooks were issued in \"new\" editions by different printers in different parts of the country, sometimes over a period of twenty years or more. Many of these were originally British texts; their mere printing in this country made them (by some accounts) \"American\" editions. In all, some 882 editions of school readers were printed in the United States between 1785 and 1830.18 16\n\nQuoted in Cremin, American Education, 265. Schoolbook compilers were among the active opinion makers in early national America. See Koch, \"The Virtuous Curriculum,\" 59—75. On educational imperatives in the new nation, see Graff, Legacies, 341, which summarizes the substantial literature on this subject. 18 Among these, only eighteen titles, issued in 658 editions, were used in my study because they were the most popular of their type; they represented 57 percent of the textbooks used in schools and private education during the 1785-1830 period. These figures and a methodology for assessing popularity were developed in Koch, \"The Virtuous Curriculum.\" 17\n\n28\n\nCYNTHIA M. KOCH\n\nBut the concerns of American political and educational leaders become more understandable when we realize that half of the readers' titles, twothirds of the editions, and nearly three-quarters of the content of those readers were of British origin. Shakespeare, Blair, Pope, Milton, and Addison headed the list of the most popular sources for lesson material. The only American author used with any frequency at all was Benjamin Franklin.19 Continental European writers were used far less often, but English-language stories based in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the Middle East likewise provided some exposure to other cultures. All this contributed to the endurance of the old ways, the monarchical way of life deemed by republicans so antithetical to the new vision for the new nation.20 This reliance on European culture led to an insecurity in matters of arts and letters that was hotly debated in American schoolbooks and had broader implications for the development of strong attachments to the new nation. To be fully a nation, and by extension to be worthy of patriotic loyalty, patriotic educators knew that the United States needed focal points for national pride. In the schoolbooks they focused on accomplishments in learning and the arts. For example, in \"A Forensic Dispute, On the Question, Are the Anglo-Americans Endowed with a Capacity and Genius Equal to Europeans,\" the theory was advanced (somewhat defensively) that it was only a matter of time before Americans became intellectual leaders; as a \"natural cause\" conducive to advanced development, America's temperate climate, great rivers, and vast mountains produced an environment equal or even superior to that of Europe. Even more optimistically, one schoolbook argument dismissed the significance of natural causes that were conceded as promoting European advancement in the arts. Instead, America's \"state of society\" presaged a more important future in the democratization of learning. Just as \"republican government and habits . . . cherish equal rights and tend to an equal distribution of property,\" it has the \"same tendency to promote an equal distribution of knowledge and to make us emphatically a 'republic of letters'\" with a strong \"propensity to useful employments.\"21 This argument is but one of many that sought to link the necessity for an educated citizenry to republican patriotism. The emphasis on \"useful employments\" is important because Americans were proud that not only 19 There were twenty-one British authors more popular than Benjamin Franklin, w h o was the source for only seven lessons. The typical popular British author was far more frequently cited: Shakespeare 89 citations; Blair 40; Pope 35; Milton 31; The Spectator 29; T h o m s o n 27; Sterne 24; and Addison 24. 20 W o o d in Radicalism describes the prevalence o f this social structure in his opening chapter, \"Monarchy.\" 21 Caleb Bingham, The Columbian Orator (Philadelphia: Isaac Pierce, 1819), 2 9 6 - 9 9 .\n\nTEACHING\n\nPATRIOTISM\n\n29\n\nwere many citizens educated but that education was necessary in the defense of republican government: \"In a government where the people fill all the branches of the sovereignty, intelligence is the life of liberty. An American would resent his being denied the use of his musket; but he would deprive himself of a stronger safeguard, if he should want that learning which is necessary to a knowledge of his constitution.\"22 Fourth ofJuly orations, such as this one from Boston in 1787 reprinted in seven successive editions of Caleb Bingham's popular American Preceptor, early on linked the national interest and patriotic education. The widespread use of tracts such as this also perpetuated a \"siege mentality,\" which helped to lend the urgency of the Revolution to the task of republican education and the development of patriotic emotional ties. Sharing this ideology, popular American schoolbook compilers—along with their peers in politics and law, the press, pulpit, and classroom—entered the war for cultural independence. Lacking literary traditions and dedicated to \"useful learning,\" the compilers turned to American history and put it to pragmatic use. In so doing they altered a tradition of historical education long employed by their British counterparts where historical knowledge, along with a familiarity with literature, ancient languages, and the arts, was accepted as an important attribute of the educated man's intellectual and moral training. In an approach not much changed from the days of Shakespeare's great tragedies, the British valued history because \"it amuses the fancy as it improves the understanding, and as it strengthens virtue\" by illuminating generalized instances of human courage, heroism, and moral dilemma.23 The American educators, by contrast, besides employing Fourth ofJuly speeches and political oratory from the Revolution or Congress, also consistently adapted the history of the Roman Republic and ancient Greece or drew upon the history of Britain, Europe, and South America to amplify American patriotic themes.24 That the selection of American patriotic material for the schoolbooks was self-conscious political activity is amply evident in the frontmatter of a number of texts. Webster's 1789 American Selection of Lessons in Reading\n\nand Speaking set forth the most avowedly nationalistic agenda: \"In the choice of pieces [for the text], I have been attentive to the political interest 22\n\nCaleb Bingham, \"Extract from the Oration o f Thomas D a w e s , Esq. Delivered at Boston, July 4, 1787,\" The American Preceptor (Boston: Manning and Loring, 1805), 107. 23 Quoted from William Scott, Lessons in Elocution, \"Advantages o f History\" (Hume), 116. 24 Thirty-nine o f seventy lessons on British history recorded in the schoolbooks were found in American texts and illuminated issues relating to Anglo-American relations. Britons, by contrast, often employed British history only in character studies o f the m o n archs tempered by religious issues. Koch, \"The Virtuous Curriculum,\" chap. 4.\n\n30\n\nCYNTHIA M. KOCH\n\nof America. I consider it as a capital fault in all our schools, that the books generally used contain subjects wholly uninteresting to our youth; while the writings that marked the revolution, which are not inferior in any respect to the orations of Cicero and Demosthenes, . . . lie neglected and forgotten. \" 2 5 But if Webster was the most ardent, all American compilers were sensitive to the issue. Content analysis of schoolbook lessons shows that fully 97 percent of the American historical material was found in American-compiled texts; the remainder was found in so-called American editions of British texts. 26 Timothy Dwight's endorsement of Albert Picket's 1818 Juvenile Mentor repeated what had by then become a standard recommendation of American texts for American youth: \"The American people are zealous in the right education of their offspring; knowing that on it rests the perpetuity of the national independence, and the propagation of our blessed religion. Good schools, proper school books, and well qualified instructors, add much to a nation's blessings. . . . We are not much excelled by any nation on the globe, in the means of useful instruction. \" 27 In the preface to an American text that would achieve immediate popularity upon its publication in 1823, James Pierpont indicated something of the discord that persisted as American educators continued to press for popular acceptance of American texts: [This book] is the result of an attempt to supply the want . . . of a book of Exercises in Reading and Speaking better adapted, than any English compilation that has yet appeared, to the state of society in this country; and less obnoxious to complaint, on the ground of its national or political character, than it is reasonable to expect that any English compilation would be, among a people whose manners, opinions, literary institutions, and civil government, are so strictly republican as our own.28 Pierpont's American First Class Book was remarkable among the popular schoolbooks for its inclusion, as early as 1823, of some of the most contemporary American authors. His stated reason for using American materials looked toward a future where American literature was read for its own merits, rather than to satisfy the demands of American chauvinists. 29 Among the American authors he selected for his reader were those destined to become American classics—William Cullen Bryant, Ben25 N o a h Webster, An American Selection of Lessons in Reading and Speaking (Philadelphia: Y o u n g and McCulloch, 1789), preface. 26 Koch, \" T h e Virtuous C u r r i c u l u m , \" 133, table 4 . 1 . 27 Albert Picket, The Juvenile Mentor ( N e w York: Daniel D .

Moreover, reading textbooks, by long-standing tradition,31 were compilations; beyond Franklin and his circle, compilers seeking to develop an American cultural tradition had scant material on which to draw. American cultural independence required a novel approach, a break with the past in terms of content, if not form. American compilers, apparently unwilling to experiment with established pedagogy and depart from the reader-as-compilation format, instead set themselves to the task of creating a culture based on the story of that which was unique in America—the new republican political order. Chiefly using extracts from speeches and historical documents, but also writing much of their own material (itself a revolutionary departure from established practice), they seized upon the story of the founding of the United States as the motivating element in a great saga that advanced their twin goals of patriotic and moral education.\n\nDOMINANT STORIES IN THE N E W PATRIOTISM\n\nThe story of America's \"discovery,\" the hardships of the colonial period, the struggle for independence, and the political genesis of the new nation under the leadership of Washington as savior-patriarch became an epic told and retold with liturgical regularity. In its simplest form, the story took on a biblical symbolism, translating the newness of America into a familiar cultural language that carried the weight of history and spiritual authority. The result was the beginning of a uniquely American patriotic canon, which married political history to moral philosophy and religious symbolism. An examination of the elements in the mythic American story follows. 30\n\nB i n g h a m , \" A m e r i c a n Sages,\" Columbian Orator, 261.

KOCH\n\nThe Story of Columbus Americans in the new United States looked to Columbus as the prophet, even amidst the corruption and ignorance of the Old World, of their national independence. His voyages of discovery marked the beginning of the inevitable break with the Old World that culminated in the American Revolution. This vision is perhaps most plainly seen in a schoolbook lesson in which \"Columbus . . . saw, once more, bright Del'ware's silver stream/And Penn's throng'd city cast a cheerful gleam.\" The explorer is imagined as a heavenly figure sitting in benevolent judgment as Randolph, Washington, Franklin, Lee, and the whole founding panoply gather in sanctified political assembly leading a wronged people to reluctant Revolution: Nash, Rutledge, Jefferson, in council great, And Jay and Laurens op'd the rolls of fate. The Livingston's, fair freedom's gen'rous band, The Lees, the Houstons, fathers of the land. Adams, enrag'd, a broken charter bore, And lawless acts of ministerial pow'r; Some injur'd right in each loose leaf appears, A king in terrors and a land in tears.32 Ever virtuous, Americans are pictured as instruments of fate and reluctant warriors driven by British perfidy to a war of self-defense. Washington, most directly symbolic of the nation, \"on Britain still. . . cast a filial eye / But sovereign fortitude his visage bore, / To meet their legions on th' invaded shore.\" The history of Columbus in the New World was interpreted through a lens focused solely on the birth of the North American republic. While Columbus's voyages most directly opened the West Indies and South America to European colonization, people in the United States, with the benefit of considerable hindsight, saw as inexorable the \"progress of civilization\" leading directly from Columbus to Washington. Such sentiments found expression in popular verse such as \"Columbia, \" a paean to the United States in iambic pentameter that appeared in Bingham's American Preceptor. Here Columbus was feminized into the allegorical Columbia, representing the new land, the exotic wilderness of North America. She became the symbolic counterpart to George Washington, who was seen as imposing order and reason upon the land 32\n\nBingham, \"Description of the First American Congress from the Vision of Colum-\n\nbus,\" Columbian Orator, 133-35.\n\nTEACHING PATRIOTISM\n\n33\n\nthrough republican government. Both were memorialized in countless ways during the federal period, from naming the nation's capital to illustrating chapbooks. But in the schoolbooks, which relied on biography for much of their instruction, and elsewhere, the male Columbus also retained historical identity, albeit heavily overlaid with moral and patriotic interpretation. In this guise he often became an Old Testament patriarch struggling to achieve his mission against the forces of ignorance and reaction; Columbus as the new nation's Moses unfolded in tales of the struggles entailed in the voyages of discovery.33 They recount how over an eighteen-year period the explorer sought patronage for his first voyage; Columbus was portrayed as loyally applying first to his native Genoa and next to his adopted Portugal before seeking support from Ferdinand and Isabella. American compilers went to great lengths to recite various acts of chicanery to which Columbus was subjected in an obvious effort to dissociate him from a leadership role in the course of Spanish colonial development, which was uniformly criticized as corrupted by Old World vices.34 America's cultural founders clearly sought to claim Columbus for the (in their eyes) more virtuous cause of American nation building. Much of the injustice that Columbus suffered, according to lengthy discussion in the texts, derived from dishonorable opportunists whose venality only embellished Columbus's virtue: the king of Portugal secretly mounted an unsuccessful voyage of exploration based on Columbus's plan even as the explorer awaited word from him on his request for support. Later, following Columbus's third successful voyage, the schoolbooks tell us that Ferdinand and Isabella were incited to jealousy by Columbus's enemies. They removed him as viceroy of the colony that he founded and empowered the evil Francis de Bovadilla, under whose rule the natives were subjected to \"a most miserable servitude\" and who introduced \"disorder and licentiousness\" throughout the colony. Columbus was carried off in fetters to Spain. On the death of Queen Isabella, \"his last and greatest friend,\" Columbus appealed unsuccessfully to Ferdinand that the terms of his original contract be fulfilled and sought support for afifthvoyage, only to be rewarded with a final round of royal treachery: 33 Bingham, \"Account of C o l u m b u s , \" American Preceptor, 39—43; Webster, \"History of C o l u m b u s , \" American Selection, 70—80; Bingham, \"Description of the First American C o n gress from the Vision of C o l u m b u s , \" Columbian Orator, 133-35; Webster, \" C o l u m b u s to Ferdinand,\" American Selection. 34 T h e Spanish were portrayed in the schoolbooks as greedy and cruel aggressors against their South American colonists. Typically these lessons emphasized the virtues of national self-determination and soundly criticized Spanish imperialism. See Koch, \"Virtuous C u r riculum,\" 2 0 1 - 2 .\n\n34\n\nCYNTHIA M. KOCH\n\nFerdinand, cold, ungrateful, and timid, dared not to comply with a single proposal. . . . He therefore delayed and avoided any decision . . . in hopes that the declining health of Columbus would soon rid the court of the remonstrances of a man, whose extraordinary merit was, in their opinion, a sufficient occasion of destroying him. . . . Columbus languished a short time, and gladly resigned a life, which had been worn out in the most essential services perhaps that were ever rendered, by any human character, to an ungrateful world.35 The schoolbooks described a selfless hero subjected to unbearable obstacles and indignities in his single-minded pursuit of an inner vision. This portrayal placed Columbus with regard to the Spanish court in much the same position as the American colonies vis-a-vis the British: long-suffering and reluctant instruments of inevitable change directed by the \"unseen hand.\" Columbus was thus the one who triumphed over unenlightened opposition and succeeded in planting \"civilization,\" albeit corrupt, in the New World. Columbus's forbearance in the face of difficulty, his failure to secure personal fortune from his ventures, and his pitiful death all signify important elements of the schoolbook formula for the virtuous personality.\n\nThe American Wilderness As in any great epic, the passage of time in the schoolbooks' rendering of America's beginnings was more symbolic than chronological. The almost three centuries that passed between the Columbian voyages and the American Revolution were important to the patriotic story for their value as exposition of the American colonial experience. That experience was most often and most graphically conveyed to American students through lessons involving Native Americans. Stories involving Indians functioned in a number of ways: Native Americans were used as examples in lessons on Christian morality; their involvement in colonial warfare added dramatic impact to colonial history; and Indians were the object of social instruction that urged toleration of native culture. Significantly for our discussion of early patriotism, Indians also played an important symbolic role as the personification of the American landscape. At once threatening yet benevolent, honorable yet primitive, hospitable yet brutal, American Indians were portrayed in the schoolbooks with all the ambivalence that white Americans have historically reserved for their love-hate relationship with the land as both wil35\n\nQuoted here and above from Webster, \"History of Columbus,\" American Selection, 80, 79, 78, respectively.\n\nTEACHING PATRIOTISM\n\n35\n\nderness and paradise. From the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, the wilderness carried for Americans connotations of danger, hardship, and immorality—the latter because it was not bound by the socalled civilizing strictures of Christianity. For Europeans far removed from the reality of life in the New World, America as paradise was a well-tended garden, its wildness controlled by human cultivation. Beginning in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, wilderness took on a new appeal with the growth of deism, which found religious meaning in nature, and the Romantic movement, which celebrated mystery, solitude, and the untamed. In cities in Europe and America—far from the frontier—literary gentlemen thus found a new fascination with the wild even as their contemporaries on the frontier continued to fear and \"civilize\" it.36 Schoolbooks most frequently portrayed Indians as \"noble savages\" and used their interactions with white settlers as opportunities for moral education based on the Indians' close connection with the natural state. They were seen as embodiments of divine intention unencumbered by the weaknesses inherent in \"civilized\" people who were plagued by the wrong application of advanced human reason. Columbia herself was often portrayed as an Indian princess nobly garbed in Roman dress. A number of early nineteenth-century lessons touted Indians' cultural separateness as morally correct and their culture, in terms of fidelity to principle, as superior to that of whites. But all treatments of Indian culture were hardly so sympathetic. Some lessons described Indian massacres of white settlers, while others quoted William Pitt's plea to Parliament to resist the use of Indians (considered a \"malicious weapon\" in eighteenthcentury terms) against England's cultural kin, the American revolutionaries. Indians were at once a powerful example in the educators' storehouse of homilies teaching the universal value of the gentle virtues of hospitality, civility, and familial affection, and they were the object of a schoolbook campaign for tolerance that contradicted prevailing negative attitudes toward Native Americans.37 But these were not the lessons in 36\n\nRoderick N a s h in Wilderness and the American Mind ( N e w H a v e n : Yale U n i v e r s i t y Press, 1967) discusses h o w biblical and medieval notions of the wilderness as a fearsome u n k n o w n w e r e transplanted to America b y settlers living o n the frontiers; see esp. chaps. 2, 3. 37 T h e n u m b e r of duplicate lessons e m p l o y e d is a g o o d indicator of cultural u n a n i m i t y concerning the place of Indians within the d o m i n a n t culture. A remarkable 70 percent of the t w e n t y - f o u r A m e r i c a n Indian lessons w e r e duplicated in o n e or m o r e p o p u l a r texts. This contrasts sharply w i t h other American cultural material, which, excluding the Indian lessons, demonstrates only a 38-percent duplication rate overall. M o s t of these lessons used the \" n o b l e savage\" as a m o r a l example for Christian education.

KOCH\n\nwhich Indians played a role in patriotic education; here the message was more mixed, and tales of Indian \"massacres\" and wartime atrocities belied the positive image in a small but significant group of lessons, all of them in American-compiled texts.38 In some patriotic stories, extraordinary Indians were praised for helping Americans survive in the wilderness, or, better yet from the whites' perspective, they were portrayed as directly assisting white Americans' political interests. Although the story of the First Thanksgiving had not yet been popularized, the symbolic model it represents had begun to take shape in the promulgation of the Pocahontas story, which was already a staple, appearing in Bingham's American Preceptor and Picket's Juvenile Mentor.39 Another popular lesson celebrated Indians as American allies during the American Revolution: \"Brothers! . . . We are ready to do any thing for your relief, and shall be guided by your counsel. Brothers! . . . if you send me to the fight, . . . let me fight in my own Indian way. . . . Only point out to me where your enemies keep, and that is all I want to know.\"40 This lesson, which records a speech of the chief of the \"Stockbridge Tribe,\" was identified as delivered to the General Court of Massachusetts in 1775. While in actuality Indians most frequently allied themselves with the British during the Revolution, the schoolbooks' educational purpose of advancing peaceful coexistence was better served by popularizing this extraordinary instance of allegiance to the American cause.41 William Penn's treaty with the Indians is perhaps the most enduring of the popular stories involving Indians in the colonial period, and it too reveals the ambiguous relationship as perceived by Anglo-Americans: \"Wm. Penn, who was distinguished as a good as well as a great man, took care to acquire the best of titles to his lands, by legal purchases from the natives, the sole proprietors of the soil. He introduced into his settlement a most liberal plan of civil and religious policy—he tolerated all religious sects, and thus invited not only his own sect, the friends, to remove from England, but also vast numbers of all denominations from 38 Descriptions o f Indian hostilities t o w a r d whites w e r e limited t o six lessons o u t o f t h i r t y - t w o (20 percent) o n relations b e t w e e n the races; see Koch, \" V i r t u o u s C u r r i c u l u m , \" 150, 152—54.

In his insistence on Europeans' rights to express dissent through a life-style and legal system founded in differing belief systems, Penn was seen as a precursor to the American revolutionaries whose Enlightenment credo was similarly ideological. Obviously, neither Penn's nor the revolutionaries' worldview could give full legitimacy to the culture of the Native Americans; nevertheless, in celebrating the Penn Treaty story, white Americans found their strongest model for an amiable relationship with Native Americans. This relationship, wholly founded in English religious and legal systems, was idealized in the schoolbooks for its tolerance of racial and cultural difference. Americans were proud of themselves in the treaty story because the rights of Englishmen were extended to people whom the prevailing attitudes perceived as subhuman. The story illustrated the most liberal worldview possible in early national America—tolerance rather than annihilation. Pierpont, for example, dwelt at length on Penn's Treaty; he betrayed its egalitarian spirit in the course of a lesson extracted from the Edinburgh Review that described Native Americans in pejorative and potentially threatening terms: in contrast to the \"moderate attendance of friends,\" an \"innumerable multitude of the Indians assembled in that neighborhood . . . with their dark visages and . . . arms, moving, in vast swarms, in the depth of the woods which then overshaded the whole of that now different region.\" The lesson reported Penn's words in detail, as well as the conditions of the agreement.
