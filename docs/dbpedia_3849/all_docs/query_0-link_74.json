KXZKZ^^^^ Preface So many books have been written about San Francisco and its neigh- bor cities around San Francisco Bay that the writing of still another may seem to call for explanation. But for all those who have shared in the compilation and editing of this book — research workers, reporters, writers, editors, and supervisors of the Northern California Writers' Project in San Francisco and Oakland — it needs no apology. All throughout the long labor of preparing it they have realized only too keenly how much remains to be written about a city whose history has been the stuff of legend since its beginning — how much remained before it was written and still remains afterward. For this book, although we have crowded between its covers uncounted thousands of those facts which go to make up the story of a great metropolitan center — names and dates, descriptions of places and people, tales and anecdotes and even some myths — still leaves much of the story untold, as any book must. But the book will have accomplished its purpose if what it leaves unsaid the reader will want to know. During the preparation of this volume, Margaret Wilkins acted as State Editorial Supervisor, Paul Johnson as State Research Supervisor, and Willis Foster as Oakland District Supervisor. Wallace Boyle, Charles Coppock, S. S. Greenleaf, and Dorothy Wagner served as edi- tors; Juanita Turner and Gordon Williams as research editors. Al- though virtually the entire San Francisco, Oakland, and San Rafael staffs shared in the compilation of the book, the writing of the final manuscript was done largely by Jackson Barber, Dean Beshlich, Marc Bliss, Madeline Gleason, Gladys Pittman, Thomas Ray, Kenneth Rex- roth, and Dorothy Van Ghent of the San Francisco staff and Porter Chaffee, Henry Darnell, Frances Garoutte, Howard Hoffman, Ethel Manning, and Thomas Patterson of the Oakland staff. Much of the section \"North of the Bay\" is the work of Cora Vernon Lee, Sacra- mento District Supervisor. We are indebted for the essay \"Before the Footlights\" to Lawrence Estavan, Supervisor of the History of the San Francisco Theater Project. The index was compiled by Max Loewen- thal and the bibliography by W. Stanley. The maps were prepared by VI PREFACE George Hill and J. H. Marion and some of the photographs by Theo- dore Baron, James Hall, and Howard Hoffman of the project staff.

Seven decades would pass before the heirs of '76 would raise their flag on this site. Two years more, and the name of San Francisco would go round the world. It \"never was a village\" — this had been its proud boast. Where barren sand dunes, marshes, and brackish lagoons had surrounded an abandoned mission and a decaying fort with rusty cannon, San Francisco sprang into life overnight — a lusty, brawling he-man town of tents and deserted ships. Business, mushroomlike, flourished in mud-deep streets. Almost before it had achieved a corporate identity, San Francisco was a metropolis— to be named in the same breath with Boston or Buenos Aires, Stockholm or Shanghai. When the other cities of the Coast were still hamlets in forest clear- ings or desert cow-towns, San Francisco was \"The City.\" It is \"The City\" still. Massed on the tip of its Peninsula, its skyscrapers tower skyward from the peaks of the highest hills: great shafts of concrete banked in swirling billows of white mist when the fogs move in from the sea — glittering with pinpoints of reflected light from their countless windows when the sun shines from a clear blue sky. Crowding on each other, the hills rear their endless terraces of buildings, descending to the water's edge like steps, cleft by streets that strike up the steepest slopes and plunge down the deepest valleys with reckless fidelity to their straight and narrow paths. Around the curving Peninsula's tip jut widespread fingers that are piers harboring their great ships. Soaring to heights greater than the hilltop skyscrapers, the girders of the bridge towers lift their slim steel spans high above the smokestacks of passing ships. Over their suspended roadbeds traffic streams across the racing tides of the Golden Gate to the bluffs and thicket-choked gullies of the Marin shore and across the Bay's wide sweep of gray-green water to the mainland. There, on the 3 4 SAN FRANCISCO eastern shores of the Bay, rising like the tiers of a vast amphitheater to wooded crests, spread mile after mile of buildings — homes and schools, business blocks and factories. And on every side the age-old hills — vivid with the green of fresh-growing grass after winter rains, sere and brown in summer — encircle the blue water : wilderness neighbor to the city. THE OPENING OF THE GATE If some titanic convulsion of the earth were to drain San Francisco Bay of all its waters, it would look merely like one of those shallow, hill-rimmed valleys which stretch away from its upper and lower reaches. Through a gap in the chain of hills along its eastern edge, a great river would pour into its upper end and, winding southward, flood out to sea through a deep gorge hollowed in the coastal range. Within the recent geologic past the Bay was just such a valley, the Golden Gate such a river canyon. But as time went on, the valley sank until ocean waters came flooding through the Gate to submerge all but the peaks of its hills. Last of all in the long series of the earth's transformations from which emerged that part of the planet known as California was the Bay's creation. But the geologic upheavals destined to open the Golden Gate had begun long before. West of today's Pacific shore, perhaps 500 million years ago, rose a land mass extending into what is now the Pacific Ocean. Where the Sierra Nevada now rises is thought to have been a low land mass, lapped on the Nevada side by an inland sea. As the eons passed, this great basin sea advanced westward into California, retreated and ad- vanced again, until by 200 million years ago it may have reached as far as the site of Monterey — well over toward that westward-lying coast along the ocean. Eventually the ocean itself found its way into the watery area that later was to become California. The western land mass probably was cut off from the mainland, forming an elongated island of which the present Farallon Islands were a part. Eastward lay a submerged trough, and into this trough sediment was continually draining from the island's slopes. To the incredible depth of over three miles the sediment was laid down in the water, slowly solidifying. From this trough was later elevated the San Francisco Peninsula, its foundations partly composed of the thick deposits which drained from the westward island. And then began that long series of geologic events which finally re- sulted in the emergence of the coastline of California. Between 120 and 150 million years ago the ridges of both the Coast Range and the Sierra Nevada were pushed up. Unlike the Sierra Nevada, which was to maintain its general structure despite erosion, the Coast Range rose from the inland sea -only to sink again. At least three times the ocean en- THE BAY AND THE LAND 5 gulfed the region between the Sierra Nevada and the westward island and advanced to the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. At a point about 36 million years ago, the picture of California begins to emerge in clearer detail. On the eastern border is the wall of the Sierra, following about the same direction as in the twentieth cen- tury, but lower, less rugged, its slopes covered with luxuriant vegetation. Still under water, the center of the State is a great inland sound, extend- ing far enough westward to submerge the site of San Francisco. A long island stretches northwest from the present vicinity of Salinas. Islands are scattered in the sound. For many million years the geography of this California changed little; but great activity was brewing in the earth. Far offshore the bottom of the sea was sinking. As it sank, the land along the coast was thrust upwards, buckling under the pressure. All of California was rising, but the extra thrust upon its western edge caused a slip along which occurred a sidewise movement of at least 700 feet and possibly as much as 20 miles. Along this same fault, extending from Point Arena south to the Mojave Desert, there was to be a shift of about eight feet in the year A.D. 1906, which would cause a great disturbance in the city of San Francisco. (Because the rock mass is broken along the fault, any abnormal strain within the earth is apt to be taken up there; such movements occur frequently, but rarely displace the surface more than two-tenths of an inch.) The same thrusts that were to cause the San Francisco Peninsula's earthquake fault also helped to lift it above the sea. There was pronounced folding of the Coast Range at this time, not only on the Peninsula, but along the line of the Berkeley Hills. About one million years ago the Great Valley was becoming filled with sediment. Brackish water still covered part of the valley; it drained, not through the Golden Gate, which did not yet exist, but through various other outlets; one at the Russian River and another at Monterey Bay. The San Francisco-Marin area probably was separated from the mainland by marshes, so shallow that they could be crossed by the primitive elephant (whose fossils have been found near Menlo Park). The last great uplift raised the Sierra Nevada Range to a height of 4,000 feet above its present elevation ; the Coast Range shared in this uplift. Most recent of California's important geological events have been those which formed San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate. As the marshes along the coast and farther inland dried, continued folding in the Coast Range blocked off the drainage of the Great Valley through the Russian River and Monterey Bay, forcing the rivers to find another outlet. They converged in a new course through a canyon north of the Berkeley Hills at what is now Carquinez Strait, thence down through a 6 SAN FRANCISCO valley, and finally through the mountains that extended up the San Francisco Peninsula and northward into Marin County. However solid the earth may have seemed beneath the feet of the first human inhabitants when they came (probably between 30 and 40 centuries ago) to hunt game and pick wild fruit in the coastal valley behind the river's mouth, it was sinking imperceptibly. The sea cliffs to the west were tilting upward on their outer side; but every year the floor of the coastal valley was a little lower. As fast as the sea cliffs rose, the river scoured deeper its channel through them, thus gradually carving down the sides of the Golden Gate. Then finally came a time when the floor of the coastal valley sank beneath sea level. The ocean flooded through the mouth of the river over 400 square miles of the Indians' hunting ground. The land would go on sinking until the very shell mounds which the first settlers left behind them on dry land were lapped by the tides; and yet as it sank, the rivers would lay down their rich silt, torn from mountain sides and lowlands of the Central Valley basin, over the bottom of the Bay. So was made, for how long no one can tell, the harbor known today as San Francisco Bay. EARTH AND WATER Midway in the great chain of mountain ridges that stretches along the continent's edge down the southeast-tending California coast is a narrow gap. Between its steep headlands the long Pacific rollers, break- ing in spray against the cliffs to north and south, pour in swift tides. As the headlands recede on either side, an expanse of water opens out, stretching eastward to low, gently sloping hills. To the north, wooded peaks rise steeply above bluffs close at hand; to the northeast, barren capes guard a distant strait. Southward a sheet of water extends farther than a man can see, between marsh-edged flat lands. Here, where ocean tides roll in over a valley long sunk below sea level, salt water mingles with fresh, is muddied with the yellow silt of rivers, pouring into the Bay's upper reaches. At either end, sloping valleys walled like the Bay between ranges of hills that parallel each other, east and west, spill their creeks into it. Among the encircling hills, sloughs and canyons twist to the water's edge. So well hidden from the sea beyond its narrow gateway by moun- tainous coastal walls that exploring navigators passed it by for more than two centuries, San Francisco Bay is one of the world's largest landlocked harbors. Measured along a straight line from the mouth of Sonoma Creek in the north to the mouth of Coyote Creek in the south, it is approximately 60 miles long and measures 14 miles at its greatest width. Its outlet to the sea, the Golden Gate, is three miles long and, at its widest point, a mile wide. In all, the Bay covers an area of a THE BAY AND THE LAND 7 little more than 400 square miles. Although more, than 70 per cent of its area is less than 18 feet deep, it reaches a depth of from 100 to 140 feet in its central part and of 357 feet in the main channel of the Golden Gate. North of its narrowest point, the strait between Points San Pedro and San Pablo — where it is known as San Pablo Bay — the water is shallower. Into San Pablo Bay empties the drainage of the valleys to the north and the hinterland to the east. Petaluma, Sonoma, and Napa Creeks pour in from the north. Through narrow Carquinez Strait, six miles long, joining San Pablo Bay with shallow Suisun Bay to the east, pour the combined waters of California's two great rivers, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin, which drain the Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada's western slopes. The gorge cut by the silt-laden river waters, winding out to sea through the succession of bays and straits, can be traced by the yellow stream that crosses the Bay's blue ripples. The river's ancient delta, built up through the ages before the ocean broke through the Golden Gate, has been traced as far out to sea as the Farallon Islands, 23 miles off Point Bonita. The peaks of low hills once rising from the drowned valley's floor are islands now. Opposite the Golden Gate, rocky Alcatraz (130 alt.) rises abruptly from the swift tides. Northward, divided by narrow straits from the coves and inlets of the Marin shore, rise green-clad Angel (782 alt.) and Belvedere (350 alt.). A little to the southeast the rugged hump of Yerba Buena (343 alt.) appears almost midway across the Bay. From opposite sides of the Golden Gate the sheer bluffs at land's end of the San Francisco and Marin Peninsulas face each other. The narrow hilly strip of the San Francisco Peninsula stretches 30 miles southward from the Golden Gate between Bay and ocean, tapering in width from 7 miles at its tip to approximately 21 where it merges with the mainland. On the Bay side it is bordered with mud flats and salt marshes; on the ocean, with rugged cliffs and sandy beaches. The tip of the Peninsula, walled off from the south by the steep narrow ridge of San Bruno Mountain (1,315 alt.), is a rough square with jagged out- lines, scored haphazardly by rocky hills and winding valleys, once a rolling waste of sand dunes and marsh-girt lagoons. In the center of this area rises a dominant crescent-shaped range, culminating in Twin Peaks (904 alt.), Mount Davidson (916 alt.), and Mount Sutro (909 alt.). Southward spreads a zone of billowing hills, merging into San Bruno Mountain. Beyond troughlike Merced Valley, cutting from Bay to ocean parallel with San Bruno Mountain, the Peninsula is scored with parallel ridges running north and south — among them, Buriburi Ridge (700 alt.), the Sawyer Ridge (about 1,200 alt.), and Montara Mountain (1,952 alt.). Between the Buriburi and Sawyer 8 SAN FRANCISCO Ridges lies a 1 5-mile- long segment of the San Andreas Rift Valley, following the course of the San Andreas earthquake fault. Farther south the Santa Cruz Mountains, of which these Peninsula ridges are the northern offshoots, lift their wooded slopes to greater heights. Some 80 miles from the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula they taper off into low hills where Monterey Bay cuts its crescent line into the coast. The Golden Gate is but a narrow break in the great mountain chain of the Coast Range, which continues northwest up the Marin Peninsula under the name of the Bolinas Ridge. An irregularly shaped, deeply and intricately dissected mountain mass, the Marin Peninsula is criss- crossed by ridges radiating from its highest point, at the southern end of the Bolinas Ridge — Mount Tamalpais (2,604 alt.). The deep canyons that scar the flanks of the ridges widen into gently sloping valleys merging with salt marshes on the Bay side; on the ocean side they twist tortuously to the sea, where the hillsides end abruptly in sheer cliffs. Paralleling the Bolinas Ridge on the west is the long narrow valley which follows the course of the San Andreas fault. Its northern reaches are filled with the waters of marsh-bordered Tomales Bay, extending southeastward like a thin finger, laid along a line as straight as if it had been sheared off with a knife. To the west, hilly, triangular Point Reyes Peninsula juts into the ocean like a plowshare, sheltering behind its long promontory curving Drake's Bay with its white-faced cliffs like the chalk cliffs at Dover. East of the Marin Peninsula's hilly mass the flat reaches of Sonoma and Napa Valleys merge into tule marshes at the Bay's edge, divided from each other by the gentle slopes of the mountains. Along the Bay's eastern shore, beyond the narrow coastal plain, stretches the serrated skyline of the Berkeley Hills, culminating in Bald Peak (1,930 alt.) ; and behind, across a line of narrow, shallow valleys, rise the rugged crests of a parallel ridge culminating in Rocky Ridge (2,000 alt.). To the east, broad flat Ygnacio Valley extends north to the shores of Suisun Bay and south into the narrow, level San Ramon Valley. From the valley's edge steep slopes rise in long sweeping lines to the summit of Mount Diablo (3,849 alt.). To the south, San Ramon Valley meets narrow, 4O-mile-long Livermore Valley. Beyond, the ridges of the Mount Diablo Range extend to meet the Mount Ham- ilton Range, paralleling the Peninsula ridges and the Santa Cruz Moun- tains across the Bay. South of the Bay's southern tip, the fertile plains of the Santa Clara Valley extend for 70 miles between the walls of the Mount Hamilton (4,029 alt.) Range and the Santa Cruz Mountains, 15 miles apart — a long, narrow extension of that same valley whose upper reaches, now submerged, are, the Bay itself. From the marshes of the Bay's southern THE BAY AND THE LAND 9 end, the valley floor slopes upward gradually toward the south, where offshoots of the two mountain ranges curve inward and enclose it. THE CLIMATE The Bay of San Francisco and its shores share with the rest of the Coast the moderate climate which it owes chiefly to the prevailing winds off the Pacific. Because of the break in the coast line the region has a climate even milder than enjoyed elsewhere along the Coast, because it receives more than its share of ocean-cooled air currents, sucked in by forced draft through the Golden Gate. Their deflection in various directions by the hills gives contingent sections widely differing weather. At the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula, the mean annual tem- perature is 56.4° F. ; the mean temperature of the coldest month, January, is 50° F. and of the warmest month, September, 61.5° F. But just northward across the Gate, mean temperatures are approximately five degrees lower in winter and five degrees higher in summer. Cold months are likewise colder and warm ones warmer on the eastern side of the Bay and down the Peninsula. The average annual rainfall at Kentfield in Marin County, less than 15 miles north of the Gate, is more than twice that of San Francisco — 45.33 inches as against 21.85 inches. South of the city, rainfall decreases progressively, reaching an average of 15 inches at San Jose. Although the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula enjoys sunshine for an average of 66 per cent of all the daylight hours in the year, it has acquired a more celebrated reputation for its fogs. They are of two principal varieties. Tule fog, a winter phenomenon, consists of low- hanging clouds of condensed vapor which drift about the Bay in serpen- tine fashion, sometimes blanketing completely one section of city or Bay while another is bright with sunlight. Most prevalent is the white fog which forms off the headlands on either side of the Golden Gate and drifts inland as the temperature rises inland in the warm valley section of the State. This fog forms in huge blankets, averaging about 1,700 feet thick, sometimes shrouding the entire tip of the Peninsula and spreading across the Bay to its eastern shore. The Bay region, like most of the California coast, knows two seasons — the wet and the dry — and throughout much of the area the difference in average temperatures between them is seldom more than ten degrees. Even this slight difference is usually nullified by cooling breezes off the ocean which take the sting out of summer heat. At the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula early autumn is actually warmer than summer — for summer is the season of fogs. Only the rains, which come between October and May, call more than momentary attention to the change in seasons. IO SAN FRANCISCO The temperature, rainfall, and even the winds follow predictable cycles, permitting residents to fall into a pattern of adaptations, less pronounced than those required by four seasons, but quite as regular. The weather's summer schedule is particularly dependable. A San Franciscan knows, almost to a certainty, that he will waken on a July morning in a world of light, bright fog and little wind. By noon the sun will be shining, and still will shine at midafternoon, though pres- ently it will be hidden by the billows of white vapor that tumble over the hills and through the Gate. Within an hour a stiff salt breeze will be driving this fog, like a band of frantic wraiths, through hills and valleys; but the wind will be dying and the fog dispersing by half past seven. With the lengthening of night will come a softness, lightness, and clarity in the air which makes sleep seem a dullard's habit. WILD LIFE Simple and clear was the pattern of vegetation around San Fran- cisco Bay before the coming of the white man. Along the coast, in the region of greatest winter rain and heaviest summer fog, were the red- wood forests, extending almost without interruption from southern Oregon to San Francisco Bay and continuing south in canyons and other fog traps to the coast below Carmel. The grass and oak savannah extended eastward to the Sacramento Valley and along the floors of the principal inter-mountain valleys of the Coast Range. A thicket of low- growing chaparral clothed the interior ranges and the dry southern slopes. Fringing the Bay were marshes choked with tule rushes. Conspicuous changes have taken place in the outlines of the three major types of vegetation. Much of the forest has been replaced by grass, brush, or crops; the early grassland area is occupied by cultivated land. However, the region is fortunate to possess many game preserves, water districts, and other sections where natural conditions still prevail and many more that are being restored. The residents are making a start toward restriction of destructive lumbering, bad range manage- ment, poor fire control, and unregulated killing of game and fish. Typical virgin areas of forest are preserved in Muir Woods Na- tional Monument and Santa Cruz Redwood Park. Here are trees, many from 1,000 to 2,ooo years old, rising 300 feet or more with diameters of 12 to 1 6 feet. Their clean, gently tapering shafts, clothed with thick, purplish, massively fluted bark, rise uninterrupted by branches for approximately a third of their height. The foliage is deli- cate and feathery, but dense enough to keep perpetual twilight on the forest floor. Scattered among the great columns are smaller trees: broad-leaf maple, madrone, golden chinquapin, and California laurel. In separate stajids, usually along the ridges at the inner margin of the THE BAY AND THE LAND II fog belt, is found the somber, massive Douglas fir. Forming close thickets are huckleberries, azaleas, rhododendrons, California buckthorn (the dried bark of which is medicinal cascara sagrada), salal, wild cur- rants and gooseberries, salmon- and thimble-berries, and elder. And in the damper shade, watered by the fog which the trees precipitate, Woodwardia and sword ferns give cover to mosses, dogtooth violets, true violets, wild ginger, redwood sorrel, trillium, fritillaria, clintonia, and the pungent yerba buena which gave San Francisco its first Spanish name. The redwood forest and its associated meadows and streams are particularly rich in animal life; raccoons, skunks, wild cats, woodrats, and weasels are fairly common. As is natural in so deep a forest, birds are not conspicuous. Those most often seen are the varied and hermit thrushes, quail, flycatchers, California tanagers, robins, various sparrows and warblers. The chaparral formation in California is remarkable, both for its high degree of development and for its numerous methods of adjustment to the long dry summers, wet winters, periodic fires, and intense sun- shine. Its root systems are often extensive; its leaves protect themselves from excessive evaporation by turning their broad surfaces away from the sun, by growing in small, needle-like shapes, and by resorting to other devices such as thick skins, coatings of fuzz, exudations of resin, and restriction in the number of \"pores.\" Many typical shrubs have the ability to sprout after fires from the root's crown. Others seed profusely and grow vigorously in burnt-over soil. The most wide- spread members of the chaparral are the various species of ceanothus, used by the Indians for soap; manzanita, with white bell-like blossoms, red or chocolate bark, neat oval leaves; California buckeye, which blooms in heavy clusters and bears fig-shaped fruits; chamise (aden- ostoma) ; chaparral pea; many dwarf oaks; and yerba santa, with pale lavender flowers and leaves spotted with resin. The chaparral was the home of the extinct California grizzly and the now rarely seen California condor. Typical of both chaparral and grasslands are the brush rabbit, coyote, gray fox, various rats and mice, pocket gophers, and moles. Some of the more distinctive birds are the California jay, stellar jay, California thrasher, Anna hummingbird, house finch, mourning dove, and valley quail. Hawks, owls, and buzzards are very common. Formerly the savannah was covered with a thick sod of perennial grasses; today it is dominated by the aggressive annual wild oat, a Spanish importation. However, the spring still brings a flourishing abundance of California poppies, lupines, nemophilas, cream cups, brodiaea, owl's clover, Indian paintbrushes, irises, shooting stars, and many composites. I2SANFRANCISCO One of the region's most interesting natural environments is the marshy border of the sloughs and estuaries where willows and cotton- woods grow. Wading birds are numerous; also the great blue heron, night heron, bittern, egret, and snowy egret. The estuaries, filled with tule rushes, are favorite nesting places for pelicans, coots and ducks, wrens, red-winged blackbirds, and many warblers. Along the seacoast too, there is a distinct community of wild life. Gulls, terns, cormorants, and brown and white pelicans congregate in numbers. Hair seals and sea lions are still abundant, though the fur seal has disappeared. Offshore, all along the Pacific Coast of North America, grow great beds of brown kelp, plants which in some cases are as large as redwood trees. This dense marine thicket provides shelter for a host of small fish, many of them valuable for food. Perch and rock and torn cod are typical species. Other ocean fishes found fresh in San Francisco mar- kets are sea bass, various flatfish, halibut, and salmon. Crab, abalone, clams, shrimp, and oysters (both native and planted) are the principal shellfish. Bay and river fishes include shad, steelhead, striped bass, and several species of native and imported trout. In 1940 the San Francisco Bay communities are as close as any urban area in the United States to primitive landscapes. At distances but little farther than city limits are forests, thickets of chaparral, and tule marshes, so wild that any explorer but the more experienced woodsman might easily imagine himself the region's first inhabitant. A Frontier to Conquer \"The hills were wardens of the far-sought gold And streams were glad in valleys unprofaned . . .\" — GEORGE STERLING, The Homing of Drake FROM the chalk-white bluffs of the bay sheltered by Point Reyes, the coast-dwelling natives saw with amazement an immense ob- ject borne on billowing wings loom out of the mist at sea on June 17 (Julian Calendar), 1579. The man whom they sent the next day to reconnoiter paddled back excitedly to tell of living beings, white of skin and bearded, aboard this apparition. Concluding that these visitors were no less than spirits returned from the dead, the Indians timorously kept their distance, prepared to make — if necessary — proper obeisance. For three days longer the spirits remained in their abode, which rested on the water, its wings folded. On the third day it moved in toward the shore, and the spirits landed. So came the first white men to set foot in the region of San Fran- cisco Bay — men of Francis Drake's company in the Golden Hinde. They had left England a year and a half earlier in company with four other ships, bound round the world in the service of Queen Elizabeth to plunder the ships and cities of her enemy, Philip II of Spain. Now only the flagship remained. After two days ashore, they were visited by the awed inhabitants of the country, who brought gifts of feathers and tobacco. \"This country our Generall named Albion\" the chaplain wrote, both because \"of the white bancks and cliffes\" and in order that \"it might haue some affinity, euen in name also, with our own country . . .\" And before Drake's five weeks' stay had ended, he recorded further, \"our Generall caused to be set vp a monument of our being there, as also of her maiesties and successors right and title to that kingdom ; namely, a plate of brasse, fast nailed to a great and firme post; whereon is engrauen her graces name, and the day and yeare of our arriuall there, and of the free giuing vp of the prouince and kingdom, both by the king and people, into her maiesties hands . . .\" Thus having established his Queen's title to a new kingdom on the other side of the world, Francis Drake lifted anchor on July 23 and sailed away. The Indians were grief-stricken. As night fell, they lighted beacon fires on the hills. 13 14 SAN FRANCISCO NATIVES OF THE COUNTRY In the Indians' geography the only land that lay beyond the smooth disc of the Pacific Ocean was the island where dwelled their dead. The Bay itself was to them no \"harbor,\" for their small tule rafts never carried cargoes out the Golden Gate. Even the pass through the Coast Range at Carquinez Strait, to which stagecoach and railroad, as surely as the rivers, finally were to gravitate, had no great importance to a fleet brown foot that daily climbed the mountain barrier for rabbits. In all those ways that the contours of the region were to influence the welfare of white inhabitants, the Indians were affected little. But for other reasons the Bay environment impressed its pattern upon them. It was the Bay that set the sleepy rhythm of the Indians' days. It determined, first, the location of their villages. A few groups lived on the ocean front and a few more on the banks of streams among the wooded hills, but most of them settled at the mouths of estuaries, on the Bay beaches. There the struggle for existence almost was reduced to reaching out a hand for supplies that the waters laid upon their door- steps : for mussels, soft-shell clams, and seaweed, and the driftwood used to cook them. The marine vertebrates swam so close to shore that the Indians could run into the waters and catch them — a feat noted by Drake. In developing their handicrafts, the Indians were influenced by the abundance of tule grass in the marshes. They made no pottery, but from woody stems and fibers they constructed water-tight baskets, often decorated with shell beads, which they used as cooking utensils. Their houses were circular structures of poles usually tied together at the top and thatched with brush or tule matting. Rushes were used, too, for the short flaps worn as skirts by the women, though occasionally these garments were made of deerskin or of bark fiber. The men generally went entirely naked, except in the early morning when they sometimes plastered themselves with a coating of thick mud for warmth. On the basis of their crafts, mythology, or language, the California Indians can be classified in large groups, but such inter-relationships were involuntary. The intense particularism of local communities gave rise to marked variations, even between closely related groups. In small villages, usually comprising about 15 families each, lived the Indians of the Bay region. Each village claimed a well-defined territory with seasonal campsites reserved for its own use. If a deer hunt or a sum- mer wandering took its inhabitants as far as 50 miles, the racial brothers they encountered might be wholly alien to them and their dialects in- comprehensible. However, although they recognized no allegiance beyond that which they paid to their village chief, the peoples of the Bay region were all of one linguistic family, the Penutian. The greater A FRONTIER TO CONQUER 15 part of the Bay area was occupied by the Costanoan, whose territory included the San Francisco Peninsula, the coast country as far south as Point Sur, and the eastern shores of the Bay as far inland as the Mount Diablo Range. North of the Bay, as far east as the Sonoma Valley and as far north as the Russian River, lived the Coast Miwok. East- ward, beyond the Sonoma Valley, the Wintun held the shores of San Pablo and Suisun Bays. Among all the peoples of the earth, no others are known who kept so long unchanged their ways of living and thinking. During the last 30 to 40 centuries when western civilization was making its cyclical and labored rise, time stood still for the Bay Indians. Early white visitors remarked that these natives were squalid and listless. However, most such observers had seen them after the mission system had begun forcing upon them an alien civilization. In 1579 Drake's men had noted that the Miwok Indians handled their bows and arrows \"very skilfully,\" that their spokesman was \"using sich violent Gestures, and so strong a Voice, and speaking so fast that he was quite out of Breath,\" and that these Indians \"run very swiftly, and long, and seldom go any other Pace. . . .\" It was after 40 years of mission rule, in 1816, that the Frenchman Louis Choris described the apathy of the San Francisco Costanoan: \"I have never seen one laugh. I have never seen one look one in the face.\" Apathetic though they may have seemed to white men who could not understand their failure to take up arms in their own defense, still they were not lacking in sensitivity, for they gave lyrical expression to their feeling for the environment in their mythology and songs. In the beginning, the Costanoan told each other, waters covered all of the earth except the summit of Mount Diablo. There lived a coyote, a humming bird, and an eagle, and as the waters receded these three, but chiefly Coyote, created the world. Their myths about Coyote's subse- quent adventures are a mixture of ribald humor and idealism. The Indians worshipped the sun with offerings, and held sacred the towering redwood trees. To the Coast Miwok, Mount Tamalpais, whose long eastward slope resembles the figure of a sleeping woman, was the human bride of the sun god, who fell from his arms as he was trying to carry her to his celestial world. When summer fog wrapped the figure, the Indians told each other that this was her fleecy blanket, made by the god from his tears. Even critical white observers found the Costanoan songs peculiarly pleasing. In some of them the singers tried to express the sensibilities of small woodland animals — of the wood-rat, for instance: \"I dream of you, I dream of you jumping. Rabbit, jack-rabbit and quail . . .\" l6 SAN FRANCISCO Apparently they were aware that their Bay and its peninsulas were the dramatic western boundary of a great land, for another of their songs began : \"Dancing on the brink of the world . . .\" Such imagery suggests that the native singers were not wholly apathetic and morose. When the white man came, to prove that their coast was not the world's brink and to put an end forever to the danc- ing, apathy may not have been the only reason they did not laugh. THE WHITE MEN CAME Grim, medieval Carlos V of Spain — uncertain of his geography, but with his black eyes fixed on galleons bearing spices and treasure across the vast Pacific — had ordered Hernando Cortez, in the course of the expedition on which he set forth in 1532, to \"seek a natural port well north of New Spain\" where \"my navigators may find refuge, refit and rest.\" From such a safe harbor, far up the unexplored California coast, His Most Catholic Majesty had hoped that \"they may then continue the voyage from Manila to Acapulco with a greater degree of safety from the enemies of my country.\" Spanish navigators required 227 years to carry out this royal decree; and even then, it was not his Majesty's sailors but rather his soldiers, led by Don Caspar de Portola, who early in November of 1769 first dis- covered the great landlocked anchorage now known as San Francisco Bay. Not even Portola, to whom the glory has gone, was the first actually to see that body of inland water large enough to contain \"all the ships of Spain.\" From the summit of the Montara Ridge Don Caspar himself saw no more than the Gulf of the Farallones and, purple in the distance, the long headland which the navigator Sebastian Vizcaino, in 1603, had named Punta de los Reyes (Sp., King's Point). It fell to soldiers of his expedition whose names with one exception are unknown to look first on San Francisco Bay. Finding on the jagged shoreline no resemblance to the huge and sheltered bay described by Vizcaino in 1603, Portola's party had fol- lowed the shore of Monterey Bay without recognizing it to the mouth of the San Lorenzo River, present site of Santa Cruz. Pushing on through redwood trees, over ridges, arroyos, and creeks, they trudged past Half Moon Bay. Rising before them in the October rain they saw the rocky barrier of Montara Ridge, and at its base made their camp. The next day being clear, they surveyed from the summit of Point San Pedro the far-off purple cape of Point Reyes. Gazing at the distant headland christened in honor of the Three Wise Men of the East who had brought gold and frankincense and A FRONTIER TO CONQUER Ij myrrh to the infant Jesus, Don Gaspar decided it might be worthwhile to search the intervening coastline for that Puerto de San Francisco which shipwrecked Cermeno had happened upon in 1595. Portola therefore put one of his scouts, Sergeant Jose Francisco Ortega, in charge of a party of ten, presumably to explore the region as far north as Point Reyes. Sergeant Ortega's little band of soldiers never reached their rather ambiguous goal. Precisely what they did, where they went, and what they saw are mysteries which still tantalize the imagination of his- torians. Some authorities have advanced the theory that Ortega's prog- ress northward was halted by the Golden Gate, for which reason he must have been the first to look into San Francisco Bay from the vicinity of Point Lobos. However probable, the theory is pure conjecture based mainly on the fact that the exploring party, in the three days it was given to accomplish its purpose, had sufficient time to traverse the Peninsula to its end. The diary kept by Padre Juan Crespi, chronicler of Portola's expedition, gives scant information on this vexing possi- bility. And his diary, overburdened as it is by the padre's preoccupa- tion with the needs of Portola's men suffering from scurvy and diarrhea, is the only reliable record of these events. The San Francisco Peninsula's abundance of roots, acorns, grass- hoppers, sparrows, and squirrels may have been responsible for the tameness of the aborigines, but it hardly served to supply the lack of red meat and green vegetables which had brought Portola's men to the point of starvation. It was therefore mainly a desperate abdominal urge which drove them on to some rather extensive exploration of the area around San Francisco Bay — exploration which would later result in the establishment of the northernmost outpost of Spanish civilization in the New World. According to Padre Crespi's diary, which is corroborated by Miguel Costanso, Portola's engineer, the second exploring party was allotted four days for their itinerary and \"their ration of flour to keep off hunger for that time.\" They started on the afternoon of November 7. On the night of November 10, wrote Crespi, \"the explorers returned, very sad, and no longer believing in the report of the heathen, which they con- fessed they had not understood. They said that all the territory which they had examined to the northeast and north was impassable because of the scarcity of pasture and especially because of the ferocity and ill- temper of the heathen, who received them angrily and tried to stop their passage. They said also that they had seen another estuary of equal magnitude and extent with the one which we had in sight and with which it is communicated, but that in order to go around it one would have to travel many leagues; and that they saw no signs that might l8 SAN FRANCISCO indicate the proximity of the port where it terminates, and that the mountains were rough and difficult.\" So well does Crespi's description apply to the contra costa (Sp., opposite shore), it is fairly obvious that this exploring party discovered San Pablo Bay, probably from the rugged shoreline of Pinole Point, at that time inhabited by the Wintun Indians, who later proved a menace to Spanish settlers north of San Francisco Bay. Their failure to report having seen the Golden Gate indicates that they may have travelled inland, possibly up the Moraga Valley. Certain it is that famished as they were, and presumably mounted on mules equally famished, they took the easiest route they could find. Discouraged by their inability to reach the entrance of what they still believed was the port of Monterey, in the vicinity of Point Reyes, Portola's expedition began the long trek homeward to San Diego. The whole course of their explorations had been determined by their first view of the Gulf of the Farallones, which tallied with Cabrera Bueno's description of the old Port of San Francisco, derived originally from reports of Spanish galleons dropping anchor there for wood and water some 200 years before. Even if they had been able to see the Golden Gate from Point San Pedro, however, it is doubtful that they would have followed a different course, so convinced were they that Point Reyes was the headland of a great arm of the sea extending inland east of the rocky peninsula shaped like a plowshare which lies between Bolinas Lagoon and Tomales Bay. Padre Junipero Serra, father superior of the Franciscan missionaries in California — lean, ascetic, sometimes merciless, but a more efficient administrator than most secular representatives of Spain in the New World — came north by ship the following year (1770) to establish a mission on Monterey Bay, discovered finally at the cost of a second expedition. Even before the founding of this future capital of Alta California, Serra had insisted that surely one of the projected missions in the territory should be dedicated to the patron saint of his order. To this the Visitador-General, Don Jose de Galvez, had answered dryly: \"If St. Francis wants a mission, let him show us his port and we will found one.\" Now that Portola had been led by Divine Grace to St. Francis' port, it became an obvious duty to establish a mission there without delay. Hence, in the spring of 1772, Portola's young lieutenant, Pedro Fages, and Padre Crespi led a party of 12 soldiers from Mission San Carlos Borromeo (now Carmel Mission) to select a suitable site for the new mission near the entrance to what was now called the Port of Our Father St. Francis. The Fages expedition proceeded up the Salinas and Santa Clara Valleys, and northward around the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay. From the present site of Oakland, which they A FRONTIER TO CONQUER 19 passed on March 27, they must have had a fair view of the Golden Gate. Next day, from the hills below which Berkeley now stands, they saw through the Golden Gate the peaks of the southeast Farallon Islands rising on the horizon. Though Costanso later claimed that Portola's men were the first to see the famous strait, the honor doubtless belongs to the Fages party. From the Richmond Hills the explorers travelled northward to the south shore of San Pablo Bay a few miles east of San Pablo Point and then eastward past Carquinez Strait to the present site of Martinez. They skirted Suisun Bay and followed the south bank of the San Joaquin River almost to where Antioch now stands. Finding the San Joaquin too wide to cross, the Fages party decided to return to Mon- terey. On their homeward journey they passed through the Pacheco Valley, west of Mount Diablo through the San Ramon Valley, and down through Alameda Canyon to the site of the future Mission San Jose. From their camp near the present village of Milpitas they con- tinued down the old trail to Monterey which, beaten by the pack trains of the explorers who came after them, was to extend the great Camino Real (Sp., King's Highway) from Mexico to the northernmost limits of the Spanish Empire. The new Spanish viceroy at Mexico City, farsighted Antonio Bucareli, was determined, at the risk of losing one of his clumsy little ships on the dangerous California coast, to settle for once and for all the question of San Francisco Bay. He therefore sent Lieutenant Juan Manuel de Ayala on the San Carlos with instructions to make a further survey of the Gulf of the Farallones. As darkness fell on August 5, 1775, the San Carlos, having sent a launch ahead to find anchorage, sailed cautiously through the Golden Gate and anchored for the night. On August 7 it moved to a new anchorage on the north side of Raccoon Strait and a week later to another in Hospital Cove ofif Angel Island. The hardy band of settlers whom Juan Bautista de Anza led through incredible hardships all the way overland from Tubac in Sonora province had arrived on the present site of San Francisco with a platoon of soldiers and two priests by the time the San Carlos sailed a second time through the Golden Gate. With the assistance of the ship's carpenters and crew, Lieutenant Jose Joaquin Moraga's soldiers were able, on September 17, 1776, to raise the standard of Carlos III of Spain over the quarters of the comandante (commander) in the Presidio. The occasion was celebrated with a high mass, the firing of cannon, and the chanting of a fervent Te Deum. The opening and dedication of the new Mission San Francisco de Asis (later known as Mission Dolores) on the grass-clad slope near a small lake, dolefully named by the padres Laguna de los Dolores (Lake of Sorrows), was delayed until October 8, 1776 because of the absence 2O SAN FRANCISCO of Moraga on an exploring expedition. Moraga's expedition observed the feast-day of Saint Francis by proving conclusively that the Golden Gate was the only entrance to San Francisco Bay. \"At length,\" ex- claimed Padre Serra on his arrival at the new mission the following year, \"our Father St. Francis has advanced the sacred cross ... to the very last extremity of California; to go further requires ships.\" Unfortunately, St. Francis' new mission lacked adjacent arable land. Anza's poverty-stricken settlers, and the few who came after them, soon found the fertile Santa Clara Valley to the south more suitable for them than the wind-swept, flea-infested sandy wastes of the area dedicated to their patron saint. Therefore, on January 12, 1777, the new Mission Santa Clara was founded down the peninsula. And three miles south of it arose the first purely civil settlement in California — the pueblo (town) of San Jose. Before the close of the century two more Franciscan missions had been established in the Bay area: Mission Santa Cruz, on August 28, 1791, and Mission San Jose de Guadalupe, on June n, 1797. The lands which reminded Anza's settlers of the fertile valleys of Valencia soon brought prosperity to these adobe outposts of Catholicism; their baptismal fonts grew muddy with the dirt of Indians saved from the wrath of God. Only by slow degrees, however, did the reluctant aborigines desert their mud huts and childlike savage habits for the adobe barracks, the lengthy prayers and hard work of the missions. Though the padres occasionally lost patience and punished petty crimes with rawhide when sweet words were of no avail, they did not generally ill treat their converts. On the whole the condition of the Indians was improved by their strange new masters in cassocks with shaved heads whose God hung nailed upon a cross. Of course, they learned to speak Spanish and did the manual labor of plowing and harvesting; they ex- celled in handicraft and later as herders of cattle and sheep. By 1800 intermarriage had produced many mestizos (half-breeds) among the 30,000 Indians converted by the Bay region missions. Within the fol- lowing decade, however, the neophytes were decimated by measles and smallpox epidemics. Alarmed by the catastrophic mortality, which was threatening the mission with extinction, the fathers transferred a number of neophytes to the more salubrious climate of the north Bay region. The experi- ment proved successful; the health of these invalids was greatly im- proved. On December 14, 1817, the asistencia (chapel) of San Rafael was founded at the present site of the town of San Rafael. Young Padre Jose Altimira planned a more radical solution to the problem, namely, complete abandonment of Mission Dolores and transference of its neophytes along with those at San Rafael to a new mission at Sonoma. Accordingly Mission San Francisco Solano was founded in 1823 — with- A FRONTIER TO CONQUER 21 out, however, the authorization of church dignitaries, who objected. A compromise was reached, permitting the new mission and Mission Dolores and San Rafael as well to remain. It was to be the last mission founded in Alta California. Even after the outbreak of the Napoleonic wars, when trade with foreigners was declared illegal, alcaldes (mayors) and comandantes averted their eyes from the illicit traffic with American whalers and traders who brought oil, tea, textiles, silk, and household utensils in exchange for hides and agricultural products piled up in the storehouse of the missions. Rezanof's unromantic followers who settled around Fort Ross on Bodega Bay, and whom Governor Pablo de Sola dis- trusted, were being welcomed to Yerba Buena Cove with urbane polite- ness in 1821 — while the viceregal regime in Mexico City was being overthrown. The interregnum of General Agustin Iturbide's regency, immediately succeeded by the short-lived Empire of Mexico, passed almost unobserved by the Emperor's subjects in Alta California; and news of the institution of a republican regime, which reached the terri- tory in January, 1824, was received without much enthusiasm. At Mis- sion Dolores, Father Estenaja delivered a sermon praising the constitu- tion of the new Republic of Mexico and said a mass for its future greatness. The Presidio guns were fired, a few cheers went up; and when the echoes of the celebration had died away across the great Bay, the straggling settlement relaxed into its accustomed siesta. YANKEE INVASION The Bay region, despite a half century of misrule that combined paternalism with neglect, had attained economic independence when on March 26, 1825, Alta California formally was declared a province of the Mexican Republic. The decade which would elapse before the secularization of the missions was to witness the heyday of Hispano- Mexican colonization on the Pacific Coast. Mission San Jose in 1825 owned 62,000 head of cattle, as many sheep, and other livestock; in 1828 Mission Santa Clara had, besides other livestock, 14,500 head of cattle and 15,500 sheep. Mission Dolores' economic importance was, however, eclipsed by the cove of Yerba Buena to which the Bay area missions and ranchos brought their produce in oxcarts for trade with foreign ships. Besides their great herds, which furnished the hides and tallow sought by European and American traders, the missions owned vast fields planted in wheat and maize and other crops primarily for domestic consumption. Cloth, a coarse kind of serge, was woven from wool; and the aguardiente (brandy) distilled from the vineyards of Mission San Jose was the delight of foreign visitors. The missions, designed originally to form 22 SAN FRANCISCO the nuclei of pueblos and intended to relinquish control of their Indian convert-citizens to the civil authority, had become so wealthy by 1830 that they were reluctant to fulfill a destiny which would deprive them of their power. This system of monastic feudalism was likewise perpetuated by the vast ranchos, ranging from one-half to more than sixteen square leagues (a league being equal to about 4,438 acres), granted by Spanish gov- ernors to soldiers of the Portola and Fages expeditions. During the years of Mexican rule grants were also made to Americans and other foreigners who showed a disposition to settle the country in a neigh- borly manner. Rancho San Antonio, the 48,ooo-acre domain within whose former boundaries now stand the cities of Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland, Piedmont, and San Leandro, and Las Pulgas (the fleas), the 35,ooo-acre rancho granted in 1795 on which stand almost as many Peninsula towns, were typical of these feudal estates. Here, in their adobe ranch houses, the lordly dons entertained friends and relatives with lavish hospitality. They were grateful for the luxuries brought to Yerba Buena Cove by foreign traders whose followers would one day dispossess them. When the missions were secularized about 1834, the great land- owners came into possession of most of the mission lands — and of their Indian charges as well. The plan had been that the mission communities should be organized as towns, enough land set aside for the support of the clergy, and the surplus divided among the Indians. But to the administrators appointed by the government, rather than to the Indians, went the greater part of the flocks and herds and grain fields. Relieved from the discipline of the monks, the freed neophytes were the easy prey of gamblers and thieves. Without any direction, spiritual or eco- nomic, they became scattered on the great ranches whose owners under Mexican grants were getting control of the best of the lands in the coast valleys. All the while tuberculosis and smallpox and a declining birth rate were steadily reducing their numbers. The state of affairs at the Mission Dolores was typical. The pueblo did not develop into a pros- perous town. Padre Rafael de Jesus Moreno pointed out that the commissioner was acting for his own advantage rather than for the good of the Indians. Likewise there were charges and countercharges at Santa Clara, San Jose and the other missions around the Bay. All of them fell into neglect and decay. There were only 50 Indians at San Francisco when the French explorer and scientist, Duflot de Mofras, was there in 1841. International rivalries meanwhile were shaping the future of Alta California and the Bay area. Fort Ross, less than 100 miles north of the Bay, was developing into something more formidable than an out- post of Russian hunters of seal and sea otter who chased their prey from A FRONTIER TO CONQUER 23 the Farallon Islands right into San Francisco Bay. Representatives of Britain's Hudson's Bay Trading Company, who came to make surveys of the Boy region and to twit the comandante of Yerba Buena's presidio on the sad state of his defenses, had a knowing political gleam in their eyes. Least suspect of all were the Americans. Unlike some other for- eigners settling in the Bay region, they assumed no official character which could be construed as representing aggressive designs on the part of the United States. The majority of Yankee immigrants, in fact, adopted unhesitatingly the religion and customs of the Mexicans; they renounced their American citizenship and married into leading Mexican families. Not for some years after the first trappers had begun to cross the Sierra were the Yankees regarded by Mexican authorities with suspicion such as the Russian incursion into the Bay area had received since 1812. Secure behind their stockades and twelve brass cannons at Fort Ross, the Russians ignored repeated orders to leave the country. As early as 1817 Governor Pablo Vicente de Sola had reported to his superiors in Mexico City that he could not drive them out with the forces at his command, whose weapons were effective only against Indians armed with bows and arrows. Now that Mexico was an independent nation she no longer had protection from the Spanish navy, and no supply ships had arrived at Yerba Buena since 1811. Captain William Shaler, describing San Francisco Bay in 1805, found the entrance defended only \"by a battery on which are mounted some brass pounders, which afford only the show of defense ; and the place could make no resistance against the smallest military force . . .\" The Castillo de San Joaquin, here described, was not improved by subsequent decades of neglect. Whether or not the provincial authorities recognized the fact, from 1823 onward the American government had entered into the long-range struggle of world powers for control of Alta California. Concern over Russian inroads into the Bay region prompted Andrew Jackson's ad- ministration to undertake negotiations with the Mexican government for acquisition of Alta California. What \"Old Hickory\" had his eye on was that portion of Mexican territory north of the 37th parallel, including San Francisco Bay, which had been described to him as \"a most desirable place of resort for our numerous whaling vessels ... in the Pacific, far superior to any to which they now have access.\" The $3>5OO,ooo which Jackson offered Mexico's President Santa Anna was, however, refused; and the American government's subsequent attempts to bring the Mexicans to terms met with no better success. American citizens meanwhile were far from idle. From frontier settlements in Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee, trappers and fur traders in coonskin caps and greasy buckskin had been threading their 24 SAN FRANCISCO way across the plains and mountains of the West. First of these restless Yankees to reach Alta California by an overland route was Jedediah Smith. In the fall of 1826 this \"Pathfinder of the Sierras\" had opened the way for American settlement of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys. That his presence in the Bay region was unwelcome is ap- parent from the fact that, on his arrival at Mission San Jose, Padre Narciso Duran locked him in an outhouse; and upon his release Gov- ernor Jose Maria de Echeandia gave him two months to get his fur traders out of the country. The feudal rancheros had no great interest in encouraging trade and industry, but under Governor Jose Figueroa's liberal regime San Francisco Bay was declared a port of entry and, in 1835, the pueblo of Yerba Buena was laid out on the cove. Appointment of a harbormaster and lifting of restrictions on trade with foreign shipping opened for the Bay area a decade of friendly relations between Mexicans and Yankee settlers which might eventually have resulted in peaceful annexation of California by the United States. The appointment of Thomas O. Larkin as United States Consul to Alta California in 1843 was made, apparently, to encourage the Californios to sever their ties with Mexico and seek protection under the American flag. The loss of Texas to Sam Houston's rebellious settlers in 1836 left the regime in Mexico City in too perilous a state to cope with the political intrigue among its representatives in Alta California ; and some of these began to depend upon certain foreign elements in the province to maintain their despotic rule against rival officials and a citizenry from which arose the rumblings of revolt. Their most powerful aide in the vicinity of the Bay area was Johann Augustus Sutter, Swiss immi- grant and adventurer extraordinary, who had established a settlement in the Sacramento Valley. At Sutter's Fort were welcomed the Amer- ican immigrant trains whose oxcarts came straggling down through passes in the high Sierra after 1841. In 1841, when the Russians decided to withdraw from Fort Ross, Sutter had acquired all their territory around Bodega Bay. In return for assisting General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, comandante of Sonoma, to disperse the roving brigands which General Manuel Michel- torena brought with him from Mexico when he came to displace Gov- ernor Juan Bautista Alvarado at Monterey in 1842, the redoubtable Sutter was left unmolested to play off one rival official against another. Even when this \"Lord of the Marches\" threatened to \"proclaim Cali- fornia a Republic independent of Mexico\" if he were not given leave to do as he pleased, Vallejo dared not break off friendly relations with him. He wrote unhappily at the time, when American immigration was filling the Bay area with Yankee settlers, that \"the only certainty is that Californfans will die,\" and again, \"I dare not assure myself that A FRONTIER TO CONQUER 25 California will be saved.\" He drew what consolation he could from the fact that Sutter had prevented further encroachment of the British Hud- son's Bay Company and kept his political rival, Juan Bautista Alvarado, at a safe distance; but he saw the Americans taking over the country. When the first overland party from Missouri arrived at the ranch of Dr. John Marsh near Mount Diablo in November 1841, they were permitted to settle unmolested. Governor Micheltorena had orders to put a stop to all immigration; but his disreputable army had made him unpopular and he was dependent on American support to put down the conspiracies of rival officials who openly defied his authority. Further- more, the crafty Alvarado had left the treasury of the province empty ; and the secularization of the missions in 1834 nad already destroyed the source of funds by which presidio garrisons had been maintained. To aggravate this precarious situation even more, the American and British consuls in Monterey were keeping their respective governments informed of the events leading to a crisis in which intervention of some sort would decide the future of the territory. Such was the state of affairs in California and the Bay region when, in December 1845, Captain John Charles Fremont entered the prov- ince. As United States topographical engineer in command of two previous expeditions sent to survey California's natural resources, Fre- mont was received on January 27, 1846 in Monterey without serious misgivings by Mexican authorities, who gave him permission to obtain supplies pending his promised departure into Oregon. Little more than a month later, however, Fremont's followers joined him near San Jose, marched across the Santa Clara Valley and through the Santa Cruz Mountains, and camped near Monterey. Promptly ordered to leave the country, Fremont made a show of resistance, swearing that \"if we are hemmed in and assaulted we will die, every man of us under the flag of our country.\" Being neither hemmed in nor assaulted, Fremont's party withdrew up the Sacramento Valley to Sutter's Fort and proceeded north toward Oregon. His mar- tial depredations caused Larkin to petition Consul John Parrott at Mazatlan to send a warship to Monterey. Whether acting on secret orders received from the United States State Department or on his own initiative, Fremont suddenly retraced his steps and set up headquarters at Marysville Buttes in the Sierra foot- hills. From here a party of about a dozen Yankee hunters and trappers — in command of Ezekiel Merritt, a settler from Rancho Barranca Colorado (Red Bluff) — was ordered by Fremont to seize 170 horses being taken from Sonoma to Santa Clara by a party of Castro's men. The captured animals having been delivered to Fremont's new camp on the Bear River, Merritt's party of 20 marauders crossed the hills into Napa Valley, where they were joined by 12 or 13 recruits. 26 SAN FRANCISCO At daybreak on June 14, General Mariano G. Vallejo in his house at Sonoma was roused without warning by this little band of men and called upon to surrender. Somewhat puzzled, but courteous as always, he invited them in. On being informed that they were acting under Fremont's orders, he proceeded to wine and dine his callers to the point of stupor while terms of surrender were being discussed. At length the captors were able to agree on a declaration to which three of them put their names — Ezekial Merritt, Robert Semple, and William Fallon. They presented it to Vallejo: \"We, the undersigned having resolved to establish a government upon republican principles, in con- nection with others of our fellow-citizens, and having taken up arms to support it, we have taken three Mexican officers as prisoners: Gen. M. G. Vallejo, Lieut. Col. Victor Prudhon and Capt. Salvador Vallejo.\" But dissension then broke the ranks of the insurrectionists, frightened by the magnitude of their exploit. William B. Ide, a Yankee settler with the gift of oratory, saved the day. Cried he: \"I will lay my bones here before I will take upon myself the ignominy of commencing an honorable work and then flee like cowards, like thieves, when no enemy is in sight. In vain will you say you had honorable motives. Who will believe it? Flee this day, and the longest life cannot wear out your disgrace! . . . We are robbers, or we must be conquerors!\" Taking possession of the pueblo without opposition, the rebels im- patiently hauled down the Mexican flag. It occurred to them that a new flag was needed to replace it. On a piece of homespun to which was attached a strip of red flannel they painted a red star and the crude figure of a grizzly bear. \"My countrymen,\" orated Lieutenant Henry L. Ford as the new standard was hoisted up the flagpole, \"we have taken upon ourselves a damned big contract.\" But the insurgents' chosen leader, William B. Ide, who promptly dubbed himself \"Com- mander-in-chief\" and later \"President of the California Republic,\" was undaunted. He invited \"all peaceable and good citizens of Califor- nia ... to repair to my camp at Sonoma, without delay, to assist us in establishing and perpetuating a Republican government, which shall secure to all civil and religious liberty, which shall encourage virtue and literature ; which shall leave unshackled by fetters, agriculture, com- merce and manufactures.\" Though Fremont would admit no direct responsibility for the \"Bear Flag\" rebellion, he ordered the arrest of Jacob Leese, Vallejo's brother- in-law, because he was a \"bad man\"; and according to Leese's account, he also threatened to hang Sutter for demanding that consideration be shown a man of Vallejo's pro-American sympathies. It was generally assumed, by both Yankee settlers and Califomios in the Bay region, that Fremont was in command of a movement to seize the territory. General Castro, learning of the affair at Sonoma, sent a force of A FRONTIER TO CONQUER 27 50 or 60 men under Joaquin de la Torre to attack the \"Bears.\" March- ing northward from San Rafael, De la Torre's contingent was joined by Juan Padilla's roving bandits. On the morning of June 24, 1846, the California* were attacked at the Olompali Rancho near Petaluma by 17 or 1 8 men under Lieutenant Henry L. Ford. After a charge in which one of De la Torre's men was killed and several wounded by Ford's riflemen, the Calif ornios retired and the Americans returned to Sonoma. Until this first battle of the war Fremont had taken no open part in the events which his presence doubtless had precipitated. Now, however, as he says in his Memoirs, \"I have decided that it was for me to govern events rather than to be governed by them. I represent the Army and the Flag of the United States.\" Furthermore he realized that \"at last the time had come when England must not get a foothold; that we must be first. I was to act, discreetly but positively.\" And act he did, though neither he nor his Mexican opponents were as yet aware that their respective countries were already at war below the Rio Grande. Arriving at Sonoma on June 25, Fremont assumed command of the Bears and with a combined force of 130 men marched to meet De la Torre's detachment at San Rafael. Here occurred an incident which ever since has blemished Fremont's reputation. This was the murder of three innocent Californios — the twin sons of Yerba Buena's first alcalde, Francisco de Haro, and old Don Jose Berryesa, father of the alcalde of Sonoma who was then among Fremont's prisoners at Sutter's Fort. On being informed by Kit Carson that these three were about to land from a boat at Point San Pedro, Fremont is reported to have said : \"I have no room for prisoners.\" Kit Carson, G. P. Swift, and one of Fremont's trappers shot down the three unarmed men. Outnumbered and badly armed, De la Torre's forces fled across the Bay to join Jose Castro's at Santa Clara. Following Fremont's raid on the old Castillo de San Joaquin, Dr. Robert Semple, participant in the Bear Flag affair at Sonoma, led ten men on a foray into Yerba Buena which captured Robert Ridley, ex-factor of the local Hudson's Bay Company post. After thus putting down all military resistance of the Californios in the Bay region Fremont returned to Sonoma to declare the inde- pendence of California and place the country under martial law for the duration of the conflict. While continuing \"in pursuit of Castro\" in the valley of the Sacramento (actually Castro already had begun his retreat southward from Santa Clara), Fremont received news that the United States naval commander on the Pacific Coast, Commodore John D. Sloat, had raised the American flag at Monterey and had ordered the U.S.S. Portsmouth to do likewise at Yerba Buena. Thenceforth 28 SAN FRANCISCO the Bay region heard only distant rumblings as the Yankee invasion progressed southward with mild skirmishes in the Salinas Valley, to end at last in a decisive victory for the Americans at San Gabriel, January 8-9, 1847- The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, February 2, 1848, gave Cali- fornia to the United States. The Bay region's Bear Flag war was only an incident in the hasty transfer of a vast territory from one nation to another. But it marked the beginning of a new era, and the end of an old one. And Jose Castro himself, comandante-general of the forces of the north in the struggle of the Calif ornios against the Yankee invaders, foresaw in some degree what that new era would be like when he told an assembly at Monterey: \"These Americans are so con- triving that some day they will build ladders to touch the sky, and once in the heavens they will change the whole face of the universe and even the color of the stars.\" Emporium of a New \". . . San Francisco . . . the sole emporium of a new world, the awakened Pacific . . \" — RICHARD HENRY DANA HARDLY had the dead hand of Mexican rule been lifted from the Bay region when the Gold Rush struck it like a hurricane. The thousands who flocked to the shores of San Francisco Bay in 1848 at first asked little. But when the excitement died down the little gold frontier town had become a city, and its people demanded much: wharves, and dry paved streets; homes and stores, with firm foundations on which to build them; and a transportation system that would encompass not only the land about the Bay, but the Bay itself. Almost overnight the fleet of steamers and sailing ships which glutted with the manufactured products of Eastern merchants the wharves of San Francisco, Stockton, and Sacramento established the Bay's mari- time supremacy on the Pacific Coast. Mining camps developed into towns and cities amid the rich agri- cultural lands of the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys; and around the old pueblos of San Jose and Santa Clara the vast ranches of the Mexicans and Spaniards became orchards, fields, and vineyards. From these, and from the soil of Sonoma County, from Napa Valley and from the counties of the contra costa, would come the \"green gold\" which a vast system of canneries and packing houses now prepares for distribution all over the world. To supply this populous hinterland with commodities, and to bring down to the harbors of the Bay its tons of exports, a network of railroads and highways, bridges .and improved inland waterways had to be established. Throughout almost a century Bay region industrialists, farmers, and shippers have had to struggle with problems of engineering to overcome deficiencies in an area other- wise ideally suited to the building of prosperous communities and metro- politan centers. For all its magnificence and its utility, San Francisco Bay was, until completion of its two great bridges, an obstacle to transportation which prevented development of large sections of Marin County; and it isolated the industrial centers of the East Bay from financial and distribution facilities of San Francisco. Phenomenally rapid as its progress has been, this new unity, which engineering has accomplished, assures a future of more intense and orderly development for all com- munities of the Bay region. 29 3O SAN FRANCISCO Today, the San Francisco Bay region is the market place and work- shop for a population of nearly 2,000,000 people — a great harbor ringed with factory smokestacks, sheltering vessels from all ports of the globe, terminus of transcontinental railroads and airlines and home base of the Pacific Clippers flying to the Orient. Ranking second in value of water-borne commerce of all United States ports, the San Francisco Bay area has become the Pacific Coast's largest distribution center and the West's financial capital. Among 30 industrial areas of the Nation, it ranked sixth as a manufacturing center, with an industrial output of more than $800,000,000 in 1935. Its wholesale trade volume of $*> 353,7 JO for the same year was larger than the value of its water- borne commerce; and the value of its retail trade was half as large. WORLD PORT John Masefield's \"dirty British coaster with salt-caked smokestacks\" is but one of the myriad craft, from nations all over the world, which have come and gone through the Golden Gate since Lieutenant Manuel de Ayala's little San Carlos first dropped anchor in San Francisco Bay in 1775. Across the racing tides of that narrow channel have swept the white sails of the clipper ships that brought the Argonauts ; through it have steamed sidewheelers and modern freighters, sleek liners and palatial yachts, naval armadas and army transports; and casting brief shadows of the future upon it, and upon the mighty bridge which spans the strait, the silver wings of clipper planes go soaring out across the Pacific. The pioneer Pacific Mail Steamship Company's i,ooo-ton side- wheeler, California, already had sailed from New York for the Pacific Coast by way of Cape Horn, with no passengers, when the news of the discovery of gold in California reached the East. When the Cali- fornia anchored at Panama on January 30, 1849, she found hundreds of frenzied gold-hunters who had made their way across the Isthmus awaiting her. On February 28, topheavy with several times her capacity of loo passengers, she steamed through the Golden Gate — the first vessel to round Cape Horn under her own steam and sail into the Bay of San Francisco. Pacific Mail promptly hurried completion of two sister ships; but these were not enough. Its fleet rapidly grew to 29 steamships destined to carry 175,000 people to San Francisco within :a decade. During the height of the Gold Rush, however, demand so far out- distanced supply in the maritime industry that chaos reigned, retarding for several years development of regular and systematic commercial facilities. The rapid increase in population — from about 860 to almost 42,000 by the end of 1852 in San Francisco alone — brought a wide and EMPORIUM OF A NEW WORLD 31 insistent demand for manufactured goods, tools, machinery and food products which undeveloped local industry could not supply. Eastern shippers, without accurate knowledge of local requirements, sent tons of merchandise for which San Francisco could find no use. The market was glutted ; prices crashed ; goods of every description were left to rot in the holds of ships, on the wharves, and in the city streets. Fully as demoralizing to maritime commerce was the wholesale desertion of ship's crews, who joined the wild rush to the mines. San Francisco Bay in the early fifties presented a sight seldom seen in the history of the world: a veritable forest of masts rising from hundreds of aban- doned ships. With the gradual stabilization of trading conditions, however, mari- time commerce was revived until the rapid increase in shipping made necessary the immediate building of extensive piers and docking facilities. Prior to the Gold Rush all cargoes had been lightered ashore in small boats, usually to the rocky promontory of Clark's Point at the foot of Telegraph Hill. When in the winter of 1848 the revenue steamer James K. Polk was run aground at the present intersection of Vallejo and Battery Streets — at that time part of the water front — the narrow gangplank laid from deck to shore was considered a distinct advance in harbor facilities. The brig Belfast was the first vessel to unload at a pier: she docked in 1848 at the newly completed Broadway Wharf — a board structure ten feet wide. Others were soon built. By October 1850, 6,000 feet of wharfage had been constructed at a cost of $1,000,- ooo. As the tidal flats were filled in, the piers were extended: Com- mercial Wharf, at first extending only 30 feet into waters only two feet deep, became Long Wharf as it was lengthened to 400 feet to pro- vide docking facilities for deep water shipping. During the boom years of the 1 850*5 competition between Eastern shippers became so sharp that a type of sailing vessel faster than the old schooners and barques constructed on the lines of whaling ships had to be built. Between 1850 and 1854, J6o fast clipper ships were launched on the Eastern seaboard to supply the demand for speed and more speed to the Pacific Coast. \"On to the mines\" was the order of the day for both passengers and cargoes landed on San Francisco's water front. The fastest way to the mines was by water — through San Pablo Bay, Carquinez Strait, and Suisun Bay, and up the San Joaquin River to Stockton, or up the Sacra- mento to the town named for it. The first steamboat in the Bay, the 37-foot sidewheeler Sitka, imported in sections from the Russian settle- ment at Sitka, Alaska, and reassembled, had already attempted the trip to Sacramento, requiring six days and seven hours. Vessels better equipped for the journey were soon imported. Meanwhile, lighter craft were pressed into traveling service. Since 1835, when William A. 32 SAN FRANCISCO Richardson had begun operating two 3Oton schooners with Indian crews to transport the produce of missions and ranches from San Fran- cisco and San Jose to trading vessels anchored in the Bay, a variety of small vessels had plied the waters inside the Golden Gate. In 1850 Captain Thomas Gray's propeller steamer Kangaroo began the first regular run, twice weekly, between San Francisco and San Antonio Landing (now Oakland) in the East Bay. On September 2, 1863, the San Francisco and Oakland Railroad Company, first in the Bay region, began running the Contra Costa six times daily from its Oakland wharf to Broadway Wharf in San Francisco; and the following year, the San Francisco and Alameda Railroad Company inaugurated train- ferry service from Alameda Wharf with the Sophie McLane. At the Alameda Wharf, on September 6, 1869, the steamer Alameda took on the first boatload of passengers arriving on the Pacific Coast by trans- continental railroad. After the opening of ferry slips at the two-mile Oakland Long Wharf in 1871 and at a new San Fransisco passenger station at the foot of Market Street four years later, the ferry fleet grew rapidly in size. In 1879 the world's largest ferry, the Solano, began transport- ing whole railroad trains across Suisun Bay from Benicia to Port Costa. The ferry system was extended until by 1930 the 43 boats operating between San Francisco and Oakland, Alameda, Berkeley, Sausalito, and Vallejo comprised the largest transportation enterprise of its kind in the world; in that year they carried a total of more than 40,000,000 pas- sengers. The lifting of the Mexican regime's restrictive measures against foreign trading brought the Pacific whalers to San Francisco. As early as 1800, whaling vessels had begun to anchor in sheltered Richardson's Bay, then known as Whaler's Bay, off the site of Sausalito, where they took on wood and water. The first captain of the port, shrewd William A. Richardson, had collected fees for piloting the whalers to their anchorage. But Mexican regulations and tariffs forced the whaling industry to base its operations in the Sandwich Islands. After Ameri- can occupation, San Francisco merchants, foreseeing profits to be gained from yearly outfitting of the whalers and their crews, made hardy efforts to center the industry here. They succeeded to such an extent that by 1865 a total of 34 whalers, with a combined tonnage of 11,000 tons,, anchored in the Bay. As late as 1888, San Francisco was still Pacific Coast whaling head- quarters. But the whaling fleet dwindled rapidly after 1900 — as tug- boats for pursuit (\"killer\" ships) and steam-driven processing plants (factory ships) supplanted sailing vessels — until in 1938 the California Whaling Company, sole survivor in the industry, called in for the last time its remaining ships. EMPORIUM OF A NEW WORLD 33 Within two decades after the building of its first wharf, the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula was saw-toothed with piers. The water front had been pushed into the Bay as the shallow waters of Yerba Buena Cove were filled in. In 1873, two years after control of the San Francisco water front had been acquired by the State, the con- struction of a great sea wall was begun by the State Board of Harbor Commissioners; and in 1878, the aoo-foot wide Embarcadero was laid out. San Francisco's great era of maritime commerce was entering into the full stride of its phenomenal development. While shovels and picks and gold pans rusted in thousands of back yards, the State turned from gold mining to agriculture and manufac- turing. Sacramento and Stockton, great mining centers during the Gold Rush, became agricultural capitals of northern California. The two great rivers sweeping inland to these cities became arteries of com- merce. Barges and river boats stopped at numberless docks and land- ings to pick up the diversified products of the rich land that swept for miles on either side of the broad rivers. And the products of the great agricultural hinterland, flowing into San Francisco Bay, contributed heavily to its export trade. From 1860 to 187"
