Ms. Muna Mohamed situated in the new hargeisa\n\nsuburb.The murder of the late Ruqiya Said Ayaanle shocked the nation.\n\nOn the other hand , a former solider convicted for the murder of a senior\n\nofficer was also executed today.\n\n4 convicts were executed on the 11th of January after Somaliland authorities\n\nrenewed use of the death penalty.\n\n(source: Somaliland Press)\n\nVIETNAM:\n\nDeath penalty ends in some cases\n\nHow do you respond to a change to the 2015 Penal Code that says the death\n\npenalty will not apply for officials who pay back at least 75 per cent of\n\nillicitly obtained profits?\n\nThis is regulated in Point C, Clause 3 in Article 40 of the 2015 Penal Code.\n\nSome people think this is too lenient, but in my opinion, it is not.\n\nThe most severe penalty for the crimes of embezzlement and bribery was capital\n\npunishment under the previous Penal Code. During discussions regarding\n\nrevisions to this law, legislators agreed to keep capital punishment as\n\ndeterrent for the two crimes, but reduce it to life imprisonment if the\n\ncriminal is able to pay back at least 75 per cent of the profits they illicitly\n\nobtained.\n\nCan current prisoners be given amnesty if they repent and adhere to the new\n\nlaw?\n\nThese cases will be treated carefully. The criteria for considering whether\n\nthey should be granted amnesty would be much stricter and tougher than for\n\nother prisoners serving life sentences. For example, lifers could have their\n\nsentence reduced to 20 years for good behaviour.\n\nIf a death sentence is reduced to life imprisonment, they must serve at least\n\n30 years.\n\nAs I have mentioned above, officials convicted of corruption could be spared if\n\nthey pay back at least 75 % of the profits they illicitly obtained. In\n\naddition, there are other requirements that these prisoners would have to meet,\n\nincluding helping authorities to conduct investigations into other corruption\n\ncases.\n\nIf an official stole VND100 billion (US$4.45 million) and received the death\n\nsentence, they could pay back 75 % and have their sentence reduced. What would\n\nhappen to the other VND25 billon ($1.11 million)?\n\nUnder the 2015 Penal Code, any public official who illegally obtains VND1\n\nbillion upwards could receive capital punishment. Point C, Clause 3 of Article\n\n40 of the 2015 Penal Code applies to all prisoners who receive death sentences\n\nrelating to corruption, regard less of the amount of money. However, during\n\ntheir prison terms, they may enjoy clemency for good behaviour.\n\n(source: vietnamnet.vn)\n\nPALESTINIAN AUTHORITY:\n\nAide to Palestinian negotiator arrested over 'spying for Israel'\n\nPalestinian intelligence officers have arrested an employee of top negotiator\n\nand PLO secretary-general Saeb Erekat on accusations of \"spying for Israel\", a\n\nsecurity source said on Sunday.\n\nThe high-ranking official said on condition of anonymity that the man employed\n\nin the negotiations department of the Palestine Liberation Organisation was\n\narrested around two weeks ago.\n\nAccording to the official, the man, whose identity was not revealed, was an\n\n\"administrative employee without access to political files.\"\n\nHe was arrested \"for spying on behalf of Israel,\" he said.\n\nThe suspect is said to have confessed after being arrested in the occupied West\n\nBank town of Ramallah, where the Palestinian Authority is based.\n\nHe had been under surveillance for a long period of time, according to the\n\nsource.\n\nPalestinian security forces were in the process of evaluating any potential\n\ndamage caused by the suspect's activities.\n\nErekat, a close ally of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, has been the top\n\nnegotiator in peace efforts with Israel. Talks have been at a standstill for\n\nnearly 2 years.\n\nUnder Palestinian law, those accused of spying for Israel risk the death\n\npenalty.\n\n(source: Yahoo.com)\n\nIRAQ:\n\nIraq: Executing Terrorists-----Has Iraq's extensive use of the death penalty\n\ndone anything to deter terrorism?\n\nIraq carried out the 4th-most executions (behind China, Iran and Saudi Arabia)\n\nin 2014.\n\nIn 2003, the United States temporarily suspended Iraq's use of executions.\n\nThe vast majority of executions in Iraq have been carried out for\n\nterrorism-related offences.\n\n1. Iraq carried out the fourth-most executions (behind China, Iran and Saudi\n\nArabia) in 2014, with at least 61 executions, according to Amnesty\n\nInternational. Escalation of armed conflict in some parts of the country during\n\nthe year - including the rise of ISIS - makes the actual number difficult to\n\nconfirm.\n\n2. Shortly after invading Iraq in 2003, the United States temporarily suspended\n\nIraq's use of executions.\n\n3. The deposed Ba'ath Party had used the punishment as a means of religious and\n\npolitical oppression. Existing death row inmates had to be sorted out.\n\nDeath Penalty: A \"Just The Facts\" Series\n\n4. Iraq's death penalty was reinstated a year later and was used, most notably,\n\nin the December 2006 hanging of Saddam Hussein for crimes against humanity.\n\n5. Over the past decade, the vast majority of executions in Iraq have been\n\ncarried out for terrorism-related offences.\n\n6. A 2005 Iraqi law made death the mandatory sentence for conviction for acts\n\nof terrorism or even support for terrorism. Many less serious offenses also\n\ncarry the death penalty, contrary to global standards.\n\n7. The 61 confirmed Iraqi executions in 2014, however, are a dramatic reduction\n\nfrom the 169 in 2013.\n\n8. The frequent number of large-scale prison breaks in Iraq, particularly by\n\nterrorist groups freeing their fighters, may be a factor in the reliance on the\n\ndeath penalty to give more finality to the capture of major threats.\n\n9. Iraqi officials, however, tend to claim more simply that frequent executions\n\nare legitimately grounded in local tradition.\n\n(sources: Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and The Globalist Research\n\nCenter)\n\nJAPAN:\n\nTravesty of justice: legal reform unlikely despite erroneous convictions\n\n2 elderly men fighting for decades to clear their names are poised to receive\n\nhigh-profile retrials in 2016 and yet their ordeals are unlikely to trigger\n\nwide-ranging reform to the country's justice system, experts say.\n\nEven after being sent to prison for murder, Iwao Hakamada at first trained like\n\nthe prizefighter he was. Fellow death-row inmate Kazuo Ishikawa used to watch\n\nhim shadowbox and punch the walls of his cell till his knuckles turned bloody.\n\nThe pain seemed to mean little to him, Ishikawa recalls. \"He was very strong.\"\n\nToday, Hakamada, now a stooped, fleshy 79-year-old, strolls daily through the\n\nstreets of his native Shizuoka Prefecture communing with ghosts. After 48 years\n\nin jail, the large majority of it in solitary confinement waiting for his\n\nexecution, he is temporarily free but appears to have retreated deep inside his\n\nown head. He answers questions about his ordeal in the third person, if at all.\n\n\"The guy called Hakamada could not have committed a crime because he wasn't in\n\nJapan,\" he says during an interview at an apartment he shares with his sister.\n\n\"He was born in Buckingham Palace, in Hawaii.\"\n\nOn his daily walks, he explains, he hears the souls of the dead from the\n\nsurrounding buildings, pleading for help.\n\nHakamada was arrested in August 1966 on suspicion of murdering a family of 4.\n\nAfter years of appeals, Shizuoka District Court said in 2014 that police\n\nevidence against him was probably fabricated and revoked his death sentence.\n\nThe prosecution disagrees and, as a result, Hakamada awaits retrial and the\n\npossibility that the police will return him to a 5-square-meter cell.\n\nFlanked by his sister, Hideko, Hamakada still believes he is 22. He gives no\n\nclue that he entered the history books in 2011 as the world's longest-serving\n\ndeath-row prisoner.\n\n\"He has built a high wall around his heart to stay strong,\" says Nobuhiro\n\nTerazawa, a friend of the Hamakadas. \"That's how he survived.\"\n\nWhere Hakamada is withdrawn and inarticulate, Ishikawa is angry and outspoken,\n\ndemanding the state overturn his conviction for murdering a Saitama schoolgirl\n\nin 1963. His death sentence was later commuted to life. Since Ishikawa's parole\n\n2 decades ago, he has relentlessly fought for a retrial. Justice, he believes,\n\nis finally near.\n\n\"I am not supposed to utter a word about my innocence but the police are\n\nwithholding a mountain of evidence,\" he says, following a protest with his wife\n\nand supporters - his 120th - outside Tokyo District Court. \"Once they disclose\n\nit, I will be proven innocent, no question.\"\n\nIshikawa reels off a handful of other cases where death-row inmates have had\n\ntheir convictions overturned: Sakae Menda, Masao Akabori, Yukio Saito and now\n\nHakamada. The only reason these 4 lived and others didn't, he says, is because\n\nthey fought until the state caved in.\n\n\"The police disclosed the evidence (they were concealing). They were all\n\ngranted retrials,\" he says. \"A prison guard once told me that I would be\n\nexecuted in a couple of years even if I were innocent. 'There is only 1 way you\n\ncan be saved,' he told me. 'You need to study so that you can appeal your\n\ninnocence to the people of Japan in a letter. There is no other way you can\n\nsurvive.' He (then) taught me how to read and write.\"\n\nHakamada and Ishikawa represent the country's highest-profile modern legal\n\nmiscarriages. Hakamada's release made global headlines and briefly shook public\n\nconfidence in the nation's justice system. Sometime in 2016, their cases are\n\nfinally expected to get another legal airing. Reformers, however, are\n\npessimistic that the system will change.\n\nJudicial officials are fighting to protect the status quo, says Yoshihiro\n\nYasuda, arguably the country's most famous death-penalty opponent.\n\n\"The prosecution and judges have not accepted they did anything wrong (in the\n\nHakamada case),\" he says. \"They should be shocked that such a thing could\n\nhappen and try to do better. Instead, they always try to prove that they were\n\nright.\"\n\nHakamada's freedom was soon followed by the release of Keiko Aoki, who had\n\nspent 20 years in prison for lighting a fire that killed her 11-year-old\n\ndaughter in September 1995. Many now believe leaking gasoline in the family\n\ngarage started the blaze.\n\nThe murky legal process that put all 3 in prison, largely on the basis of\n\nconfessions extracted through intimidation and torture, has been under scrutiny\n\nfor decades. Ishikawa endured 30 days of interrogation and signed a confession\n\nunder psychological duress, although he was illiterate at the time.\n\nHakamada was interrogated for 20 days with no lawyer present, says Amnesty\n\nInternational. He later retracted his confession, claiming the police had\n\nbeaten and threatened him. Still, Shizuoka District Court sentenced him to\n\ndeath in September 1968.\n\nAoki lasted a single day in a police station, where she had gone voluntarily,\n\nbefore putting her name to a statement admitting arson and murder. Detectives\n\nplayed on her grief by repeatedly screaming that she was responsible for the\n\ndeath of her child. She retracted the confession the next day.\n\nEven critics of the country's justice system accept that it gets a lot right.\n\nRates of recidivism are comparatively low and the emphasis is on\n\nrehabilitation. A lot of effort is made to keep young offenders out of the\n\nprison system.\n\nCitizens are incarcerated at a far lower rate than in most developed countries:\n\n55 per 100,000 people compared with 149 in Britain and 716 the United States.\n\nNevertheless, the entire system would collapse without confessions, David\n\nJohnson, a judicial expert on Japan at the University of Hawaii recently told\n\nThe Economist. Confessions underpinned 89 % of domestic criminal cases in 2014.\n\nWith up to 23 days to interrogate a suspect, police have the legal means to\n\nextract confessions. Suspects are almost always convicted once indicted. And,\n\nlike anywhere, bias can affect police procedure: Aoki's partner, who was\n\nconvicted of the same crime, was ethnically Korean; Ishikawa came from the\n\n\"burakumin\" underclass; and Hakamada was poor and, to the eyes of the police,\n\nhis supporters say, thuggish.\n\n\"I think there are many, many more wrongful convictions in Japan,\" says Kana\n\nSasakura, an associate professor of law at Konan University.\n\nSasakura leads a movement in Japan, modeled on the U.S. Innocence Project, to\n\nright miscarriages of justice. Although nobody knows how many innocent people\n\nare in Japanese prisons, some experts believe 1,500 convictions a year may be\n\nflawed. More than 1/2 of the 131 people on the country's death row are\n\nchallenging their convictions.\n\nThe postwar Allied Occupation modernized the country's courts by introducing\n\nlegal protections for the criminally accused - most notably, the right to\n\nsilence and the presumption of innocence. The reforms attempted to steer courts\n\naway from reliance on confessions and stop prosecutors appealing verdicts of\n\nnot guilty.\n\nAs with so many of the Allied reforms, some were tolerated and took root,\n\nothers tossed out or ignored. In practice, silence is deemed to be indicative\n\nof guilt and confessions are still treated \"almost like a religion,\" Sasakura\n\nsays. \"The police believe that expression of remorse is a key part of the\n\nsystem.\"\n\nIf, as expected, Hakamada and Ishikawa are exonerated, the legal authorities\n\nwill likely argue that the system has changed in the half century since their\n\nconvictions. Physical abuse is rarer and lawyers more likely to be present.\n\nThe Justice Ministry says bills to revise criminal procedure are making their\n\nway through the Diet. \"These include mandatory monitoring (voice recording and\n\nvideotaping) of interrogations,\" says a ministry spokesman, who declined to be\n\nnamed in accordance with departmental policy.\n\nYasuda, however, is skeptical that much will change. The proposal to record\n\ninterrogations may actually make things worse by forcing these abuses off\n\ncamera, he says.\n\nPolice will still be in almost complete control. And in any case, the proposal\n\n- agreed after a string of miscarriages and years of discussion - will affect\n\nless than 3 % of all interviews conducted by the police.\n\nSuspects still have very little protection from the police, says Fumito\n\nMorikawa, a defense lawyer who represented people arrested outside the Diet\n\nduring summer protests against security legislation in 2015. Morikawa says\n\nabuses of suspects in the form of verbal insults, sleep deprivation and\n\nthreatening behavior are \"too numerous to mention.\"\n\n\"The key violence,\" he says, \"lies in the length of detention.\"\n\nMorikawa says miscarriages will continue until the extended use of detention\n\ncells in police holding areas is scrapped. The system, known as daiyo kangoku\n\n(substitute prison), is key to extracting statements from suspects because it\n\ngives police so much control over the interview process. He says he recently\n\nwon just his 4th court victory in a legal career spanning 25 years.\n\n\"The fact is,\" he says, \"my client would have lost had he confessed.\"\n\nCritics campaigning for reform put their hopes in the country's lay judge\n\nsystem, which injected some civilian input into the cloistered professional\n\nworld of prosecutors, lawyers and judges. Since 2009, more than 50,000 people\n\nhave served in trials for serious crimes. Yet, the system has done nothing to\n\nlower the conviction rate or reliance on confessions. If anything, lay judges\n\nappear to hand down harsher sentences in serious crimes. In October 2013, for\n\nexample, the Tokyo High Court overturned a death penalty handed down by a lay\n\njudge panel, calling the sentence an \"error.\" It was the 2nd time a high court\n\nabrogated a death sentence rendered by a lay judge panel that year.\n\nA possible reason why the introduction of lay judges has not changed the system\n\nis that decisions cannot be reached without the agreement of professional\n\njudges. \"My view of the lay judge system is it exists to allow judges to\n\ncontinue generating similar results with less criticism of them,\" says Colin\n\nP.A. Jones, a professor at Doshisha Law School in Kyoto.\n\nPublic prosecutors drive the entire system and their careers sometimes take\n\nprecedence over justice. Nearly 1/3 of prosecutors believe that a verdict of\n\nnot guilty hurts their promotion prospects, according to an official survey in\n\n2010 - 1 reason why many weaker cases are dropped. 1/4 of respondents said they\n\nhad been instructed to write confession statements bearing no relation to what\n\nsuspects actually said.\n\nMisconduct often goes unchecked; prosecutors can block inquiries. They put\n\npressure on the police to extract confessions. And, despite occasional\n\nhigh-profile releases from prison such as Hakamada, the media and the public\n\nlargely back them because they appear to produce low rates of crime and\n\nrecidivism. As a result, prosecutors are left secure in their self-appointed\n\nrole of maintaining social order.\n\nReforming this system is a mammoth task, Yasuda says. At a minimum, he says,\n\nprosecutors should be forced to disclose all evidence to the defense - evidence\n\nthat would help exonerate suspects such as Hakamada and Ishikawa. The length of\n\ndetention should also be brought into line with international norms and Japan\n\nshould introduce a third-party body to oversee miscarriages and free the\n\nunjustly convicted, he says.\n\nThe political motivation to push these reforms, however, has weakened. For one\n\nthing, Supreme Court justices are appointed by the Cabinet. For another,\n\nSasakura says, the government is currently focused on the economy and larger\n\npolitical issues. \"The justice system is the least of their priorities,\"\n\nSasakura says.\n\nIn any case, reform has come too late for Ishikawa. \"If I hadn't signed a\n\nstatement, I'd never have been convicted of a crime,\" he says. \"I was 24 at the\n\ntime; I'm 76 now. I would have never said I'd done it even if I went through\n\nharsh interrogation because I didn't do it. However, I confessed to a crime I\n\nnever committed. For that, I must apologize to the people of Japan. For that, I\n\nstill blame myself to this day.\"\n\nDeath-row inmates in daily wait for execution notice\n\nKazuo Ishikawa was sentenced to death for the kidnap, rape and murder of\n\n16-year-old Yoshie Nakata, whose body was found on a farm in Saitama Prefecture\n\nin May 1963. The crime shocked Japan and put enormous pressure on police and\n\nprosecutors.\n\nIshikawa confessed to the crime on June 20, 1963. He says the police told him\n\nif he signed a statement they wrote he would get a maximum of 10 years in\n\nprison and save his family from disgrace. Instead, he was sentenced to death\n\nand his family members were harassed out of school and work. Each morning in\n\nprison, he would wait for the executioner.\n\n\"In Japan, if you are not executed between 8 a.m. and noon, you are safe till\n\nthe next day,\" Ishikawa says. \"The inmates wait, seated with their legs folded\n\nand facing the wall. Every morning, I also waited as I sat properly with my\n\nlegs folded.\"\n\nHe befriended other inmates, including Iwao Hakamada. \"The rules are stricter\n\ntoday, but then, if you survived the morning, you were allowed to visit others\n\nin their cells freely,\" he says. \"Now they can't even meet family members 4\n\ntimes removed. I hear their cells are also locked.\"\n\nThat change in policy was designed to avoid disturbing the prisoners' \"peace of\n\nmind,\" Justice Ministry officials say.\n\nIn fact, says Yoshihiro Yasuda, officials were worried inmates might attempt to\n\ncheat the executioner.\n\n\"There are no handles or bars (in their cells), nothing to allow them to hang\n\nthemselves,\" he says.\n\nHakamada was monitored day and night in a 5-square-meter cell not knowing which\n\nday might be his last. Friends say he gradually become uncommunicative, at one\n\npoint refusing all visits from his closest relatives, including his sister, for\n\nwell over a decade.\n\nJapan is 1 of 22 nations and the only developed country apart from the U.S.\n\nthat retains capital punishment. It is one of the oddities of the system that a\n\nstricken conscience can bring it grinding to a halt.\n\nSeveral justice ministers have refused to sign execution orders; Seiken\n\nSugiura, a devout Buddhist, oversaw a 15-month gallows strike in 2005-06.\n\nIn 2009, Keiko Chiba, a lifelong opponent of capital punishment, became justice\n\nminister. She was expected to begin a new moratorium. Instead, she sat ashen\n\nfaced through the hangings of Kazuo Shinozawa and Hidenori Ogata after being\n\n\"persuaded to do her duty\" by Justice Ministry bureaucrats, it was later\n\nreported. Chiba has never commented publicly about her about-face.\n\nMoratoriums are always temporary. Despite falling crime rates, death sentences\n\nare increasingly common: the number of inmates on death row has nearly tripled\n\nover the past 2 decades. The government's coalition partner, the\n\nBuddhist-backed Komeito, reportedly opposes the death penalty but does little\n\nto stop it.\n\nAccording to a rare book by Toshio Sakamoto, a former executioner, prison\n\nguards are rotated every 3 years to prevent them developing empathy with their\n\ncharges. Like the prisoners, guards are also told on the day of an order when\n\nan execution is to be carried out. 3 guards wait with hands on buttons to\n\nrelease the bound and hooded prisoner, unaware of which one has been rigged to\n\nopen the trapdoor beneath his or her feet.\n\nPrisoners sometimes defecate themselves in death. Faces can be contorted or\n\ndisfigured. Many bodies are not collected and are buried in the prison\n\ngraveyard or donated to hospitals for medical research.\n\nThe mental wear and tear on prison employees is one reason why some officials\n\nreportedly want to replace hanging with lethal injection, a claim denied by the\n\nJustice Ministry.\n\n\"There is no concrete discussion on changing the method of execution,\" a\n\nJustice Ministry spokesman says.\n\nHowever, Yasuda says switching methods would invite unwanted scrutiny of the\n\ndetails of execution.\n\nThe Justice Ministry bureaucrats who zealously protect the system, Yasuda says,\n\n\"are absolutely opposed to starting a debate on the death penalty.\"\n\n(source: Japan Times)\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nA service courtesy of Washburn University School of Law www.washburnlaw.edu\n\nDeathPenalty mailing list\n\n***@lists.washlaw.edu\n\nhttp://lists.washlaw.edu/mailman/listinfo/deathpenalty\n\nUnsubscribe: http://lists.washlaw.edu/mailman/options/deathpenalty\n\nRick Halperin\n\nJan. 18\n\nZIMBABWE:\n\nZimbabwe Faces Hangman Crisis:\n\nAt least 117 prisoners are on death row in Zimbabwe and no executions have been\n\ncarried out for the past 12 years due to the unavailability of a hangman, the\n\nConstitutional Court heard recently.\n\nZimbabweans are shunning the job.\n\nAppearing for 14 death row prisoners who are challenging the constitutionality\n\nof the death penalty despite spending lengthy periods in custody, Harare lawyer\n\nMr Tendai Biti said the number of condemned prisoners awaiting death stood at\n\n117.\n\nHe said the automatic appeals in respect of some of the inmates had not been\n\nexercised owing to delays in the transcription of court records and the\n\ndisappearance of some.\n\nHe said preparation of records was done on time only for those who paid the\n\nrequisite fees.\n\nMr Biti claimed timeframes were not being respected for condemned prisoners who\n\ndid not pay.\n\n\"The system has abandoned them.

He also renounced his Islamic faith.\n\nIn Lagos, the 'Free Ashraf Fayadh Now' campaign had the Nobel laureate leading\n\nthe charge for the freedom of the Palestinian artist residing in Saudi Arabia\n\nwho faces certain death if the world sat back and merely watched.\n\nSoyinka said the need to hold global reading for Fayadh was necessary because\n\n\"this poet is one of us.\" He condemned any form of religious practice that\n\nsentences people to death for their opinion. Soyinka wondered: \"Why should we\n\nnot be partisan on this? Religion is a personal affirmation. We should not\n\nsubscribe to any article of faith that says ours is superior to the other.

He said religion should simply be a matter of\n\nfollowership or otherwise with no one being compelled one way or the other.\n\nSoyinka who said humanism was his religion, added that it was time to uphold\n\nhumanism as the global ideal. He blamed its promoters for being too tepid and\n\nnot insisting on certain tenets of humanism that should be upheld. \"Too bad we\n\nhave not structured what we call humanism which is perhaps the problem we are\n\nhaving, which makes a minority to impose their will on the rest of us. We ought\n\nto confront the absence of humanism. We allowed the sacred texts to overwhelm\n\nour lives. Why should a bunch of mortals sit down and pass death on others.\n\nWhat kind of arrogance is that?\"\n\nThe literary giant and human rights activist also condemned what he described\n\nas the slavery and second class status of women who are confined to wearing\n\nhijab in the name of religion and called for its abrogation. He said ECOWAS\n\nHeads of government argument about the hijab is a wrong, advising that instead,\n\nthe argument should be for humanism that would not enslave women the way the\n\nhijab does.\n\nWhat we should ask is: what is human dignity? Why is that a minority imposes\n\nits own on the rest of the world? Women should be left alone to wear what they\n\nwant and not be imposed upon. It's slavery; it's subjecting women to\n\nhumiliation. We need to know what the Prophet said about it or is it an\n\nimposition? Islam has to talk to Islam to prevent interlopers like myself from\n\ntalking about it.

But that incendiary word paints a picture that does not fit\n\nthe act that cost Jack his life.\n\nJack, who openly admitted at his court martial, \"I am not a born soldier, just\n\na Bohemian journalist\", was guilty of a misdemeanour, not mutiny.\n\nOn August 28, 1916, the New Zealander, who had proved truly troublesome to Army\n\ntop brass, found himself at Number 1 Prison, Blargies, a military lock-up noted\n\nfor its toughness.\n\nThe simmering ill-feeling among inmates turned into open rebellion on that day.\n\nA tough Aussie named Private Little complained bitterly and loudly about the\n\nlack of hot water in the showers.\n\nThe matter escalated, with Little banging on tables and demanding his meal.\n\nOthers joined the insurrection, seizing the moment to air their own grievances.\n\nIt was then Jack, known as \"Bohemian Jack\" because of his artistic bent, made\n\nhis fatal mistake.\n\nIn a bid to defuse a potential riot, Jack, who was on mess duty, led furious\n\nLittle to his tent and fed him.\n\nHe had, however, taken Little from the custody of a staff sergeant. And that,\n\nin the army's book, constituted mutiny.\n\nNow, following a lobby by New Zealand historian Geoff McMillan, together with\n\nRichard Pursehouse and Lee Dent of Cannock-based Great War group The Chase\n\nProject, the trooper is to be honoured at a Staffordshire war memorial.\n\nJack's name will be included in the 'Shot at Dawn' tribute at the National\n\nMemorial Arboretum in Alrewas.\n\nCreated in 2000 by Birmingham artist Andy DeComyn, the area is a circle of 306\n\nstakes, bearing the name of men posthumously pardoned after being executed by\n\ntheir own side, surrounding a statue of a blindfolded soldier.\n\nIt is hoped Jack's stake will be installed before the centenary of his death.\n\nAt the court martial, Jack, who spent every day of active service wondering\n\nwhat he was doing amid the mud, blood and brutality of the trenches, pleaded\n\nfor his life.\n\nHe was attempting to stem trouble, he insisted, and pointed out that in Egypt,\n\nwhere he had served, such actions had been punished with 14 days imprisonment.\n\n\"I cannot understand that a simple act of peace-making could be brought to look\n\nlike deliberate mutiny,\" he protested.\n\nJack, a member of 2nd battalion Otago Regiment, also pointed out the sacrifices\n\nhis family had made for the war effort. 2 brothers had been killed in action, 2\n\nwounded and invalided back home. 2 more were training to join the fray. The\n\nBraithwaites had paid a heavy price.\n\nIn an attempt to win sympathy, Jack added to the mix the fact he was due to\n\nmarry \"the best girl in the entire world\".\n\nHe partially won over the trial's convening officer, Lieutenant-General\n\nClayton, who recommended that the sentence be commuted to 10 years penal\n\nservitude, concluding the evidence bore out the defendant's version of events.\n\nBut his recommendations were not accepted by the court. Jack and 3 Australians\n\ninvolved in the prison clash were sentenced to death by firing squad.\n\nThere is credence in claims made by Jack's family that he was a \"sacrificial\n\nlamb\".\n\nDespite being sentenced to death, the Army knew there was little chance that\n\nthe Australians would face a firing squad. The execution of any trooper from\n\nDown Under needed the approval of the Australian Governor General.\n\nAnd he did not share Allied chief Sir Douglas Haig's appetite for killing our\n\nown men.\n\nThe 3 Aussies, who all played a greater role in the near jail riot than Jack,\n\nhad their sentence commuted to 2 years hard labour.\n\nBut Haig and his cronies had to make a point, had to show that flagrant\n\ndisobedience would result in death.\n\nThat factor, plus the powder keg atmosphere at the prison and Jack's poor\n\ndisciplinary record meant clemency was not an option.\n\nHe had, after all, proved more than problematic during his stint on The Front.\n\nIn May, 1916, Jack lost his stripes for going AWOL and didn't seem to give a\n\nfig about it. He allegedly retorted: \"Let duty and soldiering go to hell.\" His\n\nonly time in the trenches, from May 14 to 22, ended ignominiously. He again\n\nwent missing from his unit, armed with a forged \"leave pass\". That earned him\n\n60 days field punishment, but by this time Jack had decided war was not for\n\nhim.\n\nHe again escaped on July 7, was caught and sentenced to 2 years hard labour.\n\nEven then, he tried to do a runner while being transferred to the British\n\nArmy's Blargies prison.\n\nJack's own family seems to have been ashamed of the reluctant trooper. His own\n\nuncle, Brigadier W. Braithwaite, urged authorities to lock up his nephew and\n\nsend him back to New Zealand as soon as possible.\n\nQuite simply, in the British Army's eyes, Jack was a coward. In reality, the\n\nman was a sensitive soul, intelligent enough to realise the madness he was\n\nimmersed in. The Bohemian had been flung into a meat grinder and wanted none of\n\nit. In all, he was court martialled 4 times.\n\nHis approach to military life is best summed up by writer Mary Vidal in a\n\nsuperb blog on the Western Front Association website.\n\nShe said: \"Poor Jack. He seems to have been somebody who was totally unsuited\n\nto become a soldier and perhaps left to himself, and without the patriotic\n\nfervour sweeping Britain and the Empire in 1915, he would not have enlisted.\n\n\"He was unable to accept military discipline and acted in a foolhardy, perhaps\n\nstupid, manner and was dealt with firmly by the authorities.\n\n\"In his final, fatal, brush with military law he found himself cast in the role\n\nof a sacrificial victim. It would seem that he was in the wrong place at the\n\nwrong time and his luck had run out. In his last hours how much he must have\n\nwished he had stayed a 'Bohemian' journalist.\"\n\nGreat War historian Ian McGibbon wrote: \"Braithwaite was foolhardy, even\n\nstupid, in his failure to take military discipline seriously and was treated\n\nfirmly by the New Zealand divisional authorities. But in his final hearing he\n\nwas more unlucky than criminal.\n\n\"But he found himself cast in the role of sacrificial victim and paid the\n\nsupreme penalty.\"\n\nIn his last, poignant written missive to the court, Jack, pinning his hopes on\n\nhis prowess as a writer, stated: \"Unfortunately I have made a serious mess of\n\nthings, and where I came to win honour and glory, I have won shame, dishonour,\n\nand everlasting disgrace.\"\n\n: He was wrong. Disgrace did not last forever.\n\nHis pardon was signed by British Secretary for Defence Des Browne in 2006.\n\nJack's tribute at the National Memorial Arboretum was secured after Geoff\n\nMcMillan, from Waikanae Beach, New Zealand, visited the site last April.\n\n\"I could only find 4 stakes for the 5 New Zealanders executed during the Great\n\nWar,\" he said.\n\n\"There was not one for Jack Braithwaite, who had been pardoned by the New\n\nZealand Government in 2000 along with the other four under the Pardon for\n\nSoldiers of the Great War Act.\"\n\nNews of Jack's honour has been welcomed by Richard Pursehouse.\n\n\"I think it's great, like picking up on something that has been missed,\" he\n\nsaid. \"I feel very humbled to have been involved.\n\n???There is no date yet, but we hope it happens before the centenary of his\n\ndeath.\n\n\"What happened was the law at the time, you had to have the ultimate deterrent.\n\nIn contrast, not a single servicemen was executed in World War II.\"\n\nBohemian Jack is buried in St Sever Cemetery, Rouen.\n\n(source: birminghammail.co.uk)\n\nMALAYSIA:\n\nCommute sentence of Altantuya's convicted murderer\n\nMalaysians Against Death Penalty and Torture (Madpet) prays that the sentence\n\nof death on Azilah Hadri, who was convicted for the murder of Altantuya\n\nShaariibuu, be commuted.\n\nIt was recently reported that former special action force officer Azilah has\n\nfiled a petition to the Selangor sultan, being the ruler of the state of\n\nSelangor, seeking a royal pardon over his conviction for the murder of the\n\nMongolian translator (The Star, Jan 15, 2016). In Malaysia, conviction for\n\nmurder carries the mandatory death penalty.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the Malaysian federal constitution provides that: 'The Yang\n\ndi-Pertuan Agong has power to grant pardons, reprieves and respites in respect\n\nof all offences which have been tried by court-martial and all offences\n\ncommitted in the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur, Labuan and Putrajaya; and\n\nthe Ruler or Yang di-Pertua Negeri of a State has power to grant pardons,\n\nreprieves and respites in respect of all other offences committed in his State.\n\nIn a reply to a parliamentary question by Member of Parliament M Kulasegaran\n\n(DAP - Ipoh Barat), dated Nov 3, 2015, it was disclosed that since 1998 until\n\nOct 6, 2015, 127 death row prisoners have had their sentence commuted. As of\n\nOct 6, 2015, there still remain about 1,022 persons on death row.\n\nIn Thailand, Royal Pardons have resulted in about 90 % or more persons\n\nsentenced to death having their sentence commuted to imprisonment.\n\nOn 18/12/2014, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted a Resolution\n\nto establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death\n\npenalty. This is the 5th time this resolution has been tabled since the first\n\nin 2007. One hundred and seventeen member states voted in favour of the 2014\n\nresolution, indicating the continuing growing global support for the abolition\n\nof the death penalty.\n\nAs such, taking also into consideration the various arguments for the abolition\n\nof the death penalty including that any miscarriage or failure of justice in\n\nthe implementation of the death penalty is irreversible and irreparable, Madpet\n\nurges the HRH the sultan of Selangor to exercise his power to commute the death\n\nsentence faced by Azilah Hadri into one of imprisonment.\n\nMadpet reiterates its urging that Malaysia abolish the death penalty.\n\nMadpet also urges a moratorium on all executions pending abolition.\n\n(source: CHARLES HECTOR is a coordinator of Malaysians Against Death Penalty\n\nand Torture (Madpet)----malaysiakini.com)\n\nEGYPT:\n\nEgypt's parliament endorses controversial anti-terrorism law\n\nEgypt's parliament on Sunday overwhelmingly endorsed a controversial\n\nanti-terrorism law that sets up special courts and shields its enforcers from\n\nlegal ramifications.\n\nThe law is one of roughly 400 that were issued by executive decree during the\n\nmore than 3 years in which Egypt was governed without a parliament after its\n\ndemocratically elected chamber was dissolved in mid-2012.\n\nIt details sentences for various terrorism-related crimes ranging from 5 years\n\nto the death penalty, and shields the military and police from legal penalties\n\nfor what it calls proportionate use of force.\n\nThe law also fines journalists for contradicting the authorities' version of\n\nany militant attack. The original draft was amended last year following a\n\ndomestic and international outcry after it initially stipulated imprisonment\n\nfor such an offence.\n\nThe newly elected legislature is constitutionally obliged to review the\n\nexecutive decrees within 15 days of its 1st session, which was on Jan. 10, and\n\neither approve or reject them.\n\nThe anti-terrorism law passed by an overwhelming 457 votes to 24 without a\n\nsingle amendment to the original decree issued by President Abdel Fattah\n\nal-Sisi last year, parliamentary sources said.\n\nEgypt's new parliament, which has 568 elected members plus another 28 appointed\n\ndirectly by the president, is dominated by the \"Support Egypt\" coalition, an\n\nalliance of over 400 MPs loyal to Sisi.\n\nHuman rights groups accuse Sisi, who as military chief deposed a freely elected\n\nIslamist president in 2013, of rolling back freedoms won in the 2011 uprising\n\nthat toppled veteran autocrat Hosni Mubarak.\n\nOpposition legislator Mohamed Salah Khalifa, a leader of the Islamist Nour\n\nParty, which holds just 12 seats after controlling about a quarter of the\n\nprevious parliament, said the law employed ambiguous wording.\n\n\"I fear that it will be used broadly when it is applied,\" he said.\n\n\"The (anti-terrorism) law was imposed during exceptional circumstances when the\n\ncountry was exposed to danger but, after these dangers subside, there should be\n\na balance between protecting the state and its institutions and preserving\n\nhuman rights.\"\n\nParliament also approved a 2014 decree on the protection of critical government\n\nfacilities. The law increases the jurisdiction of military courts, allowing\n\nthem to try civilians accused of attacking buildings and cutting off roads.\n\nEgypt, the Arab world's most populous country, is confronted by an increasingly\n\nviolent insurgency in North Sinai, where the most active militant group has\n\npledged allegiance to Islamic State. Cairo and other cities have also suffered\n\nIslamist attacks.\n\nSisi has presided over a no-holds-barred crackdown on Islamists.

The pastor, 80, was gun-butted last Thursday after armed\n\nintruders broke into his home and attempted to sexually assault his daughter\n\nbefore fleeing the scene with electronics.\n\nA day before the attack, Chief Justice Sir Hartman Longley suggested that\n\nwithout changes to existing laws, it would take a massacre similar to the\n\nCharlie Hebdo attack in Paris for the death penalty to be imposed in the\n\nBahamas.\n\nMr McCartney said the incident and the distressing statement of the top judge\n\nwere a glaring reminder of successive governments' \"lack of political will\" in\n\ndealing with the country's existing crime woes.\n\nSo far this year, 3 people have been murdered and the country saw a record\n\nbreaking 149 homicides in 2015.\n\n\"Days into the start of a new year and already more families have had to deal\n\nwith the pain of losing a loved one,\" the former Bamboo Town MP said. \"But the\n\nquestion is: How many more must die? Have we not had enough? Has crime in this\n\ncountry not already reached catastrophic proportions? Do the lives of those\n\nalready lost to us not warrant real, decisive and strong action on the part of\n\nour lawmakers? The answer is unquestionably 'yes'.\"\n\n\"The comments of the chief justice, while distressing on their own, speak to an\n\neven more important issue: a lack of political will. For years now, the\n\ngovernment has stood idly by and watched as the criminal element has grown\n\nstronger and more insidious,\" Mr McCartney said. \"This and previous\n\nadministrations have neglected to address shortfalls in the judicial system and\n\nhave interfered consistently in the work of the Royal Bahamas Police Force and\n\nnow, we are all paying the price.\"\n\nLast Wednesday, opening of the new legal year, Sir Hartman suggested that\n\n\"having regard to the prevailing jurisprudence, that the death penalty is\n\nvirtually dead.\"\n\n\"I share the view expressed by the president of the Court of Appeal. Unless we\n\nhave the experience of a Charlie Hebdo, or San Bernardino, the chances of ever\n\nimposing the death penalty under the present regime are virtually nil.\"\n\n\"The question we have to ask ourselves is do we wish to retain the death\n\npenalty, and so if this is to become a reality, my view is that a\n\nconstitutional amendment would be necessary, and not by some omnibus clause,\"\n\nSir Hartman added.\n\nThe last person executed in the Bahamas was David Mitchell in January 2000.\n\nHe was convicted of stabbing 2 German tourists to death.\n\nMitchell's execution was controversial because it was carried out while he had\n\nan appeal pending before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.\n\nInternational criticism of the move was followed by a moratorium on capital\n\npunishment, which lasted until the Privy Council's 2006 decision in the case of\n\nMaxo Tido.\n\nIn 2011, after a ruling from the London-based Privy Council, the Ingraham\n\nadministration amended the death penalty law to specify the \"worst of the\n\nworst\" murders that would warrant execution.\n\nUnder the amended law, a person who kills a police or defence force officer,\n\nmember of the Departments of Customs or Immigration, judiciary or prison\n\nservices would be eligible for a death sentence. A person would also be\n\neligible for death once convicted of murdering someone during a rape, robbery,\n\nkidnapping or act of terrorism.\n\nMr McCartney yesterday said that Bahamians \"should not be bound by senior men\n\nin England who wish to assert their beliefs against capital punishment on a\n\ncountry they have no knowledge about.\"\n\nThe DNA leader stressed that the chief justice's statement was \"clearly a\n\nchallenge to the legislative and executive arms of government; an exhortation\n\nand a call to action.\"\n\n\"For far too long, the criminal element has had the upper hand, while honest,\n\nhardworking Bahamians have been forced to live in fear,\" he added. \"If we are\n\nto reverse this trend then we cannot and must not wait for a Paris-like attack\n\nbefore we are compelled to protect our people.\"\n\n(source: Bahamas Tribune)\n\nZIMBABWE:\n\nBring finality to constitutionality of death penalty\n\nThe matter regarding the constitutionality of the death penalty and life\n\nsentences has been raging for some time now with cases of death row inmates\n\nrolling before the highest court on constitutional matters in the land.The\n\ncoming into effect of the current Constitution brings to the fore contentious\n\nlegal questions vis-a-vis the constitutionality of the death penalty.\n\nSometime in mid-October last year 2 matters initiated by legal think- tank\n\nVeritas were brought before the court. 2 applicants, convicted in separate\n\ncases of murder and sentenced to death in July 2002 and May 2012 respectively,\n\nwere challenging the legality of the death penalty in light of the new\n\nConstitution.\n\nThere was the matter of Ndhlovu versus the Minister of Justice (case CCZ50/15)\n\nand the case of Makoni versus Commissioner-General of Prisons and Correctional\n\nServices and Another (CCZ48/2015) which involved a prisoner convicted of\n\nmurdering his girlfriend in 1995. The two were convicted before the new\n\nConstitution came into operation. Veritas, therefore, cited that although the 2\n\nwere lawfully sentenced to death, the sentence now had to be set aside because\n\nof the provisions of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act (CPEA) under which\n\nthe condemned were sentenced which has since become inconsistent with Section\n\n48 of the new Constitution.\n\ncourt-gavel\n\nAccording to Section 48(2) of the new Constitution: \"A law may permit the death\n\npenalty to be imposed only on a person convicted of murder committed in\n\naggravating circumstances.\" It is in this regard that the CPEA is not in\n\nconformity with the Constitution of Zimbabwe on the imposition of the death\n\npenalty. In other words, this law, contemplated in Section 48, is not yet in\n\nexistence and therefore the death sentence cannot be passed. If this law is\n\npassed, then the death penalty can be passed under it. Otherwise, as things\n\nstand, this country cannot pass the death sentence and it thus remains\n\nimportant that finality is reached on the matter.\n\nThe recent death penalty case challenge by Chawira and 14 others versus\n\nMinister of Justice has the prisoners seeking an order that their death\n\nsentences be commuted to life imprisonment as Section 53 of the Constitution\n\nprotects everyone including convicted prisoners against torture or cruel,\n\ndegrading treatment.\n\nThey want the Constitutional Court to define their fundamental rights as\n\nenshrined in sections 51 and 53 of the national charter. They want the\n\nConstitutional Court to commute their sentences to life imprisonment and their\n\nplea is being facilitated by Veritas again. Convicted murderer Cuthbert\n\nTapuwanashe Chawira (45) and 14 other murder convicts have been languishing in\n\nprison for periods of between four and 20 years.Chawira has been on death row\n\nsince September 2000 over a 1999 armed robbery which led to a murder in Gweru.\n\nIn their affidavit they state: \"That being so because of the torture we have\n\nbeen subjected to while waiting for a long time on death row, it will be\n\nunconstitutional to execute us and therefore the sentence should now be\n\ncommitted to that of life imprisonment. The anguish of being not told the day\n\nof execution is unbearable. There is nothing as challenging to a human being as\n\nliving a life without hope. Most of us have no hope that we will live and we\n\nare just sitting in dark waiting to be executed.\"\n\nNow, the matter has stood for long and it is overwhelmingly urgent that\n\nfinality is reached. There have been 2 strong schools of thought with one group\n\nrooting for the abolition of the death penalty while others contend that those\n\nwho don't value the lives of others ought not to be spared themselves. Without\n\nwading into the contentious debate, it is in the nation's best interest that\n\nthis matter is conclusively dealt with as to settle the confusion surrounding\n\nthe matter. Undeniably, in view of the new Constitution, Zimbabwe cannot pass\n\nthe death sentence unless Parliament enacts a law which provides for it. The\n\nnew order leaves the decision to the legislature. In the absence of the\n\nspecific law providing for the death sentence, it cannot be passed.\n\nAlso, it is a valid argument that the death penalty, to a huge extent, violates\n\nSection 51 of the current Constitution which unequivocally states: \"Every\n\nperson has inherent dignity in their private and public life, and the right to\n\nhave that dignity respected and protected.\" Section 53 as well protects against\n\ncruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. The 15 death row inmates being\n\nrepresented by Tendai Biti would be right to seek the court to define their\n\nfundamental rights as espoused in both sections 51 and 53.\n\nIt is crucial that conclusiveness is reached on the matter because, honestly,\n\nthe anguish of prisoners not being told when they would be hanged is agonising.\n\nFinality, either way, it brings a sense of certainty as well as relieving\n\nprisoners of the psychological torture.

Other governments keep\n\nsaying they 'do not expect' him and the other juveniles to be executed, but\n\nwhere is the proof?\n\n\"We sincerely hope that the international community will demand the release of\n\nAbdullah and the other juveniles arrested at protests.\"\n\nMohammed al-Nimr, Ali's father and the brother of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, said his\n\nson and Mr al-Marhoon had been moved but no reason was given to explain it. He\n\nsaid the pair were \"on death row with the sword over their necks\".\n\nMaya Foa, head of Reprieve's death penalty team, said: \"It is shocking that the\n\nSaudi authorities are still threatening to execute 3 juveniles who were\n\narrested at protests, tortured into dubious 'confessions', and sentenced to\n\ndeath in flagrantly unfair trials.\n\n\"The British government and others have spoken of Saudi assurances that Ali,\n\nDawoud and Abdullah won't be killed - but this is cold comfort to the families\n\nwho are terrified of what might happen, amid a surge in Saudi executions.\"\n\nShe added: \"Governments that are close to Saudi Arabia - the UK included - must\n\nfirmly demand the release of the juveniles without delay.\"\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Today programme on Monday, David Cameron stood by\n\nBritain's relationship with Saudi Arabia in spite of growing concerns over\n\nhuman rights abuses in the kingdom.\n\n\"First of all, our relationship with Saudi Arabia is important for our own\n\nsecurity. They are opponents of Daesh [Isis] and the extremism [they spread],\"\n\nthe Prime Minister said.\n\nMr Cameron's praise for the autocracy comes days after Saudi Arabia's foreign\n\nminister Adel al-Jubeir urged Britain to \"respect\" his country's use of the\n\ndeath penalty.\n\nHe told Channel 4 News: \"With regards to the perception of Saudi Arabia among\n\nthe British public, this is a problem we need to work on.\"\n\n(source: The Independent)\n\n****************\n\n'He knew they'd kill him in the end': Son of prominent Shia cleric al-Nimr\n\nspeaks to RT\n\nMohammed al-Nimr, the son of Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, executed in Saudi\n\nArabia in the beginning of the year, has told RT how his father fought for the\n\nrights of \"all the people\" while having been allegedly tortured after his\n\narrest by Riyadh.\n\n\"He spoke for all the people, he didn't speak only for the Shia [community]. He\n\nasked the [Saudi] government to release all political prisoners. They got mad\n\nbecause he defended everyone who was oppressed by this government,\" Mohammed\n\nal-Nimr said, adding that many people looked up to his father when he started\n\ntalking about human rights.\n\n\"That is one of the main things that they [Riyadh] didn't like about him,\" the\n\ncleric's son said.\n\nNimr al-Nimr, described by his son as an \"honest and a gentle man,\" was a\n\nstaunch critic of the Saudi leadership. The cleric, who called for the\n\nself-rule of the Saudi Shia population, was among 47 people executed in Saudi\n\nArabia at the start of the year on terrorism charges. The execution sparked not\n\nonly a strong reaction in the Middle East, but also an international outcry.\n\nHundreds of activists took to the streets of New York on Sunday, gathering in\n\nTimes Square for an anti-Saudi rally. Protesters called for peace among the\n\ndifferent branches of Islam, while condemning what they say is Saudi oppression\n\nof the Shias.\n\n\"Most people who know about my father will act in a human way. They are\n\nsincere. They're seeing the truth, what is really going on,\" Mohammed al-Nimr\n\ntold RT, adding that while \"political activists and politicians... are aware of\n\nwhat is going on [in Saudi Arabia], the media here is not focusing on human\n\nrights very much.\"\n\nRiyadh acts as if it is still living in the 20th century, the son of the Shia\n\ncleric said.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia still thinks it's 1980 and there is no internet, there is no\n\ninternational news. It's like they are living in a small box, but the whole\n\nworld is watching what is going on there. They are the only ones not seeing\n\nwhat is going on outside that box,\" he said, adding that while Riyadh's leaders\n\nare \"trying to prove themselves\" to be a strong government by showing people \"a\n\nstrong fist,\" they have no right to do so \"by killing their people.\"\n\nThe Saudi foreign minister, when warning other countries against intervening in\n\nthe Kingdom's affairs, has said the death penalty is part of Saudi law.\n\nSheikh Nimr al-Nimr's son also told RT about how violently his father had been\n\narrested and then treated while having been captured by the Saudis.\n\n\"He told us exactly how he was arrested. He was driving his car and they\n\nfollowed him, they bashed his car from behind, so the car hit a wall. Then they\n\nwent to his car and pulled him out. His seatbelt was on. The policemen pulled\n\nhim out of the car very roughly. Even the buckle of his seatbelt came out of\n\nthe car. They shot him at close range 4 times, hitting his leg. He was not\n\narmed,\" Mohammed al-Nimr said.\n\nFollowing the man's arrest, he wasn't given proper treatment for his injuries,\n\nhis son said, adding that because his father had been deprived of sufficient\n\npain medication, \"he couldn???t sleep for basically 1 year\" suffering from\n\npain.\n\n\"He was tied with 6 chains to his bed, even though he couldn't walk. They left\n\n1 bullet in intentionally so it would stay in his thigh and bother him all the\n\ntime,\" Mohammed al-Nimr said. After the man's execution, his family was not\n\ngiven the body for a proper burial, but it was instead hidden by the Saudis,\n\nhis son said.\n\n\"He didn't back out. He didn't change his opinion. He kept asking for justice.\n\nMy father knew that they would kill him in the end. And he said that many\n\ntimes: 'Our blood is a cheap price to pay for our beliefs',\" Mohammed al-Nimr\n\ntold RT.\n\n(source: rt.com)\n\nNIGERIA:\n\nReps Minority Whip canvasses death penalty, amputation for corrupt\n\nofficials----Barde said: \"We live in a funny country, where people steal N1,000\n\nand they are put in jail for years, while some other people will steal billions\n\nof naira and use that same billions to escape justice\n\nThe Minority Whip in the House of Representatives, Danjuma Barde, on Monday\n\ncalled for imposition of capital punishment on corrupt public officers in the\n\ncountry.\n\nThe legislator spoke at a media forum in Kaduna organised by the Kaduna State\n\nchapter of the Correspondent's Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists.\n\nBarde said: \"We live in a funny country, where people steal N1,000 and they are\n\nput in jail for years, while some other people will steal billions of naira and\n\nuse that same billions to escape justice. \"If somebody steal from N1 million to\n\nN100 million, they should cut his hand and those who steal from N1 billion\n\nabove should be hanged.\"\n\nThe lawmaker said he was discussing with other members of the House to provide\n\nfor the setting up of special courts to handle corruption cases and stiffer\n\npenalties for those convicted.\n\nBarde, a 3-time member of the House representing Chikun Federal Constituency,\n\nsaid the special courts would speed up the prosecution of those charged with\n\ncorruption.\n\nHe said: \"I am a believer of the fact that people should be punished for their\n\ncrimes, no matter how highly placed they are in the society.\n\n\"I also believe that punishment should be segregated such that it should be\n\ncommensurable to the crime and be punished according to the amount of money\n\nthey steal.\n\n\"I have started discussions with some of my colleague members of the National\n\nAssembly on the need to set up a special and dedicated court to try these kind\n\nof people so that justice will be dispensed off quickly.\"\n\nAccording to Barde, stiffer punishment like cutting-off of the arm of a\n\nconvicted person or death sentence will deter other public office holders and\n\nindividuals.\n\nHe said: \"If am a Judge and such case or person is brought before me, I will\n\nmake sure I confiscate his property and sentence him to death.\"\n\nHe noted that some corrupt public officers were exploiting the loopholes in the\n\nnation's legal system to delay justice.\n\nBarde said: \"Some former governors have cases with the EFCC and the ICPC for\n\nthe last 8 years without appearing in court even once.\n\n\"There are other corruption cases against some public office holders still\n\npending in the conventional courts and justice is being delayed as some of them\n\neven die and leave such cases pending in courts.\n\n\"But if the Government establishes a special court to specifically prosecute\n\nthose corruption cases, it would speed up justice and that would send a warning\n\nto people with tendencies of corrupt practices to change their minds.\"\n\nBarde, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, commended President Muhammadu\n\nBuhari for the measures taken so far in the fight against corruption in the\n\ncountry.\n\nThe legislator, however, urged the administration to respect the rule of law\n\nand allow those on bail enjoy their freedom pending the determination of cases\n\nagainst them.\n\nBarde said Nigerians must take bold steps to eradicate corruption by supporting\n\nongoing efforts of government to eliminate the scourge.\n\nHe said: \"Corruption, hunger or poverty does not know party, tribe or religion.\n\n\"We know how Nigerians are suffering, so there should be no sympathy for such\n\npersons who are involved in such acts.\"\n\n(source: theeagleonline.com.ng)\n\nIRAN:\n\n52 executions in first 2 weeks of January ---- The religious fascism ruling\n\nIran increases hangings concurrent with the implementation of the nuclear deal\n\non the verge of sham elections\n\nThe antihuman Iranian regime that closed its infamous dossier for 2015 with\n\nover 1,000 executions has begun the New Year by ramping up executions\n\nthroughout the country such that in just the first 2 weeks of this year 52\n\nexecutions have been registered. The forced retreat from the nuclear bomb and\n\nthe implementation of the nuclear deal with the P5+1, the upcoming elections\n\nfor the Assembly of Experts and the parliament, and the intensification of the\n\npower struggle within regime's factions have tightened the noose around the\n\nregime's neck.\n\nTo confront these crises, the Iranian regime is planning to increase its death\n\nsentences and climate of terror in the society to thwart the expansion of\n\npopular protests and the explosion of popular wrath. Since the beginning of\n\nJanuary to this day, the clerical regime has executed 52 prisoners, including 1\n\nwoman, in various cities. Four of the prisoners have been hanged in public and\n\nmost prisoners were executed in groups.\n\nOn January 16, 4 prisoners were hanged in Rasht's central prison and on January\n\n14 1 prisoner was hanged in Yazd's central prison.\n\nOn the previous day, there was a group hanging of 6 prisoners in Urmia prison\n\nand 1 prisoner was executed in Shiraz prison.\n\nOn January 12, 4 prisoners were collectively hanged in Karaj's Central Prison\n\nand another prisoner was executed in Zanjan.\n\nOn January 11, 3 prisoners were hanged in Sari prison and 1 was hanged in\n\nMashhad prison.\n\nOn January 9 and 10, 2 prisoners were hanged in Rasht's central prison, 3 were\n\nexecuted in Larestan (Fars Province), and 1 prisoner was hanged in Khorramabad\n\nprison.\n\nOn January 7, 2 young men were hanged in public in Shabestar and Khoy, 3\n\nprisoners were sent to the gallows in Ardabil's central prison, and 1 prisoner\n\nwas executed in Hamadan's central prison.\n\nOn January 6 there were 13 executions; 5 prisoners in Gohardasht (Rajai Shahr)\n\nPrison, 3 in Karaj Central Prison, and 5 prisoners, including a woman, in\n\nTabriz central prison.\n\nFrom January 2 to 5, 5 prisoners were executed in prisons in Noshahr,\n\nKhorramabad and Urmia and 1 prisoner was hanged in public in the town of Sourak\n\nMiandoroud in Mazandaran Province.\n\n************************\n\nWaves of executions in Iran condemned in the Netherlands\n\nSupporters of the Iranian Resistance staged 2 rallies on Saturday, January 16\n\nin downtown Amsterdam and outside the Dutch Parliament in The Hague condemning\n\ngross human rights violations in Iran, especially mass executions by the\n\nIranian regime.\n\nParticipants in these rallies also called on the major world powers to set\n\naside the appeasement policy vis-???-vis the \"godfather of terrorism\" in Iran.\n\nThese protesters also called for practical measures by the international\n\ncommunity in condemning the practice of executions and torture in Iran, and\n\nplacing senior Iranian regime officials before international tribunals.\n\nThe placards raised by the protesters read in part that the mullahs' president\n\nHassan Rouhani is the president of 2,000 executions and any rapprochement with\n\nthe Iranian regime must be contingent upon on the termination of executions in\n\nIran.\n\nIn the first 16 days of January, the mullahs' inhumane regime in Iran has sent\n\n53 prisoners, including 1 woman, to the gallows in various towns. 4 of these\n\nprisoners were hanged in public and most of the prisoners were executed in\n\ngroups.\n\nThe human rights situation has been deteriorating rapidly in Iran. More than\n\n2,000 individuals have been executed during Hassan Rouhani's tenure as\n\nPresident of the regime.

Based on\n\nthe quantities said to have been recovered, they will \"inevitably\" have been\n\nsentenced to death under the Iranian penal code, Reprieve said.\n\nThe concern is compounded by widespread corruption in the Iranian justice\n\nsystem. According to the Foreign Office's own assessment, Iranian judges are\n\naccused of handing down convictions \"almost exclusively\" on the testimony of\n\nthe police and \"rarely considered evidence offered by the defence\".\n\nThe project's funding has included $2.4m from the EU's foreign aid fund, while\n\nin total EU has $171m committed in total to the agency's funding.\n\nBritain counts a share of spending by the EU - around 800 million pounds a year\n\n- towards its foreign aid target of spending 0.7 % of GDP on aid per year.\n\nExecutions in Iran markedly increased last year to more than 830 up to\n\nNovember, the highest per capita rate in the world, with the vast majority for\n\ndrug offences. Blasphemy, adultery and homosexuality are also capital offences.\n\nPresident Rouhani has justified the dramatic increase. \"If we abolished the\n\ndeath penalty we would enhance their drug trafficking up to the European\n\ncountries and that would be dangerous for you,\" he told an Italian newspaper.\n\nDan Dolan, of Reprieve, said the UN had shown a \"complete disregard\" for human\n\nrights by assisting the Iranians, and called for a full review of the EU's\n\nsupport for the programme.\n\n\"Iran's execution rate has skyrocketed, with hundreds sent to the gallows on\n\ndrugs charges following trials that make a mockery of justice. The EU has no\n\nlegitimate defence for supporting this, and it should reject the absurd claim\n\nby Iran's President Rouhani that these executions are somehow in Europe's\n\ninterests.\n\n\"If the EU is to maintain any credibility in opposing the death penalty it\n\nshould end this grievous misuse of taxpayers' money.\"\n\nThe UNODC did not comment on Reprieve's warnings, but said it \"opposes the\n\ndeath penalty in all circumstances\".\n\n\"Under international law, if the death penalty is to be used at all, it should\n\nonly be imposed for the most serious crimes, namely those involving intentional\n\nkilling, and only with appropriate safeguards. Drug-related offences generally\n\nare not considered to fall under the category of 'most serious crimes.'\"\n\nAn EU spokesman said the focus of the programme was stopping drugs from\n\nAfghanistan reaching Europe. They denied there was a risk of aiding the Iranian\n\nregime carry out executions.\n\n\"The ultimate objective is to keep dangerous illegal drugs off our streets and\n\nit does so in a way that respects human rights, as any EU projects do. All EU\n\nprojects are prepared against a risk assessment methodology ensuring that EU\n\nfunding do not facilitate death sentences in countries where it is enforced.\n\nThis has obviously been the case with this project.\n\n\"The EU is opposed to the death penalty the world over and consistently calls\n\non all states which apply capital punishment to halt all pending executions and\n\nintroduce a moratorium on the death penalty.\"\n\n(source: The Telegraph)\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nA service courtesy of Washburn University School of Law www.washburnlaw.edu\n\nDeathPenalty mailing list\n\n***@lists.washlaw.edu\n\nhttp://lists.washlaw.edu/mailman/listinfo/deathpenalty\n\nUnsubscribe: http://lists.washlaw.edu/mailman/options/deathpenalty\n\nRick Halperin\n\nJan. 20\n\nZAMBIA:\n\nScrap death sentence - UNZA don\n\nA lecturer in the School of Law at the University of Zambia, Landilani Banda,\n\nsays death sentence is \"state-sanctioned murder\" and must thus be abolished.\n\nMr Banda says there is no legal, political or religious justification for\n\nmaintaining the death penalty in the laws of the country.\n\nMr Banda said yesterday when he appeared before the Parliamentary Committee on\n\nLegal Affairs, Governance, Human Rights, Gender Matters and Child Affairs, that\n\nhas been receiving views on whether the death penalty should be abolished or\n\nnot.\n\n\"There is no valid reason to maintain death sentence in the statutes of Zambia.\n\nBeing on death row alone causes so much anguish and suffering to the convict\n\nthat most of them actually die on death row,\" Mr Banda said.\n\nHe contended that death sentence has not acted as a deterrent to would-be\n\noffenders and it is, therefore, only logical that it is scraped.\n\n\"Death penalty is retrogression to the right of life.

But none of the\n\nverdicts have retained it. We will decide later whether we will appeal after\n\nevaluating the verdicts.\"\n\nThe case will now go to the chief justice following the rules. The chief\n\njustice will then assign a new bench to settle it.\n\nAccording to the case details, RAB and Coastguard had conducted a joint\n\noperation on Dec 1, 2006, on Pashur River in Bagerhat to nab a gang of robbers.\n\nFollowing a shootout between the 2 parties, the security personnel managed to\n\ncorner the robbers' vessel and board it.\n\nSome of the robbers dived into the river with Coastguard personnel MH Kabir and\n\nMA Islam and RAB personnel PC Kanchan after a scuffle broke out on the boat.\n\nThe bodies of the 3 men were recovered from the river over the next few days.\n\nRAB later filed the murder case against several unknown people. Mongla police\n\nsubmitted the chargesheet in May 2007 accusing 15 people.\n\nThe Bagerhat court then in August 2014 delivered the verdict based on\n\nstatements from 11 state witnesses.\n\nThose awarded death sentences were Rafiqul Sheikh, Quddus Sheikh, Idris Sheikh,\n\nBabul Sheikh, Alkas Fakir and Elias Sheikh.\n\nThose awarded life sentences were Akram Sheikh, Alam Sheikh, Badshah Sheikh,\n\nJamal Sheikh, Kamal alias Suman Sheikh, Reazul Sheikh and Aslam Sheikh.\n\nOf them, Elias was the one who appealed against the maximum punishment. He is\n\nalso the only one convict behind bars. The rest are still on the run, said\n\nDeputy Attorney General Moniruzzaman Rubel.\n\n(source: bdnews24.com)\n\n****************\n\nHefazat leaders sign fatwa against militancy\n\nSeveral top leaders of radical Islamist platform Hefazat-e-Islam and teachers\n\nof its Hathazari Madrasa in Chittagong have signed on to an initiative of\n\n100,000 clerics issuing a fatwa against militancy.\n\nFatwa committee chief Maulana Md Fariduddin Masud, also the Imam of Sholakia\n\nMosque, said that they had already collected around 15,000 signatures since\n\nJanuary 2. He said that they would also collect signatures of scholars engaged\n\nwith various political parties.\n\n12 Hefazat leaders including its Secretary General Junaid Babunagari and some\n\nteachers including chief mufti Abdus Salam of Al-Jamiatul Ahlia Darul Ulum\n\nMoinul Islam, also known as Hathazari Madrasa, signed the fatwa recently,\n\nsources said.\n\nThe platform's organising secretary, however, alleged that Maulana Masud had\n\ncollected their signatures tactfully. Maulana Azizul Huq Islamabadi said that\n\nHefazat had always been vocal against militancy.\n\n\"Maulana Masud tactfully collected signatures from the Hefazat leaders during\n\nthe Ijtema. He did not make it clear that it was part of his campaign,\" he\n\nalleged.\n\nQawmi madrasa-based Hefazat came to limelight in 2013 by placing their 13-point\n\ndemands that include the formulation of anti-blasphemy law after youths\n\nlaunched an unprecedented movement at Shahbagh demanding death penalty for all\n\nwar criminals, most of who are from Jamaat-e-Islami. Hefazat leaders also\n\ntermed the incumbent government a patroniser of atheists.\n\nSince the Hefazat movement, over a dozen secular activists, writers, publishers\n\nand teachers were attacked - many of them killed - by religious extremists and\n\nmilitant groups.\n\nAt a recent Islamic conference in Chittagong, Hefazat chief Shah Ahmed Shafi\n\nsaid they were also against militancy and violence, but that their fight\n\nagainst the atheists would continue.\n\nThe anti-militancy fatwa involving 11 questions explains the relevant verses of\n\nthe Qur'an and the Hadiths to discourage extremism and militant activities in\n\nthe country.\n\nSome 500 scholars present at Jamia Ikra of Khilgaon signed the fatwa on the\n\ninaugural day. The organisers will take signatures from female scholars too.\n\nMaulana Masud hoped that they would be able to complete collecting the\n\nsignatures by February. They had sent letters to all mosques, madrasas and\n\nreligion-based political parties urging them sign the fatwa, which would be\n\nsent to the president of the state, the prime minister, the chief justice, the\n\nOrganisation of Islamic Cooperation and the United Nations among others.\n\nMaulana Masud alleged that Jamaat-Shibir had instigated militancy in the\n\ncountry. A 7-member committee is working to collect the signatures.\n\nThe initiative was taken after the police chief held series of meetings with\n\nIslamic scholars in December where they discussed ways to combat militant\n\nactivities. A similar fatwa was issued by 1,000 Islamic scholars of India which\n\nsays Islam is against terrorism, but Islamic State militant group is inciting\n\nterrorism.\n\nAlso the secretary general of Jamaat-e-Ulema, Maulana Masud said they were\n\ntrying to collect signatures from all Muslim scholars including Shia, Sunni or\n\nAhle Hadith followers.\n\n\"Islam does not support terrorism and militancy. Provoked by an international\n\ngroup, a certain quarter in the country is trying to encourage the youths in\n\nmilitant activities. If we can collect the signatures of 1,00,000 scholars, the\n\nworld will know that Islam has nothing to do with militancy. It will also\n\nimprove the image of the country,\" he said.\n\n(source: dhakatribune.com)\n\nINDONESIA:\n\nCoalition of human right groups ask Indonesian government to end unjust use of\n\nthe death penalty\n\nThe Indonesian government's decision to execute eight individuals for\n\ndrug-related crimes last April led to condemnation of our country from\n\ngovernments and human rights advocates from around the world. Despite insisting\n\nat the time that the executions were essential to fighting a growing \"drug\n\ncrisis\" in the country, government officials later said they would be focusing\n\non improving the country's economy before moving forward with more executions.\n\nRecently, however, government officials have backtracked once again, indicating\n\nthat they would continue to carry out executions this year.\n\nIn an open letter released on Monday and addressed to Minister for Politics,\n\nLaw and Security Affairs Lahut Panjaitan, numerous human rights and justice\n\nadvocacy groups - including Amnesty International, the Community Legal Aid\n\nInstitute (LBH) and KontraS (the Commission for the Disappeared and Victims of\n\nViolence) - criticise the government's decision to backtrack once again on\n\ntheir death penalty policy. They refer specifically to Attorney General M\n\nPrasetyo's statements in December that executions will resume in 2016.\n\nThe letter asks that the government put an end to executions, arguing that\n\nthere are \"systemic flaws in the administration of justice in Indonesia\" and\n\n\"violations of fair trial\" that amount to government-endorsed human rights\n\nviolations.\n\nMany such violations of justice are noted in the letter, include not providing\n\nproper legal assistance to death row prisoners and the improper application of\n\nthe death penalty to individuals who may have mental illnesses or be underage.\n\nIt also notes that drug offenses do not rise to the threshold of serious crimes\n\ndeserving of the death penalty as defined by the 1976 International Covenant on\n\nCivil and Political Rights, in which Indonesia is a signatory.\n\nThe letter's cosigners argue that only remedy to these injustices would be for\n\nIndonesia to place a moratorium on further executions and to establish an\n\nindependent body to monitor the human rights of prisoners and ensure they\n\nreceive a fair trial.\n\nYou can read the full text of the open letter below or on the website of the\n\nLBH Masyarakarat (Community Legal Aid Institute):\n\nMr. Luhut Panjaitan,\n\nCoordinating Minister for Politics, Law and Security Affairs\n\nCoordinating Ministry for Politics, Law and Security Affairs\n\nJl. Merdeka Barat No. 15,\n\nJakarta Pusat 10110\n\nIndonesia\n\n18 January 2016\n\nDear Minister,\n\nIndonesia's authorities must end executions and abolish the death penalty\n\nWe are writing to you on the issue of the application of the death penalty in\n\nIndonesia. It has been a year since your administration resumed executions in\n\nIndonesia on 18 January 2015, after a 4 year hiatus, despite strong protests\n\nfrom human rights organizations and the international community.\n\nOur organizations are concerned despite your public announcement in November\n\n2015 that Indonesia government would suspend any executions in near future the\n\nAttorney General has recently announced that further executions will be carried\n\nout in 2016. As there continues to be serious concerns about violations of fair\n\ntrial and other human rights in the use of the death penalty in Indonesia we\n\nask for your immediate intervention to address these issues. In particular, we\n\nurge you to ensure all death sentences are reviewed by an independent and\n\nimpartial body, with a view to their commutation.\n\nResearch findings by the National Commission on Human Rights (Komisi Nasional\n\nHak Asasi Manusia, Komnas HAM)[3] and additional independent research carried\n\nout by Amnesty International, ICJR (Institute for Criminal Justice Reform), and\n\nother human rights organizations, point to systemic flaws in the administration\n\nof justice in Indonesia and violation of fair trial and other international\n\nsafeguards that must be strictly observed in all death penalty cases:\n\nDefendants in the cases under analysis did not have access to legal counsel\n\nfrom the time of arrest and at different stages of their trial and appeals;\n\nthey were subjected to ill-treatment while in police custody to make them\n\n\"confess\" to their alleged crimes or sign police investigation reports.\n\nPrisoners were brought before a judge for the first time when their trials\n\nbegan, months after their arrest.\n\nIn several cases involving foreign nationals, particularly those convicted of\n\ndrug-related offences, the authorities failed to correctly identify or verify\n\nthe identity of the prisoner and notify relevant country representations of the\n\narrest. The authorities also failed to provide translation and interpretation\n\nto those prisoners who could not understand Bahasa, whether they were\n\nforeigners or Indonesian nationals.\n\nThe death penalty continued to be used extensively for drug-related offences,\n\neven though these offences do not meet the threshold of the \"most serious\n\ncrimes\", the only category of crimes for which the death penalty can be imposed\n\nunder the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which\n\nIndonesia is a state party, pending its abolition.\n\nIn addition, despite the clear prohibition under international law concerning\n\nthe use of the death penalty against persons who were below 18 years of age or\n\nhave a mental or intellectual disability, credible claims put forward by\n\nprisoners in relation to their age and mental illness were not adequately\n\ninvestigated by the authorities and have resulted in the unlawful imposition of\n\nthe death penalty and, in at least 1 case, execution. While Indonesian law\n\nrequires that all births be registered, in practice many people do not undergo\n\nthis process, making the determination of one's age particularly challenging.\n\nThis, coupled with a lack of legal assistance, increases the risk that persons\n\nwho were below 18 when the crime was committed are exposed to the death\n\npenalty. Additionally, defendants and prisoners are not regularly and\n\nindependently assessed, which can result in mental disabilities remaining\n\nundiagnosed and prisoners not being afforded the care and treatment they might\n\nneed.\n\nResearch findings also show that in some cases prisoners did not receive legal\n\nassistance when appealing against their conviction or sentence, or did not even\n\nsubmit an appeal application because they were not informed by their lawyers of\n\ntheir right to do so. Furthermore, the execution of some death row prisoners\n\nwent ahead even though the Indonesian courts had accepted to hear their\n\nappeals. The announcement by President Joko Widodo in December 2014 and\n\nFebruary 2015 that he would not grant clemency to any individuals convicted of\n\nand sentenced to death for drug-related crimes and information relating to some\n\nclemency rejections cast doubts on the meaningful exercise of the President's\n\nconstitutional power to grant clemency and the country's compliance with the\n\nICCPR.\n\nAs of today, 140 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. 3 more\n\ncountries - Fiji, Madagascar and Suriname- became abolitionist for all crimes\n\nin 2015 alone and the Parliament of Mongolia adopted a new Criminal Code at the\n\nend of last year, removing the death penalty as possible form of punishment\n\nunder the laws of the country. The resumption of executions in Indonesia have\n\nnot only set the country against its international obligations, but also\n\nagainst the global trend towards abolition of the ultimate cruel, inhuman and\n\ndegrading punishment.\n\nOur organizations reiterate our calls on the government of Indonesia to\n\nestablish a moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolition of the\n\ndeath penalty. Pending full abolition, we urge you to i"
