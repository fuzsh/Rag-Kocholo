DoDAAD supports business application systems data and interoperability requirements, including (but not limited to) supply chain, materiel management, distribution, transportation, maintenance, finance, contracting, procurement, and acquisition systems. DoDAAD information is used throughout the federal supply system for identification, requisitioning, shipping, billing, and other uses. NOTE: For purposes of this SOP, use of the term “Services” throughout the remainder of this document is meant to include all Departments of the Federal Government, to include both the DoD Components as well as Federal Agencies, unless otherwise specifically stated (e.g., State and Local Governments).\n\nDoDAAD Key Information\n\nCommercial Company DoDAACs\n\nAll commercial companies who have a DoDAAC related question must contact their government Contracting Officer to submit requests to create, update, or delete a DoDAAC.
