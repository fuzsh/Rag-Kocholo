        "text": "Collective Bargaining Agreement Database\n\nOPM, under its own statutory and regulatory authority, requires agencies submit to OPM, within 10 days of issuance, any arbitration awards under 5 U.S.C. ยง7121(e ) and (f) relating to actions taken under Chapter 43 and Chapter 75, United States Code, for analysis in accordance with OPM's authority under 5 U.S.C ยง7703(d). OPM also requires that other arbitration awards must be submitted within 30 days of issuance. Agencies should also provide OPM with copies of collective-bargaining agreements. This promotes transparency by allowing the public to view the types of agreements reached between agencies and Federal sector unions.\n\nThe CBAs found on this database were submitted to OPM by executive departments and agencies and may not contain all existing CBAs in the Executive Branch. OPM will regularly update this database as existing and new CBAs are provided to OPM.\n\nSubmitting Documents\n\nAgency labor relations staff, or other appropriate personnel, may register as a user and submit CBAs and arbitration awards through OPM's Labor Relations Document Submission Portal. Once approved, agency users may submit CBAs and arbitration awards directly through this application. CBAs should not include any signatures, individual names, or other personal identifiers. Agencies may simply remove the signature page from CBAs or redact individual signatures, names, and other personal identifiers from the CBAs. Please note that all CBAs must be submitted in a Portable Document Format (PDF) file format that conforms with the standards of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. ยง 794 (d) and 36 CFR Part 1194). Arbitration awards do not require Section 508 conformance or redaction but must be in a searchable format. To register for the first time as an agency user, please go to the user registration page.\n\nIf you have any questions about submitting CBAs and arbitration awards, please contact OPM's Accountability and Workforce Relations staff at LRG@opm.gov. For questions related to specific CBAs found on this database, please contact the agency associated with that CBA. For information on representational data on all bargaining units certified by the Federal Labor Relations Authority, including the name, description, location, bargaining unit employee population, and other information, please visit the Federal Labor Management Information System."
