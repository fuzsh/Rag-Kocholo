The funding was designated for a âcharacterizationâ study to determine whether a river basin near the Two Elk Energy Park in northeast Wyoming had potential as an underground site for carbon storage. However, as WyoFile has extensively documented, the project appears, at best, to have been a questionable use of taxpayer dollars. The project created zero jobs, according to Recovery.gov, and many of the studyâs primary components, including the drilling of a deep âcharacterization well,â were never completed â or even formally initiated. Records show nearly $3 million in dubious invoices from North American Land & Livestock, a company managed by NAPG CEO Michael Ruffatto. Federal records also reveal that at least $1.1 million in stimulus funding went toward paying the salaries and benefits of two NAPG employees: Ruffatto and Wyoming representative Brad Enzi, the son of U.S. Senator Mike Enzi (R., Wyo.). Ruffatto was reportedly compensated with taxpayer funds at a rate exceeding $500,000 a year, while Enzi earned nearly $130,000 for his work on the project between September 2009 and July 2011, at a rate of about $80 per hour. Ruffatto received more than $73,000 in salary and benefits in October 2010 alone, after he reported working 76 hours per week on the project, in addition to his other responsibilities as NAPG chief executive. Enzi earned as much as $17,363 in one month.\" In \"Surprise: Stimulus Money Misspent,\" by Andrew Stiles, NRO, April 2013.\n\nAddendum of the Old Woman Who Lives in a Millionaire's Mansion: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Sunday that President Obama shouldn't negotiate over the debt ceiling because there are 'no more cuts to make. Because the cupboard is bare. There's no more cuts to make,' Pelosi said on CNN's 'State of the Union.' 'It's really important that people understand that. We all want to reduce the deficit.' Pelosi said that whether and how to raise the debt ceiling 'really shouldn't be a conversation'.\" In \"Pelosi: âThereâs no more cuts to makeâ,\" by Aaron Blake, Washington Post, 22 September 2013.\n\nSee: The cupboard was bare - it bares, repeating, and Senator Crooked and Congressman Hoax , and also Fat cats richly rich of late\n\nDoctor Oppression comes to call\n\n\"The ED 691E core includes a minimum of four weekend seminars selected from the following seven choices: Ableism, Anti-Semitism, Religious Oppression, Classism, Transgender oppression, Heterosexism, Racism and Sexism.\" In \"The Doctoral Program in Social Justice Education\" web page for the School of Education, Social Justice Education, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 2009.

Bell (1930-2011), in \"Ethical Ambition: Living a Life of Meaning and Worth,\" (2002)\n\nAddendum of So-Shall Just-Is: \"The phrase has taken on a very controverted and variable meaning, depending on who is using it.\" Wikipedia article on Social Justice, n. d.\n\nAddendum of Socialism in Disguise: \"All this profit-sharing and welfare work and insurance and old-age pension is simply poppycock. Enfeebles a workman's independence--and wastes a lot of honest profit. The half-baked thinker that isn't dry behind the ears yet, and these suffragettes and God knows what all buttinskis there are that are trying to tell a business man how to run his business, and some of these college professors are just about as bad, the whole kit and bilin' of 'em are nothing in God's world but socialism in disguise!\" In \"Main Street,\" by Sinclair Lewis, 1920.\n\nAddendum of Studying Themselves: \"Undergraduates today can select from a swathe of identity studies.... The shortcoming of all these para-academic programs is not that they concentrate on a given ethnic or geographical minority; it is that they encourage members of that minority to study themselves - thereby simultaneously negating the goals of a liberal education and reinforcing the sectarian and ghetto mentalities they purport to undermine.\" Tony Judt, The Memory Chalet, Penguin, 2010.\n\nAddendum of Underfunded Pensions: \"A majority of states' teacher retirement funds are underfunded, some significantly below rates considered solvent, according to a recent analysis by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and policy group that seeks to improve the quality of teachers. The situation has stoked political fights in statehouses across the country as legislators weigh options such as moving teachers from a traditional defined benefit pension to a 401(k)-style plan, raising the retirement age or making teachers wait a decade to be vested in their plans. The shortfalls are reflective of what's happening with public state and local pensions nationwide, with teacher pensions included in a more than $660 billion shortfall in what's been put aside for such retirement benefits and what is owed, the Pew Center on the States has estimated.\" In \"Teacher Pension Funds Largely Underfunded, Study says,\" by Kimberly Hefling, Huffington Post, 15 March 2012. [ 2 ]\n\nAddendum of a Doctor of Oppression: \"This is one of the LGBT communityâs worst nightmares. On Monday, June 17, a gay manâWalter Lee Williamsâwas put on the FBIâs Top 10 Most Wanted List and declared 'dangerous' for allegedly engaging in sexual conduct with minors and producing child pornography. After years of scientific studies and anecdotal experience finally putting to rest the horrid myth that homosexuality is in any way associated with child molestation, on April 30, a four-count federal warrant was issued for Williams, a former professor of anthropology, gender studies and history at USC and the man most responsible for bringing the ONE Gay & Lesbian Archives to USC 'for sexual exploitation of children, travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places and criminal forfeiture'.\" In \"FBI Puts Gay Former USC Professor Walter L. Williams on Top 10 Most Wanted List,\" by Karen Ocamb, FrontiersLA, 18 June 2013. [ 3 ]\n\nAddendum of Inequality: \"Hard times could still be ahead for the current college students about to select a major. This report reconfirms a harsh reality: not all college degrees are created equal. Specific fields and the higher technical skills associated with these fields can and often do offer lower unemployment and higher earnings....\" In \"Hard Times, College Majors, Unemployment and Earnings,\" by Anthony P. Carevale and Ban Cheah, Georgetown University Public Policy Institute, 2013. [ 4 ]\n\nAddendum of the New Aristocrats: \"I think of one academic couple I know, of whom I am very fond, and whose contributions to teaching and scholarship and left-wing activism are exemplary. I donât begrudge them their gorgeous home with the expansive deck overlooking mountains and ocean; I donât begrudge one of them for letting slipâwe all have moments of hubrisâthat they make $400,000 between them. I donât begrudge another such couple the fancy catered dinner parties theyâre able to throw in their fancy home, because, hell, I was the guest of honor at one of those dinner parties. In fact, Iâve been the guest of honor, as a visiting independent scholar, at fancy dinners at all sorts of fancy universities, and am invariably fond of my hosts, for the most part decent, dedicated people: 1960s veterans, mainly, whoâve done their best to keep their values intact. But hereâs their problemâa tragic flaw. Theyâre hardly aware that theyâre aristocrats, and that they oversee an army of intellectual serfs. Because no one saw this coming.\" In \"On the Death of Democratic Higher Education,\" by Rick Perlstein, The Nation, 21 August 2013. [ 5 ]\n\nMemorial for a Teacher: \"As amazing as it sounds, Margaret Mary, a 25-year professor, was not making ends meet. Even during the best of times, when she was teaching three classes a semester and two during the summer, she was not even clearing $25,000 a year, and she received absolutely no health care benefits. Compare this with the salary of Duquesne's president, who makes more than $700,000 with full benefits. Meanwhile, in the past year, her teaching load had been reduced by the university to one class a semester, which meant she was making well below $10,000 a year. With huge out-of-pocket bills from UPMC Mercy for her cancer treatment, Margaret Mary was left in abject penury.\" In \"Death of an adjunct,\" by Daniel Kovalik, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 18 September 2013. [ 6 ]\n\nAddendum of Price Tags: \" 'My intention is to put a price tag on the Ph.D. and tell them this is what it costs, and can you afford it?' Ms. Kelsky said. Ph.D. programs, Ms. Kelsky said, need to be 'confronted with the truth about the sacrifices their students are making. They can't turn a blind eye to the financial devastation that their programs are causing.' But graduate programs aren't the only culprits, she said. 'The students themselves have to do some work to overcome their own denial about the costs of this endeavor,' Ms. Kelsky said. 'I really want graduate students to stop allowing themselves to be deluded about what going to graduate school entails'.\" In \"The Cost of a Ph.D.: Students Report Hefty Debt Across Many Fields,\" by Audrey Williams June, The Chronicle of Higher Education, 16 January 2014.\n\nAddendum of some Academic Multi-Millionaires: \"Robert J.

Last year we named Saban the most powerful coach in college football, and itâs a title he retains this year â and thatâs before he signed an extension with Alabama that will reportedly pay him over $7 million per season.\" In \"Nick Saban Is Still College Football's Most Powerful Coach,\" by Chris Smith, Forbes, 18 December 2013.\n\nAddendum of other Academic Millionaires: \"Thirty-six private-college presidents in the U.S. earned more than $1 million in 2012, as compared to only two of their public-school counterparts, according to a report released Sunday by the Chronicle of Higher Education. Shirley Ann Jackson, president of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, made $7.14 million, a large portion of which derived from a 10-year, $5.9 million retention incentive payout she received that year, the Chronicle reported. A private-school president was more likely to make just shy of $400,000, the median compensation of the 537 presidents at 497 private research institutions surveyed.\" In \"36 private-college presidents make more than $1 million,\" by Colin Campbell, Baltimore Sun, 7 December 2014.

The Delta Cost Project at American Institutes for Research examined rising college costs and concluded that, in recent years, a combination of state funding cuts, overspending by research universities and decreased donations have led to tuition spikes at both public and private schools. And middle-class families often earn too much to qualify for financial aid or federal grant money, which has dried up. Borrowing, and borrowing too much, can feel like the only choice.\" In \"The student loan crisis: How middle-class kids get hammered,\" by Sarah Amandolare, Los Angeles Times, 10 February 2014.\n\nAddendum of Plain Capitalist neo-Marxist Critical Theory Truth: \"Could you imagine if some of the biggest names in todayâs neo-Marxist Critical Theory actually took it upon themselves to pool wages with the adjuncts in their own department? Ha! Iâll bet $100 right now that will never happen. Iâm serious: Send me proof of professorial wage-sharing, even in something as minor as an âadjunct emergency fund,â and Iâll add a contribution from Prof. Franklin. Itâs entirely possible that the Duke Collectiveâs micro-utopianism will come to an abrupt end as soon as one of them graduates and starts making either real money or no money.\" In \"The Great Grad-School Experiment in Utopian Socialism,\" by Rebecca Schuman, Slate, 8 April 2014.\n\nAddendum of the Fattened Bureaucrat: \"...the bureaucracy of the University, like that of the government, has exploded, even more at elite (and tax-favored) private schools than among public ones. Whereas there were about 250,000 administrators and professional staff members in 1975, about half the number of professors, by 2005 there were over 750,000, easily outnumbering tenure-tracked professors. As the University has gained in power, those in control have taken on ever more the trappings of an aristocracy whose primary mission is self-preservationânot unlike the Medieval European clergy.\" In \"Watch What You Say, The New Liberal Power Elite Wonât Tolerate Dissent,\" by Joel Kotkin, Daily Beast, 7 June 2014.\n\nAddendum of a One-Percenter University Family: \"...while Nichol champions the poor â even chastising Republicans in a March News & Observer op-ed for its 'unforgivable war on poor people' â itâs unclear how well he can relate to those living in poverty.

Combining his and his wifeâs salary, the couple makes at least $612,000 per year.\" In \"Law Prof Who Specializes in Poverty Makes $205,400 â Teaching One Class Per Semester,\" by Lauren Cooley, Furman University, via CollegeFix. 27 June 2014.\n\nAddendum of University Sports Millionaires: \"1) Alabama (SEC) Nick Saban - $5,395,852; 2) Texas (Big 12) Mack Brown - $5,392,500; 3) Arkansas (SEC) Bret Bielema - $5,158,863; 4) Tennessee (SEC) Butch Jones - $4,860,000; 5) Oklahoma (Big 12) Bob Stoops - $4,741,667; 6) Ohio State (Big Ten) Urban Meyer - $4,608,000; 7) LSU (SEC) Les Miles - $4,300,000; 8) Michigan (Big Ten) Brady Hoke - $4,154,000; 9) Iowa (Big Ten) Kirk Ferentz - $3,985,000; 10) Louisville (AAC) Charlie Strong - $3,700,000.\" Data from \"Top Coach Pay,\" USA Today, by Steve Berkowitz, Jodi Upton, Christopher Schnaars and Sean Dougherty of USA TODAY; Stephanie Klein. June 2014. [ 8 ]\n\nAddendum of Yearly Tuition above the Median Yearly Income of an American: \"As the average cost of higher education in America continues to rise, at least 50 American colleges and universities are now charging students more than $60,000 per year. We found these numbers by examining the average cost of tuition, fees, room, and board that an incoming student would face over the 2014-15 academic year.\" In \"There Are Now 50 Colleges That Charge More Than $60,000 Per Year,\" by Peter Jacobs, Business Insider, 10 July 2014.\n\nAddendum of Expensive Conference Tables: \"It costs more than $44,000 in tuition to attend Kean University for four years, and many of the schoolâs students struggle to pay the bill. But the taxpayer-supported school in the township of Union spent $219,000 so far and has authorized up to $270,000 â about the average price of a house in the nearby working-class neighborhood â for a custom-made, circular conference table that seats 23 and features data ports, microphones and an illuminated map of the world in a glass panel at its center. The table was bought without competitive bidding, which is normally required under New Jersey law for purchases at state colleges and universities. Instead, Kean hired a company in China to manufacture the table. The school recently established a branch campus there and wants to strengthen ties with the Chinese government.\" In \"Kean University's $219,000 table the center of attention,\" by Patricia Alex, Bergen Record, 24 November 2014.\n\nAddendum of Not Having to Listen to Crap: \"Napolitano was sitting next UC regent Chairman Bruce Varner as a group of about two dozen protesters shouted loudly, denouncing potential tuition hikes when she made the remark, which she may not have known was being recorded. As the protests began, the cameras stayed on the regents. There was some confusion over what to do. Thatâs when Napolitano leans over to Varner and said, 'Let's just break. Let's go, let's go. We donât have to listen to this crap.' Her hot mic caught the comment. Kristian Kim was one of the students protesting the 5% tuition increases every year for five years. 'Itâs an insult to have her as the president of UC,' said Kim.\" In \"Napolitano Says 'We Donât Have To Listen To This Crap' As Students Protest Potential UC Tuition Hikes,\" CBS News, 17 March 2015.

Local union officials have threatened to get her fired if she stops paying those dues. So Allen was stunned to learn that MEA President Steve Cook, a man she has never met, swung a deal with her employer to parlay his six-figure union salary into a richer pension payout. Cook's payout will come from the same pension fund that Allen is counting on for her own retirement â a fund that is currently underfunded by nearly $26 billion.\" In \"$23K School Employee Upset that MEA Presidentâs Pension Spiked by $200K Union Salary, MEA president Steve Cook is considered a 'school employee' for Lansing Schools â where he doesn't work,\" by Anne Schieber, Michigan Capitol Confidential, 9 March 2015.\n\nAddendum of Little Gains and Big Debts: \"American graduates score poorly in international numeracy and literacy rankings, and are slipping. In a recent study of academic achievement, 45% of American students made no gains in their first two years of university. Meanwhile, tuition fees have nearly doubled, in real terms, in 20 years. Student debt, at nearly $1.2 trillion, has surpassed credit-card debt and car loans.\" In \"The world is going to university,\" Economist, 28 March 2015.\n\nAddendum Looking Back to a Warning: \"...the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.\" In \"Military-Industrial Complex Speech,\" Public Papers of the Presidents, Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1960, p. 1035- 1040.\n\nAddendum of The Oppression of Depression: \"The report's findings were especially bad for students in the humanities. About 64% of grad students in the humanities -- including English and philosophy -- were scored as depressed on the survey. A possible reason why: there's been a 30% decline in the number of humanities teaching positions at universities since 2007, according to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.\" In \"Ph.D students earning a degree in depression,\" by Patrick Gillespie, CNN Money, 27 April 2015.\n\nAddendum of Platinum Pay: \"How do you defend the transfer of teaching responsibilities to low-paid, part-time adjuncts when the president is sitting so pretty? How do you cut administrative costs, which indeed need cutting? How do you explain steep tuition increases, mammoth student debt and the failure to admit more children from poor families? How do you summon students back to the liberal arts and away from mercenary priorities?\" In \"Platinum Pay in Ivory Towers,\" by Frank Bruni, New York Times, 20 may 2015.\n\nAddendum of the Debtors: \"As of July, 6.9 million Americans with student loans hadnât sent a payment to the government in at least 360 days, quarterly data from the Education Department showed this past week. That was up 6%, or 400,000 borrowers, from a year earlier. That translates into about 17% of all borrowers with federal loans being severely delinquent, a share that would be even higher if borrowers currently in school who arenât yet required to repay were excluded.\" In \"School-Loan Reckoning: 7 Million Are in Default,\" by Josh Mitchell, Wall Street Journal, 21 August 2015.

'Iâm doing the exact same things and probably getting paid the exact same amount as people that dropped out halfway through freshman year, except Iâm still $40,000 in debt and theyâre, well, not.' So, to recoup some of those lost funds, Stephanie came up with the questionable idea of selling her degree for $50,000 - or the best offer she can get. That $50,000, she explains, will cover not just tuition, but also room and board, books, and 'memories'.\" In \" 'Please validate my use of time': Frustrated college graduate tries to sell her college diploma on eBay for $50,000 - after failing to find a job after four years,\" by Carly Stern, Mail Online, 27 August 2015.

Some are paid more than $1,000,000 per year. The median pay is $301,153, and the mean is $377,261, both of which are well into the 99th percentile of compensation for wage earners in the United States. As another point of comparison, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that chief executives earned a median annual wage of $168,140 and a mean of $176,840 in 2012. As a final point of comparison, nonprofit CEOs earned a median pay of $120,396, according to Charity Navigator.\" In \"Salaries of Private College Presidents,\" by Peter Hinrichs and Anne Chen, Economic Trends, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, 24 February 2016.

Its reported liabilities totaled about $21.5 trillion as of September 30, 2015, which was about $686 billion greater than the amount reported as of September 30, 2014.

'He's not a proletarian, he's a son of a bitch.

The data comes from a quarterly snapshot of the governmentâs $1.2 trillion student-loan portfolio put out by the Department of Education.

'What Iâm including in that is the use of substances, anxiety, depression, problems with relationships, break-ups, academic problems, learning disabilities, attentional problems,' says Dr. Beresin.

'Students who believed they were getting ever closer to obtaining their doctoral degree,' alleges the suit, 'were in fact stuck with decreasing resources, high faculty turnover, disorganization and a lack of oversight, all of which increased the length of the doctoral students' enrollments at Walden'.\" In \"For-Profit Walden U., Once Tied to Bill Clinton, Put Under Review,\" by Anna R. Schecter, NBC News, 6 October 2016.\n\nAddendum of the Oppression Olympics: \"In early October, the club organized an event to discuss immigration policy, which Bruin Republicans outreach director Haley Nieves claimed would be an intelligent, public discussion that would hopefully help change some perspectives. But it wasnât. At the end, the forum proved to be unproductive as attendees and panelists succumbed to a vicious and immature shouting match. Another example of safe spaces gone wrong was the 2016 Students of Color Conference held earlier this month, which hundreds of University of California students attended, including some of UCLAâs Undergraduate Students Association Council representatives. According to their mission statement, SOCCâs major goal was to 'create a space to discuss, dissect, and create relevant solutions to issues surrounding students of color.' However, the conference eventually turned into a kind of 'oppression Olympics,' where students argued over which minority group was oppressed the most rather than finding solidarity and understanding amongst each other. In essence, groups from both sides of the political spectrum have arranged their own safe spaces which have proven to be biased bubbles of ineffective discussion that lack respectability and open-mindedness. From excessive political correctness to downright toxicity, these spaces do not encourage students to engage in mature dialogue that could actually present solutions to their issues. It is important for participants to understand how to conduct themselves, while still being able to respectfully argue with others.\" In \"Jacqueline Alvarez: Campus 'safe spaces' prevent students from engaging in honest dialogue,\" by Jacqueline Alvarez, Daily Bruin (UCLA), 30 November 2016.\n\nAddendum of Dying Universities: \"Today, most college campuses are a witchâs brew of hypersensitivities, political correctness, language police, 'safe zones,' and all sorts of intolerance masquerading as 'diversity' and 'inclusiveness.' Despite the talk, though, such settings are anything but diverse or inclusive, when one considers the increasing list of views and topics that are banished. This problem has been growing for decades and it is evidence of what Pope Benedict XVI called the 'tyranny of relativism.' When we can no longer point to a reality or a set of truths that all can agree upon as first principles, a struggle ensues that cannot be resolved with an appeal to reason. The one who prevails is not the one who is best able to appeal to reason or principles, but rather the one who has the most power, money, or influence, or the one who shouts the loudest or is better able to intimidate. In this way, relativism has led to the kind of tyranny we see on college campuses today.\" In \"Our Dying Universities,\" by Msgr. Charles Pope, Archdiocese of Washington, 5 February 2017.\n\nAddendum of Thriving Student Spring Breaks: \"According to the LendEDU poll, 30.60% of college students with student debt claim that they are using money they received from student loans to help pay for their spring break trip this year. For reference, you can use student loan funding for living expenses. The National Center for Education Statistics calculated that 20.5 million students will be attending college this year in the United States. Orbitz reported that 55% of students will be going on spring break. Using this data, we can roughly calculate that 11,275,000 students will be going on spring break this year. And, it is estimated that 69% of all current college students use student loan debt by the time of graduation. By doing some additional arithmetic, we can calculate that roughly 7,779,750 student debtors are going on spring break this year. Factoring in our data, and assuming the claims made in our survey are accurate, this means that 2.38 million students are using money received from student loans to pay for their spring break excursion this year.\" In \"Spring Break Student Loan Study,\" LendEDU, 8 March 2017.\n\nAddendum of Tax Dollars for Massively Endowed Not-for-profit Universities: \"The 43-page report shows the massive amount of money flowing into not-for-profit Ivy League schools, including payments and entitlements, costing taxpayers more than $41 billion from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2015. The spending is controversial because these eight schools -- Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University and Yale University -- have enormous resources at their fingertips, including endowment funds (money raised from donors) in 2015 exceeding $119 billion.

She was 'anti-black' because she appropriated black slang by wearing a T-shirt that said, 'Poetry is Lit'. She was an 'ableist' because she believes trigger warnings sometimes diminish sexual trauma. She was also called a 'gaslighter' for making disadvantaged students doubt their own feelings of oppression. 'I am intimidated by these students,' she later wrote in a blog post. 'I am scared to teach courses on race, gender or sexuality or even texts that bring these issues up in any wayâ¦Iâm at a loss as to how to begin to address it, especially since many of these students donât believe in historicity or objective facts (they denounce the latter as being a tool of the white cisheteropatriarchy)'.\" In \"Arguments over free speech on campus are not left v right,\" Economist, 7 September 2017.\n\nAddendum of Exiting College with Six-Figure Debt and Only a Pipe Dream of Getting a Job in a Chosen Field: \"College can provide an earnings premium only if the student graduates and can find a job that requires a college degree. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 69 percent of high school graduates enroll in college, but only 27 percent of existing jobs and jobs projected to be created through 2022 require a college degree. As a result, according to the Federal Reserve, 44 percent of college graduates are underemployed and 16 percent of minimum wage workers have a college degree. Students taking remedial education undoubtedly fall more often on the failure side of these statistics, assuming they even make it to graduation. The result is that many current remedial education students exit college with six-figure debt and only a pipe dream of getting a job in their chosen field.\" In \"We're not doing students favors by overselling college degrees,\" by Howard Root, Star Tribune, 9 July 2017.

The form stated: 'By signing this contract, you are agreeing to our no-tolerance policy with regards to racism, sexism, classism, ageism, ableism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia or anti-religion or anti-atheism.' Kisin told the Daily Mail: 'I grew up under the Soviet Union.

The future of funny post-Kevin Hart, Louis CK and Nanette,\" by Stuart Jeffries, Guardian UK, 19 January 2019.\n\nAddendum of Another View: \"One reason college is so costly and so little real learning occurs is that collegiate resources are vastly underused. Students donât study much, professors teach little, few people read most of the obscure papers the professors write, and even the buildings are empty most of the time. The New York Federal Reserve says more than 40% of recent college graduates are 'underemployed,' but many already are while in school. Surveys of student work habits find that the average amount of time spent in class and otherwise studying is about 27 hours a week. The typical student takes classes only 32 weeks a year, so he spends fewer than 900 hours annually on academicsâless time than a typical eighth-grader, and perhaps half the time their parents work to help finance college. \" In \"College Wouldnât Cost So Much If Students and Faculty Worked Harder,\" by Richard Vedder, Wall Street Journal, 10 April 2019.\n\nAddendum of Bribes and Degree to Which Some Go: \"Prosecutors mentioned the eye-popping figure last month when announcing theyâd busted dozens of rich American parents for allegedly paying Singer to bribe their kidsâ way into top colleges â but none of those families were accused of paying anywhere near that much. The Wall Street Journal on Friday revealed that the deep-pocketed family in question is from China, and have not been charged. The family wasnât identified in the report, but the paper does reveal the name of an ousted Yale student in another family, which allegedly paid Singer $1.2 million to secure her admission to the Ivy as a bogus soccer recruit.\" In \" Chinese family paid $6.5M to admissions scam mastermind,\" by Ruth Brown, New York Post, 26 April 2019.\n\nAddendum of the Value of Regret: \"About 70% of college students graduated with student loan debt this year, averaging about $33,000 per student.

Whereas in market societies professional artists earned their living selling to, or being commissioned by rich individuals or the Church, in Soviet society not only was the market suppressed, there were few if any individuals able to patronise the arts and only one institution â the State itself. Hence artists became state employees. As such the State set the parameters for what it employed them to do. What was expected of the artist was that he/she be formally qualified and to reach a standard of competence.

No one knows for sure how much of that is embezzled, but in 2012 Donald Berwick, a former head of the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and Andrew Hackbarth of the RAND Corporation, estimated that fraud (and the extra rules and inspections required to fight it) added as much as $98 billion, or roughly 10%, to annual Medicare and Medicaid spendingâand up to $272 billion across the entire health system.\" In \"The $272 billion swindle - Why thieves love Americaâs health-care system,\" Economist, 31 May 2014.\n\nAddendum from Texas, Again: \"Guadalupe 'Lupe' TreviÃ±o, a Democrat, was convicted in July on a federal conspiracy charge after he admitted taking cash from a drug trafficker, but his party's leaders are confident the seat won't go to Al Perez, a Republican candidate with three decades of law enforcement experience.
