        "text": "All Things Must Pass…but apparently not this great album. It’s been 51 years since George Harrison’s best post-Beatles album was released, and now it sounds better than ever!\n\nGeorge Harrison said he was tempted to remix the album to lose some of the reverb and “wall of sound” production techniques used by Phil Spector. George’s son Dhani and mixer/engineer Paul Hicks have made that happen. The 50th Anniversary remix of All Things Must Pass lets us hear George Harrison’s vocals much better than previously, yet the the songs retain the feel of the original arrangements. Paul Hicks was able to do the same thing for John Lennon’s best songs with last year’s collection Gimme Some Truth.\n\nDespite all the extra demos and outtakes, the most important recordings are the ones on the original album that we’ve known for over 50 years. The improvement in those recordings is impressive. From the first track, the Harrison/Dylan song “I’d Have You Anytime”, the depth and clarity of the voices and instruments are so much better. “My Sweet Lord” let’s you hear George’s voice and the background chorus like never before.\n\nThe new remix of “Isn’t It A Pity” is especially revealing. Now we can hear the individual instruments, and how brilliantly they were used to build up the song as it progresses. We’re fully hearing the song for the first time. By the way, like many of these songs, “Isn’t It A Pity” was written during The Beatles’ time together, but wasn’t seriously worked on by the band. It may be better that George was able to keep these songs for his personal vision.\n\nFollowing “Isn’t It A Pity” are three more of the album’s best songs… “What Is Life”, “If Not For You”, and “Behind That Locked Door”. They all sound great, especially the last one. The remix sounds like George and the band are in the room with you. A surprise for me was “Let It Down”. The remix sounds so much better that it elevates my opinion of the song. “Run Of The Mill” (which every common sense person knows should have been titled “It’s You That Decides”) is perfection. On the outtakes CD, there’s an alternate version with dual guitars that are a bit reminiscent of the style used by The Allman Brothers Band.\n\nThe third side of the original album started with one of the album’s very best tracks, “Beware Of Darkness”, and that side’s lineup is strong all the way through to the excellent title track “All Things Must Pass”. The point is, if you liked the songs before, you’re going to enjoy them even more with the greatly improved mixes. Dhani Harrison and Paul Hicks deserve high praise for their years of work on this project. Their goal was to improve the sound of these recordings so they will be enjoyed for another 50 years and beyond. Mission accomplished.\n\nThere are a bunch of different CD and vinyl versions available. This is my three CD version. It includes the remixes of the original three record set, plus a full CD of outtakes and alternate versions. You can click and zoom the photo to see the songs on each CD sleeve. The set also has a nice colorful 20-page booklet, and a folded poster with the lyrics on the back. There’s a five CD version that has two discs of demos, which I listened to on streaming. A complete list of the songs and the descriptions of the various CD & Vinyl versions (with prices) are available in an earlier article on this site.\n\n(A quote from George Harrison at the front of the booklet)\n\nThe outtakes disc starts with a short verse that shows George’s sense of humor about how long it takes to get a song right. He sings… “Isn’t it so shitty, isn’t it a shame. How we do so many takes, and we’re doing it again.” The outtakes are interesting, but like nearly every box set, you’ll hear why the versions ultimately chosen are better. There’s a new track on the disc that’s an enjoyable eight-and-a-half-minute blues jam, “Almost 12-Bar Honky Tonk”. George recruited top musicians for this album, and they played great together.\n\nThe two demo CD’s are divided into Day 1 and Day 2. It’s striking how many songs George Harrison had available to record just six months after The Beatles broke up. He had obviously been writing the songs for years, and now he could bring them to life for the public. Even though the produced versions are better than the demos, you may enjoy hearing how the songs began.\n\n(My 30th & 50th Anniversary CD box sets)\n\nAdditional test: After loading the CD’s into my computer at the highest quality possible, I made a playlist of the songs from the 2001 remaster. Then immediately followed each song with the same song from the 2021 remix…in order to get a good comparison. The audio was played on a high-quality stereo system. The simplest explanation of the result is that the 2001 remaster sounded like it was playing on smaller speakers than the 2021 remix. Even though the volume levels were the same, the new remix definitely lets you hear the bass and drums more like the instruments really sound (full & clear). Besides the clarity of all the instruments, the biggest improvement is that the remix sounds more like George is right there with you.\n\nThere are always some people who are going to prefer the version they’ve known for 50 years, and that’s okay. But I can only imagine the screams that would have happened if this new remix had been the original version, and Apple later released that thinner sounding version with vocals more buried, and an over abundance of reverb.\n\nI bought the original 3-record set on sale for $6.50 the week it came out in 1970. The album was extremely popular. It went to #1 for seven weeks, and by some counts is the biggest selling solo album by any of The Beatles. Paul McCartney’s Band On The Run actually sold more copies, but a 3-record set counts as three sales.\n\nIt’s obvious George Harrison would have loved the new mix of All Things Must Pass, and would have been proud of his son for making his wish come true. There’s no other solo album by an ex-Beatle that contains so many great songs. The new remix deserves as many stars as reviewers are allowed to give.\n\nUpdate: All Things Must Pass won Best Box Set at the 2022 Grammy Awards. That makes Dhani the first Beatles’ son or daughter to win a Grammy. His mom, Olivia, also won as a co-producer. She joins Linda McCartney and Yoko Ono who won Grammys with their husbands.\n\nExtra: Wanted to share this photo from the booklet.\n\nIt seemed like the 70s. David Crosby and Jackson Browne released new albums on the same day (July 23rd, 2021).\n\nDavid Crosby had trouble keeping friends in recent years, especially his band mates Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young. So, he recruited other friends to help with his album, For Free.\n\nThe impressive cover painting is by Joan Baez. The first song, “River Rise” is a solid start for the album, and features great harmony work by Michael McDonald. Of course McDonald is known for his solo hits, as well as his work with The Doobie Brothers and Steely Dan. Crosby also got Steely Dan’s Donald Fagan to co-write one of the other tracks, “Rodriguez For A Night”, which definitely sounds like it would have been at home on a Steely Dan album.\n\n(Photo by Anna Webber)\n\nThe title track, “For Free”, is the well-known song by Joni Mitchell, and is done here as a duet with Sarah Jarosz. The song is about a popular singer spotting a street musician who is…”playing real good for free”. The recording has a beautiful sound, and they sing it in perfect harmony, but that’s the problem. If Sara Jarosz had only joined-in with harmony for portions of the song, it would have been effective. Unfortunately, with the two singing nearly every word in harmony, you can hear how hard they’re striving to stay in perfect synchronization. The song loses its story-telling flow. Crosby did a better version with The Byrds nearly 50 years ago. By the way, David Crosby turned 80 on August 14h, 2021, just after the release of this album, and his voice was still strong.\n\nDespite the slight miss on the title track, this is a high quality album. The playing, singing, and arranging are all first rate. There are no clunkers to be found. Some of these songs would have worked great as Crosby Stills & Nash recordings, but the tracks on this album that have more of a pop/jazz feel (like “Secret Dancer”) are cool too. Of the flurry of albums David Crosby released late in his life, this is the best one.\n\nFor Free concludes with a touching song, “I Won’t Stay For Long”, by David Crosby’s son, James Raymond. It includes the lyrics… “I don’t know if I’m dying or about to be born, but I’d like to be with you today, and I won’t stay for long.”\n\nIt was a long stay in the music business for David Crosby. Since The Byrds hit with “Mr. Tamborine Man” in 1965, we’ve had the privilege of enjoying his talent. Whether he sang harmony or lead, whether in a group or solo, he always gave us his very original style. With all of David Crosby’s personal and health problems over the years, it’s amazing he made it to 81, and was still writing and singing at this high level. On January 18th, 2023 he passed away (It was announced on the 19th). His wife, Jan, released a statement that he died after a long illness, but members of his band said Crosby was preparing for a tour, even though he had to turn over his guitar parts to someone else. In recent interviews, Crosby said that arthritis in his hands made guitar playing difficult. Band members also said Crosby had been writing & recording new songs shortly before he died.\n\nExtra: During a July, 2021 interview in the Los Angeles Times, Jackson Browne was asked if any musicians served as mentors to him when he was young. Here’s his answer: “David Crosby agreed to sing on my first record. He absolutely showed me how to record, how to multitrack vocals. He praised me to others and to myself, and that was really important. I feel a great debt of gratitude to David.”\n\nHere’s the link to the review of Jackson Browne’s new album: https://ontherecords.net/2021/07/jackson-brownedownhill-from-everywhere-review/\n\nThese days, Jackson Browne says the songwriting process is slower for him. It’s been seven years since the 73-year-old singer/songwriter released a new album, and now we have Downhill From Everywhere.\n\nThe album is a collection of ten Jackson Browne originals (with some co-writing). Right away, Jackson lets us know he’s “Still Looking For Something”, which is a really good song, and a strong start for the the album. It would have been a good title for it. He says…“If all I find is freedom, it’s alright.”\n\nThe featured single and video is “My Cleveland Heart”. It’s a lap steel guitar rocker about avoiding heartbreak by getting an artificial heart at the famous Cleveland Clinic. The video adds some humor to the idea.\n\nThe third track on the album, “Minutes To Downtown”, is another song about heartbreak, and it has that classic Jackson Browne sound. “I See that smile, and even while it breaks my heart, I laugh. That’s because this heart was already torn in half.”\n\nThe quality continues with the duet “A Human Touch”. The vocal is started by co-writer Leslie Mendelson. Jackson Browne adds harmony on the chorus, and then takes the lead on the next verse. The lap steel guitar gives it a country feel, and the lyrics hit home after the distancing of the pandemic… “Sometimes all anybody needs is a human touch.” It reminded me of another duet, “Sometimes Love Just Ain’t Enough”, by Patty Smyth and Don Henley.\n\nThe title track, “Downhill From Everywhere”, is based on the thought that everything we do eventually goes downhill into the ocean, polluting it. The song is a rocker that sounds like the guitarist had the riff from The Rolling Stones’ “Start Me Up” stuck in his head. It’s not one of the better songs on the album…just too many listings of “Downhill from…” on it.\n\nThe second song that has a Stone’s guitar feel is “Until Justice Is Real”. It took a few listens for me to warm up to it, but it sounds like it would have fit on Jackson’s “Lives In The balance” album.\n\nOne of the best songs is the welcome new ballad “A Little Soon To Say”. It features beautiful guitar and organ accompaniment, with effective vocal harmonies, especially on the title line about whether things will be alright….“It’s just a little soon to say.”\n\nThe album ends upbeat with “A Song For Barcelona”. The rhythm and instrumental arrangement match the title perfectly. The band is energetic and in a groove. Jackson Browne sings that Barcelona “gave me refuge in my escape from Rock & Roll.”\n\nSomething Jackson Browne could work on is making his album covers more appealing. Here are his last two covers next to each other.\n\nIt looks like a place you’d want to avoid. It would be a shame if anyone missed the music because they were turned away by the cover. One of the new publicity photos would have made a much more inviting cover, and would have still been in line with his often serious lyrics.\n\nJackson Browne fans will definitely be adding some of the songs from Downhill From Everywhere to their permanent playlists. This album has the most Jackson Browne songs I’ve added from any of his albums in the last 30 years. Jackson is performing tracks from the new album, as he’s touring this fall with James Taylor, and on his own.\n\nThese days, we’re lucky Jackson Browne is still providing fans with new music.\n\nExtra: For a look at Jackson’s best albums, and some original concert photos, here’s the link. https://ontherecords.net/2017/06/jackson-browne-best-albums-2021-updates/\n\nUpdate (August, 2021): Jackson Browne & James Taylor returned to the stage in Sarasota, Florida August 23rd. Here are photos from the Daily Gazette.\n\nAccording to the article, the two singer-songwriters performed together on three of Jackson’s songs “The Pretender”, “Running On Empty” and “Take It Easy”. Trivia: Both J.B. & J.T. were born in 1948.\n\nBonus photo from 2022 concert:\n\nHuge changes were made in the release of the Let It Be/Get Back movie. Instead of a movie to be shown in theaters, it’s a three-part documentary streaming now on Disney+, and was to be released on DVD & Blu-ray February 8th, 2022, but was postponed until July 12th, 2022, because the Blu-ray had an audio flaw.\n\n(At the end of this article are links to reviews of the Get Back movie, and the Let It Be album box set.)\n\nThe three films are longer than we were originally told. Part one is 2-hours-37-minutes. Part two is 2-hours-53-minutes. Part three is 2-hours-18-minutes.\n\n(All photos from Apple Corps LTD)\n\nDirector Peter Jackson (famous for the Lord Of The Rings trilogy) worked with the 56-hours of original Let It Be film footage for nearly four years.\n\nJackson says he was mostly able to select different camera shots and angles than were used in the Let It Be movie. He sees it as a documentary about the making of the original film. The quality of the film footage has been restored to a new clarity for today’s high-definition viewing. They’ve also talked about making the original movie available in the higher quality form.\n\nI’m guessing Peter Jackson completed a movie-length version of The Beatles: Get Back before the change was made to a three-part streaming version. Update (November 2021): Yes, it’s confirmed there is a one-hour-and-forty-minute version of the Get Back film…which is the normal length for a movie/documentary. It was used at the U.S. & U.K. premieres that the family members of The Beatles attended. The original length of the movie meant for August of 2020 was 2-hours-20-minutes.\n\nFor the first time, we can see the full 40-minutes of the rooftop concert. The original movie had about half that. Unlike a real concert, The Beatles played multiple takes that were later edited together to form more-perfect audio recordings for the album. It was actually a pubic recording session that was captured on Abbey Road’s studio equipment down below. Here is a list of the songs in the order they were performed.\n\nAlthough the recording of the Let It Be album was done in just 21 days, The Beatles were also filmed running through songs that would later appear on Abbey Road and some of their solo albums.\n\nThe companion 240-page book was released on October 12th, 2021. The book features transcribed conversations from the film audio recordings, and many unseen photos by Linda McCartney and Ethan A. Russell. The list price is $60, but it’s online for $42 (and as low as $30). There’s a review of the book on this site.\n\nThe music for the movie has been remixed by Giles Martin and Sam Okell . Box set anyone? Update: There is a 5-disc plus Blu-ray box set that was released October 15th. It’s priced at $139.98. A matching vinyl set is $199.98, and a 2 CD set with the remixed album, plus selected highlights from the box set, is $24.98.\n\nHere are the track lists for the CD’s and the vinyl records (click to enlarge and make clearer). You can see the set has the new remix of Let It Be, plus the original unreleased Get Back album, and sessions & rehearsals.\n\nUpdate: (Sept. 2022) Get Back won five Emmy Awards in various categories, including for Outstanding Documentary Series, and Best Director for Peter Jackson. It also won awards for sound & film editing. Paul, Ringo, Olivia & Yoko all won Emmys as executive producers.\n\nHere’s a link to my review of the Get Back documentary: https://ontherecords.net/2021/11/the-beatles-get-back-film-review-perspective/\n\nHere’s the link to a review & perspective of the new box set: https://ontherecords.net/2021/10/let-it-be-remix-box-set-review/\n\nThe latest Tom Petty vault release is a 25th Anniversary reimagining of the She’s The One soundtrack album from 1996.\n\nIt’s now called Angel Dream, and was released June 12th, 2021 as part of a celebration of Record Store Day, 2021. It came out in digital form on July 2nd. Three of the songs from the original soundtrack that were included in the recent Wildflowers box set, have been removed, along with four other tracks. Instead, there are four previously unreleased tracks… “105 Degrees”, “One Of Life’s Little Mysteries”, the instrumental “French Disconnection”, and a cover of J.J. Cale’s “Thirteen Days”.\n\nHere are the songs on the original soundtrack (the new lineup of songs is farther below):\n\nWalls (Circus)\n\nGrew Up Fast\n\nZero From Outer Space\n\nClimb That Hill\n\nChange The Locks\n\nAngel Dream (No. 4)\n\nHope you Never\n\nA**hole\n\nSupernatural Radio\n\nCalifornia\n\nHope On Board\n\nWalls (No. 3) [acoustic version]\n\nAngel Dream (No. 2)\n\nHung Up And Overdue\n\nAirport\n\nWhen I started listening to the original album in 1996, it was initially disappointing. “Walls (Circus)” sounded pretty good, but out of the first nine tracks,, the only other songs that appealed to me were “Climb That Hill” & “Hope You Never”. Then beginning with #10, “California”, there were five good songs in a row. When “Walls (No. 3)” started playing, my mind went…“Now that’s Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers!” Then “Angel Dream (No. 2)” was so much better than the earlier version that had the distractingly odd percussion. Plus, “Hung Up And Overdue” sounded like a blend of The Beatles and The Beach Boys (Ringo Starr & Carl Wilson are on it). So, in the end, there were 8 songs I liked, and that’s more than most albums.\n\nHere are the songs on the new Angel Dream:\n\nSide 1…tracks 1-5, Side 2…6-12\n\nAngel Dream (No. 2)\n\nGrew Up Fast\n\nChange The Locks\n\nZero From Outer Space\n\nA**hole\n\nOne Of Life’s Little Mysteries*\n\nWalls (No. 3)\n\nThirteen Days*\n\n105 Degrees*\n\nClimb That Hill\n\nSupernatural Radio (extended by 41-seconds)\n\nFrench Disconnection (Instrumental)*\n\n*Previously unreleased\n\nThe seven tracks that went away are “Hope You Never”, “California”, “Hung Up And Overdue”, “Walls (Circus)” “Angel Dream (No. 4)”, and the instrumentals “Airport” & “Hope On Board”. On the original album, “Hope On Board” served as a beautiful intro to “Walls (No. 3)”, and it’s a shame it was left off. In fact, if you use GarageBand (or other song editor) to overlap the songs so “Walls (No. 3) starts before the last note of “Hope On Board” fades, it sounds like it was always meant to be. Here it is:\n\nhttps://ontherecords.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Hope-On-Board_Walls-No.-3-1.m4a\n\nThe four new tracks are all on side two, which is the best side of the record. “One Of Life’s Little Mysteries” is really different for Tom Petty. It’s a slow song that sounds like an old fashioned tune from the 1930’s, or a song Randy Newman would have written for a movie or musical. “Thirteen Days” is a very good studio version of J.J. Cale’s blues song, with cool slide guitar by Mike Campbell. “105 Degrees” is an uptempo rocker that would have been fun in concert. The final track is titled “French Disconnection”, but it’s really an instrumental version of “Angel Dream”. It’s a pretty ending for the album.\n\n(Recording session for “She’s The One” album.)\n\nExtra: Here’s a suggestion for making a playlist that combines the best songs from the two versions of the album.\n\nAngel Dream (No. 2)\n\nCalifornia\n\nHope You Never\n\nHung Up And Overdue\n\nOne Of Life’s Little Mysteries\n\nHope On Board\n\nWalls (No. 3)\n\nThirteen Days\n\n105 Degrees\n\nClimb That Hill\n\nSupernatural Radio\n\nFrench Disconnection (Angel Dream instrumental)\n\nThat would have been a worthy follow-up album to Wildflowers.\n\nGreat news for George Harrison fans. His masterpiece, All Things Must Pass has been remixed for a 50th Anniversary edition!\n\n(Note: There is now a review of the new remix on this site. Below in this article are the song lists and CD & Vinyl versions that are available.)\n\nReview: https://ontherecords.net/2021/08/george-harrison-all-things-must-pass50th-anniversary-remix-review/\n\nThe reason it’s a big deal is that the remix has been done by the same mixer/engineer who recently did an amazing job with the John Lennon collection, Gimme Some Truth. Paul Hicks has been working with George’s son, Dhani to improve All Things Must Pass.\n\nDhani says his dad thought the original album “had too much reverb.” The album was recorded by the legendary producer Phil Spector, who was known for his “wall of sound”. (Unfortunately, he was also known for being convicted of murder.) Spector’s producing style had a tendency to bury vocals a bit, and could sound dated next to the clarity of today’s recordings. Dhani Harrison says he wants the audio quality of his dad’s recordings to hold up in the future. The results were released on August 6th, 2021, and the album sounds great!\n\nHere”s a quote from George Harrison I found in my 2001 remastered set of All Things Must Pass, where he said he was tempted to remix the songs. “I would like to liberate some of these songs from the big production that seemed appropriate at the time, but now seems a bit over the top with the reverb in the wall of sound.”\n\nThere’s a whole array of different versions of the set. Below are the lists of songs for the five CD’s that are available. After that you’ll see the various sets and their prices. I found a bunch of articles about the release, but none of them had all of the sets and prices. They were hard to find on Amazon too, because they’re not shown together.\n\n(Each song list can be enlarged with a click or zoom.)\n\nThe 2-CD version is the remix of the original album, plus all sets have a poster. The price is $20.\n\nThe vinyl version of the remixed album is on three records like the original release. The price is $65. (I remember paying $6.50 when the album came out in 1970.) There’s also an e-commerce version of this set with green & black splattered colored vinyl for $76.\n\nThis is my choice. It’s 3 CD’s, with that third CD being the outtakes as shown on CD 5 of the above lists. There’s also a 20 page booklet. The price is $30. (The demos can be checked out on streaming.)\n\nHere’s the 5 vinyl album version of the 3 CD set. The price is $90.\n\nThe 5 CD version includes two discs of demos that are not in the 3 CD version. Plus, there’s a Blu-ray with 5.1 sound of the original album’s songs. There’s also an added 56 page “scrapbook”. The price is $150.\n\nThis 8 vinyl record version is the equivalent of the 5 CD set, plus there’s a 60 page “scrapbook”. The scrapbook “pays homage to George’s love of gardening & nature.” The price is $200.\n\nThis “Uber” collection will set you back $1,000. If you want to see what you get for that, zoom or click this text:\n\n(Close-up of the 1/6th scale figures in the box.)\n\nEven though I’d purchased All Things Must Pass three times…records, CD’s, and remastered CD’s…I welcomed this remix to improve the sound. Like the excellent Lennon collection, this is the best George Harrison’s recordings have ever sounded.\n\nExtra…Here’s the link to an article about George’s solo career:\n\nhttps://ontherecords.net/2017/09/george-harrison-solo-traveling-wilburys/\n\nThe story of the band Heart revolves around sisters Ann & Nancy Wilson, who became pioneers of women in Rock.\n\nWhat caused these young girls to want to perform Rock & Roll? Ann (left) and Nancy were about to turn 14 and 10 when they saw The Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show in February of 1964. Nancy says that TV show, plus seeing The Beatles perform in their hometown of Seattle in 1966, were two major events that made them want to play guitars and become professional musicians.\n\nIt was about a decade later that the sisters released their first album with their band Heart. Dreamboat Annie was recorded in 1975 in Vancouver, Canada, and released in 1976 in the U.S. Their first single, “Crazy On You” broke into the Top 40 at #35, and “Magic Man” made the Top 10 at #9. The album itself hit #7 and went platinum (a million sold).\n\nThe two singles are considered Hard Rock, while the title track is an acoustic song that leans to Folk. Ann & Nancy had previously performed songs by Joni Mitchell and Paul Simon, but their biggest influence by the mid-seventies was Led Zeppelin. The Wilson sisters became the first women to front a Hard Rock band.\n\nWhile other women were integrated into Rock bands…like Grace Slick in Jefferson Airplane, and Stevie Nicks & Christine McVie in Fleetwood Mac…Ann & Nancy were the leaders of their band. Of course the men in the band made significant contributions, but Ann & Nancy wrote the songs, Ann sang lead, played flute & acoustic guitar, and Nancy switched off on lead & rhythm guitar, and sang harmony & sometimes lead. You can tell by the cover of their first album (above)…they were the faces of Heart.\n\nIn 1977, Heart had another rocking hit with “Barracuda” (#11), plus their second album Little Queen rose to #9 and went triple-platinum. Their success continued with the album Dog & Butterfly in 1978. It peaked at #17, and went double-platinum. Singles included “Straight On” (#15) and “Dog & Butterfly” (#35). Their 1980 album Bebe le Strange was highly ranked at #5, but sales dropped off dramatically to about half-a-million copies. Thus ended their first major bubble of success. During the next four years it looked like their careers might be winding down. But soon, they would achieve their greatest popularity.\n\nIt took a move to Capitol Records, which invested a great deal to help transform Heart into an even bigger hit-making band. In the 80s, MTV was an important part of marketing musicians. Capitol made impressively shot videos of the group that accented Ann & Nancy’s sexuality. The two have expressed some regret for agreeing to the videos, but really it was just the era, and there were many similar videos by other artists. The biggest change was actually the songwriting.\n\nWhile Ann & Nancy wrote their hits in the ‘70s, they were in a dry spell, so Capitol recruited professional songwriters, and it really paid off. The album Heart topped Billboard’s album chart for three weeks in 1985, and went quadruple-platinum. There were four big hit singles…”What About Love” #10, “Never” #4, “Nothin’ At All” #10, and “These Dreams”, which was their first #1 hit. The song features Nancy on the lead vocal, and it was written by Bernie Taupin (of Elton John fame) and Martin Page.\n\nAnn got her first #1 with Heart’s next release. “Alone” was sent to radio stations as a CD single in May of 1987. When we previewed it at our Rock station, it was easy to predict the song would top the charts. “Alone” is one of the best power ballads from a decade of power ballads. It showcased the strength and clarity of Ann’s amazing voice.\n\nThat hit ended up on Heart’s 1987 album, Bad Animals. It also included the hits “Who Will You Run To” #7 (by famous songwriter Diane Warren), and “There’s The Girl” #12 (written by Nancy Wilson & Holly Knight). The album hit #2 and was triple-platinum.\n\nThere was one album left in this second big bubble of popularity that started in 1985. It was Brigade in 1990. The album went to #3, and was double-platinum. The main single was “All I Want To Do Is Make Love To You” #2, written by producer “Mutt” Lange. The album also had “Stranded” #13, which turned out to be the last major hit for Heart.\n\nAfter 1990, Heart had successful tours, but their major album releases were variations of “Greatest Hits” packages. There were individual projects, such as Nancy working on movie soundtracks (including Almost Famous) with her then-husband, writer/director Cameron Crowe. Heart did hit #10 on the album chart with Red Velvet Car in 2010. That meant they had Top-10 albums in four decades. Their total sales of albums exceeds 35-million.\n\nHeart’s music has been popular for over 45 years. They had two major peaks of success…1975 to 1980 and 1985 to 1990…either of which would be the envy of most bands.\n\nHeart was inducted into The Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 2013. It was an honor they richly deserved. Their work in the 1970s paved the way for female bands and female Rock singers of the 1980s and beyond.\n\nThe 1980s had an abundance of one-hit wonders, partly because MTV (which started in 1981) had to hunt for enough videos to fill their programming. That included pulling in artists from other countries. Typically, the term one-hit wonder is applied to artists who literally only charted one song (still a major accomplishment), or artists who had one big hit that overshadowed the rest of their career (at least in the USA).\n\nOne of the most popular songs and videos was by a Norwegian group, A-ha, who performed “Take On Me”. The song hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the video was ground-breaking in it’s use of film and graphics. The animation, which was done in the United States, took nine months to complete. They had only one other minor U.S. hit, “The Sun Always Shines On T.V.”, but charted over 20 hits in Norway.\n\nGermany gave us “99 Luftballons” by Nena. It went to #2 in 1984. The German version was the most popular, but some radio stations played the flip side, which was the English version, “99 Red Balloons”. The guy on the left seems to be seriously crushing on Nena.\n\nAnother German-born artist was Peter Schilling. His 1983 #14 hit was “Major Tom (Coming Home)”, which was a follow-up to David Bowie’s “Space Oddity” from a decade earlier. The chorus started with a countdown: ”4-3-2-1 Earth below us, drifting, falling…” Hopefully that helps you remember it.\n\nThe song that leads off my 80s playlists is “I Melt With You” by U.K. group Modern English. It was featured prominently in the movie Valley Girl, and was performed just last week on TV’s Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist. The main line is…”I’ll stop the world and melt with you”. I grabbed my Top 40 reference book to look up the 1983 song, and it’s not there! The song only made it to #76 on the Hot 100. It did make it to #7 on the less significant Mainstream Rock chart.\n\nThe second song on my first 80s playlist is “Tainted Love” by Soft Cell, an English duo (Marc Almond & David Ball). The song peaked at #8 in 1982, and still holds up today. “Always Something There To Remind Me” by Naked Eyes was also a #8 hit, but in 1983. They actually had a second significant hit with “Promises Promises”, #11 that same year.\n\nA true one-hit wonder group was Devo. Those are not flower pots on their heads, but “Energy Domes” they designed to give them an odd sci-fi look, or as one member said “kind of like a Lego”. Their #14 hit is “Whip It”, which had a bizarre video. This one didn’t make any of my ‘80s playlists. They get credit for finding a way to get noticed, but the novelty wears off quickly.\n\nAnother one-hit group was proud they didn’t have anything weird on their heads…Men Without Hats. The Canadian group (with an American lead singer) had an even bigger novelty hit by taking “The Safety Dance” to #3 in 1983. By the way, the similarly named group, Men At Work, had five major hits in the 1980s, including “Down Under” & “Who Can It Be Now?”…both #1’s. The bands missed a chance to combine for a big…Men At Work Without Hats…tour.\n\nA band from San Francisco, Tommy Tutone, created the most famous phone number in history with “867-5309/Jenny”. It was a #4 hit in 1982. Above are the single and “Jenny” from the video. In real life, people who had that phone number in various area codes had to change numbers, because of all the calls they received from people asking for Jenny.\n\nThe band Madness had a #7 hit in 1983 with “Our House”. It wasn’t a very very fine house like the one in the Crosby Stills Nash & Young song, but that might have been because it was located “in the middle of our street”. Maybe they really meant it was in the middle of their block. Madness was very popular in their home country of England, where they had 15 Top 10 hits.\n\nThere are always bands with strange names, and A Flock Of Seagulls fits the bill. The song they’re known for is “I Ran (So Far Away)”, #9 in 1982. That was when bands like this were called “New Wave”. They did chart a couple more minor hits after that.\n\n“I hear the secrets that you keep, when you’re talking in your sleep.” is the main line of “Talking In Your Sleep” by The Romantics. It reached #3 in 1983. You may also remember their song “What I Like About You” which only made it to #49.\n\nAmong the quirky novelty songs from the ‘80s is “She Blinded Me With Science” by Thomas Dolby. It reached #5 in 1983. The song’s video featured Dolby as a mad scientist dramatically saying the title, followed by almost random sounding notes on a synthesizer. Synthesizers were prominent in ‘80s music, and the terms synth-pop and synth-rock were used to categorize the music.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer is a Grammy-winning film composer, with synthesizer being his main instrument. He had an instrumental hit with “Axel F” which went to #3 in 1985. It was the theme for the movie Beverly Hills Cop starring Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley. If you can ask Siri or Alexa to play the song, you’ll probably instantly recognize the melody.\n\nOne of the one-hit 45’s I bought in the ‘80s was “Captain Of Her Heart” by the band Double. I always liked the cool piano part, as well as the laid-back vocal. It reached #16 in 1986. In researching for this article, I discovered Double was a Swiss band, and their name is actually pronounced doo-Blay.\n\nSometimes I took a chance and bought the whole album by a new group. In this case, it was a German band, Freiheit. Their 1988 song, “Keeping The Dream Alive”, didn’t make the Top 40, but did get airplay on some radio stations, and was a hit in other countries. It was also included in the 1989 movie Say Anything. When American Idol was still a juggernaut in 2009, “Keeping The Dream Alive” was featured several times. The sound of the song is very Beatles-like, and it was even recorded at Abbey Road Studios. Here’s a 63-second clip of the song:\n\nhttps://ontherecords.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Keeping-The-Dream-Alive-short-clip.m4a\n\nAnother Beatles-sounding ‘80s song is “I Don’t Mind At All”. It barely edged into the Top 40 (#38) in 1987, but also made the Top 5 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The group was Bourgeois Tagg (which are the last names of the two guys who formed it). They were from Sacramento, California. The song was produced by recent Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame inductee Todd Rundgren.\n\nSpeaking of Beatles-sounding, Julian Lennon had a short burst of popularity in 1984-85 with three hit singles…”Too Late For Goodbyes” #5, ”Valotte” #9, and “Say You’re Wrong” #21 (those are my record sleeves above). John’s son, Julian, was just 21 at the time. Volotte was his only platinum album, but he did have two more moderately successful albums.\n\nThe 80’s had quite a few artists like Julian Lennon who had multiple hits, but not really enough to have their own 20-song playlists, at least at a hit-quality level. But it’s great having ‘80s songs on the list like “I Love Rock & Roll” (#1, 1982) and “I Hate Myself For Loving You” (#8, 1988) by Joan Jett & The Blackhearts. Plus songs by The J. Geils Band, The Go-Go’s, Eurythmics, The Stray Cats, Blondie, The Bangles, Rick Springfield and more.\n\nRick Springfield is an artist whose popularity surprised me. I mainly think of him for the ‘80s classic “Jessie’s Girl”, a #1 hit from 1981. I figured he had another three or four hits, but when I looked in my Top 40 book, he had seventeen Top 40 hits.\n\nOf course the 1980s had huge hit songs and albums by artists like Tom Petty, Dire Straits, Bruce Springsteen, The Police, Billy Joel, AC/DC, Paul Simon, Michael Jackson, U2, Van Halen, Phil Collins, and many more. But, a lot of the distinctive musical flavor of the decade came from artists who had more modest success.\n\nNow that Crosby Stills Nash & Young fans have explored the Deja Vu 50th Anniversary box set, there’s another box set that would be an even greater treasure. There are only two rarities by Neil Young in the Deja Vu set, mainly because he had a relatively lesser role in making the album.\n\nNeil wasn’t fully integrated into his new group. He’s on only five of Deja Vu’s tracks. The best ones are his song “Helpless” and Joni Mitchell’s “Woodstock”. At the same time, he was recording his solo album After The Gold Rush. Many of the songs on that excellent album are better than the two songs he made available to the group. Songs like “Tell Me Why”, “Only Love Can Break Your Heart”, and “Southern Man” became CSNY songs only during their live shows.\n\nThe most studio recordings and highest quality songs Crosby Stills Nash & Young ever recorded together were for their unfinished 1970s album, Human Highway. The quality of those recordings surpassed the solo versions that were eventually released. Many, but not all of those group versions have surfaced, scattered over multiple albums and decades. Those recordings (along with “Ohio”) represent the best work Neil Young did with the group.\n\nSo, a box set that would be more important and more valuable than Deja Vu would be the Human Highway Sessions.\n\n(The planned cover photo for Human Highway)\n\nIt would contain the recordings from CSNY’s sessions from 1973, 1974, and 1976. That’s where the real group studio recordings of Crosby Stills Nash & Young are hiding. Neil Young’s songs and work with the group are much more significant, and CSN’s contributions to his songs far surpass singing “helpless” in the background.\n\nAlthough logs of the sessions are somewhat sketchy, here are the best possibilities of the songs worked on during the Human Highway recording sessions.\n\nMay-June 1973:\n\nHuman Highway (Young)\n\nPardon My Heart (Young)\n\nAnd So It Goes (Nash)\n\nPrison Song (Nash)\n\nSee The Changes (Stills)\n\nThrough My Sails (Young)\n\nAs I Come Of Age (Stills)\n\nDecember 1974:\n\nWind On The Water (Nash)\n\nHomeward Through The Haze (Crosby)\n\nMarch-May 1976:\n\nHuman Highway (Young)\n\nTaken At All (Nash)\n\nLong May You Run (Young)\n\nMidnight On The Bay (Young)\n\nBlack Coral (Stills)\n\nOcean Girl (Young)\n\nTime After Time (Crosby)\n\nFontainebleau (Young)\n\nTraces (Young)\n\nSeparate Ways (Young)\n\nTreetop Flyer (Stills)\n\nNo One Seems To Know (Young)\n\nMake Love To You (Stills)\n\nGuardian Angel (Stills)\n\nWill To Love (Young)\n\nLet It Shine (Young)\n\nLittle Blind Fish (Crosby/Stills/Nash/Young)\n\nIt’s almost certain that more songs were worked on, but this seems to be a reasonable list of the main titles that are known. In addition, there would be various takes and versions of the songs.\n\nRather than trying to recreate a single Human Highway album, it would be much more important and historic to have all of these studio recordings from the band’s prime years. Maybe there’s someone at the Warner/Rhino company who’s strong enough to get the band’s representatives to cooperate on the project. Or maybe we’re just…helplessly hoping.\n\nBonus: Since the Human Highway Sessions box set may never happen, here’s a playlist of the existing significant studio recordings that include all four members of Crosby Stills Nash & Young. It also shows the sources for the recordings. The title is 4 Together.\n\n(The runner-up title was For Each Other.)\n\nWoodstock (Deja Vu)\n\nHelpless (Deja Vu)\n\nAlmost Cut My Hair (Alternates) [Deja Vu box set]\n\nOhio (So Far/CSN box set)\n\nFind The Cost Of Freedom (So Far/CSN box set)\n\nThe Lee Shore (CSN box set)\n\nThrough My Sails (Zuma)\n\nSee The Changes (CSN box set)\n\nPrison Song (bootleg/YouTube)\n\nHawaiian Sunrise (CSNY 1974)\n\nLove/Art Blues (CSNY 1974)\n\nHomeward Through The Haze (CSN box set)\n\nHuman Highway (NY Archives II, 1976 Version)\n\nTaken At All (CSN box set)\n\nLong May you Run (Decade)\n\nMidnight On The Bay (NY Archives II)\n\nBlack Coral (Stills box set)\n\nThis Old House (American Dream)\n\nSlowpoke (Looking Forward)\n\nLooking Forward (Looking Forward)\n\nTracks: 1-6 ’69-‘70 7-17 ’73-’76 18-20 ’88-’99\n\nThese are in chronological order (the only cheat was slightly waiting to add “The Lee Shore” so it would be next to “Through My Sails”). Two live versions were snuck in, “Hawaiian Sunrise” and “Love/Art Blues”. CSNY apparently didn’t do studio versions of those two songs, but these recordings come close, and are too good to leave out.\n\n“Love/Art Blues” is a perfect example of why recordings with all four group members are so good. Neil Young thinks so much of the song that he put three versions of it in his Archives II set…a solo version, trio version, and one with the Stray Gators backing group. They’re good, but the CSNY version takes the song to a higher level. It’s because of excellent harmonies by Crosby & Nash, and impressive country/blues piano accents by Stephen Stills. Here it is:\n\nhttps://ontherecords.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Love_Art-Blues-w_CSN-Studio-Mix-4_15_76.m4a\n\nCrosby Stills Nash & Young made the best music when they were all four together.\n\nExtra: If you’d like to hear more songs by CSNY, here’s the link to the article about piecing together the lost Human Highway album: https://ontherecords.net/2018/06/csny-human-highway-the-lost-album/"
