You become more aware of yourself as a body breathing. When thoughts or emotions come up, you observe them with curiosity, openness and acceptance. Then you bring your attention back to the present. Each moment is a new experience. You enter an intense state of relaxation and alertness.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the recording studio and producing hit records? According to Rick Rubin, a lot.\n\nRecording Studio: Rick Rubin Meditation"
