        "text": "To cultivate a creative mindset, start by embracing the process of making art.\n\nI watched an episode of 60 Minutes with Rick Rubin a few months ago. Rubin is a renowned music producer and is considered one of the most significant figures in hip-hop and pop music history. He has an unassuming presence. From his bare feet, long white beard, and unkept hair to his quiet manner, Rubin looks more like a roadie than a leader in his industry.\n\nRubin's discography is a veritable Who’s Who of music over the past five decades. He's produced rock, rap, hip hop, alternative, heavy metal, and country albums for the Beastie Boys, Run-DMC, Public Enemy, LL Cool JJ, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Tom Petty, Weezer, Kanye West, Metallica, Slayer, Wu-Tang Clan, Kid Rock, Adele, Justin Timberlake, Johnny Cash, and The Avett Brothers to name a few.\n\nDuring the interview, Rubin mentioned a book he wrote called The Creative Act: A Way of Being. I added the book to my Audible wish list where it waited until I had an opening between finishing the latest Stephen King novel and the release of Lee Child’s next Jack Reacher thriller.\n\nThe Creative Act is like ASMR for creatives. Rubin’s narration is mesmerizing. It’s a book that must be listened to to be fully appreciated. Rubin’s part Dalai Lama, part Yoda. Here’s a sampling of what I jotted down in my Notes app while listening on my walks:\n\nCreativity is a fundamental aspect of being human. It’s our birthright.\n\nTo create is to bring something into existence that wasn’t there before.\n\nThe imagination has no limits. The physical world does. The work exists in both.\n\nNot wanting to do the work (is) laziness.\n\nFailure is the information you need to get where you’re going.\n\nCriticism allows us to engage with our work in a new way. We may agree, or we may double down on our original instincts.\n\nTrust in the process.\n\nWhen we sit down to work, remember the outcome is out of our control. If we’re willing to take each step into the unknown with grit and determination, carrying with us all of our collective knowledge, we will ultimately get to where we’re going.\n\nArtists are ultimately craftspeople. Sometimes, our ideas come through bolts of lightning—other times, through effort, experiment, and craft. Without diligence, inspiration alone rarely yields work of consequence. Making great art may not always require great effort, but without it, you will never know.\n\nAnd finally, There is no wrong way to make art.\n\nPut another way, here are four takeaways from The Creative Act: A Way of Being:\n\n1. Creativity is a universal human capacity, not a rare talent.\n\nRubin emphasizes that creativity is not reserved for a select few but rather an inherent part of being human. He encourages everyone to tap into their creative potential and embrace the art-making process.\n\n2. The creative process is a journey of self-discovery and exploration.\n\nRubin describes creativity as a path to a more profound understanding of oneself and the world around us. He encourages individuals to embrace vulnerability, let go of preconceptions, and allow the creative flow to unfold naturally.\n\n3. Collaboration and diverse perspectives are essential for fostering creativity.\n\nRubin highlights the power of collaboration in sparking new ideas and challenging assumptions. He encourages individuals to seek diverse perspectives and engage with others from different backgrounds.\n\n4. Embrace the imperfections and challenges that arise along the creative journey.\n\nRubin emphasizes that mistakes and imperfections are inevitable and should be viewed as opportunities for growth rather than setbacks. He encourages individuals to persevere through setbacks and maintain a sense of playfulness and curiosity.\n\nThe Creative Act is a compass for navigating the creative process, guiding marketers seeking to foster a culture of innovation and produce exceptional work. Rubin's insights into the nature of creativity, the importance of collaboration, and the power of embracing vulnerability can help brands reach new heights."
