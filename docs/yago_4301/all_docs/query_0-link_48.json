        "text": "Run-DMC was an American hip hop group from Hollis, Queens, New York, founded in 1983. Regarded as one of the most influential acts in the history of hip hop culture and one of the most famous hip hop acts of the 1980s, along with Beastie Boys, LL Cool J and Public Enemy, the group pioneered new school hip hop music. Musically, they moved hip hop and rap music away from the funk and disco-oriented sound of its beginnings, into an altogether new and unique sonic imprint. Their sound is directly responsible for intentionally transforming rap music from dance-and club-oriented funk grooves to an aggressive, less-danceable approach characterized by sparse, hard-hitting beats that would form the foundation of hardcore hip hop (particularly hardcore East Coast hip hop). As such, Run-DMC is considered the originators of the style, and hardcore hip hop would dominate the next two decades of rap music, from the bombastic, noisy sound of Public Enemy and stripped minimalism of Boogie Down Productions to the thump of early Wu-Tang Clan and Nas. Their influence was not limited to the East Coast, however. Los Angeles’ N.W.A, on their landmark 1988 album Straight Outta Compton, showed heavy influences from Tougher Than Leather-era Run-DMC, and Chicano rap act Cypress Hill were definitely influenced by Run-DMC’s fusion of rap and rock. Tougher Than Leather is their fourth studio album, released on May 1988. The album was produced by the group members themselves, Davy D. and Rick Rubin, it obtained platinum status is now hailed as a seminal classic in hip-hop. Tougher Than Leather was accompanied by the release of a crime film of the same name by New Line Cinema with Rick Rubin as a director and starring Run-D.M.C. According to the plot Run-D.M.C. must find and punish the evil drug lord-record company executive who murdered their friend. Along the way, they encounter racist bikers, blonde bimbos, and the Beastie Boys. The film was released on VHS on September 16, 1988.\n\n180 gram Vinyl\n\nIncludes Download Code\n\nLabel: Arista\n\nCat. # 88985438251"
