        "text": "Many famed music producers are known for a particular sound that has its day and then ages out. Rick Rubin is known for something else: creating a space where artists of all different genres and traditions can hone in on who they really are and what they offer. He has made a practice of helping people transcend their self-imposed expectations to reconnect with a state of innocence from which the surprising becomes inevitable.\n\nOver the years, as he has thought deeply about where creativity comes from and where it doesn’t, he has learned that being an artist isn’t about your specific output; it’s about your relationship to the world. Creativity has a place in everyone’s life, and everyone can make that place larger. In fact, there are a few more important responsibilities.\n\nThe Creative Act is a beautiful and generous course of study that illuminates the path of the artist as a road we all can follow. It distils the wisdom gleaned from a lifetime’s work into a luminous reading experience that puts the power to create moments – and lifetimes – of exhilaration and transcendence within closer reach for all of us.\n\nTHE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER\n\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\n\nSHORTLISTED FOR THE WATERSTONES BOOK OF THE YEAR 2023\n\nSHORTLISTED FOR THE FOYLES NON-FICTION BOOK OF THE YEAR 2023\n\nAvailable via here\n\nRelated\n\nDiscover more from Decoded Magazine\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nRead Next\n\nBehind The Boosh 20 – a photography exhibition by Dave Brown aka Bollo\n\nFollowing successful exhibitions in Australia in the summer of 2023, Behind The Boosh 20, a photography…\n\nGlasgow Sub Club Dazzle Lager – made for dancing in collaboration with Brewgooder\n\nWorld-renowned electronic music venue Sub Club has teamed up with local brewer Brewgooder to create…\n\nBook of the Month – Ears To The Ground: Adventures in Field Recording and Electronic Music\n\nFrom the cacophonous surrounds of London to the sea stacks of Orkney, via the abandoned…\n\nBook of the Month – Darcus Beese autobiography – Rebel With A Cause\n\n‘Rebel With A Cause’ is the remarkable story of Darcus Beese: legendary music-industry executive, OBE…\n\nIntroducing: IbizaVinylClub – Vinyl addicts who are making a positive change for vulnerable children\n\nAt the IbizaVinylClub, the belief is that vinyl music is an art form that transcends age,…"
