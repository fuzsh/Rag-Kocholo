        "text": "Since 1984, Rick Rubin has been a king in the world of production. As of this year’s SXSW, the world will get a glimpse into his creative process. At the moment, the docu-series is loosely titled Shangri-La, after Rubin’s Malibu studio. Directed by Morgan Neville, the film features Rubin as executive producer alongside Neville and a host of others. Although Shangri-La will debut as a work in progress, Rolling Stone reports the finished show will be available to stream via Showtime later this year."
