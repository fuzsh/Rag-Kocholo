The album was produced by the group members themselves, Davy D. and Rick Rubin.\n\nWhile the new record did not maintain the same popularity as its predecessor, it obtained platinum status and spawned the favorites \"Run's House\" and \"Mary, Mary\". Despite being given a mixed reception at the time of its release, it is now hailed as a seminal classic in hip-hop and many see it as an underrated album.\n\nTougher Than Leather peaked at number 9 on the US Billboard 200, and number 2 on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA on July 19, 1988.[6]\n\nThe album features three the Billboard singles: \"Run's House\", \"Mary, Mary\" and \"I'm Not Going Out Like That\". \"Run's House\" and \"Mary, Mary\" also hit the UK Singles Chart.[7]\n\nThe album was reissued by Arista Records in 1999 and 2003. An expanded and remastered edition was released in 2005 and contained 4 previously unreleased songs.[8]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe platinum-selling album, a follow-up to the group's big commercial breakthrough album 1986's Raising Hell, featured some of the group's classics like \"Run's House\", \"Beats to the Rhyme\", and a cover of The Monkees's \"Mary, Mary\". Tougher Than Leather was the group's fourth effort and blended in elements of not only rap but also rock n' roll and funk, making it their most varied effort to date alongside King of Rock. \"Papa Crazy\" is based on \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\" by The Temptations. The album was recorded at 5 studios in New York City: Chung King House Of Metal, Unique Recording Studios, Inc., Electric Lady Studios, Ian London Studios, Greene St. Recording.\n\nIn response to albums such as Eric B. & Rakim's Paid In Full, Public Enemy's It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back, and Boogie Down Productions' Criminal Minded and By All Means Necessary, the group made a distinct departure from their earlier work, as Jam-Master Jay used a heavier amount of sampling.[citation needed]\n\nRun and DMC also made changes in their rapping style (heavily influenced by Rakim) as techniques such as alliteration, polysyllabic rhyming, and internal rhyme are found in songs like \"I'm Not Going Out Like That,\" \"Radio Station\", and the title track. The group also introduces storytelling to their arsenal in \"Ragtime\". Despite this, Run-D.M.C. does not abandon their formula of combining hip-hop beats with hard rock guitar riffs, using it in \"Miss Elaine\", the title track, \"Soul To Rock And Roll\", and \"Mary, Mary\".\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nThe album was accompanied by the release of a crime film of the same name by New Line Cinema with Rick Rubin as a director and starring Run-D.M.C. According to the plot Run-D.M.C. must find and punish the evil drug lord-record company executive who murdered their friend. Along the way, they encounter racist bikers, blonde bimbos, and the Beastie Boys. The film was released on September 16, 1988, and was panned by critics.[9][10]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe information about samples was taken from WhoSampled.[11]\n\n# Title Samples Length 1 \"Run's House\"\n\nThe Soul Searchers – \"Ashley's Roachclip\" (1974)\n\nJames Brown – \"Funky Drummer\" (1970)\n\n3:49 2 \"Mary, Mary\"\n\nThe Monkees – \"Mary, Mary\" (1966)\n\nJohn Davis and the Monster Orchestra – \"I Can't Stop\" (1976)\n\nCover version of the song: The Monkees – \"Mary, Mary\" (1967)\n\n3:12 3 \"They Call Us Run-D.M.C.\"\n\nDoug E.
