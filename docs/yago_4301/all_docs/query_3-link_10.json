        "text": "When they started, there was no such thing as heavy metal and it feels like the whole genre is based on 'Black Sabbath'. It may not always have sounded the same, and it's gone through a lot of changes, and there's a lot of really interesting metal that sounds like 'Black Sabbath'. But it feels like they were probably the first with the idea that this dark, heavy music could be the whole trip.\n\nI've gotten to work with amazing people. I would say usually we get to a point before we get into the studio where there isn't that sense of anxiety or nervousness of who they are because I don't think it would be as productive in the studio if that was the case. But maybe meeting someone like Neil Young for the first time made me anxious."
