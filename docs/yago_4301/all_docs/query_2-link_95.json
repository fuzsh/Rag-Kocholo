        "text": "This event has ended.\n\nGallery 151 presents Tougher Thanâ¦, by photographer Sebastian Piras. Exhibiting his collection of personal photographs from the summer of 1986 in New York City for the first time, Piras will offer a view into his time working on Def Jamâs 1988 film âTougher Than Leatherâ, directed by Rick Rubin. Featuring rare photographs of Run, D.M.C., Jam Master Jay, the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, and other hip hop artists of the era, Tougher Thanâ¦ will also include a video installation of Pirasâ 2012 interview with Ric Menello, coÂ­writer of the movie together with Rick Rubin. Gallery 151 and Sebastian Piras will release an exhibition catalogue in the form of a magazine titled NYC86, featuring exclusive interviews from those involved in âTougher Than Leatherâ.\n\nâTougher Than Leatherâ, starring RunÂ­D.M.C, follows the group as they seek justice for a murdered friend, meeting a cast of oddballs, racists, and the Beastie Boys. Piras had just moved to New York City from London and was operating out of his apartment on Elizabeth street when he became involved in Rubinâs film. As still photographer, Piras had unparalleled access that allowed him to produce these intimate portraits and candid photographs of the cast and crew of this camp classic. In addition to these pictures from the set of âTougher Than Leatherâ, Pirasâ photographs from 1986, including portraits of Robert Mapplethorpe, Andy Warhol, and the landscape of New York City will provide viewers with a time machine to 1986. While much has changed in the last 27 years, his images show some familiar landmarks, like Bar Milano on Houston or the NoHo star on Bleeker. This important exhibition will extend beyond a simple behind the scenes document and show a fresh and vibrant view of New York City and hip hop in 1986.\n\nSebastian Piras has lived and worked in New York since 1985. He is recognized internationally as an acclaimed portrait artist and has also worked in film for many years. He recently released a monograph of portraits of artists in their studios titled A Pocketful of Contemporary Artists. In the bookâs introduction David Ross, former director of the Whitney Museum, wrote Pirasâ work offers âprobing and extraordinarily beautiful portraits of artistsâ¦ that ultimately produces winners at both ends of the camera.â\n\nCurated by Michael Namer & The City Firm\n\nMedia"
