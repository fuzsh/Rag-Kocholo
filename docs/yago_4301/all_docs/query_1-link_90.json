        "text": "Hidden Treasures on eBay\n\nUntil a few years ago, I was under the impression that eBay was all about bidding, something for which I haven’t the energy, the interest, or the patience. I just can’t be bothered. But when a friend asked for my opinion on an item she wanted on eBay, she sent me the link. Though I didn’t care for what she was considering, I did like the “Buy It Now” option, which I’d just noticed for the first time. And with that, eBay became a terrific resource for things I couldn’t find anywhere else.\n\nSince then, I’ve found some of my most treasured possessions there. The first thing that comes to mind is what I call my “signature” horn-rimmed eyeglasses, which were made by Oliver Peoples sometime in the early 2010s. They are long out of production, but a black pair popped up in a search. I bought them and loved them so much that I snapped up a second pair in tortoise. Back in the day, Oliver Peoples sold these frames for around $400 a pair. I got mine (both in brand-new condition) for around $100 each."
