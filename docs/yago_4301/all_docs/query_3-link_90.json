        "text": "Two titans of the music business are coming together for a TV project.\n\nPaul McCartney and Rick Rubin will be featured in a six-episode docuseries about McCartney’s long and massively influential career, from his pre-Beatles days to the present. The project doesn’t have a home yet, with Endeavor Content financing and taking the project to potential buyers.\n\nThe series will also feature master tapes from a number of Beatles recordings, with the masters leaving Abbey Road Studios for the first time.\n\nMcCartney teased the project on social media and in a YouTube video (watch it below) on Wednesday. Frank Marshall, who directed HBO’s well-reviewed documentary The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart, is producing with Kennedy/Marshall and Film 45. Jeff Pollack (Netflix’s Rhythm & Flow, Epix’s Laurel Canyon) is executive producing.\n\nThe announcement comes two days before McCartney’s newest solo album, McCartney III, is released on Friday.\n\nMcCartney and the Beatles have been the subject of countless documentary projects in the past; some recent efforts include 2016’s Eight Days a Week — The Touring Years and 2019’s The Cavern Club: The Beat Goes On. Rubin was at the center of Showtime’s four-part series Shangri-La last year (and was also an executive producer).\n\nDeadline first reported the news."
