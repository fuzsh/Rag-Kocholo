        "text": "When Russell Simmons talks about the explosive popularity of rap music across America, the one theme he comes back to again and again is image.\n\n''In black America, your neighbor is much more likely to be someone like L.L. Cool J or Oran 'Juice' Jones than Bill Cosby,'' the 29-year-old founder and owner of Rush Productions, the music industry's most successful rap-artist management company, said last week. ''A lot of the black stars being developed by record companies have images that are so untouchable that kids just don't relate to them. Our acts are people with strong, colorful images that urban kids already know, because they live next door to them. If some of those images glorify an outlaw pose, it's just kids having fun.''\n\nFrom a shoestring operation four years ago, Mr. Simmons's company has grown into a multimillion-dollar enterprise that manages some two dozen acts and has its own movie division. At the top of its artist roster are Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys, whose ''Raising Hell'' and ''Licensed to Ill'' albums have each sold 3.5 million copies. Six albums by Rush-managed artists are currently listed on Billboard's black album chart, with L.L. Cool J's ''Bigger and Deffer'' at No. 1. Along with the 24-year-old record producer, Rick Rubin, Mr. Simmons also co-owns Def Jam Records, the Columbia-distributed label to which both the Beastie Boys and L.L. Cool J are signed. Tour Comes to New York\n\n''Bigger and Deffer,'' has sold 1.2 million albums in just two months, and a hit single, ''I Need Love,'' has crossed over into the pop market to become the first top-40 rap ballad. ''I Need Love'' is expected to push sales of the album past the 2 million mark. Run-D.M.C. recently signed a $2 million deal with Adidas, whose products they had already celebrated in their song, ''My Adidas.'' It is the first such deal the company has made with a non-athlete.\n\nThis Monday, the Run-D.M.C.-Beastie Boys ''Together Forever'' tour finally arrives at Madison Square Garden. And next month, at a date to be announced, a second package tour of rap acts headlined by L.L. Cool J, will hit New York. The two tours have generated a considerable amount of public hand-wringing by city fathers around the country concerned with obscenity. In Columbus, Ga., last week, L.L. Cool J was charged with public lewdness and fined $250 for his sexual pantomime during ''I Need Love.'' And in Jacksonville, Fla., an ordinance was passed requiring the Beastie Boys to print warnings about the supposedly obscene nature of their show on their tickets.\n\nAt a recent visit to Rush Productions' new headquarters - a five-story building on Elizabeth Street in lower Manhattan - the offices reflected the company's state of rapid, chaotic growth. The narrow stairs were crowded with packing crates. Recording equipment was being moved into the building, and the place was crawling with painters and technicians.
