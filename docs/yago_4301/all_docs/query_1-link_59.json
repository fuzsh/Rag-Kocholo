        "text": "Heckelgruber said:\n\nI agree. In 1986 Master of Puppets was an exciting album, but I guess that would not be the case now. Reign in Blood is the same - same year, and Slayer's style has been ripped off so much that it risks diminishing the original. I don't listen to Metallica any more, more just fondly remember them.\n\nStill into Slayer though.\n\nIndeed. When I first heard Master Of Puppets it in 1988, I was blown away. That was also the year that ...And Justice For All came out. I was hooked on Met by then. I'm hoping that bringing Rubin in will help them produce a quality metal album. St. Anger was probably the worst album I've ever heard. I actually threw it out the car window a while back.\n\nI just hope that they can write some good music. Without that, the producer can only do so much. Rubin has worked wonders with System of a Down though, so my hopes are high for the Mighty Met.\n\nWell, heres some info on the new album.\n\nMETALLICA's Lars Ulrich has exclusively revealed to Kerrang! magazine that the band's new material has an \"old-school\" METALLICA flavor.\n\nThe metal legends are currently working on the follow-up to 2003's \"St. Anger\" in their own studio at METALLICA HQ in San Rafael, California.\n\n\"The last album was an unusual METALLICA album in that no one brought ideas into the studio. Everything you hear on that album was given birth to in the studio,\" the drummer notes. \"This time around we've each brought in ideas as we used to 혰 as well as working on some jams we had from from two summers ago 혰 and James [Hetfield] and I are sorting through our CDs of riffs to put together stuff as we did back in the day.\n\n\"The new stuff is much more organic, more old school. It certainly doesn't feel like 'St. Anger' Part Two,\" Ulrich adds. \"When we were rehearsing for our South African shows and started playing the 'St. Anger' stuff, it definitely felt very different to the rest of the set because of how the songs were put together. It was really important to make that record in the way we did because of the chaotic internal vibe at that time: 'St. Anger' was a statement, 55 minutes of brutality packed onto a CD, proving to ourselves that we still had the spark. 'St. Anger' was fun but we don't need to make that album again.\"\n\nUlrich says that the band have six or seven songs nearing completion, minus vocals and they are using producer Rick Rubin, famed for his work with RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, SYSTEM OF A DOWN and SLAYER, for the first time. This collaboration marks the end of the quartet's 15-year relationship with producer Bob Rock, but Ulrich insists the split was drama free.\n\n\"We had a great time with Bob,\" he admits. \"But it seemed that after 15 years it was time to try some different things and get a different perspective. As you get older you get set in your ways and get very fucking spoilt. It was important for as to not get stuck. Rick makes everything 혰 he sees the big picture and has big ideas. It's working out great. We're excited hearing shit come together!\"\n\nMETALLICA's as-yet-untitled album is expected in early 2007.\n\nZivilyn said:\n\nHm, Linkin Park, that's gonna be a well produced bad album. Linkin Park is annoying and doesn't have good musicians, but they sometimes come out with a decent sounding song.\n\nbut for the uninformed, here's a list of what he's done so far and a few of what he's planning on doing, taken from wikipedia\n\nRadio - LL Cool J (1985)\n\nLicensed to Ill - Beastie Boys (1986)\n\nRaising Hell - Run-D.M.C.

Not everything is going to appeal to the ones who know him from stuff like slayer and Danzig.\n\nI'd be more concerned with Justin Timberlake than Linkin Park.\n\nAs for Metallica, it's gonna be more up to them than Rick Rubin.\n\n7 albums in 2005?\n\nI may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure he didn't produce Master of Puppets. Kid Rock is still making albums? Eeeeewwwwwww."
