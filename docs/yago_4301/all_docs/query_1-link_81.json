To borrow a line usually attributed to James Bond: men wanted to be him; women wanted to be with him.\n\nIt may seem ludicrous now, as an entire generation knows him mostly as an actor and host, but there was a time when LL was the most feared rapper on the planet. Then he became the most desirable. And, for a short time, he was the best.\n\n“LL Cool J is hard as hell”"
