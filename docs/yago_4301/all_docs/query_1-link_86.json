        "text": "It was the Scratch that drew me to rap music. Being a wee young lad living in the soon-to-be large city of Tel-Aviv I remember that the scratch is what hit me first. When my virgin ears first heard the sounds of rap music I was amazed at the booming bass, the banging thuds of the back beat, and the intensity of the rapper, or rappers if it was a crew. However, what really drew me to the difference of this music was the cut, the scratch, the moment best translated to the rock gods as an ill guitar solo a la Eddie Van Halen or Jimi Hendrix. As an avid music lover I get the same sensation when hearing a great scratch sequence as when I hear an aria from Mozart’s “The Magic Flute.” This feeling of elation and spiritual elevation when the music hits you with that pure moment of beauty is how I feel it. I know that some don’t agree, but music lovers understand that feeling deep in your core when you hear that celestial sound coming from your favorite group. The talent of the DJ on these rap records was just as important as the rapper because it held a pristine balance that was lost when rap hit the big time in the late 1990’s. I remember it because the 1980’s, especially with the start of Def Jam, and the early 1990’s the authentic was heard through the guise of an MC, DJ, two turntables and a microphone.\n\nThe history of Hip-Hop culture surrounded the DJ. The culture began with parties in recreation centers, high school gyms, and later parks surrounded by apartment complexes. This was a natural extension of what they learned from their parents parties growing up. Who was the focus? The focus was on getting down on the dance floor, which relied on the music, which all relied on one person, The DJ. The DJ was the focal point in the start of Hip-Hop and remained the focus, even after the emergence of the early rap groups, until the music began being recorded in 1979. One of these defining moments was the recording of “The Message” by Grandmaster Flash the Furious Five. Although none of the MC’s were on the record except for Melle Mel, Flash was nowhere to be heard. Like earlier recordings Flash, the legendary DJ pioneer and innovator was pushed to the side.\n\nThis didn’t necessarily mean that the DJ was dead, because there were a few recordings that acknowledged the DJ. One of the best is Flash’s masterpiece of a record titled “The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash On the Wheels of Steel” from 1981.\n\nThis was an amazing record because it was one of the first DJ records on Sugar Hill Records, and he did it all by hand. There was no digital sequencing so he had to find the time on the record and mix it all by ear and hand. Flash should get so much credit as he invented some of these techniques.He and the many DJ’s who were lost should receive plenty of accolades and honor for their innovations. So, a big ups to Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaata (who along with Flash are the founding fathers of Hip-Hop), Disco King Mario (The sound system man), Grand Wizard Theodore (Inventor, or accidental find of the scratch), Jazzy Jay (Zulu alumni and the DJ who started Def Jam), Grandmaster D.ST (Way out in outer space hanging with Herbie Hancock), Whiz Kid (parter of Caz and a funny guy, just watch him on the VH1 doc NY77: The Coolest Year in Hell), Afrika Islam (Sharp on the cut and DJ for Law & Order MC Ice-T), Breakout (who is forgotten but held down a part of the Bronx along with the founding fathers), Charlie Chase (Cold Crush fame and first of the great Latino DJ’s), AJ Scratch (down with Kenny G and Lovebug Starski, and another DJ for Cold Crush), Johnny Thunderbird (Harlem disco and R&B head), Lovebug Starski (The multifaceted entertainer who could do R&B or Hip-Hop, one of the few renaissance men of Hip-Hop), Hollywood (contemporary of the legendary Pete DJ Jones, who played in Manhattan and is another slept on pioneer. He also had one of the first MC’s, like Coke La Rock for Kool Herc, by the cool name of Eddie Cheeba), Gradmaster Flowers (The best sound system heard playing the bomb disco beats out of Brooklyn, RIP), and of course everyone’s favorite Kiss FM DJ Kool DJ Red Alert.\n\nWithout further ado, here’s my top ten list of the best tracks with the best scratch breakdown, or use of the tables in a superior manner. These are the top ten, but in no specific order as they all totally rule!!! Please be advised that it’s a bit subjective, but I don’t care.\n\n10. “Doper Skiller” – Viktor Vaughn feat. Kool Keith off of his VV2: Venomous Villain album.\n\nComing off the first Viktor Vaughn album, this track from the sequal (which surprisingly banged as hard as the first album) is great. The fact that you have Doom and Kool Keith on the same track is like listening to a late night chat between Rasputin and Nostradamus. To top it all off you had this scratch down which is amazing, and done by the producer (?) by the name of DiViNCi.\n\n9. “End to End Burners” – Company Flow, single released on the heels of their first classic Funcrusher Plus.\n\nGreat track and the DJ, Mr. Len cuts it up nice. It’s even better with the video because he swipes his hands like a wizard bubbling up something wicked.\n\n8. “Blue Flowers” – Dr. Octagon from his masterpiece album, Dr. Octagonecologyst.\n\nI can never get enough of Kool Keith and it’s not his fault that he’s worked with some great DJ’s. This album, produced by heavy-weight drum taster Dan the Automator, is bizarre, experimental, and far out of this world. Also, DJ Qbert, legendary scratch DJ in his own right, kills it as you can hear.\n\n7. “Ugly People Be Quiet” – Cash Money and Marvelous, off of their Where’s the Party At? album from 1988.\n\nDJ Cash Money should have been mentioned with the list of pioneers above. He’s an amazingly talented, and award-winning, DJ out of Philly, and this is an example of his prowess.\n\n6. “On & On & On” – Dungeon Family, off of their seminal powerhouse of an album Even In Darkness.\n\nGreat track off the family album which includes the Goodie Mob, Outkast, and more. This track is essentially a Goodie Mob hit with Big Gipp, T-Mo, and Khujo from the MOB along with Witchdoctor and Big Boi from Outkast.\n\n5. “Alive” – The Beastie Boys, an unreleased track that appeared on their boxed set titled, Beastie Boys Anthology: The Sounds of Science.\n\nI know that since the Beastie Boys picked up Mixmaster Mike that you can pick other notable tracks. However, the second chorus part (at the 2 minute mark to be anally precise) where he spins KRS-ONE hollering, “Bring it back that old New York rap!!!” is my kind of anthem.\n\n4. “Who’s Gonna Take the Weight?” – Gangstarr, from their second album titled, Step Into the Arena.\n\nThis is another dispute because the group consisting of the man, the myth, the holy legend of scratching by the name of DJ Premier, should have other picks. However, this track hits the head with the piercing beat throughout the song, and Premier just adds the singer to the song with his tables. You – Can’t – Handle – The – Whole Weight……..cut!\n\n3. “Madness” – Deltron 3030 from the album titled 3030.\n\nThis is not so much a chop down for the breakdown, but why not veer away from categorization? Deltron, consisting of Del the Funky Homosapian, Dan the Automator on the boards, and Kid Koala on the tables, is an unconventional and criminally slept on album from the turn of the century. Kid Koala’s work is genius in the way he uses the tables as an instrument, via the sounds of the trumpet. Like the cool darkly lit rooms of Jazz, this is the same only light years away in a far off galaxy.\n\n2. “Rebel Without a Pause” – Public Enemy from their masterpiece, that should be mandatory high school listening titled, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back, circa 1988.\n\nThis is THE group, consisting of the fiery verse spitting Chuck D. and the court jestering of Flavor Flav, the S1W’s, and the hard-hitting beats of the Bomb Squad – you know they got the best DJ – Terminator X. The mysterious DJ behind the huge sunglasses cuts it the hardest on this track as Chuck screams his name he cuts it up like a funky drummer.\n\n1. “Interview With Colored Man” – Rob Swift Feat. Supernatural & DJ Radar, from Rob Swift’s album titled, Sound Event.\n\nThis, hands down, is one of my personal favorites and I feel one of the best rap songs of all time. It has all the key ingredients with one of the best DJ’s, Rob Swift, and a helping hand with DJ Radar along with one of the most underrated battle rappers of all time, who never got his justice on wax, by the name of Supernatural. The cuts play along with the interviewers words, but they also carry the tempo while Supernatural weaves his tales of the adventures and life of the super hero known as Colored Man.\n\nIt’s a biting commentary on how non-blacks view black men as both dangerous, mysterious and exotic beings. These images are strewn throughout popular culture, and remain in the white psyche to this day. Interestingly enough it reminds me of one of my family’s most favorite Richard Pryor albums with the same idea titled….\n\nEnjoy the cutting and scratching and I’ll see you in the next dispatch,\n\nPeace\n\n#ViktorVaughn #CompanyFlow #Dr.Octagon #DJCashMoney #DungeonFamily #BeastieBoys #Gangstarr #Deltron3030 #PublicEnemy #RobSwift #MCSupernatural\n\nHistory should have the force to slap you smack in the face, seeing your body hit the pavement hard, and then it spits in your eye just when you thought it was safe to look. In my history classes I try to teach history as a full on onslaught onto my student’s senses. History losses some of its brute force when put down to paper, where the writing is so think and dense that any student could get lost. However, there have been new methods of presenting history to the masses which holds both the education quality as well as entertainment value. In the realm of Hip-Hop it is even more pressing to show these new methods of history writing, and even presenting history. Hip-Hop is so tightly bound to our veins at this point that its origins have reached a critical mass of mythology. These stories of the early generation of Hip-Hop innovators are so far fetched, amazing, indecipherable (try to read Russell Simmons or Alonzo Williams’ words), that they can only be shown in a particular form. Many blog posts ago I reviewed the comic/history book written, researched, and illustrated by the great Ed Piskor. The first volume took us back, via the Deloreun’s boost from the flux capacitor, to the late 1970’s and ending in early 1981. For the details please refer back to that review, but for now it’s time to sink our teeth into volume 2!!!\n\nLike the first volume our humble director of traffic, in the guise of Ed Piskor, leads us through these amazingly colorful corridors. He recounst many key events in the history of Hip-Hop, as well as the many fascinating side comments, far-out factoids, and some comedic side notes, as well as one or two tragic. It all begins with the story of Doug E. Fresh and how he was discovered in his native Harlem neighborhood by the one and only rapper by the name of Spoonie Gee. Spoonie, who was Doug E.’s neighbor, according to the story presented shows him his talents, as his beatboxing skills are reinterpreted through the wizardry of comic book wordings. With larger than life lettering you see the “BOOM BOMP, BA-CLICK OOMP!” coming out of Doug E.’s mouth. The entire pages, and its panels, show the skills as they waift through the crowd and eventually get to Spoonie’s uncle, and owner of Enjoy Records, Bobby Robinson.\n\nThe book continues to overemphasize the lyrics, by making them loom large over the rest of the cell that is trying to contain these words. Another fine example, displaying the sheer energy of the words, is see through the eyes of Malcolm McLaren being introduced to the Zulu nation in the Bronx River Projects. The words “Zulu Gestapo” loom large, as the cell provides the feel being somewhat askew and distorted. The cells on the page are shaky, which is probably how you felt in the midst of the chaos of dancing and fighting while the speakers are on full blast, shaking your kidneys from side to side. Piskor is trying to show us the energy of these jams, and the magnetically beautiful chaos surrounding these parties.\n\nThere are many more references he uses, as well as overlying themes about the music and its culture, as he fills in details of known stories. One theme he uses, through the connection with Rick Rubin and the very young Beastie Boys, is the connection between Rap music and Punk music in the early days. This volume spans from the years 1981 to 1983 where both genres had the same connective tissue of do-it-yourself, while eschewing the conventional sounds. It was Rick Rubin who brought that idea to rap, which would forever change the way artists recorded rap music after Def Jam came into existence. The Punk aesthetic isn’t lost on the readers as Piskor shows us how these worlds collided at times into one.\n\nThe Punk aesthetic isn’t lost on the readers as Piskor shows us how these worlds collided at times into one. Other examples of this include the clubs themselves in the downtown Manhattan scene, which included the Hip-Hop heads and the Punks.\n\nPiskor is also very aware of the earliest days of Hip-Hop and how DJ’s who would play records would have to play breakbeats as rap wasn’t being recorded yet. Early rap recordings had live instrumentation, akin to the Disco sound, where the performance became obscured by an older form of recording songs. One of the very crucial elemenst to the brith of Hip-Hop is the emphasis on the DJ, and how famous DJ’s like Kool Herc, Flash, and Bambaata dug deep for obscure up tempo songs, or at least a small section of the song that people can dance to. Piskor, being an amazing researcher as well as illustrator, shows this with a quick backstory to one of the most popular songs equated with the era, the Incredible Bongo Band’s “Apache.” He traces the origins of the song to its creation by Jerry Lordon of the Shadows,\n\nto its later incarnation by the Bongo Band,\n\nhow it went into obscurity and remained there until DJ Kool Herc began to play it at his parties. Many groups sampled it for their songs including an instrumental track Grandmaster Flash concocted and released by Sugar Hill Records. This is another example of Hip-Hop culture’s far reach into the past, and not necessarily an exclusively black past, but rather a shared musical past.\n\nHe also attempt to show how raw some of these rap groups performances were as opposed to their recorded material. One of the best live performaces of the past, and a dear personal favorite of mine, is Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five’s live rendition of “Flash to the Beat.” Interestingly enough Piskor shows that they were invited to perform live at the Bronx River Projects by Afrika Bambatta, with the help of a new gizmo Flash recently acquired he called a beat box, but was actually a drum machine. In the book Piskor notes a cloud over Bambaata as he says to himself that he was, “glad I’m recording this…” Here’s a version to listen to,\n\nThis is a perfect time capsule showing us how great these guys were when performing live. Apparently, according to Piskor’s account, the tape was leaked (either through theft, commerce, or trading) and circulated throughout New York City. It’s a treasure of a primary source because you hear the call and response between the members of the crew, capturing this moment of time that was lost for good. Piskor wrote it best saying that, “The bootleg (talking about this recording) is a multi-generation duplicate. It’s gritty. You can hear all sorts of residual noise. It’s far from perfect, but it might be one of the greatest snapshots of Hip Hop Before the music became bis business.” (Page. 34).\n\nI will not recount the stories, cause you should check them out on your own, but Piskor also has a gift in showing many things through these images. Not only are we seeing a story unfold, we’re also seeing other themes and trends that Hip Hop both created, destroyed, or compromised. One of these themes is the generational divide within the African-American community when it came to rap music, both recording and playing it on the radio airwaves. There are many telling scenes speaking of this divide, and even negative attitudes held by the older black generation towards this new music. He cites one of the most popular DJ’s, Frankie “Hollywood” Crocker (Note that DJ Hollywood took his name from Crocker), saying that there was no money in it due to the kids being broke. Another example is the exchange between the Furious Five and a disgruntled baseball player, Willie Stargell, and how he berated them for using nasty language while grabbing themselves onstage.\n\nFirst the great, and Piskor makes sure to show his immense presence, Melle Mel chimes in saying that that is exactly what they are, while the group all chime in saying (with bold letters) “We Nasty!”\n\nHip-Hop history has short arcs as well as long arcs spanning years, even decades. The book is very well balanced showing the specific stories happening at that specific time frame, like the creation of the first Hip-Hop film, Wild Style. These little stories form the details about the history of the early years of Hip-Hop, and recorded rap music. However, Piskor also foreshadows stories or begins them and then stops in order to keep the avid fan waiting for the rest of the story. He does this with groups like Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys and how they evolved from scrappy youngsters meeting the people ( or in the case of Run-DMC being related to) who would jump start their careers. Piskor is also not fixated on the east coast as he does the same with up and coming artists, who are just getting their first taste of success, like young Dr. Dre and DJ Yella, and Ice-T. Interestingly enough the end of this volume show us the start of what we know as the group Run-DMC and the start of Dre’s push to the limelight.\n\nAlso, speaking of Dre and Run-DMC, Piskor shows us how Run-DMC’s performance in 1983 at the Cali club Eve After Dark influenced Dre immensly. They only performed for ten minutes, but those ten minutes were hard, raw, and packed with stripped down rage. Piskor writes that Dre says that, “I wanna make some street level shit like them dudes.” While Dre was being influenced by Run-DMC, Chuck D. and his mobile DJ group called Spectrum City pop up from time to time. He was briefly featured in volume one, and in volume two we get a sense of the type of music influencing his ears. He was far more politically inclined, as most rap music was far from political, so he gravitated towards these songs. There are not many but Piskor points them out beginning with Brother D with the Collective’s song “How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise,” and of course “The Message” by Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five, and in this volume the reworking of a Malcolm X speech by the session musicians at Sugar Hill Records. Keith Leblanc, along with Doug Wimbish played over the words of the late Malcolm X. The song faded quickly from the radio, but certain ears heard it. One pair was that of Chuck D.’s, and after seeing how black youth have forgotten Malcolm X he decided to step in and make sure that brothers are gonna work it out.\n\nFor all us Hip-Hop history lovers we all know what will happen next. However, I can’t wait for Piskor to guide my vision in that realm.\n\nPeace\n\n#EdPiskor #HipHopFamilyTree2 #HipHopFamilyTree #Apache\n\nDuring my research for my last blog post, about the immortal Gangstarr album Hard to Earn, I happened to come upon some interesting classics. When I wrote on the scene making song “THe Planet” off the Gangstarr album I saw that they sampled “Holy War (Live)” by the rap group called Divine Force. The fact that their name, Divine Force, and the title of the song, “Holy War,” are together is of no coincidence. Once I saw these titles, as well as the label name my biblical alarm bells began to ring and jingle, LL Cool J style. The group was signed to an independent record label owned by the Funky President Melquan, and the name of the label is Yamak-ka Records Inc. It might be a play on certain words, or a reference to an ancient code, or an in-joke that no one will know unless we ask the owner. However, to a simple Jew like myself it was clear that it looked like the yiddish word for Jewish headgear, or as well call it in Hebrew a Kippah.\n\nThe song is a live recording of the MC ripping through his routine, with sheer raw energy. However, what caught my ear is what he says by the 1minute and 20 second mark where he rhymes, “Let me snap your fingers all wiggle, scream shout or laugh or just giggle, Shake that body, body, that body, don’t f#%k with me you’ll feel sorry, that’s word, I’m not the herb, understand what I’m saying.” The Wu flag rose high as I realized that this was a line used by Ghostface Killah on the song “Mighty Healthy” from his masterpiece of an album Supreme Clientele. Just take a listen and the words coincide……\n\nGhostface glides through his words with such skill and razor-sharp precision. Remarkably he drops the same line from the Divine Force track at the 1 minute and 20 second mark, gotta love the spread of history from a track recorded in 1987 to a track recorded in 2000.\n\nAnother great record made in the 1980’s is the classic, and heavily sampled, “Buffalo Girls” by Malcolm McLaren. This British ginger Jew had quite an extensive history including managing the New York Dolls in their last throes (that;s their last two weeks to be exact), and would later assemble the iconic English Punk outfit The Sex Pistols. After all of that he remained on the pulse, and close to the newest music and fashions coming out of New York City. He immersed himself in the scene and like most of the other young Jews he felt at ease working with young African-American DJ’s and artists like Afrika Bambaata and the Zulu Nation. The track is a pastiche of early hip-hop beats and sounds, that would be duplicated throughout the decade. The track made by him and the World Famous Supreme Team combines the fresh sounds with this video to the song, which was released in 1982.\n\nThe interesting part is the catchy introduction where McLaren hollers out “Buffalo girl go around the outside, around the outside, around the outside…..two buffalo girls go around the outside, around the outside, around the outside.” This line would be used two years later by the World Famous Supreme Team on their hit “Hey DJ,”\n\nwhere they use the same holler “First Buffalo girl, go around the outside.” However, the words rang very clear when I heard. or rather saw, this by Eminem.\n\nEminem pays homage to the McLaren line when he holler out in the beginning of the song, “Two trailer park girls go round the outside, round the outside, round the outside.” We just made a historical leap showing that it not only the snippets of music sampled that convey the deep historical roots of Hip-Hop. This is no coincidence as these artists and producers are extremely aware of their musical history. So much so that the great, and production wise criminally underrated, group The Beatnuts dropped on their first EP an intro as an ode to the World Famous Supreme Team.\n\nI also recall the use of specific choruses as a throwback to past artists. One of the most underrated albums, and mastermind producers, that I hold near and dear to this day is Prince Paul’s concept album from back in 1999. It’s an amazing day in the life of a young cat trying to rise up in the game, yet only to be done in by his so-called best friend. The album has many great guest spots, spanning from the heavy Chubb Rock to Biz Markie, and from Kool Keith to Mr. X to the Z Xzibit. One of the best songs is an early phone call to his girlfriend by the name of “The Other Line.”\n\nIt’s a great narrative where his girl is caught up again in the repetition of calling out for him from work. As each rapper goes back and forth you feel the stress of the girlfriend as she relents once again. When I first heard it my ear caught the last section where a chorus is sung out by a few guys saying “someone is calling my phone, someone is ringing my bell, someone is ringing my bell, etc.” The past slapped me square in the face as I went searching for that snippet I knew I heard before. It was only after listening to one of my favorite stations, Beatles Radio, where the divine gave me the answer.\n\nThank you Wings, or Paul McCartney for that matter, just listen to the track and you can draw comparisons.\n\nAs I noted earlier, Ghostface Killah brought us back to the Divine Force lyrics, and Ghostdini has a talent in fashioning his songs as a current blast from the past. Very few rappers out there cannot even fathom to feed our eras with both talent and wisdom. The last one I want to focus on is KRS-One, who is one of these grand purveyors of the culture. I want to point to a lesson of his, meaning a track that replicates these lyrics in such a great style. Hear is “Hip Hop vs. Rap.”\n\nKRS starts out by giving us, the listeners some time to feel the beat, sway our heads, and drop a rhyme if we have the time. He then raps about the differences between Hip Hop and Rap, basically Rap being a style and Hip Hop being a true way of life. He then starts flipping beats, but mostly lyrics of classic rap songs of days past. He even cites his own classic “MC’s Act Like They Don’t Know” and even dropped some mad obscure references that even this historian couldn’t get. He dropped the line “Frisco Disco, the disc is like Nabisco, Chocolate chip cookie, don’t fuck with me rookie,” where he’s speaking of the 1970’s single “Frisco Disco” by the group Eastside Connection. No one might remember how it sounds like, but it’s most famous for being sampled by Slick Rick for his song “Mona Lisa.” By the second half of his lyrics each stance is a replicated series of words, or sayings, by many popular rappers and musicians. If you look down the list he begins with…\n\n“So this DJ, he gets down, Mixing records while they go…” is from Jimmy Spicer’s magnum opus “Adventures of Super Rhyme” from 1980.\n\n“Round and round, round we go…” is from Tupac’s “I Get Around.”\n\n“Two Years ago a friend of mine…” is from Run-DMC’s “Sucker MC’s.”\n\n“And Flash is gonna rock your mind…” is from Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five’s “Freedom.”\n\n“Welcome to the terror dome, the terror dome…” is from Public Enemy’s “Welcome to the Terrordome.”\n\n“I wonder if I take you home…..” is from Lisa Lisa and the Cult Jam’s “I Wonder If I Take you Home.”\n\n“E-F-F-E-C-T, A cool operator operating correctly….” is from Eric B. & Rakim’s “Microphone Fiend.”\n\nAnd on and on it goes until he finishes off with “You ain’t fresh, you ain’t fresh, you ain’t,” thanks to the line from The Boogie Boys song “You Ain’t Fresh.”\n\nThe point made is that for all of its detractors, Hip Hop is the only music where you can literally hear the past come alive, either through a sample or through words. The spoken word is just as powerful, and sampling aside this is another direct line to the griots of Africa. These stories told and retold through repetition, and later reinterpretation, help us listeners, or at least invigorate us, understand the true depth of history in Hip-Hop.\n\nPeace\n\nDuring my days in the crammed quarters of my Yeshiva I would follow my Rabbis arguments. Some were interesting as I felt in tune with the message. One example is the idea of balancing yourself with the spiritual and the mundane. Both can work together and compliment the spiritual depth of an act of worship. Take for example the recently celebrated Holy Day of Purim. One of the customs is to get drunk in order to confuse the senses as to good and evil. However, there is a note of moderation from the Rabbis, and Sages of future’s past, to avoid total inebriation, which could lead to a black out. These ideas I completely understood, study, and still try to master to this very day. However, there were plenty of topics that I completely disagreed with the Rabbis. The main example is music, and more specifically Hip Hop music. An Orthodox Jew should not listen to any secular music, unless it’s an instrumental piece. So they can go nuts listening to classical music, but no Beatles and Public Enemy. That’s the hardline as most Orthodox Jews do listen to secular music. Hip Hop was attacked even more as they spewed the same stereotypes I hear to this day in the United States. To the Rabbis the music was nothing less than garbage boiling over an old sewer grate. They broke it down to its most base and raw nature while criticizing its unadulterated emphasis on the baser things in life. I disagreed. I attempted to explain that Hip Hop is a large swath of land where the artists rap about so many different things under the sun. The funny thing is that there are plenty of rappers who have used biblical or biblically tinted rap schemes within their lyrics.\n\nSpecific rap lyrics keep dangling in my head, and once I started learning more Jewish texts it began to click. After looking over these texts from the Mishna and Gemarrah, which make up the Talmud, I was amazed at how my mind began to connect these sage’s words with Hip Hop lyrics. I guess my mind and soul were awakened by the new sages invigorating the old sages. A lot come in passing in various ways such as a random law or written notes by various Rabbis. Growing up listening to the classic rap albums from the late 1980’s and rolling into the mid-1990’s a pastiche of lyrics is jumbled inside my head. If Will Shortz could only make a crossword for Hip Hop! One fine example comes from the amazing debut album by Nas titled Illmatic.\n\nThe album opens with Nas and the fellas chatting about guns, life, and fun. The is happening as a banging beat is blaring over them, which was the opening credits scene from the film Wild Style. He then launches into his laudatory ode to the life of paranoia in the ghettos of the big city, “NY State of Mind.”\n\nOne of the most poignant lines is when he rhymes that “I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death.” Amazing, but it become more amazing when I figured it into the Jewish mystical concept of the 1/60th rule. This idea basically means that 1/60th of most things (note how I’m being very general) have a potential for the great heights or the sickest lows. One is sleep, and how sleep is 1/60th of death. When I first heard the line I though he said that he never sleeps because it’s the cause of the death. Confusion of divine providence can go hand in hand, but Nas makes an interesting comparison. Sleeping being the cousin of death is as relative to sleep being 1/60th of death. To further the mysticism of this is to note that 1/60th of dreams are prophetic visions. This adds further into this mystical chasm of ideas, and it points to the fact that certain rappers are deeper than they lead on. This can all be conveyed through lyrics and concepts on their albums. Of course I should also mention the use of the term “prophet” which has been used such as by Jeru Da Damaja.\n\nJeru assumes the role of the prophet, and he acts just like the great prophets from the Tanach (That’s the Torah, Prophets, and Written parts of the prophets). Like past prophets he jumps around Brooklyn catching the negative aspects which poison the black communities. But he also rebukes the people, which is another important point. Prophets were not only seers of visions and premonitions of G-d’s will. They also take the word of G-d and rebuke the people in order to bring them closer to G-d. Apt I might say thanks to Jeru.\n\nThere are plenty more concepts such as the Notorious B.I.G’s motto and song “Mo’ Money, Mo’ Problems.”\n\nIf I were you I’d fast forward past Mase and Puff right to the talent – Biggie.\n\nIn the song, and in he last interviews, he laments the pressures of becoming more wealthy and visible. This increases the jealousy, hatred, and envy which could lead to a speedy end. Unfortunately Biggie did not live much longer as his second album was released at the time of his murder. Still, this idea of increased wealth could consume you if you kept it unhinged is an age-old Talmudic idea. The more wealth one accumulates the more the evil inclination could get a hold of them.\n\nI should also note that Biggie’s classic track “The Ten Crack Commandments” is reminiscent of another series of commandments given to Moses on Mount Sinai.\n\nThere are plenty more examples of MC’s who use biblical verses in order to bolster their argument or concept. KRS-ONE used many biblical allusions in his songs, both with Boogie Down Productions and solo. One example is his song “Why is That” from the BDP album titled Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop.\n\nThe song is a powerful polemic condemning the white system, and how young blacks are taught to be like their white counterparts. However, whites do not need to learn how to be black. He attacks the white power system by using its founding stone, the Bible. More specifically he uses the Torah (What some consider the Old Testament, but I only got one!) to show how these early figures were probably dark-skinned. By starting with the genesis, that is the book of Genesis, he recounts the chapters dealing with the sons of Noach/Noah. Noach’s sons each started their own nations that were somewhat color coded in the language of ancient Hebrew. He points out that Shem was the father of all the Semitic races, negating the idea that they were white. The verse clearly reads that they are dark or black, so it contradicts centuries of white supremacy.\n\nI know I wrote this in days of blog past, but the Beastie Boys transformed themselves into three biblical characters from the book of Daniel.\n\nThese three young Jews refused non-Jewish food given to them by the Babylonian ruler, as chronicled in the beginning of the book of Daniel. Due to their unwavering faith the ruler grew angry and ordered them killed. As they were tossed into a fiery furnace they were miraculously saved by G-d. Thank G-d for the Beastie Boys.\n\nAnother great example is the great and late Tupac and his song “So Many Tears.”\n\nHe starts the song with the famous opening lines from King David’s book of Psalms. Psalm 23 opens with the line of walking through the shadow of death. Tupac can be described as a morbid MC, but he had such a depth that also had a sense of spiritual growth. Although he might have been portrayed, and this is the media’s machine of the “watch me now news,” as a venal and rough exterior. He was far more complicated, and being a black man-made him more of a target.\n\nAnother interesting biblical reference made by a woman is Lauren Hill’s lyrics in her great song “Doo Wop (That Thing).”\n\nThe song is from her great debut album titled The Miseducation of Lauren Hill, and it’s a powerful song. The song speaks of sexual politics and the double standard that plagues women in society when it comes to “proper” sex roles. In the song she rhymes\n\n“Talking out your neck, sayin’ you’re a Christian,\n\nA Muslim, sleeping with the gin,\n\nNow that was the sin that Jezebel in,\n\nWho you goin’ tell when the repercussions spin,\n\nShowing off your ass cause you’re thinking it’s a trend.”\n\nLauren likens herself to Jezebel, and how she brought the worship of Baal (meaning she brought idol worship to the Jewish people). In the Jewish tradition she is considered an evil woman who would give up her husband and children for power. In the Christian world, and more so with popular culture representations of black women, uses the name as a lascivious woman with insatiable sexual appetites. In the American south, mostly after the Civil War, these depictions of black women were lumped into two categories. They were either Jezebels or they were asexual women who were called mammies. It’s a poignant example of using a biblical reference to point out irregularities and contradictions in American society.\n\nDrake does use biblical references, but he usually sticks to Jewish kitsch. Another MC who blew up recently, but has been in the game for a minute, and used a biblical allusion is Pusha T. Pusha T along with his brother No Malice made up the group the Clipse, who dropped solid music. Pusha recently signed with Kanye West’s GOOD Music label. He then dropped a song vehemently ripping Drake apart lyrically. Although the song as little when it comes to actual biblical allusions it’s all in the title. The song titled “Exodus 23:1” is a straight lyrical beat down on one of the most popular MC’s nowadays.\n\nIt’s very interesting when a biblical verse goes viral, but that’s exactly what happened. Pusha T doesn’t hold back by chiding the MC questioning his hip hop authenticity to his inner core. What’s interesting is what the actual verse reads. In the book of Exodus, chapter 23, verse 1 it reads “Do not accept false report, do not extend your hand with the wicked to be a venal witness.” Now, this is from a Jewish source so the Christian and Muslim (if there is one) interpretations might be a little different. The great Jewish sage Rashi says that “It is forbidden to believe unverified gossip about another person. It not only speaks of an individual, but of a judge who must act as impartial as possible. Now, I have no idea how Pusha saw it because it seems that he is propagating the very item the verse abhors. I’m not sure if the things said about Drake are verifiable, but he is adding to this uncertainty of truth. The Torah is the antithesis of that, hence it is the Truth.\n\nSo, make sure to let your Rabbis know, and if they don’t know now they know…….Jews.\n\nPeace\n\n#Torahlyrics #Biblical lyrics #Nas #NotoriousBIG #JeruDaDamaja #BDP #KRS-ONE #Tupac #BeastieBoys #PushaT #LaurenHill\n\nHip Hop culture came from the grit and dirt steaming out of the ghettos of New York City. The squaller and filth is what made the aesthetic so authentic. However, it was a period of heavy decline for the city itself. The city’s budget had been drowning further into the pits of hell. By the time Abe Beame became Mayor of New York City his dapper predecessor, the boyishly handsome Republican by the name of John Lindsey, had brought the coiffeurs to the brink. Beame, who was demonized by the time he ran again in 1977, slashed and burned all that he could. Unfortunately this meant that the very heart of New York City’s institutions would never be the same again. Gone were the days of free College education as it was before he put into effect mandatory tuition costs. The City University of New York system prided itself on free education and the best quality. That was done away with including heavy cuts to the municipalities, cuts to the police force and the firefighters, and all after school programs, as well as cutting resources. This was the breeding ground for Hip Hop, and you can see the history written for your very eyes in the history books.\n\nAfter the boiler explosions and many crazy innovations, which swept up by 1977, Hip Hop became more tangible. By 1979 the first Hip Hop recordings were pressed and released on vinyl. Most of the early recordings were seen as novelties, yet the sound caught the attention of Sylvia Robinson. Robinson, along with her husband Joe capitalized on the market by forming the first real Hip Hop label, Sugar Hill Records.\n\nThe irony rang clear in the choice of the name. Sugar Hill is a run down ghetto in Harlem, which was called sugar hill due to the cream of the crop of black intellectuals who lived there in the early part of the century. However, by the 1960’s the area was neglected and disheveled so it rang as an authentic ghetto. Sugar Hill records was based out of New Jersey, which was a slap in the face of the many originators who hailed and lived Hip Hop straight from its source, the South Bronx. Sylvia Robinson managed to usher in the new era of big recordings, starting with the Sugar Hill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight” released in 1979. The label picked up acts like the Funky 4 plus 1 more, and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five to name a few. However, after the shady deals, and the fact that the artists were not seeing a dime on the return profits, the label feel apart. This left a vacuum for small labels to pick up these artists and record them, when the world mostly saw this as a fad or they hadn’t heard anything at all. In come the Jews!!!\n\nDan Charnas writes that “By 1984, Sugar Hill Records – the Black-owned company that dominated the early years of rap on record – had been eclipsed by other, smaller companies run mostly by young, Jewish entrepreneurs and executives like Cory Robbins, Steve Plotnicki, Tom Silverman, and Barry Weiss.” I will add that this is not a new story, but rather a long story of the history of Jewish participation in American popular music. In the late 1940’s and early 1950’s there were many Jewish businessmen who delved into the recording business. They were a bit seasoned, gruff, and older because they naturally progressed to that type of business. People like the Chess brothers, and many more laid the foundation for these young Jews in the Hip Hop game.\n\nEach of the men mentioned above came into the rap game at a crucial time. They came at a time when, arguably the recording business could have taken a dive. However, like the Jews before them, they believed in the authentic sounds and bonding over Hip Hop culture. They trolled the many clubs in the city turing heads on to the potential of the music. They were inclined to get into the venture in order to make money, but they did it for much more than a profit.\n\nCorry Robbins founded Profile Records in 1981, and remained its head until 1994. Profile is most notable for taking the risk in signing many underground groups, including the first real multiplatinum sellers, Run-DMC. Robbins, along with his partner Steve Plotnicki opened the company in 1981 with loans from their parents. This would become a formidable company signing acts like Dana Dane, Rob Base & DJ EZ Rock, Special Ed, Poor Righteous Teachers, King Sun, and DJ Quick among others.\n\nTom Silverman was also one of these Jewish go getters who believed in the staying power of Hip Hop, and the recordings. He founded the NMS (New Music Seminar) in 1980, and shortly afterward he formed Tommy Boy Records. Named after his nickname he signed many acts across the spectrum in the early days. One example is Afrika Bambaata and his various groups such as Soulsonic Force. Tommy Boy Signed many notable artists, some who became famous over the years including De La Soul, Naughty By Nature, Queen Latifah, House of Pain, and Everlast to name a few.\n\nLast but not least on the list was Barry Weiss, who I wrote on earlier. He would influence the owner of Jive Records and brought him to all the rap music clubs. This sparked his interest, which led to them signing many important acts like the other labels. The roster included KRS-One, A Tribe Called Quest, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, and Schoolly D to name a few.\n\nThis is no coincidence as many other smaller labels popped up that were also run or owned by Jews. History doesn’t allow for predictions, yet this could be as close as I’m willing to get. However, these Jews had the sheer energy, enthusiasm and money to fund these endeavors. Most of them were lucrative at the time, yet they all folded after some time. These young Jews deserve credit because if it wasn’t for them we might not have heard these super sounds. No one but the higher power can tell, yet the number of Jews in Hip Hop is overwhelming andy will be investigated much further.\n\nPeace, and Shabbat Shalom\n\n#TommyBoyRecords #ProfileRecords #JiveRecords #SugarHillRecords\n\nIn the modern age of fast paced information oozing out of your device is all too common. We all take for granted the fact that not so long ago the super spread of information was not as prolific. Now you can just pop open your device or computer installed to what ever part of your body, please choose carefully. Any item that is deemed news worthy, unfortunately in this case it could be that your favorite tween artists flashed her not too proportionate body part, will flash instantly in your face. We are a generation of news sadists who are overloaded with this junk. However, music has been far easier to get at and obtain new sounds due to the overload. Hip Hop music is part of this model, yet as I wrote above not too long ago hip hop was very hard to communicate with the greater world. Newsworthy items and other hip hop matters were very localized from its inception up until the later part of the 1980’s. Hip Hop, or mostly rap music, was spread through word of mouth, through shows, through spreading mix tapes around and other methods wet the appetites of the listeners. However, it was hard to find and you had to know where to look.\n\nThere was a need by the late 1980’s for a sheet, or more properly a fanzine, such as the ones created for the punk movement like Punk magazine and Sniffin’ Glue from England. This came from two Harvard students, who’s sheer love of hip hop and belief of its strength in numbers fueled the need for a connection. They wanted to create a fanzine that would be able to show what their favorite hip hop track were. In a way they were creating the glue that would bind all these disparate communities of fans into one not so imagined community of hip hop heads.\n\nJon Shecter had tried his talents as a perfumer in the rap game, which ended in disaster. However, being a true fan of the art didn’t discourage him from expanding on his dreams. After the disappointment he strolled into a friend’s place apartment and quickly caught the gaze of a copy of a rap magazine. The scheme, concocted by his friend’s roommate, was a rap magazine to promote their local college radio rap show. After he met the man who concocted the magazine, by the name of Dave Mays, he realized that they were on the same page, literally. Hence, The Source was born. They both influenced each other’s tastes in music, but the common bond was that in the words of Dan Charnas they were “two white, Jewish guys at Harvard who loved Black music.” Naming it The Source gave it, and still gives it to this very day, a sense of true authenticity in Hip Hop culture. It will forever be solidified in our minds as “the” hip hop magazine that is the official bottom line, as it branded itself just that from day one. Like MTV is, or at least was, to the true authentic music channel The Source will be the end all that is the truth in the game.\n\nBoth plunged deep into black music from the start. They crawled out of their mother’s wombs and onto the living room floor ready to plug in the head phones and kick out the jams! Shecter like most Hip Hop fans in the 1980’s, who lived outside of the urban centers of Hip Hop, was frustrated at the sheer lack of Hip Hop journalism and stories on his favorite artists. The big blow hard magazine like Rolling Stone and the great liberal rag the New York Times ignored hip hop music. Spin magazine catered to the alternative white crowd with the occasional hip hop story. They were the first to use a hip hop group in the guise of the Beastie Boys, which caused some backlash from African American critics. (Just read an early post on my blog on the Beastie Boys). The Village Voice occasionally ran op-ed’s, but they did run the “Hip-Hop Nation” article series. Harry Allen’s writings were on the topic, including articles by John Leland at Spin and certain articles by Nelson George. However, at that point this was scarce, so Shecter and Mays acted on this wide vacant chasm. Shecter would take up the article content while Mays would tackle the distribution and advertisement details. Between them and their highly motivated and skilled team, they would push the Source to great popularity. Dan Charnas adds from his book that “The Source quickly gained a readership outside of the local area. Retailers and record companies began to see The Source as a promotional vehicle even more potent than Mays and Shecter’s (previously run at Harvard) radio show.”\n\nOne thing that they prided themselves in was the integrity of the music and its artists. When the craze hit hard and artists like MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice became the pop sensations they were The Source was pushed to include them in their pages. Big companies promised piles of money for name recognition giving them the hip hop stamp of approval. Instead of eating from the trough of greed and mundane music, they decided to take the opposite rout. They eschewed all the alcohol and cigarette brands who pushed for advertising space, who offered them a shit load of money (This is the SpaceBalls version of a lot of money!). They did this on principle as they knew all too well how alcohol and tobacco are heavily marketed to young black teens in urban settings, and still are. Instead they rejected them, and their dirty money, in order to invest in the up and coming crop of young talented hip hop artists.\n\nTheir stellar reporting and relevance remained until the mid to late 1990’s when it all came crashing down. Thanks to the Almighty RSO and Benzino’s tactics at making Dave Mays alienate his colleagues would be the final blow. This issue is too much to report on for details but the team that consisted of some of the best talents including but not limited to Reginald C. Dennis, James Bernard, Ed Young, Derrick Hawes, Matteo “Matty C” Capoluongo, Rob “Reef” Tewlow, Chris Wilder, and Phil Pabon, was no more.\n\nAfter recently glancing at a recent issue, as they are rolling out the festivities of The Source‘s 25th anniversary there remains a bittersweet taste. The issue contained some of the older articles written from days past when the analysis was fresh. However, it seems far more full of fluff and artists who I can’t even identify let alone enjoy. It’s a fuzz but the Source remains poignant, along the many other trades, blogs, and magazines who took the model of the original one and only Source. Calling itself the “Hip Hop Bible” the issue boasted that “You can’t google this, MTV won’t show you this, and suburbia can’t explain it to you like we can. We culture.” I guess that in a way they are culture, or more specifically they were the first indicator in print of the potential of a musical genre that came out of the the streets of the Bronx. Thanks to these two white Jewish boys at Harvard.\n\nShecter and Mays in the early days of The Source\n\nPeace, Shavua Tov and happy new week!\n\n#TheSource\n\nThe man, the myth, and the beard can’t be mistaken. The many photographs of Rick Rubin present a guru like figure with long flowing hair and a big gruff beard to match. Even in his early days as the founder of Def Jam Recordings Rick Rubin sported the long hair heavy metal prowess. This was also matched with his wide spectrum of musical tastes as he heard the many new sounds coming out of New York City in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. Like the members of what would become the Beastie Boys Rubin dipped into both worlds of the NYC club scene. He enjoyed the heavy rock sounds along with the Hip Hop artists who were performing as well. We should not forget that at the same time as Hip Hop’s genesis Punk music was also being created in the disheveled Lower East Side neighborhood in lower Manhattan. Punk, much like Hip Hop, was a do-it-yourself idea where the talent was lacking and the music blared with little pretensions. This wet his appetite and made him far more interested in participating in the genre that he is so well known for. However, Rick Rubin was not only an integral player by creating Def Jam and producing for the likes of the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J and Slayer, he also created the modern format of the Hip Hop song. When he produced the heavy hitting track “It’s Yours” in 1983 with Jazzy Jay and T La Rock he revolutionized rap music.\n\nJust to give a quick overview of the man would be disingenuous due to his expansive history. Still the man, officially named Frederick Jay “Rick” Rubin, has an interesting story that also strings along the past Jewish players in the realm of American popular music. Rubin was born on the shores of Long Island and his parents were supportive, as his father Mickey helped him financially through his business ventures. They believed in their son’s talent and drive, yet the hair, brutish persona, and what some might consider sexist and racist humor is another aspect to the man. Regardless of that he managed to build on these ideas while enjoying himself the entire time. By listening in his New York University dorm room to the many lush licks laid down by heavy metal groups like AC/DC, Black Sabbath and the almighty Led Zeppelin gave him ideas. He would be the first to incorporate these sounds into Hip Hop music while keeping the authentic cutting and scratching on top. Also, using the Punk credo and sensibility of self determination made him steadfast in his work. When you hear a Rick Rubin track you hear the unfiltered no nonsense approach of a true master.\n\nAfter promoting parties through his dorm room, and creating the skeletal ideas which would become Def Jam, he became more versatile. By hanging out in the public spheres that most consider black he managed to forge important bonds and friendships. The white kids were mostly not interested in these new sounds playing it safe by sticking to the new popular fads like Disco slop. Through these connections he met Jazzy Jay who DJ’d for the legendary Afrika Bambaata, and T La Rock who’s brother was part of the Hip Hop super group the Treacherous Three. The song “It’s Yours” is very simple, but its impact is important in the history of Hip Hop music. Like past Jewish producers, such as Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound, Rubin wanted the sound to be big and bombastic to the listeners ears. In his book, The Big Payback: The HIstory of the Business of Hip- Hop, Dan Charnas recounts the experience in fine detail by writing that, “Rubin wanted to conjure something that he hadn’t yet heard in a rap record – parity between the DJ and MC, in the same way that rock records might feature the singer and guitarist equally.” This DJ and MC connection was somewhat severed when Hip Hop started being recorded and pressed to wax records. The earliest Hip Hop records used house bands that would relinquish the role of the DJ. The Dj would become invisible to the ears as the rappers were the only real sound you heard along with the band. The original party aspect of the pre-recorded Hip Hop scene had this quality as the DJ spun and the MC worked off of the DJ’s music. Rubin emphasized the role of the DJ as we can hear his cutting on the track along with the rhymes. You can hear Jazzy Jay cut with two turntables as he works off T La Rock’s rhymes. Rubin also made sure that the record was labeled as made by both Jazzy Jay and T La Rock, giving them equal billing. Another important aspect is Rubin’s control over the song by not allowing it to keep going in time. Clocking in at around four minutes this song was much shorter than the past few years’ releases. With few exceptions, like Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five’s grand opus “The Message,” most of these songs were long like the full length version of “Rapper’s Delight,” “Supperappin,'” and “Planet Rock.” These records, although highly influential and moving, were put together rather sloppily and in an amateurish fashion. The standard format would be the beat playing as the group mimicked the party aspect and each rapper would shine and rap his or her verses. This would keep going on and on until the song would fade out, but some songs would take from ten to fifteen minutes to listen to. Rubin formatted the Hip Hop song to the structure of rock singles. This was revolutionary as it would help usher in the new era of shorter and catchier Hip Hop songs. Other acts at the time such as Run-DMC brought the grip from the streets to the record. Rick Rubin brought the rock and roll structure in order to make it more accessible to the wider white audiences. This would also help bring it to the radio format with short singles that were playable due to their shorter forms. This record was also liked by Rubin’s future co-owner and label partner Russell Simmons. As they say the rest of the story is history. The song revolutionized Hip Hop music and forever changed its marketability. Rick Rubin opened the door and of course he is part of the long string of Jews pushing the envelope in many ways.\n\nShabbat Shalom\n\nRubin in the early days with the Beastie Boys:\n\nAnd a link to the song “It’s Yours”\n\n#rick rubin #Hip Hop #It’s Yours by Jazzy Jay and T La Rock #Dan Charnas #Beastie Boys #Def Jam Recordings\n\nThose are some bold, brash and angry words being spouted by Avant-garde and MC extraordinaire, El-P. He was shouting that he would “rather be mouth fucked by Nazis unconscious” as opposed to be singed to the indie Hip Hop label Rawkus records. By the time he rhymed this screed he put it on his first album of epic proportions titled Fantastic Damage. The title is apt as this is El-P’s modus operandi ever since he started in the 1990’s. To me it was the year 1997 that mainstream rap music became a cottage industry onto itself. In 1997 Biggie was killed, Tupac was shot a few months earlier, and Puff and his crew brought up rap music to the top of the international charts. Hip Hop grew exponentially in 1997, with the many releases reaching peaks that were unheard of in the earlier part of the decade. In the early part of the decade groups like N.W.A., Public Enemy, and the many other talented hip hop artists reached record level sales. However, by the release of Tupac’s last album, before his untimely death, and the release of Life After Death record sales for these albums, and other Hip Hop works reached an immense proportion. Of course like the rock and roll scene of the 1970’s Hip Hop became bloated with the excessive abundance. This meant that the formula was forged, which remains to this day. This means that in order to get a record deal you had to follow this formula which is demeaning, exploitative and racist. Rappers mainly speak of their riches, and both sexual and violent conquests. This cocktail of nihilism and ultra capitalism has lead Hip Hop to where it is today. However, in 1997 Hip Hop also expanded in many directions as a reaction to this growing excess.\n\n1997 marked the expansion of the many Hip Hop groups and methods of their deliveries and styles. One of the most dynamic of these groups was El-P’s Company Flow. I was among the throng of disenchanted fans and I too thought that Hip Hop was becoming soulless, and full of pretenders who are giving authentic Hip Hop a bad rap. When I first heard Company Flow’s early singles I was hooked on how different everything was. The group consisted of El-P (An Irish Jew), Bigg Jus (of Philippine background), and DJ Mr. Len (who is African American). What got me was the beats that harked back to the hard hitting breaks of the early Run-DMC hits. But, the production, mainly done by El-P, was bizarre with many soundscapes of downbeats cut sharp by their unique rhyme styles. They didn’t rap on any scheme of bars, but with their insane bludgeoning beats they made it work. Instead of rhyming about stacks of money, women at their feet and their violent conquests they took a different approach. Each had their delivery spliced with images from Italian horror movies, space travel, and the oppressive corporate state. El-P also used these ghastly images as a social critique with a dash of wit. They also used far out samples such as from the cult classic film The Holy Mountain on the song “Population Control.” They signed to “the” indie underground Hip Hop label at the time with its signature razor and hanging man on the vinyl. Rawkus records supported the indie Hip hop acts, but as we see the label also took many liberties when it came to fair pay. Co-Flow disbanded and eventually left the label, but El still had his parting shot on his amazingly hard hitting and fast paced single “Deep Space 9mm.” His first two albums are amazing in how different they are from anything most human ears have heard in the past. El-P’s production style is so unsettling, as he porfessed recently that he wants you to feel uncomfortable when listening to his music. His second album, I’ll Sleep When You’re Dead, is more off the wall, more bizarre, more dysfunctional, and more excessive with the wrist cutting sounds and stagnant feelings heaped on the listener. His last album, arguably his best, and one of the best releases of 2012, is another testament to his rising pitch perfection. Titled Cancer for Cure he delves into the strange with the familiar sound of that El-P hit. He also produced Killer Mike’s entire last album, which is also considered one of the best albums of 2012 as well.\n\nWhat could be more swell and dandy than for them to team up and make one of the best records of this past year. I also saw them live so I can testify to their perfect performance skills and energy packed charisma they beam into their audiences. Their album, titled Run the Jewels, is short, sweet and directly to the point. From the lyrics you hear the rush coming through your pores as your inner coil can feel the energy of this album. All other rappers and their emotional bag of gimmicks are being pushed aside. All the idols are being smashed and your preconceived notions are being tossed on their heads. El-P has risen to the top and is being regarded more as a respected artist in the mainstream. Killer Mike announces El-P’s dominance when he raps on the song “Banana Clipper” that the “producer gave me a beat, said it’s the beat of the year, I said El-P didn’t do it, so get the fuck outta here.”\n\nEl-P always stays true and I’m not surprised that a Jew can change the landscape of Hip Hop the way he has. He remains defiant to the end on his never ending quest for honesty and authenticity. Although it is hard to find his roots, unlike other more Jewish rappers he still drops those subtle hints. As I wrote on the header saying that as opposed to being signed to Rawkus was a big thing. Jews and Nazis have their past so to conjure it up in this way is very caustic, and it invokes to true wrath and betrayal El-P felt at the time. There are other hints like when he shouts out “Oy Vey” on the song “The Full Retard” and other subtle lines coming from within. He deserves a lot of credit as he remains true and trudges along the hoopity blah of the mainstream Hip Hop world. It can all be summed up nicely with an except from Patrick Neate’s book, Where You’re At: Notes from the Frontline of a Hip-Hop Planet. In his book Neate looks at the various Hip Hop movements in many locations across the globe. First is the heart of the scene, or at least he thinks, which is New York City. Arriving in the city he is surprised at how small the output of rap music actually comes from New York City circa 2003. He visits the indie label Def Jux where he interviews the owner of the label. When he asks where Hip hop is in the city a dormant El-P shouts from the other end of the room that the real Hip Hop is only over here. For all the praise and blah of NYC rappers, he remains the cream of the crop. So go listen to his album and fuck Rolling Stone Magazine for not putting in their top 50 albums of the past year, bitches!!!\n\nHere is a great Co-Flow video to their single “End to End Burners.”\n\nA Video for his song “Deep Space 9mm” from his Album Fantastic Damage:\n\nA video for his song “the Full Retard” from his latest album Cancer for Cure:\n\nAnd, last but not least, a video for the song “36” Chain” from the magnum opus of the year!!!!
