        "text": "By: Tunisia and Dove\n\n—\n\nFor nearly 30 years, Rick Rubin has been one of the most influential men in music. Working with artists from multiple genres, Rubin has been a part of turning good artists into superstars. Nearly a decade ago, MTV called him “the most important producer of the last 20 years” – and he hasn’t stopped moving yet! More than just a music producer, Rubin is a masterful A&R who can make the most of any artist he works with.\n\nAs most people know, Rick Rubin was the co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, and was very influential in bringing Hip Hop to the mainstream. In honor of his birthday (March 10), Urblife.com is recognizing Rubin’s many achievements. Salute!\n\nOn March 10, 1963, Frederick Jay Rubin was born in Long Beach, New York. In high school, Rubin learned guitar and began songwriting and jamming with his punk group Hose. He ultimately came up with the idea for indie label Def Jam Records.\n\nIn 1984, Rubin teamed with an eager young promoter named Russell Simmons, and together the duo got Def Jam off of the ground. Collaboratively, Def Jam’s first logo’d release was T La Rock and Jazzy Jay‘s “It’s Yours,” followed by official retail releases for LL Cool J‘s “I Need a Beat” and Beastie Boys “Rock Hard.” Shortly after, Def Jam signed Public Enemy to their label.\n\nRubin saw that Hip Hop and Rock could live harmoniously in his world, and it wasn’t long before he found himself on the big screen. In 1985, he had a role in the film Krush Groove which was based on the life of Russell Simmons. The movie introduced Blair Underwood and starred Sheila E, The Fat Boys, Run-DMC, Kurtis Blow, New Edition and The Beastie Boys.\n\nIn 1986, Rubin produced the Beastie Boys Licensed to Ill and thrash metal band Slayer‘s Reign in Blood, followed by The Cult’s Electric and an Executive Producer credit on Public Enemy‘s Yo! Bum Rush the Show in 1987.\n\nThat winter, Run-DMC unveiled their immediate Rubin-produced holiday classic “Christmas in Hollis.”\n\n’87 also saw Rubin moving into the film industry, as he scored the full soundtrack for the Less Than Zero, which starred Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr., James Spader and Jami Gertz.\n\n1988 was a big year for Rubin, with more production for the likes of metal band Danzig, along with second projects with both Slayer and Public Enemy. He directed the movie Tougher Than Leather, which starred Run-DMC. He also left Def Jam and created his own Def American label, which featured primarily heavy rock groups.\n\nBetween ’89 and ’90, Rubin stayed busy producing and advising on various levels for the likes of LL Cool J, Geto Boys, The Black Crowes and then-controversial comedian Andrew Dice Clay.\n\nIn 1990, Rubin had a role in the film Men Don’t Leave which starred Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates and Joan Cusack. This was his only role where he played someone other than himself.\n\nTwo years later, Rick was back to being himself in the Red Hot Chili Peppers documentary Funky Monks. He produced the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik that the track “Funky Monks” appeared on, and was interviewed along with the band.\n\nDef American signed Seattle’s Sir Mix-A-Lot, who flourished under Rubin’s guidance with the breakout Grammy Award-winning hit “Baby Got Back.” Mix’s albums Mack Daddy (’92) and Return of the Bumpasaurus (1996) were released on the label.\n\nRubin was truly ahead of his time, and was setting a new precedence for Hip Hop in the mainstream. Accordingly, in 1993 he held a funeral for word “def” after the term hit the mainstream dictionary. Reverend Al Sharpton oversaw the ceremony at the Hollywood Memorial Cemetary, and the over 500 attendees included Trent Reznor and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Flea. At that point, Rubin officially renamed his label American Recordings.\n\nHe still stayed busy in the studio with a variety of remarkable rock talent, including Mick Jagger, Joan Jett and Tom Petty. He also produced the soundtrack for Arnold Schwarzenegger‘s film Last Action Hero.\n\nIn 1994, Rubin worked on a compilation album for Johnny Cash aptly named American Recordings. This was the first big project released by his new label.\n\nThroughout the second half of the ’90s, Rick kept his nose to the grindstone with the likes of Nine Inch Nails, AC/DC, Metallica, Sheryl Crow and many others. He also created television magic with South Park‘s classic “Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo.” There was no doubt that Rubin was truly the sh*t at that point. (If you have nothing better to do right now, you can watch the full South Park episode here.)\n\nThe new millennium saw even more of Rubin’s savage work ethic, as he touched everything from System of a Down and Limp Bizkit to Macy Gray and Saul Williams.\n\nIn 2004, Rubin had yet another documentary appearance in Jay-Z‘s Fade to Black, a film about The Black Album, which Rubin also contributed to. He was introduced to a new generation of Hip Hop fans as ‘the scary looking guy with the beard’ in the “99 Problems” video.\n\nApparently he was the go-to guy for pop culture documentaries, as Rick was also tapped to speak up in the Dixie Chicks 2006 documentary Shut Up and Sing. The film chronicled the aftermath of controversial comments against George Bush made by member Natalie Maines. Of course, he also worked on the country group’s Number One double-platinum, quintuple Grammy-winning album Take the Long Way Home.\n\nIn 2007, Rick Rubin made another power move when he became the head of Columbia Records alongside Steve Barnett. In the same year, Rubin won a Grammy award for Producer of the Year (Non-Classical) for his work on albums for Green Day, U2, Dixie Chicks, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Michael Kranz.\n\nRubin was also back in film mode for Runnin Down A Dream, a documentary about Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. He was interviewed along with George Harrison from The Beatles, Stevie Nicks, Johnny Depp and others about Petty’s iconic career.\n\nIn 2009, Rubin won another Grammy award for Producer of the Year, this time for work with Metallica, Weezer, Ours, Jakob Dylan and veteran pop/folk star Neil Diamond.\n\nIn 2010, Rubin produced Kid Rock’s first album without a parental advisory sticker, Born Free. A November 2010 GQ Magazine feature suggested that despite Rock’s fanbase and critical acclaim, he was still clamoring for respect – something that Rubin’s expertise could bring him.\n\nKnown for years as a portly kind of guy, Rick Rubin has also switched up his diet and fitness routine to rid himself of that belly. Now he and his beard are definitely ready to take on 48!\n\nRick’s 2011 agenda includes work on rising star Adele’s new album 21, as well as folk rock band Avett Brothers. He is also working on the tenth Red Hot Chili Peppers album. RHCP frontman Anthony Kiedis interviewed Rubin for Interview Magazine in February – an interesting feature which definitively co-starred the beard.\n\nInterview also featured this playlist, with a wide array of Rubin-produced hits.
