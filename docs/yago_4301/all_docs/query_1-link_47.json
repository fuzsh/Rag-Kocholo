        "text": "N.W.A., the group that brought gangster rap to the mainstream, angering conservatives and the F.B.I. along the way, burned hot and fast. The core group as it’s remembered today — Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, MC Ren, DJ Yella — was together for only about two years, and in total the group lasted for maybe five, from the late 1980s to early ’90s.\n\nBut N.W.A. crammed several lifetimes into that short space, many — but not all — of which get airtime in the new biopic “Straight Outta Compton,” which opens on Aug. 14.\n\nHere we see the group members as fresh-faced Compton teenagers, as buddy collaborators and, eventually, as firebrands. What you don’t see much of, though, is them as successful rap stars. Apart from a handful of scenes that show how quickly N.W.A. turned into an arena-worthy live act, and some flashes of the excess — primarily wealth and women — that came with their triumph, the group’s most robust period is largely clouded here by other concerns.\n\nBut what about a king? When it comes to capturing hip-hop success — the period that comes after the ascent — Hollywood has been ambivalent at best. If hip-hop was still primarily an underdog story, this would be understandable, but the genre is at the center of pop culture, both commercially and aesthetically. It’s minted several generations of stars. Film is maybe the last place it’s infantilized.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
