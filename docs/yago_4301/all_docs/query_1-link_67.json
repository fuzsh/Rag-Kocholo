        "text": "What a music producer is and does has certainly shifted over the decades. By today’s standards, producers usually make the beats and create the music (usually in DAWs like Ableton or Logic). This definition starkly contrasts what producers were in the 1960s and 1970s, when they were mostly in charge of the bigger picture of putting an album or song together.\n\nWhile these more conceptual definitions of what a music producer is and what a music producer does shift and change over time, the real end goal never falters because a music producer’s main job is to ensure that the music they’re involved with is the best. However, this task is far easier said than done, and the best music producers always make it look the easiest.\n\nSo, let’s take a moment to reflect on some of the greatest music producers of all time and unpack a bit more about their story, highlighting some of these best interviews and showcasing some of the music they’ve been involved with. Each music producer on this list has a different workflow and way of ensuring the simple goal of “making the music the best it can be” is accomplished. We’ll explore all this and more in this non-comprehensive but highly-curated list of the greatest music producers ever.\n\nSo, let’s dive in…\n\nRobert George “Joe” Meek – first music producer\n\nJoe Meek was a revolutionary figure in British music. He was the first-ever independent producer who introduced new techniques that shaped the sound of the 1960s. He did all of this out of his home studio, which was situated above a leather shop (a pretty wild place to have created some of the most groundbreaking recordings of all time!).\n\nMeek is considered among the most influential sound engineers and music producers ever. He introduced overdubbing, sampling, reverberation, and, most importantly, the recording studio as an instrument. He truly changed traditional pop music through distorted guitars, chaotic solos, and unusual sounds.\n\nMeek’s only chart-topping success was ‘Have I the Right’ by The Honeycombs. However, the band’s follow-up singles failed to replicate that success. Despite their innovative nature, many of Meek’s recordings were not commercial successes then. Still, Meek’s work has since been recognized as a cult classic.\n\nSongs Produced By Robert George “Joe” Meek\n\nQuincy Jones\n\nQuincy Jones is a highly acclaimed composer, producer, and musician. He is known for his work on major motion picture and television scores and for producing the best-selling single and album in the recording industry’s history. He has also received numerous awards, including 26 Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, and seven Oscar nominations.\n\nJones has been a significant figure in the music industry, with a particular focus on the impact of music on children and the digital distribution of music. He has also been involved in jazz, famously defining a jazz album as selling under 20,000 copies.\n\nIn the 1960s, Jones arranged songs for the biggest stars in the music industry, such as Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald. Over the following years, Jones added more credits to his name through film scoring, earning even more industry accolades and building up a more prominent name. Popular ones include “Four’s the Pawnbroker” and “Slender Thread.”\n\nOne of Jones’s crowning achievements was his three-album collaboration with pop icon Michael Jackson. Their first joint venture happened at the end of that decade. The 1970 Nine’s Off the Wall sold over 20 million copies and cemented Jones’s reputation as the most potent music producer. Next up was 1982’s history-making Thriller, which sold 110 million copies and remains the best-selling album ever. Their final collaboration, Seven’s Bad, sold over 30 million copies internationally.\n\nSongs Produced By Quincy Jones\n\nPhil Spector\n\nPhil Spector was a great producer who was best known for writing several number-hit songs and, unfortunately, for being convicted of the murder of Lana Clarkson, but let’s put the criminal case on the back burner for now and just chat about the music. There had been music producers since the dawn of the record music industry, but none had assumed the degree of control demanded by Spector. He was able to write music for the teen demographic like none could before, and he dominated this highly valuable sect of the music industry for years.\n\nHe has been active in music since he was a teenager with the group Teddy Bears; they released a song that went viral and topped the charts in the US and UK, with the melody “To know him is to love him” (no tiny feet for any artist, let alone ones this young). After several years, he moved to New York, where he became a staff producer for Dune Records, produced a string of hits and became an industry sensation.\n\nBy age 21, Spector was a millionaire responsible for producing 20 consecutive smash hits. During this time, he started to work on the “Wall of sound Technique,” which involved a process of overdubbing scores of musicians to make a full sound. This style made Spector even more famous in the music industry, and many iconic artists would be imitating this technique for future years, including the Beach Boys and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThe most important part of Spector’s activities was being asked to turn a series of the Beatles’ recording sessions into a marketable album. The resulting work, “Let it be,” topped both in the US and the UK. For the next several years, Spector continued to produce successful solo albums for Lenon and Harrison (Beatles members).\n\nSongs Produced By Phil Spector\n\nGeorge Martin\n\nOften referred to as the “Fifth Beatle,” George Martin’s classically trained and innovative approach were instrumental in shaping the sound of The Beatles and, thus, an entire generation of musicians. Martin was the producer, composer, and arranger for most of the band’s career, and his contributions are directly responsible for some of the band’s most iconic songs.\n\nGeorge Martin relationship with the Beatles started early in 1962, he heard one of their demo tapes and arranged a meeting with the band. Though he thought they were rather unpromising, Martin took a flyer on the Beatles. While his production and arrangement helped the Beatles early work reach soaring success, his influence became much more pronounced in 1965, that’s when The Beatles released “Yesterday” which was accompanied by Martin’s suggested string band, that helped a lot to elevate the song.\n\nAs the Beatles’ experimentation became more extreme, Martin’s role became more pronounced; he started using tape loops to create hypnotic rhythms in “Tomorrow Never Knows.”\n\nThe peak of his skills was demonstrated in creating the song “Strawberry Fields Forever.” Two song versions were recorded, one with the orchestra and one with the band, because the members could not agree on which was better. So, in this case, it was decided to use both. But there was a problem: the tempo. So Martin combined and mixed them so that the tempos blended seamlessly, creating a masterpiece.\n\nSongs Produced By George Martin\n\nRick Rubin\n\nThis man is so cool that you don’t have to come up with clickbait headlines for him because he changed modern music. He is one of the most interesting people in music, and the coolest part is that he doesn’t even make music! Picture him more as a guru and zen master of music.\n\nHardly a top-level artist or group hasn’t worked with Rick Rubin, and his creative philosophy has worked its way into groups like the Red Hot Chili Peppers to NAS and more. While most rock producers can be attributed to a particular artist or band they’ve invested their entire career in, Rubin’s knack for guiding and delivering artists to create the best music of their careers goes beyond the boundaries of genre. He has produced D.R.A.M., Lil Jon, Run-DMC, Black Sabbath, Linkin Park, Ed Sheeran, Metallica, Lady Gaga, Shakira, WU-TANG and many others. No matter what you listen to, you will surely like at least one song that Rick made.\n\nBut what is he doing now? On the one hand, Rubin professes the principle of “If I’m not needed and the band is doing well, I stay out of it,” because of which you can find dozens of photos on the web of a whole team of artists working hard on the music, panting, puffing, bringing out the very right notes, while Rubin is sleeping.\n\nOn the other hand, if an arranger’s job is limited to arrangements and a guitarist’s job to guitar, then Rick’s job is limited to neither. He helps make the arrangements, can pick samples for the beats, chooses the best solos with the guitarists, and works on mixing.\n\nHe is by far the most unique of all the producers on this list, if for any other reason than because he isn’t the one making the music. Still, he masters the bigger picture, ensuring everything he touches becomes musical gold.\n\nSongs Produced by Rick Rubin\n\nBrian Eno\n\nWhether operating as a synth master in the pioneering glam rock outfit Roxy Music, writing atmospheric ambient soundtracks, or producing for the likes of Devo, the Talking Heads, and Bowie, among others, it goes without saying that Brian Eno is undisputedly one of the most enigmatic and polymorphous musicians to ever emerge from the British rock canon.\n\nHe wears many hats: producer, composer, visual artist, activist. He is a self-described non-musician who has always had a penchant for the avant-garde and the unusual, shaped by most of his childhood and art school background. He mastered some of his most critically acclaimed contributions to music through improvisation, including two of his first solo albums, “Here come the Warm jets” and “Taking Tiger Mountain (by strategy).”\n\nBrian Eno was born into a working-class family in Melton on the northeast fringes of Woodbridge, a small, conservative Anglo town in Suffolk, England. In interviews, he has frequently expressed how his hometown has shaped most of his work. He used to say: “I’ve always enjoyed being melancholy, perhaps because that mood is very much a feature of the environment where I grew up.”\n\nAfter spending most of his time in London attending performances by experimental composers and musicians like Cornelius Cardew, Philip Glass, and Steve Reich, Eno became eager to get his hands on tape recorders and soon started experimenting with sound manipulation despite having no formal training in music.\n\nSongs Produced By Brian Eno\n\nDr. Dre\n\nIf you were born in the ’80s or ’90s and listened to hip-hop, Dr. Dre is likely a living legend, too. From his unparalleled work ethic, his inclination for innovation, and his ability to repeatedly shift the landscape of music as we know it and reinvent himself. Doctor Dre deserves his medals as a producer.\n\nNow, you can pull from many elements of Dre’s career, but I would say that it came from two factors—dedication to his craft and his approach and creative process to production. If you google Doctor Dre, you’ll see some photoshoots, and in 90% of those photos, you’ll see him in the studio, in front of a mixer, close to the mixer, touching the mixer, and, of course, behind the mixer. And it’s not surprising at all because, in the words of Doctor Dre himself, for his 27-year career, he’s only been out of the studio for two whole weeks.\n\nDoctor Dre has had high-profile and legendary rappers on his aftermath roster, including Rakim and Busta Rhymes. But now, Dre’s label roster includes Dre himself, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Anderson Pack and Silk Sonic.\n\nSongs Produced By Dr. Dre\n\nTimbaland\n\nTimothy Zachary Moseley, aka Timbaland, grew up in a musical family. Growing up in Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Timbaland was exposed to a rich blend of musical styles that heavily influenced his interest in music and the sound we know him for.\n\nThroughout the 90s and early 2000s, the maestro was on fire, crafting chart-topping hits for the biggest names in the game, from hip-hop kingpins Jay Z to R&B Prince Usher and southern rap maestro Ludacris. But Timb’s magic lay in producing hits and how he did it. His genius was in weaving together distinct genres, throwing in unexpected sonic twists, and redefining the soundscape of mainstream music.\n\nTransitioning from behind the mixing board to the head of the boardroom, Timbaland took his musical empire to new heights with the launch of Mosley Music Group in 2006. Showcasing his knack for spotting and nurturing raw talent, he brought on board rising stars like the soulful Keri Hilson and the eclipse eclectic Nellie Frittata.\n\nMuch of his rise to stardom can be attributed to key collaborations that hit at the right place and time, but one of the most impressive is with Justin Timberlake. He produced the majority of JT’s classic Future Sex/Love Sounds, which spawned No. 1 hits “Sexy Back,” “My Love,” and “What Goes Around… Comes Around.”\n\nSongs Produced By Timbaland\n\nMax Martin\n\nIf you’ve heard songs like “Blinding lights” by the Weekend, “Blank Space” by Taylor Swift, or “Dark Horse” by Katy Perry, then you have heard the work of Max Martin. Max Martin is a producer and songwriter behind 25 Billboard Hot 100 number-one songs, many of which he has written or produced. But since Max Martin isn’t on social media and doesn’t do too many interviews, he’s pretty mysterious and relatively unknown by the average music listener but he low-key has been involved with almost all of the biggest radio hits to have dominated the airwaves over the last two decades.\n\nKarl Martin Sandberg was born in 1971. Surprisingly, neither of his parents were musicians. He quickly fell in love with music, listening to his parents’ music collection, which included artists like Elton John, Queen, the Beatles, Mozart, and more.\n\nIn 1994, he met DJ Dennis Pop, a successful music producer who had just recently founded Sharon Studios, a recording studio that would become a go for many famous musicians. The two began working closely together, with Dennis acting as Max’s mentor. The first group that the duo worked a lot with was the Backstreet Boys; Max wrote multiple songs for them, including “I want it that way”, a song that helped them a lot to put the band on the map.\n\nThrough Backstreet Boys and Jive Records, Marin got their hand on Britney Spears and helped her with the song “Baby One More Time,” which became her first number-one hit song, and to this day, it is one of the best-selling singles of all time.\n\nHe was so successful by 2001 that he had people like Simon Cowell saying, if you’ve got Max Martin as your writer, you have a better chance of having a worldwide hit than with anyone else.\n\nSongs Produced By Max Martin\n\nBerry Gordy\n\nIt’s been over 60 years since Gordy founded the groundbreaking record label, which launched the careers of countless legendary artists, such as Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, and Michael Jackson. When he started the label, Gordy had an 800-dollar loan from his family.\n\nBerry Gordy started the label Motown Records in 1959 with just an 800-dollar loan from his family, he said, “when I started out, all I wanted to do was write some songs, make some money and get some girls, not necessarily in that order”. He had an interesting approach to writing music; for example, he said, “When I was broke and needed money, so I wrote a song called “Money (that’s what I want)”, and it was a top hit for those times.\n\nBerry Gordy’s label, Motown, gave black musicians a platform to showcase their talent when it was a struggle to get their music played on the radio.\n\n“What a joy it is to engage oneself in the business of making the music you love for others to enjoy”.\n\nBerry Gordy’s first successful recording act was The Miracles, an American vocal group that performed in the pop, soul, R&B, and rock and roll genres. Berry Gordy had an excellent eye for discovering talent, as he did with Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. The last one signed the contract in 1968 when Jackson was just 9, along with the entire band “Jackson 5.”\n\nSongs Produced By Berry Gordy\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nThree-time Grammy award winner, he is responsible for hits such as “Good Times,” “He’s the greatest dancer,” “We are family” by Sister Sledge, “ Let’s dance” by David Bowie, “Like a Virgin” by Madonna, and “Get Lucky” by Daft Punk.\n\nFrom a very young age, Niles Rodgers had to learn to be independent because of his family background. Although he had many hobbies as a child, he gravitated towards music. There was something about his brain that lit up when he listened to music, listening to some of the artists, especially from his parents, Nancy Wilson and Billy Holiday.\n\nA fun fact is that he originally picked up the guitar to try and impress a girl. Still, he played so poorly for her that it turned into quite an embarrassing moment, albeit a moment that would define his life, as he committed to mastering the instrument then and there so as never to have a repeat embarrassment! As in 2023, Rolling Stone placed Rodgers 7th on a list of the 250 greatest guitarists of all time, writing: “There’s ‘influential,’ then there’s ‘massively influential’, then there’s Nile Rodgers… a true innovator who never slows down, still making history with his guitar.”\n\nAs the Co-founder of CHIC, Nile pioneered a musical language that generated chart-topping hits like “Le Freak”, the biggest selling single in the history of Atlantic Records and sparked the advent of hip-hop with “Good Times” and “Rapper’s Delight”.\n\nSongs Produced By Nile Rodgers\n\nSkrillex\n\nHis name is Sonny John Moore, but to his millions of fans, he’s known as Skrillex, the King of the Dubstep. Before the Skrillex era, he was just a singer of an Emo band called “From First Yo Last” with a tsunami of success. The genre he lived in a bit, like underground punk rock and electro raves, made a good impression on him for his future in Dubstep.\n\nHowever, things took a turn for the worse because of health issues that required vocal cords surgery and eventually forced the band off the road, ironically that turned out to be a blessing in disguise for this young musician. So, in 2007, Moore left the band for his solo career and began producing music for himself and other artists.\n\nSkrillex debuted as an electronic music producer in 2010 with the dubstep EP “My Name is Skrillex.” After that, he released tracks like “Scary Monsters and Nice Spirites” and “Bangarang.” These songs showcased his ability to blend electronic, rock, and hip-hop elements into a cohesive sound. His distinctive production style quickly obtained attention and a large following.\n\nIn addition, he worked with other artists across different genres, for example, Justin Bieber’s “Where Are You Now” or “The Sadness Will Never End” with the band Bring Me the Horizon. Skrillex has also contributed to film and video game soundtracks, further showcasing his versatility as a producer. His work on the “Wreck-It Ralph” and “Kingdom Hearts III” soundtracks highlights his ability to adapt his style to different contexts.\n\nSongs produced By Skrillex\n\nCalvin Harris\n\nBetter known by his stage name of Calvin Harris, Adam Richard Wiles is a Scottish DJ, singer, songwriter and record producer. His debut album was certified gold and spawned several top-ten singles. Harris has written and produced albums for several big-name stars like Kylie Minogue and Rihanna on their song “We Found Love”.\n\nHarris first gained attention with his debut album, “I Created Disco,” released in 2007. The album featured hits like “Acceptable in the 80s” and “The Girls,” which showcased his talent for crafting catchy melodies and danceable beats. His follow-up albums continued to produce chart-topping singles, solidifying his status in the music world.\n\nAs a peak note, they reached the fact that Haris broke the previous record in the UK for the most top ten hits from a studio album, previously held by Michael Jackson. Also, Forbes listed him as the highest-paid DJ of 2013.\n\nSongs produced By Calvin Harris\n\nAvicii\n\nAvicii pioneered the dance music scene, known for its melodic and emotionally resonant productions. His work has had a lasting influence on the genre, inspiring many artists with his unique blend of electronic and acoustic elements.\n\nAvicii, or Tim Bergling, began making music at 16, inspired by his brother, a DJ. He taught himself how to use a pirate version of FL Studio, and by 2009, he was a prolific producer releasing music back-to-back with his brother.\n\nTwo-time Grammy nominee Avicii was famous for his 40 sets of hit collaborations, including “Wake me up” with Aloe Blacc, “A sky full of stars” with Coldplay, and ” Lonely Together” with Rita Ora. He was a multifaceted artist who crafted soulful melodies and drove rhythms as a songwriter and producer. The tireless energy he poured into his craft made him who he was.\n\nAlthough he is no longer with us, his impact on the music industry has not been forgotten. For example, on 2024/04/20, Tomorrowland Radio hosted an Avicii tribute the entire day. The highlight was that for the first time in 10 years, Avicii’s Tomorrowland 2014 set finally got live-streamed on radio, bringing us Tons of IDs in extremely good audio quality.\n\nSongs Produced By Avicii\n\nDeadmau5 (Joel Zimmerman)\n\nJoel Zimmerman grew up in Niagara Falls and was early interested in electronics and mechanical things. He spent his youth dismantling machines, putting them back together, and becoming obsessed with video games. However, when his parents divorced in his teens, he took to raving as a form of expression.\n\nJoel always seemed ahead of the curve, advocating for computers in music production long before anyone else had considered it. He was a wizard on the computer and would spend his time in chat rooms back when the internet was in its infancy; when a dead mouse caused his computer to crash, that story evolved into his online username and later into his scene name.\n\nAfter high school, he moved to Toronto and befriended a fellow programmer. These two made a joke track that jabbed at how formulaic house music was. As a result, they created a good piece of music, possibly “Can’t remember the name.”\n\nAs a final note of this paragraph, we would like to mention a couple of Deadmau5 tracks that, according to our editorial staff, are worth listening to: “Bot” with unique textures and distinctive sound effects, “Some Chords”, “I remember” with Kaskade, and “Strobe.”\n\nMusic Produced By Deadmau5\n\nDaft Punk (Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo)\n\nEven though they haven’t dropped anything in over 10 years and have barely performed a dozen times in the last decade, they remain one of the most iconic groups in modern music, having inspired countless hits while creating dozens of their own.\n\nThough they eventually worked with industry giants like Kanye, the Weekend, Pharrell Williams, and Giorgio Moroder while simultaneously releasing their own chart-topping music, Daftpunk wasn’t universally loved from the start. Critics had no special appreciation for their music.\n\nDaftpunk had become a living legend overnight, and while “Random Access Memories” remains a fresh-sounding masterpiece to this day, when it came out, we had no idea it was not only their magnum opus but also their swan song.\n\nSongs Produced By Daft Punk\n\nMetro Boomin\n\nMetro Boomin deserves a spot on this list as he did redefine what a modern producer is these days, as he’s very upfront in the industry, whereas most producers take more of a behind-the-scenes role. His songs are everywhere, thanks to collaborations with rappers who have been on the scene for years. How to recognize his tracks simply by the producer tag “If young Metro don’t trust I’m gonna sh**t you” was recorded and done by frequent collaborator and industry icon Future.\n\nInitially, Metro wanted to rap and only started making beats so that he would have instrumentals to rap over. Because he couldn’t afford to buy beats at the time, he would get a lot of his inspiration for beats from the three six mafia sound that came up the generation before him. Metro would send beats to artists he connected with via Twitter, after years of doing this, he got a song with Alley Boy featuring Yo Gotti and young Jeezy. He went home and waited at his computer for live mixtapes to drop the song, At this point he knew this is what he wanted to do with his life.\n\nHe wanted to be the next super producer, but things wouldn’t be all that easy, especially because he was still in high school. Years later, his music caught the attention of many big names, such as Gucci Mane, Future, and Ludacris, who would soon rap on his beats.\n\nIn 2013, Metro Boomin’s career would take a turn for the best. Just before dropping out of college, his song Karate Chop with Future would peak at #82 on the Billboard Hot 100, and things would start to take off. He also worked with every major producer like Southside of 808 Mafia, Sony Digital, Zaitova, TM 88 and Honorable Ceno.\n\nHe is still collaborating with the artists mentioned, including Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott, The Weekend, and John Legend. His behavior and attitude towards music and people have earned him much respect, and any of the mentioned artists are ready to help him with anything. Songs Produced By Metro Boomin\n\nSongs Produced By Metro Boomin\n\nFinneas\n\nFinneas Baird O’Connell, is from Los Angeles, California born in July 1997, his story of music starts in 2010 at the age of 12 when he attended a songwriting class with his mum, this is where he falls in love with writing and producing music. For a short time, he was a member of a band, as a singer and music writer, by the 2015 he wrote the record “Ocean Eyes” for the band, but after giving the record to his little sister Billie Eilish he realized that it suited her vocal style better.\n\nAnd this is where the big story begins…\n\nFinneas as a music producer, helped with the debut album for Billie Eilish “When we all fall asleep where do we go?”, scoring 82/100 on Metacritic. They won a lot of Grammys together: Best Pop Vocal Album, Best Engineered Album, Non-classical, Producer of the Year, Record of the Year, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year for the “Bad Guy”. Finneas is receiving both production and songwriting credits for the full record.
