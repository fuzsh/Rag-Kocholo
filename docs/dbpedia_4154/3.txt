Serbia and Montenegro participated in the Eurovision Song Contest twice, from 2004. Their debut was a success, as the country finished second with the performance of Željko Joksimović. In 2005, the second performance ended 7th, courtesy of the band No Name from Podgorica, Montenegro. Serbia and Montenegro is one of the few countries that have sent all the songs in one of the official languages.

They were supposed to take part in the 2006 contest, but pulled out due to the Montenegrin Independence Referendum, but both countries then came back in 2007, with a win for Serbia.

Trivia[]

Serbia and Montenegro withdrew from the 2006 contest. They already entered to the Semi Final by not pulling out early enough. They automatically placed last in the contest they didn't compete in.

Serbia and Montenegro's votes were actually from Serbia alone, as Montenegro did not televise the event.

The country was subject to a 12-year expulsion by the EBU that was brought out by wars breaking out in former Yugoslavia, which the nation participated in.
