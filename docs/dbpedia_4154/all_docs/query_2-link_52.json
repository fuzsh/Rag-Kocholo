        "text": "Presiding over one of the world’s most perfect natural deep-water harbours – at the end of an inland bay that gives any Norwegian fjord a run for its money – Kotor’s cobbled streets, Venetian Republic palazzi, ancient town walls and eponymous fortress are unmissable. Beyond the walls, a string of white stone villages made up of sailors' and fishermen’s cottages and the imposing homes of their captains. The beautiful churches where they prayed for a safe return before each voyage hug the shore of the bay.\n\nThings to do in Kotor\n\nStroll around the walled old town and take a break under a stately poplar tree planted after the great earthquake of 1667 in quiet Cinema Square before heading up a narrow alley of 16th-century houses. Make your way up the 1,350-odd steps to the top of the fortress that looms 280 metres above the town, before taking a slow drive along the coast to the village of Stoliv, then taking in the extravagant Italianate Church of the Mother of God and making time for lunch at waterside Mademoiselle in Prcanj on your way.\n\nWhere to stay in Kotor\n\nIn a renovated 17th-century building in Kotor old town, the small boutique Hotel Hippocampus has smart rooms in an excellent location. A mile or two around the bay in the picturesque coastal village of Prčanj, Palazzo Sbutega (pictured) is an exquisitely restored seafront home with a serene stone-flagged courtyard with a swimming pool. Five metres from the front door is a private pontoon on the seafront for lounging and swimming. Rent one of the five guest rooms or take over the whole house if you're travelling in a group.\n\nMontenegro is a nation of sailors and highlanders, and Perast, which commands the entrance to the Bay of Kotor, is its maritime soul. Peter the Great sent his nobles here to learn to sail when he founded the Russian navy and, at the town’s height, the waters around Perast bristled with the masts of nearly four hundred warships and merchant's vessels. The splendour of the tiny town reflects this bygone prowess, and an astonishing sixteen churches jostle for space with the grand baroque stone palaces of merchant princes, bishops and admirals and the towers built to protect them.\n\nThings to do in Perast\n\nIf you are driving, stop on the way at Luka’s Oyster Farm by nearby Ljuta, for fresh oysters with a glass of local white wine. Take a quick look around the small Perast town museum before hopping on one of the regular boats across to Our Lady of the Rocks. The 17th-century church was built on the Adriatic’s only artificial island, created – according to legend – from over two hundred years of sailors dropping rocks in the sea following the discovery of an icon of the Virgin Mary on a rocky outcrop at the spot in 1452.\n\nDespite being just 20 minutes from an international airport, the charmingly rural Luštica peninsula was only joined to the mainland by a paved road in the 1970s and since then the pace of development has remained mercifully slow. At night jackals call to each other in the dense maquis beyond the terraced olive groves, while during the day turtles amble across the narrow, winding road that loops around the peninsula, connecting its handful of small hillside hamlets. This is where locals sell homemade fruit brandy, wine and delicious pršut (Montenegrin prosciutto), and rocky tracks descend through shady umbrella pines to secret beaches and hidden Yugoslav submarine tunnels.\n\nThings to do on the Luštica peninsula\n\nTake a swim out to the island monastery of St. Vavedenje, off wild Arza beach, and then eat some of the best seafood on the Adriatic at Ribarsko Selo (pictured) – sweeping Žanjice beach is just around the corner. Enjoy a quad-bike tour of the peninsula and clamber around the massive abandoned Austro-Hungarian Kabala fortress just off the road to Rose. Finish your day with a sundowner and grilled squid at the laid-back Adriatic Tavern as you watch the water turn to gold.\n\nThings to do in Herceg-Novi\n\nBook a wine tasting with a view out to sea at the beautiful Savina vineyard, next to the monastery of the same name, or take a private boat tour to the Blue Cave on the nearby Luštica peninsula. Finish the day with supper at the family-run Sikimić Tavern (bookings essential at least two days in advance), located in the ancient hill village of Žlijebi at 700m above sea level and with views of the whole Montenegrin coast stretching to the horizon.\n\nWhere to stay in Herceg-Novi\n\nOn the edge of town, Hotel Lazure is centred around a restored 18th-century Venetian Lazaret, and has smart rooms, a spa with a large indoor pool, and a beautiful stretch of private beach.\n\nThings to do in Lake Skadar\n\nThe best way to explore the lake is to rent a kayak in the picturesque lakeside town Virpazar. While there, taste wines and brandies together with local cheese and cured meats at the family-run Buk Winery. A great day trip is to take a drive along the southern shore of the lake through small fishing villages before going for a swim at the sandy Murići Beach (pictured), with a view out to the working 14th-century Beška island monastery."
