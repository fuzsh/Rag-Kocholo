The authors examine how social norms are triggered by particular schemata and are grounded in scripts. Just as schemata are embedded in a network, so too are social norms, and they can be primed through spreading activation. Moreover, the expectations that allow a social norm’s existence are inherently grounded in particular scripts and schemata. Using interventions that have targeted gender norms, open defecation, female genital cutting, and other collective issues as examples, the authors argue that ignoring the cognitive underpinnings of a social norm can hamper the effectiveness of behavioral interventions.\n\nKeywords\n\nsocial normsscriptsschematabehavioral changesemantic networks\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nSocial Philosophy and Policy , Volume 35 , Issue 1 , Summer 2018 , pp. 23 - 53\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0265052518000079 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Social Philosophy and Policy Foundation 2018\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.
