        "text": "Emerging subdisciplines, fields and themes of research at the Department of Ethnology and Anthropology2\n\nWhen thinking about the emerging trends in Serbian ethnology and anthropology, my aim was to present all the subdisciplines that have been developed through research and teaching at the Department. Some of the subdisciplines that developed in the previous decades have shown innovativeness in development of new fields and themes, while other subdisciplines have emerged only recently.\n\nWhile making a common list of the mentioned subdisciplines, in majority of cases their names remained as mentioned by the respective faculty. In few cases only, I changed them a bit in order to enable grouping of related or compatible subdisciplines into a larger whole. In other cases, I treated them as fields of study within larger subdisciplinary frameworks.\n\nThe structure of this part of the article is organized according to these larger wholes, whereby each comprises of at least two or more related subdisciplines. These wholes (groups) are presented according to the counter alphabetical order of their names. Within each group, the subdisciplines follow the order given in their titles, and are described according to the fields and themes mentioned by the faculty engaged in their development. In this, I tried to combine the chronological principle of their development, and the order of seniority of the faculty that engaged in them. The fields and themes of each subdiscipline were given as a summary of the sum of individual engagements, with references to their publications pointing to individuals as contributors.\n\nThe titles of the larger wholes are: (1) World Cultures, Multiculturalism and Cultural Heritage, (2) Urban Condition: Life and Culture of Cities, (3) Science, Education, and Methodology, (4) Social and Cultural Diversity: Religion, Ethnicity, Migrations, Kinship and Gender, (5) Politics and Economics, (6) Material Culture and Fashion, (7) History (and Politics) of Ethnology and Anthropology, (8) Human Condition: Body, Cognition, Emotions, Old Age, Health and Wellbeing, Medicine and Pandemics, (9) Folklore and Popular Culture, and (10) Arts: Visual, Literary and Musical."
