        "text": "Dubrovnik – the most filmed movie destination in Croatia\n\nDubrovnik is often called the gem of Adriatic. It is remarkable for its history, cobbled roads, narrow streets, ancient buildings, and friendly locals.\n\nIt also gained popularity amongst the Hollywood movie industry, as it became one of the most wanted filming locations in this part of Europe. Maybe your favorite movie has been filmed there as well. Check out the list below, book your next trip to Dubrovnik, and relive your favorite movie scenes.\n\n1. Game of Thrones\n\nOne of the most popular TV shows, Game of Thrones, has been shot in Dubrovnik. Due to its location, architectural design, and fantastic scenery, it was the perfect spot for King’s Landing, a fictional city in the series.\n\nThe late-medieval walled city has a unique Old Town with breathtaking Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque churches, monasteries, palaces, and fountains. Other exceptional sites in Dubrovnik are St Blaise’s church, Dubrovnik Cathedral, the Sponza Palace, the Dominican monastery, and the Franciscan monastery featured in the TV series.\n\n2. Emerald City\n\nEmerald City is a US imaginary TV series based on the Oz book by L. Frank Baum, set in the fictional Land of Oz.\n\nDubrovnik inspired the city of Oz and has been used as the backdrop of the filming scenes. However, the series was not physically filmed there, as the production team built almost the whole city in the studios and developed magical detailed sets based on the city. You can gaze at the beauties of Dubrovnik on one of our Croatian cruises.\n\n3. Robin Hood\n\nDubrovnik was used in the movie Robin Hood as a city destination that mirrors a medieval Nottingham. Dubrovnik’s timeworn city streets and historical buildings wonderfully represent that era. Several spots around the Old City were used as scenes in the movie. We can admire the port, the main street Stradun, and St. Dominic Street. More than a hundred film professionals were filming the scenes for over three weeks. The main star of the movie, Jamie Foxx was amazed by the beauty of Croatia.\n\n4. The Last Jedi – Star Wars\n\nIn the last year, the Star Wars crew took over the streets of Dubrovnik. Dubrovnik received a makeover with high-tech equipment, blast doors, and walking stormtroopers to film this Star Wars episode. Dubrovnik was used as the set place of the casino planet Canto Bight.\n\n5. James Bond\n\nThere is a rumor that the most famous spy will take over the city of Dubrovnik. Some sources state that the James Bond filming scouts secured Dubrovnik as one of the filming locations for its next movie release. You should tour the city and imagine the 007 agent sipping his martini in one of the restaurants.\n\nWe invite you to be the hero of your journey and explore Dubrovnik your way. Connect with us, and let us help you plan the perfect trip."
