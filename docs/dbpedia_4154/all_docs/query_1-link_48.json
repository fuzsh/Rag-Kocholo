OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BOB CORKER, U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE The Chairman. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will come to order. I want to thank everybody for their interest and our committee members for being here. If I could just do two housekeeping measures while Senator Burr, Senator Roberts, and Senator Dole are making their way in, hopefully very quickly, I would like to say two things. I know we have a number of people that we love here who sometimes like to protest. Good to see you. Thank you for waving. [Laughter.] The Chairman. I, in the past, have been able to cause people who are arrested to be un-arrested, but that has ended. So please don't do anything that causes us to have to call you out of order, because the process, once it starts, cannot be stopped anymore. So we thank you for being here. We thank you for being considerate and respectful of people who are here today besides yourself. Secondly, we had planned to have a markup on the AUMF on Thursday. The minority has asked that we delay that markup for a few days as they consider it a little bit more fully. So it will be likely that we will do the AUMF markup instead of next Thursday sometime early in the next week. And we will be releasing the documents relative to that on Friday. But we thank you all for your continued work on this issue. Senator Menendez. Mr. Chairman, may I make a remark? The Chairman. Yes. Senator Menendez. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate you taking a little more time on the AUMF, because as we speak, we do not have a final version. So in order to give members time on one of the most important votes they ever take, which is the Authorization for the Use of Military Force, I think members want a considered approach. I would urge the chair to consider, once he has a final version, not only to share it with us but also to consider the possibility of a singular hearing on that specific AUMF, and then that would give members an informed opportunity to develop whatever views they have on it, what votes they might want to take, and what amendments they might want to offer. But I appreciate in the first instance giving the time for the purpose. The Chairman. Absolutely. Sure. And I think you know we were prepared to release it today. We will probably wait until tomorrow. Maybe what we do, with consultation with you, is consider having that hearing next Thursday instead and then having the markup to follow. But, obviously, this has been something we all have discussed for many, many, many years. With that, we have three distinguished Senators here who have other things to do. We typically would give our opening comments first from the dais, but out of respect for their time and who they are, we would like for them to go ahead and give their comments, and then we will move back to regular order. Again, we thank you all for being here. I do not know what order you would like to start, but it sounds like we are starting with Senator Roberts. STATEMENT OF HON. PAT ROBERTS, U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS Senator Roberts. Thank you, Chairman Corker, Ranking Member Menendez, and distinguished members of the committee. It is an honor to be here today in support of my Kansas friend and colleague Mike Pompeo as the President's nominee for Secretary of State. For more than a decade, I have known Mike, first as a friend and a business leader, then a congressional colleague, and most recently as the leader of our intelligence community. At home, Kansas knows Mike as a family man, a devoted husband to Susan and father to Nick, both of whom are here. I know how proud you are. They know him as a man of integrity and honesty, of hard work and perseverance. He built a successful business, understood the responsibility of maintaining a payroll, and helped to bring job growth and prosperity to Wichita, Kansas. They know him to have Kansas common sense and to be plainspoken, to tell it like it is. Senator Dole and I might share just a little bit of that, too. They know him as a statesman, a man who listens to others, who works well with people, and who can negotiate solutions in a very effective manner. Given these qualities, I believe that Mike Pompeo's next challenge in this troubled and tumultuous world is perhaps a challenge for which he is best suited. As our Nation's most senior diplomat, Mike will be forthright. He will be forceful. He will be thoughtful. He will give the President and those of us in Congress candid counsel. He will be a man of his word. It is in his DNA. Just look at his bio. Mike is Army strong. He graduated at the top of his class at West Point and then served as a cavalry officer, patrolling the Iron Curtain before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He later joined the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry in the Fourth Infantry Division. After completing his military service, Mike attended Harvard Law School where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. Mike understands the law. After practicing law, Mike returned to his mother's roots in south central Kansas, running several very successful businesses in Wichita before running for Congress in 2010. He came to Washington with a very strong desire to serve the people of the 4th District and the rest of our State and to make a difference. He sought a seat on the House Intelligence Committee at a time when intelligence-gathering methods were under fire, before he went on to lead the Central Intelligence Agency. As I told my good friend and chairman, Richard Burr, and my colleagues on the Intelligence Committee just last year, Mike Pompeo understands and respects the role of Congress and the need for vigorous oversight. I say to those who serve our country here and in Washington and at diplomatic posts around the world, Mike Pompeo will work hard to earn your trust. He will seek to build bridges, to rely upon expertise, to debate and discuss, but always--always--with respect. Whether it is managing crises in Syria or North Korea, complex relationships with Russia or China, or humanitarian disasters in Myanmar or Yemen, Mike will represent American ideals and values backed by the strength of leadership of the free world. History has shown us time and again that we cannot sit back and wait, given the most serious challenges we face in the world and the role that our Nation plays. Whenever there is a void, the world pays a price. [Disturbance in hearing room.] The Chairman. Senator Roberts, I am sure that happens regarding soybeans in the Ag Committee often. [Laughter.] Senator Roberts. It may happen with me and the President when I talk to him about all of the tariffs that we are going to talk about this morning. [Laughter.] Senator Roberts. I was right in the middle of the best part, too. [Laughter.] Senator Roberts. I said, wherever there is a void, the world pays a price. I guess we just did. Wherever there is a void, the world pays a price. We need Mike Pompeo at the State Department, and we need him now. It is my fervent hope that this committee and the full Senate will proceed with a swift confirmation for the President's nominee. I know that Mike Pompeo will serve us proudly. It is now a privilege and an honor to turn to my mentor, my friend, and recent Congressional Gold Medal recipient, Senator Bob Dole. STATEMENT OF HON. BOB DOLE, FORMER U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS Senator Dole. Well, nice to see all you people up there. I cannot see very well, so you look good. [Laughter.] The Chairman. You look very good, and we are glad to have you here. Senator Dole. Well, one thing about Mike Pompeo, and I want to welcome Susan and Nick, he will hit the ground running. He knows the territory. He knows the people. I got acquainted with him as CIA Director, so he is ready to go, and he will be our top diplomat. What we would like to urge is quick confirmation, because he is needed by the President and the rest of us who live in this wonderful country. But Mike Pompeo, I don't know, he is just a brilliant guy, at the top of his class at West Point, a businessman, a congressman, a father, a husband. And all those things added up with the experience he has, he is ready to go. And we thank you for holding this hearing. The Chairman. Thank you so much, and all of us are thrilled to have you here, and I am so glad you were honored the way you were recently in the Capitol. Thank you for sharing your time with us. Senator Burr, who chairs the Intelligence Committee. STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BURR, U.S. SENATOR OF NORTH CAROLINA Senator Burr. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and to my colleagues, the advantage to going last for any nominee is you have heard everything about that nominee. And then there is Mike Pompeo, because the story goes on past that. I think one has to ask what makes a great leader, and what you have heard is a personal story about Mike Pompeo that I think, in anybody's checklist, if you saw those things, you would say, here is a great candidate. Here is a great nominee. West Point as a teenager, first in his class. A military leader. A lawyer from Harvard, picked for the Harvard Law Review. Successful business. Served three terms representing people from Kansas. And when asked, responded and took, I think, the toughest job at the toughest time, and that was Director of the CIA. Now, during his confirmation hearing, I asked Mike to lead the CIA in an ethical, moral, and legal manner. And I am here to tell you that he did exactly that. Mike has honorably represented and aggressively supported the employees of the CIA. And I think what we need right now is an individual that can bond those great diplomats within the State Department while carrying out the message of this administration's policies abroad. Mike has been responsive, and he has been transparent with the Intelligence Committee, and, more importantly, he has always spoken the truth. Mike's intellectual rigor, his honorable service, and his outstanding judgment make him a natural fit for the Department of State. Now, what I want you to take away from this is Mike Pompeo is a good man. And I want to ask you, and I want to ask all our colleagues in the Senate, if there is ever one where you put politics aside, here it is. Mike exemplifies talent. And I think when we look at nominees who we are sent by an administration, we look for somebody that we are proud of. We look for somebody that has the talent to do the job correctly. I would suggest to you that Mike Pompeo represents everything that we pray in a nominee that they would have. And that as we go forward, we have an opportunity to say to those young people around this country who one day want to give back to their country that, yes, your background does matter. We want the best. We want the brightest. We want the ones that are most committed to do it. And we have an opportunity in Mike Pompeo to select and to confirm an individual that I think speaks for generations to come. I thank the committee for their indulgence. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. We thank you, all three of you. We appreciate having people that we respect so much here before us. We know that you have other business to take care of. You are welcome to stay, but you cannot stay there. [Laughter.] The Chairman. So we will bring the witness forward. While we are reorganizing--and, Senator Dole, again, thank you for being here--I want to recognize the fact that Ambassador Haley, I think, is joining us. I have not been able to see her yet in the audience. Thank you for being here. Director Mike Pompeo, we welcome you here today, and we thank you for your willingness to serve our country yet again, this time in the role of Secretary of State. We are also glad that your family is here with you, and we extend our thanks to them for the sacrifices that your service requires of them. You have been nominated by the President at a very important time in our Nation's history. Our country's standing in the world has been on the decline over the past decade or more, and that certainly continues. Throughout the 20th century, our allies viewed the United States as a reliable partner and a source of stability, a friend whose ideals and leadership made our world a better place. Unfortunately, today, we are not counted on as we once were. The chasm between what our leaders say and the actions that they take can have a devastating impact. I think about where Syria would be today had we done what we said in 2013 when the opposition posed a significant threat to the regime. Assad crossed the red line, used chemical weapons, and we did nothing. The loss of momentum was palpable. Our inconsistencies have created vacuums that are being eagerly filled by those who do not share our values. When the leader of our country speaks with the full might of the most powerful military the world has ever known behind him, he must choose his words carefully. His words and actions have global ramifications and send a signal to both our foes and allies regarding our level of commitment to longstanding alliances, our desire for beneficial trade relationships, and our very belief in the ideals we claim to embody. But while at times the President may act or speak impulsively, we have also seen that good counsel has led the President to evolve, from my perspective, to a much better place on a number of important issues. I believe the next Secretary of State must continue to provide such counsel, even when it is difficult. If confirmed, you must continue to provide advice to the President that allows him to view a given situation holistically and not make decisions that focus on the impact to one domestic group or foreign government. Any President has numerous voices from both inside and outside the White House vying for his attention. An effective Secretary of State must be able to prioritize the issues for the President and attempt to drown out the noise and chaos that can so often distract and bog down the leader of the free world from making sound and informed decisions. I know that you have developed a close relationship with the President, and I believe that relationship could well serve you, if you are confirmed as Secretary of State. However, many strong voices have been terminated or resigned. That is why I think it is fair for our members to ask whether your relationship is rooted in a candid, healthy, give- and-take dynamic, or whether it is based on a deferential willingness to go along to get along. Americans often think of the Secretary of State solely in his or her capacity as our chief diplomat, racing around the world to broker compromise, prevent war, or negotiate treaties. And no doubt, your success as a diplomat, as you well know, is key to keeping our men and women in uniform that we treasure so much out of harm's way. While all of that is true, this position also requires the person occupying the office to be every bit a manager as a diplomatic envoy. The Secretary must effectively manage multibillion dollar budgets and a workforce of tens of thousands. This is the part of the job that isn't flashy and doesn't usually get much media attention, but it is just as important as any other aspect of the Secretary's duties. In order to execute foreign policy effectively, the Secretary must have a fully functional department behind him. During your tenure at the CIA, you demonstrated that you understand the need for having a functioning workforce. I am hopeful that, if confirmed, you will make it a priority to fill those key positions and to work to earn the trust of the career public servants in both the department's foreign and civil service. Not only will the next Secretary of State have to adapt to a unique decision-making process and have significant management issues to tackle, but there are also numerous crucial policy issues around the world that must be addressed. While the obstacles we face are daunting, they are by no means insurmountable. The history of American foreign policy is filled with Secretaries of State who have changed the world for the better in the face of adversity. In fact, those who have gone down in history as great are those who dealt with the greatest challenges. When faced with what seemed like impossible odds, they rose to the occasion. That is what, when we are at our best, we do as Americans. And it is my hope that you will do the same, if confirmed. Examining a nominee to be Secretary of State is one of the most solemn duties of this committee. You will be asked many questions about the policy issues facing our Nation and your vision for the Department of State. Thank you again for your willingness to serve, and I look forward to your testimony and answers. And with that, I will turn to our distinguished ranking member and my friend, Bob Menendez. STATEMENT OF HON. BOB MENENDEZ, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director, congratulations on your nomination and welcome to you and your family on your second Senate confirmation hearing. This committee considers your nomination after nearly a year and a half of reckoning with President Trump's erratic approach to foreign policy, which has left our allies confused and our adversaries emboldened. It is an approach driven by impulse, not strategy. President Trump's America-first policies have left America isolated and alone in the midst of unprecedented challenges, challenges from an aggressive Russia who seeks to undermine the international order we helped create after World War II, that has brought peace and stability to the world for nearly three quarters of a century; a destabilized Middle East; the ongoing threat of terrorism; an emboldened China asserting itself in the South China Sea militarily and economically, as well as right here in the Western Hemisphere; Assad, a butcher who has used chemical weapons against innocent civilians; Maduro tightening his grip on his regime, starving Venezuelans in one of the most oil-rich countries in the world. Meanwhile, President Trump has abandoned the very Democratic values and ideals that have shaped America's role as a beacon to our friends and as a bulwark against a world in crisis. Now, I was pleased to hear you say earlier this week that you plan to support the career public servants at the State Department. The problem is, we have an emaciated State Department under this administration. Let me be clear. Members of this committee expect every Secretary of State to champion the department and its mission. We expect you to advocate for robust diplomacy as the first line of defense against sending our sons and daughters into war. And to do that, we need a strong diplomatic corps and an A-I-D that compliments and enhances our foreign policy. Now, as CIA Director, your job was to conduct covert operations, and collect, evaluate, and provide intelligence to policymakers, including the President. As the Secretary of State, you will not be providing intelligence for other people to use to make policy; you will be the person executing the foreign policy of the United States of America. Many countries in the world already think the State Department is an extension of the CIA, so how you conduct yourself moving forward will be critical to our diplomacy. As the Senate considers your nomination to be the President's top foreign policy adviser, we must ask: Will you enable President Trump's worst instincts? Will you advocate for long-term strategies to protect U.S. national security and interests, or will you be lurching from crisis to crisis, as we have seen under this administration? Will you advocate for robust diplomacy, or will you take America into unnecessary and costly wars? Will you stand up to President Trump and say, no, you are wrong in that view, Mr. President, or will you be a yes man? Americans are scared that this President, the commander in chaos, will lead them into war. This is not a time for taunts and tweets. On Russia, the intelligence community and our military leaders have repeatedly stated that Russia poses ongoing threats to the United States' national security and to our allies, yet President Trump cannot bring himself to even acknowledge the Russian threat. He says that a court-granted search warrant is an attack on our country but cannot call out Russian cyberattacks on our democracy. We have pushed the President to put together a real strategy to counter Russian aggression. We urge the President to implement the mandatory sanctions that Congress overwhelmingly passed and he has failed to implement. North Korea poses a real and nuclear threat to the United States, our citizens, and our allies. The American people are deeply worried by an erratic President who uses schoolboy taunts when talking about nuclear war. A meeting is not a strategy. Preventing nuclear war requires thoughtful diplomacy, preparation, clear objectives. Will you enable the voices around the President seeking to go to war, or will you press for an empowered diplomatic path to protect the safety of all Americans? Mr. Director, what is your actual plan to stop North Korea from getting a nuclear weapon? Turning to Iran, everyone knows I voted against the Iran nuclear deal and was vociferous about it, but I also share the assessment of your counterparts across national security agencies that it does not serve the United States' national security interest to unilaterally withdraw from the deal absent a strategy for what will replace it and how to get our allies to join us in countering Iran's malign activity outside of the nuclear program and deal with the sunset issues within the nuclear portfolio. Once again, this President is hurling toward a crisis. He is creating unnecessary risks with the very allies we need to confront Iran. So I ask again, Mr. Director, what is your plan? Will you be a voice of reason, or will you support the President's worst instincts? If confirmed as the Secretary of State, you will no longer be operating in the shadows of American foreign policy, but you will be the face and voice of the United States, the representative not just of a bombastic President, but of the American people. Will you champion our values? When the President embraces dictators who quash the free press or suggests doing away with elections, will you stay silent? When the President and those closest to him balk at the very idea of diplomacy and instead advocate unnecessary wars that will cost the blood of our children and the treasure of our coffers, will you go along with them? Or, as our Nation's top diplomat, will you champion diplomacy and offer actual plans? Will you stand up to President Trump and advise him differently when he is wrong, or will you be a yes man? So, Mr. Director, I look forward to hearing your testimony, and the answers to these questions and others, as we go. The Chairman. Thank you, sir. Director, you have been well backgrounded with the three Senators who came before us, so I will not do that. But we thank you for being here. If you could summarize your testimony in about 5 minutes or so, any written documents you have, we will be glad to enter into the record. But with that, thank you for being here. We look forward to your comments. STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE POMPEO OF KANSAS, TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE Mr. Pompeo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am not sure I can do it in 5 minutes, but I will give it my level best. The Chairman. We always try to set a high bar, realizing we are never going to achieve it. Mr. Pompeo. Thank you, Chairman Corker. Ranking Member Menendez, thank you. Thanks for the opportunity to appear here today as the nominee to be the United States Secretary of State. I am grateful to each of you for the attention that you have given us over the past weeks. So many of you have given so much time, and there are so many global matters before us, I am deeply appreciative of that. Should I be confirmed, this regular contact will continue. You can talk to Senator Burr. I worked at that diligently. As a former Member of Congress, I understand the importance of that continued relationship and advice that comes from outside of the executive branch. I would like to take a moment here, too, to thank Secretary Tillerson for his service to the United States and his commitment to a smooth transition, and I would like to thank Secretary Sullivan as well, for him serving in the gap. A personal thank you also to every living former Secretary of State. They each took my call. They found time to spend. I have actually talked to many of them multiple times. Democrats and Republicans, from Secretary Kissinger to Secretary Kerry, were kind enough to visit me and share with me their thoughts on how, if I am confirmed, I would most likely be a successful Secretary of State. And if you know me at all, the two people sitting to my right rear provide my ballast, my balance. Susan keeps the home front humming and is always there to remind me of family issues that affect not just the Pompeos but the family issues that affect every officer at the Central Intelligence Agency as well. And that keeps me humble. It keeps my sense of humor alive. Since I left the private sector and entered public service, they have had lots of opportunities to tell me to step back, to step away, but they have not. They have encouraged it. They have promoted it. And they are incredibly supportive of my efforts to serve America. A moment here, too, to the men and women of the CIA, to say that it has been an honor and a privilege and a joy doesn't do justice to these past 15 months. I have demanded an awful lot of you. I have set the expectation bar high. I have pushed responsibility and authority down to each and every one of you, and along with that, the required accountability. And you, the warriors of the CIA, have delivered for America, for President Trump, and for me. Perhaps the highest compliments of our work come from our adversaries who fear and are in awe of the institution, and from our partner services around the world who have ask for more training, more intelligence, more joint operations than ever. To you, if I am confirmed, this will not be goodbye, because no matter how this nomination process ends, I will be with you, I will support you, and I will admire you. Finally, I want to thank the President for his confidence and trust in me. My job at the CIA has been to deliver world- class data and facts to help inform he and the other senior policymakers in America. I am honored that he selected me to help carry out many of those same decisions as his chief diplomat. Senators, if I am confirmed, I will raise my hand and swear an oath to defend our Constitution for the seventh time in my life. The first time, I was 18 years old, a West Point cadet. With this oath, I will swear to defend the exceptionalism enshrined in our Constitution, which provides for our obligation to engage in diplomacy and model the very best of America to the world. Make no mistake, America is uniquely blessed, and with those blessings comes a duty to lead. As I have argued throughout my time in public service, if we do not lead for democracy, for prosperity, and for human rights around the world, who will? No other Nation is so equipped with the same blend of power and principle. Two things I want to try to answer for you in the time I have remaining. Who is Mike Pompeo? And who are his thoughts and plans to lead our State Department? I am sure we will get to talk about that some more as well. I was born in Orange, California. We did not have a whole lot of money in my family, but I enjoyed school. And my brother and sister and I, we all had fun learning. When I was a teenager, I was employee of the month at Baskin Robbins, not once, but twice. [Laughter.] Mr. Pompeo. I am a movie buff. I have a soft spot for my golden retrievers. I love meatballs that I make from my dad's recipe. And I enjoyed being a fifth grade Sunday schoolteacher for kids that just did not want to sit still. And although he will dispute this, I can beat my son in cornhole every day. I love Revolutionary War history, country music, show tunes, and college basketball. But it was my appointment at the United States Military Academy that changed my life. It was when I traveled, it was the first time I had ever been east of the Mississippi River. I have seen some describe my leadership style as blue collar. Fair enough. I am not afraid to get my hands dirty, and you will seldom find me ensconced on the senior level of any building. I have no discomfort with directness or confrontation. I prefer face-to-face as opposed to email. I do not hold grudges. I work toward a mission. And I will always make room for student programs and youth groups. They are what will set our Nation on its correct course. They are our future. Just this past Monday, I got to swear in a big group of CIA officers. It was always a very special moment. This one was very unique. Now let me turn to how I intend to work as a Secretary of State, if I am confirmed. Throughout my time in Congress and the CIA, I have met hundreds of State Department employees. I know them. And in the past few weeks, I have had a chance to meet dozens and dozens more in briefings. To a person, they expressed to me their hope to be empowered in their roles and to have a clear understanding of the President's mission. That will be my first priority. They have also shared how demoralizing it is to have so many vacancies and, frankly, many of them said to not feel relevant. I will do my part to end those vacancies. I will need your help. And I will work every day to provide dedicated leadership and convey my faith in their work, their professionalism, just as I have done with the workforce at the Central Intelligence Agency. When I took over as Director, the CIA had just completed a massive restructuring. Immediately after my arrival, I began speaking at every meeting, every conversation about the agency's mission. I talked about commander's intent. We do these small things that are called, ``Meet with Mike.'' Not a very original name, I will concede. But we gather up the first 50 to come talk to me, so that I have a chance to listen to them. I wanted them to know what the President's and America's desire was for them, and I wanted them to understand that I was depending on them. And you should know, when the team needed additional resources, I defended them. I asked for them. I demanded them. And the President, so long as he found value, never hesitated to provide them. I was able to persuade him. And with your help, I will do the same thing at the Department of State. You have my commitment, too, with respect to this. I will work with each of you to fill the vacancies that are at the State Department. This is critical to strengthening the finest diplomatic corps in the world, and America and the world needs us to be that. The second thing I would like to highlight is workforces and their culture. I will spend a lot of time on this. It is important. I will proceed on, but without getting that part right, if the team doesn't understand the mission and isn't working toward the same goal, it is incredibly difficult to think you would achieve it. I have always done that. When I have traveled as part of the agency, I have met with State Department officials. I met with my own team. I spoke to them about the things that I was going to demand of them, the things I was going to permit them to do, and how I was going to hold them accountable to that task. I remember, I want to a location. The housing for officers was simply inadequate. None of you would have allowed your families to be there. I didn't have a lot of time, but I went and spoke with the Ambassador and told him it needed to be fixed. I wanted the State Department families and ours to know that we cared about them enough to provide living quarters that were sufficient for Americans. And you should know I believe deeply that the State Department's workforce must be diverse in the same way I have I worked for that at the CIA, diverse in every sense of the word, race, religion, background, and more. I will work to achieve that diversity, just as I have done in my current role, by focusing on the mission and demanding that every team member-- every team member--be treated equally, with dignity and respect. And I will listen. I had an old, crusty sergeant first class when I was a brand-new second lieutenant who said, ``Lieutenant, if you will just shut up and listen for a bit your, life will be a whole hell of a lot better.'' He was right about that. He taught me a heck of a lot about how to be a good platoon leader. I intend to do that with the talented people that reside at the State Department. Let me talk a little bit about the work itself. By definition, the job description of the Secretary of State is to serve as the President's chief foreign affairs adviser. This was driven home to me in those conversations with every former Secretary of State. To a person, they were remarkably consistent by saying that job number one is to represent the President. For me, this means building substantial relationships with our allies, relationships that President Trump and I can utilize for both tough conversations and productive cooperation. It also means working with our adversaries where needed to make clear objectives and let them know the means by which we intend to achieve them. In this regard, I am fortunate to have a sizable head start. As many as a third of the days at the agency, I was engaged with foreign counterparts. I have led the CIA to forge stronger relationships with those partners all across the world, in the Middle East, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. I have traveled to these regions to demonstrate the commitment that America has to working as their partners. I have also met some folks who did not share many of our objectives. I have tried to find and I have asked my team to find those narrow slivers of common ground where we can work together to deliver the results that America needs us to. Representing America also calls for promoting America's ideals, values, and priorities, because they ultimately determine the trajectory of geopolitics, and we need to do that well. You know, I will close here, as I am approaching the 5 minutes. You should know that I have been an enormous beneficiary in my life of some of the most remarkable diplomatic achievements in American history. I served, as Senator Roberts spoke about, I served on the border between East and West Germany, and I watched diplomats over an extended period of time from both parties achieve an outcome against the Soviet Union and the communist east that prevented my team from having ever to conduct the battle, which we prepared for every day. It was remarkable work from Foreign Service Officers over these many years. I thank them for that. It was the right approach. It was the approach that worked for America. I know some of you have read the story that I am a hawk, I am a hardliner. You know, I read that, and there is no one, as you just heard in what I described, there is no one like someone who served in uniform who understands the value of diplomacy and the terror and tragedy that is war like someone who has served in uniform. It is the last resort. It must always be so. And I intend to work to achieve the President's policies with diplomacy rather than by sending our young men and women to war. Know that I am serving a President who feels the same way, and that while the military balance of power--you all did good work to assist us in continuing to build our military to be the finest in the world. It can set the stage and create leverage, but the best outcomes are always won at the diplomatic table. You know, America's diplomatic engagement, political engagement, foreign policy engagement around the world has always been a big topic of debate. I am sure we will debate vigorously today. All through my life, I have been reminded that once the debates conclude, the carrying out of foreign policy, the actions that America does, make it real. It is a matter of duty to get it right. And while we might agree to disagree today on the what or the how of global involvement, we rarely disagree on why. It is to defend the safety of our families, the prosperity of our Nation, and the survival of freedom in the world. Diplomacy gives us the chance to achieve these goals peacefully. And I thank you for the time, Senator Corker. [The Mr. Pompeo's prepared statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Mike Pompeo, Director of the Central Intelligence Agencv Chairman Corker, Ranking Member Menendez, Senators, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today as the nominee for U.S. Secretary of State. I'm grateful for your attention to my nomination over the last several weeks, particularly at a time when so many matters of global importance demand your focus. Should I be confirmed, the regular contact we've established throughout this process will continue. I'll do my best to pick up your calls on the first ring, and I'll be a regular visitor to the Capitol. Your counsel and support will, if I'm confirmed, be critical to my leadership of the Department of State. I'd also like to recognize former Secretary Tillerson for his dedicated service and commitment to a smooth transition, as well as Deputy Secretary John Sullivan for serving in the gap. A personal thanks to all of the former living Secretaries of State, each of whom has fielded my calls these past weeks. Democrats and Republicans, from Henry Kissinger to John Kerry, you were kind enough to visit with me, offering candid and valuable advice. As I did with former CIA Directors, I will continue our contact should I be confirmed. And, if you know me at all, you know that I derive balance and support from my wife, Susan, and son, Nicholas, who are with me today. Susan keeps our home front humming and is always there to remind me of the family issues affecting not just the Pompeos but every family under my leadership. And Nick? Well, Nick keeps me humble, keeps my sense of humor alive, and provides me, unfiltered, a millennial point of view! Since I left the private sector and re-entered public service, either of them could have asked me to step back into less-visible, less- consuming work. Instead they've encouraged me to give everything I can for as long as I can to this country that we love so much. Thank you, Susan and Nick. To the men and women of the CIA: To say that it has been an honor, a privilege, and a joy doesn't do justice to the gratitude I feel to have served as your leader. I've demanded much over the last 15 months, setting expectations high. I've pushed responsibility and authority through the organization to every officer and, along with that, the required accountability. And you, the warriors of the CIA, have delivered--for America, for President Trump, and for me. Perhaps the highest compliments on our work come from our adversaries, whose fear and awe for our institution have steadily increased; and from our partner services around the world, which ask for more training, more intelligence sharing, and more joint operations than ever. This is not goodbye, because no matter how my nomination process ends, I will be with you, I will support you, and I will admire you. Finally, I want to thank the President for his confidence and trust. My job at the CIA has been to deliver him world class intelligence, data, and facts, to help inform his decisions. I'm honored that he has selected me to help carry out many of those decisions as his chief diplomat. Senators, if confirmed, I would raise my hand and swear an oath to defend our Constitution for the seventh time in my life. The first time was as an eighteen-year-old West Point cadet. With this oath, I would commit to defend the exceptionalism enshrined in our Constitution, which provides for our obligation to engage in diplomacy and model the very best of America to the world. Make no mistake: America is uniquely blessed, and with those blessings comes a duty to lead. As I have argued throughout my time in public service, if we do not lead the calls for democracy, prosperity, and human rights around the world, who will? No other nation is equipped with the same blend of power and principle. During this hearing, I anticipate that you are duty bound to learn and draw out information on two fronts: ``Who is Mike Pompeo?'' and ``What are his thoughts and plans to lead our State Department?'' Here's a good start. I was born in Orange, California and spent every summer on our family farm in Kansas. We didn't have a lot of money growing up, but my sister and brother and I loved school and had fun. When I was a teenager, I was given the ``Employee of the Month'' award twice in my job at the local Baskin-Robbins ice cream store. I'm a movie buff and admit to a soft spot for my golden retrievers. My family says my Italian meatballs, my Dad's recipe, are the best. I loved the challenge of teaching Sunday School to 5th graders who couldn't sit still. Although he would dispute it, I can beat my son, Nick, in corn hole on any given day. I love Revolutionary War history, country music, show tunes, and college basketball. My appointment to the United States Military Academy at age eighteen marked my first travel east of the Mississippi, and those four years at West Point changed my life forever. As a leader, I have been described as ``blue collar''--that is, I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. I don't ever stay sequestered on the executive floor of any building. I have no discomfort with directness or confrontation; I prefer face-to-face conversations over email; I don't hold grudges and I always make time for student and youth programs in the organizations that I run--they are our future. Just this past Monday, I swore in another class of freshly minted CIA officers. It was a very special moment for me. That's a look at who I am. Now for the question of how I would lead the United States Department of State. I will focus on what matters most in any leadership role: actions--not words. Set the Mission & Empower the Diplomatic Corps Throughout my time in Congress and at the CIA, I've met hundreds of State Department leaders and officers, and I've met even more over the past month. In a recent series of Department briefings with team members at State, they all, to a person, expressed a hope to be empowered in their roles, and to have a clear understanding of the President's mission. That will be my first priority. They also shared how demoralizing it is to have so many vacancies and, frankly, not to feel relevant. I'll do my part to end the vacancies, but I'll need your help. And I will work every day to provide dedicated leadership and convey my faith in their work--just as I have done with my workforce at the CIA. When I took over as Director, the CIA had just completed a massive restructuring that caused considerable turbulence--as these things do. Immediately after my arrival, I began speaking in every meeting and every conversation about the Agency's mission, providing the team with the ``Commander's Intent.'' I worked relentlessly to break down unnecessary layers of approval, reached out to the career professionals, did a lot of listening, and encouraged our officers to be creative and take risk when required. Further, I encouraged our officers to make independent decisions. If I couldn't add value, I wanted them to execute and be accountable. And understanding that any organization will experience failure when reaching for great things, I promised to have their backs. And I did. No one will ever take calculated, lawful risks to reach greatness if they feel it could end their career. And, when our team needed extra resources, I never hesitated to ask the President--and so long as he found value in the task, he never hesitated to provide them. I will, with your help, do the same at the Department of State. You have my commitment, too, that I will work with each of you, the White House, and the entire Senate to fill the senior vacancies. This is critical to strengthening the finest diplomatic corps in the world. America and the world need us to be that. Strengthen Workforce Culture and Communication The second action item I'd like to highlight is strengthening workforce culture and communication. I learned many years ago from a crusty Sergeant First Class that good leaders need to shut up and listen. A lot. Just as I've done in each of my previous leadership roles, I will rely on those around me to achieve the team's goals. And we will listen to our foreign partners as well. At the CIA, I launched regularly-scheduled, small group town halls, not very originally titled, ``Meet with Mike.'' The first 75 or so officers to sign up had the chance to spend an hour with me listening to them. I not only enjoyed these sessions, but I learned a great deal. Further, I almost never travelled abroad without meeting with my local team on the ground. They were crucial to my understanding of the nuance of each country and its people. I also wanted the chance to ask them if they had everything they needed. It matters deeply to me that our staff and their families are safe and thriving. When traveling on behalf of the Agency, it was always important to me to be able to assess security and medical resources, housing, schools, and other support for our families. Not long ago, I was traveling on an overseas trip when it became apparent there were serious housing safety issues for Agency and State Department families at one post. While I was only on the ground a short time, I was able to talk with the Ambassador to lodge my concerns and ask that action be taken. I do not want to send any family where I would not send my own, nor will I send an officer where I would not go. The State Department's workforce must, by necessity, be diverse in every sense of the word--in terms of race, religion, background, and more. I'll work to achieve that diversity, just as I have successfully done at CIA, by focusing on mission and demanding that every team member be treated equally and with dignity and respect. But there is one more ingredient critical to our success--and that is listening to and working alongside each of you and your staffs. I have used, at CIA, the model former Director Panetta suggested to me: fewer hearings, more cups of coffee; shorter conversations, more frequently. I found it most useful with your colleagues on SSCI and hope that you, too, will find it valuable. All of this--listening, leveraging differences, unleashing talent, teamwork--will become the fabric of a State Department culture that finds its swagger once again. We will be effective, expeditionary, diverse, and successful in fulfilling our mission. Serving the Commander in Chief So far I've talked about how I would empower the Department of State to succeed in its work. Now let me talk a little about the work itself. By definition, the job description of the Secretary of State is to ``serve as the President's chief foreign affairs adviser.'' This definition was driven home to me in recent conversations with former Secretaries of State. I asked each of them how they had defined the core responsibilities of the job. They were remarkably consistent in their answers: job number one is to represent the President. For me, this means building substantial relationships with our allies--relationships that President Trump and I can utilize for both tough conversations and productive cooperation. It also means working with our adversaries to make clear America's objectives and the means by which we intend to achieve them. In this regard, I'm fortunate to have a sizeable head start. On as many as a third of my days at the Agency, I'm engaged with foreign counterparts. I have led the CIA to forge stronger relationships with our closest partners in the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Asia. I've travelled to these regions to demonstrate our commitment to working alongside them. I've also met with leaders in countries with which we share very few common objectives. I've asked my team to find those narrow slivers of common ground to stand on, so that we can deliver results for America. I would do the same at the State Department. We must do so not simply to be collegial, but to find partners who will help us achieve our objectives. I deeply believe this. Representing America also requires promoting America's ideals, values, and priorities to those who ultimately determine the trajectory of geopolitics: the voters and citizens of the world. To succeed in our diplomacy, it is important to appeal directly to key populations, and not to forfeit the perception of our country to misleading state media or other faulty information channels. Whether speaking to foreign leaders or the foreign public, it is important for the Secretary of State to clearly communicate the President's directives and goals. Every former Secretary I spoke with stressed the importance of maintaining a close relationship with the President. I've worked to build that kind of relationship with President Trump over the past 15 months through hundreds of hours of intelligence briefings. My relationship with President Trump is due to one thing: we've demonstrated value to him at the CIA. So, in turn, he has come to rely on us. I intend to ensure that the Department of State will be just as central to the President's policies and the national security of the United States. We need to be nimble, smart, and relevant to the difficult issues the President confronts every day--always delivering value. I cannot deliver effective diplomacy worldwide on my own. I will need the men and women of our diplomatic corps exercising their skills to deliver this value to our country. One of the many values of robust diplomacy is that it increases our chances of solving problems peacefully, without ever firing a shot. I saw this as a young cavalry officer in the United States Army, where I led troops patrolling the Berlin Wall from 1986 to 1989. The remarkable work of Foreign Service officers, over many years, no doubt saved my soldiers and me from military confrontation with the Soviet Union--a war for which we were preparing, and a conflict that the world thankfully avoided. I know firsthand the painful sacrifices of our men and women in uniform. So when journalists, most of whom have never met me, label me--or any of you--as ``hawks,'' ``war hardliners,'' or worse, I shake my head. There are few who dread war more than those of us who have served in uniform. And there is a great deal of room between a military presence and war. War is always the last resort. I would prefer achieving the President's foreign policy goals with unrelenting diplomacy rather than by sending young men and women to war. I am serving a President who feels the same way. While the military balance of power can set the stage and create leverage, the best outcomes are won through negotiations and the gains they can achieve. Diplomacy is for the Brave and the Bold: Global Challenges and Opportunities At this time I'd like to talk about the substantive challenges facing the State Department around the world. These challenges are well known to this committee, but I'll briefly share my views on a few of the most critical. First, diplomatic efforts are underway to rid the world of a nuclear North Korea. There is no higher diplomatic task for the State Department team than solving this decades-in-the-making threat to our nation. The stakes are high for everyone, but I believe them to be the highest for the North Korean regime. The State Department has successfully rallied the world to cut ties and impose sanctions that have had a profound impact. But there is much diplomatic work left to do, including supporting the President's intent to meet with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. That meeting will take place against a backdrop of commitment by our President to achieve denuclearization and prevent America from being held at risk by a North Korean arsenal of nuclear weapons. I have read the CIA histories of previous negotiations with the North Koreans, and am confident that we will not repeat the mistakes of the past. President Trump isn't one to play games at the negotiating table--and I won't be either. Next, Russia continues to act aggressively, enabled by years of soft policy toward that aggression. That's now over. The list of this administration's actions to raise the cost for Vladimir Putin is long. We are rebuilding our already strong military and recapitalizing our nuclear deterrent. We have imposed tough sanctions and expelled more Russian diplomats and intelligence officers from the U.S. than at any time since the Cold War. We are arming brave young men and women resisting Russian expansionism in Ukraine and Georgia. This list is much longer, and I'm confident I'll have the opportunity to add to it today. But the actions of this administration make clear that President Trump's national security strategy, rightfully, has identified Russia as a danger to our country. Our diplomatic efforts with Russia will prove challenging, but as in previous confrontations with Moscow, must continue. Iran, meanwhile, has been on the march and has paid too low a price for its dangerous behavior. Our administration has developed a strategy to counter Iran that will raise that cost. The issues surrounding Iran's proliferation threat are real and we, along with our allies, must deal with the long-term risk that its capability presents. But we cannot let the nuclear file prevent us from acting against Iran's cyber efforts or its attempts to provide missiles to the Houthis to attack Saudi Arabia and Americans who travel there. Iran's activities in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon threaten the very existence of Israel, and the global reach of Hezbollah threatens us right here in the homeland. Iran freed American hostages for the sake of a deal and then turned immediately to holding still more. I will work for their freedom every day. President Trump is prepared to work with our partners to revise the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to fix its most egregious flaws. If confirmed, it will be an immediate personal priority to work with those partners to see if such a fix is achievable. The stakes are high for everyone, but especially Tehran. If confirmed in time, I look forward to engaging key Allies on this crucial and time-sensitive topic at the G7 Ministerial Meeting on April 22nd and the NATO Ministerial Meeting later that week. Even while America has reestablished a position of strength in our diplomatic relationship, China continues its concerted and coordinated effort to compete with the United States in diplomatic, military, and economic terms. For years, through IP theft and coercive technology transfer, China has exploited weak U.S. trade policy and leeched wealth and secrets from our economy. Militarily, it continues its provocation in the South and East China Seas, in cyberspace, and even in outer space. This administration is determined to work diplomatically with the Chinese government in an effort to develop a more productive bilateral partnership. We have been pleased with China's support of our efforts to apply pressure on the North Korean regime, but it must do more. The State Department must be at the center of formulating and executing our China policy. Those are just a few of our challenges. The failed state of Syria poses a mounting threat to human rights, national security, and regional stability--and it deserves an increasingly severe response. Similarly, our nation faces unique and pressing security, governance, and development challenges in Iraq, Afghanistan, Latin America and Africa, where our diplomacy must support people's efforts to improve their lives. The State Department must also be at the forefront of America's efforts to ease humanitarian crises in Burma, Yemen, Venezuela, parts of Africa, and elsewhere. Couched in all of our global challenges are opportunities-- opportunities to promote security, stability, and human rights in key regions. I also believe we have opportunities for increasingly robust and fair trading relationships that benefit the American people. Should I be confirmed as Secretary of State, I will execute diligent and firm diplomacy, working alongside the world's finest diplomatic service, to help our President confront the challenges and seize the opportunities of our time. Bound by Duty Before I take your questions, I want to speak for a moment about duty to country--which is something I feel today in great measure. I know all of you feel the heavy weight of it in your positions, as does President Trump. The desire we all feel to fulfill our duty to the best of our ability often manifests itself in a fierce competition of ideas, including on the subject of foreign policy. America's engagement with the world has always, rightfully, been a topic of debate. I'm sure we'll engage in a healthy amount of that in just a moment. Yet, all throughout my life, I've been reminded that once the debates conclude, the carrying out of our foreign policy--the actions that make it real-- must be a matter of duty. It's a reminder that while our country might disagree on the ``what'' and the ``how'' of our global involvement, it rarely disagrees on the ``why''--which is to defend the safety of our families, the prosperity of our nation, and the survival of freedom in our world. Diplomacy gives us the chance to achieve these goals peacefully. I believe our Commander in Chief has made historic strides already in pursuit of this mission. If I have the honor of serving him as Secretary of State, I pledge to work with each of you, to strengthen our State Department, to champion the patriots who serve there, and to deliver on our shared diplomatic objectives--on behalf of every American. I look forward to your questions. The Chairman. Thank you for the testimony. I am going to withhold my time and use it for interjections along the way. And with that, I will turn to our distinguished ranking member, Senator Menendez. Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director, thank you for your testimony. Director, the Washington Post reported last year that, on March 22nd of 2017, you and Director of National Intelligence Coats attended a briefing at the White House with officials from several government agencies. The article says, ``As the briefing was wrapping up, Trump asked everyone to leave the room except for Coats and CIA Director Pompeo. The President then started complaining about the FBI investigation and Comey's handling of it, said officials familiar with the account Coats gave to associates. Two days earlier, Comey had confirmed in a congressional hearing that the bureau was probing whether Trump's campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 race. After the encounter, Coats discussed the conversation with other officials and decided that intervening with Comey as Trump had suggested would be inappropriate, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters.'' That is the end of the quote. So, Director, this account strongly suggests that the President asked you and Director Coats to interfere with then- FBI Director Comey's investigations into the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. What did President Trump say to you and Director Coats in that meeting? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, I am not going to talk about the conversations the President and I had. I think--I think it is, in this setting, appropriate for a President to have an opportunity to talk with his senior leaders. I will do that throughout the day. But I will tell you this, the article's suggestion that he asked me to do anything that was improper is false. Senator Menendez. Did he ask you to do anything as it relates to that investigation? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, I don't recall. I don't recall what he asked me that day precisely. But I have to tell you, I am with the President an awful lot. He has never asked me to do anything that I considered remotely improper. Senator Menendez. So when you say you are not going to talk about that conversation, you are not asserting executive privilege, are you? Mr. Pompeo. No, Senator. I believe, and I think you will agree, we will talk about foreign policy issues. We will talk about---- Senator Menendez. This has a connotation of foreign policy, because this is about Russia. And so at the end of the day, understanding how you responded, what you will do as we are looking at mandatory sanctions that the administration has yet to impose, looking at how we are going to deal with a Russia that not only sought to affect our last elections but is doing so even as we speak both here at home and across the world, those are substantive questions. Mr. Pompeo. Yes, Senator. Senator Menendez. So it is not for me just simply a question of interest. It is a question of understanding what you were asked, how you responded, and what you did. Mr. Pompeo. Senator, you talked about the important policy issues. I am happy to talk about this administration's work on Russia. I am happy to talk about our work on sanctions, if that is what you--if that was your question---- Senator Menendez. Let me ask you this. Did President Trump ever discuss the FBI or Special Counsel's Russia investigation with you? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, again, I am not going to talk about private conversations I have had with the President. Senator Menendez. So whenever you come, if you were to be confirmed, in the future, and we want to try to talk about foreign policy, and we ask you where is the President at or this or that, you are not going to disclose any of the conversations? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, I am happy--Senator, I am happy to answer questions about our administration's policies, the work that we are doing. You are asking about conversations. You should know, Senator, as well, I have provided--I spoke with Special Counsel Mueller, who interviewed me, requested an interview. I cooperated. Your colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee have asked for information from me and from the Central Intelligence Agency, as has the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. I think the leaders of those two organizations in a bipartisan way would say I have been cooperative. And in matters---- Senator Menendez. So you have spoken to Special Counsel Mueller? Mr. Pompeo. Yes, that is correct. Senator Menendez. And what was the subject of the conversation? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, I am not going to speak to that. Senator Menendez. Did the Special Counsel tell you not to speak about these things? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, I have cooperated with multiple investigations. While the investigation continues, I think that is the appropriate way to approach it. And you should know, and no one here today should take away any--because of the fact that I don't want to speak out, there should be no negative inferences with respect to anything or, for that matter, positive inferences about the fact that I think it is most appropriate that, while these investigations continue, I not speak to the conversations I have had with the various investigative bodies. Senator Menendez. I am sure that if I asked Director Mueller--I mean, Special Counsel Mueller a simple question, whether you were told you couldn't, I don't think he would say you couldn't. So it is your choice that you are not seeking to do so. And for me, these questions being answered truthfully in a forthcoming way are critically important, because it goes to the very essence of how you approach one of the most critical issues that we have. And your unwillingness to speak to it is troubling to me. Let me ask you this. President Trump has repeatedly said that ``getting along with Russia is a good thing.'' Yesterday, he tweeted, ``Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been.... There is no reason for this.'' And he indicated he would like to help Russia with its economy. What behavior, if any, has the Kremlin shown that indicates it wants to get along with the United States or our allies? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, this administration has taken a series of actions to push back against Vladimir Putin. Senator Menendez. That is not my question. Let's start with my question. Mr. Pompeo. But, Senator---- Senator Menendez. My question is, what behavior has the Kremlin shown that it indicates it wants to get along with the United States? Is there any? If so, please share it with me. Mr. Pompeo. Senator, I take a backseat to no one with my views of the threat that is presented to America from Russia. And if I am confirmed as the Secretary of State, I can assure you this administration will continue as it has for the past 15 months to take real actions to push pack, to reset the deterrence relationship with respect to Russia. Senator Menendez. Let's talk about that, because I see that is in your written statement, and you suggest that there is a robust response to Russia. On February 27th, Admiral Mike Rogers, the head of the National Security Administration and U.S. Cyber Command, warned the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Trump administration has not done enough to stop the Russians. ``I believe that President Putin has clearly come to the conclusion that there is little price to pay here and that, therefore, he can continue his activity.'' On April 3rd, the outgoing National Security Advisor, General H.R. McMaster, said, and I quote, ``We have failed to impose sufficient costs on Russia,'' and that the Kremlin's confidence is growing. And then, for your reference, here is a series of mandatory provisions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, part of which I helped write, which have not been implemented by the administration: Section 225, mandatory sanctions related to special Russian crude oil products; Section 226, mandatory sanctions with respect to Russia and other foreign financial institutions; Section 228, mandatory sanctions with respect to certain transactions with foreign sanctions evaders and serious human rights abusers in the Russian Federation; Section 231, mandatory sanctions with respect to persons engaging in transactions with the intelligence and defense sectors of the Government of the Russian Federation. There are more. That is not a robust response to Russia. The Chairman. Thank you. Before I turn to Senator Risch, I want to welcome Senator King. I would like for the people of Maine to know he does this often. [Laughter.] The Chairman. When things are serious, he comes and actually listens to the testimony. We thank you for doing so. Senator Risch. Senator Risch. Thank you very much. Mike, thank you for your service at intel, at the CIA. That has been great. For those of you on the committee, Senator Rubio and I are the only two that have the crosspollination, I guess. We have the great privilege of serving on the Intel Committee. And we hear from the heads of all of the 17 agencies that we have that engage in intelligence matters. And over the years, over the 10 years I have been on it, we have had numerous heads of agencies come in, and sometimes, frankly, we feel we are getting stiff-armed. I can tell all of you on this committee that Mike Pompeo has been candid when he came in before the Intel Committee. He has been helpful. And he has always been straightforward with us. So thank you for your service there. You have earned my respect, in that regard. And you will certainly get my vote for confirmation on this job. I think that that service as head of the CIA is going to serve you very well, as you know. It served me very well on this committee, having some of that in-depth knowledge that you don't necessarily get in the public media. Being Secretary of State is unique, I think, as far as the agency heads are concerned. You, first of all, have the public duties, and it has been referenced here. It is a very high- profile job, in that you go around the world being the face of America and doing the kinds of things that you do. And your predecessor was very good at that. I thought he carried the flag as well as anyone could carry it. This job, however, as Secretary of State, has a couple other facets to it that you have to do at the same time, and it is hard to keep all the balls in the air. One of them, of course, is being part of the management team with the President, as far as managing, really, the United States. And, thirdly, and I think very importantly, is the actual management of the bureaucracy. And I don't use ``bureaucracy'' here in a pejorative way. The thousands of men and women who are in Foreign Service who are working with the State Department make us proud every day. They are bipartisan. They do a great job. I think that there has been a fair amount of criticism, everyone knows, that your predecessor did have, was hampered a bit because he did not have some of those jobs filled that are so important there. And we all know that, in order to manage an agency like that, you have to have really good, solid people around you to be able to make the bureaucracy work in the things that aren't the high-profile meetings and what have you around the world. Could you give us your thoughts, give all of us your thoughts on how you are going to go about that, because it needs some work. There is no question about it. And it is going to make your job better. It is going to make the State Department work better. So could you give us your thoughts on that? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, first, thank you for your kind words. I did, as a CIA Director, I have consistently tried to work closely with you and provide you everything that you have asked for in a timely fashion. I think we have succeeded often, if not always. And we have worked diligently at that. I promise to do that with this committee as well. With respect to building a team out of the State Department, this is something I have done multiple times in my life. I did it as a tank platoon leader. I did it as a cavalry troop. I did it for two small businesses in Kansas. And then I worked hard at it at CIA. I will it leave to others to judge the success. But I did it because I knew it was an imperative. At the State Department, there are too many holes, too many vacancies, too many unfilled positions. When that happens, everyone is stretched thin in the subject matter expertise that is needed to deliver America's diplomacy around the world, to conduct its mission, its humanitarian missions, its development missions. Each of the missions which are entrusted to the State Department require talented people on station doing their part, working alongside it. The way I will think about it is the same way I did at the CIA. I will start with those things that I think are the biggest gaps and present the biggest risk to America's capacity to execute its diplomacy. We don't yet have an Ambassador to South Korea. We need one. There are a handful of other places that have a requirement for immediate attention. With respect to each of those positions, I am a talent hawk. I will find what I believe to be the best fit to execute America's diplomatic mission around the world. And I will encourage, demand, cajole them to come join the team and be part of our organization in a way that can successfully deliver. Some of them will be fantastic civil servants and Foreign Service Officers, others from the outside. But in each case, I will try to identify the right person to occupy the position at this challenging time in America's history. Senator Risch. Thank you very much. You made reference to the fact that there are ambassadorships that are empty. I think there are 37 of them. And the good news is that you have a really deep bench at the State Department. And a good example is in South Korea. I had the good fortune of being there, as you know, recently, doing some things. And the charge d'affaires who is in charge there has done a fabulous job, as you know. And we do have that deep bench at the State Department. But, again, we do need the ambassadorships filled, and we do need, particularly, I think, the top positions in the department filled, and people with the authority to act and people with the authority to do the things that need to be done. So thank you for that. I have every confidence you will be able to do that. Your candor with the Intelligence Committee, I can tell you that, if you can come in front of that committee and disgorge in a candid fashion, I have every confidence you are going to be able to do that here. So thank you again for your service. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Cardin. Senator Cardin. Mr. Pompeo, first of all, thank you for your career of public service. I want to thank your family, because this clearly is going to be a family sacrifice. It already has been. But it will be even more deeply felt by your family. So I very much appreciate all that. Mr. Pompeo. Thank you, Senator Cardin. Senator Cardin. I want to follow up on the chairman's opening comments about the need for the Secretary of State to be a strong, independent voice in the White House, particularly in this White House, and with the President's announced policy of America first, which has been interpreted globally as America alone, which is your mission, if you are confirmed, to use diplomacy to engage the international community. So I want to ask you a couple questions, and I would ask that you give your views, not the President's. I want to know your views. Secondly, I would hope that you would briefly answer the questions, because I have a lot of questions I want answered. Please respect the time restrictions that we are operating under. And let me start first, if I might, with the Iran nuclear agreement that has been referred to. There is no question that Iran is a bad actor here, and they continue to be a bad actor. And this Congress, with your help, we passed very strong legislation to provide additional sanctions against Iran for its nonnuclear violations, including its ballistic missiles. And we want strict enforcement of the nuclear agreement. But it is clear from what the President has announced that he wants to see changes in the nuclear agreement. It has also been very clear that Europe has said pretty directly we cannot unilaterally, the West, modify the agreement, and that Iran is in compliance with the agreement. General Dunford has said, unless there is a material breach, we have an impact in others' willingness to sign other agreements if we pull out of this agreement, with reference to North Korea, the challenges of entering into diplomacy. So my direct question, if the President determines that you cannot modify this agreement, and Iran is in compliance, what is your view as to whether America should withdraw unilaterally from the Iran nuclear agreement? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, I know clearly what my mission is going to be. The President has made very clear what the Secretary of State's mission has been, and I expect no change to that. Senator Cardin. I didn't ask--I asked, what are your views? I understand that. We have had nominees come before this committee and express their views---- Mr. Pompeo. Yes. Senator Cardin.--and are doing very well in this administration, and who have disagreed with the President, and the President gets the last word. I understand that. Mr. Pompeo. I have done it many times. Senator Cardin. I want to know your views. Mr. Pompeo. I have done it many times, Senator. I cannot answer that question. Here is why. But let me tell you how I approach it. Let me tell you how I you how I think about it. Here is how---- Senator Cardin. I---- Mr. Pompeo [continuing]. If you will, if you will let me tell you how I think about it, then you can--I want to fix this deal. That is the objective. I think that is in the best interest of the United States. Senator Cardin [continuing]. But if the agreement cannot be changed--my question is pretty simple. We are running very close to a deadline on certification. What is your view? Is it better to pull out of an agreement that Iran is in compliance with if we can't fix it? Or is it better to stay in the agreement as the---- Mr. Pompeo [continuing]. Senator---- Senator Cardin [continuing]. Yes or no? Mr. Pompeo [continuing]. Senator, it is not a yes or no question, because it is a hypothetical. We are not at that point. Let me tell---- Senator Cardin. The President has to certify on May the 12th. Mr. Pompeo [continuing]. Yes, sir. That is yet almost a month away. It depends, clearly, if we are close--imagine, just as a hypothetical matter, imagine we are close to achieving the fix that the President has asked the State Department to achieve. If we are close, if there is some opportunity---- Senator Cardin. Do you pull out, if you are close? Mr. Pompeo [continuing]. In the event--in the event that we conclude that we can't fix this deal, that these serious shortcomings that you, Senator Cardin, yourself, have identified, then the President is going to be given best advice, including by me. And if there is no chance that we can fix it, I will recommend to the President that we do our level best to work with our allies to achieve a better outcome and a better deal. Senator Cardin. By---- Mr. Pompeo. Even after May 12th, Senator, even after May 12th, there is still much diplomatic work to be done. Senator Cardin [continuing]. I think you have answered the question. You have been---- Mr. Pompeo. Senator, just to be clear, it is more than just Europe. Senator Cardin. You have been pretty clear about the outcome you would like to see in North Korea, which I believe-- if I am misstating this, please, let me know--which is regime change. Is that accurate? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, you have misstated that. Senator Cardin. Okay. Are you in favor of regime change in North Korea? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, my mission is--and I have articulated my own personal views on this. We have a responsibility to achieve a condition where Kim Jong-un is unable to threaten the United States of America with nuclear weapons. Senator Cardin. I understand that. So are you saying now you don't favor regime change? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, I have never advocated for regime change. I have all along---- Senator Cardin. It is a simple question. So you are not-- you do not believe---- Mr. Pompeo [continuing]. I am happy to answer today that I am not advocating for regime change. Yes, Senator. Senator Cardin [continuing]. Thank you. I appreciate that. I want to get that clear. Let me go on to---- Mr. Pompeo. And, Senator, just to be clear, my role as a diplomat is to make sure that we never get to a place where we have to confront the difficult situation in Korea that this country has been headed for now for a couple of decades. Senator Cardin [continuing]. So let me get to the international climate talks and agreements that were entered into in Paris, the fact that every Nation in the world has now joined in that, this is, as I explained to you as we talked in our office, as you understand, these are self-imposed goals enforced only by ourselves. The President has indicated his intentions to withdraw from the international agreement. It takes a period of time before it becomes effective. Mr. Pompeo. Yes, sir. Senator Cardin. But he has already initiated the process. If it, in fact, takes place, we would be the only country that is not part of the agreement. Do you support the United States withdrawing from the climate agreements? Mr. Pompeo. I share the President's position precisely, which is that the Paris Agreement put an undue burden on the United States of America and that we should work to find a place where that is not the case. And when that moment arrives, we will be part of that discussion and reenter that agreement. Senator Cardin. So you stand by your---- Mr. Pompeo. That is both my view, and I believe I am speaking for the administration's view. Senator Cardin [continuing]. So you believe self-imposed requirements working with the international community, I think I am quoting you accurately, is dangerously wrong, bows down to radical environmentalists, and the science is inconclusive. You stand by those statements today? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, we need to work to arrange a situation that treats American citizens in the same way that others around the world---- Senator Cardin. And do you---- Mr. Pompeo [continuing]. --So there is a shared burden to attack this challenge. Senator Cardin [continuing]. Do you see the challenge, that that is going to make your job, if confirmed, more challenging? Your job is to work with the international community, our friends and foes alike---- Mr. Pompeo. Yes. Senator Cardin [continuing]. To try to get diplomacy to work. And yet, the United States would be the only country saying we do not want to talk to you about climate under the arrangements that every other country is dealing with. You don't see a conflict with that position and trying to be the top diplomat of America, the leader of the world? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, there are many times that we work with our allies, and there are many other times when we just don't see it the same way. I give you many indications, many examples of where this administration has worked with those same allies. Just recently, the work that we did against Russia in response to the attack that took place in Britain, we worked with our European allies. We did so very closely. This would be after the President's announcement that he intended to withdraw from Paris. So it can still work. I will give you another example. The coalition that this administration has built to put pressure on Kim Jong-un is unique and historic and important. So there will be places that our allies come alongside us, and others that they don't. And my task as the chief diplomat will be to get America's position well-known and to rally the world to the causes that benefit America. I look forward to doing that, if I am confirmed, as well, Senator. Senator Cardin. Thank you. The Chairman. Before I turn to Senator Rubio, I am going to use 30 seconds of my time. Just on the Iran issue, it is my sense in personal conversation with the President that if the Europeans do not come along with a framework agreement by May 12th, it is likely that he will withdraw. Mr. Pompeo. Senator, the President has made that very clear. The Chairman. And so I do not think Senator Cardin fully--I don't think he heard the same thing I heard. And your sense is that, should that happen, then you would continue after that time to try to create a better agreement. Is that what your answer was? Mr. Pompeo. Yes. Senator, the President has stated his objective. I have heard him say it to my predecessor or, excuse me, to Secretary Tillerson. I have heard him say that his goal is to take the three shortcomings that he identified and fix them. Senator Cardin. Mr. Chairman, I need to correct the record. I understand the President's position. I was asking the nominee's position. I wasn't asking the President's position. I want to know your view on it, not the President's. I understand the President's view. The Chairman. But I think--again, I know this is going to be highly discussed publicly. I think what Director Pompeo is saying is that is also his opinion, and that should the agreement then be negated, he would work for a better agreement after that, should the framework agreement not come in place by May 12th. Is that correct? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, that is correct. The Chairman. Senator Rubio. Senator Rubio. Thank you. First, just an editorial statement at the front end. One of the reasons why I have been--apart from how well I know the nominee and the work he has done in intelligence, is I think one of the critical components to be a successful Secretary of State is that, when the Secretary of State comes to town, leaders and diplomats need to know that this is someone who is in the inner circle of the President, that has the President's trust and speaks for the administration. And I can just tell you from experience from the work that we have done with Director Pompeo that, if confirmed, when he comes to town, leaders around the world will know that someone who has not just access to the President but is part of the President's trusted inner circle and speaks for the President and for his policies--is just critical for the success of the Secretary of State. And I would imagine, if you have spoken as you have to all the living Secretary of States, they would have told you that that component of that relationship is so important. And I would just say anything that would undermine that, obviously, is something that would undermine the ability to do the job in that way. I have a series of quick questions, and they are important, because it gives people some context about your views on foreign policy and America's role in the world, which, by the way, predate your time at the Central Intelligence Agency and includes your time in the House of Representatives and perhaps even before that. You still agree, do you not, on the matter of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, that the United States has an obligation to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty? Mr. Pompeo. Yes, Senator. Senator Rubio. And you still agree that, far from being a great public service, WikiLeaks is more of like a nonstate actor hostile to the national interests and security of the United States? Mr. Pompeo. Senator Rubio, I do believe that. Senator Rubio. And I think you still agree that Vladimir Putin's government actively interfered in our presidential elections and elections at large in 2016, and they did so because it is part of a longstanding theory or belief that, through disinformation and propaganda, they could win ``bloodless wars'' against democracies in the West, including the United States? Mr. Pompeo. Yes, Senator. That is correct. Senator Rubio. Of the five main threats facing the United States--China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and radical jihadists--they all have one common thread: authoritarianism. Would you agree that, today, the major faultline in global affairs repeatedly is the competition, really a global competition between autocratic systems of governance and the democratic system, that that, in many ways, has played out over and over again in the foreign affairs of this country and in global issues? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, it is with striking consistency the case that the countries that share our vision of the world and share our democratic values are not authoritarian, and those that don't are not. Senator Rubio. And so, in that vein, you would again agree that promoting democracy isn't just a nice thing to do or a good thing to do, or promoting democracy is not us butting into other people's business or invading their sovereignty. So it is more than just a moral imperative. Promoting democracy is, in the context of that competition as we have just discussed, promoting democracy is in the vital national interests of the United States. Mr. Pompeo. Yes, indeed, Senator. And our effectiveness at doing that is an important tool of American foreign policy. Senator Rubio. And there is this ridiculous argument out there when people talk about Russian interference and their efforts and so forth that that is no different than what America does when it moments democracy. There are huge differences, are there not? For example, when they interfere in an election, they are trying to influence the outcome. When we promote democracy, we are trying to improve the process, not necessarily who they elect. Sometimes democracies elect leaders that are not as friendly towards the United States. When they interfere in elections, they use government and their intelligence agencies and the like. When we promote democracy, it is largely through the work of nongovernmental organizations, who may receive assistance from our government. When they undermine democracy, they do it in secret. They hide it, and they deny it. We do it openly. We brag about it. We are talking about it here today. And when we promote democracy, we do it at the invitation of someone in those countries, whether it is a political party, an organization, oftentimes the government itself. When they undermine democracy, they do so against the will of the people of that Nation and of the governments in place. There is no equivalence between the promotion of democracy and Russian and other attempts to interfere in democracy. Mr. Pompeo. Senator, there is neither an operational equivalence, as you have described it, that is, the methodologies used are very different, nor is there a moral equivalence between the two efforts. They are fundamentally different in every way, and America's democracy promotion around the world is conducted in way that America should be incredibly proud of. Senator Rubio. And one of the first things autocratic rulers do, almost by definition, is they violate the human rights of their people and, of course, have no problem violating the human rights of others, as we have recently seen through war crimes and atrocities repeatedly committed by an autocratic government in Syria with the support of autocratic governments in Iran and Russia. Therefore, I believe you would agree that defending human rights isn't just a good thing to do or just the right moral thing to do, which it most certainly is. Defending human rights is also in the national interest of the United States of America? Mr. Pompeo. I do believe that, Senator. Senator Rubio. And it would be a priority at the State Department. Mr. Pompeo. It would. And not only do I believe it, I think history would reflect that to be the case. Senator Rubio. Now, after the end of the Cold War, we had this belief that history had ended, and everyone was going to be a democracy, and everybody was going to embrace capitalism, as we understand it, with free economics and the like. That hasn't really worked out in the case of a lot of places, particularly China. They have most certainly not embraced democracy. They have actually gotten more autocratic. And they have embraced a definition of the world economic order that basically means we will take all the benefits of global trade and global economics, but we do not intend to live by any of its obligations. And so I personally believe that it was a terrible mistake that leaders in both parties have made. And now, as part of their strategy, you see China doing things like trying to create strategic depth in Eurasia, their efforts to establish all these different programs, the Belt and Road Initiative, Silk Road and Maritime Silk Road. They are not just efforts to create new overland trade corridors. They are efforts to, basically, make these nations economically, politically, and, eventually, militarily dependent on and vulnerable to China. And their maritime borders in the South and East China Sea, you see that they feel vulnerable and insecure. They see American allies in Japan, South Korea, Australia, Taiwan. And so what they are working on now is fracturing our economic and defense alliances in the Indo-Pacific region. That is why they are investing billions of dollars in building up their navy and their air force to be able to establish air and sea denial to the U.S. military and, ultimately, make the argument: Don't count on America's defense and/or partnership, because it is just paper. They can't live up to it anymore. What are your recommendations for the President, as far as how important that challenge is? Otherwise, we are going to wake up one day and find out we have been driven from the Asia- Pacific region. Mr. Pompeo. Senator, as the CIA Director, I have often been asked, what is the greatest threat to the United States? It is always hard to prioritize and rank. We have a handful. We have lots of opportunities as well. China certainly presents a strategic challenge to the United States of America. You laid out the various tools and mechanisms that they are using, mostly economic. The United States needs to be prepared to respond across each of those fronts, so that we can find the right ground, the right place, where we can cooperate with the Chinese where it makes sense for America. And in those places where it does not, we can confront them and make sure that it is America's vision, a democratic vision, that continues to provide strength and resources for the world. The Chairman. Senator Shaheen. Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Pompeo, thank you for being willing to consider taking on this responsibility at such a challenging time for the United States and the world. This morning, President Trump tweeted out that much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the fake and corrupt Russia investigation. Do you agree with that? Mr. Pompeo. The historic conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, and now Russia, is caused by Russian bad behavior. Senator Shaheen. Thank you. When you were installed as Director at the CIA, as you said in your testimony, you swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. As you pointed out, you have taken that oath six times. You have graduated from Harvard Law School magna cum laude. You are an attorney. Do you think Special Counsel Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt? Mr. Pompeo. Ma'am, I am going to not speak about any of the three investigations that I have been a participant in today. Senator Shaheen. Do you think the President has the authority, recognizing your legal background, does the President have the authority to fire Special Counsel Mueller on his own? Mr. Pompeo. Senator, I am in no position to make a comment on that legal question. Senator Shaheen. Would you consider the President firing Rod Rosenstein over his role in the Special Counsel investigation to be an abuse of power? Mr. Pompeo. Ma'am, I came here today to talk about my qualifications to be the Secretary of State. I am not going to weigh into the active investigations that are going on in the House, the Senate, and the Special Counsel's investigation. Senator Shaheen. And I appreciate that. That is what we are all here to talk about. But the fact is, in your testimony, you talk about the actions of the administration making clear and rightfully identifying Russia as a danger to our country. And yet, the President tweets out his opinion that the problem with Russia is Bob Mueller and the investigation. I think those two are in conflict. And it is hard for me to understand how we can have a Secretary of State who is able to go to Russia and come to Congress and talk about the challenges and the threats that Russia faces to our democracy when we have this conflicting position from the President of the United States who you would work for. And let me just say, you have talked about the actions that have been taken by this administration, but the fact is the sanctions that were passed overwhelmingly in the House and Senate that had bipartisan support have not been fully implemented by this administration. So we have mandatory sanctions related to Russian crude oil products that haven't been implemented. We have sanctions with respect to Russian and other foreign financial institutions not implemented. Sanctions with respect to transactions with foreign sanctions evaders and serious human rights abusers in the Russian Federation not implemented yet. I could go on, but, as the Secretary of State, will you argue that we need to go ahead and implement the rest of these sanctions in a way that holds Russia accountable for its interference? Mr. Pompeo. Yes, ma'am, every day. And if I may take just a moment? Senator Shaheen. Please. Mr. Pompeo. So there is still more work to be done on CAATSA. There is more work to be done on other sanctions provisions as well. I readily concede that. Vladimir Putin has not yet received the message sufficiently, and we need to continue to work at that. But it hasn't just been sanctions. The largest expulsion of 60 folks was from this administration. This administration announced a Nuclear Posture Review that has put Russia on notice that we are going to recapitalize our deterrent force. In Syria now, a handful of weeks ago, the Russians met their match. A couple hundred Russians were killed. The list of actions that the administration has taken, I am happy to walk through each of them, but I don't want to take up more time. Senator Shaheen. I appreciate that. Mr."
