        "text": "The first concert that I went to without my parents. Cabaret Metro in Chicago.\n\nThat's completely cool. They were the first punk band I saw, Tampa FL, on their 'Under the Big Black Sun' tour.\n\nI only saw X once in the Twin Cities. Dave Alvin if The Blasters (and about 187 other bands) was on guitar instead of Billy Zoom.\n\nMy sixth was \"All Shook Up.\"\n\n(Elvis, If you are young enough to still have teeth and hair and your birthknees...)\n\nBJ Thomas, \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head\"\n\nAt least it comes with a visual of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\n\nVideo game tunes. Sega Genesis edition. Sonic the Hedgehog always had gems. And they were usually fantastic.\n\nMade even more impressive with the tech available at the time.\n\nMore video game tunes, this time limited to a composer named Jesper Kyd.\n\nKyd's been in the music game a long time. First game I heard his work in was a Batman game (First video, the music remains in my head nearly 30 years later), then he went on to do the infamous Hitman games (He's fantastic at the atmosphere setting) and the Assassin's Creed games.\n\nWhat a decade it was, back when you bought your music on cassette tapes at the record store...\n\nX reminded me of Dave Alvin, who was on guitar for them when I caught them back in the day. He's still around, along with the even older Texas legend Jimmie Dale Gilmore\n\nI have never played Sonic. Thanks for this!\n\nPhil has kept The Blasters going but they've never been quite as good without his brother Dave in the band, imo...\n\nYou should introduce him to acid jazz or snare and bass."
