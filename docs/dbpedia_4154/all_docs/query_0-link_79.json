        "text": "Serbia and Montenegro participated in the Eurovision Song Contest twice, from 2004. Their debut was a success, as the country finished second with the performance of Željko Joksimović. In 2005, the second performance ended 7th, courtesy of the band No Name from Podgorica, Montenegro. Serbia and Montenegro is one of the few countries that have sent all the songs in one of the official languages.\n\nThey were supposed to take part in the 2006 contest, but pulled out due to the Montenegrin Independence Referendum, but both countries then came back in 2007, with a win for Serbia.\n\nGallery[]\n\nParticipants[]\n\nYear Artist Song Language Place Points Semi Points Former participations as Yugoslavia 2003 Toše Proeski Čija si Serbian Withdrew from competition 2004 Željko Joksimović Lane moje 2 263 1 263 2005 No Name Zauvijek moja Montenegrin 7 137 Top 12 in 2004 2006 Moja ljubavi Withdrew from competition Since 2007, as independent countries, now participates as Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nSerbia and Montenegro withdrew from the 2006 contest. They already entered to the Semi Final by not pulling out early enough. They automatically placed last in the contest they didn't compete in.\n\nSerbia and Montenegro's votes were actually from Serbia alone, as Montenegro did not televise the event.\n\nThe country was subject to a 12-year expulsion by the EBU that was brought out by wars breaking out in former Yugoslavia, which the nation participated in."
