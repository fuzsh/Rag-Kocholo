        "text": "No Man’s Land, is about two soldiers, a Bosnian and a Serb, stranded in No Man’s Land — a trench between enemy lines during the Bosnian war.\n\nThey have no one to trust, no way to escape without getting shot, and a fellow soldier is lying on the trench floor with a spring-loaded bomb set to explode beneath him if he moves. The absurdity of their situation would be comical if it didn’t have such dire consequences.\n\nNo Man’s Land won Best Foreign Film at the 2001 Oscars.\n\nWelcome to Sarajevo, based on a true story, is about an offbeat band of TV journalists reporting from the devastated war-torn Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nWhen one UK reporter covers a story about a dilapidated orphanage, he becomes affected by the plight of its occupants. With the help of an American aid worker, he tries to find a way to smuggle the children out of the country.\n\nAnother Bosnian war movie showing the devasting effects on humanity.\n\nThe Whistleblower, is based on the true story of Kathryn Bolkovac, a police officer from Nebraska who accepts an offer to work with the United Nations International Police in post-war Bosnia-Herzegovina under a government-contracted private security UK company.\n\nKathryn uncovers a large-scale sexual slavery ring utilized by international personnel (including Americans). When she brings the scandal to the attention of the UN, Kathryn discovers that it has been covered up to protect lucrative defense and security contracts.\n\nThis Bosnian war movie’s scenes are graphic and heartbreaking, but according to those who lived it, they are reflective of the truth of what was occurring in Bosnia. I am personally a fan of Rachel Weisz as she takes on complex issues with a lot of integrity and this one was a must-see to understand the horrors of this war.\n\nIn the Land of Blood and Honey is Angelina Jolie’s directorial debut about the war in Bosnia in the 1990s and was filmed partly in Bosnia.\n\nIn the wreckage of Sarajevo during the wrath of the Bosnian War, Danijel is a soldier fighting for the Bosnian Serbs. In a prisoner camp led by his strict father, the ruthless Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA) general Nebojša, he finds Ajla, his former love, who is a Bosniak and therefore a prisoner.\n\nThe Bosnian Serb policy against Bosniaks, and the secrecy of their relationship before the war, may endanger the lives of the former lovers.\n\nTito and Me is the last feature film made in the former Yugoslavia before the war decimated the country. Filming began just two days into the war. Despite the bombing, director Goran Marcovic continued filming.\n\nThe movie is set in Socialist ruled Yugoslavia during the 1950s. Zoran is a slightly overweight 10-year-old living in an overcrowded home that his parents share with his grandmother, aunt, and uncle. In the communist era of Yugoslavia, many homes were taken away from their owners in the Land Reform programs. Zoran’s family is opposed to Tito’s rule, while little Zoran sees Tito as his personal hero after learning in school that Tito is the greatest man ever.\n\nVenuto al Mondo, starring Penelope Cruz, is another movie reflecting on the complications of the Bosnian War. Gemma returns to Sarajevo with her only child Pietro sixteen years after escaping the city at the beginning of the Bosnian War. Pietro’s father, Diego, had remained behind and died in the war.\n\nAs they travel with her wartime friend Gojco, Gemma tries to repair her relationship with Pietro as she struggles as to whether to tell Pietro that she did not give birth to him. Gemma is later stunned by the revelation that Pietro’s real mother, Aska, is still alive and married to Gojco.
