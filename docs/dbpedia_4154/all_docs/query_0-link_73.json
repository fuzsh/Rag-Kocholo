        "text": "This page contains a highly selective list of famous Americans of Serbian descent, regardless of their country of origin. Brief biographies, photos, and selected works by and about these individuals elucidate their contributions to American history and culture and also highlight their Serbian heritage.\n\nAlthough there are dozens of potential subjects for this page, we chose to feature only seven very prominent individuals presented below chronologically by year of birth. The most famous Serbian American was indisputably the inventor Nikola Tesla, but he was not the first Serb to emigrate to the United States and make a name for himself in his new country. That honor belongs to George Fisher, the first famous Serbian American featured below.\n\nBesides Tesla, another noted scientist from Serbia was Michael Pupin. In the realm of the arts Serbian Americans have good representation with the Academy-award winning actor Karl Malden and the film director, actor and producer Peter Bogdanovich. We also selected a politician, former Ohio governor and Senator George Voinovich, and rounded out the group with an athlete, the NBA star Pistol Pete Maravich.\n\nTo find further information on these individuals and other prominent men and women not featured on this page, consult the Biographies section of this guide or the section for Reference Books, which includes biographical dictionaries with shorter entries on notable Serbian Americans. You may also conduct a subject browse search (in last name, first name order) in the Library of Congress Online Catalog to find more works on prominent people. Titles below link to fuller bibliographic information in the online catalog. If the titles are available digitally, links are provided.\n\nOther prominent Serbian Americans, among many others, include\n\nMelissa Bean, United States Congresswoman\n\nHelen Delich Bentley, United States Congresswoman\n\nMilorad \"Rod\" Blagojevich, former Governor of the State of Illinois\n\nWalt Bogdanich, Journalist and Pulitzer Prize Winner\n\nLouis Cukela, Army and Navy Congressional Medals of Honor Recipient\n\nVlade Divac, NBA Basketball Player and Olympic Medalist\n\nWilliam Jovanovich, publisher\n\nMilla Jovovich, actor, model and musician\n\nAllex Mandusich, Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient\n\nCatherine Oxenberg, actress and daughter of Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia (Karađorđević dynasty)\n\nMitchell Paige, Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient\n\nLance Sijan, Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient\n\nCharles Simic, 15th Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress and Pulitzer Prize Winner\n\nSteve Tesich, Screen Writer and Oscar Winner\n\nMele \"Mel\" Vojvodich, Legion of Merit Recipient\n\nRose Ann Vuich, California State Senator\n\nApollo 11 American Serbs Team, Pioneers in the United States Space Program.\n\nGeorge Fisher, or by his original Serbian name Đorđe Šagić, was from the town of Székesfehérvár (Stoni Beograd) in present day Hungary. Although he trained to become a Serbian Orthodox priest, this goal was abandoned in 1813 when he decided instead to take part in the failed First Serbian Uprising against the Ottomans who controlled Belgrade at the time. Afterwards, in 1815, Fisher fled Europe for the safety and opportunities of the United States.\n\nHis immigration to the United States at this early part of the 19th century predates the much later waves of Serbian and Montenegrin arrivals that began in the 1880s, thus tradition holds that George Fisher was the first of his countrymen to arrive.\n\nFisher's life in North America was tied to the early history of the west. In 1825 he moved to Mexico, founded a Spanish language newspaper El Mercurio del Puerto de Matamoras, and was appointed by the Mexican government to be a customs agent in Galveston. His activities in Texas form the basis of his renown, having fought as a volunteer for the Republic of Texas, and served as a judge, an attorney, and a brigadier general. In his journalistic pieces he supported the movement to make Texas part of the United States. Later, in the 1850s, Fisher moved to California after the start of the Gold Rush and held the public position of Secretary of the California Land Commission, which decided Mexican and Spanish land claims in California.\n\nMuch of what is known about George Fisher comes from his family biography listed below. Search for items about George Fisher in the Library of Congress online catalog.\n\nItems about George Fisher\n\nNot the first Serbian American chronologically, but the first in renown is the inventor Nikola Tesla. Tesla, the son of a Serbian Orthodox priest, hailed from the region of Lika in the Krajina. After studying in Prague and Graz, Tesla made his way to the United States in 1884 where he initially worked for Edison Machine Works owned by Thomas Alva Edison. The two soon parted ways and Tesla founded his own company so that he could explore his own ideas and inventions.\n\nFrom alternating current and robotics to radar and wireless communications, not to mention the murkiness surrounding his so-called death ray, it is hard to conceive of modern life without some invention, technological advance or discovery made by Nikola Tesla. His story of attaining wealth from his numerous ground-breaking patents, to losing it all because of poor business management and unscrupulous rivals is heart-rending, but Tesla's name lives on, not just because many biographers have recently rediscovered him, but also because Elon Musk named his electric car company in his honor. Tesla was one of the most important American inventors during the monumental era of technological development that was the early 20th century.\n\nWhile this summary of Tesla's life is by necessity extremely abbreviated, a veritable publishing industry has emerged regarding Tesla, so it will be no trouble finding books about him in English and Serbian. Below we present just a few available in the Library of Congress. A brief entry on Tesla also appears in A Lexicon of Serbian-American Writers. To find additional titles search the following subject headings for items by and about Nikola Tesla in the Library of Congress online catalog:\n\nNikola Tesla as author\n\nItems about Nikola Tesla\n\nAfter Nikola Tesla, probably the most famous Serbian American was Michael (Mihajlo) Pupin, a prominent physicist and inventor. Pupin came to the United States from the village of Idvor in Vojvodina when he was a teenager. He won the Pultizer Prize in 1924 for his autobiographical immigrant story From Immigrant to Inventor External.\n\nPupin graduated from and later held an engineering professorship at Columbia University in New York, where the current Pupin Physics Laboratories was named in his honor. Pupin is perhaps most famous for his patented Pupin coils which were critical to the development of long distance telephone communications. His Pupin coil patent made him rich and enabled him to engage in philanthropic efforts on behalf of his countrymen and home country of Serbia.\n\nOne of the most energetic Serbian immigrants regarding assistance to his war torn homeland and an active member of the Serbian émigré community in the United States, Pupin was the founder of the patriotic Serbian National Defense Council of America External. Pupin even influenced Woodrow Wilson in supporting the post World War I independence of Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nBesides his autobiography, Pupin authored works on science, technology and politics, many of which are held by the Library of Congress. A brief entry on Pupin appears in A Lexicon of Serbian-American Writers.

What many people do not know is that Karl Malden's original name was Mladen Đorđe Sekulović and that he was the son of a Serbian immigrant from Bosnia. He spoke Serbian fluently.\n\nThe Library of Congress holds many films in which Karl Malden acted, as well as audio recordings of his performances and even interviews with Larry King and Johnny Carson.

He even served as the mayor of Cleveland for three terms from 1980 to 1989. He went on to become a two-time governor of Ohio. With his success in state politics, Voinovich turned his attention to representing Ohio on the national level as a two-term senator from 2000-2011.\n\nDuring his time as a public servant, Voinovich pressed for policies that brought business development in his state. He was a moderate Republican who focused much attention on responsible use of tax payer dollars and pushed Washington to address the growing national debt. On the international scene Voinovich is remembered for his role on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee where he supported the expansion of NATO, advocated for human rights as the Commissioner of the Helsinki Commission 2001-2002, and worked on issues related to peace-keeping in the Balkans.\n\nVoinovich's ancestry is Serbian on his father's side (from the Kordun area in the Krajina), and Slovenian on his mother's side.
