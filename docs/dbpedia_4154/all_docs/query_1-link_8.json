        "text": "The Yugoslav Wars (1991–2001) brought destruction and exclusion as many citizens of former Yugoslavia found themselves in new nation-states/entities, homogenized through war violence that was not welcoming of other nationalities, now reconceptualized as minorities. Neighbors of different ethnicities living in a city/town/village suddenly became aliens for emerging states, which fostered the idea of mono-ethnicity. Therefore, national indifference was not an option, as membership in the majority ethno-nation became a prerequisite for citizenship. Benedict Anderson’s (Reference Anderson1991) concept of “imagined communities” as well as Steven Lukes’ (Reference Lukes2005) theory of hegemony point out that (ethnic) identity is given by society rather than chosen by the individuals themselves, which became quite visible in the post-Yugosphere. Like any other media, films contribute to invoking the sense of an imagined community (Anderson Reference Anderson1991). Still, they often criticize and denounce a community’s cracks and defects. This article explores how a new generation of post-Yugoslav filmmakers deal with the question of ethnic identity and face the division today.\n\nThe recent article “(Not) Dealing with War Crimes on Film: Post-Yugoslav Cinema as a Method of Fostering Reconciliation and Peace” (Jaugaitė Reference Jaugaitė2021) argued that post-Yugoslav cinema “breaks through the cracks” of hegemony as contemporary filmmakers challenge narratives, impressions, and problems constructed by ruling elites. This article strives to answer how independent cinema in the nation states of former Yugoslavia investigates the dilemma of ethnic identity in order to overcome the political frames of ethnic identity constructed by nationalistic ideology. To answer this question, I will provide examples from contemporary post-Yugoslav cinema. I analyze cinematic representations and conduct a deeper textual analysis, using the case study of Srbenka (Reference Slijepčević2018), directed by Nebojša Slijepčević. In such a way I explore the film’s context, plot and structure, conflict, characterization, style, and point of view. I seek to chart how the other (other ethnicities) are represented in Srbenka and other selected films, explaining why the characters do not fit or how they subvert dominant narratives of national identity. In this article, I will focus on various co-productions that cover almost the whole territory of ex-Yugoslavia.Footnote 1 Post-Yugoslav cinema shares cultural characteristics, a historical background, and, most importantly, a Yugoslav film tradition that I will shortly introduce before conducting the analysis."
