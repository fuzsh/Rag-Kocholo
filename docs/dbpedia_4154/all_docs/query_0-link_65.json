Even the royal couple, Aleksandar and Natalija Obrenović, attended the first cinema show.\n\nSerbian cinematography has never been too far from the worlds, which is proven by the fact that 12 movies, some of which can still be seen in the Yugoslav Film Archive in Belgrade, were filmed in Serbia before World War II.\n\nSerbian cinematography has had numerous fruitful stages and one of the most popular and most important is the tradition of “partisan films” with some of the best achievements of Serbian and Yugoslav cinematography. Not even the biggest film stars like Orson Welles, Richard Burton and Yul Brynner resisted the temptation to play in partisan films.\n\nThe most expensive Yugoslav film was a partisan film “The Battle of Neretva” with the budget of 4, 5 million dollars and more than 10,000 soldiers participating as extras. The popularity of this genre surpassed all frontiers, even the language limitations, since these movies have become highly popular even in India and China. In China, a Serbian actor Velimir Bata Živojinović is still recognized as “Valter” from the famous “Valter defends Sarajevo” partisan film.\n\nSerbia has recently become a desirable location for filming Hollywood blockbusters. Untouched nature of extraordinary beauties, historical locations as if they were made for film sets and hospitable hosts always ready to help, attract the attention of numerous producers. The celebrated actor Ralph Fiennes came to Serbia and filmed “Coriolanus“, his directorial debut. Gerard Butler also filmed here and walked the streets of Belgrade to the delight of all the local girls.\n\nIn 2011 Serbia has celebrated the 100th anniversary of the first film made in Serbia. The movie was named “Karađorđe“. It is about the life and work of the eponymous leader of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman rule, and was found in the Austrian film archive after six decades of searching. The oldest documentary is “Krunisanje kralja Petra I Karadjordjevića” (The Crowning of the King Petar I Karadjordjević) shot in 1904, and can nowadays be seen in the Yugoslav Film Archive or Film Archives in Belgrade.\n\nSerbian theatre and cinema\n\nSerbia has a well-established theatrical tradition with many theatres. The Serbian National Theatre was established in 1861 with its building dating from 1868. The company started performing opera from the end of the 19th century and the permanent opera was established in 1947. It established a ballet company.\n\nBitef, Belgrade International Theatre Festival, is one of the oldest theatre festivals in the world. New Theatre Tendencies is the constant subtitle of the Festival. Founded in 1967, Bitef has continually followed and supported the latest theater trends. It has become one of five most important and biggest European festivals. It has become one of the most significant culture institutions of Serbia.\n\nThe cinema was established reasonably early in Serbia with 12 films being produced before the start of World War II. The most notable of the prewar films was Mihailo Popovic's The Battle of Kosovo in 1939.\n\nCinema prospered after World War II. The most notable postwar director was Dušan Makavejev who was internationally recognized for Love Affair: Or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator in 1969 focusing on Yugoslav politics. Makavejev's Montenegro was made in Sweden in 1981. Zoran Radmilović was one of the most notable actors of the postwar period.\n\nSerbian cinema continued to make progress in the 1990s and today despite the turmoil of the 1990s. Emir Kusturica won two Golden Palms for Best Feature Film at the Cannes Film Festival, for When Father Was Away on Business in 1985 and then again for Underground in 1995. In 1998, Kusturica won a Silver Lion for directing Black Cat, White Cat.\n\nAs at 2001, there were 167 cinemas in Serbia (excluding Kosovo) and over 4 million Serbs went to the cinema in that year. In 2005, San zimske noći (A Midwinter Night's Dream) directed by Goran Paskaljević caused controversy over its criticism of Serbia's role in the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.\n\nSeveral Serbian-American filmmakers have established a loose, intellectual multi-media making tradition, working within prominent academic institutions and also creating works marked by high stylistic experimentation. Three figures here would include Slavko Vorkapic, creator of famed montage sequences for Hollywood films and Dean of the USC Film School; Vlada Petric, television and film director, archivist, and founding curator of the Harvard Film Archive; and Vladan Nikolic, creator of the Zenith film and transmedia project as well as Professor at the New School for Social Media in New York City.\n\nEmerge Films Solutions\n\nhttps://emergefilmsolutions.com/country/serbia/\n\nSerbia Film & Photography Production Services\n\nAre you a media company, brand, ad agency or production company looking for film / photography production support or shooting crew in Serbia?
