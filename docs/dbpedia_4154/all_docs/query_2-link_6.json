        "text": "I don't write reviews. Don't know why anyone read reviews anyway, it would be smarter just to go and watch whatever you think its interesting for you to watch. But for this movie, I have to say something.\n\nI'm from Kosovo. Born and raised there. And I very well know the whole situation, and movie has been placed well. Everything that you see is true - all the pain and suffering of a little Serbian boy, all the bad treatment of his father, the Serbian Albanian relationship, corrupt police, very cynical international police, everything is right, correct and in place, not at all exaggerated, its even worse, if you ask me.\n\nBut, I have to state some critics as well (but it will not matter for you if you ex-pat and not from Kosovo):\n\n1. It's not possible that father and son have two different accents. They are not extremely different, but they are different, and thats were director failed, and where main actor who's really good actor, but born in Bosnia and Hercegovina and raised in Belgrade, in which accent is really different (difference between the accents of Kosova and Belgrade is something like being from Bristol and Leeds, or even better -Newcastle)) failed as well.\n\n2. There are many holes in the script, but just to mention big one - it doesn't matter that their grandmother was Serbian but no 10year old Albanian kid would ever know how to speak Serbian in 2004 (or later)\n\nI'll stop here. Would like to mention once again that all the minuses are not relevant if you are foreigner, but they are visible for someone who's from Kosovo.\n\nAnyway, please watch the movie, its worth watching."
