        "text": "Scroll the list below for selected books, reports, and studies written by or about Serbian American communities in the United States. To find more such items in the Library of Congress collections, please look at some of the bibliographies described in the section for reference books or use the subject headings listed above to search the Library of Congress Online Catalog. The citations below are arranged into two sections: works in English and works in Serbian. Titles link to fuller bibliographic information in the Online Catalog. If the titles are available digitally, links are provided.\n\nBooks in English\n\nThe materials of Serbian and Montenegrin interest in the Manuscript Reading Room of the Library of Congress are limited to those of American provenance such as the papers of U.S. diplomats and political figures. The most pertinent example related to Serbs in the United States is the collection of papers of John Adams Kingsbury, an American social reformer, who was very active with war relief groups trying to help Serbia and former Yugoslavia. His collection includes the papers of the America-Yugoslav Society, information about Serbian reparation bonds 1922-1925, and the American Committee for Yugoslav Relief 1945-1947, among other topics.\n\nCorrespondence of the Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla are available on microfilm. The letters are copies of originals held in the Muzej Nikole Tesle External (Tesla Museum), Beograd, Serbia. Correspondents include Robert Underwood Johnson, J. Pierpont Morgan, George Scherff, George Westinghouse, and the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company.\n\nSome larger historical collections such as the Woodrow Wilson Papers also have content elucidating the complex political situation and boundaries affecting the Serbs of the time, with letters from Serbs living in the United States advocating for President Wilson to support Serbian positions during WWI and the subsequent peace negotiations.\n\nBelow are descriptions of selected collections with content relevant to the study of Serbs in the United States. Titles link to fuller bibliographic information in the Library of Congress Online Catalog. For all collections researchers should contact the Manuscript Reading Room in advance of a research trip, because some collections may have access restrictions and others are stored off-site.\n\nThis section of our guide covers electronic resources or databases that may contain valuable information for researching Serbian communities in the United States. There are no databases devoted solely to this topic, rather we list more general sources with applicable content. Access to all of the sources described here is limited to onsite use only at the Library of Congress. They are not freely available on the internet. Freely available digital resources are described in the section of this guide for External Resources.\n\nSubscription resources marked with a padlock are available to researchers on-site at the Library of Congress. If you are unable to visit the Library, you may be able to access these resources through your local public or academic library. Feel free to explore our E-Resources Electronic Catalog. You may discover which databases we offer, but you will need to come to the Library to use them.\n\nBiographies are a popular genre for learning about how people lived in circumstances, places, and time periods other than our own. Below is a list of selected biographies, autobiographies and memoirs by and about Serbs and Montenegrins who immigrated to the United States or individuals born here of Serbian or Montenegrin descent. The books below represent people of many professions and from many states in the United States. Some of the books are about prominent figures, but others tell the tales of ordinary citizens. Even more such content can be found in the Famous Serbian and Montenegrin Americans section of this guide. Since the list is far from comprehensive, please also search the subject headings listed above in the online catalog.\n\nThe books are organized into two sections: Biographies and Memoirs in English and Biographies and Memoirs in Serbian. Titles link to fuller bibliographic information in the Library of Congress Online Catalog. If the titles are available digitally, links are provided.\n\nBiographies and Memoirs in English\n\nThe Serbian diaspora communities in the United States are closely linked to their faith - the Orthodox Eastern religion. The Serbian Orthodox Church serves as a focal point for community gatherings, cultural activities, and language and patriotic educational efforts. No guide to the Serbian American communities would be complete without at least some content on the Church, its teachings and its role in preserving the ethnic and national ties outside of the original homeland.\n\nBelow are resources in the Library of Congress collections about the Orthodox Eastern religion and its local Serbian churches and parishes. The materials were selected to provide some representation of the kinds of materials produced by and for their communities. Many websites of local parishes in the United States are included in the related Voices: Eastern and Central European Americans Web Archive in order to preserve Serbian American digital content for future researchers. See also the page in this guide for Newspapers and Periodicals for a list of Serbian American serials which often contain information about the religious side of the Serbian American diaspora. Titles link to fuller bibliographic information in the Library of Congress Online Catalog. If the titles are available digitally, links are provided.\n\nAlthough the Library of Congress has a deep collection of the Serbian American publishing output, our collection is far from comprehensive. Pertinent information can also be found on the Internet and other libraries or local historical societies, especially for publications from the decades before World War II.\n\nThis section provides a selected list of sites related in some way to research on the Serbian diaspora in the United States. In addition to the sites listed below, the Library of Congress will soon release a web archive devoted to Voices of Central and East European Americans, including almost 80 sites related to Serbian Americans. When the archive is available, we will link it here."
