        "text": "TIVAT, Montenegro — Several dozen protesters had gathered on the promenade of the coastal town of Tivat, wedged between Montenegro’s rugged mountains and a sparkling Adriatic Sea. Behind them, as if in cue, a superyacht was pulling into port.\n\n“They want to turn this place into the next Monte Carlo,” a local journalist and activist, Antonela Rajcevic, told the group. “It is great if you are a billionaire or a millionaire, but it is not a good place for the citizens of Montenegro.”\n\nMs. Rajcevic and other organizers were traveling across tiny Montenegro, in late April, trying to keep alive weeks of protests against the government of President Milo Djukanovic.\n\nBut with summer fast approaching, and tourism season arriving, hopes for a ‘‘Balkan Spring’’ seem likely to be disappointed in Montenegro, as they have so far elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia."
