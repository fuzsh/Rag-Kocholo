This film takes us on a cinematic journey with a man who has dedicated his life to understanding the connection between illness, addiction, trauma, and the society we live in.\n\nIn this film, trauma is portrayed as an invisible force that greatly influences our lives. It shapes the way we live, love, and perceive the world around us. Dr. Maté offers us a new vision: a society informed about trauma where parents, teachers, doctors, and society as a whole are not focused on suppressing symptoms and condemning but rather seek to understand the sources from which alarming behaviors and illnesses arise in the wounded human soul. He points us towards the path of individual and collective healing.\n\n“Trauma is not what happens to you. Trauma is what happens inside you as a result of what happens to you,” believes Dr. Gabor Maté.\n\nThe filmmakers pose the question of how individuals and society as a whole deal with traumas.\n\n“When we started working on this film, we thought we were among the fortunate ones who had a carefree childhood. We believed that trauma was caused by bad things happening to people, really bad things like war, murder, violence, and the like… But as we learned from Dr. Gabor Maté, traumas happen to everyone,” say directors Zaya and Maurizio Benazzo.\n\nThe premieres and screenings of the documentary film will also serve as a catalyst for a series of transformative workshops and engaging lectures led by Dr. Gabor Maté throughout the Balkans – in Belgrade, Banja Luka, Sarajevo, and Ljubljana. These events aim to empower participants with valuable insights and practical tools to confront trauma, foster emotional resilience, and create a healthier and more compassionate community.\n\nJoin us in this unique opportunity as, under the auspices of the Novak Djokovic Foundation, we come together to explore “The Wisdom of Trauma” and embark on a journey of self-awareness, healing, and growth. The film screenings, as an introduction to the conversations and workshops that follow with Dr. Maté, promise to be an enriching experience that will leave a lasting impact on individuals and communities throughout the Balkans.\n\nNDF partners on the screenings of “The Wisdom of Trauma” are Cineplexx and Volvo."
