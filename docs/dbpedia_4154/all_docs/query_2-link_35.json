        "text": "When you first travel to Drvengrad, it feels as if you‚Äôve arrived at a traditional Serbian village. With quaint wooden houses, colorful street signs, and a calm atmosphere, Drvengrad is the quintessential selo (village)!\n\nBut wait, let‚Äôs play a game‚Ä¶\n\nTake a guess at how old Drvengrad is: 50 years? 75? Maybe even 150 years?\n\nNope! It‚Äôs actually less than 20 years old‚Ä¶ and, most likely, younger than you or me. üòä\n\nThat‚Äôs because Drvengrad isn‚Äôt really a traditional Serbian village (or at least not in the typical sense). It was actually created in the early 2000s as a film set for Emir Kusturica‚Äôs movie Life Is a Miracle but was so well-liked that it turned into its own tourist attraction.\n\nThanks to this, Drvengrad is a popular stop on most West Serbia itineraries and is easily reached from Mokra Gora, Zlatibor, and other nearby cities. It‚Äôs only a 3-hour drive from Belgrade and makes for a fantastic weekend getaway or a drawn-out day trip.\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in traveling to Drvengrad, look no further than this Drvengrad travel guide. It covers everything you need to know, from how to get to Drvengrad to the history, what to see, where to stay, and much more!\n\n‚Äî\n\nWhat is Drvengrad?\n\nBefore we go strolling around Drvengrad, let‚Äôs take a few paragraphs to appreciate the history behind this famous village‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶ Starting with the name! Drvengrad literally translates to Timber Town (drvo ‚Äì timber/wood, grad ‚Äì city) and is a pretty straightforward interpretation of the place. Seriously, no matter where you look, everything ‚Äî from the sidewalk to the roofs, doors, walls, and everything in between ‚Äî is made of some kind of wood!\n\nHowever, that‚Äôs not the end of the story. This place actually goes by two other names: Meƒáavnik (named after the area around the village) and K√ºstendorf (a German-sounding name that‚Äôs made up of Kust, a nickname for Emir Kusturica, and dorf, which means village ‚Äî literally, Kusturica‚Äôs village).\n\nNow, onto the history. When coming up with the idea for his now-famous film, Emir Kusturica stated that he ‚Äúwished to build [his] own village,‚Äù especially after his birth city, Sarajevo, was badly damaged during the Balkan Wars.\n\nThe village is based on the architecture of traditional Dinaric-style log cabins that were found around Mt. Tara hundreds of years ago, along with a few aesthetic touches from Emir Kusturica himself (like the colorful red-and-yellow limousine!).\n\nAlthough Drvengrad isn‚Äôt particularly big, it makes up for its size with a warm and friendly atmosphere.\n\nAs the Drvengrad tourist center notes, ‚ÄúThere is something in the water and in the air; there is something in the food and the drink, and in the people, too; there is something among the dogs, which stop being strays at Meƒáavnik, and something in the ambience and the atmosphere.‚Äù\n\nThe complex has everything a guest could ever need, from the intricate St. Sava church to the cheerful log cabins, cinema, restaurants, a homemade cake shop, and even its own dairy farm, complete with 20 Gataƒçko cows!\n\nDrvengrad Fun Facts\n\nStill want to know a few more interesting things about Drvengrad? Be my guest.\n\n1 ‚Äî There are a bunch of Easter eggs all around DrvengradNo no, not literally, but in the sense that there are plenty of hidden references and inside jokes that Emir Kusturica put all around his village. For example, Kusturica pays homage to his favorite writers, artists, and directors ‚Äî and does it very intentionally. For example, there‚Äôs the Ivo Andric Library, which was named after the famous writer. Just a few steps away is the Stanley Kubrick Cinema, who was a talented film producer and director.\n\nThere‚Äôs even the Milorad ƒåavic pool complex which, you guessed it, is named after a Serbian swimmer who went head-to-head with ‚Äã‚ÄãMichael Phelps in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\n2 ‚Äî Emir ‚Äã‚ÄãKusturica lives in Drvengrad‚Ä¶ After Life Is A Miracle was released, Kusturica decided to make Drvengrad (or, rather, the area next to it) his primary residence. Who knows, maybe you‚Äôll accidentally bump into him while strolling along one of the streets!\n\n3 ‚Äî ‚Ä¶ And gets plenty of visitors\n\nWhen he‚Äôs not directing award-winning movies, Emir Kusturica can be found showing Drvengrad to famous guests like Johnny Depp. In fact, this Pirates of the Caribbean star even had a statue dedicated to him in 2010, which you can check out. There‚Äôs also an old interview of Depp at Drvengrad on Youtube.\n\nHow to get to Drvengrad\n\nThe easiest way to get to Drvengrad is by renting a car and driving there. It‚Äôs extremely convenient because you can also check out other attractions in Western Serbia, especially since many are very close by!\n\nBY CAR\n\nWe rented a car from Sixt using RentalCars, which I highly recommend. The roads in Serbia are fantastic (even in the mountains!) and everything went very smoothly.\n\nThere is both open air and covered parking at Drvengrad, which can hold almost 100 cars. Parking is free and is right in front of the main entrance.\n\nFROM SERBIA\n\nFrom Belgrade ‚Äî Drvengrad is located some 200 kilometers (125 mi) from Serbia‚Äôs capital, Belgrade, and takes about 3 hours to get there.\n\nFrom Nis ‚Äî The A1 road is the fastest way to get from Nis to Drvengrad, at 300 km (185 mi) and a 4-hour drive.\n\nZlatibor ‚Äî If you‚Äôre traveling from the ‚ÄòGateway to West Serbia,‚Äô you‚Äôll have an easy (and picturesque!) ride. Zlatibor to Drvengrad is less than 40 km (25 mi) away and a 40-minute drive.\n\nMokra Gora ‚Äî No need for a car if you‚Äôre going from Mokra Gora to Drvengrad ‚Äî it‚Äôs only 1.5 km (<1 mi) away and you can go by foot. :)\n\n‚Äî\n\nFROM OTHER COUNTRIES\n\nFrom Sarajevo ‚Äî Planning to take a day trip from Bosnia? It‚Äôll take you about 2.5 hours and 140 km (87 mi) to get from Sarajevo to Drvengrad. While you‚Äôre driving, don‚Äôt forget to stop at Andriƒágrad, another project by Emir Kusturica that‚Äôs located along the way in Visegrad.\n\nFrom Dubrovnik ‚Äî It‚Äôs a bit of a stretch to travel from Dubrovnik to Drvengrad, but still doable if you‚Äôre on a road trip. The journey takes about 265 km (165 mi) and about 5 hours, not including time spent on border crossings.\n\nFrom Kotor ‚Äî Similar to Dubrovnik, traveling from Kotor will take about 5 hours (without factoring in borders) and almost 300 km.\n\nBY BUS / TRAIN\n\nAlthough it‚Äôs a bit of a journey, you can get to Drvengrad by taking a mix of bus, train, and taxi.\n\nFor example, there‚Äôs a train route that goes from Belgrade to U≈æice, which is considered the ‚Äògateway to Western Serbia‚Äô and also one of the closest towns to Drvengrad.\n\nThe train journey takes around 3.5 hours and costs 770 RSD (second class) to 1100 RSD (first class).\n\nYou can check the train‚Äôs timetable on the official Rail Serbia website ‚Äî just type in from ‚Äò‚Äã‚ÄãBEOGRAD CENTAR‚Äô and to ‚ÄòU≈ΩICE‚Äô (make sure to pay careful attention, as there are other cities with a very similar name!)\n\nFrom U≈æice, you‚Äôll need to take a 45-minute taxi ride to Drvengrad.\n\nAlternatively, you can take a train to Zlatibor and take a 40-minute taxi to Drvengrad. Either U≈æice or Zlatibor are excellent starting points if you plan to stay in the area overnight (or for a few days).\n\nBY TOUR\n\nIf you prefer not to get caught up in transfer and timetables, there‚Äôs an easier option: taking a private tour! This is perfect for travelers who are short on time, want to have a tour guide explain the sights, and/or don‚Äôt feel like planning every single detail.\n\nHere are some of the best day tours that include Drvengrad as a stop:\n\nüìç From Belgrade: Sargan 8 Railway and Wooden City 1 Day Tour\n\nüìç Belgrade: Mokra Gora, Drvengrad, and Sargan 8 Railroad Tourüìç Western Serbia 1-Day Tour of the Key Sites from Belgrade\n\nüìç Sarajevo: Visegrad, Sarkan Eight Railway & Kurstendorf Tour\n\nBY HELICOPTER\n\nNo, I‚Äôm not kidding ‚Äî Emir Kusturica wanted a heliport in his village, so he got it. You can find all the info here if you plan to fly into Drvengrad. :)\n\nWhat to do in Drvengrad\n\nWhile strolling around Drvengrad, I overheard another guest say something like, ‚ÄúWow, this is like the Serbian version of Disneyland!‚Äù\n\nHowever, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs telling the whole story. While Disneyland might have a bunch of attractions and things to do, the beauty of Drvengrad is quite the opposite.\n\nIt‚Äôs a place where you go to chill out, explore the side streets, enjoy a traditional Serbian meal (or pizza, both are great ), and feel inspired by Kusturica‚Äôs vision for the entire village. It almost feels like an open-air museum!\n\nWhile there‚Äôs no right or wrong way of doing Drvengrad, here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\nMarvel at the architecture and cute log cabins\n\nDid you know that Drvengrad‚Äôs layout was inspired by Ephesus, the ancient town in western Turkey? It‚Äôs true: Kusturica wanted to have a ‚Äòself sustaining city‚Äô that had a neat rectangular shape. Who knew that Turkey and Serbia had so much in common!\n\nYou could spend hours walking around and admiring the cute details, such as the colorful doors, heart-shaped fence, and curious (painted) cats peeking out of the windows‚Ä¶\n\nIn the middle of Drvengrad is a small church dedicated to Saint Sava (you can see his portrait in the mosaic above the entrance). Although he‚Äôs the patron saint of Serbia, you might recognize his name from another place ‚Äî the Church of Saint Sava is one of the biggest tourist attractions in the capital, Belgrade!\n\nFinally, don‚Äôt forget to snap a photo or two near the village‚Äôs biggest attractions: the colorful red-and-yellow car cheerfully parked near the front.\n\nTry to see how many ‚Äòcelebrities‚Äô you can spot\n\nWhile real celebrities tend to visit Drvengrad once in a while (especially if it‚Äôs during the annual K√ºstendorf Film Festival!), you can see dozens of stars any time you visit Drvengrad. How, you might ask? It‚Äôs very simple!\n\nRemember how I mentioned that Kusturica liked to plant ‚ÄòEaster eggs‚Äô and references all over Drvengrad? Besides the buildings, each street in Drvengrad is named after individuals that Kusturica is inspired by.\n\nFor example, one street is dedicated to Nikola Tesla, the famous inventor, while another is named after Cuban revolutionary Ernesto ‚ÄúChe‚Äù Guevara. You might also see Diego Maradona street (whom Kusturica made a documentary about!), and another famous sports celebrity, tennis player Novak Djokovic.\n\nEat delicious Serbian food\n\nOnce you‚Äôve spotted a few celebrities (or painted cats), it‚Äôs time to take a break at one of the five restaurants and cafes.\n\nHere are the names: The Kapor Bar, ƒÜorkan‚Äôs Cake Shop (ƒÜorkan), Konak Pizzeria and Cafe, Viscounts Restaurant, and Lotika Restaurant.\n\nWe chose Viscounts Restaurant because it was the most crowded (which is always a good sign, right?) and looked the most interesting. To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much when we ordered from the menu, but after trying the food, I was so happy that we did! The interior was beautiful and had an entire wall full of books (perfect to flip through while waiting for your food ).\n\nAlso, remember I mentioned a cake shop at the beginning of this blog post? Now it‚Äôs time to let you in on a little secret‚Ä¶ That bakery is called ƒÜorkan and it‚Äôs delightful!\n\nThe cake shop/bakery serves local Serbian sweets, including tulumbe, tufahije, urmasice, and more. Try their krempite (a best seller!), a soft and delicious cake that‚Äôs sure to delight you.\n\nBuy souvenirs\n\nLast but certainly not least, don‚Äôt leave Drvengrad without taking a souvenir home!\n\nAt the far end of Drvengrad ‚Äî behind the church and a few stairs down ‚Äî you‚Äôll notice a few colorful wooden kiosks (photo above) with tons of goodies on display. These are souvenir shops that sell everything from magnets to traditional shirts, dishes, wooden ornaments, hand-painted crafts, and much more.\n\nWhere to Stay Near Drvengrad\n\nPlanning to visit on an overnight trip? Great choice ‚Äî there are plenty of amazing places to stay near Drvengrad! Here are some top picks:\n\nMecavnik\n\nIf you fell in love with Drvengrad‚Äôs charming village life, why not stay there a little longer?
