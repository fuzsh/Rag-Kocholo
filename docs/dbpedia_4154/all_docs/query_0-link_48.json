It is urgent for European powers to act in time and in a way that can pre-empt it. And the EU must acknowledge that a dialogue based on the promise of EU integration cannot work without this promise being credible.\n\nToday, Serbia and Kosovo stand at the brink of a catastrophe.

Then it broke down in March 2020.

It is no outlier. All Western Balkan states are stuck. Their accession process resembles a bus without wheels, with North Macedonia discussing conditions for moving up a row of seats inside a vehicle going nowhere. It is time for the EU to enhance the process by offering all European democracies membership in the European Single Market as a credible interim goal.\n\nNorth Macedonia has been blocked on its accession path for more than a decade.

A coalition of EU member states should establish joint asylum centres at the EU’s external borders. After fair and quick procedures, those not in need of protection should be returned to their home countries. Those in need of protection should be taken in by the members of this coalition. African countries of origin need to be offered tangible benefits to turn them into partners."
