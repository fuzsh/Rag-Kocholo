        "text": "On April 5, 1941, a date Serbs will recognize, men on a country road board Krstic's bus for Belgrade: two Gypsies who occasionally sing about misery, an aging war vet, a Nazi sympathizer, a dapper singer, a consumptive, and a man with a shotgun. Krstic is a world-weary cynic, out for a buck; the driver is his son, the simple, cheerful Misko. En route they pick up a priest and young newlyweds going to the seaside. Along the way, mis-adventure strikes: a flat tire, a rickety bridge, a farmer who's plowed the road, a funeral, two feuding families, an army detail, and a lost wallet slow the bus and expose rifts among the travelers. On April 6, amid rumors of war, they reach Belgrade...\n\nAt the Belgrade army hospital, casualties of Bosnian civil war are treated. In the hospital they remember their youth and the war. Two young boys, Halil, a Muslim, and Milan, a Serb, have grown up together near a deserted tunnel linking the Yugoslav cities of Belgrade and Zagreb. They never dare go inside, as they believe an ogre resides there. Twelve years later, during the Bosnian civil war, Milan, who is trapped in the tunnel with his troop, and Halil, find themselves on opposing sides, fatefully heading toward confrontation.\n\nThe story follows an underground weapons manufacturer in Belgrade during WWII and evolves into fairly surreal situations. A black marketeer who smuggles the weapons to partisans doesn't mention to the workers that the war is over, and they keep producing. Years later, they break out of their underground \"shelter\" --- only to convince themselves that the war is still going on.\n\nBora the Gypsy is married to an older woman, and he falls in love with the younger Tissa, who is being offered in marriage by her father, to a young gypsy man. This marriage arrangement is according to custom. Tissa rejects her husband, claiming he is not able to consumate the marriage, and Bora joins her. They get a monk in the mountains to marry them. Unable to return to the Gypsy camp, Tissa tries to reach Belgrad on her own, but a couple of truck drivers rape her, and she does return in misery to her tribe. Meanwhile, Bora defends his honour the traditional way, in a knife duwl, and kills his opponent. Therefore he, too, must leave the tribe. And yet, we'll find happy gypsies...\n\nTito's break-up with Stalin in 1948 marked the beginning of not only confusing, but also very dangerous years for many hard-core Yugoslav communists. A careless remark about the newspaper cartoon is enough for Mesha to join many arrested unfortunates. His family is now forced to cope with the situation and wait for his release from prison. The story is told from the perspective of Malik, his young son who believes the mother's story about father being \"away on business\".\n\nA dense film that cuts up footage of a primary plot of two young Yugoslavian girls, one a politico and the other a sexpot, and an affair with a visiting Russian skater. Mixing metaphors of Russia's relationship with Yugoslavia, intercut with footage and interviews with Wilhelm Reich and Al Goldstein of Screw magazine. The film applies Reich's theories of Orgone energy and analogies of Stalinism as a form of Freudian sexual repression. Also known as W.R. The Mysteries of the Organism in English subtitled version. Was banned in Yugoslavia shortly after it was made.\n\nIlija Cvorovic, a reformed former Stalinist who spent several years in a prison as a political prisoner, is called in for a routine conversation. He returns home convinced that the police is interested in his subtenant, a businessman returning from Paris to open a tailor shop. Convinced that his subtenant represents the greatest threat to national security Ilija begins his own surveillance operation against him.\n\nOne week in a life of Branimir Mitrovic \"Floyd\", a young rally driver from the National Class (up to 785cc), dreaming of promotion to the higher category. He lives a carefree life of a Belgrade dandy boy, neglecting his girlfriend, avoiding his draft calls, and refusing to deal with any life responsibility in general. The decisive race on Saturday is only what he cares about.\n\nThe story of a ten years old boy who, as most of the children in Yugoslavia of the fifties can hardly imagine his life without the great national leader - marshal Tito. In his school, he wins the contest for the best Tito's composition. His reward is the participation in \"Tito's native land\" march. He claims in his work that he loves Tito more than his Dad and Mom, which makes them desperate. He does not understand what is so confusing and weird in his love towards the leader. This march will be a difficult temptation for him. Unaccustomed to nature, walks and independent living, harassed by the teacher, Stalinist, he fails, gets lost in the mountain and his life changes.\n\nMatko is a small time hustler, living by the river Danube with his 17 year old son Zare. After a failed business deal he owes money to the much more successful gangster Dadan. Dadan has a sister, Afrodita, that he desperately wants to see get married so they strike a deal: Zare is to marry her. But none of the two care much for an arranged marriage: Zare is in love with Ida, Afrodita is waiting for the man of her dreams.\n\nLemi and Kiza are two brothers who have to bring their dead grandfather from Belgrade to Vrsac, and having spent all their money, they decide to smuggle the body by train. They dress the grandfather and put the body on the train and tell everyone that he is sleeping. After Lemi and Kiza go to drink in the dining car, a drug dealer Limeni fearing police, inserts a drug package in the grandfather's pocket. The train suddenly brakes and a case falls directly on grandfather's head. Other passengers, thinking that it killed him, frenetically throw his body out of the window, under the pretext that the grandfather got up and walked out. Then a search for the grandfather's body starts, but it will not be easy.\n\nUrban comedy, happening during a night in Belgrade. Mare, Pop and Gojko are three friends who grew up together. Mare and Pop have always been musicians, while Gojko (who was harassed by them in school and nicknamed 'Sissy') became a 'guy in suit', boss of his own club and recording studio. Pop and Mare call on their friend from school days to help them release the record, but all this doesn't go so smoothly. Gojko hasn't forgotten his school days and now he is surrounded by bodyguards. On their way to the club, Mare and Pop meet false Santa Claus, 'cool' cop and of course - girls.\n\nThe film consists of three parallel stories that are interwoven and played in Vozdovac. In the first story, Braca tries to seduce Iris, a model from the city center. Although they try not to be \"two worlds\" they certainly are. In another story, Dule i Somi, in the football match Ipswich - Manchester, they bet on Ipswich to win because it defends their classmate. The third story takes place on the roof of the skyscraper where Avaks and Hybrid, proponents of the philosophy of \"most cost effective when I'm sitting in the house - no income, but no expenses\", spending the day doing nothing, expecting something to happen. Something happened - an unusual occurrence Avaks saw in the sky ...\n\nTill recently an University professor, a bohemian writer, a member of Belgrade's intellectual circles and a passionate opponent of the Milosevic's regime, TEJA is today a manager of a big publishing house. One day a strange visitor comes uninvited to his office, carrying a big suitcase. That man is LUKA, a former agent of the Serbian Security Service, now a taxi driver. Suddenly a surprising confrontation of these two men begins, which is full of incredible twists. As we get to know LUKA, we find that his mission for the last ten years was to daily shadow TEJA, to write reports on his behavior and acts, to watch on him even in the most intimate moments of his life. Gradually the last ten years of their lives begin to appear, the lives of these two men with quite different destinies. We see before us the chronicle of an age from the most incredible situations, often touching, sometimes irresistibly funny, to the most tragic events and the darkest war stories in the history of one ..."
