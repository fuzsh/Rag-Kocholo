        "text": "Cambodia and Genocidal Century (01:56)\n\nFREE PREVIEW\n\nThe twentieth century saw numerous genocides; the worst since the Holocaust occurred in Cambodia but is mostly unknown to the West. Shortly after the U.S. left Vietnam, Cambodia fell to the communist Khmer Rouge, unleashing the killing.\n\nAngkor Wat (01:31)\n\nAngkor Wat in Cambodia is one of the world's wonders, representing a great ancient civilization. We will talk to people throughout the country to learn the horrible story of what happened to Cambodia.\n\nU.S. Bombing and Pol Pot (00:52)\n\nThe Khmer Rouge emerged from the devastation of U.S. bombing of suspected Viet Cong encampments in Cambodia.\n\nIdeology of Purified Cambodia (01:58)\n\nPol Pot and other intellectuals wanted independence from France and embraced communism, racism, and the idea of a Cambodia purified of foreign and modern influences and its ruling class.\n\nDevastating Countryside (01:36)\n\nAfter the U.S. bombing peasants joined Pol Pot's guerilla army to fight Washington's \"puppets\" in Phnom Penh. Villages fell to their control through promises and brutality.\n\nCambodia and Vietnam April 1975 (01:39)\n\nThe North Vietnamese took Saigon, while the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh, where some welcomed their arrival. The first few days after takeover were peaceful.\n\nEvacuating Capital (01:34)\n\nClaiming the Americans were about to bomb, Communists evacuated Phnom Penh. They wanted to clear the capital and start over.\n\nCamps and Murders (01:59)\n\nThe Khmer Rouge herded the refugees to camps, separating children into their own camp. They murdered doctors, lawyers and others, and others died due to brutal conditions. A survivor gives a graphic account.\n\nGoals of Death March (01:33)\n\nThe Khmer Rouge wanted to remove all class enemies and break down society and family, leaving a malleable group of peasants who could be transformed into an ideal.\n\nCamps (02:48)\n\nCambodia isolated itself, and the outside world heard only rumors of the regime's atrocities. At labor camps, family relations and visible love were forbidden; children were told to look to the rulers and forbidden to love parents.\n\nEfficient Killing (03:17)\n\nTo save bullets, the Khmer Rouge killed people with clubs. Killers as young as 14 were conditioned to kill without remorse; one says he saw no way out, with the regime thoroughly in control.\n\nS-21 (03:07)\n\nAfter accusations of betrayal within the Khmer Rouge, unit S-21 was formed to purge the Party. Party members were tortured in cells into signing confessions, and then taken to fields to be killed.\n\nSurvivor Paints to Document (02:10)\n\nOnly seven people who survived Tuol Slent, because they were artists, useful for painting portraits of Pol Pot. One painted scenes from the camp upon his freedom.\n\nRepressing Memory (00:46)\n\nThe West has largely ignored the killing fields, and Cambodia has repressed them until recently. A new generation of Cambodians must decide how to deal with the history.\n\nVietnam Overthrows Pol Pot (02:00)\n\nSeeking to reclaim land Cambodia once controlled, Pol Pot attacked Vietnamese villages and massacred residents. Vietnam invaded in 1979, quickly overthrowing Pol Pot's regime.\n\nResponse to Release (01:45)\n\nThe Vietnamese found mass graves, starving orphans and slave labor camps. Many fled for Thailand when the Vietnamese arrived, while others returned home to rebuild.\n\nPol Pot's Retreat and Trial (02:09)\n\nPol Pot retreated to jungles when Vietnam invaded; his army long remained a threat, but the Khmer Rouge itself put Pol Pot on trial in 1997.\n\nPol Pot's Lack of Regrets (02:24)\n\nA Westerner who met with an aging Pol Pot talks about his charisma and firm belief that he had done good for Cambodia.\n\nDeath of Pol Pot (01:23)\n\nPol Pot died in 1998; we see him on his death bed in a jungle hut.\n\nTroubled Recovery (02:31)\n\nPost-killing fields Cambodia was almost without doctors and lawyers as it sought to rebuild. Development has been slow. Millions of landmines remain.\n\nPush for Trial (03:14)\n\nThere has long been impunity for Khmer Rouge henchmen. The UN pressures Cambodia's government for a foreign role in a planned trial. Henchmen have been tracked down in the jungle, among them master torturer Duch, now remorseful.\n\nReason for Trial (01:12)\n\nThere is doubt how fair a trial conducted by the Cambodians can be; the current Prime Minister spent time in the Khmer Rouge. The narrator quotes the Nuremberg prosecutor on the purpose of such trials.\n\nHow It Happened (00:41)\n\nPol Pot destroyed every institution of normal society and wielded absolute power. Under these conditions, genocide is possible.\n\nCredits: Investigative Reports: Return to the Killing Fields (00:30)\n\nCredits: Investigative Reports: Return to the Killing Fields"
