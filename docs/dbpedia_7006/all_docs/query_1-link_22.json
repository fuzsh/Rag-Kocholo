        "text": "For me cinema should be more than entertainment. Cinema should help us grapple with and understand our history. The Killing Fields is valuable because it captures the Cambodian Genocide, which is something the world has not reconciled with. The film is unfortunately not from the Cambodian perspective, but still, I am glad The Killing Fields exists.\n\nForgive me for not discussing the film straightaway. I feel the need to re-iterate history before writing more, because The Killing Fields is incomplete and should be placed in context. The Cambodian Genocide is a haunting and almost inexplicable event. It was perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge who ruled Cambodia in the late 1970s. In 4 years, at least 1.5 million people were killed,…\n\nA Law & Order journalist makes a life-long friend in war-torn CamfuckinBodia. A cafe goes boom. John Malkovich being John fuckin Malkovich. A Warlock with a camera. Coach, the Marine asshole. Getting your family the fuck outta Dodge. Random executions. Coca-Cola saving your ass from certain death. Hanging out with the French. The ultimate-fuckin darkroom. A bootleg passport. A gut-wrenching goodbye. Never giving up hope. Being trapped in the fuckin Killing Fields. A paddy field chain gang. A river of bones. Attempting the great escape. Fuckin landmines. The best phone call you will ever receive. I couldn't imagine a better fuckin ending. The realism in this film is fuckin insane. It didn't feel like I was watching a movie, it felt…\n\nThis straight-up might be the best first watch I've seen in a long time. For all its flaws (still mixed on Imagine playing in the end), this movie hit me so hard. The Killing Fields is consistently engaging, and the scope feels so huge and realistic. All the extras, the shots of the killing fields, the locations; absolutely immersive from start to finish.\n\nBut the real highlight is the relationship between Sydney and Dith Pran. Sam Waterson is solid but Haing S. Ngor... dude went hard. Everything about his performance was brilliant. It's a film ultimately split into two halves, and while Waterson and Ngor get around equal screentime in the first half, the second half is completely carried by…\n\nSo quiet and low-key for a war film, and with one of the heroes flawed and guilt-ridden: these unusual traits were what I really liked about it.\n\nThough it's not a war film per se, it's the story of friends separated by a war and a tyrannical regime. One or two reviewers on here seem to be expecting a movie that will give a full account of the Cambodian civil war and Pol Pot's regime, which was never the purpose of The Killing Fields, a film adaptation of a personal memoir. A memoir which was notably embellished.\n\nN.B. This post is influenced by several articles I've read online, including Wikipedia, and by the book of interviews with screenwriter Bruce Robinson,…\n\n\"The wind whispers of fear and hate. The war has killed love. And those that confess to the Angka are punished, and no one dare ask where they go. Here, only the silent survive.\"\n\n(Warning: spoilers ahead.)\n\nAll through March, TCM did their usual month of Oscars-related programming, this time specifically showing only films that won awards. I checked the entire schedule, and to my surprise, The Killing Fields was nowhere to be seen. You're telling me that they'll show several films showcasing white actors in yellowface - The Good Earth, Lost Horizon, Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing, The King and I, 7 Faces of Dr. Lao, The Year of Living Dangerously - but they couldn't set aside a block…\n\nWe are so used to seeing movies about heroic rescues and daring escapes that anything less might seem weak and impotent. Indeed, journalist Sydney Schanberg is angrily confronted about whether his extensive letter-writing campaign meant he was doing enough to locate and secure the release of his dear friend and colleague Dith Pran, who had disappeared into one of Pol Pot’s infamous re-education camps after the Khmer Rouge captured Cambodia in 1975, but what more could he have done? And what more could Dith do than bide his time and disguise himself as an illiterate farmer to hide the learning and multilingualism that would have been a death sentence? What more could any of us have done in their situation?…\n\nBack in the eighties there were production companies that would go out of their way to make a landmark film. They weren't interested in big money studios pouring millions of dollars into their productions, they wanted to maintain control and do things their way. People like Merchant Ivory, Enigma Films, and Goldcrest Films, which produced this important eighties title for director Roland Joffe, were about the only independent UK based companies making movies. Although many of their films weren't huge commercial hits, many of them told important historical or biographical stories the big studios wouldn't have been interested in. Things like Chariots Of Fire, Local Hero, Gandhi, A Room With A View, and my own personal favourite, The Mission, were…\n\n\"The wind whispers of fear and hate. The war has killed love. And those that confess to the Angka are punished, and no one dare ask where they go. Here, only the silent survive.\"\n\nHaing S. Ngor, who portrays the Cambodian journalist Dith Pran in this film, retrospectively said about his work in The Killing Fields: \"I wanted to show the world how deep starvation is in Cambodia, how many people die under communist regime. My heart is satisfied. I have done something perfect.\" And he did. Ngor, who lost his wife and their unborn child during imprisonment in a concentration camp under Pol Pot's regime, was cast with no previous acting experience for The Killing Fields and became the…\n\nAn unapologetically earnest journalism thriller that only occasionally steps into Oscar-bait territory. The film is mostly carried by sublime performances from the entire cast that feel real, raw, and vulnerable.\n\nThe story is structured a bit strangely, essentially switching the focus from one protagonist in the first half to another in the second. It starts off strong, with a group of journalists trying to survive an insurgency. When one of them is taken prisoner, the tone goes from being suspenseful to simply tragic. While I found the sudden change in focus a bit jarring, I definitely appreciate the interest in presenting the Cambodian perspective of the conflict. Even today most films will usually bring everything back around to am American…"
