        "text": "The Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor airs on the World Channel’s new series, Doc World, on September 18, 2016. Enter your zip code here to check your local listings.\n\nABOUT\n\nWhen Dr. Haing S. Ngor was forced into slave labor camps by the Khmer Rouge, little did he know he would escape four years of torture and be called upon to recreate his harrowing experiences in a film that would earn him an Academy Award®. For the Cambodian-Chinese doctor, “Nothing has shaped my life as much as surviving the Pol Pot regime. I am a survivor of the Cambodian holocaust. That’s who I am.” And little did anyone know that some twenty years later, Dr. Ngor would be gunned down in a Los Angeles Chinatown alley. How could it be that he would survive near death at the hands of the Khmer Rouge, only to be murdered by gangbangers in America?\n\n“The Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor” chronicles Dr. Ngor’s remarkable life journey – from a privileged life in Phnom Penh and up to the time of his murder…a case still tangled with questions of international conspiracy. At a time when “The Killing Fields” movie would be the world’s first wake-up call to the horrors of the Khmer Rouge, Dr. Ngor used his Hollywood celebrity status and became the de facto “face of Cambodia” to command global attention to the devastation of his homeland, where – from 1975 to 1979 – the Khmer Rouge’s social experiment to transform the country into a communist agricultural utopia caused the deaths of some 1.7 million Cambodians who perished from mass starvation, forced labor, torture, slavery, ethnic cleansing, and political executions.\n\nDr. Haing S. Ngor was an early and staunch advocate for a Khmer Rouge tribunal, a still-in-progress development that finally began in 2009. He opened an orphanage in Phnom Penh, built a schoolhouse in his home village, and delivered medical and humanitarian supplies to refugee camps. He publicly admonished world governments for ignoring the plight of his countrymen. His is an inspiring survivor’s story of reconciliation with the horrors of the genocide, a nightmare that still haunts Cambodia today as the country is grabbling with corruption, poverty, and the impunity of aging Khmer Rouge leaders now on trial.\n\nProduced, directed, and written by Oscar®-nominated and three-time Sundance award-winning filmmaker, Arthur Dong, “The Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor” is a singular documentary on one of the most well-known Cambodians and survivors of the genocide, applying an iconic movie, “The Killing Fields,” as a storytelling device and entree to blend history and biography into a dramatic transnational narrative.\n\nThe feature-length film imaginatively blends original animation, rare archival material, and newly shot footage with Dr. Ngor’s inspiring autobiography, “Survival in the Killing Fields,” co-written with Roger Warner. The Chicago Tribune book review by T.D. Allman raves: “Ngor starred in the best film on Cambodia that has ever been produced. And now he has written the best book on Cambodia that has ever been published.”\n\nTRAILER\n\nFILMMAKERS\n\nARTHUR DONG, Producer/Director/Writer/Editor\n\nThe Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S.
