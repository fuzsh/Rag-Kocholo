        "text": "In a rather strange departure for writer/director Christopher Nolan, his newest movie isn’t about superheros, outer space, dreams, or the insanity of reversing time. No, he’s keeping it pretty simple and telling the fact-based story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb.\n\nAdapted from the biography, American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Christopher Nolan spares no expense in his epic, sprawling screenplay with a three-hour-long film of Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the man who told the world, “Now I have become Death, the destroyer of worlds”. Told in a non-linear fashion with black & white flash-backs/flash-forwards as a framing device and needed exposition, we are witness to the stressed-out world of Oppy from a young man in college to his later years after his famous bombs were created. He meets the famous Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) abroad by way of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), a man who’ll factor into Oppy’s life later on when Strauss becomes an important senior atomic energy commissioner. The first act is Oppenheimer’s life traveling and learning about fission, atoms, and getting a teaching job at UC Berkeley where he becomes highly respected for his works. There, he falls for the unhinged Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and starts up a weird friendship.\n\nAct two kicks into high gear as U.S. Army General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) seeks out Oppy for the POTUS’ new Manhattan Project: build a WMD before the Nazis can. With the knowledge and chutzpah, Oppy decides on the vast & open New Mexico area to build a camp and lab for his crew and their families. With threats of growing Communism, trial and error, spies & moles around, and Oppy having problems with his new hardscrabble and caustic wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), they finally build a working A-bomb model to test out. But even after a successful kaboom, Oppenheimer is worried: what if using these bombs leads to building bigger bombs which leads to more WMD’s worldwide? He quickly wants the POTUS and others to realize the real potential for global catastrophe, even though everyone is busy praising his name for Hiroshima & Nakasaki.\n\nAct three is the aftermath (the fallout, if you will) with Oppy being judged for his possible Communist activities while doing his job for Uncle Sam. Was he a Communist sympathizer or a true-blue Patriot? In an extensive closed hearing, Oppy is held accountable for his actions as his entire life’s actions are scrutinized under a microscope, juxtaposed to a wily Strauss who we see trying to be ordained a Senator by a commission. This is one long movie, but Nolan keeps the action moving and never lets up on the ping-pong effect of what era you’re watching. You could be watching Oppy (in color) in New Mexico arguing about atomic vs hydrogen bombs then we’re suddenly in the black & white future where Strauss is talking to his people about Oppenheimer. At first, it gets a little annoying all this “channel surfing” of time zones, but after a while, you settle in and get used to it as it starts to make perfect sense.\n\nNolan doesn’t cheapen his movies, instead, he meticulously crafts them with innovative ideas and exceptional writing. The attention to detail is incredible and just listening to his dialogue is like taking a college class on writing. It flows beautifully and effortlessly. And Cillian Murphy is outstanding! I see an Oscar for his performance here; I’m calling it right now! Blunt is great, as is RDJ as the crafty Senator wannabe. Matt Damon is always a welcome addition, and I really liked David Krumholtz as Oppy’s buddy, Isidor Issac Rabi. Oh, and there are many other stars that pepper this movie that only have small parts, like Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malik, Casey Affleck, Gary Oldman (as the POTUS), Matthew Modine, Daen DeHaan, and many more. While I didn’t think it was “the greatest motion picture ever made” as many critics are calling it, I can see this easily winning the Best Picture Oscar next year. Yeah, it’s that’s good!\n\n**Now showing only in theaters*\n\nFat Man and Little Boy (1969)\n\nNo, this isn’t a movie about Trump & Pence (giggle giggle). Instead, it’s a Hollywoodized version of the making of the two bombs that would eventually be dropped on Hiroshima and Nakasaki with Paul Newman and, in his movie debut, Dwight Schultz from The A-Team andStar Trek: TNG.\n\nIt’s Sept. of 1942 and Col. Leslie Groves (Newman) is ordered by the Pentagon to oversee the Manhattan Project, a top-secret program to build a nuclear bomb before the Germans can. Grove chooses U.C. Berkeley physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Schultz) to head up the project in New Mexico along with another young physicist, Michael Merriman (John Cusack). At this remote New Mexico “camp”, a bunch of brilliant minds are given two years to figure out how to build & successfully test a nuclear bomb. After much debating, they figure out how to do it, now they only need to build it without getting killed. Meanwhile, other stories are being played out, thanks to Merriman’s occasional diary narration. Looks like he’s smitten with nurse Kathleen Robinson (Laura Dern) who’s working with friendly Dr. Richard Schoenfield (John C. McGinley) at the hospital wing.\n\nWhen Oppenheimer isn’t working on the bomb and ignoring his wife, Kitty (Bonnie Bedelia), he’s trying to keep his affair with a pretty young girl (Natasha Richardson) a secret, but the gub’ment knows everything and forces Oppy to break it off. As the bomb gets nearer its completion, disaster strikes as Merriman accidentally gets a lethal dose of radiation. He was concerned (as many are) that making this bomb wasn’t a very good idea to begin with. It seems that a petition is going around condemning the bomb, as it will vaporize thousands of innocents in its wake. Groves (a true-blue racist) doesn’t care about all that as his job is on the line, not to mention he wants all the Japanese dead! Yikes!! Anyway, we finally get to see the New Mexico test go off in the final six minutes of this over-two-hour-long movie. Can you say, “Anti-climatic?”\n\nWritten by Bruce Robinson (The Killing Fields, Jennifer 8) and director Roland Joffe (The Scarlet Letter, The Mission), it takes historical liberties and sidetracks the main plot of Oppenheimer and his drive to make WMD’s, in order to give us dull side stories of Merriman and his girlfriend, Dr. Schoenfield and the cast, Oppy and his girlfriend, and Groves getting heat from his bosses. When the movie switches to the main story of Oppenheimer, his colleagues, and the nerve-racking, hair-pulling, screaming-at-each-other world of bomb-making, it gets interesting again. Sadly, only about half the film deals with this. Joffe has a nice handle on the direction, even though the soundtrack is questionable at times. The only thing about this movie worth looking at is the acting."
