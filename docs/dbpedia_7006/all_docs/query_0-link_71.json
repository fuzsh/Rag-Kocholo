In both of them I talk about how it’s a brilliant biopic, one of the greatest ever made, because it’s not really a biopic at all, but a look at Mozart through the eyes of a man who is a rival (and even much of the that rivalry is fictionalized). It looks, on every level, as good as any film ever made. It runs through three hours (in the Directors Cut, which I recommend watching on Blu Ray) and never drags. What’s more, it basically has the greatest soundtrack ever recorded because what can be better than listening to all of that Mozart, who to my mind is the greatest composer who ever lived. It’s the only time in the decade where the Academy just simply got it right even with two other excellent choices to choose from (A Passage to India, The Killing Fields).\n\nThe Source:\n\nAmadeus by Peter Shaffer (1979)\n\nPeter Shaffer was already well known as a playwright when Amadeus opened in London in late 1979, having written Equus, one of the best plays of the decade (possibly the best) and one which had won him a Tony. This brilliant look at the most brilliant of composers would also win him a Tony and would become the rare adaptation of a Tony winner to also win Best Picture at the Oscars. I wish I could have seen that original London production (Simon Callow as Mozart, Paul Scofield as Salieri) or even better, the original Broadway production (Ian McKellen as Salieri, Tim Curry as Mozart). It takes Salieri and uses him as a cipher for us to understand Mozart and his genius, treating him as a petulant star who is simply brilliant than everyone around him.\n\nThe Adaptation:\n\n“When we started to pick the play apart for the screenplay, Peter’s courage never wavered. We took four months, and turned the play inside out. One of the challenges was to find a satisfying narrative frame for the story. We wound up with the simple conceit of Salieri’s confession, which sets up the dramatic action of the film in flashbacks. … Once we had the structure, everything else fell quickly into place: we made the priest a young man mouthing platitudes, a fellow mediocrity and a musical layman who had never heard of the old composer because Salieri had been forgotten even while he was still alive, another reason for his self-annihilating rage. In screenwriting, it’s the simplicity that usually takes all the sweat.” (Turnaround: A Memoir, Miloš Forman and Jan Novak, p 259)\n\nIf that’s not enough for you, read the 1984 edition of the play (0451128931 – may be a lib binding ISBN), published with the film in full production (it has plenty of stills) in which Shaffer writes a thorough introduction that explains his approach to the film and how he made it different from the play. Anything I could say about the adaptation would be meaningless compared to what Forman says above and what Shaffer says in that introduction.\n\nThe Credits:\n\nDirected by Milos Forman. Original stage play and screenplay by Peter Shaffer.\n\nA Passage to India\n\nThe Film:\n\nA brilliant David Lean film and it just misses out once again taking home Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay like his films did in 1957, 1962 and 1965 because it has the bad luck to run up against Amadeus, a film that is at just about the same level on all three but which I rank every so slightly higher in all three.\n\nI have already reviewed this film not once, but twice. The second time was for my Best Picture project and you can find that review here. The other one is linked below.\n\nThe Source:\n\nA Passage to India by E. M. Forster (1924) / A Passage to India, a play by Santha Rama Rau from the novel by E. M. Forster (1960)\n\nThis is a brilliant novel. I do not rank it as the best of Forster’s works (I have it second to Howards End) but the Modern Library did, ranking it at #24 for the Century. I do list it as #72 of all-time (and to be fair, my list has a lot more to have to work with because I include books from other centuries and languages) and as such, I have already written a full review of the book and the film which you can find here.\n\nThe play, to me, is a good attempt, but flawed. First of all, the book brings such vivid imagery of India to life and the film manages to show it to us while the play is reduced to giving us simply the action of the story. Also, the play, as I mention below, condenses all of the action into just four scenes and I think it loses a lot of its impact that way.\n\nThe Adaptation:\n\n“In the end, Lean did, in fact, crib some material from Rau’s draft so that very probably she was as eligible for a shared screen credit for the Passage screenplay as Carl Foreman was for a shared credit on Kwai. In view of the liberties that Lean had taken with the book, however, Rau ultimately informed Brabourne that she did not wish to be listed as a coauthor and let it go at that. She was not inclined to submit the matter to arbitration. Lean did, however, list her play in the screen credits, along with Forster’s novel, as a source for the screenplay.” (Beyond the Epic: The Life & Films of David Lean, Gene D. Phillips, p 411-412)\n\nI think that is quite ridiculous. There is almost nothing in the play that hadn’t been in the original novel. In fact, there is very little in the film that wasn’t in the original novel. There are a few early scenes that are added on before Mrs. Moore and Adela arrive in India, we get more of Mrs. Moore’s death and a few scenes at the end are altered (Godpole had already left by the time of Mrs. Moore’s death and the arrival of that news is quite different). The ending of the film is far more optimistic than in the novel, but of course the times had changed and there was no need to have such a pessimistic ending because India had achieved independence.\n\nI actually found the play to be considerably disappointing, compressing the events of the novel down to four key scenes, which also means a lot of added exposition to explain things that happen before or after those scenes.\n\nThis is one of the very greatest novel to film adaptations, both in terms of quality of the film, quality of the original source and fidelity to the material.\n\nThe Credits:\n\nDirected and Edited by David Lean. The film is based on the novel by E. M. Forster and the play by Santha Rama Rau. Screenplay: David Lean.\n\nThe Killing Fields\n\nThe Film:\n\nI have already reviewed this film as one of the best films of the year. In fact, in a lot of years this would be the best film of the year but it has the misfortune of being released in 1984 which means it comes in third in almost all of the major categories, stuck behind Amadeus and A Passage to India. There are very few years which can manage a trio of films of this quality. It is, as I have said before, perhaps the greatest film about Vietnam without actually really covering Vietnam and has much to say about the safety of journalists and the way that America conducted itself in international affairs during the 1970s. It also has an ending that, if it does not move you to tears, would make me wonder if you have any emotions left inside you.\n\nThe Source:\n\n“The Death and Life of Dith Pran; a Story of Cambodia” by Sydney Schanberg, New York Times Magazine (Jan. 20, 1980)\n\nThis began as an article written by Sydney Schanberg, the New York Times reporter who is the main character in the film and who was good friends with Dith Pran, the photojournalist that he had to leave behind when the Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia and Schanberg was forced to flee back to the States. After four years of looking for his friend, they were reunited in October of 1979 and this article appeared a few months later, detailing Pran’s journey through Cambodia and his eventual flight to freedom across the killing fields (a phrase that Pran was the first to use). It was then turned into a book, though that came after the release of the film and indeed mentions the film and its impact. There is a later book called The Killing Fields itself, but that is simply a novelization of the film by screenwriter Bruce Robinson (I once owned it thinking it was the source material, though to be honest, back then I used to buy movie novelizations anyway). But, in essence, as mentioned below, the original article (which is not listed as a source in the film itself) is really a side version alongside the screenplay as it was written and isn’t really the source.\n\nThe Adaptation:\n\nProduced David Puttnam had heard the story of Dith Pran and thought it would make a good film. However, “when David met with Schanberg, he learned that the story was already committed to The New York Times Magazine for an article called ‘The Death and Life of Dith Pran.’ David saw the broad canvas in the subject and a larger theme he has long sought.” (Fast Fade: David Puttnam, Columbia Pictures, and the Battle for Hollywood, Andrew Yule , p 126). So, while the story was put to print in the magazine and was eventually turned into a book as well, the screenplay was written by Bruce Robinson using the events as they had happened but not necessarily using Schanberg’s actual article as a source. There is nothing in the film that directly contradicts what was put into print but the article was an article and did not have most of the dialogue that Robinson created. The key line in the film however (“Nothing to forgive”) is simply a shortened version of the actual dialogue between the two that Schanberg reported in his original article (the book includes a photo from the next day and they really got the look of that camp right).\n\nThe Credits:\n\nDirected by Roland Joffè. Screenplay by Bruce Robinson.\n\nnote: There is no credit for the source.\n\nUnder the Volcano\n\nThe Film:\n\nIt’s interesting that John Huston stopped writing his films after 1975 because he continued to make films based on great works of literature and he continued to make them very well. What’s more, the writers who did work with him were one-time writers (the writers of Wise Blood never wrote another film though one of the two brothers produced this film, Gallo never wrote another film, his son Tony, who would write The Dead, hadn’t written a film in 17 years and would never write another). But the scripts were fantastic, finding a word through the narratives to the stories (which was not easy for these stories). This is a film I had seen just a couple of times but I rewatched it before doing my Nighthawk Awards for 1984 and bumped it up significantly, landing it in my Best Picture list in what is a great year for the Top 3 and a significantly weaker year once you get past those Top 3. Still, this is a great film (low level ****) with possibly the best performance Albert Finney ever gave on film (I have to watch the verb tense because as I write this, Finney just died less than a week ago).\n\nThe Source:\n\nUnder the Volcano by Malcolm Lowry (1947)\n\nFor years, this was known as a great unfilmable novel (six different people held options on the book before Huston). I always knew that the film was based on a novel but I didn’t know the esteem in which the book was held until 1998 when the Modern Library published their list and there it was at #11, just behind The Grapes of Wrath and ahead of 1984, I Claudius and To the Lighthouse. What a shock that was to me and it was thus one of the novels that most intrigued me when I set out to complete my own reading of the list over the course of two years following the publication of the list. I initially read a library copy but now own an old Penguin paperback (the edition shown in the image and ironically, not for sale in the US according to the back cover) with an image from Diego Rivera’s Day of the Dead in the City. It’s hard to find a cover of a paperback novel that is more appropriate as this is the story of one drunken man who stumbles his way through the Day of the Dead on his own inevitable journey towards death. It’s a modernist novel, much of it taking place in the man’s mind as he thinks back on things as he drinks his way towards death or else dealing with his wife and his half-brother. I have always enjoyed the novel and I think it’s very good (I did it place in my Top 200 but not in the Top 100) but I have always wondered if it ranked so high precisely because it is such a difficult book to read.\n\nThe Adaptation:\n\nApparently Guy Gallo was able to find a way to adapt the book by focusing on the events of the day itself. By dropping the opening chapter (which takes place a year later) and any of the events in the memories of the characters and just going with the Counsel and his actions and the return of his wife and half-brother and the way all of this leads to his death, he is able to work a masterpiece out of a novel that many had considered to be unfilmable.\n\nThe Credits:\n\nDirected by John Huston. Based Upon The Novel by Malcolm Lowry. Screenplay by Guy Gallo.\n\nA Soldier’s Story\n\nThe Film:\n\nThe same day I recorded A Soldier’s Story on TCM to watch it for this project, it aired A Few Good Men just afterwards. It’s an interesting pair to put together. Both films were nominated for Best Picture and Supporting Actor at the Oscars, both of them involve the death of a soldier and an officer investigating the crime, both of them were adapted from acclaimed plays by the play’s author and neither of them ended up earning a nomination for Best Director, in each case not the first time the director had been overlooked by the Academy. The comparisons end there as watching A Few Good Men again made me realize I had not been giving that film its due while watching A Soldier’s Story again was slightly painful. A Soldier’s Story is well acted but the direction isn’t very strong and what’s more, it has a jazzy kind of score that seems at complete odds with what the film is trying to do and kept taking me out of the action. It’s still a ***.5 film but I can understand a bit more why Roger Ebert only gave it **.5. And, of course, in A Few Good Men we know who did the killing but need to find out why, whereas it becomes obvious early on why the man was killed in this film while the question is who did the killing. And one last thing about this film: I was too young to watch St. Elsewhere so I just have to ask: was there ever a time when Denzel Washington wasn’t clearly intended to be a star? His smoldering intensity in this film threatens to melt the celluloid.\n\nThe Source:\n\nA Soldier’s Play: a play by Charles Fuller (1981)\n\nAn interesting little murder mystery about who killed a self-hating black sergeant in the south during World War II (the black soldiers are anxious to get overseas and start fighting in the war) lead by a black captain from Washington. It’s as much about race relations at the time as it is about solving the mystery. It was a hit off-Broadway and helped kick-start the career of Denzel Washington (he played the same role on stage as he would later on film) a year before St. Elsewhere went on the air.\n\nThe Adaptation:\n\nA mostly straight-forward adaptation of the play though some scenes are opened up and given more time (the original play isn’t broken up into very many scenes, allowing past and present events on stage at the same time and in that way aren’t actually that different from the style that Aaron Sorkin would later use in A Few Good Men). The best change is that in the play, the actual culprit is caught off-stage while in the film, the scene when the culprit is caught and brought in is possibly the best acted scene in the entire film, so I’m glad it was changed.\n\nThe Credits:\n\nDirected by Norman Jewison. Screenplay by Charles Fuller. Based on his play “A Soldier’s Play”.\n\n1984\n\nThe Film:\n\nI have already reviewed this film, years ago, when I wrote about it when writing about the novel (see below). It’s not a great film, perhaps because the subject matter is just too bleak for that to really work that well on screen (though it could have been satire and I do mention in the review the comparison and likely influence on Brazil which was released the next year). But it is miles above the original film version (from 1956), has the last great performance of Richard Burton who died before the film was released, a strong performance from John Hurt and Suzanna Hamilton and some solid direction from a director who would later earn an Oscar nomination for Il Postino. It is a solid film version of a great book. It was honestly a bit depressing to be watching this film in 2019 when it seems every year we end up looking more like Orwell’s bitter vision.\n\nThe Source:\n\n1984 by George Orwell (1949)\n\nHow great a book? One of the greatest ever written. The Modern Library listed it at #13. I listed it at #17 and my list isn’t restricted to the 20th Century or English Language novels (if it was it would be #11). It is one of the most important novels of the 20th Century, one that continues to resonate more every single year, especially as the current administration works harder and harder to try and change what happened in the past and try to control the present by controlling the past.\n\nThe Adaptation:\n\nA first-rate adaptation that sticks very close to the novel at almost every level. Far more faithful to the book than the original film version was.\n\nThe Credits:\n\nWritten and Directed by Michael Radford.\n\nnote: The only listing for the source in the opening credits is the pre-title line of “Michael Radford’s film of George Orwell’s”.\n\nThe Bounty\n\nThe Film:\n\nI have already reviewed this film as my under-rated film of 1984. This film lives in the shadow of the great 1935 version that won Best Picture and the terrible 1962 version that somehow managed to earn a Best Picture nomination. This version doesn’t have the almost swashbuckler feel of the first film and instead vies for a more historical approach. It presents a character study between a perfectionist mentor who can’t abide mistakes or slacking and an introspective young man used to getting positive attention who, after six months of an island paradise, can no longer bear the life he’s pushed back into. This film was completely ignored at the Oscars and by pretty much all the awards groups. But it’s a very good film that is stock full of great actors (Anthony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier, Liam Neeson, Daniel Day-Lewis), many of them not particularly well known at the time. The most fair and historically accurate version of the famous mutiny.\n\nThe Source:\n\nCaptain Bligh and Mr. Christian: The Men and the Mutiny by Richard Hough (1973)\n\nThe latest (at the time) in a long line of books about the famous mutiny which started coming out in 1790 as soon as Bligh got back to England and wrote up his own account. This is a really strong book that focuses on the men themselves, particularly Bligh and Christian and what went wrong between them on what was actually their third voyage together. The final chapter speculates as to what kind of relationship Bligh and Christian had and while I normally dislike that kind of speculation, Hough makes a very good case for why their friendship might have broken down so completely, a lot of it tied up in the psychology of each man which is well developed throughout the book.\n\nThe Adaptation:\n\nI complained a bit in my review of the film that the one weakness was Gibson’s performance (“he seems to have taken the introspection to a new level and it does not make him particularly effective as Fletcher Christian”) but that gets to the heart of the film. Which choice is better? The more decisive Clark Gable performance that makes Christian more apt as a film hero or the more historically accurate performance from Gibson that comes straight from the descriptions in Hough’s book? Either way, they both make for very good films.\n\nHough’s book covers a lot more than the mutiny itself (it discusses Bligh’s excellent work as a navigator on Cook’s voyages and continues the story back on land after the mutineers are returned to England, the trial, the fall of Bligh’s reputation and what happened on Pitcairn until the last of the mutineers there died) but the film uses a framing device of Bligh at his court-martial (likely a deliberate counterpoint to focusing on the court-martial of the fictional Byam in the 1935 film) and his eventual exoneration in that court-martial to show us the actions of the characters. Overall, it’s a very good way to adapt a fascinating and good read into a worthwhile film. This is a time where it’s useful to watch the film and to read the book simply because the book expands on what you are given on film but the film does such a good job dramatizing the events.\n\nThe Credits:\n\nDirected by Roger Donaldson. Screenplay by Robert Bolt. Based upon the book “Captain Bligh and Mr Christian” by Richard Hough.\n\nThe Bostonians\n\nThe Film:\n\nThe tall lawyer from Mississippi, Basil Ransom, is in Boston to see his cousin, Olive Chancellor. They are a study in contrasts, other than their handsomeness. He is the very embodiment of a Southern gentleman in the post-Civil War period, refined, polite, but conservative in his beliefs. She isn’t from the South and she’s part of the growing liberation movement among females, especially those in the Northeast and even more, especially those in Boston. He goes about things leisurely, his slow Southern drawl giving him time to think while she explodes into words, putting all of her passions into play. You would think that because she is played by Vanessa Redgrave (her earned an Oscar nomination for her performance) while he is played by Christopher Reeve that he would be no match for she, but in his quiet polite dignity, he somehow is. Or maybe it’s because society insists that she’s no match for him that somehow they do become equals.\n\nThe two aren’t just cousins, but before long they are rivals as well, though neither would able to admit it. The prize sought between the two of them is Verena Tennant, the charming young woman who is Olive’s protege. Olive wants to make use of Verena’s position (her parents are well suited to help the cause), her fiery passion and her speaking talents to help bring more people to the feminist cause. What Basil wants from her becomes more apparent to both Basil and Verena the more times they meet, complicated by the fact that Verena isn’t quite certain if she wants to take this place in Basil’s life or if she wants to stay with the movement as well as the complication that Olive clearly is in love with Verena and it’s never quite clear how much Verena, Basil or even Olive is aware of this.\n\nThis is the work of Merchant Ivory Productions and while the partnership had been around for over 20 years at this point and they had even adapted a classic novel before (tackling Henry James once earlier with The Europeans in 1979), I think this is really the start of what became thought of in the 80’s as a typical Merchant Ivory film. We have the classic novel (though how classic it is, is, after all, open to interpretation as is obvious below), the great costumes and art direction and the complicated relationships. This film isn’t quite at the same level of their later, great films like A Room with a View, Howards End or The Remains of the Day and the arguments could be made whether it’s the quality of the source, the performances (Redgrave as I said is quite good while Reeve manages to hold his own without a problem but isn’t outstanding and Madeleine Potter doesn’t really do much more than be the pretty one that is sought after and whose film career reflects this) or just that there isn’t enough here to make a better film. But it’s a good film and the first step in the start on the way towards greatness.\n\nThe Source:\n\nThe Bostonians by Henry James (serialized 1885-86, book form, 1886)\n\n“A mind so fine no idea could violate it.” That’s T.S. Eliot on Henry James which if you’ve never read before it means you’ve never read anything I’ve ever written about Henry James on the blog because I mention the quote literally every time I mention Henry James. That’s because I agree with the quote and there is no novel by Henry James in which I more agree with the quote than this one.\n\nThis is James’ novel about the Women’s Liberation movement and it doesn’t have a single worthwhile idea about the movement. It’s all just fodder for a story about a love triangle with a Southern gentleman, a Boston liberated woman and the young, attractive woman that they are both in love with, even if only one of them can admit or even understand it. As always, James has good command of language but he has nothing worthwhile in terms of story or character and the novel is just boring as can be.\n\nIt is perhaps notable that James himself at least somewhat distanced himself from the novel while still alive in that it was the “only one of James’s full-length, mature novels not to appear in the author’s revised, definitive New York Edition of his selected novels and stories” (2003 Modern Library edition, Note on the Text) and thus never received an authoritative text or a James authored preface.\n\nThe Adaptation:\n\nLike they would become so accustomed to doing, the trio of filmmakers (Merchant, Ivory, Jhabvala), would stick to the core of the story and the dialogue in the text, cutting through the narrative and thus retain a faithful adaptation of the original source while managing to make a 400+ page book in the course of just two hours. There are definitely minor characters who fall by the wayside but most of them at least get an appearance in the film even if their actions (as are some other actions in the book) are truncated somewhat to focus on the main three characters and the main story of their love triangle.\n\nThe most significant change comes at the end and I’ll let James Ivory and his interviewer explain it:\n\nLong: In the novel, when Olive Chancellor is forced to go to the podium of the Boston Music Hall in Verena’s place before a jeering crowd, it is the greatest humiliation of her life, practically a martyrdom. In the film, however she proves to be moving and persuasive, and one wonders if she may become a public figure in the women’s movement. Is this what you were implying?\n\nIvory: Yes, in a way. We didn’t want to leave the story on that note – Olive crushed, Verena in tears as she is led away by Ransom. So we let Olive pick up the torch that Verena had dropped. (James Ivory in Conversation: How Merchant Ivory Makes Its Movies, Robert Emmet Long, p 160)\n\nThe Credits:\n\nDirected by James Ivory. Based on the novel by Henry James. Screenplay: Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in America\n\nThe Film:\n\nLots of films have theories spring up about them. My best friend insisted upon leaving Mulholland Drive that it had to make sense and would later embrace some theories about the film devoted to having it make sense (which I don’t buy into). But sometimes theories have some strength behind them, especially when the director acknowledges the theory works quite well. So let’s look at Once Upon a Time in America, a film that has a varied reputation.\n\nThe film has a checkered history. Leone worked on it for years with different ideas for casts and originally thought of it as two three hour films then decided to make one film at a length of 269 minutes, an unheard of length for a feature film. It was released at Cannes and across Europe at 229 minutes but the American production company sliced it down to 139 minutes, which wasn’t the primary problem, but also rearranged the film to put it in chronological order, which greatly altered the narrative flow of the film. The European version got strong reviews and the American version did not. Today, while it is widely regarded as one of the greatest gangster films ever made yet, even though I have only seen the 229 minute version (three times), I only rank it as a high ***.5 and it landed at #58 in my own list of all-time Crime films. I think it is well-directed with a really good performance from Robert De Niro in the center role, a solid one from James Woods in the secondary role, a magnificent score and first-rate costumes and sets. But I feel like the writing lets the film down at times and the film does such a poor job with Elizabeth McGovern as De Niro’s female obsession (I wouldn’t go so far as to call her his love) after doing such a good job with the younger version played by Jennifer Connelly (which has a very bold move with her as she was 12 when she was filmed and the film appears to give us an ass-shot of her which absolutely has to be a body double).\n\nNow, with the writing, we get to the theory behind the film. The film (after a bit of a false narrative start and the world’s most annoying telephone) begins with De Niro’s character, Noodles, hiding out from men trying to kill him in an opium den. From there, the film goes back in time, showing us how Noodles became the cold-blooded killer he is today (using younger actors who are part of the reason the film doesn’t reach **** – Connelly is on a completely different level of acting than any of the other young stars and it’s not hard to see that she would become a complete heartthrob (I can say that since she was 16 and I was 12 when I fell for her when she starred in Labyrinth) and an Oscar winning actress) but also eventually moving forward, showing his relationship to his other gang friends, especially Max, who will fake his death and become a Cabinet member). The film moves in time, ranging from the early 20’s to the late 60’s, giving us Noodles’ entire life in crime. But, at the end, we come back to where we began, with Noodles first entering the opium den.\n\nSo what have we watched? Well, the theory, and I rather like it, is that the whole film is Noodles’ hallucinatory vision of his past (which really happened) and his future (which doesn’t). Leone himself has encouraged this theory and it fits what we have seen on screen. It explains why the film would come around back to where we began and it’s easy to imagine that what will happen is that actually Noodles will be killed just after the movie ends and most of we saw will never happen.\n\nBut part of the reason this theory works is because of the problems with the script. It’s good enough to sneak into my Top 10 and it does show that the 229 version is the best, if for no other reason than that showing the film chronologically ruins the whole flow (and, of course, kills the theory). This is a very strong film and a great film for Leone to go out on (he spent years making it, wouldn’t make another and would die just five years later). But I can’t quite hold it up to the level of the truly great films of the genre.\n\nThe Source:\n\nThe Hoods by Harry Grey (1952)\n\nHarry Grey wasn’t really a writer. He was a Russian-American gangster and he likely wrote the book while incarcerated in Sing-Sing. It does give a portrait of the gangster scene in New York in the late 20’s and early 30’s but it frankly isn’t very good and I can’t imagine why Leone worked so hard to get the rights to the book. It doesn’t actually do much with its characters and is currently only in-print through what is basically a vanity press. I can’t recommend bothering with it.\n\nThe Adaptation:\n\nLeone and his team of screenwriters (and there are a lot of them) are the ones really responsible for what we see on screen. They do far more with the characters than the book does. In fact, the book basically provides the characters of Noodles and Max and almost everything we see on film really comes from the filmmakers.\n\nThe Credits:\n\nDirected by Sergio Leone. Based on the novel The Hoods by Harry Grey. Screenplay by Leonardo Benvenuti, Piero De Bernardi, Enrico Medioli, Franco Arcalli, Franco Ferrini, Sergio Leone.\n\nGreystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes\n\nThe Film:\n\nGreystoke is a fascinating but ultimately disappointing film that shows how things with a vision behind them can go wrong. It is a good film, a mid *** but it had the potential to be so much more than that.\n\nRobert Towne began to make the film when he worked on the script back in the mid 70’s, not long after Chinatown. In fact, his work on the script and not wanting to turn it over to another director is what ended up with him turning towards direction. But delays and problems while making his directorial debut, Personal Best, lead to him selling the rights. Instead, Hugh Hudson was brought in to direct the film, fresh off Chariots of Fire (bringing several cast members with him). But Hudson lacked a vision for the film. He also cast Christopher Lambert (who’s a terrible actor but at least works for the physical role and since Tarzan is new to language, the acting is less of a problem) and Andie McDowell (whose performance was so bad that all of her lines were dubbed by Glenn Close). So now, an idea of going back to the original Burroughs, of making a faithful film that really looked at the distance between civilization and the wilderness was undermined by both the direction and the acting (and Towne was so disgusted by all of it that he removed his name from the film and used his dog’s name as a pseudonym instead – why his dog has such a bizarre name is another story).\n\nBut, again, this isn’t a bad film. With strong performances from both Ian Holm (as the Belgian guide who finds Tarzan and brings him to civilization) and Ralph Richardson (who earned a posthumous Oscar nomination for this, his final film performance, as the aged Lord Greystoke who thought his family line was done when his son was lost at sea), exquisite cinematography and a strong score, the film holds together.\n\nI suppose I could say something about the story, especially if your idea of a Tarzan films comes from the 1930s. A British man (the heir to an earldom) and his wife are stranded when their ship crashes off the shore of Africa. They build a home in the jungle but she dies of malaria and he is killed by a gorilla and a female gorilla adopts their infant son and raises it as her own. Some twenty years later, a Belgian guide finds the now-adult Greystoke heir and after managing to find a way to communicate, brings him back to England and to “civilization”. But Tarzan and civilization aren’t meant for each other and eventually things go bad for him, in spite of the love of young Jane Porter and of his grandfather.\n\nThe film does hearken back to the original Burroughs (see below) and not badly at that. I wish I could have seen Towne’s vision on-screen (as does Towne). And for all of its flaws, this is one of the very best Tarzan films (easily) and quite possibly the best and the only one that is really true to its origins.\n\nThe Source:\n\nTarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs (1914)\n\nEven though I own this book (Burroughs is a good example of a pulp writer I like and I also have his Princess of Mars) it is clearly a long time since I read it because I had it in my head that this film is a fairly faithful adaptation and while it does hearken back to the original much more so than any other Tarzan film, it is still a far cry away from what actually happens in the book.\n\nThis is an interesting book, though very much of its time. It has some rather whacktastic things going on (multiple maroonings in the exact same place on the African coast, Tarzan traveling all the way to Wisconsin to rescue Jane, the bizarre notion that Tarzan could learn to read on his own) and some problematic issues (backwards views on race and heredity) but Burroughs gives us a great adventure story of the man raised as an ape and his return to civilization. If he is nowhere in the same league as Kipling, he deals more with the adventure aspects of the story which is what makes it more of a pulp book.\n\nThe Adaptation:\n\nThe ways in which this returns to the original novel is in Tarzan’s origins (depicted rather faithfully, although they are shipwrecked in the film rather than marooned by mutineers) and his background (being the Greystoke heir) and the character of D’Arnot being the key figure in bringing Tarzan to civilization (in most versions of Tarzan he is completely excised). But in the book, Tarzan doesn’t return to England, he learns to speak French, not English, he meets Jane in Africa and then finds her in the US and he returns to Africa to escape his mourning for passing on claiming Jane and his birthright rather than because he can not take to civilization and its brutality. Still, given all the Tarzan films that had come before this one (44 by my count), this goes back to the original source material far more than any previous version.\n\nThe Credits:\n\nDirected by Hugh Hudson. Based on the story “Tarzan of the Apes” by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Screenplay by P. H. Vazak and Michael Austin.\n\nWGA Nominee\n\nThe Natural\n\nThe Film:\n\nThis was me as a kid: obsessed with baseball. From 1982 to 1988 I spent any money that didn’t go towards Star Wars figures (through 1984) or comic books (post 1984) on baseball cards. At a game on April 8, 1989 (Jim Abbott’s debut), I stunned the two guys sitting behind us by rattling off the starting lineup for every single team in major league baseball. I screamed when the Cardinals lost the World Series in 1985 due to a bad call, put my foot through a door when the Red Sox lost in 1986 on the Buckner play, cursed when the Cardinals lost in 1987 because the Twins had homefield advantage and forever hated Kirk Gibson when he hit the home run in 1988 that broke the A’s as I watched my three favorite teams in baseball lose the World Series four years in a row. And so came The Natural, surely a movie made for me if any movie was, one all about baseball, with a grand moment at the end that every baseball player dreams of. I didn’t like it.\n\nI have still never liked the film. Because my best sports films list wouldn’t even include Hoosiers or The Natural let alone have one at the top does that mean that my list, according to Bill Simmons, shouldn’t count? No. It means that sportswriters should perhaps stick to sports and not try to make judgments on films. What my dislike of the film meant was that even back when I first saw the film, probably in 1986 or so when it would have come to HBO is that I already was beginning to view things in terms of story and quality rather than in emotions. I felt that the film was flawed because it had a star who was supposed to be a kid and then 35 but was clearly much older than that (he was 48). I felt that the story was flawed because it relied too much in bringing everything together in a cliche so that the big moment could win the game. I understand when people get caught up in the moment when the ball flies into the lights and they explode and that magnificent Randy Newman score sends your emotions soaring up towards the heavens with the ball but it doesn’t mean I believe in it. Does that make my cynical? No, it just means I have a critical eye that is looking at more than just that moment.\n\nThe filmmakers wanted to take a novel that was a parable and a satire and make it into a realistic film. They wanted to reduce the satire by giving it a happy ending rather than the truly dark, depressing ending that the book had, increase the malevolence of some characters and decrease the flaws in others while also providing a romantic notion that could help lead towards the ending. That in itself is fine in a film though it makes it a complete betrayal of its original source (see below). But there is also the problem of the novel being, in essence, a parable. The film doesn’t want to answer any of the questions that would come up if you treat the subject realistically. Where has Roy Hobbs been for the last 15 years? He spent 15 years wandering and suddenly is an instant success? How does one outfielder make so much of a difference that he can take a last place team in mid-season and turn them into a champion? Of course, we’re not supposed to take such a realistic view of the film but if you’re going to try and make your film realistic then you have to deal with such questions.\n\nThere are things that are done very well in this film. The costumes and sets look great. The cinematography is quite good. The Randy Newman score, as mentioned, is just about the best work he’s ever done for film even including his two Oscar-winning songs. Glenn Close is solid in a role that is ridiculous. But the two things that were done before the camera even began to role, the casting of Robert Redford, not just as a 35 year old, but also as a teenager, and the script itself, completely undermine the film and what it tries to do. If you want to enjoy the ridiculous moment where the ball not only shatters the light but apparently causes some sort of backlash that shatters every light and in which players run the field with burning shards of glass falling down upon them because the score backs up the moment, then by all means, enjoy it. But don’t think that makes this a great sports movie or even a good movie.\n\nThe Source:\n\nThe Natural by Bernard Malamud (1952)\n\nThe film of The Natural is a study in the mytho-poetics of baseball (see the novel Wonder Boys for that term). The original novel is a deconstruction of the myths that surround the game and takes many of the darkest moments in the history of the game (and some of the brightest) and twist them around in a way that makes it nothing like the American Dream that so many would like it to be.\n\nIs it the best novel by Bernard Malamud? No, that would be The Fixer, the novel that won him the Pulitzer. But as a first novel it was a hell of a solid debut. I resisted reading it for a very long time simply because I had never much liked the film. I wish I had read the book first so that I could have simply been disappointed in the film. The novel in some ways is a baseball fan’s dream, filled with little tidbits of baseball history in some ways crossed with a Grail quest complete with tragic hero who in the end is unable to complete his quest because of his tragic flaw. Malamud makes the season and the team come to life although he is always a bit too vague in describing what happened during Roy Hobbs’ tenure away from the game and what was able to bring him back. But, because the story functions on one level more as allegory than an actual serious fictional narrative, we can allow him this flaw in the book because it brings us to where we need to be.\n\nThe Adaptation:\n\nParts of the novel are kept very true on the screen, including the main aspects of most of the characters. But the film is drawn less in lines of a hero with a tragic flaw that will be his downfall and more in the lines of good versus evil. To that end, we have a Memo who will poison Roy, a judge who is much more involved in getting the games thrown and a Roy who will not only not blow it but will in fact win the big game and also an actual son with the girl he loved when they were both young rather than just the potential of a son with a woman who has suddenly decided on a whim to come and root for him.\n\nThe Credits:\n\nDirected by Barry Levinson. Based on the Novel by Bernard Malamud. Screenplay by Roger Towne and Phil Dusenberry.\n\nBAFTA Nominee\n\nAnother Country\n\nThe Film:\n\nThe Brits don’t seem to be able to get over being betrayed. Or maybe there are more aspects to the men that continue to intrigue them. It’s been more than 60 years since Guy Burgess and Kim Philby defected (long after they had begun spying) and what an artistic legacy we have because of them, from Cambridge Spies to Tinker Tailor to Another Country. The original play wasn’t obvious who it was about but the film has no such subtlety about it. We see Guy Bennett, alone in the Soviet Union as an old man (something Guy Burgess never achieved), explaining his story. Did he betray his country because he believed in the USSR? Or because he didn’t believe in England? Or perhaps because he felt, as a young gay man in a public school, pushed to be a part of society that would never actually accept him and forced to play by rules that he loathed and that made a mockery of his personal values decided to pay them all back.\n\nTwo young men form a connection. They both feel oppressed by the situation they are in, public school boys pushed to follow a model that neither believes in. Guy is gay, though he is trying to keep it hidden. Tommy is a Marxist. The time is England between the wars. That alone would be enough for an interesting film, no matter the play it was based on. But we also get two young actors that had both played a starring role in the play (in fact the same role – Guy and in between them Daniel Day-Lewis played the role). Playing Guy is Rupert Everett, lanky, awkward, in love with the most handsome young man around (another future star – Cary Elwes). The more intriguing role, Tommy, is played by Colin Firth, fighting back with wit and sarcasm against everything that would keep him down. The two of them met while working on the film and Firth’s intensity was so pronounced that the two of them ending up taking an extreme dislike to each other and barely speaking for 25 years (they apparently got along during The Importance of Being Ernest and they are never on-screen together in Shakespeare in Love) before finally making a ridiculous St Trinian’s film together and ending their feud (with a great nod in that film to this one: “We’ve met before. In another life.” “In another country.”).\n\nThe film didn’t do much business in the States (the IMDb doesn’t even list a U.S. release date but the old oscars.org database had it in 1984) perhaps because the public school experience, so common in plays and films in Britain, is much different in the States. Or maybe we’re not as obsessed about why a young gay man in Britain would feel the need to spy for the Soviets just to get back at a class system that is much different in this country. But if nothing else, this is a nice showcase for a number of young actors who would eventually (though certainly not right away) become international stars.\n\nThe Source:\n\nAnother Country by Julian Mitchell (1981)\n\nThis was a hit play when it was first produced in 1981 (with Rupert Everett in the lead in his first starring stage role) and continued to showcase rising young British actors, adding Kenneth Branagh during its run as Tommy, replacing Everett the next year with Daniel Day-Lewis and the year after that replacing Day-Lewis with Colin Firth (it’s too bad they couldn’t have found roles for Branagh and Day-Lewis in the film). It’s a good play but a bit limited and I imagine the real benefit is as a showcase for good young actors but it has continued to be revived through the years in Britain so it clearly strikes much more of a cord there.\n\nThe Adaptation:\n\nThe film opens later (with a framing device from the Soviet Union in the 1980s with Bennett telling his story) and earlier (the character who commits suicide in the film is already dead when the play opens though we don’t learn it until the end of the first scene). Mitchell also changes a number of things in his adaptation of his own play, adding Harcourt as a character (he’s not in the original play) and adding scenes outside the school grounds (the scene with Guy’s mother is only in the film – the original play has no female roles in it at all which perhaps is also a statement on the schools and on Guy and his sexual interests as well).\n\nThe Credits:\n\nDirected by Marek Kanievska. Screenplay by Julian Mitchell. Based on his original play.\n\nOther Screenplays on My List Outside My Top 10\n\n(in descending order of how I rank the script)\n\nThis is Spinal Tap – Technically should count as adapted because they had already created the characters but the the old oscars.org didn’t list it as such and it’s so brilliantly original, I’m leaving it in original. So this is really a footnote, not because it belongs here. Besides, it’s my Original Screenplay winner and if I move it, it takes a Top 5 Adapted that’s at 33 and moves it to 37 while taking an Original Top 5 that’s only at 26 and drops it to 21. It’s already the weakest Top 5 post-1978 – that change would make it the weakest post-1970 although it would make the Adapted Screenplay Top 5 the strongest between 1951 and 1989. Would be #4 if I placed it in Adapted and it’s a mid ****.\n\nL’Argent – The old oscars.org didn’t actually count this as adapted (it’s very loosely inspired by the Tolstoy novella The Forged Coupon) so I’m not either. Again, really just a footnote. It’s a low ***.5 and would be #8 in Adapted if I placed it there\n\nAll of Me – This film does actually belong here. It’s a high *** but the script is strong. Based on an unpublished novel called Me Two.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom – Mid ***.5 prequel to Raiders counts as adapted because of the character of Indiana Jones. Read my full review here.\n\nOther Adaptations\n\n(in descending order of how good the film is)\n\nStar Trek III: The Search for Spock – Reviewed in full here because it’s a Star Trek film.\n\nBirdy – Alan Parker adapts William Wharton’s novel with solid results and a good soundtrack from Peter Gabriel. It doesn’t rank on my Score list for the year because most of the music is actually just reworked music from previous Gabriel songs.\n\nCarmen – Francesco Rosi takes on the Bizet opera, one of several adaptations in 1983-84.\n\nThe Ballad of Narayama – A solid *** adaptation of the book by Shichirō Fukazawa and a remake of the 1959 film.\n\nMy Memories of Old Beijing – China’s Oscar submission for Best Foreign Film from 1983. Solid Drama based on the novel by Lin Halyin.\n\nRickshaw Boy – Chinese Drama from 1982 based on the novel by Lao She.\n\nZappa – The Danish Foreign Film submission from 1983 based on the novel by Bjarne Reuter.\n\nThe Terminator – Should this count? The Academy didn’t count it but at the time it didn’t acknowledge ripping off Harlan Ellison’s “Soldier from Tomorrow” (a short story and Outer Limits episode) though current prints do. You can decide for yourself (an issue of The Incredible Hulk would also rip off the episode much more blatantly and Marvel acknowledged it).\n\nCal – Helen Mirren won Best Actress at Cannes for this Irish Drama based on the novel by Bernard MacLaverty.\n\nConfidentially Yours – The last Truffaut film, sadly. Based on the novel The Long Saturday Night by Charles Williams.\n\nSecret Honor – One man Robert Altman film with Philip Baker Hall playing Nixon. Based on the play.\n\nErendira – Because characters from the story originated in 100 Years of Solitude, this is adapted even accounting for the fact that Gabriel Garcia Marquez wrote the script before he wrote the story even though the story was published in 1972 and the film wouldn’t be made until 1983. Proof that a GGM adaptation can actually work. Obviously I’ve seen it in the even years since the GGM post. This was the Mexican Oscar submission for 1983.\n\nThe Muppets Take Manhattan – Better than Caper because it doesn’t overwhelm you with Piggy and it has much better songs but still not nearly as good as The Muppet Movie. The last muppet feature film before Jim Henson’s death. Adapted only in that the characters already existed. It would inspire the animated Muppet Babies show which ran for several years and was recently revived. Look for a pre-TNG Gates McFadden as Dabney Coleman’s secretary.\n\nLe Bal – The French submission for Best Foreign Film in 1983, a Musical from Ettore Scola. The old oscars.org listed it as adapted but it doesn’t really seem to be.\n\nA Love in Germany – Acclaimed Polish director adapts the novel by Rolf Hochhuth.\n\nOne Deadly Summer – This French Mystery, based on the novel by Sebastien Japrisot was one of the biggest French films of 1983.\n\nAnother Time, Another Place – Directed by future Oscar nominee Michael Radford (who’s 1984 is above) and based on a novel by Jessie Kesson, this film always makes me think of the U2 song. I can’t even think of the title without hearing Bono singing the words.\n\nLe Crabe-Tambour – A big film in France from 1977 from director Pierre Schoendoerffer who was adapting his own novel.\n\nThe NeverEnding Story – This gets me down to low ***. I’ll avoid any jokes concerning the title. The first English language film from Wolfgang Petersen and starring Noah Hathaway (Boxey from Battlestar Galactica), it’s an adaptation of the acclaimed children’s fantasy novel (well, actually, only the first half of the book). Ironically, the novel was written in German so perhaps Petersen already knew it? Perhaps I would feel more warm towards it had I seen it as a kid.\n\nVassa – The Soviet Oscar submission from 1983, based on the Gorky play.\n\nCloak & Dagger – Now this I did see as a kid – several times in fact. Was it because I somehow connected to Henry Thomas? (In September of 1983 our family visited Universal Studios and I got to play Eliot on the bike). Because it stars Dabney Coleman who I have never liked and I can’t understand why I saw it so much. I considered at one point doing it as an RCM but I just had no desire to sit through the whole thing again. A very loose adaptation of the same Cornel Woolrich story that was adapted into The Window which I wrote about here.\n\nNights and Days – Originally aired on Polish television which should have made it ineligible for the Oscars but they nominated it for Best Foreign Film anyway in 1976. Based on the novel by Maria Dabrowska.\n\nSwann in Love – A German director (Volker Schlondörff) adapts a French novel (the first volume of Proust) with a British star (Jeremy Irons) and a Swedish cinematographer (Sven Nykvist). The results are less interesting than you would think.\n\nThe Grass is Singing – A bit of a bland adaptation of Doris Lessing’s novel.\n\nLove Streams – John Cassavetes adapts the play by Ted Allan.\n\nAke and His World – Swedish submission for Best Foreign Film based on the novel by Bertil Malmberg.\n\nPessi and Illusia – The Finnish submission for Best Foreign Film based on the novel by Yrjö Kokko.\n\nMass Appeal – Jack Lemmon as a priest deals with a young, liberal-minded new deacon assigned to him in this adaptation of the play by Bill C. Davis.\n\nChampions – Based on a non-fiction book, it stars John Hurt but it stars him as a jockey and the film is just meh.\n\nSugar Cane Alley – French film based on the novel by Joseph Zobel.\n\nDune – David Lynch took on the task of adapting the novel rather than be subject to Lucas’ whims directing Return of the Jedi. It’s got moments but it doesn’t really work overall which is why it’s here at a high **.5. The novel is a Sci-Fi classic. The remake by Denis Villeneuve will be released next year and given that he’s made two of the best and most fascinating Sci-Fi films of the last several years, it’s something to look forward to.\n\nCrackers – Louis Malle’s remake of Big Deal on Madonna Street is one of his weaker films.\n\nUrusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer – The second film in the series which had been adapted from the original manga series.\n\nPhar Lap – If you don’t know, Phar Lap is a horse, which means I don’t care. Based on the non-fiction book by Michael Wilkinson.\n\nThe Family Game – A 1983 Japanese film based on the novel by Yohei Honma.\n\nLas Bicicletas son para el verano – Film version of the play by Fernando Fernán Gómez.\n\nThe Pope of Greenwich Village – Geraldine Page earned yet another Oscar nomination for this film (the weakest of all of them) setting her up to finally win the next year. Based on the novel by Vincent Patrick.\n\nFirst Name: Carmen – Godard does Bizet. Sort of.\n\n2010: The Year we Make Contact – If you didn’t like 2001, you’ll find this sequel quite boring. If you did like 2001, you’ll still probably find this quite boring. We’ve dropped to mid **.5.\n\nThe Woman in Red – Gene Wilder remakes Pardon Mon Affaire. What’s worse, this is the film that Stevie Wonder won the Oscar for, for “I Just Called to Say I Love You” (go to the mall!).\n\nCareful, He Might Hear You – Australian Drama based on the novel by Sumner Locke Elliott.\n\nUnfaithfully Yours – The original Preston Sturges film was not one of his best efforts but to remake it with Dudley Moore? No thank you. Down to low **.5.\n\nThe Razor’s Edge – Bill Murray tries to go serious in this adaptation of the Maugham novel (and remake of the Oscar winning film from 1946)\n\nThe Black Cat – A 1981 Italian film, this is a loose adaptation of the Poe story.\n\nAgainst All Odds – Another remake, this one of the classic Out of the Past (with Jane Greer even putting in an appearance), at least this one has a great song to go with it, the one that should have won the Oscar.\n\nThe Return of Godzilla – Now we’ve hit the ** films. This is actually the film that was re-edited and released the next year in the States as Godzilla 1985 but like the first Godzilla film, the versions are different enough that I actually list them separately. Not good but still much better than the American version. Adapted only in that it has Godzilla. The start of the Heisei series of Godzilla films which would last a decade.\n\nEureka – Like many Nicolas Roeg films, not as good as you would think. Based on the non-fiction book Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes, though quite loosely.\n\nGlissando – The Romanian submission for Best Foreign Film from 1982, based on the novel by Cezar Petrescu.\n\nFirestarter – This is a much worse year for Stephen King adaptations than the year before with this the better of the two. We’re down to mid **. To be fair, the book, while immensely popular, wasn’t all that good either.\n\nThe Little Drummer Girl – I can’t speak to the quality of the original novel because my le Carré reading only goes through the works I have found in old mass market paperbacks but the film version with Diane Keaton directed by former Oscar winner George Roy Hill isn’t very good.\n\nRazorback – Australian Horror film based on the novel by Peter Brennan.\n\nOxford Blues – A remake of A Yank at Oxford with Rob Lowe.\n\nMissing in Action – The old oscars.org listed it as adapted presumably because it’s supposedly ripped off from James Cameron’s story treatment for Rambo (which wouldn’t get made until the next year) so Cameron can get ripped off as well.\n\nThe Hotel New Hampshire – One of my favorite John Irving books had a humor about it that wasn’t designed for films. This is directed by another former Oscar winner (Tony Richardson). Jodie Foster is sexy but the film just can’t capture the book’s whimsy and shouldn’t have tried.\n\nThe 4th Man – Paul Verhoeven’s final Dutch film before going to Hollywood for 20 years won several awards but actually is pretty bad. Based on the novel by Gerard Reve.\n\nOh God! You Devil – I wasn’t able to see the second film but this third one is bad enough with George Burns returning as God and the Devil.\n\nBest Defense – Willard Huyck’s third film brings together Dudley Moore and Eddie Murphy and it’s just awful (mid *.5). His fourth one (Howard the Duck) will be even worse and his directing career will be over. Based on the novel by Robert Grossbach.\n\nJoy of Sex – Technically an adaptation of the popular sex manual. This is a National Lampoon film that forgot to be funny or sexy.\n\nThe Lonely Guy – A Bruce Jay Friedman humor book (The Lonely Guy’s Guide to Life) becomes an unfunny Comedy with Steve Martin directed by Arthur Hiller.\n\nChildren of the Corn – The original Stephen King story (from Night Shift) is creepily effective. The film is terrible, yet much better than any of the sequels to come.\n\nThe Evil That Men Do – Oh, joy. Let’s descend into the utter shit that was the end of the career of director J. Lee Thompson and star Charles Bronson (thankfully not all adapted so not all covered in this project). This shitty (*) Action film is based on a novel by R. Lance Hill.\n\nWhere the Boys Are – Also titled Where the Boys Are ’84, it’s a remake of the original 1960 film but with no joy in it.\n\nCannonball Run II – The original film is a guilty pleasure, heavy on the guilty but this one is just a mess.\n\nBlame It on Rio – The last feature film from Stanley Donen (though he would live until two months ago) is a terrible Rom-Com with Michael Caine that’s a remake of the French film In a Wild Moment.\n\nConan the Destroyer – I love the original stories. There is a lot to recommend the first film. But this sequel, which adds Grace Jones and Wilt Chamberlain to the cast, is just awful.\n\nSupergirl – I thought at one point about doing this as an RCM but decided since I literally couldn’t remember anything about the film it didn’t belong in that series. I did just rewatch it for the first time since I was a kid to be certain it was as bad as I thought. If anything, it was worse. Helen Slater was decently cast but Faye Dunaway was way over the top and the story was just awful.\n\nSlapstick of Another Kind – If Hotel New Hampshire wasn’t meant to be adapted that’s nothing on Vonnegut. This version of his novel Slapstick is just awful.\n\nSheena – Also known as Sheena: Queen of the Jungle, this adaptation of the 30’s comic strip character brings us down to the .5 films. My thought is less who thought Tanya Roberts should be an Adventure film star and more who watched this film and thought she should be the next Bond girl?\n\nCheech and Chong’s The Corsican Brothers – Cheech and Chong decide to tackle a Dumas novel. Seriously. Well, not seriously in that sense, but not funny either.\n\nFriday the 13th: The Final Chapter – The fourth in the series is also a vicious lie. It’ll be back next year with New Beginning.\n\nAdaptations of Notable Works I Haven’t Seen"
