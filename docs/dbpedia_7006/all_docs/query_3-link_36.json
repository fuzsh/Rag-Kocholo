        "text": "“There’s a guy who wants to do a biography of me, and I can’t think of anything worse than raking through all those miserable years and having them in print, even if it’s done right.” – Bruce Robinson – director, writer, and actor\n\nQ: How many studio executives does it take to change a lightbulb?\n\nA: Does it have to be a lightbulb?\n\n– Popular Hollywood cliché that Robinson described as a truthful cliché\n\nAs editor Alistair Owen writes in the Smoking In Bed introduction, “This is not a biography. It is an edited transcript of roughly thirty hours of interviews, complete with the inevitable omissions, repetitions, contradictions and highly subjective opinions . . . .” Bruce Robinson covers the ups and downs of his career as a writer, director, and actor. He started his film career as an actor, portraying Benvolio in Franco Zeffirelli’s Romeo and Juliet. We follow Robinson’s trajectory from actor to writer (he wrote The Killing Fields, for example) to writer/director (he wrote and directed Withnail & I, which would become a modern classic) to the 1992 disaster that was Jennifer 8 (Robinson’s last directing credit, at least until the long-delayed adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson’s The Rum Diary gets released, hopefully this year). In the years that followed Jennifer 8, Robinson wrote some scripts for money, wrote a biographical novel (The Peculiar Memories of Thomas Penman), co-authored a children’s book with his wife Sophie Windham, and smoked, drank and read a lot. And it is all very entertaining as relayed in the conversations between Robinson and Owen. Writers will find the book especially entertaining, as Robinson spends a lot of the book discussing the writing process and his wrangling with not only the studios, producers, actors, and directors but also himself. Below you will find some highlights from Smoking in Bed that focus on one of my Netflix Instant selections: Withnail & I.\n\nWhen [David] Puttnam asked me to do The Killing Fields the studio did not want an unknown, untried writer on a big project like that. They didn’t want me. They wanted William Goldman, or somebody. I shall be eternally grateful to Puttnam for holding out for me and saying, “No, I think this bloke can do it.” But had he not, had he acquiesced to the studio, I may never have had anything done even now . . . Without The Killing Fields, naturally I’d never have got a shot at Withnail. (pg 30-31)\n\nThe two most potent characters that I’ve ever heard as a writer, one was Withnail – he was just going in my head like Tchaikovsky: “Take this music out of my brain” – and one was Robert Oppenheimer, talking all day at me. And Groves. I could hear him clear as day. (pg 92 – Oppenheimer and General Groves were the main characters of the Robinson scripted Fat Man and Little Boy)\n\nThey [Robinson’s roommates] filtered away through 1968 and into 1969, until there was just Viv and I left, which was the genesis of Withnail, this intense two years that he and I spent together. (pg 99)\n\nWithnail is basically me and Viv, an amalgamation of the two, but I didn’t sit there with a tape recorder and a notepad writing down what Viv said. I just took his acidity, his pompous cowardice, and his very pungent sense of humor, and wrote the character. (pg 104)\n\nSo if my memory is right and the book was written in the winter of 1969/70 – and I’ve got to think that’s right – it was seventeen years later that it got made into a film. That’s what’s so bizarre about it: it’s thirty-one years old and it’s still playing. By accident rather than design it has a timeless quality that all writers love to have built into their work. (pg 107)\n\nWhen you’re directing a film you’ve got 75 to 150 people standing around you . . . As a writer you’re totally on your own. There’s you, the ashtray and a piece of paper. (pg 115)\n\nWhat is the point of Withnail? It’s not a political film, it’s a film to get people laughing for a hundred-plus minutes. That’s all I care about. (pg 123)\n\nWithnail and Penman are the only things I feel I’ve totally controlled as an artist, and I’m happy with those because they’re mine. I really believe that’s my stuff. (pg 228)\n\nAnd a few Hunter S. Thompson-esque previews in anticipation of The Rum Diary…\n\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas I liked very much when I first read it. It’s very dated now. Withnail does have elements of Fear and Loathing; it’s not dissimilar. Two blokes taking off to go somewhere and then coming back. That’s the plot of his book and that’s the plot of mine. (pg 132)\n\nOn the Ralph Steadman drawing for the Withnail & I poster…\n\nIt’s a brilliant picture. The brilliance of the picture, to me, is the Marwood character, who’s just standing there knowing that it’s pointless even moving . . . He’s magnificent, Ralph, in the inventive league of Goya and J.J. Grandville. Some people are confused by his drawing, but I happen to think he’s a genius. He totally captured that sense of what it was like in Albert Street in 1968: moaning and spewing and standing.
