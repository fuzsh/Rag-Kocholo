Douglas...\n\n...has ruled against an appeal\n\nby the Administration...\n\n...for a stay of the injunction...\n\n...on further U.S. Bombing\n\nmissions in Cambodia.\n\nCongress has already ruled\n\nthese bombings illegal...\n\n...and they should cease in one\n\nweek's time on August the 15th.\n\nLet's go, Sarun!\n\nTo the hospital!\n\nInformation. Information.\n\nAir Cambodia regret delays of arrival\n\nof flight number 125...\n\n...from Bangkok because\n\nof bad weather.\n\nMister, you want taxi?\n\nMister, you want taxi?\n\nGood taxi.\n\nShut the f***ing blinds, will you?\n\nWhat's all this sh*t?\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI thought you were the houseboy.\n\nI was developing some film.\n\nIf you're gonna yell, I'll come back.\n\nI'm not feeling good.\n\nDon't want to yell.\n\nI want to be in a good mood.\n\nThe plane was late, no car.\n\nI had to take a taxi here.\n\nAll I want to do is work.\n\nI got you.\n\nWhat the f*** is that on your head?\n\nIt's a sanitary napkin.\n\nI had it soaked in ice.\n\nSyd Schanberg.\n\nIs Pran there?\n\nNo, I just came from the airport.\n\nWell, if he comes in,\n\nwould you tell him I'm here?\n\nI'll be at the Caf Central, tell him.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nWhat do you want to eat?\n\nWant some eggs?\n\nI can't. Somebody told me they faint\n\nwith fright when you cook them.\n\n- What do you want to eat?\n\n- What are you having?\n\nI'm having a caf complet.\n\nI'll have that. And some aspirin.\n\nAnything I eat has got to be\n\nabsolutely dead.\n\nThat's why I can never eat an oyster.\n\nI read somewhere that they put...\n\n...that lemon juice on them\n\njust to stun them. You know?\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nAn unconscious oyster's just as\n\nhorrible as the f***er wide awake...\n\n- My God! Look at this.\n\n- Did you see that?\n\nWhat was it? A rocket?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI saw a guy on a motorbike.\n\nI've been looking for you.\n\nI left a message for you.\n\nI didn't get it.
