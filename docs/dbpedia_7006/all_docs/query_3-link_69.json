        "meta_description": "Jack the Ripper is one of history's most notorious serial-killers - murdering five London prostitutes over 10 weeks in 1888. But who exactly was he? It's a mystery that has repelled, fascinated and intrigued for over a century. Renowned UK filmmaker Bruce Robinson has written a radical re-interpretation of the enthralling hunt for the Ripper called They All Love Jack: Busting the Ripper.\n\nDelving into the cesspools of late-Victorian society, a bloody swirl of highly-placed villains, hypocrites and institutionalised corruption, Robinson has revealed a prime candidate as Jack the Ripper.",

Thompson's \"Rum Diary\" starring Johnny Depp. However, Robinson's obsession for the past 10 to 15 years has been Jack the Ripper and he's just released a ripping yarn called \"They All Love Jack: Busting the Ripper\"."
