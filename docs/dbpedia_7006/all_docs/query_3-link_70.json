        "text": "The Great Scene last Friday was from one of my favorite comedies Withnail and I (1987). Unfortunately I only had a transcript of the scene to post. But once again a GITS reader — in this case Danny Parsons — came to the rescue:\n\nHi Scott,\n\nAttached, as promised, is the scene from ‘Withnail’ as it appears in the published version of the script (except for the formatting, which is — irritatingly — rendered in a style more like that of a stage-play).\n\nAnd here’s a quote from Robinson that pretty much sums up why I thought the scene was worth typing up for GITS readers, to replace the online transcript you found:\n\n“For good or ill, I write scripts in a different way to most people. I take as much trouble over the descriptive side of them as I take over the dialogue side. If the script is a comedy I want you to be laughing through the stage directions as well […] In screenwriting at its worst you’ll see stage directions like ‘Alice walks into medium close-up. Bobby looks up, peeling an apple’, followed by interminable drivel and the much-needed advice from the writer, ‘This is a funny scene’.”\n\nHere’s another one I liked (BR at his acerbic best!):\n\n“There are certain inviolate rules of screenwriting, and it might be an interesting book to put together. Not all this character curve horseshit. There is no such thing as a character curve. There is a character and there is a curve; I don’t know where they join each other. A guy starts the film hating blacks and by the end he’s shagging a black girl; there’s his character curve. Well, thank you very much. Have I really spent all my adult life learning that?”\n\nBoth quotes are taken from (the highly recommended) ‘Smoking in Bed; Conversations with Bruce Robinson’, a book-length interview conducted by Alistair Owen. (Perhaps you could post the second quote as a new entry, in order to ‘bump’ the updated Withnail post.)\n\nYes, you read that right: Danny was kind enough to type up the scene from a hard-copy of the script and email it to me. For that, Mr. Parsons, you get a quadruple hat-tip!\n\nH/T, H/T, H/T, H/T!\n\nAs soon as I started to read the script pages, I knew I was going to use it as this week’s Scene Description Spotlight for three reasons: (1) It gives me a chance to acknowledge Danny’s efforts. (2) I get to pimp one of my favorite comedies yet again (if you haven’t seen Withnail, you really should). (3) The screenwriter Bruce Robinson does a great job with his Narrative Voice.\n\nTo focus on the attitude of Robinson’s narrative voice, here is the same scene from last week, only just the scene description!\n\nINT. BATHROOM — APARTMENT — DAY\n\nThis bathroom is a psychological deterrent to cleanliness.\n\nIt is unclean. At some time in the past somebody has had\n\nan epileptic fit in here with a can of fluorescent paint. There\n\nis wet rot ad dry rot. Evil-looking pustules are breaking\n\nthrough. A poster of Laurence Olivier as Othello clings to\n\none of the walls.\n\nThe room is very small. A lavatory at one end. A bath at\n\nthe other. The type you sit up in like a huge enamel\n\narmchair. MARWOOD is sitting up in it. Pocked and shocked\n\nand attempting to shave. He wears a Shetland jumper rolled\n\nup to just under the armpits. This obviously affords\n\nprotection against the cold. A mirror is propped up behind\n\nthe taps. His reflection appear in it.\n\nHe rinses the razor and shivers. WITHNAIL bursts in wearing\n\nhis overcoat.\n\nHe clutches a couple of doses of fish and chips.\n\nHe thrusts a greasy parcel of newspaper across.\n\nMarwood begins unwrapping it. Withnail lowers the toilet\n\nseat and sits to eat.\n\nMarwood seems concerned at the news. Produces an orange\n\nsausage.\n\nWithnail stands. Pitches his fish and chips into the kazi and\n\nflushes it.\n\nHe storms out muttering curses. Principally ‘They will\n\nfucking suffer.’ Marwood lowers his chips. His eyes slip\n\nfocus into the mirror.\n\nFocus continues to slip. Another face waits at the end of\n\nit.\n\nINT. KITCHEN — APARTMENT — DAY\n\nDANNY is a man who kept the News of the World in business all\n\nthrough the 1960s. And at the end of them put Oz out of it.\n\nHe has dedicated his adult life to drugs. And it shows. He\n\nis a wreck. About sixty except he’s twenty-six.\n\nA jade streak in his hair and night-black shades. Get down,\n\npunks. This man is before you were born.\n\nMarwood walks in wrapped in a towel. Danny’s voice is\n\ncultured Cockney. Monotoned. And brain-bummed.\n\nMarwood shakes his head. Fills the kettle and gives it the\n\ngas.\n\nThe item is handed across. Danny examines it as though it\n\nwere some kind of deal. Gives it a sniffing and decides he\n\nlikes it.\n\nDanny returns to the living room to put it in his bag.\n\nWithnail hobbles in re-togged in a tweed suit. It’s old but\n\nhas quality. Possibly came from a will. Danny looks across\n\nwith curiosity.\n\nOne of Withnails’ boots is on the table. Matchsticks\n\nseparate the soles from the uppers. A cobbling operations is\n\nin progress.\n\nHe slumps on the sofa. Withnail carefully adjust a paisley\n\ntie.\n\nDanny conducts an audit of the ashtray. Finds a suitable\n\nbutt.\n\nWithnail puts his boot on and stands on it to secure\n\nadhesion.\n\nHalf an inch of Gauloise is lit. Withnail pipes ‘Make us a\n\ncup.’\n\nThe Gauloise produces a single cough before it takes a\n\nstubbing.\n\nMarwood comes in with a couple of cups. Hands one to\n\nWithnail.\n\nWithnail gestures to a small, pink child’s hot-water bottle\n\non the sofa. It’s connected to straps and sprouts a yard of\n\nplastic pipe.\n\nMarwood glances at the contraption and starts assembling\n\nclothes.\n\nNobody pays it any attention. Withnail decreases the\n\npressure.\n\nWithnail gives his boot a test run. Makes a couple of\n\njourneys to the kitchen and back.\n\nWithnail disguises glue with polish. Marwood gets into a\n\nshirt.\n\nNo he hasn’t. Marwood focuses into a mirror. Also wearing\n\na tie.\n\nThis is dangerous talk. Marwood is beginning to look\n\nconcerned.\n\nThere is a very long pause. The apothecary rolls a tongue\n\nover his contaminated teeth. Takes his glasses off and\n\nsomehow manages to lower an eye in his head. He may be\n\nsmiling. If Fritz Lang were alive he’d be a star.\n\nThere’s a confrontation coming. Marwood moves in to defuse\n\nit.\n\nWithnail watches with a supercilious leer as Danny empties\n\none of his shopping bags. Horrible things in it. Food\n\nremains. Dead flowers. A bottle of nail varnish. And a\n\nrubber doll. Perhaps the prototype? He holds it menacingly\n\nat Withnail.\n\nWithnail sniggers at it. Enrages its owner. Its bald and\n\nugly head is torn off and its guts emptied on to the\n\ntable. Two dozen coloured spansules. A dozen soiled and\n\nassorted pills. Danny sifts through isolating a tiny pink\n\ntablet. He looks up at Withnail as though this item prevents\n\nall further argument.\n\nWithnail reaches for it. A khaki finger detains it where it\n\nis.\n\nHe gathers his equipment and stands. Slings a pelt around\n\nhim.\n\nGranted this is a little, independent British comedy from 23 years ago, so there are certain things Robinson does that don’t necessarily translate into current styles common in Hwood scripts. But three things strike me:\n\n* Robinson’s narrative voice, this story’s invisible character, is quite chummy with these guys. He’s a pal. He knows them well. He knows their culture. He knows their world. That is reflected in the jargon he uses — “Get down, punks” — and the intimacy with which he describes what’s going on here.\n\n* That chumminess is also reflected in the little character bio he provides for Danny:\n\nDANNY is a man who kept the News of the World in business all\n\nthrough the 1960s. And at the end of them put Oz out of it.\n\nHe has dedicated his adult life to drugs. And it shows. He\n\nis a wreck. About sixty except he’s twenty-six.\n\nIn four lines, the narrative voice conveys the essence of who Danny is, clearly ‘spoken’ by a character who knows Danny well. Perhaps too well.\n\n* The narrative voice is funny. Not in an over-the-top or slapstick way. Again, this NV is from this world, so his sense of humor slots perfectly well with these three disparate, inane characters. And he sets the tone right there in the very first paragraph of the scene:\n\nThis bathroom is a psychological deterrent to cleanliness.\n\nIt is unclean. At some time in the past somebody has had\n\nan epileptic fit in here with a can of fluorescent paint. There\n\nis wet rot ad dry rot. Evil-looking pustules are breaking\n\nthrough. A poster of Laurence Olivier as Othello clings to\n\none of the walls."
