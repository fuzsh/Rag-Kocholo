        "text": "⭐️⭐️⭐️½\n\n52-week film challenge, film 43\n\nIt’s an intriguing and wryly funny film written and directed by Bruce Robinson, based loosely on Robinson’s own life in Camden Town in the late 1960s. It centers around two currently-unemployed actors (Richard Grant as Withnail, and McGann as “I”, who is named “Marwood” in the script but is based on Robinson himself).\n\nAs we meet them, they are busy cross-feeding each other’s worst traits: Withnail is prone to abusing drink and drugs, Marwood is prone to bouts of paranoia. They live in a filthy flat and wait for the phone to ring, living off unemployment compensation and indulging their vices.\n\nOn a particularly going-spare sort of day, Marwood convinces Withnail to call up his eccentric Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths) and ask for the use of Monty’s country cottage in Penrith in the Lake District for a recuperative getaway. Let’s just say things don’t go quite as planned for Withnail, Marwood, or Monty.\n\nThe film has gained a cult reputation for its realistic look at the late 60s from a particular angle, and also because of a gay subplot that never really gets fully resolved (by design). It’s a very black comedy, but there are some very serious moments as well.\n\nGrant’s flamboyantly seething performance as Withnail is meant to be the star of the film, but McGann’s Marwood is a good foil, alternating between hopeful optimism and dark paranoia, the latter of which gets encouraged by various incidents. Both men seem unprepared for coping with the real world, let alone rural England, and each is dependent on the other to try.\n\nThe film effectively shows the two leads in rapid descent in Act One, but Act Two is where the movie picks up steam, as the pair leave the flat, encounter the rural locals, and don’t get on too well with them. Luckily, Monty arrives by surprise (a great excuse for Marwood’s paranoia to fall into a near-breakdown), but his presence brings both relief (he brought supplies!) and tension (he had a reason for coming) that fuels the third act.\n\nWithout giving too much away, there’s a comedic return to London and then some good fortune comes Marwood’s way — an acting job in Manchester — and thus the team has to split up. What becomes of the alcoholic Withnail is left open, but it doesn’t look like it will be anything good.\n\nThis is a movie that could only be made based on true-life adventures of the writer-director, because no scriptwriter would have planned for this level of emotional complexity — or, for that matter, this much colloquial English and plot-moving voiceovers — in a mainstream film. Indeed, a lot of the time the story seems like it would have made a good play, given how dialog-driven it is.*\n\n*and as I was writing this review, I discovered that it has indeed finally been turned into a play which will premiere in Birmingham in May of 2024. Called it!\n\nAll of the main characters are based on real-life people, with “Withnail” being based on a friend and housemate of Robinson’s who was indeed alcoholic. “Uncle Monty” is based loosely on Franco Zeffirelli, with whom Robinson worked as Benvolio in the 1968 film Romeo and Juliet.\n\nThe film turns really dark late in the second act, and then (thankfully) lightens up and brings back the comedy. When the the lads make it back home, they find their drug dealer (Ralph Brown) and friend (who is called “Presuming Ed,” played by Eddie Tagoe) squatting in their flat, waiting for them to return.\n\nProducer Paul Heller was able to raise some of the money needed for the film, but turned to Handmade Films (George Harrison’s company) to secure the rest of the funding. Richard Starkey (Ringo) gets a special thanks in the credits, but with no explanation as to why.\n\nThis film, once viewed, certainly stays with you, as there really is nothing much like it. I am still thinking about McGann’s superb performance in a long scene where Marwood must talk his way out of a challenging situation, and spins a tale that might well be more true in some ways more than he actually realizes himself.\n\nIt’s a film you will remember, fondly or not, since the truth of it rings through — even though Robinson compressed events from across two or three years into two of three weeks in the screenplay. It truly could only have been made in England.\n\nMaybe another reason this film is so memorable, apart from its honesty, is that it can easily be seen as the first slacker “buddy movie,” a lifestyle that would come into mainstream consciousness in the 90s with films like Trainspotting and TV shows like “The Young Ones,” and which plenty of young people here in the impoverished 2020s can still relate to. It has certainly influenced a number of films, such as Pineapple Express, to name but one example.\n\nIf you like your comedy to be as black as your soul, you’ve found your new favourite movie. As a time capsule of a certain time, place, lifestyle, and one man’s memories and adventures, it’s a unique film. That both would go on to worldwide fame along very different paths makes you realise how incredibly well-cast Withnail and I is, too. Take a chance, try something out of your usual. Oh, and for the love of all that’s holy do not drink lighter fluid, no matter how desperate you become."
