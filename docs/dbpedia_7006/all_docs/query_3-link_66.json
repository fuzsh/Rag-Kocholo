        "text": "The British director on the possibility of making a sequel to the 1987 cult classic and why his sobriety ended when writing the screenplay for The Rum Diary\n\n'Johnny (Depp) has made me a director again - and I will direct again,' said Bruce Robinson\n\nI started out life as an actor, but always wanted to write. I was over the moon when that happened with Withnail And I.\n\nIt was autobiographical, about my time as a struggling actor when I was living in a squalid dump in Camden Town.\n\nWhen we made the film my wife said, ‘I hope we get a couple of weeks in the cinemas.’\n\nNo one knew it was going to kind of lodge itself in the British psyche in the way that it has. I love the film and I have very happy memories of making it.\n\nOccasionally someone will come up to me and quote lines: ‘We want the finest wines available to humanity!’\n\nIt’s nice that it’s remembered with such affection. Withnail... has made a lot of dough, but I’ve never seen two quid out of it. I’ve been asked over the years to do a remake or a sequel, but I never will.\n\nPeople send me ‘Withnail 2’ scripts, which normally start with an explosion and Withnail staggering out of the rubble with a toilet seat around his neck. I mean, please...\n\nIn 2005, I was on holiday with my family in Seville when I got a call from Johnny Depp. I hadn’t spoken to him for five years, since I turned down his invitation to direct Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. God knows how he tracked me down.\n\n'No one knew it (Withnail And I) was going to kind of lodge itself in the British psyche in the way that it has. I love the film and I have very happy memories of making it,' said Bruce\n\nHe said, ‘Do you know The Rum Diary?’ I didn’t. I’d read lots of Hunter S Thompson, but not that book. At that time I hadn’t directed a film since Jennifer 8 in 1992. That had been such a bad experience that I vowed never to make another film again, and I kept that promise for 17 years.\n\nBut Johnny is a persistent man. He wouldn’t take no for an answer, and he kept on and on until I agreed to write the script and direct the film.\n\nHe could have chosen anyone – Martin Scorsese, even – to direct. The fact that he had such confidence in me swayed me. I thought, ‘Well, if this guy is prepared to take the risk of me doing it, I’ll do it.’\n\nObviously there’s a lot of drinking in the novel – it’s not called The Rum Diary for nothing.\n\n'It's nice that it's remembered with such affection. Withnail... has made a lot of dough, but I've never seen two quid out of it,' said Bruce (pictured on set with Richard E Grant and Paul McCann)\n\nI didn’t want to copy Hunter and write like him, but I wanted to write in his vernacular, which isn’t that dissimilar from my own. The rage that he felt all his life is certainly something I can relate to.\n\nWhen I began writing the script I hadn’t had a drink for six-and-a-half years. As I sat at the typewriter, the sober side of my head kept saying, ‘Don’t go there; you can write this without a drink’, and the other side, the devilish side, was saying, ‘You’ve got to go there, and if you don’t you’ll miss the essence of the book...’\n\n'Making The Rum Diary has cancelled out the bad experience I had making Jennifer 8'\n\nSo I had a drink. It was like medicine. I drank one bottle of wine a day, and then when I’d finished the script I went back to sobriety.\n\nI was five pages into the screenplay, in the middle of the English countryside, cows looking in the window, when I heard that Hunter had shot himself.\n\nMy relationship with Hunter was in my head – I adored him like I adore Baudelaire and Charles Dickens. I didn’t know him.\n\nMy first thought was, ‘What does that mean? Does Johnny still want to make the film?’ But Johnny called me later to say that now he wanted to get the film made more than ever to honour Hunter.\n\nAnd honour him we did. On set in Puerto Rico, the day began with a ritual homage to Hunter’s memory. We had a chair with his name on it, we had his script, nicely bound, on the chair, and by the side of it we would put a pack of Dunhill, a bottle of Chivas and a highball glass filled with tons of ice, just the way he liked it. Hunter was really there with us.\n\nMaking The Rum Diary has cancelled out the bad experience I had making Jennifer 8. Johnny has made me a director again – and I will direct again.\n\nThe night that the film wrapped, Johnny sailed me back to San Juan on his boat. I’ve never slept so well in my life – like an angel. Then he came in in the morning saying, ‘Time to get up!’, and I thought, ‘Oh no! It’s starting all over again…’\n\n'I didn't want to copy Hunter (S Thompson) and write like him, but I wanted to write in his vernacular, which isn't that dissimilar from my own. The rage that he felt all his life is certainly something I can relate to'"
