        "text": "5 Minutes with Secily Wilson, Orlando TV Personality & Mom\n\nFor about a decade, I’ve had the privilege of calling Secily Wilson a friend and a colleague. Does her name sound familiar? Well, you’ve probably welcomed this kind do-gooder into your home too… perhaps through the television screen or a magazine article. Secily first became a household name years ago in Central Florida as an anchor & reporter for WKMG Local 6, and later continued on as host of The Art Connection on WMFE. Today, in addition to her role as Director of Community Relations for the YMCA, Secily is a contributor to Growing Bolder, a media company focused on wellness and active lifestyles, which includes a magazine, radio program, and Emmy-nominated TV show. This mother of two holds two jobs, volunteers, and recently launched her own nonprofit… hello SuperMom! Here’s what she had to share with OFM:\n\nOFM: You’ve been so busy! How do you manage it all?\n\nSW: I’m driven by passion which, fortunately, allows me to merge and overlap my professional and personal focus onto areas that are important to me. For example, at the YMCA, I support and execute strategies with youth development, healthy living, and social responsibility with fundraising for scholarships and operations through relationships, partnerships, and grants.\n\nOFM: And what about at Growing Bolder?\n\nSW: Growing Bolder offers hope, inspiration, and possibility through the examples of individuals who smash stereotypes, redefine the possibilities of life after 50, and demonstrate that when it comes to living big, bold lives, it’s not about age but about attitude. I just turned 50 this year and this program is truly an extension of the positive outlook that I personally live by and, so, meeting and interviewing others who embrace life as passionately– despite obstacles — empowers me to reach for greatness.\n\nOFM: Health seems to be a reoccurring theme in your endeavors, and you have a big reason for that.\n\nSW: Yes. After reporting a story featuring the recovery of local survivor, Valerie Greene, I suffered my first (of two) TIA, which is a mini stroke, during a live broadcast. Thankfully, I recognized the symptoms that I was experiencing because of what I had learned through filming the news segment. For many years now, I’ve served as a volunteer for the Bcenter, a nonprofit founded by Valerie which provides resources, hope, and direction to stroke survivors and caregivers worldwide, and also the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association. Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States and worldwide, yet many people still don’t understand the warning signs and risk factors. However, 80% of strokes could be prevented with proactive use of such knowledge!\n\nOFM: You’re clearly a philanthropic-minded person. Tell me about your latest project aimed at making a difference in our community.\n\nSW: I launched a nonprofit called WOW Legacy Group, short for Wilson Orr Women which embodies my last name and my daughters’ last name. For the past three years, we’ve hosted Fall into Fabulous, an event focused on supporting and encouraging women who are in transition — from abuse, job loss, divorce, homelessness, etc. — to reach their true potential.\n\nThe idea for the FAB event was birthed from my personal experience of transition. I was a college graduate and had been successful as a broadcast journalist for 25 years. Then, in 2004, I suffered a stroke, lost my voice, went through a divorce, and lost my job and home all within a two year period. At the time of these challenges, I had one daughter in college and one in middle school. Like many women, I had never pictured the turn that my life would take. It was my faith in the Lord, personal strength, tenacity, and supportive network of friends and family that helped me out of my state of depression, fear, and frustration and into a more positive transition.\n\nIn turn, Fall into Fabulous helps others via counseling, education, and a little bit of fashionable fun. Attendees of this year’s event, which will be held on December 5th at Goodwill Industries of Central Florida on Orange Blossom Trail, will participate in empowerment sessions and a FAB Fashion Show.\n\nOFM: How can Orlando Family Magazine readers help your cause?"
