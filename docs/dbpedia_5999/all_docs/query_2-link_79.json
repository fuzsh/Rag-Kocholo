Competitor WFTV-TV just unveiled a new set.\n\nWKMG-TV also introduced some minor tweaks to its set to reflect the new branding though, ironically, the banner used on its social media profiles touting the new name and a new 7 p.m. newscast still shows talent in front of a dura sporting the old branding."
