        "text": "My interest in Akhmatova, who was vilified in the Soviet Union by the censors and authorities, but loved by the discerning people, had been ignited in a survey of 20th-century Russian literature course by Prof. Joseph Manson, who proclaimed this poet as the “greatest living Russian poet.” I was fortunate to find the two-volume emigre edition that dared include her banned poem named “Imitation of the Armenian.” Aware that in the Russian tradition an acknowledged “imitation” was based on the work of another without being a strict translation, I went about asking all the local literature scholars and persons conversant with Armenian literature to identify the source without results until one day, climbing the stairs of Widener Library, I beheld Prof. Kevork Bardakjian. Before the first line of my English translation of Akhmatova’s first line left my lips, he began reciting the great Hovhannes Tumanian’s quatrain in Armenian. I shared this find with Diana who crafted her own version that she recited for the first time at Voznesensky’s reading at Harvard.\n\nWhenever possible we would attend Diana’s spectacular inspired readings in the Boston area and many of the receptions that followed. Nonetheless mostly we phoned each other, yes, enjoying our most edifying conversations on poetry and poets. After I discussed reading Akhmatova’s own short “Memoirs” of her friendship with painter Amadeo Modigliani in Paris in 1910-1912, Diana wrote her artistic poem “Modigliani” for the Christian Science Monitor, where she complained to me, they had left out the dedication to me since it was I who had told her about the friendship, but in republication in the Armenian newspapers she made certain the dedication was not left out, so I proudly have it now.\n\nAt the Boston Globe Book Fair (October 1976) that Diana organized superbly for many years I read the Armenian original of a few poems (I remember reciting in Eastern Armenian and Russian translation Gevork Emin’s short poem, “Walnut Tree”) and Diana read her beautiful English translation.\n\nIn 1989, Diana’s newest book of poetry, About Time: Poems, inspired me to write an article on it, “Rereading Diana Der Hovanessian’s About Time: Poems,” which was published in the Armenian Weekly (March 4, 1989); the Armenian Mirror-Spectator (March 11, 1989).\n\nTwice I reviewed Diana’s books, The Other Voice: Armenian Women’s Poetry Through the Ages and The Second Question.\n\nDiana mentioned the title of her forthcoming book, The Second Question, over the phone that she was sending to me, adding, “I thank your mother in my book” (Mother Bertha Nakshian Ketchian had died in 1990), I recalled immediately our phone conversation of a few years ago. I had shared with Diana that whenever mother, a Genocide survivor, met an Armenian, her first question was “Where are you from?” and the second would be “How did you survive?” Diana transformed these words artistically to portray her Genocide survivor grandmother. She further urged me to review that volume because Louisiana Literature was interested. It was reprinted in the Armenian Mirror-Spectator, on March 7, 2009."
