        "text": "Applicants from institutions based in the United States must submit official transcripts from each college or university attended, listing all courses taken, grades and degrees earned, and dates of graduation to the Office of Graduate Admissions. If you submit your application prior to the conferral of your bachelor's degree or equivalent, you will be required to submit your official, final transcripts prior to your arrival at FIT.\n\nTranscripts must be sent directly from the college/university registrar OR sent electronically from services such as eSCRIP-SAFE, Parchment, and National Student Clearinghouse. (Current/Former FIT students need not request academic transcripts from FIT; these will be supplied by internal procedures.)\n\nIt is strongly recommended that official transcripts from US institutions only be sent electronically to [email protected]. If ordering transcripts from a predetermined list of schools, make sure to choose the option for the \"FIT - School of Graduate Studies\". Transcripts sent to \"FIT\" or \"SUNY FIT\" may not reach the Graduate Admissions Office.\n\nCandidates with degrees earned outside the United States are required to obtain a course-by-course international credential evaluation. Additional information about international credential evaluation services can be found on our Graduate International Applicants page.\n\nTwo or three references are required depending on which graduate program you are applying for. Reference the admission requirements for your specific program below to confirm the required number for your program. Recommenders should be able to speak to your scholastic ability or professional performance.\n\nRecommendations are submitted online through the application portal. Enter the following information for each of your recommenders in your online application: name, address, email address, phone number, institution or employer, title, field/discipline.\n\nIt is extremely important to enter your recommenders' email addresses correctly so that they each receive an automated email instructing them how to proceed with their recommendation through an online process. Recommenders will be required to complete and submit an online evaluation form through the online application system. There is no function to upload documents in the recommendation form. Mailed and emailed recommendation letters will not be accepted. After your recommender submits the online recommendation, it will become part of your application.\n\nApplicants who speak English as a second language must submit evidence of English Language Proficiency to do graduate work, as measured by the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language), the IELTS academic (International English Language Testing Service), PTE (Pearson Test of English), or Duolingo exams. This includes individuals who did not graduate from an undergraduate institution where the primary language of instruction was English, or comes from a country where English is not the official language.\n\nTOEFL, IELTS, PTE and Duolingo results are valid for two years prior to the semester of your application. The minimum scores for English language examinations are:\n\nTOEFL: A minimum TOEFL IBT (internet-based test) score of 80\n\nIELTS: A minimum band score of 6.5\n\nPTE: A minimum score of 53\n\nDuolingo: A minimum score of 105. Beginning with the Fall 2025 term, a minimum score of 110 will be required."
