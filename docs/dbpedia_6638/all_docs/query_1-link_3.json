        "text": "July 10, 2018\n\ntheres a lot more stories in here than the pre-revolution counterpart, mostly short in length. one per author except for Зощенко who gets several really short ones. quality varies a bit and the order of the stories is alphabetical by author so flow isn't exactly the greatest. its not surprising that the vast majority of stories here are either pre or post stalin, and as usual with the russians, the bleak ones are the best, although there is a fair amount of biting satirical humor too. the weakest ones are just complaints about their wives (theres about four of these for some reason), but even the weaker ones are over quickly. the Паустовский entry is a gorgeous ode to ecofuturist civil engineering and architecture that is delightfully soviet in character\n\nJuly 17, 2011\n\nThis is the second time I am going through this book of stories. I am gratified at their high quality. This includes not just the early Soviet stories of Babel, for example, but also some lesser known and perhaps more official authors like Boris Bedny. I suppose that the fact that one's work is politically vetted and one's scope is politically domesticated does not mean necessarily that one's talents are less.\n\nSo far I've read:\n\n1. The Childhood of Luvers by Pasternak: This story hails from 1917 and, therefore, doesn't seem like a real \"Soviet story\" at all. It takes place in the old Russia. It's a rather amazing piece: It provides a child's view of the world in adult language.\n\n2. Grackles by Babayevsky (1957): A vignette of country life that focuses on the human story and not on P.C. I suppose one writes in all countries with a focus on the human and not necessarily on the political milieu. So, I learned something.\n\n3. The King and A Letter by Babel (early 20's): The King is a charming and clever story about a wedding and the gangsters who attend it. The awful bride turns out to be totally self centered on sex in the midst of the other turmoil and chaos. A Letter is a sad story of war and the hatreds between sons and fathers. It is told entirely without commentary in the context of a soldier's letter to his mother. The use of the letter format prevents commentary and one must discover the main players by putting together their names and patronymics.\n\n4. Mosquitoes by Bedny (1951): And utterly charming love story at a lumber town in the far north. Get this: \"She was wearing his favorite cherry-colored dress, and all the things in [his] room --- the table, the cupboard, even the sink --- looked somehow different now, as if they realized that the lady of the house had arrived. All the things had clearly deserted to Anna's side and had acquired a new, unexpected meaning as if they had been made exclusively to surround Anna, to set off her cherry-colored dress, to conceal her dirt-stained shoes. She had walked!\"\n\nI will return to this \"review\" when I finish the book."
