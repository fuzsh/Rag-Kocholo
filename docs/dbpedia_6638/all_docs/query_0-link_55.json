        "text": "AN ARROW IN THE WALL Selected Poetry and Prose. By Andrei Voznesensky. Edited by William Jay Smith and F. D. Reeve. 344 pp. New York: Henry Holt & Company. $22.95.\n\nI REMEMBER, way back in the 1960's, hearing Andrei Voznesensky read his poems at Oxford. It was certainly a memorable experience. A slight young man, compact and relaxed rather than intense, he seemed to fly upward on the wings of the Russian vowels, putting his whole being into them, so that the separate sound of each survived in the hall as a permanent humming resonance. He has himself observed that there is ''a kind of drawn-out music in Russian speech that comes from the great distances of the Russian steppes. This cello-like note resounds in the lengths of our names - in our surnames and patronymics. Language is the music of thought, it is what our ancestors called the soul.''\n\nThat sort of remark is perhaps not entirely reassuring for its audience. It suggests a poetry more concerned with sound than with sense, with the appearance of being poetry rather than with the compression and surprise of a new meaning. And it is true that the first poem in this selection, ''I Am Goya'' - one of Mr. Voznesensky's earliest and most famous - works through a series of interrelated sounds, variations on the name of the painter, which echo through the brief poem in a series of desolate crashes - gore (grief), golos (voice), gorod (town), golod (hunger). Tolling out like deep bells (''I am the gullet / of a woman hanged whose body like a bell / tolled over a blank square''), the syllables convey a powerful impression of war and ruin and nightmare, the nightmare of the German invasion in 1941, when Mr. Voznesensky was a young child and his father, an engineer engaged in evacuating factories from Leningrad, brought him home a volume of Goya's etchings.\n\nMr. Voznesensky's recitation of this poem was electrifying, but it may be that the element of performance bulked necessarily larger than the poem's emotional impact. Russian poetry has always inspired recitation and a rapt response from the reciter's audience, but Mr. Voznesensky, and his contemporary Yevgeny Yevtushenko, are perhaps the first Russian poets to exploit this in the actual process of composition - to write poems specifically for performing, as pop songs are written for electronic transmission by singers and band. This exploitation of Russian sounds is in marked contrast to modern Polish poetry, which depends on a quiet, pellucid precision, the voice never being raised.\n\nThe watchdogs of Soviet orthodoxy, including Khrushchev himself, denounced ''Goya'' and other early poems of Mr. Voznesensky as ''formalist.'' That means nothing, though it may suggest the performance element, which translation - even such a good one as that of ''Goya'' by Stanley Kunitz - can hardly rise to. Yet translation seems to bring out the clear core of meaning in Mr. Voznesensky's poems, as if another language were needed to show how they can do without their almost excessive linguistic virtuosity. W. H. Auden seems to have perceived that; his translations have the odd felicity of words that go for the sense, not for the ''poetry'' (Auden knew no Russian), and thus seem more in touch with the personality of the poet.\n\nWhen Mr. Voznesensky showed one of Auden's translations of his poems to the Russian poet and novelist Kornei Chukovsky, who was himself an excellent translator, the latter remarked admiringly: ''One madman has understood another.'' Something of the same element of understanding was implied in a remark of Mr. Voznesensky that Auden himself might have made: ''The poet is two people. One is an insignificant person, leading an insignificant life, but behind him, like an echo, is the other who writes the poetry.'' We have the impression, oddly enough, that it is the two ''insignificant'' persons who met when Auden translated a Voznesensky poem, as if the two poets could afford to cancel each other out, and become a single human being.\n\nThis occurs in the poem ''Hunting a Hare,'' in which pity and guilt - pity for the hare and guilt about shooting it - are so straightforward as to seem the feelings of the ''insignificant person'' rather than of the poet:\n\nSomething is wrong, I know, When a glassful of living blood has to fly In terror across the snow.\n\nThe cunning rhyme on ''snow'' and ''glass'' (snegam/ stakan) shows the poet in charge, but the feeling of horror at the hare's cry in the silence of nature has a penetrating simplicity and appeal about it. There is no Western equivalent of this sort of Russian poetry, whose tradition is at once both very sophisticated and very direct. Songs or blues, which do not count as ''poetry,'' would be as close as we come to it, and to the comparison of the hunter's faces to red traffic lights as they rush home by car through the dark. At the same time there are references in these poems from a stock of images that goes back beyond Pushkin - such as the one in ''I Am Goya'' to Dmitri the Pretender, Czar in the Time of Troubles, whose ashes were fired from a cannon in Moscow defiantly toward the west.\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Voznesensky was out with all the trappings of the chase - snowmobiles and so on -hunting this hare and afterward making a poem about it. There is a somewhat uneasy paradox here, referred to in a thoughtful introduction to ''An Arrow in the Wall'' by William Jay Smith. He mentions the 1979 attack on the poet by Clive James in The New York Review of Books, a formidable indictment that amounted to saying there was something fatally facile about the poet and his poetry, because he could not tell the whole and direct truth about things in Russia. In the absence of that truth, all his poems were subtly untruthful.\n\nMr. James seemed to be saying that success and survival were themselves symptoms of dishonesty and that because Mr. Voznesensky had not been killed in a duel like Pushkin or hanged himself like Tsvetayeva, or had not been persecuted like Pasternak or sent to a camp like Irina Ratushinskaya, he could not be taken seriously. The case of Pushkin is in fact the best refutation of this argument, for his attitude to the Czar's regime was much the same as that of Mr. Voznesensky to the Soviet. In poems like ''The Bronze Horseman'' the great poet covertly criticized czardom - as Mr. Voznesensky has done in ''The Driver,'' his poem about Stalin as Caesar, or in ''Old Song,'' where he seems to be writing about Turkish janizaries but is really expressing his feelings about the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe poet as secret and alternative truth-teller is an old Russian tradition, and it goes with the passionate love of his country Pushkin displayed. When introducing Mr. Voznesensky's work to English-speaking readers years ago, Auden observed that Mr. Voznesensky's criticisms always revealed ''a profound love for his native land and its traditions.'' ''I wish to stress this strongly,'' Auden went on, ''because, given the existing climate, there is a danger that we shall misunderstand him by looking for ideological clues instead of reading his poems as one would read any poet who is a fellow countryman.'' Those are wise words, as William Jay Smith recognizes, for he and his fellow editor, F. D. Reeve, have organized this admirable selection to make Mr. Voznesensky as much at home in English, in America, as possible.\n\nPushkin himself would have enjoyed the quality of Mr. Voznesensky's humor, often so similar to his own. Over a dark and quiet empire alone I fly - and envy you, two-headed eagle who at least have always yourself to talk to.\n\nThe reference is to the old imperial symbol, inherited from Byzantium, the eagle whose heads face east and west. Mr. Voznesensky implies in his reference the continuity of imperial Russia and the Soviet Union, as he fills another poem, ''Does a High Wind Make Me Reel?'' with references to Stalin, whose ''great mustaches of state,'' stained red, hovered over the land like ''the wings of a bird of prey.'' Equally irreverent about all past tyrants, the poet notes only that they are ''over'' (bilo), in a single-word sentence.\n\nThe poems with an international flavor are less good, for, although he is a traveler who knows his West very well, Mr. Voznesensky tends to produce smart verbal fantasies about the West, hardly to be distinguished from most cosmopolitan writing. Nor is his prose as good as his poetry, although it is well translated by Antonina W. Bouis. His account of getting to know Pasternak, in ''I Am Fourteen,'' has a breathless and sentimental charm, sticky with hero worship: '' 'It's Pasternak on the telephone. For you!' My dumbfounded parents stared at me. When I was still a schoolboy, without a word to anyone, I wrote to him and sent my poems. This first decisive action was to shape my life.'' There is a vulgarity about this piece never wholly absent in Mr. Voznesensky's work. The other prose piece, called simply ''O'' (Russian for ''about''), is a personal meditation containing accounts of meetings with Picasso and Henry Moore, the sculptor.\n\nThis selection of pieces translated by a number of hands is by far the best attempt so far made to bring a contemporary Russian poet into a Western context, and the method it follows, printing the Russian text opposite the translation, should be compulsory for all such ventures. The editors have done a magnificent job. Robert Lowell, whose memory is celebrated in one of Mr. Voznesensky's most moving poems, would be pleased."
