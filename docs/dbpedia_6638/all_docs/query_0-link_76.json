        "text": "Our research focuses on the metatexts signed by Lucian Blaga as a translator. We prove that, due to the preference of Blaga for ethnocentric translation and his philosophy on poetic translation seen as interpretation, he is a translation theorist. The premise on which we base our research is represented by the remark belonging to Sean Cotter, according to which, in the case of Blaga, translation is a manner of challenging the linguistic policy imposed in Romania during the 1950s by the new regime. In this regard, we analyse the dichotomy margins versus centre in translation and the importance of the translation process in Romania during that decade. The pattern suggested by Lawrence Venuti in nowadays Translation Studies is reversed in the case of the translation subjected to our study: the translator abandons his/her “invisibility”, while ethnocentric translation becomes, in itself, a technique of resistance. The analysis of certain metatexts signed by Blaga proves that he had a modern philosophy on translation, which allows us to consider him a translation scholar avant la lettre. Thus, a careful analysis of metatexts signed by translators of that period would contribute to a greater visibility of trends existing in Romanian Translation Studies.\n\nTranslation - Theory and Practice: A Historical Reader responds to the need for a collection of primary texts on translation, in the English tradition, from the earliest times to the present day. Based on an exhaustive survey of the wealth of available materials, the Reader demonstrates throughout the link between theory and practice, with excerpts not only of significant theoretical writings but of actual translations, as well as excerpts on translation from letters, interviews, autobiographies, and fiction. The collection is intended as a teaching tool, but also as an encyclopaedia for the use of translators and writers on translation. It presents the full panoply of approaches to translation, without necessarily judging between them, but showing clearly what is to be gained or lost in each case. Translations of key texts, such as the Bible and the Homeric epic, are traced through the ages, with the same passages excerpted, making it possible for readers to construct their own map of the evolution of translation and to evaluate, in their historical contexts, the variety of approaches. The passages in question are also accompanied by ad verbum versions, to facilitate comparison. The bibliographies are likewise comprehensive. The editors have drawn on the expertise of leading scholars in the field, including the late James S. Holmes, Louis Kelly, Jonathan Wilcox, Jane Stevenson, David Hopkins, and many others. In addition, significant non-English texts, such as Martin Luther's 'Circular Letter on Translation', which may be said to have inaugurated the Reformation, are included, helping to set the English tradition in a wider context. Related items, such as the introductions to their work by Tudor and Jacobean translators or the work of women translators from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries have been brought together in 'collages', marking particularly important moments or developments in the history of translation. This comprehensive reader provides an invaluable and illuminating resources for scholars and students of translation and English literature, as well as poets, cultural historians, and professional translators.\n\nThis chapter outlines the theoretical and practical issues involved in compiling and analyzing the translation histories of literary classics from a socio-historical perspective. Starting from an overview of the theoretical framework (distant reading and sociological theory), I then move on to the practicalities of how and where to locate translations, both online and in print. Subsequently, I focus on one case study, namely Dante’s Divine Comedy, and analyzse its translation history. I give concrete data about the worldwide reception of this work – when and in which languages it was translated (and where it wasn’t was not translated) –- and then address specifically its translations into English. I show how often it was translated into specific forms – such as terza rima, blank verse, and free verse – and I additionally present examples of when it was censured in translation (in both Arabic and English). I address three other aspects of translation history as well: the nationalities of translators (focusing especially on the difference between UK and USA translators),; the age of translators;, and the gender of translators. I demonstrate that the vast majority of English translators of Dante’s Divine Comedy are male translators, even to the present day."
