        "text": "Abstract: The ever growing impact of information and communication technologies upon education, in general, and thinking patterns, in particular, plays an essential role in developing the pool of future intellectual capital. However, acquiring skills and knowledge under such circumstances poses specific difficulties both in terms of the learners ’ access to IT equipment, and in terms of their ability to use it. Moreover, the age-based discrepancies – among other things – generate extra-challenges to this category of education beneficiaries. In the aftermath of this assumption, the hereby article examines the impact of e-learning upon the quality of the teaching activity, as well as upon the extent to which the educator can enhance the level of equal opportunities provided to the learners by applying modern teaching techniques and procedures. After analyzing the pros and cons of the aspects mentioned above, the article will attempt to conclude upon the compatibility or, on the contra...\n\nThis chapter reviews the perspectives and scholarship that address educational equity through the application of technology and digital tools. We first explore how equity is framed in global discourse and the role that educational technology has played in both addressing and perpetuating disparities in achievement. Policymakers, designers, and researchers have routinely attempted to use digital technologies to address the learning needs of historically marginalized populations. Before we examine these technological interventions in context, we must first explore the root causes of what “counts” as an achievement gap as well as what “counts” as technology. Following this overview, this chapter then offers a sociocultural rationale for what equity-centered approaches to educational technology could look like. These guidelines are offered to ground design, research, and pedagogy and build on a foundation that strengthening the relationships fostered in formal learning environments is essential to improving learning outcomes sustainably. Much of the literature on educational technology centers on its innovations, effectiveness, efficiencies, and the promise of quick fixes to systemic and entrenched educational problems. Scant research has examined its role in addressing inequity (Tawfik, Reeves, & Stich, 2016). Specifically, we question what educational technology can do for students who contend with intergenerational forms of institutional racism, classism, and sexism. How can educational technology be used to liberate students instead of perpetuate inequalities in the schooling system? What does it look like to utilize an equity-centered approach to educational technology in school and out-of-school contexts?\n\nMuch of the drive towards greater utilisation of learning technology at the start of the twenty-first century is framed within the language of hyperbole. The term &#39;transformation&#39; makes particularly regular appearances within policies, publications and research which are suggesting that major changes in the landscape of teaching and learning are within our grasp, and that the developing capability of learning technology is the central tool which can help to achieve such a transformation. The examples below illustrate the almost mythical status of learning technology: We want to use ICT to build a society where everybody has the opportunity to develop their potential. We will ensure that all those working in our education and children&#39;s services are able to use the technology well. From that baseline, we can effect a genuine transformation of provision in the future. (DfES 2005: 10-11) E-learning will inevitably transform all forms of education and learning in the twenty-...\n\nThis ebook is a collection of summary reports of the thematic working groups (TWGs) of EDUsummIT 2015. EDUsummIT (International Summit on ICT in Education) is a global knowledge building community of researchers, educational practitioners, and policy makers committed to supporting the effective integration of research and practice in the field of ICT in education. EDUsummIT was founded in 2009 to extend and further develop the work undertaken by the authors of the International Handbook of Information Technology in Primary and Secondary Education, edited by Joke Voogt and Gerald Knezek (2008). Since its inception, EDUsummIT has been held four times, firstly in the Hague (2009), then Paris (2011), Washington D.C. (2013), and most recently, in Bangkok (2015). Between 70 and 140 participants from six continents have attended EDUsummIT meetings. While EDUsummIT participants meet biennially, thematic groups focusing on pertinent research topics in ICT and education are formed prior to EDUsummIT to prepare discussion papers. These papers are further developed during EDUsummIT. After each EDUsummIT, TWG findings are published in international journals and presented at major conferences. EDUsummITs are organised in association with international and national organisations actively supporting the use of information technology in education. These organisations include the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education (SITE), the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), Kennisnet (Netherlands), the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Working Group 3.3 (Research into Educational Applications of Information Technologies), the Association of Teacher Educators (ATE), the Teacher Development and Higher Education Division at UNESCO, and UNESCO Bangkok."
