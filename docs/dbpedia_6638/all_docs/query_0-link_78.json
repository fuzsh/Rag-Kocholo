Trends covered include Neo-Classicism, Sentimentalism, Romanticism, and Realism. This course covers poetry, drama and prose (short story and novel). All materials are read in English. No knowledge of Russian is required for this course. Three (3) credit hours.\n\nOverall, this course addresses the ability to deal with questions of values, ethics and esthetics as they are represented in literature and related fields in the Humanities which will be the focus. This course emphasizes the history and appreciation of the Humanities, rather than simply the ability to perform tasks at the written level. Nevertheless, this course will include substantial in-class and out-of-class writing that encourages the development of critical thinking and requires students to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate knowledge.\n\nCOURSE PHILOSOPHY and GOALS: The reading for this course is focused exclusivelyon primary works of Russian literature. While general histories of Russian literature and critical works certainly have their value, they are best appreciated once the student has read a sufficient number of novels, stories and plays. As a result none are assigned so that the student may read a larger number of texts. The requisite biographical and cultural background will be provided in the lectures. The student will follow the evolution of Russian literature from its beginnings to its triumph in the Golden Age. The student will become familiar with what are considered to be the classic works of each era as well as the trends which dominated the literary scene. In addition, the student will analyze and discuss literary works in a manner that consists of more than mere plot summary. As a result of this course the student will become aware that Russian authors are often acutely aware of their predecessors and contemporaries (both Russian and Western) and engage in dialogue with them. Finally, the student will develop some familiarity with the course of Russian history and basic elements of Russian culture.\n\n​REQUIREMENTS:\n\nTwo exams and a comprehensive final exam. The written exams will consist of a section of items to identify briefly as well as longer questions that require the student to analyze various aspects of the assigned readings. If you have a conflict with a test date, I will allow you to take the exam early, provided that you inform me beforehand.\n\nThere will also be an essay of 2-3 pages due on each of the seven novels read for the course. The essays are not to be research papers but neither are they to be mere plot summaries. Rather the student is to analyze some aspect of the novel. Several possible themes for each essay will be provided by the instructor although students are free to come up with their own. The essays are usually due on the day discussion of each novel begins. Late essays will be accepted but will be penalized with a loss of at least ten points.\n\nTesting Schedule(Subject to change):\n\nExam One: February 20\n\nExam Two: April 3\n\nComprehensive Final Exam: Tuesday, May 2, 1:30-3:30PM.\n\nATTENDANCE: Attendance is required, will be recorded, and will be a significant component of your grade.\n\n​GRADING:\n\nEverything is graded on the 100-point scale. The final course grade will be based on your performance on the three exams, each worth 15% of your final grade, attendance which is worth 15%, the essays which are worth 20% and the final exam which is worth 20%. ​. All course grades are given on a +/- basis. For an explanation of the policy, see theUndergraduate Catalog.\n\n​CLASSROOM ETIQUETTE:\n\nIt is expected that all students will pay attention and participate in class. Therefore, no electronic devices are to be used in class unless an assignment specifically calls for it or unless it has been approved by ODS (see below). Recreational use of electronic devices in class is a distraction for everyone else and all cellphones, laptops, tablets, etc. are to be turned off when class starts. Persistent violations will result in a reduction of the student’s class attendance grade. In instances regarding a family or medical emergency, an exception will be granted, if you inform the instructor in advance.\n\n​ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT POLICY:\n\nAll students in attendance at the University of Alabama are expected to be honorable and to observe standards of conduct appropriate to a community of scholars. The University expects from its students a higher standard of conduct than the minimum required to avoid discipline. Academic misconduct includes all acts of dishonesty in any academically related matter and any knowing or intentional help or attempt to help, or conspiracy to help, another student.\n\nThe Academic Misconduct Disciplinary Policy will be followed in the event of academic misconduct.\n\n​DISABILITY STATEMENT:\n\nThe University of Alabama is committed to ensuring the full participation of all students in its programs. If you have a documented disability (or think you may have a disability) and need reasonable accommodation(s) to participate in this class, contact the Office of Disability Services (or ODS; 205-348-4285, [email protected], Houser Hall 1000, www.ods.ua.edu) as soon as possible. If you have been approved to receive accommodations through ODS, please meet with me during office hours or by appointment to submit your accommodation letter and discuss how accommodations can be implemented in this course."
