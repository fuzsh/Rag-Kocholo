        "text": "To the Editor:\n\nAdmittedly the breast-beating about the status of American poetry of the past 25 years or so is more entertaining than the poetry written during that time, and David Orr’s column “The Great(ness) Game” (Feb. 22) only adds to the levity. What we have traditionally deemed to be “poetry” has pretty much been relegated to academia and its array of writing programs, small journals, poetry prizes and anthologies. Even in the most respected poetry journals there is a numbing sameness (or is it smallness?) that is deflating.\n\nPossibly a more salient issue than what is great poetry would be, What is poetry in contemporary America? It would seem the topics that most contemporary poets write about are of little or no interest to the general public. Yet much of our popular music is boundlessly creative and, dare I say it, great. I would suggest that poetry is a continually evolving genre and that if we think of it only as the traditional rhymes and forms found in anthologies, then perhaps we are no longer going to find greatness. However, the lineal descendants of the troubadours are not just Eliot, Lowell, Bishop and their ilk but equally Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Norah Jones and their friends.\n\nBARRY D. AMIS\n\nAlexandria, Va.\n\n•\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nAm I the only loyal reader (and subscriber) who would rather have read several reviews of “not great” contemporary poetry than David Orr’s tiresome essay? Like an adventurer who climbs the greatest glaciers as the climate system that makes them possible collapses, Orr claims the “greatest” poets while the system of popular newspaper poetry reviewing that supports a literary culture trickles out. Please start giving us readers the news of poems, preferably from contemporary poetry presses rather than the “great” trades, because we’re dying miserably every day out here for lack thereof.\n\nE. J. MCADAMS\n\nManhattan\n\n•\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nHow serious and how silly is David Orr’s Feb. 22 On Poetry column. Sweeping with his Hoover down the middlebrow carpet of American poetry, Orr nods to a couple of sacrosanct great-grandparents — Emily and Walt — and chides his friends’ greatest friends — Elizabeth and Cal and Jimmy and John — for not doing great work.\n\nHave we no great poets in America? Day after day reporters list bankers who are far from great. The press is also saying that President Obama isn’t fulfilling his most liberal campaign promises; he’s no great guy. And now here’s David Orr saying that our nostalgia for the way we imagine life to have been before careerism took over engenders our squishy concept of poetic “greatness.” If there are great poets among us, he doesn’t see any. Indeed, his assumption that prevailing conventions are exclusive prevents him.\n\nGreatness isn’t the problem; irresponsibility is. The avaricious banker’s greed is matched by the self-centered poet’s solipsism. Neither cares about the social context; neither even conceives that success depends on the aptness of work’s social function and a discipline’s formal power. From reading a book of poems we should have an idea of the basic nature of a society and its culture. Ignorant of and indifferent to their useful roles, however, the banker grabs all the bonuses possible and the poet concocts endless, irrelevant lyrics. Bankers who value this conventional poetry contribute to the foundations that support it, and poets who want to be published provide the material. Now, perhaps, if enough banks fail and enough publishing conglomerates collapse, we’ll discover our oddballs, our different voices, our adequate innovators, who, like Dickinson, like Melville, like Whitman in their time, have been invisible in ours.\n\nF. D. REEVE\n\nWilmington, Vt.\n\n•\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI enjoyed David Orr’s essay on poetic greatness — it was good, although not great. But this business about greatness will not get us closer to the pot of gold or the mansion on Parnassus.\n\nSome poets we don’t even know yet will have the “great” mantle thrown over them, just as some poets now called great will have theirs taken away, some for good. If poets just try to write poems as well as they can, that’s a nice nod to greatness — and the only one we really need.\n\nTIM SUERMONDT\n\nBrooklyn"
