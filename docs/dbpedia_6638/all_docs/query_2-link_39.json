        "text": "INTRODUCING MIKE JUSTER\n\nby Rhina Espaillat\n\noriginally published in Light\n\nWhen extraterrestrials land and begin their destruction--or enslavement, or culinary preparation--of the human race, they will find allies among us. I mean, of course, those writers who cheerfully describe how loathsome human beings are and what a blessing it will be when we disappear.\n\nWhat a delight, after reading some of that, to read anything at all by Mike Juster, whose name is perfectly apt! But he could also go by the name of \"Mike Saner\" or \"Mike Funnier,\" or \"Mike Truer,\" because what his work invariably exhibits is the rationality, the balance, the sense of membership in the human species, that produces work, whether serious or humorous, of a very different and more enduring kind.\n\nJuster says he began writing at the age of ten with \"bad rhyme and meter\" and then went on to \"bad free verse as puberty hit.\" His early models included Eliot, Plath, Creeley and Medieval Latin epics in blank verse translations. The interest in translation has remained, producing prize-winning work, chiefly from Latin and Chinese.\n\nA student of both F. D. Reeve and Robert Shaw, Juster composed his first sonnet as an assignment for Shaw, but soon, dissatisfied with his work, stopped writing. After a decade, sensing a void in his life, he began reading contemporary poets, and discovered Philip Larkin in 1991. Reinvigorated, he began writing, submitting work for publication and attending the West Chester Poetry Conference, where he was encouraged by Dana Gioia and stimulated by talking with others about poetry for the first time since college. His return to writing was sealed when he won the Howard Nemerov Sonnet Award for \"Moscow Zoo,\" in 1995. He won the Nemerov Award again in 2000, and was a Finalist in 1996.\n\nJuster's poems, seldom autobiographical, tend to begin with ideas rather than moods or emotions. He thinks of poetry not as a way into one's life, but as a way out of it, into external concerns and an examination of what surrounds us. He likes, he says, to \"appropriate\" external events into his life, \"fuse\" experiences--whether lived or heard about--into one experience that then becomes his in the poem, for the poem's purposes. He thinks of the poem as an artifact created out of what we think, know and live, but not necessarily a direct expression of it.\n\n\"Long Strange Trip,\" for instance, in which \"The flower children gone to seed/Bake brownies for the PTA/And give to liberals in need,\" goes on to portray the compromises and losses (\"nothing tie-dyed ever fits\") that aging imposes, even on colorful rebels. The poem concludes with \"What a bummer.\" The pose of detached, quasi-sympathetic \"observer from the sidelines\" works to poke good-natured fun at the absurdities of an era and those who lived it, but also at our own not-yet-perceived absurdities.\n\nThe pleasure of Juster's poems goes beyond their dead-pan humor; it hinges on his language, his use of every device, and his mastery of every form. Here is his \"Round Trip,\" a rondeau that is also almost monorhyme, so that the repetitive form and the obsessive end-rhymes recreate the experience being conveyed:\n\nROUND TRIP\n\nI wait for luggage at the carousel\n\nAnd count the ways this trip has not gone well.\n\nThe holding pattern did not end until\n\nI started feeling violently ill\n\nFrom wolfing nuts and swilling zinfandel.\n\nThe only thing that makes my nausea quell\n\nIs badgering the airline personnel.\n\nEleven hours out of Evansville,\n\nI wait for luggage.\n\nPerhaps demons from airplane movie Hell\n\nHave placed me under some hypnotic spell\n\nWhich keeps me staring like an imbecile\n\nUntil I have no brain cells left to kill.\n\nI dream of sleeping in my cheap hotel,\n\nAnd wait for luggage.\n\nJuster also runs the gamut of emotional tones. A crisp, grisly sonnet bristling with unresolved fury, \"On Remembering Your Funeral Was Today,\" begins, \"When first I swore to tap-dance on your grave/My oath was neither wit nor metaphor.\" It ends, without a hint of mitigation or regret, \"I see you basting in Satanic slime/Before deep-frying in your cockroach shell.\"\n\nA stunning Stefanile sonnet explores the difficult territory of unacknowledged mixed ancestry:\n\nCONFRONTING THE JEW\n\nMy mother never spoke a phrase as true.\n\nRecalling their blind date, she said she thought\n\nMy father \"was an Arab or a Jew.\"\n\nPolitely vicious aunts and uncles fought\n\nSuggestions of this sort for generations,\n\nBut lost. There were no other explanations.\n\nSpanish ancestors crossed the Pyrenees,\n\nAnd found in France the safety that they sought.\n\nThough they survived, the Torah was not taught\n\nFor long; in far and fractured colonies,\n\nTheir baptized children wear their butchered name.\n\nI cannot guess the onslaughts they withstood,\n\nOr things they loved. With nothing to reclaim,\n\nI still would say a kaddish if I could.\n\nJuster incorporates references to tattoos, the Loch Ness Monster, Elvis, Houdini, Roswell, rock stars, cartoon and movie characters, the silliness of supermarket magazines, and his reading of poets past and present. Here, for example, is his graceful tribute to Wendy Cope:\n\nUNLIKELY AFFAIR\n\nI was unsettled to discover\n\nI am in love. With Wendy Cope\n\nMy nightly read, why take a lover?\n\nI was unsettled to discover\n\nHow often I was thinking of her.\n\nKnowing her poems discouraged hope,\n\nI was unsettled to discover\n\nI am in love with Wendy Cope.\n\nNothing rooted in the human seems too incongruous to find its way into a Juster poem: he includes sexual innuendo, murderous scenarios, epitaphs for the living, vignettes that work like mini-dramas, rueful lyrics, imaginary greeting cards for use in embarrassing situations, and snippets from the writing life:\n\nHONEST REJECTION LETTER\n\nHere at The Antiseptic Review\n\nWe are afraid we must eschew\n\nThe sonnets, odes and jejune haiku\n\nOf such obscurities as you.\n\nWe know hope springs eternal,\n\nSo go annoy some other journal.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nThe Predators\n\nThe range of Juster's interests and sympathies is revealed by his two latest works. One, Longing for Laura, is a translation of selections from Petrarch's Canzoniere that misses none of the anguished patience of unfulfilled love and renders it with persuasive freshness. The other, a riveting long narrative titled \"The Secret Language of Women,\" tells the story of a language preserved by Chinese women to record their private lives. The latter, which won an award from the New England Poetry Club, is told from the point of view of the hypothetical woman who devised the language and preserved it at the cost of great difficulty during periods of persecution. What a double gift it is, this capacity to \"become,\" without cant, any person on whom the creative imagination chooses to focus, however alien in every way to one's own background or identity, coupled with poetic skills that persuade the reader to do the same!\n\nThe one thing not to be found in Juster's work is what those long-expected extraterrestrials will need before they do us in: justification for the deed. He will be no help to them at all. He is fairly sunny about other people and the world, in fact, not because he is blind to flaws, but because reason and maturity keep his expectations modest. He doesn't use satire to settle scores with \"Them,\" but to attack, with self-deprecating humor, the traits, customs and practices that need attacking in all of us. He doesn't use lyric poetry to bewail lost hopes, wallow in envy, or complain of having been cheated by life. His keenest dissatisfactions are reserved for those systems and forms of thought that fail to put the human first and give it due weight, like those bureaucrats in \"Moscow Zoo\" who condone the murder of millions because it fulfills an ideological need.\n\nThere's no better way to close than with Mike Juster's \"Letter to Auden,\" in which he brings one of poetry's great \"dead white males\" up to date on how the life of the mind is proceeding these days on our home planet:\n\nLETTER TO AUDEN\n\nUh, Wystan?\n\nPlease forgive my arrogance;\n\nYou know how most Americans impose.\n\nYour chat with Byron gave me confidence\n\nThat your Platonic ghost would not oppose\n\nSome verse disturbing you from your repose.\n\nBesides, there's time to kill now that the Lord\n\nHas silenced Merrill and his ouija board.\n\nOr do you pine for peace in Paradise,\n\nBesieged by every half-baked psychic hack\n\nIntent on mining gems from your advice?\n\nWith me, please don't insist on writing back\n\nUnless you can't resist some biting crack.\n\nI also recognize that I had better\n\nKeep my remarks far shorter than your Letter.\n\nIndeed, I'll need some substantial guile and nerve\n\nTo try to emulate your bracing pace.\n\nAt twenty-nine, your lines had style and verve;\n\nMy work at thirty-nine seems commonplace\n\nAnd foreordained to sink without a trace.\n\nIn any case, I do not hold out hope\n\nOf sharing space with you or spiteful Pope.\n\nA partial consolation on bad days\n\nIs no contemporary can compete\n\nWith you at all. Downtrodden MFA's\n\nDenounce the Audenesque as obsolete\n\nOppression by your dead-white-male elite,\n\nBut then they go on to become depressed\n\nBecause there's nothing left to be confessed.\n\nOnly a few eccentrics still support\n\nThose poets who can scan lines properly.\n\nHowever, I'm delighted to report\n\nThat you became a hot pop property\n\nWhen Four Weddings exhumed your poetry.\n\nYou would have been amused to see its star\n\nArrested with a hooker in his car\n\nBut shocked that we remain so schizophrenic.\n\nOur sordid scandals rarely stay concealed\n\nAlthough we want things guiltless and hygienic.\n\nGay Studies has developed as a field\n\nIn which great writers' lovers are revealed;\n\nYou lose some points for marrying a Mann\n\nAnd your diversity of goings-on.\n\nAs your long-suffering but faithful fan,\n\nI must disclose you missed the NEA,\n\nThe disco era, Gump and daily bran.\n\nIn short, you would assess the present day\n\nAs drearily debased and dÃ©classÃ©.\n\nWell, Wystan, this is all that I can muster.\n\nGive my regards to Byron.\n\nFondly,\n\nJuster"
