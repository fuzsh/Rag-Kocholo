        "text": "Visit the Library Home Page Read the latest Library news in The Circulator\n\nNow circulating: New fiction\n\nMost of our \"New Fiction\" is newly published. Some of the books in our \"New Fiction\" collection are previously published and recently acquired. It hardly matters, because good fiction endures.\n\nOur New Fiction books don't sit on our shelves for long, so now is the time to check out one of these books, or place a \"Hold\" on your favorites from any internet-enabled computer, with your library card. Visit the Southeast Steuben County Library home page and click on the \"Catalog\" link to start the process.\n\nHere is some of what we have to offer:\n\nThe House in Amalfi, by Elizabeth Adler; St. Martin's Press\n\nThe Third Secret, by Steve Barry, from Ballantine Books.\n\nLeaving Home, by Anita Brookner; Random House.\n\nThe Carpet Makers, science fiction by Andreas Eschbach; TOR.\n\nThe Widow's War, by Sally Gunning, from William Morrow.\n\nJubilee, by B.J. Hoff, large print; Thorndike Press.\n\nThe World to Come, by Dara Horn, from W.W. Norton & Company.\n\nDinner with Anna Karenina, by Gloria Goldreich, large print, from Thornndike Press.\n\nThinner Than Thou, a satirical fantasy by Kit Reed; Tom Doherty & Associates.\n\nMy Sister Life, by F.D. Reeve, from Other Press.\n\nThe Mercury Visions of Louis Daguerre, by Dominic Smith, from Atria Books.\n\n{What I Did Wrong}, by John Weir; Viking.\n\n\"New Fiction\" also includes audio books. Nero Wolfe lovers will welcome our two newly acquired Rex Stout mysteries on tape: Too Many Cooks, and A Right to Die. Agatha Christie fans may appreciate the BBC's audio dramatization of The Sittaford Mystery.\n\nMystery-thriller writer Charles Benoit, author of Relative Danger, spoke\n\nabout his new book, Out of Order in the Laura Beer Community Room on April 27.\n\nDigital libraries bulk up\n\nDigital libraries are expanding in every way imaginable. They are growing in number, in content and in importance to students, researchers and the general public. If you have used the Web for research, you have probably visited a digital library, perhaps without knowing it.\n\nAlthough some digital libraries are private, including University libraries that have digitized their books and resources, many are free for public use. Topics range from A to Z; from Children's Stories to Science; from \"Adams, Ansel\" to Zoology.\n\nIf American history is your interest, the Library of Congress (LOC) has created an excellent portal to more than 120 collections of text, audio, images and films. Click here to visit LOC's American Memories website. LOC's Global Gateway to world culture and resources is a great portal to the LOC's resources on international culture.\n\nThe Internet Archive is a vast repository of free-for-public-use content including downloadable versions of classic feature films now in the public domain.\n\nProject Gutenberg is a library of free digitized books... 18,000 of them.\n\nTypical of many digital libraries, ibiblio is a collection of digital collections of poetry, literature and other resources. One if its \"collections\" is Project Gutenberg!\n\nThe list goes on. If you want to understand more about the nature of digital libraries, how they started, how they interrelate and where they are headed, read Digital Libraries, by William Y. Arms of Cornell University. Like much of what you find in digital libraries, it's a free download.\n\nErwin, Painted Post:\n\nNew local histories introduced\n\nTwo new works of local history were introduced yesterday at the Library. Erwin Town Historian Ellen M. Regan presented her project, An Oral History: Town of Erwin, Village of Painted Post, Early to Mid-20th Century to a fascinated audience in the Laura Beer Community Room. At that meeting, David W. Anderson of the Painted Post-Erwin Museum at the Depot announced publication of The Indian Speaks Again, a compilation of all 18 issues of The Indian Speaks, a newspaper featuring home-town news that was mailed to those in military service during World War II.\n\nCopies of both works are now in the Library's collection.\n\n\"The source for my oral history is the stories people told to me,\" said Regan, who explained that an oral history is \"history as related by the people who lived it, including letters and diaries. It is history that relates to daily life.\"\n\nRegan compiled the oral history based on taped interviews with nine Erwin residents ranging in age from 60 to 90, plus additional documents, photos and other materials. Those interviewed were Fuller Allen, Charles \"Buster\" Barrett, Roland Bentley, David \"Deak\" Johnson, John \"Jack\" Kelly, Audrey Cloos Phelps, Elsie Manning Randall, Thomas Regan and Mary Clark Sardinia.\n\nRegan's oral history, printed in report format with photos, is now available as part of the Southeast Steuben County Library's local history collection.\n\nDuring World War II, \"While some 475 sons and daughters of Painted Post were on active military duty, a small committee of citizens decided to publish a monthly newsletter with hometown news and mail it to those who were serving their country. Its title was The Indian Speaks,\" writes Audrey Phelps in the forward to The Indian Speaks Again, a new book that compiles the historic newsletter into a single volume.\n\nThe Indian Speaks was a remarkable publication, produced entirely through volunteer effort and financed by the unsolicited donations of local residents and businesses. The Indian Speaks Again, compiled and edited by David W. Anderson, reveals the Village of Painted Post as a community that cares deeply about its fellow citizens placed in harm's way.\n\nPharmacist Ed Tillman, was \"one of the dedicated group that wrote and published The Indian Speaks.\" Others included Harry Childs, Dave Wenban, Ray Stevens, Charles \"Coddy\" Johnson, Ken Breen and Dortha Morse.\n\nCharles Barrett and others helped Anderson compile The Indian Speaks Again. The 180-page trade paperback is dedicated to Ed Tillman's son, Myron E. Tillman (1932 - 2003), the former New York State Supreme Court judge.\n\nCopies of The Indian Speaks Again are available for sale ($25) at the Benjamin Patterson Inn (Corning-Painted Post Historical Society) and at Painted Post Village Hall. Copies will also be available for sale at the Depot Museum when it opens for the summer season.\n\nAnderson said the Southeast Steuben County Library purchased the first two copies of The Indian Speaks Again. Library Director Lise Gilliland said one copy was for our Local History Room and the other will be placed in circulation.\n\nFor children:\n\nBook 'em! & Cinco de Mayo fest\n\nCinco de Mayo commemorates the 1862 victory of the Mexican Army over the French at the Battle of Puebla. It has since become a festive holiday in Mexico and an ethnic celebration in the United States. The Southeast Steuben County Library celebrates Cinco de Mayo, with two children's programs:\n\n- Spanish Story Time, a bilingual reading with Hipolito Cortes, will be held from 10:30 am to 11 on Thursday, May 4 in the Laura Beer Community Room.\n\n- Celebrate Mexico, a festive cultural experience, will be held here on Thursday, May 4 from 4 pm to 5.\n\nBoth Cinco de Mayo programs are open to children of all ages.\n\nOn the following Thursday, May 11, the Children's Department will host a reading incentive program presented by Chemung County Sheriff's Deputy Juli Lathrop and her cadre of clever canines.\n\n\"Book 'em!\" is recommended for children 5 and older. It will be held from 6 pm to 6:45.\n\nPrograms at the Southeast Steuben County Library are free of charge.\n\nComputer recycling, Saturday\n\nSaturday, April 22, 2006 is Computer & Electronics Recycling Day in Steuben County. Drop off your old computers, televisions and unwanted electrical equipment at the transfer Station in Gang Mills from 9 am to 2 pm. It's free. Click here for full details including a list of acceptable items.\n\nFriends of the Library Book Sale\n\nDon't miss the Friends of the Library, SSC Spring 2006 Book Sale at the East Corning Fire Hall. The sale opens to the general public on Monday, April 24 and runs through Saturday, April 29. The sale is open to members of the Friends of the Library, SSC only on Saturday, April 22, from 9 am to 4 pm. (You can become a member at the door.)\n\nSee our \"Coming Events\" calendar for daily sale hours and the progressive discount schedule. The East Corning Fire Hall is located on Route 352 (East Corning Road) between I-86 exits 47 and 48, near Corning Animal Hospital.\n\nOral History of Erwin, Monday\n\nErwin Town Historian Ellen Reagan will present \"An Oral History of the Town of Erwin - Telling the Story\" on Monday, April 24 at 7 pm in the Laura Beer Community Room at the Southeast Steuben County Library.\n\nNine residents of Erwin have shared their stories in taped interviews, which taken together provide glimpses of what it was like to live and grow up in Erwin and Painted Post during the World War I and World War II eras, including the Great Depression.\n\nClick here for full details.\n\nOnline academic searching:\n\nMicrosoft chases Google Scholar\n\nMicrosoft Corp. this week introduced an academic search service the company hopes will rival Google Scholar.\n\nWindows Academic Live Search is now accessible in beta form, and so far covers three fields: Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Physics. Microsoft plans to expand the database, which currently has more than 6 million records from 4,300 journals and 2,000 conferences.\n\nBoth Google Scholar and Windows Academic are free internet-based services. Google Scholar, which covers a broad range of academic fields, builds its text database in part by formula. It crawls the Web, capturing academic content. Windows Academic works exclusively with publishers to provide content, ensuring, the company says, that every article in the database has been peer-reviewed.\n\nWindows Academic delivers short summaries of articles and abstracts. Search results are presented in a split-screen view, with a preview pane on the right that displays an abstract from an article. When linked to an academic institution's digital collection, the service becomes a fast vehicle for delivery of full-text articles to students and faculty.\n\nFor a review of Windows Academic Live Search by SearchEngineWatch.com, click here.\n\nFor a more complete description of Google Scholar, click here.\n\nNvu Web editor is friendly & free\n\nIf you've wanted to create your own website but have been dissuaded by the cost of Web-editing software, Nvu, a free, open-source Web editor, can help. Nvu lacks many of the features of popular Web editors such as Macromedia's Dreamweaver and Microsoft's FrontPage. If your goal is to create a personal website or a simple small-business website, Nvu may have all the features you need.\n\nLike FrontPage and Dreamweaver, Nvu is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get Web Editor. The Web page design process is visually oriented. That means users can create web pages without having to learn HTML code or JavaScript.\n\nNvu doesn't have all of the bells and whistles of the commercial Web editors. For instance, it lacks the capability to handle frames, which allow content to scroll within a fixed frame and the same frame to appear on multiple Web pages. In the main, Nvu also offers fewer formatting options for Web page elements. Nvu also lacks a split-screen mode that permits users to see how changes they make to pages visually play out in code.\n\nBut Nvu is remarkable for the features it has rather than for what it lacks. Click on this link to see a mock-up page of The Circulator that was put together in a few hours with Nvu. (Remember to click the \"back\" button to return to the real Circulator.)\n\nTo download Nvu, click on this link. Read the download instructions carefully. Nvu is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. (Note: The Windows icon is hard to find on the download page, but it is there.) Be sure to download the tutorial extension. It helps.\n\n(The Southeast Steuben County Library is not responsible for problems associated with this software. Use it at your own risk.)\n\nFirst search = FirstGov.gov\n\nYou may not have noticed. In January 2006, the Federal Government introduced new search capabilities into its omnibus web portal, FirstGov.gov. The improvements do not jump out at you. They may help you find the government information you seek, faster.\n\nFirstGov.gov now uses the Web-search platform, Velocity, to crawl government documents and Web pages and cluster the results into thematic categories. This clustering capability by Vivísimo, combined with an MSN search index more than five times larger than the old FirstGov.gov search index, deliver a more comprehensive and feature-rich search. As a result, you may find you spend less time navigating links to government information and more time exploring relevant topics in depth.\n\nSelected state government files are included in the expanded search, so you may find even the local information you need by using the search bar on the FirstGov.gov home page. It is a quick and easy way to begin your hunt for government information. Velocity's clustering capability - based on the Clusty meta-search engine - makes the search process even simpler.\n\nFor an article posted on LLRX.com that reviews in detail the new FirstGov.gov search capabilities, click here.\n\nSpring Break events for kids\n\nCelebrate Spring Break with your children this week at the Southeast Steuben County Library. Two special events are planned.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 18 from 2 pm  5 pm, the Childrens Department will host a showing of the hit movie, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The movie is free, with free snacks. An adult must accompany children younger than age 8. Click on this link for movie details from IMDB.\n\nOn Wednesday, April 19 from 2 pm to 3, children of all ages are invited to Tales from the Hen House, a rollicking hour of fun with the Mad Hatters Storytelling Troupe. The event features readings of The Most Wonderful Egg in the World, by Helme Heine and Eggday by Jane Cabrera. The reading will be followed by a post-holiday Egg Hunt.\n\nAt the Library:\n\nTalk is Out of Order, April 27\n\nAward-winning mystery-thriller writer Charles Benoit will talk about his new book, Out of Order, on Thursday, April 27, 2006 from 7 pm to 9 at the Southeast Steuben County Library. The book's protagonist, Jason Talley, hails from Corning, NY.\n\nIn 2005, Benoit received the prestigious Ben Franklin Award and the Glyph Award for his first novel, Relative Danger, as well as nominations for the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best First Mystery, and the Best First Mystery Barry Award given by Deadly Pleasures magazine.\n\nCopies of Out of Order, as well as Relative Danger, will be available for sale at the book signing and author discussion.\n\nOut of Order depicts Jason Talley, driven into a whirlwind of unexpected events and strange circumstances while abroad, in India.\n\n\"India is the last great adventure in the world,\" said Benoit. \"I wanted to portray an everyday person finally being able to be the hero, not like the stories we always see on television and in the movies. It's the everyday individual on an adventure of a lifetime that is so inspiring. In this case the individual happens to be from Corning and I hope that is part of what will make this novel so fascinating to my readers.\"\n\nBenoit, shown at left, lives in the Rochester, NY area. He has served in the US Army as part of the 3rd Infantry's Old Guard, taught high school social studies with the Rochester City School District, was an instructor for four years at the American International School in Kuwait, and is currently a copywriter at Dixon Schwabl Advertising in Victor, NY. He is also the host of the award-winning \"Smart Set,\" Jazz 90.1's weekly swing show.\n\nHarvard - UC Berkeley study:\n\nPhishing fools savvy surfers, too\n\nAccording to a Harvard-UC Berkeley study on phishing - the practice of directing users to fraudulent web sites - existing security cues and pop-ups on web browsers are \"ineffective\" in preventing Internet fraud. Cleverly designed phishing web sites fooled 90% of participants in the study, \"Why Phishing Works,\" by Rachna Dhamija of Harvard and J.D. Tygar & Marti Hearst of UC Berkeley.\n\nThe researchers compiled data from other sources, such as the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), which reported that 2 million users gave information to spoofed websites in 2003, and that \"U.S. banks and card issuers incurred $1.2 billion in losses.\" The APWG says there were more than 17,800 phishing reports in January 2006 alone.\n\nThe Harvard-UC Berkeley group says we see this high level of Internet fraud because phishing has become sophisticated and because computer users overlook the warning signs. Phishing sites fooled study participants, on average, 40% of the time. 23% of the study group did not look at the address bar, status bar or other security indicators when evaluating suspect websites. Even popup warnings were ignored by 15 out of the 22 study participants.\n\nAlthough the study group was small, it spanned demographic categories. There was no significant difference in ability to spot fraudulent websites between the sexes, age groups, people with different education levels or even between frequent and infrequent computer users.\n\nThe people who did best in the study:\n\n-Carefully evaluated website content,\n\n-Compared the domain name in the address bar with the domain name of the website they intended to land on,\n\n-Looked for the presence of \"HTTPS\" in the address bar, rather than HTTP (HTTPS indicates transmission through a secure Internet protocol.),\n\n-Looked for the presence of a padlock icon (in the Mozilla-Firefox browser) in the browser frame,\n\n-Checked to see whether the site had a valid certificate.\n\nConfused? Concerned? The Southeast Steuben County Library has a free class on Computer Security. If you want to learn how to protect your computer and guard sensitive information, consider attending the class on Monday, May 8, 2006 from 3 pm to 5.

Joseph and Sandra Windwalker of Medicine Owl Studios led the group. The event included a traveling museum with Native American cultural items displayed. Girl Scouts also visited Technical Services, to see how books are repaired (middle photo row, left).\n\nOur Own Authors, sample online\n\nLast week Jessica Teeter and Carolina Downie were named top prize winners of the Friends of the Library 2006 Short Story Contest.

These photos reveal slices of life from our past. They tell us what our communities once looked like - the people, the buildings & vehicles, the layout of the land.\n\nThe photos in the collection - mostly snapshots and negatives - have been indexed for use by researchers. Some of these images appear in print in regional histories and elsewhere; most do not. They are among the many treasures in our Local History Room.\n\nOther resources in our Local History Room include Steuben County Legislative Proceedings, back to 1985; Corning & Painted Post City Directories dating back to 1893 (some years missing); histories of Steuben and other counties in the Southern Tier; Volumes containing copies of New York state historical documents dating back to the Colonial Period; histories of our local municipalities, and much more.\n\nPlease take note: We are always interested in donations of photographs, postcards, local ephemera and books!\n\nIf you would like to do research in our local history room, our Reference staff will be pleased to assist you. To protect our documents, photos and other materials, unauthorized entry to the Local History Room is not permitted.\n\nToday in The Circulator, we are pleased to share five images of fire and firefighters of Corning, NY. Please click on this link to see the presentation.\n\nBEFORE AFTER\n\nBack by popular demand:\n\nDigital Photofinishing I & II\n\nOur two-part Digital Photofinishing class in March was filled, with several on the waiting list, so we're giving it again this month.\n\nThe two ninety-minute sessions are targeted for PC users who know how to use a digital camera but want to learn how to make better images and prints after the snapshots are taken. The classes should be of interest to anyone who wants an overview of how digital photo-processing is done. General computer literacy is the only class prerequisite. Apple (Mac) systems will not be covered, but Mac users may benefit.\n\nDigital Photofinishing, Part I will be held in the Southeast Steuben County Library conference room on Monday, April 17 at 6 pm, with Part II to follow two weeks later, on May 1 at 6 pm. Like all of the computer classes at the Southeast Steuben County Library, the new Digital Photofinishing series is free of charge and open to the general public.\n\nThe first session will cover topics including Getting images off cameras and onto PCs with flash memory cards and USB cables, Camera manufactures software vs. the Windows XP Wizard and Competing file formats: JPEGs, GIFs, TIFFs and PSDs. The session will also include a photo-imaging software overview.\n\nPart II will cover basic digital photo-processing techniques including cropping, rotating, flipping; manual and automatic adjustments for brightness, contrast, color balance & color saturation; sharpening, and sizing your final image for printing, the Web or email.\n\nClass size is limited to 15. You may sign up in person at the Reference Desk or by calling (607) 936-3713 ext 502. You may also register by email.

If you have a WiFi-equipped laptop, you may now access the Internet at the Library, for free!\n\nWireless Internet access (commonly known as WiFi) uses radio frequency signals to exchange information between your computer and the Internet. No cables are required.\n\nIf you do not own a WiFi-equipped laptop computer, use one of our 27 public access computers to surf the Web or to do Internet-based research. If you do have a laptop with WiFi, here's what you need to know:\n\n1. Pick up a copy of our new \"WiFi @ the Library\" brochure at the Reference Desk (or click on this link). It's your handy guide to WiFi use at the Southeast Steuben County Library. The guide includes the proper settings for your computer, other technical requirements and complete terms of use.\n\n2. Turn off the sound or bring headphones.\n\n3. Charge your laptop battery in advance. A few power outlets are available, but we suggest you have a fully-charged battery.\n\n4. Turn off encryption. The librarys wireless network is an open public access network. To make life simpler for everyone, the library has chosen not to encrypt the wireless network; therefore, users should be aware that information sent wirelessly could be intercepted purposely. Protect your personal data when using any public wireless network - avoid transmitting credit card numbers and other sensitive information.\n\n5. Be aware that you cannot connect your laptop computer to the library printer. Our wireless network is separate from our wired computer network.\n\n6. All users of the librarys Internet connection are subject to our Computer & Internet Usage Policy.\n\nThe Library's WiFi is a 24/7 service. Our hot spot extends beyond the building perimeter."
