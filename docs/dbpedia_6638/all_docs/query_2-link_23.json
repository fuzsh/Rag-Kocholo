        "text": "Franz Douskey has published in Rolling Stone, the Nation, New York Quarterly, The New Yorker, and Las Vegas Life. His readings and travels with such notables as James Dickey, Allen Ginsberg, Ai, Charles Bukowski and F. D. Reeve are legendary. Some of his writing has been performed by Frederica Von Stade of the Metropolitan Opera Company, The Yale Glee Club and The Heaths. Along with writing, Franz Douskey produces radio shows for WQUN, Quinnipiac University, and hides out with the horses at Giant Valley Farm.\n\nThe following interview took place via email and the poems below are reprinted from West of Midnight: New and Selected Poems with permission of the author.\n\n***\n\nOkla Elliott: A thought that returns to me regularly is that in the table-of-contents of a journal, prose is broken up into fiction and nonfiction, and a lot of people are intensely serious about that distinction. Poetry, however, is not divided in such a way, so readers are left to assume whatever they prefer about a poem’s factual status. Of course, it’s the metaphor and joy of invention that finally carries all writing, no matter its genre or relationship to historical fact, but, that said, I think poems by war veterans or abuse victims or even highly paid lawyers that depict their lives as accurately as possible might gain something by being read as aesthetic depictions of real events. I bring all this up because I get the sense that many of your poems would be classified as creative-nonfiction-in-verse, if we bothered to make this sort of distinction for poetry. I am thinking particularly of your poems “Remembering James Dickey,” “Eric,” “Burning the Gypsies,” and others. Could you speak a bit about how your personal experience and travels or historical facts have informed the content (or even the form) of your poetry?\n\nFranz Douskey: Personal experience and travel are strong forces of my writing. I like being there. About “Remembering James Dickey”… We got to know each other during the New York Quarterly annual Poetry Dinners at the Paris Hotel. We stumbled through that very dignified place often enough that the staff got to know us and would lead us safely away from their guests to preserve the hotel’s reputation. “Eric” was a student. One of those who came around to “take” my classes even when he hadn’t signed up. I still recall that phone call. “Burning the Gypsies” isn’t from direct experience, but the result of three separate forces that came together: my research of the Holocaust, my books of Gypsy life and lore, and Hell, I’m part Hungarian. Disturbing what we do to each other. Not every experience turns into poetry, but I find it difficult to be creative, inventive, etc. Enough extraordinary people and events have been part of my life that I seldom look inside. There is a Delphic maxim often ascribed to Socrates, “Know thyself.” I have no interest in knowing myself. What a dull book that would be.\n\nOE: What got you started on poetry? And what do you think helped you develop most as a poet?\n\nFD: Reading Kenneth Patchen, both prose and poetry, got me started writing. What came out was poetry. What helped develop my writing was travel. When I was excited by an author’s work, I sought out his and her books and, then sought them out. I visited Kenneth and Miriam Patchen often at 2340 Sierra Court. I was the only visitor allowed in the house, except for Kenneth’s dentist. Travel and reading caused me to visit Galway Kinnell, in Seattle, Henry Miller, at Big Sir, George Hitchcock, in Santa Cruz, and while living in Tucson I was strongly impressed by the poetry of Richard Shelton. I met a lot of writers there, including Raymond Carver, John Weston and Charles Bukowski. I traveled to several places, including New Orleans, with Bukowski, Gypsy Lou and Jon Webb, Bukowski’s first publishers (LouJon Press).\n\nAs I published more often, I traveled and did readings with Robert Penn Warren, James Dickey, William Packard, Allen Ginsberg and F. D. Reeve. Some of the Ginsberg-Douskey readings are in the Ginsberg Archive, at Stanford University, in Palo Alto. So I’d have to say, reading, traveling and getting to know the writers was a strong foundation.\n\nOE: What advice might you give young poets today?\n\nFD: Me give advice? First thing that comes to mind is: Why care what other people think? Self censorship is deadly for every human, and that goes triple for writers and especially poets. One time in a stop over at O’Hare, the plane attendant announced that our ground time would be brief Brilliant. How right she was and is. We don’t have forever. These bones are rented and we don’t know when the lease is up. Write, write, write, then revise, leave the work alone, go back and reread it, revise, revise and revise, knowing that revising is every bit a part of the creative process as writing down those original sparks. Go to readings, leave work early, travel, put yourself in weird experiences, even dangerous ones as long as you have an escape plan. Read a few writers, but make certain that you don’t fall in love with their style. Constantly become yourself. Leave the bough. Take on life and leave all blame behind. What you think and how you write are two elements uniquely you. And never take advice from anyone.\n\n***\n\nBeirut\n\nthings move quickly here\n\nthe roads are mined\n\nthey have trucks just to carry\n\nhuman parts\n\nI miss you a minute ago\n\nI was smoking and out of the corner\n\nof my eye I thought I saw your head\n\non my pillow I guess I’m losing\n\nmy mind\n\ndeath scares me\n\nI’ve never seen so much of it\n\nbodies on the roads\n\nblood seeps through shirts and blouses\n\nheads leak and mouths eat dirt\n\nand death could come now\n\nwhile I smoke and listen to music\n\nanyone might be the enemy\n\nit is scary\n\nyou should see the faces of the living\n\nworse than the dead\n\nten years ago it was different\n\nnow we are traveling\n\ninto something cold and dark\n\nsometimes I think I’ll never see you–\n\nif I get shot up\n\nthey’ll send what’s left in an empty glove\n\nwaving goodbye like a flag\n\n***\n\nCat Dying of Cancer\n\ntoo sick to do anything else\n\nshe twists in a chair to lick herself —\n\nthis is strange\n\nbecause she has cancer\n\nof the tongue\n\nI guess it’s clean but I don’t let her lick me\n\none night I’ll turn around and see nothing in\n\nher eyes\n\nbut me in my white robe leaning over her\n\nher tongue will’ve fallen out and slid behind\n\nthe cushion\n\none day my sister will come over with her\n\nkids\n\nand the one who searches the furniture for\n\nmoney\n\nwill pull out a piece of dried fruit\n\nonly it’ll be tongue of cat\n\nas is his habit he’ll probably eat it\n\nnext time his granddaddy asks him\n\ncat got your tongue? only you and I will know\n\n***\n\nBreton Speaking\n\nFirst of all, there are the demented\n\nfritillaries and raucous hummingbirds.\n\nYesterday Rimbaud came over to watch\n\nFantasy Island. His cough hasn’t improved,\n\nstill he won’t stop smoking.\n\nIt is difficult here. We hardly see\n\nanyone. The night is lacerated by downpours\n\nof shadows, a violent silence wings down\n\nfrom the vertiginous, embroidered stars.\n\nThere are massive snails in the woods.\n\nTrees are toothpicks in their jaws.\n\nWe lose old friends every day. Some of us,\n\nespecially Camus and Char, wonder if this\n\nis heaven or hell. Celine says\n\nit’s Paris, after the war.\n\nOur wives are still on the other side,\n\nwearing satins and sachets,\n\na minimal sign of virtue.\n\nDid I tell you about the bats? Last year\n\nonly five people lived to tell about them.\n\nThen there are the parties, equally deadly,\n\nthat one is expected to attend. Verlaine\n\nthrew up a week ago, and he still hasn’t\n\nbeen able to eat anything but Wheatena.\n\nEluard hasn’t gotten over dying. He says\n\nhe wasn’t ready. He has something that\n\nwould clear his reputation. He has sent\n\na letter of protest to God,\n\nthe true originator of surrealism.\n\nMeanwhile, any hope for hypogeous\n\nrestoration dwindles."
