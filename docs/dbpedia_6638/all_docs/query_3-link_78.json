        "text": "This study addresses the problem of varied definitions of leadership and focuses on the possibility that as part of the social science tradition, the results of other leadership definitions focused only on isolated variables. A review of the leadership literature showed that parsimony may be a problem in understanding leadership. In contrast to parsimony, the study uncovered over 90 variables that may comprise the whole of leadership. The authors then proposed an integrative definition of leadership encompassing the 90 plus variables that may help researchers and practitioners to more fully understand the breadth and scope of leadership. As more research uncovers new insights into leadership, this integrative definition will need to be upgraded, and as well, this integrative definition could be used as a base for leadership development programs.\n\nA search of the Expanded Academic Database in 2003 of published articles using the term “leadership” returned over 26,000 articles. One might wonder if we (as researchers, scholars, consultants, and leaders) were not the cause of this problem in that we have examined the parts of leadership, but not the whole. We reflected on the story of the blind men describing the elephant and the different accurate descriptions that each blind man gave, yet each was insufficient to understand the whole. How would the blind men’s descriptions change if the elephant started walking? The movement of the trunk is different than the movement of the tail which is different than the movement of legs, which is different than the movement of the side of the elephant, which is different than the movement of the ears. While the 26,000 articles talk about leadership, there seem to be a lot of blind men describing a moving elephant.\n\nWhy were we blind in our past view of leadership? Perhaps our training in research and the exploration in the social sciences caused us to miss the whole as we probed the parts. Social science research often uses reductionism in studying and understanding social phenomena, with studies focusing on relationships among selected variables. This is not a bad thing to do and has helped us understand hundreds, if not thousands, of social science concepts. However, in the case of the study of leadership, this approach has taken us away from the whole. And it is this whole that we seek to understand. This is not the first attempt to study the whole of leadership as Rost (1993) reviewed leadership definitions, only to end up with the same social science research reductionist flaw when he concluded his work with a five-point definition of leadership. Barker (2002) also reviewed the leadership definitions used to date, only to also conclude that leadership is about two things–process and behaviors. Thus, the purpose of this current presentation on a whole definition of leadership is to present a whole or complete leadership definition as it exists\n\nWorking as a team, we reviewed l60 articles and books that contained a definition, a scale, or a construct of leadership. While it is likely we did not find every document written, we stopped when we reached “saturation,” consistently finding redundant material in the literature. With each of the 160 documents containing 1 to 25 constructs, or statements, describing or defining leadership we compiled 1,000-plus constructs/statements that we categorized into 91 discrete dimensions and one labeled as miscellaneous (see the Appendix for a list of the dimensions and sources). Since each dimension represents a part of the “elephant,” we needed to assemble the dimensions back to a whole. For research, this integrative definition is problematic in that the next phase of this project required that we build an integrative model of all the dimensions and show how each element affects the others. While it is problematic in that it is difficult to deal with a model of 90+ dimensions, it is imperative that we find a way to do it. Like Kuhn’s (1996) work on scientific revolution explains–when the current paradigms do not explain the observed phenomena it is time for a different approach. Yet, even these 90+ dimensions are not sufficient to understand leadership. While many of the dimensions that occur in an integrative definition are virtuous, we have not had a clear theory of virtuous leadership–until now. To help the reader follow along with the dimensions of this integrative definition we first present the definition by itself and then follow the definition with separate sections examining each key thought in more depth. In this integrative definition we use complex and compound sentences in order to show the connectedness and interrelatedness of the concepts and dimensions.\n\nAn Integrative Definition of Leadership\n\nA leader is one or more people who selects, equips, trains, and influences one or more follower(s) who have diverse gifts, abilities, and skills and focuses the follower(s) to the organization’s mission and objectives causing the follower(s) to willingly and enthusiastically expend spiritual, emotional, and physical energy in a concerted coordinated effort to achieve the organizational mission and objectives. The leader achieves this influence by humbly conveying a prophetic vision of the future in clear terms that resonates with the follower(s) beliefs and values in such a way that the follower(s) can understand and interpret the future into present-time action steps. In this process, the leader presents the prophetic vision in contrast to the present status of the organization and through the use of critical thinking skills, insight, intuition, and the use of both persuasive rhetoric and interpersonal communication including both active listening and positive discourse, facilitates and draws forth the opinions and beliefs of the followers such that the followers move through ambiguity toward clarity of understanding and shared insight that results in influencing the follower(s) to see and accept the future state of the organization as a desirable condition worth committing personal and corporate resources toward its achievement. The leader achieves this using ethical means and seeks the greater good of the follower(s) in the process of action steps such that the follower(s) is/are better off (including the personal development of the follower as well as emotional and physical healing of the follower) as a result of the interaction with the leader. The leader achieves this same state for his/her own self as a leader, as he/she seeks personal growth, renewal, regeneration, and increased stamina–mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual–through the leader-follower interactions.\n\nThe leader recognizes the diversity of the follower(s) and achieves unity of common values and directions without destroying the uniqueness of the person. The leader accomplishes this through innovative flexible means of education, training, support, and protection that provide each follower with what the follower needs within the reason and scope of the organization’s resources and accommodations relative to the value of accomplishing the organization’s objectives and the growth of the follower.\n\nThe leader, in this process of leading, enables the follower(s) to be innovative as well as self-directed within the scope of individual-follower assignments and allows the follower(s) to learn from his/her/their own, as well as others’ successes, mistakes, and failures along the process of completing the organization’s objectives. The leader accomplishes this by building credibility and trust with the followers through interaction and feedback to and with the followers that shapes the followers’ values, attitudes, and behaviors towards risk, failure, and success. In doing this, the leader builds the followers’ sense of self worth and self-efficacy such that both the leader and followers are willing and ready to take calculated risks in making decisions to meet the organization’s goals/objectives and through repeated process steps of risk- taking and decision-making the leader and followers together change the organization to best accomplish the organization’s objectives.\n\nThe leader recognizes the impact and importance of audiences outside of the organization’s system and presents the organization to outside audiences in such a manner that the audiences have a clear impression of the organization’s purpose and goals and can clearly see the purpose and goals lived out in the life of the leader. In so doing, the leader examines the fit of the organization relative to the outside environment and shapes both the organization and the environment to the extent of the leader’s capability to insure the best fit between the organization and the outside environment.\n\nThe leader throughout each leader-follower-audience interaction demonstrates his/her commitment to the values of (a) humility, (b) concern for others, (c) controlled discipline, (d) seeking what is right and good for the organization, (e) showing mercy in beliefs and actions with all people, (f) focusing on the purpose of the organization and on the well-being of the followers, and (g) creating and sustaining peace in the organization–not a lack of conflict but a place where peace grows. These values are the seven Beatitudes found in Matthew 5 and are the base of the virtuous theory of Servant Leadership.\n\nThe Definition in More Detail\n\nThe following sections present the definition in more detail and tie the elements of the definition to past research that is representative, but not exhaustive, of the items in Table 1.\n\nA leader is One or More People…\n\nThe great man theory presents the case that leaders are individuals endowed with great characteristics and heroic abilities. In addition, trait theory describes individual leaders as people who have specific characteristics that help or enable the person to be a good leader. While the great man theory implies that people are somehow endowed with some “essence” of leadership, trait theory provides a base for measurable and testable characteristics such as virtues, race, gender, height, appearance, psychological factors, efficacy factors, cognitive factors, and emotional factors to name a few categories. According to Bass and Stogdill (1990) the focus of both the great man theory and trait theory is on the individual.\n\nHowever, leadership may be provided by a collection of persons (Hambrick, 1987). For example, top management teams represent a group of people who complete all the tasks and processes of leadership but do so as a collective rather than an individual. Traits still apply to leadership teams according to Richard and Shelor (2002), but the literature seems to be silent on the idea of “great” theories in its application to leadership teams. Since a collective of leaders increases the complexity of the leadership process compared to a single leader, the role of traits, as evidenced in research by Carpenter (2002), becomes more important with teams than with individuals.\n\nWho Selects, Equips, Trains, and Influences\n\nSelects… Before employees become followers of the leader(s), it is first necessary to bring the employees into the organization. Collins (2002) posited that a key activity of great leaders is getting the right people “on the bus.” This notion of getting the right people into the organization is explained more fully by the concept of person-organization fit. Person- organization fit can be extended to virtual organizations according to Shin (2004) by examining person-environment fit rather than person-organization fit, thus, the notion of the “right” people for the organization applies whether in a virtual or physical organization.\n\nDePree (1989), as well as Murphy (1996), emphasized the importance of selecting the right people in order to achieve organizational success in the future. This idea was emphasized and strengthened by Chamberlain (2004) in that Chamberlain called for leaders to consider the “calling” or “vocare” that the potential new employee felt and to ensure that the calling could be fulfilled in the organization. Chamberlain’s work ties the person-organization fit concept to the person-job fit concept. These two “fit” concepts are similar but exist in a sequence in that the leader must first select the employee for the organization and then decide with the employee what job is best for the employee. This latter process is what Collins (2002) referred to as getting the right people “in the right seats on the bus.”\n\nBrown, Ledford, and Nathan (1991) along with Kristoff (1996) included the notion of values alignment, or symmetry, of the employees’ values to the organization’s values as a key element in person-organization fit. Support for this idea can be found in McGregor’s (1960) seminal work in that McGregor posited that people would expend as much energy at work as they would at play if the organizations’ values and goals were aligned with their own. It is also the responsibility of the leader according to Arnot (1999) to not allow the alignment or symmetry to become so strong that a cult-like relationship occurs between the follower and the organization.\n\n…Equips… Leaders equip followers by providing appropriate tools, equipment, and other resources so that the followers can be successful in their completion of assigned tasks. This is theoretically defined through Bandura’s (1997) concept of self-efficacy that when moderated by the availability of resources and support of the organization becomes “means efficacy” which is part of general self-efficacy. For more detail on general self-efficacy and means efficacy, see Eden (2001) and Chen, Gulley, and Eden (2001). No matter how capable or efficacious employees/followers are, without sufficient resources it is difficult or impossible to complete the work of the organization.\n\n…Trains… In addition to providing the necessary resources, leaders provide training for followers in order to improve the success of the followers in completing the tasks of the organization. Belasco and Stayer (1994) commented on the importance of providing training but also added the need for helping employees/followers to learn quickly. In turbulent environments such as what Vaill (1996) referred to as permanent white water, the rapid rate and lower predictability of change calls for a requisite change in skills with the speed of change as a factor contributing to overall success of the organization. Maccoby (1981) advocated continuous training not only to prepare the employee/follower for task accomplishment but as a means of increasing the person’s self-efficacy and self-esteem. This notion of improving one’s self-esteem through training was echoed by Spears and Lawrence (2002) as well as Patterson (2002) and Winston (2002).\n\n…And Influences… When new employees have similar values (alignment and/or symmetry) as the organization, have access to the requisite resources, and have the necessary training to do their jobs well, it is not difficult to influence the employee to accomplish the task. This claim is based on the work by Hersey (1997) in which Hersey claimed that if the person is interested in doing the work and has the skills to do the work the leader only needs to direct but not manage in detail. Influence, according to Shartle (1956), as well as Hemphill and Coons (1957), is the process of moving the employee toward the shared employee/organization goals. Capezio and Moorehouse (1997) added to the idea of influence by showing that leaders cause followers to think and feel positively towards the organizations’ goals. According to Tannenbaum, Weschler, and Massarik (1961); Cribbin, (1981); and DuBrin, (1997), all influence occurs through communication whether the communication is in the form of speech, written documents, or demonstrated by behavior. However, leaders influence followers primarily through interpersonal interactions.\n\nAlthough Zaleznik (1992) implied that influencing employees is a clear demonstration of the leader’s power in the organization, Whyte (1943) advocated influence should avoid the invocation of power and relative status. Both Zaleznik and Whyte may be saying the same thing in that power may refer to the power followers give leaders through the follower’s willful compliance to achieve the organization’s goals as directed by the leader. This would fit Whyte’s call to not have to invoke positional power.\n\nOne or More Follower(s) Who Have Diverse Gifts, Abilities, and Skills\n\nAs in the notion that leadership may be by one or more people, organizational followership may be by one or more people, although usually one would consider that a leader or a team of leaders would have more than one follower. The idea of a single follower is important though since leaders consider each follower according to the transformational leadership theory (Bass & Avolio, 1994) as well as the leader-member exchange theory (Scandura & Schriesheim, 1994).\n\n…Gifts… Selecting the right people as well as placing the person in the right job requires that leaders determine the potential employees’ gifts, abilities, and skills. DellaVechio and Winston (2004) posited that the seven motivational gifts presented in the twelfth chapter of the Book of Romans in the New Testament provide a set of gifts that exist as a profile of all seven gifts in each person. Leaders would do well to select people who possess certain gift profiles such that all gifts are represented in the organization to the same extent as exists in the general population, thus giving the organization a balance of the gifts. Also, certain gift mixes align better with certain jobs than do other gift mixes, thus it is wise for leaders to assign people to jobs which are best aligned with the person’s gift mix.\n\n…Abilities… According to the Highlands Company Ability Battery brochure, “Everyone is born with natural abilities regardless of education or experience and that by the age of fourteen the natural abilities of each individual have matured enough to be defined and measured” (Highlands Co.). The Highlands Ability Battery measures 19 natural abilities. While the seven motivational gifts show driving characteristics of the individual, natural abilities define what each person can do easily and well. In addition to the Highlands Ability Battery, the Strong Campbell Interest Battery and other batteries are available for use by leaders when assessing followers.\n\nDarcy and Tracy (2003) emphasized the importance of understanding a person’s abilities. Darcy and Tracy’s work examined the use of vocational interest batteries along with the big five personality tests and cognitive ability tests to help understand the individual. Darcy and Tracy cautioned the user of interest batteries to be aware of social desirableness in which the person taking the battery provides responses that may not be accurate but intend to make the person look good to the test giver.\n\n…And Skills… Pettigrew (1988) included the understanding of employees’ skills and the accurate deployment of employees based on these skills as a strategic tool of the leader. Skills are the function-related knowledge and physical skills that contribute to the success and efficiency in completing tasks.\n\nAnd Focuses the Follower(s) to the Organization’s Mission and Objectives\n\nBass (2000) implied that transformational leaders “move followers to go beyond their own self-interests for the good of their group, organization or community, country or society as a whole” (p. 21). However, Bass later stated that servant leaders “select the needs of others as [their] [highest] priority” (p. 33). Although this seems that Bass’ comment about servant leaders might imply that the servant leader does not focus the followers’ efforts to the achievement of the organization’s mission and objectives, but it would do so if the organizations’ values and mission were in-line with the followers’ values and mission. This alignment is part of McGregor’s (1960) Theory Y and helps bridge the difference in foci between transformational and servant leadership.\n\nInfluence and persuasion are considered by Yukl (1994) as two of the primary functions of leaders. It is presumed in Yukl’s comments that the leader is influencing and persuading followers to work towards the completion of the organization’s mission and objectives. DuBrin (1997) echoed this sentiment in that, according to DuBrin, the leader causes others to act or respond in a shared direction. The presumption here is that DuBrin refers to this “shared direction” as the completion of the organization’s mission.\n\nSince leaders, according to Sadler (1997), Nanus (1989), and Harris (1989), are action- oriented it is logical to presume that this action-orientation, or as Cox and Hoover (1992) would claim as “achievement-orientation,” would be toward the good of the organization. However, it is possible that the focus of the leader might be on self, which would be inline with agency\n\ntheory (Donaldson & Davis, 1991) that predicts leaders, acting as agents, are self-serving and seek to have the employees of the organization meet the needs of the leader. However, for the purpose of this definition of leadership, leaders who seek their own good and not the good of the organization would be classified as “bad” leaders, whereas leaders who focus on the good of the employees and the good of the organization would be classified as “good” leaders. This latter view of leaders is in keeping with the idea of leaders as stewards (Davis, Schoorman, & Donaldson, 1997) in which the leader as steward serves the needs of the organization rather than the needs of the self.\n\nThe notion of the leader focusing the followers toward the organization’s mission and objectives would include the process of strategic planning in which the leader provides guidance (Staub, 1996) and mobilizes followers to shared aspirations regarding the organization (Kouzes & Posner, 1995). According to Jacques and Clement (1994) as well as Ulrich, Zenger, and Smallwood (1999) the leader sets the purpose and direction of the organization and then, according to Shartle (1956) and Seeman (as cited in Rost, 1993) influences the followers toward a shared direction. Hemphill and Coons’ (1957) belief that leaders direct the activities of a group toward shared goals reinforce this contention.\n\nTannenbaum et al. (1961) along with Kotter (1990) and Syrett and Hogg (1992) implied that leaders make frequent use of communication skills to influence followers to align with the organization’s mission and work toward the accomplishment of the organization’s objectives. Heskett and Schlessinger (1996) implied that leaders seek to touch the followers’ hearts, which would fit well into the transformational leadership’s concept of idealistic influence (Bass, 2000) and Kouzes and Posner’s (1995) concept of encouraging the heart. Both idealistic influence and encouraging the heart would be accomplished through rhetoric using formal and informal communication channels.\n\nWhile Crabb (1839) and Zalenik (1992) implied that the leader’s use of influence focuses on the follower’s actions and thoughts, Katz and Kahn (1978) explained that the process of influence went beyond the mechanical compliance with the routine directives of the organization. This notion of going above and beyond the call is aligned with McGregor’s (1960) notion of Theory Y in that followers commit as much energy at work as at play if the values and mission of the organization is the same as the organization. It is the effort above the minimum that leads to exemplary performance.\n\nCausing the Follower(s) to Willingly and Enthusiastically Expend Spiritual, Emotional, and Physical Energy\n\n…Spiritual… This part of the definition relies on McGregor’s (1960) Theory Y concept of the followers willingly expending as much energy at work as at play. In addition, recent research/discussion of spirituality at work (Milliman, Czaplewski, & Ferguson, 2003; Porth, McCall, & Bausch, 1999; Vaill, 1998, 1999) has increased the awareness of and the interest in the spiritual component of followers in organizations. The notion of spiritual, emotional, and physical energy ties to the Greek concept of the three parts of human: (a) spirit, (b) mind, and (c) body.\n\nBurack (1999) specifically tied the importance of spirituality in the workplace to McGregor’s (1960) Theory Y and Ouchi’s (1980) Theory Z. In tying spirituality to these two theories Burack showed the importance of spirituality in the followers’ sense of achievement and\n\nwell-being, thus, tying the leader’s influence on the followers’ spirituality that leads to increased follower-innovation.\n\n…Emotional… The leader seeks to cause the follower to expend emotional, or affective, energy toward the organization’s objectives, which is similar to what Kouzes and Posner (1990) referred to as encouraging the heart. When the follower has passion toward the completion of the organization’s objectives, the follower has greater commitment toward achieving the objectives. Recent work on hope in the organization by Avolio, Gardner, Walumbwa, Luthans, and May (2004); Reed and Winston (2005); and Winston, Bekker, Cerff, and Reed (2004) showed the importance of Snyder’s (Shorey & Snyder, 2004) hope theory to the leader-follower interaction. According to Shorey and Snyder, hope is evident in both goal-direction and pathway thinking by followers. Winston, Bekker, Cerff, and Reed (2004) added to this understanding by tying the notion of hope to followers’ desires to expend energy through the use of Vroom’s (1964/1994) expectancy in that followers consciously and specifically think about the probability of achieving a reward if the physical energy is expended and if the reward will be of real value to the follower. It is this emotional energy focused on the reward (intrinsic or extrinsic) and the belief that the reward can be achieved that helps drive the follower toward completing the organization’s objectives.\n\n…Physical… Vroom’s (1964/1994) expectancy theory contains with it the notion of physical effort or task direction in that the follower seeks to achieve the objective through physical effort. This same notion exists in many motivational theories such as Locke and Lathan’s (1990) goal-setting theory, House’s (1996) path-goal theory, as well as, Yukl’s (1994) multiple-linkage model. Task is central to many, if not all, motivational theories in that the focus of motivation, or influence, or persuasion is to motivate followers to achieve organizational objectives.\n\nThis physical energy can and usually is done in coordination with other followers according to DuBrin (1997) and Waitley (1995) as well as Prentice (1961) who described the role of the leader as one who accomplishes a goal through the direction of human assistants by gaining collaboration among followers. While this integrative definition has over 90 elements in it, the comprehension of the definition has to see the integrated whole. For example, the marshalling of followers’ physical efforts can only be successful if the values of the organization and the followers are aligned and that sufficient training has occurred to insure adequate competence (Jaques & Clement, 1994).\n\nIn a Concerted Coordinated Effort to Achieve the Organizational Mission and Objectives.\n\nThe notion of collaboration mentioned above helps frame the leader’s efforts to achieve a concerted coordinated effort by followers. The metaphors of conductor (Wis, 2002) and jazz band leader (DePree, 1993) help explain this part of the definition. When the organization is best served by a mechanistic high degree of direction then the metaphor of conductor is appropriate in that the followers, like the members of a symphony go about their tasks in a very prescribed standard manner with all followers doing exactly what the conductor requests. But, when the organization is best served by a flexible more open style of leadership then the notion of a jazz band leader helps explain how followers go about the execution of their tasks in a manner that allows each follower to express behaviors in a manner that includes personal expression but at the same time fluidly meshing with the other followers.\n\nBoth forms of leadership produce a concerted coordinated expression of follower behaviors although each form occurs in a very different manner. While the two metaphors are extremely different the value of the metaphors could be expressed in various degrees of difference. The environment is a key element in deciding which form should be used. Stable predictable environments where opportunities are not considered important in short time frames would be more suitable for the symphony conductor metaphor whereas an environment that is unpredictable and opportunistic would be better served by the jazz band metaphor. The leader’s level of trust (Essex & Kusy, 1999; McGee-Cooper & Trammell, 1995) and confidence (Giblin, 1986) in the followers also would play a role in that lower levels of trust and confidence would support the symphony conductor metaphor while higher levels of trust and confidence would support the jazz band leader metaphor.\n\nDeming (1986) posited that a major problem for leaders and organizations was each follower doing his/her best. While this seems illogical that people should not do their best it makes sense when considering the need for a concerted coordinated effort. Followers must work together in a balanced method in order to achieve the greatest collective level of effectiveness.\n\nWhile individuals may not be able to perform to their individual bests, the whole of the organization achieves more when everyone works together. Systems theory contributes to the understanding of a concerted coordinated effort in that a system is a collection of integrated and coordinated processes and subsystems working in harmony to achieve stated objectives. Buzan, Dottino, and Israel (1999) as well as Daft and Lengel (1998) included in their discussions of leadership the requirement of leaders to build group synergy and a sense of unity that ties well to the notion of a concerted coordinated effort. In addition, work by Kouzes and Posner (1995), Cox and Hoover (1992), Kanter (1997), and Jacobson (2000) emphasized the idea that leaders work to foster collaboration among followers by presenting and promoting cooperative goals as well as helping followers to understand how to collaborate.\n\nThe Leader Achieves this Influence by Humbly Conveying a Prophetic Vision of the Future in Clear Terms that Resonates with the Follower(s) Beliefs and Values\n\nSmith and Zepp (1998) along with Moldovan (1999) in their studies of Martin Luther King, Jr. compared King to Ghandi and pointed out that both leaders presented a description of the future to their followers in terms that caused followers to see both leaders as humble, yet intense about their beliefs. This is in keeping with Collins’ (2002) determination that great leaders are humble but have fierce resolve toward the organization’s vision.\n\nBower (1997) claimed that business CEO’s, to be effective, need to move from a management-based orientation to a leadership-based orientation in which the leader can gain trust, exercise justice, and have the confidence to be humble. Bower’s comment is more telling than is evident on the surface. Leaders need to be confident in order to be humble. This seems like a paradox in that confidence might be more logically tied to pride than to humility, but it is, in fact, a sense of confidence that removes the fear that so often prevents the leader from being humble. Little has been written on the notion of leaders and humility and is possibly why humility is a key element in the emergence of servant leadership and authentic leadership conceptual models showing up in the literature now. Avolio et al. (2004) pointed out that\n\n“humble servants of their followers engage the deepest levels of commitment” (p. 18). Both servant leadership and authentic leadership concepts embrace the notion of humility in leaders.\n\nDaft and Lengel (1998) posited that leaders must create an image in the minds of the followers that the followers belong to something bigger and more important than just an individual job. This can be done through the use of rhetoric and picturesque speech creating an image in the mind of the follower as to what the future could be if the followers work to achieve the described future. This is supported by both DePree (1989) and Chatterjee (1998) who stated that leaders define and express reality. Schein (1992) claimed this can be accomplished if the leader demonstrates extraordinary levels of perception as insight into the realities of the world.\n\nBy describing a preferable future (Bell, 1997) the leader can present the desired future in contrast to the present. This allows the leader to develop a sense of dissatisfaction with the present in the followers’ minds. Kanter (1996) stated that part of the role of the leader is to see new possibilities, and Kotter (1990) added to this by saying that a role of the leader is to communicate new directions to the followers. Bradshaw (1998) continued the clarification by adding that leaders enable continuous change and movement toward some desired destination. The role of the leader in this process was emphasized by Tichy and Devanna (1990) who showed that effective leaders must see themselves as change agents. Yeung and Ready (1995) added the notion of “strategic change” to the role of leaders thus emphasizing the conscious focus of the leader on the direction of change.\n\nChange can be uncomfortable for people and to this end Murphy (1996) implied that leaders have a responsibility to heal wounds that are inflicted by change. The idea of healing will be discussed later in the definition but needs to be presented here as well in that the actions of the leader can be a contributing cause of pain, discomfort, and wounding. While it is sometimes necessary to create discomfort as a predecessor to change, the leader needs to be observant and ready to assist in the healing process.\n\nCaroselli (2000), Taffinder (1997), Conger and Kanungo (1998), as well as Kouzes and Posner (1995) emphasized the need for the leader to challenge the status quo, both of the current state of the organization and the processes by which the organization achieves its objectives.\n\nIdeas and concepts are sometimes best presented through the use of rhetoric, picturesque speech, metaphors, similes, and poetic language. Miles (1997), Kotter (1990), along with Tannenbaum et al. (1961) described the leader as someone who uses the communication process and rhetoric as a means of influencing followers. Heskett and Schlesinger (1996) implied that leaders need to communicate in such a manner as to touch the heart of followers. This is a characteristic of charismatic leaders according to Bass and Avolio (1994) but it is necessary that the leader use this characteristic judiciously so as to not create a corporate cult (Arnott, 1999).\n\nSuch that the Follower(s) can Understand and Interpret the Future into Present-time Action Steps.\n\nIt is important for leaders to not only speak the vision but also that followers can understand what to do in order to make the vision become a reality. This requires the followers to move the image of the vision into tactical steps that can be accomplished in the short- to medium-term. Terry (1993) and Moxley (2000) both, but in different terms, indicated that the role of the leader includes the ability to call forth authentic action by followers and to determine strategies that followers can execute in order to achieve the organization’s vision.\n\nWhile little empirical research has been done on the notion of followers creating present- time action steps, conceptual writings exist from researchers such as Bennis (1989) who proposed that a role of the leader is to give direction to vision and ideas so that followers can work on achieving the vision. In addition to Bennis, Ulrich et al. (1999) called for leaders to set direction so that the vision could become a reality. Kotter (1990) and Kanter (1995) both independently called for similar leadership efforts in that the leader should establish a direction. This can best be done by helping the followers see what must be done in the short and intermediate-term through strategies and tactics to achieve the vision.\n\nKent, Crotts, and Aziz (2001) presented a description of the leader as one who marshals, energizes, and unifies people toward the pursuit of the vision. Beck and Yeager (2001) added to the idea of marshalling by stating that leaders need to challenge people to reach to a vision. The idea of followers actively working to achieve the vision goes beyond the concept of inspirational motivation, as described in transformational leadership, or the motivational rhetoric of charismatic leaders. Followers have to “see” the incremental steps that connect the present to the future with each follower understanding his/her individual role in the concerted coordinated effort.\n\nIn this Process, the Leader Presents the Prophetic Vision in Contrast to the Present Status of the Organization\n\nThe field of futures studies includes the concepts of past-present-future or hindsight- insight-foresight as a means of relating and connecting the past as a cause agent for the present and how present actions influence and affect the future. Futurists use the terms possible futures, probable futures, and preferable futures to help distinguish between what could occur, what might occur, and what is the desirable future. While futurists do not claim to be able to predict the future, futurists do claim that within limits, strategies and tactics can work to affect a desirable future. Environmental forces and wild card events (unanticipated climatic events) may hinder or promote the achievement of the preferable future. The leader presents the preferable future as the vision of the organization and emphasizes how the future differs from the present in order to create a sense in the followers’ minds of dissatisfaction with the present. This promotes the followers’ commitment of spiritual, emotional, and physical energy toward the realization of the vision. For, if the vision is similar to the present, there is little reason to commit energy beyond the maintenance level.\n\nStipek (1988), although writing about what prevents motivation rather than how to motivate, touched on the concept of showing the future as different from the present in that Stipek pointed out that people will not be motivated to work toward future goals unless there is a difference between the present and future and unless the present activities are shown as being related to the attainment of future goals. Callahan (2002) contended that it is not so much “dissatisfaction” with the present but, rather, “discontent” with the present relative to a preferred future that motivates people to behave.\n\nBeckhard and Harris (1987) provided more depth into this notion of dissatisfaction as they used Gleicher’s model:\n\nDissatisfaction x Vision x First Steps > Resistance to Change\n\nto show how dissatisfaction and vision and the clarity of action steps work collectively to reduce the resistance to change. Since Gleicher’s model uses multipliers in the right-hand side of the equation, if any of the three variables is missing then the right-hand side of the equation falls to zero, thus, showing that all three elements must be present.\n\nAnd through the Use of Critical Thinking Skills, Insight, Intuition, and the Use of Both Persuasive Rhetoric and Interpersonal Communication including both Active Listening and Positive Discourse, Facilitates and Draws Forth the Opinions and Beliefs of the Followers\n\nIn prior paragraphs this integrative definition has referred to the leader’s communication skills and this current part of the definition looks at the leader’s communication skills preceded by critical thinking and logic. Although communication permeates the leader’s day-to-day behaviors it is at this point of the integrative definition that it is emphasized.\n\n…Critical thinking skills… Critical thinking skills include the concepts of logic and reasoning the leader uses to evaluate facts, build information from facts, and hopefully, derive wisdom as to the meaning of the environmental factors. Critical thinking skills include the ability to build and discern inductive or deductive arguments, to determine if the data is qualitative or quantitative and how much reliance can be placed on any argument. Cederblom and Paulsen (1997) explained the ability to build an argument using systematic methods as well as the ability to interpret an argument and recognize how the argument was built is a key factor in superior communication.\n\nThe reason the leader needs critical thinking skills is that higher levels of critical thinking skills are predecessors to higher abilities to form persuasive arguments as presented by Cederblom and Paulsen (1997) and noted in the lives of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ghandi by Moldovan (1999). Novelli and Sylvester (1993) contended that “Critical thinking facilitates cast problems in ways that point to non-obvious solutions” (pp. 142-143), which would precede the communication of solutions or the group-development of solutions.\n\n…Insight… Schein (1992) emphasized the need for insight by declaring that leaders need to demonstrate extraordinary levels of perception and insight into the realities of the world. This notion was also a premise of Wadsworth (1997) who included insightful thinking in the description of great leaders. Argyris (1993) implied insight is important for leaders but not sufficient, in that, according to Argyris, double-loop learning is a problem-based method that does not rely on insight alone; yet, Argyris implied that insight is important for leaders.\n\nSenge (1990) implied insight when he posited leaders must have the capacity to help bring forth new realities for followers. Insight is a precursor for innovation and creativity due to new understandings, or deeper understandings, of the phenomena around the leader that cause the leader to develop new approaches to problems and opportunities. The American Heritage Dictionary provides two definitions for “insight”: (a) the discovery of what was previously hidden and (b) the ability to grasp the true nature of a situation. Leaders follow the latter definition as they seek to understand the nature of things and the deeper premises and causes of systems’ behavior.\n\n…Intuition… Intuition is similar to insight but relies on less empirical evidence. While insight determines the true nature of a situation, intuition is, according to The American Heritage\n\nDictionary, the act of knowing or sensing without the use of rational processes. Thus, intuition is more of a trait rather than a learned skill. However, Kerfoot (2003) would disagree with the notion that intuition is not a learned trait, although the definition and use of intuition by Kerfoot is more inline with insight. The similarity of insight and intuition leads to difficulty in working with the concepts. For example, the leader who sees the underlying nature of a situation but is unaware of the cognitive processes at work in finding the underlying nature may attribute the finding to intuition rather than insight. Intuition may be a subtle version of insight. Kerfoot and other writers such as Truman (2003) write about intuition in the nursing practice. Truman linked intuition to experience and relied on Hansten and Washburn’s (2000) definition of intuition to “define intuition as a ‘clinical sensing’ based on experience and accumulated knowledge but not always supported by logical evidence” (p. 185) that shows the similarity and differences between insight and intuition. Janesick (2001) added to the notion of the relatedness of insight and intuition by defining intuition as “a way of knowing about the world through insight and exercising one’s imagination” (p. 532), thus showing insight as a subset of intuition.\n\nPerhaps the most researched idea of intuition comes from Jung’s psychological archetypes that form the base for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). One of the MBTI’s four dimensions is the sensing-intuition dimension. Of interest, though, little research, according to Bass and Stogdill (1990) show a preponderance of either the S or the N types among effective leaders. Jung claimed that intuition was a form of perception via the unconscious. This may possibly be a result of the 75-25% occurrence of sensing–intuition in the general population and that there are many applications for details-focused sensors in leadership as there are big picture- focused intuitionist in leadership. The focus for this integrative is that leaders need both insight and intuition to be the most effective.\n\n…Persuasive rhetoric… Rhetoric is the process of using language effectively, and persuasive rhetoric is the process of effective persuasion. A review of the literature on leadership and rhetoric implies to the observer that rhetoric is more in the domain of political communication than general communication, and it should not be restrained to the political arena. If rhetoric is about the effective use of language and leaders use language (written, spoken, aesthetic, non-verbal, etc.), then leaders must continually engage in the practice. Gellis (2002) goes further to imply that the study of leadership should be done through a rhetorical lens.\n\n…Interpersonal communication… Tannenbaum et al. (1961) implied leaders communicate in one-to-one or one-to-few situations. Kacmar, Witt, Zivnuska, and Gully (2003) confirmed the value of interpersonal communication in a study that showed a relationship between higher job performance and more frequent communication with the supervisor. Their study also showed lower levels of job performance with less frequent communication with the supervisor. Lee (2001) added to the breadth of the value of interpersonal communication by concluding from his study that followers in high-quality leader-member exchange relationships perceived greater fairness in distributive justice that, in turn, led to followers’ perception that communication between leaders and followers in the work groups was more cooperative.\n\nCampbell, White, and Johnson (2003) posited that leader-follower rapport is a cause of both positive and negative interpersonal communication. To this end, this integrative definition references the positive side of interpersonal communication in that leaders, while not ignoring mass communication, must use one-to-one and one-to-few communication methods to clearly present to the follower what needs to be presented in a manner that helps the follower understand and contribute to the achievement of the organization’s objectives.\n\n…Active listening… Active listening is the process of hearing the follower’s emotions and intent as well as the spoken words. Rutter (2003) conducted an active-listening intervention in a British boat building firm as a means of changing the leader-follower interaction that hopefully would lead to improved job performance. The results of the intervention showed that performance did increase as did the quality of leader-follower relationships.\n\nMcGee-Cooper and Trammell (1995) proposed that leaders should engage in deep and respectful listening in order to fully understand the followers’ ideas and thoughts. Deming (1986) added to this by implying that leaders should listen to followers without judging the quality or intent of the message until hearing the full message. By not passing judgment as the follower speaks, according to Michalko (2001), creativity is more likely to occur in followers.\n\n…Positive discourse… Positive discourse, such as what Cooperrider and Srivastva (1987) proposed in their Appreciative Inquiry approach to action research helps create a positive environment in which followers can comfortably express themselves as the following quote from McManaman (2005) illustrates:\n\nWe have the power to sow a spirit of anxiety, or fear, or anger, or joy into the hearts of listeners by the words we choose to employ. Indeed, our words express an attitude that is within, and they bring a portion of that interior world of ours to those to whom they are addressed. We are, however, affected further by the quality of our words–we are either the first beneficiary or first victim of the words we utter. That is why we ought to be especially careful of the words we speak over ourselves.\n\nThrough the use of positive discourse leaders can establish an environment of joy and as McManaman noted, become the first beneficiary of the communication. Deming (1986) would concur with McManaman in that Deming declared that one of the tasks of leadership is to create joy in the workplace.\n\n…Draws forth the opinions and beliefs of the followers… It is through active listening and positive discourse that followers feel free to express their opinions and beliefs. Followers choose to be innovative and to present/explain their innovation because followers want to. By creating an environment that is without fear, followers are willing to express themselves according to Ryan and Oestreich (1998). By creating an environment in which followers are willing to express themselves the organization benefits from the increased number of ideas and insights. Sims (2005), in a critique of Donald Trump’s leadership style on the television show The Apprentice, stated, “Effective leaders encourage followers to speak their mind; they don’t demand blind obedience.”\n\nIn addition to innovation, when the leader can draw forth the beliefs of the followers the leader can check to see the values of followers and the leader are aligned, which ties back to the earlier values alignment subsection of this integrated definition. Although leaders may not enjoy hearing dissent among followers, when leaders encourage followers to express their opinions problems in the organization can be revealed and resolved.\n\nSuch that the Followers Move through Ambiguity toward Clarity of Understanding and Shared Insight\n\nAmbiguity occurs when there is a lack of clear direction by the leader or by the decision- making process. Eisenberg (1984) posited that ambiguity is a necessary component for creative problem solving; however, for followers to understand how to act in order to achieve the future state of the organization’s vision, it is necessary for the follower, with, or without, the help of the leader to work through ambiguity and achieve clarity of action. As part of the creative problem- solving process the followers have to resolve role ambiguity so that the employees as a whole can work in a concerted effort. This means that followers have to be comfortable with the idea of different and ever-changing roles in a volatile every changing environment, such as Vaill (1998) would call “permanent whitewater.” This becomes a systems issue when the employee’s family is included as an environmental variable and is incorporated in the idea of work-family and family-work conflict (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985).\n\nThat Results in Influencing the Follower(s) to See and Accept the Future State of the Organization as a Desirable Condition Worth Committing Personal and Corporate Resources toward its Achievement.\n\nThe prior subsections all lead to this summative result–followers committed to working toward the accomplishment of the organization’s objectives.\n\nThe Leader Achieves this Using Ethical Means and Seeks the Greater Good of the Follower(s) in the Process of Action Steps such that the Follower(s) is/are Better off (including the Personal Development of the Follower as well as Emotional and Physical Healing of the Follower) as a Result of the Interaction with the Leader.\n\nSyrett and Hogg (1992) implied that leaders should emphasize ethics while Stettner (2000) contended that leaders must have ethics. While it may seem that Stettner, Syrett, and Hogg may be saying the same thing, it may be essential here to infer that leaders should first have ethics and then emphasize ethics in order to increase the level of the authenticity. Crosby (1997) added to this idea of the leader’s ethics in that the leader should enforce ethical conduct in the organization. These three elements of having ethics, emphasizing ethics, and enforcing ethics tie to Ulrich et al.’s (1999) as well as Kanter’s (1995) contention that leaders need to have integrity and show that the espoused theories are the same as the practiced theories in the leader’s life.\n\n…Seeks the greater good of the follower(s)… Transformational leadership as presented by Bass and Avolio (1994) implies that leaders lead followers to levels of higher morals. In addition, transformational leadership implies that the followers are better off with the four I’s of\n\n(a) inspirational motivation, (b) idealized influence, (c) individualized consideration, and (d) intellectual stimulation.\n\nBass and Steidlmeier (1998) argued that “to be truly transformational leadership, it must be grounded in moral foundations” (abstract), and that through authentic transformational leadership “both the leader and the led are transformed–sharply changed in performance and outlook” (para 20). Of interest though is Bass’ (2000) contention that while transformational leaders seek to improve and influence the followers the leader’s motive is to benefit the organization but that in servant leadership theories the leader’s motive is to benefit the follower. Patterson (2002) and Winston (2003) both implied that servant leaders will seek the benefit of the followers even at the expense of the organization.\n\n…As well as emotional and physical healing of the follower… The notion of healing is expressed in two forms: Spears and Lawrence (2002), who advocated physical healing possibly needed as a result of stress or a debilitating illness, and a contrast to Murphy (1996), who emphasized the role of the leader in healing wounds inflicted by change. This sentiment of healing is echoed by Kerfoot (1999), who said that “the environment in which people work must be one of healing and not anger, competition or lack of support” (p. 106). Kerfoot went on to say that for this healing environment to occur the leader must use holistic rather than mechanistic thinking. Writing about patient care facilities, Kerfoot claimed that “excellence in patient care thrives in settings where the souls of the caregivers, patients, and families can all grow” (p. 106).\n\nGreenleaf (1970) wrote that healing is one of the ten characteristics of a servant leader, and he indicated that within the servant leadership model there is the opportunity for healing the leader and the followers of broken spirits and emotional damage. This notion of healing and restoration to health ties to transformational leadership in which both the leader and follower are better off because of the leader-follower interaction.\n\nThe Leader Achieves this Same State for Him/Herself as He/She Seeks Personal Growth, Renewal, Regeneration, and Increased Stamina–Mental, Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual– through the Leader-Follower Interactions.\n\nThis part of the definition flows logically from the prior section in that the literature cited in the prior section shows that both the leader and follower benefit from the action. While servant leadership may imply that the leader sacrifices the “self” for the follower, this part of the definition implies that the leader must also benefit from the interaction and that if sacrifice occurs, there is a balance in what is gained. This may take the form of financial or time sacrificed by the leader that in return yields gains in intrinsic rewards for the leader. Transformational leadership implies, according to Burns (1978), that both the leader and the follower lift each other to higher levels of morality and motivation.\n\nThe Leader Recognizes the Diversity of the Follower(s) and Achieves Unity of Common Values and Directions without Destroying the Uniqueness of the Person.\n\nTerry (1993) helped support this focus on diversity by pointing out the value of deep diversity that exists across the breadth of the human community. A particularly poignant quote from Terry’s work is “Unity should give us access to diversity; it should never seek to make diversity irrelevant” (p. 5). The obviousness of diversity is all around us, and its existence is hard to ignore. Deming (1986) pointed out that people are different from each other. This seems to be a statement of the obvious but is also the crux of the problems that leaders encounter. Leaders need to first recognize that people are different and that these differences in gifts, abilities, and skills referenced earlier in this integrative definition are what provide the requisite resources for the achievement of the organization’s goals (Fitz-enz, 1997). Smith (1996) made this statement emphatically in that leaders should not only seek, but cherish diversity.\n\nBut what of diversity in values? Here is where the “yes, but…” comes into play. The definition states that there must be a unity of common values and directions. This begins with the earlier part of the definition in that leaders must select people to work in the organization whose values are aligned with the values of the organization. McDonald and Gantz (1992) referred to followers establishing a psychological attachment to the organization when the values are aligned. This integrative definition presumes that where there is a psychological attachment between leader and followers there is a tolerance for the differences other than values. Leaders have the task of using the followers’ diverse gifts, abilities, and skills to achieve the organization’s objectives without the unintended consequence of conforming to the non-value- based characteristics of the follower. This requires active management by the leader to insure that diverse followers show respect and acceptance of the followers that are different in one way or another.\n\nThe Leader Accomplishes this through Innovative Flexible Means of Education, Training, Support, and Protection\n\nThere is a difference between education and training as well as between support and protection. The leader uses all four elements to prepare followers to work towards meeting the needs of the organization while also preparing the followers for life in general.\n\n…Education… Education is the process of gaining insight and understanding about life. Education focuses on the intellection understanding of the world around us rather than how to do tasks. In addition to this general understanding, education should also focus on critical thinking skills such that followers can engage in creative problem solving. Critical thinking skills include the ability to form the question and issue under review (Cederblom & Paulsen, 1997). Lombardo and Eichinger (1999) posited that leaders should be able to think through problems and Harung, Alexander, and Heaton (1999) added to this notion by proposing that leaders should possess excellent critical thinking skills. If leaders should possess critical thinking skills how much more effective will the whole organization be if followers possess critical thinking skills as well.\n\n…Training… Training, in contrast to education, seeks to help the person perform tasks better–more efficiently and more effectively. Training is specific whereas education is general. Cross (1996) made an interesting, albeit provocative, distinction between education and training in that a set of parents may be glad that their daughter is engaging in sex education in school but may not be pleased to learn that their daughter is engaging in sex training in school. Education helps the employee understand “about” the topic whereas training helps the employee “do.” Training involves personal involvement and completion of actions with the goal of increasing both the effectiveness and efficiency of task completion at the end of the training session. Training may not always requires hands-on activity during the training session but would prepare the employee to engage in self-directed hands-on activity following the training session. For example, employees may receive training in how to set a computer calendar function to remind them of upcoming events, and the employee would engage in the hands-on portion after returning to his/her office and his/her own computer.\n\n…Support… Support occurs in two forms: (a) physical/financial resources including time and (b) perceived organizational support that is more affective in nature. For the first form of support leaders must provide employees with the resources to pursue both education and training. This includes financial support for tuition, books, travel, and other requisite elements as well as sufficient time (release from work assignments) to successfully complete the education and training. This, as noted in the next section of the definition is balanced against the available resources of the organization and the value of the education/training to the organization. While it may be of benefit for an employee of a 40-employee organization to complete a bachelor’s degree in marketing, it may not be of benefit for an employee to complete a Ph.D. in marketing. The leader has the responsibility to communicate to the followers what resources are available and how the resources may be requested.\n\nThe second form of support, the affective notion of perceived organizational support (POS), as articulated by Rhoades and Eisenberger (2002) in their review of the POS literature, imply that POS is a form of social exchange in which followers ascribe human-like characteristics to the organization and presume that leaders, acting as agents/stewards of the organization, when giving promotions, pay increases, and other rewards for reasons other than externally controlled, such as unions and federal requirement, do so as a means of building goodwill and meeting the followers’ socio-emotional needs. There is reciprocity of effect here in that followers seek to meet the needs of the organizational leaders, acting as agents/stewards of the organization as well. With regard to POS and training, Wayne, Shore, and Liden’s (1997) study showed that training, when presented to followers by the leaders as a discretionary practice resulted in an increase perceived organizational support by the followers.\n\n…Protection… Tied to the affective notion of perceived organizational support is the notion of protecting followers from external agencies, even within the organization. The leader may have to be a buffer between followers and the higher-level authorities in the organization in much the way that a military sergeant may buffer the enlisted soldiers from the officers. While in a perfect world all would work to the good of all, our organizations are fraught with demands upon the time and resources of our employees that may not be of real benefit to the employees, and it is the role of the leader to reduce the impact upon followers from outside interference.\n\nWhile there are some major protection issues that leaders might face such as reducing the impact of layoffs and mergers, most of the protection issues are small events that occur on a weekly or monthly process such as reducing time wasted in meetings, asking employees to do non-value- added work, etc.\n\nThat Provide each Follower with what the Follower Needs within the Reason and Scope of the Organization’s Resources and Accommodations Relative to the Value of Accomplishing the Organization’s Objectives and the Growth of the Follower.\n\n…Within reason… The leader examines the follower’s requests and determines what he/she can provide relative to cost/benefit relationship. For example, if an employee needs a new car to make sales calls and the sales that result from the use of the car yield less than the value of the car, the provision of the car is not a reasonable decision. The leader has an obligation to provide information to the follower regarding the reasonableness of the decision and how the leader reached the decision.\n\n…Scope… The leader has to consider the request for resources within the scope of the organization’s operations. If providing the resource moves the organization, or contributes toward moving the organization away from the focus and scope that the organization stated as its goal, then the resource should not be given. Thus, the leader has to consider the request in light of how the resource “fits” the organization.\n\n…Organization’s resources… Leaders must be aware of the resources that the organization has or has access to and according to Rusaw (2001) organize a wide range of resources. Bradshaw (1998) referred to this process as an “art” that the leader crafts through the process of acquiring, linking, and focusing resources on the organization’s objectives. Waitley (1995) intensified this focus by referring to leaders as “champions” of resources; however, resources for on-going operations are not the limit of the leader’s focus. Kanter (1996) suggested that leaders need to provide resources for process innovation and Fitz-enz (1997) added to this by calling on leaders to provide the resources needed for continuous improvement.\n\n…Value of accomplishing the organization’s objectives and the growth of the follower. This part of the definition calls for the leader to weigh the value to the organization against the value to the follower. This is in contrast to the statement in the earlier section referring to cost/benefit analysis and provides the decision point that separates transactional/transformational leaders from servant leaders. Recall earlier in this document that servant leaders seek the good of the follower over the good of the organization. There may be times when the leader decides to allocate resources that do not meet the cost/benefit analysis of value to the organization, but the leader knows that the follower will gain from the experience of using the resource(s). This relates to the earlier statement in the definition that the follower and the leader must be better off because of the leader-follower interaction. However, this does mean that the leader ignores the principles of stewardship but rather that the leader carefully considers the merits of providing the resource(s) requested from all possible viewpoints.\n\nThe Leader, in this Process of Leading, Enables the Follower(s) to be Innovative as well as Self- Directed within the Scope of Individual-Follower Assignments and Allows the Follower(s) to Learn from His/Her/Their Own, as Well as Others’ Successes, Mistakes, and Failures along the Process of Completing the Organization’s Objectives.\n\nThis part of the definition looks at how the leader’s behaviors help develop followers to be more productive and self-directed.\n\n…Innovative… Innovation is the process of taking new ideas that develop through creative processes and producing new products, services, processes, methods, etc. Since innovation only occurs at the discretion of the follower (no studies were found that indicated that innovation could be forced or coerced from followers) it seems logical that the leader must create an environment in which followers are encouraged and supported to try new ideas, thus the reference in the definition to mistakes and failures so that the follower is not afraid of taking risks. But, note in the definition that this willingness to take risks may be limited to the scope of the assigned work areas.\n\nThe notion of the need for innovation is supported by Buzan et al. (1999) who implied that an innovative workforce can help the organization distinguish itself from the rest of the industry and increase the competitive edge in the global economy. The idea of the leader needing to be creative in order to help encourage followers to be creative is endorsed by Bennis (1997) and Bennis and Goldsmith (1997) as well as Harung et al. (1999).\n\nIn addition to developing new products/services for the global marketplace, innovation can be of value in solving problems within the organization. Snyder, Dowd, and Houghton (1994) implied that the fresh ideas which emerge from brainstorming and creative thinking as well as critical thinking (Harung et al., 1999) helped solve long-standing problems and open issues in the organization. This is supported by Cox and Hoover (1992), Lombardo and Eichinger (1996), and Kanter (1995) who endorsed the idea of seeing problems from new angles as a means of increasing insight.\n\n…Self-directed… Sims and Manz’s (1995) concept of self-leadership fits well with this part of the definition due to the followers becoming more self-reliant and more productive as they progress toward self-leadership. According to Manz and Neck (2004) self-leadership is a process in which leaders exercise self-influence to motivate and direct personal behavior in all aspects of their lives. This, in other words, creates the ultimate form of intrinsic motivation and removes the need for extrinsic rewards.\n\nIn addition to the notion of self-directed leadership, followers can and should become self-directed learners. This is one of the requirements of a learning organization in that learning occurs through individuals by individuals and shared in the organizational community. Self- directed learning, according to Knowles (1975), occurs when followers who initiate learning processes learn more and learn better than followers who wait passively for someone to teach them what they need to know and followers who initiate learning processes and see improvement as a result increase their sense of confidence and competence.\n\n…To learn… The literature offers advice and research findings for leaders with regard to being concerned for the growth and capability of followers (Eales-White, 1998; Jacobs, 1997; Shelton, 1997; Spears & Lawrence, 2002) and encourages followers to learn (Belasco & Stayer, 1994; DePree, 1989; Syrett & Hogg, 1992). The purpose of transformational leadership’s factor of intellectual stimulation may be a step towards the overall learning of the follower (Bass & Avolio, 1994). Giblin (1986), Waitley (1995), and Deming (1986) supported the notion of both the leader and the follower achieving higher levels of knowledge.\n\n…Mistakes and failures… McGee-Cooper and Trammell (1995) made the claim that the leader needs to create an environment in which the follower feels safe to make mistakes and to learn from those mistakes. In addition, Kanter (1995), Smith (1996), as well as Kouzes and Posner (1995) implied that followers should be allowed to learn from both mistakes and successes.\n\nThe Leader Accomplishes this by Building Credibility and Trust with the Followers through Interaction and Feedback to and with the Followers that Shapes the Followers’ Values, Attitudes, and Behaviors towards Risk, Failure, and Success.\n\nThis part of the definition builds on the prior sections and shows how credibility and trust develop/evolve rather than being required. It is the safety and comfort of credibility and trust that followers’ values can be shaped.\n\n…Credibility… Kouzes and Posner (1993), in discussing the behavioral aspects of credibility, stated that credible leaders do what they say they will do. Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount, called for people to make there “yes a yes and their no a no.” This is the base of credibility–to be reliable. To know that you can believe what you hear. Through repeated observations of the leader doing what he/she says that he/she will do, the follower begins to trust the leader. Trust begins in small amounts and increases over time with positive experiences and decreases over time with negative experiences.\n\nFollowers’ willingness to increase efforts toward the completion of the organization’s objectives increases as the followers’ belief that the leader will provide the offered and requisite support increases. As each experience occurs in the organization the followers evaluate the past and determine the level of faith in the leader’s future action. It is this faith that becomes trust.\n\n…Trust… As experiences produce observations with positive, and expected, outcomes and as observations of the leader’s credibility results in greater faith in the future, outcomes of the leader’s intention to behave, the followers’ level of trust grows. Likewise, if experiences do not produce expected, credible outcomes, then the followers’ level of faith in the leader declines. Bennis (1997) admonished leaders that it is the role of the leader to inspire and generate trust, and Kouzes and Posner (1993) provided the behavioral methods for accomplishing this as leaders doing what they say they will do. In this fashion, it seems that followers “ascribe” trust to the leader as the leader “earns” the trust through repeated credible behaviors. Deming (1986) wrote that leaders create an environment that encourages trust and in doing so builds a culture in which accountability (Wood & Winston, 2005) allows for the public disclosure of the leader’s behavior and the organizational expectation of consequences to be a result of that behavior.\n\nSonnenberg (1994) posited that when trust is high in an organization morale is higher, turnover is lower, performance is higher, information is shared more freely, criticism is accepted more freely without retaliation and innovative ideas are more frequent. Sonnenberg cautioned, though, that trust does not come about easily. Trust must be “sought, nurtured and reinforced” (p. 14) and, he added, can be destroyed by a single negative event. Followers, who make themselves vulnerable and experience negative results, tend to reduce trust at a faster rate than they build trust.\n\nThe followers’ act of “trusting” results in condition of vulnerability for the follower just as an act of faith leaves a person vulnerable to the possibility of the faith being placed erroneously and necessitating the acceptance of the repercussions of the leader not performing as expected (credible). Gregersen (2003) assisted this connection of trust with faith and risk of negative consequences through the use of the formula: “risk = probability (of events) × the size (of future harms)” (p. 344). In this formula as the probability of negative events goes down, so does the perceived risk. As risk goes down, willingness to engage in behavior by the follower goes up.\n\n…Shapes the followers’ values, attitudes, and behaviors towards risk, failure, and success… As the followers’ perception of the danger of failure reduces and the level of trust/faith increases the follower is willing to engage in behavior that could lead to failure, but since the outcome of the failure is minimal, the followers are willing to try. It is through this willingness to fail that followers develop and perfect innovative practices and efforts. In addition to the followers’ attitude toward failure is the followers’ attitude toward success. Success should bring celebration and joy, but humility should be evident as well. Success can bring pride and arrogance and it is the role of the leader to help shape the organization’s values and attitude toward success through the leader-follower interaction.\n\nIn doing this, the Leader Builds the Followers’ Sense of Self Worth and Self-Efficacy such that Both the Leader and Followers are Willing and Ready to take Calculated Risks in Making Decisions to Meet the Organization’s Goals/Objectives and through Repeated Process Steps of Risk-Taking and Decision-Making the Leader and Followers Together Change the Organization to Best Accomplish the Organization’s Objectives.\n\nThis part of the definition is inline with Kelley’s (1992) contention that although 20% of the organization’s success can be attributed to leaders, the remaining 80% is attributed to other factors, among which the followers rank the highest. Although Kelley does not specify the percentage of success attributed to followers, he implied that it is higher than the amount ascribed to leaders. The notion of the followers’ sense of self-worth and self-efficacy ties to the earlier portion of the definition that implies both the follower and leader should be better off for having interacted together in the leader-follower process.\n\n…Self worth… Earlier in this definition the notion of the followers being better off because of the interaction with the leader was raised and is now carried forward in this portion. Simmons (1996) proffered that leaders seek to release intelligence, creativity, and initiative in followers. As followers see the result of their intelligence, creativity, and initiative there is an increase in the understanding by the follower of what he/she can do. When the follower suffers from a psycho-social disorder that prevents the normal process of trial-success-self worth then the leader has the responsibility to help the follower into counseling so that the follower can be restored to full functioning behavior. Under normal conditions, though, the leader seeks to bring out the best in people as supported by Rusaw (2001), who contends that leaders activate the talents in others. Taken in small increments of leaders trusting and empowering others this helps generate confidence in followers who may be frightened about the process or the responsibility and the accompanying risk of failure, according to Bardwick (1996). Belasco and Stayer (1994) commented that leaders need to coach the development of personal capabilities and in this same vein of thinking McFarland, Senn, and Childress (1993) contended that leaders seek to empower followers to become leaders in their own right.\n\n…Self-efficacy… Bandura (1995) postulated:\n\nPeople who have a low sense of efficacy in given domains shy away from difficult tasks, which they view as personal threats. They have low aspirations and weak commitment to the goals they choose to pursue. When faced with difficult tasks, they dwell on their personal deficiencies, the obstacles they will encounter, and all kinds of adverse outcomes rather than concentrate on how to perform successfully. (p. 11)\n\nThus, it is important for the leader to help the follower develop an accurate assessment of the follower’s self-efficacy and where the follower accurately depicts his/her inability to accomplish some task to help the follower through training and education to be better at the task.\n\nSelf-efficacy, according to Bandura (1995) is the followers’ accurate self-appraisal of capabilities and plays a role in the followers’ goal setting. Higher self-efficacy is related to higher goals set by the followers. Bandura postulated that when followers have a realistic self- worth and a realistic self-efficacy then the goals that followers set for themselves or accept from the leader will result in balanced efforts and expectations of success. However, if levels of self- worth and efficacy are beyond what the follower believes is accurate, Bandura cautioned that the follower may suffer bouts of depression.\n\n…Take calculated risks… It is this sense of balance in self-worth, self-efficacy, trust from the leader, empowerment by the leader, provision of resources, and the willingness to accept failure should failure occur that the follower is willing to take calculated risks. The “calculation” portion of this part of the definition refers to the mental evaluation of the probability of success or failure and the gains/losses from either end state. While it is doubtful that followers actually “run the numbers” when calculating the risks there is a weighing of the positives and negatives that occurs. This process is supported in Vroom’s (1964/1994) expectancy theory as well as Ajzen and Fishbein’s (1980) theory of reasoned action.\n\n…Repeated process steps… This part of the definition implies the leader-follower interaction is an iterative cyclic process in which each leader-follower interaction affects the next interaction. The process begins with small amounts of trust by the leader and acceptance of responsibility by the follower and if the outcome is successful then both increase the amount of trust, risk, resources, and responsibility. If the outcome is not successful then reduced amounts of trust, risk, resources, and responsibility occur. The process may go through upward and downward movements with the leader and follower watching both the short-term and long-term results.\n\n…Leader and followers together change the organization… This portion of the definition fits well with Kelley’s (1992) concept of followership in which Kelley claimed that about 20% of the success of the organization is due to the leader and that the remainder was largely influenced by the follower, although Kelley did not venture a guess at the percentage attributable to the follower per se. The overall concept that is derived from this part of the definition is that leaders and followers work together through cyclic process steps of trust, empowerment, risk, and responsibility seeking to attain the organization’s objectives and in so doing seek to help the organization adapt to internal and outside environmental forces.\n\nThe Leader Recognizes the Impact and Importance of Audiences Outside of the Organization’s System and Presents the Organization to the Outside Audiences in such a Manner that the Audiences have a Clear Impression of the Organization’s Purpose and Goals and can Clearly See the Purpose and Goals Lived Out in the Life of the Leader.\n\nThis portion of the definition begins to move the organizational system boundaries out beyond the organization itself and includes the greater environment to include but not limited to suppliers, legislators, regulators, clients, investors, and observers.\n\n…Outside audiences… Rhetoric and leadership was the focus of studies by Emrich, Brower, Feldman, and Garland (2001) as well as Althouse (2001) and Delgado (1999) with the emphasis on the use of rhetoric by world leaders to affect the attitudes and impressions of outside audiences about the respective organizations. In the case of these three studies the organization was a large socio-political organization, and the leader’s actions can be generalized to all organizations of any size. The leader has within his/her role the requirement to present the organization to outside constituencies. While the organization may have a public relations operations or employ the services of a contracted public relations firm the responsibility still rests on the leader. Arlene (2001), in a study of Steve Jobs at Apple computer, emphasized the use of rhetoric by charismatic leaders to manage the impressions of the audiences. While Arlene limited the discussion to charismatic leaders the idea of impression management seems to apply to all leaders in that there is some form of charisma in all leaders, albeit that some have sufficient charisma to be called “charismatic” leaders. Gardner and Avolio’s (1998) earlier work includes the notion of the leader using rhetoric to promote the organization, as a whole, to both employees and outside constituents.\n\n…Clear impression… Earlier sections of the definition presented how the leader communicates the vision and values of the organization to the followers and in much the same way but using different means and images the leader must present the organization to the outside constituencies in such a manner that there is a clear image of the organization in the constituent’s minds. It is worth noting that impression management requires the development of a clear impression in both the good and the bad information–whether the impression is to promote the positives of the organization or to repair damage caused by negative information about the organization. During any communication event with the outside constituencies it is the leader’s responsibility to present the image of the organization.\n\n…Lived out in the life of the leader… In Arlene’s (2001) study of Steve Jobs, Arlene points out that the promotion of the organization and the promotion of the leader seem to occur simultaneously in that the leader finds difficulty in separating self from the organization. Here is where integrity reenters the definition in that there must be alignment between what the leader says and what the leader does. In the panel discussion “Four pioneers reflect on leadership. (CEOs Max DePree, Bob Galvin and Bob Haas and educator Warren Bennis)” the four panelists listed integrity as the number one element for leaders to be aware of and to promote in themselves. von Maurik (1997) added to this by proposing that integrity be one of four competences by which leaders should be evaluated (wisdom, integrity, sensitivity, and tenacity). Although it is beyond the scope of this definition to delve into von Maruik’s work, it is interesting to note the ontological nature of the four competencies rather than the axiological or pragmatic nature of most leadership measures.\n\nIn so Doing, the Leader Examines the Fit of the Organization Relative to the Outside Environment and Shapes both the Organization and the Environment to the Extent of the Leader’s Capability to Insure the Best Fit between the Organization and the Outside Environment.\n\nThis portion of the definition focuses the role of the leader on the macro view of the organization as a whole and how it fits within the greater environment. The approach comes from the organizational ecology field of study.\n\n…Fit of the organization… Hannan and Freeman (1989) posited that the inertia of organizations prevent organizations from adapting to changes in the environment, thus leading to the demise of organizations that no longer fit the environment or are surpassed by more competitive organizations that fit the environment better. It is because of this that leaders must continually monitor the changes in the environment and review the current and probable future organization-environment fit. Singh (1990) supported this notion of an organization being able to adapt to a changing environment and the emphasis on the learning organization shows up in Bruderer and Singh (1996) that leads to the notion that the leader is a catalyst for organizational learning, even at the macro level.\n\n…Shapes both the organization and the environment… If the environment was not shapeable through the actions of the leader we could stop at the notion of the leader as a macro learner, but leaders of organizations can and do shape the environment through lobbying efforts aimed at shaping legislative actions as well as shaping property tax rates through the offering of incentives of employment and growth. Leaders represent the organization to the various local, regional, national, and global environments and seek to create favorable environments or minimize the effect of negative environmental changes. Hartog and Verburg’s (1997) analysis of charismatic leaders’ speeches showing how one of the effects of the rhetoric was to shape external environments support this.\n\nThe leader, then, seems to be an artist shaping both the organization and the environment within the constraints of environmental determinism, as proffered by Richardson (1995) who examined the role of highly deterministic environments on the demise of unresponsive/unaware organizations, thus the leader as an aware responsive organizational leader seeks to build both the hearth and home of the organization.\n\nThe Leader throughout each Leader-Follower-Audience Interaction Demonstrates His/Her Commitment to the Values of: (a) Humility, (b) Concern for Others, (c) Controlled Discipline, (d) Seeking what is Right and Good for the Organization, (e) Showing Mercy in Beliefs and Actions with all People, (f) Focusing on the Purpose of the Organization and on the Well-Being of the Followers, and (g) Creating and Sustaining Peace in the Organization–Not a Lack of Conflict but a Place Where Peace Grows.\n\nThis portion of the definition comes from Winston’s (2002) work on the Beatitudes, found in Matthew 5. Winston notes that the order of the beatitudes presented in Matthew 5 are in the same rank-order of leadership problems he encounters in his consulting and leadership coaching experiences. For a complete review of the values please see Winston’s (2002) complete work.\n\n…Humility… In addition to humility being the focus of the first beatitude, Collins (2002) commented that his research showed that the “great” leaders demonstrated humility. Winston (2002) commented that humility is observed in the leader through the leader’s “teachable-ness.” Leaders in learning organizations, according to Senge (1990), seek the teachable moments in time when ideas and concepts can be taught to others. According to Winston, the same occurs for leaders if leaders are to be taught by employees.\n\n…Concern for others… The second value is sincere concern for followers as well as for all constituencies. Regarding followers, leaders seek to provide at least a living wage, according to Winston (2002), rather than a minimum wage that may not allow the employee to have a reasonable life. This is not to imply a lavish lifestyle for all, but a minimum living wage so that followers are not required to live below the poverty level. This concern extends on to suppliers and constituents in that negotiated deals are good for all parties. Leaders demonstrate concern for others by working with employees who have personal illness or family issues that require the employee to perform at less than desired levels in the workplace, while this does not mean a perpetual sub-optimal performance but rather a tolerance and understanding of short-term impacts. Placing employees in the right job that best uses the employee’s gifts, abilities, and skills, as mentioned earlier in this definition, is another way that leaders demonstrate concern for others.\n\n…Controlled discipline… According to Winston (2002), controlled discipline is a leadership value that is demonstrated through consistent controlled behavior that is highly predictable. Leaders seek to find the underlying causes of problems and seek solutions rather than blame and persecution. Discipline, according to Winston (2002), is needed but may more beneficially take the form of training and work-process adjustments. When leaders demonstrate the value of controlled discipline, employees are more willing to take risks since the risk of damage from failure is either lessened for easier to forecast.\n\n…Seeking what is right and good for the organization… Winston (2002) commented that leaders demonstrate this value by not seeking their own good as one might find in agency theory but, rather, behave in ways that benefit the organization, which is more in line with Davis et al.’s (1997) stewardship theory. While leaders who exhibit this value do not shy away from receiving rewards and recognition, the rewards and recognition are always the result of the leader’s focus on the organization and on the employees rather than the leader’s focus on self-aggrandizing actions.\n\n…Showing mercy in beliefs and actions with all people… Leaders seeking the good of the employees, as well as the organization, when making decisions about employee performance demonstrate mercy, according to Winston (2002). If leaders know the underlying causes of the behavior leaders can then make more informed decisions. Deming (1986) commented that 85% of all the problems in organizations are caused by the system with only the remaining 15% of the problems caused by people. Deming inferred, without directly stating it, that employees make mistakes either by trying to do their best at something but acting in ways that are not balanced with the rest of the organization. When failure is ultimately caused by the organization’s system, mercy must be shown to employees.\n\nSometimes people fail, but with support, training, work reassignment, etc. the employee can be returned to a productive successful state. This is the work of the leader in that the leader has to know the condition of the people and the reasons for performance. Employees, knowing that the leader will have mercy and controlled-discipline, are more willing to take calculated risks.\n\n…Focusing on the purpose of the organization and on the well-being of the followers… Collins (2002) also pointed out that great leaders have a fierce resolve to do what needs to be done in and for the organization. Winston’s (2002) work illustrates that leaders who demonstrate\n\nwhat Collins calls “fierce resolve” have an intense focus on the purpose of the organization. This can be tied back to the sections in this definition that look at the leader’s actions to convey the organization’s purpose to followers and seek to align the followers’ values and commitments to the organization such that followers willingly commit energy to the accomplishment of the organization’s objectives.\n\n…Creating and sustaining peace in the organization–not a lack of conflict but a place where peace grows. This value may on first glance appear to be in the wrong location in the rank-order of the seven values. What Winston (2002) found in his study of the beatitudes is that\n\nan environment in which peace can be created and sustained requires all the prior six values to be in place and fully practiced. Peace, or ongoing conflict resolution, can not occur, according to Winston, if the leader is not teachable in order to learn about the other parties, or is concerned about the well-being of others, or has controlled discipline in his/her action, or seeks what is good for the organization and people, or values/displays mercy or is focused on the organization.\n\nPeace is not the absence of conflict but the successful and intentional management of tension and the resolution of conflict. According to Winston (2002), employees who work in an organization in which the leader demonstrates this value of peace indicate that they can focus more energy on the accomplishment of the organization’s objectives. Employees report less emotional trauma, less anxiety, and less depression related to work/organizational experiences.\n\nIs the Definition Complete?\n\nWhile the best summary of the prior sections would be to simply restate the definition in its compact form, we prefer to suggest that you re-read the compact definition now and see if the wholeness seems more obvious. We wrestled with the title of this document and moved through terms such as Zen and holistic as a means of showing the completeness of the definition but, at the same time, we did not want to imply that this is the end of the definition of leadership. The definition of leadership will continue to develop as scholars, researchers, and practicing leaders gain greater insight into the concept.\n\nReferences\n\nAguinis, H., & Adams, S. K. R. (1998).
