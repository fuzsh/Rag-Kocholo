        "text": "Level with Us\n\nMikhail Aizenberg\n\nwith translations by J. Kates\n\nISBN: 978-0-473-17395-1\n\nSoftcover chapbook 28pp\n\nA bi-lingual edition of 12 poems by Russian poet Mikhail Aizenberg.\n\nTranslations by US poet & literary translator J. Kates. Of Say Thank You,\n\nJ. Katesâ 2007 Zephyr Press volume of Aizenberg poems, F.D. Reeve wrote:\n\nâFresh and marvellous....a philosophical innovator always pressing new\n\nthoughts out of language, each poem a repeated surprise.....These poems\n\nand their skilled translations are our antennae through darkness.â\n\nOnce level with us, now under our feet\n\na honeycomb of chambers, like old, blocked mine-shafts.\n\nRubbish, made homely by petty creatures â\n\nthe crumbling earth piles up in strata.\n\nMIKHAIL AIZENBERG was born in Moscow in 1948, & graduated from\n\nthe Moscow Architectural Institute in 1972. He has been writing poems\n\nsince the mid 1960s, & is a major figure in post-Soviet literature.\n\nTranslations of his work have appeared in numerous English-language\n\nmagazines, as well as in the anthologies Third Wave: The New Russian Poetry\n\n(University of Michigan Press, 1992) & In the Grip of Strange Thoughts\n\n(Zephyr Press, 1999). A bilingual chapbook of his poems, Less than a Meter,\n\nwas published by Ugly Duckling Presse in 2004, & a full-length bilingual selection, Say Thank You, was published by Zephyr Press in 2008. In 2002 Aizenberg was awarded a Brodsky Fellowship for residence in Rome, & in\n\n2003 he won the Andrey Bely prize. He continues to live in Moscow."
