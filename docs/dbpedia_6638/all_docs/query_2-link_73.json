        "text": "EDITORIAL\n\nJuly Newsletter, 2013\n\nThere was no newsletter in June. Bill and I were busy working on getting books done.\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nAt the end of May, the press released the following:\n\nRefuge in the Shadows by Krikor Der Hohannesian (chapbook)\n\nImaginary Planet poems by Alan Elyshevitz (chapbook)\n\nRefuge in the Shadows by Krikor Der Hohannesian\n\nKrikor Der Hohannesian lives in Medford, MA and has been writing poetry for some 40 years though only submitting work over the past several years. Since then, he has had poems published in many literary journals including The Evansville Review, The South Carolina Review, Atlanta Review, Peregrine, The New Renaissance, Hawaii Pacific Review and Connecticut Review. He also received honorable mention for the New England Poetry Club's Gretchen Warren Award for best published poem of 2010. His first chapbook, \"Ghosts and Whispers,\" has been published by Finishing Line Press (2010). He also serves as Assistant Treasurer of the New England Poetry Club.\n\nCover Art: Garabed Der Hohannesian\n\n\"In Krikor Der Hohannesian's poetry, we hear things we might not be able to hear otherwise. \"A man is down\" signals the wind and rain coming in from the east, and the poet listens. In another poem a wife is keening, a child is crying, and the poet listens, listens with all his imagination and his heart. We hear colonial whispers emanating from the Granary Burial Ground. We hear the particular beauty of the names of the winds in many languages, and in another poem we hear the equally specific sadness of parents grieving a lost child. We hear final words, and words that should have been said, and we hear in several of these poems the long, agonized memory traces of the Armenian genocide. In all there is a deeply empathic imagination at work, and these poems give the poet and the reader alike a place of refuge, a place in the shadows in which to hold onto what is so profoundly dear and filled with meaning.\"\n\nFred Marchant, Author of The Looking House\n\n$7.00 | 44 Pages | Order Refuge in the Shadows here...\n\nImaginary Planet poems by Alan Elyshevitz\n\nWinner of the 2011 Cervená Barva Press Poetry Contest\n\nAlan Elyshevitz is a poet and short story writer who was born in New York City and now lives in East Norriton, PA. He is the author of a short story collection, The Widows and Orphans Fund (Stephen F. Austin State University Press), and two poetry chapbooks, The Splinter in Passions Paw (New Spirit) and Theory of Everything (Pudding House). He is a two-time recipient of a fellowship in fiction writing from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. Currently, he is an Assistant Professor of English at the Community College of Philadelphia.\n\n\"To put it in baseball terms, Alan Elyshevitz is a five-tool poet: his poems smooth as silk, whether he's imagining Akhmatova, trying to make sense, as we all are, of this often confusing world, or acknowledging that while pizza may be bad for you, its heavenly and hes going to enjoy some slices. How can you not love a poet who writes, \"The soul cranes its neck to observe/the maximum number of yellow bikinis\"? Imaginary Planet is full of such nuggets, a book with intelligence and compassion to burn. Elyshevitz is a poet to savor and be thankful for.\"\n\nTim Suermondt, author of Just Beautiful\n\n$7.00 | 35 Pages | Order Imaginary Planet here...\n\nAt the end of June, we released the following:\n\nThis is Not a Situation in Which You Should Remain Calm by Michelle Reale (chapbook)\n\nMy Life With Blondie by Jirí Klobouk is at the printers (Fiction book)\n\nThis is Not a Situation in Which You Should Remain Calm by Michelle Reale\n\nMichelle Reale is an academic librarian on faculty at Arcadia University in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Her work has appeared in a wide variety of publications both in print and online, including Nano Fiction, Smokelong Quarterly, Pank, Gargoyle, The Pedestal, elimae, JMWW and others. Her work was included in Dzancs 2011 Best of the Web Anthology. She is the author of four collections of short fiction and prose poems. She has been twice nominated for a Pushcart Prize. She blogs on immigration and Migration and Social Justice in the Sicilian context at www.sempresicilia.wordpress.com\n\nCover Photo: Isabella Reale\n\n\"Michelle Messina Reale's poems evoke a deep confessional visitation between the connecting North African landscape and Southern Italian Etruscan bloodlines. She has taken the sparse stones found among the terrains ruins and placed them one by one, each carefully aligned in unique prosaic consciousnesses that offer new and alluring formations of the old. Her rhythms are rough in prose, often at the edge as a stone cut at various angles, yet continuous and steadfast. The sensation of the hard and quick gallop of a horse through this horizon of remains and longing is heard. The fortitude of trudging onward, of seeing ruinous sights combined with delicious heated passions, leave the reader sweltering and swollen, understanding the validity of bruises.\"\n\nSonia Di Placido, author of, Exultation in Cadmium Red\n\n\"In the title poem Michelle Reale, This is Not a Situation in Which You Should Remain Calm writes: Breathed it in to my pulsating lungs. You will want to breathe in to your pulsating lungs each beautifully crafted poem in this chapbook. You connect with the speaker of these poems on many levels and are drawn into each poem, I found myself holding my breath many times while reading this collection of achingly beautiful poems that encompass the human condition and all that it entails.\"\n\nHelen Vitoria, Poetry Editor, Thrush Poetry Journal\n\n\"Michelle Reale's poems are imbued in the \"now\" as much as they are journeys to the long-gone world of our ancestors. The stories she paints are harrowing and touching: alive as lizards and intoxicating as wild flowers. There is an exquisite touch to them: the robust flavor of wine, the taste of the nibbled food and the omnipresent homage to Sicilian religiosity. The beauty of this collections landscapes and soulscapes left me yearning for more.\"\n\nAlessandra Bava, Author of Guerilla Blues\n\n$7.00 | 32 Pages | Order This is Not a Situation in Which You Should Remain Calm here...\n\nInterviewed this month: Robert Vaughan.\n\nRaves will return next month."
