Autumn Song

September again. In the rain the autumn leaves

are brown like old bronze Chinese coins.

The students lust for experimental encounters

as if the future must burst from their loins.

Brave bold new women with long golden hair

who wish their beardless lovers true,

as you sit down to put your make-up on, remember

we all were once as young as you.

Handsome runners for the Olympic flame

whom Pindar praised and Housman glorified

relent, lest youth be all-victorious

and history die on the losing side.

Sweet scholars shivering at your desks,

afraid you know less than we knew,

cite not our title but the fact:

we all were once as young as you.

Despite the failures and mistakes,

the cycle has compelling charms:

the old rewriting their lost books,

the young asleep in each other’s arms.

And you who keep your own September,

among the faces aren’t there a few

you recognize? On seeing them

(like looking at childhood photographs)

don’t you say to yourself – Yes, I remember

I was once as young as you.

F. D. Reeves [Poetry September 1991]
