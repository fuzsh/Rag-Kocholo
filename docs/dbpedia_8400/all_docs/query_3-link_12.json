        "text": "Values\n\nThe core value underpinning the Estonian state is the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of its population. All of the political processes in Estonia must have their basis in loyalty to the Constitution and guarantee the nation’s freedom. Only a democratic form of government guided by the principles of the separation of powers and the rule of law will ensure Estonia’s continued development. In this way alone can Estonia be a place that offers the best conditions for the preservation of our culture and language and the self-actualisation of our people.\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine and Russia’s wish to undermine the existing principles of European security places Estonia in the most complex security situation it has found itself in since World War II. Accordingly, the members of the government coalition will raise national defence spending to 3% of GDP for the next four years. At the same time we will continue to reinforce broad-based national defence and to enhance the country’s crisis-readiness. With our neighbour to the east at war, and with the period of turbulence that will inevitably follow the conflict, the uncertain and dangerous times we face are far from over.\n\nEstonia is fully aligned with the Western sphere of values. We are a member of the European family and an active member of the European Union. Estonia’s security is guaranteed by our obligations as allies in NATO, by the principle of collective defence accompanying our membership of said alliance and by the strength of our independent capability to defend ourselves. In NATO, the European Union and the UN, Estonia stands firmly against the wishes of dictators and aggressor states to subjugate other nations and reinstate a policy of spheres of influence.\n\nOne of the starting points in forming the coalition for the three parties is the knowledge that Russia’s aggression continues and will continue to have a wide-ranging impact on people’s incomes and the success of businesses in Estonia, compounds hybrid threats and leaves people not knowing what the future will bring. Recent years have shown that in order to cope with major crises, the state must play an active role in the political and economic management of such crises. The energy crisis, which has substantially impaired the economies of Estonia and Europe more broadly, demands decisive action on the part of the government in establishing new production capacities for renewable energy and boosting security of supply.\n\nThe sustainability of the Estonian state is reliant on educated people, the defence of private property and the principle of the market economy. In a country with a small population and an open economy, the current generation cannot live at the expense of future generations. State income and expenditure must be balanced so that we can keep our tax burden at a competitive level to ensure that our state finances remain sustainable. A country which values freedom, is Western in its outlook and has a smart economy whose finances are in order is the best way of guaranteeing Estonia’s independence and the willingness of its population to defend it.\n\nGuaranteeing national defence, making green investments and improving the financial position of the state require a review of tax revenue. Estonia’s tax burden must enable it to cope with the costs of the war and its consequences in such a way that our society does not end up in debt. The parties forming the coalition consider it important for our tax policy to be forward-looking and to contribute to resolving the major challenges with which Estonia is faced.\n\nClimate change and green reforms exhort us to live smarter, more economical and more environmentally friendly lives. This fundamental change must also be reflected in how we raise tax revenue as a society. Collecting new taxes from vices, consumption, pollution and the dumping of waste is also a means by which we can encourage people, companies and communities to rethink their actions and approach them in a more economical way. Estonia’s transition to the circular economy means that we will reuse as many natural resources and raw materials as possible, thereby reducing the amount of waste burnt.\n\nIn the course of 2023 the government we are forming will make strategic decisions pertaining to the security of Estonia’s energy supply. We all consider it vital to reassure energy market participants by making new investments which are technology- and capital-intensive. We want Estonia to become a country which exports renewable energy and which is quick to adopt green technologies, thereby boosting the competitiveness of its economy. To this end we will reorganise the working structure and areas of responsibility of state governance.\n\nWe do not plan to open any further oil shale mines, instead preferring to make maximum use of the mines already in operation. Our aim is to reduce carbon emissions in transport, the construction of buildings and the use of natural resources. With our tax policy we wish to send out a clear message that preference must be given to green and environmentally friendly solution in all fields and across all sectors. Organising our lives in a way that conserves nature requires smarter planning of roads, connections and the living environment. As such, spatial planning and mobility developments which are of higher quality and marked out by their greater awareness constitute one of our government’s priority areas. To achieve this we will merge a number of agencies to form the single Land Use and Spatial Planning Authority (official name in English TBC), whose task will be to provide a complete view so as to create improved living environments in cities and regional areas and to reduce displacement, segregation and reliance on cars. At the same time we will increase the flexibility of public transport and expand demand-based transport options.\n\nRising inequality is stopping people’s and society’s potential from being realised in the best possible way. We will implement policies that reduce inequality and the risk of poverty and bring balance to Estonia’s regional development. A longer and healthier life enables people to be active and happy in their working and family lives and in their community. We will invest in education so as to raise the education level of the population, as a result of which they will enjoy more years of healthy life and a longer life overall, the smart economy will develop, incomes will rise along with tax revenue for the state, people will generally be happier and Estonian language and culture will continue to thrive.\n\nDifficult times have also had an impact on the ability of Estonia’s local governments and regional areas to cope. In order to reduce peripheralisation we will boost the revenue base of local governments, give local governments the chance to find new sources of tax revenue and allocate a greater amount of European Union funding to increase the competitiveness of regional areas and the energy efficiency of buildings.\n\nTo ensure the vitality of small places it is important that the first two levels of education are available to all children as close to their homes as possible. We will help local governments modernise the school network in such a way that funding earmarked for education is used for the development of students. We know that strong education is reliant on smart, independent teachers and heads of education. In shaping the education network we will strike a balance between proximity to home and efficiency. We consider it important for all children, regardless of the language they speak at home, to attend an Estonian-language school. To this end we will be making the transition to Estonian-language studies in pre-school education from autumn 2024, and we will commence the transition in schools so that all basic education is in Estonian by the 2029-2030 academic year.\n\nAll of the parties in the coalition want to ensure the broad-based security of the Estonian state, to invest in the competitiveness of the Estonian economy and in energy security and to implement green reforms at the same time as modernising tax policy, thereby increasing social well-being in the biggest cities and smallest places in the country alike. Our joint wish is to make forward-looking decisions in ever-changing times so as to boost our people’s well-being, offer better services, preserve our language and culture and ensure a better tomorrow.\n\nNational defence and broad-based security\n\nMILITARY NATIONAL DEFENCE\n\nIn accordance with the basis of our security policy, we will guarantee national defence spending of 3% of GDP for the next four years, with the cost of receiving allies in addition to this.\n\nWe will make further investments to reinforce Estonia’s defence capabilities, taking into consideration the military advice offered by the Commander of the Defence Forces.\n\nThe main directions to be taken in the development of the Defence Forces will be enhancing multilayered air defence capabilities (including against drones), bolstering land forces and indirect fire support and stockpiling ammunition.\n\nWith consideration to the significant deterioration in the security situation in Europe, to the training needs of the second infantry brigade, to the increased presence of allies in Estonia and to the excessive burden on existing training areas, we will see to it that the development of the Nursipalu training area is completed in as short a time as possible. To this end we will amend the law so as to permit the use of a national defence exception and continue with the construction of the Nursipalu training grounds.\n\nBy way of recompense in acquiring the land needed for this, we will pay fair compensation in the form of recovery value. Based on the actual impact on local communities, we will prepare a package for the mitigation of the effects of the training area which includes a long-term toleration payment, special programmes for the amelioration of noise and additional funding in support of tourism and cultural heritage in South-Eastern Estonia.\n\nThe Estonian defence industry must also benefit from increased investments in national defence. To this end we will support the industry and develop an industrial park enabling the production of ammunition, weaponry and drones. We will also enhance development cooperation between the Defence Forces and the defence industry and improve the options open to the industry to raise credit and capital.\n\nWe will boost the abilities of the Defence League by increasing (among other things) the land defence contingent to 20,000 people, covering the cost of supplies and training from the defence budget and raising the number of instructors in accordance with the agreement reached between the Commander of the Defence Forces and the head of the Defence League.\n\nWe will support the non-military activities of the Defence League, including by promoting the Women’s Voluntary Defence Organisation and youth work. We will develop the Defence League’s abilities in non-military crises and enhance the networking it undertakes.\n\nIn cooperation with Latvia and Lithuania, we will petition NATO to establish Baltic air defence missions similar to the existing Baltic air policing missions.\n\nWe will establish centrally governed digital defence capabilities based on the Defence Forces and Defence League reserves as well as a rapid response unit to undertake action in information space.\n\nWith our partners in NATO and the EU we will increase the monitoring and defence of critical underwater infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.\n\nWe will amend the length of national service in accordance with the advice of the Commander of the Defence Forces. The term of national service linked to the development of certain capabilities may be extended to two years.\n\nWe will recognise members of the Defence Forces who have contributed to the development of Estonia’s national defence for at least 25 years.\n\nWe will petition all NATO member countries to increase their defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, and we will advocate for the military capabilities and ammunition of allies to be interoperable between allied countries.\n\nWe will work to ensure that our allies deploy high-tech weapons systems in our region and add to stocks of supplies and ammunition that are already in place.\n\nWe will pursue closer defence cooperation with Finland and Sweden and support them in every way in their accession to NATO.\n\nWe will set ourselves the target of doubling the number of women voluntarily undertaking national service, thereby increasing the overall number of women contributing to military defence.\n\nWe will establish an international training and development centre for military and catastrophe medicine in Tartu.\n\nBROAD-BASED SECURITY AND INTERNAL SECURIT\n\nIn guaranteeing and developing Estonia’s security we are guided by the concept of an open approach to security. Based on this, ensuring security and crisis preparedness in the state and society is a comprehensive, systematic and ongoing process.\n\nThis approach must be reflected in the attitude, readiness and action-taking of and cooperation between constitutional institutions, the executive, local governments, companies, organisations, communities and individuals.\n\nIn order to boost society’s preparedness for crises and to guarantee more clarity in crisis management we will overhaul the judicial area by adopting the Civil Crisis and National Defence Act.\n\nWe will develop a solution for the permanent funding of broad-ranging national defence, including civil protection, and devise a plan to cover investment needs for the development of non-military capacities in broad-based national defence and for civil protection.\n\nWe will enhance intelligence and counter-intelligence capabilities and, where needed, update the Security Authorities Act.\n\nWe will reduce the spread of disinformation in Estonia. We will place strategic communication capabilities under unified management and foster the ability to respond both promptly and effectively to hostile information operations.\n\nWe will complete the construction of terrestrial infrastructure on our eastern border by the end of 2025.\n\nWe will develop a training system for internal protection.\n\nWe will intensify action to prevent accidents and breaches of the peace through targeted awareness and supervisory activities. In their operations, rescue workers and police officers must not only respond effectively to accidents and breaches of the peace, but also focus on preventing them through sensible activities pertaining to awareness and supervision.\n\nWe will see to it that offence proceedings are henceforth conducted in entirely digital format so that police officers no longer have to spend time on procedural acts, thus freeing up police resources.\n\nWe will broaden the options open to local governments to contribute to ensuring public order. To achieve this we will set higher requirements for local government law enforcement officials and grant them the right to deal with individuals in a state of intoxication who breach public order.\n\nTo improve crisis preparedness we will establish a civil protection reserve which, based on community initiative, will offer additional support to the Rescue Board and health care system in ensuring civil protection.\n\nForeign policy and support for Ukraine\n\nFOREIGN POLICY AND DIPLOMACY\n\nWe will support the continuation of the expansion policies of both the European Union and NATO on clear criteria and do everything we can to assist the European Union’s Eastern Partnership states in regard to implementing internal reforms and strengthening democracy and the rule of law.\n\nWe will promote all forms of cooperation with the United States of America as a strategic partner in national defence, the economy and culture.\n\nEstonia is an active Member State of the European Union which, by emphasising unity, defends its national interests in the creation of laws and the shaping and implementation of policies.\n\nWe will boost Estonia’s diplomatic influence, using our dynamic, open and motivated foreign service to guarantee in the best possible way the country’s security, its foreign economic interests and the protection of its citizens around the world. To this end we will update the Foreign Service Act and consolidate Estonian embassies of strategic importance.\n\nWe will pursue active economic diplomacy which enables our companies to expand to foreign markets, attracts new investments and creates prosperity for Estonia as a whole.\n\nThe focus of Estonia’s development cooperation will be on promoting a safe and economically successful neighbourhood based on democracy and the rule of law in the countries of the Eastern Partnership of the European Union.\n\nWe will unite the global Estonian community by supporting the establishment of a worldwide network enabling anyone wishing to do so to obtain information about Estonia and to contribute to the country’s development.\n\nWe will strengthen cooperation in all of its forms between the Nordic countries and the Baltic States.\n\nEconomic development and innovation\n\nECONOMIC GROWTH AND INNOVATION\n\nWe will take a systematic approach to the leadership and development of the innovation ecosystem. The innovation ladder and the green ladder are two tools which will help companies to assess their capacity for innovation and their environmental footprint, thereby making themselves more competitive.\n\nWe will invest at least 1% of GDP in research and development and set ourselves the goal of private-sector spending on research and development reaching at least 2% of GDP.\n\nOur aim will be for 2% of all public procurements to be targeted at the acquisition of innovative solutions.\n\nIn the public sector, we will establish a minimum wage equivalent to 60% of the median wage by 2027. We will set ourselves the goal of entering into a trilateral good-will agreement with unions and employers in May 2023 so that the minimum wage reaches 60% of the median wage by 2027 and grows at a faster rate than the average wage.\n\nWe will establish a centre for applied research in cooperation with entrepreneurs and scientific establishments. We will increase funding for the applied research programme based on the areas on which the state wishes to focus.\n\nWe will boost the financial capacity of Enterprise Estonia to secure major projects and make green investments and for Estonian companies to expand onto foreign markets.\n\nWe will make working regulations more modern and flexible. Legislation pertaining to working must adapt to the changed nature of work, bring as many different groups of people as possible to the labour market and enable flexible workloads and organisation of work whilst ensuring social guarantees.\n\nWe will provide base funding annually to ensure the functioning of the digital state and the prevention of security risks so that cybersecurity is in line with the latest technological developments and threats. We will set specific objectives to reduce the digital footprint of and save energy in the use of the digital state.\n\nWe will set ourselves the goal of Estonia being the best country in Europe, in terms of its enterprise and tax environments and its foreign agreements, in which to establish and maintain company headquarters and from which to globally manage assets.\n\nWe will take a systematic approach to ensuring the availability of capital for Estonian companies, including by promoting the investment of pension fund money in the Estonian economy so as to accumulate national capital and boost the competitiveness of local companies.\n\nWe will analyse opportunities for the creation of a Green Corridor with which to promote investments offering high added value by reducing bureaucracy and therefore shortening the time it takes to obtain the approval necessary for all projects to be implemented.\n\nPERSONALISED STATE\n\nIn order to create a personalised state we will implement the digital transition in public administration, guided by the following principles:\n\nWe will carry out budgetary reviews and launch zero-base reforms, i.e. rebuild the national budget from the ground up. We will review every cost item so as to eliminate unnecessary expenditure and use the money available in the budget in as smart and economical a way as possible.\n\nWe will produce an open e-state as a platform for which companies, citizens’ associations and others can create new solutions.\n\nWe will support the process for the formalisation of laws in the State Gazette in a way that enables rules for responding to issues and undertaking other actions to be generated from texts, with these rules then able to be used in, among other things, the software for public-sector services.\n\nWe will create a mobile app for the e-state through which information and services can be provided to every person in Estonia by the state.\n\nWe will introduce, at the legislative level, the principle of the single submission of data for both individuals and companies.\n\nWe will replace the requirement to submit an application with consent for services in cases where the state is certain that the citizen in question is eligible to obtain the service.\n\nWe will complete the already planned introduction of e-invoices in the public sector and support the full implementation of digital accounting in the private sector as well. An e-invoice is a form of electronic communication between machines.\n\nWe will review all state services and eliminate any doubling-up. We will review management in ministries, agencies and foundations as a whole and also the number of officials employed in them. We will make online voting possible on smart devices.\n\nWe will develop the digital state in a user-centric way that promotes innovation, prioritising ease of use on smart devices and the security of systems and services. We will enable more service-related and decision-making processes characteristic of the personalised state and the integration of artificial intelligence into data-based decision-making.\n\nTo ensure that open data are freely available we will make the crossover use of various state databases possible and provide user-friendly access to them. We will establish better conditions for the crossover use of data at the state and local government levels.\n\nWe will centralise public-sector services and service-related information of importance to entrepreneurs in the eesti.ee digital gateway, creating proactive solutions or solutions which are based on event services. We will promote the widespread use of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nFINANCIAL POLICY\n\nWe will set ourselves the goal of moving towards a balanced state budget. We will review both the income and expenditure in the state budget and identify areas in which savings can be made.\n\nWe will conduct a state budget review on zero-base principles and increase the transparency of the budget.\n\nWe will expand the taxation base of the state and local governments and place greater focus on the taxation of consumption, pollution and property.\n\nFrom 2025 we will abolish the current tax hump on personal income tax and raise the tax-free threshold to 700 euros per month.\n\nWe will raise VAT by 2% in 2024. We will abolish the low-VAT exception for accommodation providers as of 1 January 2025.\n\nWe will raise personal and company income tax by 2% in 2025. We will abolish the lower income tax rate applicable to regularly distributed profits.\n\nWe will introduce a car tax on 1 July 2024.\n\nWith our taxation policy we will promote the circular economy and the reuse of resources.\n\nWe will tax the use of plastics and packaging so as to reduce the generation of waste therefrom.\n\nWe will continue to tax vices and behaviour that poses a health risk, at the same time preventing the rise of cross-border trade.\n\nWe will make it possible for local governments to establish local taxes.\n\nWe will review environmental and resource fees and we will tax deforestation.\n\nWe will boost state tax revenue from gambling.\n\nWe will abolish additional tax-free income for children, spouses and home loan interest from 2024.\n\nDevelopment of education and research\n\nESTONIAN-LANGUAGE EDUCATION AND ORGANISATION OF SCHOOLS\n\nFrom autumn 2024 we will make all pre-school education in the country Estonian language-based, with children attending the same kindergartens regardless of the language they speak at home. From autumn 2024, Estonian-language or language-immersion teaching will be guaranteed for every child attending kindergarten, depending on their skills and abilities.\n\nWe will make all basic school education in the country Estonian language-based by 2030, with children attending the same schools regardless of the language they speak at home. From autumn 2024, Estonian-language or language-immersion teaching will be guaranteed for every child starting Grade 1 or Grade 4, depending on their skills and abilities. In establishing unified Estonian schools we will be guided by regional differences and the recommendations of experts. Where necessary we will develop individual transition plans for Russian-language schools.\n\nWe will involve parents in the transition to Estonian-language education. In connection with the transition we will ensure that students in schools and kindergartens who speak a language other than Estonian at home are still able to learn their mother tongue and about their culture.\n\nThe transition to Estonian-language studies in schools which to date have taught in Russian or in a combination of languages must be implemented in such a way that the students gain a better understanding of the subjects they are studying.\n\nWe will guarantee funding from the state budget for the implementation as planned of the action plan for the transition to Estonian-language education.\n\nWe will make pre-school, general and vocational education Estonian language-based in accordance with current legislation.\n\nWe will set ourselves the goal of raising teachers’ salaries to 120% of the average wage over the next four years, including by increasing the differentiation fund.\n\nWe will establish career models for education workers, including an appropriate calculation of workload and a salary model. We will pay particular attention to resolving the issue of the next generation of teachers.\n\nWe will raise the age of compulsory school attendance to 18, i.e. until students gain either secondary or vocational education after basic school. This change will come into effect for students graduating from basic school in 2024.\n\nWe will make vocational education more attractive, with students in vocational schools not only attaining a professional qualification but also competitive secondary education (four years of study).\n\nWe place importance on cooperation between the field of education and the private sector in order for them to work together to resolve the challenges faced in the field. For example, by working with the private sector, solutions could be found in the development of flexible learning methods, modern teaching materials could be created and young people’s interest in the real and natural sciences could be increased.\n\nThe school network requires greater clarity in its rules and organisation. We will develop a funding model for the school network which promotes the maintenance of kindergartens and pre-schools (up to the second stage of schooling) close to people’s homes. All regional schools with students in Grades 1-6 will be transferred to class-based funding on condition that 30 or more children study there for a period of three years on average. Class-based funding will lower incrementally as student numbers range from 30 to 20.\n\nWe will raise the quality of school management and make all employment contracts of school directors fixed-term. We will establish a recruitment and assessment committee for heads of education to support educational institutions in the hiring of high-quality directors and in the evaluation of them.\n\nWe will review the principles of organising education for and providing support services to children with special educational needs (SEN) and seek ways of boosting the organisation of inclusive education.\n\nIn order to increase environmental and climate awareness we will develop green skills and knowledge at all levels of education and in lifelong learning. Environmental education must help students of all ages understand the causes of the climate crisis and be aimed at solutions, i.e. resolving said crisis. We will update curricula with knowledge supporting sustainable development.\n\nWe will increase opportunities for the non-formal learning of Estonian.\n\nEnvironment and biodiversity\n\nGREEN REFORMS AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\nWe will implement green reforms in cooperation with the public, private and third sectors. Working with entrepreneurs we will reshape Estonia’s economic model to make it sustainable and climate-neutral. The green reforms cover all fields: every budget investment must lead us to more sustainable use of the environment and to a more sustainable economic model.\n\nIn cooperation with researchers, experts, community associations and entrepreneurs we will adopt the Climate Act and establish legal clarity and investment assurance for the achievement of climate objectives. In order to guarantee predictability and legal assurance for all parties for the fulfilment of Estonia’s climate goals up to 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, we will determine key target levels affecting the future of different areas of life and the economy. We will work with a body of experts to periodically assess the implementation of the Climate Act.\n\nThe achievement of the objectives of the Green Deal is only possible if we raise the awareness of society as a whole and get a range of interest groups involved. We will increase communication, information and inclusion activities to explain the environmental challenges we face, find common threads and improve the culture of debating important issues.\n\nWe will digitalise waste management so as to guarantee checks on waste flows. We will implement the ‘polluter pays’ principle. We will establish waste-sorting solutions that take people into consideration. We will see to it that the system of manufacturers’ responsibility for packaging waste functions more efficiently, and we will set a separate target for the recycling of sales packaging.\n\nOn the circular economy road map we will work with the state, local governments, the non-government sector and entrepreneurs to set out pathways for the development of Estonia’s circular economy (including opportunities for recycling). We will increase the reuse of waste and by-products from oil shale mining and other materials, including through public procurements. We will eliminate obstructions to the reuse of building materials and demolition waste and simplify the amendment of the purpose of use of buildings.\n\nFor state agencies and local governments we will develop a programme for the reduction of digital waste and of the environmental footprint of the IT sector.\n\nIn developing circular solutions we will focus on high-impact sectors of the economy i.e. resource-intensive industrial sectors. We will create targeted measures and programmes to help them increase their efficiency and develop solutions for extracting even greater value from materials.\n\nIn order to achieve energy independence and to save people money, our priority is the renovation of residential and other buildings, which we will support from EU funds.\n\nWe will also promote circular-economy business models and innovative ideas (such as the sharing economy and the concept of products as services) in regard to the services offered by the state.\n\nNATURE CONSERVATION AND PRESERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY\n\nIn order to restore biodiversity we will map out a comprehensive green network covering the entire country, getting private forest owners, local governments and communities involved in nature conservation in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy. We will halt the decline in biodiversity indicators by restoring habitats and supporting land use which is designed to conserve nature.\n\nWorking with scientists and representatives of the private sector we will draft a peat policy for Estonia. Open-cast and unrehabilitated mining areas and former peat-mining sites place a burden on the environment, and peat cannot be extracted from natural bogs as this contravenes Estonian and international guidelines and agreements.\n\nWe will enhance the status of Estonia’s watercourses (rivers and creeks) and review the condition of straits, looking into options for improving them.\n\nWe will reform the system of environmental fees so as to promote a reduction in pollution.\n\nWe will launch marine conservation reforms and draft an action plan for the development of a sustainable blue economy.\n\nWe will update the system of fees for recreational and commercial fishing.\n\nFORESTRY\n\nWe will adopt the forestry development plan which has already been drafted and improve the quality of forestry data so as to more accurately monitor the status of Estonia’s forests. The target we will set is that the stock of commercial forests must not decrease. In order to achieve this objective we will approve the draft act amending the Forest Act at the government level in autumn 2023.\n\nWe will develop the underlying basis of forestry policy until 2050, setting out principles of sustainable forest use in line with the climate objectives that have been established.\n\nForest management and the valorisation of timber as a whole must guarantee that the field of forestry is a carbon binder. Maximum value must be extracted from Estonian timber, with end products having the highest possible capacity to bind carbon.\n\nAll forestry-related data must be digital, public and linked to other state databases (including the Police and Border Guard Board, the Transport Administration and the Tax and Customs Board).\n\nWe will digitalise the entire felling process and all reporting linked to it. Data pertaining to felling notifications, felling work and the completion of felling must be immediately available.\n\nWe will maintain forests and recreational woodlands which are close to areas where people live as they are highly valued parts of the living environment. We will describe the regulation of areas of increased public interest in law.\n\nWe will trial the maintenance and management of state forests as community and permanent forests in areas of increased public interest.\n\nIn general, clearcutting will be restricted in nature reserves.\n\nIn order to valorise and obtain greater added value from timber we consider the development of wood chemistry important.\n\nWe will tax the felling of trees in forests and on agricultural land.\n\nWe will analyse the principles of compensation for the impact of nature conservation restrictions on both land owners and local governments.\n\nSPATIAL PLANNING\n\nWe will reorganise the structural units of the agencies dealing with spatial planning to form the single Land Use and Spatial Planning Authority (official name in English TBC).\n\nThe Land Use and Spatial Planning Authority (official name in English TBC) will advise, among other things, on the drafting of local climate plans, which in combination with more professional spatial planning will help us to adapt to climate change, prevent segregation, prepare for the future and conserve the environment.\n\nThe Land Use and Spatial Planning Authority (official name in English TBC) will aim to guarantee a high-quality living environment in both urban and regional areas. We will contribute to the use of best practice in modern spatial planning in the development of mobility, infrastructure and cities in order to reduce displacement, segregation, costs and our environmental footprint.\n\nWe will amend the Planning Act and Building Code to make it obligatory to follow the principles of high-quality space. We will support property development centred around public transport and the preferential development of economical modes of travel.\n\nWe will set ourselves the target of renovating as many buildings as possible, including public-sector buildings, in an energy-efficient way. We will adopt the life cycle assessment of embodied CO2 in buildings in design and construction. We will make it obligatory to undertake the smart monitoring of the energy class of public and commercial buildings.\n\nWe will introduce the principle that new public buildings should preferably be constructed from timber. This constitutes climate-neutral construction, producing carbon sinks.\n\nEnergy and infrastructure\n\nSECURITY OF SUPPLY AND GREEN ENERGY\n\nOur position is that renewable energy is overwhelmingly in the public interest. We will expedite the planning and establishment of renewable capacities and make it possible to access the network sooner. We will set criteria for the selection of projects of overwhelming public interest and for construction in a faster, simplified manner.\n\nWe will promote and adopt opportunities devised in the private sector to decrease energy consumption and thereby reduce costs and the burden on the network at peak times, working at the EU level to ensure that compensation for consumption management takes place on the electricity market.\n\nWe will make the public sector the example to follow in reducing climate footprints.\n\nWe will support industrial companies in making the energy transition and improving resource efficiency.\n\nIn 2023 we will take analysis-based decisions regarding energy system choices to be made over the coming decades. In order to fulfil the objective of 100% renewable electricity we will organise tenders with price ceilings and price floors, including for the expedited construction of offshore wind farms.\n\nOur goal will be for Estonia to become a country which exports renewable energy.\n\nOn the basis of the report compiled by the nuclear energy working group we will decide whether nuclear energy could play a role in Estonia’s energy portfolio and, if so, what kind of role that might be.\n\nIn proportion to renewable energy we will turn our attention to the establishment of storage capacities and create the guarantee mechanism required for the realisation of strategic energy projects which are in the interests of the EU as a whole.\n\nWe will promote the development of green hydrogen technology. We will support geothermal energy surveys and studies into the use of residual heat and heat from wastewater and sea water for heating and cooling.\n\nWe will make investments in networks in accordance with the coordinated plan of network companies with the aim of making the networks more weather-resistant, eliminating phantom subscriptions, bolstering connections with Estonia’s islands and giving new production companies the chance to subscribe.\n\nWe will see the partitioning of Elektrilevi from Eesti Energia through to its conclusion.\n\nWe will make oil shale mining separate from Eesti Energia and establish a standalone company that guarantees all market participants equal access to oil shale resources at cost price. We will favour making maximum use of existing mines over the opening of new mines.\n\nFor spatial development and more efficient multi-purpose land use, the future focus must shift from large solar farms established on the ground to solar panels installed on buildings and other structures.\n\nWe will support the distributed energy production projects of communities, land owners and companies, including the development of micro-networks and the creation of energy cooperatives.\n\nAs a producer of electricity we will make it possible for apartment associations and household consumers to subscribe to up to 30 kW at a fixed price.\n\nIn developing networks we will also take into account the rapid rise in the number of electric vehicles and the development of charging points accompanying it.\n\nWe will establish new external links in order to grow Estonia’s energy security.\n\nWe will connect Estonia to the synchronous grid of Continental Europe by 2025.\n\nWe will support the establishment of an electricity network for offshore wind farms on the Baltic Sea and its addition to the list of European projects.\n\nWe will support continued studies into the adoption of mineral resources of importance to Estonia and the European Union and seek ways of generating new prosperity for the population of Estonia in doing so whilst conserving the environment.\n\nBy 2027 we will organise a public competition for the acquisition of a controllable power reserve.\n\nWe will produce a decarbonisation plan for the gas market in order to expand the biogas market.\n\nWe will bring to an end the burning of wood in industrial electricity production, pursuing cooperation in other European countries in order to achieve this. However, we will use biomass in local cogeneration plants. We will support the cascading use of wood and its use for the generation of greater added value, not for the export of wood for energy.\n\nRegional policy and rural life\n\nREGIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nWe will increase the financial autonomy of local governments. We will enable greater flexibility for local governments in establishing local taxes.\n\nWe will balance out the revenue base of local governments in order to limit the negative impact of urban sprawl and regional underdevelopment, taking into account (among other things) the distribution of the population and the locations of workplaces.\n\nIn the course of updating the Local Government Organisation Act and the Local Government Financial Management Act we will review the division and funding of tasks between local governments and the central government.\n\nWe will promote cooperation between local governments in the distribution of support. Through the deductibles and volumes of support measures we will motivate local governments to work together to determine projects in which they can jointly invest.\n\nWe will reinforce the principle of the regional distribution of entrepreneurship incentives in the use of European Union structural funds. To this end we will establish conditions for applying for and using support that create greater regional balance, and in the case of the Smarter Estonia and Greener Estonia entrepreneurship incentives we will aim to allocate at least 40% of support to places outside of the Tallinn and Tartu regions.\n\nIn the implementation of the support measures of the European Union we will take the nature of different parts of the country into account in order to limit regional underdevelopment.\n\nWe will boost local government autonomy in taking state land into use. We will map out the state land not in use in towns and cities and transfer it to local governments with the aim of fulfilling entrepreneurial, community and public interests.\n\nWe will expand to all of the regions in Estonia the pilot programme for housing co-loans which has been launched by the Rural Development Foundation. Via the foundation and Enterprise Estonia we will offer co-loans and surety to families who are building homes in rural areas.\n\nWe will reduce the co-payment rate of KredEx support for the reconstruction of apartment buildings to 30% for local governments outside of Tallinn and Tartu and settlement units in neighbouring local government areas. We will pilot a quarter-based renovation programme.\n\nIn order to boost the quality of public space we will continue to demolish aesthetically unpleasing buildings and devise a programme for the improvement of public space.\n\nWe will work with Latvia to improve cooperation between Valga and Valka and the development of joint services.\n\nWe will create a programme of regional investments and bring to an end the distribution of covering funds in the Riigikogu.\n\nWe will boost the IT abilities and awareness of local governments through consultation and by offering centrally developed service solutions. We will set ourselves the goal of transferring local government and state IT systems and services to a single personalised state system.\n\nIDA-VIRU COUNTY\n\nFor the better management of the resolution of the challenges linked to Ida-Viru County we will appoint a government representative to the county. We will improve the living environment in the county with input from and the involvement of architects and Estonian Academy of Arts experts on urban space.\n\nWe will expedite the use of funding from the Just Transition Fund, where necessary redesigning measures to ensure that they better meet the needs of the region in question. We will enhance our capacity for Russian-language communication in order to outline the opportunities offered by the fund.\n\nWe will modernise Narva Hospital with the support of European Union funding.\n\nRURAL AFFAIRS\n\nWe will ensure the continuity of supply of local food and designate doing so a vital service.\n\nWe will look for ways to support farmers and food producers through targeted ad-hoc grants and transition facility support. We will maintain the minimum rate of excise permitted by the EU on diesel fuel used in agriculture and fishing.\n\nWe will motivate educational institutions in Estonia to contribute to making food production more knowledge-based and in the training of the next generation of producers to meet the needs of entrepreneurs. We will guarantee the commissioning of higher education that supports food security in accordance with the OSKA report.\n\nWe will develop a regulation for the protection of valuable agricultural land. We will contribute to the upkeep of land improvement systems and review the state’s principles regarding the acquisition and provision for use of agricultural land so that such land remains in the hands of those using it for its intended purpose.\n\nWe will restrict third-country citizens’ access in the buying and leasing of agricultural and forest land. In order to guarantee Estonia’s security we will limit the options open to third-country citizens to acquire immovable property.\n\nWe will encourage more people to embrace organic produce. We will continue to compensate the cost of using organic ingredients in schools and kindergartens in order to support the shaping of healthy eating habits among children.\n\nWe will continue to introduce sustainable agricultural practices which lead to a reduction in the use of pest control products and fertilisers.\n\nWe will look for ways of using a greater volume of healthy local food in public catering and increase the proportion of vegetarian food.\n\nWe will develop a national programme for the reduction of food waste.\n\nWe will promote the donating of food by improving legal regulations and through communication which encourages retailers and wholesalers to donate food items. In order to reduce food waste we will implement measures which have already been shown to work in the European Union.\n\nWe will improve the availability of healthy vegetarian food in catering institutions serving the public sector.\n\nWe will update legislation pertaining to the keeping of pets as well as procedures for their registration.\n\nCulture and sport\n\nCULTURE AND CREATIVE WORK\n\nWe will look for additional ways of utilising private funds in the financing of the fields of sport and culture.\n\nWe will continue with the programme of showcasing culture for school students.\n\nWe will continue to support the development of the Estonian film industry via Film Estonia programmes.\n\nWe will update the Public Broadcasting Act and analyse the funding model of the Estonian national broadcaster (ERR).\n\nVia the financing options of the Cultural Endowment of Estonia we will find the means to construct a new building for ERR.\n\nWe will adopt a new Public Libraries Act and implement a unified library system for everyone in Estonia.\n\nWe will set ourselves the goal of improving the system of social guarantees for creative persons.

In regard to public-sector cultural institutions and the remuneration of creative work financed by the public sector, forms of remuneration will be favoured which are accompanied by the payment of taxes by the employer and social guarantees.\n\nWe will support and foster the digitalisation of works in order to secure their preservation and availability. To this end we will develop funding opportunities for cultural creation, including EU funding, and promote the development of virtual production.\n\nWe will protect the tradition of Song and Dance Celebrations, national culture and heritage culture.\n\nWe will conduct an inventory of heritage conservation sites. Heritage conservation must be educational in nature and support the initiative of owners. Objects of architectural value must not be allowed to go to ruin because of bureaucratic obstacles placed in the path of owners and unjustified demands places on them by officials, nor due to a lack of awareness, due care or financial ability on the part of the owner.\n\nWe will look for ways of taxing international streaming platforms and work to ensure the fair taxation of global digital giants.\n\nWe will bring to an end the differentiation between culture and creative entrepreneurship in the eyes of state and other agencies, which impedes the development of the field of culture. We will consciously include the private sector in the development of cultural policy and strategies.\n\nWe consider it necessary to boost the project-based competence of the creative economy and field of culture so as to gain better access as a leading partner to Creative Europe and Horizon Europe investments. We will contribute to the field’s ability to access European support structures and new means of funding.\n\nWe will support the development of locally influenced identity-based communities and cultures. In the interests of the cultural development of the Seto, Võru, Rannarootsi, Saare, Kihnu, Peipsivene and other communities, including newly integrated communities, we will enhance the administrative and project-based competence of their representative bodies and/or institutions (such as the Võru and Mulgi Institutes).\n\nSPORT AND EXERCISE\n\nWe will encourage people in Estonia to exercise more.
