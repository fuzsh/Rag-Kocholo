        "text": "In the heart of Tallinn’s old town stands the majestic Saint Olaf Cathedral, a prestigious architectural treasure of Europe. The first written mention of this monument dates back to 1267. It was the most impressive Gothic church in Europe during the Middle Ages. At that time, its height of 124 m made it the highest church in Europe. Following a fire in 1433, the church was restored. This unique architectural masterpiece symbolises the glory of this city during the Middle Ages, a city which was at the peak of its influence from the 14th to the 16th century. At the beginning of the 16th century, St Olaf became the highest monument in the world with a spire reaching 159 m in height. According to legend, Olaf was the name of the man who built the church. Olaf struck up a deal with the nobles of Tallinn: either he would succeed in keeping his identity a secret and would then be paid for the construction of the building, or else his name would be discovered in which case he would not be paid. Following the discovery of his name, the people of the town called him while he was finishing the bell tower. Surprised, Olaf fell from the tower. At the spot where he fell, visitors can still see a snake and a toad petrified in the stone. In 1991, the KGB used the pointed tower of the cathedral as a radio transmitter.\n\nSaint-Olaf’s Cathedral © Entreprise Estonia"
