        "text": "Corruption can take many forms, and can include behaviours like:\n\npublic servants demanding or taking money or favours in exchange for services,\n\npoliticians misusing public money or granting public jobs or contracts to their sponsors, friends and families,\n\ncorporations bribing officials to get lucrative deals\n\nCorruption can happen anywhere: in business, government, the courts, the media, and in civil society, as well as across all sectors from health and education to infrastructure and sports.\n\nCorruption can involve anyone: politicians, government officials, public servants, business people or members of the public.\n\nCorruption happens in the shadows, often with the help of professional enablers such as bankers, lawyers, accountants and real estate agents, opaque financial systems and anonymous shell companies that allow corruption schemes to flourish and the corrupt to launder and hide their illicit wealth.\n\nCorruption adapts to different contexts and changing circumstances. It can evolve in response to changes in rules, legislation and even technology.\n\nTransparency is all about knowing who, why, what, how and how much. It means shedding light on formal and informal rules, plans, processes and actions. Transparency helps us, the public, hold all power to account for the common good.\n\nSeeking and receiving information is a human right that can act as a safeguard against corruption, and increase trust in decision makers and public institutions. However, transparency is not only about making information available, but ensuring it can be easily accessed, understood and used by citizens."
