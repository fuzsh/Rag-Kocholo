        "text": "Estonia is a parliamentary republic. Its prime minister, who is the head of government, is nominated by the president and approved by parliament. He or she is in charge of the executive power vested in government. The president, who is the head of state, is elected by Parliament or electoral college for 5 years. The Parliament has 101 members, elected every 4 years. The country is divided into 15 counties and 79 municipalities.\n\nHow much does Estonia pay and receive from the EU?\n\nThe EU budget is the tool to ensure that Europe remains a democratic, peaceful, prosperous and competitive force. The EU uses it to finance its priorities and big projects that most individual EU countries could not finance on their own.\n\nThe benefits of EU membership significantly exceed the size of the EU budget contributions and the examples are many. All Member States benefit from being part of the Single Market, a shared approach to the common challenges of migration, terrorism and climate change, and concrete gains like better transport infrastructure, modernised and digitalised public services and cutting-edge medical treatment.\n\nHow much each EU country pays into the EU budget is calculated fairly. The larger your country's economy, the more it pays – and vice versa.\n\nThe EU budget is not about giving and taking – it’s about collectively contributing to making Europe and the world a better place for us all.\n\nEU budget spending and revenue per country and per year\n\nEU-funded projects in Estonia\n\nMoney from the EU budget helps fund programmes and projects in all EU countries – for example to build roads, subsidise researchers and protect the environment.\n\nFind out more about how Estonia benefits from EU funding and recovery funds in your country or region."
