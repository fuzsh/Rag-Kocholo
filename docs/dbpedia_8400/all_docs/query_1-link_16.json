        "text": "The prime minister, who serves as head of government, is nominated by the president and approved by the parliament. There have been three governments since the 2019 parliamentary elections. The first government, from 2019, was headed by Jüri Ratas of the Center Party in coalition with the far-right Conservative People’s Party of Estonia (EKRE) and the conservative Isamaa party. It was replaced in January 2021 by a government led by the Reform Party leader Kaja Kallas in coalition with the Center Party. In June 2022, relations between the ruling parties deteriorated, and the coalition crumbled. A new goverment was formed in July, again headed by Kallas of the Reform Party, this time in coalition with Isamaa and the Social Democrats.\n\nThe president is elected by the parliament to a five-year term, filling a largely ceremonial role as head of state. In August 2021, Alar Karis was elected as a nonpartisan consensus candidate in a second round of voting, winning the support of all parliamentary parties except the EKRE.\n\nThe constitution establishes a 101-seat unicameral parliament called the Riigikogu, whose members are elected for four-year terms using proportional representation in multimember constituencies.\n\nThe March 2019 parliamentary elections met democratic standards. As it had been in previous elections in 2015, voter turnout was about 64 percent. Five parties cleared the 5 percent vote threshold for representation, with the main opposition center-right Reform Party capturing a plurality with 34 seats. Electoral support for EKRE more than doubled, which translated into 19 seats. The incumbent Center Party won 26 seats, down one. The number of seats won by Isamaa and the Social Democrats dropped to 12 and 10, respectively.\n\nPeople’s political choices are generally not subject to undue interference. However, there have been increasing concerns about the influence of online disinformation in recent years, particularly about election campaigns, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine.\n\nB4. Do various segments of the population (including ethnic, racial, religious, gender, LGBT+, and other relevant groups) have full political rights and electoral opportunities? 3 / 4\n\nAround 5 percent of the country’s population—mostly ethnic Russians—remain stateless and cannot participate in national elections. Resident noncitizens are permitted to vote in local and European Parliament elections but may not run as candidates or join political parties. The authorities have adopted policies to assist those seeking naturalization. Following the Russian government’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, draft legislation was submitted to the parliament to repeal the local-election voting rights of anyone who lacks EU citizenship. The measure, which appeared to be aimed at preventing Russians and Belarussians from electoral participation, was supported by many MPs from both the ruling and opposition parties.\n\nPolitical representation of women is gradually increasing. Former president Kersti Kaljulaid became the first woman in the country’s history to hold her office when she was elected in 2016. Moreover, a record total of 29 women were elected to the 101-seat Riigikogu in 2019. After taking office in 2021, Prime Minister Kallas—the first woman to hold her post—appointed an almost equally gender-balanced cabinet. The principle was upheld in the second Kallas cabinet, named in July 2022, which includes seven women and eight men.\n\nThe legal framework and independent law enforcement institutions provide important checks on corruption, and cases against high-profile defendants have been brought to court in recent years, though the results have been mixed.\n\nThere are still no comprehensive rules for the protection of whistleblowers, with proposed legislation stalled as of the end of 2022. The adoption of a bill that would tighten control of party financing is also being delayed. Regulations on lobbying are being strengthened, but implementation of the changes is still in progress.\n\nEstonia is known for its high degree of government transparency and well-developed e-governance services.\n\nPublic access to government information and the asset declarations of officials is provided for both in law and in practice. Estonia generally performs well in ensuring a transparent and effective public procurement system, although according to the European Commission’s 2021 figures, the latest available, 34 percent of Estonian public contracts that year had only a single bidder or no call for bids at all.\n\nThe government generally respects freedom of the press. However, judges sometimes use the criminal procedure code to restrict media coverage in various cases of public interest, particularly those concerning corruption. Public and private television and radio stations broadcast freely, and there are a number of independent newspapers. In February 2022, Estonia amended its media law, increasing the media regulator’s independence and requiring greater transparency around media ownership structures.\n\nObservers have noted a trend toward ownership concentration, especially at the regional level. Some local media have struggled amid the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing digitalization in the media market.\n\nThe Russian military’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine triggered Estonian regulatory institutions to block access to Russian media outlets beginning in February 2022.\n\nAcademic freedom is generally respected. However, by law, public Russian-language high schools must teach 60 percent of their curriculum in the Estonian language, and a new education law adopted in December 2022 requires that the country’s schools transition gradually to Estonian as the only language of instruction. The timeline set out by the law begins with the 2024–25 school year and ends with the 2032–33 school year. However, there are concerns that shortages of teachers and material resources might interfere with the transition timeline. Following the switch, children from Russian-speaking families will be given the opportunity to learn Russian language and culture in separate classes.\n\nThe constitution and laws provide broad safeguards against discrimination based on race, gender, language, sexual orientation, and other such categories. However, Russian-speaking residents continue to face societal discrimination, and some statutes lack robust protections against such bias. Gender discrimination is also a problem, particularly in employment, and the gender pay gap is among the highest in the EU, though it has decreased in recent years. Roma face employment discrimination and disparities in educational outcomes.\n\nThe rhetoric and ideological beliefs of many active EKRE members have increased the prevalence of hostile and extremist views toward Jewish, Muslim, and LGBT+ people, as well as other marginalized groups. In 2020, the European Commission began infringement proceedings against Estonia for failing to match EU regulations for prosecuting hate crimes and criminalizing hate speech in domestic laws; legislation resolving the discrepancies had not been passed as of the end of 2022.\n\nIn August 2022, Estonia legalized the pushback of migrants during “emergencies caused by mass immigration.” Although the measures were not applied systematically during the year, not all Ukrainian refugees attempting to cross the eastern border of the country were permitted to enter. In September, along with other Baltic states and Poland, Estonia effectively closed its borders to Russian citizens.\n\nThere are legal safeguards against exploitative working conditions, and they are generally enforced in practice. The government makes serious and sustained efforts to prosecute those responsible for human trafficking and provide services to victims, though it has encountered difficulties in adequately punishing convicted traffickers and identifying victims, according to the US State Department.\n\nEstonia’s unemployment rate, which had reached 8.7 percent by the end of March 2021 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, fell to 5.2 percent by the end of that year. It then started to rise again, ending 2022 at 5.4 percent. Nearly a fifth of the population remains at risk of poverty or social exclusion."
