        "text": "February 2013 analysts grouped the proposals and comments into 59 bundles of different possible scenarios and provided them with impact analysis. Each of the five main topics was divided into a number of subtopics. Around 30 experts contributed with their professional knowledge by giving an impact assessment of citizens’ policy porposals regarding what implementation of the proposals would bring.\n\nMarch 2013 five thematic seminars on five mentioned topics were held to chose which proposals to submit to the “deliberation day”. During the five seminars that were held, political representatives, experts, and citizens who had contributed to the original proposals in the crowdsourcing process deliberated upon the submitted ideas. The overall aim of the thematic seminars was to single out which of the ideas put forward on the online platform could best solve the problems that led to the creation of the Assembly initiative. As a result, 18 most important issues were selected for the deliberation day\n\nApril 2013: “The Citizen Assembly Day”-held on 6 April, 2013. A stratified random sample from different subsets of the population were selected to participate in the deliberation day. The selection took into account characterization such as place of residence, age and sex to have a representative body of Estonian society. Of the 550 people who were invited, 314 citizens actually chose to participate. The 18 proposals were discussed in the tables of approximately 10 people. Every table was hosted by a moderator to assist the deliberation process. The participants were handed briefing materials regarding each proposal, including the assessments of the experts. Every table’s preferences were eventually aggregated into a group preference via voting. As a result, 15 out of 18 proposals were selected to be sent to the Estonian parlament, the Riigikogu, for legislative amendments.\n\nThe proposals were then presented to the Estonian parliament, Riigikogu, by the President of the Republic, Toomas Hendrik Ilves.\n\nBy summer 2014, three proposals out of the 15 that were sent to the parliament have actually become laws. In addition, four proposals have been partly implemented or redefined as commitments in the government coalition programme. Read more here.\n\nThe People’s Assembly was organized by volunteers from various non-governmental organizations, such as the Estonian Cooperation Assembly, the Praxis Centre for Policy Studies, Network of Estonian Nonprofit Organizations, the e-Governance Academy, the Open Estonia Foundation, as well as political parties, IT and communications professionals, and others."
