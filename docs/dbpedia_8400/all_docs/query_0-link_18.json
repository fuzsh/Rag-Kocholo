The candidate receiving a two-thirds majority is considered elected. If the President is still not elected in the third round of voting, the Speaker of the parliament convenes, within one month, an electoral college to elect the President. The President designates, within 14 days from the resignation of the government, a candidate for Prime Minister to whom he/she assigns the task of forming a new government. The candidate for Prime Minister presents, within 14 days, the programme of the future government to the parliament, after which the parliament decides, without debate and by an open vote, whether to authorise the candidate for Prime Minister to form a government. The candidate, within seven days, presents the cabinet membership to the President, who then appoints the government to office within three days. Term of office of the executive and coincidence with the term of the legislature The President is elected for a term of five years, and may not be elected for more than two consecutive terms. His/Her term does not coincide with that of the parliament, which is four years.

Over the past 10 years, the parliament has never been dissolved. ACCOUNTABILITY Accountability of Government to Parliament Yes The government is accountable to the parliament both collectively and individually. Modalities of oversight\n\nOral and written questions of parliamentarians\n\nThe government's accountability to the parliament is brought into play by oral and written questions, as well as interpellations.\n\nGovernment reports to Parliament\n\nThe government's accountability to the parliament is brought into play by annual reports, although the parliament does not vote on these.

If a no-confidence vote is adopted against a minister, the Speaker of the parliament notifies the President, who dismisses the minister. An expression of no confidence on the same grounds may be initiated no earlier than three months after the previous vote of no confidence. Over the past 10 years, about 10 motions of no confidence have been tabled, all of them by the opposition. One motion of no confidence has been adopted. Dismissal and/or impeachment of Government and other public officials (sub-report)\n\nCircumstances and persons concerned\n\nCriminal charges may be brought against the President, a member of the government, a parliamentarian, the Auditor General or a Judge of the Supreme Court.

If a parliamentarian wishes to put a question, he or she registers himself or herself. The Speaker grants permission to put a question on the agenda. At least three members of government must participate in any question time.

BUDGETARY OVERSIGHT Consultation of Parliament in the preparation of the national budget No The parliament is consulted in the preparation of the national budget regarding its own income and expenditure only. In the preparation of the state budget bill, the ministry of finance will calculate, on the basis of the expenditures prescribed by law, responsibilities delegated to institutions and the prognosis for economic development in the ensuing year. The parliament will then formulate its own budget and submit it to the ministry of finance together with an explanatory letter. Lastly, the government submits the state budget bill to the parliament, where it has to pass three readings to become law. Modalities of oversight\n\nExamination of the budget / finance act by Parliament\n\nWhen the government presents the draft state budget to the parliament, the overview of the state economic situation and the main objectives of the government are accompanied by an explanatory letter. In this letter, the explanations and justifications for the revenues and expenditures planned, and the balancing entries in the draft are given. The draft state budget is debated by the parliament at three readings. After the close of the second reading and at the third reading, committees and factions may submit motions to amend, which must, however, comply with legal conditions.

In practice, the state budget bill for the next year is usually adopted at the end of December. The deadline for adoption of the state budget is two months after the beginning of the budgetary year. Consequences of failure by Parliament to adopt the budget / finance act The state budget passed by the parliament enters into force at the beginning of the budgetary year. If the parliament has not passed the budget by the beginning of the budgetary year, expenditure of up to one twelfth of the expenditure of the preceding budgetary year may be made each month. If the parliament has not passed the budget within two months after the beginning of the budgetary year, the President dissolves the parliament and declares extraordinary elections.

If the parliament again passes the law, which is returned to the President un-amended, the President proclaims the law or proposes to the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional. If the Supreme Court declares the law constitutional, the President proclaims the law.\n\nThe Ombudsman is, in his or her activities, an independent official who reviews the legislation of the legislative and executive authorities and of local governments for conformity with the Constitution. If he or she finds that legislation passed by the legislative or executive authorities or by a local government is in conflict with the Constitution or a law, he or she proposes to the body that passed the legislation to bring the legislation into conformity with the Constitution or the law within 20 days. If the legislation is not brought into conformity within 20 days, he or she proposes to the Supreme Court to declare the legislation invalid.\n\nAlso, in lower court proceedings, the court does not apply any law or legislation that is in conflict with the Constitution. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the state. It reviews court judgments in appeal proceedings and is also the court of constitutional review (Article 149 of the Constitution). The Supreme Court declares invalid any law or other legislation that is in conflict with the provisions and spirit of the Constitution.
