        "text": "Overview\n\nRole: Voice of EU member governments, adopting EU laws and coordinating EU policies\n\nMembers: Government ministers from each EU country, according to the policy area to be discussed\n\nPresident: Each EU country holds the presidency on a 6-month rotating basis\n\nEstablished in: 1958 (as Council of the European Economic Community)\n\nLocation: Brussels (Belgium)\n\nWebsite: Council of the EU\n\nIn the Council of the EU, informally also known as the Council, government ministers from each EU country meet to discuss, amend and adopt laws, and coordinate policies. The ministers have the authority to commit their governments to the actions agreed on in the meetings. Council meetings take place in Brussels, except for three months (April, June and October) when they are held in Luxembourg.\n\nTogether with the European Parliament, the Council is the main decision-making body of the EU.\n\nNot to be confused with:\n\nEuropean Council - quarterly summits, where EU leaders meet to set the broad direction of EU policy making\n\nCouncil of Europe - not an EU body at all\n\nWhat does the Council do?\n\nnegotiates and adopts EU laws, together with the European Parliament, based on proposals from the European Commission\n\ncoordinates EU countries' policies\n\ndevelops the EU's foreign & security policy, based on European Council guidelines\n\nconcludes agreements between the EU and other countries or international organisations\n\nadopts the annual EU budget - jointly with the European Parliament\n\nComposition\n\nThere are no fixed members of the EU Council. Instead, the Council meets in 10 different configurations, each corresponding to the policy area being discussed. Depending on the configuration, each country sends their minister responsible for that policy area.\n\nFor example, when the Council meeting on economic and financial affairs (the \"Ecofin Council\") is held, it is attended by each country's finance minister.\n\nWho chairs the meetings?\n\nThe Foreign Affairs Council has a permanent chairperson - the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. All other Council meetings are chaired by the relevant minister of the country holding the rotating EU presidency.\n\nFor example, any Environment Council meeting in the period when Estonia holds the presidency will be chaired by the Estonian environment minister.\n\nOverall consistency is ensured by the General Affairs Council - which is supported by the Permanent Representatives Committee. This is composed of EU countries' Permanent Representatives to the EU, who are, in effect, national ambassadors to the EU.\n\nEurozone countries\n\nEurozone countries coordinate their economic policy through the Eurogroup, which consists of their economy and finance ministers. It meets the day before Economic & Financial Affairs Council meetings. Agreements reached in Eurogroup gatherings are formally decided upon in the Council the next day, with only ministers of Eurozone countries voting on those issues.\n\nHow does the Council work?\n\nEU ministers meet in public when they discuss or vote on draft legislative acts\n\nto be passed, decisions usually require a qualified majority:\n\n55% of countries (with 27 current members, this means 15 countries)\n\nrepresenting at least 65 % of total EU population\n\nYou can watch the Council's public sessions live in all EU languages. When a Council meeting is public, so are its minutes and votes.\n\nTo block a decision, at least 4 countries are needed (representing at least 35% of total EU population)\n\nexception - sensitive topics like foreign policy and taxation require a unanimous vote (all countries in favour).\n\nSimple majority is required for procedural & administrative issues\n\nThe Council and you\n\nYou can put general questions to the Council's public information service.\n\nAccess to documents\n\nAccess to information\n\nCouncil of the EU meeting agendas\n\nFurther information\n\nWho's who\n\nDates of Council Presidencies\n\nVisit the Council of the EU\n\nPublications\n\nCouncil library"
