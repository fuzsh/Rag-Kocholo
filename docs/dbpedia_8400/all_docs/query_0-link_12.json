        "text": "The prime minister, who serves as head of government, is nominated by the president and approved by the parliament. Following the 2019 parliamentary elections, then prime minister Jüri Ratas of the Center Party was reappointed for a second term as the head of a coalition government comprising the centrist-populist Center Party, the far-right EKRE, and the conservative Isamaa party.\n\nThe governing coalition collapsed in January 2021, when Ratas resigned after several leading officials in his Center Party were implicated in a high-level corruption investigation; Ratas denied any wrongdoing. A new governing coalition, comprising the Center Party and the Reform Party, was formed later that month under the leadership of Reform Party leader Kaja Kallas, who became Estonia’s first woman prime minister.\n\nThe president is elected by the parliament to a five-year term, filling a largely ceremonial role as head of state. In August 2021, Alar Karis was elected as a nonpartisan consensus candidate in a second round of voting, winning the support of all parliamentary parties except the EKRE.\n\nThe constitution establishes a 101-seat, unicameral parliament, called the Riigikogu, whose members are elected for four-year terms using proportional representation in multimember constituencies.\n\nThe March 2019 parliamentary elections met democratic standards. Like in previous elections in 2015, the voter turnout was about 64 percent. Five parties cleared the 5 percent vote threshold for representation, with the main opposition center-right Reform Party capturing a plurality with 34 seats. Electoral support for EKRE more than doubled, which translated into 19 seats. The incumbent Center Party won 26 seats, down one. The number of seats won by Isamaa and the left-wing Social Democratic Party (SDE) dropped to 12 and 10, respectively.\n\nLocal elections were held in October 2021 and saw a voter turnout of 54.7 percent, with 47 percent of all votes cast online.\n\nMore than 5 percent of the country’s population—mostly ethnic Russians—remain stateless and cannot participate in national elections. Resident noncitizens are permitted to vote in local and European Parliament elections but may not run as candidates or join political parties. The authorities have adopted policies to assist those seeking naturalization.\n\nPolitical representation of women is gradually increasing. Former president Kersti Kaljulaid became the first woman in the country’s history to hold her office when she was elected in 2016. Moreover, a record total of 29 women were elected to the 101-seat Riigikogu in 2019. After taking office in 2021, Prime Minister Kallas—the first woman to hold her post—appointed an almost equally gender-balanced cabinet.\n\nThe inclusion of the far-right EKRE in the governing coalition between 2019–21 raised political equality concerns among domestic and international observers due to the party’s history of racist, sexist, anti-LGBT+, and White nationalist sentiments. The party returned to the opposition after former prime minister Ratas resigned in January 2021, but remained popular, taking 13.2 percent of all votes cast in the October local elections. Pushed back into the opposition, EKRE became the most popular party at the end of the year.\n\nThe legal framework and independent law enforcement institutions provide important checks on corruption, and cases against high-profile defendants have been brought to court in recent years, though the results have been mixed. A trial that began in 2017 focused on Edgar Savisaar—former leader of the Center Party and Tallinn city mayor—and a number of codefendants who were accused of bribery, money laundering, and embezzlement. Savisaar was excused from the trial due to poor health in 2018, and defendants including the Center Party itself were punished with fines. A November 2020 Supreme Court ruling rejected appeals lodged by several government officials and businessmen who had been convicted for their roles in the case.\n\nAnother corruption scandal involving the Center Party emerged in January 2021, when it was revealed that party officials had allegedly agreed to provide real estate developer Hillar Teder with access to high-profile development sites in Tallinn, including the Porto Franco property, in return for a donation of €1 million (roughly $1.01 million) from Teder’s son, Rauno Teder, to the party. The Center Party’s involvement in the so-called Porto Franco scandal led to the resignation of then prime minister Jüri Ratas and the collapse of his Center Party–led governing coalition later that month. Official investigations into the scandal—including into Hillar Teder, who spent nearly two months in prison in connection with the case in early 2021—were ongoing at year’s end.\n\nIn another high-profile case, Center Party politician and former Minister of Education and Research Mailis Reps was charged with fraud and embezzlement of ministry funds in November 2021. Reps stepped down as education minister in November 2020 and was stripped of parliamentary immunity in October 2021. The case was ongoing at year’s end.\n\nThere are no comprehensive rules for the protection of whistleblowers, and lobbying is not sufficiently regulated.\n\nThe government generally respects freedom of the press. However, judges have increasingly used the criminal procedure code to restrict media coverage in various cases of public interest, particularly those concerning corruption. Public and private television and radio stations broadcast freely, and there are a number of independent newspapers.\n\nIn recent years, EKRE leaders have verbally attacked journalists, raising concerns about self-censorship, and observers have noted a trend toward ownership concentration, especially at the regional level. Economic dislocation associated with the COVID-19 pandemic led to sharp declines in advertising revenue in 2020, which could exacerbate the media’s vulnerability to editorial pressure.\n\nThe prevalence of antigovernment disinformation campaigns disseminated by pro-Kremlin Russian-language media outlets has reportedly increased in recent years, sparking concern among observers. However, Estonia’s public Russian-language television station, ETV+, which offers an alternative to Russian-language stations that are based outside of Estonia, steadily increased its ratings during 2021.\n\nThe constitution and laws provide broad safeguards against discrimination based on race, gender, language, sexual orientation, and other such categories. However, Russian-speaking residents continue to face societal discrimination, and some statutes lack robust protections against such bias. Gender discrimination is also a problem, particularly in employment, and the gender pay gap is among the highest in the EU, though it has decreased in recent years. Roma face employment discrimination and disparities in educational outcomes.\n\nThe rhetoric and ideological beliefs of many active EKRE members have increased the prevalence of hostile and extremist views toward the Jewish community, LGBT+ people, and Muslims, as well as other marginalized groups. In 2020, the European Commission began infringement proceedings against Estonia for failing to match EU regulations for prosecuting hate crimes and criminalizing hate speech in domestic laws; legislation resolving the discrepancies had not been passed as of the end of 2021."
