        "text": "There are different levels of government in Northern Ireland. This includes your local council, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the UK Parliament at Westminster. Politicians working at the different levels will have different roles and responsibilities.\n\nBackground to devolution in the UK\n\nFollowing referendums in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in 1998 and in Scotland and Wales in 1997, the UK Parliament transferred a range of powers to national parliaments or assemblies.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established, and affirmed responsibility for devolved matters in 1999. The arrangements are different for each, reflecting their history and administrative structures.\n\nThe UK government remains responsible for national policy on all matters that have not been devolved, including foreign affairs, defence, social security, macro-economic management and trade.\n\nIt is also responsible for government policy in England on all the matters that have been devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.\n\nWithin the UK government, the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible for the Scotland Office, the Wales Office and the Northern Ireland Office.\n\nDevolution of powers to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\n\nDevolution in Northern Ireland\n\nDevolution means that the United Kingdom government has transferred a wide range of powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly. This means that local politicians, instead of MPs in Westminster, make key decisions on how Northern Ireland is governed.\n\nSome powers still lie with the UK government. These can be either 'reserved' matters which might transfer to the Northern Ireland Assembly at a future date; or 'excepted' matters which will stay with the UK government indefinitely.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Office is responsible for overseeing the Northern Ireland devolution settlement. It also represents Northern Ireland interests at UK Government level and UK Government interests in Northern Ireland.\n\nFind out more about the devolution settlement in Northern Ireland, including what powers are transferred, reserved or excepted:\n\nDevolution settlement: Northern Ireland\n\nNorthern Ireland Assembly\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly was established as part of the Belfast Agreement (also known as the Good Friday Agreement) in 1998. Devolution to Northern Ireland was suspended in October 2002 and restored on 8 May 2007.\n\nThe Assembly is the cornerstone of the devolved Northern Ireland government. It is where political representatives debate and pass laws on important issues that affect everyone in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt is made up of 90 representatives, known as Members of the Legislative Assembly or MLAs, who come from different political parties and a small number of independent MLAs. Each MLA must identify him or herself as 'Unionist', 'Nationalist' or 'Other'.\n\nFind your local MLA\n\nNorthern Ireland Executive\n\nThe Northern Ireland Executive committee runs the devolved government in Northern Ireland on behalf of the Assembly.\n\nIt is made up of the First Minister and deputy First Minister who are joint Chairs and eight other ministers, seven of which are nominated by the political parties in the Assembly through a procedure known as dâ€™Hondt and the Minister of Justice who is appointed through a cross-community vote in the Assembly.\n\nThe number of ministerial posts any party can have is determined by the number of MLAs they have in the Assembly. Each minister is nominated to take charge of a particular department.\n\nNorthern Ireland government departments\n\nThere are nine Northern Ireland government departments:\n\nDepartment for Communities\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure\n\nDepartment for the Economy\n\nDepartment of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs\n\nDepartment of Education\n\nDepartment of Finance\n\nDepartment of Health\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nThe Executive Office\n\nFind more information and contact details for each department:\n\nGovernment departments in Northern Ireland\n\nUK government\n\nIn the UK, the Prime Minister leads the government with the support of the Cabinet and ministers.\n\nThe Cabinet is made up of the senior members of government.\n\nEvery week during Parliament, members of the Cabinet (Secretaries of State from all departments and some other ministers) meet to discuss the most important issues for the government.\n\nThe UK Parliament, examines what the Government is doing, makes new laws, holds the power to set taxes and debates the issues of the day.\n\nThe House of Commons and House of Lords each play an important role in Parliament's work.\n\nHouse of Commons\n\nThe House of Commons is elected by the public. The political party with the most members forms the government of the UK. Northern Ireland politicians are elected to the House of Commons but the majority come from England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nMPs debate the big political issues of the day and proposals for new laws. You can have a voice in the UK Parliament by voting in the next general election for the Northern Ireland politician who you feel will speak for you and your views.\n\nFind your MP\n\nHouse of Lords\n\nThe House of Lords acts as a revising chamber for law and it works alongside the House of Commons. The Lords shares the task of making and shaping laws and checking and challenging the work of the government.\n\nHouse of Lords\n\nFind Members of the House of Lords\n\nLocal government\n\nLocal government in Northern Ireland is made up of 11 local councils, run by elected councillors. They look after a range of services such as your local sport and leisure centre or arranging your bin collections.\n\nYou can find out more about your local council, what it does and how its funded on the following page:\n\nLocal councils\n\nMore useful links"
