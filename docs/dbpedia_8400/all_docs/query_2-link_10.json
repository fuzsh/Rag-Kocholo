One where most people not only choose to vote online, but freely provide their personal information to the government? A country that serves as a possible model for how digitalization can be used for something other than misinformation and cyberattacks?\n\nSuch a place arguably exists, and its name is Estonia. From government services to taxes and education, the Baltic nation set about transforming itself into a 21st century model for digital democracy soon after the fall of the Soviet Union. On the first episode of the Bloomberg Originals series Exponentially With Azeem Azhar, Azhar sits down with Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, who shares how her government has sought to strengthen Estonian democracy by embracing technology."
