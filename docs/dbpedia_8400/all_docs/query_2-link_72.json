        "text": "With the COVID-19 virus continuing to disrupt daily life, including the provision of governmental services and democratic processes, there are countries who are uniquely set up to handle cataclysmic scenarios. As the New York Times has recognized, Estonia, a Baltic country of 1.3 million people, is positioned to weather this storm because of its nearly complete digitization of governmental processes. Thanks to an innovative combination of online tools— digital signatures, internet voting and public e-services—Estonia is well-equipped to govern during the present global health crisis.\n\nWe are witnessing the difficulties institutions face when it comes to efficient decision-making. In the U.S., institutions like Congress generally work slowly when crafting and approving bills because of our checks and balances system. This has a legacy component, but it also can be traced back to a lack of remote digital tools available for members of Congress for voting on potential legislation. The Senate, for instance, still uses roll-call voting only.\n\nIn contrast, Estonian politicians have the ability to govern from anywhere in the world via digital signature, as it is legally equivalent to a written signature. Estonia’s e-Cabinet system provides an audio-visual interface for government officials to participate remotely. For example, the current President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, digitally signed an annual resolution while on a trip in Antarctica. During crises, Estonia can still expediently and legally continue its democratic processes to pass resolutions, legislation and other decrees.\n\nSince 2005, Estonia has maintained an internet voting system for municipal and national elections (here’s a great explainer of how the system works). In 2019, nearly 44% of Estonian citizens cast their votes in parliamentary elections from 110 different countries—the highest in the nation’s i-voting history. With the primary season in full swing in the United States, alternatives like mail-in voting are being seriously considered because of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nHowever, mail-in voting has its own inefficiencies. As Smartmatic points out, the process could distribute harmful pathogens to election workers. Additionally, election security has been a main concern in the U.S. and around the world. With Estonia successfully implementing i-voting without irregularities, other nations can benefit from observing their process.\n\nNinety-nine percent of Estonian state services are accessible online 24/7. From filing taxes to registering a business, the core functions of governance are still available during this time. Imagine the difficulties of traveling to government offices to apply for benefits when social distancing is in place. While online public services have been increasing over the years globally, the quality and execution of such e-services varies greatly, inhibiting trust and use in those systems. In Estonia’s case, 70 percent of users are satisfied with the current e-service ecosystem.\n\nEstonia’s digital strategy for the public sector is a transformational one. Of course, the foundations are already in place with e-identification cards containing the cryptographic infrastructure necessary for citizens to digitally sign documents. Without this framework and consistent internet connection any e-State will have challenges, but Estonia is a great example of how innovation and digitization can ensure democracy and government services during these trying times."
