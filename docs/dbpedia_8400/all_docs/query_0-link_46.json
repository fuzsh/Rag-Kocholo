        "text": "The top three parties were Isamaa (79,170 votes), the Social Democratic Party (SDE) (71,171) and Reform (66,017). They were followed by EKRE (54,712) and Center (45,767).\n\nThis means Isamaa and SDE will be awarded two mandates and Reform, Center, and EKRE one each. Estonia has seven seats in the parliament.\n\nCompared to the EU elections five years ago, Isamaa gained one mandate and Reform lost one.\n\nSDE's Marina Kaljurand received the most votes (45,633) for the second election running. However, the total fell considerably from 65,549 in 2019.\n\nShe was followed by Reform's Urmas Paet (35,586 votes), Isamaa's Jüri Ratas (33,622), EKRE's Jaak Madison (32,868), Center's Mihhail Kõlvart (27,576) and Isamaa's Riho Terras (23,909).\n\nThanks to Kaljurand's good result, SDE's Sven Mikser was also awarded a seat in the European Parliament (9,991).\n\nKaljurand, Paet, Madison, Terras, and Mikser have all been members of the European Parliament since 2019.\n\nNon-parliamentary party Parempoolsed, participating in its first EU election, won 25,189 ballots or 6.8 percent of the vote but missed out on a mandate. Security expert Rainer Saks was the most popular candidate (12,387).\n\nKoos party's sole candidate Aivo Peterson collected 11,507 ballots.\n\nOf the parliamentary parties, Eesti 200 was the only one that failed to win a mandate. In total, 9,584 people voted for the party – 2.6 percent of the total votes, a worse result than the 3.2 percent it was awarded in 2019.\n\nThe Greens received 2,246 votes. Of the independent candidates, Tanel Talve won the most votes – 1,182. All the rest got fewer than 1,000 votes.\n\nOther well-known politicians who ran but failed to win mandates included EKRE chairman Martin Helme (17,912), Isamaa chairman Urmas Reinsalu (14,250), Center Party MEP Jana Toom (14,141), and Reform member and Minister of Defense Hanno Pevkur (9,390).\n\nTurnout for the 2024 European Parliament elections was 37.7 percent in Estonia compared to the preliminary 51 percent across the European Union. In total, 368,125 people voted which is approximately 37,000 more than at the last election in 2019.\n\nHowever, the turnout figure remains the same as 100,000 Estonians living abroad have been added to the electoral role. If the turnout had been calculated using the 2019 figure, it would have risen to 41.8 percent.\n\nThe results can be viewed here and here on the Estonian National Electoral Committee's website.\n\nThe article was updated to specify the results based on the most recent data.\n\n--"
