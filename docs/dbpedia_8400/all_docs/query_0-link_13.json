        "text": "Estonia re-gained independence from the Soviet Union (USSR) in 1991 (it had been independent from 1918 to 1940), and its transition to democracy was powered by an active civil society, which provided a reformist core to the new political elite, committed to rule of law institutions. Digitalization is regarded as one of the main factors in the country's post-Communism success, with a digitalized public sector contributing to transparent and efficient governance as well as low levels of corruption perceptions. Stronger polarization has appeared recently. As in the rest of Europe, the populist right is gaining influence, due to the rising cost of living and intensifying cultural divides. Issues such as ‘family values’ and immigration are increasingly salient.\n\nAnother important social divide relates to the large Russian-speaking minority (around 25 per cent of the population). Democratization in Estonia was strongly ethnicized, partly because of the repression of national identity during Soviet occupation. After regaining independence, the political doctrine of legal restoration considered all Soviet-era settlers as immigrants, and some believed that these settlers should return to their countries of origin. The introduction of assertive naturalization policies led to deep political and economic inequalities, such as unequal electoral participation and residential segregation between Estonians and the Russian-speaking minority.\n\nStill, prior to Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, ethnic relations had been minimally politicized. Estonian political parties supported by Russian-speaking voters are among the country’s biggest parties and have regularly been included in the governing coalition; this plays a role in defusing ethnic-based mobilization. Moreover, there are notable efforts to address the segregation of communities.\n\nEstonia is consistently high performing in Gender Equality. While existing challenges are most notable in attaining equal access to social and economic decision-making, Estonia continues to make progress, including through a reduction in the gender pay gap. Additionally, women’s representation in the Riigikogu set a new record in 2023, with 30 elected women in the 101 seat parliament. In 2023, Estonia became the first Baltic state to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nIn the years to come, it will be important to watch for how developments in the digitalization of voting, including the introduction of a fully electronic voter registration and ID system and the approval of mobile voting, impact Credible Elections. The 2023 parliamentary elections marked the first time that the number of votes cast online surpassed those in polling stations. Additionally, increasingly tense relations between Estonia and Russia should be watched, especially because of the threat of foreign interference and the potential implications on Civil Liberties of a proposed law which would suspend the right of Russian citizens to vote in local elections."
