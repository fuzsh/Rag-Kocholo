        "text": "Estonia is a politically stable country, with most establishment parties agreeing on the main political and economic challenges. Civil unrest occurs occasionally, but protests are generally conducted peacefully. Demonstrations arising from tensions between Estonian and Russian nationalists have become violent on occasion. Petty theft poses one of the main threats to foreign travelers, who are most commonly targeted in crowded areas such as markets, public transportation hubs, and tourist sites. Credit card theft, burglaries, vehicle theft, and break-ins are also reported. Relations with Russia are made tense by the increased presence of NATO forces in Estonia and disputes over the rights of the Russian minority in the country. The highway network is generally in good condition, but secondary roads are often poorly maintained. Dangerous local driving habits and hazardous winter weather conditions further complicate overland travel. Although medical care in Estonia still falls short of Western standards, the healthcare facilities are good. The country also experiences occasional flooding due to heavy rain. Landmines pose a potential risk to travelers in the rural northeast and east-central regions.\n\nRelations with Russia are made tense by the increased presence of NATO forces in Estonia. The risk of Islamist terrorism is lower than in Western Europe. Pickpocketing, theft, and other petty street crimes do occur, particularly in areas where travelers congregate. Members of ethnic minorities are at risk of attack and harassment by far-right groups, especially during night-time in central Tallinn and Tartu. Demonstrations are generally peaceful. However, some protests over sensitive political and cultural issues have turned violent in the past.\n\nAir travel is safe and in compliance with international safety standards.\n\nRoad conditions are generally good and approach Western European standards, although driving conditions can be poor in the winter.\n\nPort of Tallinn is the biggest port authority in Estonia. It is one of the largest port enterprises of the Baltic Sea and is efficient.\n\nAccess to utilities is good and comparable to other Baltic countries. A fast, nationwide wireless internet and broadband service is available.\n\nEstonia is among the least vulnerable to cybercrime in the European Union.\n\nEstonia generally has a good standard of healthcare. A comprehensive state-funded health system introduced during Soviet rule is currently undergoing restructuring. Medical professionals are well trained but lack resources and equipment. Medical evacuation may be necessary in the event of serious illness or injury. Pharmacies in Tallinn and Tartu are widely available. However, this may not be the case in rural areas.\n\nEstonia is a unitary multi-party parliamentary republic. The President is the head of state and the Prime Minister is the head of government. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet form the government and exercises executive power. The unicameral parliament, or the Riigikogu, exercises legislative power. Parliamentary elections take place once every four years. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nCoalitions featuring a cross-section of political parties are typically required to form the government. Government collapses occasionally occur. State institutions are competent and effective and provide reliable services across the country."
