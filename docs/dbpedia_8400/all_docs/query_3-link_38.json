Both politicians hail from Estonia’s centrist Reform party.\n\nMichal will lead the same majority coalition as his predecessor, which is composed of Reform, the liberal party Estonia 200 and the center-left Social Democrats.\n\nAt Monday’s parliamentary session, Michal gave a 20-minute presentation on his governmental agenda in which he justified tax increases on defense and security grounds, promised reforms to governance and stimulation of economic growth, and defended the green transition."
