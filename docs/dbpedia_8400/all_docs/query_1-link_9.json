        "text": "Overview of the government of Estonia\n\nFor the subdivision of the Russian Empire also known as the \"Government of Estonia\", see Governorate of Estonia.\n\nGovernment of the Republic of EstoniaEstonian: Eesti Vabariigi valitsusOverviewEstablished24 February 1918Dissolvedsuspended from 17 June 1940 – 21 August 1991 (de facto)StateRepublic of EstoniaLeaderPrime Minister of EstoniaAppointed byPresident of EstoniaMain organGovernment Office of EstoniaHeadquartersRahukohtu 3, 15161 Tallinn, EstoniaWebsitewww .valitsus .ee /en\n\nThe Government of the Republic of Estonia (Estonian: Vabariigi Valitsus) is the cabinet of Estonia. Under the Constitution, it exercises executive power pursuant to the Constitution and laws of Estonia.\n\nThe cabinet carries out the country's domestic and foreign policy, shaped by parliament (Riigikogu); it directs and co-ordinates the work of government institutions and bears full responsibility for everything occurring within the authority of executive power. The government, headed by the Prime Minister, thus represents the political leadership of the country and makes decisions in the name of the whole executive power.\n\nThe following duties are attributed to the cabinet by the Constitution of Estonia:[1]\n\nexecutes the domestic and foreign policies of the state;\n\ndirects and co-ordinates the activities of government agencies;\n\nadministers the implementation of laws, resolutions of the Riigikogu (Parliament), and legislation of the President of the Republic of Estonia;\n\nintroduces bills, and submits international treaties to the Riigikogu for ratification and denunciation;\n\nprepares the draft of the state budget and submits it to the Riigikogu, administers the implementation of the state budget and presents a report on the implementation of the state budget to the Riigikogu;\n\nissues regulations and orders on the basis of and for the implementation of law;\n\nmanages relations with other states;\n\nperforms other duties which the Constitution and the laws vest in the Government of the Republic.\n\nUnlike other cabinets in most other parliamentary regimes, the Government is both the de jure and de facto executive authority in Estonia. In most other parliamentary regimes, the head of state is usually the nominal chief executive, though bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In Estonia, however, the Constitution explicitly vests executive authority in the Government, not the President.\n\nCurrent cabinet\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Kaja Kallas' third cabinet\n\nThe current cabinet was approved by the Riigikogu on 17 April 2023.\n\nThe coalition agreed on 12 ministers in addition to the prime minister with six portfolios going to Reform and three for both Estonia 200 and the Social Democrats.[2]\n\nPortfolio Minister Took office Left office Party Government's Office Prime Minister17 April 2023IncumbentReform Ministry of Finance Minister of Finance17 April
