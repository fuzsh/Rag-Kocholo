        "text": "The overall goal of the project is to empower the innovation of Estonian democratic institutions. In the light of growing global challenges, it is important that democratic institutions are able to remain relevant in the new context (compared to, for example, how parliaments around the world tended to be sidelined during the pandemic) and continue to fulfill their responsibilities (including human rights protection).\n\nThis requires that NGOs also work systematically and continuously to develop democratic institutions. To this end, NGOs must be able to analyze the shortcomings of the relevant institutions, launch a meaningful public discussion on these shortcomings (and thereby raise awareness of the mechanisms, problems and possible solutions for developing democracy) and directly influence the functioning of democratic institutions through advocacy activities.\n\nTherefore, a coalition of regional democracy development organizations and researchers will be launched during this project to bring international experience and expertise to Estonia, to enable the exchange of best practices and ideas, and to promote systematic international cooperation on democracy innovation.\n\nThe project has been created in collaboration with The Oslo Center (TOC) and is being implemented in cooperation with another partner from Norway – The Christian Democratic Party of Norway (KrF). Their long-term expertise in the development of democracy creates strong preconditions for the implementation of the project. Their role as experts in the project is to help lay a solid foundation for the coalition to be formed and its activities. During the project, another 12-15 non-governmental organizations engaged in democracy development and research institutions from Estonia and other countries around the region will be involved in the coalition.\n\nProject funding: 77 454,77€"
