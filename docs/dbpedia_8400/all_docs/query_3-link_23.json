        "text": "With the government change in early 2021, Estonia’s political situation normalized after two tumultuous years. The media are free in Estonia and civil rights are respected. The judicial system continued to operate effectively during the pandemic due to high levels of digitalization. Local municipal council elections demonstrated that electoral processes function well; the number of votes cast online reached an all-time high since 2005 when it was first introduced. The presidential election in the parliament, on the other hand, showed that the current system of electing the non-executive head of state needs reviewing. Although levels of corruption remain lower in Estonia compared to other post-communist countries, corruption is still deeply integrated into the political system, both at the national and local levels. High-profile corruption scandals have had limited political ramifications, pointing to shortcomings in patterns of accountability.\n\nThe year started with a government collapse when Prime Minister Jüri Ratas (Center Party) announced his resignation on January 13, 2021, as a result of the corruption investigation into alleged misuse of pandemic-related relief funds. Tensions between the coalition partners—Center Party, Estonian Conservative People’s Party (EKRE), and Isamaa—also contributed to the decision. According to the constitution, when the prime minister resigns, the whole government must as well. Just hours after stepping down, however, Center was invited into negotiations by Kaja Kallas, chair of the Reform Party that won the 2019 general elections, who was tasked with forming a new government. The new coalition can be characterized as liberal, but the inclusion of Center—a party with very serious corruption allegations—sent a strong signal that shady dealings are not fully condemned in Estonian politics. Given that the now ruling Reform Party had alternative options in forming the government, this move indicates a level of impunity and normalization of political corruption, and apathy towards corruption in the society. On a broader scale, the Center corruption scandal points to structural problems in the country’s party financing. Political parties are disproportionally dependent on large donations from wealthy contributors, which provides favorable conditions for intertwining business and politics. Therefore, rules regarding party financing need revision in order to restore political trust and credibility.\n\nThe new government’s key challenge in 2021 was the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. After relative success in tackling the first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020, the second wave peaking in spring 2021 and the third in fall 2021 hit the nation considerably harder in terms of the number of cases and deaths, revealing major weaknesses in the capacity of the medical sector. However, the state’s coronavirus measures remained among the mildest in Europe. Unlike the first wave of the pandemic, an emergency situation was not declared in 2021, and the government response was characterized by vague communication and hesitancy to implement harsh measures. In the fall, tougher restrictions were introduced only after the conclusion of the October municipal elections, suggesting that crisis management was put on hold for political considerations. The government’s immunization strategy was similarly lacking, since by the end of the year only 61.7 percent of Estonia’s population was fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Public willingness to get vaccinated was lowest among the country’s Russian-speaking population, despite the fact that Ida-Viru County, the largest Russian-speaking geographical region, was the epicenter of coronavirus cases throughout the pandemic. Lower levels of compliance among Russian speakers may be attributed partly to socioeconomic and health inequities but also are due to a lack of political trust. The coronavirus issue was heavily politicized by the radical-right EKRE, whose conservative supporters were skeptical of the health risks and less likely to adhere to social distancing, masking, and vaccination protocols. Corona skeptics and anti-vaxxers were mostly active online, but a few anti-restriction and anti-vaccination demonstrations also took place. The largest was held in the capital Tallinn on October 23 and attracted several thousand people. This protest was organized by a conservative nongovernmental organization (NGO) associated with EKRE and created societal backlash, given that it took place when the medical system was on the verge of collapse.\n\nPublic dissatisfaction with the government’s management of the health crisis was reflected in shrinking support for the governing parties. Incumbent popularity suffered another hit when electricity prices rose to record highs in the fall due to insufficient capacity in the energy market. Rattled by the crises, as well as by frictions between and within the coalition partners, the government ended the year with uncertainty over its longevity. This fed the ratings of populist EKRE, which, after being forced into opposition in the beginning of the year, continued its confrontational style and became a vocal critic of government policy. EKRE made use of the pandemic by taking a clear anti-establishment stance to mobilize alienated population groups with low political trust. The party repeatedly discounted science in pursuit of its political objectives, called for civil disobedience against mandatory restrictions, which it labeled violations of freedom, and even called for overthrowing the democratically elected government. Siding with anti-vaxxers and anti-restriction protesters secured EKRE a solid second place in opinion polls and, according to some, even the position of most popular party in Estonia for a brief period. Ahead of the local elections in October, EKRE worked to sway the votes of Russian speakers. Despite its deeply nationalist ideology, the party’s conservative positions—objecting to same-sex marriage, for example—appeal to some members of the Russian-speaking community. EKRE’s other messages to this electorate include opposition to NATO and the green energy transition, the latter especially salient in the country’s eastern region that relies heavily on the shale oil industry for jobs and wages. Yet EKRE’s efforts did not translate into votes; while showing a strong performance in Estonian-populated rural areas, the party failed to mobilize the Russian vote, particularly in the eastern region of the country.\n\nThe October elections results showed several positive developments in local democratic governance in Estonia and also provided a few indications of future politics. Single-party rule in some of the country’s major cities was broken after the Center Party’s long reign. In combination with the relative success of EKRE and a strong entry by newcomer Eesti 200, the results indicated that the long-frozen political landscape had begun to favor smaller anti-establishment parties. These forces are reshaping the country’s political cleavages in line with the value conflict dominant in Western politics. Smaller parties have improved their organizational capacity in smaller communities, laying a solid groundwork for success in the national elections in 2023. The struggle for “Russian votes” continues, but unless strong local leaders speak up for local interests (as in Tallinn), it is difficult to secure the trust of population segments that are socioeconomically disadvantaged and have long felt alienated. Still, without the support of Russian speakers, parties will be unable to achieve significant electoral gains in the near future."
