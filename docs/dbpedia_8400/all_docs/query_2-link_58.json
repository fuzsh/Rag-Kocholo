        "text": "No 162-E\n\nAt his meeting in Tallinn today with Secretary General of the Community of Democracies Maria Leissner, Foreign Minister Urmas Paet said that Estonia would like to spread and strengthen democracy in the world – however, in order for this to happen there must be co-operation among democratic states. “Supporting and strengthening democracy through such co-operation is precisely the goal of the Community of Democracies,” Paet said.\n\nForeign Minister Paet stated that Estonia is trying to facilitate the development of democracy by sharing its reform experiences within the framework of bilateral and multilateral development co-operation. “One essential sector to which Estonia contributes, based on its own reform experiences, is the development of e-governance,” Paet stated. “Within this sector we focus on, for example, organising public services and making public data accessible, as well as good administrative practice,” explained the Estonian foreign minister.\n\nPaet also noted that Estonia together with the United States is the co-chairman of the consultation project for new democracies and their leaders LEND, which functions within the framework of the Community of Democracies. “The purpose of LEND is to create a consultation network through which to support modernisation and democratisation in transitioning states and share our reform and e-state experiences,” he stated.\n\nThe consultation project for new democracies and their leaders LEND (Leaders Engaged in New Democracies) was announced in 2012 by Secretary of State of the United States of America Hillary Clinton and Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet at a meeting of the Community of Democracies in Mongolia. The goal of LEND is to support democratic reforms in the governments and civil societies of transitioning countries through the virtual consultation network LEND. The network will also advise the new democratically chosen leaders of these countries."
