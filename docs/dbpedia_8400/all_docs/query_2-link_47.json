        "text": "History of Democracy in Estonia\n\nDemocracy in Estonia traces back to the Estonian Declaration of Independence in 1918 in the aftermath of World War I. After the short 2-year Estonian War of Independence (Vabadussõda), the first Estonian constitution was drafted in 1920, with a liberal parliamentary system. For a brief period before 1934, Estonia enjoyed political freedom with free elections and referendums; however, the imbalance of power between the parliament (Riigikogu) and the executive and judiciary branches of government led to frequent changes of government and instability. This came to an end when a referendum passed a new constitution proposed by the Estonian War of Independence Veterans’ League (Vaps Movement). The populist Vaps Movement was seen as an imminent threat to the then-State Elder (Head of State) Konstantin Päts as Hitler and many populist takeovers emerged across Europe. Päts initiated a preventive coup d’etat leading to the Era of Silence, where political activities were heavily purged until the new constitution was enacted in 1938. The new constitution changed Estonia from a unicameral Riigikogu to a bicameral National Assembly. Not long after, most pre-World War II institutions were dispersed due to the occupation of the Soviet Union in 1940, the German occupation between 1941–1944, and the Soviet Union occupation until 1991, with the exception of the 5-day resurrection of the 1938 constitution between the second Soviet Union occupation and the withdrawal of Nazi Germany.\n\nThe current constitution, enacted in 1992 after the lift of the iron curtain, incorporates the past constitutions which restore the unicameral legislature (Riigikogu) but divert power from the head of state (President) to the Prime Minister. There have been eight elections as of 2020 after independence, with each election held every four years under a proportional representation electoral system. In addition, after passing the referendum on participation in the European Union in 2003, European parliamentary elections were held every five years. Recently, two challenges linger in Estonian politics, namely concerns over corruption after money laundering in Estonian branches of Danske Bank and Swedbank in 2018 and the rise and inclusion of the populist, far-right Conservative People’s Party of Estonia (EKRE) in the coalition government in 2019.\n\nStatus of E-Democracy in Estonia\n\nAfter the independence of Estonia from the Soviet Union in 1991, Estonia included information technology in its new governance blueprint. In 1993, the Department of State Information Systems (Riigi Infosüsteemide Osakond, RISO) was established to supervise all governmental organs’ IT development plans. First drafted in 1994 and approved in 1998, the Principles of Estonian Information Policy (Eesti Infopoliitika Põhialused) served as the action plan for the future deployment of all e-governance services, outlining the progression of Estonia to a fully-electronic society. With projects, such as Tiger Leap (Tiigrihüpe), enhancing infrastructure and awareness of information technology, e-democracy was initiated by the Identity Documents Act 2000, which made it compulsory for all people living in Estonia to hold an electronic identity card (eID card). This built the foundation of i-Voting in 2015, where Estonia became the first country to have legally binding votes cast via the Internet. As of now, approximately a third of the electorate votes electronically.\n\nHowever, i-Voting does not guarantee success in e-democracy, which has shown the discrepancy between media appraisal of e-government outside of Estonia and its e-democracy index. Simply, success in i-Voting does not indicate increasing incorporation and participation of citizens in politics. Or in other words, institutional change of the political establishment cannot be achieved with only i-Voting. Therefore, e-participation initiatives, such as TOM (Täna Otsustan Mina, or “Today I Decide”), Osale.ee, and Petitsioon.ee, are crucial to the success of Estonia e-democracy success. These platforms enable citizens’ active participation in policymaking through online forums. Nevertheless, the success of these websites is highly variable. For example, a high budget and effort were put into Osale.ee and TOM that resulted in vain, while Petitsioon.ee had higher participation but was limited by its design.\n\nFurthermore, even with successful e-participation platforms, corruption still resides in the political establishment and remains unresolved, with data security and privacy from cyberattacks in 2007 and money laundering from e-residency in 2018 still plaguing the foundation of e-democracy in Estonia.\n\nRegardless of the flaws in e-democracy and e-government, under the COVID-19 crisis, Estonia definitely had the upper hand in maintaining essential governmental functions during the age of social distancing and work-from-home. From the judiciary system (e-Justice), the executive cabinets (e-Cabinet), to the education system (e-learning), Estonia found a way to digitize them through the strong digital infrastructure planned from the existence of the nation. This demonstrated the strength of a digitized society during a pandemic that shattered the basic operation of numerous governments around the world.\n\nStatus of Deliberative Democracy in Estonia\n\nDeliberative democracy refers to the active participation of citizens in policymaking on numerous topics with the focus on the dialogue among citizens from various backgrounds to solve the disproportional representation of a specific slice of the population in the electorate. In Estonia, dissatisfaction with representative democracy stemmed from the passing of a widely-unpopular campaign finance bill, which enabled the nearly €1 million public funding to the political parties in 2011, and the “Silvergate” scandal in 2012. The Silvergate scandal embodies the uncovering of illegal funneling of money from unknown sources during the parliamentary campaign by former ruling party (Reformed Party) Member of Parliament Silver Meikar on Estonian newspaper Postimees. This led to the publication of Harta 12 (“Charter 12”), which calls for transparency and the end to corruption in the political system of Estonia, and a widely-signed petition on Petitsioon.ee calling for change and dialogue. Ultimately, the discontent led to the Kadriorg Ice Cellar Initiative, where then-President, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, summoned a meeting with political parties as well as representatives from the public in the old Ice Cellar in Kadriorg, resulting in the one-time crowdsourcing initiative, Rahvakogu (“The People’s Assembly”) in 2013 where Estonian citizens discuss remedies for political corruption. Afterwards, a “Deliberation Day” would be held where proposals were discussed and voted on. The procedure of Rahvakogu is outlined into three stages:\n\nThe initial crowdsourcing stage involved e-democracy measures where proposals and discussions were held online, attracting 60,000 visitors, generating 6,000 proposals as well as 4,000 comments on them.\n\nThe second stage involved experts manually synthesizing the proposals into summaries and assessing their impacts accordingly. These experts include specialists in political science, economics, and law.\n\nThe last stage was the Deliberation Day (Rahvakogu) held on April 6, 2013. Random samples were drawn from the entire population using the government’s national database aided by the e-government infrastructure. In total, 550 citizens were selected, with 314 participating in discussing 18 amendments at tables of about ten people. At last, the top 15 ideas were voted upon and sent to the parliament.\n\nThe entire process is summarized in the figure above.\n\nPost-Rahvakogu Deliberative Democracy\n\nAlthough Rahvakogu was successful, enthusiasm over deliberative democracy did not continue with only three major deliberative events happening after the 2013 event, including the People’s Assembly on Future of Aging in 2017, #HOWDOWELAST? Deliberations around shrinking population issues, and The Forestry Assembly in 2019. The events generally followed the same procedure similar to Rahvakogu, but with fewer people attracted and lower public participation compared to Rahvakogu. The outcome of these events was sent to the parliament, which ended up either in the passing of legislation (the Forestry Assembly) or only in a broader discussion (People’s Assembly on Future of Aging).\n\nWas Deliberative Democracy a Success?\n\nResearchers have evaluated the outcome of Rahvakogu and found that the event attracted high participation through the robust digital platform embedded in the Estonian society, but only the politically active citizens were represented disproportionally in the discussion — middle-aged, well-educated ethnic Estonian men dominated the event (see figure above). This indicated that e-participation was a double-edged sword that increased public participation for the technology-savvy population while marginalizing minorities that are further underrepresented in the discussion. Furthermore, even though the population was drafted to participate in the deliberation day seminars, Estonian was the language of conduct, marginalizing a quarter of the population who are ethnically Russian.\n\nDeliberative Democracy and E-Democracy\n\nFrom the success in i-Voting and e-government, it is natural to think that e-participation and, therefore, deliberative democracy would be successful in Estonia. However, the fundamental difference between voting and deliberation brings about cognitive dissonance. Specifically, the essence of i-Voting is to boost the efficiency of voting by replacing long waiting time and physical movement with fast and virtual online voting, while online deliberation is challenged by barriers that contribute to mixed successes. For example, the poor integration of the e-participation platforms with the government ultimately results in the discrepancy between the expectation of the public and the actual execution of the proposal after deliberation (e.g., transparency and communication after submitting into the parliament are unknown). On the bright side, i-Voting and e-government services are generally the middlemen between the government and the public, so digitalization makes it convenient for the public while reducing the silos present among governmental agencies. On the other hand, deliberative democracy and e-participation are built on the foundations of the dialogue among citizens, requiring the participation of all citizens, which is hard to achieve with the current system in reality.\n\nWe see that the problems that i-Voting/e-government and e-participation/deliberative democracy are answering are fundamentally different. I-Voting and e-government only increase the efficiency of current functions of the political arena, while e-participation/deliberative democracy shake the past establishment and rules on how political affairs are managed and amended in a nation. Though, it is worth mentioning that the digitization of government could lead to more transparent and faster communication compared to traditional methods in the case where the public demands deliberation, shown in the example of Rahvakogu. Therefore, success in deliberative democracy cannot be guaranteed even in a strong digitized nation.\n\nConclusion\n\nEstonia’s success in e-government originated from the forward-thinking perspectives of the population after independence. However, this success cannot be easily transferred to deliberative democracy due to the difference in the target problem the two instruments are solving. Plagued by corruption in the political establishment and now far-right parties, the digitized nation is now facing challenges that could be successfully solved by deliberation. Nevertheless, from past efforts and events, we see that problems, such as the underrepresentation of minority groups, language differences, and lack of integration with the current political system, challenge the efficacy of the outcome and participation in future events after Rahvakogu in 2013, leading to mostly failed attempts.\n\nAuthor’s Note: the research was mostly conducted in the English language, therefore, research or events only available in Estonian and Russian were not presented."
