Estonia is a parliamentary republic with a single-chamber parliament. The Estonian parliament has 101 members and influences the governing of the state primarily by determining the income and expenses of the state (establishing taxes and adopting the budget). At the same time, the parliament has the right to present statements, declarations and appeals to the people of Estonia, ratify and denounce international treaties with other states. Furthermore, the parliament elects and appoints several high officials of the state, including the President of the Republic.

The government of Estonia is formed by the Prime Minister and approved by the parliament. The government carries out the countryâ€™s domestic and foreign policy, shaped by parliament; it directs and co-ordinates the work of government institutions and bears full responsibility for everything occurring within the authority of executive power.

Estonia has pursued the development of the e-state and e-government. Internet voting is used in general elections.
