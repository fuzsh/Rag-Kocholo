As for the colors with which Ms. Beauchemin had the house repainted, they are quite pleasing, though I feel they should not have been chosen, as they are not the original color of the era of grandeur of these houses, and this is not a private house any more.\n\nIndeed, a plaque for Queen Farida seems a good idea.\n\nBest,\n\nPF\n\nPS: I understand from my mother Nora, that Ovadia died in the apartment of his daughter Yvette, in a parallel (to the house) street in Zamalek.\n\nSubject: 5 Kamel Mohammed\n\nDate: Wed, 25 Oct 2000 22:16:23 -0400 (EDT)\n\nFrom: Marisa T. Dery\n\nDear Samir Raafat,\n\nJust a note to say how delighted I was to have found you article. I was privilege to live at 5 Kamel Mohammed from 1977-1980 , and , due to my age at the time, was not aware of its history. I truly feel honoured to have lived in such a beautiful house with such an interesting past. Egypt will always have a special place in my heart, and I feel blessed to have lived there (and believe it or not, I was born in Israel...)\n\nSincerely,\n\nMarisa T. Dery\n\nSubject: pink\n\nDate: Wed, 08 Aug 2001 10:39:36 +0100\n\nFrom: Anthony Rowell\n\nTHE BUILDING LOOKS LOVELY PINK, ONE REASON IS THAT IT IS A GOOD COLOUR FOR A HOT CLIMATE COUNTRY. I WOULD SAY THAT THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE A PLAQUE ON BUILDINGS WHERE FAMOUS PEOPLE LIVE, ONE THING IS THAT IT IS GOOD FOR TOURISM AS PEOPLE LIKE TO VISIT PLACES OF INTEREST.\n\nCOMMENTS ON POLL\n\nPink is boring\n\n1/10/01 3:04:38 PM\n\nGood luck in getting things put right! - From Tom Harris of Canada\n\n1/10/01 2:30:46 AM\n\nI would really like to see a plaque. Gold or silver would go nicely with pink.\n\n1/9/01 9:10:4 PM\n\nI don't think the pink is as gaudy as everyone has made it out to be. It's very subdued - I like it. But the plaque should definitely be put up.\n\n1/9/01 6:56:0 PM\n\nEgyptians have a beautiful & World renown past and we should respect that.\n\n1/9/01 3:07:24 PM\n\nThe embassy belongs to the Canadian People and we will decide what goes on the walls.\n\n1/9/01 3:01:8 PM\n\nEgyptians have a beautiful & World renown past and we should respect that\n\n1/9/01 2:49:36 PM\n\nShe deserves a plaque. The pink paint job is beautiful.\n\n1/9/01 2:44:51 PM\n\nyes, why not?\n\n1/7/01 9:38:11 PM\n\nIt would have never been as nice if the house was in any colour beside \"Pink.\" Yes, yes.\n\n1/7/01 2:24:47 AM\n\nYes, yes.......Egypt was at its BEST during her time!\n\n1/7/01 2:22:4 AM\n\nOf couse, we are very proud of the past and she was the Queen of Egypt\n\n1/7/01 2:20:31 AM\n\nyeah...\n\n1/7/01 1:41:39 AM\n\nfashion shouldn't determain who should be remembered and how!!!\n\n1/5/01 5:47:35 AM\n\nshe is part of the country, and what a better way to show appreshiation then to give her a plaque on the Canadian Embassy Residence!\n\n1/5/01 4:53:46 AM\n\nIt is the least we owe her\n\n1/2/01 11:49:18 PM\n\nShe was the queen of a piece of Egypt's history\n\n1/2/01 11:47:25 PM\n\nA true Queen. I had the priviledge of being introduced to Her and Farouk, shortly after their marriage. I was a little boy in short pants\n\n1/1/01 10:1:10 AM\n\nWhy not, so much of Cairo's Belle Epoque is beng destroyed one a daily bais, it is time we begin to look at this aspect of it\n\n1/1/01 4:57:57 AM\n\nyes\n\n12/31/00 9:38:3 PM\n\nShe represent a piece of Egypt's History and should not be forgotten\n\n12/29/00 10:58:22 PM\n\nyeeeees\n\n12/10/00 6:55:55 AM\n\nShe is part of our history\n\n12/14/00 2:19:29 PM\n\nIt is up to the Canadian government to place such a plaques on its property. After all, the Queen just rented the place temporerly.\n\n12/13/00 3:10:27 PM\n\nIt would be an honor for the Canadian Embassy to have the plaque on their wall! What are they waiting for????\n\n12/13/00 2:47:13 PM\n\nAs a Canadian citizen i have no objections Its all part of the great Egyptian history.\n\n12/13/00 2:30:58 AM\n\nyes\n\n12/12/00 8:03:18 PM\n\ncan't deny the past\n\n12/12/00 1:0:0 AM\n\ncivilized people should honour heritage .. not just their own , but everyone else's\n\n12/10/00 4:32:59 PM\n\nBy all means, she is part of Egypt's heritage\n\n12/10/00 6:55:55 AM\n\nI am a canadian citizen, and I agree with you guys.\n\n12/7/00 12:21:19 AM\n\nTell Her Excellency Mme Beauchemin that the federal elections are over and her job is safe. It is time to shake those bureaucrats in Ottawa.\n\n12/7/00 10:15:39 AM\n\na plaque is usuallyv for a person who's contribution to his country, science ,art, politics..,etc.is attributed\n\n12/5/00 11:48:29 AM\n\nI believe that plaques should be placed all over Egypt where something important happened or where someone famous stayed/lived/died or loved.\n\n12/4/00 11:27:41 AM\n\ndesde la isla de gran canaria, farida era una marabilla\n\n12/3/00 4:19:37\n\nForget the bureaucrats and thc civil servants. take yourcase directly to the Canadian press.\n\n12/3/00 7:21:10\n\nI believe that Egypt should be proud of its modern history, Queen Farida was a fine lady that belonged to a great family. \"God Save the queen\"\n\n12/3/00 4:4:3 AM\n\nThe answer: yes indeed. The omission of the plaque will not diminish the charms of the Queen.\n\n12/3/00 4:13:56 AM\n\nWhy not? Everybody should be proud to deliver an hommage to a beloved former Queen. And the shape of the plaque can be changed.\n\n12/3/00 4:8:29 AM\n\nEgypt's own people should be honored now.\n\n12/2/00 7:45:39 PM\n\nHer late Majesty Queen Farida was well liked and respected and is a part of the history of Cairo she deserves to be remembered and honoured.\n\n12/2/00 12:41:56 AM\n\nI belong to the family of Mehmet Ali Pasha. Your article on Queen Farida moved me deeplly & reminded me of the love and respect I always have for her.\n\n12/1/00 4:46:2\n\nOut of many members of the Egyptian royalty, Queen Farida was loved and admired by Egyptians before and after the revolution.\n\n12/1/00 2:43:41 AM\n\nVery happy of result\n\n11/30/00 6:53:36 PM\n\nThis is part of Cairo's history and should be recognized\n\n11/30/00 6:07:8 PM\n\nI think she should lose\n\n11/30/00 12:54:48 AM\n\nNo rational reason for not having the plaque - After all Q. Farida did live in that house.\n\n11/29/00 4:17:51 PM\n\nA plaque by definition commemorates an event that ocurred in history. Those who deny historic facts are burying their heads in the sand.\n\n11/29/00 4:14:41 PM\n\nAbsolutely - No reason to vote against it. History should never be changed.\n\n11/29/00 4:05:13 PM\n\nI believe that the movement initiated by Mr. Smr Raafat to commemorate historic buildings in Cairo should be encouraged.\n\n11/28/00 11:05:26 PM\n\nSafinaz as she (Queen Farida) was really went to school at Notre Dame de Sion in Avenue Ismail Sidki Pasha which was renamed Avenue Malika Farida.\n\n11/28/00 9:38:7 AM\n\nQueen Farida was a fine lady. It is true she made a mistake by insisting on a divorce from King Farouk... ( See her memoirs).\n\n11/28/00 8:59:44 AM\n\nWhy is Ottawa dragging its feet? They should be proud to own such a house. Canada is still a monarchy or am I missing something here?\n\n11/28/00 5:05:57 AM\n\nnew Canadian chancery (expected opening 2002) in Cairo's Garden City district\n\nWe are moving too quickly as a human race. It's important that we sit back and remember our history. In time little of what is old will be left. Regards, Norbert Schiller\n\n11/28/00 1:9:0 AM\n\nSubject: Re: Pretty in Pink\n\nDate: Mon, 20 Nov 2000 02:50:41 -0800 (PST)\n\nI love that house with a passion. I never did like it white but I loathe the pink. Someone took a very sophisticated house and turned it into something that looks vaguely like the newest in the Mattel line of Barbie Doll palaces. As for the plaque---if it is line with Canadian government policy I think it is a wonderful idea and I say, yes! If the ambassador is worried about it attracting the attention of passersby and thereby cutting into her privacy----why paint it candy floss pink???\n\nSubject: Plaque for Queen Farida\n\nDate: Thu, 23 Nov 2000 16:51:08 -0800\n\nFrom:\"Maryse Zeitouni\" MARLANDERS@peoplepc.com\n\nAs a child growing up in Cairo, I always admired Queen Farida for her beauty within and without. It is fitting for a plaque to be dedicated to such a noble lady. (What she ever saw in King Farouk, I'll never know.) I know I'm being unfair ... he started out as a handsome, courteous young man, unfortunately too weak not to succumb to the corrupting influences surrounding him. What a waste, what a pity.\n\nCanada recognizes Queen Elizabeth II as its sovereign. So what's the problem?\n\n11/26/00 4:38:36 PM\n\nBlue on pink would look just great. Regards, Clement Dassa\n\n11/24/00 8:59:13 PM\n\nBeauchemin should change her name to Bellemaison\n\n11/23/00 10:11:22 PM\n\nKeep fighting, we back you.\n\n11/21/00 11:15:8 PM\n\nKeep up the good work.\n\n11/19/00 12:14:37 AM\n\nQueen Farida was a beautiful asset to a wonderful country, If anyone deserves a plaque, she does.\n\n11/17/00 6:55:34 PM\n\nGood idea!\n\n11/17/00 1:29:42 PM\n\nBecause it is no longer Egyptian property\n\n11/16/00 10:41:19 AM\n\nAfter all Queen Farida is a personality and I think Egypt should give credit to nobility and recognize that they existed and were real.\n\n11/16/00 3:41:34 AM"
