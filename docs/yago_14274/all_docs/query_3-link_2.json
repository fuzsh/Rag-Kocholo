        "text": "Princess Ferial Farouk was the eldest daughter of the late King Farouk of Egypt. Her birth came at a time when her father was at the height of his popularity, married to the beautiful and equally popular Farida Zulfiqar.\n\nFarouk had wanted a son, but when he learned Farida had given birth to a daughter, he announced that ''it will be loved just the same'', and named the child Ferial after his paternal grandmother. (All the Egyptian royals took names starting with the auspicious ''F''.) Every child born in Egypt that day received a pound; food and clothing were given to the poor, and sweets were given to children.\n\nFerial was born on November 17, 1938, when Farouk was 18 and Farida just 17. Her early years reflected the high life of Cairene society at the Abdin Palace. A year after her birth, Farouk's sister Fawzia married the Shah of Iran. Farouk considered marrying Ferial to King Faisal of Iraq when the two came of age.\n\nThe Egyptian royal family was popular at a time when Britain, represented by the mighty ambassador Sir Miles Lampson, was taking a heavy hand with the king as World War II approached. The crucial year 1942 saw a British coup d'etat in which Farouk, accused of pro-German leanings, only just managed to escape being forced to abdicate.\n\nFerial was born when her mother was losing out in a power struggle with Farouk's powerful mother, Queen Nazly, who doted on her son. Farouk's liaison with Princess Fatma Tussoun deeply hurt Farida, while her own friendship with the painter Simon Elwes gave rise to gossip. The marriage ended in divorce, and Farouk married Narriman Sadeq, with whom he had a son and heir, Fouad.\n\nFarouk was ousted in a revolution in 1952 in favour of the baby Fouad. He loaded his gold into 12 ammunition boxes and had servants sent to Montazah Palace to collect Queen Narriman's jewellery, then he, Narriman, Fouad and Ferial and her sisters, Fawzia and Fadia, left on the royal yacht Mahroussa for Naples, Capri and then Rome. Fouad was removed from his position when Egypt was declared a republic in 1953.\n\nOver the years, Ferial resisted intense pressure to speak to the media. However, recently, she gave several important interviews on Arab television channels. In these she made a dramatic revelation: that a group within Egypt's new revolutionary council had tried to torpedo Mahroussa as it sailed for Italy, and failed only because of the skills of the captain.\n\nFarouk sent the princesses to a Swiss boarding school. Their mother remained in Egypt for a decade after the revolution, before moving to Lebanon and then Switzerland. She eventually returned to Egypt.\n\nIn exile in Rome, Farouk was astonishingly strict with his daughters. They had to seek his permission to cut their hair or varnish their nails. It took Fawzia months to pluck up the courage to ask his consent to study at an interpreters' school in Geneva, and he would allow Ferial to teach at a secretarial school in Lausanne only if she did not reveal who she was.\n\nIn 1966, in London, Ferial married Jean-Pierre Perreten. They had a daughter, Yasmine, who in 2004 married Ali Shaarawi, the grandson of Huda Shaarawi, the pioneering Egyptian feminist and author. For a time Ferial and her husband ran a hotel near Montreux, in Switzerland; but the couple divorced soon after Yasmine's birth, and Perreten died in 1968.\n\nAfter Farida's death in 1988, the sisters filed a lawsuit against the Egyptian government to repossess a royal palace and land in the Nile Delta that they said belonged to their mother. The court ruled against them.\n\nFerial spent much of her time looking after Fawzia, who suffered from multiple sclerosis. After Fawzia's death in 2005, Ferial cared for Fouad, who has suffered from serious depression since his divorce. She did much to hold the clan together.\n\nFerial died in Geneva and was buried alongside her father and sisters in the Khedival mausoleum of the Rifai Mosque in Cairo. She is survived by her daughter.\n\nTelegraph, London"
