        "text": "Farouk I (born Feb. 11, 1920, Cairo, Egypt—died March 18, 1965, Rome, Italy) was the king of Egypt from 1936 to 1952. Although initially quite popular, the internal rivalries of his administration and his alienation of the military—coupled with his increasing excesses and eccentricities—led to his downfall and to the formation of a republic.\n\nFarouk, the son and successor of King Fuʾād I, was educated in Egypt and England before ascending the throne in 1936. As king he continued his father’s rivalry with the popular-based Wafd party, with which he clashed over many issues, including administrative functions, appointments, and even the form used for his coronation.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War II, Farouk tried to maintain neutrality, despite the presence of British troops in Egypt, but in 1942 the British forced him to name as prime minister the Wafd leader Muṣṭafā al-Naḥḥās Pasha. In October 1944 Naḥḥās negotiated the Alexandria Protocol, a step toward the creation the following year of the Arab League, a regional organization of Arab states. Farouk wanted to place himself at the head of this movement, and he dismissed Naḥḥās, who had lost the support of the British."
