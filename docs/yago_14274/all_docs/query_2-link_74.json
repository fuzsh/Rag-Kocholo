        "text": "For a man who reportedly enjoyed shooting lions in Cairo zoo, married a 17-year-old bride in his thirties, and was friends with Charles “Lucky” Luciano – the gangster who founded the modern American mafia – King Farouk of Egypt had almost exactly the taste in interiors you would imagine. Ascending to the throne in 1936 aged just 16, he inherited not only Egypt itself, but the immense wealth his father left him: around $2 billion in modern money, as well as tens of thousands of acres of land along the Nile valley, five palaces, 200 cars and two yachts. Over the course of his reign, he’d come to own more than a thousand bespoke suits. In 1938, Adolf Hitler gave him a Mercedes-Benz as a wedding present.\n\nIt ended about as well as one would expect if any teenager was given a billion dollars and a nation of 16 million people to lead; after 15 years of profligate, corrupt and incompetent rule, Farouk was deposed in the pan-Arab nationalist revolution led by Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1952. He fled to Europe on the royal yacht Mahroussa, transferring onto a pleasure steamer at Naples, and on 29 July he landed in Capri. The New York Times reported the next day that it was believed that the king wouldn’t stay long in Italy, “supported by the fact that only 76 of his 204 trunks were put ashore here.”\n\nNonetheless, Farouk reserved the top floor and roof garden of the Eden Paradise Hotel in Anacapri – some 20 rooms in all – for himself, his family and their entourage. In the end, he never left Italy, moving to Rome, becoming a fixture on the nightclub circuit of the 1950s and 1960s, and eventually dying of a heart attack in his mid-60s, leaving various mistresses behind. “One could pile up perjorative adjectives like sybaritic, avaricious, lustful, greedy to reach a contemptible total,” wrote the New York Times in a scathing obituary. “Farouk ended up in luxurious exile, caring nothing for Egypt or the impoverished Egyptian people.” “He holds the dubious award of having more literature written about his scandalous personal life than his reign,” Dubai-based news outlet Al-Arabiyya wrote about Farouk in 2014.\n\nAnd yet one area in which Farouk has had a lasting legacy is in interior design. He gives his name to a highly distinctive style known as “Louis-Farouk”, a sort of proto-dictator chic characterised by gilding, elaborate carving and 18th-century flourishes. The name is arguably perjorative, given the “Louis” is a nod to Louis XV, the extravagant second-to-last king of France before the revolution, and the famously grand neoclassical fashions that emerged under him and his predecessor Louis XIV, the Sun King. Farouk’s collection was not restricted to actual pieces from the reign of Louis XV – he also owned pieces of art by Antoine Krieger, the prestigious 19th-century French ébéniste or cabinetmaker active through the 1850s. He also bought silver-gilt English tableware from the reign of William IV, and tapestries from the long-established weaving workshops in Aubusson and Gobelin in France.\n\nNotes from a sale of the Egyptian Royal Collection at Christie’s in 2015 explain that “Farouk had a particular appreciation of ornate, heavily-gilded decorative art and the court followed suit. The imperial style became so fashionable among Egypt’s upper classes [during] the King’s reign that it became known as ‘Louis-Farouk.’” Egyptian artisans began to copy the style, making it accessible to middle-class households over the course of Farouk’s reign and beyond, and today, Egypt still has a significant tradition of producing the sort of furniture that wouldn’t look out of place in Versailles. “Enter any middle class Egyptian home,” wrote the Financial Times in 2009, “and you are likely to be received in a ‘salon’ crammed full of gilded, heavily ornate copies of classic French furniture.”"
