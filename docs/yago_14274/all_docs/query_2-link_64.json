        "text": "Farouk I (Arabic: فاروق الأول‎) is the King of Egypt since the state's foundation, including when the Kingdom of Egypt was under British military protection from 1922 until 1943.\n\nFarouk is seen as a very ineffective king, who spends most of his time throwing lavish parties with high society and going on expensive vacations instead of leading his nation. Farouk survived a coup attempt in 1956 by the Free Officers Movement. Farouk is rumored to be planning a massive world tour, and there are doubts that the failing Egyptian economy could afford it. Farouk however cares not for this, and is preparing to go on the adventure of his lifetime."
