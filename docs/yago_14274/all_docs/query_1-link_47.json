The name\n\nFarida which means \"the Flawless One/' was giyen to her\n\nas a love-name. Their early happiness began to fade\n\nwhen the ex-King was weighed down with duties of state\n\nat a critical stage of the war in Egypt 'I\n\nbusiness cards, with a request\n\nto see me.\n\nThey were from an illus-\n\ntrated magazine of world\n\nrepute.\n\nMy secretary went down to\n\ntalk with them and returned\n\nto me looking slightly startled.\n\n\"They wish,\" he said, \"to take photo-\n\ngraphs of Fa rou k and his three daugh-\n\nters saying their prayers. They would\n\nlike the princesses in pyjamas or night-\n\ndresses, and they say not to worry\n\nabout it being morning because they\n\nwill rig up floodlights to make it seem\n\nthe sun is at the proper angle for Mos-\n\nlem prayers, so they don't have to hang\n\naround all day, as they put it.\n\n\"They argue that you should do this\n\nto convince the world that you are a\n\ngood Moslem and family man. They\n\nsay that Neguib has done it with his\n\nthree sons and it has been tremendously\n\ngood publicity for him.\"\n\n\"Please tell them,\" I said, \"that my\n\nonly prayer at the moment is to be left\n\nin peace. I have no other prayer that 1\n\nWish to make to photographers.\"\n\nThe two journalists were apparently\n\nsurprised and genuinely grieved to re-\n\nceive such a refusal. They departed\n\nmoodily after informing my secretary\n\nthat it was certainly no way to get the\n\nnewspapers on my side, and that if I\n\ncouldn't recognise a chance at good\n\npublicity when I saw it, then I had only\n\nmyself to blame and it was no wonder\n\npeople wrote the sort of things they did\n\nabout me.\n\nIf I was wrong to refuse, 1 have re-\n\nsigned myself to the consequences. If\n\nGeneral.Neguib is a good man because\n\nhe says his prayers before cameras,\n\nand I am a bad man because I do not,\n\nthen that'is how the situation must re-\n\nmain, v\n\nMoslem Teaching\n\nWE Moslems say our prayers five\n\ntimes each day. Our religion per-\n\nmits that if we have been busy upon\n\nour lawful duties and offices, we may\n\nsay all our prayers together at the end\n\nof such a day. We all carry our re-\n\nligion very much'more constantly with\n\nus in our daily lives than do most\n\nChristians. We do not drink alcohol\n\nand we do not eat pork. We believe\n\nthere is but one God. We believe there\n\nis a heaven, and with equal firmness\n\nwe believe there is a hell.\n\n. We have different teachings about\n\nmarriage and sex and fidelity in mar-\n\nriage, than has the Western world. We\n\nmay have föur wives at the same time\n\n-but only, says the Prophet, if we can\n\ntreat them all with equal love and do\n\nnot make one wife happy at the ex-\n\npense of any of the others.\n\nThat is usually more than a mortal\n\nman can hope to do, and is the main\n\nreason why I risked the dangers and\n\nscandals of a divorce from my first\n\nWife, instead of being the husband of\n\nboth Farida and Narriman, as our law\n\nand our religion permits, in the same\n\nway that your religion permits you to\n\neat dead pig, and to manufacture\n\nwhisky and gin, and get a little drunk\n\nat-Christmas, perhaps; whereas the\n\nMoslem religion certainly does not al-\n\nlow these things.\n\nWe believe that Jesus Christ, born in\n\nIsrael, was a Prophet of God, just as\n\nyou believe it. We also believe that\n\nMahomet, born in Mecca, was a Pro-\n\nphet of God. And this, the Christian\n\nbelievers will not allow. In the Middle\n\nAges you sent a horde of warriors to\n\npersuade us with axe-blade and sword\n\nthat you were right and we were wrong.\n\nYou failed, for religion cannot be\n\ntaught, at sword-point.\n\nIdeas of Prayer\n\nYET our ideas of prayer are, I think,\n\nvery similar. We believe tnat we\n\nare giving a personal message to God,\n\nand that He can hear us, and that if\n\nwe genuinely repent our sins, we may\n\nhope for pardon.\n\nWhen I am kneeling at my prayers,\n\nif somebody should open the door, I\n\nno longer can feel myself to be in the\n\npresence of God. And I cannot imagine\n\nwhat must be in the minds of General\n\nAT PRAYER: \"General Naguib and his Deputy Premier-that deceitful old crocodile Suliman Hafez-kneel side by side, obedient to some publicity photographer's instructions. Are their thoughts with God or the photographer?\" Help\n\nAT PRAYER: \"General Naguib and his Deputy Premier-that deceitful old crocodile\n\nSuliman Hafez-kneel side by side, obedient to some publicity photographer's\n\ninstructions. Are their thoughts with God or the photographer?\"\n\nNeguib and bis deputy Premier-that\n\ndeceitful old crocodile Suliman Hafez\n\n-when they kneel side by side, obedi-\n\nent to some publicity photographer's\n\ninstructions, and raise their hands and\n\nshut their eyes submissively. Are their\n\nthoughts with God, or with the photo-\n\ngrapher?\n\nAnd when the camera-shutter has\n\nclicked, and the flash-bulb made its\n\ndazzling flash, what does General\n\nNeguib do then, I wonder? Does he in-\n\nstantly forget the photographer for\n\nwhom he has knelt so patiently beam-\n\ning his notorious smile, and plunge at\n\nonce into solemn intimacy with Allah?\n\nOr does he rise and brush the dust from\n\nthe knees of his trousers, and continue\n\nat his desk with his affairs of sending\n\nmonarchist men and women to prison,\n\nand ordering execution squads for\n\nworkmen who \"down tools\" in works\n\nstrikes?\n\nI hear my own little girls* prayers at\n\nnight before they sleep, for I am their\n\nfather and it is my duty to help\" them\n\nfind the way to God. My own father, in\n\nyears long ago, heard my prayers too.\n\nDemands of Decency\n\nJfOW he is dead and I am no longer a\n\nchild, and I say my prayers each\n\nday in privacy. I would not kneel and\n\npray to a press photographer, even if by\n\nso doing I might be miraculously re-\n\nstored to all I have lost.\n\nI may bë no longer a king, but at least\n\nmy children shall not say their prayers\n\nby the light of a publicity flash-bulb ,\n\nThere are some things that one should\n\nbe allowed to keep private, and indeed\n\nthat decency demands should be kept\n\nprivate. I have always felt that the de-\n\ntails of my divorce from my first wife\n\nwas such a matter. T know that she\n\nagrees.\n\nWhen a reporter was sent recently to\n\ntry to speak with her and drag all this\n\npainful memory into the headlines\n\nagain, my ex-wife gave to him the per-\n\nfect and dignified reply.\n\n\"I have no case to state in public,*'\n\nshe said. \"I do not wish to talk about\n\nmyself or my children.\"\n\nI had understood that the law of Eng-\n\nland forbids a newspaper from pub\n\nfishing any details of a divorce except\n\nthe words used by the judge in sum-\n\nming up. All the heart-rending, inti-\n\nmate and sordid details of the husband's\n\ncase and the wife's case, and what they\n\nsaid and did along the path from honey-\n\nmoon to despair, have been forbidden\n\nby the British law to the newspapers to\n\nwallow in.\n\nApparently this rule does not apply\n\nto foreigners, to niggers, to Orientals.\n\nYet if you cut us, do we not Weed?\n\nUnfortunately, this reporter must have\n\nfelt also that the rules of his profession\n\nwhich forbid him to \"pry into private\n\ngrief,\" was yet another law that stops\n\nat the white cliffs of Dover. For he\n\ntook the trouble to seek out the aged,\n\ngarrulous father of my first wife, a re-\n\ntired judge named Yussef Zulficar, who\n\nin his dotage is apparently now ready\n\nto gossip upon intimate family matters\n\nwith any wandering reporter who cares\n\nto rap upon his front door.\n\nAnd Yussef Zulficar, dribbling with\n\nself-pity (and no doubt anxious to in-\n\ngratiate himself with this dangerous\n\nnew regime), made my divorce once\n\nmore into headline news. '\n\nA Free Man\n\nONCE, I would have tightened my\n\nlips and endured it, for my throne\n\nprotected my children then. And even\n\ntoday, I speak with great hesitation and .\n\nafter much soul-searching. It is some-\n\ntimes difficult for me to realise that I\n\nam a free man, these days-that I need\n\nno longer silently take the blame for\n\neverything. Since the day I was born,\n\nit has always been my-opponent's point\n\nof view that has reached the public, and\n\nnever my own.\n\nSo I will speak about the girl I named\n\nFarida, and why we were divorced. 1\n\nwill tell the truth before God, of the\n\nstory that has never been told. And\n\nwhen I have done so, it may perhaps\n\nbe understood that the fault lay, not\n\nwith ourselves, but with our destinies.\n\nI give to Farida this message of com-\n\nfort, that \"God is a gentleman, and He\n\nwill understand.\"\n\nShe was the daughter of a lady-in\n\nwaiting to my mother, and her real\n\nname was Safi-Naz. I met her in Swit\n\n. zerland on my last school holiday. We\n\nwere both sixteen. I was her elder by a\n\nfew precious months. We went on ski\n\nruns together among the Alps, and 1\n\ncan remember the sunlight and snow,\n\nand how good it was to be with her.\n\nEach evening, for as long as we might\n\nstay up, we danced together in the hotel\n\nballroom. Her name Safi-Naz meant\n\n\"Pure Rose,\" and although this was\n\nbeautiful, it was to my mind not per-\n\nfection enough for her. So I called her\n\nFarida, which means \"The Flawless\n\nOne, the Peerless One, the Only One\n\nin the World.\"\n\nAnd it is as Farida that the world still\n\nknows her, by the love-name I gave her\n\nwhen we were children.\n\nIslamic Marriage\n\nfHEN my father died, and my own\n\nyouth ended. I became the King of\n\nEgypt, and married my Farida accord-\n\ning to the Islamic Law, and in a draw-\n\ning-room of Abdine Palace. By the\n\ntraditions of our religion, she waited\n\nin a neighbouring room while, in the.\n\npresence of male witnesses, I took the\"\n\noath of marriage before Farida's father.\n\nwho in those days was filled with a great\n\npride that his daughter should be bride\n\nto the king.\n\nOur marriage oath is this: \"1 accept\n\nher betrothal to myself from thee and\n\nreceive her into my care and pledge\n\nmyself to protect her, and all you here\n\nshall be my witnesses.\"\n\nThat is the Islamic marriage. You\n\nwill see that it is different from the\n\nChristian ceremony. We were both 17,\n\nand the newspapers described us as\n\n\"The handsomest king and queen the\n\nworld has seen for a hundred years.\"\n\nThey were kind to us in those days.\n\nWe loved each other very much, and\n\nalthough it was the green and over-\n\neager love of youth that the years had\n\nnot ripened, I think that we might have\n\nI been happy. But we had a handicap that\n\nf is mercifully given to few to try to con-\n\nquer. I was a king, and she was a queen\n\nof Islam. And whilst I filled every day\n\nwith my new duties, problems and de-\n\ncisions, my wife the queen was by our\n\nlaw forbidden to appear in public ex-\n\ncept on formal State occasions, or\n\nalone.\n\nShe was young, she had glimpsed the\n\nfree ways of the West, and as the long\n\nyears dragged by she must have been\n\nirked, and bored, and lonely.\n\nThere was a man well known in Egypt,\n\nwho belonged indirectly to our family,\n\nthough not of our blood. He was the\n\nson of a princess.\n\nInfatuation\n\nTHIS man was an excellent polo play-\n\ner, and had much spare time, which\n\na King has not. He was old enough to\n\nbe Farida's father, but that is often an\n\nattraction to a young girl, and Farida\n\nbecame infatuated with him.\n\nThe second World War was on, and\n\nRommel's panzer columns were cross-\n\ning the desert towards Cairo. All my\n\nhours were filled by problems, and I\n\nhad little time to fight for the straying\n\naffections of Farida.\n\nHad I but raised my hand, 1 am sure\n\nshe would have come to me. But my\n\nhand was never empty, it seemed, of\n\npen or State seal. Egypt is not easy to\n\nrule. Nine out of ten cannot reao\" nor\n\nwrite, and any rabble-rouser can in-\n\nflame them.\n\nSo when I came wearily from my\n\ncouncil chambers and my arguments\n\nwith men three times my age, to seek\n\nthe solace of her companionship, 1\n\nfound that her thoughts did not belong\n\nto me any more. We had bitter quarrels,\n\nand I would storm out and try to hurt\n\nher by seeking other consolations. The\n\nMoslem law permits a husband to take\n\nconcubines. I was not breaking either\n\nmy vows or niy faith, as she was.\n\nI could have divorced her then, as my\n\nfather divorced his wife, but I did not.\n\nMany beautiful women were eager to\n\nbe my wife, and I went from one to\n\nI another, but none was Farida.\n\nI did not divorce Farida. I loved her\n\nvery much. 1 was the King of Egypt\n\nand she was shaming me daily. And\n\nI knew it, but 1 did not divorce Farida\n\nThe years began to take my youthful-\n\nness away, and yet Farida remained\n\nbeautiful.\n\nGifts\n\nI TRIED to please her with gifts. At\n\none of her birthdays, since she al-\n\nready had jewels, furs, perfumes, 1\n\ngave her a beautiful house. The four\n\nroyal palaces of Egypt are not-nor\n\nhave ever been-the property of the\n\nRoyal Family, but belong to the Egyp-\n\ntian Government, as do the Royal\n\nyachts. A government department fur-\n\nnishes them, and supervises the up-\n\nkeep. The palaces are sumptuous, but\n\nthey are not homes.\n\nI thought it might please Farida, and\n\noccupy her mind, to have a house that\n\nshe could furnish. The house I chose\n\nwas near Koubbeh where our country-\n\nside is most beautiful, green with park-\n\nlands and mysterious with forests.\n\nBut Farida did not even wish to ^see\n\nthe house. \"What good is it to nie?\" she\n\ndemanded. \"It brings me no rents, and\n\n1 am not a servant, to play at keeping\n\nhouse!\"\n\nSo 1 changed the gift. 1 bought for\n\nher a great farming property, with\n\nrents and incomes of £200,000 a year.\n\nShe was content with this, and thanked\n\nme for it, and for a short while we were\n\nreconciled, but her admirer did not\n\nreturn to his own long-suffering wife,\n\nand before our third child was born\n\nFarida had spurned me again, so that\n\nI had to seek my consolation where I\n\ncould. She told me that if I came to\n\nher again as a husband, she would re-\n\nceive me as an intruder.\n\nThose were the strongest grounds for\n\ndivorce that the Law of Islam allows.\n\nIt has been wrongly said of me-so\n\nmany things have been wrongly said\n\nthat I divorced Farida because she\n\ncould not bear me a son.\n\n* Any lawyer of Islam will tell you this\n\ncannot be true. It is not grounds for\n\ndivoçce in Moslem Law. There has\n\nnever been a divorce in Moslem Law\n\nbecause the wife did not produce a son.\n\nAnd unless the law is altered, there\n\nnever will be.\n\nYet we may divorce a wife because\n\nher breath is bad, or because her feet\n\nhave an unpleasant smell, and if a\n\njudge agrees,that this is so, then the\n\nwoman is divorced! I relate this only\n\nto show that our laws give very specific\n\nreasons why a divorce can take place,\n\nbut that the failure to bear a son is not\n\namong those reasons.\n\ni believe with all my heart that if she\n\nhad chosen to continue to bear my\n\nchildren, Farida would have given me\n\na son, and perhaps many sons. In 10\n\nyears of marriage, she should have\n\nallowed me more, than three children.\n\nI finally divorced Farida when, after\n\nfive years of waiting, she had still not\n\nchanged her mind, and still preferred\n\nthe company of her elderly admirer to,\n\nthat of her husband. 1 had my duty to\n\nmy family and our Royal dynasty to\n\nconsider.\n\n\"I Repudiate Thee\"\n\nU_AD 1 chosen to be spiteful, 1 could\n\nhave divorced her by the first\n\nmethod of Islamic Law, in which a few\n\nformalities are undergone, and the hus-\n\nband is then free to marry his wife\n\nagain, and another woman as well, if he\n\ncnooses.\n\nI loved her too much to do this. If\n\nshe had come to me after the divorce\n\nand told me: \"It was a mistake. It\n\nis you whom I love,\" then I would\n\nhave married her again. 1 knew that\n\nI had not the strength to stand against\n\nsuch a temptation, and it was my duty\n\nto the dignities of kingship that I\n\nshould not re-marry a woman I had\n\nrepudiated.\n\nI chose the second method of Islamic\n\ndivorce, which is much more solemn.\n\nInstead of signing papers before judges,\n\nthe husband says to his wife: \"I repu-\n\ndiate thee, I repudiate thee, I repudi-\n\nate thee!\"\n\nThis may not be done without correct\n\ngrounds for divorce, but if those\n\ngrounds are there, and have been\n\nproven, then the thrice-repeated re\n\npudiation, like the death-sentence after\n\na trial by jury, is the final word. And\n\nin our faith, this way of divorce is very\n\nfina! and terrible. It means that the\n\nman has, repudiated his wife before\n\nGod, and that henceforward they are\n\nas strangers who have never loved at\n\nall. She may keep any child until its\n\nseventh year, and must then give it to\n\nthe husband, and our law and our re-\n\nligion allows for no other way than\n\nthis.\n\nA man and woman so divorced may\n\nnot marry each other again, though\n\nHAPPIER DAYS: Just before their second wedding anniversary ex-King Farouk and hil former wile, Farida. posed for this picture with ex-Princess FeriaL Farida wat married when she was 17.

And I was free to find a wife who\n\nwould be my comfort, helpmate, and\n\nthc willing mother of my children.\n\nI did not ask for her jewellery. The\n\nonly stipulation 1 made was that the\n\nfarmland and the incomes from it\n\nshould be put in \"Waqfs\" Trust not\n\nonly to Farida, but to the three child-\n\nren of our marriage, Ferial, Fawzia\n\nand Fadia.\n\n\"Waqfs\" Trust is part of Moslem re-\n\nligion from the days of the Prophet\n\n(though General Naguib is now, I\n\nhear, abolishing it). It means that one\n\nmay inherit land, but may never dis-\n\npose of it, except to one's heirs. It is\n\nto prevent one reckless profligate from\n\nflinging away an entire family estate,\n\nin his own lifetime.\n\nWhat it means to Farida is that she\n\nmust put. aside a share of her rents for\n\nthe children when they grow up, and\n\nthat they in turn must never sell the\n\nland, but give it to their own children.\n\nFarida's way of doing this (and I am\n\nsure it was not her own idea, for she\n\nthinks as a woman and not as a judici-\n\nary officer like her father) was to use\n\nthe children's share to build an ex-\n\npensive house, ostensibly \"'for the use\n\nof the children.\" They have, of course,\n\nnever used this house. And if they do\n\nnot use it, Farida may sell it, and thus\n\ngain the money that should have been\n\ntheirs.\n\n\"Poor Ferial\"\n\nI REPEAT that I do not think this was\n\nFarida's idea. I do not think it\n\nwas Farida's idea that a little note\n\nscribbled by Ferial on behalf of all\n\nthree children, and handed to a guard\n\nat Ras el Tin Palace just before we\n\n' abdicated, should have been printed\n\nand distorted in the newspapers.\n\nThe little letter from Ferial to her\n\nmother was written within two hours\n\nof having been under machine-gun fire,\n\nand finding her pets killed, lt was writ\n\nher, and belongings were being packed\n\nfor exile.\n\nIt was written in French, and said:\n\n\"My very dear mother,\n\n\"It is heartbreaking to have to leave\n\nEgypt and not kiss you goodbye. For-\n\ngive me for my disobedience, but you\n\nknow that my heart has all love for\n\nyou. 4\n\n\"I hope God never again makes me\n\ngo through tHe experience of these past\n\nfew days, at having to say farewell\n\nto so many whom we love, and to so\n\nmany beloved things \"\n\nThe newspaper printed it as having\n\nbeen sent from Capri, and translated it\n\nas: \"I hope to God I never have to go\n\nthrough again the experience of these\n\npast few days\"-as if it were her ex-\n\nperiences in Capri with me that\n\nwere distasteful.\n\nPoor Ferial, she has learnt the very\n\nbitter lesson that the Egypt she loved,\n\nand the grandpapa Yussef who once\n\ntook such trouble to find favour in her\n\neyes, are changed for ever, and that\n\na little girl's heart-broken letter to her\n\nmother may now be used as a weapon\n\nof sensation, venom and hate, against\n\nher father whom she also loves.\n\nSo now when Ferial, Fawzia and little\n\nFadia write letters to their mother (and\n\n1 insist that they do), they are careful,\n\nstilted things, with every word weighed\n\nand considered, as to how it might be\n\nused against us.\n\nLittle girls should not have to endure\n\nsuch a burden.\n\nToday Farida lives alone and for-\n\nlorn. With all my heart, I would put\n\nthe clock back if I could, but the mov-\n\ning finger has written, and our tears\n\ncannot wash the words away.\n\nI have found a new happiness, and I\n\npray to God with all my heart what\n\nmy Flawless One, my Peerless One,\n\nmay one day find the same.\n\nNext Week:\n\nPrudes In The Palace"
