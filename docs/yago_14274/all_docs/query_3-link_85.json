        "text": "Inspired by the country’s history and culture, a new wave of Egyptian clothing is emerging. For decades, designers from all over the world have used ancient Egypt as a reservoir of inspiration. In return, these designers have left their imprint on Egyptian clothing styles. It is this rare blend of Arabic clothing heritage with western cuts that gives Egyptian designers such a unique display on the global stage.\n\nIn this article, I’ll share with you a lot of interesting facts about Egyptian fashion, and: how Egyptians dress in 2021; what not to wear in Egypt; top 20 Egyptian fashion designers right now; and six Egyptian clothing trends of 2021.\n\nWithout further delay,\n\nHow Do Egyptians Dress Nowadays?\n\nAlthough dressing restraint is still expected in rural parts of Egypt, modern Egyptians wear clothing styles that differ only marginally from those in Europe. However, what makes Egyptian clothing different, is the embedded practical side. Because of the country’s hot climate, ancient Egyptians had to wear light fabrics most of the time.\n\nEven now, in 2021, most Egyptian designers make garments from vaporous linen, to confer a unique style while retaining comfort and easiness to wear.\n\nEgyptian Female Clothing\n\nAlthough 90 percent of Egyptians are Muslim, dressing to match one’s religious views is not enforced in Egypt. However, dressing decently is still important to Egyptians, and many women wear Arabic clothing that covers all parts of their bodies.\n\nAlso, while unlike in most western countries where gender boundaries are blurring, Egyptian clothing retains notable differences between male and female’s styles. Women also wear hijabs to cover their necks and heads, or a niqab, usually used to cover just the face and head. And yet, it is not uncommon to see Egyptian women without head coverings.\n\nEgyptian Male Clothing\n\nThere are no religious restrictions on men’s attire in Egypt. For that, younger males wear polo shirts, jeans, and tracksuits. Adult Egyptian men wear western clothing styles, from business suits at work to trousers and short-sleeved shirts for everyday wear.\n\nHowever, older men and certain Muslim devouts refuse western-style clothing and do not wear clothing that clings to the body. Their garment of choice s galabiya, a loose-fitting ankle-length robe, along with a turban, skullcap, or a fez. The kaftan is also worn, an ankle-length coat with large sleeves, either belted around the waist or over the galabiya.\n\nWhat Not To Wear In Egypt\n\nThere are many types of garments that you cannot wear in Egypt, but overall, it depends on gender, as you’ll see below. For example, do not walk the streets of Cairo in your shorts and flip-flops. Or, even worse, don’t ever go to a shopping mall in your swimming outfit, as you’ll be arrested right away.\n\nTop 20 Egyptian Fashion Designers\n\nEgyptian designers are already making waves in international fashion shows and events. Farida Temraz comes to mind, as one of the more famous representatives of Egyptian fashion. Upholding many Egyptian cultural elements, Farida’s evening gowns were described by critics as rare embroidered haute-couture. However, it is not just Temraza carrying the Egyptian fashion flag.\n\nThere is Fufa, Okhtein, and many other Egyptian designers endorsed by international celebrities such as Beyonc�. Here are the best 11 Egyptian fashion designers right now with amazing creations on sale and loved for their stunning designs that put Egypt on the global stage!\n\n1. Farida Temraz\n\nSince the debut of her Autumn/Winter 2014 collection at Paris Fashion Week, Farida Temraz’s label, Temraza, has quickly risen to fame. Her fashion line got the 1st place awarded from Paris Fashion Week & Best Female Couture Designer in New York Fashion Week. In fact, Farida is the only Egyptian designer that has been awarded such outstanding awards for her fashion line.\n\nThe designer captures the hearts of many with opulent Egyptian clothing, touches of gold, and excellent use of drapery. The gowns are a balanced combination of opposites, boasting sleek construction paired with panels. However, the brand also often pays homage to its cultural roots by seeking inspiration from ancient Pharaohs.\n\n2. Kojak Studio\n\nFashion designer Mohanad Kojak’s semi-couture creations exude a contemporary vibe, constructed with the techniques of a couturier. What started as a small passion grew steadily into an empire that Kojak established through his impeccable dressmaking skills.\n\nMohanad’s pieces are a true work of art because they’re not just pretty, each piece tells a story. He also doesn’t care about gender roles, which is a plus, in the current context of gender neutral clothing. The designer became a name in Egyptian fashion 2018, with growing influence in gender-free couture. He also enjoys combining unexpected elements like soft tulle with sturdy gold embellishments for his gowns.\n\nKojak’s designs are structural, often heavily embroidered with sequins, embellishments, and beading — exquisite and full of grandeur. Overall, I love his online store, I personally think it is one of the most polished of all designers on this top 20.\n\n3. Okhtein\n\nOkhtein translates to ‘sisters’ in Arabic, was founded by siblings Aya and Mounaz Abdelraouf. Designed in various embossed leather and crafted in brass, Okhtein bags embody the art of craftsmanship and Egyptian artistry.\n\nWith high-profile buyers such as Beyonc�, Gigi Hadid, and Kris Jenner, Okhtein is becoming the next ‘Made in Egypt’ designer bag.\n\n4. Malak El Ezzawy\n\nMalak El Ezzawy is a world-renown Egyptian designer that has dressed many celebrities. Yet, each Malak El Ezzawy creation is completely different than the other.\n\nMalak’s designs are a true definition of elegance and style and were featured on some of the biggest fashion covers in the region.\n\n5. Fufa\n\nTaking inspiration from her grandmother’s extensive collection of fabrics, Farah El Ashiry launched Fufa, a brand described as Egyptian bohemian. At the time of its establishment, Farah knew little of garments and fabrics; yet her passion kept her going.\n\n“You’ll find that my garments are straightforward. Yet, each print is one of a kind,” said the designer.\n\n6. Norine Farah\n\nBorn and raised in Alexandria, Norine Farah has studied in Milan before falling in love with fashion. Norine gets her inspiration from the beauty of patterns and colours of fabrics, and her creations include custom-embellished gowns and body-hugging looks.\n\nThe designer insists not to make traditional Egyptian clothing, or couture that’s too traditional: “I want to create what I feel is beautiful. Whoever wants to trust my taste does.”\n\nAfter a successful appearance at the Cairo Fashion Festival in 2014, Norine was selected to represent Egypt at the World Fashion Week in Paris. Shortly after, she was nominated as Huawei Egypt’s brand ambassador.\n\n7. Dina Shaker\n\nShaker founded her first fashion brand ‘Spicy’ in 1990, in Alexandria. Inspired by ancient Egyptian clothing, Shaker wants her brand to empower women, as a voice of their strength and independence.\n\nHer collections are always brimming with personality and character, with items varying from dresses to trousers. Nowadays, Dina Shaker‘s beautiful pieces are sold throughout the world, from Cairo to London, and Beirut to Paris.\n\n8. Zahan\n\nEgyptian designer Hana Othman is the mastermind behind Zahan, the brand has taken the Egyptian fashion industry by storm. Hana was the first Egyptian designer to participate at the St. Petersburg Fashion Week in Russia, where she presented an haute couture collection for children.

Murad treats each piece as an entirely separate project, an approach that helps her to create unique pieces for her clients.\n\nSome of Soha’s most acclaimed creations were the dresses made for Injy El Mokaddem and Ola Roshdy.\n\n10. Amina K\n\nFounded by Amina Khalil in 2009, Amina K is a local fashion brand inspired by traditional Egyptian clothing for pharaohs.

Amina K’s collection includes a range of women’s wear, accessories, eyewear, and men’s shirts. The pieces are unique and can be integrated into everyone’s individual style.\n\n11. Zaam Designs\n\nSince the launch of Zaam Designs in 2012, Egyptian designer Ahmed Azzam has been designing leather bags and clutches with a luxe touch and a vintage finish. Every bag is handcrafted in Zaam Designs’ workshop in Cairo to ensure pristine form and quality.\n\nThe brand’s creations are recognised for their angular and sturdy silhouettes. Moreover, each piece is finished in Zaam Designs’ signature adornment of gold-plated brass, detailing a golden peacock logo.\n\n12. Christine Massarany\n\nAll of Massarany’s semi-couture pieces are one-of-a-kind. Uniquely made, you can be sure that whatever piece you choose to wear from the collection, you will be the only one owning it.\n\nChristine Massarany’s debut collection was influenced by nature, earthy tones, and women’s silhouettes, suffocated by a hard and industrial setting.\n\n13. Maison Yeya\n\nA creation of Yasmine Yeya, Maison Yeya is a modern Egyptian fashion brand that has impressed a global audience with its mesmerizing gowns. Yasmine’s creations feature sculpted drapes and polished craft, constructed in luxurious bridal textiles such as duchess satins and silk chiffons.\n\nMaison Yeya gowns are designed to celebrate modern elegant women that are classic as well. Interestingly enough, Yeya has never imagined that one day she’s going to become a celebrated fashion designer. She was making dresses just for fun till it hit her this could be her career.\n\nNowadays, Maison Yeya is on a promising journey on dressing brides around the world.\n\n14. Nour Ibrahim\n\nNour Ibrahim is a rising Egyptian fashion designer exploring original cultural lands in the art of fashion design. Nour’s tailoring expresses sharp edges and unique Egyptian styles inspired by French luxury haute-couture, and with a touch of cultural heritage.\n\nIbrahim’s designs are tapping new lands in the art of Egyptian clothing design. ‘Luxury’ and ‘French, are the two key aesthetics that one can instantly catch in his designs. Overall, Ibrahim’s tailoring expresses sharp edges and cuts, quite unique to the classical Egyptian craftsmanship.\n\n15. Plum Plu\n\nMarketing themselves as premium-luxury, Plum Plu came into the scene with the aim of becoming the trend-setters of the local fashion scene. The designer redefines the concept of feminine clothing by infusing Arabic creativity into each piece.\n\n16. Deana Shabaan\n\nIf you’re a fan of simple designs and effortlessly beautiful gowns, then Deana Shaban is your ‘to-go designer’. Deana picks specific colours and blends them together in a non-traditional way.\n\nThe combination confers the designer with a special style that stands out from a mile. In her view, the designer believes that there’s an individual gown for every woman. Therefore, no piece must be identical or repeated and we love the dresses she designs for Tara Emad.\n\n17. Opio\n\nDesigning clothes for women-on-the-go, Opio aims to make you more fashionable without you having to jump through hoops. With soft fabrics and relaxed fits, all pieces feel effortlessly comfortable. Moreover, Opio’s creations look incredibly chic.\n\n18.

To top it all, her bridal wear is flawless as Onsi’s wedding dresses make that ‘once in a lifetime’ event ever so special.\n\n19. The King’s Mother\n\nFresh off the farm, The King’s Mother is a brand new Egyptian clothing brand, that focuses on making blazers for women. The designer combines elements of men’s and women’s couture to make beautifully cut and perfectly tailored blazers.\n\nSome of the latest pieces include cut outs, fringe, feathers, and even sequins, alongside more traditional elements.\n\n20. Diva Designs\n\nAs international fashion brands started introducing and integrating modest wear or ‘hijab-friendly’ garments over the past years, some local fashion designers launched brands for the same niche. One of these brands is Diva Designs, a hijabi-friendly fashion brand.\n\nFounded by Aya Magdi and Aya Saeed, this Egyptian brand creates clothing inspired by modern cultural trends. Moreover, the brand is not confined to hijab-friendly styles, since most of its pieces can be integrated into everyone’s wardrobe. I love Diva Designs’ collections, in particular for their maxi dresses and kimonos, perfect for the summertime.\n\nTop 6 Egyptian Clothing Trends In 2021\n\nAt the start of the article, I’ve talked about the west influencing Egyptian clothing styles. The following six trends are a perfect example of how these two cultures blend, to create something unique.\n\n1. Hats With Hijabs\n\nAs weird as this might sound, in the heat of the Egyptian sun you’ll need an extra layer of covering, even if you’re already wearing a hijab. One of the daring stylistic experiments this year is wearing a hat with the hijab, demonstrating how to be ‘bold and beautiful’.\n\n2. Satin Skirts\n\nWhile linen has been a key material used by Egyptian designers for millennia, satin is slowly taking over. Sating is excellent in the summer if you want to enjoy the sun but without getting too hot. Skirts in the satin fabric are another favourite trend this year.\n\n3. Mixed Print Patterns\n\nSingle colour outfits have been the standard for hundreds of years in Egyptian fashion. However, over the last 2 years, we’ve seen the demand for colourful outfits growing. This year, Egyptian designers took the trend to another level, by launching printed, colourful patterns.\n\nInterestingly, the printed pattern’s trend is adopted by men as well, not just women.\n\n4. Velvet Abayas\n\nVelvet abayas, in vibrant colours, are back in fashion this year. Also known as the ‘hijab trend-makers’, abayas are hailed as staples of Egyptian fashion. This year, if you’re looking to create that elegant look, go the extra mile and choose a striking colour.\n\n5. Neon Yellow\n\nSpeaking of striking colours, do you know why is yellow and neon colours used in advertising and street signs? To grab attention very fast.\n\nIn 2021 we see the use of yellow and neon colours in Egyptian clothing, as a way to grab attention and stand out. Even more interesting, we see the use of neon colours in Egyptian clothing for men, not just women.\n\n6. Embroidery And Traditional Jewellery\n\nEgyptians have always loved to adorn their bodies with all kinds of elegant pieces of jewellery. Queen Cleopatra remains a perfect example of ancient Egypt’s glamorous fashion style.\n\nAside from her unequalled beauty, history records often mention her obsession with gold ornaments, embellishments, beads, and gemstones.\n\nCleopatra’s image remains one of the most powerful sources of inspiration in the times of modern fashion and haute-couture collections."
