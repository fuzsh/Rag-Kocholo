        "text": "The Royal Jewelry Museum displayed a group of artifacts from the museum’s holdings on their official Facebook page for the public to choose one piece under the slogan “You decide”. The artifact that receives the highest number of comments and likes will be September's winning piece.\n\nThe four pieces are from the collection of brooches displayed in the museum's Hall of Queen Farida.\n\nSafinaz Zulfaqar, better known as Queen Farida, was born on September 5, 1921 in Ganaklis, Alexandria. Her mother is Zainab Mohammad Saeed and her father is Yusef Zulfaqar Pasha. She learned English and French at a school for nuns in Alexandria. She worked as a plastic artist and was encouraged by her uncle, the great artist Mahmoud Saeed.\n\nShe married King Farouk in 1938 in a legendary wedding at the Dome Palace [Kasr el-Qubba], to be the first wife of the King and the Crowned Queen.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Royal Jewelry Museum displays the jewelry of the royal families that ruled Egypt and is located in Alexandria. The palace that houses the museum was built in 1919 in Zizinia and is an architectural masterpiece. It spans over an area of 4185 square meters and features the 19th century European style.\n\nThe palace was converted to the Royal Jewelry Museum in 1986. It exhibits a large collection of jewelry and artifacts that belong to the Alawite royal family, some dating to as far back as 1805, and including rare artifacts from the era extending from the rule of Mohammad Ali Pasha to the rule of King Farouk I.\n\nAll the jewelry was confiscated by the July 23 revolution. The palace was registered as a museum in 1999, and currently houses 11,500 pieces."
