That broke her own record of 57.07 done last week, which in turn crushed her own record of 1:02.15 done at the 2010 Short Course World Championships. She’s been ‘better’ than 1:02 in a hypothetical sense for a while, but hasn’t raced much in short course.\n\nHer splitting was about the same as last week, with just a small improvement on the back-half of the swim making the difference.\n\nComparative Splits:\n\n1st 50 2nd 50 Full Time Old Record Lewisville 26.40 30.67 57.07 New Record Budapest 26.42 30.55 56.97\n\nThe African Record belongs to South African Lize-Mari Retief, who swam 56.52 at the Vladimir Salnikov Cup in 2007."
