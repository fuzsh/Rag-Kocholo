        "text": "Egyptian princess (1943–2002)\n\nPrincess Fadia (Arabic: الأميرة فادية; 15 December 1943 – 28 December 2002) was born at the Abdeen Palace in Cairo. She was the youngest daughter of the late Former King Farouk of Egypt and his first wife, the Queen Farida.[citation needed] After her father was deposed during the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the Princess lived in Italy for two years. She and her sisters were then sent to live in Switzerland, to attend boarding school. There, the Princess studied painting, became an accomplished equestrian and met her future husband.[1]\n\nOn 17 February 1965, Fadia married Pierre Alexievitch Orloff (born 13 December 1938), a geologist and descendant of Orlov family, at the Kensington Registry Office, in London.[1][2][3] He converted to Islam, taking the name Sa'id Orloff.[1] They had two sons, Michel Shamil Orloff (born 2 September 1966) and Alexander-Ali (born 30 July 1969). The Princess worked as a translator for the Swiss Ministry of Tourism, being fluent in French, Arabic, English, Italian and Spanish.[1]\n\nThe Princess was the closest child to her father Farouk of Egypt and her mother Farida of Egypt.\n\nPrincess Fadia of Egypt has 4 grandchildren.\n\nFadia died in Lausanne, Switzerland and was buried in the Al-Rifa'i Mosque in Cairo, Egypt.[4]\n\nAncestors\n\n[edit]"
