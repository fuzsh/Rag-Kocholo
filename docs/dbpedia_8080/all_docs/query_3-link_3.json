Empire\n\nGerman language\n\nGerman (Standard High German: Deutsch) is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family, mainly spoken in Western and Central Europe. It is the most widely spoken and official or co-official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and the Italian province of South Tyrol. It is also an official language of Luxembourg and Belgium, as well as a recognized national language in Namibia. There further exist notable German-speaking communities in France (Alsace), the Czech Republic (North Bohemia), Poland (Upper Silesia), Slovakia (Košice Region, Spiš, and Hauerland), Denmark (North Schleswig), Romania and Hungary (Sopron). It is most closely related to other West Germanic languages, namely Afrikaans, Dutch, English, the Frisian languages, and Scots. It also contains close similarities in vocabulary to some languages in the North Germanic group, such as Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. Modern German gradually developed from the Old High German which in turn developed from Proto-Germanic during the Early Middle Ages. German is the second-most widely spoken Germanic and West Germanic language after English, both as a first and a second language. Today, German is one of the major languages of the world. It is the most spoken native language within the European Union. German is also widely taught as a foreign language, especially in continental Europe (where it is the third most taught foreign language after English and French), and in the United States. The language has been influential in the fields of philosophy, theology, science, and technology. It is the second-most commonly used scientific language and among the most widely used languages on websites. The German-speaking countries are ranked fifth in terms of annual publication of new books, with one-tenth of all books (including e-books) in the world being published in German. German is an inflected language, with four cases for nouns, pronouns, and adjectives (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative); three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) and two numbers (singular, plural). It has strong and weak verbs. The majority of its vocabulary derives from the ancient Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family, while a smaller share is partly derived from Latin and Greek, along with fewer words borrowed from French and Modern English. English, however, is the main source of more recent loan words. German is a pluricentric language; the three standardized variants are German, Austrian, and Swiss Standard German. Standard German is sometimes called High German, which refers to its regional origin. German is also notable for its broad spectrum of dialects, with many varieties existing in Europe and other parts of the world. Some of these non-standard varieties have become recognized and protected by regional or national governments. Since 2004, heads of state of the German-speaking countries have met every year, and the Council for German Orthography has been the main international body regulating German orthography.\n\nSee Cameroon and German language\n\nGerman submarine U-459\n\nGerman submarine U-459 was a Type XIV supply and replenishment U-boat (Milchkuh or 'milk cow') of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II.\n\nSee Cameroon and German submarine U-459\n\nGiant eland\n\nThe giant eland (Taurotragus derbianus), also known as the Lord Derby's eland and greater eland, is an open-forest and savanna antelope.\n\nSee Cameroon and Giant eland\n\nGiraffe\n\nThe giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa.\n\nSee Cameroon and Giraffe\n\nGizzard\n\nThe gizzard, also referred to as the ventriculus, gastric mill, and gigerium, is an organ found in the digestive tract of some animals, including archosaurs (birds and other dinosaurs, crocodiles, alligators, pterosaurs), earthworms, some gastropods, some fish, and some crustaceans.\n\nSee Cameroon and Gizzard\n\nGlobal 200\n\nThe Global 200 is the list of ecoregions identified by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the global conservation organization, as priorities for conservation.\n\nSee Cameroon and Global 200\n\nGnetum\n\nGnetum is a genus of gymnosperms, the sole genus in the family Gnetaceae within the Gnetophyta.\n\nSee Cameroon and Gnetum\n\nGoethe-Institut\n\nThe Goethe-Institut (GI, Goethe Institute) is a non-profit German cultural association operational worldwide with 159 institutes, promoting the study of the German language abroad and encouraging international cultural exchange and relations.\n\nSee Cameroon and Goethe-Institut\n\nGoliath frog\n\nThe goliath frog (Conraua goliath), otherwise known commonly as the giant slippery frog and the goliath bullfrog, is a species of frog in the family Conrauidae.\n\nSee Cameroon and Goliath frog\n\nGoma\n\nGoma (from the Kongo ng'oma or ngoma: ritual drum carved from solid wood, used by the Bantus) is the capital and largest city of the North Kivu Province in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n\nSee Cameroon and Goma\n\nGorilla\n\nGorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa.\n\nSee Cameroon and Gorilla\n\nGoukouni Oueddei\n\nGoukouni Oueddei (كوكوني عويدي; born 1944) is a Chadian politician who served as President of Chad from 1979 to 1982.\n\nSee Cameroon and Goukouni Oueddei\n\nGrameen Bank\n\nGrameen Bank (গ্রামীণ ব্যাংক) is a microfinance specialized community development bank founded in Bangladesh.
