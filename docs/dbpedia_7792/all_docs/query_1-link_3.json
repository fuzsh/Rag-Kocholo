Nestled in the rolling Convals, with breath-taking views of the landscape from every point of the compass, Dufftown offers a range of walks for all levels of fitness and mobility.

If you’re very quiet, you might see the giants that live in this part of the area. If the giants are hiding, you might to discover evidence of their presence at the Giant’s Seat and the Giant’s Cradle. You could also meet a unicorn (which is Scotland’s national animal) on your way to the Fairy Village that lies further along the trail. After all that walking you can sit down and eat your lunch at the Fairy Village and soak in the peace and calm of the area before making your way back. To return to Dufftown you can either walk back the way you came or continue along the path that will return you to Dufftown on a slightly longer, 20-minute loop.\n\nThose looking for a bigger challenge can tackle Ben Rinnes, the highest mountain in Moray and located to the west of the town. A gentle well-trodden path makes it accessible to even the newest hill walkers and the stunning, panoramic views from the top are the perfect reward for your efforts.

The 13-mile, five-hour, one-way trail links Dufftown and Keith and is perfect for families, dog walkers and those who prefer a flatter surface. There is also a hill walk called The Suie which will take you past Glenfiddich lodge, an old historic hunting lodge, giving you a deeper sense of the local heritage and culture that’s seamlessly linked with nature.\n\nFor a quintessential slice of Scottish life, combine your walk with a round of golf at the 18-hole Dufftown Golf Club, with kit available for hire if you didn’t bring your own.\n\nNature enthusiasts, walkers, and adventurers love Dufftown.\n\nFor those looking for a day-trek, the Isla Way has you covered.
