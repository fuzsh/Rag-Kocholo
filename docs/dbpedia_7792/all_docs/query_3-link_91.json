        "text": "Dufftown acheived arguably their best result of the season away to title favourites Inverness City.\n\nAn extremely entertaining encounter ended in a 5-4 victory for the toonsers.\n\nThe Dufftown defence came under some early pressure from the home sides impressive front 3, with ex Nairn County, Fort William and Clach forward Steve Saunderson leading the line and it only took him 5 minutes to find the net and Dufftown found themselves a goal down.\n\nHowever Dufftowns counter attacks were causing the Inverness defence plenty of problems. Dufftown forced a corner which was expertly delivered by Jamie Bagley and Kelvin Main was on hand to slot home from close range to draw level on 14 mins.\n\nDufftown were coming into the game and with the Inverness defence sitting deep in their own half, it appeared that the away side were one good pass from the edge of the Inverness box.\n\nIt was Bagleys delivery again that was met by the head of Martin McMullan and after only 18 mins Dufftown were in front.\n\nHowever only moments later Inverness were on the attack and it appeared that Dufftown's Luke Gordon had fouled the Inverness attacker on the edge of the area, however the referee was unmoved and play continued but the Dufftown defence and goalkeeper seemed to have stopped awaiting the whistle and when the ball was despatched towards goal McIntosh could only parry onto the crossbar and the inverness forward was quickest to react to make the scoreline 2-2.\n\nThe game was being played at a frenetic pace with play ebbing from end to end, and on 30mins Dufftowns Ricky Henderson slotted home after an excellent move involving Luke Gordon and Darren Mitchell.\n\nThe drama didnt end there when Inverness striker Steve Saunderson scored 2 quick fire goals on 36 and 39 mins to complete his hatrick.\n\nThe half ended at 4-3 to the home side.\n\nDufftown started the 2nd half on the front foot and pressed the Inverness rearguard on countless occasions, however the goals were not so easy to come by for either side in this half, and the healthy support had to wait until the 75th minute for the games next goal. And it was Dufftown who won another corner on the right which was met by the head of Kelvin Main to score his second of the match.\n\nDufftown were now on top and the all important winner came on 82mins!\n\nKelvin Main had possession 30 yards from goal, 16 year old substitute Scott Campbell made an 80 yard lung bursting run to overlap Main, who's pass was perfectly weighted for Campbell to take a touch before smashing a left footed shot into the top right corner of the net from the left side of the 18 yard box.\n\nThe goal sparked jubilant scenes from the Dufftown players, however with 8 minutes left there was still a job to do.\n\nThe goal rattled Inverness and they began to lose shape and discipline, particularly on 88mins when the Inverness full back was sent off for a stamp on Dufftowns James Grant.\n\nDufftown saw out the game and recorded a fantastic 5-4 victory which will hopefully become a platform for the young side as the manner of the victory was as pleasing as the result."
