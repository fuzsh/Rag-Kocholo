        "text": "Mortlach Distillery Spotlight\n\nMortlach distillery was the first legal distillery in Dufftown, located in the Speyside region. Now, it’s known as “The Beast of Dufftown” due to its bold, weighted flavour profile in a region generally known for gentler whiskies. The distillery prides itself with its unique 2.81 distillation process, which is used exclusively at Mortlach. Until recently, a cask of Mortlach’s single malt whisky was almost impossible to come by. Most of what Mortlach distilled was reserved for the renowned Johnnie Walker blends. Now, independent bottlings of Mortlach are highly desired among whisky enthusiasts because of the distillery’s growing popularity in the single malt whisky scene."
