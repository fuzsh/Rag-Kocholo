        "text": "Three celebrated distilleries, Dufftown, Glendullan and Glen Ord, that rose in the late 19th century, are united today by a single vision – to create great tasting Single Malts that are exceptionally balanced, easy to drink and deliciously enjoyable from the very first sip. Founded in the 19th century, Dufftown is located at the heart of the Speyside region of Scotch whisky production. In our early years, the water from Jock’s Well, an artesian spring upstream, had been diverted to rivals at night a number of times. We are proud to still use this pure water today. Constructed in 1897, Glendullan distillery sits on the bank of the River Dullen amongst the picturesque Convall Hills. Glendullan’s onion-shaped stills produce a delicate spirit with a green apple profile. One of the oldest distilleries in Scotland, Glen Ord is steeped in history. Founded on the Black Isle in the Scottish Highlands, it sits on a stretch of land that had been in the possession of Clan Mackenzie for nearly 700 years, when Thomas Mackenzie built the distillery in 1838. It is from this famous Scottish clan that the distillery adopts its motto, “Luceo non uro”, meaning “I shine not burn”. The Singleton continues to be inspired by this today, with its emphasis on slow batched distillation. The Singleton whiskies are generally described as smooth and fruity, as a result of the casks used and a very gentle distillation process. A combination of European oak ex-Sherry casks and American oak ex-Bourbon casks gives the whisky a perfectly balanced, smooth profile."
