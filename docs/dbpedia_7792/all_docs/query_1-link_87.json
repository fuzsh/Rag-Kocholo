        "text": "Description\n\nAbout the Distillery\n\nThe Dufftown Distillery is located in the heart of Speyside, a region in Scotland renowned for producing some of the world’s finest single malt whiskies. Founded in 1896 by three whisky entrepreneurs, the distillery has a long history of producing quality spirits. It is one of the largest whisky producers in Scotland and is known for its commitment to traditional distillation methods.\n\nHow this product is made\n\nThe production of The Singleton of Dufftown 12-Year-Old follows the standard single malt Scotch whisky-making process. It begins with the selection of high-quality barley, which is malted, milled, and mixed with hot water to create a sugary liquid called “wort.” The wort is then fermented with yeast to convert the sugars into alcohol, resulting in a liquid called “wash.”\n\nThe wash is distilled twice in traditional copper pot stills. The first distillation separates the alcohol from the wash, creating a liquid known as “low wines.” The low wines are distilled again in the spirit stills to produce a high-proof spirit, known as “new make.”\n\nThe new make is then transferred to oak casks, typically American oak and/or European oak barrels, for aging. The whisky spends a minimum of 12 years maturing in the casks, during which time it gains complexity and character from interaction with the wood.”\n\nTechnical Details\n\nAppearance: The Singleton of Dufftown 12-Year-Old has a golden amber color, typical of many well-aged single malt whiskies.\n\nNose: The aroma is inviting, with notes of ripe orchard fruits, honey, and a hint of vanilla.\n\nPalate: On the palate, the whisky offers a smooth and well-rounded taste, with flavors of apples, pears, and gentle malt sweetness. There are also subtle undertones of oak and spices.\n\nFinish: The finish is warm and lingering, with a pleasant balance of fruitiness and soft spice."
