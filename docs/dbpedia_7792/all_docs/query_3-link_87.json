I've been rather tied to home the last couple of years but I spent a lot of time looking previously. I put up a feeder fairly close to home a couple of days ago in an area that I thought could be a possible spot for them... not where they have been seen before but pretty close and at least where I can check on a regular basis.\n\nTS\n\nHad a wander down to 'emerging site' Rigifa Pool this morning to see if there were any waders there. And in fact there were, five in fact: three Snipe, a Greenshank and a Ruff. So 'of interest' and worth a look if you're in the area. The water level is quite high at the moment and there's not much mud, so if it dries out over the next few weeks then it could improve.\n\nI think that there has been a fair bit of effort spent on trying to find breeding cresties in those parts of Aberdeenshire closest to Moray, but without any luck as far as I am aware.\n\nI recall we tried a Crested Tit Survey covering the likely-looking woodland areas in that area back in the mid-90s. If I remember rightly, Bin forest at Huntly was one of my sites. I managed Goshawk but not Cresty.\n\nI recall we tried a Crested Tit Survey covering the likely-looking woodland areas in that area back in the mid-90s. If I remember rightly, Bin forest at Huntly was one of my sites. I managed Goshawk but not Cresty.\n\nI've just had a quick look through the report of that survey in the 1996 NES Bird Report - an interesting example of how to write a report on a survey that found absolutely nothing! Most of the woods surveyed at that time were actually in Moray (Bin forest being the main exception) and included Whiteash/Ordiequish woods between Fochabers and Keith, where despite them not showing up in the 1996 survey, they were found in 6 contiguous tetrads in the 2002-06 atlas.\n\nHad a nice day out with Alan Knox today. We started the day with a sea-watch at Battery Park in Peterhead between 11 and 12. It was the most productive sea-watch I've had so far this year, with 4 Sooty Shearwaters going north being the highlight. A supporting cast of 15 Manxies, 1O Bonxies, 6 Arctic Skua and 2 Velvet Scoter also made it worthwile. Meanwhile at Strathbeg there was a Spotted Redshank, 9 Ruff and a Red Kite, a very nice little selection of birds. The Ythan, Cairnbulg and Kinnard Head were also visited, but not much of note were at the latter two places. The Ythan held a couple of nice ospreys, one coming close to us, and a Ruff.\n\nJoseph\n\nAlright Everyone,\n\nWill be travelling up to Fair Isle next Thursday/Friday and will have several hours on the way there and back to do a bit of birdwatching around Aberdeen, anyone care to recommend any good sites within an easy distance of the train station/airport?\n\nHave never been to Scotland before! So only a vague idea of what to expect and have never seen any of the Scottish specialities, okay so I know that I'm not gonna see Golden Eagle, Ptarmigan and Crested Tit within either walking or public transport of the city centre but I'd settle for a Hooded Crow are they doable from the city?\n\nAlso a long shot I know but anyone know if Blackdog is accessible on public transport from Aberdeen and how long it would take to get there and back?\n\nProbably most of the stuff that I could get I will probably get in Shetland but thought I'd ask just in case. PM's appreciated\n\nThanks in advance\n\nQuite a bit of info about Blackdog on this recent thread:\n\nhttp://www.birdforum.net/showthread.php?t=176760\n\nIt's easy to do by public transport - get a bus to Peterhead and ask to be dropped at Blackdog. Some buses to Peterhead go via Newburgh which is good for the Ythan Estuary.\n\nYou could always go round Girdle Ness too, just as a taster of all those rarities you'll be seeing in Fair Isle .\n\nI recall we tried a Crested Tit Survey covering the likely-looking woodland areas in that area back in the mid-90s. If I remember rightly, Bin forest at Huntly was one of my sites. I managed Goshawk but not Cresty.\n\nRemember that survey. Saw b*gger all at all sites we looked at, and Sue was menaced by a dobermann which planted its front paws on her chest ... (the back paws would have been an interesting trick!)\n\nRob\n\nHad my best ever view of a short-eared owl this evening just outside Strachan near Banchory. It flew onto a roadside fencepost ahead of me and stayed put as I stopped alongside. It was only about a metre from the passenger side window and looked at me for a good minute or so before a car came up behind and I had to move on. Lovely - just a shame I didn't have a camera with me.\n\nHad my best ever view of a short-eared owl this evening just outside Strachan near Banchory.

Waders were a bit of a disappointment with almost no small waders anywhere. A scattering of Greenshank were at both the Ythan and Strathbeg. Several Ruff and a Black-tailed Godwit were at the latter. Also good views of Osprey and Peregrine at various places. The highlight was three drake Surf Scoters at Blackdog.\n\nI spent most of Saturday along the Aberdeenshire coast with Jo and Tom with rather limited success on the whole.

It was indeed rather unproductive on a whole, but the Surf Scoters were an absolute delight and made it very worthwile, a great reward for us. It was a pleasure to have a day out with you. :t:\n\nAnd with the review, comes the photos from the day - nothing spectacular, mostly of commoner birds but nice to photograph and see nonetheless.\n\nJoseph\n\nAttachments\n\nIMG_8902 - Copy.JPG\n\nIMG_8940 - Copy.JPG\n\nIMG_8953 - Copy.JPG\n\nIMG_8955 - Copy.JPG\n\nIMG_8959 - Copy.JPG\n\nWent down to Cove Bay again today. The community woodland was a bit disappointing for migrants with just a Spotted Flycatcher and a Willow Warbler to show for lots of pishing. For some reason the birds there go batsh*t mental for a bit of pishing. Unfortunately none of them were rare birds.\n\nThe Wood Sandpiper is still at Rigifa Pool. It was accompanied by two Ruff, six Dunlin and two Snipe."
