        "text": "In our third and final blog post in our series of distilleries you can visit by train in Scotland, author Harry takes a look at the capital of the Highlands – Inverness – and which whisky distilleries are accessible by rail from Inverness train station.\n\nTravelling from Inverness\n\nInverness is an ideal base for exploring the Highlands of Scotland. The city is compact, yet has plenty of hotels, restaurants and other conveniences. Inverness also serves as a hub for rail travel in the Highlands, allowing passengers to reach all four corners of Scotland without a car. The city itself is scenic, and situated only a few miles from Loch Ness. Unlike Edinburgh or Glasgow, Inverness only has one train station: no chance for confusion when catching your train!\n\nGlen Ord\n\nRegion: Highland\n\nTrain Station: Muir of Ord\n\nTime from Inverness: 20 minutes\n\nThe Dalmore Distillery (Credit: Whyte & Mackay)\n\nThe Dalmore distillery is only 10 minutes’ walk from Alness train station, in the small town of the same name north of Inverness. The town is a convenient pit-stop for travellers heading north, and The Dalmore’s location along the shores of the Cromarty Firth makes it all the more worthwhile to visit. Under an hour from Inverness, Dalmore is easy to get to, and Alness nicely balances rural isolation with the conveniences of a town. The Dalmore produces a rich, historic Highland malt with many age- and no-age-statement whiskies available. (At the time of writing, the distillery is currently closed – please check the website for details of when you wish to visit).\n\nStrathisla\n\nRegion: Speyside\n\nTrain Station: Keith\n\nTime from Inverness: 1 hour 5 minutes\n\nStrathisla distillery is the oldest in Speyside, and home to the Chivas Regal blend. The town of Keith lies right in the heart of Speyside, and walking to the distillery from Keith train station is a breeze. If you visit in the summer, tourist trains to Dufftown also run from Keith train station. Strathisla aims to impress with an aesthetically pleasing layout and classic distillery features like pagoda-shaped rooftops (or ‘Doig Ventilators’). Chivas The Blend and The Chivas Cellar tasting are available (for £30 and £40 respectively and the Discover the Distillery Reserve Collection for £50.\n\nGlenmorangie\n\nRegion: Highland\n\nTrain Station: Tain\n\nTime from Inverness: 1 hour 20 minutes\n\nWith references to the ‘Sixteen Men of Tain’, Glenmorangie’s whisky remains connected to the nearby town of Tain. The town, situated on the edge of the Dornoch Firth, is connected to Inverness by train. Glenmorangie is well known for its delicate style of single malt, produced using some of Scotland’s tallest copper pot stills. An enormous range of finishes allow fans of this distillery to explore many different flavours: Sherry, Port, rye whiskey, Sauternes, Madeira and more. The distillery offers three main tours: Original, Signet and Heritage.\n\nClynelish\n\nRegion: Highland\n\nTrain Station: Brora\n\nTime from Inverness: 2 hour 20 minutes\n\nClynelish Distillery (credit and copyright: Diageo)\n\nFurther north along the Scottish coast lies Clynelish, a historic Highland single malt distillery. The whisky made here isn’t supposed to surprise you – it’s a reliable single malt, with rich layers of citrus, maritime breeze and waxy texture. Walking here from the town of Brora, you’ll find yourself in what feels like increasingly remote countryside very quickly. Book the Clynelish Express Tasting for £12.50 or the Clynelish Flavour Journey at £17.50.\n\nWolfburn\n\nRegion: Highland\n\nTrain Station: Thurso\n\nTime from Inverness: 3 hour 50 minutes\n\nNow Scotland’s most northerly mainland distillery (Highland Park still holds the overall trophy), Wolfburn is also one of Scotland’s newest malt distilleries. Located near the town of Thurso, this distillery is also on the doorstep of John O’Groats, famously Britain’s most northerly town. Ferries leave from Scrabster (only a few miles away) for the Orkneys. This distillery has one straightforward distillery tour, at the rate of £15 per person. However, they only take place once a day, Monday to Friday, and it is advised to call in advance. If you’re planning on making the trip north to Britain’s northernmost edge, then Wolfburn lets you see a whisky distillery firsthand at the same time.\n\nOld Pulteney\n\nRegion: Highland\n\nTrain Station: Wick\n\nTime from Inverness: 4 hours 20 minutes\n\nOld Pulteney Distillery (credit: Old Pulteney)\n\nOld Pulteney may not be quite as far north as Wolfburn, but it remains a remote corner of Scotland’s northern coast. This distillery, and the surrounding town of Wick, thus take a long time to get to, but a visit is worth the effort. Wick has a rich history, intertwined with the distillery named for the town’s founder, Sir William Pulteney. The whisky made here is ideal for fans of maritime, highland single malts, and the distillery produces a host of limited edition expressions as well. Nothing too complicated with the tours at Old Pulteney – they are currently offering a tasting masterclass – The Maritime Malt Masterclass at £20 per person.\n\nA reminder of Harry’s rules when choosing a selection of distilleries you can visit by train:\n\nOnly distilleries with train stations can be considered. Sounds pretty obvious, but Ardmore, Tomatin and many other distilleries sit alongside railway lines. If you see these on a map, don’t be fooled – there are no train stations nearby, so you would struggle to get off and visit the distillery!\n\nAnywhere more than 30 minutes’ walk from a station is out. You probably don’t have all day to visit one distillery, and a long hike may be impractical for visitors with additional access requirements.\n\nNo changes onto buses and ferries, again to keep things simple.\n\nEvery distillery listed here has a visitor centre! You can’t take this for granted: some distilleries, while accessible by train, are not open to the public.\n\nAdditional Info\n\nAll train times shown here are based on info from the National Rail Journey Planner. Prices will vary based on age of travellers, any railcards, and how far in advance tickets are purchased. Scotrail rover tickets, such as the Highland Rover (with four days unlimited travel over eight consecutive days for £95), could allow you to visit many of these distilleries with one ticket!\n\n“Silent season” – many whisky distilleries will close down during mid-summer or winter for what is known as silent season. During silent season the stills won’t run and the distillery may be closed to visitors while general maintenance is carried out and the team take a well-earned break. Make sure you’re not disappointed by checking with the distillery you are planning to visit to find out when their silent season will fall.\n\nFind Harry’s first blog post listing distilleries you can visit from Edinburgh by train, and Part 2, on distilleries to visit near Glasgow.\n\nCheck out Harry’s interactive map online showing all the railway lines and distilleries listed in this series."
