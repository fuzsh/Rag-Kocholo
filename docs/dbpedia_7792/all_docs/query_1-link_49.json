Summer colours local fields barley-gold. All year round spring water bubbles in the glen. As alive as that day in 1886 when our founder William laid the first stones that built one of the oldest family-owned Scotch whisky distilleries. Join us at Glenfiddich, in the Valley of the Deer.\n\nTime matters when whisky making. So, while touring the distillery, you’ll visit our original warehouse where you will explore the generations of gently maturing casks. You’ll also learn how we achieve depth and consistency of flavour throughout our range of exceptional whiskies. Then, a tasting of several single malts awaits.\n\nPlease be aware that the tour route has multiple sets of steep stairs.\n\nIf you have mobility requirements, please email Glenfiddich.bookings@wgrant.com and we will do our best to accommodate you on a flat tour route accessing the Mash House, Still House (weather permitting) and Warehouse. Unfortunately the Tun Room (fermentation) is inaccessible.\n\nTours will be available 7 days a week\n\nfrom 9.30 with the last tour departing at 2.45PM\n\nBOOK TOUR\n\nVISIT THE DISTILLERY\n\nThe Distillery Gift Shop is open 7 days a week 10.30 am – 5pm.\n\nDistillery FAQs\n\nSKILFULLY CRAFTED.
