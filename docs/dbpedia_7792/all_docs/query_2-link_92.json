        "text": "Speyside and the Water of Life…\n\nThe milder climate of Speyside makes for perfect barley growing weather; couple it with fresh water from the River Spey and you have the makings of some of the world’s finest whiskies. The Malt Whisky Trail takes you on a journey of discovery from illicit secret distilleries hidden away in heather-clad mountains to the industrial revolution to the global brands of today. The closest distillery to us is Cardhu, makers of Johnnie Walker. The Macallan Distillery, with its award-winning visitor centre, is less than seven miles away.\n\nThe Malt Whisky Trail from Visit Scotland\n\nCardhu\n\nGlenmoray\n\nGlengrant\n\nThe Macallan\n\nSpeyside Cooperage\n\nAberlour\n\nStrathisla\n\nGlenfiddich\n\nBallindalloch Single Malt Distillery\n\nThe Glenlivet\n\nIf you are planning a distillery tour, consider leaving the driving to the professionals:\n\nAce tours\n\nCraigellachie Cars\n\nCoppercairn\n\nFishing on fast rivers and lakes...\n\nThe River Spey attracts fishermen from all over the world for its rich bounty of salmon and trout. Many estates have fishing beats along its banks but there are also smaller angling clubs selling river tickets for the day. You can go it alone or with a ghillie if you want to find out where the catch is plentiful.\n\nLochs and lakes also offer peaceful angling opportunities, mostly for trout. Go out into the loch on a small boat or sit at the water’s edge, it’s entirely up to you. Fishing equipment can usually be hired if you don’t want to bring your own.\n\nFor the more adventurous, why not charter a boat and sail out on the Moray Firth. There are many more species of fish to catch such as cod, pollock, halibut, ling, mackerel, skate, eel and shark. This is also an excellent way to view the incredible coastline.\n\nFurther Information\n\nKnockando Estate\n\nSpey Fishery Board\n\nAtlantic Salmon Trust\n\nFish Pal\n\nAlba Game Fishing\n\nSpeycaster.net\n\nGlen Rothes Trout Fishery\n\nRiver Avon Fishing Association\n\nFochabers Angling Association\n\nTrout and Salmon Fishing Scotland\n\nA proud golfing tradition...\n\nBeing the national game of Scotland, it is no wonder we have so many golf courses everywhere. Ranging from world-class courses like Nairn, Royal Dornoch and Castle Stuart with its breathtaking views to inland clubs like Grantown-on-Spey. Whether in the mood for mountain and moor or sea and salty air, there’s a course for you in the Highlands.\n\nRothes Golf Club\n\nWith panoramic views of the Spey Valley and the friendly village of Rothes, this 9-hole inland course has lush tree-lined fairways. For all abilities.\n\nGrantown-on-Spey Golf Club\n\nExpect leafy parkland and striking mountain views on this excellent 18-hole course situated in the Cairngorms. A traditional clubhouse serves good food and drink in a friendly atmosphere.\n\nForres Golf Club\n\nLocated 6 miles from Findhorn Bay, this 18-hole course has spectacular views and welcomes golfers of all ages abilities. Home to the David Torrence Golf Academy, Forres are especially focused on encouraging young people to take up the sport.\n\nMoray Golf Club\n\nOne of the finest links in Scotland. Follow Old Tom Morris on the wild gorse-lined old course or Henry Cotton on the challenging new one. You can enjoy incredible views of Lossiemouth as you play.\n\nNairn Golf Club\n\nOverlooking the Moray Firth, this championship course, provides the more experienced golfer with a challenge. There’s also the 9-hole Cameron Course for players of all abilities. The scenery is breathtaking, whatever your skill level.\n\nCastle Stuart Golf Club\n\nBeautiful views across the Moray Firth, sitting on the coast at Rosemarkie Bay, Castle Stuart is a stunning course. Gorse-lined fairways, Art Deco-style clubhouse house, a restaurant, bar and pro golf shop all make for a great day of golfing.\n\nRoyal Dornoch Golf Club\n\nRoyal Dornoch’s natural links are perfect for those requiring a greater challenge. A wide stretch of white sandy beach separates the course from the Dornoch Firth, with views of the bay and the wild Atlantic Sea. The Struie, Dornoch’s second course, is less challenging. Both make for an brilliant day’s game.\n\nFor information on other Highland courses, visit Golf Highland\n\nJust stretching your legs or shredding up mountains…\n\nThe Speyside Way is one of Scotland’s four official Long Distance Routes, connecting Spey Bay on the Moray Coast to Newtonmore on the western edge of the Cairngorm Mountains. With diverse scenery, from ocean views of the Bay or across moors and woodland and on to the mountains as the trail passes the Cairngorms, it’s a feast for the eye. There are superb routes for walkers and cyclists of all ages and abilities whether you want to feel the burn or just stretch your legs.\n\nThe Moray Monster Trail offers single-track mountain bike routes around the Fochabers area. Ranging from family-friendly - ‘The Soup Dragon’ - to the more challenging - ‘The Fochabers Ring’ - there are plenty to choose from to make for a perfect day in the saddle. ‘The Gully Monster’ is not for the faint-hearted, though!\n\nWalks in Moray and Nairnshire\n\nWalks in the Cairngorms\n\nMountainbiking in the Cairngorms"
