        "text": "About the Aberdeenshire, Scotland, Police Records 1818-1948\n\nGeneral collection information\n\nThis collection captures 130 years' worth of records kept by the police in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Formed in 1818, the Aberdeen City Police documented criminal activity in the city through detailed registers and crime statistics. The collection includes the following:\n\nWanted Posters\n\nRegisters for Detention, Offenders, and Complaints\n\nAnnual reports on crime statistics in the area.\n\nCity Police Register of Returned Convicts, 1869-1939\n\nThe Register of Returned Convicts includes physical descriptions and even photographs of the convicts. The Detention and Offender registers include crimes committed by youths.\n\nThe Aberdeen City Police not only kept documentation on its criminals, but also on its own employees and legal proceedings in Aberdeen. This collection also has police employment records and papers that showcase daily life within Aberdeenshireâ€”from complaint registers to public accident statistics to sheep dipping.\n\nUsing this collection\n\nThe types of records within this collection vary, but they can provide the following details about convicts or police personnel in Aberdeenshire:\n\nName\n\nAlias(es)\n\nAge\n\nBirth date and place\n\nDeath date and place\n\nConviction date [for convict]\n\nDischarge date [for convict]\n\nEmployment details\n\nRank [for police officers]\n\nResidence\n\nNames of parents\n\nName of spouse\n\nIf you have an ancestor in Aberdeen who wasn't a policeman or a criminal, this collection can still be helpful. The police also documented legal disputes and proceedings that your ancestor may have taken part in. These records can include your ancestor's name, residence, and even a description of their property.\n\nCollection in context\n\nThe Aberdeen City Police was founded by the Aberdeen Police Act in 1818. Before then, the city only had a Police Commissioner who didn't have the resources to enforce the law. The police force started out with Day and Night Patrols, which merged into one organisation in 1840. The police force was a new concept in 19th century Scotland, and their duties focused on road maintenance, street lighting, and sewage as well as apprehending criminals.\n\nBurghs and counties in Scotland created their own salaried police forces that were empowered to gather statistics and new methods in crime detection. The evolution of the Aberdeen City Police can be seen through the records in this collection.\n\nBibliography\n\nAberdeen City Council. Police Records.
