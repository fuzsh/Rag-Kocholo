        "text": "Not to be confused with Drummore.\n\nHuman settlement in Scotland\n\nDrummuir (Scottish Gaelic: Druim Iubhair) is a small village in Scotland, in the traditional county of Banffshire, and in the Moray council area. It is between Dufftown (five miles), Keith (seven/eight miles) and Huntly (nine miles).\n\nIts old name was Botriphnie (Gaelic: Both Draighnigh), and this is the name still sometimes used for the parish. Drummuir comes from Druim Iubhair, Scottish Gaelic for \"Yew Ridge\"; the name Botriphnie, may come from Pictish origins and be a \"Pit-\" name, meaning \"Thorn Farm\".\n\nDrummuir's biggest building is \"Drummuir Castle\", a Strawberry Hill-type Gothic Victorian building, with extensive gardens. The castle was built by the Gordon-Duffs who are still the main landowners in the area.\n\nThe Keith and Dufftown Railway runs by the village from a defunct distillery. It is rarely used now, but is still in good condition. A train is regularly run by the Keith and Dufftown railway association. Drummuir railway station once served the castle, local farms and dwellings whilst Drummuir Curlers' Platform was a private station once used by curlers on Loch Park.\n\nThe River Isla which flows down to Keith through Strathisla, and Davidston Burn (or Davieburn), a small tributary of the Isla are the two main rivers in the area. Ben Rinnes is clearly visible to the west, and makes a strong visual impression."
