        "meta_description": "Sir James Cantlie, physician and medical administrator, was born on 17 January 1851 at Keithmore Farm, Dufftown, Banffshire, Scotland, the eldest son of William and Janet Cantlie. His early education took place at a local school in the village of Drummuir and at Milne's Institution at Fochabers, Speyside. He graduated from the University of Aberdeen in 1871 with an MA in natural science before training in medicine at the same institution and graduating MB and CM with honourable distinction in 1873. Cantlie was appointed instructor of anatomy at Charing Cross Hospital, London, in the same year. He became an instructor in the St John Ambulance Association and in 1882 he joined the London Scottish Volunteers as a surgeon.
