        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Moray\" probably derives from Celtic mori, sea, and treb, settlement. In the 11th century, this was a huge tract of territory, between lowland Alba to the south and Viking Sutherland and the islands to the north. Its ruler or \"Mormaer\" was MacBheatha mac Fhionnlaigh, whom we call Macbeth. But was a Mormaer an independent king or a vassal noble? Duncan of Alba reckoned Macbeth was subservient, and marched north in 1040 to prove his argument; Macbeth's forces overcame and killed him, so Macbeth became king of a unified Scotland. According to Shakespeare he benefited from witchcraft, but it was all quite legal and constitutional, as hacking your opponents to bits was sort of a medieval Electoral College. His reign was secure enough for him to make a pilgrimage to Rome, but in 1057 he was slain in battle in a similarly legal and constitutional way, and Malcolm III got to be king.\n\nLater centuries whittled down Moray to a small county centred on Elgin, and so it remains. (In 1975 it was absorbed into Grampian Region, but re-emerged as a county in 1996.) Its coast is on the same latitude as Newfoundland but has a much milder climate, and its industries have been agriculture, stone quarrying and fishing - this last has virtually gone. North Sea oil and gas were never a major industry here. What Moray is now best known for is whisky tourism, with a chain of distilleries lining the Spey Valley.\n\nLocal information\n\n[edit]\n\nMoray County Council website\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nFor Forres and Elgin the usual approach by air, rail or road is via Inverness. For the southern towns such as Keith, Aberdeen may be a more convenient way in.\n\nTrains run every couple of hours from Aberdeen via Dyce, Inverurie, Huntly and Keith to Elgin and Forres, continuing to Nairn and Inverness.\n\nThe main road through the county is A96. Stagecoach Bus 10 follows it, running hourly from Inverness to Forres, Elgin and Aberdeen."
