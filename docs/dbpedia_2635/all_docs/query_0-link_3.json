        "text": "Group of Malay people\n\nEthnic group\n\nPerakian Malay people refers to a group of Malay people originating from the Malaysian state of Perak. As of 2010, it is estimated that the population of the Perakian Malays in Perak are about 55.74% of the state's population.[1]\n\nLanguage\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Perak Malay\n\nPerakian Malays uses a distinct form of Malay variant known as Perak Malay. Linguistically, there are about five Malay dialects traditionally spoken in Perak, only one of which is intended by the name \"Perak Malay\" and it can be divided into two sub-dialects namely Perak Tengah sub-dialect and Kuala Kangsar sub-dialect. Other Malay dialects used in Perak include Perak Selatan dialect which is more influenced by Selangor Malay and Perak Ulu Malay dialect (also known as Basa Ulu or Basa Grik) but are not considered as part of Perak Malay as they do not share many similarities with Perak Malay but instead it is linguistically much closer to neighbouring Kelantan-Pattani Malay and other East Coast Malay varieties such as Terengganu Malay and Pahang Malay. Malaysian language is used as a second language and English as a third language.\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nDance\n\n[edit]\n\nTraditional Perakian Malay dance are such as:-[2]\n\nDabus\n\nBubu Menari\n\nLenggok\n\nZapin Gambus\n\nBelotah\n\nSewang\n\nCuisine\n\n[edit]\n\nIkan Pindang Daun Seniar[3]\n\nSambal Serai[4]\n\nGulai Kemahang[5]\n\nKerabu Umbut Bayas[6]\n\nKulat Sisir[7]\n\nPenjan Ubi[8]\n\nMartial arts\n\n[edit]\n\nSilat Serimau Hitam\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nAbdullah Muhammad Shah II of Perak, the 26th Sultan of Perak and resistor of colonial British Malaya.[9]\n\nAhmad Zahid Hamidi, Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nAmy Mastura, Malaysian singer and actress.\n\nAwie, Malaysian singer and actor.\n\nFauziah Latiff, Malaysian actress.\n\nJamal Abdillah, Malaysian singer and actor.\n\nJins Shamsuddin, Malaysian actor and film director.\n\nMamat Khalid, Malaysian film director.\n\nMohammad Nizar Jamaluddin, politician and former Menteri Besar of Perak.\n\nMohd Nasir Basharuddin, Malaysian footballer.\n\nNgah Ibrahim, Orang Kaya Mantri of Larut in 1858.[10]\n\nMohammad Nor Khalid, a Malaysian cartoonist famously known as Lat\n\nNazirul Naim Che Hashim, Malaysian footballer.\n\nNurridzuan Abu Hassan, Malaysian footballer.\n\nSyazwan Roslan, Malaysian footballer.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
