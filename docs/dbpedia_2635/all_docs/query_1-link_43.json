Table of Contents Forewords Former Minister of Health Director General of Health Deputy Director General of Health Organizing Chairpersons Organizing and Scientific Committees Conference Programme Day 1: 18th August 2021, Wednesday Day 2: 19th August 2021, Thursday Day 3: 20th August 2021, Friday Abstract List Sponsors 1 1 2 3 4 5 9 9 13 17 20 39\n\n3. Foreword Former Minister of Health The Former Ministry of Health (MOH) prioritizes “Health for All”, and one way is by investing in clinical research that matters to the Malaysian people. Therefore, it is a privilege to be with clinicians to celebrate excellence in clinical research. Malaysia strives for the conduct and translation of high-quality research by broadening human capital that is supported by a growing yet stable research ecosystem. Notably, the annual National Conference for Clinical Research (NCCR) serves as a gateway for researchers and clinicians worldwide to collaborate and share new ideas. I am therefore pleased that despite the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic, this year, the 14th NCCR will be held virtually to support researchers to present their findings. The 14th NCCR 2021 features the theme “Niche to Norm”. In our COVID-19 time, we have witnessed the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines, novel diagnostics, enhanced digital solutions, and adaptive clinical trials; all designed to help us recover from the pandemic. On that account, by highlighting these niche areas, the NCCR 2021 aspires to keep Malaysia abreast with the current progress in the global research scene. We look forward for this NCCR to enhance these niche areas. On behalf of Former Ministry of Health, I would like to extend my appreciation and thanks to the Institute for Clinical Research, the Organizing Committee, the invited speakers, and to all those who contributed towards the success of this conference. With that, I wish you all a great conference. YB Dato’ Sri Dr. Adham Baba Former Minister of Health, Malaysia 1\n\n4. Foreword Director General of Health I am delighted to be part of this year’s 14th National Conference for Clinical Research (NCCR) themed, “Niche to Norm”. This year's conference will address a triad of niche areas in medicine such as precision medicine, clinical research, and digital health. The update of the advances in these fields will sow the seed of reshaping and equipping the nation towards a sustainable future of health and healthcare. The exponential growth in the global development of precision medicine in recent years is exhilarating, hence the 14th NCCR's focus on the niche is timely to provide the platform for us a glimpse through the future of healthcare. It is an exciting niche that will advance the sustainability of the healthcare system by maximizing the healthcare technologies in preserving the health of the nation. Therefore, the Malaysian healthcare industry will need to consider the myriads of issues such as the principle of ethics and legality, the cost and the value-added role, as well as the process of embedding data into workable action that has a meaningful impact on society. Recently, Malaysia has attested to the world that we possess the quality in the clinical research that leads to the revolution of Hepatitis C's treatment and diagnosis. This historic clinical research breakthrough will reduce the overall cost and the duration of treatment of Hepatitis C desperately needed in the Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). In addition, the introduction of a rapid diagnostic kit will project Malaysia onto the right path in the road of eliminating Hepatitis C by 2030 by tackling the disease at the point of care. This achievement should aspire the medical fraternity into the culture of clinical research in enhancing the nation's health. With the continuous battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has adopted digital approaches in healthcare to ensure effective and efficient service delivery. The acceptance of the MySejahtera solution in the public health strategies particularly in the digital contact tracing, vaccination program, and recently, home quarantine order as well as the normalization of outpatient clinical teleconsultations to reduce the risks of COVID-19 are propelling Malaysia towards achieving high digital adaptation in healthcare. We can seize the digital opportunities presented by the COVID-19 crisis to rethink and innovate our ways of delivering value-based healthcare for better patient outcomes. I trust the conference will offer delegates the opportunity to exchange research ideas and share knowledge that can greatly benefit Malaysia as a leading destination for clinical research. On that note, I congratulate the Institute for Clinical Research and the Organizing Committee for gathering promising Malaysian researchers and renowned international speakers to the 14th NCCR. I wish you all an enjoyable conference. Tan Sri Dato' Seri Dr. Noor Hisham bin Abdullah Director General of Health, Malaysia 2\n\n5. Datuk Dr. Hishamshah bin Mohd Ibrahim Deputy Director General of Health, Malaysia (Research and Technical Support) Foreword Deputy Director General of Health The 14th National Conference for Clinical Research (NCCR) follows an annual tradition organized by the Institute for Clinical Research (ICR) NIH. This year, the NCCR spotlights the theme “Niche to Norm” which features precision medicine, clinical trials, and digital health. Through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) the Ministry of Health Malaysia propels research ranging from clinical, biomedical, public health, health management, to health systems. As we chart individualized disease treatments with precision medicine, there is a need to advance digitalization in healthcare for both patient empowerment and facilitate clinical trials. With these special fields of interest in place, the NIH research ecosystem can keep pace with global research development, funding and support. I look forward to the NCCR fostering professional development across diverse disciplines, widening research collaborations and developing new research in biomedical engineering. By working together, we can generate higher value and outcomes for policy and practice. I would like to congratulate the Institute for Clinical Research and the Organizing Committee of 14th NCCR for their excellent scientific program. I also wish that the NCCR continues to galvanize the next generation of clinical researchers in Malaysia. 3\n\n6. Foreword Organizing Chairpersons The National Conference for Clinical Research (NCCR) is built on a strong heritage of clinical research dating back to our first NCCR in 2007. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, we have strived to bring virtual experiences that match the conventional way of conferencing. Revolving around the theme “Niche to Norm,” the 14th NCCR 2021 features keynotes and plenaries in precision medicine, clinical trial, and digital health. Precision medicine is taking a foothold in patient management, especially in Malaysia with a diverse population such as ours. Additionally, the richness of existing biobanks in Malaysia can be a catalyst in furthering precision medicine research in the Southeast Asia region. By leveraging on strong collaborative efforts between researchers and clinicians from multiple disciplines, we are able to conduct clinical trials at a rate comparable with that of pre-pandemic years. The pandemic also provides unique research opportunities. For instance, in the field of digital health, the Institute for Clinical Research is undertaking research incorporating remote sensing biosensors and Artificial Intelligence for monitoring COVID-19 patients in quarantine. It delights us that NCCR 2021 is continuing the tradition of the Dr. Wu Lien-Teh “Young Investigator Awards” to showcase and celebrate the efforts of our researchers. The Scientific Committee has worked hard to bring together internationally renowned speakers for plenary and symposiums, exhibitions and e-posters presentations from 179 accepted abstracts. We also would like to extend our utmost gratitude to all participants and sponsors for their invaluable support. On behalf of the Institute for Clinical Research and Clinical Research Malaysia, we are honored to welcome you to the 14th NCCR 2021. May you have an excellent and enjoyable conference.
