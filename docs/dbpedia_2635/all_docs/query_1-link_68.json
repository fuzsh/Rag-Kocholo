        "text": "Despite the growing importance of the concept of circular economy, the case of developing countries remains under-explored. Against this backdrop, the present research aims to examine the association between the constructs of total quality management (TQM) and organizational sustainability (OS) with the mediating effect of knowledge management (KM) from the perspective of a circular economy. The data were collected from the manufacturing sector of a developing economy (n = 510) to serve the purpose of the current research through a self-administered questionnaire (paper-pencil technique). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed for hypothesis testing of the current survey. Six TQM dimensions were drawn from the Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award (MBNQA) model. OS is composed of economic, social, and environmental sustainability, and KM is composed of four dimensions including acquisition, creation, sharing, and application of knowledge. The empirical examination sugges...\n\nThis study purposively is to conduct an empirical analysis of the structural relations among critical factors of quality management practices (QMPs), world-class company practice (WCC), operational excellence practice (OE), and company performance (company non-financial performance or CNFP and company financial performance or CFP) in the oil and gas companies operating in Indonesia. The current study additionally examines the relationships between QMPs and CFP through WCC, OE, and CNFP (as partial mediators) simultaneously. The study uses data from a survey of 140 strategic business units (SBUs) within 49 oil and gas contractor companies in Indonesia. The findings suggest that all six QMPs have positive and significant indirect relationships on CFP through WCC and CNFP. Only four of six QMPs have positive and significant indirect relationships on CFP through OE and CNFP. Hence, WCC, OE, and CNFP play as partial mediators between QMPs and CFP. CNFP has a significant influence on C...\n\nThis paper tried to review the most recent articles published in the field of TQM and highlight the latest themes being researched in the chosen area, and also make way for future researchers to identify the potential research areas requiring attention. Four latest research areas from TQM literature were identified, namely: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Corporate Green Performance (CGP), Entrepreneurial Leadership (EL), and knowledge sharing. Based on the identified areas, a causal loop was developed using System Dynamics methodology to establish a relationship between the variables and to see how they fit in the TQM philosophy. The final dependent variable was organisational performance, and an attempt was made to demonstrate how the variables identified from the latest literature fit in between the TQM practices and organisational performance.\n\nThe implementation of TQM in manufacturing industries is linked with its key factors which are responsible for achieving effective results. The purpose of this study is to identify key factors of TQM implementation and impacts. This study identifies nine key factors of TQM implementation and four factors of TQM impact from the extent literature which can help industry to achieve business excellence. The nine TQM implementation key factors are Top management commitment & involvement, Policy deployment, process control and improvement, Research and development, training and education, maintaining suppliers&#39; empowerment and relationship, customer relationship, employee empowerment and involvement, evaluation and assessment whereas key TQM impact factors were excellence and performance in Customer satisfaction, Employee satisfaction, Product quality and Product performance.\n\nPurpose – The study aims to examine the connection between practices of total quality management (TQM) and sustainability in Malaysia food and beverages companies (FBC). Continuous process improvement, benchmarking, management leadership, human resources management, quality assurance, service design and information and analysis as TQM practices are considered and their relationship, respectively, with sustainable performance. Design/methodology/approach – A survey questionnaire is administered to gather responses from 303 FBC, while 98 responses are useable and subsequently analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Findings – The results reveal that effective implementation of continuous process improvement, benchmarking, quality assurance, service design and information and analysis have positive and significant effect on sustainability. Research limitations/implications – The scope of the present study was limited to FBC in Malaysia, and a cross-sectional design was employed to examine the hypothesized relationships at a single point in time. Practical implications – The proposed and developed model of this study can be employed by policy and decision makers in the industry. This model can be considered by practitioners in the industry to implement critical policies in the future. Originality/value – The premises of the institutional and contingency theory are supported by re-affirming the importance of contingencies and institutions for any successful strategic practices to enhance sustainable performance by implementing TQM."
