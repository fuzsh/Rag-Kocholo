The main objective was to gain insights into the dynamics of mental health and coping, considering different pandemic features at different assessment waves. The final sample consisted of N = 243 adults from the Austrian general population. Data were collected at four timepoints (between June 2020 and December 2021) via LimeSurvey, an open-source online survey tool. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), adjustment disorder (AD), anxiety, and depression were assessed using validated instruments: Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5), AD-New Module 8 (ADNM-8), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ4). We also administered the Pandemic Coping Scale (PCS) to address pandemic-related coping behaviors. Cochran’s Q test and repeated measures ANOVAs were applied to assess changes over time. The results indicated that prevalence rates of AD (χ2(2) = 16.88, p = 0.001), depression (χ2(3) = 18.69, p < 0.001), and anxiety (χ2(3) = 19.10, p < 0.001) significantly changed across four assessment waves. Changes in mean scores of the assessed mental health outcomes were also observed. For pandemic-related coping, we found differences in the subscales: healthy lifestyle: F(3, 651) = 5.11, prevention adherence: F(2.73, 592.35) = 21.88, and joyful activities: F(3, 651) = 5.03. Taken together, our study showed a higher mental health burden in wintertime than in summertime, indicating an increased need for psychosocial support in times of stricter measures, higher incidences, and higher death rates. Furthermore, the observed decrease in adaptive coping behaviors suggests that easy-to-implement coping strategies should be actively promoted in order to maintain mental health during and in the aftermath of pandemics.

The aim of this study is to examine the regional trends and socioeconomic predictors of adolescent pregnancy in Nigeria. This study used pooled data from the 2008, 2013 and 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). A total of 22,761 women aged 15–19 years were selected across the three surveys. Multilevel logistic regression analysis that adjusted for cluster and survey weights was used to identify predictors of adolescent pregnancy in Nigeria, across the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Adolescent pregnancy remained constant between 2008 (22.9%; 95% CI = 22.14, 24.66), and 2013 (22.5%; 95% CI = 20.58, 24.50), but a significant decline was reported in 2018 (18.7%; 95% CI = 17.12, 20.46). Trends show a decrease in adolescent pregnancy across all six geopolitical zones, except for the South-East zone which reported a slight increase (0.6%). Multivariable analysis revealed that the main socioeconomic predictors across all six geopolitical zones were: poor households, increasing age, and low education. Exposure to media (watching television and reading newspapers) was reported as predictor in all regions except the North-East geopolitical zone, while all northern zones reported high levels of adolescent pregnancy in male-led households. To address adolescent pregnancy in Nigeria, there is need to promote girls’ education especially among poor households, and for the dissemination of reproductive health messages to adolescents through various forms of mass media campaign, as well as the adoption of social marketing interventions to improve sexual and reproductive health literacy.

In this study, in-depth interviews were conducted, and grounded theory applied to open coding, main axis coding, and selective coding to form concepts and categories. Trajectory equifinality modeling clarified the evolution logic of digital transformation. Based on the theory of service ecology, a digital health service aging model was constructed from the “macro–medium–micro” stages and includes governance, service, and technology transformation paths. The macro stage relies on organizational elements to promote the institutionalization of management and guide the transformation of governance for value realization, including the construction of three categories: mechanism, indemnification, and decision-making. The meso stage relies on service elements to promote service design and realize service transformation that is suitable for aging design, including the construction of three categories: organization, resources, and processes. The micro stage relies on technical elements to practice experiencing humanization, including the construction of three categories: target, methods, and evaluation. These results deepen the understanding of the main behaviors and roles of macro-organizational, meso-service, and micro-technical elements in digital transformation practice and have positive significance for health administrative agencies to implement action strategies.

Traditional street tree decision-making approaches are inadequate for addressing the scale, environmental complexity, and mutability of decisions involved in urban renewal projects—new tree selection approaches that consider complex competing criteria for tree selections addressing stormwater management systems, visual assessment and solar amenity are needed. This paper describes a new method of multi-criteria street design decision modelling that combines outputs from hydrology modelling, digital procedural tree modelling and urban form analysis, with animation and gaming technologies. We evaluate our approach through application to the design of a large-scale, urban renewal project underway in Melbourne, Australia. The results of the study demonstrate the functionality of our model, which allowed the simultaneous output of streetscape visualisation, with tree selection responding to integrated stormwater management infrastructure and flooding, along with the likely overshadowing conditions of urban renewal built-form. Our multi-criteria approach makes a significant contribution to the tools available to urban designers, planners and landscape architects in their pursuit of smarter streetscape design decisions that respond to complex spatial, cultural and climatic urban challenges.

However, it can also encourage forms of discrimination and xenophobia. In Chile, migration is a theme of great relevance due to a substantial increase in the flow of migrants over the last ten years, as well as the acts of extreme violence toward this group. Thus, this research analyzes how mass media coverage of migrants influences Chileans’ perception of migrants. Adopting an experimental design, we implemented a large-scale, representative online survey with citizens over 18 years of age (N = 2227) and an experiment with combined access to positive and negative news about migrants in different news outlets. The regression analysis showed differences between citizens regarding the type of daily relationships they are willing to maintain with the migrant population. Furthermore, exposure to news about migration was the primary variable that explains why people consider this phenomenon one of the main problems affecting the country, confirming the agenda-setting theory. The experiment also indicated a causal relationship between the exposure to negative content and negative judgment about this group and their presence in the country.

It is considered to have great potential to promote health in the forms of art, architecture, landscape, space, and environment. However, there are insufficient design approaches to address the challenges during the HTD process. An increased number of studies have shown that emerging information modeling (IM) such as building information modeling (BIM), landscape information modeling (LIM), and city information modeling (CIM) coupled with blockchain (BC) functionalities have the potential to enhance designers’ HTD by considering important design elements, namely design variables, design knowledge, and design decision. It can also address challenges during the design process, such as design changes, conflicts in design requirements, the lack of design evaluation tools and frameworks, and incomplete design information. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a conceptual BC enhanced IM for HTD (BC-HTD) framework that addresses the challenges in the HTD and promotes health and well-being. The structure of BC-HTD framework is twofold: (1) a conceptual high-level framework comprising three levels: user; system; and information, (2) a conceptual low-level framework of detailed content at the system level, which has been constructed using a mixed quantitative and qualitative method of literature analysis, and validated via a pre-interview questionnaire survey and follow-up interviews with industry experts and academics. This paper analyzes the process of BC enhanced HTD and the knowledge management of HTD to aid design decisions in managing design information. This paper is the first attempt to apply the advantages of BC enabled IM to enhance the HTD process. The results of this study can foster and propel new research pathways and knowledge on the value of design in the form of non-fungible token (NFT) based on the extended advantages of BC in the field of design, which can fully mobilize the healing and therapeutic behaviors of designers and the advantage potential of HTD to promote health, and realize the vision of Health Metaverse in the context of sustainable development.

The complex model is a comprehensive evaluation system that considers various influencing factors, the investor’s intentions regarding the need and financing of projects, as well as expert opinion on the possibility of achieving sustainability and health of regions and cities by implementing this project with the investor. The model is based on modern theory of intellectual knowledge analysis, fuzzy set theory, and systems approach. Furthermore, we have an initial quantitative assessment and the linguistic significance of the level of the project financing decision with a reliability assessment. The knowledge from the repository of 896 project plans in the field of transport submitted for implementation and financing in the period 2021–2027 was used for the creation of the model. The results of the study were tested on the examples of evaluation of five real projects and demonstrated the applied value of the methodology for evaluating the level of decision-making feasibility of project financing in uncertainty and the importance of making correct management decisions based on expert opinions.

However, with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth solutions have emerged as a key component in patient healthcare delivery and they have been widely used in emergency medicine ever since. The pandemic has led to a growth in the number of telehealth applications and improved quality of already available telemedicine solutions. The implementation of telemedicine, especially in emergency departments (EDs), has helped to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect healthcare workers. This narrative review focuses on the most important innovative solutions in emergency care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. It outlines main categories of active telehealth use in daily practice of dealing with COVID-19 patients currently, and in the future. Furthermore, it discusses benefits as well as limitations of telemedicine.

However, FO water treatment technology is limited by factors such as concentration polarization, membrane fouling, and reverse solute flux. Therefore, it is of a great importance to prepare an efficient high-density porous membrane and to select an appropriate draw solute to reduce concentration polarization, membrane fouling, and reverse solute flux. This review aims to present a thorough evaluation of the advancement of different draw solutes and membranes with their effects on FO performance. NaCl is still widely used in a large number of studies, and several general draw solutes, such as organic-based and inorganic-based, are selected based on their osmotic pressure and water solubility. The selection criteria for reusable solutes, such as heat-recovered gaseous draw, magnetic field-recovered MNPs, and electrically or thermally-responsive hydrogel are primarily based on their industrial efficiency and energy requirements. CA membranes are resistant to chlorine degradation and are hydrophilic, while TFC/TFN exhibit a high inhibition of bio-adhesion and hydrolysis. AQPs are emerging membranes, due to proteins with complete retention capacity. Moreover, the development of the hybrid system combining FO with other energy or water treatment technologies is crucial to the sustainability of FO.

(2) Methods: This was an online survey involved 471 students attending the University of L′Aquila from June to July 2021. The primary goal was estimating the e-learning satisfaction as measured by the E-learning Satisfaction Scale, while the secondary outcomes were studying its relationship with demographic factors, the perception of quality of life, sociality, stress, and coping strategies using a hierarchical regression model. (3) Results: A total of 136 participants were males (29%); the mean age was 25 years. The results revealed that the satisfaction score was 30.6, and the mean stress level was 19.4. Students suffered psychologically and physically for 14 days a month. The sociality score was 36. With respect to coping strategies, students reported higher scores for “Acceptance” (6.0), “Active coping” (6.2), and “Planning” (6.4). E-learning satisfaction was significantly related to age and course attendance. It was positively associated with the social presence score and coping strategies such as self-blame and religion, while it was inversely related to stress and unhealthy days. (4) Conclusions: The students revealed a positive propensity to use e-learning despite the end of quarantine. Sociality, stress, quality of life, and coping seemed to play an important role in student′s e-learning satisfaction.

The aim of this study was to determine what data could be extracted from hospital records in a single site that reflected a child’s journey from admission with suspected abuse to the decisions regarding substantiation made by the multidisciplinary child protection team. A retrospective study of the case records of 452 children referred to a major UK children’s tertiary centre for suspected child maltreatment was undertaken. Child maltreatment was substantiated in 65% of referred cases, with the majority of referrals coming from children living in the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country. Domestic violence and abuse and the child’s previous involvement with statutory bodies were associated with case substantiation. Physical abuse predominated, with soft tissue injuries, including dog bites and burns, most frequent. Burns were related almost exclusively to supervisory neglect. There were also cases of medical neglect. Emotional abuse was associated with exposure to domestic violence and abuse and to self-harm. The strengths and limitations for single-centre data systems were explored, concluding with a recommendation to establish an agreed national and international minimum data set to protect children from maltreatment.

Randomized controlled studies assessing exercise effects on sarcopenia were searched in Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, EBSCOhost, Scopus, EMBASE, and VIP and CNKI up to 31 March 2022. Data were expressed as weighted/standardized mean difference (MD/SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). I2 index was employed for heterogeneity. The initial search identified 5379 studies, and 23 studies involving 1252 participants met the inclusion criteria for further analysis. Results revealed that exercise interventions can significantly improve grip strength (MD = 2.38, 95%CI = 1.33–3.43), knee extension strength (SMD = 0.50, 95%CI = 0.36–0.64), muscle mass of lower extremities (MD = 0.28, 95%CI = 0.01–0.56), walking speed (SMD = 0.88, 95%CI = 0.49–1.27), and functional mobility (MD = −1.77, 95%CI = −2.11–−1.42) among older adults with sarcopenia. No significant exercise effects were found on fat-free muscle mass, appendicular muscle mass, skeletal muscle mass, and muscle mass of the upper extremities. The results of subgroup analysis indicated that both resistance training and multicomponent exercise could significantly increase the muscle strength, while aerobic exercise did not. The findings suggest that exercise intervention can effectively improve muscle function and physical performance in older adults with sarcopenia, but has limited effects on the muscle mass of the upper extremities. In addition, it is highly recommended to apply group-based and supervised resistance training and multicomponent exercise in the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia among the older population.

Overall, 57,743 propensity score-matched metformin users and nonusers were identified from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database between 1 January 2000, and 31 December 2017. We used the Cox proportional hazards model with robust standard error estimates to compare the risks of asthma onset, exacerbation, and hospitalization for asthma in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Compared with metformin nonuse, the aHRs (95% CI) for metformin use in asthma development, exacerbation, and hospitalization for asthma were 1.13 (1.06–1.2), 1.62 (1.35–1.95), and 1.5 (1.22–1.85), respectively. The cumulative incidences of asthma development, exacerbation, and hospitalization for asthma were significantly higher in metformin users than nonusers (p < 0.001). A longer cumulative duration of metformin use for more than 728 days was associated with significantly higher risks of outcomes than metformin nonuse. Our study demonstrated that metformin users showed significantly higher risks of asthma development, exacerbation, and hospitalization for asthma than metformin nonusers. Moreover, metformin use for more than 728 days was associated with higher risks of outcomes. A randomized control study is warranted to verify our results.

We comprehensively characterized the spatiotemporal patterns of non-grain production (NGP) areas in China and elucidated the underlying factors driving NGP. Our objectives were to map NGP on cultivated land (NGPCL) in China, and to quantify its spatiotemporal patterns, to investigate the factors underlying NGP spatial differentiation, and to provide a scientific basis for developing NGP management policies and reference points for protecting cultivated land in other countries. We mapped NGPCL in China from 2000 to 2018 using remote sensing and geographic information system data. The spatiotemporal evolution of the NGP rate (NGPR) was also investigated. The dominant factors driving NGP progression and associated interactions were identified using geographic detectors. From 2000 to 2018, the NGPR gradually decreased from 63.02% to 52.82%. NGPR was high in the west and low in the east, and its spatial differentiation and clustering patterns were statistically significant. Precipitation, temperature, altitude, and soil carbon content were the dominant factors affecting the spatial differentiation in NGPR. The interaction between these factors enhanced the spatial differentiation.

Therefore, this study primarily aimed to evaluate the effects of a blended learning program on knowledge, attitudes, intention to cope with cyber sexual harassment, behavioral coping strategies, and cyber sexual harassment among female high-school students in Bangkok, Thailand. A quasi-experimental study with a two-group design was conducted from May 2021 to October 2021. A total of 112 students were recruited into either an intervention (n = 56) or a control (n = 56) group. The intervention group participated in a blended learning program for 12 weeks. A self-administered questionnaire was completed by both groups at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up. Chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for data analysis. The mean score of the intervention group in knowledge, attitude, intention to cope with cyber sexual harassment, behavioral coping strategies, and cyber sexual harassment after completing the program and follow-up were significantly different from baseline and the control group (p < 0.05). A positive effect of the blended learning program was observed among female students. Therefore, this program can be useful for victims, supporting their self-confidence with decreased frequency of cyber sexual harassment experiences.

The role of informal caregivers has been associated with increased levels of stress, poor physical/mental health and impaired HRQOL. The present study assessed the impact on HRQOL and perceived burden of long-term informal caregiving, as well as the inter-relationships of individuals affected by different RD in six European countries, taking advantage of the data provided by the BURQOL-RD project (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and UK). Correlation analysis was used to explore the relation between caregiver HRQOL and caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview). Multinomial logistic regression models were used to explore the role of explanatory variables on each domain of caregivers HRQOL measured by EQ-5D. Caregivers’ HRQOL is inversely correlated with burden of caring. Mobility dimension of EQ-5D was significantly associated with patients age, time devoted to care by secondary caregivers, patient gender and patient utility index. Patients’ age, burden scores and patient utility index significantly predict the capacity of caregivers to perform activities of daily living. Employed caregivers are less likely of reporting ‘slight problems’ in pain/discomfort dimensions than unemployed caregivers. The EQ-5D instrument is sensitive to measure differences in HRQOL between caregivers with different levels of burden of care.

People who smoke are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and experiencing more severe symptoms of the illness. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between cigarette smoking and MD before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether it was influenced by COVID-19-related stress in the MASH cohort. Methods: An ambispective design was used with data collected during the pandemic (July/August 2020) by the COVID-19-Related Worry Scale, a parameter for stress, and data collected at the participants’ last cohort visit before the pandemic (December 2019). Results: In our sample of 314 participants, 58.6% were living with HIV, 39.2% had MD, 52.5% smoked before, and 47.8% smoked during the pandemic. Participants with MD were twice as likely to smoke cigarettes both before (aOR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.21–3.37, p = 0.007) and during the pandemic (aOR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.24–3.56, p = 0.006); and experienced higher levels of stress measured by the COVID-19-Related Worry Scale (8.59 [5.0–10.0] vs. 7.65 [5.0–10.0]; p = 0.026) compared to those without MD. Participants with MD and high levels of stress smoked more days per month (20.1 [0–30] days) than those with lower levels of stress (9.2 [0–30] days, p = 0.021), and more than those with high levels of stress, but no MD (2.6 [0–30] days, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Cigarette smoking decreased in the MASH cohort during the pandemic, but increased in participants with MD and higher levels of stress.

The most important method of preventing hypertension is social awareness of its causes. An important role in educating society about hypertension is played by medical personnel. The study involved 327 students of medicine representing all years of study. The study used a proprietary questionnaire containing test questions about knowledge of the causes of hypertension (classical and non-classical factors), as well as questionable and false risk factors for the disease. The students’ knowledge of the complications of hypertension was also assessed. Most of the students rated their knowledge about hypertension as good. Classical risk factors for hypertension were identified by students in all years of study: I–III and IV–VI. Non-classical risk factors for hypertension were less often identified by the students. The students almost unanimously indicated that the complications of hypertension include heart failure, heart attack, stroke, aortic aneurysm, kidney failure, atherosclerosis, eye diseases and worse prognosis in COVID-19. Students’ knowledge of the causes of hypertension increased during medical studies. The knowledge of the respondents about classical risk factors for hypertension was extensive, whereas knowledge of non-classical risk factors it was insufficient. Most of the respondents were well aware of the complications of hypertension. Some students identified some factors incorrectly as increasing the risk of hypertension. Emphasis should be placed on the dissemination of knowledge about non-classical hypertension risk factors to medical students.

The lack of licenced professionals is a problem that keeps emerging and is carefully studied on a global level. Strategic objectives aimed at stimulating employment, improving working conditions, and keeping the nurses on board greatly depends on identifying factors that contribute to their turnover. The aim of this study was to present a conceptual model based on predictors of nurses’ turnover intention. Methods: A quantitative, non-experimental research design was used. A total of 308 registered nurses (RNs) took part in the study. The Multidimensional Work Motivation Scale (MWMS) and Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index (PES-NWI) were used. Results: The conceptual model, based on the binary regression models, relies on two direct significant predictors and four indirect significant predictors of turnover intention. The direct predictors are job satisfaction (OR = 0.23) and absenteeism (OR = 2.5). Indirect predictors that affect turnover intention via job satisfaction are: amotivation (OR = 0.59), identified regulation (OR = 0.54), intrinsic motivation (OR = 1.67), and nurse manager ability, leadership and support of nurses (OR = 1.51). Conclusions: The results of the study indicate strategic issues that need to be addressed to retain the nursing workforce. There is a need to ensure positive perceptions and support from managers, maintain intrinsic motivation, and promote even higher levels of motivation to achieve satisfactory levels of job satisfaction.

This research investigated barriers and facilitators to concussion recovery and RTW, and resource gaps reported by adults with concussion (‘workers’) and workplace and healthcare professionals (‘workplaces’). Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with workers (n = 31) and workplaces (n = 16) across British Columbia. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Facilitators to workers’ concussion recovery and RTW included treatment, social support, and workplace and lifestyle modifications. To address barriers, both groups recommended: (a) widespread concussion and RTW education and training (b) standardized concussion recovery guidelines; (c) changing attitudes toward concussion; (d) mental health supports; and (e) increasing awareness that every concussion is unique. Findings can inform best practice for concussion recovery and RTW among professionals in workplaces, healthcare, occupational health and safety, and workers’ compensation boards.

With the development of palliative care systems, their role and position are changing. Given growing long-term care needs and limited resources in health and social care, volunteers are becoming an important resource in meeting these needs. In Croatia, palliative care has been developing as an integrated care model since 2014. To assess the position and the role of volunteers, we analyzed legislative documents from healthcare and social care and conducted a focus group with volunteers in palliative care. We found that volunteers provide support from the social aspect of care, for the patient and the family. The formal palliative care system involves them as partners in the provision of care, even though this cooperation is informal. The main determinants of their activities are an individualized approach, flexibility, a community presence, and project funding. In conclusion, these determinants allow them to react quickly to identified needs, but with them come some uncertainties of their sustainability. Their activities could indicate what needs to be integrated between health and social care and in what areas. Volunteers both fill in gaps in the system and are ahead of the system, and by doing this they develop new processes around identified unmet needs.

A multi-criteria method integrating the characteristics of the longitudinal profile (LP), the cross profile (CP) and the knickpoints of gullies was applied to identify the development stage of gullies in Yuanmou County, Yunnan Province, in southwestern China. Firstly, based on the high-resolution data sources produced by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), 50 gullies were selected as the typical ones in Tutujiliangzi and Shadi village. The LPs were extracted, and their morphological indices, information entropy and fitting functions were calculated. The morphological characteristics of the CPs and the presence or absence of knickpoints were recorded. The results show that the period of the gullies in Tutujiliangzi and Shadi is dominated by the deep incision period and the equilibrium adjustment period, which means that most gullies are in the period of the severe erosion stage. Among the gullies, 13 LPs’ morphological index is between 0.636 and 0.933, and the morphology of the LP presents an upward convex shape; the cross profiles are mainly V-shaped and U-shaped. Thirty-two LPs’ morphological index is between 1.005~2.384, which presents a slightly concave shape; the cross profiles are mainly repeated U-shapes. The remaining five LPs have a morphological index of 0.592, 0.462, 1.061, 1.344 and 0.888, respectively; the LPs of upstream and downstream are different. The LPs of the Tutujiliangzi gullies are nearly straight lines and slightly concave, while those of the Shadi village gullies are convex and nearly straight lines. The knickpoints and step-pools in Shadi village are more developed, while the gullies in Tutujiliangzi develop more rapidly. This study shows that in counties with similar conditions, these conditions such as temperature and precipitation, local topographic changes, soil properties and vegetation conditions have obvious effects on the development of gullies.

The tailings dam was modelled as point, flat ground and top level, total emitting surface area (true geometry) and volume source geometries. The true area geometry was considered as the baseline source geometry. To improve the accuracy of the model predictions as compared to traditional approaches, the true geometry area source term was corrected to account for cracks and fissures on the tailings and the geometry of tailings dam was modelled by considering all emitting surfaces as sources. Compared to the baseline, the model overpredicted the flat ground area source by up to 274% and underpredicted the top-level area source by up to 50%. The volume emission source was overpredicted by up to 300% in 60% of the modelling runs and underpredicted by 55% in 40% of the volume model runs. While the top-level area source term produced lower concentrations at near-field ground-level receptors, accounting for the wakes effect increased the radon concentrations from the top-level area source of the tailings dam by up to 239%. From the modelling results, the highest concentration predicted by the model from the true geometry source was found to be 0.843 Bq m−3, which corresponds to the dose of 0.012 mSv/y to the public due to radon from the tailings. This value is less than the 1 mSv/y dose constraint stipulated by the National Nuclear Regulator.

Additionally, it explores the perceptions and attitudes of the community about the performance of LHWs. A self-administered instrument was applied to gather data on different parameters, such as children’s height, age, weight, and socioeconomic status from 384 rural households in a marginalized district of Punjab province with the help of a purposive random sampling technique. The binary logistic regression model was employed for the computation of the probability of malnutrition. The prevalences of stunting, underweight children, and wasting in the district were 34.8%, 46.1%, and 15.5%, respectively. The logistic results illustrate that those households in which LHW visits occur regularly within 15 days (OR = 0.28 with 95% CI: 0.09–0.82) have a lower probability of malnutrition prevalence among their children. The distance to the health facility shows that the odds of malnutrition were higher from 3–4 Kilometers (Km) (OR = 2.61, 95% CI: 0.85–8.14), and odds were also higher for the ≥5 km category (OR = 2.88, 95% CI: 0.94–8.82). Children from richer families had lower chances of being malnourished (OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.07–1.14). Furthermore, the respondents show a positive attitude towards LHWs. They have given the first rank to their performance being beneficial to mothers and childcare, especially on checkups and safe deliveries, while they have shown negative responses and given lower ranks to their performance due to irregular visits (6th rank) and poor community awareness (7th rank). We conclude that LHWs’ regular visits to targeted households and less distance to healthcare facilities reduce the malnutrition risk in under-five children.

Fourteen pesticides at variable concentrations were detected in 63% of the samples analyzed. The pesticides most frequently found at higher concentrations were insecticides (neonicotinoids, followed by organophosphates), herbicides, and fungicides. The number, frequency, and concentration of pesticides were higher in samples collected from hives located where intensive and highly-technified agriculture is practiced. Forty-three percent of the samples from that zone had residues of imidacloprid, compared with only 13% of the samples from the less-technified zone. Furthermore, 87.5% of those samples had imidacloprid concentrations that were above sublethal doses for honey bees (>0.25 ng/g) but that are not considered hazardous to human health by the European Commission. The results of this study suggest that honey can be used as a bioindicator of environmental contamination by pesticides, which highlights the need to continue monitoring contaminants in this product to determine the risks of pesticide impacts on pollinator health, on ecosystems, and on their potential implications to human health and other non-target organisms.

Some attributes could increase or decrease participants’ attendance. Thus, reliable and valid audit tools are needed in order to measure these attributes. This study aimed to develop and validate a tool to assess POS features within the Mexico City context. The Mexican Public Open Spaces Tool (MexPOS) was developed based on (1) two validated POS audit tools, (2) several visits to the POS, (3) pilot testing, and (4) multiple work sessions with a group of specialists. The original tool included 181 items divided into nine sections. Trained personnel visited and evaluated 944 POS in Mexico City. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to examine the construct validity of the items and the relationship between the subscales. The final model resulted in seven factors: (1) Food and Wellness Environment (α = 0.15), (2) Maintenance (α = 0.81), (3) Amenities (α = 0.72), (4) Legibility (α = 0.59), (5) Security (α = 0.48), (6) Perceived Environment (α = 0.65), and (7) Urban Environment (α = 0.58). Our study highlights the relevance of using a validated tool to measure POS characteristics related to participants’ attendance to help assess infrastructure improvements and identify priority areas for changing socio-urban environments for physical activity.

Social media provides an ideal platform for monitoring suicidal ideation. This paper presents an integrated model for multidimensional information fusion. By integrating the best classification models determined by single and multiple features, different feature information is combined to better identify suicidal posts in online social media. This approach was assessed with a dataset formed from 40,222 posts annotated by Weibo. By integrating the best classification model of single features and multidimensional features, the proposed model ((BSC + RFS)-fs, WEC-fs) achieved 80.61% accuracy and a 79.20% F1-score. Other representative text information representation methods and demographic factors related to suicide may also be important predictors of suicide, which were not considered in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the good try that feature combination and ensemble algorithms have been fused to detect user-generated content with suicidal ideation. The findings suggest that feature combinations do not always work well, and that an appropriate combination strategy can make classification models work better. There are differences in the information contained in different functional carriers, and a targeted choice classification model may improve the detection rate of suicidal ideation.

Heat stress has been further aggravated during the COVID-19 pandemic by the use of personal protective equipment to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, workers’ risk perception of heat stress is often low, with negative effects on their health and productivity. The study aims to identify workers’ needs and gaps in knowledge, suggesting the adaptation of measures that best comply with the needs of both workers and employers. A cross-sectional online questionnaire survey was conducted in Italy in the hottest months of 2020 (June–October) through different multimedia channels. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics; analytical tests and analysis of variance were used to evaluate differences between groups of workers. In total, 345 questionnaires were collected and analyzed. The whole sample of respondents declared that heat is an important contributor to productivity loss and 83% of workers did not receive heat warnings from their employer. In this context, the internet is considered as the main source of information about heat-related illness in the workplace. Results highlight the need to increase workers’ perception of heat stress in the workplace to safeguard their health and productivity. About two-thirds of the sample stated that working in the sun without access to shaded areas, working indoors without adequate ventilation, and nearby fire, steam, and hot surfaces, represent the main injuries’ risk factors.

It has shown the importance of preparing and planning in the future for an outbreak that overwhelms every aspect of a hospital on a rapidly expanding scale. We conducted a scoping review to identify, map, and systemize existing knowledge about the relationships between COVID-19 and hospital infrastructure adaptation and capacity planning worldwide. We searched the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed and hand-searched gray papers published in English between December 2019 and December 2021. A total of 106 papers were included: 102 empirical studies and four technical reports. Empirical studies entailed five reviews, 40 studies focusing on hospital infrastructure adaptation and planning during the pandemics, and 57 studies on modeling the hospital capacity needed, measured mostly by the number of beds. The majority of studies were conducted in high-income countries and published within the first year of the pandemic. The strategies adopted by hospitals can be classified into short-term (repurposing medical and non-medical buildings, remote adjustments, and establishment of de novo structures) and long-term (architectural and engineering modifications, hospital networks, and digital approaches). More research is needed, focusing on specific strategies and the quality assessment of the evidence.
