        "text": "Those were rare spots for those two franchises.\n\nThe Hawks won the lottery after having only a 3% chance of landing the top pick. They had picked No. 1 only one other time, in 1975.\n\nWashington had the top pick in 2001 (Kwame Brown) and 2010 (John Wall), but those were the only times in the past half-century the team had selected in the top two.\n\nElsewhere in the division, the Orlando Magic were also in an unusual spot after making the playoffs this past season. They picked Colorado forward Tristan da Silva at No. 18 — their lowest first-round pick since 2012.\n\nThe Hawks and Wizards may have been in close proximity in the draft, but on the court the teams are in very different positions entering this offseason. The Hawks were in the play-in round last season, with Trae Young and Dejounte Murray averaging over 20 points a game. Now they add French teen Zaccharie Risacher to the mix.\n\nThe Wizards, meanwhile, lost a franchise-record 67 games, and expectations figure to be low again even after taking French 7-footer Alex Sarr one spot after Risacher.\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\nNeeds: Defensive help at every level.\n\nWho they drafted: Risacher at No. 1 and forward Nikola Djurisic of Serbia at No. 43.\n\nNBA comparision for Risacher: He said he and Golden State shooting guard Klay Thompson have “the same game.” Risacher then quickly added Thompson has the advantage of being a veteran while he must improve. Risacher is quick and athletic at 6-foot-9, 215 pounds and should provide both scoring and defensive skills on the wing.\n\nCharlotte Hornets\n\nNeeds: The Hornets had plenty of issues across the board last season, none bigger than their defense. Charlotte finished second-to-last in the league in defensive rating. The Hornets also need to add more 3-point shooting and rebounding.\n\nWho they drafted: Forward Tidjane Salaun of France at No. 6 and guard KJ Simpson of Colorado at No. 42.\n\nNBA comparison for Salaun: He has plenty of length and intensity and reminds some of a more athletic version of Otto Porter Jr. or Jonas Jerebko. The big question will be how he develops as a shooter. Just 18, he played very well at the Basketball Without Borders camp and was named MVP of the 2023 Trophy of the Future tournament, averaging 17.7 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. The Hornets passed on UConn center Donovan Clingan to take the 6-9 Salaun.\n\nMiami Heat\n\nNeeds: Size\n\nWho they drafted: Indiana center Kel’el Ware at No. 15 and guard Pelle Larsson of Arizona at No. 44.\n\nNBA comparision for Ware: He might be considered a Myles Turner type, a 7-footer with serious offensive skills, a knack for rim protection and outstanding in the pick-and-roll. Ware also will immediately benefit from playing alongside Heat captain Bam Adebayo, who could get more minutes at power forward if Ware can take center minutes.\n\nOrlando Magic\n\nNeeds: Perimeter shooting. The Magic were last in the NBA in 3-point field goals and 24th in 3-point percentage.\n\nWho they drafted: Da Silva at No. 18.\n\nNBA comparison: Philadelphia’s Tobias Harris because of his size, all-around game and maturity.\n\nWashington Wizards\n\nNeeds: Washington is only a year into its rebuild, so the Wizards didn’t necessarily have to be picky about fit — but it happened that some of the top players available also had good size, which the team can use after dealing Kristaps Porzingis and Daniel Gafford in the fairly recent past.\n\nWho they drafted: Sarr with the No. 2 pick, Pittsburgh guard Bub Carrington at No. 14 and 6-8 Kyshawn George of Miami at No. 24.\n\nNBA comparison for Sarr: He says he admires Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo, although his defensive impact may make him more comparable to Jaren Jackson Jr. initially.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Associated Press.
