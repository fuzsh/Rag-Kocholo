        "text": "First official post for this blog and we are starting with probably one of the biggest duds in NBA draft history, Kwame Brown. Kwame Brown is a prime example of a player who should have gone to college first. In high school he was regarded as the “best high school player” which is a big call considering some of the other players from his year level (but we will discuss them in other posts). He was named in 2001 for the McDonald’s All-America team and set records at his school for leading rebounder and shot-blocker. In his final year of high school he averaged 20 points, 13.3 rebounds, 5.8 blocks, 3 assists and 2 steals per game. Long story short, this kid was good in high school. Unfortunately his skills did not translate into the NBA and plays that he was able to do in high school so easily become impossible for him in the pros.\n\nOne of the main reasons he is regarded as a flop was he was the number one draft pick for the Washington Wizards in 2001. He was the first high school draftee to be picked number one. Not only that, but he was picked by the then team president Michael Jordan (not sure if you have heard of him). So you can probably expect that there were a lot of expectations for him. His rookie season was hardly anything special. He stats that year were 4.5 points, 3.5 rebounds and .5 blocks per game. During his time at Washington he posted mediocre stats with the occasional brilliant games here and there, but he was not consistent at all.\n\nSince being in the league he has been on seven different teams with his best season being his third where he averaged his career high 10.9 points and 7.4 rebounds per game. Many say it was Kwame Brown’s small hands, which made it hard for him to handle the ball in the NBA, the reason he failed in the pros. Others say he wasn’t interested enough to push him to be better that made him so bad. Whatever the reason he will forever be remembered as a terrible draft choice and one of the reasons why the NBA raised the age limit of future draftees. Unfortunately there are very few (if any) highlights for Kwame Brown, so here are some bloopers instead."
