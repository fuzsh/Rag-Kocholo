Ruffin was a second-round pick by the Bulls in the 1999 NBA draft and has made three stops in his four years in the league, starting with Chicago, then moving to Philadelphia, and finally Utah. He now makes Washington his home.\n\nHis career high in rebounding came on November 9, 2000 against the Magic when he pulled down 18 boards in 43 minutes of action. That same game, he also hit 8 of 16 free throws, both career highs. His career free throw percentage hovers around the fifty percent mark.\n\nTEAM NOTES\n\nThe Washington Wizards have released their complete 2004-2005 regular season schedule.\n\nYou can shop at the Wizards team storewhere you can personalized jerseys with your name and number.\n\nNEWSLINES\n\nThe United Press International writes inThe Washington Times: Washington Wizards forward Kwame Brown underwent successful surgery Tuesday to repair a fracture in his right foot injured while playing basketball.\"The surgery went as expected and was successful,\" said President of Basketball Operations Ernie Grunfeld. \"Our doctors foresee no problems for Kwame's healing process, and feel that he will be ready for training camp in October.\"\n\nThe Washington Postreports: Michael Ruffin signed a contract with the Washington Wizards yesterday, rewarding him for solid play with the team during summer league games.Ruffin, a 6-foot-8 forward, averaged a team-high 7.3 rebounds over the summer.
