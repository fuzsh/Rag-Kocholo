        "text": "Chris Graythen/Getty Images\n\nThe Wizards return to a familiar spot in the 2012 draft—the lottery.\n\nWhile Kwame Brown (2001, No. 1 Pick) continues to appear in the nightmares of Washingtonians, the likes of John Wall (2010, No. 1 Pick) and Jan Vesely (2011, No. 6 Pick) are still defining their respective legacies in the District.\n\nInconsistencies among both management and personnel have left the Wizards entrenched in mediocrity, finishing 14th out of 15 teams in the East in 2011-2012 (20-46 record). A decent finish to the season has fans hoping that the addition of a lottery pick will bring the Wizards closer to the playoffs.\n\nWith their recent acquisition of Nene from the Denver Nuggets, the Wizards seem prepared to field an adequate frontcourt in 2012. However, the Wizards are in desperate need of a scoring guard. Wall has proven himself as a passer, but Washington has missed an outside threat to both stretch the defense and put points on the board.\n\nKentucky’s Anthony Davis is an almost certain No. 1 pick to the New Orleans Hornets, while the Charlotte Bobcats at No. 2 will leave the Wizards guessing. Many mock drafts have predicted that the Bobcats will select Kansas’ Thomas Robinson. Robinson and UConn’s Andre Drummond headline the Class of 2012’s big men. As Charlotte’s pick is up in the air, here are the 3 most likely options for the Wizards other than Anthony Davis.\n\n1. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist\n\nThe 6’7\" freshman offers the Wizards a strong option at the 2 or 3 positions. Similarly, he comes out of the same Kentucky system as John Wall. Kidd-Gilchrist averaged just under 12 points per game this past year and he has the skill set to develop into a star in the NBA. One drawback is his mediocre outside shooting, where he made just 25 percent of field goals from behind the arc in 2011-2012.\n\n2. Harrison Barnes\n\nIf Charlotte selects Kidd-Gilchrist, it is hard to say which direction the Wizards will head. Barnes is a likely choice, as he has refined his game over the course of two years on loaded teams at North Carolina. Though he is a stronger outside shooter than Kidd-Gilchrist, Barnes often fades down the stretch.\n\n3. Bradley Beal\n\nThough smaller than Kidd-Gilchrist and Barnes, Florida’s Beal (6’3\") has proven himself in both high school and college. The 2011 High School Gatorade Player of the Year put up nearly 15 points a game and shot over 30 percent from behind the arc."
