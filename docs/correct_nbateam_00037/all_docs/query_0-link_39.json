        "text": "Michael Jordan made a home with the Chicago Bulls over the course of 13 seasons. But at the tail end of his career, Jordan decided to suit up for the Washington Wizards following a three-year retirement from the NBA.\n\nHis time with the Wizards was just a short blip of his legendary career, and contrary to his Bulls tenure, Jordan did not have fond memories with the team as they fell short of making the NBA playoffs in his two seasons.\n\nDespite his middling campaign with the Wizards, Jordan, for what it’s worth, was not lacking optimism about his chances on winning what was supposed to be the seventh NBA championship of his career.\n\nKwame Brown, who played with Jordan in Washington, revealed that Jordan was even willing to trade the young guys on the team in order to increase their chances on making the NBA playoffs and eventually winning the NBA championship.\n\nPer HoopsHype:\n\n“You had a coach in Doug Collins who didn’t believe in playing young players, and Michael didn’t either,” said Brown. “Michael’s last hoorah, he wanted to win a championship. He thought that if he could get to the playoffs, he could win a championship. I was meant to be traded. They wanted to trade me or Tyson Chandler to the Clippers for Elton Brand.”"
