        "text": "French basketball players are doing it right.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks selected 6-8 forward Zaccharie Risacher with the No. 1 pick in Wednesday’s NBA draft, making Risacher the 15th international player to go No. 1.\n\nRisacher and 2023 No. 1 pick Victor Wembanyama are the first two French players drafted No. 1 in consecutive years.\n\nThe Hawks need this pick - their first No. 1 pick since 1975 - to work out. They won the lottery with just 3% odds to get the pick, and Risacher, 19, gives Atlanta a two-way wing. He has spent his early professional career playing in France’s top pro league, and in 2023-24, he averaged 10.1 points and 3.8 rebounds and shot 43.9% from the field and 35.2% on 3-pointers this season for JL Bourg.\n\nHe was named French League Best Young Player and EuroCup Rising Star in 2023-24. Risachaer was on Wembanyama’s team with Asvel in 2021-22.\n\nAlex Sarr, also of France, was selected No. 2 by the Washington Wizards, marking the first time French players have swept the top two spots.\n\nTidjane Salaun, selected sixth by the Charlotte Hornets, and Pacôme Dadiet, taken at No. 25 by the New York Knicks, had joined their French counterparts by the evening's end.\n\nWHERE ARE PLAYERS FROM? NBA draft's first two picks show league's global reach\n\nRead on for USA TODAY Sports' analysis for all 30 picks from the first round of the 2024 NBA draft, news, trades and highlights:\n\nATLANTA — It would be difficult to have a strong opinion about Zaccharie Risacher, the NBA’s newly-minted No. 1 overall draft pick, unless JL Bourg of the LNB Élite league was somehow part of your basketball viewing menu last season. But there’s a reason that the people who actually get paid to pay attention to this stuff — and whose jobs depend on getting it right — have liked Risacher since he was 16 years old.\n\nIn the modern NBA, tall wings who can shoot from the perimeter and defend multiple positions are among the rarest commodities. Just ask the New York Knicks, who are about to pay OG Anunoby more than $200 million despite never averaging more than 17.1 points per game and just gave up a ransom of draft picks for Mikal Bridges. Read Dan Wolken's column.\n\nThe reigning champions are adding Scheierman, who will be right at home. The Celtics collectively shot 38.8% from the 3-point line last season. Scheierman averaged 18.5 points last year, shooting 44.8% from the field and 38.1% from beyond the arc, in addition to averaging 9.0 rebounds and 3.9 assists. — Cydney Henderson\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — At times during the 2023-24 season Collier was a projected lottery pick. The Trojans didn’t have a great season, and Collier, who averaged 16.3 points and 4.3 assists and shot 49% from the field, dropped in the draft. However, the 6-3, 205-pounder has an NBA-ready frame, is strong and gets to the rim and finishes. He needs to work on an inconsistent jump shot and can be a shut-down defender if he puts his mind to it. He could end up being a valuable pick at this point in the draft. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — This is a pick made with defense in mind. Dunn is a tall and long guard, standing 6-foot-8, and uses that length to smother opposing players. He led the ACC in blocks per game with 2.26, ranking 16th overall in the nation. He also puts in excellent effort on the glass, leading Virginia with 6.9 rebounds per game. Dunn is not afraid to press up on defense, but he will need to put in a lot of work on his scoring and perimeter shooting. He went only 7-of-35 (20%) from 3-point range. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n∎ Denver will trade pick Nos. 28, 56 and two future second-round selections to Phoenix for the No. 22 pick, DaRon Holmes II, according to ESPN.\n\nMinnesota is getting an elite scorer — Shannon averaged 23.04 points, 4.0 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game at Illinois last season. His draft stock dropped after he was accused of rape, but Shannon was found not guilty following a June trial. The Timberwolves are coming off an appearance in the Western Conference finals, which they dropped to the Dallas Mavericks in five games. — Cydney Henderson\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — Jones averaged 20.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 2.0 steals and shot 48.9% from the field and 85.7% on free throws in 2023-24 and is the only player in Big Sky history to record at least 1,000 points, 1,000 rebounds, 400 assists and 200 steals in a career. He also played 37 minutes per game in his senior season. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\n∎ The Wizards traded this pick to the Knicks who then traded it to Oklahoma City, a person familiar with the trade told USA TODAY Sports. The Knicks will get multiple second-round picks from the Thunder.\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — One pick after New York traded what was supposed to be two consecutive selections, the Knicks did make their pick at 25, taking yet another French player, making it four in the first round. Dadiet figures to be something of a project, being one of the youngest players in the draft. Dadiet doesn’t turn 19 until July 27, though he’s another athletic wing with plenty of length and athleticism — following the trend of teams loading up on them. Dadiet also flashed an ability to make passes after he slashed to the basket, but he will almost certainly need seasoning and experience before he can become a steady contributor. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThe Wizards wasted no time in taking George, a guard who averaged 7.6 points, 3.0 rebounds and 2.2 assists last season. — Cydney Henderson\n\n∎ The Knicks are trading the No. 24 pick to Washington for the No. 26 and No. 51 picks, according to a person with direct knowledge of the deal.\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — The Bucks do not have much roster flexibility with money tied up in Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard and Khris Middleton. They need to add depth with smart draft picks and savvy salary cap exceptions. Milwaukee selected Johnson, an American-born 6-4 combo guard who spent last season playing in Australia’s top pro league. He didn’t receive a lot of playing time there (7.7 minutes per game) but impressed scouts and executives with his scoring, passing, strength and athleticism at the draft combine. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — One of the few bright spots for the Dayton Flyers in the NCAA tournament, Holmes is a natural scorer whose game should translate immediately at the next level. He also has plenty of experience, playing through his junior season, and is a pure inside-out scorer who has no qualms about finishing at the rim. In Dayton’s second-round loss to Arizona in the tournament, Holmes scored a game-high 23 points, nine more than the next closest Flyer. He’s also a force on defense, ranking in the top 30 in the nation in blocks per game in each of his three seasons at Dayton. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n∎ Phoenix will trade the No. 22 pick to the Denver Nuggets for Nos. 28, 56 and two future second-round picks, according to ESPN.\n\nMissi averaged 10.7 points, 5.6 rebounds and a team-high 1.5 blocks per game at Baylor last season. New Orleans will get elite rim protection and a lob threat from Missi, who boasts a 7-foot-2 wingspan. Missi will join Zion Williamson, the No. 1 pick of the 2019 NBA draft, and Brandon Ingram, the No. 2 overall pick in 2016. The Pelicans are coming off a first-round sweep in the NBA playoffs last season, losing four in a row to the Oklahoma City Thunder. — Cydney Henderson\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — The Cavaliers, who were 48-34 last season, are trying to improve a roster for new coach Kenny Atkinson. Cleveland drafted Tyson, a small forward who can score, sees the court well and moves well without the ball. Tyson is a solid rebounder, can initiate offense as a playmaker either passing or creating shots for himself and knows how to utilize his size in pick-and-rolls as a ball-handler. He averaged 19.6 points, 6.8 rebounds and 3.5 assists and 46.5% from the field and 36% on 3-pointers in 2023-24. Cal was his third school in three seasons. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — Toronto, building around forward Scottie Barnes, is adding much-needed scoring in Walter. The Big 12 Freshman of the Year, Walter scored the second-most points in Baylor history for a freshman. Walter has plenty of range on his shot, and while he’s not the tallest at 6-foot-4, he has excellent length and elevates well on his jump shot, making it difficult to block. He also does a great job of shaking defenders off on the perimeter, allowing him to create his shot. For the Raptors, who ranked 21st in scoring (112.4 points per game), his ability to finish should be huge. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nTristan da Silva is headed to Florida. The 6-8 forward averaged 9.0 points per game at Colorado last season, shooting 46.6% from the field and 35.2% from three, and will bring his mobility and knock-down ability to the league. Da Silva joins Paolo Banchero, the No. 1 overall pick of the 2022 NBA draft. Orlando made the playoffs last season for first time since 2020 after finishing 47-35, the team’s strongest record since 2011. — Cydney Henderson\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — With a new coach in J.J. Redick and a team playing for the present (LeBron James, Anthony Davis) and the future, the Lakers went with Knecht who at 23 years old should be able to contribute sooner rather later. He is strong on catch-and-shoot 3s, can drive to the basket with power and finesse, and is athletic. He needs work defensively. He delivered great offensive performances late in the season, scoring 40 against Kentucky and 37 against Purdue in the Elite Eight. He averaged 21.7 points and 4.9 rebounds and shot 45.8% from the field and 39.7% on 3-pointers for the Volunteers. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — The 76ers are giving Tyrese Maxey some help in the backcourt. Philly still needs to lock up Maxey, who is a restricted free agent, though that is almost certain to happen. McCain, though, brings a similar skill set: he’s a sharp-shooting guard with natural offensive instincts, he can create for others off the dribble and he’s not afraid of the big stage. McCain drilled eight 3-point shots in an NCAA tournament second-round game against James Madison. He posted three games of 30 or more points, most by any freshman in Division I. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nIt’s been a big day for France with one of its most successful drafts in NBA history.\n\nWith Zaccharie Risacher and Alex Sarr the first two picks in the draft, it’s the first time two Frenchmen went 1-2 in the NBA draft.\n\nOn top of that, with Tidjane Salaun taken sixth overall, it’s the first time three Frenchmen were selected in the top 10. It’s also the first time a country other than the U.S. has had three players drafted in the top 10. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWare is taking his talents to South Beach. Ware averaged 15.9 points, 9.9 rebounds and 1.9 blocks last year at Indiana, leading the Hoosiers in points, rebounds and blocks per game. Ware will bring his rebounding skills, scoring and defense to the Heat, who lost to the Boston Celtics in the first round of the NBA playoffs last season in part because of injuries after advancing all the way to the 2023 NBA Finals. The Heat are locking down Bam Adebayo, who intends to sign an extension, a person with knowledge of of Adebayo's plans told USA TODAY. They were not authorized to speak publicly until the deal is final. Jimmy Butler’s future in Miami after this season remains a question mark. — Cydney Henderson and Jeff Zillgitt\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — The Blazers went big with Donovan Clingan at No. 7 and then selected a playmaking guard in Carrington at No. 14. Carrington has great size for a guard (6-4, 195) and he can play either guard spot. Carrington has range with his shot (he needs to become more proficient) and does a little bit of everything offensively, keeping teammates involved with his passing. He is also a solid rebounder. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\n∎ Carrington is headed to Washington as part of a deal that sent Deni Avdija to Portland, a person familiar with the trade confirmed to USA TODAY Sports.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs, the Kings looked to strengthen an already full backcourt with Carter. The Kings already have starting guards De’Aaron Fox and Kevin Heurter and they just re-signed Malik Monk, the runner-up for the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year award, to a huge deal. They also have Keon Ellis and Davion Mitchell coming off the bench. Still, Carter shot up draft boards during the pre-draft process and he brings instant scoring ability; Carter led the Big East with 19.7 points per game and he brings extra effort in rebounding and defense. — Cydney Henderson\n\nDalton Knecht is at the 2024 NBA draft with his family and Tennessee coach Rick Barnes as he waits to live out a childhood dream of hearing his name called by NBA commissioner Adam Silver. But for a brief second ESPN's broadcast showed someone other than the Vols forward — the second production error for the network this week after missing the Florida Panthers hoist the Stanley Cup on Monday.\n\nDuring the introduction of players at the 2024 NBA draft at the Barclays Center on Wednesday, ESPN broadcast a lower-third graphic with Knecht's name. However, the camera was trained on French forward Tidjane Salaun instead of Knecht. Salaun would go No. 6 overall to the Charlotte Hornets. — John Leuzzi, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe Thunder will get an elite playmaker with great court vision in Topic, but Thunder fans may have to wait to see him on the court. Topic, who averaged 18.4 points, 3.9 rebounds and 7.3 assists last season on KK Crvena Zvezda, suffered a partially torn ACL in May. The Thunder had a breakout season last year, making it as far as the Western Conference semifinals after finishing 57-25 on the year. Topic will join Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the 11th overall pick of the 2018 NBA draft, and Chet Holmgren, the second pick of the 2022 NBA draft. — Cydney Henderson\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — Some scouts saw Buzelis as a top-five prospect. Buzelis, who was born in Chicago but also has Lithuanian citizenship, played for the G League Ignite last season and averaged 14.1 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.9 blocks and shot 45.3% from the field but just 26.1% on 3-pointers. His scoring increased as the G League season progressed and he has impressed scouts and executives with his feel for the game. He has good leaping ability, surprises with his dunks, has a soft shooting touch, plays through contact and has playmaking ability. He tested well at the combine with agility, vertical leap and other drills. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — If the Jazz get out of Williams half of what the Thunder have gotten from his brother Jalen — the No. 12 overall pick of the 2022 draft — Utah would be pretty pleased. Williams dealt with some injury issues as a freshman with the Buffaloes, but he should become an instant contributor for the Jazz, given his length and defensive prowess and smooth, unhurried play making on offense. Williams, like his brother, was ultra-efficient, shooting 55.2% from the field at Colorado. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThe Grizzlies went big with their first-round pick, selecting Purdue superstar Edey. The two-time college player of the year averaged 25.2 points, 12.2 rebounds and 2.2 blocks last season at Purdue and led the Boilermakers to the NCAA title game. The Grizzlies finished 27-55 last season and were dead last in offensive rating, due in part to the absence of Ja Morant, who missed a majority of the season due to suspension and injury. — Cydney Henderson\n\nDonovan Clingan has dedicated his basketball career to his mother, and he made sure to have a piece of her with him when he was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers. Inside of his suit jacket he has pictures of his family, and on the other side are pictures of him and his mom.\n\nClingan’s mother, Stacey Clingan, died of breast cancer in 2018. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — The only team with two picks in the top 10, the Spurs drafted the 6-2 Dillingham. However, the Spurs are sending that pick to Minnesota. Dillingham is elite at creating his own shot through spot-up shooting or dribble penetration because of his speed and ball-handling. Will need to get stronger and improve shot selection. He averaged 15.2 points, 3.9 assists and 2.9 rebounds in freshman season and will give the Timberwolves depth at the guard spot. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\n∎ The Spurs will trade Dillingham to Minnesota for an unprotected first-round pick in 2031 and a pick swap in 2030, a person familiar with the trade confirmed to USA TODAY Sports.\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — The second UConn Husky and first pure center is off the board. Clingan, the 7-foot-2, 282-pound big who won back-to-back national championships at UConn now joins a fascinating front court pairing in Portland, alongside Deandre Ayton — a fellow 7-footer. Despite his size, Clingan moves quite well in the post, especially on defense, where he should become an instant rim protector. He did well in college when doubled, finding cutting teammates for easy looks. His offensive game might need a little more polish, but he should be an instant threat in the pick-and-roll and with lobs. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nAnother Frenchman is off the board. The Hornets selected Salaun. The Charlotte Hornets are looking to shore up both sides of the ball. The Hornets, who finished 21-61 last season, ranked in the bottom three in the league in both defensive and offensive rating. Insert Salaun, a lengthy wing player and elite shooter. Salaun, 18, averaged 8.2 points and 3.9 rebounds last year on Cholet. — Cydney Henderson\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — New Pistons president of basketball operations Trajan Langdon is making an impact in short time. His first major player personnel decision is taking Holland with the fifth pick. Holland is an explosive 6-7 wing who averaged 19.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists for the Ignite. He shot 45.5% from the field but needs work on his 3-point shot (23.7%). Holland has great athleticism, flourishes in the open court (fantastic dunker) and increased his scoring as the season progressed. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — One year after they selected 7-foot-4 French phenom Victor Wembanyama, the Spurs turned to their backcourt. San Antonio secured a versatile guard in Stephon Castle, who might be most comfortable with the ball in his hands, making plays for others. That’s exactly what the Spurs need, after they cycled through a few options at point guard last season without much success. Castle averaged 11. 1 points per game in his freshman season at Connecticut, but if he can develop a pick-and-roll game with Wembanyama, the Spurs could very well have an elite pairing for years to come. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThe Rockets selected Reed Sheppard out of Kentucky. Sheppard averaged 12.5 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.5 assists last year at Kentucky. The Rockets will get an elite scorer and ball handler in Sheppard. He will join Houston’s young core of Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun and Jabari Smith Jr., who helped the Rockets finish 41-41 last season, a major jump from their 22-60 finish in 2022-23. — Cydney Henderson\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — The Wizards are in a deep rebuild (they reached a deal to trade Deni Avdija to Portland before the draft began) and took the 7-0 center from France. Alex Sarr has work to do on the offensive end but is a strong defender and shot-blocker who plays with force on both ends. In a September exhibition, Sarr blocked 12 shots in two games against the G League Ignite. Sarr, whose brother Olivier is on a two-way contract with Oklahoma City, averaged 9.4 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.5 blocks and shot 51.6% from the field in 2023-24. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — Though they still have decisions to make on the futures of guards Trae Young and Dejounte Murray, the Hawks secured an elite two-way wing out of France in Zaccharie Risacher. He’s a fluid athlete who moves well for his 6-foot-9 frame. He can create shots from all three levels on the floor and should get plenty of spot-up looks, regardless of who remains in Atlanta’s backcourt. He’ll need to bulk up some to contend on defense against some of the stronger wings in the NBA, but his plus perimeter defense will be a welcome addition on a team that tied for 28th in opposing points per game (120.5). — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nMore: Who is Zaccharie Risacher? Everything to know about Atlanta Hawks' No. 1 draft pick\n\nThe first round will be broadcast on ESPN and ABC.\n\nThe first round is Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET\n\nThe draft will be streamed on ESPN+, YouTube TV and fuboTV.\n\nThe draft has two rounds. The first is Wednesday, for picks No. 1-30. The second is Thursday, for picks No. 31-58.\n\nThe first round begins Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET, with the first pick being made shortly after. The second round begins Thursday afternoon at 4 p.m. ET.\n\nDuring the draft, each team will have five minutes to make its selection in the first round. That number decreases to four minutes in the second round. All in all, the first round should take between three and four hours with television commercial time included.\n\nFrance’s Zaccharie Risacher will go No. 1 to the Atlanta Hawks in Wednesday’s NBA draft. The second choice will be Alexandre Sarr to the Washington Wizards.\n\nIt is a deep draft among lottery picks beyond Risacher and Sarr. Here is the top five in USA TODAY Sports’ latest mock draft:\n\nHawks: Zaccharie Risacher, JL Bourg (France), Forward, 19 years old, 6-8, 195 pounds\n\nWizards: Alexandre Sarr, Perth (Australia) Wildcats, Forward/center, 19 years old, 7-0, 224\n\nRockets: Reed Sheppard, Kentucky, Guard, 20 years old, 6-2, 182\n\nSpurs: Matas Buzelis, G League Ignite, Forward, 19 years old, 6-9, 197\n\nPistons: Cody Williams, Colorado, Forward, 19 years old, 6-6, 178\n\nOver the past two years, Zach Edey has had no peers in college basketball.\n\nThe Purdue big man was as decorated a figure as the sport has seen in decades, putting up gaudy scoring and rebounding numbers, doing so with relative efficiency and becoming the first person to sweep the six major national player of the year awards in consecutive years since Bill Walton in 1972 and 1973.\n\nPhysically, he was unlike anyone else he went up against, towering over the competition every time he took the court, even against some of the country’s best and most talented teams.\n\nLife in the NBA figures to be slightly different. — Craig Meyer\n\nATLANTA — Hello from the Atlanta Hawks' training facility, where the media is eagerly awaiting who they will take with the No. 1 draft pick.\n\nAn interesting nugget from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski moments ago that the Hawks had narrowed it down to Zaccharie Risacher or Reed Sheppard. If the Hawks buck conventional wisdom and take Sheppard, it would almost certainly signal major changes in Atlanta's organization are coming this summer.\n\nGiven Sheppard's size concerns, he's just not a fit alongside Trae Young in what would be the smallest backcourt in the NBA. It wouldn't fix any of Atlanta's defensive problems and would almost certainly leave the Hawks worse defensively on the perimeter.\n\nSo one can only surmise that if the Hawks go with Sheppard, the franchise might be ready to part with Young in a trade. We'll find out soon. — Dan Wolken\n\nOutside of the lottery picks, the most intrigue of the NBA draft will be to see which team takes a flier on Bronny James.\n\nWith his medical concerns behind him, the 6-foot-2 James certainly isn’t the first prospect to have an underwhelming collegiate career and was drafted strictly on future potential.\n\nFor someone who averaged less than five points a game during his lone season at USC with scouts and executives split on his actual NBA skills, James’ name being attached to certain teams and working out for others could be a smokescreen to keep other teams from really evaluating him. It also may have something to do with his namesake’s future employer. Read more here.\n\nATLANTA — The Atlanta Hawks are on the clock; all that’s at stake are the viability of a young and untested front office, the credibility of a meddling owner and the future of a superstar point guard who has started to send signals that patience is running thin.\n\nBy the end of this NBA draft, for which the Hawks improbably hold the No. 1 pick after cashing in a 3% chance to win the lottery, they will either look a little bit different or a lot different.\n\nBut after three straight years of being relegated to the postseason play-in tournament despite an expensive roster, Trae Young’s offensive brilliance and a supposedly transformational coaching hire in Quin Snyder, change is needed. And change is almost assuredly coming. Read Dan Wolken’s column.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, it looks like an international player will be the No. 1 overall pick in the NBA draft.\n\nIf it’s Zaccharie Risacher or Alexandre Sarr – and they are Nos. 1-2 in several mock drafts – that player will also become the 15th international player selected No. 1. It also would be the first time that two French players were selected No. 1 in consecutive seasons following Victor Wembanyama at No. 1 in 2023.\n\nAlso, Risacher and Sarr are in line to become the first pair of French players to go in the top five in the same draft.\n\nAt least two international players have been drafted in the top 10 every year since 2013, and at least 10 international players have been drafted since 2000. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nA lottery pick will be switching hands just before the draft begins.\n\nThe Washington Wizards are trading F Deni Avdija to the Portland Trail Blazers for Malcolm Brogdon, the 14th overall pick and a 2029 pick, a person familiar with the deal told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly until the deal is official. ESPN was first to report the news.\n\nAvdija is coming off one of the best seasons of his young career.

Thank you both for allowing me to be your DAD and be apart of your compass through life’s trials and tribulations!” — Craig Meyer\n\nThe Spurs and Trail Blazers are tied for most picks in the 2024 NBA draft with four each.\n\nSpurs picks: Nos. 4, 8 35, 48\n\nTrail Blazers picks: Nos. 7, 14, 34, 40\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets have the fewest picks in this year's draft as the only team with zero selections.\n\nCan anybody enter the draft? Here are the rules of eligibility for the NBA draft.\n\nAge: The NBA's collective bargaining agreement says that all players must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft.\n\nOne-and-done rule: The collective bargaining agreement says that \"at least one (1) NBA Season has elapsed since the player’s graduation from high school (or, if the player did not graduate from high school, since the graduation of the class with which the player would have graduated had he graduated from high school)\" in order for a player to be eligible for the NBA draft.\n\nInternational players: According to the collective bargaining agreement, an international player is defined as one \"(i) who has maintained a permanent residence outside of the United States for at least the three (3) years prior to the Draft, while participating in the game of basketball as an amateur or as a professional outside of the United States; (ii) who has never previously enrolled in a college or university in the United States; and (iii) who did not complete high school in the United States.\"\n\nDraft limits: A player seeking to be a part of the NBA can only enter two drafts. A player also cannot join the NBA unless he has met the eligibility requirements for the draft.\n\nZaccharie Risacher is the favorite to be drafted No. 1 overall by the Atlanta Hawks in the NBA draft, according to the latest BetMGM odds. The 19-year-old French forward is a -350 favorite to hear his name called first. Bronny James, however, is not expected to go first overall. The son of future Hall-of-Famer LeBron James is a +30000 longshot, although more than 20% of all tickets placed with BetMGM are hoping for the upset. The Los Angeles Lakers are -160 favorites to select James at some point in the draft. Alexandre Sarr (-700) is the favorite to go second overall, and Reed Sheppard (-200) is expected to be drafted third.\n\n— Richard Morin\n\nCheck out the latest offers with the best online sportsbooks and sports betting apps\n\nHere are the No. 1 picks this century.\n\n2024: Zaccharie Risacher (Atlanta Hawks)\n\n2023: Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio Spurs)\n\n2022: Paolo Banchero (Orlando Magic)\n\n2021: Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons)\n\n2020: Anthony Edwards (Minnesota Timberwolves)\n\n2019: Zion Williamson (New Orleans Pelicans)\n\n2018: Deandre Ayton (Phoenix Suns)\n\n2017: Markelle Fultz (Philadelphia 76ers)\n\n2016: Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)\n\n2015: Karl-Anthony Towns (Minnesota Timberwolves)\n\n2014: Andrew Wiggins (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\n2013: Anthony Bennett (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\n2012: Anthony Davis (New Orleans Hornets)\n\n2011: Kyrie Irving (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\n2010: John Wall (Washington Wizards)\n\n2009: Blake Griffin (LA Clippers)\n\n2008: Derrick Rose (Chicago Bulls)\n\n2007: Greg Oden (Portland Trail Blazers)\n\n2006: Andrea Bargnani (Toronto Raptors)\n\n2005: Andrew Bogut (Milwaukee Bucks)\n\n2004: Dwight Howard (Orlando Magic)\n\n2003: LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\n2002: Yao Ming (Houston Rockets)\n\n2001: Kwame Brown (Washington Wizards)\n\n2000: Kenyon Martin (New Jersey Nets)\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.
