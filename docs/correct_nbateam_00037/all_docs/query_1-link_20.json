        "text": "The day is coming and the time is finally here for the Washington Wizards to begin their offseason. Tomorrow is the day we all have been waiting for as the NBA Draft Lottery will air Tuesday May 16th, 2023 at 8PM Eastern Time. The Washington Wizards are in a desperate spot where they need a top pick in the draft as they are looking for a game changer. The Wizards aren’t only looking for a game changer or someone that will impact the team tremendously, but they are also in need of a franchise player as Bradley Beal is approaching his 30’s. Things typically go downhill once you reach that age marker. The question is have we seen the best of Bradley Beal?\n\nIf so, tomorrow night is even more important as this team is in need of a bit of some good luck. The Washington Wizards have a 6.7% chance of landing the Number One Overall Pick in this year’s NBA Draft. Fingers will be crossed as the ping pong balls are drawn tomorrow evening. It has been quite some time since the Wizards had the Number One Overall Pick. The last time they did, they selected a player who everyone seems to miss in John Wall with that pick way back in 2010. Should the Wizards look to draft another point guard if they do land the top pick is the ultimate question? Victor Wembanyama may be the consensus Number One Pick. However, the last time the Wizards selected a big man with the Number 1 Pick, it was Kwame Brown who didn’t have the NBA Career many expected him to have although still being a solid NBA Player. Be sure to tune in tomorrow evening as the winner of the NBA Lottery will be announced live on ESPN."
