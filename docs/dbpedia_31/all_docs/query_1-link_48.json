        "text": "Florian Schneider, one of the founders of Kraftwerk, the German band that revolutionized pop music through its embrace of synthesizers and electronic beats, leading to a broad influence over rock, dance music and hip-hop, has died. He was 73.\n\nIn a statement, the group said Mr. Schneider had died from cancer “just a few days” after his birthday, which was April 7.\n\nFounded in Düsseldorf in 1970 by Mr. Schneider and Ralf Hütter, Kraftwerk emerged as part of the so-called krautrock genre — a German branch of experimental rock that explored extended, repetitive rhythms.\n\nBut by the time Kraftwerk released its album “Autobahn” in 1974, it had become clear that the group had developed something even more elemental and extreme. The 22-minute title track, which took up the entire first side of the LP, began with a robotic voice intoning “autobahn,” German for highway. It continued with buoyant, hypnotic synthesizers that gave the listener a sense of gliding through a futuristic landscape, and with lyrics that repeated, “Wir fahren, fahren, fahren auf der Autobahn” (“We’re driving, driving, driving on the highway”)."
