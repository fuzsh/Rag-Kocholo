        "text": "Kraftwerk promotional image from 1975; Florian Schneider, third from left; Stara/Kraftwerk/Getty Images\n\nKraftwerk co-founder Florian Schneider has died at age 73, Variety reports.\n\nAccording to a statement from the German group, Schneider died “from a short cancer disease just a few days after his 73rd birthday.”\n\nSchneider created Kraftwerk in 1970 alongside Ralf Hütter. The massively impactful band helped pioneer electronic music, and have been cited as a major influence by artists across countless genres. David Bowie, for example, named his “Heroes” song “V-2 Schneider” after Schneider.\n\nKraftwerk’s most successful album was 1974’s Autobahn, which peaked at number five on the Billboard200 and produced a top-25 U.S. hit with its title track.\n\nSchneider left Kraftwerk in 2008, though the group continues with Hütter to this day. In 2014, the duo was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Kraftwerk has also been repeatedly nominated for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, but has yet to be inducted.\n\nCopyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved."
