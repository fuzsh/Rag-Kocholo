        "text": "The first time Kraftwerk appeared on British TV, it was not on Top of the Pops, but on Tomorrow’s World, demonstrating their technological approach to music making. “When they started there was a lot of fear of technology, and people said ‘oh look at these robot guys making music on computers, this is wrong,’” McLuskey recalls.\n\n“Well, it turned out that they were absolutely right, not just about music but in their whole vision of the future, the man-machine synthesis. And it’s not been scary, we have all embraced it and got on with our lives.” Indeed, if you tune into the pop charts in the 21st century, you might conclude the robots have taken over.\n\nFlorian Schneider was the son of a noted German architect, who became involved in a flourishing art rock scene in Dusseldorf in the late Sixties. He formed Kraftwerk with his closest ally, Ralf Hütter, in 1970. Their first three albums were not predominantly electronic, belonging more to a progressive jamming style that came to be known in the UK as Krautrock. Hütter played Hammond organ and Schneider played the flute, violin and guitar, filtered through electronic processing.\n\n“I found that the flute was too limiting,” he later explained. “Soon I bought a microphone, then loudspeakers, then an echo, then a synthesiser. Much later I threw the flute away; it was a sort of process.” His main interest, according to Hütter, was sound design and speech synthesis. Schneider played limited keyboards, but preferred to trigger sequences by pressing single notes.\n\nBy 1974’s Autobahn, Kraftwerk had evolved into a mysterious four piece dressed in sober business suits, standing immobile at their technology stations, making synthetic music that was sparse, linear and rhythmic, yet decorated with enticing melodies. Their dryly witty songs implied an almost mystical reverence for the ordinary objects of an industrial world.\n\n“Kraftwerk were hinting at the removal of some of the more human or primitive elements in music, the sweaty drummer, strutting lead guitarist,” in the opinion of McCluskey. “As a result they were viewed as cold, inhuman or frosty but in hindsight we have removed a lot more and the stuff from the Seventies actually seems quite human. What was often perceived as coldness was actually a kind of melancholy of emotional restriction.”\n\n“For anyone of our generation involved in electronic music, Kraftwerk were the Godfathers,” according to Martin Gore of Depeche Mode. “Radioactivity in 76, Trans-Europe Express in 77, Man Machine in 78, they still sound modern today. The electronic scene blew up after those pivotal albums.” David Bowie acknowledged Kraftwerk’s influence on his late Seventies Berlin trilogy, going so far as to name an instrumental track from Heroes in 1977 in honour of their co-founder: V-2 Schneider.\n\nAfrika Bambaataa’s groundbreaking 1982 hip-hop dance smash Planet Rock was built around a sample of Kraftwerk’s Trans-Europe Express. In 1983, New Order sampled Kraftwerk for their breakthrough dance rock hit Blue Monday. By the end of the Eighties, a whole new dance scene was emerging that mimicked Kraftwerk’s hypnotic synth beats of escalating intensity.\n\nAs Acid House and Techno became the dominant dance genres of the Nineties, Kraftwerk’s influence became less obvious, although they continued to be sampled by hundreds of artists, from Madonna to The Chemical Brothers, Jay Z to Coldplay. Rock bands including Blondie, Simple Minds, U2, Franz Ferdinand and LCD Sound System have incorporated their ideas. “Kraftwerk are in the psyche of modern pop,” according to Karl Hyde of Underworld. “It is something that has filtered down through machines and bits of software, loops and samples and bootlegs, processed and reprocessed and become a key part of the core fabric of electronic dance music.”\n\nKraftwerk have not released an album since Tour De France Soundtracks in 2003. Schneider quietly departed the fold in 2008, with neither fanfare nor explanation. It seems likely that he was disillusioned with performing. “He is a sound perfectionist, so, if the sound isn’t up to a certain standard, he doesn’t want to do it,” Ralph Hütter once noted of his bandmate. “With electronic music there’s no necessity ever to leave the studio. You could keep making records and sending them out. Why put so much energy into travel, spending time in airports, in waiting halls, in backstage areas, being like an animal, just for two hours of a concert?”\n\nIn 2015, Schneider and Telex producer Dan Lacksman released a sparse new piece, Stop Plastic Pollution, in support of ocean environmental conservatism, but Schneider otherwise stayed out of the spotlight. Meanwhile, Kraftwerk continued as a technologically bold touring act, featuring Hütter and three hired hands, in acclaimed performances built around pioneering 3D technology. “They have sort of turned themselves into their own tribute band,” as Andy McCluskey sees it. “Ralph Hütter has distilled the concept to its essence and managed to ostensibly remove the human element completely. But other people have taken it on into different places. Kraftwerk were a bridge from the past to the future. We live in Kraftwerk’s world now.”\n\nAs for the mysterious and reclusive Schneider, perhaps we should leave him with this quote, from a rare Rolling Stone interview in 1975, in which he rejected the notion that Kraftwerk’s electronic experiments represented the end of rock. “There is no beginning and no end in music,” Schneider said. “Some people want it to end. But it goes on.”"
