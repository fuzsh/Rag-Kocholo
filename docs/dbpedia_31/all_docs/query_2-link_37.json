        "text": "Kraftwerk’s Florian Schneider has died.\n\nNews broke today (6th May) that the influential German musician and co-founder of legendary electronic group Kraftwerk had died, aged 73. Billboard confirmed rumours of the artist’s passing. The Guardian reports that Schneider died of cancer a week ago and that he had a private burial.\n\nSchneider formed Kraftwerk with Ralf Hütter in 1970. Originally a flautist, Schneider, along with Hütter, began experimenting with and designing their own electronic instruments. The group went on to release several iconic albums, including ‘Autobahn’ (1974), ‘Trans-Europe Express’ (1977) and ‘Computer World’ (1981). Kraftwerk’s innovation and creativity has seen them credited as one of electronic music’s most influential and important acts. They were honoured with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement award in 2014.\n\nWhile Kraftwerk remain active today, Schneider officially left the group in 2008.\n\nThis year, Kraftwerk were to embark on a massive 50th anniversary tour with their legendary 3D live show. However, the tour was postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTributes have begun to come from across the electronic music landscape to the one-of-a-kind musician and innovator."
