        "text": "Florian Schneider-Esleben\n\nBorn on April 7th, 1947 in Kattenhorn, South Germany near Bodensee.\n\nHis parents are architect Paul Schneider-Esleben and Eva Maria Esleben.\n\nHe studied in Academy of Art in Remscheid, and later was a student of Robert Schumann Conservatorium in Düsseldorf.\n\nHis primary instrument was flute, which also served as base when in later years he knew he wanted to find different sounds to work with. He showed keen interest in building new instruments, sometimes by modifying original ones. First ones were electronically amplified flutes (piccolo, C flute, alto flute, bass flute), treated with different effects, like tape echo, ring modulation, use of pitch-to-voltage converter, fuzz and wah-wah. He also built electroviolin.\n\nIn 1968 he met Ralf Hütter while attending a course about musical improvisation. They both had in common boredom with classical music and shared an interest for creating contemporary electronic music, fluxus art and people rebuilding culture in Germany.\n\nTogether, alongside with three other people, they found a group called Organisation. It made one album, but didn’t last very long. Afterwards Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter decided to continue as a duo, and in 1970 the name of Kraftwerk saw daylight.\n\nEver since Florian has worked with creating special sound for their music, eventually ditching acoustic instruments completely and going fully electronic. Alongside synthesizers he has special fondness for linguistics and speech synthesis. He liked to use vocoder, and also made a speaking typewriter, which instead of typing, played the according sound when a key was pressed. The innovative use of non-instrument pocket calculator was also his idea.\n\nIn 2008, after almost 40 year collaboration he left Kraftwerk. He is said to work on his own projects now, and lives with his family in Meerbusch-Büderich across river Rhine where Düsseldorf is.\n\nOutside music field his interests are cycling and Japanese culture. He also has a special sense of humour of which he lets others know every now and then, but strongly dislikes facing public media (both journalists and photographers) or being described - such as here!\n\n…\n\nQuotes:\n\n“I studied seriously up to a certain level, then I found it boring, I looked for other things, I found that the flute was too limiting… Soon I bought a microphone, then loudspeakers, then an echo, then a synthesizer. Much later I threw the flute away, it was a sort of process.”\n\n“Sometimes I can taste the sounds. There are a lot more feelings than just the feeling going through the ears. The whole body can feel the sounds.”\n\n“A person doing experimental music must be responsible for the results of the experiments. They could be very dangerous emotionally.”\n\n“Sometimes I’m scared by all that stuff on stage, it’s so hard. There’s too much noise, but it works like a sado-masochist fascination.”\n\n“We say “blank tape” for the brain. A blank tape, and a microphone in each ear. In music, it’s important to develop an art of listening based on emptiness.”\n\n“I think for us there is no difference between a normal instrument or sound source in nature, like wind blowing through a tree. Sometimes people also say they are playing on natural instruments but they are not natural, they are also built and also made by human beings – there are no instruments that are natural.”\n\n“If I could explain the music of Kraftwerk, I wouldn’t need to make it!”\n\n…\n\nTo view full size: right click + “open image in a new tab”\n\n…\n\nSee all posts tagged Florian Schneider"
