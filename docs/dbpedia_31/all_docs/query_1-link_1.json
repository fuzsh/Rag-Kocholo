        "text": "Machines making music. Repetitive, metronomic, locked-in beats. Voices processed to sound as inexpressive as robots. A warning, and an embrace, of technology as both the shaper and subject of songs, of the ever-growing human codependence with the inhuman. In 21st-century art, especially music, these ideas and sounds are inescapable.\n\nRalf Hütter and Florian Schneider, the German musicians at the core of Kraftwerk, were already committed to those concepts way back in the analog 1970s, when synthesizers were primitive and the idea of a pop group as a “man-machine” was revolutionary. (The original German, “Die Mensch-Maschine,” isn’t gendered; it means “Human-Machine.”) In an era of plush FM-radio pop, disco sensuality and punk rawness, Kraftwerk’s music was mechanical and coolly austere instead. Meanwhile, their songs sensed the coming digital era: impassive and heartless, but also seductive in its precision and possibility.\n\nIndirectly and directly, Kraftwerk’s music would quickly provide templates for popular music to come. Its songs showed the way toward synth-pop, electropop, techno and countless varieties of electronic dance music. And Kraftwerk’s crisp, flat electronic drum sounds and the synthesizer line of “Trans-Europe Express” were picked up by Afrika Bambaataa for his 1982 “Planet Rock,” a cornerstone single in hip-hop’s discography."
