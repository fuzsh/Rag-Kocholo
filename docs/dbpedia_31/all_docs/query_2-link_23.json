        "text": "Artists in the electronic music community are turning to social media, following the Wednesday (May 6) news of Florian Schneider’s death, to mourn the loss of the Kraftwerk founder.\n\n“Farewell to the extraordinary Florian Schneider (1947-2020) of @kraftwerk – the man machine lives on through an astonishingly original back catalogue of inspirational music,” Scanner tweeted alongside a black-and-white photo of the electronic pioneer, while Midge Ure declared Schneider “way ahead of his time.”\n\nWhile the German-born musician founded Kraftwerk in 1970 with collaborator Ralf Hütter, the group’s music would go on to inspire artists for decades, including the late David Bowie, who named instrumental track “V-2 Schneider” from his classic 1977 album “Heroes” after Schneider.\n\nCheck out more tributes to the late artist below."
