Different employees from our New York & Paris office take turns being the DJ for the day and sometimes explore a specific theme. Like Hawaiian Reggae or only songs with a name in the title.\n\nSadly some days are whole sets of music from those that have died during the last few months. We've paid tribute to Adam Schlesinger and John Prine.\n\nToday we will explore the music and influence of my favorite band, Kraftwerk. Florian Schneider passed away last week and as a founding member of such a distinguished group, it was a tremendous loss. I was lucky to see him perform with Kraftwerk the day before my birthday in 2004 at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle.\n\nThe show will begin streaming at 12pm EDT (6pm CEST). You can listen here through a web browser."
