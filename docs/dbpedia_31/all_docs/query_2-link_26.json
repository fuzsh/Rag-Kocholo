        "text": "Kraftwerk co-founder Florian Schneider (1947 – 2020) has died at the age of 73.\n\nIn 1970, Schneider and Ralf Hütter founded Kraftwerk in in Düsseldorf, Germany.\n\nIn its early days, the group’s music was part of Germany’s so-called Krautrock movement of experimental rock. Their lineup fluctuated, with Hütter & Schneider as the core.\n\nHere’s an example of Kraftwerk performing live in 1970:\n\nBetween 1970 and 1973, they released three albums, Kraftwerk 1, Kraftwerk 2 and Ralf & Florian. During this time, the band began to forge a new sound, distancing themselves from a rock format and introducing more electronics.\n\nHere’s a live performance on Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen from 1973, featuring Schneider, Hütter on keyboards and Wolfgang Flür on electronic percussion:\n\nBy 1974, Kraftwerk had defined their identity and sound. That year, they released Autobahn, which featured the synths, vocoded vocals and themes that would dominate their music going forward.\n\nThe 22+ minute title track is a paean to Germany’s Autobahn highway system, describing through lyrics and music the joy and freedom of a road trip on the modern roadway:\n\n“Wir fahren, fahren, fahren auf der Autobahn\n\nWe drive, drive, drive on the highway\n\nAutobahn sounded like nothing on the radio, at the time, and became an international success, reaching #25 on the Billboard Top 100.\n\nThe success of Kraftwerk’s Autobahn was made possible through the contributions of producer Conny Plank, who is arguably the band’s George Martin, and audio-visual artist Emil Shult, who contributed lyrics, artwork and concepts.\n\nHere’s a live performance of Autobahn from 1975, on The Midnight Special:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A3jjuCfc5U\n\nSchneider was a member of Kraftwerk through 2008, and helped create the band’s most important albums, includiung Radio-Activity, Trans-Europe Express & The Man-Machine. While the band’s chart success peaked in 1970’s, the late 70’s and early 80’s were arguably their most creative period, and their music from this time period helped spawn whole genres of music, from synth pop to electro.\n\nAfter Schneider left the group, Kraftwerk continued to perform, but their musical output has focused primarily on remixing their earlier work. Here’s the group’s updated take on Autobahn, as performed live in the group’s 3D shows:\n\nSchneider leaves behind a rich legacy of music that has influenced generations of musicians."
