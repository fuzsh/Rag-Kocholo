        "text": "by Kraftwerk Recorded 1983-2003 Released 4 August 2003 Label Kling Klang\n\nEMI\n\nAstralwerks Producer Ralf Hütter\n\nFlorian Schneider Length 55:57 Wikipedia\n\nTour de France Soundtracks (re-released in 2009 as Tour de France) is the tenth studio album by Kraftwerk, released in August 2003. themed around the annual French Tour de France bicycle race, and bicycling in general.\n\nThe album was recorded for the 100th anniversary of the first Tour de France bicycle race, although it missed its intended release date for the actual tour. It includes a new recording of their 1983 single of the same name, the cover artwork of both releases being nearly identical. The announcement of the release caused much anticipation, as it had been 17 years since the group had put out a full album of new studio material (1986's Electric Café, also known as Techno Pop).\n\nUnusually for a Kraftwerk album it did not have separate German and international vocal mixes, but was released only in one version, with a mix of French, German and English. The lyrics were co-written by Ralf Hütter and Maxime Schmitt, who had previously been manager of the Capitol label at Pathé-Marconi (part of the EMI group, the company that distributed Kraftwerk's music in France) and had been involved with the band since the mid-1970s.\n\nA short jingle was supplied to the television broadcaster Eurosport for use in their coverage of the 2003 Tour de France.\n\nTrack listing[]"
