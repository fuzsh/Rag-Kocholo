The Guardian reports that he had been diagnosed with cancer.\n\nKraftwerk, who started out as part of the experimental krautrock movement in Germany, went on to become one of the first groups to popularise the electronic music genre.\n\nSchneider remained a member of the band up until 2008.\n\nDavid Bowie’s track “V-2 Schneider”, featured on his 1977 album Heroes, was named after the multi-instrumentalist, who could play – among other things – the flute, guitar, saxophone and synthesiser.\n\nSpeaking in 1991, Schneider said in a rare interview: “I had studied seriously up to a certain level, then I found it boring; I looked for other things, I found that the flute was too limiting ... Soon I bought a microphone, then loudspeakers, then an echo, then a synthesiser. Much later I threw the flute away; it was a sort of process.”\n\nCulture stars we lost in 2020\n\nShow all 93\n\nMuch of what Schneider got up to following his departure from the group is unknown, but Hütter told The Guardian that “[he] worked for many, many years on other projects: speech synthesis, and things like that”.\n\nIn 2015, Schneider released an electronic composition titled “Stop Plastic Pollution” alongside Dan Lacksman as part of the “Parley for the Oceans” campaign.\n\nSpandau Ballet’s Gary Kemp joined musicians around the world who paid tribute to Schneider, tweeting: “Such an important influence upon so much of the music we know, from Bowie, to electronica, much of the 80s and beyond into modern techno and rap, Florian Schneider was forging a new Metropolis of music for us all to live in.”\n\nOrchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark wrote on Twitter: “We are absolutely devastated to learn that one of our heroes Florian Schneider has passed away.”\n\nAnd singer Lloyd Cole added: “The very best electropop, ever. RIP Florian.”\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
