        "text": "Kraftwerk founder Florian Schneider had died from cancer at the age of 73.\n\nThe German star founded the highly influential electronic group in 1970 with Ralf Hütter two years after meeting at the Academy of Arts in Remscheid.\n\nSchneider played the flute, violin and guitar, usually processed through electronic equipment.\n\nHe later said: “I found that the flute was too limiting.\n\n“Soon I bought a microphone, then loudspeakers, then an echo, then a synthesiser. Much later I threw the flute away; it was a sort of process.”\n\nThe band’s breakthrough came with their fourth album Autobahn in 1974, which hit the US and UK charts.\n\nThis was followed by Radio-Activity, which saw the band invited to tour with David Bowie – an invite they declined.\n\nKraftwerk proceeded to release the iconic record Trans-Europe Express, followed by The Man-Machine and Computer World – the former featuring the single The Model, which hit number one in the UK and became their most commercial song.\n\nThey described their music as \"industrielle volksmusik,\" which David Bowie translated as industrial folk music.\n\nAfrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force sampled Kraftwerk for one of the earliest hip-hop hits, Planet Rock, while Computer World had a huge impact on the house and techno music that emerged from Chicago and Detroit that decade.\n\nBowie later paid homage to Schneider with his track V-2 Schneider on his \"Heroes\" album, which was partly recorded in Berlin while The Thin White Duke was living there.\n\nSchenider remained part of the group up until 2008, when he didn't feature in the line-up when Kraftwerk played Coachella and a string of dates across the US and Europe, with video technician Stefan Pfaffe joining Hütter, Henning Schmitz and Fritz Hilpert.\n\nSchneider said that he was working on different projects, and the following year, it was confirmed that he had left the band, with Pfaffe taking his place permanently.\n\nKraftwerk continued to tour, and planned to kick off their 50th anniversary tour in February, but this was postponed until 2021 due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIn 2015, Schneider released a new piece of music, Stop Plastic Pollution, in collaboration with producer Dan Lacksman.\n\nTributes have been pouring in for the iconic musician.\n\nOrchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, said they were “absolutely devastated” and that he was one of their heroes.\n\nUltravox’s Midge Ure said he was “way ahead of his time”, while producer Thomas Dolby said: “Another of my great heroes gone.”\n\nFranz Ferdinand’s Alex Kapranos remembered both Schneider and The Stranglers’ Dave Greenfield, who also died this week, tweeting: \"Sad to hear about Florian Schneider and Dave Greenfield. Two big inspirations in my life.\""
