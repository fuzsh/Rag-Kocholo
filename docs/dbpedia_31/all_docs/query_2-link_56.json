        "text": "Born in 1947, Schneider was the son of Paul Schneider-Esbelen, a noted architect who designed Cologne's airport. Schneider first played music in various groups while studying in DÃ¼sseldorf, beginning in a band called Pissoff. Operating in the experimental, open-minded rock scene dubbed \"krautrock\" in the British press, he formed the group Organisation with Ralf Hutter, the pair later forming Kraftwerk in 1970.\n\nSchneider played the flute, violin and guitar, though often filtered through electronic processing. His interest in electronic music grew. \"I found that the flute was too limiting,\" he later said. \"Soon I bought a microphone, then loudspeakers, then an echo, then a synthesiser. Much later I threw the flute away; it was a sort of process.\""
