sky Calling out your name In the morning sun Off to Mechelen Waiting for the train Journey starts again We all love the view Mountains far and wide Walking in the fields In the countryside People all around Photographic scene Landmarks show the way This could be a dream To the Promised Land Nothing left to say Now we head for home We're so far away Music & Lyrics by KRAFTman\n\n2.\n\nAtomkraft

From bygone days Then when you moved, you walked towards me A distant shadow in the light Your cigarette was burning brightly And now you're almost out of sight Time waits for no one Watch the daylight fade I saw his dim lit features We can't erase Then when you moved, you walked towards me A distant shadow in the light Your cigarette was burning brightly And now you're almost out of sight Music & Lyrics by KRAFTman\n\n4.\n\nGamma Rays 04:53\n\nGamma rays Are the most energetic form Of electromagnetic radiation Gamma radiation Is the product of radio-active atoms Gamma radiation Is one

KRAFTman\n\n5.\n\nCall Me Up 03:18\n\nCall me up and talk to me On the line, on the line Call me up and turn the dial Make the call Make the call Re-connect and talk to me On the line, on the line Re-connect and dial again Talk all night Talk all night Call me up and talk to me On the line, on the line Call me up and turn the dial Make the call Make the call Music & Lyrics by
