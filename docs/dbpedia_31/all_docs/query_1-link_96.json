        "text": "Sad news when the ‘new’ generation moves on. What an important body of work to leave behind.\n\nI wonder what computer heaven looks like?\n\nGiving Computer World a spin, one can hardly find better examples of seminal sounds.\n\n.sjb\n\nMrs SinS told me about this evening… apparently died of cancer… a truly innovative musician that so many trance and EDM genres owe their existence to.\n\nI loved this from the Guardian obit: “Known for his enigmatic, somewhat faraway smile…”\n\nExcellent, innovative musician who lead the way for a number of electronic bands.\n\nWorth checking out the Schneider, Dinger, Rother version of Kraftwerk on YouTube. Not at all Autobahn\n\nHow sad - requiescat in pace, you dear man. Saw him with Kraftwerk live at the Manchester Apollo in 91. The robots malfunctioned but the humans worked fine.\n\nSuggestions please for your favourite Schneider composer credit (did he have any solo composer credits?). I need a playlist for tomorrow and that’s as good a criterion as any.\n\nMark\n\nCan anyone suggest one or two Kraftwerk albums for me to taste. I have heard the well known singles I guess but never an album\n\nCheers Bruce\n\nI’d suggest starting with The Man Machine and then Electric Cafe for something a bit more mainstream or Radio Activity for something a bit more avant-garde even if just for the hook on the title track alone\n\nBruce, Technopop from 1983 is a great album , especially the first 3 tracks.\n\nEarly Kraftwerk and later Kraftwerk are rather different.\n\nEarly highlights are: Radioactivity (Radio-Aktivitaet) and Autobahn and later highlights: The Man Machine.\n\nThe very early Kraftwerk is the most experimental, and possibly my favourite era, albeit possibly the least accessible. There are three albums to look for Kraftwerk, Kraftwerk2 and Ralf and Florian\n\nRadio 3 currently playing a cover of The Model (played by the Balanescu (string) Quartet) which is wonderful.\n\nThen they’re playing Transistor from Radio-activity. So that’s your highbrow Kraftwerk playlist!\n\nMark\n\nHere’s what I’ve been able to work out in terms of Florian’s composer credits, one album at a time (not including The Mix and Minimum-Maximum):\n\nAll tracks on Autobahn\n\nAll tracks on Radioactivity\n\nTrans-Europe Express: Europe Endless and Hall of Mirrors\n\nThe Man Machine: Neon Lights, The Robots and Metropolis\n\nComputer World: Numbers, Computer World, It’s More Fun to Compute and Home Computer\n\nAll tracks on Techno Pop / Electric Cafe\n\nTour de France Soundtracks: all tracks except Vitamin, Elektro Kardiogramm, La Forme and Regeneration\n\nAnd Expo 2000 (later retitled Planet of Visions, for example on Minimum-Maximum) if you want to be really completist about it.\n\nFollowing Radio 3 this morning, I’m enjoying the Balanescu Quartet’s other Kraftwerk covers - they did five on their album Possessed (1992, but resissued more recently and available on Spotify). The way they emulate the synth effects at the start of Robots is excellent.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nMark\n\nThe cover of Hall of Mirrors by Siouxsie & The Banshees is great; it captures the essence of the original but still sounds unmistakably of SATB. Ralf Hutter said as much\n\nRalf Hütter of Kraftwerk lauded the version of “Hall of Mirrors” and stated: “In general, we consider cover versions as an appreciation of our work. The version of ‘Hall of Mirrors’ by Siouxsie and the Banshees is extraordinary”\n\nFor Bruce’s benefit, Techno Pop is basically a re-issue of Electric Cafe with an extra track “House Phone” included. Qobuz and Tidal only list Techno Pop, not Electric Cafe\n\nHad no idea when I was break dancing as a teenager to the likes of Afrika Bambaataa and others way back that I was listening to music inspired by Kraftwerk.\n\nR.I.P. Florian\n\nOn a slightly off topic note, any opinions on whether you’d buy the remaster or original Trans Europe Express on vinyl?\n\nCheers, Rack.\n\nI’d go for the live album Minimum Maximum. It has stuff from all the albums I believe and the performances and sound quality are stunning. Radioactivity is truly outstanding.\n\n@BruceW the albums to go for are two from their 1970s peak, Trans-Europe Express (1977) and The Man-Machine (1978)\n\nThen I’d go for the underrated Radio-Activity (1975) and the tone poem Autobahn (1974). Computer-world (1981) fifth, the last time they were pushing any boundaries. By the end of 1981, they were starting to get left behind by the likes of YMO and even New Order and the Cabs. Electric Café in 1986 was a bit of a disappointment, and 2003’s Tour de France Soundtracks is a bit dull and would be better at half the length. 1991’s digitally-remade hits album The Mix is crap – everything on it is inferior to the original.\n\nKraftwerk are essentially a 1970s analogue band, and their true legacy lies between the years 1973 and 1981. Thereafter it’s all rehashes and the law of diminishing returns sets in. The live albums Minimum-Maximum and Der Katalog are OK, but you’re better off exploring the five studio albums between '74 and '81.\n\nThe original. The remasters are rubbish. Very “digital” and harsh."
