        "text": "\"Die Stimme Der Energie\" > Werner Meyer-Eppler - The Voice Of Power\n\nThis is my favourite find - the original of the track \"The Voice Of Energy\" from the 1975 \"Radio-Activity\" album.\n\nBecause although it is credited to Hütter & Schneider, it actually is a cover version of a recording by German physicist, experimental acoustician, phoneticist and information theorist Werner Meyer-Eppler. Check out his wikipedia entry, it's fascinating - he researched in the 1940s what 3 decades later Kraftwerk had perfected: \"In 1949, Meyer-Eppler published a book promoting the idea of producing music by purely electronic means\" (Werner Meyer-Eppler - Wikipedia ).\n\nHis recording of \"The Voice Of Power\" can be found on a CD that came with the book \"Wie die elektronische Musik 'erfunden' wurde: Quellenstudie zu Werner Meyer-Epplers musikalischem Entwurf zwischen 1949 und 1953\", Mainz u. a. 1992, by Elena S. Ungeheuer.\n\nWhen searching for the book I was super lucky as it was available in the small library of a music school near my flat; and the kind person responsible for the library allowed me to take the CD home for an hour and make a copy.\n\nSo here you can listen to it - the original recording of \"The Voice Of Power\" by Werner Meyer-Eppler, recorded some time between 1949-1953:\n\nWerner Meyer-Eppler - The Voice Of Power : Werner Meyer-Eppler : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive\n\nFlorian Schneider would have very likely known about Meyer-Eppler as he was studying Vocoders and voice synthesis.\n\nHere's a good write-up about it: Aktivitaet Online - Archive - General articles - The Golden Age of Radio\n\nA recently unearthed live recording from 1975 with the referenced medley of \"The Voice of Energy / Die Sonne, Der Mond, Die Sterne\" can be heard here:\n\nIt's well known that Hütter & Schneider for the last 40+ years have chosen to pretty much ignore their first three albums that were released between 1970 and 1973, before \"Autobahn\" - they have been out of print forever (the last legal vinyl reissues are from 1979 and 1980 respectively), have never been remastered and never been released on CD.\n\nWhat hardly anyone knows is that there is an even earlier recording by Hütter and Schneider under the name \"Kraftwerk\":\n\na soundtrack that was recorded in 1969, for an art video called \"Life/Death\" by the German artist Katharina Sieverding. It's one long piece of music lasting for the duration of the film, just under 50 minutes. The film itself consists of stills only and has no dialogue.\n\nInterestingly it seems to have been recorded before the \"Tone Float\" album by Organisation (the band Hütter & Schneider were in before Kraftwerk) which was released in 1970 - although the Tone Float cover gives no indication as to when it actually was recorded.\n\nBut when you listen to the soundtrack it makes total sense to use the name \"Kraftwerk\" for it as it basically is an extended drone piece, reminding me of electronic static noises and generator hums that you would hear in power stations (which is the English translation for Kraftwerk of course).\n\nMakes me wonder if the name change after Organisation actually came from Hütter & Schneider realising the significance of the name for their stated musical goals while recording this soundtrack?\n\nAnyway, you can watch the film and listen to the soundtrack here:\n\nUbuWeb Film & Video: 40jahrevideokunst.de : Life-death / Katharina Sieverding (1969/2004, 50:00)\n\nSome more infos I found online about the video:\n\ncurated by Erik Schmidt artfilm I remain silent auf artnet\n\nhttps://chartwell.org.nz/assets/Projects/Adam-Art-Writing-Prize-/ChartwellWinner2008_Jamie.pdf\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00043079.2017.1265289\n\nThis where the 2004 DVD version of the video originates from:\n\n40jahrevideokunst.de - Teil 1\n\nI consider myself a major Kraftwerk fan and I'd never heard of this before, it's not mentioned in any of the literature I've read about Kraftwerk. Thanks for the links!\n\nVery interesting! Never heard of it before. Incidentally, Tone Float was recorded August 1969.\n\nIt seems the group were called Kraftwerk from the beginning, apparently changing their name at the instigation of RCA and then changing back to Kraftwerk after the LP bombed.\n\nThe bit about the cover I read in a Kraftwerk bio, can't remember which one. I think the starkness of the image appealed to them - and the black and white.\n\nThe count-in story seems pretty solid, I've read that in a lot of different places, stretching back a long time, and it's on Wikipedia - no guarantee that it's definitely true of course! Bands have been doing it forever but they hadn't generally recorded the count-in, which the Ramones did, in a way that seemed almost conceptual - which would certainly have appealed to Kraftwerk! I can also Kraftwerk liking the Ramones' identikit look, the anonymity of them all having the same surname, the repetition."
