        "text": "Florian Schneider formed the ground-breaking group 50 years ago\n\nFlorian Schneider, co-founder of hugely influential German electronic group Kraftwerk, has died of cancer. He was 73 years old.\n\nSchneider formed the group with Ralf HÃ¼tter in 1970, and their heavily synthesiser and drum machine-based music helped develop what we could come to know as electronic music.\n\nThe group's albums through the mid-late-1970s and early-1980s saw them refine their repetitive, mechanical sound, culminating in some of the most forward-thinking albums of the era.\n\nRecords like Trans-Europe Express (1977), The Man-Machine (1978) and Computer World (1981) are revered as classics to this day.\n\nWhile their unique records and their influence on the shape and sound of music is their most vital legacy, the band also had legitimate pop success. Their 1975 single 'Autobahn' reached the top 30 in Australia and the US, while 1982's 'The Model' saw them top the charts in the UK.\n\nYou can hear Kraftwerk's influence dotted throughout popular music. They helped draw the blueprint for the driving, pulsing, hypnotic, electronic music that is a staple of the now hugely popular modern electro sound.\n\nThey've also become a heavily sampled act in hip hop and beyond, with their recordings serving as notable contributions to hits from Afrika Bambaataa, Dr. Dre and Jay-Z and Coldplay, to name a scant few.\n\nAfter almost four decades with the band, Schneider left Kraftwerk in 2008. His last visit to Australia with Kraftwerk was in 2003 for the Big Day Out festival.\n\nAccording to The Guardian the musician, who rarely spoke in the press, passed away over a week ago and was buried privately.\n\nMusicians around the world have sent tributes to Schneider following news of his passing.
