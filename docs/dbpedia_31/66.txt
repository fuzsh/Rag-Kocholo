Florian Schneider, one of the founding members of the German electronic band Kraftwerk, has died from cancer at the age of 73, according to his record label.

With his bandmate Ralf Hütter, Schneider is credited with revolutionising modern pop music by shifting its production on to computers and puncturing the cult of the rock star with a robot-like and impersonal aesthetic. He was awarded a Grammy in 2014 for his contribution to the music industry.

As a conservatoire music student in the West German city of Düsseldorf in the 1960s, Schneider had revolted against what he regarded as the country’s sterile and US-dominated arts scene.
