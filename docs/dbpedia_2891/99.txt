Privilege Ibiza, a legendary beacon in the global nightlife scene, stands as an emblem of hedonism and marks the early days of the island’s clubbing notorious stories. Originally christened as Club San Rafael in 1978, and later Ku Club, it underwent several transformations before solidifying its identity as Privilege in 1993.

Nestled near the quaint village of Sant Rafael and in close proximity to the iconic Amnesia, Privilege Ibiza boasts the title of the world's largest nightclub institution, spanning a colossal 6,500 m² with an awe-inspiring capacity of 10,000 revelers.

The club's illustrious history is woven with tales of extravagant open-air parties that epitomized the spirit of Ibiza's nightlife culture. In its heyday during the 1980s, Privilege became synonymous with opulent soirées where guests indulged in fine dining, took refreshing dips in the pool, and danced beneath the stars to the live performances of music icons like Duran Duran, James Brown, and Spandau Ballet. Notably, it served as the backdrop for the iconic music video of Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballé's hit 'Barcelona', capturing the essence of the island's magnetic allure.

Privilege's allure extended beyond its dance floors, attracting a constellation of A-list celebrities including Madonna, Paris Hilton, and David Bowie, who sought refuge in its pulsating ambiance.

Over the years, the club has been a sanctuary for renowned DJs such as Armin Van Buuren, Carl Cox, and Jamie Jones, who have crafted unforgettable sonic journeys within its hallowed walls.

Despite facing the temporary closure in 2020 amidst the global pandemic, Privilege Ibiza remains poised to reclaim its throne in the vibrant landscape of Ibiza's nightlife. Speculation swirls regarding its future, with Grupo Matutes and The Night League emerging as potential custodians, hinting at a resurgence that promises to redefine clubbing history.

As the world eagerly awaits news of its triumphant return, Privilege Ibiza stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of revelry and musical exploration, destined to etch its name further into the annals of Ibiza's dance culture.
