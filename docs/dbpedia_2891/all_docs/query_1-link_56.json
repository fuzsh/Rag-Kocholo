        "text": "Carl Cox will be making the switch to Privilege Ibiza this summer for a new party — dubbed Pure Carl Cox — for two nights in July.\n\nKicking off on Tuesday 11th, Cox will be joined by Joseph Capriati, Jon Rundell, Eats Everything, Archie Hamilton, Hybrasil and more for the opening party.\n\nThe following week on the 18th, Cox will welcome Nicole Moudaber, The Martinez Brothers, Kerri Chandler, Nastia and more head to the While Isle for a full-blown stomper.\n\nSpeaking about moving to Privilege after such a long time at the now defunct Space Ibiza, Carl Cox said, \"We are giving Privilege the shake up it well and truly deserves. Awaking this beast from it’s slumber. It’s like a rebirth of the hedonistic days gone by with a multi roomed clubbing experience like no other on island.”\n\n2017 is a big year of change for Ibiza; Space is now gone having been replaced by the as-yet unproved Hï Ibiza, Defected returns to the White Isle to Eden, Eric Prydz has set up shop at Hï, whilst Sasha & Diggers have a new residency at a resurgent Privilege — so like we said, all change."
