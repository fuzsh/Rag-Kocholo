        "text": "We’ll be knocking the doors down to gain entry to the opening party at Privilege, the world’s biggest nightclub, on Friday 27th May because the luminous line-up has just been revealed.\n\nThe monstrously proportioned main room will be taking revellers in from midnight to dance under an ambush of confetti and smoke machines. In charge of the music will be a selection of in demand names in future house and EDM, including Spanish wunderkind Danny Avila, German-born producer Tujamo, chart topping Switzerland-based DJ and producer EDX, French mastermind Quentin Mosimann, Ibiza based house DJ B Jones and a live performance from vocalist Nalaya.\n\nOver in the glass windowed Vista Club will be the sunrise edition, where doors will open at 04:30 AM for a techno takeover. Headlining the sunrise-soaked session will be Iranian-American progressive house DJ and producer and one half of Deep Dish, Sharam, as well as Yaya, Luna, City Express, Deborah de Luca and Heath Holme.\n\nVista Blue will welcome in MATE, the artist collective formed by Ibiza resident DJs and producers, whose driving goal is to create fresh sounds for the underground music scene on the White Isle.\n\nStart your daily lunges today, because this mammoth 12-hour session won't be taking any prisoners - this is a survival of the fittest kind of scenario.\n\nTickets now on sale."
