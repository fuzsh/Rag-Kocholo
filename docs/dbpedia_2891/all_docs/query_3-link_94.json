        "text": "Yet again, Privilege will make history with the celebration of its 25th anniversary. The biggest club in the world, as noted by the Guinness Book of Records, will open its doors on the 25th of August to commemorate its international recognition as one of the best clubs in Ibiza, and amongst the best globally. Privilege gained its status, not only for its sheer capacity (up to 10,000 people), but also for the magnitude of its parties which are led by the most famous DJ´s on the clubbing scene.\n\nSince it´s opening in 1978, it´s safe to say that Privilege knows how to host a sensational party. From the famous party of Manumission in the times where the club was called ´Ku´, to the current parties of Resistance and SupermartXé– Privilege has proved that it never ceases to adapt to its fans.\n\nNow introducing a special party to celebrate its anniversary: Privilege seeks to introduce a new concept mixed with the origins of the club, for one night only. One principle goal of the club is to keep the traditions of Ibiza alive- creating an environment of acceptance and tolerance of different people. This goal will be met at the 25th anniversary through the elimination of VIP tickets and zones. The club aims to create a night reminiscent of the first parties hosted on the island in the 80´s– eliminating elitism and exclusivity but instead, channeling inclusivity.\n\nDj Kique Supermix, Dj Oliver, Nurai, and the live act of Nalaya will be taking charge of the multiple dance floors on this truly special occasion. Good music and a good time!"
