        "text": "While some of us are fans of cramped, sweaty, underground nightclubs, others prefer partying the evening away in one of the world’s monstrous mega spots, and nowhere does those quite as well as Ibiza.\n\nThe Spanish island known for its nightlife is home to Hï Ibiza, which was crowned the best nightclub in the world by DJ magazine this year. And now the party island is set to become home to not only the world’s best nightclub, but also the world’s biggest.\n\nThat’s because superclub Privilege, shuttered in 2020, is having a makeover ahead of a grand reopening.\n\nIt was first founded in the early ‘70s, and the walls of this place have done a little more than host pulsing clubnights. The likes of Kylie Minogue, Madonna, David Bowie and Tina Turner have all boogied away their nights here, and it was even the set of a Queen music video for their song ‘Barcelona’ with Montserrat Caballe.\n\nIn 1979, the club was acquired by footballer Jose Antonio Santamaria and was renamed Ku, becoming a renowned gay club, before changing owner again in 1995 and becoming Privilege.\n\nThe Spanish Government have reportedly money-gunned €8 million (£6.7 million) into some extensive restoration works since its closure four years ago, and the 6,500 square metre site – with a main room is about the size of an aircraft hanger – now has a staggering 15,000 capacity. That’s quite the party, eh?\n\nWhile we don’t yet know when this whopping space might reopen, it could be as early as 2025. Party people, stay tuned. Here are some other fantastic things to do in Ibiza in the meantime.\n\nDid you see that Greece is now using drones to crack down on sunbeds?\n\nPlus: This brand-new bar was just crowned the best in Asia."
