        "text": "Privilege is the biggest club of the entire world recorded by the Guiness Book of Records. It has a capacity of almost 10.000 people!\n\nIt’s amazing design and architecture is a “must see”. The main room, with the looks of an aircraft hangar, has a huge swimming pool at its centre with the DJ suspended above. Upstairs, you will find the VISTA Club with amazing views to the town, a perfect place to relax and take a small break of the party and crowd craziness.\n\nThe VIP table prices vary depending on the season, ongoing party, DJ, and location of the table. The VIP table prices at Privilege range from 250€ to 500€ per person or 1.500€ to 2.500€ for groups of 5 people.\n\nPrivilege’s most famous parties are Afterlife, IAMRICHBITCH, and Four Thirty Two."
