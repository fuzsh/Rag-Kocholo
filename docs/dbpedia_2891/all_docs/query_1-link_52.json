        "text": "Whoever said size doesn’t matter wasn’t trying to fit 10,000 excited clubbers into one Ibiza nightclub! Impossible to miss, the world’s largest club and that’s official, according to the Guinness Book of World Records Privilege, lights up like a giant space station on a hillside in San Rafael. With a fascinating Ibiza clubbing history, Privilege started as a simple community swimming pool (which still stands in the main room) back in the 70s, then in the 80s became the legendary Ku (hailed as the European Studio 54) attracting the island’s first hedonistic crowds and including guests like Freddie Mercury singing Barcelona and Grace Jones dancing naked in the rain. London label and party, Solid Grooves make a home in Privilege at Vista Club on Saturday nights promising to bring its hedonistic vibes to the glass house in Vista to create unforgettable sunrise sets and unreal moments as the sun begins to peak through Ibiza’s beautiful morning skies. Scattered around the venue there are 14 bars, two exclusive VIP zones on the upper levels, the legendary Coco Loco room and two open-air chill out areas; a magnificent garden atrium and an elevated lounge under the symbolic dome, with views to die for as the sun comes up. Sometimes, it seems, bigger really is better. Photography by Phrank"
