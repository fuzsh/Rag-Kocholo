        "text": "With an official capacity of 10,000, Privilege is a behemoth of a club.\n\nIt’s difficult to wrap your head around how big the place is, the main room feeling more akin to a warehouse / festival mainstage than any other club in Ibiza.\n\nStep inside and experience clubbing like nowhere else in the world.\n\nOn this page: History | Club Information | Privilege Ibiza 2020 | FAQs | Line Up 2020\n\nPrivilege Ibiza History\n\nThe venue where Privilege stands has a history that spans over 4 decades.\n\nBuilt in the 70’s, the venue was originally a restaurant, bar and pool area called Club San Rafael. Spanish footballer José Antonio Santamaría purchased the venue in 1979 and renamed it to Ku, after the name of a Hawaiian mythological god.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Ku became synonymous with the rise in popularity of clubbing in Ibiza, even hosting performances from the likes of Freddie Mercury, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, and Kid Creole and the Coconuts.\n\nIn 1995 ownership of the club changed to Jose Maria Etxaniz, when the venue was renamed again, this time to Privilege. During this period the club was best known for hosting Manumission, a UK party that found home at the venue and attracted clubbers all over the world for over 10 years until moving to Amnesia in 2007.\n\nSince this time, Privilege has struggled to attract parties large enough fill the venue week-in, week-out. However, that’s not to say the club doesn’t still have a lot to offer. A re-emergence in the last few years due to the likes of the highly popular RESISTANCE parties have proved that Privilege is firmly back on the clubbing map of Ibiza.\n\nClub Information\n\nPrivilege is the world’s largest nightclub by a considerable distance. It can hold 10,000 people and covers an area of 6,500 sq m. It is located toward the center of the island in San Rafael, under a mile away from Amnesia down the road.\n\nThe main room feels like a huge aircraft hanger, with a height of over 25m. It really is a sight to behold.\n\nBesides the gigantic main room, the Vista Club and Coco Loco areas offer three distinct places you can dance until the sun rises, and experience clubbing in Ibiza like nowhere else.\n\nPrivilege Ibiza uses a Funktion One soundsystem to fill its huge rooms.\n\n“Huge dance floors, the biggest dome you’ll ever sit under, and lots of ways to get lost!”\n\nPrivilege is usually busiest between 1-3am so plan your arrival time accordingly.\n\nThe best meeting point if you get lost from your friends is the gigantic dome at the top of the club.\n\nPrivilege Ibiza 2020\n\nThe music policy at Privilege varies greatly from night to night.\n\nYou can expect everything from the heavy hitting techno of RESISTANCE and the tech house of Solid Grooves and SuperMartXé, to the latin beats of Brutal Ibiza.\n\n2020 will see RESISTANCE return to Privilege once more, opening its doors every Tuesday from mid July until September.\n\nThere’ll be lots more announcements to come for Privilege Ibiza 2020, so watch this space.\n\n2019 Parties\n\nMonday: One Third\n\nTuesday: RESISTANCE\n\nWednesday: Manycome\n\nThursday: Do You Remember?\n\nFriday: SuperMartXé\n\nSaturday: Brutal Ibiza\n\nSunday: Solid Grooves\n\n2020 Parties\n\nMonday:\n\nTuesday: RESISTANCE\n\nWednesday:\n\nThursday:\n\nFriday:\n\nSaturday:\n\nSunday:\n\nPopular Privilege Parties\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"
