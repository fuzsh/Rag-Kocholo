        "text": "The world's biggest superclub Privilege in Ibiza has fallen into disrepair with overgrown bushes covering its entrance and grime smeared across its dilapidated facade after it was forced to close two years ago due to Covid.\n\nThe venue became famous as KU Club in the 1980s for its hedonistic open-air parties where guests could dine out, swim in a pool and dance the night away to live performances by Duran Duran, James Brown and Spandau Ballet.\n\nKU was also where Ibiza-loving Freddie Mercury and operatic soprano Montserrat Caballé recorded the music video for their 1987 hit Barcelona.\n\nNew laws later meant the club had to be roofed over, but that didn't stop up to 10,000 revellers packing into the massive hangar-style dancing mecca throughout the 1990s. The maximum capacities of other Ibiza big beasts, like Pacha with 3,000 and Amnesia with 5,000, shows just how mega Privelege's parties used to be.\n\nNow the party buses which once hauled thousands of revellers to its doors are lying covered in dust and graffiti outside and there are no plans to open until 2022.\n\nThe 70,000 sq ft venue's paint is peeling from some of the walls, metal has been left to rust in the sun and some of the spectacular statues which usually decorate the club, have been left to deteriorate outside.\n\nFor much of the summer, with cases of the highly-infectious Delta variant surging, nightclubs across the island have been closed, with dancing banned and face masks required indoors.\n\nOnly venues like cafes and bars are allowed to remain open, but they cannot sell alcohol after 10pm and there are fines of up to £4,300 for venues flouting the rules.\n\nIn late June, pilot events were held for up to 2,500 at Ibiza's Hard Rock Hotel, but then progress was dashed by a rise in infections across the Balearic Islands.\n\nOnly a handful of nightclubs are open for business, but they are not functioning as normal, with guests enjoying a cafe-style experience, seated at tables outdoors.\n\nAdding to its woes, Ibiza is on the UK's Amber travel list, meaning that may Britons are unwilling to risk travelling to the island as they must take a PCR test on return and, if they are unvacccinated, they face a 10-day quarantine.\n\nEach year thousands of young people gather to enjoy not only the hot weather and the beaches but also the array of clubs with international DJ's playing to vast audiences.\n\nIbiza has also gained a reputation for drugs and concerns are now growing that the taking and trafficking of drugs is spiralling out of control."
