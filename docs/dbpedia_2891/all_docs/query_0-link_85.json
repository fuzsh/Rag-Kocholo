        "text": "Ibiza’s Tourism Planning Commission has approved renovation funding for Privilege, which has been closed since 2019.\n\nEurope’s premiere party island may be adding yet another superclub back to its impressive roster. The Tourism Planning Commission of Ibiza has approved a €8.2 million renovation plan for Privilege, a legendary club in the San Antonio region of the island. This announcement has sparked speculation that the club, which hasn’t been open since 2019, may be set to reopen in 2024.\n\nPrivilege will install solar energy systems and improve water circulation through the building as part of the renovation. The funding is part of the local government’s initiative to rejuvenate tourist attractions across the island. Per Periódico de Ibiza y Formentera, hotel renovation projects of €13 and €3.1 million have also been approved in Ibiza in 2023 under this initiative.\n\nPrivilege had its license suspended in 2018 after it was discovered that the 10,000-capacity club had made illegal structural alterations to increase its capacity. It remained open for the 2019 season with a reduced capacity as multiple sections were closed off as unsafe, and has since been completely closed. Grupo Empresas Matutes, the parent company of the Palladium Hotel Group, acquired the club in 2022.\n\nThis announcement of renovation funding is not the first clue that Privilege may be planning to reopen its doors. Posts on the club’s Facebook page in 2022 hinted at the venue being under construction, and the club’s website added a ‘COMING SOON’ message in recent months. Still, there has been no official confirmation that the club will reopen, or when it may do so.\n\nEven with numerous other superclubs in San Antonio (Eden, Es Paradis) and nearby (Hi Ibiza, Ushuaia, Amnesia, Pacha), the return of the iconic Privilege would generate much excitement amongst Ibiza clubbers. Stay tuned for more information if and when the plan is made official.\n\nAbout The Author"
