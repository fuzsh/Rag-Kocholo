Everything is not always as it seems and he has learned the hard way that sometimes you only get one chance to make things right.\n\nThere was a huge part of her that wanted to take the bag and bury it somewhere deep in her closet because she knew however sweet or cute the mementos were inside of the bag, the tenderness she’d feel would quickly be replaced by the debilitating pain of his absence. It was almost easier being numb.\n\nBut…she missed him so much. And she’d felt like his memory was slipping away from her. And this…this bag could bring him back to her – even for a little while."
