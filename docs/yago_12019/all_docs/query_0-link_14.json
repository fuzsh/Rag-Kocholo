        "text": "The Carpenters\n\nHere it is! An extensive OLTL family tree that dates back to day one! With more than 30 years of history behind the show, the family ties are extremely tangled, as you'll see. Hopefully, this in-depth document will help sort it out. In the meantime, there are almost certainly some oversights. If you notice any errors or omissions, feel free to send me mail and tell me. The family tree has been updated and improved! It will also be easier to update as the tree branches out over time. To use the tree, simply follow the numbers that appear in parentheses beside characters' names. If you are looking for a specific character, check the index at the bottom of this document.
