I have two friends who take the tame amount We are afraid we can’t quit. I have a lot of headaches and am very ner¬ vous. — Hn. A. L. O. There’s a ^fferenee between addiotkn and habituation. You and your friends evidently are In ttie latter class. It isn’t a queadgn <d Whether you quit using these eapaulea, but whether you will.

Canadians Are £n,titled to All the Facts As Authorities Probe Continuing Disorder ''pHERE MAY BE a tendency among w^tem na- •E nation! to look with pity on Israers new prime minister-designate, Mra. Golda Melr, a little, old lady of 71 chosen to lead a people wholly surrounded by Arab enemies sworn to accomplishment of the destruction id the Jewish state. She may be seen as a fragile figure-4ier health has Icmg been poor—beset by problems heavier than her strength will bear. It would be a mistake. Physically she may not be robust, but she has a resilience and tenacity of character that make her as durable as the desert tamarisk. Israers enemies will not be misled. They know her for a fighter, a pioneer of 1921, who was in the fiont ranks of resistance to the British manfctt authority by 1946 and vtoo, with toe procUunation of nationhood, was named first mlnkiter to Moscow in 1948. She a^ved as minister of labor for seven yean from 1949, and her c<Hitiibutlon to toe develoidi^ stage was in the area of road-buUdirqK and chefg) boutoig, so vital at that time. In 1956, the little girl who onigrated from Kiev to toe United States with her parents at the age of el^t, who had tended her mother’s store and attended teadien' college In Wisconsin, was named foreign minliter. And fmr the next 10 years she personified her people*! imcmig r omlsing determination to survive agaM all odds. She la known as a moderate in her own country, Init that Is a relative term. Abroad she has been call^ a **lady hawk.” She has Mver been a confirmed believer In conciliation, although she has expressed the belief that war can provide no lasting solution to the dQemma ^ the MUdle East. In ahOTt, Mrs. Meir's assumption of the nation’s leadership is not likely to change the policy set by her predecessor!, that without a guaranteed peace there will be no Di^drawal from the occupied territories. But she mi^—and this is the hope—take tlw Initiative in same new approach to the problem. For the new prime minister Is a realist who appreciates the danger inherent in stalemate.

With Trftd* the Soviet I’nion as the guai-d- ian of Arab intareata in tha con¬ flict and has been qtit of har¬ mony with France since th^ 1967 war. Any proposal aupporl- ed by this hiilf of the foursome is bound by nature to encounter close Israeli scrutiny. ★ ★ ★ Aside from all that, the Israeli g 0 V e r nment apparently does not accept the widely-heid theo¬ ry that, as I^xon put it. the Middle East ir a \"powder keg\" that must he defused before it explodes into a confrontation that could draw in the nuclear powers. Israel puts great stock in the strategic value of the Arab land it conquered in the brief war. Although the Soviet Union has rebuilt Arab military forces to their pre-1967 strength, the Is¬ raelis apparently remain confi¬ dent—despite opinions to the contrary—that thejr neifthbors are not yet ready for another such adventure. In effect, Israel jgeems to be promoting a holding action to maintain the territory it won in the fighting. And there is little expectation of any change in policy through the selection of Golda Meir last week as prime minister to succeed the late Levi Esiikui. Mrs. Meir. 70. w-hoiu Eban succeeded as foreign minister, had given rocklike support to tlie policies of Eshkol through¬ out his term as the country's third prime minister.

Amid cautious optimism ttiat Big Four talks might resolve the Middle East ciisiB, it is al¬ ready clear that Israel remains highly skeptical that its inter¬ ests would be protected by the United States in any bugaining with the Kremlin. Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Kban, here to test the temper of the new Nixon admlnlstraUmi in relation to the Middle East, set the tone with his opening .re¬ mark that there could be \"noth¬ ing more absurd\" than the idea that the U.S., Soviet Union, Britain and France could im¬ pose a lasting paaoe. After a one-lMur meeting with State Secretary William Rogers By ROD CURRIE from WaAhmKtoii It was apparent that his stand had not changed substantially. * \"The four which should meet are Israel and its Arab neigh¬ bors\" —Egypt, Jordan and Syria; with whom it fought the six-day war of 1967. The Aralw have stoutly re¬ fused any such face-to-face ne¬ gotiations on the grounds they would at least imply recognition of the Jewish state in their midst, which they have held in a state of belligerence for more than 20 years. Throughout, tiw Israeli posi¬ tion has been that only through such direct talks could a perma¬ nent settlement be reach^. Part of Israel’s wariness re¬ garding President Nixon's sud¬ den enthusiasm for four-power talks is rooted in the events leading up to the U.S. decision. Nixon’s statement supporting such talks if they prove warrant¬ ed in preliminary bilateral talks, came after intensive Mid¬ dle East discussions with Presi¬ dent de Gaulle during Nixon’s European tour and after \"en¬ couraging\" discussions with S4> Viet officials here.

M. Rom, oI l^ui- caster Vnivenity, Eaglaad. The Mideast, agitated to begin with, has been stirred to further turmr^ by Washington advertising that It is woridng witii the other great powers to fotmuiate a new policy to¬ wards the area. For vrith notiee so abun¬ dantly served, all tbe active forces in this part of the world are working to influence the developing U.S. pi:dicy, or make adjustments around it. * * The moat obvioua case In point is Israel. TTie govern¬ ment there, supported to the hilt by the Johnson admlids- tratkn, inevitably fean a change under the Nixon ad- ministratkm. It .has been acting to prevent a new policy being fornuABted rapidly, and ki reaction to the policy of the Johnson regime. To that md tiie Israelis have repeatedly argued that present conditions ki the area ara not dangeroua end do not require any major new diplo¬ matic action by the great powers. They have already wn fn»n President Nixon a pledge, asserted almost exact¬ ly in words originally used by Foreign Minister Abba Eban, that there will be no ’'im¬ posed\" settlement ki toe Mideaet. And Mr. Eban is In the United States ttus week, {Mjshlng the theme even hasd- er. The eontrary kitore^ By JOSEPH KRAFT from Beinit asserts Itself In Cairo. The Lgyptians want a new policy with a drooling passion — especially one p»jt by toe United States in co-operation with C a 1 r 0 's friends in Moscow and Paris. According¬ ly. the regime of President Nasser is doing all it can to underline tl^ explosive character of present condi¬ tions and toe danger that will follow unless something is done by the great powers. * ★ * With that purpose, toe Eg3n>tians. over last weekend, started the ariillpry duel along the Suez Canal vtoich brought de«to to their chief of staff, General Abdel Nonefan Riad. For toe same putpose they converted the RIad funeral into a national martyrdom and instituhed an emergency blackout. It it it In Jordan, King Hussein is preparing for a trip to Wash¬ ington which he will be making in person next month. He will speH out there the kind of miUtary end economic assi.stance his fragile state would need in order to accept a aettiemenl. In toe meantime, he is giving a relatively ftree hand to tiie Palestine commandos who operate from Jordan against Israel. By not res¬ training their wariike acts, he whets Washington’s appetite f«r a settlement and raises the price toe U.S. is willing to pay for his acquiescence in new arrangements. * * * Even Syria, so kxig in seK- isolatkm, is coming out of its sheH. Until very recently, Syria was completely under the thumb of an extreme leftmng government. That regime was imposed upon the country by a military junta, grouped around General Salah Jeddid, and comprising officers rocning from a much- disliked Moalem minority — the AlMlte sect. ★ ★ ★ Recentiy a group of Akuite ofheers, grouped around Gen¬ eral Hafez Assad, haw been alarmed by the prospect of a Near settiement that would demonstrate that vic- ory had not been achieved over Israel. These officers feel that in the full liftot of the failure to crush Israel the Alouites might be exposed to peputar revenge, Accordingly, they are moving to brof^n the regime, and eventually to bring in some more repreo e n- tative Syrians to share wito the Alouites the Name for the bad times they fee) may be coming up. ITie cne thing lacking In all this — the thing that does not exist in Jerusalem, Cairo, Amntkn, cr Damascus — u a stnxig impulse towards settle- i ment. TTte fact Is that the ' governments cf toe Mideast, tipped off in advance by Washington' that something big is brewing, are doing everything possible, except taking steps towards peace. ★ ★ ★ In this situation, it to not likely toat a settlement, whether imposed or urdm- posed, is going to be arranged very soon. What is far more likely is that the Nixon administration, having started to formulate a policy for settlement. wiH not be able to finish the job. The result will probably be a new set hurt feelings among toe Arabs, which the Soviet Union is almost bound to exploit. And not for toe first time, an American regime would have helped its principal adversary in tois area by promising, far nKxe loudly than necessary, more than it could deliver — m would wisely want to deliver. The honest Canadian Alberta Premium Ho Pursins Communist Cadres Corruption Slows North They read lite quMtiona to a lonely-hcarts columnist, but the subject it Ufe and death. From Haiphong: \"Mine la an honored socialist labor unit, but some workers dls<^y regulations, even stealing factory goods ... I am afraid to say anything. Should I?\" From Hanoi itself: \"In enterprise, many leading cadres violate politics on material and goods, taking things for friends and relations . . . How can I speak out witinut being persecuted?\" The letters, selected from a recent iuue of North Viet¬ nam’s wldely-dreulated journal, Thol Su Pho Tung, may be deliberately planted, or tiwy may be true cries from the Bj ROBERT S. ELEGANT lErom Saigoa hesrt. In tltoer case, the pcublems th^ point up and the fears they diacloee are both real and pressing. Since toe total bombing halt last November, becoming ■trigent about the end of 196S, and still rising toward crescen¬ do. toe Democratic Republic of (North) Vietnam hat mounted an intensive campaign to purge its communist cadres, as well as its managen and workers, of widespread corruption, in¬ dolence, and deliberate slowdowns. T^e tendencies are severely affecting toe country’s economy. Instead of improvtog, those tendencies have become worw since the bomtdng hah and they are sdQ getting worse. Such la toe judgment of specialists on North \\netRam and the coochulon one draws fnxn reading a great mass of material from official communist pubUcations. AQ tiuse tendencies add up to two stark fecti for the eommunlsts: Loss of labor days ranging from 30 to SO per cent; agricultural, Industrial, mining, and forestry production amounting to only one-fifth to on^alt of what toe com¬ munists plan to achieve. Conditions Worsen TV direct factors producing those startling losses are manifold. Tb^ include: Bad management, widespread theft, a flourishing Uackmarkel, lack of effective central control, slowdowns to protest depressed living oondlttoos, low tech¬ nical itaodanb, and almost universal loafing on toe job. As specialists see the phenomenon, it stems' directly from ths war the Norlfa is still pressing to conquer South Vietnam. Having been told they have \"won a tremendous victory over American aggreaton\" by forcing the bombing halt on the Uidted States, toe people of North Vietnam are finding con¬ ditions certainly no better than tiwy were before the \"vic¬ tory\" and, In many eases, even worse. The gnndtosely-acelaimed victorsr has, to far, borne little but tAtto* fruit fer the masses of toe North. They are, at least, free of bombing attacks, but toe tiireat remains—indeed. Is strenuously kept green by the regime's cxgans of propa¬ ganda. TTiat emitoasis is deliberate policy, tor the peofde of the North would like to pluck tite ^ts of victory by relaxing the constant tension ^ their daily life. Only by maintaining the tension, the government aj^ears to feel, can it secure the dedica^ labor it needs, not only to reatmw its shattered ecastemic machinery, but merely to keep tha prevent ma- ehlneiy turning over. The greatest tingle factor appears to be vaat popular dissillusionment. H is extremely disturbing to toe regime, though not an immediate or grave danger. Despite toe initial \"victoiy,\" the people of toe North find themselvea still deprived of all but the bare necesaitiet of life. Moreover, young men still go forth by the tens of thous¬ ands to \"liberate\" toe South. Pew return. The preBsures on the peojAe Intensify. But there are no bombers—no visible enemy to unite them. Despite all Hanen's propaganda efftsls, the war in toe South appears remote and interminable to men and women interest^ primarily In titeir own well-being. The ‘'sacred mis¬ sion of liberating our brethren in the South” is an unattractive abstraction. Even from the official point of view, toe continuing strain of the war dally increases tiw country’s dependence on its fickle allies, the Soviet Union and Communist China. Hanoi depeiuls upon those feuding natlcm not only for arms and the capita! equipment essential to reconstruction, but for simrde daily necessities like food and clothing. Sabotage Deliberate Other major Eactex's also have come into play, including deliberate sabotage, as disclosed in the technical journal El¬ ectric Power Techitology In an article by tbe chief of toe country’s bureau for eleoteic power production. ' \"The enforcement of labor disdpline in our sector has had more deficiencies than good points,\" he wrote, \"since the American bandikB were defeated . . . and unconditionally 8to{^>ed bombing. Rules and regulations on technical man¬ agement and work systems hake not been strictly enforced; safety measures have been disregarded; there have been linduly prolonged delays; machinery has been ruined, and many serious accidents have occured.\" Aside from making lying a universal habit, the new trend in the North has also pswiuced widespread corruption. The black market thrives, as does clandestine private production, while state prt^ierty is diverted not only directly, but also by forging raticai stamps, receipt botAcs, and delivery certifi¬ cates. Those, toen, are the reasons for toe desperate tone of (he letten to the magazine. But the journal itself adduces ollwrs, as well: ’ Economy Affected \"We admit tiw war has caused tiie market in' the North to talte on new characteristics, but that does not explain why slate goods can be stolen and sedd on tiie free (black) market . . . The principle reasons are deficiencies in management.\" The admission toat the total impact of war on a small, underdeveloped country has severely and adversely af¬ fected its economy is remaikabie only because It is so tar from the eommurtiits’ usual style. But toe concomitant admissim of major deficiencies rwt only among wodrkers and managers, but among 'Tead^’toip cadres\" demonstrates a most significant decay of both morale and communist party discipline. By Hanoi’s own* account, the cumulative problems pro¬ duced by bombing and the drain of tha war in the south are still mounting. Why do wc call Alberta Premium The Honest Canadian?
