Petticoat enjoyed a six-month run in London last year. It would be a pleasure to report the likelihood o.' a similar or longer stay here at the Booth. However. Petticoat's premise, while it may be clearly acceptable from a British point of view, is not one to cause more than a ripple of excitement over here. Aimec Stuart's little tragic-comedy con- cerns Itself with caste and snob- bery in Scotland (circa 1890). Its chief protagonists are two youngs- ters, one the daughter of the manor, the other the daughter of a widowed milliner. The children conceive a violent affection for one another despite the conviction of the \\stdow and a dour grandmother that no good can come of it It doesr.'t. In the final an^ysis, caste rears its ugly head, and the result is near tragedy The little villaj.;er discovers that lace on her petticoat is no ticket of admi&sion to the halls of the mighty.

The hand.<«me young widow and her mother look askance at the courtship of a young, liberal-minded dock-work- er, who drinks tea with his spoon in his cup. nor do they want their daughter to play with his niece, because the latter has dirty hair. But the near-tragedy causes an all-round change of heart, and at curtain-fall the liberal lad is carrying them all off to Canada, where presumably everybody gets an even social break. Mrs. Stuart is a Writer of per- ception, with a Barrie-esque touch for making little things sensitively important. While a play of this type is necessarily static and talky. many of the scenes between the youngsters are delightful, and Scottish humor does much to leaven the 9enltmental little laic via the adults. Siklondkl Caat-Wi«e Cast-wise, Shumlin's selections are splendid. The children — and Petticoat is primarily their show — are excellently played by Perlita Neilson and Patsy Brudor; Little Miss Neilson, who played the young lady of the castle in the British version, repeats here as ili ■ to the manner born She has - the makings of an exeeptiofL young actre!^ Muriel Aked, like- wise of the West End troupe, adds helpfully as the stiff-nocked grandmother.

Sept. 8 — Broadcasting got a rather ~?rinti chuckle out of the Acknou'ledfiev}rnls in the third Association of National Advertisers study. Impact of Television on Radio Listen- ing. Notwithstanding the fact that the ANA intends the re- port as a .serious stud.v to guide country's largest adver- tisers in their spending of literallv millions of dollars in radio, TV and olher media, the Ackrioxftcdgewent indi- cates that the AN.\\ spent about $1 on statistical re- search for the study. It says: \"... Grateful ac- knowledgement is hereby ac- corded to C. E. Hooper, who has been very generous in provifling, as a riollar-a-year consultant, copyrighted data showing share of audience in TV cities.\" It further states: \". . - Nielsen's offer to permit, publication of up-to-date in- formation in this report, was on a financial basis whicl^ precluded its acceptance.\" the Billboard-Nieliicn story on rating, which- formed a; major part of the study, didn't cost the ANA a dime either. and 1951, in the 38 TV cities for which comparative Hooper fie- ures are available.

Li*tfniny Cost data like those in the two previous reports are not shown in this one becau.se recent cost ad- justments make the same type of computation impractical. Other- wise the .same method is followed for estimating declines in evening radio listening — using for illus- trative purposes the stations in TV cities affiliated with NBC and CBS The estimates in this case are as, of October 1. 1951. For the individual stations af- fected by television competition, the decline when measured in this way runs from 5 per cent to 71 per cent. Composite figures for net- works like those given previously are not practicable in this report. Upped Agency % Real Threat NEW YORK Sept. 8.— While it has been largely ignored by the broadcasting industry, some radio men feel that another economic pinch may soon face them in the plans currently being considered by a special committee of the I American Assoiiation of Advertis- ing Agencies to request all media ' to raiise agency commissions to 17.5 per cent from the long-stand- ing 15 per cent. While the 2.5 per cent increase seems rather small, broadcasters feel that such an additional bite Into their net via agency commis- sions would .simply make the job of showing a net profit, with ris- ing costs and lower gross intome, just that much more difficult. I ANA Target Is Evening Time, Mutual Is Okay NEW YORK, Sept. 8.— WhUe many broadcasters belie^'e that the new .Association of National Ad- vertisers study. \"Impact tif Tele- vision on Rndio Listening,\" is an indication that all radio rates are again in jeopardy, most observers feel that the big rate cut threat exists specifically in connection with prime evening time — and that primarily in major markets where TV has had, and figures to continue to have, its most rapid growth.

THE CBS RADIO NETWORK TELEVISION-RADIO THE BILLBOARD SEPTEMBER IS. 1951 SEEK LEVENSON SLOT CBS Juggles Schedules To Stiffen Fall Line-Up NEW YORK. Sepl. 8— The Co- lumbia Broadcasting System this week moved on two fronts to strengthen its fall video program- ing line-up. The network is at- tempting to move the Sylvania sponsored Beot the Clock out of the Saturday 7:30-8 p.m. slot for Sam Levenson and an unidentified client and to get Johnson's Wax to replace its alternate week Star- light Theater, Thursday 8-8:30, with something more productive of better ratings, presumably comedy. CBS-TV believes that the dra- matic stanza hasn't the televiewing vitamins to create continuous weekly audiences for Bums nnd ylllen with which it splits the time slot. If this evaluation is correct. Starlight Theater also must dam- age Amos 'n' Andu which follows it twice a month. Both Burns and Allen and Amos 'n' Andy are among the most expensive pack- ages the web has and cost well over 30G weekly. The network therefore is pitch- ing a Garry Moore nighttime show at Johnson's. Moore, because of his strong da.vtime click, might find favor with the bankroller and could be bought at a right price. Slotting Levenson on Saturday evening.s before Ken Murray would enhance the CBS-TV line-up for that evening when the National Broadcasting Company tires some of its biggest programing guns. The web. too, is under terrific pressure to find a slot for Leven- son for two reasons; His large weekly stipend, play or pay and the overtures that NBC-TV has made toward the humorist. In the event, however, that Syl- vania cannot be budged, trade re- ports are that CBS-TV will at- tempt to pressure Johnson's into buymg Levenson or else pre-empt the time for a client who can af- ford him. This would jack the web off the Levenson hook and bul- wark its Thursday evening pro- graming Tf,??rL'^^'^^' ^ Multi-Mil Billings in TUESDAYWINNER r r- I Middle of Firm Deals NEWIfORK.

Here are. the facts: Assuming that television owners never listen to radio, bear in mind that increases in Detroit popula- tion and trading area have com- bined to give WWJ 96% coverage of the number of families it had m 1940. When you take into consid- eration the shrinkage of the dollar since then, present rales enable you to buy the WWJ market today for substantially less per thousand than you could in 1940.* That's why advertisers in the Detroit market choose WWJ and Its big exclusive radio audience. *ortragt WWJ /am.f.ci. 1940 931. 92J TV fomidei.- )950 501,000 •acluurr radio lomilitt, 1950 996,300 FIRST IN DITROIT Owiied onJ Ov\"^'d kr THE DfTHOri NEWS NolioM./ ».p,«..l«.v..

Script punched a bit too hard at times for gag best fiiM-hour programs to be seen - Public Prosecutor Is a video laughs, but over-nil plotting sal- version of the old radio mystery vaged most of the good naturcd drama game, in which a group of satire and authentic teen-age guests and radio listeners wore completely superior in script invited to test their ability as a adaptation, acting and direction. It combined the sort of approach which can really put TV drama- tic fare on the competitive map. Following its past format, the yarn was introed by author M tiiiili.HTi. giving just enough i.ni km -hnd to set the mood and Tlu' |>*M lod. This time it was based on one of his satirical, little Parisian comedies of man- ners, called Appearance ond Renl- t'ry. It concerns a philandering senator, hag-ridden by a pair of spinster sinislers. who buys him- self a young mannequin for a mis- tress, only to lose her to hi? own more youthful secretary He makes a deal with (he lady to further her husband's foreign diplomatic career, while she is to stay in Paris and permit him to continue his happy role of pre- lector The gal outsmarts him via the connivance of his sisters, and the elderly goat is left holding the bag.

Rita Gam, hitherto un- known to this reporter, was superlative as the not-so-dumb lamb to his wolf. The scene in which she modestly accepts his proposition added up to real high comedy on the part of both. Ross Martin acquitted himself excel- lently as the youthful winner in the love sweepstakes, and there were outstanding character bits from Cavada Humphrey and Adele Klein as the senator's dot- ing sisters. It must be reported, however, that such a fine program as this was sadly marred by a top-heavy overdose of lengthy commercials. Tinlair has been guilty of this in the past, and it is about time that somebody in charge caught on that .ihcer length makes fur any- thing but selling impact, No less than four wordy plugs were In- chidpft in the seg, much of which was svifficiently repetitious to ar- rive al a saturation point of viewer irritation.
