Later, she returned to play Sam in 2021, and once again in January of 2024. Taking to her Instagram Story, Hartley wrote, “Grateful to be stepping in again.” She was pictured in a photo from the funeral of Molly (Kristen Vaganos) and TJ’s (Tajh Bellow) baby alongside her on-screen mother, Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis) and also Kristina played by Kate Mansi.\n\nThe timing of Kelly’s temporary exit comes at a pivotal time for the character as her man, Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) awaits to see just what the prognosis is of his ex-wife, Lulu, who has been in a coma in a longterm care facility, plus all the drama between the Davis sisters.\n\nLast fall, Monaco celebrated her 20th anniversary with General Hospital and her fans have been clamoring for her to have more story as Sam has been a bit back-burnered of late. Is that all about to change? Stay tuned.\n\nSo, glad that if anyone was replacing Kelly, it was soap vet, Lindsay Hartley?
