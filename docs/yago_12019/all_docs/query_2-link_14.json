        "text": "Read all at Wikipedia!\n\nRandall James “R.J.” Gannon is a fictional character on the ABC soap opera, One Life to Live. He has been portrayed by Timothy D. Stickney since 1994, though the character was put on recurring status in 2006.\n\nR.J. is first introduced as the wayward younger brother of Llanview, Pennsylvania District Attorney Hank Gannon. He is a career criminal who later becomes a respectable businessman, more or less. Though the brothers are often at odds with each other, they eventually settle their differences. R.J. also maintains a close relationship with Hank’s ex-wife Nora Hanen; when Nora is erroneously believed to have died in 2000, no one is more demonstratively grief-stricken than R.J. He is also a loyal friend to Nora’s rival Lindsay Rappaport, helping her out of many bad situations, and this friendship eventually blossoms into romance."
