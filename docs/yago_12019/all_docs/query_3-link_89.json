        "text": "Nathan Purdee, who originated the role of Nathan Hastings on The Young and the Restless, has not only a TV son Nate, Jr. (Sean Dominic), but a real-life son, too, Taylor A. Purdee.\n\nKassie DePaiva and Nathan Purdee Together Again\n\nAnd after his YR run, he went on to play District Attorney Hank Gannon on One Life to Live, the ex-husband of Nora Hannen Gannon Buchanan (Hillary B. Smith). It was there that he worked with Kassie DePaiva.\n\nNow, the younger Purdee is making headlines. Broadway World is reporting that Hope Runs High has obtained the theatrical rights to Purdee’s first movie, a folk-rock musical titled Killian & The Comeback Kids. Watch for the film, which Purdee wrote and directed, to have a theatrical launch later this month.\n\nThe film tells the story of a young mixed-race musician (played by Taylor Purdee), who is forced to return to his hometown after earning an expensive university diploma. After a chance encounter with a pal from childhood (played by John Donchak), the two team up with some other folks, who are going through hard times, to form a band and play at a music festival.\n\nThe movie’s original score and soundtrack come from Purdee’s real-life folk-rock act The Cumberland Kids. There are nine original songs along with traditional folks songs and tracks. Watch for a soundtrack to be released along with the film.\n\nIn addition to the younger Purdee in the title role, the film also stars Kassie DePaiva (Eve, Days of our Lives; ex-Blair, One Life to Live) and Nathan Purdee. The cast also includes Lee Grant, who starred as Ava in the nighttime sudsy mini-series Bare Essence.\n\nOther cast members include Shannon O’Boyle, Shane Andries, Yael Elisheva, Emily Mest, Andrew O’Shanick, and Maddi Jane. Nathan Purdee has been appearing sporadically in recent YR classic episodes. YR returns with new episodes starting Monday, August 10. The Young and the Restless airs weekdays on CBS. Check local listings for air times."
