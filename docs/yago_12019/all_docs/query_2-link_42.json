        "text": "Blastocystis hominis among food vendors in Xochimilco markets.\n\nPubMed\n\nCruz Licea, VerÃ³nica; Plancarte Crespo, AgustÃ­n; MorÃ¡n Alvarez, Cristina; Valencia Rojas, Silvia; RodrÃ­guez SÃ¡snchez, Gustavo; Vega Franco, Leopoldo\n\n2003-01-01\n\nBlastocystis hominis is a pathogenic protozoon that lives in the human bowel and causes diarrhea: the mode of transmission is a passive one, through the ingestion of stool-contaminated water or foods that contain infective forms of the parasite. The purpose of this study is to report the prevalence of Blastocystis hominis among food vendors in the markets within the Xochimilco jurisdiction, Mexico City, Mexico. A cross-sectional study was conducted in which food vendors answered an epidemiological questionnaire and underwent a serial stool culture. The frequency of the intestinal parasitoses reported was estimated and an analysis was carried out associating the presence of Blastocystis hominis with socio-economic and hygienic factors using the odds ratio at a 95% confidence interval. The frequency of intestinal parasites and commensals was 50.4%; Blastocystis hominis was found in 48 (41.7%) food vendors. The risk analysis showed that Blastocystis hominis was associated with: male gender, poor personal hygiene habits, personal history of parasitosis, and family history of parasitosis. The prevalence reported is high when compared with other populations studied. The relevance of this report lies on the fact that food vendors handle foods and could transmit the infection to consumers.\n\n[Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of blastocystis hominis].\n\nPubMed\n\nTrabelsi, Sonia; Ali, Ichraf Ben Haj; Khaled, Samira\n\n2010-03-01\n\nBlastocystis hominis is an intestinal parasite known since long. It is cosmopolitan and lives in the colon. It is still the subject of controversy regarding its pathogenicity and possibly opportunistic character. We exhibit in this article the results obtained for 4 years on the epidemiological, clinical and biological character and opportunistic Blastocystis hominis, often overlooked in the examination of parasitological laboratories city. This is a retrospective study of 3257 stool examination (PSE), performed in the Mycology Laboratory of Parasitology of the Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis over a period of 4 years (January 2005-December 2008). Detection of Blastocystis hominis has been made by microscopic examination of samples by direct examination and concentration. Blastocystis was found in 7.27% of cases and 48.5% in men. Endolimax nanus is the parasite most frequently associated with Blastocystis (40.4% of cases). The port was symptomatic in 72.1% of cases, diarrhea is the symptom most often found (27.7%). There is a seasonal distribution; in fact, it is more frequently diagnosed in summer and autumn. The absence of gravity and the saprophytic nature of this infection do not lead to an indication for treatment even among profoundly immunosuppressed individuals. Only the persistence of clinical disorders associated with the detection of the parasite and in the absence of other micro-organisms and intestinal parasites justifies the treatement. Metronidazole is the molecule used conventionally.\n\nBlastocystis hominis revisited.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStenzel, D J; Boreham, P F\n\n1996-01-01\n\nBlastocystis hominis is a unicellular organism found commonly in the intestinal tract of humans and many other animals. Very little is known of the basic biology of the organism, and controversy surrounds its taxonomy and pathogenicity. There morphological forms (vacuolar, granular, and ameboid) have been recognized, but recent studies have revealed several additional forms (cyst, avacuolar, and multivacuolar). The biochemistry of the organism has not been studied to any extent, and organelles and structures of unknown function and composition are present in the cells. Several life cycles have been proposed but not experimentally validated. The form used for transmission has not been defined. Infections with the organism are worldwide and appear in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient individuals. Symptoms generally attributed to B. hominis infection are nonspecific, and the need for treatment is debated. If treatment appears warranted, metronidazole is suggested as the drug of choice, although failures of this drug in eradicating the organism have been reported. Infection is diagnosed by light microscopic examination of stained smears or wet mounts of fecal material. Most laboratories identify B. hominis by observing the vacuolar form, although morphological studies indicate that other forms, such as the cyst form and multivacuolar form, also should be sought for diagnosis.

China has one of the largest sheep and goat populations in the world. In this study we investigated the occurrence of Blastocystis sp. and P. hominis in domestic sheep and goats in China, and analyzed the genetic characterization of these two parasite species. In total, we collected fresh fecal samples from 832 sheep and 781 goats located on seven and ten farms, respectively, in the central eastern region of China. The corresponding sequences obtained in this study were subject to molecular analysis for subtype and allele identification of Blastocystis sp., and species and genotype confirmation of P. hominis. The occurrence of Blastocystis sp. was 6.0% (50/832) in sheep and 0.3% (2/781) in goats. The most predominant subtype (ST) of Blastocystis sp. in sheep was ST10 (50.0%), followed by ST14 (20%), ST5 (16%), novel sequence 1 (6%), novel sequence 4 (4%), novel sequence 2 (2%) and novel sequence 3 (2%). However, only ST1 was observed in goats. No mixed infections with different subtypes were found in this study. The 18S alleles showed allele 2 (100%) for ST1; allele 115 (75%) for ST5; and no match allele for ST5 (25%), ST10 (100%), ST14 (100%), novel sequence 1 (100%), novel sequence 2 (100%), novel sequence 3 (100%), and novel sequence 4 (100%) on the Blastocystis subtype (18S) and Sequence Typing (MLST) database. For P. hominis, two goats (0.3%) and zero sheep (0%) were identified as positive in this study. The 18S rRNA gene sequences of two P. hominis isolates from goats displayed 100% identity to type CC1, found previously in dogs, monkeys and humans. These results provide the detailed data on the occurrence and molecular epidemiology of Blastocystis sp. and P. hominis in sheep and goats in China. They also contribute to and expand our knowledge of the Blastocystis sp. and P. hominis epidemiology around the world.\n\nIsolate resistance of Blastocystis hominis to metronidazole.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaresh, K; Suresh, K; Khairul Anus, A; Saminathan, S\n\n1999-04-01\n\nIsolates of Blastocystis hominis from infected immigrant workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh and infected individuals from Singapore and Malaysia were assessed for growth pattern and degree of resistance to different concentrations of metronidazole. Viability of the cells was assessed using eosin-brillian cresyl blue which stained viable cells green and nonviable cells red. The Bangladeshi and Singaporean isolates were nonviable even at the lowest concentration of 0.01 mg/ml, whereas 40% of the initial inoculum of parasites from the Indonesian isolate at day one were still viable in cultures with 1.0 mg/ml metronidazole. The study shows that isolates of B. hominis of different geographical origin have different levels of resistance to metronidazole. The search for more effective drugs to eliminate th parasite appears inevitable, especially since surviving parasites from metronidazole cultures show greater ability to multiply in subcultures than controls.\n\nStress Exacerbates Infectivity and Pathogenicity of Blastocystis hominis: In Vitro and In Vivo Evidences\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChandramathi, Samudi; Suresh, Kumar; Sivanandam, Sinnadurai; Kuppusamy, Umah Rani\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Stress alters the oxidant-antioxidant state and immune cell responses which disrupts its function to combat infection. Blastocystis hominis, a common intestinal protozoan has been reported to be opportunistic in immunocompromised patients namely cancer. B. hominis infectivity in other altered immune system conditions especially stress is unknown. We aimed to demonstrate the stress effects towards the susceptibility and pathogenicity of B. hominis infection. Methods/Findings Three-week-old Wistar rats were divided into four groups: (a)control; (b)stress-induced; (c)B. hominis infected; (d)stress-induced with B. hominis infection; (nâ=â20 respectively). Stress was induced for an hour daily (30 days) using a Belly Dancer Shaker. Weight gain was monitored, stool samples were collected for B. hominis screening and blood for the determination of differential count, levels of immunoglobulin, oxidative damage, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation upon induction with solubilized antigen of B. hominis (Blasto-Ag). Group (b) exhibited the highest level of weight gain. Group (d) had higher levels of parasite cyst count in stools, serum IgE, oxidized protein and lipid compared to the group (c). Levels of monocyte and antioxidant in group (d) were decreased and their PBMCs showed highest inhibition of proliferation level when exposed to Blasto-Ag. Monocyte level in Group (b) showed insignificant difference compared to group (a) but was significantly lower compared to group (c). Antioxidant levels in group (c) were generally lower compared to group (a) and (b). Inhibition level exhibited by Blasto-Ag treated PBMCs of group (c) was higher compared to group (a) and (b). Conclusion The pathogenicity and augmentation of B. hominis infection is enhanced when stress is present. Lifestyles today are becoming increasingly stressed and the present findings suggest that the parasite which has been reported to be one of the most common organisms seen in\n\nClinical efficacy of Saccharomyces boulardii or metronidazole in symptomatic children with Blastocystis hominis infection.\n\nPubMed\n\nDinleyici, Ener Cagri; Eren, Makbule; Dogan, Nihal; Reyhanioglu, Serap; Yargic, Zeynel Abidin; Vandenplas, Yvan\n\n2011-03-01\n\nAlthough many Blastocystis infections remain asymptomatic, recent data suggest it also causes frequent symptoms. Therapy should be limited to patients with persistent symptoms and a complete workup for alternative etiologies. The goal of this study was to compare the natural evolution (no treatment) to the efficacy of Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) or metronidazole for the duration of diarrhea and the duration of colonization in children with gastrointestinal symptoms and positive stool examination for Blastocystis hominis. This randomized single-blinded clinical trial included children presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea-vomiting, flatulence) more than 2 weeks and confirmed B. hominis by stool examination (B. hominis cysts in the stool with microscopic examination of the fresh stool). The primary end points were clinical evaluation and result of microscopic stool examination at day 15. Secondary end points were the same end points at day 30. Randomization was performed by alternating inclusion: group A, S. boulardii (250 mg twice a day, ReflorÂ®) during 10 days; group B, metronidazole (30 mg/kg twice daily) for 10 days; group C, no treatment. At day 15 and 30 after inclusion, the patients were re-evaluated, and stool samples were examined microscopically. On day 15, children that were still symptomatic and/or were still B. hominis-infected in group C were treated with metronidazole for 10 days. There was no statistically significant difference between the three study groups for age, gender, and the presence of diarrhea and abdominal pain. On day 15, clinical cure was observed in 77.7% in group A (n, 18); in 66.6% in group B (n, 15); and 40% in group C (n:15) (p < 0.031, between groups A and C). Disappearance of the cysts from the stools on day 15 was 80% in group B, 72.2% in group A, and 26.6% in group C (p = 0.011, between group B and group C; p = 0.013, between group A and group C). At the end of the first month\n\nThe Prevalence of Blastocystis hominis and Other Protozoan Parasites in Soldiers Returning from Peacekeeping Missions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDuda, Aleksandra; Kosik-Bogacka, Danuta; Lanocha-Arendarczyk, Natalia; KoÅodziejczyk, Lidia; Lanocha, Aleksandra\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBlastocystis hominis is a common intestinal parasite found in humans living in poor sanitary conditions, living in tropical and subtropical climates, exposed to infected animals, or consuming contaminated food or water. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of B. hominis in Polish military personnel returning from peacekeeping missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. In total, 1,826 stool samples were examined. Gastrointestinal parasites were detected in 17% of the soldiers. The examined stool samples most frequently contained vacuolar forms of B. hominis (15.3%) and cysts of Entamoeba coli (1.0%) or Giardia lamblia (0.7%). In 97.1% of stool samples from infected soldiers, we observed less than five developmental forms of B. hominis in the field of view (40Ã). The parasite infections in soldiers were diagnosed in the autumn and the spring. There was no statistical correlation between age and B. hominis infection. Our results show that peacekeeping missions in countries with tropical or subtropical climates could be associated with risk for parasitic diseases, including blastocystosis. PMID:25732683\n\n[Standardization of Blastocystis hominis diagnosis using different staining techniques].\n\nPubMed\n\nEymael, Dayane; Schuh, Graziela Maria; Tavares, Rejane Giacomelli\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe present study was carried out from March to May 2008, with the aim of evaluating the effectiveness of different techniques for diagnosing Blastocystis hominis in a sample of the population attended at the Biomedicine Laboratory of Feevale University, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul. On hundred feces samples from children and adults were evaluated. After collection, the samples were subjected to the techniques of spontaneous sedimentation (HPJ), sedimentation in formalin-ether (Ritchie) and staining by means of Gram and May-GrÃ¼nwald-Giemsa (MGG). The presence of Blastocystis hominis was observed in 40 samples, when staining techniques were used (MGG and Gram), while sedimentation techniques were less efficient (32 positive samples using the Ritchie technique and 20 positive samples using the HPJ technique). Our results demonstrate that HPJ was less efficient than the other methods, thus indicating the need to include laboratory techniques that enable parasite identification on a routine basis.\n\nCharacteristics of Factors of Protozoa Blastocystis hominis Persistence.\n\nPubMed\n\nPotaturkina-Nesterova, N I; Il'ina, N A; Bugero, N V; Nesterov, A S\n\n2016-10-01\n\nPersistence activity manifested in the expression of anti-lysozyme, anti-lactoferrin, and antihistone factors promoting inactivation of natural anti-infection resistance factors in the body was revealed in Blastocystis hominis protozoa. Activities of these factors were ranged. The frequency of these factors in clinical isolates of blastocyst decreased in the following order: anti-lactoferrin activity (84.5Â±3.7%)âanti-lysozyme activity (64.8Â±5.7%)âanti-histone activity (48.1Â±2.3%). In healthy humans, the corresponding parameters were 7.3Â±1.3, 5.3Â±0.9, and 3.3Â±0.4%, respectively (p<0.05). It was shown that the studied activities in highly virulent blastocysts were higher than in groups of medium-, low-, and avirulent protozoa.\n\nChronic diarrhea caused by Blastocystis hominis and Cryptosporidium sp. in immunocompetent patient-a case report\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAndriyani, Y.; Rozi, M. F.; Saragih, R. H.; Darlan, D. M.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nBlastocystis hominis and Cryptosporidium sp. are commonly associated with immunocompromised patients. Severe clinical manifestation can be produced by this organism. It varies according to immune status, and subtype of this organism. Unfortunately, we found an immunocompetent patient with chronic diarrhea caused by this organism. A 38- year old male was admitted to Adam Malik General Hospital because of watery diarrhea since four days ago. Administration of fluid replacement was done to this patient, but the frequency of diarrhea did not decrease. Loperamide as anti-spasmodic was also given in each episode of diarrhea. Surprisingly, fecal smear examination revealed that this patient positive for Blastocystis hominis and Cryptosporidium sp. Thus, diarrhea was resolved for four days without giving any anti-parasitic drugs to the patient.\n\nIntestinal parasite infections in a rural community of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil): Prevalence and genetic diversity of Blastocystis subtypes.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarbosa, Carolina ValenÃ§a; Barreto, Magali Muniz; Andrade, Rosemary de Jesus; SodrÃ©, Fernando; d'Avila-Levy, Claudia Masini; Peralta, JosÃ© Mauro; Igreja, Ricardo Pereira; de Macedo, Heloisa Werneck; Santos, Helena Lucia Carneiro\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIntestinal parasitic infections are considered a serious public health problem and widely distributed worldwide, mainly in urban and rural environments of tropical and subtropical countries. Globally, soil-transmitted helminths and protozoa are the most common intestinal parasites. Blastocystis sp. is a highly prevalent suspected pathogenic protozoan, and considered an unusual protist due to its significant genetic diversity and host plasticity. A total of 294 stool samples were collected from inhabitants of three rural valleys in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The stool samples were evaluated by parasitological methods, fecal culture, nested PCR and PCR/Sequencing. Overall prevalence by parasitological analyses was 64.3% (189 out of 294 cases). Blastocystis sp.

Prevalence of IPIs was significantly different by gender. Phylogenetic analysis of Blastocystis sp. and BLAST search revealed five different subtypes: ST3 (34.0%), ST1 (27.0%), ST2 (27.0%), ST4 (3.5%), ST8 (7.0%) and a non-identified subtype. Our findings demonstrate that intestinal parasite infection rates in rural areas of the Sumidouro municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil are still high and remain a challenge to public health. Moreover, our data reveals significant genetic heterogeneity of Blastocystis sp. subtypes and a possible novel subtype, whose confirmation will require additional data.

PMID\n\nAssociation of Blastocystis subtypes with diarrhea in children\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZulfa, F.; Sari, I. P.; Kurniawan, A.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nBlastocystis hominis is an intestinal zoonotic protozoa that epidemiological surveys have shown, is highly prevalent among children and may cause chronic diarrhea. This study aimed to identify Blastocystis subtypes among children and associate those subtypes to pathology. The studyâs population was children aged 6-12 years old divided into asymptomatic and symptomatic (diarrhea) groups. The asymptomatic samples were obtained from primary school students in the Bukit Duri area of South Jakarta, while the symptomatic samples were obtained from patients who visited nearby primary health centers (Puskesmas). Symptomatic stool samples were examined inParasitology Laboratory FKUI. Microscopic examination of the stool samples was performed to screen for single Blastocystic infection, followed by culture, PCR of 18S rRNA, and sequencing. In the study, 53.2% of children (n = 156) harbored intestinal parasites, Blastocysts sp. A single infection of Blastocystis sp. was present in 69 (44.23%) samples, comprised of 36 symptomatic and 33 asymptomatic participants. The Blastocystis subtypes (STs) identified in this study were STs 1-4 ST3 was the most dominant and was observed with statistically significant higher frequency in the symptomatic group. ST4 was only found in one sample in the symptomatic group. While ST1 and ST2 were found more frequently in the asymptomatic group, no statistical association was observed. ST3 is more likely to be associated with clinical symptoms than ST1 and ST2.\n\nBlastocystis Hominis and Chronic Abdominal Pain in Children: Is there an Association between Them?\n\nPubMed\n\nToro Monjaraz, Erick Manuel; Vichido Luna, Miguel Angel; Montijo Barrios, Ericka; Cervantes Bustamante, Roberto; ZÃ¡rate MondragÃ³n, Flora; Huante Anaya, Alfonso; Cadena LeÃ³n, JosÃ©; Mendez, Monserrat Cazares; LÃ³pez Ugalde, Martha; Ramirez Mayans, Jaime A\n\n2017-08-03\n\nChronic abdominal pain has many etiologies, one of them being parasites. The aim of this study was to find an association between chronic abdominal pain in children and Blastocystis hominis (Bh). Clinical files of patients with Bh and functional abdominal pain were reviewed. A comparison was made between patients who showed an improvement of their symptoms and those who did not. Out of the 138 patients who had functional abdominal pain and Bh, 37 patients did not receive any treatment (26.8%), while 101 received it and were treated with different antimicrobial agents (73.2%); regarding the improvement of symptoms, a statistically significant difference (pâ<â0.001) was observed. Chronic abdominal pain in children has different etiologies; however, we have documented through this work that it is appropriate to provide antimicrobial treatment for patients with Bh and chronic abdominal pain.

Blastocystis infections and subtype distribution in cattle have been documented, while nothing is known about those in China. Herein, a total of 526 dairy cattle from northeast China were sampled and investigated for the prevalence and genetic characteristics of Blastocystis and the potential role of bovine animals in zoonotic transmission of Blastocystis. The parasite was identified in 54 (10.3%) fecal specimens by nested PCR and DNA sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Sequence analysis enabled identification of four Blastocystis subtypes (STs). Among those, subtype ST10 (75.9%, 41/54) has the highest frequency, followed by ST14 (18.5%, 10/54), ST4 (3.7%, 2/54), and ST5 (1.9%, 1/54). High prevalence and widespread distribution of ST10 and ST14 in cattle observed herein, together with analysis of their host distribution patterns in earlier studies, indicated some host-adapted potential in the two subtypes. The identification of human-pathogenic subtypes ST4 and ST5 might imply a potential zoonotic risk of cattle origin. This is the first study exploring the prevalence and genetic characteristics of Blastocystis in cattle in China. The host range of subtype ST4 was extended. The findings of this study should be helpful for a better understanding of the epidemiology and public health potential of Blastocystis. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using the Iodine and Haematoxylin staining, the morphology of B. h from patients and RPMI 1640 medium were observed. The B. h positive mucous diarrheal specimens were cultured and identified any possible known pathogenic intestinal bacteria. B. h and colibacillus were co-cultured to observe the interaction between them. Four modes of reproduction for B. h were confirmed: binary fission, endodyogeny, multiple fission and budding. The fact that there was no other intestinal pathogens in half of the B. h positive specimens suggested B. h may cause disease independently. B. h and colibacillus were restrained each other. B. h reproduces in at least four modes. B. h could be a pathogen and its pathogenesis may be related to micro-ecological changes.\n\nEpidemiologic Study of Blastocystis Infection in an Urban Community in the Philippines\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBelleza, Maria Luz B.; Cadacio, Jessa Louise C.; Borja, Maridel P.; Solon, Juan Antonio A.; Padilla, Mildred A.; Tongol-Rivera, Pilarita N.; Rivera, Windell L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBlastocystis has been considered as the most common intestinal parasite in humans and has an augmented impact on public health. However, the prevalence of this parasite in the Philippines has not been determined. To contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology of this infection, a cross-sectional study aimed at providing the first documented data on the prevalence and correlates, sociodemographic factors, hygiene practices, source of water supply, and dog ownership, associated with Blastocystis infection was carried out in randomly selected communities at Pateros, Metro Manila. Fecal samples from respondents were collected and cultured in diphasic agar medium for 3â7 days and examined using light microscopy. Of the 1,271 respondents, 12.98% (95% CI: 11.13â14.83) were detected positive for Blastocystis. Among the correlates of Blastocystis infection, dog ownership was found significantly associated as confirmed by multivariate analysis. Therefore, this factor should be considered in information to create awareness about Blastocystis and to prevent and control Blastocystis infection in particular and diarrheal diseases in general. Further studies using molecular approaches to distinguish subtype and to determine genetic characteristics of isolates from humans and dogs are recommended to analyze their relationship and provide more conclusive evidence of cross-transmission.

This study was carried out to determine the prevalence and the association of Blastocystis infection with the socio-economic characteristics among 300 primary schoolchildren, living in rural communities in Lipis and Raub districts of Pahang state, Malaysia. Stool samples were collected and examined for the presence of Blastocystis using direct smear microscopy after in vitro cultivation in Jones' medium. The overall prevalence of Blastocystis infection was found to be as high as 25.7%. The prevalence was significantly higher among children with gastrointestinal symptoms as compared to asymptomatic children (x2 =4.246; P=0.039). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that absence of a piped water supply (OR=3.13; 95% CI=1.78, 5.46; P<0.001) and low levels of mothers' education (OR=3.41; 95% CI=1.62, 7.18; P<0.01) were the significant predictors of Blastocystis infection. In conclusion, Blastocystis is prevalent among rural children and the important factors that determine the infection were the sources of drinking water and mothers' educational level. Interventions with provision of clean water supply and health education especially to mothers are required.\n\nExacerbated symptoms in Blastocystis sp.-infected patients treated with metronidazole: two case studies.\n\nPubMed\n\nRajamanikam, Arutchelvan; Kumar, Suresh; Samudi, Chandramathi; Kudva, Madhav\n\n2018-06-05\n\nBlastocystis sp. is a gastrointestinal (GI) protozoan parasite reported to cause non-specific GI symptoms including diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain, and nausea. Complete eradication of Blastocystis sp. is rather challenging even with the drug of choice, i.e., metronidazole. Here, we report on two Blastocystis sp.-infected individuals, who presented increased parasite load and exacerbated symptoms upon treatment with the usual recommended dosage and regime of metronidazole. The two studies uniquely demonstrate for the first time a cyst count as high as fivefold more than the original cyst count before treatment and show an exacerbation of GI symptoms despite treatment. The study provides additional support in recognizing metronidazole resistance in Blastocystis sp. and its consequences towards the pathogenicity of the parasite.\n\nSurvey on association between Mycoplasma hominis endocervical infection and spontaneous abortion using Polymerase Chain Reaction.\n\nPubMed\n\nFarhadifar, Fariba; Khodabandehloo, Mazaher; Ramazanzadeh, Rashid; Rouhi, Samaneh; Ahmadi, Amjad; Ghaderi, Ebrahim; Roshani, Daem; Soofizadeh, Nasrin; Rezzaii, Masoomeh\n\n2016-03-01\n\nMycoplasma infections are suggested as etiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of Mycoplasma hominis (M. hominis) infection and spontaneous abortion among pregnant women. In this case-control study that was conducted from August 2012 to January 2013, totally, 109 women were included with spontaneous abortion with gestational ages of 10-20 weeks (Cases), and 109 women with normal pregnancy with gestational ages between 20-37 weeks (Controls) in Sanandaj, Iran. Using specific primers and extracted DNA from endocervical swabs, a PCR test was conducted for detection of M. hominis infection in women. For comparison of qualitative and quantitative variables, independent Fisher tests were used and p<0.05 was considered significant. The total frequency of M. hominis infection was 6 (2.75%) in women. The frequency of M. hominis infection was 2 (1.83%) in the case group (spontaneous abortion) and 4 (3.66%) in the control group, respectively. In both case and control groups, no association was seen between M.hominis infection and spontaneous abortion (OR=0. 49, CI 95%: 0.08-2.73, p=0. 683). M. hominis was positive in the genital tract of some pregnant women, but it was not associated with spontaneous abortion. However, to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes in women, foetus and neonate, routine screening and treatment for the genital Mycoplasma is recommended.\n\nIntestinal parasitic infections in suburban government schools, Lak Hok subdistrict, Muang Pathum Thani, Thailand.\n\nPubMed\n\nKitvatanachai, Sirima; Rhongbutsri, Pochong\n\n2013-09-01\n\nTo provide baseline information of parasitic infections in 3 suburban government schools, Lakhok subdistrict of Muang Pathum Thani, Thailand. This study was conducted between May-June 2010 using simple direct smear and modified formalin ether and from a population of 1 253 in 3 suburban government schools. Total samples of 202 registered and participated. The average of prevalence of infection from 3 schools was 13.9%, there were 13.7%, 14.3% and 13.9% in N, S and R school, respectively with no significant difference between schools (P>0.05). The infection rates did not show significant difference between genders (P>0.05). The highest rate of infection was 20.4% in Pathom 2 (8 years) students and the lowest was 4% in Pathom 1 (7 years) with statistically difference between age groups (P<0.05). The highest prevalence of pathogenic protozoa was Giardia lamblia (G. lamblia) which was found in 50% of infected cases, followed by 25% of Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) and Blastocystis hominis (B. hominis). The highest prevalence of non-pathogenic protozoa was Endolimax nana (E. nana) which was found in 88.9%, followed by 11.1% of Entamoeba coli (E. coli). Mixed infections between Blastocystis hominis (B. hominis) and Endolimax nana (E. nana) were reported at 7.1%. The only helminthic infection found in this study area was hookworm, found in 1 student (3.8%). The formalin ether concentration technique showed a higher efficacy of detection (78%-100%) than the simple direct smear method (0%-50%). Surveillance of Protozoan infections may need to be focused on suburban areas. Copyright Â© 2013 Hainan Medical College. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The most important protozoa that parasitize humans are Giardia, Entamoeba, Blastocystis , and Cryptosporidium . These parasites present wide intraspecific genetic diversity and subsequently classified into assemblages and subtypes. The Amazon basin is the largest in the world and is the fifth freshwater reserve on the planet. Contradictorily, people living in these areas (Indigenous populations) have poor quality of life, which favors the infection of diseases of fecal-oral transmission. The aim of this work was to unravel the molecular epidemiology of Giardia, Blastocystis and Cryptosporidium across four communities (Puerto NariÃ±o, San Juan del Soco, Villa Andrea and Nuevo ParaÃ­so). We obtained 284 fecal samples from children under 15 years old that were analyzed by direct microscopy (261 samples) and Real Time PCR (qPCR) (284 samples). The positive samples for these protozoa were further characterized by several molecular markers to depict assemblages and subtypes. We observed a frequency of Giardia infection by microscopy of 23.7% (62 samples) and by qPCR of 64.8% (184 samples); for Blastocystis by microscopy of 35.2% (92 samples) and by qPCR of 88.7% (252 samples) and for Cryptosporidium only 1.9% (5 samples) were positive by microscopy and qPCR 1.8% (5 samples). Regarding the Giardia assemblages, using the glutamate dehydrogenase ( gdh) marker we observed AI, BIII and BIV assemblages and when using triose phosphate isomerase ( tpi ) we observed assemblages AI, AII, BIII and BIV. In contrast, Blastocystis STs detected were 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Lastly, the species C. viatorum, C. hominis (with the subtypes IdA19 and IaA12R8) and C. parvum (with the subtype IIcA5G3c) were identified. We observed a high profile of zoonotic transmission\n\nPrevalence, predictors and clinical significance of Blastocystis sp. in Sebha, Libya.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdulsalam, Awatif M; Ithoi, Init; Al-Mekhlafi, Hesham M; Khan, Abdul Hafeez; Ahmed, Abdulhamid; Surin, Johari; Mak, Joon Wah\n\n2013-04-08\n\nBlastocystis sp. has a worldwide distribution and is often the most common human intestinal protozoan reported in children and adults in developing countries. The clinical relevance of Blastocystis sp. remains controversial. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of Blastocystis infection and its association with gastrointestinal symptoms among outpatients in Sebha city, Libya. A total of 380 stool samples were collected from outpatients attending the Central Laboratory in Sebha, Libya for routine stool examination. The presence of Blastocystis sp. was screened comparing light microscopy of direct smears against in vitro cultivation. Demographic and socioeconomic information were collected with a standardized questionnaire. The overall prevalence of Blastocystis infection was 22.1%. The prevalence was significantly higher among patients aged â¥18 years compared to those aged < 18 years (29.4% vs 9.9%; xÂ² = 19.746; P < 0.001), and in males compared to females (26.4% vs 17.5%; xÂ² = 4.374; P = 0.036). Univariate analysis showed significant associations between Blastocystis infection and the occupational status (P = 0.017), family size (P = 0.023) and educational level (P = 0.042) of the participants. Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed that the age of â¥ 18 years (OR = 5.7; 95% CI = 2.21; 9.86) and occupational status (OR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.02, 4.70) as significant predictors of Blastocystis infection among this population. In those who had only Blastocystis infection but no other gastrointestinal parasitic infections, the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms was higher compared to those without Blastocystis infection (35.3% vs 13.2%; xÂ² = 25.8; P < 0.001). The most common symptoms among these patients were abdominal pain (76.4%), flatulence (41.1%) and diarrhoea (21.5%).

However, the transmission of this parasite has not been conclusively determined. To contribute to a better comprehension of the epidemiology of this infection, a cross-sectional survey aimed at providing the first documented data on the prevalence and risk factors associated with Blastocystis infection was carried out among three Orang Asli tribes (Proto-Malay, Negrito and Senoi) in selected villages at Negeri Sembilan, Perak and Pahang, Peninsular Malaysia. Faecal samples were examined by formalin-ether sedimentation and trichrome staining techniques. Of 500 individuals, 20.4% (102) were detected positive for Blastocystis; 13.3% (20/150) of Proto-Malays, 21.6% (30/139) of Negritos and 24.7% (52/211) of Senois were positive for Blastocystis, respectively. The positive cases showed a decrease with increasing age and most of the positive cases were observed in individuals less than 15 years old. Multivariate analysis confirmed that drinking untreated water and the presence of other family members infected with Blastocystis were significant risk factors of infection among the three tribes and overall population studied. Essentially, the findings highlighted that Blastocystis infection is prevalent among Orang Asli communities in Malaysia. Further studies using molecular approaches to distinguish the subtype of Blastocystis is needed. The present study also revealed that this infection may be transmitted through waterborne and human-to-human contact. Therefore, interventions with the provision of clean water supply for the communities and health education especially to the parents are urgently required.\n\nSubtype Distribution of Blastocystis Isolates in Sebha, Libya\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbdulsalam, Awatif M.; Ithoi, Init; Al-Mekhlafi, Hesham M.; Al-Mekhlafi, Abdulsalam M.; Ahmed, Abdulhamid; Surin, Johari\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Blastocystis is a genetically diverse and a common intestinal parasite of humans with a controversial pathogenic potential. This study was carried out to identify the Blastocystis subtypes and their association with demographic and socioeconomic factors among outpatients living in Sebha city, Libya. Methods/Findings Blastocystis in stool samples were cultured followed by isolation, PCR amplification of a partial SSU rDNA gene, cloning, and sequencing. The DNA sequences of isolated clones showed 98.3% to 100% identity with the reference Blastocystis isolates from the Genbank. Multiple sequence alignment showed polymorphism from one to seven base substitution and/or insertion/deletion in several groups of non-identical nucleotides clones. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three assemblage subtypes (ST) with ST1 as the most prevalent (51.1%) followed by ST2 (24.4%), ST3 (17.8%) and mixed infections of two concurrent subtypes (6.7%). Blastocystis ST1 infection was significantly associated with female (P = 0.009) and low educational level (P = 0.034). ST2 was also significantly associated with low educational level (P= 0.008) and ST3 with diarrhoea (P = 0.008). Conclusion Phylogenetic analysis of Libyan Blastocystis isolates identified three different subtypes; with ST1 being the predominant subtype and its infection was significantly associated with female gender and low educational level. More extensive studies are needed in order to relate each Blastocystis subtype with clinical symptoms and potential transmission sources in this community.

Of 370 stool samples, 118 (31.9%) were infected with Blastocystis. Genotypic characterization of Blastocystis was performed by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of the partial small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene. Subtype 1 was the most predominant (94.8%), followed by subtype 6 (3.5%) and subtype 2 (1.7%). Sequence analyses revealed nucleotide polymorphisms for Blastocystis subtype 1, which were described as subtype 1/variant 1, subtype 1/variant 2. Blastocystis subtype 1/variant 1 was the most predominant infection occurring in almost every house. The results showed that subtype analysis of Blastocystis was useful for molecular epidemiological study.

The prevalence of this parasite has close correlation with the climate and hygiene situation of studied populations. For the current study, English and Persian databases were searched for the following terms: \"Blastocystis hominis\", \"Blastocystis sp.\", \"Intestinal Parasites\", \"Prevalence\" and \"Iran\". In order to data analysis and assess the possibility of publication bias, STATA v11 and Begg's Funnel plot were employed respectively. From 605 searched cases, 86 publications met our criteria for the analysis. The pooled prevalence of Blastocystis was 9.1% (95%CI: 8.2%, 10.1%). The results represented that the prevalence of the parasite using molecular techniques or cultivation followed by molecular techniques (20.89%) was higher than only microscopical examination (8.96%). The prevalence rate of Blastocystis according to human development index was 7.6%, 7.2%, 11.9%, 13.4%, and 3.3% for ranks 1 to 5, respectively. This is the first study signifying the prevalence of Blastocystis regarding the human development index and climate conditions. The findings represented that although human development index, low levels of socioeconomic situations together with appropriate climate such as sufficient humidity and high temperature increase the chance of transmission of Blastocystis in a society.

This cross-sectional study was therefore conducted to provide the prevalence of Blastocystis and to determine the potential risk factors associated with each subtype during the wet and dry seasons in the Aboriginal community, Pahang, Malaysia. A total of 473 faecal samples were collected: 256 (54.1%) and 217 (45.9%) samples were obtained during the wet (October-November 2014) and the dry season (June 2015), respectively. All fresh faecal samples were subjected to molecular analysis for subtype and allele identification. Of the 473 samples, 42.6% and 37.8% were positive for Blastocystis ST1, ST2, ST3 and ST4 during wet and dry seasons, respectively. Prevalence of Blastocystis ST1 was significantly higher during the wet season compared to the dry season (ZÂ =Â 2.146, PÂ <Â 0.05). Analysis of the association of each Blastocystis subtype with socioeconomic characteristics showed the presence of other family members infected with Blastocystis ST3 and the use of stored river water for domestic activities were the significant risk factors for Blastocystis ST3 infections during both seasons. Untreated water supply and low monthly household income (less or equal to RM 500) were the other significant risk factors for Blastocystis ST3 infections during wet and dry season, respectively. The presence of other family members with Blastocystis ST1 and ST2 was the only significant risk factor associated with ST1 and ST2 infections during both seasons. We hypothesise that transmission of Blastocystis ST1, ST2 and ST3 occurred from person to person during both seasons. The waterborne transmission was also identified as a mode of transmission of Blastocystis ST3. The significant risk factors identified in this study were important in the dynamic transmission of Blastocystis infections during both seasons.

Infection among School Children in Peninsular Malaysia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNithyamathi, Kalimuthu; Chandramathi, Samudi; Kumar, Suresh\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground One of the largest cross-sectional study in recent years was carried out to investigate the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections among urban and rural school children from five states namely Selangor, Perak, Pahang, Kedah and Johor in Peninsula Malaysia. This information would be vital for school authorities to influence strategies for providing better health especially in terms of reducing intestinal parasitism. Methods and Principal Findings A total of 3776 stool cups was distributed to 26 schools throughout the country. 1760 (46.61%) responded. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection in both rural and urban areas was 13.3%, with Blastocystis sp (10.6%) being the most predominant, followed by Trichuris trichiura (3.4%), Ascaris lumbricoides (1.5%) and hook worm infection (0.9%). Only rural school children had helminthic infection. In general Perak had the highest infection (37.2%, total, n = 317), followed by Selangor (10.4%, total, n = 729), Pahang (8.6%, total, n = 221), Kedah (6.2%, total, n = 195) and Johor (3.4%, total, n = 298). School children from rural schools had higher infection (13.7%, total, n = 922) than urban school children (7.2%, total, n = 838). Subtype (ST) 3 (54.3%) is the most predominant ST with persons infected with only ST1 and ST3 showing symptoms. Blastocystis sp infection significantly associated with low household income, low parentâs education and presence of symptoms (p<0.05).

Cardiac devices are increasingly implanted. Two cases of infective episodes in pacemaker (PM) treated patients with respectively C. hominis and C. valvarum are presented. In one case blood-culture bottles yielded growth of C. hominis at two episodes with two years apart. At the second episode a vegetation was recognized at the PM lead and the PM device and lead was removed. In the C. valvarum case, echocardiography revealed a bicuspid aortic valve with severe regurgitation and a more than 1 cm sized vegetation. The cases illustrate the diversity in disease severity by Cardiobacterium species.

The geographic distribution of Blastocystis subtypes is variable, but the subtypes present in Qatar are at present unknown. Stool samples were collected from randomly selected, apparently healthy subjects arriving in Qatar for the first time. Blastocystis subtypes were determined by sequencing of the small subunit rRNA gene (SSU rDNA) PCR products. Phylogenetic analyses were done using Maximum Composite Likelihood method. 71.1Â % of samples were positive for Blastocystis infection based on PCR-detection methodology compared to only 6.9Â % by microscopy. Prevalence of Blastocystis did not differ between the sexes nor between age classes. However, there was a regional difference in prevalence with subjects arriving from Africa showing the highest (87.6Â %), those from Western Asia intermediate (68.6Â %) and from Eastern Asia the lowest prevalence (67.6Â %). Genetic analysis detected only three STs. ST3 was the most common (69.3Â %) and ST2 was the rarest (3.5Â %), while ST1 had a prevalence of 27.2Â %. ST2 showed a regional variation, being absent from the 64 Western Asian Blastocystis-positive subjects. Both ST1 and ST3 showed significant differences in prevalence between the sexes. This is the first report exploring the distribution of Blastocystis subtypes in our region. We recommend that stool screening via microscopy for the presence of Blastocystis should be abandoned since it is extremely insensitive. In future, the prevalence of Blastocystis infections should be based on PCR methodology and we predict that in the years ahead diagnostic PCR will become the tool of choice.

In this study the prevalence of intestinal protozoa in 154 HIV-infected patients, with or without diarrhoea, in our region (Apulia, South Italy) was evaluated between December 1993 and February 1998. In the majority of patients CD4+ T cell count was below 200/microl. The overall prevalence of intestinal protozoa was 43/154 (27.92%). Twenty-eight (43.08%) out of 65 patients with diarrhoea and 15 (16-85%) out of 89 non-diarrhoeic patients were parasitized. In particular, in the group of 65 patients with diarrhoea the following protozoa were identified: Cryptosporidium parvum in 14 (21.54%), Blastocystis hominis in 7 (10.77%), microsporidia in 6 (9.23%), Giardia lamblia in 4 (6.15%) and Isospora belli in 1 (1.54%). Three patients were Cryptosporidium parvum-microsporidia co-infected. In patients without intestinal symptoms, prevalence was 3/89 (3.37%) for Cryptosporidium parvum, 9/89 (10.11%) for Blastocystis hominis, 1/89 (1.12%) for microsporidia and 2/89 (2.25%) for Giardia lamblia. A significant (P<0.001) correlation was observed between protozoan infection and the presence of diarrhoea. In particular, Cryptosporidium parvum and microsporidia infections were significantly (P<0.001) and P = 0.046, respectively) associated with diarrhoeal illness. Moreover, the majority of cases of cryptosporidiosis were first diagnosed in the periods of heaviest rainfall. Therefore, drinking water contamination may be a possible source of human infection in our area.

Animal contact was only recorded for three patients; nine patients died despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Although infections with this microorganism seem to be rare, the fact that 37 of 46 strains characterized in this study have been found in Copenhagen indicates that under-reporting may occur. A. hominis is phenotypically relatively homogeneous but can be difficult to differentiate from other Actinobacillus species unless extensive biochemical testing is performed. Mannose-positive strains of A. hominis are especially difficult to differentiate from A. equuli. Attempts to identify A. hominis by automatic identification systems may lead to misidentifications. Ribotyping and DNA-DNA hybridization data show that A. hominis is a homogeneous species clearly separated from other species within the genus Actinobacillus.

Metronidazole is considered a first-line treatment for Blastocystis infection; however, there has been increasing evidence for the lack of efficacy of this treatment. Treatment failure has been reported in several clinical cases, and recent in vitro studies have suggested the occurrence of metronidazole-resistant strains. In this study, we tested 12 Blastocystis isolates from 4 common Blastocystis subtypes (ST1, ST3, ST4, and ST8) against 12 commonly used antimicrobials (metronidazole, paromomycin, ornidazole, albendazole, ivermectin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], furazolidone, nitazoxanide, secnidazole, fluconazole, nystatin, and itraconazole) at 10 different concentrations in vitro. It was found that each subtype showed little sensitivity to the commonly used metronidazole, paromomycin, and triple therapy (furazolidone, nitazoxanide, and secnidazole). This study highlights the efficacy of other potential drug treatments, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ivermectin, and suggests that current treatment regimens be revised.

This parasite is frequently found in people who are immunocompromised (patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or cancer) and a higher risk of Blastocystis sp. infection has been found in people with close animal contact. Such prevalence in the human population and the zoonotic potential naturally raise questions about the impact of these parasites on public health and has increased interest in this area. Recent inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo studies have shed new light on the pathogenic power of this parasite, suggesting that Blastocystis sp. infection is associated with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders, may play a significant role in irritable bowel syndrome, and may be linked with cutaneous lesions (urticaria). Despite recent significant advances in the knowledge of the extensive genetic diversity of this species, the identification of extracellular proteases as virulence factors and the publication of one isolate genome, many aspects of the biology of Blastocystis sp. remain poorly investigated. In this review, we investigate several biological aspects of Blastocystis sp. (diversity and epidemiology, diagnosis tools and pathophysiology). These data pave the way for the following challenges concerning Blastocystis sp. research: deciphering key biological mechanisms and pathways of this parasite and clarification of its clinical impact in humans.\n\nHost Cell Responses to Persistent Mycoplasmas - Different Stages in Infection of HeLa Cells with Mycoplasma hominis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHopfe, Miriam; Deenen, RenÃ©; Degrandi, Daniel; KÃ¶hrer, Karl; Henrich, Birgit\n\n2013-01-01\n\nMycoplasma hominis is a facultative human pathogen primarily associated with bacterial vaginosis and pelvic inflammatory disease, but it is also able to spread to other sites, leading to arthritis or, in neonates, meningitis. With a minimal set of 537 annotated genes, M. hominis is the second smallest self-replicating mycoplasma and thus an ideal model organism for studying the effects of an infectious agent on its host more closely. M. hominis adherence, colonisation and invasion of HeLa cells were characterised in a time-course study using scanning electron microscopy, confocal microscopy and microarray-based analysis of the HeLa cell transcriptome. At 4 h post infection, cytoadherence of M. hominis to the HeLa cell surface was accompanied by differential regulation of 723 host genes (>2 fold change in expression). Genes associated with immune responses and signal transduction pathways were mainly affected and components involved in cell-cycle regulation, growth and death were highly upregulated. At 48 h post infection, when mycoplasma invasion started, 1588 host genes were differentially expressed and expression of genes for lysosome-specific proteins associated with bacterial lysis was detected. In a chronically infected HeLa cell line (2 weeks), the proportion of intracellular mycoplasmas reached a maximum of 10% and M. hominis-filled protrusions of the host cell membrane were seen by confocal microscopy, suggesting exocytotic dissemination. Of the 1972 regulated host genes, components of the ECM-receptor interaction pathway and phagosome-related integrins were markedly increased. The immune response was quite different to that at the beginning of infection, with a prominent induction of IL1B gene expression, affecting pathways of MAPK signalling, and genes connected with cytokine-cytokine interactions and apoptosis. These data show for the first time the complex, time-dependent reaction of the host directed at mycoplasmal clearance and the counter measures of\n\nComparison of antigen-capture ELISA to stool-culture methods for the detection of asymptomatic Entamoeba species infection in Kafer Daoud, Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbd-Alla, M D; Wahib, A A; Ravdin, J I\n\n2000-05-01\n\nWe performed a prospective field study in the village of Kafer Daoud in Menofia, Egypt to compare the fecal culture method with enzyme linked immuno assay (ELISA) for detection of 170 kDa lectin antigen in feces for diagnosis of asymptomatic Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba dispar infection. All subjects with E. histolytica or E. dispar infection detected by culture also had positive ELISA for amebic antigen in their feces and an additional 57 Entameoba infections missed by culture were detected by ELISA (P < 0.001 compared to culture). The presence of fecal anti-lectin IgA antibodies and serum anti-LC3 (recombinant cysteine-rich lectin protein) IgG antibodies were positive predictors for E. histolytica infection (P < 0.03). Of interest, infection with Trichomonas hominis but not Blastocystis hominis was positively associated with E. histolytica infection (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ELISA for detection of fecal lectin antigen is a more sensitive method than fecal culture for detecting asymptomatic E. histolytica infection.\n\nPrevalence and Risk Factors for Intestinal Protozoan Infections with Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Blastocystis and Dientamoeba among Schoolchildren in Tripoli, Lebanon.\n\nPubMed\n\nOsman, Marwan; El Safadi, Dima; Cian, Amandine; Benamrouz, Sadia; Nourrisson, CÃ©line; Poirier, Philippe; Pereira, Bruno; Razakandrainibe, Romy; Pinon, Anthony; Lambert, CÃ©line; Wawrzyniak, Ivan; Dabboussi, Fouad; Delbac, Frederic; Favennec, LoÃ¯c; Hamze, Monzer; Viscogliosi, Eric; Certad, Gabriela\n\n2016-03-01\n\nIntestinal protozoan infections are confirmed as major causes of diarrhea, particularly in children, and represent a significant, but often neglected, threat to public health.

The absence of sternal wound infection delayed the diagnosis, but the patient successfully recovered with debridement surgeries and long-term antibiotic therapy. Owing to the difficulty in detection and the intrinsic resistance to beta-lactams, M.Â hominis infections are prone to being misdiagnosed and undertreated.

However, two variants, C.Â hominis monkey genotype and C.Â hominis Ik, were originally described in non-human hosts, monkeys and horses, respectively. During a Swedish national Cryptosporidium study, where all samples were analyzed at the small subunit rRNA and the 60â¯kDa (gp60) glycoprotein loci, we identified two patients infected with C.Â hominis monkey genotype (subtype IiA17) and two infected with C.Â hominis subtype IkA18G1. The isolates were further analyzed at the actin and the 70â¯kDa heat shock protein loci, and these analyses showed that these two subtype families are closely related to each other and to human-adapted C.Â hominis as well as to Cryptosporidium cuniculus. The two patients with C.Â hominis monkey genotype infection (a father and son) had visited a monkey farm in Thailand prior to infection, while the two cases with C.Â hominis Ik were unrelated, both probably infected in Sweden. This is the first time that a monkey genotype infection in humans has been related to contact with monkeys and where the gp60 subtype was identified. It is also the first time that human infection caused by C.Â hominis subtype Ik is described. Even though we were not able to detect any parasites in the animal samples, zoonotic transmission cannot be ruled out in any of these cases because both subtype families are regarded as animal adapted.

The possibility of zoonotic transmission to human from birds especially ostriches led us to investigate on the cross infectivity of Blastocystis sp. isolated from the ostrich feces as well as the phenotypic and subtype characteristics. There is a need to investigate this especially with the rising number of ostrich farms due to the growing global ostrich industry. 100% of the ostriches were found to be positive for Blastocystis sp. using the in-vitro cultivation method. Transmission electron microscopy revealed high electron dense material in the central body of the vacoular forms. The membrane layer of the ostrich isolate was significantly (pâ=â0.003) thicker as compared to human isolate. Sudan staining revealed that this was lipid accumulation. We provide evidence for the first time, the existence of subtype 6 which has been previously reported only in pigs and cattle. Cysts, ranging from 3.0 to 7.0 Î¼m in diameter caused experimental infection in Sprague Dawley rats implicating that Blastocystis sp. isolated from ostriches exhibits low host specificity. The study for the first time demonstrates that Blastocystis sp. subtype 6 do exist in ostriches and show high lipid storage in the vacuoles of the parasites. The study further provides evidence for potential zoonotic transmission in ostrich farms as Blastocystis subtype 6 can infect rats and the same subtype have been previously reported in humans.\n\nBlastocystis: Taxonomy, biology and virulence\n\nPubMed Central\n\nParija, Subhash Chandra; Jeremiah, SS\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe unicellular protist Blastocystis has long been an unsolved puzzle for taxonomists, microbiologists and clinicians. Over the years, the organism has been bounced on and off the different branches of the tree of life due the possession of unique phenotypic characters intermediary to different organisms. The organism is polymorphic with only few of forms such as vacuolar, granular, amoeboid, and the cyst form being commonly known. However it could exist in other forms much more frequently than the widely known forms which could be missed by the unaware observer. Certain older concepts in the life cycle of Blastocystis although has been proven wrong are still being followed in various textbooks and other trustworthy internet sources. The causal role of Blastocystis in human disease has long been a subject of controversy. It is widely believed that certain subtypes of the organism are virulent. But this is not so as other factors are also involved in the clinical outcome of the infection. In these contexts, this review intends to shed light on the past misconceptions and the recent findings on the taxonomy, biology and the virulence of this organism.

It has also been reported in numerous parasite surveys of animals in zoological gardens and in particular in non-human primate species. PCR-based methods capable of the direct detection of Blastocystis in faeces were used to detect Blastocystis from various hosts, including non-human primates, Australian native fauna, elephants and giraffes, as well as their keepers from a Western Australian zoo. Additional faecal samples were also collected from elephants and giraffes from four other zoos in Amsterdam (The Netherlands), Antwerp (Belgium), Melbourne and Werribee (Australia). Information regarding the general health and lifestyle of the human volunteers were obtained by questionnaire. Overall, 42% and 63% of animals and zoo-keepers sampled from the Western Australian zoo were positive for Blastocystis, respectively. The occurrence of Blastocystis in elephants and giraffes from other cities was similar. This is the first report of Blastocystis found in the elephant, giraffe, quokka, southern hairy nosed wombat and western grey kangaroo. Three novel and what appear to be highly host-specific subtypes (STs) of Blastocystis in the elephant, giraffe and quokka are also described. These findings indicate that further exploration of the genetic diversity of Blastocystis is crucial. Most zoo-keepers at the Perth Zoo were harbouring Blastocystis. Four of these zoo-keeper isolates were identical to the isolates from the southern hairy nosed wombat and five primate species.\n\nMolecular characterization of Blastocystis isolates from children and rhesus monkeys in Kathmandu, Nepal.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshikawa, Hisao; Wu, Zhiliang; Pandey, Kishor; Pandey, Basu Dev; Sherchand, Jeevan Bahadur; Yanagi, Tetsuo; Kanbara, Hiroji\n\n2009-03-23\n\nTo investigate the possible transmission of Blastocystis organisms between local rhesus monkeys and children in Kathmandu, Nepal, we compared the subtype (ST) and sequence of Blastocystis isolates from children with gastrointestinal symptoms and local rhesus monkeys. Twenty and 10 Blastocystis isolates were established from 82 and 10 fecal samples obtained from children and monkeys, respectively. Subtype analysis with seven sequence-tagged site (STS) primers indicated that the prevalence of Blastocystis sp. ST1, ST2 and ST3 was 20%, 20% and 60% in the child isolates, respectively. In contrast to human isolates, ST3 was not found in monkey isolates and the prevalence of ST1 and ST2 was 50% and 70%, respectively, including three mixed STs1 and 2 and one isolate not amplified by any STS primers, respectively. Since Blastocystis sp. ST2 has been reported as the most dominant genotype in the survey of Blastocystis infection among the various monkey species, sequence comparison of the 150bp variable region of the small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene was conducted among ST2 isolates of humans and monkeys. Sequence alignment of 24 clones developed from ST2 isolates of 4 humans and 4 monkeys showed three distinct subgroups, defined as ST2A, ST2B and ST2C. These three subgroups were shared between the child and monkey isolates. These results suggest that the local rhesus monkeys are a possible source of Blastocystis sp. ST2 infection of humans in Kathmandu.\n\nLow prevalence of Blastocystis sp. in active ulcerative colitis patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nRossen, N G; Bart, A; Verhaar, N; van Nood, E; Kootte, R; de Groot, P F; D'Haens, G R; Ponsioen, C Y; van Gool, T\n\n2015-05-01\n\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is thought to originate from a disbalance in the interplay between the gut microbiota and the innate and adaptive immune system. Apart from the bacterial microbiota, there might be other organisms, such as parasites or viruses, that could play a role in the aetiology of UC. The primary objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of Blastocystis sp. in a cohort of patients with active UC and compare that to the prevalence in healthy controls. We studied patients with active UC confirmed by endoscopy included in a randomised prospective trial on the faecal transplantation for UC. A cohort of healthy subjects who served as donors in randomised trials on faecal transplantation were controls. Healthy subjects did not have gastrointestinal symptoms and were extensively screened for infectious diseases by a screenings questionnaire, extensive serologic assessment for viruses and stool analysis. Potential parasitic infections such as Blastocystis were diagnosed with the triple faeces test (TFT). The prevalence of Blastocystis sp. were compared between groups by Chi-square testing. A total of 168 subjects were included, of whom 45 had active UC [median age 39.0Â years, interquartile range (IQR) 32.5-49.0, 49Â % male] and 123 were healthy subjects (median age 27Â years, IQR 22.0-37.0, 54Â % male). Blastocystis sp. was present in the faeces of 40/123 (32.5Â %) healthy subjects and 6/45 (13.3Â %) UC patients (pâ=â0.014). Infection with Blastocystis is significantly less frequent in UC patients as compared to healthy controls.\n\nGastrodiscoides hominis infection in a Nigerian-case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nDada-Adegbola, H O; Falade, C O; Oluwatoba, O A; Abiodun, O O\n\n2004-01-01\n\nGastrodiscoides hominis is a large fluke of pig and human and constitutes an important parasite of human in Assam, Indian, the Philippines and Southeast Asia.

Mycoplasma hominis usually colonizes the lower urogenital tract and causes pyelonephritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, chorioamnionitis, rupture of fetal membranes, preterm labor, postpartum fever, postabortal fever, and neonatal infection. This organism is highly prevalent in cervicovaginal cultures of sexually active women. M. hominis, M. genitalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and U. parvum may invade and infect placental and fetal tissues, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes. M. hominis occasionally causes nongenitourinary infection of the blood, wounds, central nervous system, joints, or respiratory tract. We present a case of a 27-year-old woman who developed abdominal wound hematoma and abscess after cesarean section. The wound was drained, but her high fever persisted, in spite of antibiotic treatment using flomoxef sodium and imipenemÂ·cilastatin sodium. Because the exudate exhibited M. hominis growth in an anaerobic environment, we administered the quinolone ciprofloxacin. This therapy resolved her fever, and her white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level diminished to the normal ranges. To our knowledge, there are four published articles regarding the isolation of M. hominis from postcesarean incisions. Based on the current study and the literature, infection by this pathogen may cause hematoma formation with or without abscess after cesarean section or in immunosuppressed postoperative patients. In such cases, physicians may need to suspect Mycoplasma infection and initiate appropriate antibacterial treatment as soon as possible in order to avoid persistent fever.

Many infections caused by CoNS appeared to be associated with biofilms. Nevertheless, the knowledge of the ability of S. hominis to form a biofilm is limited. The aim of this study was to analyze the formation of the biofilm by 56âS. hominis strains isolated from clinical cases. The biofilm three-dimensional structure was reconstructed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. We found that most of S. hominis strains carried icaADBC genes encoding polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), which plays a crucial role in the formation of biofilms in staphylococci strains. However, only a half of the ica-positive strains had an ability to form a biofilm in vitro. In this study, we also accessed the sensitivity of biofilms of S. hominis strains to sodium metaperiodate, proteinase K and DNase. We found that polysaccharides and proteins are the major components of the extracellular matrix of the biofilm formed by S. hominis. DNase did not have a significant effect on biofilms, which suggested that nucleic acid plays a minor role in the mature biofilm.\n\n[Blastocystis spp.: Advances, controversies and future challenges].\n\nPubMed\n\nDel Coco, Valeria F; Molina, Nora B; Basualdo, Juan A; CÃ³rdoba, MarÃ­a A\n\nBlastocystis spp. is the most common protozoan detected in human stool samples. In developing countries, infection rates are higher than 20%. The presence of this parasite in the feces of several host species suggests its zoonotic potential. The clinical relevance and the pathogenic role of Blastocystis spp. in the intestinal tract remain unclear. There are several clinical reports that recognize it as the etiologic agent of several intestinal disorders such as diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease and ulcerative colitis, although the pathogenicity of this parasite has not been proved yet. This wide range of clinical manifestations could be related to the genetic diversity exhibited by this parasite. Copyright Â© 2016 AsociaciÃ³n Argentina de MicrobiologÃ­a.

In addition to standard stool culture techniques, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques were employed to detect and subtype Blastocystis. All the serum samples collected were subjected for ELISA studies to measure the interleukin levels (IL-8, IL-3 and IL-5). Among 109 (IBS n = 35 and non-IBS n = 74) adults, direct stool examination and culture of colonic aspirates were initially negative for Blastocystis. However, PCR analysis detected Blastocystis in 6 (17%) IBS and 4 (5.5%) non-IBS patients. In the six positive IBS patients by PCR method, subtype 3 was shown to be the most predominant (3/6: 50%) followed by subtype 4 (2/6; 33.3%) and subtype 5 (1/6; 16.6%). IL-8 levels were significantly elevated in the IBS Blasto group and IBS group (p<0.05) compared to non-IBS and non-IBS Blasto group. The level of IL-3 in were seen to be significantly higher in than IBS Blasto group and IBS group (p<0.05) compared to non-IBS. Meanwhile, the IL-5 levels were significantly higher in IBS Blasto group (p<0.05) compared to non-IBS and non-IBS Blasto group. This study implicates that detecting Blastosystis by PCR method using colonic aspirate samples during colonoscopy, suggests that this may be a better method for sample collection due to the parasite's irregular shedding in Blastocystis-infected stools. Patients with IBS infected with parasite showed an increase in the interleukin levels demonstrate that Blastocystis does have an effect in the immune system.\n\nLong-Term Survival and Intracellular Replication of Mycoplasma hominis in Trichomonas vaginalis Cells: Potential Role of the Protozoon in Transmitting Bacterial Infection\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDessÃ¬, Daniele; Delogu, Giuseppe; Emonte, Eleonora; Catania, Maria Rosaria; Fiori, Pier Luigi; Rappelli, Paola\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe existence of a symbiotic relationship between Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis, which is the first reported example of symbiosis between two obligate human pathogens, has been recently reported by our research group. In this work, we examined the cellular location of M. hominis in respect to T. vaginalis. By using gentamicin protection assays, double immunofluorescence, and confocal microscopy, we obtained strong evidence that M. hominis is located within protozoan cells. 5-Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays showed that intracellularly located mycoplasmas actively synthesize DNA. Our results demonstrate that M. hominis has the capability of entering trichomonad cells and of replicating inside the protozoon. These findings suggest that symbiosis might provide the bacteria, during human infection, with the capability to resist to environmental stresses, such as host defense mechanisms and pharmacological therapies.

One stool sample from each of 217 schoolchildren of Vale de Sol ParanaguÃ¡ Bay (ParanÃ¡, Brazil) was collected. Three milliliters of each fixed stool sample were processed applying the formalin-ether concentration technique. After obtaining the overall prevalence of intestinal parasites, quantification was carried out in Blastocystis positive samples. A total of 75/217 (34.6%) children suffered from intestinal symptoms (abdominal pain and/or persistent diarrhea), of whom 41.3% (31/75) presented moderate/heavy Blastocystis load with a statistically significant risk to present intestinal symptoms (OR 0.039 [0.006-0.15]; p<0.001) Moreover, those symptomatic schoolchildren monoparasitized only by Blastocystis (10/75, 13.3%), and those polyparasitized by Blastocystis with other non-pathogenic species (15/75, 20%) with moderate/heavy loads, also entail a statistically significant risk of intestinal symptomatology, both in monoparasitism (12%, OR 0.10 [0.004-0.63]; p=0.021) and in polyparasitism with a non-pathogenic parasite (18.6%, OR 0.059 [0.002-0.35]; p=0.001). For the first time in Brazil, using data from schoolchildren of ParanaguÃ¡ Bay, we demonstrated that moderate/ heavy loads of Blastocystis could be related to intestinal symptoms.\n\nBlastocystis sp. and other intestinal parasites in hemodialysis patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nKulik, Rose Anne; Falavigna, Dina LÃºcia Morais; Nishi, LetÃ­cia; Araujo, Silvana Marques\n\n2008-08-01\n\nChronic renal insufficiency disease (CRI) leads to uremia in hemodialysis patients and induces a state of immunodepression that results in higher frequencies of infections and diarrhea. Hemodialysis patients resident in the city of Campo MourÃ£o, ParanÃ¡, Brazil were analyzed from April 2006 through September 2007 for Blastocystis sp. and other intestinal parasites and for associated diarrhea. Fecal samples from 86 hemodialysis patients and 146 healthy (reference) persons were examined by standard methods for detecting ova, larvae and cysts, which included preservation in 10% formalin and the Kinyoun method.
