After their divorce several years later, my grandmere took my papa and shipped out to Vogelheim, where they’ve lived ever since. Using her share of the contract settlement, she bought a ranch, and ran an electric fence around all 40 thousand hectares. She then imported cattle embryos from Earth, genetically-adapted to conditions on Vogelheim.\n\nAs a child, I was taught to never touch the fence, nor go past it. Beyond the fence prowled the titans and the rest of the gigantic birds that populate this world. That day, though, a section of the fence shorted out, and some of the heifers escaped. The hired hands were with the autumn cattle drive, so Mama took a shotgun and an ATV and went to round them up. She wasn’t fast enough. A pack of titans got the heifers, and then her when she came looking. After that, Papa and several of the uncles and hired hands got together and killed every titan they could find within 50 kilometres. The colonial ecologist was furious, but after Papa showed him what was left of Mama, he decided not to press charges. Papa devoted himself to the farm after that, only occasionally heading into the city for the company of a professional. We had no secrets on that farm.\n\nMy papa was only six when they arrived on Vogelheim, so Grandmere made do with a few multibots and an ever-changing array of hired hands. Some of those hands stayed on from year to year, and my papa started calling them uncles. Though Grandmere never remarried, many of those uncles also became her lovers, an arrangement that seemed to suit her well.\n\nAlong with the cattle, we raised wheat and corn, along with some specialty crops, greens for the table, and tomatoes for the market. We did well, until France finished L’Ascenceur, the Beanstalk on Beta Canum. After that, the beef market dried up, and many of the hired hands and even the uncles left for other worlds, including Beta Canum.\n\nVogelheim in that time had few large cities, nor many large towns. Papa was schooled at home, by a 30-year-old portacomp and an intermittent Link connection. He learned a great deal about farm operations though, everything from how to milk a cow to how to read genetic markers on an amniotic fluid sample. By the time he was 18, he was the manager of the cattle operations, while Grandmere contented herself with the crops and market gardens.\n\nWe downsized the cattle operation after that, producing just for the domestic market. It hurt to see pasture land returned to the wild, to see titans and their cousins where once we had raised cows. We even started raising domesticated augers - larger, tamer relatives of the titans, for the export luxury market. That was the worst, to see the look in Papa’s eyes every time he went out to check on the auger herd. Once, a small titan managed to leap the fence into the auger paddock. Papa came at a run, and cut loose with an automatic shotgun. He got the titan, and three augers as well.\n\nInterview With A Farmer\n\nI’ve never seen Earth, except in tri-vid shows and articles on the Link. I can’t imagine a world of 5 billion people. Where would they put them all?\n\nMy papa left the farm for a year, to attend the college in Neuberg. When he returned, my mama came with him, already pregnant with my sister. I followed two years later, and my little brother was three years after that.\n\nIn 2295 I left Vogelheim, selling my share in the farm to Grandmere, and spent eight months in transit to Ellis, on the American Arm. Hot and sere, Ellis was so different from Vogelheim. Most importantly, though, it had no titans. You see, I was with Mama that day, though I stayed inside the fence. I saw what the titans did to her, even as she killed two of their number. I still have the scars on my hands from when I grabbed the wire on the reactivated fence, trying to save her.\n\nThe farm was a little village of itself. Some of the long-time farm hands, those who hadn’t become uncles, brought their own families to our isolated station. Papa and Grandmere expanded the cattle operation several times, and we added our own slaughterhouse and processing plant. We were on the verge of becoming a small town at that point.\n\nThere are 33 inhabited worlds in the frontier regions of human space, and over 60 separate colonies on those worlds, as well as dozens of outposts, smaller settlements, and interstellar micronations. While the social environment on each of these worlds is unique, depending on the social and physical constraints of the world itself, certain truisms tend to hold for most colonies.\n\nDespite being together for years, Papa and Mama never married. They were always together, though, heads close, talking and laughing. They had been together 15 years when the titans got her.\n\n2\n\nPrimary Colony Site\n\nElevation: 497 m above mean sea level\n\n4 13\n\n1\n\n10\n\n8\n\n14 5\n\n11\n\n9\n\n12\n\n7\n\n3 2 6\n\n5\n\n4 SurvSat 4 Altitude: 127 km Locations 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.\n\nLanding Pad Hab Module Tower Hab Modules Power Modules Fuel Tanks Greenhouses Storage Domes\n\n8.

It is a mix of primitive and advanced technologies, but even the primitive is informed by advanced knowledge. Some colonies may have outdoor toilets, for example, as portrayed in many a Core drama, but it is probably a composting toilet that is producing fertilizer for the local farms, or, on many worlds, to add to the paydirt that is helping the terraforming process and conditioning the soil for Terran crops. Through digital books or planetary Link networks, colonists have access to the same base of knowledge as anyone in the Core.\n\nOtherwise, technology used on the frontier tends to be sturdy, effective, and unimaginative, trading style and innovation for ease of use and robustness. For example, a Link phone made for the Core market may be little more than a polycarbonate tube with a holographic projector and electrostatic-feedback virtual keyboard. On a colony world, however, the typical Link phone is considerably larger, heavier, and far more robust. It won’t be able to do everything the Core Link phone can do, but it also will not be obsolete after only one season. This same general preference for function, ruggedness, and longevity, informs all technology produced for the colonial market. On the frontier,\n\nThe listed Technology Level of any colony world is about manufacturing capabilities, rather than knowledge. Most colony worlds will have access to the high-tech equipment of the Core, but at a premium price. This premium guarantees that only inexpensive\n\n3\n\ncolonists need their equipment to work, all the time. The replacement might be ten light-years away. This also means that simpler, locally-produced equipment is most often used, with the high-tech gear reserved for critical tasks.\n\nto be a gross waste of resources. Only long-settled worlds like Niebelungen and Beta Canum have that luxury. Medical care is often freely provided by the colony and the home country, in recognition that colonising an alien world is decidedly unsafe. This includes the provision of long-term care, and cybertherapy for lost limbs/organs. However, there is little in the way of other social safety net programs on the Frontier. There is far more work to be done than there are people to do it, so meaningful employment is easy to come by. The expectation is that since there is always work to do, there is no reason, other than choice or critical illness, for a person to be unemployed. If a person chooses unemployment, then they also choose to go hungry.\n\nPeople migrate to the frontier for a variety of reasons, whether for land, self-determination, freedom of expression or freedom from surveillance. Some even migrate to get rich, with the intention of returning to the Core with their new wealth. This seldom works as planned. Colonists tend to be non-conformists, and the worlds and nations of the Core do not suffer non-conformity gladly. The competition for resources is another driver of colonisation, as Core nations look for opportunities to feed the consumer-driven lifestyles of Earth and Tirane.\n\nOf course, no one will let children starve, either. In such cases where a person (or persons) have children but are unemployed, the colony will endeavor to provide for the children, and so will often place the adults into a forced-work program. These programs will provide enough for the family to get by, while at the same time performing meaningful service for the colony. These jobs are often unpleasant enough to force the recipients to seek proper employment, which tends to pay better too.\n\nColonies are often settled by fringe groups, looking to escape the rigid conformity of Core life. The fringe groups may be religious, cultural, or just outsiders. These communities will often pool their money, and assisted by government or Foundation grants, will migrate en masse. They tend to be minorities even out in the colonies, but at least on the frontier, their neighbours will tend to leave them alone to do their own thing. With them come the entrepreneurial pioneers, those looking to make their fortune on the frontier, along with the corporations and their employees, likewise attracted by the lure of riches and untapped resources.\n\nThe rate of population growth is far higher on colony worlds than in the Core. Most provide reproduction incentives in the form of land grants, tax cuts, or outright cash giveaways. However, as colonies mature and become more urbanised, birth rates decrease regardless of the incentives available. In general, though, the first two generations of any new colony experience growth rates of 1.2% to 1.4%, seeing populations double in the first few decades of settlement.\n\nGenerally speaking, people on the Frontier tend to be more socially conservative than those in the Core, at least in regards to issues like crime, justice and the role of government. At the same time, however, they are far more accepting of different lifestyles, more mindful of privacy, and less concerned with how a person chooses to live, far more concerned with whether they are pulling their own weight. As long as no one is being hurt, personal situations are no one else’s business. Polygamy, polyandry, and group marriages are far more common on frontier worlds than in the Core. On some worlds, like Montana in the Chinese Arm, polyandry has become the norm, due to social pressures and the large ratio of men to women.\n\nThe fashions and entertainments of the Core tend to make their way out to the colonies, but between travel times and different rates of adoption, the colonies will always seem behind the times to visitors from the Core. These visitors will also find that, the farther out the colonies are, the less they care about the latest and greatest from the Core, and the more likely they are to prefer local fashion and entertainment. Most new colonies do not have the manpower for professional entertainers, so the performers are generally amateurs who act or play music on their own time, once their work is done. In a similar vein, the newer colonies do not have professional athletes, but enthusiastic amateurs are easy to find. The games played are ones that do not require much in the way of equipment or facilities, so baseball, soccer, basketball, lacrosse and cricket are very popular, while American-style football and ice hockey decidedly less so.\n\nCrime and punishment are about protecting the colony, rather than reforming the criminal. On most colonies, serious crimes, like rape and murder, are punished either by death or by deportation to the colony’s home country, where the matter will be dealt with in a more liberal fashion, typically by treatment, re-education, or, in extreme cases, personality wipe. In those cases, the criminal is generally permanently exiled from the colony, no matter what the home country decides to do with him. Deportation is often the preferred alternative in the case of protests by citizens and organisations in the home nation. Colonies usually do not have the resources to treat and reform serious criminals. Less serious crimes are usually punished by requiring the perpetrator to compensate his victims and/or the colony as a whole, usually through restitution and community service. Incarcerating a perpetrator for any length of time is considered, on most worlds,\n\nOut on the frontier, there is a great deal of work for everyone, and insufficient populations to carry it out. On colonies that can afford it, robots are popular in mining and farming, with village and towns often banding together to purchase multibots to help out at farms on a rotating basis. Most jobs are in primary industries, either farming, mining, or fishing, with a small technical elite that manages the operations of the various corporate\n\n4\n\nSmall Colonial City Population: 7100\n\nElevation:1700 metres above mean sea level 19\n\n4\n\n7\n\n3 5\n\n2 1\n\n15 8\n\n9 10 6\n\n11 16\n\n12\n\n13 14\n\n18 GeoScience TM-56 Orbital Survey Altitude: 139 kilometre\n\n17\n\nLocations 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.\n\nCentral Park Colonial Offices College/Training Offices Apartment Tower (576 small units) 6.

The service industry consists of businesses that support these primary resource industries, or small owner-operated businesses that cater to personal needs, places like restaurants, bars, shops, and brothels. Wages in any of these businesses are high, but even then there is difficulty in finding staff. In general, the people who move out to a colony are not interested in working for someone else, so robots are available to fill many of these niches, in all service industries. Shop-bots, server-bots, and Dolls are quite common in larger towns and cities on the frontier. This presents the somewhat incongruous picture of a clapboard restaurant in a one-truck frontier town, with the owner’s 13-year-old son washing dishes by hand as she serves customers, while a 100,000 livre robot in the back does the cooking. Such a robot can pay for itself in only a few years, however, if business is good.\n\n50 m\n\nThe rigid hierarchy of survival on Cold Mountain, for instance, where it becomes conform or die, or the relaxed attitudes of Dunkelheim to most victimless crimes, are exceptions to these generalities. Colonies grow, change, and adapt to local conditions, and in doing so develop their own unique societies. Some sociologists have even described human colonisation as a vast experiment, which is even now bearing some fascinating fruit. Farming and mining are the primary industries driving colonisation efforts. Both allow the colony to grow internally, and provide products for trade. Early colonies concentrate on subsistence farming and mining, to support their own internal needs. At the same time corporate investors provide pressure for profits, which in most colony worlds comes from the exploitation of natural resources, like\n\n5\n\nmining, fishing, lumber and exotic flora and fauna, whether as food or, more commonly, for cosmetic and pharmaceutical purposes. The luxury markets of the Core provide the best initial payoff for new colonies, which can provide further financing to exploit their resources, and increase agricultural output.\n\nCorporate mining, on the other hand, makes use of a great deal of heavy equipment, much of it built elsewhere and transported to the target world. Strip mining, or open-pit mining, is the most cost-effective method for these corporations, and they are generally good about restoring the land once the mine is played out. It is worth noting that by the time a mine is shut down, all the heavy equipment is not worth the cost of transporting it offworld. It is moved to a new mine site, sold off to local concerns, or abandoned in place.\n\nThe primary goal of colonial agriculture is to provide the colony with enough food to feed itself. Since food can only be exported to other colony worlds, and not the markets of the Core, it does not have the income potential that mining and other types of resource extraction have.\n\nOther natural resources in demand by the Core are keragenous materials, once known as fossil fuels. While not much in demand as fuel, oil, natural gas, and coal are in demand as chemical stock and synthetic material components. Natural gas is still used as a vehicle fuel on the Frontier, when available, and some colonies burn coal for heat and power but this is not common, and is generally subject to disapproval and censure from Core governments and Foundations. To reduce shipping costs, these materials are often subject to on-world processing and refinement before they are shipped off-world.\n\nMost agriculture on colony worlds is some variation of western mechanised agriculture. Since most crops have to be engineered and adapted for local conditions, the seeds are often modified for increased yields as well. Only in the poorest of colonies, typically those deliberately kept poor and backwards by their overlords, will there be much in the way of human or animal-based manual farming. Manchuria is the exception, as they typically do not have the manpower problems on their colonies that most other nations have, and so can use cheap workers for labour-intensive operations, like growing rice and quinoa.\n\nWater is a concern on some worlds like Dunkelheim and Ellis. Deep drilling can tap into underground reservoirs, but on dry worlds this is fossil water, unlikely to be replenished. Other water recovery techniques include condensers, which collect water from the atmosphere using cooled surfaces. In many areas, batteries are charged up during the day by solar collectors, and then used to power the cooling system to collect water at night. This technique can supply water for personal needs, and can replenish the losses in hydroponic systems, but it usually cannot provide sufficient water for agriculture. On most worlds, however, careful colony siting will allow access to abundant surface water, which can be easily filtered and purified. On desert worlds that still have ice caps, irrigation pipelines can be run from polar ice, though this is an expensive option. The most common solution to the settlement of water-poor worlds in the use of DNA modification to the settlers, along with adapted crops and animals suited to the climate. Geo-engineering and terraforming have their place, but extreme caution must be used, lest worse damage is caused.\n\nMost crops are grain and cereal crops for local consumption, along with oil-producing crops for consumption and as a source of heavy fuel. Agricultural waste is used in biomass reactors to produce fuel and fertilizer, or else is fermented, with similar results. Protein requirements on colonies are usually met by livestock, rather than the power and nutrient-intensive centralised carniculture vats used in the Core. For new colonies, much of that protein comes from small animals, in particular guinea pigs, rats, and rabbits, along with chickens and turkeys. Dairy comes from goats initially, until the colony can support large livestock. Pigs are rare on colony worlds, largely because of the stigma around hyperpigs, which may be on the verge of sentience thanks to injudicious genetic engineering. Another common source of protein on the Frontier is fish from aquaculture. Fish can be raised in tanks, or in small lakes or ponds provided they are cleansed of local life. Catfish are the preferred fish for colonial aquaculture, as they aid in wastewater cleanup and reclamation serving multiple roles. Other common fish include tuna, salmon, and several types of carp, including the common, bighead and blood carps. Shellfish are also often cultured for human consumption.\n\nAvailability Frontier\n\nof\n\nGoods\n\non the\n\nMost colony worlds do not have the ability to produce the equipment found in this volume. However, it can still be made available, though at a sharp increase in price, and often a considerable delay while it is ordered from off-world.\n\nMines developed to meet domestic colonial needs tend to be small and specialised, using robots and other technologies to reduce manpower requirements. These small mines are usually either shallow or deep shaft mines. Shallow mines general go no deeper than 200 metres, while deep shaft can penetrate several kilometres down, given sufficient time. These small-scale mines are targeted at either necessary commodities for the colony, like iron and aluminium, or high-value elements like tantalum for the export market.\n\nThe availability of any goods or item of equipment is a Difficult (-2) Broker check using INT. There is a DM equal to the TL difference between the colony world and the TL of the item. Surveillance equipment has a further -2 DM, and military equipment a further –4 DM.\n\n6\n\nDeep Shaft Mine\n\nElevation:2200 metres above mean sea level\n\n5\n\n10\n\n9\n\n3\n\n8 2\n\n7\n\n11\n\n6\n\n4\n\n1\n\nTrilon GeoSys-18 Operational Monitoring Altitude: 107 kilometre\n\nLocations 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.\n\nMine Head Miner’s Quarters Waste Management Solar Power Module Vehicle Park Secondary Mine Shaft\n\nScale 20 m\n\n7.

Typically, at least half of this amount has to be paid in advance. Note that in the case of farming or mining equipment, the owning government can subsidise the price, to an amount depending on the Tier level.\n\nCost likewise depends on the Tech Level difference, with 30% added to the price of the object per TL difference between the colony and the TL of the item. Typically, at least half of this amount has to be paid in advance.\n\nTier Subsidy for Farming and Mining Equipment\n\nOff World Purchasing If an item is not available locally, it can be brought in from offworld, though the time and expense is often prohibitive. Time required is a minimum of two months, plus 1 week per TL difference between the colony TL and the TL of the item.

Pathfinder teams, we plan and build the colony, mark out homesteading plots, put up barracks and dorms, offices and warehouses. We build the first roads, run power lines and get everything ready for the first waves of colonists. Survey team stays for maybe 5-10 years, then when they leave, we have maybe five years before the first colonist arks arrive.\n\nOnce we got all the parts, the rest went well. Took us two years to get the base set, and another two to prepare all the test sites. This one is a Pathfinder outpost, where more teams like ours will examine the world as a possible colony site, test the feasibility of farming, and develop any symbiotes and tweak the basic colonist DNA modification package. Not too long ago, they would have developed a new one, specially tailored to this world. Since the moratorium, that sort of thing isn’t allowed anymore. After four years, they pulled us out, and the Union moved its own Pathfinder teams in. We had a week to brief them before we were out of there, and off to the French Arm.\n\nI have a degree in xenobiology, served eight years in the Army Corps of Engineers, then went back and got an Associate Degree in civil engineering. The Life Foundation bought my contract the moment I left university, and I signed on for ten years.\n\nMy second five-year run was for the new Life Foundation complex on Sans Souci. Even at the equator, that was not a warm planet. We built a complete town for the Foundation, with row after row of barracks and dorms. They called the complex the Redoubt. Room there for thousands of people. Then, in our last year there, we were instructed to mothball the place. We put everything in storage, sealed the buildings and tamped the pile. Saw lots of Zapamoga folks there, though, filling the warehouses with freeze-dried food.\n\nMy first five years was on the Pathfinder team for a new outpost on Eriksson. The Foundation contracted out an entire team to the Scandinavian Union. We built a central complex for them, with a couple of big concrete buildings and a bunch of modules that they dropped with aeroshells. We turned the aeroshells into garage spaces and warehouses, and, at their insistence, a great big hall that could hold a thousand people. We called it the Althing.\n\nThey’re talking about shutting the team down, now. There aren’t a lot of new worlds being opened to colonisation any more, and opening up worlds is what a Pathfinder does. I’ve got my back pay from the Foundation, and my military pension. I’ll be fine, maybe find myself somewhere nice to settle down. I hear that new American world of Avalon has some warm places. The Americans or the Nigerians might have some work for me. Might even arrange to bring my team along. I’m not the only one whose contract is coming up.\n\nOne of the team ran afoul of something the survey team had called a gargantula, a venomous, hairy, ten-legged thing that was actually some kind of pseudo-mammal. Within moments of being bitten, he went into severe anaphylactic shock, and even a massive anti-histamine dose did nothing to help him. He died a few minutes later. Autopsy showed that he had an allergy to one of the long-chain proteins the gargantula had in its venom. The anti-histamine just sped things up, killed him quicker, which, in retrospect, was probably a good thing.\n\nThe Colonisation Process\n\nEverything that could go wrong did go wrong. The first shipment of spraycrete wouldn’t cure properly, and we wasted a good month running that problem down, and another two months before we could get a fresh shipment in from Kanata. The fuel cells were contaminated, and we had to flush them out, and order new palladium electrodes. These had to come all the way from Chengdu, so we lost a few more months. We spent that time building roads and running power lines. At least all our heavy equipment worked. Once we got the power plant up and running, we concentrated on finishing the buildings, which were just shells. We ran one habitat module as ours, feeding it from the fuel cell on one of our ATVs. That gave us power for cooking, for the toilets, and for heating water, and not much else. We slept in tents for those first few months.\n\nThere are several stages to the colonisation process, from initial discovery, through orbital and surface surveys, to pathfinders and colonisation. Discovery Initial exploration and discovery of worlds that may possibly be suited to colonisation begins at interstellar distances. Stellar surveys determine which systems have worlds that may be suitable. Once those systems have been identified, Very Large Array (VLA) optical telescopes, either on planets or moons, or in space, scan them for visual confirmation of the worlds. At interstellar ranges, the telescopes can determine if an atmosphere is present, if there is water, and a few other basic details.\n\n9\n\nOrbital Survey\n\nDisease\n\nOnce that information is gathered, an initial survey vessel is dispatched to do a thorough survey from space. This survey can include dropping robots from orbit, but usually does not include a manned ground survey. From orbit, the survey team can precisely determine the world’s UWP, along with specific details like atmospheric composition, pressure, landforms, possible resources, presence of life, and detailed surface maps. This phase takes about two months of orbital work before the team returns to provide information to plan the next phase: Exploration.\n\nMost alien microbes, especially viruses, find it difficult to prey on human beings. They are quite dependent on the genetic structure of their host, and the chances of a successful combination are remote. Bacteria are slightly more effective at infecting terrestrial hosts, though even then there are significant compatibility gaps. Unfortunately, both viruses and bacteria mutate and evolve very quickly. With the ability to copy genetic sequences, viruses can quickly adapt to new opportunities. When they do, their human subjects will often have little or no immunity to the newlyemergent disease. Human genetic-engineering techniques can rapidly develop vaccinations, and eventually effective treatments, but such capability is often not available on most colony worlds. For this reason, the various colonial powers have developed rapid-response lab ships, which operate as mobile hospitals and research centres.\n\nSurface Survey\n\nArmed with the information from the orbital survey, the next step is to start landing teams to do a thorough exploration of the planet with an eye to colony sites and exploitable resources. The initial teams identify areas of interest for follow-on exploration, as more personnel are committed to exploring the planet. This phase will precisely determine the world’s Natural Resources, Biosphere, and Habitability characteristics. In depth exploration will take decades, and extend long after the world is actually settled.\n\nAs long as the founding nation or organisation could control trade with a colony, then mercantilism functioned well. However, on worlds with multiple colonies, the control of trade was harder to enforce. The rise of the Libertine traders, freight-carrying starships beholden to no nation or corporation, spelled the end of mercantilist policies. While the Libertines rarely traded with the Core and its rigid web of rules and import/export controls, they found ready markets in the various colonies and interstellar micro-nations for each other’s goods and materials. They found markets with Tier 4 nations as well, which lacked access to colonial resources and markets, but could obtain ships to rendezvous with the Libertines and trade Core-produced goods for off-world resources. It was through Iran, for instance, that MuleCorp-produced vehicles were imported to Earth from Hermes, though the United States had refused to allow the sale of the off-world produced vehicles on Earth. They found a ready market as inexpensive work-horses in the many Tier 4 nations, cutting into the markets of many Tier 2 and Tier 3 nations. In 2258, Iran built Meetpoint Station, a deep-space outpost and warehousing facility in cooperation with Indonesia. Meetpoint quickly became a popular destination for Libertine families and many micro-nations, as it facilitated trade with Earth without having to deal with the multiple bureaucracies, especially France and Russia, which controlled access to Earth-orbital space and much of the remainder of the Solar System.\n\nPathfinder\n\nThe pathfinder teams go in with the goal of building the colony. They may be the initial settlers themselves, or may be part of dedicated professional teams that build colonies and infrastructures. Pathfinders determine the best sites for a colony, and in consultation with the colony’s sponsors, choose the best location, depending on the sponsor’s requirements. The pathfinder teams will then build the colony site, develop infrastructure, perform detailed mineral surveys, and plant the first crops. By the time the pathfinders are finished, the colony should be in a position to support and house the first groups of colonists. There will be housing, which could be modular dormitories, or tents assembled from aeroshell parachutes, offices, power, and even some fresh food. A road infrastructure will exist to permit colonists to travel to the land plots, or mines, where they will work. Pathfinders are explorers, engineers, and scientists, all in one.\n\nTypes of Colonies\n\nColonies are established for a variety of reasons. National pride, resource extraction, farming, relocation of non-conformists, all have their place in the creation of off-world settlements. Certain things are expected of all colonies, however, no matter the reasons for their establishment.\n\nWith the collapse of mercantilist policies in the 2230s, many nations found themselves in economic doldrums as their colonies started doing more trade with other colonies. This was most prevalent in the French and Chinese Arms, with their heavy mixtures of nations and cultures. Even in the American Arm, however, the demand for goods from Earth dropped as the maturing colonies started making their own finished products. The only market that really remained strong was for high-tech consumer products and robotics, neither of which could be\n\nAll colonies are expected, at some point, to be self-supporting to the extent that they do not require additional investment from the founding nation, foundation, or corporation. Ideally, the colony should be a net gain for the founder, both by being a source of raw materials and by being a market for the home nation’s manufactured goods. This brand of colonialism, called mercantilism, was the central focus for most colonies founded between 2130 and 2230.\n\n10\n\nResource Post 1\n\n3\n\n9\n\n2\n\n10 4\n\n7 8\n\n5 6\n\n13 12\n\n7 7 SSV-21-C Marie Celeste GeoCam-5 Altitude: 218 km\n\n14\n\n15\n\n11\n\nElevation: 391 m above mean sea level\n\nLocations 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.\n\nSawmill Logging Walker Lumber Solar Power Module Waste Management Greenhouses Houses Abbatoir Module\n\n9.

These worlds tended to be further out, with longer, more tenuous supply chains, and so the first priority of these colonies was to be self-sufficient in food as quickly as possible, even if that meant ignoring their industrial development and resource-extraction industries. This often led to these colonies being less sophisticated than earlier ones, as the priority was given to food production rather than technologyintensive operations like mining or manufacturing. Another factor in these later colonies was the heavier involvement of corporate concerns and even corporate sponsorship to help defray some of the costs. This can be seen in the Brazilian and Canadian colonial projects in particular.\n\nThere was a lull in new colonisation after 2230, but things started to pick up again in the 50s and 60s as smaller nations instituted their own colonisation programs. Unlike the mercantilist colonies that preceded them, these colonies had different rationales. For most of them, the primary purpose was prestige, to prove that they could ‘play with the big kids.’ Indeed, the main point of difference between Tier 3 and Tier 4 nations is the possession of extra-solar colonies. The economic development of these colonies was of secondary importance,\n\n11\n\nWhile national pride may have fuelled the drive to create these colonies, other concerns also fed into these ventures. In the mid 2200’s, nations were increasingly consolidating their hold on their citizens, all in the name of stability. However, it was recognised that, in all nations and cultures, there were people who just couldn’t conform, and would constantly be a source of friction in society. At the same time, it was often exactly that sort of person who had the drive and ambition to accomplish great things. Colonies were created, among other reasons, to provide an outlet for these people, a place where they could go to remove themselves from the society that so chafed them, but at the same time be available to that society, should there be need.\n\nWorlds in the life zone are very likely to contain life as long as they have some sort of atmosphere.\n\nBiomass\n\nBiomass is the first constituent of Biosphere. Biomass is an aggregate of the total mass of all life on the planet. On Earth, for example, the total biomass is some 500 billion tons. The Roll to determine Biomass is 2d6 + modifiers from the table below. A result of 0 means traces of life, while less than 0 indicates no life at all. The result of the biomass roll is the exponent value for the number of millions of tons of biomass. A result of 1 is 1 x 101, or 10 million tons of Biomass. Spread over an entire world, this is a scant amount of life. A result of 7, however, would mean 1 x 107 million tons, or 10 trillion tons. Earth has a Biomass of 8. If desired, the multiplier for the exponent can be determined by rolling 2d6-2 (minimum value of 1).\n\nHowever, not even the drive for prestige, or the need to provide a societal relief valve, could keep up with the long-term costs of settling other worlds. For this reason, colonisation has slowed markedly from its heyday, and it’s generally only the latecomers like Nigeria, or the old stalwarts like France, with resources to burn, that are continuing the push for new colonies. For the corporations, for many nations, the future is not with the colony, but with the outpost; purpose-built, largely disposable, and designed for profit.\n\nBiomass modifies base encounter rolls for the planet. Planets with a greater Biomass are more likely to produce an encounter. Modify the base encounter roll by the following modifiers.\n\nBiomass Base Encounters Biomass 0 or lower 1-2 3-6 7-8 9 10+\n\nColony Design\n\nThis section is designed to help referees design new colonies, whether as part of an on-going campaign, for fun, or to design a custom universe. This section is designed to supplement the social portion of the World Creation rules from the Traveller Core Rulebook. Use the rules here to generate Size, Transport Net, Telecom Net, Population, Government Type, Law Level and Tech Level, and then determine the UCP based on those numbers. Creating a colony or outpost is very much like creating a character. Planets have base characteristics that are used much like characteristics in character generation.\n\nCondition Outer Life Zone Trace Atmosphere Very Thin Atmosphere Thin Atmosphere Dense Atmosphere Exotic Atmosphere Corrosive Atmosphere Insidious Atmosphere Dense, High Atmosphere Thin, Low Atmosphere Hydrographics 0 Hydrographics 6-8 Hydrographics 9-A Roasting Hot Cold Frozen Inner Life Zone\n\nB a s e C h a r ac t e r i s t i c s\n\nBase Characteristics are factors of the planet that determine the attractiveness and ease of settlement. They are Biosphere, Natural Resources, Habitability, and Compatibility.\n\nBiosphere\n\nBiosphere is an aggregate concept based on biomass (aggregate mass of all living creatures), biodiversity (number of species), and complexity. A low Biosphere in this case could mean a world with a great deal of biomass, but it is all undifferentiated singlecelled organisms, like a planet of yeast. Or it could represent a world with a relatively small number of large, complex organisms. Biosphere represents whether life is present and how complex it is. This is based in part on the animal generation system in Supplement 11: Animal Encounters, and while recommended, is not necessary for the purposes of this design system.\n\n12\n\nEncounter DM -8 -4 0 +2 +4 +8\n\nDM -2 -4 -3 -2 +2 -2 -4 -6 -2 -4 -4 +1 +2 -4 +2 -2 -4 +2\n\nBiodiversity\n\nThe next component of Biosphere is Biodiversity, the number of different species found on the planet. The roll to determine Biodiversity is 2d6-7, plus the Biomass, above. The result is the approximate number of species, in millions. Earth, in this case, would have a Biodiversity of 8, as there are 8.7 million species on this planet. Biodiversity 0 or lower 1-2 3-6 7-8 9 10+\n\nBiodiversity Minimal Minor Active Diverse Teeming Deathworld\n\nHabitability Modifiers -4 -2 +1 +2 0 -4\n\neither way, including creating some species that are completely incompatible with others on the same world. Compatibility can be used with the rules for Food Synthesisers.\n\nCompatibility\n\nRoll 2d6+7, and subtract Biosphere, plus modifiers from the table below. Condition Atmosphere 10(A) Atmosphere 11(B) Atmosphere 12(C) Tainted Atmosphere\n\nDM -6 -8 -10 -1\n\nNotes Exotic Corrosive Insidious\n\nNatural Resources\n\nBiocomplexity\n\nThe last component of Biosphere is Biocomplexity. Here, the focus is on structural complexity of the organisms. Biocomplexity is generated by rolling 2d6-7, and adding Biodiversity. Biocomplexity Description 0 or lower Small populations of single-celled organisms; bacteria and protozoans, typically hidden 1-2 Primitive plants and multi-cellular animals; algae, mosses, fungi, sponges, and similar creatures 3-6 Abundant plant diversity, some lower animals; insects, amphibians predominate 7-8 Many species of animals; social/hive forms appear 9+ Hive forms dominate\n\nNatural Resources represents the economic potential of the world’s natural resources, whether from mining, petrochemicals, agriculture, or some other source. Natural Resources is determined as follows; Natural Resources = 2d6-7 + World Size (minimum 0) + Modifiers (below) Characteristic Atmosphere 0-1 Atmosphere 4-9 Hydrographics 4-7 Hydrographics 9-A Biodiversity 7+\n\nDM -2 +1 +1 -2 +1\n\nExplanation of Natural Resources\n\nBiosphere\n\nBiosphere, which is used in the colony generation process, is an average of Biomass, Biodiversity, and Biocomplexity. Add these three values up, and divide by three.\n\nCompatibility\n\nAside from the halogen world of Oiseau, all life so far encountered has been carbon/oxygen based. However, the chemical arrangement of that life has varied wildly, from nearly identical on Tirane, to radically different on Aurore. In general, the more complex the planet’s Biosphere is, the less likely it is to be compatible. The higher the Compatibility, the more compatible the life forms are. Results of 0 or less are completely incompatible, with different chiralities (handedness) of the proteins, fats, and complex sugars, or else a different biochemical basis, like silicon rather than carbon. The Compatibility Rating is a general measure of the majority of the life forms on a planet. The actual compatibility of individual species can vary by as much as 1d6\n\n13\n\nNatural Resources represent exploitable resources on a planet. This does not include chemicals from life-forms or bio-protein sources, but does factor in how life can change a world’s chemical makeup. A colony’s Mining is limited by the world’s Natural Resources, and can be no more than 1 higher. So a colony on a world with Natural Resources 8, Mining can never be more than 9. Natural Resources Description 0-1 Minimal resources, primarily common ores 2-4 Some resources, common ores and light metals 5-7 Significant resources, including bioactive materials and heavy metals 8-10 Radioactives present, along with some fossil fuel resources 11+ Abundant resources of all types, including petrochemicals\n\nThis represents the world’s natural resources when the planet is first surveyed. This value declines by 1 for every 100 years of exploitation at maximum Mining.\n\nO t h e r P l a n e t a r y D e s i g n F ac t o r s (Optional)\n\nHabitability\n\nThis determines how comfortable the world is for humans. Habitability is a combination of several factors, including temperature, air pressure, surface gravity, and the abundance of local life forms. A colony’s Agriculture is limited by the Habitability, and can be no more than 1 higher. So a world with a Habitability of 5 could have an Agriculture no higher than 6.\n\nAsteroid Belts A system has an asteroid belt on a roll of 6+ on 2d6, with the following modifiers: Condition Gas Giant present in system Multiple Star System\n\nThe base Habitability is 10. Both Earth and Tirane have ratings of 10, while other colonies are modified by the following table. Condition Atmosphere Hydrographics 0 Hydrographics 1-3 Hydrographics A Roasting or Freezing Hot or Cold Micro Gravity Low Gravity Normal Gravity High Gravity Extreme Gravity King’s Gravity\n\nDM -1 per point of difference from ideal Atmosphere of 6 -4 -2 -2 -4 -2 -4 +2 0 -2 -4 -6\n\nModifier +1 +2\n\nA roll of 9+ indicates two asteroid belts, while 12 or higher indicates 3.\n\nNotes Maximum DM of -4\n\nAsteroid Resources: Asteroids are often the site of extensive mining operations. An asteroid belt has Natural Resources equal to 2d6-7, plus the mainworld’s Natural Resources. If the system has more than one asteroid belt, then the first one generated is at -2 to Natural Resources, while the other Belts are at -4 to Natural Resources. Additional Planets While this system is not intended to be a design every detail of a solar system, the knowledge of the presence of other planets can be useful, as least for descriptive purposes.\n\n0.0 – 0.1 G 0.2 – 0.7 G 0.8 – 1.4 G 1.5-1.9 G 2-2.9 G 3+ G\n\nRoll 2d6-2, with the result being the number of additional planets in the system. If the system was already determined to have a gas giant, then roll 1d6-2 (minimum roll of 0) for the number of additional gas giants in the system. If further detail is desired for the character of the gas giant, roll on the following table\n\nThis will give the world’s base Habitability, which is further modified by the Biodiversity. Habitability can be increased through successful terraforming, and adjusted by DNA modification. DNA modification will add +4 to the Habitability of a world. For example, Cold Mountain has the following: normal gravity, atmosphere UWP of D, for -4 (maximum DM), no modifiers for Hydrographics, and the temperature is normal. However, it is a Deathworld for a further -4, for a total Habitability of 2. It is not a particularly attractive world. Giving the colonists the appropriate DNA modification adds 4 to the Habitability for the purpose of attracting colonists.\n\n2d6 Roll 2-3 4-6 7-9 10-11\n\nGas Giant Type Gas Dwarf Small Gas Giant Large Gas Giant Super jovian\n\n12\n\nBrown Dwarf\n\nComparison 3 or more Earth masses Neptune or Uranus Jupiter or Saturn Up to 12 times Jupiter’s mass At least 13 times more massive than Jupiter\n\nThe remaining planets can be designed using the normal Traveller system, if desired, and then placed in orbits around the star. Start at Orbit 0, and place planets, counting outward.\n\nThe characteristics of the UCP are created during colony generation, and can change from term to term.\n\nIf the star has companions, they, too may have their own planets. If the distance between the stars is known, then stars at least 10 AU (Orbit 6) from the primary may have their own planets. Roll 1d6-1 for the number of planets. If the distance is not known, then roll 2d6-1 for each companion star, and place them in that Orbit, re-rolling any duplications.\n\n14\n\nOrbit Number 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\nDistance From Primary, in AU 1.10 - 0.20 0.2 - 0.40 0.40 - 0.80 0.70 - 1.30 1.3 - 2.6 2.6 - 5.2 5.2 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 40 40 - 80 80 - 160 160 - 320 320 - 640\n\nExample\n\nCondition Planet has moons of size 2 or greater Planet is a moon of a gas giant Planet is the moon of a super jovian or brown dwarf Planet is in orbit 0, 1, or 2\n\nMercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto Sedna\n\nTectonics is an optional characteristic, but if desired, Tectonics of 8 or higher can reduce a planet’s Habitability by 2. Tectonics indicates not just the level of tectonic activity on a planet, but also the number of major tectonic plates. This can be incorporated into planetary maps if desired.\n\nMoons Moons can simply provide additional fodder to describe a world, or they may have effects in their own rights. To determine if a world has any moons, a few factors come into play. The first is whether the world is a terrestrial planet or a gas giant. The second is its proximity to any asteroid, and the third is the planet’s Orbit Number. Terrestrial Planets The base roll to determine if a moon is present is 2d6-7. Any roll above 0 is the number of moon present. There is a +1 DM per Orbit Number for this roll, with a further +2 if the planet is adjacent to an asteroid belt. Gas Giants The base roll for a gas giant is 2d6+2, with the main DMs as terrestrial planets, above, along with the size DMs, below. Gas Giant Type Gas Dwarf Small Gas Giant Large Gas Giant Super jovian Brown Dwarf\n\nDM +2 +4 +6 +2\n\nModifier -2 0 +2 +4 +6\n\nTo determine if a region suffers from tectonic activity like earthquakes or volcanoes, roll 2d6-7, + Tectonics. If the roll is over 12, then some sort of activity occurs within a 24 hour period, within 100 kms of the area. The extent of the activity is up to the referee. For example, the adventurers are travelling across the High Desert on Aurore in sealed vehicles. Aurore orbits a brown dwarf, and has Tectonics of 14. Once per day, the referee rolls 2d6 -7, +14, to score higher than 12. On day three, he rolls a total of 16, and determines that a light earthquake shakes the characters’ vehicles, doing no damage but providing an example of the dangers inherent in travel on Aurore.\n\nTides\n\nTides are determined by the position of a moon (or moons) in their orbits around a world. A moon causes a tide in large bodies of liquids equal to its Size. Multiple moons cause multiple tides. Each moon causes one high tide per day. On worlds with multiple moons, they will occasionally align to causing extreme tides, adding their Sizes together to get the size of the high tide. For any given period of time equal to twice the number of planetary moons, in months, the extreme tides will occur.\n\nColony Design\n\nFurthermore, if the gas giant is in Orbit Number 2-4, or is a super jovian or brown dwarf, then it may have habitable worlds of its own. Roll 2d6, with a roll of 12 indicating that the gas giant has a habitable moon. This may be the system mainworld at the referee’s discretion.\n\nTectonics\n\nA tectonically-active world is much more likely to have exciting surface features like rift valleys, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Tectonics provides a relative measure of this activity, and can used as a general roll to determine if volcano’s or earthquakes have an effect. Tectonics is generated by rolling 2d6-7 + World Size, with the following DMs:\n\n15\n\nMuch like character creation, colony also use terms as the standard time unit. Terms in colony design are ten years, rather than the four years of character creation. These initial design steps will determine the starting point for the colony. Initial Colony Design Steps 1. Generate Initial UCP 2. Choose Colony Type 3. Roll For Initial Features 4. Record Initial Features and adjust UCP accordingly\n\nInitial UCP\n\nThe initial UCP of a colony is determined by the Tier level of the founding nation, whether it is instead a corporate colony, and by the base characteristics of Natural Resources and Habitability.\n\n4 5 6 7 or more\n\nThe Inca Republic\n\nThe Inca Republic is nominally a Tier 3 nation, due to its possession of extrasolar colonies. However, given the poverty and corruption endemic to the Republic, for purposes of creating colonies, the Republic is considered a Tier 4 nation.\n\nInterface Type: Tier 1 nations begin with Interface C, Tier 2 nations begin with Interface D, Tier 3 colonies begin with Interface E, and Tier 4 colonies do not have local orbital interfaces. Colony Size: The initial Size of a colony is based on the Tier Level and Habitability, as per the table below. If it is a corporate colony, reduce the size by 1 (minimum 0). Tier 1 1 2 3 4\n\nTier 2 0 1 2 3\n\nTier 3 0 0 1 2\n\nTier 4 0 0 0 1\n\nTier 1 2 2 3 4\n\nTier 2 1 1 2 3\n\nTier 3 0 0 1 2\n\nTier 1 1 1 4\n\nTier 2 1 1 2\n\nTier 3 1 1 1\n\n4 5 6 3\n\nAs a Tier 1 colony of France, it starts out with the following UCP: Interface D: (SSTO) Size: 3 Transportation Network: 3 Communications Network: 3 Population: 3 (1,000) Government: A roll of 4 on the Government Type table gives us a government code of 6 – captive government or colony. This does not modify the Law Level. Law Level: France has a Law Level of 9, so Auberjonois will have a Law Level of 4, without any other modifiers. Tech Level: From the base value of 6, 2 is added for the founding nation being France, for a starting Tech Level of 8.\n\nTier 4 0 0 0 1\n\nThe final UCP is D333364-8 Po\n\nPopulation 0 means that at the start of the colonisation process, there are just the caretakers and pathfinders at the colony site. Government Type: Roll on the table below to determine initial colony government type. This roll receives the following DMs: Manchuria +2, Incan Republic +2, Texas -2, Azania -3 1d6 1 or less 2 3\n\n2 4 6 0\n\nFor example, we are creating a new colony world, Auberjonois, on the French Arm. UWP is X685000-0.France, a Tier 1 nation, is establishing the colony. Auberjonois has a Natural Resource of 12, Habitability of 10, and Biodiversity 7. It is an ideal colony world.\n\nTransportation Network: The initial value of a colony’s transportation net is equal to 4 – National Tier Level. Transnational Corporations are considered Tier 2, while all other major corporations are Tier 3 Communications Network: The initial value of a colony’s communications net is equal to 4 – National Tier Level. Transnational Corporations are considered Tier 2, while all other major corporations are Tier 3 Population: The initial value for Population is based on the world’s Habitability and Tier Level. This Population number represents the initial colonisation effort. Corporate colonies reduce this starting value by 1, to a minimum of 0 Habitability 0-3 4-6 7-9 10+\n\n4 6 6 3\n\nLaw Level: Initial Law Level for all colonies is equal to the Law Level of the founding nation, minus five, and then modified as follows according to Government Type. Government Types of 3 and 6 add 2 to colony Law Level, Manchuria and Incan Republic add 3 to Law Level. Government Types of 0 and 2 subtract 2 from colony Law Level. Tech Level: The initial Tech Level of a colony, their manufacturing ability, is 6. Corporations of all sorts add +2 to the initial Tech Level. France puts more manufacturing and resources into a colony, and so adds +2, while Manchuria is more concerned with moving large numbers of people, so colonial manufacturing ability is not a priority for them, and subtract -2 from the Tech Level. The Incan Republic, already very poor on Earth, has few resources to put into extra-solar colonies, and so its colonies subtract 4 from the initial Tech Level. Trade Code: All new colonies start with the Trade Code of Poor (Po).\n\nThe UCP (Universal Colony Profile) is broken down into 7 characteristics plus trade codes.\n\nHabitability 0-3 4-6 7-9 10+\n\n6 6 6 3\n\nOver on the Chinese Arm, the Incan Republic is trying to colonise Nueva Mundo, with UWP XA93000-0.Natural Resources is 14, Biodiversity is 9 (Teeming), and Habitability is 4. Not such a great world. The Incan Republic is treated as a Tier 4 nation for colonising, despite it being nominally ranked a Tier 3 power.\n\nTier 4 0 1 3\n\nAs a Tier 4 colony, it begins with the following base values for its UCP:\n\n16\n\nInterface X: (None local) Size: 2 Transportation Network: 0 Communications Network: 0 Population: 0 Government: A roll of 6, +2 for the Incan Republic, gives a result of 8, for a Government type of 3, Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy. A roll of 4 on the Government Type table gives us a government code of 6 – captive government or colony. This modifies the colony’s Law Level by +2. Law Level: The Incan Republic has a Law Level of 9, so Nueva Mundo will have a Law Level of 4, plus 2 from Government type, and an additional +3 for being an Incan colony, for a total Law Level of 9, the same as the nation back on Earth. Tech Level: From the base value of 6, 4 is subtracted for the founding nation being the Incan Republic, for a starting Tech Level of 2 The final UCP is X200369-2 Po\n\nColony Type\n\nColonies are sited on worlds with a Habitability of at least 1. The initial Natural Resources, Biodiversity and Habitability characteristics are used to determine what type of colony can be built. These colony types are analogous to character careers\n\nFuel and Repair Services\n\nSpacecraft fuel is general available at any world with any sort of interface capability. Most worlds either have or manufacture liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, for use as cryogenic fuels. The hydrogen alone can be used to run conventional and airbreathing MHD thrusters. Solid rocket fuel is more rare, and only available on worlds of TL 9 or higher. Even the poorest colony will have a fuel station or two available, though the conventional model will take days or even weeks to crack enough fuel for a spacecraft. Most colony worlds can provide repairs to interface vessels equal to or lower than their own interface transport capability. They cannot, however, provide repairs for starships unless they have the Orbital Shipyard upgrade.\n\nInitial Colony Features Tier 1 and 2 nations roll three times on the following table, Tier 3 nations roll twice, and Tier 4 nations roll once. 1d6 1\n\nTier 1 Interface +1\n\nChoose one of the following.\n\n2\n\nTech +1\n\nResource Colony: These worlds are developed primarily for their resources (Natural Resources 7+ required). Agricultural Colony: These colonies are settled to provide food for their inhabitants, and possibly for export to other worlds. (Habitability 5+ and Biosphere 2+ required). Resettlement Colony: Whether a prison or simply a dumping ground for undesirables, resettlement colonies tend to be poorly supported. The population is usually put to work in resource extraction that is otherwise commercially unviable (Habitability 1+ required).\n\n3 4\n\nTransport Net +1 Size +1\n\n5 6\n\nComm Net +1 Comm Net +2\n\nTier 2 Interface +1\n\nTier 3 Interface +1 Tech +1 Transport Net +1 Transport Net Comm +1 Net +1 Comm Net Tech +1 +1 Size +1 -\n\nTier 4 Interface +1 Transport Net +1 Transport Net +1 -\n\nEach upgrade can only be received once. If an upgrade is rolled again, re-roll.\n\nRecord Starting Features and Adjust UCP\n\nInitial Features\n\nMost colonies will have some facilities in place before the first colonists arrive, built by pathfinder teams and corporate sponsors. Initial Interface Capabilities and Orbital Terminals Tier 1 nations begin with an orbital terminal that is equivalent to a Large Modular Outpost. Tier 2 nations have similar terminals, though with fewer modules. Tier 3 colonies start with orbital terminals equivalent to Small Modular Outposts, while Tier 4 colonies do not have any orbital infrastructure. Tier 1 nations start with spaceplane service (Interface C), while Tier 2 nations make do with SSTOs (Interface D). Most Tier 3 colonies rely on carried vehicles for interface transport, though disposable rockets are often used to launch bulk cargos (Interface Class E). Tier 4 worlds do not start with any kind of Interface transport at all.\n\n17\n\nThis is the starting UCP for the colony.\n\nContinuing Colony Generation\n\nThe process to develop a colony is based on the Planning Term, a ten-year unit of time. UCP is recorded at the start of a term, and is modified thereafter. Colonies have a maximum number of Planning Terms they can run, based on the Tier Level of the founding nation. For these purposes, France and the ESA nations are considered Tier 1 nations, and the Incan Republic is considered Tier 4. Colonies are created in a similar fashion to characters, using the Planning Term in place of the Career Term.\n\nTier Level 1 2 3 4\n\nMaximum Planning Terms 16 12 8 4\n\n1d6 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nBegin First Planning Term 1. All colonies roll on one of the Colonial Development, Upgrade, or Advanced Development tables, as desired. 2. Roll on the Government Type Shift table if necessary. 3.

Roll on the Event Table, and apply the results.\n\nGovernment Type 0 1 2 3 4 5+\n\nPlanning Term Development\n\nOnce each Planning Term, the colony rolls on the following table. As noted on the table, Upgrades can only be taken by a colony in its fifth or later terms, while advanced development can only occur in the eighth term or later, and even then only for Tier 1 and Tier 2 colonies.\n\n6\n\nGovernment Type Shift\n\nUpgrades (5th term and higher) Fission Plant Solar Power\n\nAdvanced Development (Tier 1 and 2 only, 8th term or higher) Interface Transport +1 Comm Net +1\n\nIndustry +1\n\nSolar Power\n\nManchuria -1 -2 -3 +2 +4 +6\n\nIncan Republic -1 -1 +2 +4 +6 +8\n\nTexas -1 0 -2 0 -4 0\n\nAll others 0 +2 0 -2 0 -4\n\nLaw Level Often, a change in Government Type will lead to a change in Law Level. The following table outlines the Law Level shifts from a changing government.\n\nIf a Base is rolled, roll on the Base table for type of base.

The DM for this roll is half of the relevant characteristic: Natural Resources for a mining colony, Habitability for an agricultural colony, and the higher of either for a resettlement colony.\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nMilitary Base Fusion Plant Terminal Industry +2 Improvement Transport +1 University\n\nResource Mining +1 Mining +1 Agriculture +1 Industry +1 Industry +1 Mining +1\n\nAgriculture Agriculture +1 Population +1 Agriculture +1 Industry +1 Mining +1 Agriculture +1\n\nRelocation Agriculture +1 Mining +1 Industry +1 Mining +1 No Effect No Effect\n\nTrade Codes Trade Codes are defined differently from the Traveller Core Rulebook, to represent the different nature of the 2300AD universe.\n\nGovernment Type Shift\n\nMost colonies start out as a captive government, governed by leaders appointed from the Core. Over time, however, that can change. Often such shifts will also bring changes to a colony’s Law Level. Note that any Government Type is possible.\n\nNote that all colonies start as Poor, but that code is removed once they start to develop their Mining and Agricultural resources.\n\nAdvancement\n\nColony advancement is similar to character advancement. In each Planning Term a colony may gain Ranks, with Rank 0 representing start-up colonies and Rank 6 representing the most developed and oldest colonies. Each given Rank may increase a colony’s characteristics or grant additional facilities. Agriculture, Mining, and Industry. Traits can modify advancement rolls as well as affect the colony’s trade codes.\n\nIf a Government Type shift is called for, consult the table below, modifying the current Government Type of the colony.\n\n18\n\nTrade Code Agricultural (Ag) Asteroid (As) Barren (Ba) Desert (De) Garden (Ga) High-Population (Hi) High-Technology (HT) Ice-capped (Ic) Industrial (In) Low Population (Lo) Low Technology (LT) Non-Agricultural (NA) Non-Industrial (NI) Poor (Po) Rich (Ri) Vacuum (Va) Water (Wa)\n\nRequirements Agriculture greater than UCP Population Size of 0, Atmosphere of 0, Hydrographics of 0 Uncolonised world Atmosphere 2+, Hydrographics 0 or 1 Planet Size 5+, Atmosphere 4-9, Hydrographics 4-8 UCP Population 7+ TL 12+ Atmosphere 0-1, Hydrographics 1+ Industry Trait higher than UCP PopulationigherHh UCP Population 4 or less Tech Level 6 or less If Mining and UCP Population are both greater than Agriculture Industry lower than UCP Population level by 2 or more Agriculture and Mining less than 4 Population 5+, Agriculture or Mining at least one higher than Population Atmosphere 0 or 1 Hydrographics 9 or A\n\nColony Survival: A colony is only in danger of dying if the Population falls to 1 or less from a higher level. If this happens, roll 2d6 for 8+ for the colony to attract additional investment with DMs by Tier level, as shown below. This will increase Population by +1. Each additional time this has to be done, though, there is a cumulative -2 DM to the roll to attract additional investment. If the colony fails to attract further investment, it fails, and the owning government or organisation either abandons it or sells off the assets at fire-sale prices. It then becomes an Outpost, with a low population of a few remaining stalwarts. Tier 1 2 3 4\n\nIndustry: Every 2 levels of Industry adds +1 to the colony’s Tech Level, with a maximum DM of +4. If Industry is higher than the world’s Population, then it gains the Industrial code. Agriculture: If Agriculture is higher than the colony’s Population, then the colony get the Agricultural code. Agricultural colonies are net exporters of food if they have inexpensive interface travel (Catapult or Beanstalk). Mining: If Mining and Population are both higher than Agriculture, then the world receives the Non-Agricultural code. Non-Agricultural colonies have to import food.\n\nApply the following DMs to the Advancement roll. Advancement Table Colony Type\n\nAdvancement DM Mining Colony DM +1 if Mining is 6 or more Agricultural Colony DM +1 if Agriculture is 6 or more Relocation Colony DM +1 if Population is 3 or more\n\nColony Mishaps Just as colonies can advance and grow in prestige, so too can they suffer setbacks and disasters. Colonising an alien world is not a safe thing to do, and setbacks are common in the first few Planning Terms. Colonies with 4 or more terms gain a +2 DM to Avoid Disaster.\n\nAdvancement DM DM +1 if Industry is 6 or more DM +1 if Population is 5 or more\n\nThe Advancement table details the upgrades and changes that occur at each Rank.

Colonial Improvement: Roll once on the Upgrade column on the Planning Term Development table Rebellion Quashed: Parent nation is able to bring sufficient force to bear that the colonial independence movement is stopped by force. Government type goes to 6 for the next Planning Term, and Law Level increases by 3. Civil War: The effects of civil reduce Population by 1 per Planning Term of the Civil War due to deaths, voluntary emigration, and refugees. Independence: TL drops by 2 without the support of the mother nation. Mining, Industry and Agriculture levels are all reduced by 2 as well. The newly independent colony is considered a Tier 4 nation, with Government Type and Law Level determined as per the rules in Traveller Core Rulebook, page 173. Note that this gives a far wider variety of government types than the normal rules for colonies, given here.

A Military Base of a Tier 1 or Tier 2 power would have all three (if applicable), plus training and recruitment facilities, supporting a base population of 5,000-20,000 on base. This number is independent of the actual colonial population. Tier 3 powers will have much smaller bases, typically only 2,000-4,000. Again, these are combinedarms units, but the Army is usually the largest component. Scientific: A scientific base is established by the owning colonial government, and is usually oriented towards solving environmental problems relating to the new world. These scientific bases are usually very focused in their research. On some worlds, the nature of the ecology demands further study, and these scientific bases have a much broader scope of investigation. Foundation: The purpose of a Foundation base depends on which Foundation organised it. A brief check through the Organisations chapter in the 2300AD Core Rulebook, (page 83) should provide some good ideas. Foundations are selfgoverning, and are not responsible to local governments, though most will cooperate with local authorities. Naval: A base for space-based military units. These bases are home to a segment of the owning nation’s space forces, and include training and maintenance facilities. Most have dedicated fighter squadrons for defence, and are often home to a few larger vessels as well. Tier 1 and 2 powers will have the largest bases, with staff levels in the hundreds or even thousands, and at least three squadrons of fighters. Tier 3 powers depend more on their ground-based facilities, but the space facilities will still house 100-200 personnel, usually along with a squadron of defensive fighters. Orbital Defence: An orbital fort, lightly armed with lasers and missiles, but heavily armoured and screened. AS opposed to naval bases, orbital defence installations are largely just weapon platforms. The are often the locus for constellations of defensive buoys, ringing the planet in shells of disposable weapon systems. Often serves as an orbital base for fighters or other small combat vessels. Asteroid Mining: Until recently, asteroid mining usually followed the establishment of colonies by several years or even decades.\n\n20\n\nRevolution Table 1d6 1 2\n\nTier 1 Negotiations result in colonial improvement.

Use the table below to determine the general class of outpost, then use the Outpost Generation system to generate the outpost or enclave itself. It will be completed by the end of the current Planning Term. The identity of the owning organisation or governments should be determined by the referee, based on the active nations and organisations in that Arm of space. 1d6 Roll 1-2 3-4 5 6\n\nOutpost Type Space Outpost Planetary (Other World) Planetary (Main World))ost the oost system to generate the outpost itself. It will be completed by the end of the current Planni Enclave (Planetary Outpost)\n\nA planetary outpost on the main world is usually established as far away from the other colonies and settlements as possible. These outposts will be controlled by another corporation, foundation, or nation active in the arm of space, which either\n\n21\n\nIndependence\n\nwish to not disturb the other settlements, or do not wish to be observed by them. An enclave, on the other hand, is usually established in close proximity to another settlement, and while it brings its own strengths to the arrangement, enclaves choose their locations in order to make use of the existing colony’s infrastructure.\n\nColonial Relationship Table\n\nUse this table to determine the relationship between the established colony and any new colony. Alternatively, determine the nationality of the new colony, and use the list of rivalries and allies on page 9 of the 2300AD Core Rulebook. DMs are -1 if original colony is French, -3 if original colony is Manchurian, +2 if original colony is a Foundation, -2 if original colony is a corporation. 1d6 Roll 1 or less 2 3 4 5 6 or more\n\nRelationship Actively Hostile Hostile Cool Neutral Friendly Very Friendly\n\nOutposts and Outpost Design Outposts are small-scale facilities established in deep space, on asteroids, or inhospitable worlds. They are typically not selfsufficient, intended to house staff and guests on a transient basis. Another type of outpost is the colony precursor, like the Manchurians have on Haifeng or the French have on Sans Souci. These facilities are designed as research bases to study the potential colony world. Before the ban on further DNA modification experimentation, these outposts would also have been used to develop a DNA modification tailored to the conditions and environment of that world. Now, they must content themselves with tweaks to the standard colonist package.\n\nbecome self-supporting, at least for food and other basic needs. For outposts, however, there is no such expectation. Outposts concentrate on specific goals and are supported externally. At best, many outposts will have small hydroponic gardens to supply limited quantities of fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs.\n\nWithin these broad parameters, some interesting variations have taken place. At Porte d’Enfer, on the desolate world orbiting close to Wolf 359, the deep buried outposts have acquired permanent populations and begun to spread underground. With access to abundant solar power from surface arrays, these outposts have impressive chambers full of hydroponic and carniculture vats, and can support a variety of light industries. The only foodstuff they need to import are the nutrients for the carniculture vats and luxuries. The outposts are rapidly becoming small towns, with permanent populations in addition to the transient space crews and short-contract miners. In nearby Bessieres, the industrial conglomerate that controls the system rotates workers out on a four-year contract basis. The costs of training new crew are preferred over the costs of permanent populations and the support costs associated with housing families. Managers and their families stay for longer terms, but they are effectively segregated from the workers.\n\nZero Gee Outposts Zero Gee Outposts are the most common type of outpost, and range in size from small 10-man mining stations, to the American FAR Stations, with crews in the hundreds, to industrial clusters like Bessieres, with its asteroid mines and gas giant scooping operation, and thousands of staff and workers.\n\nThere are three basic types of outposts. The first type is the zerogee outpost, either on asteroids or large space stations. If these outposts house more than 50-100 people for any length of time, they usually have provision for some sort of artificial gravity. The second type is a planetary outpost on an inhospitable or airless world. The third type is the outpost on a habitable planet, usually a precursor to colonisation. Outposts exist for a variety of reasons. Some are scientific bases, others are mining stations, some are simply way-stations and refuelling point on the way to other worlds, and some are survey stations set up to study a world in the prelude to a colonisation effort. One of the key characteristics of outposts that distinguish them from colonies is the transient nature of their populations. Additionally, there is an expectation that colonies can eventually\n\nOutpost populations are small, seldom numbering more than a few hundred. The largest outposts, like the industrial facility in the Bessieres system, can have populations of up to 10,000, rotating through habitats and factory stations on two-year terms. However, this size of outpost is quite rare.\n\nMost zero-gee outposts are mining support facilities or waystations, refuelling and discharge points for vessels on their way to somewhere else. Bessieres is a notable exception as the largest industrial facility in human space, even including the Core. Despite lurid stories in Core media, Frontier regions are not full of pirates and raiders. So, contrary to many a Core-produced entertainment feature, space stations and outposts are not armed to the teeth. In fact, until the recent Kaefer attack at the end of the French Arm, it was illegal for civilian facilities to be armed with military-grade weapons. Even since then, only the more distant outposts have been authorised by their governments to arm themselves and, even at that, weaponry permitted would barely afford the outposts to defend themselves, with point defense clusters and light lasers being the only weapons allowed. Civilian stations on the French and Chinese Arms are still not permitted to arm themselves, with the exception of the Texans. Weapons are available in self-contained modules, either the 30-ton Self-Defence module, or the 100-ton Space Superiority module, both produced by Trilon for the colonial market. The name of the 100-ton weapon module is misleading. Against stutterwarping spacecraft, even the most battle-hardened station does not stand a chance. Trilon named it the ‘Space Superiority module’ in order to boost sales.\n\n22\n\nAsteroid Mine\n\n1 5\n\n9\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4 6 7\n\n8\n\nMomotaro D500 1000mm lens at f5.6 Distance: 12.4km Digital Enhancement: x12 Locations 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.\n\nDrill Rig Mass Driver Loader Mass Driver Habitat Dome Hab Module\n\n6. 7. 8. 9.\n\nTransient Habs Transmitter Tower Asteroid Mining Ship Solar Power Arrays\n\nScale 10 m\n\nPlanetary Outposts Planetary outposts are typically located on worlds where resources are available for extraction, or else when a suitable locale does not exist elsewhere in the system. As asteroid mining is much more viable in general, these planetary outposts are becoming scarce. There are probably 50 or more of then scattered across human space, though many have been abandoned, like Chinese outpost at the end of the Chinese Arm.\n\nThe surface terminus of the shaft is capped with a dome, usually the surface access point, with vehicle storage and maintenance. Adjacent to this dome would be starship facilities. Power supply, in the form of solar array, fission or fusion plants, are usually located at the surface for civilian outposts, and in the case of the fission and fusion systems, are buried for protection. Military outposts locate their power plants in the deepest, most protected portion of the facility, generally at the bottom of the access shaft.\n\nPlanetary outposts on inhospitable worlds start as a collection of surface domes and Quonset-style buildings, usually made from reinforced spraycrete. If conditions are particularly hostile, the domes are buried under 5-10 metres of crushed rock, dirt or regolith. More permanent outposts are constructed around 8-16 metre wide shafts that extend 100-200 metres underground.\n\nArrayed around the access shaft will be dormitories and apartments, offices, shops, bars, and hydroponic and carniculture systems. Using plasma-borers to cut tunnels, the outpost can end up extending for kilometres under the surface, with schools, parks, and other recreation facilities. The surface habitats on Hochbaden are designed this way, though they are very large.\n\n23\n\nHabitable Planetary Outposts Outposts on habitable planets are usually composed of standard living modules, with an assortment of spraycrete structures, and other structures constructed from discarded aeroshells. These are the easiest outposts to build, though even here, the modules are typically sealed and filtered to protect against any possible airborne contaminants that may have been missed in initial surveys. These outposts are either scientific bases, built to study local conditions, or colony pathfinders, studying local conditions and preparing a permanent site. Barriers, including fences and walls, are common for a planetary outpost, as the capabilities of the local animal life are still unknown. Outpost Generation Rather than a full design system, the characteristics of outposts are randomly generated, based on the Tier of the nation that constructed them, and their location, whether in space, inhospitable planet, or hospitable planet. The following tables are used to generate outposts, or the characteristics of an outpost can simply be chosen. Space outposts are located away from a planet or significant moon. In some ways these are the simplest type of outposts to construct, as the major components can just be towed in place.\n\nZero Gee Outpost Type 1d6 1-4 5-6\n\nLocation Asteroid Station or Habitat\n\nAn asteroid base often starts out as just a base camp for the miners exploiting that rock. Successful strikes, however, can lead to the expansion of the base into the surface of the asteroid, carving out tunnels and habitation spaces as it goes.\n\nAsteroid Outposts 1d6 Tier 1 1 Surface Cluster 2\n\nDeep Site\n\n3\n\nDeep Site w/ gravity wheel Hollowed-out Asteroid Hollowed-out Asteroid w gravity wheel\n\n4 5\n\nTier 2 Surface Cluster Surface Cluster Deep Site Deep Site w gravity wheel Hollowed-out Asteroid\n\nTier 3 Surface Cluster Surface Cluster Surface Cluster Deep Site\n\nTier 4 Surface Cluster Surface Cluster Surface Cluster Surface Cluster Deep Site Deep Site\n\nSurface Cluster: A surface cluster is a collection of domes and habitat structures on the surface of an asteroid. They are short-lived, with few in operation after 20 or so years. Radiation\n\nprotection is minimal, with Lafarge screens to protect against ionizing radiation, and vacuum-rated spraycrete to protect against everything else. Population of surface clusters is typically low; 2d6 x 10 (x20 for Tier 1 sites). Deep Site: A deep asteroid site’s facility is carved into the material of the asteroid, burrowing into it for living space and safety. Plasma borers can easily carve corridors and rooms throughout an asteroid. The tunnels are almost always round in cross-section. Near the surface of a deep site will be a bay to dock spacecraft that allows easy access to the interior of the asteroid. Often these tunnels are the residue of past mining, with the miners residing in surface domes until they have enough tunnels carved out that they can move in. Deep sites have populations of 1d6 x 1d6 x 10 (x20 if was built by a Tier 1 or Tier 2 power or corporation). Deep Site with Gravity Wheel: A major problem with asteroid settlements is the low gravity. Even with Zero-G DNA modifications, providing artificial gravity enhances the effectiveness of the crew greatly. A deep site with a gravity wheel simply has a carved out a section of the asteroid large enough for a full torus, or several habitats. These are then rotated about an axis within the chamber, providing artificial gravity. Most such wheels spin at 1 rpm, with a diameter of 400 metres. This gives a felt gravity of 0.22 Gs in the wheel, enough to sleep comfortably, eat and exercise for maximum benefit. A deep site with a gravity wheel can have a population of 1d6 x 1d6 x 20 (x30 if built by a Tier 1 or 2 power or corporation). Hollowed Asteroid: In many ways a development of the deep site method, a hollowed-out asteroid has large interior volume carved out for habitation, and, more importantly, gardening and food production. Hollowed asteroids are very popular with belters and other Drifter groups. A hollow asteroid can have a population of 2d6 x 2d6 x 10 (x 20 if built by a Tier 1 or 2 power or corporation). Hollowed Asteroid with Gravity Wheel: Using a similar method to the deep site with gravity wheel, a gravity wheel is added to a carved out volume. This volume is typically kept in vacuum to conserve the energy required to spin it up and keep it spinning, but some outposts have the wheel in the hollowed-out space, and use the wheel’s motion to circulate air throughout the space. A hollow asteroid with a gravity wheel can have a population of 2d6 x 2d6 x 20 (x30 if built by a Tier 1 or 2 power or corporation). Spun Hollowed Asteroid: Very similar to large habitats, a spun hollowed asteroid is carefully carved and balanced so that the entire object can be spun to produce artificial gravity on the inside. A large outpost of this nature might be 800 m in diameter, and 2,000 m long. Gravity on the inside of the station would be a comfortable 0.44G, with an extremely large interior volume to work with. A spun hollow asteroid can have a population of 2d6 x 2d6 x 40, with a transient population of about the same size. These are major installations.\n\nSpace Station\n\nSpace-stations are purpose-built orbital structures, usually built elsewhere and transported into place. They have to be selfsufficient in environmental support systems, and should have emergency food and water supplies.\n\n24\n\nUnlike asteroid stations, free-flying stations are typically built as way-stations and collection points for resource extraction elsewhere in the system. So a Dalton-class mining ship 3 AUs away might use its mass driver to fling ores and materials to the station for collection, until a commercially-viable quantity can be assembled for interstellar transport.\n\nSpace Station Types 1d6 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nTier 1 Small Modular Large Modular Small Torus Small Torus Large Torus Small Habitat\n\nTier 2 Small Modular Small Modular Large Modular Large Modular Small Torus\n\nTier 3 Small Modular Small Modular Small Modular Large Modular Large Modular Large Torus Small Torus\n\nTier 4 Small Modular Small Modular Small Modular Large Modular Large Modular Large Modular\n\nSmall Modular: A small modular station is made from several standard 30-ton space station modules. These outposts have very small populations, and are not set up to properly handle much in the way of transients. A typical small modular outposts will have 10 + 2d6 modules, including a docking hangar, workshops, and a long-range communication modules. Population works out to around 3 people per module. Large Modular: Large modular stations are built from the same 30-ton modules as smaller stations, but add additional 50-ton and 100-ton storage and operational sections, along with a small spin habitat. This habitat is too small to house the entire staff, and is used as an exercise facility to help maintain long-term health. Large modular outposts have 30 + 3d6 30-ton modules, along with 2d6 50-ton modules, and 1d6 100-ton modules. The spin habitat is 50 tons, and has a recreation facility, and a small med bay, including provision to house staff who are having trouble with the weightless environment. Large modular stations can handle transients, and this type of station is often found as an orbital terminal around newly-settled colony worlds. Station population is 3 per module (no matter the size), along with 2d6 transients. Orbital terminals can see ten times that number of transients, and have extra 100-ton housing modules to handle them. Small Torus: A small torus, despite the name, is a very large station. The habitation ring is usually a full two kilometres or more in diameter, allowing it to create a full one-gee simulated gravity on the inside of the torus, while spinning at less than 1 rpm. These stations are built with long-term occupancy in mind, and are only seen in important systems. In addition to the habitation ring, a small torus has workshops, hanger bays, communications, and all the resources of a small town. A small torus has a population of several hundred to a few thousand, on a ring 100 metres wide and over 6 kilometres around. Station Arcture was a small torus-sized outpost, with significant space for expansion. Population is 3d6 x 100.\n\n25\n\nLarge Torus: Most Large Torus stations are a series of Small Torus-sized rings, stacked along the core of the station. The space station around Beta Canum and its Beanstalk is an example of this, simply a small space station that kept growing. An alternative is to build a much bigger station, and spin it at an even lower speed. These Large Torus stations can be five to six kilometres across, and blur into the size category of a Small Habitat. At five kilometres in diameter, the Large Torus could spin at just under 0.6 RPM to develop a full gee of gravity in the interior. The ring of a station like this would be about 200 metres wide, and over 15 kilometres around. Population could be in the thousands (3d6 x 500), with half that many again in transients. Small Habitat: There are only a few outposts of this size in human space, including the various American FAR Stations, the Shambhala tax haven at C1, and a few others. A typical habitat in this size range would be something like Far Station Five, which is a Bernal Sphere habitat. It consists of the central garden sphere, about 6 kilometres across, along with several habitation rings of a similar size to the Large Torus, above. A fusion power plant, docks, hangers, and warehouse modules round out the design, which can cost hundreds of millions, or even billions, of Livre. These habitats have populations ranging from a few hundred to many thousands.\n\nPlanetary Outposts\n\nSurface Facility, Vacuum World\n\nSurface facilities on vacuum worlds or moons face many challenges in their design and construction. While that have the advantage of gravity, they require vacuum-capable landers to ferry materials. They must also contend with extremes of heat and cold, radiation, and the possibility of micro-meteroid strikes. Most of these types of facilities are buried under a minimum of three metres of rock or regolith for protection. 1d6 1\n\n5\n\nTier 1 Surface Domes Modular Base Shallow Shaft Shallow Shaft Deep Shaft\n\n6\n\nDeep Shaft\n\n2 3 4\n\nTier 2 Surface Domes Surface Domes Modular Base Shallow Shaft Shallow Shaft Deep Shaft\n\nTier 3 Surface Domes Surface Domes Surface Domes Modular Base Modular Base Shallow Shaft\n\nTier 4 Surface Domes Surface Domes Surface Domes Surface Domes Modular Base Modular Base\n\nSurface Domes: This is just a rough collection of spraycrete domes and half-buried Quonset-style prefab buildings. It is usually used as a construction base to build the next phase of the outpost, and is considered to be temporary. However, some surface dome outposts have been in operation for over 100 years, with no one willing to invest the time or capital required to\n\nDeep Shaft Outpost\n\n3\n\n8\n\n9 5 6\n\n6\n\n7 1 3 2\n\n4 RebCo SAR Tracking Station 4-Alpha\n\nLocations Scale 1.

A surface dome facility can house 2d6 x 10 staff, with another 1d6 x 10 transients. Modular Base: Assembled from vacuum-rated 50-ton modules, the modular base is often buried under gravel or regolith to protect it from radiation and temperature extremes. While the modular base is designed to be easy to maintain, this class of base is also not intended to be a permanent solution. A typical modular base would have several apartment modules, a few dormitory modules, a half-dozen office (command) modules, a couple of power modules, a vehicle-maintenance module with inflatable airlock, another inflatable structure to serve as a garage, and other modules as needed. Modular bases can be as big as required, but usually have 2d6 x 20 inhabitants, along with another 1d6 x 10 transients. Shallow Shaft: In a shallow-shaft surface habitat, a 50-metre deep tunnel is drilled into the ground, and the outpost built around the shaft. The top of the shaft is protected by a dome, usually over a garden or park. Shutters between each level can close in the event of a blow-out. Power generation is usually separated from the shaft in a buried location on the surface, with any required heat radiators and power transmission equipment on the surface. Vehicle and spacecraft storage is usually located in companion surface domes or other shallow shafts adjacent to the primary one. Shallow shaft outposts are small, housing 2d6 x 10 people, along with another 1d6 x 10 transients. Deep Shaft: Deep shaft outposts feature a central shaft at least 200 metres deep. This shaft is anywhere from 8 to 16 metres in diameter. Like the shallow shaft outpost, the various functions and facilities of the outpost are constructed around the shaft, with elevators to connect to the surface, and powered shutters between each level. The top of the shaft is again typically under a protective dome, often enclosing a park or recreational garden area. Deep shaft outposts can be very large, with up to 2d6 x 30 inhabitants, and 2d6 x 10 transients. Very large examples of this type of outpost can multiply these population levels by 10-20 times.\n\nSurface Facility, Habitable Planet\n\nWhile facilities on habitable planets do not have to provide lifesupport, protection from environmental hazards is often required, whether it is from microbe, spores, insect-like creatures, or larger threats. On worlds with Teeming or Death World biospheres, these outposts tend to be walled, and in extreme cases are fortress-like Towers.\n\n27\n\n1d6 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nTier 1 Modular Base Modular Base Domes and Modules Domes and Modules Outpost Tower Outpost Tower\n\nTier 2 Modular Base Modular Base Modular Base Dome and Modules Domes and Modules Outpost Tower\n\nTier 3 Inflatable Structures Modular Base Modular Base Modular Base Domes and Modules Domes and Modules\n\nTier 4 Inflatable Structures Inflatable Structures Inflatable Structures Modular Structures Modular Structures Domes and modules\n\nInflatable Structures: A very temporary and inexpensive base constructed from inflatable buildings. These are usually filled with hardening foam if they are expected to last more than a year. These are typically very small sites, with 1d6 x 10 staff Modular Structures: Using the standard 50-ton modules, with hostile environment protection, a modular base can be set up very quickly, though the cost is quite high. The population of this type of base is highly variable, usually around 3d6 x 10 people, though this number can be double or even tripled. Transient population is roughly the same. Domes and Modules: This is a hybrid base, using standard modules combined with spraycrete domes for more permanent structures. The domes are far stronger than the modules, and often m"
