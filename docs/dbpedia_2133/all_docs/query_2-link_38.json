For three years now the class of 1989 has had the privilege of seeing the class of 1988 in action, and we learned from how experience what it is like to be an underclass¬ man and what they have to look for¬ ward to. Though most of their high school years are over, their most im¬ portant one lies ahead. This year they will host their Prom and try to live up to standards set in the past. in June they will see the last class ahead of them graduate, and they will become the ones everyone looks up to. This is a big role, but we think they’re up to it. The class of 1988 wishes them the best of luck. Enjoy it now-it’s over before you know it!!
