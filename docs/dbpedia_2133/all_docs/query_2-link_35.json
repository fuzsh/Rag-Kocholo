        "text": "Look at the Size of That Thing: An Interview With the Collectors Behind Read Five Books\n\nRon writes:\n\nWhat do you reckon is the best book on Star Wars collecting ever published?\n\nI think most will agree there are several legitimate contenders for that title.\n\nUndoubtedly, most will also agree that there's no correct answer to this question: Opinions will naturally differ as to which publication is superior.\n\nBut what if I modify the question slightly?\n\nWhat if I ask not what is the best book on Star Wars collecting, but instead what is the most impressive?\n\nThe blue, gold, and silver colors correspond to different Kickstarter tiers, while the black cover (most limited) was reserved for special gifts.\n\nWell, I'm just one guy with an opinion, but for me that's an easy one.\n\nUpon seeing the new book put out by British collectors Gianni Venturini and Gregory Armstrong, there's little doubt in my mind that it's the most impressive publication ever devoted to the subject of Star Wars collecting.\n\nMeasuring 15 inches by 12 inches, and weighing 10 pounds, Star Wars Toy Guide, Volume One: Kenner Action Figures, has the heft and sumptuousness of a limited-edition product from a publisher like Taschen. Leafing through it is a sensual experience: The weight of the paper and beauty of the graphics contribute to an effect that is immersive; you want to dive into the thing.\n\nIn fact, it's so sensually compelling that while leafing through it you may almost forget to scrutinize its information.\n\nBut don't worry: Its informational content is just as ace as its aesthetic appeal.\n\nCovering just about everything touching on Kenner's vintage action figure line, it's a treasure-trove for beginners and experts alike. Cogent and photo-rich elucidations of loose figures sit comfortably beside data-spreads treating tough-to-pin-down topics like two-packs and accessory variations. Even the large-size action figures are covered.\n\nForgive my resort to cliche, but there's really something here for everyone.\n\nBecause I was so impressed by the volume, I invited Gianni and Greg to sit for an interview concerning their process and future plans. I hope it'll serve as a good introduction to them as well as an endorsement of their future efforts.\n\nIf you don't already have a copy, I wholeheartedly recommend signing on to the proposed second edition (see below for details). If you have any interest in Star Wars toys, you won't regret it.\n\nRon Salvatore: Tell me about your background. In particular, how did you get into Star Wars toys?\n\nGianni Venturini: I was born in Hammersmith (West London) in 1974. My mother took me and my older brother to the Gaumont Theatre just off Shepherd Bush Green during a school half-term break in February 1978. My mum always tells the story of me reacting to Darth Vader coming through the blockade runner’s doors and me asking her to turn it over to another channel (I was only four at the time). I persevered and Star Wars stuck with me ever since (I’m always grateful to my mum for that introduction at quite a young age).\n\nProfessionally, I have been a Graphic Designer for over 28 years, initially studying General Art & Deigns at Richmond College and then Typography at the London College of Printing (now called UAL: London College of Communication).\n\nMy main toys as a kid were Star Wars, but when I got a bit older my toy collection was given to the children’s ward at the hospital where my mum worked. It wasn’t until my college years that a fellow student introduced me to Steve Sansweet’s book Star Wars: From Concept to Screen to Collectible, and in there I saw the full lineup of figures. I remember remarking on figures I didn’t even know existed (namely, the last 17), and thinking I wanted them all back. And so began the resurrection of my Star Wars collection.\n\nGregory Armstrong: I’m a little younger, born in 1984; however, my mum’s job, while she was pregnant with me, was running the Star Wars toy floor in Elys department store in Wimbledon. I’ve always had Star Wars toys from my earliest memories. They were just there. Not a complete run, but I had a fair few, along with my TV recorded VHS copy of The Empire Strikes Back. When I watch that film now I remember all the cuts for the adverts still.\n\nGrowing up my parents would often take us to car boot sales and that was a prime location to buy my Star Wars figures and vehicles to play with. I love my box of vintage figures, both Kenner and Palitoy, and all beaters, played with for years by me and now played with by my daughter who has my Millennium Falcon in her room. Gianni collects a lot on cards whereas I’m all about playing with your toys (by playing I mostly mean displaying and doing toy photography), so we have a good balance between us of toy collecting.\n\nI got involved in this project through my experience in retail, digital marketing, photography and my love for Star Wars. Gianni and I have been going to Star Wars exhibitions and seeing the films in the cinema for years before we even started discussing the book.\n\nRS: What would you say is the focus of this book? What did you want to accomplish with it?\n\nGV: When I first had the idea I wanted a book that would cover all aspects of Star Wars figures from all over the world, but soon realized it wouldn’t be achievable in the level of detail I wanted to cover. From that point, you start at the beginning, Kenner. But even then, with the vision I had, I knew we couldn’t cover it all the way I wanted to. So we started with the figures. We wanted to make a book that cataloged all we could about the figures and anything that was pertaining to them. At the same time, we wanted to produce a high-quality book that was a collector’s item in itself. Ultimately it was a book I wanted to own, and that I hoped would appeal to other Star Wars collectors.\n\nGA: We weren’t looking to take on the Kellerman. We obviously adore that book. But it’s hard to pick up for an affordable price. We wanted to make a book that wouldn’t cost £300-£500, but would still be held in high regard. We wanted to cover everything Kenner in one book, but given the level of detail we wanted to go into, it became very clear this was impossible. So we focused on the action figures and everything that goes with them, such as catalogs, variations, card backs, coins, etc.\n\nRS: Guides have been published over the years, both in print and on the web. What are some of your favorites, and how did they influence the creation of your book?\n\nGV: I have a large collection of Star Wars collecting books. After seeing my college friend’s Star Wars: From Concept to Screen to Collectible I immediately went and got myself a copy and would flick through that daily looking at all the items I would love to have in my collection. Steve Sansweet is a common author in my collection with The Star Wars Action Figure Archive being another favorite (amongst others). The John Kellerman book was one I signed up for when a possible second run was announced (missed the boat the first time around), but unfortunately that never happened, and I wasn’t able to get my hands on one until much later. These, along with Mark Bellomo’s Ultimate Guide to Vintage Star Wars Action Figures, were the books I would go to time and time again for reference.\n\nGA: I have The Ultimate Guide to Vintage Star Wars Action Figures, by Mark Bellomo, which is a really nice guide. I also love the UK Echo guides, wonderful books to look through. The web databases are amazing, but I love the feel of a book.\n\nRS: You’re both credited as co-authors. How did you delegate duties? Who did what?\n\nGV: I knew this book would not be something I couldn’t complete on my own with other commitments I had (at the time). Also, before this project I wasn’t really present on any social media, so I didn’t know too much about that side of things. I had started out designing some Star Wars card-back posters, which I sold through Etsy, and I knew Greg (who is married to my cousin) worked in social media advertising. I approached him about setting me up on social media as well as other platforms and how best to advertise the posters I had.\n\nI soon sold out of my first poster batch and explained my idea for the book and how I saw its potential as a Kickstarter campaign. Greg threw himself into helping me set up the campaign, create a social presence, and also threw a bit of photography in there. Fundamentally I designed the book with Greg doing all the photography (unless already sourced or supplied).\n\nGA: Our duties changed over time, as we helped each other share the load. Gianni is a fantastic graphic designer, I would only give my opinions on layout which would be discussed, but I had complete confidence in Gianni’s vision. We would both be doing research, getting in touch with collectors, doing long road trips to meet collectors and photograph key pieces in their collections. My primary task was photography. All the figure shots, the chapter breaks, and pretty much any physical we had in hand.\n\nRS: The photography is first-rate throughout. How did you ensure that level of quality? And how hard was it to hunt down the photos you needed?\n\nGV: With regards to the quality of the shots we had that was down to Greg. I fully trusted in his abilities, which is one of the reasons I was happy to have him on board to begin with. I think he should be particularly proud of the chapter-break images he produced -- so much so that we produced a poster of them all that was sold with some tiers of the Kickstarter.\n\nThe card backs and many fronts were already sourced from some private collectors I knew (access to these collections was very much an inspiration for the book). We thought we had the book pretty much planned out prior to the Kickstarter, albeit with some images still being required. The success of the Kickstarter (as we hoped) opened doors to other collectors and their collections. We were able to source many of the items we required to finish the book, but we didn’t stop there. With all this new content and information we had access to we couldn’t help but add to the book (the initial number of pages was 300 -- which soon grew to 400, and we ended up at 536). If we learned of something new we had to include it -- we wanted the book to be as in-depth as possible, printed \"real estate: permitting!\" The community was so generous, and we even got invited to people’s houses (after lockdown) to photograph extremely rare items.\n\nWe contacted people through Facebook who showed off amazing pieces via posts, but we were not always successful. We badgered the likes of Frank Mews a few times before we convinced him of the project. Some collectors were a flat \"no,\" whereas others greeted us with open arms. We always made sure we showed people layouts and designs in order to convince them it was a worthwhile project, and many times that was the deciding factor in getting them on board. Some collectors even took and retook photos for us because we were particular about how we wanted the item to appear in the book.\n\nWe were particularly lucky with certain items, like the catalogs. We wanted this show the printed spreads the catalog mailer packs were advertised on, as we knew that would spark nostalgia in the reader. We found a lady in the U.S. who collected them and had a majority of the ones we wanted. The lady was able to supply us with the necessary scans. At the same time, this also raised concern as we could not find the Spiegel catalogues anywhere. Searching through we found a relevant article by a certain Ron Salvatore. Problem solved! We asked a lot and got a lot back. We're so grateful to so many.\n\nGA: Thank you, I appreciate that.I’ve always been a keen photographer. I've had images published in magazines like Photography Monthly before, worked in digital marketing, and I'm a big fan of Toy Photography, so was no stranger to taking photos. They were all taken during the lockdowns -- in my kitchen, actually. I had some incredible figures at my house, including Gianni’s complete beautiful loose 96-figure run, all of them featured in the book, which both excited and terrified me. We of course had many variants to hunt down and photograph, as well as the Droids and Ewoks on card and loose.\n\nThere were some things I was very nervous handling, such as the Hoth Luke still in the original mail-away baggie, double telescopic Luke, Vader and Obi-Wan on cards (albeit in acrylics), double telescopic lightsabers, and some figures on the card with slightly loose bubbles. These may not have been ours, but rather lent just for the photography. But it was amazing to have all these wonderful figures in hand and on my kitchen table being shot for the book.\n\nRS: What is your favorite aspect of the book? What about it are you most proud of?\n\nGV: For me, it’s the look and feel of the book. We wanted great information but we also wanted a traditional feeling book with a sense of quality and presence. We wanted it to be a collector’s piece in its own right as well as a great resource! When people see it in person it always gets the reaction I was hoping for.\n\nGA: Ofcourse, the photography, particularly the full-page chapter break images, which were added a lot later. But, in all honesty, I would say the chapters on variations and weapons. We weren’t planning to have them in the book, not at the level of detail they are anyway. We added them during the Kickstarter as stretch goals, but once we actually sat down the do the chapters we realized how big a job it was going to be, and once we started pulling that thread we couldn’t stop till the whole jumper was gone.\n\nIt was a lot of work, stress, and at points very frustrating, but I love looking at those chapters now. They really elevate the book even higher, and it wouldn’t be the same without them.\n\nRS: Tell me about the graphic design. Gianni, you mentioned you worked in that field. How did you approach the look of the thing?\n\nGV: Being a graphic designer I wanted to make sure the book wasn’t \"over-designed.\" When you love the content, you want that to be the star. I knew if we got the photography right (which Greg did) I could allow the content to dictate the look of the book. No bells and whistles, let the images do the talking. The efforts in design were more about communication, which is what graphic design is. You want to present something in a way that not only looks good but communicates its message clearly. Breaking down the card backs into \"masters\" and \"subsidiaries\" was a bit of a eureka moment for us as we felt this simplified the various combinations in a much clearer way and allowed us to show the full range of existing card backs as well as other predicted possibilities.\n\nThe book actually started off having a landscape orientation, but with some pages having throw-outs (fold-out pages), it limited the size of press we could print on, and so narrowed down our options regarding printers. We were always conscious of costs and wanted both quality and value for the reader.\n\nGA: That was all Gianni. His design of this book blew me away, even in the earliest drafts.\n\nRS: What do you think the book has contributed to the knowledge base of Star Wars collecting?\n\nGV: As we mention in the book, collecting these figures is multi-faceted. You can go down multiple rabbit holes with many aspects of the collection. Given limited pages (only 536) we were both conscious and careful that we gave the right amount of information to the right areas. We do hope, however, that we have given enough information to start people down those rabbit holes, should they so wish to go there, by giving outline information. I feel like we do this in the section on COOs on page 263, in which we explain how they can be scrutinized down to the finest detail without showing every possible option -- which was impractical in this instance and a book unto itself.\n\nI hope one day this book could inspire another generation and make them realize why these toys are loved so much by so many.\n\nRS: I notice that you occasionally feature a photograph of a prototype alongside its production counterpart. What was your thinking there? What do you think prototypes contribute to our understanding of these toys?\n\nGV: These were images we had access to from the Lehmkuhl brothers [Sean and Ryan], who runtoyhoarders.com. They were kind enough to supply some images, so we thought it would be cool to show these off and give a little insight as to how these figures were put together and even explain some of the terminology used in preproduction collecting.\n\nGA: It’s just nice to have those extras in there. If we knew about it, could get hold of it or get our hands on a useable image from someone who had it, it was going in the book.\n\nRS: I was happy to see the large-size figure line included in the book, as that line doesn’t get a lot of love from collectors. Why did you decide to include those alongside the action figures? What do you enjoy about the large-size line?\n\nGV: Originally, that was a stretch goal, but we always knew we wanted them to appear. This book was to cover all things figure-wise from Kenner, so to omit them wasn’t really a choice. They not only add new collections to the book, but they also add new color pallets. The content dictated the design. We even flipped the design of the pages (Droids& Ewoks) to reflect the card backs, putting the figures on the opposite side when compared to the movie-line figures. This is not necessarily something that people would pick up on, but we knew it was there.\n\nGA: Much like the variants and Droids and Ewoks, the large-size figures were floating around as a stretch goal during the Kickstarter, but before even hitting our target we had already discussed it and decided they were going in. We just couldn’t leave anything out. But I’m glad they are in there. If you love them or not, they are still part of the Star Wars Kenner history, and so fully deserve their own chapter in the book.\n\nRS: Earlier you mentioned accessory variations. I was impressed by the level of detail there. How hard was it assembling all that information, and do you reckon what you’ve put together is close to comprehensive?\n\nGV: This was always a tricky section, and one we decided to add late in the process. I think it’s one of those sections that could be expanded upon or be a book on its own. With space as an issue, we treated it as one of those sections through which we can inform people enough to allow them to further investigate. We know this book won’t compete with the level of information that is on the internet, but we wanted to cover as much as possible to give people a good starting point.\n\nGA: It was a very time-consuming and daunting task, with a lot of opinions woven into fact, so it was very difficult to catalog, but I’m very happy and proud of the final chapter and how far we went with it in the end.\n\nRS: \"Opinions woven into fact.\" That's a great way of putting it! This book includes more information on the ROTJ two-packs than I’ve seen in any other source. What are your thoughts on those products?\n\nGV: These are items not necessarily on my radar but I appreciate them all the same. We too had never seen a lot about these in other books, and it was tricky, as we knew we could never display all of the almost 3,000 options possibly available. Again, we had help from a guy (mentioned in the book) who focused on these, and who had a lot of knowledge that he was willing to pass on. I feel we did the two-packs justice.\n\nGA: I didn’t know much about these going in so the whole chapter was an education for me. I love the combinations.\n\nRS: Speaking of hard-to-catalog areas: Does the book feature photos of nearly every catalog figure mailer known to exist? It almost seems that way. How hard was it finding all of those photos?\n\nGV: Simple answer is yes. Probably the hardest section to source images for. Not only the packs (which, again, we had great help with from experts in this field), but the catalogues too (as you well know, Ron). We ended up missing a couple of packs which we have now sourced and will include in any future print runs. We searched online for stuff we could maybe ask permission for and even looked at purchasing some, but these too are becoming sought after and so command a price! As I mentioned, we managed to find a lady in the U.S. who collected all sorts of catalogues and was selling USB sticks containing digital versions. We sent a list of what we needed, and the lady was able to help out with pretty much all of them from that period. The only ones we struggled with were Spiegel (which a certain Mr. Salvatore helped us with at the 11th hour).\n\nGA: It seemed borderline impossible at points until you find that person who has them. I tell you, during the lockdown, I become very good friends with my postman.\n\nRS: Yeah, the Spiegel catalogs are tough. I'm thrilled I was able to help in some small way. You seem to place a lot of emphasis on the internet collecting community, even devoting a section to it. How do you think this book fits into that community?\n\nGV: With myself not being on social media prior to this project I was very detached from the online community side of things, which is how Greg and I got started in talking about this project together. As it turns out the online community played a massive part in getting this book to a point where we were able to produce it. Without the likes of certain YouTube channels that we mention in the book, Facebook groups also, which include many people we have become very good friends with (both online and in-person), we could not have spread the word as much as we did, as there was no budget for advertising, and we relied heavily on word of mouth. Nobody knew who Read Five Designs was when we started (I even started doing posters under the name Blue Milk until we spotted someone else using that name), and it’s fair to say that people took a risk on us, which we will forever be grateful for. Whenever we see comments from videos, live streams, or online posts, we are always given the impression that they have been a part of this journey in getting the book out, and sometimes they got us over difficult periods. So a big thank you to that community.\n\nGA: Such a great bunch of humans. We weren’t exactly greeted with open arms when we announced the Kickstarter. Understandably so, we came out of nowhere, no one knew us, and here we were claiming we were going to make the most in-depth Star Wars Kenner toy guide. So we would go on with anyone who was kind enough to invite us onto their YouTube channel, including Bossk's Bounty, Paliboys, and Holochronicles, who welcomed us with open arms and believed in the project from the start. We made some very good friends within that community. We’ve also had people tell us throughout the process of making this book that it brought other communities together in their excitement for the book. Meeting people in person at conventions like Echo Live and toy fairs has been a really amazing and rewarding experience.\n\nRS: The collecting community is certainly incredibly diverse and responsive to requests. How did you go about leveraging the knowledge of that community in helping you assemble all of this information?\n\nGV: Once the project got funded, it opened a lot of doors, and some people approached us notifying us of rare items they had in their collections. If I’m honest, it was always a part of the gamble -- get the project funded, so people know it will actually be happening, and then bring people on board with their collections. When you start communicating with people online about specific focuses you get to hear and read the same names crop up as to who to speak to or contact. Some collectors gave us a flat \"no\" and others were very keen to have their collections added. We managed to convince others by sending them sections of the book that were relevant to them, and once they could see what we were trying to do they wanted to help.\n\nGA: It was so important, knowing whom in the collecting community to reach out to, depending on their focus, to help us. Chapters like the ones on coins and two-packs just wouldn’t be what they are without the valuable knowledge of the collecting community.\n\nRS: What do you wish you could have included in the book but couldn’t for reasons of space, time, lack of adequate photography, etc.?\n\nGV: I will always look at the book and see ways to improve it. That said, I think that, given that it’s over 500 pages and the size it is, it would be easy to say most of it’s there. But no. I do think some sections could have been expanded upon, but adding to the number of pages with what I had in mind would have made the book a danger to itself. What do I mean by this? Well, I think it would have been too thick and heavy for it to handle its own physicality, and would maybe not last too long with constant handling. We had a couple of prototypes made before going to final print, and that was pretty expensive to produce. This included the dust jacket options and all the finishes we were looking for. We got it, and it was too big really. The page weight was too heavy, which meant the spine was too wide, and it was tricky to handle. As a result, one of the prototypes got damaged, so we made some refinements with the final product, bringing paper weight down and modifying some other details, and we think the final product is solid, and with quality finishes to boot! I know this goes away from the original question but it’s all about balance. Did we get the right amount of stuff in a book that size? I think so, yes, and without too much compromise.\n\nRS: Did you have an experience while writing the book that you particularly value and that you wouldn’t have had otherwise?\n\nGV: I think this goes back to the community and the people we have met along the way. They encourage you to push on and get the job done. In my mind, I knew I never wanted to let these people down, and I knew I could deliver a quality product. As time went on, we ourselves go frustrated with how long everything was taking, but we knew we had to get stuff right. We constantly kept our backers updated, and we were always accessible to any questions or concerns people had. The community helped us get to the end.\n\nGA: Meeting everyone and seeing their reactions to the book we poured so much work, time, and love into. Collectors we met on our photography road trips, collectors in the community, YouTubers, and just meeting those who have supported us, has been a really incredible experience. You walk into a toy shop, and someone stops you to say they backed the book and what a great job we’ve done. It can be a little overwhelming in the best possible way. Just seeing the reactions, the posts on social media, and the emails people send sharing what these toys mean to them and how important the book is to them, it’s pretty amazing.\n\nRS: What should people thinking of producing their own book keep in mind? What are the pitfalls of writing a collectables book? What are the benefits?\n\nGV: Although I have worked on many projects of this type, I have never worked on one as big as this, of which I had complete control over (albeit with Greg). You have to learn from your mistakes, not just in the contents of the book but with the production and fulfillment. There are certain things we could have done better, but we were learning things along the way. The fulfillment part was particularly hard as we probably both underestimated that task. As I’m answering this question I have just finished attaching the final labels to the last batch that will leave my house in two days’ time, and what a relief that will be. We know how we can use those experiences to give our supporters a better experience going forward.\n\nGA: You've got to keep a level head. You’ll be told very conflicting pieces of information you’ll need to sort through. And consistency: we had to show all chapters the same respect, the same level of detail, not just brushing over say \"coins.\" We didn’t want weak chapters. We wanted something to please all vintage Star Wars collectors, no matter their focus.\n\nRS: What are your personal favorite Star Wars toys?\n\nGV: Even as a child I was always about the characters. I didn’t ask for too many vehicles or playsets as a child, and they are not something I need to add to my collection now. I am all about figures, and they were what I wanted as a child. I would receive them double-wrapped at Christmas, and knew exactly what they were before opening them -- it was just a question of which particular figure was in the gift. My favorite figure is probably Han Bespin, I always gravitated to that one as a child.\n\nGA: I love all my beaters, but as a kid I played with R5 and R2 a lot, and took them places with me, bearing in mind as a kid I was playing with these figures before even seeing the films, so I had no idea R5 had so little screen time. And of course, the vintage Millennium Falcon, one of the greatest toys ever made. Can’t wait to get to that in Volume Two.\n\nRS: How can collectors get their hands on a copy of this?\n\nGV: We have pretty much sold out of the first batch, but we may have a small number after fufillment. That said, we have generated a waitlist which is now over the required amount to produce a second batch. If people are interested in being added to the list, they can email book@readfive.co.uk with their full name and country of residence.\n\nGA: After a well-deserved nap, we hope to do another run this year. Collectors can let us know if they want to be notified and jump on the waitlist.\n\nRS: Earlier you mentioned a second volume. What do you have planned for future volumes?\n\nGV: We have started to flesh out Volume Two, which will include vehicle, creatures and playsets. We will give treat these similarly to how we have treated the figures in Volume One, and there is even a preview of that at the end of Volume One.\n\nGA: I can’t wait to get into the photography side of Volume Two. So excited to meet and work with new and old faces, play with the amazing playsets, etc. Bring it on!\n\nRS: Well, guys, congratulations on completing such a monumental project, and on doing it in such spectacular fashion! I can't wait to see Volume Two. Let me know if I can be of any help with it.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nWas the \"Happy Birthday\" Poster Nearly Sold as a Commercial Poster?\n\nRon writes:\n\nWe haven't featured much poster content on the blog over the years. So when I saw that Danny Katzel posted some interesting poster-related content on a Facebook group, I thought I'd ask him to work it into a blog post. Happily, he agreed. Although posters are one of the most heavily collected areas in Star Wars fandom, certain examples remain mysterious. Questions abound, like: How exactly was the Happy Birthday poster distributed? and What was the intended forum for John Alvin's Concert poster? Danny's post touches on both of these longstanding questions, and raises a few others. I hope you enjoy it.\n\nDanny writes:\n\nThe Happy Birthday test print\n\nOnce a neglected collecting niche, preproduction posters from the Star Wars franchise have really taken off in recent years as more examples have hit the collecting market. Most preproduction posters are an inch or more larger than their production counterparts and still have their color bars attached to one border. They sometimes also have guide and registration marks, which are trimmed off during a production run. Most preproduction posters are snuck out of the printing facility during the proofing phase before the poster is approved for production. Printers need to print many preproduction posters in a batch even when only a few are needed for quality control and approval sign off. The rest of the run is trashed. Luckily, some posters are occasionally saved by employees who liked the artwork.\n\nI find the most interesting preproduction posters are those that are different than the final production versions. Rather than proofs, these kinds of posters can be considered “test prints” intended to demonstrate what the corresponding production posters would look like. Unfortunately, in the intervening decades since these posters were saved from the scrap pile, institutional memory clarifying why they exist at all is lost, as the people who are the custodians of that memory pass away and related documentation becomes hard to find.\n\nThis test print of the infamous \"Happy Birthday\" poster was originally found at the sale of the estate of a former Lucasfilm employee who worked for the studio back in 1978. For some reason, he took a few test print and proof posters home with him. This poster was in poor condition and was probably rescued from the garbage. To add insult to injury, this person then folded over the edges of the poster to hide the color bars, guide, and registration marks, which caused still more damage. Then he taped the borders all over to attach it to a backing board when it was framed.\n\nOn the bright side, at least nothing was cut off.\n\nWhen he passed away, his family had an estate sale. Unfortunately, no Star Wars collectors knew of the sale, and a local record picker bought the posters. Happily, the record picker's haul included this Happy Birthday poster, a John Alvin Concert proof poster, and two proofs of Ralph McQuarrie prints originally sold at Supersnipe, the Manhattan store of which George Lucas was a partial owner. These are the only known versions of any of the aforementioned items. Unfortunately, the posters were sold separately by the record picker, and the whereabouts of the two McQuarrie proofs are now unknown.\n\nIt is thought that all four posters were printed at the same time, possibly even on the same day.\n\nA production Happy Birthday poster\n\nInterestingly, this Happy Birthday poster is the wrong size.\n\nThe production version of this poster is a one sheet measuring 27\" x 41\" with a white border, in which the now infamous crooked “Star Wars Happy Birthday One Sheet” text is printed. There is a Happy Birthday one sheet proof poster that has all of that and is the expected size, 28\" x 41\", the extra inch of width allowing for the color bars. But this is different. This poster is approximately 25\" x 38\" and was designed to be “full bleed,” with the color image going all the way to the edges with no white border and no “Happy Birthday One Sheet” text. The color bar is right up against the image, leaving no space for a white border on the right side. If you were to cut off the color bars and borders with the registration marks, the trimmed poster would be the exact same size as the production Concert poster: 24\" x 37\". In fact, this Happy Birthday test print is exactly the same size as the proof of the Concert poster found alongside it.\n\nIf these two posters were printed at the same time, it's likely the same size of paper was used for both. But why? Why would they print this Happy Birthday poster smaller than the intended one sheet size? This Happy Birthday print does not match any known size for any reprinting of the Happy Birthday poster, and the print quality is better than any reprint. In fact, the image quality is as good as the one sheet, and there are subtle details that are more visible on it than on the final poster.\n\nIs it possible that they considered printing this image at a smaller size suitable for commercial sales? That's one of the theories attached to the Concert poster -- that it was intended for sale at a series of Star Wars concerts. I could not find any documentation that a similar mode of distribution was ever considered for the Birthday Poster. I reached out to several fellow collectors and people who might have insider knowledge, and no one had any evidence or remembered ever discussing making this poster anything other than a one sheet.\n\nIf this was meant for commercial sale, why would it have a PG logo? That is usually reserved (at least back in the '70s) for US theatrical releases. I guess it’s possible 20th Century Fox did a small print run of this image as a commercial poster to see how it would look, but then scrapped the idea. But, again, I can find no corroborating evidence that this ever took place.\n\nThere are other instances in which Star Wars posters were printed in smaller versions. For example, the test print of the Return of the Jedi \"Style B\" international one sheet with the grey title has, printed on its reverse, smaller versions of the three-sheet, six-sheet, and twenty-four-sheet posters. Some of those smaller versions are more purple in color than the production versions.\n\nA test print consisting of two scaled-down Back to the Future one sheets on half-sheet-sized paper\n\nI also have a Back to the Future test print where two identical one sheet advance images are printed side by side in a smaller format to fit on paper sized for a half-sheet. So perhaps these smaller prints were commonly used to test how the designs looked prior to the start of the full-size print run.\n\nProduction poster (left) and test print (right)\n\nLooking carefully at the poster and comparing it to the production one sheet, this smaller version is a bit brighter. The reflections of the action figures on the table are clearer, and the mirrored table is more blue. This is most noticeable on the bottom, near the PG logo. There is a stark contrast between the bluish table and the black background of the PG logo. This might be evidence of a mock-up PG logo.\n\nWhile the poster size is smaller, the image itself is the same, as is the scale. Even all the text at the bottom -- the PG logo, the statement referring to the Kenner toy company, and the 20th Century Fox logo -- is printed at the same size as it is on the production poster. It's just more cropped at the edges.\n\nIt is interesting that this poster was printed along with a commercial poster, and the Lucasfilm employee who took this home had only other commercial proofs.\n\nCrooked text resulting from slipped plate (not present on test print)\n\nWe know the “Star Wars Birthday One Sheet” text in the lower left corner of the one sheet was added at the very last minute using an extra stripped-in plate, which slipped in the press, resulting in its peculiar slant. We also know that if the white border of the Happy Birthday poster was trimmed off, it would be the exact same size as the Concert Poster.\n\nMaybe the Happy Birthday poster was designed so that it could be either a theatrical poster or a commercial poster?\n\nJohn Alvin's Concert poster, one of the rarest of all Star Wars posters\n\nI have read that the Concert poster was commissioned in April of 1978, which would have been around the time the Happy Birthday posters were being printed to distribute to theaters in May and June of that year.\n\nThis leads me to conclude that my poster is a true “test print.” It was printed to demonstrate what the image would look like printed as a commercial poster. Perhaps the idea was floated of making the one-year anniversary poster as a commercial print to sell at the Star Wars Concert along with, or instead of, the well-known John Alvin poster. And if the Concert (or series of concerts) was cancelled, as is often speculated, then perhaps this smaller Happy Birthday poster was scrapped at the same time. Maybe the image was even purposefully brightened to make it more suitable for a kid’s room?\n\nAgain, this is pure speculation; I can't say for certain either way. But it seems logical considering what I have been able to learn these past three months. Why else would this poster have been found among a stash of commercial proofs? Why would it have been printed at a facility that focused on commercial posters?\n\nWe may never know...\n\n↧\n\nKenner Star Wars and the Sunday Funnies\n\nRon writes:\n\nIntro\n\nDo you remember Star Wars in the funny pages?\n\nNo, I'm not talking about the comic strip created by Russ Manning (and later Archie Goodwin and Al Williamson); I'm talking about Kenner advertisements that were printed in the funny pages of the local newspaper.\n\nI realize, not without a degree of melancholy, that some of you may not understand what I'm talking about.\n\nAllow me to explain.\n\nBack in the '70s and '80s, nearly every home received a newspaper on its doorstep each morning. That's how people stayed informed. You needed the newspaper to stay on top of the weather, sports, stocks, and all the other stuff that we now read on our phones, sometimes while driving.\n\nIn the America of that time, children were typically entrusted with the task of delivering this vital lifeline to the outside world.\n\nSeriously, there was a boy who got up before dawn every morning, put rolled-up newspapers into the basket mounted on his bike, and rode around town, deftly throwing the papers onto the doorstep of each home on his route. There was even a video game about it.\n\nTwo dollars\n\nIt sounds crazy, right?\n\nKids on bikes throwing papers around. How exotic! How primitive!\n\nIt sounds like a practice out of the remotest part of the alien past, like the Antebellum South or the pre-COVID era.\n\nAnyway, the funny pages were a section of the newspaper devoted to comic strips and other lighthearted fare. As you can imagine, this section was prime advertising space for businesses whose customer base consisted of children. Because all children read the funny pages.\n\nIf the funny pages were prime advertising space for kid-focused businesses, the Sunday funny pages were doubly prime.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they were printed in color, of course. They also tended to be larger, often comprising multiple two-page spreads.\n\nAs a toy company, Star Wars licensee Kenner advertised in the funny pages. Kenner made toys. Kids played with toys. It just made sense.\n\nKenner's dalliance with the funny pages began before the company's Star Wars toys were on the market, as the above advertisement demonstrates. Dating from 1977, it spotlights some of the greatest Kenner toys of the '70s, like Milky the Marvelous Milking Cow. [1]\n\nI shudder to think how kids today, accustomed to playing with iPads and VR headsets, would react to the notion of their 20th-century counterparts playing with a plastic cow that gives fake milk.\n\nIf you were to explain Milky to them, they'd probably think you were pulling their leg. They probably have little firsthand knowledge of cows. If they drink milk at all, it's probably almond milk.\n\nThankfully, we have this ad to assure us that, yes, Milky was real.\n\nMilky, like the paperboy, is a thing that existed in the past.\n\n1978: A Galaxy of Savings\n\nKenner continued to advertise in the funny pages long after Milky was dropped from their product line.\n\nThe ad you see above ran in newspapers in the fall of 1978. Its publication may have postdated Milky, but it occurred smack in the middle of the Star Wars craze.\n\nThe ad was actually Star Wars themed: It featured a blue star field at its top, text intended to mimic the movie's famous opening crawl, and of course several toys based on the George Lucas property. But other Kenner toys were featured as well. The gist was that Kenner would provide cash back to the consumer, via a mail-in rebate, on a selection of Kenner toys.\n\nBut there was a catch: In order to participate in the promotion, the consumer had to buy specially marked boxes of Cheerios.\n\nWhy Cheerios?\n\nAs this post from a few years back explains, in 1978 Kenner was owned by General Mills, the company behind Cheerios. That's why the earlier examples of your Star Wars action figures have \"GMFGI\" molded into their legs -- it stood for \"General Mills Fun Group, Inc.\"\n\nThe promotion was pitched to Kenner's wholesale customers via the above-pictured brochure, one of the few Kenner brochures to feature a cover devoted exclusively to Star Wars.\n\nThe brochure, a catalog of promotions that Kenner had planned for the near future, claimed that the campaign would reach 125 million customers. Presumably, that number represents the number of people estimated to read the Sunday funny pages.\n\nAccording to the Internet, roughly 222 million people lived in the United States in 1978. I guess 100 million didn't subscribe to a newspaper.\n\nAs you've no doubt noticed, the brochure featured a very accurate representation of the ad that ran in papers. The most notable difference was the absence in the distributed ad of the child who is playing with the Radio Controlled R2-D2.\n\nI have no idea why he was cut from the final product.\n\nPossibly he got bored of playing with that crummy toy and ran right out of the printed space and into some utopia where Kenner's RC toys actually worked without malfunctioning after five minutes.\n\nIntriguingly, a second Kenner brochure detailed this promotion. This brochure is quite rare; I've personally seen only three or four examples.\n\nThough the general pitch is the same (there's that 125 million number again), the graphics were drawn rather than photographic, and the design of the represented ad was quite different. Based on the seemingly preliminary design of the ad, my assumption is that this brochure predates the one featuring the Stormtrooper on its cover.\n\nYou'll note that the ad as it was printed in papers was expansive -- it occupied all of the space on a fully unfolded piece of large-size newsprint.\n\nThe Kenner brochure promised full-page ads, and the public got them.\n\nBut what about papers with smaller formats? Or just advertising space insufficient for a full-size ad?\n\nThose publications were serviced by this half-page advertisement.\n\nThough its theming was still heavily reliant on Star Wars, it pictured only one Star Wars toy -- the imposing Death Star Space Station.\n\nAs far as I know, these 1978 rebate advertisements were the only Kenner ads featuring Star Wars to appear in the Sunday funny pages during the 1970s.\n\nBut, as we'll see, our story doesn't end there.\n\n1980: A Cash-In on Empire\n\nCome 1980, the world was gearing up for The Empire Strikes Back, and Kenner returned to the funnies, this time with a half-page ad promoting not a general rebate program that merely included Star Wars, but a promotion that wasexplicitly devoted to Star Wars.\n\nThe focus was a sweepstakes whose top prize included a trip to a screening of the eagerly awaited sequel alongside R2-D2 and C-3PO.\n\nSecond prize was a set of ESB toys (more on that below).\n\nThird prize was the Kenner-branded patch you see above. Today it's sought after by patch and toy collectors alike. [3]\n\nAs you've no doubt noticed, the ad also promoted Kenner's then current mail-away offer centered on the Bossk action figure.\n\nBossk, remember, had been advertised as the \"secret action figure\" on action-figure blister cards. This ad was part of his big reveal. Which undoubtedly left some kids confused, because what was a Sleestak doing in Star Wars?\n\nThough I don't have an exact date for this advertisement, the entry deadline for the sweepstake (April 1, 1980) leads me to believe it ran in papers in March. Empire debuted in May.\n\nIf the graphics utilized on the ad seem familiar, it may be because they were also used on a flyer that was inserted into Star Wars toy boxes during the latter days of 1979. The above example was pulled out of an X-Wing Fighter box.\n\nAs is made clear by the text encouraging kids to look for the ad in the spring of the following year, the flyer predated the ad.\n\nAlso note that, though the flyer refers to The Empire Strikes Back, it doesn't utilize the logo, probably because it hadn't been designed at that point.\n\nIf you're as nitpicky as I am, you noticed an inconsistency when comparing the ad to the flyer.\n\nThough the flyer of 1979 gleefully promotes a chance to win \"every Star War [sic] toy ever made . . . and ever to be made!\" the ad of 1980 revises this to \"a complete collection of Kenner's 1980 Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back toys.\"\n\nEvery product made in perpetuity vs. products made in 1980. Quite a difference!\n\nI'm guessing Kenner's legal team took a look at this and determined (rightly, I think) that the earlier promise constituted a liability. Better to be more precise about the exact terms of the offer. It's never a good idea to promise something that is by nature indefinite.\n\nThe reverse of the flyer promoted Kenner's planned 1980 line, which at that time included a range of new large-size action figures.\n\nAs experienced collectors know, all but IG-88 were cancelled.\n\nAlso utilizing the art from the flyer was this shelf-talker, a store display that Kenner provided to retailers with the intent of promoting the sweepstakes. Its debut was concurrent with the publication of the newspaper ad, roughly spring of 1980.\n\nWhen attached to the facing of a store shelf, the display permitted shoppers to enter the sweepstakes by detaching one of the included entry forms, completing it, and then mailing it to the specified address.\n\nWe saw that in 1978 Kenner appealed to readers of the Sunday funny pages with the lure of cash-back rebates on a variety of toys.\n\nRebates were a big part of Kenner's efforts to engage with the toy-buying public. As the above advertisement demonstrates, rebate programs continued into the Empire Strikes Back era.\n\nBy the way, if you're wondering how Toy City designed this ad, see the post located here.\n\nThe program that Toy City promoted was pitched to retailers via a brochure with a green cover. That's the cover you see above.\n\nNote the hang-tag graphic, also evident in the Toy City advertisement. The hang-tag was the signature motif of this promotion.\n\nThose hang-tags appear again in the advertisement pictured inside the brochure.\n\nAnother full-pager, this ad ran in papers on November 23, 1980, i.e. right at the start of the 1980 holiday season. Like its 1978 predecessor, it promoted a rebate program, in this case dubbed the \"Cash In With Kenner\" program.\n\nI can hear you asking, \"But, wait . . . that doesn't look anything like the Toy City advertisement shown above. What are you trying to pull here?\"\n\nYes, the two ads differ considerably.\n\nThough the Toy City ad utilized Kenner-supplied graphics and information related to the rebate program, it was retailer specific. Toy City (with Kenner's help) designed and funded that ad.\n\nBy contrast, the ad pictured in the Kenner brochure, and the ads that are the focus of this post, were ads that were designed and funded solely by Kenner. The former was a local advertisement, the latter the result of a nationwide advertising campaign by one of the biggest toy companies in the country. That's the difference.\n\nUnfortunately, I've never seen a copy of the full-page ad pictured in the brochure. [2]\n\nBut I do have the half-page version. Thankfully, it retains both of the Star Wars toys depicted in the full-page ad: the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Armored Snowspeeder.\n\n1981: Rerelease and More Rebates\n\nThe Empire years saw several liaisons between Kenner and the Sunday funnies: No fewer than four national ads featuring Kenner Star Wars toys appeared in the funny pages during the 1980-1982 period.\n\nKenner's 1981 entry is probably my favorite in the series, in large part because it featured nothing but Star Wars toys.\n\nThe line-up depicting the then new 41-back wave of figures was particularly attractive.\n\nLike other ads we've discussed, this one focused on a program through which customers could obtain cash rebates on purchases of select items.\n\nBut there was a new element: By attending a screening of Star Wars, soon to be in rerelease around the country, and saving the corresponding ticket stub, a customer could obtain a bonus rebate of $1.\n\nThis was a canny maneuver on Kenner's part: By encouraging families to see Star Wars, they were encouraging engagement with the franchise, and (probably) additional toy sales. Because what child of the '80s could resist buying Star Wars toys after he'd just seen Star Wars in the theater?\n\nRemember: at the time this promotion was active, Return of the Jedi was still a full year in the future. Kenner needed something to keep kids tuned in.\n\nI believe the advertisement ran in papers on April 5, 1981. According to IMDb, Star Wars was rereleased five days later, on April 10.\n\nTo promote the program Kenner issued a colorful countertop display. On its bottom it featured three spaces to which pads of peel-off coupons were to be affixed.\n\nJudging by the text printed in those spaces, the display was intended for use in movie theaters.\n\nThe display is quite rare; I can't remember seeing more than 10 examples during the time I've been collecting.\n\nHere's an image of the coupon. It's pretty much what you'd expect.\n\nLater in 1981, Kenner refreshed its \"Cash In\" program. The cover of the brochure that promoted the program to retailers, pictured above, featured a bank note and a coin carrying images of Darth Vader.\n\nAs you'd expect, the brochure's interior contained an image of the advertisement that would promote the program to the public. It was to run, you guessed it, in the Sunday funny pages.\n\nAs in 1980, it was a half-page ad. It ran in papers on November 22.\n\nThe actual ad, which featured Christmas theming and focused on a variety of toy lines, hewed closely to its representation in the brochure. The major difference was the former's replacement of the Glamor Gals Fancy Firebird with the Showplace from the same line.\n\nIf you compare the two images closely, you'll find some other slight changes, including one concerning the placement of the Kenner logo and another relating to the positioning of the Millennium Falcon's cockpit cover.\n\nThe holiday season of 1982 marked the effective end of the Empire era. 1983 would see the release of Return of the Jedi, and a new, though still somewhat familiar, advertising approach from Kenner.\n\n1983: A Sweepstakes for Jedi\n\nAs we saw, in 1980 Kenner sponsored a sweepstakes through which kids could win a trip to see an early screening of The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nIn 1983, with the release of Return of the Jedi imminent, Kenner returned to the well: They promoted a sweepstakes in which the grand prize was a trip to see a preview of the hotly anticipated third entry in the series.\n\nThe advertisement for the promotion ran, as you probably foresaw, in the Sunday funnies. Though I don't have the exact date, based on the entry deadline (April 1), it probably went to print sometime in March.\n\nSimilarities to the 1980 sweepstakes were multiple: Echoing the earlier promotion, second prize consisted of a complete set of ROTJ toys released in 1983. And second prize was a specially designed patch.\n\nToday that patch is substantially harder to come by than its ESB counterpart. I'm still looking for an example if anyone is holding!\n\nTo help get the world out concerning the promotion, Kenner distributed this striking poster. Curiously, it's the only poster issued by Kenner as a store display in support of the Star Wars line. Or at least it's the only one I can think of at the moment. There was also this one, but I think that was more of a Coke poster with a Kenner tie-in.\n\nRemember, at the time this poster was issued, the public had yet to see Return of the Jedi. The poster featured Nien Nunb and Admiral Ackbar because Kenner had already sponsored action-figure mail-away promotions centered on those two characters. The other new characters remained somewhat mysterious.\n\nYou may have noticed the text printed at the bottom of the poster.\n\nIt alerted shoppers to the existence of the sweepstakes entry form, copies of which were located in the Star Wars section of the store's toy department.\n\nNaturally, those forms were attached to a Return of the Jedi shelf-talker.\n\nUnfortunately, the graphics on this one were a little disappointing. They couldn't put an X-Wing or something on there?\n\nOutro\n\nAs far as I know, the ROTJ sweepstakes ad of spring of 1983 marked the last time that Kenner advertised Star Wars in the Sunday funnies.\n\nMaybe someone at Kenner determined that readership of the funny pages was on the decline. Or maybe a medium capable of greater graphical subtlety was desired.\n\nWhen, in the waning days of 1983, Kenner returned to Sunday newspapers, their ad didn't appear in the funny pages; it appeared in the full-color \"magazine\" supplement.\n\nRemember the magazine supplement? My local paper had Parade. I would toss it aside in my rush to get to the funny pages. [4]\n\nThe magazine supplement was, of course, primarily aimed at adults, which is probably why this rebate advertisement focused on the bill associated with holiday gift-giving, a concern far from the minds of most children.\n\nIt also helps to explain the rather mercenary lure of $1,000 in cold hard cash.\n\nAccording to this Kenner brochure, the ad ran on November 13, 1983.\n\nOne of the fun things about the Kenner Star Wars line (and one of the fun things about collecting it) is that it spanned two distinct eras in American culture. This is probably evident even to those who didn't live through those eras, but are instead looking back on them by sifting through their detritus.\n\nWhen the line debuted in 1977, the world looked and felt a certain way. And by the time it ended, it didn't.\n\nIf you're hoping to collect these items, good luck. Some of them are quite scarce. Fortunately, the actual print ads that ran in the Sunday funny pages are obtainable and (usually) not terribly expensive.\n\nIf you really want to get crazy, you can try to hunt down this 1978 funnies advertisement from Nestle.\n\nThough it didn't originate with Kenner, it did feature Kenner Star Wars toys -- the large-size figures and X-Wing Fighter, to be specific.\n\nHappy collecting!\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Lyrics of the song featured in the Milky TV commercial:\n\nIt’s fun to milk her\n\nGonna do it right now\n\nShe drinks the water when we pump her tail\n\nShe’s raisin’ her head\n\nIt’s milkin’ time now\n\nHer pre-tend milk is a-fillin’ the pail\n\nMilky the Marvelous Milking Cow!\n\n[2] Friend of the blog Ross Cuddie has a Kenner promotional kit that includes a slick of the full-page advertisement. A slick is a glossy full-size representation of an ad, typically used for reproduction and demonstration. Based on the existence of this slick, I think it's likely the full-page ad was printed in papers. I've just never seen an example.\n\n[3] Interestingly, the patch was pretty similar to a patch offered as a prize in a contest advertised on the packages of Dixie Cups.\n\n[4] Surprisingly, Parade ceased publication only recently: November of 2022.\n\n↧\n\nWhen Star Wars Met Sapporo: The R2-D2-Like Beer Products of Japan\n\nRon writes:\n\nStar Wars licenses have been granted for all manner of products. But how many official licenses are associated with alcoholic beverages? None that I can think of. Though I'll happily admit I'm no expert in this area, I just can't think of any official Star Wars product that's tied to beer. That paucity of official alcohol product makes this article by guest blogger Daryl Whitlow particularly interesting. If you love beer and Star Wars, and you want to collect something that bridges those interests, you might consider seeking out the Sapporo products that Daryl discusses below. Just don't get drunk and fall on your collection.\n\nDaryl writes:\n\nWith the announcement of Celebration Japan and the rise in interest in Star Wars-themed beers, I thought it would be a good time to look back at a couple of items from Sapporo Brewing that might be of interest to collectors.\n\nSapporo Breweries is the oldest brand of beer in Japan (founded 1876). It was created by a Japanese adventurer, Seibei Nakagawa, after he traveled Europe and studied the craft of brewing in Germany. In 1906, three of the major beer companies, including Sapporo, merged into the Dai-Nippon Beer Company and held a virtual monopoly over beer in Japan until after WWII. Once these breweries split up, they tried several ways to try and gain market share for their beer by making them more unique, as most beers in the Japanese style tasted similar. This ultimately led to the can wars of the early 1980s.\n\nWhat do you do when all beer has a similar taste and you need to find a way to convince the consumer to buy your beer? If you don’t change the beer flavor, why not change the can?\n\nSlowly, many of the companies tried different shapes and artwork on their cans. There were lanterns, bamboo shoots, eggs, etc.\n\nFinally, in 1983, Sapporo released the Namarobo can, which resembled R2-D2.\n\nThis can is large -- 8.75 inches tall -- and holds over a liter of beer. The curved dome is a plastic and it opens to provide access to the can. The printed graphics on the front feature multicolored panels, circuits, and a readout.\n\nThe bottom legs look like thrusters from the front; however, when viewed from the side you can definitely see astromech legs. The backside of the can features the beer name, contents, more circuitry, as well as a printed port similar to one of R2’s on its lower left front.\n\nAlthough not a direct copy, this can is definitely inspired by R2-D2.\n\nAs a side note, the can wars also led to the introduction of the big peel Sapporo can that is so familiar today. This 650 ml can was designed to resemble a tumbler, and it originally featured a removable top so that you could drink from it like an actual tumbler glass. Most Japanese found this can too large and it consequently flopped. However, it opened up the market to the United States, where the can was embraced, and Sapporo opened up a US division in 1984. This style of can is still in use today.\n\nIt was also the basis for our next item, CanBot.\n\nIn 2011, Sapporo was hoping to raise awareness of their beer in the US. What better place to do that than the bars themselves, where everyone is already drinking?\n\nEnter CanBot, which was designed by the St. Louis-based Dog & Dwarf firm as an homage to the retro wind-up robots of Japan. The sleek look of CanBot also plays upon the aforementioned big peel Sapporo can resembling R2-D2, although it features arms in place of the can's astromech legs.\n\nThese 2.75\" wind up figures were given to bars so that patrons could play games with them and hopefully join the audience for Sapporo Beer. The three games, also developed by Dog & Dwarf, were Joust, Sumo, and Race. These games were to be set up by the server with the idea that the figures would be retained by the bar at the end of the game.\n\nThere was also a poster produced with instructions explaining how to use the CanBot.\n\nJoust used two Sapporo cans with a plank placed between them. Patrons would wind up the CanBot and place one at each end of the plank. The CanBots walk towards each other, and the last one on the plank wins. Sumo was similar but replaced the cans and plank with a napkin or coaster, to be used as the sumo ring. Once again, the last CanBot standing wins. Race was just that, a race. Choose a start and finish point and let them go. In playing these games, the CanBots were dropped and scratched frequently. Add to this the fact that the people playing with them were drinking in a bar, and it's no surprise that many of these did not survive in good shape -- if they survived at all.\n\nSo there you have it: A few items from Sapporo Brewing that bear a resemblance to the droids of Star Wars!\n\nFor those interested, Sapporo Brewing does offer tours of their brewery; they also have a museum in Hokkaido, Japan. For those thinking about a trip to Japan for Celebration, it might be worth investigating.\n\nCheers, and happy collecting!\n\nThanks to Kei Sato, the Japan Beer Journalists Association, and Ryan Doggendorf for assistance in this article.\n\n↧\n\nWhen Stakes Were Super: The MPC Sweepstakes Promotion of 1979\n\nRon writes:\n\nI've never won a sweepstakes, have you?\n\nCome to think of it, I tend not to enter sweepstakes, possibly because I assume the chances of winning a prize are so low that it's not worth the bother. I also don't like feeling as though I've been roped into some company's backdoor marketing strategy.\n\nAm I being a stick in the mud about this? Probably. But those feelings undergird my lack of interest in sweepstakes-style giveaways, and that's just the way it is.\n\nBut the lure of getting something for nothing can be tantalizing, to children in particular. And that feeling is valuable to a company. Even if a sweepstakes enterer wins nothing, he's spent weeks (perhaps months) engaged with a product. And if he wins, even better -- he may become a fan for life.\n\nThat's surely what spurred dozens of companies to run Star Wars-themed sweepstakes during the years the Original Trilogy was in theaters. Kenner did a few. Dixie Cups did one. I'm sure you can think of others.\n\nThe subject of this article is a sweepstakes sponsored by MPC in 1979.\n\nClose followers of this blog will recall that MPC was the company responsible for the familiar line of plastic model kits representing Star Wars vehicles and spaceships. The company did a whole slew of them, right through 1983 and Return of the Jedi.\n\nBy the end of 1979, MPC's Star Wars line consisted of 10 products, including the large representation of the Millennium Falcon pictured above. I think we can assume the line was a roaring success.\n\nBut by late '79 things must have felt a little stale. Star Wars had been out for more than two years, and The Empire Strikes Back was still more than half a year away. Sure, Star Wars had been rereleased to theaters, but still. Star Wars was old news.\n\nIf you're MPC, how do you keep consumers focused on your brand as you head into the all-important holiday season?\n\nThat's where the MPC sweepstakes comes in.\n\nActually, as you can prove to yourself by examining the print advertisement pictured above, MPC didn't call it a sweepstakes; they called it a Superstakes, which may be the best Star Wars use of \"super\" outside of the George Lucas Super Live Adventure.\n\nI don't know which of the ad's images is my favorite: Luke driving an old-timey pickup truck, Boogie Nights director Paul Thomas Anderson completing an entry form, or R2-D2 straight pimpin' like a muthereffin robo Tony Montana.\n\nBeep!\n\nBut the part of the ad that concerns us most is the bottom. It lists the available prizes and supplies the entry requirements.\n\nUnsurprisingly, most of the prizes were MPC products. Specifically, the company's Star Wars model kits.\n\nWhile third prize was the Millennium Falcon kit pictured earlier in this blog post, fourth prize consisted of MPC's kit representing the bust of Darth Vader.\n\nPerhaps the strangest product released by MPC in association with their Star Wars license, it was designed to move, light up, and even make a breathing noise reminiscent of Vader himself.\n\nFifth prize was some other, presumably less expensive, MPC model kit. The ad doesn't specify which.\n\nWeirdly, the image illustrating this level of prize once again shows the Vader bust. Either it was available as the fifth prize as well as the fourth, or the person who designed the ad made a mistake.\n\nFirst prize was a pile of cash.\n\nThat's right, $5,000 in cold hard jack was promised to the lucky winner.\n\nProvided, that is, he could pry it away from R2-D2. My man R2 looks pretty intent on keeping that cash.\n\nBut by far the nuttiest prize was the second one: a wee old-fashioned pick-up truck that ran on real gasoline.\n\nBut that wasn't all!\n\nPerhaps because this prize had virtually nothing to do with Star Wars, MPC promised to fill its payload with brand new Star Wars model kits.\n\nAs if that wasn't the most redneck thing ever.\n\nProduced by an outfit called Hagstrom's Sales, the pick-up was part of a whole line of gas-powered miniature automobiles. That's the cover of a Hagstrom's catalog you see above.\n\nAnd here's the model that MPC offered as a prize. It was called the Mighty Pick-Up.\n\nWas it nutty for MPC to assume the pick-up should be used to haul around a bunch of model kits? Well, take a look at the image illustrating the pick-up in Hagstrom's catalog.\n\nIt looks like there's an airplane model in the box that guy is carrying.\n\nNaturally, his date looks less than enthused.\n\nWhy did MPC choose a gas-powered pick-up truck as their number two prize?\n\nHonestly, your guess is as good as mine. As far as I know, MPC and Hagstrom's had no official relationship. Maybe someone at MPC just thought it was cool?\n\nOn the other hand, as a company that produced a lot of model kits based on vehicles, MPC catered to people who liked cars and trucks. The Mighty Pick-Up was a truck. So maybe the pairing wasn't as odd as it seems at first blush. [1]\n\nIf you were lucky enough to win a prize in the Superstakes, you were notified by Fundimensions.\n\nAbove is an example of the letter received by Superstakes winners.\n\nAs you can surely tell, it's addressed to one of the 1,000 winners of the fifth prize. I've seen a couple of these letters, and they both concerned the fifth prize. That makes sense, as winners of that prize were by far the most numerous.\n\nHere's the envelope in which the letters were mailed.\n\nIf you're wondering why both the letter and the envelope are branded with the Fundimensions name and logo, it's because Fundimensions was the parent company of MPC -- as well as Craft Master and Lionel. All three of these companies produced licensed Star Wars products. You can read about Lionel's quirky product here. [2]\n\nYou're probably wondering how the prizes were shipped to winners.\n\nWell, we don't know for sure, but the Darth Vader TIE Fighter that you see above came to me accompanied by a winner's letter. And I suppose it's at least somewhat likely that the two items have been paired since 1979.\n\nSo it's possible that this TIE Fighter is representative of the prizes that were mailed to winners.\n\nAs you may have noticed, the box -- which bears no graphics -- is labelled with a number corresponding to the mail-order business of JC Penney. [3] So either kits packaged for JCP (and perhaps other mail-order retailers) were used as Superstakes prizes, or the letter I own and a JCP kit were paired erroneously.\n\nOf course, the version of the Darth Vader TIE Fighter sold in stores came in a box featuring full-color graphics.\n\nAs I mentioned in the introduction of this post, I can't recall entering a sweepstakes as a child.\n\nThe same cannot be said of collector Martin Thurn.\n\nAbove you see a Superstakes entry form completed by Martin back in 1979. It was sent to me by SWCA blogger Jonathan McElwain.\n\nFor some reason, though young Martin took the time to complete it, he never mailed it to Fundimensions.\n\nMy curiosity piqued, I asked Martin about this.\n\nAfter expressing surprise at seeing his name on an old entry form, he said, \"I built some of the models back in the day and tried to get as many entries into the contests as possible.\"\n\nHe then added: \"I've always been a puzzle freak and contest freak . . . And when it came to Star Wars contests I was double freaked.\"\n\nTo obtain his entry forms, Martin wrote to Fundimensions directly.\n\nAbove you see the response he received.\n\nWriting to the company was not as crazy as it sounds: Kids desiring an entry form were instructed to do just that. Just scroll up to the image of the print advertisement and see for yourself.\n\nSo Martin was only following instructions.\n\nBut why, if Martin resided in Columbus, Ohio, as the address on this letter indicates, did his entry form specify a Florida residence?\n\nBecause he was trying to game the system, of course!\n\n\"They always said 'one entry per person' or whatever,\" he told me, \"so I used friends' and neighbors' addresses . . . The hard question is, whom did I know in Florida at the time . . . to trust them to give me the prize if it was sent to them?\"\n\nThe rules, printed on the reverse of the entry form, do indeed limit prizes to \"one . . . per family.\" Second paragraph, third sentence.\n\nMaybe Martin never submitted this entry form because his ringer in Florida refused to participate in this little scheme?\n\nIt's possible.\n\nOf course, writing to Fundimensions for a form was a pretty labor-intensive entry method. Surely not all kids were as industrious as Martin Thurn.\n\nHow did lazier children enter the contest?\n\nFortunately, SWCA co-editor Pete Vilmur was able to supply me with images of something very special.\n\nAnd that something answers the question I just posed.\n\nIt's what appears to be a complete promotional kit related to the Superstakes. It was sent to retailers, who were expected to display its materials in high-traffic areas of their establishments. In doing so they advertised the promotion to consumers.\n\nThe kit includes a cardstock shelf-talker with a pouch designed to hold copies of the entry form.\n\nThe piece behind the shelf-talker is a cardstock sign intended to be hung elsewhere in the retail location. It measures 17\" x 22\".\n\nAs you've no doubt noticed, both items feature the graphic that decorates the entry form.\n\nThe graphic appears again on this 34\" x 22\" poster, also included in the kit. One of the very few examples known to have survived, it's got to be one of the cooler Star Wars advertising posters of the era.\n\nWell, that's about all I have on the MPC Superstakes of 1979. A curious promotion, for sure, and one with some interesting collectible material tied to it.\n\nIf anyone is looking to sell any items deriving from the promotional kit, don't hesitate to contact me!\n\nSpecial thanks to Mark Enright, Luis Villagomez, Jonathan McElwain, Martin Thurn, and Pete Vilmur for their invaluable assistance in collecting the information and photos featured in this blog post.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] This is the second time I've blogged about miniature gas-powered vehicles. See here for the previous post.\n\n[2] Though the linked blog post doesn't mention Lionel, the Power Passers product line definitely fell under the Lionel umbrella.\n\n[3] The JC Penney mail-order division offered the Darth Vader TIE Fighter model in 1978. By 1979, when the Superstakes occurred, the product was no longer featured in the retailer's holiday catalog. It's possible that unsold examples packaged for JCP in 1978 were used by MPC for Superstakes fulfillment in 1979.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nThe Hottest Thing Agoin' is Star Wars: Kenner and the Holidays, 1978-1980\n\nRon writes:\n\nFor many constituents of Generation X, memories of Kenner Star Wars toys are interwoven with memories of the holiday season, that special time of the year when we celebrate religion, solstice, and the wonders of consumerism -- and not necessarily in that order.\n\nIn the '70s and '80s, walking into a store during the holiday season was like walking into a new world -- you felt a little like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, as she opens that monochrome door and beholds the Technicolor vista of a more glamorous realm.\n\nThere was the sense that, for a few weeks at least, the world was changed. It was more colorful and beneficent, and less bound by the drabness of rules and everyday prudence. During the holiday season, teachers made exceptions and parents made cookies. We stayed up late and ate things we shouldn't. And when we went to a retail location, it seemed as though the emphasis had been taken off of adults and placed on us.\n\nIt was probably this sense of inversion that made the holiday season so powerful. Indeed, it was as though a whole society had conspired to put aside grownup concerns and cater to childish fancy. Even mom and dad seemed a little more childlike during the holidays.\n\nMaybe it's still like this in some locales during the holidays. But my general sense is that today the holiday experience is less communal, less bedizened, and less, well, magical.\n\nBut, then, I'm an adult, and maybe I just lack the ability to recognize the magic. After all, the adults back in Kansas didn't see what Dorothy saw; they didn't even believe her when she told them about it.\n\nSWCA editor John Wooten lounges like a boss on Christmas of 1980\n\nNo, to really pass judgement on the holidays, you need to be a child. And since I'm not one, I guess I'll shut up and get on with this blog post.\n\nAs the above article from the Hanover Evening Sun demonstrates, adults have always had trouble harmonizing their holiday expectations with those of their children. Published in December of 1978, it indicates that grownups of the time were confused.\n\nSpecifically, they wondered: What is the deal with all of this space nonsense?\n\nToys and Christmas may be a traditional combination, but if you're looking for nostalgia in the gifts you give to children this year, someone is going to be disappointed.\n\nAccording to the salespersons in local toy stores, Saturday morning television has more of an influence on what children want for Christmas than any family memories.\n\nThe sleds and footballs of yesteryear, the cowboy guns and dolls and tea sets -- all have been replaced at the top of children's Christmas lists by computerized games and the laser firing craft of Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica.\n\nWinnie the Pooh, although still a favorite, now has some stiff competition from Chewbacca, the ape-like creature who was the hero's sidekick in Star Wars.\n\nWow, I've never imagined Chewbacca kicking the sh*t out of Winnie the Pooh, but now I can't help it.\n\nRegular readers of this blog are probably aware that the holiday season of 1978 was a big deal for Kenner and Lucasfilm.\n\nThough the first Star Wars products debuted just prior to Christmas of 1977, availability in that year was limited to paper and cardboard items, as traditional plastic toys typically require a full year to develop and produce. Star Wars debuted in May of 1977. Kenner was granted a license by Lucasfilm a few months before that. Consequently, Kenner's 1977 range of products was limited to a few puzzles, a board game, a couple of paintsets, and the infamous Early Bird Certificate Package, the last basically a promise of toys at a later date.\n\nSo 1978 was Kenner's first real go at the holidays with a full slate of Star Wars product. As you can imagine, they wanted to make the most of it.\n\nRobyn Willer looks pretty happy getting Star Wars for Christmas\n\nNot only were 12 action figures available, a whole range of action-figure accessories was released alongside them: the X-Wing Fighter, TIE Fighter, Land Speeder, even a huge playset representing the Death Star space station. But that wasn't all. Kenner also released an extensive slate of side products that had no relationship to action figures: inflatable bop bags, electronic games, roleplay weaponry, a toothbrush.\n\nIt was Kenner's largest range of products ever, and they hoped to sell the heck out of it.\n\nAs the Evening Sun reporter mentions, it was the action figures in particular that people were crazy for.\n\nAll the Star Wars figures, the X-Wing fighters and Tie fighters, head the list of fast-selling items, say store managers . . . \"We can't keep enough of that Star Wars stuff in stock,\" says Bill Negley, retired manager of Joe the Motorist's Friend who's back filling in at Christmas time.\n\nDang, Star Wars was so hot that Bill came out of retirement to sell it!\n\nThis article, from the November 23, 1978 edition of the Frankfort Star, repeats the emphasis on the overthrow of tradition, as spacemen replaced toy soldiers in the fantasies of children across America.\n\n\"We can't keep Star Wars items on the shelf,\" explained Dede Dubois, manager of Toys by Rizzi at the Lincoln Mall. Other related space toys, such as the Star Bird, a flying object that emits all sorts of pertinent sounds, are also doing well, she said.\n\nThe situation is the same at other stores. Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica action figures, space ships, and command stations are popular at Toys-R-Us in Burbank . . .\n\nAt the J.C. Penney toy department in Orland Square, Star Wars is the biggest, and most sold-out item, according to Sharlene Ballard. The stuffed Chewbacca figure and remote control R2-D2 and land speeder are also big sellers, she said.\n\nOf course, the Land Speeder in question was the Sonic-Controlled version of the toy, a J.C. Penney exclusive. No wonder it was so popular!\n\nKids probably loved it until it inevitably broke on December 28.\n\nSo popular was Star Wars in late 1978 that in some areas shoppers couldn't find the products they desired.\n\nAs this item from the Evening Chronicle of Marshall, Michigan demonstrates, rumors of shortages ran rampant. Some even claimed they were part of a dastardly scheme devised by Kenner!\n\nSanta Claus may have to disappoint a lot of kids this year, especially if they put a \"Star Wars\" toy or electronic game on their Christmas lists . . .\n\n[Milton Schulman, editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine], says the shortage in \"Star Wars\" toys was an intentional decision by Kenner, the exclusive manufacturer of such toys.\n\nHe said Kenner, which makes 40 different \"Star Wars\" toys, wanted to keep the demand for the toys high into next year by producing a limited amount of them. He noted the sequel to the movie probably won't be released until late 1979 or early 1980.\n\nThis derivative piece, from the News of New Castle, Pennsylvania, expands on this rumor by describing a situation in which Kenner had not fulfilled long-standing product orders.\n\n\"We couldn't get half of the Star Wars toys,\" related the assistant manager of one store, \"and we ordered them in August.\"\n\nGosh, maybe Kenner really was throttling supply?\n\nCould it be?\n\nYou know what this reminds me of?\n\nYou guessed it, the great Stormtrooper shortage of 1979, when California was plagued by a dearth of Stormtrooper figures that still haunts the memories of those who survived it.\n\nIt was seriously rough out there.\n\nPeople were so starved for Stormtroopers that in some localities they were making them out of wadded up paper and toothpaste.\n\nI wrote about it back here.\n\nI bring this up now because, in 1979, this and similar shortages were attributed by retailers to a number of causes, including Kenner malfeasance and a mysterious factory fire.\n\nFortunately, in this case, the reporter did Kenner a favor by contacting their PR guy Dave De Mala, who calmly explained that the product pipeline at a large toy company entails a lot of logistical finessing. Sometimes it's just not possible to keep all retail outlets filled with product, especially during the busy holiday season.\n\n\"The problem is, in the toy industry, you never know when a toy is going to get hot -- every year you get some toys that are suddenly very, very hot, and there's not much you can do about it. You can't predict it.\"\n\nFor instance, De Mala explained, if a toy becomes popular between Thanksgiving and Christmas, there is no way the company can increase production.\n\n\"We are finished with production by October 15,\" he said.\n\nAs for the factory fire, De Mala denied it.\n\nThe lesson of this digression is that popular toys are always hard to get during the holidays.\n\nThere was even a movie made about it starring the tall guy from Twins.\n\nThe toys need to be manufactured (often overseas), shipped to the toy company, distributed, and put on store shelves. And then restocked when needed. All in a short timeframe, and at that time without the aid of computers.\n\nIt was, and is, difficult.\n\nCertainly, Kenner kept a tight rein on inventory, as no company wants to carry a ton of unsold stock; it affects the balance sheet and looks bad on shareholder reports. And, sure, they probably gave some thought to maintaining the demand for Star Wars. But I don't think they were intentionally shorting supply -- not to any significant degree, anyway. Christmas of 1978 was Kenner's big opportunity. No one knew if the sequel to Star Wars would be a success, and they wanted to sell lots of product while they could.\n\nAnd they succeeded: According to De Mala, Kenner sold 40 million Star Wars items in 1978 alone. Does that sound like a company that's limiting supply?\n\nConspiracy theories addressed, let's get back to 1978.\n\nAs the above article, from the Sandusky Register, attests, supply issues were also a topic of conversation in Ohio.\n\nIt's a well-balanced piece, reflecting the opinions of retailers who were quite satisfied with their allotment of Kenner product, and others who weren't.\n\nLocal stores said they had received at least three shipments of the Star Wars toys this season. The hottest items seem to be the 3-to-4-inch dolls and the vehicles such as the land speeder, Ty-fighter, and X-wing fighter. Also selling rapidly are the cardboard cantinas and Death Star stations.\n\nThose few merchants with well-stocked supplies of the items are K mart, JC Penney, and Circus World.\n\nDan Lafferty, at K mart, said an ample supply of most items is available. \"We're right where we want to be for right now,\" he said.\n\nHe said there seemed to be a short supply earlier in the season and the supplies are \"going down daily.\"\n\nThe JC Penney store at the Sandusky Mall is also well-stocked with Star Wars gear for the holiday season.\n\nRoger Rigby reported sales there of the popular figures and vehicles and other items was \"selling real good. We should be able to handle any customers' needs (in the Star Wars line),\" he said.\n\nCircus World, also at the Mall, reported the store was able to get most items, including the Death Star station, which came in with a recent shipment.\n\n\"We get a truck in every week which is pretty well stocked,\" said John Schweser. \"The games are selling fairly well and the laser pistols moderately well. We've sold several of the R2D2 remote control robots, too.\"\n\nOthers were less sanguine.\n\n\"The Star Wars items are very hard to get,\" related a Sears representative, \"We can't get any more in.\" Though he did note that \"the cantinas are selling very rapidly.\"\n\nOf course, this being Sears, he was likely talking about the Cantina Adventure Set that was exclusive to the company. You know, the one that included the infamous blue version of Snaggletooth. Let's hope Mr. Schweser bought some of those for himself and stored them away!\n\nWhile we're on the topic of specific Kenner products, it's worth noting what the spokesperson representing Montgomery Ward told the Register reporter regarding the line of large-size action figures: \"The bigger Star Wars dolls don't seem to be going nearly as fast as the small ones,\" he said. \"We have several of the larger dolls left and some more coming in.\"\n\nFamously, the large-size line lasted only two years, Kenner deciding to axe it early in 1980. Such expressions of dissatisfaction on the part of retail representatives went a long way at Kenner. They were surely one of the factors behind the line's eventual cancellation.\n\nThis article, from the News of Port Arthur, Texas, emphasizes the salability of Star Wars toys over their absence from store shelves. In other words, it characterizes their occasional scarcity (correctly, I think) not as the result of Kenner scheming, but as the natural upshot of extreme popularity.\n\nThe toys were popular. Of course they were hard to find!\n\nIn the words of Nettie Smith at the Toy Palace: \"The hottest thing agoin' is Star Wars.\"\n\nAnd Sylvia Miller at The Toy Box in Beaumont adds, \"It comes in and out of here so fast, it makes your head spin.\"\n\nThe Force is definitely in force.\n\nStar Wars was around for Christmas to a minor extent last year. The problem this year is that Star Wars has continued its popularity and no store has a full stock of every item available.\n\nThat's mostly because there are more than 60 items, which run up a tab of more than $500 for all. That doesn't include all the T-shirts, costumes, and posters available in the Star Wars series.\n\nYou can buy something from the series for anywhere from $3 to more than $90 for one item. Most expensive is the X-Wing Aces Target game by Kenner. It's just a fancy version of a shooting gallery.\n\nThere are lots of other fancy names floating around in the Star Wars series, too. You can buy Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia Organa, Han Solo, See Threepio (C-3PO), Artoo-Detoo (R2-D2), Darth Vader, among others.\n\nThe Death Star Space Station is the hardest to get, though, local store managers say. That's followed in scarcity by the Land Speeder, the X-Wing Fighter, and the Tie Fighter -- vehicles featured in the movie.\n\nThere are plush toys, a painting set, a poster set, an Action Play set which makes Playdoh figures, a Luke Skywalker A.M. Headset Radio, a laser pistol, a rifle, an electric toothbrush, bop bags, jigsaw puzzles, a movie viewer, a van set, books, a scale model kit and tape cassettes with music and narrated story.\n\nThat's not all. There are several Star Wars games available too. The Electronic Laser Battle Game by Kenner costs about $30. The winner is the first player to reach Death Star and trigger the planet's destruction. Adventures of R2-D2 and Escape from Death Star are two other games.\n\nAnd if you want more, there's also jewelry, available with the Star Wars characters featured.\n\nIt's interesting that the Death Star, the priciest item in the Kenner action figure line, was so scarce. Though that may have had more to do with production numbers than popularity.\n\nSteven Latta gets a Death Star for Christmas\n\nIf you're wondering why the Millennium Falcon features in none of these stories, it's because it didn't exist. The Falcon was a 1979 product. As of December 1978, Kenner's action-figure vehicle line consisted of three products: the X-Wing, TIE Fighter, and Land Speeder.\n\nAlso discussed in the News piece: The popularity of products deriving from other space-centered media properties.\n\nNow, if your kid is not a Star Wars fan but is a space fanatic, you've got other choices to make. Ideal manufactures the Star Team action figures and cosmic cruisers. Mego puts out the Micronauts, Galactic Command Center and interplanetary headquarters. Mattel has the Shogun Warriors. New this year in Shogun is the three-inch die-cast metal figures.\n\nBesides Star Wars, the next space vehicles to get attention are the Star Birds put out by Milton Bradley. The craft makes realistic cosmic sounds as it dives or ascends.\n\nMilton Bradley had the Star Bird, as well as the very popular electronic game known as Simon, but probably the bigger threat to the ascendancy of Star Wars during the Christmas of 1978 was Battlestar Galactica.\n\nAs SWCA editor Tommy Garvey mentions here, Star Wars and Battlestar had a contentious relationship right from the start. Fox sued Universal. Lucasfilm almost sued the Battlestar effects firm, led by former ILM whiz John Dykstra. It was like a schoolyard tiff or something. So Kenner must have been especially annoyed to enter the Christmas season of 1978 and find itself facing off against Mattel and its line of Battlestar toys.\n\nHow do I know Mattel was a real challenger in 1978?\n\nLetters to Santa seem like a pretty good indicator.\n\nOf the dozens of letters featured in this edition of the Chillicothe Constitution Tribune, two mention Star Wars while three mention Battlestar Galactica.\n\nSo Battlestar wins this round. Take a bow, Battlestar Galactica. You've earned it.\n\nI guess it's a substantial marketing advantage to have the ability to pipe your show into homes around the country on a weekly basis.\n\nAs a perusal of the below excerpt will show, Travis chose to be diplomatic and ask for toys representing both popular space properties.\n\nBryan, on the other hand, chose violence.\n\n\"I want Battlestar Galactica jets\" is about as definitive as it gets.\n\nAs for Theresa, it's clear that she wasn't interested in space toys. It's also clear that her second-grade class had just completed the lesson in which they learned that \"E\" is for \"elphat.\"\n\nChad, in contrast to Travis and Bryan, was a Star Wars-only kinda guy. No cheap knockoffs for Chad.\n\nActually, I take that back, because in addition to legit Kenner product, Chad asked for the definitely not-Kenner figures that appeared in the 1978 Montgomery Ward catalog under the somewhat dodgy label \"Barroom scene figures.\"\n\nThere they are right beside Kenner's licensed toys.\n\nLike I said: Dodgy!\n\nChad's home must have been on the mailing lists of both Montgomery Ward and Sears, as he also asked for the legitimate cantina figures, which at that time were exclusive to the latter retailer, and proudly advertised in their holiday catalog.\n\nIt's funny how he lumps them all together without distinction: \"I want the . . . Barroom scene figures: Yog, Ridal, Lago [actually Tago], Bico, Greedo, Snaggeltooth, Hammerhead, and Walrus Man . . .\"\n\nAssuming Santa brought him all of these figures, how do you reckon he reacted upon unwrapping the Montgomery Ward figures and realizing they were eight inches tall?\n\nMaybe he pretended they were giants?\n\nI think we've demonstrated that the 1978 holiday season was a pivotal moment for Star Wars merchandise. There were shortages, conspiracy theories, knockoffs!\n\nBut what about subsequent holiday seasons? How did the public interface with Star Wars during those seasonal merchandising bonanzas?\n\n1979 we've already discussed, albeit briefly. No need to revisit the Stormtrooper shortage of that year. Frankly, it's too upsetting.\n\nBut I do have some datapoints from 1980, which of course was the year in which the first franchise sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, debuted in theaters.\n\nJason Shoemaker's 1980 Christmas haul\n\nThe first is a column containing letters to Santa published by the News of Monahans, Texas.\n\nBy that point in time, Kenner's large Millennium Falcon toy had been released, and it topped Danny's want list. The remainder of his wants, with the exception of Darth Vader, derived from the 1980 line of ESB product. That makes a lot of sense. What kid of the era didn't want new toys from The Empire Strikes Back?\n\nGotta love that mention of the die-cast TIE Bomber, an item that remains scarce to this day.\n\nJeff Bowen got the Millennium Falcon for Christmas in 1980\n\nIn the Ottumwa, Iowa area, Star Wars continued to hold sway, if 1980 letters to Santa are any indication.\n\nI have to confess, though, that my favorite letter in the December 1, 1980 edition of the local Courier has nothing at all to do with Star Wars.\n\nMissy apparently confused Santa with the Tooth Fairy -- a fairly understandable blunder!\n\nMore pertinent to our current line of questioning is the below letter from Casey.\n\nThis kid asked for Enpire Sricks Back everything: recherds, cards, underues, lundhboxes -- he wanted it awl!\n\nAnd he wanted some pre-ESB products too, like the Three-Position Laser Rifle and the rare X-Wing Aces.\n\nBut the absolute best thing about the letter is that Casey took the trouble to append trademark notations to most of the official Star Wars names.\n\nIt's tempting to speculate that Casey had his eye on a future legal career, or that one of his parents was an intellectual property lawyer, but I suspect the real explanation is that he copied the names directly out of a catalog or something similar, and figured the \"TMs\" were essential information that Santa should be made aware of. Otherwise, he might leave some untrademarked POS under the Christmas tree come December 25.\n\nWho knows, he might leave Montgomery Ward's barroom figures, or perhaps something even worse.\n\nJeff Tangeman and the ESB figures he got for Christmas in 1980\n\nSo, yes, Star Wars was still on kids' minds come the holiday season of 1980 -- though by that time the gift requests had become pretty ESB-centric.\n\nAs far as I can tell, shortages stopped being much of a concern after 1979. Either shoppers became less mad about Star Wars or Kenner got better at managing the supply chain (I suspect the latter).\n\nBut, as the below item from the Times-Advocate of Escondido, California demonstrates, Kenner-related conspiracies continued to be mooted by the toy-buying public.\n\nAmerica does love a good conspiracy!\n\nFortunately, in this case, the conspiracy theorizing was more than a little facetious.\n\nAs we learned in our discussion of 1978, parents of the era were often perplexed by their kids' rejection of traditional fare in favor of toys focused on electronics and space. In this piece, columnist Larry Littlfield expresses similar confusion related to Kenner, the suddenly hot toy company that seemed to monopolize his kids' holiday want lists.\n\nHaving conquered the boys market with Star Wars, Kenner had, by 1980, conquered the girls market as well. Little girls were just wild about the company's Strawberry Shortcake line.\n\nSo parents were getting the Kenner hustle from both sides of the gender divide come Christmastime.\n\n\"Apparently,\" notes Littlefield, \"there's a Kenner conspiracy going on among my offspring.\"\n\nLittlefield's musings on Star Wars are likely to strike a chord with anyone who was a parent during the initial Star Wars craze of the '70s and '80s.\n\nThey also provide a yet another peek into the wonderfully inverted holiday world so many of us experienced as children, a world in which, for a brief moment, kids had the upper hand, and their parents couldn't help but engage with the frivolity of toys.\n\nI just wonder how stilly I look standing there trying to choose between Bossk, the alien bounty hunter; Lando Calrissian, the leader of Cloud City's Bespin mining colony; FX-7, the medial droid and some of the original 21 figures.\n\n1 spot popular R2-D2, but where did R5-D4 come from? I must have missed something in the movie.\n\nKenner's surprise figure -- he's not even listed in the catalog -- is Yoda, the 900-year-old Jedi master. Randy Hogan, manager of The Play Company in Escondido, tells me 48 Yoda figures lasted just six days in his store.\n\nAlong with the figures, there are \"adventure sets\" that include such things as Hoth Ice Planet; an Imperial Attack Base; Darth Vader's Star Destroyer; a Death Star Space Station and even a radio-controlled Jawa Sandcrawler.\n\nTauntaun, the Hoth snow creature, has been the most popular, according to Hogan, but I've decided to get my boy a Droid Factory.\n\nSays the catalog, \"With 33 interchangeable parts, a child can build five different robots at a time, including R2-D2 with three legs or a four-wheel robot that rolls.\"\n\nHey, what's this \"a child can build\" stuff?\n\nWhat about ol' dad?\n\nI'll get him a Droid Factory, but I just might get myself an Imperial Tie Fighter and if he doesn't let me build robots, too, I'll blast him off the floor with my red laser cannon!\n\nI'll tell you, they didn't build toys like these when I was a kid. My wife will say that was just last week.\n\nOf course, it's now 2023, and toy stores have practically ceased to exist.\n\nI wonder how Larry would feel if you were to travel back to 1980 and tell him that.\n\nWhat if you told him about malls -- that they're being abandoned, and no longer take pride in decking themselves out as holiday wonderlands?\n\nAnd how do you reckon he'd feel learning that toy giant Hasbro, the inheritor of the Kenner Star Wars license, is closing offices and laying off employees, because, to put it bluntly (and maybe exaggerating just a bit), no one wants toys anymore?\n\nHe probably wouldn't believe you.\n\nShoot, I don't believe you, and I live in 2023.\n\nBut I guess that's an upshot of that perceptual disjunct I mentioned at the top of this piece. I'm an adult, and my understanding and expectations of the world were formulated in a different era.\n\nThey'll probably stay there.\n\nSpecial thanks to Tom Berges and Igrewupstarwars for providing the children-at-Christmas photos.
