        "text": "With Frags Like These: The Boreal Fragment\n\nAs Borealia collided with Nodera in the Therocene, it left behind a small isolated piece that remained a secluded ecosystem: the Boreal Fragment. This patch of land has remained untouched by other clades for many centuries, though it has experienced its own degrees of die-offs as the climate fluctuated during the Glaciocene.\n\nToday, its primary megafaunal inhabitants are ungulopes and flightless ratbats-of-prey, just like the fauna they had in the Therocene. While ungulopes are thriving nearly everywhere else and following the spread of saberleaf, acting as ecosystem engineers in the process, the same cannot be said for their predators, whose kind have been wiped out on Borealonodera by the introduction of other carnivore clades. Now the flightless ratbats-of-prey are a dying breed, barely hanging on in an isolated landmass that has served as a lifeboat for this clade.\n\nThis continent's herbivores are, unsurprisingly, ungulopes, which descend from the original lineages that had lived on Borealia before its collision with Nodera. The altolopes (Borealoantilomys spp.) are this region's high-browser herbivores, feeding on the abundance of conifer trees that grow up in the north. With their long necks and forelimbs, the altolopes mimic the adaptations of a distant cousin of the ungulopes, the girats, though none of the three extant species grow anywhere near as tall, averaging six feet in height at the most.\n\nOther ungulopes have flourished in this landmass as well, like the herding, tundra-grazing hamibou (Wapiticricetus pranci) that lives in the plains of the northern reach of the Borealian fragment. Others, such as the woodtrotter (Gracilungulus borealis) lives in the forest floors and scrublands, browsing on low tree branches, young saplings, and bushes and shrubs within its reach.\n\nThe flightless ratbats-of-prey, in the meantime, are dwindling in diversity, but still hanging on, a briefly-successful evolutionary experiment now well on its last legs. None are apex predators like the batdogs once were: now all that remain are azhdarchid-like stalkers of small prey, like the battorks (Nyctornimimus spp.), omnivorous scavengers that supplement their diet with insects, carrion and even fruit and plant matter, like the boreal egrat (Fragmareginus regalis), and small tree-climbers such as the crookpaw (Nyctolatrans condilambulus), a small-game hunter that hunts both in the trees and on the ground, seldom taking on prey bigger than a small basal hamtelope, but occasionally targets the vulnerable calves of larger ungulope species."
