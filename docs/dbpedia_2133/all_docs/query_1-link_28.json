        "text": "the Special Trustees of Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and Oxford University Press announce:\n\nIt is with immense pleasure that [we] can reveal that the illustrator of Geraldine McCaughrean's Peter Pan in Scarlet, the official sequel to JM Barrie's Peter Pan, will be the globally renowned artist Brian Froud. The announcement is made today at the 2006 Bologna Children's Book Fair, the world's leading event in children's book publishing.\n\nFrom the time Great Ormond Street Hospital first announced the commissioning of the official sequel in August 2004 it was clear that finding an appropriate illustrator was not going to be easy. Whoever was chosen would be following in the footsteps of Arthur Rackham, one of the greatest, most celebrated illustrators of all time. It is entirely fitting that Brain Froud has been selected to be the illustrator of Peter Pan in Scarlet. Not only is he internationally regarded as a visionary artist and as a world authority on faeries and faery folklore, but he also cites Rackham as one of his chief creative influences and inspirations.\n\nBrian's lifetime fascination with the world of faery has provided the foundation of his diverse and highly original creative life. He is the author of the best-selling books Faeries (with Tolkien illustrator Alan Lee) and Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book (with Terry Jones) and was the conceptual designer of Jim Henson's classic fantasy films The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth.\n\nBorn in Winchester in 1947, Brian Froud graduated with Honours from Maidstone College of Art in 1971 with a degree in Graphic Design. ï¿½Following graduation Brian moved to London where he worked on projects in advertising and publishing, and began illustrating books.\n\nFor over 30 years, Brian Froud's significant accomplishments have spanned a wide variety of media and a diverse range of applications. His internationally best-selling book, Faeries (with Tolkien illustrator Alan Lee) is considered a modern classic. With over 5 million books sold to date, Brian has continued to revolutionise the concept of \"faery\" in his hugely successful titles, Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book (with Monty Python's Terry Jones), Good Faeries/Bad Faeries and The Faeries' Oracle. Recent works include Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Letters and the 20th Anniversary Edition of The World of the Dark Crystal.\n\nBrian's landmark work with Jim Henson as conceptual designer on feature films The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth and other Henson projects set new standards for design, puppeteering and animatronics in film and are considered landmarks in the evolution of modern day special effects. It was on the set of The Dark Crystal that Brian met and later married, Wendy Midener, a puppet designer and creator of \"Yoda\" (from The Empire Strikes Back).\n\nBrian's work has been licensed by numerous companies around the world including Hot Topic, Sideshow Collectibles, C&D Visionary, Treefree Greetings, Chateau Lorane Winery, and Fenton & Lee Chocolates. Since 2002, the annually produced Faerieworlds Festival - an art, music and theatre experience inspired by Brian's work - has regularly attracted over 5000 attendees. He is currently beginning the initial concept designs for a sequel to The Dark Crystal and will soon start working with a major Hollywood studio to produce a live action/CGI feature film based on his book, Goblins!. Brian is also scheduled to supply faery themed designs for a water-themed theatrical production and retail area in Las Vegas.\n\nBrian has won numerous awards, including the ASFA Best Interior Illustration and the Hugo Award for Best Original Artwork in 1995. Through his unique style - utilizing acrylics, coloured pencil, pastels and ink - he has created some of the most well known fantasy images of the 21st Century. His work has been featured in exhibitions throughout the world and his paintings reside in many private and public collections. He lives in Devon, England with his wife, internationally acclaimed doll maker, Wendy Froud, and their son, Toby.\n\nThe Official website of Brian & Wendy Froud is: www.worldoffroud.com.\n\n[biographical details from Press Release]\n\nAhmet Zappa, Hollywood based youngest son of late rock legend Frank Zappa, has signed a major three book deal with Puffin Books.\n\nThe first, The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless, will be published in the UK by Puffin in August 2006 with a simultaneous release in the US by Random House.\n\nLegendary talent spotter, literary agent Darley Anderson, whose bestselling clients include Martina Cole, Lee Child, Lesley Pearse, John Connolly, Constance Briscoe and childrenï¿½s author Cathy Cassidy conducted a fiercely contested auction which finally ended with Puffin Fiction Publisher, Sarah Hughes, securing UK and Commonwealth rights.\n\nDarley Anderson said: ï¿½As soon as I read the ms of The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless I realized it was very special and very commercial, which is why I turned down a ï¿½150,000 pre-emptive bid offer and went to auction. The auction went on for weeks and was one of the most fiercely contested Iï¿½ve ever conducted. Finally Puffin just edged it over the underbidder HarperCollins.\n\nï¿½The advance is monstrously enormous by any standard but it will sell by the truckload.\n\nï¿½Ahmet has a wild and wonderful imagination and as Disney recognized, his monsters will prove irresistibly appealing and highly merchandisable. Kids and adults alike will love it.ï¿½\n\nSarah Hughes says: ï¿½When I read The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless I got that gut reaction that told me I was reading something that had the power to reach vast numbers of children. It has such direct child appeal, itï¿½s the kind of book that turns non-readers in to readers. This kind of distinctive talent doesnï¿½t come along every day. We are thrilled to welcome Ahmet to Puffin.ï¿½\n\nWalt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films have already paid $1.5 million for the film rights to The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless. Disney and Bruckheimer won a bidding war against Warner Brosï¿½ David Heyman and Paramountï¿½s Plan B that began just days after Zappa finished the manuscript. Ahmetï¿½s US agent Helen Breitweiser brokered this deal as well as the US sale to Random House.\n\nRandom House Childrenï¿½s Books has announced the acquisition of a fantasy adventure series from author Philip Caveney. Sebastian Darke: Prince of Fools will be the first of three novels acquired by Charlie Sheppard at RHCB. Caveney is a copywriter currently living in Manchester.\n\nThe authorï¿½s dï¿½but work for children is pitched squarely at the 9+ market. Featuring the eponymous hero (a would-be jester desperate to make money, let alone make people laugh); a shaggy, sarcastic ï¿½buffalopeï¿½ called Max who can talk (and does, at great length); and Cornelius, an unlikely warrior in constant search of adventure, it's described by the publisher as \"a fast, funny story that will grip readers from the very first page. Fans of Shrek, Terry Pratchett and The Princess Bride will not be disappointed!\"\n\nCharlie Sheppard, Editorial Director at RHCB comments ï¿½I am hugely excited about this find. Sebastian Darke has everything I look for in a classic childrenï¿½s book: humour, excitement and a touch of pathos that will speak to generations of children. As I read the manuscript I felt like a ten year old again discovering a lifetimeï¿½s favourite book. I canï¿½t wait to get kids reading this book and Iï¿½m so thrilled that weï¿½re going to be publishing it.ï¿½\n\nThe deal is for World Rights, all languages.\n\nSebastian Darke: Prince of Fools will be published by The Bodley Head hardback in early Spring 2007 to be supported by a \"massive publicity and marketing campaign\".\n\nThe Welsh Books Council has announced the titles on the short list of the prestigious Tir na n-Og Awards 2006 which recognise the exceptional quality and range of books for children and teenagers.\n\nThe Awards are presented annually by the Books Council to acknowledge the work of authors and illustrators of childrenï¿½s books in three categories: the best English-language title, the best Welsh-language book for the primary sector and the best Welsh-language books for the secondary sector.\n\nTwo of the awards are sponsored by CILIP Wales.\n\nï¿½It is a great honour for these authors and publishers to have their books on the short list,ï¿½ said Menna Lloyd Williams, Head of the Books Councilï¿½s Childrenï¿½s Books Department, ï¿½as the awards reflect the best of childrenï¿½s books from Wales.ï¿½\n\nThe winners of the Awards will be announced later in April.\n\nThe following titles have been nominated for this yearï¿½s short list:\n\nBest English-language Title\n\nFramed, Frank Cottrell Boyce (Macmillan)\n\nTirionï¿½s Secret Journal, Jenny Sullivan (Pont Books)\n\nThe Wish House, Celia Rees (Picador)\n\nBest Welsh-language Primary Title\n\nCarreg Ateb, Emily Huws (Cymdeithas Lyfrau Ceredigion)\n\nFfion aï¿½r Tï¿½m Rygbi, Elin Meek (Gwasg Gomer)\n\nStori Cyn Cysgu, gol.
