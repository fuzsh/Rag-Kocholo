Over the years we have seen many of the indie authors from issues past go from unknown debuts to worldwide sensations. Here's to another debut issue we hope to look back on and celebrate each authors success. Be sure to check out our feature \"16 New & Upcoming Memoirs\" on page 19 to discover new and compelling stories that are sure to make you see the world a little differently. In this issue we sit down with new authors about their indie debuts include Judith F. Brenner the author of The Moments Between Dreams, N.E. Davenport the author of The Blood Trial, Thuy Da Lam author of Fire Summer, and Demisty Bellinger author of New to Liberty. We also have exclusive excerpts of new indie debuts to get a sneak peek on titles releasing the coming months."
