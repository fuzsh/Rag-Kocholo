        "text": "# Name Sprite Description Level Habitat Drops 001 Chippermunk The adorable chippermunk uses its cute looks as a weapon. If you see one, you will probably want to snuggle up to it and give it a big hug. Don't. It would be bad. 7 Magic Academy (Amigo Dungeon) Crimson frog 002 Sniffles Its actual name is long and difficult to pronounce, so everyone just calls it \"Sniffles\" for short. Instead of fire, it sneezes a disgusting gob of green guck. 8 Great Dragon Road\n\nTangerine Beach\n\nMandarin Beach\n\nDragon Beach Ice cube 003 Merlechaun Born of fire, these flame sprites feel compelled to hang out in the frigid cold. Many suspect this is just to show everyone exactly how crazy they are. 14 Carbonara Jungle (Amigo Dungeon) Violet frog 004 Atomic firebat Beware the bite of the atomic firebat: it burns hotter than the hottest salsa. Daring chefs try to harvest their glands, with delicious (but often tragic) results. 16 Jalapeno Wasteland\n\nWorld Seam Bat husk 005 Guyclops This thickheaded giant loves to dance. Its lack of peripheral vision makes this a dangerous prospect. Don't be afraid to share a dance with him! 16 Jalapeno Wasteland\n\nWorld Seam Monster meat 006 Lava lumpling These creatures form when a fireproof seed falls into hot magma. The resulting creature mopes around for a while, wondering if its flower will ever bloom. 18 Jalapeno Wasteland\n\nWorld Seam Pyramid hat 007 Fireclaw Nobody knows who crafted the containment unit that allows these fire elementals to leave their molten homes, but whoever it was has a lot of explaining to do. 19 Jalapeno Wasteland\n\nWorld Seam\n\nShishkebab Cave Blaze bomb 008 Gurglegut Scientists have yet to figure out what gives the gurglegut dragon such intestinal distress. Until they do, don't approach this creature with any open flames. 19 World Seam\n\nShishkebab Cave Blaze bomb 009 Ember jackal This fiery, two-headed jackal gobbles flames for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. For dessert, it indulges on adventurers. If you see one after supper time, RUN! 20 World Seam Cleats 010 Permalava Permalava spews endless torrents of the most vile curse words in the galaxy. Thankfully, its insults fly so fast and so furiously that no one can understand it. 20 World Seam Flip-flops 011 Foul fly This monster is notorious for creepily rubbing its hands together as if it is plotting the galaxy's untimely doom. Which it is. 21 Shishkebab Cave Bang berry 012 Swurly The blustery swurly has a low tolerance for irritation. It blows up at the smallest things--literally. It's best to approach this tempestuous terror with a cool head. 22 Shishkebab Cave Bang berry 013 Mechanibex This odd mechanical beast uses gummy frogs to stoke its belly-furnace. As it burns through them rather quickly, it's always hungry for more. 22 Shishkebab Cave Bang berry 014 Brawliflower Beware the brawliflower: it may look cute and strangely vegetableish, but this garden terror bites back! 23 Capsicum Caverns Sugarstar 015 Pigeonator When this mechanical menace senses a fight, it goes berserk. The effect is somewhat like looking at a boiling kettle of water dancing on the stove top. 24 Capsicum Caverns (Amigo Dungeon) Bang berry 016 Stag lizard The stag lizard's clacking mandibles can pinch through steel like it's butter. Because they can be used in potions, stag-lizard mandibles are highly prized items. 26 Capsicum Caverns Critter horn 017 Charred tree This sad sapling holds a grudge against the cruel world that let it catch fire. Its sooty breath serves as a grim reminder to all who face it: put your campfires out! 28 Carbonara Jungle Sweet meat 018 Rainboar The rainboar's pink pelt may not help it blend into its surroundings, but with that terrible attitude, the rainboar doesn't really have to. 30 Capsicum Caverns (Amigo Dungeon) Orange frog 019 Scorchberry This dangerously tart creature gushes spicy juices when it pops. While this is a terrible defense mechanism, it's a great way to give a smoothie a little kick. 36 Path of Five Organs\n\nPhunnel Pit Green frog 020 Mossworm The mossworm enjoys an exceptionally long life. \"Enjoys\" might be the wrong word, though, given that it doesn't move much and is covered in a thick moss. 37 Path of Five Organs\n\nPhunnel Pit Catdog boots 021 Steamburper The more worked up it gets, the more searing-hot steam belches out of its exhaust pipes. If you see a thick plume of steam, stay away! 38 Capsicum Caverns (Amigo Dungeon) Gold dust 022 Sacrificer This cruel monster sacrifices its own kind to advance its own evil plots. Even the vilest creatures don't want to be associated with this loathsome beast. 48 Cocoabutter Valley Monster meat 023 Firebelcher The firebelcher is a traditional fire-breathing dragon. Fun fact: the firebelcher is a not-too-distant cousin to the lagoon dragon. 49 Chromagar Cave Martial fist 024 Violent joe This curious beast is strangely proud of its magnificent chin. It was all but wiped out in a battle against the punkasaurs over whether chins out-cooled mohawks. 53 Chromagar Cave Red frog 025 Ant noble Despite the name, these ants are not, in fact, royalty. They rely on their money to pay off lackeys who responded to their call in battle. What's noble about that? 61 Glissini Caves Misty studs 026 Crabrador This breed of hermit lab seems to be a shy creature. However, it can show a lot of bravery at almost entirely the wrong times. 75 Glissini Caves Nut spread 027 Jellybeast The gluttonous jellybeast will snack on anything that wanders near its gaping maw. It never brushes its teeth, making its breath just as dangerous as its bite. 89 Glissini Caves Red frog 028 Juniperil The juniperil is a master of the art of caring for diminutive trees. It expertly clips and manicures itself to reach a tiny, zenlike bliss. 3 Magic Academy (Amigo Dungeon) Brass frog 029 Broot These plant monsters are freshest in the spring. Their rich flavor is ideal for stews, but their cute, doelike eyes also make them an ideal garnish! 4 Magic Academy (Amigo Dungeon) Nut spread 030 Mossling This living clot of moss is tough enough to protect itself in the harshest of climates. 6 Tangerine Beach\n\nMandarin Beach\n\nDragon Beach\n\nGreat Dragon Road Rainbow shell 031 Gold Sneakbug Some monsters have no class. This one spends all day rolling around in piles of money. All it takes is one good hit to knock the spare change out of its pockets. 8 Quinoa Plain Gold shoes 032 Spriggan Notable because of its massive, treelike hair, this spooky tree fairy wanders through the forests, challenging anyone whose hair looks better than its own. 8 Carbonara Jungle (Amigo Dungeon) Purple frog 033 Sneakbug Anger this aromatic beast, and it will release a stink unlike anything you have ever known...unless you've ever worn the same socks for more than a week. 9 Quinoa Plain Hiking shoes 034 Cuddlemunk This monster is cute! So cute, in fact, that it is impossible to resist giving it a tickle. Once it has lured you in, the coldhearted predator pounces! 9 Quinoa Plain Baobab sap 035 Floranha This strange fish developed the ability to swim in air after its natural environment dried up. 10 Carbonara Jungle Lucky studs 036 Spiny nut Just a newborn, this spiky little creature deserves every chance to survive in this cruel world. Fortunately, It's tough enough that it doesn't need much help. 11 Carbonara Jungle Baobab sap 037 Crocobusker Some may say it's impossible to rock out with a ukulele, but the crockobusker laughs at its doubters. It rocks the Ukulele like none hath rocked it before. 12 Carbonara Jungle Ukulele 038 Elder beetle The elder beetle wears its magnificent horn as proudly as a jewel-encrusted tiara. Don't call it a cockroach. It's very sensitive about that. 12 Carbonara Jungle Baobab sap 039 Poor thing The poor thing has no money and cannot afford to replace its tattered threads. It uses its bombs to stave off the cold of winter. 12 Carbonara Jungle (Amigo Dungeon) Rusty screw 040 Swinger This angry simian flings gummy frogs faster than anyone around. Those gummy frogs might look soft, but at those speeds, they pack quite a wallop. 13 Carbonara Jungle Frog shirt 041 Goateesaur This monster will dazzle you with its hilarious moves. That is, until you break its horn--then the beast's confidence deflates like a sad balloon. 13 Carbonara Jungle Baobab sap 042 Stabby nut This little monster is wrapped in a nutty, yet strangely delicious, outer shell. It will feebly swat you with a spiky stick, doing little more than annoying you. 14 Carbonara Jungle (Amigo Dungeon) Striped frog 043 Trilobiter The trilobiter is a master of disguise. Sadly, it emits a fruity, citrusy, and yet intensely gut-wrenching stench that completely ruins any attempt at hiding. 15 Carbonara Jungle (Amigo Dungeon) Yellow ooze 044 Bwahahaboon This strange baboon likes nothing more than a good laugh. You could drop a spoon, and it would laugh itself into a coma. It's especially good for one's self-esteem. 15 Carbonara Jungle (Amigo Dungeon) Nut spread 045 Forest eel This obnoxious beast wanders the forest, lecturing others about their scandalous clothes and bad attitudes and how they're too lazy to chase after adventurers. 26 Capsicum Caverns (Amigo Dungeon) Fuchsia frog 046 Woodschrank The woodschrank considers itself the guardian of the forest. It gladly skewers anyone who dares to threaten the sanctity of the grove with sharp wooden lance. 26 Capsicum Caverns (Amigo Dungeon) Lime frog 047 Leafwich It's a leaf. It's a sandwich. It's both! 32 The Holy Tree Green frog 048 Weed devil This garden-variety weed has a terribly bad disposition. No matter how many times you step on it, it keeps coming back for more. And more. And more. 38 Path of Five Organs Grudge ball 049 Scarecrow Having grown bored of its traditional role as guardian of the wheat field, this scarecrow has decided to abandon the farm and see the world. 40 Couscous Ruins Lucky clover 050 Jamari The jamari smells like a meadow of flowers after a rainy day. However, no matter how hectic your life may seem, do not stop to smell the jamaris. 46 Sugarleaf Plains Holy incense 051 Grample Behold its magnificent beard! If beards were a source of profound magical power, this beast would be able to warp the fabric of reality itself. 53 Chromagar Cave Thorn bangle 052 Fallwich It is a very sad sandwich made of very sad, wistful leaves. 67 Glissini Caves Dethorn tail 053 Treehemoth This wrathful stump has been possessed by the spirit of a chopped-down tree. It's more like a tree zombie, and chlorophyll is not what it hungers for. 72 Glissini Caves Misty cap 054 Gnocchalien The gnocchalien thrives in moist, earthy places. This might explain why a sapling has started to grow out of its forehead. Some people call it the \"head gardener.\" 91 Glissini Caves Self circlet 055 Choker What's cuter than a fuzzy, little kitty? A fuzzy, little kitty riding on a big, fluffy cloud! How precious! Unless, of course, it's trying to destroy you. Which it is. 5 Magic Academy (Amigo Dungeon) Lemon jam 056 Skylancer Rider and steed move together with the understated grace of a one-man band. Their combination attacks dazzle and damage anyone close enough to see them. 5 Magic Academy (Amigo Dungeon) Khaki frog 057 Funguroach This filthy insect is covered with a slimy mold. Clean freaks are advised to bolt when the funguroach is around, as it has no conception at all of personal hygiene. 7 Great Dragon Road\n\nTangerine Beach\n\nMandarin Beach\n\nDragon Beach Ice cube 058 Rairbit Much like the increasingly uncommon yeti, the rairbit makes a great pet and seldom attacks people. Unlike the yeti, however, rairbits can be housebroken. 8 Quinoa Plain Sugarstar 059 Anisoptera Nobody knows how this fossilized dragon-fly can remain airborne when its wings--and indeed, its entire body--are made entirely of stone. 9 Quinoa Plain Headband 060 Slashback Don't let the rubber ducky fool you. On its squeaky haunches rides a vicious, cold-blooded monster intent on introducing you to its hatchet. 10 Quinoa Plain Bronze ring 061 Boomeranger The boomeranger's face bears the scar of a tragic boomerang accident. Though it is quite spiteful because of the scar, its dedication to the craft remains admirable. 12 Carbonara Jungle Green frog 062 Airpony The airpony is a hunter, first and foremost, riding high in the sky and looking for prey. This makes it into a valuable soldier. 12 Carbonara Jungle (Amigo Dungeon) Salmon frog 063 Hybrena These two monsters are literally joined at the hip! Like all couples, they often want to pursue individual interests. Too bad for them. That's not happening. 15 Carbonara Jungle (Amigo Dungeon) Choco frog 064 Happiloon This dainty critter catches the wind with its parasol and floats through the air. This pastime can be costly, as it gets a lot of tickets from the Space Police. 25 Capsicum Caverns (Amigo Dungeon) Yellow frog 065 Wanderanger This monster is a master boomerang thrower. It's spent its whole life looking for the one that got away. The boomerang, that is. 36 Ships' Graveyard Green frog 066 Mistral The cloud part of the mistral is made of marshmallow, on which the cat secretly feeds. The adorable kitten on its back is, in fact, a horrible parasitic abomination. 36 Capsicum Caverns (Amigo Dungeon) Thunder bomb 067 Feather vane The feather vane spins in the slightest breeze, leaving it, more often than not, confused and unsure of its surroundings. 39 Couscous Ruins Spinel ring 068 Pandemon The pandemon spent its life dreaming of being a pop star. When its dreams failed, it went into marketing and lost its soul, spreading evil to its target demographic. 39 Couscous Ruins Dark robe 069 Shyclone While the tornado it rides looks quite menacing, it also serves to hide this monster from the world. The poor thing suffers from an incredible shyness. 40 Couscous Ruins Grudge ball 070 Horus This king of the birds adores his subjects, singing songs and, at times kissing them. Sometimes, he eats them. His subjects are justifiably paranoid when he comes by. 40 Couscous Ruins Sparrow wings 071 Manmoo rider The manmoo rider dreams of finding a legendary bronco and breaking it. Until that time, it is content to ride the plains on the back of this unsettling beast. 42 Sugarleaf Plains Blue frog 072 Condemned Also known as the overreactor, this monster is feared by all for its ability to blow things out of proportions. Watch out! It can make a mountain out of a molehill. 49 Cocoabutter Valley Grudge ball 073 Haroeris This strange bird has lips instead of a beak. That alone is disturbing, but to top things off, when it sneezes, it kicks up a terrible and mucousy tornado. 53 Chromagar Cave Heaven boots 074 Clockwork goat Its tail serves as the key to wind up its spring. Because it never truly tires, the clockwork goat makes a good watchgoat. But don't forget to wind it up at night! 61 Glissini Caves Bang berry 075 Gazellebear Although the gazellebear boasts powerful claws that can tear through anything, its hidden shame is that it needs a weekly manicure to keep its claws in good shape. 76 Capsicum Caverns (Amigo Dungeon) Puce frog 076 Short-fuser If the short-fuser gets mad, the tornado it rides swells to mammoth proportions. It's like a cake baking in the oven, except that it's terrifying instead of delicious. 78 Glissini Caves Lemon jam 077 Whimsy bolt This weather vane goes wherever the wind blows, never showing any interest in the things around it. It can't even be relied on to show the wind direction accurately. 82 Glissini Caves Misty boots 078 Balloonfish Ages ago, the first balloonfish swelled up to intimidate an attacking parakeet shark. Its descendants never managed to return to its normal size. 94 Glissini Caves Undizzy tail 079 Dust punisher The dust punisher is on a mission to clean everything in sight, including your clock! 95 Glissini Caves Lemon jam 080 Mud jammer This is a cautionary tale of what can happen when jam goes bad. It loses its sweetness, starts to move, and tries to destroy you. Eat it at your own risk. 1 Forgotten Land\n\nAnt Hole Yellow worm 081 Soldier ant This brave and loyal ant uses its sword to protect itself and its queen. This is all very admirable, but that doesn't mean you should refrain from squishing it. 3 Ant Hole Green frog 082 Magician ant This fierce ant uses magic to serve its queen. Because it knows so much about magic, it is largely immune to magical attacks. 3 Ant Hole Yellow worm 083 Meteorn These creatures thrive on the many meteors that coast through Baklava. This one must have crashed onto Erd recently. It seems surprisingly fragile. 6 Magic Academy (Amigo Dungeon) Brown frog 084 Buffalope On its own, the buffalope is fairly weak. However, when many of them join together, they become very powerful. It's a good idea to stop that from happening. 10 Carbonara Jungle Silver ring 085 Hoody thing The hoody thing's hood protects it against dry skin. When it wants a fresh look, it wears its hood at a rakish tilt. It's not the most fashion forward of monsters. 15 Jalapeno Wasteland\n\nWorld Seam Bang berry 086 Punkasaur Much to the punkasaur's dismay, its glorious mohawk is thinning. It might be time to update its look to something a little more contemporary, like a mullet. 16 Carbonara Jungle (Amigo Dungeon) Taupe frog 087 Cabong This monster has two moods: mad and really mad. It has no patience for softies, so don't let it catch you petting a puppy or anything like that. 19 World Seam Nut spread 088 Eggkeeper Filled with an instinctive need to sit on eggs and a genetic inability to produce them, this creature is a terrible caretaker and wildly irresponsible. 24 Capsicum Caverns Dragon egg 089 Sarcophaghoul It's said that this coffin holds the mysteries of the universe. Or a dead guy. No one's really sure. Or it might be full of money. Only one way to find out! 25 Capsicum Caverns Cashwad cloak 090 Gobbler This monster has a huge mouth, but it's actually quite a picky eater. Just another sign that you can't judge a monster by its gaping maw. 26 Capsicum Caverns (Amigo Dungeon) Magenta frog 091 Unihorn The unihorn loves its horn, and with good reason. By swinging it, it can create strong winds, and by drilling it into the ground, it can shake the earth. 28 Granule Island Platinum ring 092 Monster chest This monster chest may look vicious, but it's actually quite delicate. Handle it with care, or the treasure inside of it will turn to sand. 29 Holy Water Pyramid Rock robe 093 Bagong This monster is created in earthquakes that shake massive rocks loose from the hillsides.
