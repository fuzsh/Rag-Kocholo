        "text": "Great Falls’ art galleries shift into high gear at tonight’s art walk in preparation for Western Art Week.\n\nParis Gibson Square, in conjunction with the art walk, will show 22 films during a tour stop by the Northwest Filmmakers’ Festival.\n\nOther highlights include the Western Clay Roundup at Gallery 16, the unveiling of Deeling Gregory’s “Prairie Passages” at Amazing Gallery and Rachel’s Furniture’s final art walk.\n\nThe Great Falls Historic Trolley will drop off visitors at participating galleries, and many downtown stores will be open late.\n\nBrighten Up Shop\n\n618 Central Ave.\n\nThe Brighten Up Shop welcomes featured artist Steve Lillegard, who will showcase his sculptures and drawings from 6 to 9.\n\nLillegard received formal training at Stanford High School and continued his education at MSU, where he majored in fine art. He won awards in illustration and cartooning while working as the artist for the university paper.\n\nBrian Morger Fine Art Gallery and Studio\n\nNo. 6, 7th St. S.\n\nBrian Morger will demonstrate his techniques on two separate works throughout the evening. One painting is Morger’s second session doing a live portrait of “Mountain Man” Brian Engum. The portrait was started at the January First Friday Art Walk.\n\nThe second painting Morger will work on tonight is a quick draw piece depicting a horse-drawn stage barreling over a snowy mountain pass.\n\nVisitors are welcome to sit by Morger’s fireplace and watch him work.\n\nMorning Light Coffee will provide drinks.\n\nPortal Gallery\n\n318 Central Ave..\n\nFrom 6 to 9, the Portal Gallery showcases a new exhibition from Susan Thomas titled “Passages.”\n\n“Passages” is an installation of looped and tied cane and reed constructions that are suspended and wall mounted, along with a group of tied willow and paper “boats.” Through connections of light and space, materials and color, the installation suggests visual and spiritual passages and journeys, each with a various degree of complexity.\n\nFor more information, contact the gallery at 868-7881.\n\nGallery 16\n\n600 Central Plaza\n\nGallery 16 has corralled the best selection of potters in Great Falls to showcase their work through March.\n\nComplementing the pottery are the watercolors of Carol Spurgeon, who recently completed a series of landscapes titled “The Local West.”\n\nThe opening reception is from 5 to 9.\n\nFor more information, call 453-6103 or visit www.gallery16greatfalls.com.\n\nFour West Art League\n\n1601 2nd Ave. N. (fourth floor of Columbus Center)\n\nThis month’s Four West Art League featured artist is David Powers. Powers came to Great Falls from the East Coast with early beginnings in fiber art, but his specialties are landscapes and nudes.\n\nHe was first an artist-in-residence for the Great Falls school system and decided to make Great Falls his home because of its paint-able countryside.\n\nAmazing Gallery (Inside Amazing Toys)\n\n515 Central Ave.\n\nFrom 5 to 8 p.m., the Amazing Gallery features new paintings in Deeling Gregory’s “Prairie Passages” series. Her ongoing exhibition of more than 20 major works is on display. A portfolio and kiosk of Gregory’s work is available at the gallery.\n\nPieces include “To the Rescue,” a large-scale black-and-white acrylic painting, a companion piece to “Buffalope.” “To the Rescue” is the second in the series of “Prairie Passages” and will be on display for the first time tonight.\n\nMany other paintings also are on display, including “Pink Lotus II” from the Still Waters series and “Buffalope.”\n\nNew selections from Deeling’s Polymer Prairie collection will be on display as well.\n\nA Hooker’s Gallery\n\n925 Central Ave. W.\n\nFrom 6 to 9, A. Hooker’s Gallery features aquatic wood carvings from Tom Maguire and wood turning from Larry Strizich.\n\nCoffee and refreshments will be served.\n\nBelles & Lace Bridal\n\n320 Central Ave.\n\nBelles & Lace Bridal holds a reception tonight for photographer and artist Sara Young.\n\nMarried with four children, Young grew up in Great Falls and studied art in college. As a change of pace, she went to beauty school, but art and photography always had a place in her heart.\n\nTo see examples of her artwork visit http://sarayoungphotography.co.\n\nRachel’s Furniture\n\nRachel’s Furniture holds its last First Friday Art Walk this weekend with a reception from 5 to 8 p.m.\n\nThe featured artist will be Carrie Kohles. She will sell her hand-painted furniture, which will be discounted for the shop’s going-out-of-business sale.\n\nCupcakes will be served.\n\nStudio 706\n\n706 7th Ave. S.\n\nAlana Hastings, Paula Evitts and Sharron Mashburn will be the featured artists at Studio 706 from 6 to 9.\n\nHastings has been around farming and ranching most of her life. She graduated from the University of Great Falls in 2006 with a B.A. in fine arts and has been doing watercolor painting for about 40 years.\n\nHer first watercolor painting was with Ruth Alair. She has studied with many other local artists and has practiced varied techniques and styles. She said she has learned more by sharing her knowledge with the students in the classes she teaches.\n\nHastings’ watercolors and oils are going in a new direction. They are simpler and depict some abstraction around the ranch. The color combinations are livelier and add more life to the landscapes.\n\nEvitts, who is a potter, was born and raised in Iowa. She has taken watercolor and pottery classes in Seattle and continues her creative expression through pottery with Cindy Eve Pottery.\n\nShe has a selection of pottery totems for indoor or outdoor planters and pots with a World Community theme.\n\nMashburn, a longtime educator, works in watercolor, oils and pastels.\n\nColor and composition are her main focus, and she paints from her photos and memory. She grew up in the Las Vegas of yesteryear when road runners and red racer snakes could be seen in patches of desert in the rapidly growing town. She plans to paint more desert scenes.\n\nRefreshments will be served.\n\nFor more information, call 761-8228.\n\nHistoric Great Falls Trolley schedule\n\nLodestone Gallery\n\n, 318 Central Ave. — 6, 6:40, 7:20, 8, 8:40 p.m.\n\nGallery 16, 600 Central Ave\n\n. — 6:03, 6:43, 7:23, 8:03, 8:43 p.m.\n\nParis Gibson Square\n\n, 1400 1st Ave. N. — 6:07, 6:47, 7:27, 8:07, 8:47 p.m.\n\nFour West Art League\n\n, 1601 2nd Ave. N. — 6:12, 6:52, 7:32, 8:12, 8:52 p.m.\n\nStudio 706\n\n, 706 7th Ave S. — 6:20, 7, 7:40, 8:20, 9 p.m.\n\nA.
