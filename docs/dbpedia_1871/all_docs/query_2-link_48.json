        "text": "(a) A type of radioactive decay in which the unstable nucleus emits a helium nucleus. The resulting nuclide has a mass number decreased by 4 and a proton number decreased by 2. An example is:\n\n88226 Ra 86222 Rn + 24 He\n\nThe particles emitted in alpha decay are alpha particles. Streams of alpha particles are alpha rays or alpha radiation. They penetrate a few centimeters of air at STP or a metal foil of mass/area a few milligram/cm2. see also Beta Decay [DC99]\n\n(b) The disintegration of an atomic nucleus, in which the final products are an alpha particle and a nucleus with two fewer protons and two fewer neutrons than the original. [G97]\n\n(c) Spontaneous emission by a heavier element (such as uranium) of positively charged helium nuclei - alpha particles - comprising 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The result of this radioactive decay is that the original element is very gradually converted into another element, with a decreased atomic number and mass. Alpha particle emission may be simultaneous with beta particle decay. [A84]\n\n(a) A unit that measures the wavelength of light and equals 0.00000001 of a centimeter. Blue light has a wavelength of about 4400 angstroms, yellow light 5500 angstroms, and red light 6500 angstroms. [C95]\n\n(b) A unit of length equal to 10-10 meters; symbol Å. Named for Swedish physicist Anders Jonas Angstrom (1814-1874). [McL97]\n\n(c) A unit of length equal to 10-10 m. It is used in atomic and molecular measurements and for the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation in the visible, near infra-red and near ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. The definition of the unit is based on the red emission line of the cadmium spectrum which has an internationally agreed wavelength of 6438.4696 Å in dry air at standard atmospheric pressure at a temperature of 15°C and containing 0.03% carbon dioxide by volume.\n\nThe unit was introduced by the International Union for Solar Research in 1907[19]. It was named after A. J. Ångström (1814-1874), the Scandinavian scientist who used units of 10-10 m to describe wavelengths in his classical map of the Solar spectrum made in 1868. The ångström was not confirmed as a unit of length by the International Congress of Weights and Measures until 1927. For over half a century the ångström was equal to 1.0000002 × 10-10 m but when the metre was defined in terms of the wavelength of krypton in 1960[20] the ångström became equal to 10-10 m exactly. The ångström is sometimes called a tenth metre.\n\nX-ray wavelengths are often given ångström stars (Å*). This unit was devised by J. A. Bearden[21] in 1965 and is based on the wavelength of the K1 line of tungsten which he took to be 0.2090100 Å*, where Å* = 1.00001481 Å = 1.00001481 × 10-10 m. [JM92]\n\n(a) For every variety of particle there exists an antiparticle with opposite properties such as sign of electrical charge. When a particle and its antiparticle meet they can mutually annihilate and produce energy. Thus, antiquark, antiproton, etc. [D89]\n\n(b) Atomic particles that have the same mass as, but opposite charge and orbital direction to, an ordinary particle. Thus, instead of negatively charged electrons, atoms of antimatter have positrons. A quantity of antimatter coming into contact with matter would \"cancel out\" - annihilate, with total conversion of mass to energy - an exact proportion of matter corresponding to the original quantity of antimatter, provided that the elements in the matter also corresponded with the \"elements\" in the antimatter, i.e., that the atoms were equivalent but opposite. [A84]\n\n(c) Matter made of particles with identical mass and spin as those of ordinary matter, but with opposite charge. Antimatter has been produced experimentally, but little of it is found in nature. Why this should be so is one of the questions that must be answered by any adequate theory of the early Universe. [F88]\n\n(a) An elementary particle of opposite charge but otherwise identical to its partner. Most of the observable Universe consists of particles and matter, as opposed to antiparticles and antimatter. [Silk90]\n\n(b) For every known type of particle, there exists an antiparticle with exactly the same mass, but with the opposite electric charge. When a particle and its antiparticle come together, they can always annihilate to form gamma rays. The antiparticle of an electrically neutral particle is sometimes the same as the original particle (e.g., photons) and sometimes it is distinct (e.g., neutrons). [G97]\n\n(c) Particles predicted by combining the theories of special relativity and quantum mechanics. For each particle, there must exist an antiparticle with the opposite charge, magnetic moment and other internal quantum numbers (e.g., lepton number, baryon number, strangeness, charm, etc.), but with the same mass, spin and lifetime. Note that certain neutral particles (such as the photon and 0) are their own antiparticles. [CD99]\n\n(d) A particle of the same mass and spin, but opposite charge (and other properties) to its corresponding particle. For example, a proton and antiproton both have mass 1836 times that of an electron and spin ½ unit, but the charge on the proton is + 1 unit, while that on the antiproton is -1 unit. For unstable particles, such as an isolated neutron, the particle and antiparticle have the same half-life. For uncharged particles the antiparticle is indicated by a bar above the symbol, such as for the antineutron. For charged particles the distinction is indicated by the sign, for example, e+ is the positron, the antiparticle of an electron. Antiparticles of fermions are subject to a conservation law according to which new particles can only be created in particle-antiparticle pairs, while particles can be destroyed only by annihilation with their antiparticles. This rule does not apply to bosons. see also Fermion [DC99]\n\n(e) Every particle has an associated antiparticle, another particle with the same mass but all charges opposite. If a particle has no charges, such as the photon, it is its own antiparticle. Often the antiparticle is denoted by writing a bar over the particle's name; hence, for example, the electron antiparticle (also called the positron) is denoted .\n\n(a) A measure of how bright a star looks in the sky. The brighter the star, the smaller the apparent magnitude. A star that is one magnitude brighter than another (e.g., +1 versus +2) looks 2.5 times brighter. The brightest star of all, of course, is the Sun, whose apparent magnitude is -26.74, followed by Sirius, whose apparent magnitude is -1.46, Canopus (-0.72), Alpha Centauri (-0.27), Arcturus (-0.04), and Vega (+0.03). Stars of the Big Dipper are fainter, most of them around magnitude +2. On a clear, dark night, the unaided eye can see stars as faint as apparent magnitude +6, and the largest telescopes penetrate to apparent magnitude +30. [C95]\n\n(b) Measure of the observed brightness of a celestial object as seen from the Earth. It is a function of the star's intrinsic brightness, its distance from the observer, and the amount of absorption by interstellar matter between the star and the observer. The mv, of Sun, -26.5 mag. A sixth-magnitude star is just barely visible to the naked eye. [H76]\n\n(a) A small rocky body that orbits a star. In the Solar System, most asteroids lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The largest asteroid is Ceres, about 900 kilometers in diameter. [C95]\n\n(b) A small planet-like body of the Solar System, <e> ~ 0.15, <i> ~ 9°.7. More than 1800 have been catalogued, and probably millions of smaller ones exist, but their total mass would probably be less than 3 percent that of the Moon. Their densities are poorly known (about 2.6 g cm-3), but they suggest a composition similar to carbonaceous chondrite. The bright asteroids are presumably original condensations and those fainter than about 14-15 mag are collision fragments. Asteroids and short-period comets have some orbital similarities. Also called minor planet [H76] (c) Also called planetoids or minor planets, the asteroids are tiny planets most of which orbit the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. The largest - and the first discovered - is Ceres, with a diameter of 1,003 km. It is estimated that there may altogether be no fewer than 40,000. A few have very elliptical orbits and cross the orbits of several other (major) planets. One or two even have their own satellites (moons). [A84]\n\n(a) A term used to describe the observed decrease in the intrinsic strength of the color force between quarks as they are brought closer together. At asymptotically small separations, the quarks are virtually free. This is in contrast to the electromagnetic force whose intrinsic strength increases as two charged particles approach each other. [CD99]\n\n(b) A force of interaction between particles is said to be asymptotically free if it becomes weaker as the energy of the interacting particles increases. Empirically the force between-quarks in a proton or neutron is found to be asymptotically free, a feature that can be explained by assuming that the force is described by a Yang-Mills theory. [G97]\n\n(c) In general, there are strong, QCD forces between quarks due to the exchange of gluons. Asymptotic freedom is the principle which says that these forces become weaker for very close encounters between quarks, so that the quarks become `free' of the forces at very short distances. In high-energy collisions, the quarks do sometimes become very close and, since they then behave almost like free particles, it is not too difficult to calculate their motion during the close collision. [D89]\n\n(a) The smallest component of matter that retains its chemical properties. An atom consists of a nucleus and at least one electron. [HH98]\n\n(b) The building block of matter. The nucleus of an atom consists of one or more protons and may contain neutrons as well; any electrons surround the nucleus. The number of protons in the atom - the atomic number - determines the element. [C95]\n\n(c) The smallest part of an element that can take part in a chemical reaction. Atoms consist of a small dense positively charged nucleus, made up of neutrons and protons, with electrons in a cloud around this nucleus. The chemical reactions of an element are determined by the number of electrons (which is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus). All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons (the proton number). A given element may have two or more isotopes, which differ in the number of neutrons in the nucleus.\n\nThe electrons surrounding the nucleus are grouped into shells - i.e. main orbits around the nucleus. Within these main orbits there may be sub-shells. These correspond to atomic orbitals. An electron in an atom is specified by four quantum numbers:\n\n1. The principal quantum number (n) can have values 1, 2, etc. The corresponding shells are denoted by letters K, L, M, etc., the K shell (n = 1) being the nearest to the nucleus. The maximum number of electrons in a given shell is 2n2. This quantum number has the largest effect on the energies of the states; high values of n correspond to weakly bound (higher energy) electrons.\n\n2. The orbital quantum number (l), which specifies the angular momentum. For a given value of n, l can have possible values of n-1, n-2,... 2, 1, 0. For instance, the M shell (n = 3) has three sub-shells with different values of l (0, 1, and 2). Sub-shells with angular momentum, 0, 1, 2, and 3 are designated by letters s, p, d, and f. This quantum number has the second largest effect on the energies; higher values of l give moderately higher energy electrons.\n\n3. The magnetic quantum number (m). This can have values -l, -(l - 1) ... 0 ... +(l + 1), + l. It determines the orientation of the electron orbital in a magnetic field. States with the same values of n and l but different values of m have the same energy in the absence of a magnetic field, but differ slightly when a field is applied.\n\n4. The spin quantum number (ms), which specifies the intrinsic angular momentum of the electron. It can have values +½ and -½. Quantum states in which the spin is parallel to the orbital angular momentum are at slightly higher energy than ones in which it is antiparallel. This results, for example, in the fact that the yellow light from a sodium lamp has two very close lines in its spectrum.\n\nEach electron in the atom has four quantum numbers and, according to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers. This explains the electronic structure of atoms. [DC99]\n\n(c) An atom has a nucleus surrounded by electrons bound together by the electromagnetic force. Ninety-two different atoms occur naturally, making ninety-two different chemical elements, with nuclei having one to ninety-two protons. The atoms are electrically neutral. The diameter of an atom is about 10,000 times larger than the diameter of its nucleus. [K98]\n\n(a) A unit of mass used for atoms and molecules, equal to 1/12 of the mass of an atom of carbon-12. It is equal to 1.660 33 × 10-27 kg. [DC99]\n\n(b) In the notation of physics, adopted by international agreement in 1961, one-twelfth the mean mass of an atom of 126 (including the orbital electrons). Because of the mass defect, the amu is slightly less than the mass of a hydrogen atom, so one H atom has 1.007825 amu. 1 amu = 1.66 × 10-24 g. The energy equivalent of 1 amu is 931 MeV. [H76]\n\n(c) The masses of atoms and molecules are generally given in atomic mass units. These units are based on a scale in which the mass of the carbon isotope 126C is taken to be 12. This makes one atomic mass unit equivalent to 1.6605402 × 10-27 kg. The unit is sometimes called a dalton. Atomic masses were originally given as atomic weights on a scale where the mass of the hydrogen atom was unity. In 1885 Ostwald suggested if atomic weights were expressed on a scale in which the mass of oxygen was 16, more of the elements would have integral numbers for their atomic weights. The discovery of oxygen isotopes led to the adoption of two atomic weight scales[27]. The one used by chemists was based on the figure 16 representing the average mass of the oxygen atom in its natural state (16O:18O:17O in the abundance 506:1:0.204), whereas that used by the physicists considered the oxygen isotope 16O as the basic unit on their scale. The ratio of atomic mass on the physical scale to atomic mass on the oxygen chemical scale[28] was 1.000272±0.00005.\n\nIn 1960[29] the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics followed the proposal made a year earlier by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry that all atomic weights should be based on the 126C scale. This enabled more isotopes to have integral mass numbers than would have been possible on the oxygen scale. This reduced the values given on the previous chemical scale by a factor of 1.000043 and changed the values of the Faraday and Avogadro's constant by a similar amount. Values on the physical scale can be converted to the new scale by multiplying by 0.999685. [JM92]"
