The incompatibility can be pinned down to the radial gradient of the NFW potential in the very center of the system, which differs from zero. The gradient is\n\nSánchez Almeida, Jorge\n\nCitations\n\n0\n\nThe Aligned Orbit of a Hot Jupiter around the M Dwarf TOI-4201\n\nMeasuring the obliquities of stars hosting giant planets may shed light on the dynamical history of planetary systems. Significant efforts have been made to measure the obliquities of FGK stars with hot Jupiters, mainly based on observations of the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect. In contrast, M dwarfs with hot Jupiters have hardly been explored because\n\nGan, Tianjun et al."
