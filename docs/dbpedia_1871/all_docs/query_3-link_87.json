I was wondering if it would be right to say that if the two angles from the star were added up and divided by 2 that would be equivalent to if the star were equidistant from both positions of Earth. So that's not the case, can I know why my assumption was wrong? Cheers\n\nNatFex said:\n\nI was wondering if it would be right to say that if the two angles from the star were added up and divided by 2 that would be equivalent to if the star were equidistant from both positions of Earth.

Cheers\n\nWhat's wrong with your drawing is that we choose the times during the year that maximize the parallax, which is when the line between the two Earths is perpendicular to the line from the sun to the star. So the point halfway between the two Earths is at the position of the sun.\n\nnewjerseyrunner said:\n\nIt's not very useful, it's useful for only a handful of the nearest stars.\n\nThis was true in the past, but no longer. The Hipparcos satellite measured accurate parallaxes to over 100,000 stars, and the Gaia satellite is currently in the process of measuring parallaxes to over 1 billion stars. The accuracy goal for Gaia is 20 microacrseconds, so it will be able to measure the parallax of an object up to 10's of thousands of parsecs away, which is most of the galaxy.\n\nphyzguy said:\n\nWhat's wrong with your drawing is that we choose the times during the year that maximize the parallax, which is when the line between the two Earths is perpendicular to the line from the sun to the star. So the point halfway between the two Earths is at the position of the sun.\n\nPardon my asking but I have a few more questions\n\nIf we choose specific times of the year to maximise parallax, how is that done if we don't know how far away the star is?\n\nAlso if that's the case then the two angles measured at the opposite ends of Earth's orbit are going to be the same. Why measure both angles when you could just measure one, if you know that the angle is going to be the same on the other end? Is it to average them and reduce error?\n\nMaybe it helps to look at the actual data taken by the Hipparcos satellite. Does this answer your questions? The reason the curves look different depends on where the star is in the sky. If the star is in a location perpendicular to the Earth's orbit, then the path will be a circle (superimposed on the proper motion). If the star is in the plane of the Earth's orbit, then it will be a highly flattened ellipse, basically a straight line(superimposed on the proper motion).\n\nnewjerseyrunner said:\n\nI didn't know we had anywhere near the sensitivity we had for that. I wonder how far out in the solar system we'd have to send a telescope to detect parallax of distant galaxies.\n\nWith the accuracy of the Gaia satellite, to measure a parallax out as far as the Andromeda galaxy( ~2.5 million ly), you would need need to orbit some 15.5 times further from the Sun than the Earth. (somewhere between Saturn's and Uranus' orbits.)\n\nnewjerseyrunner said:\n\nInteresting... doable, but not practical right now.\n\nAnd Andromeda is the closest of the major galaxies. To measure the parallax for Sextans B, which is just on the edge of our own local group, you would have to have a base nearly equal to the diameter of Neptune's orbit, and you still haven't gone further than the local group of galaxies.\n\nFor Centaurus A, some 13 mly distant, you'd have to move out to twice the distance of Pluto and where the orbital period would be ~701 years. Not only would this make for a long wait between measurements, but is also likely that during that time more sensitive equipment will be developed that could do the same measurement with a much smaller base.\n\nJanus said:\n\nAnd Andromeda is the closest of the major galaxies.

There is no reason that they have to come from the same telescope. It's still wildly impractical, but not for the reasons stated here.\n\nnewjerseyrunner said:\n\nUh, you seem to have forgotten something major: you don't need to wait for it to do an orbit, you just need two readings. There is no reason that they have to come from the same telescope. It's still wildly impractical, but not for the reasons stated here.\n\nSure, if the object you are measuring the parallax for is properly aligned with the two telescopes at the moment of the measurement. But what about other objects? Remember, to maximize the parallax measurement, the direction of the object needs to be at a right angle to the line joining the telescopes. This limits the maximum parallax measurement to four directions for any particular alignment of the telescopes. To measure objects in other directions you need to wait for the whole system to rotate. And with a period of 701 years, even a ten degree shift would take almost 20 years. A full sky survey of all objects in range would take 175+ yrs.\n\nHipparcos measured parallaxes with errors of 2000 μas.\n\nGaia is supposed to measure parallaxes with errors of 7 μas.\n\n300 times more exact.\n\nHow?\n\nBy having a bigger mirror and less diffraction from aperture?\n\nHipparcos has a 29 cm telescope. Gaia should then have a 80 m aperture.\n\nDoes not look like this. Actually, the aperture of Gaia is quoted as just 145 cm. Mere 5 times the size of Hipparcos.\n\nHow does Gaia achieve that precision?\n\nCould you have a telescope which is many times more precise than Gaia again, without being many times bigger?\n\nNatFex said:\n\nPardon my asking but I have a few more questions\n\nIf we choose specific times of the year to maximise parallax, how is that done if we don't know how far away the star is?\n\nAlso if that's the case then the two angles measured at the opposite ends of Earth's orbit are going to be the same. Why measure both angles when you could just measure one, if you know that the angle is going to be the same on the other end? Is it to average them and reduce error?\n\nYou need the maximum separation between your observation points. Its like having a wider distance between your eyes(our eyes have evolved for an optimum distance for our environment.) Then you can use the \"skinny triangle\" approximation for most cases. Wikipedia has an article on skinny triangles. ALL observations of stars involve skinny triangles. I know, I know, for optimum results don't approximate. The you might get the distance as 10.01 pc as opposed to 10 pc.\n\nThe accuracy of GAIA vs HIPPSRCOS is not just a matter of instrumentation. As noted in this paper; http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2064, From Hipparcos to Gaia: \"Compared to Hipparcos, it [GAIA] will bring a gain of a factor 50 to 100 in position accuracy... During its 5-year flight, Gaia will measure objects repeatedly, up to a few hundred times. ...The length of the [HIPPARCOS] mission was 3.3 years, during which a mean of 110 measurements per object were collected\". The number of measurements per object plays a big role in limiting positional uncertainty.\n\nJanus said:\n\nWith the accuracy of the Gaia satellite, to measure a parallax out as far as the Andromeda galaxy( ~2.5 million ly), you would need need to orbit some 15.5 times further from the Sun than the Earth. (somewhere between Saturn's and Uranus' orbits.)\n\nThe parallax would be 20 microseconds, but 20+-20 is hardly a useful result. Also, Gaia needs ~70 observations of stars of magnitude ~15 or brighter to achieve this resolution, and no star in the Andromeda galaxy is that bright sufficiently long.\n\n@snorkack: To measure parallax, you only need the central position of the diffraction pattern, you are not limited by diffraction. Gaia's optics is a bit \"misaligned\" on purpose to smear the starlight out a bit - this spreads it more evenly over the sensors, and helps fitting the central position with higher accurary. Gaia has no way to (optically) separate a binary star at 20 µas, that would indeed need a much larger telescope.\n\n@phyzguy: the second observation window is necessary to get the absolute positions right. Parallax relative to nearby background sources wouldn't need it. But with that second point of view, you can measure things that are 60 degrees apart. Do this in multiple different directions and you can produce an all-sky map (which is a complicated problem mathematically, but it is solvable).Gaia is the first telescope where the variable distance between Earth and stars becomes relevant for parallax measurements. It is not sensitive enough to see parallax changing over time, but to improve the measurement stellar radial motion over the observation perid and radial motion of Earth should be taken into account as a small correction.\n\nmfb said:\n\n@snorkack: To measure parallax, you only need the central position of the diffraction pattern, you are not limited by diffraction.

It follows that even if you have a big Airy disc, you can analyze the precise distribution of light in the Airy disc, and detect small deviations from the point spread function, caused by other light sources well inside the Airy disc.\n\nNatFex said:\n\nPardon my asking but I have a few more questions\n\nIf we choose specific times of the year to maximise parallax, how is that done if we don't know how far away the star is?\n\nBecause, the distance can be derived alone by another method measuring spectroscopic parallax, which should not be mistaken for stellar (geometric) parallax or grouped in together as it often is...\n\nOne can only hope that Gaia has an entire committee devoted to establishing and maintaining good terminology. Hope that helps!"
