I've searched NED, ADS and the web without success.\n\nMike\n\nRegards,\n\nMike\n\nBrian Skiff\n\nThe RC1 notes (given in NED) cite only Zwicky's 1957 monograph,\n\n\"Morphological Astronomy\", which I presume is the source of the\n\ndiscovery.\n\nThe on-line bibliographic databases aren't complete before\n\nabout 1980, so will often not give you a ready link to information\n\nlike this.\n\n&#92;Brian\n\nSteinicke-Streifeneder@t-online.de\n\nHello Michael,\n\nMK> Does anyone know who discovered the dwarf irregular galaxy Sextans B (= DDO\n\nMK> 75, UGC 5373)? I've searched NED, ADS and the web without success.\n\nSextans B was discovered around 1952 by Albert G. Wilson at Palomar.\n\nHe was also the discoverer of some other interesting dwarfs (found during\n\nthe making of the POSS), e.g. Sextans C, Draco dwarf, and (with\n\nHarrington) Leo I + II.\n\nInformations about \"Al\" Wilson can be found here:\n\nwww.lowell.edu/Research/library/paper/al_wilson.html\n\nCheers,\n\nWolfgang\n\nMichael Kerr\n\nBrian and Wolfgang,\n\nThanks for the leads on the discoverer of Sextans B (= DDO 70, UGC 5373).\n\nI followed up your suggestions at the AAO library and can confirm that the\n\nfirst documented report of Sextans B appears to be in F. Zwicky's 1957 book\n\n\"Morphological Astronomy\". Zwicky includes Sextans B in a table of dwarf\n\ngalaxies discovered with the 48-inch Schmidt telescope (Table XLVIII, p.\n\n225) and a footnote to the table says that \"A. G. Wilson who discovered\n\nmost of them...\" Wilson himself doesn't seem to have published anything on\n\nthe discovery. He left Palomar-Mt Wilson in 1953 so Wolfgang's date of\n\n\"around 1952\" seems reasonable.\n\nI am a bit surprised that Wilson's 1955 paper \"Sculptor-Type Systems in the\n\nLocal Group of Galaxies\" (1955PASP...67...27W), which lists the known\n\nSculptor-type galaxies, doesn't include Sextans A (discovered by Zwicky\n\naround 1939/40, = DDO 75, MCG -01-26-030) or Sextans B. This paper also\n\nreports Wilson's discovery of the Sextans globular cluster (Sextans C,\n\nPalomar 3), which he notes was independently discovered by Walter Baade.\n\nMike\n\nSteinicke-Streifeneder@t-online.de\n\nHello Michael,\n\nMK> Wilson himself doesn't seem to have published anything on\n\nMK> the discovery.\n\nMaybe it is published in the yearbook of the Palomar Observaory for\n\n1952/53. The first note (\"Wilson's dwarf in Sextans\") can be found in\n\nthe table of E. Petitt's paper ApJ 120, 413 (1954).\n\nWilson found many \"Palomar globulars\" (some are rediscoveries) on\n\nSchmidt-plates. He must be credited for Pal 2 (1950) and Pal 3 (1952,\n\ntogether with Baade), the \"10h cluster\" in Sextans. Maybe this was the\n\ntime of the Sextans B discovery. Further Pal 10 + 11 (1955) and Pal 13\n\n(1953). He rediscovered Hubbles \"11h cluster\" (Pal 4) on a\n\nSchmidt-Platte of 1950, also Baades's Pal 5 in 1955. Wilson also found\n\n26 peculiar galaxies, included in Arp's Atlas.\n\nWolfgang\n\nMichael Kerr\n\nHi Wolfgang,\n\nMaybe it is published in the yearbook of the Palomar Observaory for\n\n1952/53. The first note (\"Wilson's dwarf in Sextans\") can be found in\n\nthe table of E. Petitt's paper ApJ 120, 413 (1954).\n\nThanks for pointing out the Pettit paper. I'm impressed that you picked up\n\nthe reference to the \"Wilson Dwarf Irr\" in the table. Based on this there\n\nseems little doubt that Wilson discovered Sextans B. I checked the \"Annual\n\nReport of the Director of the Mount Wilson Observatory\" for the years 1950\n\nto 1958 when I was at the library today but couldn't find any mention of\n\nthe discovery.\n\nMike"
