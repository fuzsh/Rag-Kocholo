        "text": "\"Planning large astronomical missions is a long process. In some cases, such as the now functional James Webb Space Telescope, it can literally take decades. Part of that learning process is understanding what the mission will be designed to look for. Coming up with a list of what it should look for is a process, and on larger missions, teams of scientists work together to determine what they think will be best for the mission. In that vein, a team of researchers from UC Berkeley and UC Riverside have released a paper on the arXiv preprint server describing a database of exoplanets that could be worth the time of NASA's new planned habitable planet survey, the Habitable Worlds Observatory HWO. Astronomy's decadal surveys are the starting point for many ambitious projects, and the Astro2020 Decadal Survey didn't disappoint. It called for NASA to develop a 6-meter space telescope capable of high-contrast observations in optical, infrared, and ultraviolet wavelengths. That project became known as the HWO; its primary mission is to observe 25 different exoplanets in their parent star's habitable zones and look for biosignatures on them. Essentially, it will be humanity's best alien finder. While not searching biosignatures, it can also do general astronomy, but knowing what planets to look at is critical to its mission. To tackle that part of the project, a NASA project known as the Exoplanet Exploration Program developed a list of 164 candidate exoplanets \"whose [hypothetical] exo-Earths would be the most accessible\" for the HWO. Mainly, that accessibility had to do with the characteristics of the planet's parent star, but its separation from that star was also considered.\"...

This gas giant had previously only been a \"planet candidate\" seen by NASA's TESS mission, but thanks to citizen scientists, it is now an official planet. Thank you Astronomy magazine for this fantastic article! https://buff.ly/3XwOtgf \"While the method relies on pure chance, TESS observes so many stars all across the sky that it has so far amassed over 7,000 candidate worlds. But because TESS is so busy trying to detect as many planets as possible, almost all of these detections rely on a single transit event: just one pass of the exoplanet in front of its star. The task of confirming the existence of the exoplanet is left to follow-up surveys with ground-based observatories, which is a tedious, difficult, and time-consuming job. This is where citizen scientists come to the rescue. Using a network of telescopes scattered across the globe, amateur astronomers can perform the necessary observations needed to turn a candidate exoplanet into a confirmed one. Recently, the Unistellar Network and Exoplanet Watch has confirmed a new exoplanet, TIC 393818343 b, which sits about 300 light-years away from Earth.\"\n\nNew Planetary-mass Object Found in Quadruple System | ESO FriendsofNASA.org | View full-size image: https://lnkd.in/gxD_Gf2F The image has a yellow/orange tone, with three small circular features. Each of the features has ripples surrounding it, like stones dropped in a pond. At the center is the largest, brightest spot. This is the central star (A), and just above it is a smaller spot, the companion object B. In the bottom left quadrant of the image are the second star (C), and its newly discovered companion (Cb). Two closeup insets show Cb in more detail. This image shows the unique stellar system HIP 81208, as captured by the European Southern Observatory‚Äôs Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. Astronomers thought HIP 81208 was a system consisting of a massive central star (A, the central bright spot), a brown dwarf (B) circling around it, and a low-mass star (C) orbiting further away. However, a new study has revealed a never-before-seen hidden gem: an object (Cb), approximately 15 times more massive than Jupiter, orbiting around the smaller of the two stars (C). Distance: ~480 light years The discovery of Cb means that HIP 81208 is a uniquely intriguing system with two stars and two smaller bodies orbiting each one‚Äì‚Äìin other words, a hierarchical quadruple system. The mass of the newly found Cb object places it right at the border between planets and brown dwarfs‚Äì‚Äìfailed stars that are not massive and hot enough to fuse hydrogen into helium. The hidden giant Cb was spotted when a team of astronomers, led by A. Chomez of the Paris Observatory, re-analysed archival data from the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE) instrument installed on the VLT. While many other instruments use indirect methods to hunt for far-flung worlds, SPHERE uses a technique known as direct imaging: what we see here is an actual image of the system. Indeed, this is the first hierarchical quadruple system to be found using direct imaging, which will prove invaluable to understanding how complex systems like this one form and evolve.

It is a lenticular galaxy, meaning that it falls somewhere between an elliptical and a spiral galaxy. It lies about 73 million light-years from Earth in the minor equatorial constellation Sextans. Sextans is a small constellation that belongs to the Hercules family of constellations. It is a constellation with an astronomical theme, being named for the instrument known as the sextant. Sextants are often thought of as navigational instruments that were invented in the 18th century by Europeans. However, the sextant as an astronomical tool has been around for much longer. Islamic scholars developed astronomical sextants many hundreds of years earlier in order to measure angles in the sky. A particularly striking example is the enormous sextant with a radius of 36 meters that was developed by Ulugh Beg of the Timurid dynasty in the fifteenth century, located in Samarkand in present-day Uzbekistan. These early sextants may have been a development of the quadrant, a measuring device proposed by Ptolemy. A sextant, as the name suggests, is shaped like one-sixth of a circle, approximately the shape of the constellation. Sextants are no longer in use in modern astronomy, having been replaced by instruments that are capable of measuring the positions of stars and astronomical objects much more accurately and precisely. NGC 3156 has been studied in many ways other than determining its precise position‚Äîfrom its cohort of globular clusters, to its relatively recent star formation, to the stars that are being destroyed by the supermassive black hole at its center. Image Description: A large elliptical galaxy. It appears to be formed of faint, grey, concentric ovals that grow progressively brighter towards the core, where there is a very bright point, and fade away at the edge. Two threads of dark red dust cross the galaxy‚Äôs disc, near the center. The background is black and mostly empty, with only a few point stars and small galaxies.

These stations are typically equipped with advanced telescopes, detectors, and instruments that allow astronomers to study various aspects of the universe, such as stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae, and other cosmic phenomena. Observatory stations are often situated in remote locations with minimal light pollution to maximize the clarity of observations. They can be found atop mountains, in deserts, or even in space aboard orbiting satellites. Some observatories specialize in specific areas of research, like solar observatories that focus on the sun or radio observatories that detect radio waves emitted by celestial objects. These stations play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the cosmos. They contribute to scientific research, discovery of new celestial objects, exploration of exoplanets, understanding the origins of the universe, and studying various astronomical phenomena. Additionally, observatories often engage in public outreach and education, allowing visitors to learn about astronomy and experience the wonders of the universe firsthand through guided tours, workshops, and stargazing events.

Surveying the nearby bright stars, and taking into account inputs from the LUVOIR and HabEx mission studies (but without being overly prescriptive in the required starlight suppression technology or requirements), we compile a list of 164 stars whose exo-Earths would be the most accessible for a systematic imaging survey of habitable zones with a 6-m-class space telescope in terms of angular separation, planet brightness in reflected light, and planet-star brightness ratio. We compile this star list to motivate observations and analysis to help inform observatory design (mission-enabling \"precursor science\") and enhance the science return of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) survey for exo-Earths (mission-enhancing \"preparatory science\"). It is anticipated that this list of target stars and their prop... Continued on ES/IODE ‚û°Ô∏è https://etcse.fr/nK ------- If you find this interesting, feel free to follow, comment and share.

Soon, the pressure and heat of that hydrogen will cause a thermonuclear explosion. If you're looking into the night sky around August and September, you will see a pre-eruption dip in light emitted by T CrB. But if you miss any of this, \"NASA and the global astronomical community plan to leave no stone unturned when T CrB...appears to the naked eye...\" The network includes such community members as the James Webb Space Telescope and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array, in New Mexico (I vote this one is the best named of all of the network list). \"Recurrent novae are unpredictable and contrarian. When you think there can‚Äôt possibly be a reason they follow a certain set pattern, they do‚Äîand as soon as you start to rely on them repeating the same pattern, they deviate from it completely.

An international team of astronomers reports the discovery of a new exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star. The newfound alien world, designated TOI-1135 b is young, hot and comparable in size to Saturn. To date, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has identified nearly 7,100 candidate exoplanets (TESS Objects of Interest, or TOI), of which 420 have been confirmed so far. Since its launch in April 2018, TESS, with its array of wide-field cameras, is conducting a survey of about 200,000 of the brightest stars near the sun with the aim of searching for transiting exoplanets, including giant extrasolar worlds. A group of astronomers led by Manuel Mallorqu√≠n D√≠az of the University of La Laguna, Spain, has now confirmed another TOI monitored by TESS. They identified a transit signal in the light curve of TOI-1135 (also known as HIP 62908 or TIC 154872375)‚Äîa young solar-type star of spectral type G0 at a distance of some 371 light years. The planetary nature of this signal was confirmed by follow-up photometry and spectroscopy. \"This paper introduces the discovery and mass characterization of a close giant gas planet orbiting the young solar-type star TOI-1135,\" the researchers wrote. TOI-1135 b has a radius of about 0.8 Jupiter radii and its mass is approximately 0.062 Jupiter masses, which yields a density at a level of 0.16 g/cm3. The planet orbits its host every 8.02 days, at a distance of 0.082 AU from it. The equilibrium temperature of TOI-1135 b is estimated to be around 950‚Äì1,200 K. Therefore, the obtained results indicate that TOI-1135 b is an inflated exoplanet, similar in size to Saturn, however less massive than the solar system's two biggest gaseous giants. The planet has an extended atmosphere, most probably due to strong stellar radiation. The astronomers assume that TOI-1135 b may be in the process of losing its atmosphere by photoevaporation. They noted that the planet has a high mass-loss rate of about 39 Earth masses per one billion years, so it will eventually lose most of its atmosphere in a few hundred million years. \"Giant planets with masses less than Saturn are susceptible to losing all or most of their atmosphere in their early stages if they receive enough radiation from a host star, which might be the case of TOI-1135 b,\" The parent star, TOI-1135, is slightly larger and more massive than the sun, while its luminosity is at a level of 1.7 solar luminosities. The star is estimated to be between 125 million and 1 billion years old, and its effective temperature is approximately 6,122 K. #exoplanet #TOI-1135b #tess #astronomers #radiation #stars #equilibrium"
