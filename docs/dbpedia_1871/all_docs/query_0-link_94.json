There is no myth about this constellation, but there is a story related to it. It was discovered by Johannes Hevelius, who was a Polish Astronomer in 1687. It was original named Sextans Uraniae after the instrument of the Johannes. This instrument was used to measure the position of the star until it was destroyed in a fire at Johannes’s observatory in the year of 1679.\n\nOrigin of Sextans\n\nThe sextant word arises from the Indo-European root, that is, six. It has different derivatives in different languages. The original name, Sextans Uraniae was developed with Urania, which was the muse of the astronomy in mind.\n\nSextans: Features to know\n\nAs a constellation, it covers a slightly dim and sparse area of the sky.

Moreover, it also has been declared that it has a few noteworthy variable stars that include Beta, 23, 25 Sextantis and also LHS 292. There is a notable deep-sky object in this constellation named NGC 3115, which is an edge-on lenticular galaxy.

When it comes to Sextans B, it is one of the smallest irregular galaxies that are known to have planetary nebulas.\n\nThe constellation can be observed at latitudes between +80 degree and –90 degrees. If we talk about the neighboring constellations, they are Crater, Leo, and Hydra. It does not have any stars that are brighter than magnitude 3. Additionally, it has five stars that are situated within 10 parsecs of the Earth.\n\nSextans family"
