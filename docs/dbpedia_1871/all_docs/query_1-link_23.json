        "text": "The Sextans Constellation does not have any stars brighter than magnitude 3.00, with its brightest star being Alpha Sextantis, with an apparent magnitude of 4.49. It contains five stars located within 10 parsecs (32.6 light years) of Earth and the nearest star is the red dwarf LHS 292, positioned only 14.8 light years from Earth.\n\nSextans is home to five stars with confirmed exoplanets — HD 86081, HIP 49067, WASP-43, 24 Sextantis and HD 92788 — and one formally named star. The formally named star is HD 86081 and its name, as approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), is Bibhā.\n\nThere are no Messier objects in Sextans and only one daytime meteor shower associated with the constellation — the Sextantids. It occurs in late October and early November.\n\nHistory and Mythology of the Sextans Constellation\n\nJohannes Hevelius created the constellation of Sextans in the 17th century and originally named it Sextans Uraniae after the instrument he had used to measure star positions, until it was destroyed in a fire at his observatory in 1679. While telescopes were available to him, Hevelius preferred to use the sextant for naked-eye sightings.\n\nSextans constellation is not associated with any myths.\n\nLocation of the Sextans Constellation\n\nSextans is the 47th largest constellation and occupies an area of 314 square degrees. It is located in the second quadrant of the southern hemisphere (SQ2) and can be seen at latitudes between +80° and -90°.\n\nIts right ascension is 10h and its declination is 0°. It is best seen at 9pm, during the month of April. It lies near the ecliptic, which causes the Moon and some of the planets to occasionally pass through it for brief periods of time.\n\nSextans’ neighboring constellations are Crater, Hydra and Leo and it belongs to the Hercules family of constellations, along with Aquila, Ara, Centaurus, Corona Australis, Corvus, Crater, Crux, Cygnus, Hercules, Hydra, Lupus, Lyra, Ophiuchus, Sagitta, Scutum, Serpens, Triangulum Australe and Vulpecula.\n\nNotable Stars\n\nAlpha Sextantis\n\nAlpha Sextantis is the brightest star in Sextans and has an apparent magnitude of 4.48. It is a white giant star with the stellar classification A0III and is located around 287 light years away from Earth. It is also informally considered to be an “equator star”, as it is currently located less than a quarter of a degree south of the celestial equator. Alpha Sextantis was 7 arc minutes north of the equator in 1900, but crossed over to the southern hemisphere in December 1923.\n\nAlpha Sextantis has a mass that is three times that of the Sun and is 122 times more luminous. It is also thought to be around 300 million years old.\n\nBeta Sextantis\n\nBeta Sextantis is a blue-white main sequence dwarf with the stellar classification B6V.

It orbits the star with a period of 325.81 days.\n\nHD 86081\n\nHD 86081 is a yellow-white main sequence dwarf star with the stellar classification of F8V and a visual magnitude of 8.74. It has a luminosity 1.75 times that of the Sun and is located 297 light years away from Earth. A planet orbits the star every 2.1375 days. This planet has a mass 1.50 times that of Jupiter.\n\nBD-08°2823\n\nBD-08°2823 is a an orange main sequence dwarf with the stellar classification of K3V and an apparent magnitude of 9.86. It is smaller, less massive and cooler than the Sun and is located around 137 light years away from Earth. In 2009, two gas giants were discovered orbiting the star; the outer one orbits the star every 237.6 days, while the inner orbits every 5.60 days.\n\nWASP-43\n\nWASP-43 is an orange dwarf with the stellar classification of K7V and an apparent magnitude of 12.4. It has a mass that is half that of the Sun and a radius that is 0.598 times that of the Sun.\n\nIn April 2011, a planet, a Hot Jupiter named WASP-43b, was discovered orbiting the star. At the time, it was the most closely orbiting Hot Jupiter discovered. It completes an orbit around the star every 0.813475 days and has a mass 1.78 times that of Jupiter and a radius 0.93 times that of Jupiter.\n\nDeep Sky Objects\n\nSpindle Galaxy\n\nThe Spindle Galaxy, also known as NGC 3115 or Caldwell 53, is a lenticular galaxy which appears almost exactly edge-on.
