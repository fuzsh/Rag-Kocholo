Sextans B is 4.44 million light-years away from Earth and thus is one of the most distant members of the Local Group, if it is indeed a member. It forms a pair with its neighbouring galaxy Sextans A. It is a type Ir IVâ€“V galaxy according to the galaxy morphological classification scheme. Sextans B may also be gravitationally associated with the galaxies NGC 3109 and the Antlia Dwarf.\n\nBio[]\n\nAs usual, him and his sister have a brother-sister rivalry. But Sextans A still protects him. Also he has interest in getting more stars. But actually both of them are related to the Magellanic Clouds And NGC 4449. He does the job of existing.\n\nHe can be a goofball too.\n\nInfo[]"
