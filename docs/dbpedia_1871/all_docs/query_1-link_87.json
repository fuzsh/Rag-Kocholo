        "text": "Notable features\n\nSextans as a constellation covers a rather dim, sparse region of the sky. It has only one star above the fifth magnitude, namely α Sextantis at 4.49m. The constellation contains a few double stars, including γ, 35, and 40 Sextantis. There are a few notable variable stars, including β, 25, 23 Sextantis, and LHS 292. NGC 3115, an edge-on lenticular galaxy, is the only noteworthy deep-sky object. It also lies near the ecliptic, which causes the Moon, and some of the planets to occasionally pass through it for brief periods of time.\n\nThe constellation is the location of the field studied by the COSMOS project, undertaken by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nSextans B is a fairly bright dwarf irregular galaxy at magnitude 6.6, 4.3 million light-years from Earth. It is part of the Local Group of galaxies.\n\nCL J1001+0220 is as of 2016 the most distant known galaxy cluster at redshift z=2.506, 11.1 billion light-years from Earth."
