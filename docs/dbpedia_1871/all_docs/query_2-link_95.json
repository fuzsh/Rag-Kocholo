        "text": "Spherical Astronomy\n\nThe Armillary Sphere; the most important Points, Circles, and Terms in the Celestial Sphere\n\nThe Armillary Sphere\n\n1. The ancients at an early period imagined the existence of certain points, circles, &c., on the sphere of the heavens, by means of which they might the more readily comprehend, and be the better able to follow the various celestial phenomena. They also invented an instrument, the armillary sphere, partly with the view of giving an intelligible exhibition of the mutual relation of these points and circles, and of the axis of the heavenly motions, and partly to make actual observations by means of this sphere. The armillary sphere (pl. 6, fig. 1) consists of a frame, with a horizon on which are represented the 360 degrees, the regions of the heavens, the calendar, and the height of the sun for every day in the year. Two notches in the horizontal circle, and corresponding to its north and south points, receive the fixed meridian, whose plane is perpendicular to, and centre coincident with that of the horizontal circle. This meridian, within which the other circles as well as the small terrestrial globe may all be rotated together on the common axis of the heavens and earth, can be moved in these notches, still remaining in the original vertical plane; in this manner the general axis may be placed at various angular distances with the horizon. The centre of the small terrestrial globe is coincident with that of the general armillary sphere, the names and position of the other circles are evident from the figure without further explanation. The hour circle fastened to the north pole of the fixed meridian has a movable index, which, when fastened, revolves with the axis. The artificial sphere known as the celestial globe has the advantage over the armillary sphere in allowing the representation of the stars; but the latter exhibits to the senses far more clearly the relation of the most important points and circles of the celestial sphere to the inclosed terrestrial globe.\n\n2. Fig. 2 gives likewise an explanatory representation of the most important points of spherical astronomy. The circle EHZT is the fixed meridian or noon circle; if its surface represent the western hemisphere of the celestial globe, then HRT is half the horizon, H its north, R its west, and T its south point. Z is the zenith, the visible highest point above the horizon, standing perpendicularly above the centre of the sphere, while N, the nadir, is the invisible lowest point below the horizon; the straight line ZN connecting these points is called the axis of the horizon, and corresponds to the direction of the plummet. The arc ACQ represents the semi-equator, ECK the semi-ecliptic (path of the sun). The equator ACQ passes through the east and west points (R) of the horizon. The point C, where the ecliptic and equator intersect, is called the vernal equinox. The spherical angle ACE, or KCQ, gives the amount of inclination of the ecliptic to the equator, that is, the obliquity of the ecliptic, 23° 27′, measured also by the arc AE or QK. The visible point N, everywhere 90° distant from the equator ACQ, is the north pole, the invisible one N″, directly opposite, is its south pole; the visible point, P, distant from N about 23° 27′, and 90° distant from every point of the ecliptic, is the north pole of the ecliptic, P′ its corresponding and invisible south pole.\n\nLet S′ be the place of any star in the celestial sphere; and from the zenith Z, draw through the star S′ the arc ZS′T′ of a great circle, perpendicular to the horizon HRT, then the circle of which ZS′T′ is only the fourth part is the vertical circle of the star S′; and the arc T′S′ the altitude of this star, which is expressed in degrees, reckoning from the horizon; finally the arc ZS′ is the zenith distance. In the horizon the altitude is 0° and the zenith distance 90°, while in the zenith the altitude is 90°, and the zenith distance 0°. The arc TT′ of the horizon lying between the meridian and the quadrant ZS′T′ of the vertical circle passing through the star S′ is called its azimuth, also measured by the spherical angle T′ZT. The azimuth is reckoned from 0° to 180°, positively from the south point T, eastwardly as far as the north point H, and negatively from T to H, in the opposite direction by the west; as is very evident, the azimuth and altitude of a star completely fix its position in the celestial sphere with respect to the horizon.\n\nIf from the north pole, N, of the equator an arc, NS′Q′, be drawn through the star S′, perpendicular to the equator, the circle of which NS′Q′ is the quadrant is called the declination circle of the star, and the arc Q′S′ the declination. This is called north or south as the star is north or south of the equator, consequently as it stands in the northern or southern hemisphere of the heavens. The declination is estimated in degrees from the equator; at the equator being 0°, and at either of its poles 90°. The part CQ′ of the equator ACQ, lying between the vernal equinox C, and the declination circle NS′Q′ of the star S′, is called the right ascension of this star; it is reckoned from the vernal equinox C, around the equator from west to east, varying from 0° to 360° (or from to 24 hours), and is expressed in these degrees (or hours). By means, then, of the right ascension and declination of a star, we fix its position in the heavens for a long interval of time, with respect to the equator.\n\nDraw from the pole, P, of the ecliptic, ECK, through the star S′, an arc PS′K′, cutting the ecliptic at right angles, then the great circle of which PS′K′ is only the quadrant, is called the circle of latitude of the star S′, and the arc K′S′, the latitude of this star. This is north when the star is above the ecliptic, as in the figure, and south when it is below. The latitude is estimated in degrees from the ecliptic; at the ecliptic it is 0°, at either pole 90°. The part CK′, of the ecliptic ECK, lying between the vernal equinox C, and the circle of latitude PS′K′ of the star S′, is called the longitude of the star. It is estimated on the ecliptic from west to east, and commences with the vernal equinox, expressed in degrees from 0° to 360°, or in terms of the 12 signs of the zodiac. The latitude and longitude of a star completely determine its position on the celestial sphere with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe arc HN of our figure represents the height of the pole N above the horizon HRT, that is, the altitude of the pole; and the arc TQ the height of the equator ARQ (on the meridian), above this horizon HRT, or the altitude of the equator. The altitude of pole and equator for the same place of observation, are together equal to 90°. The spherical angle Q′NQ, having the north pole, N, for its vertex, or the corresponding arc QQ′ of the equator, is called the hour angle of the star S′.\n\n3. The following is a very satisfactory proof among many well known ones, of the spherical shape of the earth. Suppose an observer (fig. 8) stationed at a particular point, S, from which a ship sails off in a straight line. At a short distance the whole of the vessel will be visible to the water-line; with increasing distance the ship decreases in apparent height, but is visible to the water's edge. After reaching the horizon at B, there is not only a still further decrease in apparent size, but a disappearance of part of the vessel itself, beginning with the hull. At C only the sails and masts are visible; the appearance presented is represented by c. From a higher point T, however, whose horizon passes through D, the hull of the ship will be again visible. The distance still increasing, the lower sails seem just to sink into the water, as at d, and finally to disappear entirely. The distinctness with which the summits of the masts are observed, just before their disappearance, must carry home the conviction, that but for the intervening segment, ABCDE, of the sea, the actual distance, SE, is not so great as to prevent an equally perfect view of the whole.\n\nThe most important Points, Circles, and Terms of the Terrestrial Sphere\n\n4. Spherical astronomy determines certain points and circles, as well on the terrestrial as on the celestial sphere. If, for instance, in fig. 12, C represent the centre of the earth, and NCS its axis of rotation, then, N, S, are the poles of the earth, QE the terrestrial equator, and AB the parallel of latitude of the place of observation, A, on the surface. Consequently the straight line, AP, parallel to SCN, is that direction in which the visible pole, P, of the heavens, is seen from the place of observation, A. The line AZ, a prolongation of a radius of the sphere, is the direction of the zenith from the observer at A. Furthermore, let NAES be the meridian of A; NGS, a fixed meridian, as the meridian of Paris; then, GE, or the spherical angle, GNE, is the (geographical) longitude of A, and EA, or the angle EC A, the (geographical) latitude. (For further particulars respecting geographical longitude and latitude, see Section 10.) Finally, if ns be a plane, tangent to the earth’s surface at A, it will constitute the visible apparent horizon of the place; and the straight line, nAs, produced by the intersection of this plane with the meridian, will be the meridian line of A, so that for A, n will be the north, and s the south pole of the horizon.\n\nMiscellaneous Considerations respecting the Apparent Rotation of the Celestial Sphere, and the attendant Phenomena\n\n5. A careful examination of the phenomena exhibited in the apparent daily rotation of the starry heavens, shows that in respect to this rotation, the size of the earth may be considered as entirely insignificant, that is, the observer can be supposed to be situated in the centre of the earth; an assumption very allowable when we reflect on the immense distance of the fixed stars from the earth. Let pl. 6, fig. 13, represent the celestial sphere, i, the observer, Z, his zenith, N, his nadir, then will the circle, HwOeH (whose poles are N and Z), be the celestial horizon; Pp represent the poles of the heavens, the circle, HZONH, the meridian, and HP, the altitude of the pole for the observer at i. This will be readily seen by referring to what was said on the subject in § 2. The circle, EwQeE, perpendicular to the axis, Pp, will be the equator, in which the vernal equinox occurs at âï¸. Then, as already explained in fig. 2, the arc, âï¸T (fig. 13), will be the right ascension, TS the declination, and PS the polar distance of the star, S, projected in the equator by the declination circle, PSTp; BD will also be the diurnal circle (parallel of declination) described by the star in its apparent motion about the pole, P. The circle, ZM, perpendicular to the horizon, is the vertical circle; the arc, HM, the azimuth; MS, the altitude, and ZS the zenith distance of the star, S. Finally, the points, H, w, O, e, are respectively the north, west, south, and east points of the horizon.\n\nIf Hh and Oo represent small parallels of declination, touching the north point of the horizon at H, and the south point at. O, then HA will be the circle of perpetual apparition, between which and the visible pole P the stars never set; and Oo, the circle of perpetual occultation, between which and the invisible pole p the stars never rise. All stars situated between these two circles will be sometimes visible and sometimes invisible. Thus, the star S will be seen when in that part, ABa, of its diurnal circle above the horizon, and will be invisible when in the portion ADa. Furthermore, the same star will, in the diurnal rotation of the heavens, come back to the same meridian every twenty-four hours, and consequently as the daily rotation of the heavens is uniform, the interval of sidereal time between the arrival of the star at the meridian of two different places, may be expressed by the difference of longitude of the two places. On the other hand, the interval expressed in the sidereal time between the arrival of two different stars at the same meridian, is measured by their difference of right ascension, so that here we find one reason for dividing the equator into both degrees and hours. We find, also, from an inspection of figs. 13 and 2, pl. 6, that the altitude of the pole at any place is its geographical latitude, and that the sum of the altitudes of the pole and the equator is always for the same place equal to 90°. Likewise we find that every star attains the greatest height above the horizon at its culmination, and that all stars lying within the circle of perpetual apparition, cross the meridian twice above the horizon, once above the pole, and once below it; the one being the upper culmination or transit, the other the lower.\n\nThe Apparent Course of the Superior and Inferior Planets\n\nIn the Copernican system, the inferior planets, Mercury and Venus, which are nearer the sun than the earth, are distinguished from the superior, Mars, Vesta, Astraea, Juno, Ceres, Pallas, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, which are more remote. This distinction is very proper, as the phenomena attending the courses of the inferior and superior planets, are in many respects essentially different from each other. The reason is, that we view the planets from our earth, which itself revolves around the sun at a different rate from the rest, and therefore we see them at very different distances. We observe therefore not the true, but the apparent courses of the planets, which will now be explained. It must ever be kept in mind, however, that the fixed stars being at almost an infinite distance from our earth, their rays must always reach it in parallel lines. In the first place, to illustrate the apparent course of an inferior planet, let ACEG, in fig. 24, represent the orbit of Venus, acegi that of the earth, and S the sun. Since the distance of Venus from the sun is about three-fourths that of the earth, and since she traverses her orbit in 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) months, then, if in fig. 24 we divide her orbit into 5, and that of the earth into 8 equal parts, one of these will represent the space traversed by each in 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) months. If, when Venus is at A, the earth is at a, the former is said to be in inferior conjunction with the sun (â â â), that is, on the same side of the sun with the earth. Her apparent diameter is here the greatest, although actually invisible (fig. 21); at the expiration of three-fourths of a month, Venus is at B, and the earth at b. The former has consequently retrograded, since, taking the fixed direction of the star s as a line of reference, Venus to the observer on the earth appears to the right of the star, which is seen in the direction bs, parallel to As. It is also evident that Venus has become a morning star, since when the observer at b looks towards the sun, he sees the planet on the right of the sun. Hence Venus is seen in the eastern horizon before the rising of the sun. Pl. 6, fig. 21, represents her at this time, crescentic, and with two digits illuminated.\n\nA month and a half after inferior conjunction, the fixed star in whose vicinity Venus was seen when the earth was at b, will be seen in a direction parallel to Bb, from the earth at c; consequently Venus will be seen in the direction Cc, to the left or eastwardly of this star. Hence, it follows that the apparent motion of Venus has again become direct. It will also be seen from fig. 24, that the angle scS, formed by lines drawn from the earth to the sun and the planet, is larger than the former angle, SbB; we accordingly say that the elongation of Venus has increased. The illuminated part of her disk has (as seen in fig. 21) increased to about four digits; her apparent diameter, however, sensibly diminishes. This elongation must be greatest at the time when the earth (fig. 24) is at d, and Venus at D, which is the case about 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) months after inferior conjunction; and this greatest elongation is equal to the angle DdS. Venus then (fig. 21), like the moon in her last quarter, has half of her disk, or six digits, illuminated.\n\nHalf a year after inferior conjunction, when the earth is at f, Venus will have reached F, consequently the elongation of Venus has again become less, since the angle, SfF, expressing this elongation, is evidently less than the angle SdD. Venus, then, during this time has approached the sun, has become fuller (fig. 21), but nevertheless smaller, although still the morning star (fig. 24). Three months after, the earth is at h, and Venus at H; the latter has therefore reached superior conjunction, that is, is on the opposite side of the sun from the earth. Her apparent diameter is now the least, and her entire disk (fig. 21) illuminated, although invisible. At a later period she appears in the evening sky as the evening star, and exhibits the same phases (fig. 21) as before, but in an inverted order. Her apparent diameter also increases.\n\nTo illustrate the course of a superior planet, let S (fig. 25) represent the sun in the centre of the earth’s orbit, abcdefgh. Let that of Mars be ACEGJLN. The earth revolves in twelve, and Mars in about twenty-three months. about the sun. If, therefore, the original positions of the earth and Mars were at a and A, at the expiration of 1,2, 3, 4, &c., months, the earth will have reached the points b, c, d, e, &c.; and Mars B, C, D, E, &c., respectively. When the earth was at a, and Mars at A, the latter was in opposition to the sun (â â â), and the stars in the vicinity of Mars must show themselves in the direction az. The motion of all the planets from A to B is called direct; consequently Mars has a direct motion when advancing from the stars observed in the direction az, towards the left, and a retrograde motion when moving towards the right. Pl. 6, fig. 25, shows also that when the earth goes towards b, and Mars towards B, the motion of the latter must be retrograde, because he is observed to the right of the stars at z, seen in a direction, by, parallel to az. Therefore Mars, at the time of opposition, retrogrades.\n\nAfter the earth has arrived at b, Mars is at B, and consequently no longer exactly opposite to the sun, S; but as the stars seen in the direction by culminate about midnight, he will then have passed the meridian and will be near his setting, and consequently will be seen in the evening sky.\n\nTwo months after opposition, the earth being at c, and Mars at C, the retrograde motion of the latter will have ceased, since the straight lines connecting b, B and c, C, are nearly parallel; consequently to an observer at the earth, the planet will appear stationary for some days. At a later period the motion of Mars will be direct. Two months later, Mars, still moving direct, will be at D, and the earth at d, so that now the lines c C, d D, form the angle Cd′D. It is evident that the directions dS, dD, from the earth to the sun and to the planet, form nearly a right angle to each other, and consequently that about this time Mars at sunset must be near the south, and must set about midnight.\n\nAt the end of the tenth month, when the earth is at g, Mars has not completed half his apparent course in the heavens, as shown by his not having reached a point opposite to the stars seen in the direction gx. The distance of Mars from the sun, however, is apparently only the angle GgS; as at this time an observer at g, looking towards the sun and planet, sees the latter to the left or eastward of the former. Mars must appear in the evening sky, after sunset, and evidently much smaller than at time of opposition.\n\nAt the expiration of a full year, the earth being at h, and the planet at H, the straight line, hH, shows that Mars has completed rather more than half the apparent circuit of the heavens, since the stars in the direction z stand nearly opposite to him. Consequently the conjunction of Mars with the sun (â â â) has not yet taken place, as, from an inspection of fig. 25, it will be seen that the sun still appears to the right of Mars or H.\n\nTwo months later Mars is seen early in the morning sky, for since from i, the position of the observer, the planet is seen to the right of the sun, at I, he must evidently rise before the sun. By continuing this consideration, with f he assistance of fig. 25, we shall soon find that Mars, shortly before his new opposition, again becomes retrograde, and that the phenomena before observed must all succeed each other again in the same order.\n\nFrom all that 'has preceded it follows, without further explanation, that the inferior planets have an inferior and a superior conjunction, but no opposition; that the superior planets have a conjunction and an opposition, never two conjunctions; and, finally, that while the inferior planets are never visible in the heavens at midnight, the superior may be seen at any hour of the night.\n\nThe Moon; her Revolution around the Earth; Phases of the Moon; the Moon’s Nodes\n\n7. Our earth, in her yearly course about the sun, is accompanied by a satellite, the moon, which revolves around the earth in about a month., and in little more than four weeks wanders through the whole zodiac. We need only observe the moon for a few hours, on several successive clear evenings, to satisfy ourselves that while, with the other stars, she follows the diurnal motion from morning till night, she has a peculiar motion of her own, from west to east, advancing daily a little over 13 degrees among the fixed stars of the zodiac. This peculiar motion of the moon is the result of her revolution about the earth; and for the same reason, being an opaque body illuminated by the sun, she is exhibited in all possible shapes (phases). The four principal of these are, the new moon, the first quarter, the full moon, and the last quarter. The new and full moon are known as the syzigies; the first and last quarters as the quadratures. Pl. 6, fig. 19, offers an intelligible illustration of the various phases of the moon, depending on her different position with respect to the sun and earth. Let abcd be the earth placed in the middle of the moon’s orbit, NEVLN, and S the sun, whose distance, Sa, from the earth is supposed to be so great that all his rays are parallel to the line SNV. Let the moon be at Nβγα, or between the earth and sun, her dark side, βγα, will then be turned to the illuminated side (dac) of the earth. At this time the moon is new, and being above the horizon in the day time, is invisible. Compare pl. 10, fig. 5. Two or three days after this time, the moon, moving in her orbit in the direction of the arrow (fig. 19), is seen soon after sunset, in the evening sky, as a narrow crescent, which soon sets. This crescentic shape of the moon becomes broader, and she sets later every day, and removing constantly from the sun, she shines through the first hours of the night. In about seven days the moon will have reached Lπνμ, or the first quarter, and to an observer at d, or the boundary between day and night, will be seen to the left of the sun, as a semicircular disk, with the straight edge to the left or east: the moon now culminates about six o’clock in the evening (see pl. 10, fig. 5), and sets about midnight. From this time, the outline which from new moon to the first quarter was concave, becomes convex; the moon shines longer, and sets after midnight. In about seven days she will have reached Vλκη, and become full, standing directly opposite the sun, behind the earth; her illuminated half, λκη, consequently, to the dark side, dcb, of the earth, appears as a full circle, which rises in the east as the sun sets in the west, culminates at midnight, and sets in the west at sunrise. The moon now rises about an hour later each night, and gradually loses the illumination of her right or westerly side, so that the circular disk becomes oval, until, in seven days after full moon, she will have arrived at Eζεδ, or the last quarter. To the observer at c, the boundary between night and day, her illuminated side, Eεδ, appears as a half disk, to the left or west of the sun, and the line separating the dark and the illuminated portion will be on the west side, while in the first quarter it was on the east. At the last quarter, she rises about midnight, and crosses the meridian at about 6 o’clock in the morning. Her semicircular disk now begins to become narrower, the straight edge concave, and the moon again assumes, as she approaches the sun, a crescent shape, which is smaller as the interval of time between the rise of the moon and that of the sun diminishes. About seven days after the last quarter, the moon entirely vanishes, again reaching Nβγα, her position about four weeks before. She now becomes new moon afresh, rising and setting with the sun, and her phases follow in the same succession.\n\n8. Since our earth is also an opaque globe illuminated by the sun, we must present the same alternation of phases to an observer at the moon, that the moon presents to us, only in an inverted order. At the time, therefore, of new moon, first quarter, full, and last quarter, our earth must be full earth, last quarter, new earth, and first quarter.\n\nThe moon, during a revolution around the earth, describes an orbit, cutting the apparent path of the sun (the ecliptic), or the orbit of the earth, to which it is inclined about 5° 8′ 48″, in two points called the moon’s nodes (pl. 6, fig. 20). The point in which the centre of the moon cuts the ecliptic in passing from the south to the north, is called the moon’s ascending node, â, or the head of the dragon; and the one produced in passing from north to south, the moon’s descending mode, â, or the dragon’s tail. The distance of the moon from the ecliptic is called the latitude, which may be north or south. At the nodes, the latitude is 0°; hence it follows that the sun, moon, and earth (the sun and earth being in the same plane), must lie at all times nearly in the same plane (fig. 20), and when the moon is in one of her nodes, that is in the ecliptic itself, then the three bodies—sun, moon, and earth—have their centres in the same straight line.\n\nThe ancients observed that the moon’s nodes did not remain in the same part of the ecliptic, but continually moved backwards, or from east to west (indicated in fig. 20 by the dotted lines). This retrogression takes place in the following manner: one of the nodes of the moon’s orbit—the ascending, for instance—retrogrades in such a manner that if it had coincided with the new moon at starting, this coincidence would again happen after an interval of 18 years and 11 days. The moon’s node will then be still 11 degrees distant from the position assumed 18 years and 11 days before. But the sun has in the meantime advanced 11 degrees, and consequently stands again in the node; therefore, since the moon is again in the new moon, an eclipse of the sun must occur, just as it did 18 years, 11 days before. However, the coincidence of the new moon with the node does not take place exactly in the same manner. These periods of 18 years and 11 days, supposed to have been called Saros by the Chaldsean astronomers, are known as the periods of Halley, and were employed by the ancients in the prediction of solar and lunar eclipses. The retrogression of the moon’s nodes is a consequence of the secular perturbations of the moon’s orbit, and at a mean, with reference to the fixed stars, amounts annually to 19° 20′ 29″ (pl. 6, fig. 20).\n\nThe Seasons; Daily and Yearly Motion of the Sun\n\n9. The illustration on pl. 9, figs. 1, 2, 3, serves to elucidate the theory of seasons, and of the daily and annual motion of the sun. The following may be taken in connexion with what is said further on (sect. 26) respecting the annual motion of the earth round the sun.\n\nThe visible horizon is that circle in whose centre we are supposed to stand, and which bounds our vision, and upon which the heavens appear to rest. The sun is said to rise in the morning when it appears above the horizon, as at C, pl. 9, fig. 2, and to set in the evening when sinking below the horizon, as at C′. The sun appears each day to describe a greater or less circular arc, CMC′, above the horizon, and this arc is constantly inclined towards the horizon. Noon of a place is that time of day when the sun at M has arrived at its greatest height above the horizon. The vertical of a place (Paris in fig. 2) is the straight line VT, parallel to the direction of the plumb line. The line RSO is the meridian line of Paris, or the direction of a shadow at time of noon at Paris; the four points, O, G, R, L, are the four cardinal points of the horizon. The sun appears to traverse a part, CMC, of a circle by day, completed at night in C′NC. beneath the horizon, and the entire apparent circuit of the sun about the earth lasts 24 hours, or an entire day. A careful examination will, however, disclose the fact that the points of rising and setting of the sun, as also those in which he cuts the meridian, vary from day to day, with respect to the horizon of one and the same place. Thus, on 21st December, CMC′ is the day circle of the sun; GQL that of the 20th March, greater than the preceding, and KUA that of the 21st of June, which is greatest of all. Hence the sun appears to remain stationary for a time, and then to return towards the south, describing anew the arc GQL to the 23d of September, and CMC′ on the 21st of December, as before. Here he appears stationary for a time, and then returns to the north as before. These arcs described by the sun are all parallel to each other: the greatest of them, KUAK (towards the north) is called the tropic of Cancer, the least, CMC′NC (to the south) the tropic of Capricorn. The two periods of the year in which the sun describes the tropics are called the solstices. The circle described on the 23d September and the 20th March is called the equator, and the two periods when the sun describes the equator are called the equinoxes. Consequently the sun seems to move north for six months in the year, viz. from December 21st to 21st June, and south for six months, from 21st June to 21st December.\n\nThere is still another motion observable in the case of the sun, viz. a daily progression eastward of about a degree, while the fixed stars retain their relative positions unchanged. Since now 1° in space answers to four minutes in time, the sun will return to the same point of the heavens four minutes later each day, which in 90 days will amount to six hours. The imaginary straight line, PF, passing through the centre, S, of the horizon, and about which the sun appears to describe his circles, is called the axis of the heavens. Since all parallel circles of the sun are inclined to the horizon, and the axis of the heavens is perpendicular to their planes, the axis itself will be inclined to the horizon at the angle PSO, or the arc PO. Their two extremities, P, F, are called the poles, P being the north pole, F the south. From the preceding it follows, that for all planes between the equator and the poles of the earth, the celestial sphere is oblique (pl. 9, fig. 3), since the equator, the parallels of declination, and the axis of rotation, have an oblique situation with respect to the horizon.\n\nIf the observer be situated at the north pole (fig. 4). O, then the celestial sphere becomes to him parallel, since there the equator and the tropics, as seen in fig. 4, are parallel to the horizon. The axis Pp of the horizon coincides with the axis of the sphere Pp, and the horizon Hh with the equator Ee. Should the sun be situated in the plane of the equator, he will describe the circle SH, or the horizon, his disk being half above and half below it. When, after the expiration of three months, the sun has reached the tropic of Cancer at S″, he will describe the circle S″N, 23° 27′ above the horizon. He will now be evidently above the horizon, and, in fact, so remain for three months longer, gradually returning to the equator. Thus at and about the north pole the day is six months long. As a matter of course the region about the south pole of the earth must have an equal length of night. During the other six months of the year, these conditions are reversed for the two poles. The fixed stars, however, of these regions never set, that is, those of the northern heavens at the north pole, and those of the southern heavens at the south pole, since they describe their circles parallel to the horizon.\n\nFig. 5, pl. 9, shows the position of the points and circles of the celestial sphere to the observer at the equatorial regions of the earth. There the two poles, P, p, lie in the horizon, Hh, and consequently the axis, Pp, zenith, E, and nadir, c, in the equator. The planes of the equator and tropics are perpendicular to the plane of the horizon, whence the celestial globe forms a right sphere. The fixed stars all rise and set perpendicularly to the horizon; each one remaining visible for 12 hours, and invisible for a like portion of time. It is very evident that, in the region of the equator, all the fixed stars must gradually come in sight, and that whether the sun describe the circles, S, S′, or S″, they will all be divided into two equal parts by the horizon. In consequence of this, throughout the whole year at the equator, the days and nights will be equal, and of 12 hours each.\n\nThe Geographical Latitude and Longitude of a place; Determination of these\n\n10. An accurate knowledge of the geographical latitude and longitude of a place, that is, its geographical position upon the earth, is of vast importance to mathematical geography and navigation. The geographical latitude of a place is the shortest distance of the place from the equator, expressed in degrees, minutes, and seconds. It will, therefore, be northern or southern, as the place lies north or south of the equator. If, through the given place and the axis of the earth, we pass a great circle, cutting the equator at right angles, it will be the circle of latitude of the place, and that part of the circle intercepted between the place and the equator, will be its geographical latitude, which may consequently range from 0° to 90°. Any place at the equator has a latitude of 0°; at the poles the latitude will be 90°. Now, as the altitude of the poles is equal to the latitude of the place of observation, we know the one when we know the other. For the determination of the altitude of the pole, a knowledge of the mutual situation of the zenith and pole, with reference to the horizon and equator, is necessary, and this can only be obtained by measurement of the altitudes of certain stars. In practice, therefore, the determination of the altitudes of the pole will depend upon the accuracy with which this measurement can be effected. Various methods have been devised to meet the wants of observation, as also the uncertainties which result from the declination of the star employed, its parallax, and refraction, so that the following eight methods of determining polar altitudes have been suggested and followed.\n\n1, By the meridian altitude of the star; 2, by circummeridian altitudes; 3, by two culmination altitudes at the superior and inferior transits across the meridian; 4, by two meridian altitudes in the southern and northern parts of the meridian; 5, by the altitude of the polar star; 6, by equal altitudes of the circumpolar stars; 7, by altitudes of two stars and the observed interval of time; 8, by the observation of a star in its passage through the eastern and western part of the prime vertical.\n\nThe geographical longitude of a place is the arc of the equator intercepted between the circle of latitude of the place, and the circle of latitude of another place, assumed as a fixed point of reference. The latter circle of latitude is then called the first meridian, and the former the meridian of the place whose longitude is to be determined. Since nature indicates no definite line or circle of departure for the determination of longitude, as she has done in the equator for the determination of latitude, it is evident that the position of the prime vertical, and consequently the amount of the longitude, must be entirely arbitrary. This uncertainty has had for its consequence, the assumption of various standards, inconvenient in practice, and very often producing mischievous effects upon the interests of navigation, which, although now palliated, have not been entirely removed. The difference in the estimate of longitude has, however, been hitherto still greater among astronomers than among navigators, although a difference in estimating the longitude among the former, where calculation is appealed to for assistance, is much less troublesome than among the latter. Almost every astronomer counted the geographical longitude from his own observatory. The meridian of Paris has, however, more recently been selected by the astronomers of the continent of Europe, to which almost all observations and geographical longitudes are referred. It is generally customary in astronomy, at the present time, to regard only the meridian difference of two places of observation, or the angle which the meridian or noon circles of the two places bear to each other, at the pole lying nearest to them. This angle is, of course, measured by the arc of the equator lying between the two meridian circles. This difference of geographical longitude is often called the meridian difference of two places, since it is equal to the difference of time given by two clocks keeping true time, at the respective places of observation. This difference expressed in hours, minutes, and seconds, is converted into degrees, minutes, &c., by being multiplied by 15, and then will be equal to the above-mentioned angle formed by the two meridian circles at the pole, or the arc of the equator contained between these circles.\n\nThe measurement of the distance of two meridian circles, however involves greater difficulties than the determination of the altitude of the pole. The meridian difference of two places is determined by the time required by a star, in the course of its apparent daily revolution, to pass from the meridian of the eastward place to that of the western. Should this star be the sun, we can only compare the times which the clocks in the two places show at one and the same moment. For since at each place the clocks are set 0, or 12, at the time the sun passes his meridian, these, if they keep accurate time, must always differ by the same number of hours, minutes, and seconds. There is therefore only needed some means by which the clocks and instruments used at the different places of observation may be compared with each other, and this may be done in two ways; first, by carrying one clock to the other, without changing their rate in the least; or, secondly, by observing the clock time at which some phenomenon visible from both places, and determinable to the seconds, takes place. The difference in time obtained by either of these methods is then the desired meridian difference, or the difference in longitude, of the two places. We may also remark that the first method consists in the employment and application of portable clocks or chronometers. The second, however, consists in the observation, a, of eclipses of the moon and of Jupiter's satellites; b, of occultations; c, of eclipses of the sun; d, of corresponding culminations of the moon and neighboring fixed stars; e, of lunar distances; and f, of gunpowder or other artificial signals. It is not our place here, to go over these different methods separately and circumstantially, nor to explain the mode of calculating the meridian difference desired. It must suffice to examine a little more closely one, and indeed a very simple method, namely, to show how from observations of the eclipses of one of Jupiter’s satellites in two places, the difference of their geographical longitude can be obtained. Let, for instance, in pl. 10, fig. 1, E be the place of one observer, V that of another, both points being on the surface of the earth. Let both observers note by their clocks the time of their place at which the eclipse of any one of Jupiter’s satellites takes place, that is, the time when the satellite begins to enter the cone of shadow ending at x. We will now assume that the time at E is 8 o’clock and the time at V is 10 o’clock, the difference of these two periods amounts to 2 hours 30°, therefore V is 30° east of E.\n\nUnfortunately, the moments (beginning and end) of an eclipse of one of Jupiter’s satellites cannot be so readily determined as that of the moon, on account of the unequal illumination and magnifying power of the different telescopes, as also the different acuteness of vision of different observers. Consequently, the meridian difference deduced will not be accurate, or at any rate not reliable; while the other methods admit of greater precision.\n\nThe Fixed Stars; their Size, Number, Arrangement, and Distances\n\n11. By fixed stars is to be understood all those stars which are neither planets, nor moons, nor comets, deriving the name from the fact of never changing their relative positions when viewed with the naked eye. The fixed stars are the most numerous objects in the heavens, and are divided into eight classes, according to their various apparent sizes and brilliancy. We speak, for instance, of stars of 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th magnitude, so that those of the 1st magnitude possess the greatest brilliancy, and those of the 7th are only visible to the very acute naked eye. To the 8th class, that is, to those of the 8th, 9th, 10th, &c., magnitudes, belong all those millions of stars which are only visible through the telescope, hence called telescopic stars. The color also, especially in the double stars, is very various.\n\nAlthough the fixed stars do not change their relative positions to each other, yet they have a common apparent motion, produced by the actual daily rotation of the earth on. its axis; in addition to this, the annual revolution of the earth about the sun produces various differences in their position with respect to the sun. Finally, there are other although very minute variations in the position of the stars with respect to the horizon, the equator, the ecliptics, &c., produced by refraction, parallax, precession of the equinoxes, nutation, &c, which will be referred to hereafter.\n\nAs the number of the stars is apparently infinite, it must necessarily be impossible for us ever to estimate it. Nevertheless, many astronomers have attempted to determine this approximately, at least with respect to the visible stars. The number of those of the first magnitude is 14, of the second, 70, of the third, nearly 300; that of stars of the 4th and succeeding magnitudes is much greater. The fixed stars stand so close together in many parts of the heavens, that any enumeration of these would be absolutely impossible. We need only examine the milky way through a good telescope, to discover that it consists of an innumerable number of fixed stars. Herschel at one time saw more than 50,000 stars cross the fixed field of his great reflector in a space of 30 degrees, near the club of Orion: at another time, he observed 258,000 to pass his 20 foot reflector in 41 minutes.\n\nLambert, in his “Kosmologische Briefe,” was the first to treat of the distribution and arrangement of stars in the heavens. It is in more recent times, however, since the discovery by Madler of the central sun of our system of fixed stars, that the first tolerably satisfactory explanation of the arrangement of the stars has been given. With respect also to the distances of the stars, nothing more definite was known than that the nearest of them was so remote as to require six years for its light to reach our earth. Bessel and Struve, however, by means of observations of the particular motions exhibited by the double stars 61 Cygni, and Vega (α) Lyræ, have determined these distances with approximate accuracy. According to Bessel’s investigations, the distance between our sun and star 61 Cygni would be traversed by light within ten years.\n\n12. Besides the division of stars according to their apparent size, they are classified as single, double, and multiple stars, variable and temporary stars, and nebulous stars. These will all be referred to hereafter. Groups of stars which are visible, partly to the naked eye, partly by means of the telescope, are called constellations; while those in which, even with the aid of the most powerful telescope, the individual stars cannot be made out, the whole appearing as a light nebulous cloud, are called nebulæ. Finally, that belt of light formed by innumerable stars, and encompassing the whole heavens, varying in breadth and concentration, exhibiting sometimes one branch, and sometimes two, is called the milky way. This passes through the constellations (pls. 12, 13) Cassiopeia, Perseus, Orion, Gemini, Argo, Centaurus, Ara, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Ophiuchus, Aquila, Cygnus, and Cepheus. Its two branches unite in Ara and Cygnus.\n\nThe Constellations\n\n13. For the sake of assisting the memory in recollecting the general distribution and relations of the stars in the sky, they have been divided into constellations. Those of the northern hemisphere are represented in pl. 12, those of the southern in pl. 13. These constellations are groups of fixed stars, whose outlines have been supposed to represent figures of men, animals, and other objects, and to which corresponding names have been given. With the arrangement of new constellations, it becomes necessary to have new names, which may either be derived from the animal kingdom, as done by the ancients, e. g. the Giraffe and the Lizard, or names may be selected commemorating important discoveries and inventions in the arts and sciences, e. g. the compass, the air pump, and the pendulum clock.\n\nThe names of the separate constellations, as given by Hipparchus, are the following:—\n\nThe Twelve Constellations of the Zodiac\n\nâï¸ Aries, (Ram,) Widder.\n\nâï¸ Taurus, (Bull,) Stier.\n\nâï¸ Gemini, (Twins,) Zwillinge.\n\nâï¸ Cancer, (Crab,) Krebs.\n\nâï¸ Leo, (Lion,) Löwe.\n\nâï¸ Virgo, (Virgin,) Jungfrau.\n\nâï¸ Libra, (Balance,) Wage.\n\nâï¸ Scorpio, (Scorpion,) Skorpion.\n\nâï¸ Sagittarius, (Archer,) Schütze.\n\nâï¸ Capricornus, (Goat,) Steinbock.\n\nâï¸ Acquarius, (Water Bearer,) Wassermann.\n\nâï¸ Pices, (The Fish,) Fische.\n\nThe Twenty-one Constellations of the Northern Heavens\n\nCassiopeia, (Cassiopeia,) Kassiopeia.\n\nAndromeda, (Andromeda,) Andromeda.\n\nTriangulum, (Triangle,) Nödliches Dreieck.\n\nPerseus, (Perseus,) Perseus.\n\nAuriga, (Charioteer,) Fuhrmann.\n\nUrsa Major, (Great Bear,) Grosser Bär.\n\nDraco Borealis, (Dragon,) Nödl.

For the sake of more readily learning the constellations and their particular stars, as also for the more certain guidance of astronomers, those delineations on paper of the starry heavens known as celestial maps, or maps of the stars, have been invented. These maps comprehend either the two planispheres, as in pls. 12 and 13, and are then called planispheres, or they contain single parts of the heavens, and then together form an atlas. The celestial maps of Bayer, Doppelmayer, Goldbach, Flamsteed, Bode. Harding, Schwinck, Riedig, Argelander, and others, are well known. Besides the introduction of constellations, the ancients, particularly the Arabians, ascribed particular names to the brighter fixed stars, as, for instance, in Orion (pl. 12), Bellatrix and Betelgeux, Capella in Auriga, Altair in Aquila, Arcturus in Bootes. Castor and Pollux in Gemini, Marcab in Pegasus, &c., and in pl. 13, Rigel in Orion, Fomalhaut in Piscis Australis, Sirius in Canis Major, Antares in Scorpio, &c. Johann Bayer, however, in the beginning of the seventeenth century, introduced a much better and more complete assistant to the memory in recollecting and referring to the stars, by employing the letters of the Greek and Roman alphabets, which convenient notation has since been justly retained. It may be observed in the two charts of the stars, pls. 12, 13.\n\nA very easy means of finding and readily learning the most important stars and constellations is afforded by what is called the method of alignments; this consists in having straight lines drawn in the chart (pls. 12, 13) connecting the single brighter stars, thus forming triangles and quadrilaterals, which are again reconstructed in the sky by imaginary lines drawn between these stars. This will be referred to hereafter.\n\nThe Double Stars; Remarkable Constellations of Stars; Nebulous Spots and Stars\n\n15. By double stars is meant two stars, generally so near together that to the naked eye they appear but as a single star. There are nevertheless many double stars only visible through the telescope. These may consist of two kinds—optical, or apparent, and physical, or actual double stars. The first are such as, not related to each other, happen to fall nearly on the same line of vision; the latter are those which, connected in one system, revolve the one about the other. One of these is frequently larger than the other, although sometimes their size is nearly equal. Their colors, however, are always different. The single fixed stars and the optical double stars shine only with a whitish light, verging sometimes on yellow, sometimes on red. The physical or actual double stars, of which alone we here treat, have only been studied within the last few decades. The peculiar motions of these remarkable stars appear to occur according to the Newtonian laws of gravitation, and Savary, Encke, John Herschel, and Mädler, have already determined the orbits of many double stars, as 70 p, Ophiuchus, polar star, γ Andromedas, ζ Ursse Majoris, ζ Herculis, &c., as also their periods of revolution, which latter in some double stars amount to a few years, in others to many centuries. Since one of two double stars, as before stated, revolves around the other, it may readily happen that with respect to our earth one may pass before the other so as to cover it completely. This has actually been confirmed by observation. Thus, for instance, stars which once were double are now single, and others which were once single are now seen as double. Consequently the apparent distances of the double stars cannot be otherwise than variable. Struve has published a catalogue of 3112 double and multiple stars, arranged in order, which is thus far the most complete and accurate.\n\nSince the double stars generally present very slight points of light of various distance and distinctness, their observation may serve as the surest test of the excellence of a telescope. Achromatic telescopes, which, for instance, merely exhibit ζ, Ursa Major, or Mizar (pl. 12, fig. 3), and γ Andromeda, Alamak (fig. 6), as double stars, are only of ordinary power. Those, however, are much better which show as double stars Castor and Pollux, or α Gemini (pl. 12, fig. 1) and the pole star, or α Ursa; Minor is (fig. 9), as also Mesarthim, or γ Arietis (fig. 8), and Cor Caroli in Canes Venatici (fig. 10). An instrument that shall show γ Virginis (fig. 2), α Arietis (fig. 5), β Ononis, or Rigel (fig. 7), and Ras Algithi, or α Herculis (fig. 4), as double, is one of extraordinary excellence. The double star Vega, or α Lyræ (fig. 11), is probably not really but only optically double, the smaller of the 12 magnitudes being distant about 43 seconds from the principal stars.\n\n16. Among the spots of the northern heavens richest in stars belong the groups figured on pl. 12; the Pleiades, or the seven stars, fig. 12, in the back of Taurus, the Hyades, or rain stars, fig. 13, in the forehead of Taurus, the little group of stars (fig. 14) between the tips, β and ζ, of the horns of Taurus; the rich region about Vega and Lyra; the so called Lucida Lyræ; the numerous stars about Arcturus (fig. 16), in Bootes, and the vicinity of the great remarkable nebula (fig. 17) in Orion.\n\nWith respect to the nebulous spots and stars, pl. 13 (figs. 1 to 20) represents twenty of the largest and most beautiful. Fig. 1 is a double nebula in Gemini (108° 45′ right ascension, and 29° 49′ declination), consisting of two round nebulæ touching each other, which shine almost like stars. Fig. 2 exhibits the double nebula in Coma Berenicis (right ascension 187° 0′, declination 12° 8′), of great brilliancy. Fig. 3 gives a view of a small double nebula of right ascension 158° 15′, declination south 17° 55′. Fig. 4 is a curiously shaped nebula in Ophiuchus (Serpentarius). Fig. 5 represents two nebulous spots touching each other nearly at right angles, of tolerably elliptical shape, to be found in the constellation of Canes Venatici. Fig. 6 represents the remarkable annular nebula in Lyra, rt. asc. 281°; 45′, N. dec. 32° 49′, whose opening is filled with a second ash-grey nebula the whole appearing like a veil drawn over an almost circular hoop. At 33° 0′ of right ascension and 41° 34′ North declination, in Perseus, is seen a distinct and very eccentric nebula (fig. 7) of 4′ length and 40″ breadth, in whose midst is a concentric, also elliptical, space, at whose two extremes two little stars are seen. Still more remarkable is the nebulous spot (rt. asc. 268° 0′, S. dec. 23° 1′) in Sagittarius (fig. 8), seemingly split into three pieces; a double star is seen in the midst of the dark interspace. Fig. 9 gives a view of the extremely remarkable and tolerably large nebula in constellation Robur Caroli of the southern hemisphere, consequently not visible in the northern. A number of minute stars will be observed to shine out from it.\n\nThe following may be particularly mentioned among the number of irresolvable planetary nebulae. The well known great nebula in Andromeda (pl. 13, fig. 10), visible to the naked eye, of peculiar feebly glimmering light, 30′ in diameter; the stars standing in its vicinity do not appear to belong to it. A nebula (fig. 11) occurs in Cetus, similar to the one in Perseus (fig. 7), only longer and broader. A curiously shaped elongated nebula (fig. 12) is met with in Cygnus, while planetary, entirely round, and brilliant nebulous spots exhibit themselves in Sagittarius (fig. 13) and the hand of Andromeda (fig. 14). A spot (fig. 15) similar to these last is shown in Orion, and a granular nebula, with a very bright spot, in Ursa Major (rt. asc. 127° 45′, N. dec. 50° 49′). But the most remarkable, perhaps, of all is the great nebula in Orion (fig. 17), under the middle of the (so called) Jacob’s Staff, near the star Θ; distinguished above all the others by its peculiar shape (not unlike the opened jaws of a wild beast), by the curious variety in the distribution of its light, as well as by its great extent. Even the fixed stars in and about it are remarkable for their lustre, and the positions of some of them appear to have a particular relation to the nebula itself. It has been supposed, from a comparison of older figures of this nebula with its present appearance, that it has undergone a decided change, although this is by no means absolutely certain. An almost equally remarkable object is found in the constellation Vulpes (rt. asc. 298° 0′ and N. decl. 22° 17′), in the shape of a large oval nebulous spot (fig. 18), whose major axis is to its minor as 4 to 3. In the two foci are found two circular nebulae, much darker, and equally illuminated in all parts. Fig. 19 represents a curious nebulous figure found in the head of the northern Canis Venaticus. It is a round, bright, central spot, surrounded by a nebulous ring split on one side. Further improvements in the telescope will probably exhibit more clearly the true character of these wonderful objects. The Magellanic Clouds, observed in the southern hemisphere and invisible to us (fig. 20), are in like manner highly remarkable appearances of the starry heavens, consisting of isolated clear spots, like separated portions of the Milky Way. According to Horner, who has communicated some observations on these Magellanic Clouds, the greater of them is about as bright as the Milky Way in its brightest part, as near Cygnus, while La Caille was not able to find a single star in them with his 14-foot telescope.\n\nMultiple, Variable, and New Stars\n\n17. In conclusion, it remains to state that, besides the double stars, there are threefold and fourfold, or multiple stars, as also changeable and new stars. Threefold stars are found, for example, in Orion, under 72\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)° rt. asc, and 14\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)° N. decl., in ζ Cancer, ξ Libra, 7 Taurus, Ψ Cassiopeia, π Monoceros, Ψ Libra, as also in Lynx, under 97\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)° rt. asc. and 59\\(\\frac{3}{5}\\)° N. declination. Of the fourfold stars Θ Orion is perhaps the most distinguished; it stands very near the darkest part of the great nebula in Orion; ε Lyra is also a fourfold star. Among multiple stars, ζ Orion is known as the most remarkable; it was known by Schröter as a 12-fold, but by Struve as a 16-fold star. The variable stars are also remarkable, that is, those stars whose apparent magnitude does not remain the same. These stars shine within a certain period with various degrees of brilliancy, and it is said that they have a certain period, as, for instance, Algol in Perseus, α Hercules, β Lyra, γ Antinous, δ Cepheus, &c. Nevertheless the periods of several variable stars appear subject to many irregularities. Other stars often vanish entirely, and reappear at a later period, as Mira in Cetus, κ Cygni, and seven stars in Leo, Virgo, Hydra, Corona, and Aquarius.\n\nIn addition to all these, stars have sometimes appeared suddenly in regions of the heavens tolerably free from stars, which could not have been there before; such appeared in Aquila in 389, between Cepheus and Cassiopeia in 945, again near the same place in 1264, in Cassiopeia (Tycho’s star) in 1572 and 1573, in Ophiuchus, 1604 and 1605, and in Cygnus (Anthelm’s star), 1670. Astronomers have not yet been able to frame a satisfactory hypothesis to explain the phenomena which the variable and new stars exhibit in so remarkable a manner.\n\nTheoretical Astronomy\n\nThe Circle and the Ellipse\n\n18. In the study of Astronomy a knowledge of the circle and ellipse is absolutely necessary. If a straight line, CD (pl. 6, fig. 3), make a complete revolution in the same plane around one extremity, C, the other end, D, will describe the circumference, DHAGFD, in which each point is equally distant from the centre, C. The plane surface inclosed by this circumference is called the circle. Every straight line drawn from the centre, C, to the circumference is a radius; and every straight line connecting two points of a circumference and passing through the centre is a diameter (AB). All radii are equal to each other, so also are all diameters. Any straight line connecting two points of the circumference, not passing through the centre, is called a chord (EF). It divides the circle into two unequal parts, EAHDBF and EGF, of which the latter, as the smaller, is called the segment. The diameter, AB, on the contrary, divides the circle into two equal parts, AHDB and AEGFB, called semicircles. The angle. DCB, formed by two radii, DC and CB, at the centre of the circle, is called a central angle; the surface, BCD, inclosed between a central angle and the arc of the circumference inclosed between the radii, is called a sector. Finally, a straight line outside of the circle and touching the circumference in only one point, is called a tangent, JK.\n\nAn ellipse, ADBEA (pl. 6, fig. 4), is a complete curve, possessing the peculiarity that, if two straight lines be drawn from certain points, SS′, in its area, called the foci, to any point in the circumference, their sum will be equal to the sum of similar lines drawn to any other points. Thus SP + S′P = Sp + S′p. This same sum will also be always equal to the length of the greater axis, AB. The lines SP and S′P (or also Sp and S′p) are called the radii vectores of the point P (or p). The straight line, DC, passing through the centre, C, at right angles to the major axis, AB, is called the minor axis. CS or CS′ is called the eccentricity of the ellipse. Should this ellipse represent the orbit of a planet in one of whose foci the sun is situated, then if the planet be situated at P or p, the line SP or Sp will be the radius vector of the planet.\n\nParallax; Horizontal Parallax and Parallax in Altitude; Parallax of a Place\n\n19. Fig. 5 will serve for the explanation of what astronomers mean by the word parallax. Let ABD represent the meridian circle of a place of observation, A; C the centre of the earth; let H J be a part of the infinitely distant sphere of the heavens; finally, let the moon be at M. The line HCD represents the true horizon, aAa′ the apparent horizon of the place, A. If the moon be supposed to stand in the horizon at M, it will be referred by an observer at A to that part of the celestial sphere occupied by the star a. From the centre of the earth it would be referred in the direction CM to the celestial sphere at b. The angle AMC, or aMb, will represent the difference of the two directions; and this angle, AMC, is called the parallax of the point M, or its horizontal parallax, since M is situated in the horizon. Let the moon now stand higher in the heavens, as at M′, then from A she will be seen in the direction AM′c, consequently referred to the point c of the heavens; and from C, the centre of the earth, in the direction CM′d, referred consequently to the celestial sphere at d. The angle CM′A = cM′d will be the difference of the two directions CM′ and AM′; and CM′A will be the parallax of M ', more definitely its parallax in altitude, because M′ is situated a certain distance above the horizon. Let the moon now be situated at M″, or in the direction of the zenith, e, of A, then the moon, M″, will be referred to the heavens at e; the two lines of sight will coincide, and they will form no angle, so that for heavenly bodies situated in the direction of the zenith, the parallax in altitude vanishes or becomes zero. We find, also, by examining the figure that the parallax is at its maximum in the horizon, diminishing with the angle of elevation until in the zenith it is zero.\n\nSuppose now a second place of observation, E, lying in the same meridian, and the moon to be situated at M′; then from A she will be seen in the direction AM′c, consequently referred to c, and from E in the direction EM′d′, and referred to d′. The angle EM′A gives the difference of the two directions EM′. AM′. This angle EM′A, or the corresponding arc cd′, is called the local parallax of the star at M′ for the two places A and E. Hence it is clear, that for the same altitude of the same star, its local parallax will be less as the distance of the two places of observation on the same meridian is less.\n\nThe Heliocentric and Geocentric place of the Planets; their Commutation and Annual Parallax\n\n20. The motions exhibited by the planets are not so simple as the apparent daily motions of the fixed stars, as above considered. This results from the fact of their having two motions, of which one is diurnal, in common with the fixed stars, from east to west, and the other an orbitual motion from west to east. Add to this, that the planets are not, like the fixed stars, almost infinitely distant from us, and that therefore it makes a material difference whether their revolutions be observed from the sun or the earth. The place of a planet, as seen from the sun, is called its heliocentric place; its position as seen from the earth, is the geocentric place. Fig. 14, pl. 6, is intended to illustrate these terms. Let S be the centre of the sun, the circle described through T the orbit of the earth, that through P the orbit of any superior planet, and the extreme circle, the ecliptic; the exterior and interior circles lying, of course, in the same plane, which may be the plane of the paper. Furthermore, let the earth be at T, the planet at P, and let âï¸ be the vernal equinox. The arrows give the direction of the motions of the earth and planet, as also the order of the signs of the ecliptic. The planet P will now be seen from the sun, S, in the direction Sp; the angle âï¸Sp, or the arc âï¸p, will consequently be the heliocentric longitude of the planet, and the angle âï¸ST, or the arc âï¸t, the heliocentric longitude, of the earth. From the earth T, the planet P will evidently be seen in the direction Tp′. It is further allowable, on account of the almost infinite distance of the fixed stars, to consider the line TA parallel to Sâï¸ as meeting in the same point of the celestial sphere, and consequently A and âï¸ as coinciding. The angle ATp′ then, or the arc âï¸p′, is the geocentric longitude of the planet; and since the plane of the planet at P has a certain inclination to the common plane of the inner and outer circles, the angle PSQ, or the arc PQ, will represent the heliocentric latitude of the planet, if the arc PQ be supposed drawn from the planet P, perpendicular to the plane of the earth’s orbit. Finally, the angle PTQ will be the geocentric latitude of the planet. The angle PTS, at the earth, will be the elongation of the planet, or its apparent angular distance from the sun, this elongation being (pl. 6, fig. 14) equal to the heliocentric longitude of the earth, + 180°, diminished by the geocentric longitude of the planet. From the preceding it follows that p will be the heliocentric, and p′ the geocentric place of the planet, with respect to the ecliptic. We can speak in the same manner of the heliocentric and geocentric position of a planet with respect to the equator, and consequently of the heliocentric and geocentric right ascension and declination.\n\nWe have still to speak of the commutation and the annual parallax of a planet. The commutation is the angle PST (fig. 14), at the sun, S, obtained by deducting the heliocentric longitude of the earth from the heliocentric longitude of the planet. The annual parallax is the angle TPS, at the planet P, obtained by deducting the heliocentric longitude of the planet from its geocentric longitude. It is very evident that we can never speak of the geocentric place of the earth.\n\nSome other Important Elements in the Theory of the Planetary Motions\n\n21. The mean anomaly, the true anomaly, the perihelion distance, and the aphelion distance, are far more important to the theory of the planetary motions than the commutation and the annual parallax. If, for instance, m (fig. 15) be the mean place of a planet, p the true place, then rays, Sm, Sp, from the sun to these two positions will form, with respect to the major axis AP, of the elliptical planetary orbit, the angles mSP′, pSP, which are respectively called the mean and the true anomaly of the planet. Their great importance consists in this, that the mean anomaly expresses the uniform or the mean motion in the circle, while the true anomaly expresses the true motion in the ellipse. The true anomaly, or the angle PSp, consists of two parts, angles mSP′ and mSp. This latter angle, mSp. however, which evidently is the difference between the true and mean motions of the planet, is called the equation of the orbit, and is one of the most essential elements in the theory of the planetary motions. For, knowing the equation of the orbit, the sum of the mean anomaly and the equation of the orbit gives the true anomaly, and consequently the true—that is, the elliptic longitude of a planet in its orbit. In conclusion, P is the perihelion and A the aphelion of the planet, in which points it will be respectively at its least and greatest distances from the sun.\n\nEclipses of the Sun and Moon\n\n22. We come now to eclipses of the sun and moon (pl. 6, fig. 18). The full moon at times loses gradually its light in a manner just as if a blackish grey disk were drawn slowly over its face, moving from left to right, and passing off on the opposite side. An eclipse of the moon is then said to take place, which, as it only occurs when the moon is full, and, indeed, when the full moon is in or near the straight line connecting the centres of the sun and earth, is of easy explanation. The earth, as an opake globe illuminated by the sun, must throw a shadow into space on the side opposite to the sun, this shadow being conical, and longer than the distance of the moon from the earth. The moon must also, as a body likewise illuminated by the sun, lose partly or entirely her light by passing partly or entirely into the shadow of the earth. If the moon’s orbit lay in the plane of the ecliptic, it is clear that an eclipse would occur at every full moon, which experience shows not to be the case. We learn above, section 8, that the path of the moon is inclined 5° 8′ 48″ to the ecliptic; the full moon passes for the most part, therefore, above or below the earth’s shadow, and it is only when the full moon happens in or near one of the moon’s nodes, that the moon can encounter the earth’s shadow. As the moon’s nodes do not remain in the same part of the ecliptic, it is very evident that the eclipses of the moon (and sun) must take place in different years and months, so that definite periods arise, after whose lapse the eclipses again occur in the same months.\n\nAstronomy teaches the conditions necessary for the occurrence of an eclipse. Should the full moon be situated at a distance from one of its nodes of less than 12\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)°, the moon may be partially eclipsed. Should the distance be less than 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)°, and greater than 5\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)°, a partial eclipse must take place. The eclipse will be total, that is, the moon will be entirely obscured, when the full moon takes place at less than 5\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)° from one of the nodes. A merely partial eclipse of the moon cannot last more than 2 hours and 18 minutes; the time of a partial, and at the same time total eclipse, may amount to 4 hours and 24 minutes. Astronomers are accustomed to determine beforehand the particular circumstances of an eclipse of the moon, as the beginning, the middle, and the end of the obscuration, the countries in which it will be visible, as well as the size of the eclipsed portion. The latter is given in digits (1 digit = \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) of the diameter of the disk). Unfortunately, however, the period of beginning and ending of an eclipse cannot be exactly determined, as the earth’s shadow falling on the moon (pl. 6, fig. 18), like any other shadow, is not bounded by sharp outlines, but fades off into light, and in every eclipse there is also distinguished a full shadow or umbra, and a half shadow or penumbra. From the preceding it is clear that an eclipse of the moon is not merely an apparent, but a real occurrence. Consequently, the inhabitants of all those portions of the earth in which the moon shines at the time of the eclipse, see every particular of the eclipse in the same manner and at the same time, even if the local times of the places should be different.\n\nSometimes a black disk is seen to pass gradually from right to left before the sun. But as this phenomenon is not seen alike at all places above whose horizon the sun may be at the time, since in some countries the sun is covered more or less than in others, or not at all, it is evident that this phenomenon cannot be the result of an actual obscuration of the sun. It is rather produced by the moon (pl. 6, fig. 18, and pl. 14, fig. 56), since it only happens at the time of new moon. It has been observed that these uncommon phenomena, called eclipses of the sun, occur only when the new moon happens to be in or near one of its nodes. By its intervention between the earth and sun, it then hides the view of the latter entirely or partly from the former. The phenomenon exhibited, is precisely as if the sun in a cloudless sky were covered for a time by a little black cloud passing over his disk. As the shadow of the cloud moves along in the plain beneath, in the direction in which the cloud is driven by the wind, and conceals from the observer whom it overtakes the sight of the sun, while others out of the bounds of the shadow still see that luminary; just so the shadow of the moon moves along over the earth’s surface from west to east in the direction of the moon’s motion around the earth, conceals from the countries traversed by it the view of the sun, and produces the phenomenon of eclipse. All regions not thus traversed see the sun as usual.\n\nEclipses of the sun are distinguished into partial, total, central, and annular. An eclipse is partial, when the moon covers the sun only in part; total, when this covering is complete. When the moon’s disk is apparently smaller than that of the sun and stands directly before him, the eclipse is annular. A total or annular eclipse is central when the centres of the sun and moon’s disk coincide. For the entire earth’s surface, a partial eclipse can last about 7 hours; one, partial and total, 4 hours and 48 minutes; but for a given place on the earth’s surface, a total eclipse cannot continue more than 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) hours at the very utmost. The calculation of the separate circumstances of an eclipse of the sun becomes, therefore, more difficult and circumstantial than those of the moon, since, as before mentioned, the former are not actual occurrences like the latter, but only apparent phenomena, whose shape, size, and duration depend upon the place of the observer on the earth’s surface.\n\nAn eclipse of the sun cannot take place when the new moon is more than 1° 35′ distant north or south of the ecliptic: 1° 24′ is the minimum distance that the moon can pass near the sun without causing an eclipse. A north or south latitude of the moon less than 1° 24′ at time of new moon always produces an eclipse of the sun, whose extent, as in the case of the lunar eclipses, is given in digits (12 digits = diameter of the sun’s disk). Hence it follows that the limits of possible occurrence of eclipses are much more extended in the case of the sun than in that of the moon. Consequently it follows that, for the whole surface of the earth, the former are much more frequent than the latter, for on an average there may happen within 18 years 41 eclipses of the sun and only about 29 of the moon. At least two eclipses of the sun must occur annually, because the sun every six months comes in the neighborhood of the moon’s ascending or descending node; while eclipses of the moon may be wanting for an entire year. But for any particular place on the surface of the earth, as, for instance, Leipzig, the visible eclipses of the moon are thrice as numerous as those of the sun. It may be assumed that every part of the earth’s surface may expect a partial eclipse of the sun within every two years, and a total within 200. Sometimes, though but rarely, the number of solar and lunar eclipses for the entire earth may amount to seven in a year, occurring then in January, July, and December.\n\nBy the actual observation of a solar eclipse, its beginning and end can be determined much more accurately than the same circumstances of a lunar eclipse. For this reason observations on the former are much more certain assistants in determining geographical longitude.\n\nThe course and extent of the moon’s shadow over the surface of the earth during a total or annular eclipse of the sun is shown by fig. 56, pl. 14. It represents also the manner in which the principal circumstances of such a phenomenon are usually delineated on a map.\n\nThe Planetary Systems of Ptolemy, Copernicus, Tycho, and the Egyptians. Tabular Exhibition of the Most Important Features of our Planetary System.\n\n23. By a planetary system, the ancients understood the disposition and course of seven planets with respect to our earth. Since the time of Copernicus, however, by the solar system, in the ordinary acceptance of the term, is meant the disposition and mutual arrangement of 14 primary and 19 secondary planets about our sun, which system is commonly termed the Copernican. By a solar system, taken generally, is understood any fixed star of the heavens, as a sun, with the spheres revolving about it as planets. Since astronomy has been pursued as a science, four planetary systems have had the greatest share of attention, being, in order of time, that of Ptolemy, the Egyptians, Copernicus, and Tycho.\n\nAccording to Ptolemy (an astronomer of Alexandria, living about a.d. 150), the earth (pl. 7, fig. 1) stands immovably in the centre of 12 circles. From the earth outwards the seven first circles represent the paths of the following bodies as planets, and in the following order:—the Moon; Mercury; Venus; the Sun; Mars; Jupiter; and Saturn. The eighth circle, e, represents the path of the fixed stars; the ninth, d, and tenth, c, called the first and second crystal heavens, were intended to serve in explaining the phenomena produced by precession (precession of the equinoxes); the eleventh circle, b, called primum mobile, was supposed to carry along the ten circles inclosed by it, in its daily rotation from east to west, while each planet traverses its ascribed path from west to east about the earth; the twelfth and last circle, a, Ptolemy indicated by the name of Empyrseum, or the abode of spirits and the blessed. This Ptolemaic system explains the heavenly appearances only imperfectly, provides in no way for the varying distances of the planets, and is, on the whole, very unnatural; it endured, however, with little change until the time of Copernicus.\n\nCertain of the Egyptian astronomers easily perceived that the arrangement of the orbits of Venus and Mercury, according to Ptolemy, could not be the true one, since it could not explain the superior conjunctions of these two planets. They, therefore, allowed the moon, and then the sun, to revolve (pl. 7, fig. 2) round the earth, but supposed Venus and Mercury to revolve round the sun in minor orbits, accompanying it in its revolution round the earth. Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn moved in great circles about the earth, as in the Ptolemaic system. This system, termed the Egyptian, is as false as the Ptolemaic, and could not be maintained so long in authority. It was reserved for the great Copernicus (1472–1543) to teach the world the true theory of the arrangement of the primary and secondary planets, afterwards confirmed by the laws of Kepler, and the discovery by Newton of the law of universal gravitation. According to this theory the sun â is a fixed star, occupying the centre of as many circular orbits as there are primary planets. These latter occur in the following order from the sun; Mercury â¿, Venus â, Earth â, Mars â, Jupiter â, Saturn â; the Moon â½ï¸, a secondary planet, revolves about the earth, and with it around the sun. All these motions take place in the direction from west to east (shown by the direction of the arrows, fig. 5).\n\nTycho de Brahe, who lived in the second half of the sixteenth century, certainly recognised the correctness of the Copernican system at an early period, but his ambitious vanity, and perhaps still more his religious prejudices, urged him to oppose it. In Tycho’s opinion the earth could not move around the sun, because the Bible would be thereby falsified. He preferred to represent the earth (fig. 3), like the earlier theorists, as placed immovably in the centre of the universe, the moon revolving round it first, and then the sun; around which latter the other planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, revolve as their centre. This system of Tycho, however, could not longer maintain any stand when the true Copernican system had been discovered. The Copernican system received a very essential confirmation by Kepler, who showed that the planets revolve in orbits that are ellipses, but which differ very little from circles, the sun being situated in one focus common to all (pl. 10, fig. 2). This is also approximately exhibited in pl. 7, fig. 5, by the eccentric position of the circular planetary orbits.\n\nSince the invention of the telescope, the following primary and secondary planets have been discovered as members of our solar system; the four moons of Jupiter, the ring and seven satellites of Saturn, the planet Uranus â (March 13, 1781, by Herschel), his six moons also by Herschel, Ceres (Jan. 1, 1801, by Piazzi), Pallas (March 28, 1802, by Olbers), Juno (Sept. 1, 1804, by Harding), Vesta (also by Olbers, March 29, 1807), Astræa (Dec. 8, 1845, by Henke), Neptune â, his ring and moon (Sept. 23, 1846, by Galle), and the planet provisionally called Iris (July 1, 1847, by Henke). The orbits of all these planets and moons, except Astræa, Iris, and Neptune, are represented on pl. 7, fig. 5, upon which are represented also the orbits of Halley’s Comet 1759, 1835, and of the great comet of 1811, as well as that of Encke. The outer circle of the figure represents the ecliptic with its division into the 12 signs, and on it are indicated by corresponding signs, in what parts to look for the following points:—the ascending node, â, of the great comet of 1811; the aphelion of Mars; the aphelion of Jupiter; the descending node, â, of Mars; the aphelion of Juno; the perihelion of Vesta; the descending nodes of Mars and Venus; the aphelion of Saturn; the descending node of Jupiter; the aphelion of the Earth; the descending node of Saturn; the aphelion of Pallas and Venus; the descending node of the Comet of 1811, and the aphelion of Ceres. In addition to these are given the proportional diameters for the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.\n\n24. Since the planets move slower in their orbits as their distance from the sun is greater, fig. 6, pl. 7, is intended to exhibit the relative velocity of these motions. When Mercury, the planet nearest to the sun, has completed an entire revolution in 360°, Venus in the same time describes an arc of 141° 22′, the Earth an arc of 86° 44′, &c. The proportionate velocities of the recently discovered planet Astraea (between Vesta and Juno) and Neptune (almost twice the distance of Uranus from the sun) could not well be represented in the figure. Astræa, if introduced into the preceding comparison, would describe an arc of about 21°, and Neptune one of about 20′. From the measurement of these various axes, it results, that Venus moves 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), the Earth 4, Mars 8 times slower than Mercury. Fig. 7 represents the inclinations of all the planetary orbits (except those of Astræa, Iris, and Neptune) to the plane of the ecliptic or the earth’s orbit.\n\n25. We shall now present a tabular view of the most important elements of our planetary system, principally with regard to those points which could not be represented on pl. 7, without affecting the distinctness of the figures. The estimates are given in English geographical miles, according to the most recent observations and calculations. The different values ascribed to Neptune may possibly require rectification whenever his elements are better known than they can be now.\n\nDistance, Period of Revolution, and Eccentricity of the Planets Planets Mean distance from the Sun Eccentricity Sidereal period in mean solar days and Julian years Mercury 32,000,000 6,580,000 87d 23h 15′ 36″ Venus 65,392,000 412,000 224d 16h 49′ 7″ Earth 82,664,000 1,388,000 365d 5h 9′ 10″ 7&tprime; Mars 125,956,000 11,740,000 1y 321d 17h 30′ 41″ Vesta 195,212,000 17,296,000 3y 229d 17h 38′ 0″ Astræa 212,64,000 18,706,000 4y 49d 6h 8′ 50″ Juno 220,672,000 56,400,000 4y 132d 1h 36′ 0″ Ceres 229,052,000 17,564,000 4y 223d 17h 38′ 0″ Pallas 229,192,000 55,468,000 4y 225d 7h 19′ 0″ Jupiter 430,084,000 20,732,000 11y 314d 20h 2′ 7″ Saturn 788,516,000 44,232,000 29y 166d 23h 16′ 32″ Uranus 1,185,692,000 73,892,000 84y 5′d 19h 41′ 36″ Neptune 2,900,584,000 25,524,000 167\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nRotation, Light, Gravitation, Density, &c., of Planets Planets Mass\n\nThe Sun = 1 Density\n\nEarth = 1 Gravitation\n\nEarth = 1 Light & Warmth\n\nEarth = 1 Rotation in Mean Solar Time Mercury 1.2025810 2.94 1.15 6.67 1d 0h 5′ Venus 1.401847 0.92 0.91 1.91 0d 23h 21′ Earth 1.354936 1.00 1.00 1.00 0d 23h 56.1′ Mars 1.2680337 0.96 0.50 0.43 1d 0h 37.3′ Jupiter 1.1054 0.24 2.69 0.037 0d 9h 55.5′ Saturn 1.3500 0.14 1.26 0.011 0d 10h 29.3′ Uranus 1.17918 0.24 1.05 0.003\n\nSurfaces and Volumes of the Planets in Geographical Miles Planets Surfaces in Square Miles Volumes in Thousands of Cubic Miles Mercury 22,272,000 10,210,816 Venus 144,048,000 163,373,248 Earth 148,512,000 170,180,672 Mars 40,096,000 23,825,280 Vesta 148,500 832 Juno 4,448,000 850,880 Ceres 5,936,000 1,361,472 Jupiter 18,710,496,000 230,635,198,720 Saturn 12,088,880,000 124,082,652,800 Uranus 2,802,416,000 13,954,799,360 Sun 1,865,312,000,000 239,460,953,480,000 Moon 10,350,400 3,024,812\n\nVelocity and Fall of the Planetary Orbits; their position with respect to the Sun’s Equator Planets Mean Velocity in a Second Fall towards the Sun in a Second Right Ascension of the Eternal Node of the Orbit Mercury 26.8 Eng miles 8.46 316° 51′ Venus 19.6 Eng miles 2.42 242° 45′ Earth 16.4 Eng miles 1.27 248° 0′ Mars 13.6 Eng miles 0.55 254° 21′ Vesta 10.8 Eng miles 0.20 180° 33′ Juno 10.4 Eng miles 0.20 197° 3′ Ceres 10.0 Eng miles 0.20 208° 43′ Pallas 10.0 Eng miles 0.20 182° 19′ Jupiter 6.8 Eng miles 0.047 242° 5′ Saturn 5.2 Eng miles 0.014 231° 12′ Uranus 4.0 Eng miles 0.003 247° 30′ Neptune 2.8 Eng miles\n\nInclination and Motion of the Planetary Orbits Planets Inclination of the Orbit to the Sun’s Equator Arc of the Retrograde Motion Duration of the Retrograde Motion Mercury 2° 54′ 8° 33′ 16° 18′ 20 and 24 days Venus 4° 9′ 15° 20′ 16° 31′ 41 and 43 days Earth 7° 30′ Mars 5° 50′ 11° 8′ 19° 30′ 62 and 81 days Vesta 4° 28′ Juno 16° 28′ Ceres 3° 43′ Pallas 37° 8′ Jupiter 6° 24′ 10° 0′ 119 days Saturn 5° 57′ 6° 48′ 137 days Uranus 6° 44′ 3° 36′ 151 days\n\nThe most important items respecting the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, will be found further on, principally in section 33. Sections 30 and 31 will contain the principal points in the history of our moon.\n\n26. The central figure on pl. 8 is intended to exhibit clearly, with many other phenomena, the annual revolution of the earth about the sun; nevertheless, for the better knowledge of the whole subject, it will be necessary to premise a few general observations. It is. in the first place, evident that bodies cannot themselves change their condition, and that thus a body once set in motion can never stop—that it will continue to move in the same direction and with the same velocity as when it set out, unless some other external force changes its direction or velocity. This peculiarity of bodies is called inertia. It is, moreover, evident, by reference to what is said, sec. 46, of the parallelogram of forces, that if the paths of the planets, and consequently of the earth, also be ellipses about the sun, two forces must combine to their production. The one is the attractive force of the sun, varying with the distances; the other a continuous tangential force, originating in an impulse. Pl. 10, fig. 2, will show how an elliptical orbit for each planet is produced by the co-operation of these two forces. We have to remark, finally, that gravitation communicates to all freely falling bodies a tendency towards the centre of the earth.\n\nWe will now direct our attention to the orbit of the earth, with the help of the figure in pl. 8, representing its motions. By measuring the distances of the earth from the sun, at different times of the year, the shape of its orbit has been ascertained. These distances, as they were unequal, could not, of course, be semi-diameters of a circle, but they corresponded, taken together, to the radii vectores of an ellipse (pl. 10, fig. 2). The mean distance of the earth from the sun, is about 95,103,000 (statute) miles; it moves in its orbit at the average rate of 16\\(\\frac{4}{10}\\) (Eng. geog.) miles in a second; the eccentricity of its orbit amounts to 0,016,784; the least or perihelion distance from the sun, to 81,276,000 (Eng. geog.) miles, or 33,917,997 hours; while the greatest or aphelion distance is 84,052,000 (Eng. geog.) miles, or 35,085,379 hours. The straight line connecting the perihelion and aphelion, passing through the centre of the sun, is called the line of apsides. The inclination of the earth’s orbit to its equator, or the so-called obliquity of the ecliptic, amounts to 23° 27′. The velocity of the earth is greatest at the perihelion and least at the aphelion. It is further to be observed, that the mean distance of the earth from the sun is equal to half the major axis of the earth’s orbit, and the line of apsides is itself the major axis. There are four noteworthy points in the earth’s orbit; they are those which mark the beginning of the four seasons. Two of these points are called the solstices—they mark the beginning of winter and summer. The straight line (pl. 8) uniting them, passing through the centre of the sun, is called the solstitial colure. The two other points are the equinoxes, vernal and autumnal, marking the commencement of spring and autumn. The straight line connecting these points, passing through the centre of the sun, is the equinoctial colure. It still remains to observe, that the axis of the earth being always parallel to the axis of the heavens, may also be conceived to coincide with it; for, in consequence of the great distance of the fixed stars from our sun, the diameter of the earth’s orbit (of more than 190,000,000 [statute] miles), as well as the whole orbit itself, would be seen as a mere point at the stars.\n\nThe representation on pl. 8, shows the position of the earth on the first day of each of the twelve months of the year, the solar distances corresponding to these twelve positions, and the shape of the earth’s orbit. The horizontal projection has been chosen, in order to represent to the eye the increase and diminution of days, and the variation of illumination about the pole of the earth. The deeper circle surrounding the pole at a short distance, is intended to represent the parallel of latitude of Paris, or the hour circle of that place divided into twenty-four hours. Although at the end of December the earth is nearest the sun, yet at that time in the northern hemisphere, the heat is less than at any other. The reason of this lies in the fact of the short days and long nights, as well as that the sun’s rays fall very obliquely on the earth, traversing a longer path through the atmosphere, and consequently losing much of their heating power. At the beginning of July, on the contrary, although then the earth is at its greatest distance, the temperature of the northern hemisphere is greatest, on account of the long days and short nights, and the great altitude of the sun at noon. This, of course, depends upon the declination of the sun north or south from the equator. This declination of the sun for the first day of every month, is given in pl. 8. The great inner circle contains the division of the year into days and months, and enables us, by drawing a straight line to any point of this circle, to find the situation of the earth on the day corresponding to the point. The external circle, on the contrary, is divided into twelve equal arcs, of which each one answers to a sign (30 degrees) of the ecliptic. It must not be forgotten, however, that owing to the precession of the equinoxes, these signs no longer correspond to the constellations of the same name, so that now the sign Pisces corresponds to the constellation Aries, the sign Aries to the constellation Taurus, &c. It is further evident from an inspection of the plate, that if the earth at the beginning of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, should be in the signs Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricornus respectively, then the sun, as being always directly opposite in the ecliptic, will be in the signs Libra, Capricornus, Aries, and Cancer.\n\nBy properly combining the preceding with sections 27, 28, which are devoted principally to an explanation of the theory of the seasons, and particularly of the daily and yearly motion of the sun, it will not be difficult to obtain a perfect idea of all the phenomena occurring in the course of a year, over the whole surface of the earth. On account of the great importance of this subject, it may be remarked further, that the changes of days and nights, as also of the seasons, may be very easily represented by means of a Tellurium, or by means of a terrestrial globe, with a little simple additional mechanism.\n\nThe inner space of pl. 8, is employed to represent the orbits of the two inferior planets, Mercury and Venus, in their proportional size, shape, and eccentricity. The accompanying figures are readily intelligible without further explanation.\n\n27. The sun is stationary! It is incredible that so enormous a body as the sun should have three different motions at the same time. Accurate observations have shown that the earth moves about its axis from west to east, once every day, by means of which the daily apparent motion of the heavens, as well as of the sun, from east to west is produced. It is further- more only apparently, not really, that the sun in the course of a year moves around the earth from west to east in an ellipse termed the ecliptic (pl. 9, fig. 3, LCD), making an angle with the equator of 23° 27′. This inclination, termed the obliquity of the ecliptic, combined with the revolution of the earth, explains the apparent motion of the sun. both towards the north and towards the south. If, for instance, we suppose the sun on June 21st to have reached the point L, it is evident that while the earth rotates about her axis, ax, from west to east, or in the direction from Q to U, it will seem as if the sun in the same time, but from east to west, had described the parallel circle, VOLV (or the tropic of Cancer), about the earth; where the sun is at R, he will appear to describe the equator CRFC; and on December 21st, the tropic of Capricorn or the circle DHMD. The planes of the equator and tropics intersect the earth in circles, which are respectively the terrestrial equator and the terrestrial tropics. It is further to be observed that the poles, N, K, of the ecliptic, during the apparent daily rotation of the heavens, describe two small circles, of which the northern, AN, is called the arctic, the southern, BK, the antarctic. The polar circles of the earth corresponding to these are u, y, and k, b.\n\nThe rotation of the earth on its axis, and the inclination of the ecliptic to the equator, explain without any difficulty the inequality of days and nights, and the succession of the seasons. For when the sun on the 21st June traverses the tropic of Cancer, he remains much longer above the horizon zz than when describing the tropic of Capricorn on Dec. 21. In this latter case we readily perceive that the sun remains much longer below the horizon, and that consequently the nights are much longer than on the 21st of June. It is further evident, that about the 20th of March and 23d of September, when the sun is on the equator, an equality of days and nights must take place. Figs. 1 and 3, pl. 9, also show that during the six months that the sun is north of the equator, spring and summer must take place in the northern hemisphere, autumn and winter in the southern; but during the six months that this luminary is south of the equator the case must be reversed, spring and summer now happening in the southern hemisphere, autumn and winter in the northern.\n\n28. All that has hitherto been said with regard to phenomena occurring in connexion with the earth, can only be explained by the assumption of a rotatory motion of the earth about an axis at the same time with a revolution about the sun in an elliptical orbit (pl. 9, fig. 1). The inequality of the seasons is a necessary consequence of the elliptic motion of the earth, and of the inclination of its axis of rotation to the plane of the ecliptic. If, for instance, the axis of rotation were perpendicular to the plane of th"
