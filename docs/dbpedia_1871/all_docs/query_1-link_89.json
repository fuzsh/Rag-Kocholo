Sextans B is 4.44 million light-years away from Earth and thus is one of the most distant members of the Local Group, if it is indeed a member. It forms a pair with its neighbouring galaxy Sextans A. It is a type Ir IV–V galaxy according to the galaxy morphological classification scheme. Sextans B may also be gravitationally associated with the galaxies NGC 3109 and the Antlia Dwarf.",

        "text": "Sextans B (also known as UGC 5373 and DDO 70) is an irregular galaxy that may be part of the Local Group, or lie just beyond it. Sextans B is 4.44 million light-years away from Earth and thus is one of the most distant members of the Local Group, if it is indeed a member. It forms a pair with its neighbouring galaxy Sextans A.[4] It is a type Ir IV–V galaxy according to the galaxy morphological classification scheme.[5] Sextans B may also be gravitationally associated with the galaxies NGC 3109 and the Antlia Dwarf.[6]\n\nSextans B has a uniform stellar population,[7] but the interstellar medium in it may be inhomogeneous.[8] Its mass is estimated to be about 2×10 8 times the mass of the Sun, of which 5.5×10 7 is in the form of atomic hydrogen.[7] Star formation in the galaxy seems to have proceeded in distinct periods of low intensity, separated by shorter periods of no activity.[7] The existence of Cepheid variables in the galaxy implies that Sextans B contains at least some young stars.[5] The metallicity of Sextans B is very low, with a value of approximately Z = 0.001.[7] Sextans B is receding from the Milky Way with a speed of approximately 300 kilometres per second (190 mi/s),[8] and probably lies just outside the edge of the Local Group, so as its neighbour Sextans A.[9]"
