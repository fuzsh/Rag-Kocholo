They have neither noticeable symmetry nor an obvious central nucleus, and they are generally bluer in colour than are the arms and disks of spiral galaxies. An extremely small number of them, however, are red and have a smooth, though nonsymmetrical, shape.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 22, 2024, 12:18 AM ET (New York Times)\n\nA ‘Speedy Little Star’ May Be on Course to Escape Our Galaxy\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 4:16 AM ET (Earth.com)\n\nGalaxies in clusters are bigger than those flying solo in the universe\n\nAug. 5, 2024, 7:12 AM ET (Sci.News)\n\nHubble Spots Supernova-Hosting Galaxy with Distorted Spiral Arms\n\nHubble recognized these two types of irregular galaxies, Irr I and Irr II. The Irr I type is the most common of the irregular systems, and it seems to fall naturally on an extension of the spiral classes, beyond Sc, into galaxies with no discernible spiral structure. They are blue, are highly resolved, and have little or no nucleus. The Irr II systems are red, rare objects. They include various kinds of chaotic galaxies for which there apparently are many different explanations, including most commonly the results of galaxy-galaxy interactions, both tidal distortions and cannibalism; therefore, this category is no longer seen as a useful way to classify galaxies.\n\nSome irregular galaxies, like spirals, are barred. They have a nearly central bar structure dominating an otherwise chaotic arrangement of material. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a well-known example.\n\nOther classification schemes and galaxy types\n\nOther classification schemes similar to Hubble’s follow his pattern but subdivide the galaxies differently. A notable example of one such system is that of de Vaucouleurs. This scheme, which has evolved considerably since its inception in 1959, includes a large number of codes for indicating different kinds of morphological characteristics visible in the images of galaxies (see the table). The major Hubble galaxy classes form the framework of de Vaucouleurs’s scheme, and its subdivision includes different families, varieties, and stages. The de Vaucouleurs system is so detailed that it is more of a descriptive code for galaxies than a commonly used classification scheme.\n\nde Vaucouleurs's classification of galaxies classes families varieties stages type ellipticals E elliptical (0–7) E0 intermediate E0-1 late elliptical E+ lenticulars S0 ordinary SA0 barred SB0 mixed SAB0 inner ring S(r)0 S-shaped S(s)0 mixed S(rs)0 early S0− intermediate S0° late S0+ spirals ordinary SA barred SB mixed SAB inner ring S(r) S-shaped S(s) mixed S(rs) 0/a S0/a a Sa ab Sab b Sb bc Sbc c Sc cd Scd d Sd dm Sdm m Sm irregulars ordinary IA barred IB mixed IAB S-shaped I(s) Magellanic Im non-Magellanic I0 peculiars P peculiarities (all types) peculiarity P uncertain : doubtful ? spindle sp outer ring (R) pseudo outer ring (R´)\n\nGalaxies with unusual properties often have shorthand names that refer to their characteristic properties. Common examples are\n\ncD: Galaxies with abnormally large, distended shapes, always found in the central areas of galaxy clusters and hypothesized to consist of merged galaxies.\n\nS: Seyfert galaxies, originally recognized by the American astronomer Carl K. Seyfert from optical spectra. These objects have very bright nuclei with strong emission lines of hydrogen and other common elements, showing velocities of hundreds or thousands of kilometres per second. Most are radio sources.\n\nN: Galaxies with small, very bright nuclei and strong radio emission. These are probably similar to Seyfert galaxies but more distant.\n\nQ: Quasars, or QSOs, small, extremely luminous objects, many of which are strong radio sources. Quasars apparently are related to Seyfert and N galaxies but have such bright nuclei that the underlying galaxy can be detected only with great difficulty.\n\nThere are also different schemes used for extremely distant galaxies, which we see in their youth. When a very distant galaxy is examined with a very large telescope, we see its structure as it was when the light was emitted billions of years ago. In such cases, the distinctive Hubble types are not so obvious. Apparently, galaxies are much less well organized in their early years, and these very distant objects tend to be highly irregular and asymmetrical. Although special classification schemes are sometimes used for special purposes, the general scheme of Hubble in its updated form is the one most commonly used."
