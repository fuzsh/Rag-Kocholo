        "text": "Sextans (pronounced ˈsɛkstənz) is the Latin name of a constellation situated close to the celestial equator. As such, it is at least partly visible from both hemispheres in certain times of the year.\n\nIn English language this constellation is also known as \"The Sextant\" while in astronomical texts and literature this constellation is often abbreviated as \"Sex\" (according to the standard of the International Astronomical Union - IAU) or as \"Sext\" (according to a naming convention used by NASA).\n\nThe Latin genitive of the constellation name is \"Sextantis\" (pronounced sɛksˈtæntɪs) and it is used to identify some of the brightest stars in this constellation based on the Bayer or Flamsteed star naming convention. For instance: α Sextantis (the brightest star of Sextans based on the Bayer catalog); or 23 Sextantis (the 23th star in the constellation of Sextans based on the Flamsteed catalog).\n\nAvailable Resources for Sextans\n\nSky Chart of Sextans Constellation\n\nHere we provide a simplified sky chart of the Sextans constellation. Alternatively it is possible to locate Sextans in the night sky using our Online Interactive Planetarium.\n\nVisibility of Sextans Constellation\n\nToday's Sextans rise, transit and set times from Greenwich, UK are the following (all times relative to the local timezone Europe/London):\n\nAzimuth: 93.0° RISE 8:14\n\nRIGHT NOW Sextans is above the horizon from Greenwich, UK\n\nThe rise and set times provided here are just directional indications and they refer to a point approximately placed at the center of the constellation. In case of very large constellations these times can have little relevance.\n\nBright Stars in Sextans Constellation\n\nThe table below lists the top 20 brightest stars in the Sextans constellation.
