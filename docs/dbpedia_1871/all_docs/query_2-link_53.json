China has maintained the longest continuous historical records of celestial phenomena in the world. Extraordinary or abnormal celestial events were particularly noted because of their astrological significance. The historical records cover various types of celestial phenomena, which include solar and lunar eclipses, sunspots, \"guest stars\" (novae or supernovae as we understand today), comets and meteors, and all kinds of planetary phenomena. These records provide valuable historical data for astronomical studies today.\n\nStar Watch: The Amateur Astronomer's Guide to Finding, Observing, and Learning about Over 125 Celestial Objects\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHarrington, Philip S.\n\n2003-07-01\n\nYour Passport to the Universe The night sky is alive with many wonders--distant planets, vast star clusters, glowing nebulae, and expansive galaxies, all waiting to be explored. Let respected astronomy writer Philip Harrington introduce you to the universe in Star Watch, a complete beginner's guide to locating, observing, and understanding these celestial objects.

In fact, all the real objects are radiate, but the strength of the radiation is different. Radiation will reduce the quality of the object, but time is not long enough to reduce the mass of the subject, so it is difficult for us to observe. Due to the large object lifecycle, to study the changing rule of the object, we must consider the radiation on the quality of the celestial bodies, and the outer space radiate particles' motion, also consider objects interact with objects of radiation. The reason Celestial bodies moves is that the radiation of those Celestial bodies Interact with each other, Celestial bodies macroscopic movement is due to the radiation. The earth's rotation and revolution is a measure of the survive ability.

L.; Johnston, H. M.\n\n2011-11-15\n\nWe present the results of spectroscopic observations of the optical counterparts of 47 southern radio sources from the candidate International Celestial Reference Catalogue as part of a very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) program to strengthen the celestial reference frame, especially in the south. We made the observations with the 3.58 m European Southern Observatory New Technology Telescope. We obtained redshifts for 30 quasars and one radio galaxy, with a further seven objects being probable BL Lac objects with featureless spectra. Of the remainder, four were clear misidentifications with Galactic stars and five had low signal-to-noise spectra and could not bemoreÂ Â» classified. These results, in combination with new VLBI data of the radio sources with redshifts more than 2, add significantly to the existing data needed to refine the distribution of source proper motions over the celestial sphere.Â«Â less\n\nQUIKVIS- CELESTIAL TARGET AVAILABILITY INFORMATION\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPetruzzo, C.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nQUIKVIS computes the times during an Earth orbit when geometric requirements are satisfied for observing celestial objects. The observed objects may be fixed (stars, etc.) or moving (sun, moon, planets). QUIKVIS is useful for preflight analysis by those needing information on the availability of celestial objects to be observed. Two types of analyses are performed by QUIKVIS. One is used when specific objects are known, the other when targets are unknown and potentially useful regions of the sky must be identified. The results are useful in selecting candidate targets, examining the effects of observation requirements, and doing gross assessments of the effects of the orbit's right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN). The results are not appropriate when high accuracy is needed (e.g. for scheduling actual mission operations). The observation duration is calculated as a function of date, orbit node, and geometric requirements. The orbit right ascension of the ascending node can be varied to account for the effects of an uncertain launch time of day. The orbit semimajor axis and inclination are constant throughout the run. A circular orbit is assumed, but a simple program modification will allow eccentric orbits. The geometric requirements that can be processed are: 1) minimum separation angle between the line of sight to the object and the earth's horizon; 2) minimum separation angle between the line of sight to the object and the spacecraft velocity vector; 3) maximum separation angle between the line of sight to the object and the zenith direction; and 4) presence of the spacecraft in the earth's shadow. The user must supply a date or date range, the spacecraft orbit and inclination, up to 700 observation targets, and any geometric requirements to be met. The primary output is the time per orbit that conditions are satisfied, with options for sky survey maps, time since a user-specified orbit event, and bar graphs illustrating overlapping requirements.

L.; Odegard, N.; Hill, R. S.\n\n2011-02-01\n\nWe present WMAP seven-year observations of bright sources which are often used as calibrators at microwave frequencies. Ten objects are studied in five frequency bands (23-94 GHz): the outer planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and five fixed celestial sources (Cas A, Tau A, Cyg A, 3C274, and 3C58). The seven-year analysis of Jupiter provides temperatures which are within 1{sigma} of the previously published WMAP five-year values, with slightly tighter constraints on variability with orbital phase (0.2% {+-} 0.4%), and limits (but no detections) on linear polarization. Observed temperatures for both Mars and Saturn vary significantly with viewing geometry.moreÂ Â» Scaling factors are provided which, when multiplied by the Wright Mars thermal model predictions at 350 {mu}m, reproduce WMAP seasonally averaged observations of Mars within {approx}2%. An empirical model is described which fits brightness variations of Saturn due to geometrical effects and can be used to predict the WMAP observations to within 3%. Seven-year mean temperatures for Uranus and Neptune are also tabulated. Uncertainties in Uranus temperatures are 3%-4% in the 41, 61, and 94 GHz bands; the smallest uncertainty for Neptune is 8% for the 94 GHz band. Intriguingly, the spectrum of Uranus appears to show a dip at {approx}30 GHz of unidentified origin, although the feature is not of high statistical significance. Flux densities for the five selected fixed celestial sources are derived from the seven-year WMAP sky maps and are tabulated for Stokes I, Q, and U, along with polarization fraction and position angle. Fractional uncertainties for the Stokes I fluxes are typically 1% to 3%. Source variability over the seven-year baseline is also estimated. Significant secular decrease is seen for Cas A and Tau A: our results are consistent with a frequency-independent decrease of about 0.53% per year for Cas A and 0.22% per year for Tau A. We present WMAP polarization data with\n\nCelestial mechanics - Methods of the theory of motion of 'artificial' celestial bodies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDuboshin, G. N.\n\nThis book is concerned with the translational motion of 'artificial' celestial bodies. The difference between natural celestial bodies, which are ordinarily considered by celestial mechanics, and 'artificial' celestial bodies is discussed, taking into account hypothetical celestial bodies introduced in connection with mathematical developments and problems, invisible celestial bodies whose existence can be assumed on the basis of some plausible hypothesis, and man-made satellites of the earth. The book consists of two parts. The first part presents introductory material, and examines a number of general mathematical questions to provide a basis for the studies conducted in the second part. Subjects considered in the first part are related to basic problems, integration methods, and perturbation theory. In the second part, attention is given to the motion of artificial celestial bodies in the gravitational field of the basic planet, external perturbations regarding the motion of these bodies, the motion of the bodies in the earth-moon system, and periodic solutions.\n\nFlow Visualization of Aircraft in Flight by Means of Background Oriented Schlieren Using Celestial Objects\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHill, Michael A.; Haering, Edward A., Jr.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Background Oriented Schlieren using Celestial Objects series of flights was undertaken in the spring of 2016 at National Aeronautics and Space Administration Armstrong Flight Research Center to further develop and improve a flow visualization technique which can be performed from the ground upon flying aircraft. Improved hardware and imaging techniques from previous schlieren tests were investigated. A United States Air Force T-38C and NASA B200 King Air aircraft were imaged eclipsing the sun at ranges varying from 2 to 6 nautical miles, at subsonic and supersonic speeds.\n\nDetermination of the observation conditions of celestial bodies with the aid of the DISPO system\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKazakov, R.

J.; Tesmer, V.; Titov, O.; Wang, G.; Zharov, V.\n\n2015-08-01\n\nWe present the second realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF2) at radio wavelengths using nearly 30 years of Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations. ICRF2 contains precise positions of 3414 compact radio astronomical objects and has a positional noise floor of â¼40 Î¼as and a directional stability of the frame axes of â¼10 Î¼as. A set of 295 new âdefiningâ sources was selected on the basis of positional stability and the lack of extensive intrinsic source structure. The positional stability of these 295 defining sources and their more uniform sky distribution eliminates the two greatest weaknesses of the first realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF1). Alignment of ICRF2 with the International Celestial Reference System was made using 138 positionally stable sources common to both ICRF2 and ICRF1. The resulting ICRF2 was adopted by the International Astronomical Union as the new fundamental celestial reference frame, replacing ICRF1 as of 2010 January 1.\n\nOPTICAL SPECTRA OF CANDIDATE INTERNATIONAL CELESTIAL REFERENCE FRAME (ICRF) FLAT-SPECTRUM RADIO SOURCES\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTitov, O.; Stanford, Laura M.; Johnston, Helen M.\n\n2013-07-01\n\nContinuing our program of spectroscopic observations of International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) sources, we present redshifts for 120 quasars and radio galaxies. Data were obtained with five telescopes: the 3.58 m European Southern Observatory New Technology Telescope, the two 8.2 m Gemini telescopes, the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), and the 6.0 m Big Azimuthal Telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory in Russia. The targets were selected from the International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry candidate International Celestial Reference Catalog which forms part of an observational very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) program to strengthen the celestial reference frame.moreÂ Â» We obtained spectra of the potential optical counterparts of more than 150 compact flat-spectrum radio sources, and measured redshifts of 120 emission-line objects, together with 19 BL Lac objects. These identifications add significantly to the precise radio-optical frame tie to be undertaken by Gaia, due to be launched in 2013, and to the existing data available for analyzing source proper motions over the celestial sphere. We show that the distribution of redshifts for ICRF sources is consistent with the much larger sample drawn from Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm (FIRST) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey, implying that the ultra-compact VLBI sources are not distinguished from the overall radio-loud quasar population. In addition, we obtained NOT spectra for five radio sources from the FIRST and NRAO VLA Sky Survey catalogs, selected on the basis of their red colors, which yielded three quasars with z > 4.Â«Â less\n\nSeven-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Planets and Celestial Calibration Sources\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWeiland, J.

A novel algorithm based on Kernel dense estimation and K-nearest neighborhoods (KNN) has been presented, and applied to search for rare and unusual celestial objects from 546 383 stellar spectra of SDSS DR8. Their densities are estimated using Gaussian kernel density estimation, the top 5 000 spectra in descend order by their densities are selected as rare objects, and the top 300 000 spectra in ascend order by their densities are selected as normal objects. Then, KNN were used to classify the rest objects, and simultaneously K nearest neighbors of the 5 000 rare spectra are also selected as rare objects. As a result, there are totally 21 193 spectra selected as initial rare spectra, which include error spectra caused by deletion, redden, bad calibration, spectra consisting of different physically irrelevant components, planetary nebulas, QSOs, special white dwarfs (DZ, DQ, DC), carbon stars, white dwarf main-sequence binaries (WDMS), cataclysmic variable (CV) stars and so on. By cross identification with SIMBAD, NED, ADS and major literature, it is found that three DZ white dwarfs, one WDMS, two CVs with company of G-type star, three CVs candidates, six DC white dwarfs, one DC white dwarf candidate and one BL Lacertae (BL lac) candidate are our new findings. We also have found one special DA white dwarf with emission lines of Ca II triple and Mg I, and one unknown object whose spectrum looks like a late M star with emission lines and its image looks like a galaxy or nebula.\n\nCelestial dynamics and astrometry in expanding universe\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKopeikin, Sergei\n\n2012-08-01\n\nPost - Newtonian theory of motion of celestial bodies and propagation of light was instrumental in conducting the critical experimental tests of general relativity and in building the astronomical ephemerides of celestial bodies in the solar system with an unparalleled precision. The cornerstone of the theory is the postulate that the solar system is gravitationally isolated from the rest of the universe and the background spacetime is asymptotically flat. The present talk abolishes this postulate and lays down the principles of celestial dynamics of particles and light moving in gravitational field of a localized astronomical system embedded to the expanding universe. We formulate the precise mathematical concept of the Newtonian limit of Einstein âs field equations in the conformally - flat spacetime and analyse the geodesic equations of motion o f particles and light in this limit. We demonstrate that the equations of motion of particles and light can be reduced to their Newtonian counterparts by doing conformal transformations of time and space coordinates. However, the Newtonian equations for particles and light differ by terms of the first order in the Hubble constant. This leads to the important conclusion that the equations of motion used currently by Space Navigation Centres and Astronomical Observatories for calculating orbits of celestial bodies, are incomplete and missing some terms of cosmological origin. We explicitly identify the missing terms and demonstrate that they bring about a noticeable discrepancy between the observed and calculated astronomical ephemerides. We argue that a number of observed celestial anomalies in the solar system can be explained as caused by the Hubble expansion of the universe.\n\nCelestial Navigation for High School Students.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBell, Carroll Wilson\n\nReported is a study of a syllabus designed to teach students how to determine a position by celestial means.

Such false targets are particularly significant for the detection of weak target signatures which only have a small relative angular motion. The detection of celestial features is well established in the visible spectral band. However, given the increasing sensitivity and low noise afforded by emergent infrared focal plane array technology together with larger and more efficient optics, the signatures of celestial features can also impact performance at infrared wavelengths. A methodology has been developed which allows the rapid generation of celestial signatures in any required spectral band using star data from star catalogues and other open-source information. Within this paper, the radiometric calculations are presented to determine the irradiance values of stars and planets in any spectral band.\n\nScheduling Observations of Celestial Objects for Earth Observing Sensor Calibration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWilson, Truman; Xiong, Xiaoxiong\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRadiometric calibration of Earth-observing satellite sensors is critical for tracking on-orbit gain changes through- out the satellite's mission. The Moon, being a stable, well-characterized radiometric target, has been used effectively for tracking the relative gain changes of the reflective solar bands for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board EOS AM-1 (Terra) and PM-1 (Aqua). The Moon is viewed through the MODIS space-view port, and the relative phase of the Moon is restricted to within 0.5 degrees of a chosen target phase to increase the accuracy of the calibration. These geometric restrictions require spacecraft maneuvers in order to bring space-view port into proper alignment with the position of the Moon when the phase requirement is met. In this paper, we describe a versatile tool for scheduling such maneuvers based on the required geometry and lunar phase restrictions for a general spacecraft bound instrument. The results of the scheduling tool have been verified using lunar images from Aqua and Terra MODIS after a scheduled roll maneuver was performed. This tool has also been tested for the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder on-board the Suomi-NPP spacecraft. As an extension of this work, we have also developed a tool for scheduling views of bright stars. These stars provide another well-characterized radiometric source that can be used for sensor calibration. This tool has been implemented to determine the times in which a chosen star can be viewed by the high gain stages of the day/night band for the VIIRS instrument.\n\nCelestial Object Imaging Model and Parameter Optimization for an Optical Navigation Sensor Based on the Well Capacity Adjusting Scheme.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Hao; Jiang, Jie; Zhang, Guangjun\n\n2017-04-21\n\nThe simultaneous extraction of optical navigation measurements from a target celestial body and star images is essential for autonomous optical navigation. Generally, a single optical navigation sensor cannot simultaneously image the target celestial body and stars well-exposed because their irradiance difference is generally large. Multi-sensor integration or complex image processing algorithms are commonly utilized to solve the said problem. This study analyzes and demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneously imaging the target celestial body and stars well-exposed within a single exposure through a single field of view (FOV) optical navigation sensor using the well capacity adjusting (WCA) scheme. First, the irradiance characteristics of the celestial body are analyzed. Then, the celestial body edge model and star spot imaging model are established when the WCA scheme is applied. Furthermore, the effect of exposure parameters on the accuracy of star centroiding and edge extraction is analyzed using the proposed model. Optimal exposure parameters are also derived by conducting Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the best performance of the navigation sensor. Finally, laboratorial and night sky experiments are performed to validate the correctness of the proposed model and optimal exposure parameters.\n\nCelestial Object Imaging Model and Parameter Optimization for an Optical Navigation Sensor Based on the Well Capacity Adjusting Scheme\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Hao; Jiang, Jie; Zhang, Guangjun\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe simultaneous extraction of optical navigation measurements from a target celestial body and star images is essential for autonomous optical navigation.

Filled with 380 full-color illustrations, Celestial Treasury shows the influence of astronomical theories and the richness of illustrations in Western civilization through the ages. The authors explore the evolution of our understanding of astronomy and weave together ancient and modern theories in a fascinating narrative. They incorporate a wealth of detail from Greek verse, medieval manuscripts and Victorian poetry with contemporary spacecraft photographs and computer-generated star charts. Celestial Treasury is more than a beautiful book: it answers a variety of questions that have intrigued scientists and laymen for centuries. -- How did philosophers and scientists try to explain the order that governs celestial motion? -- How did geometers and artists measure and map the skies? -- How many different answers have been proposed for the most fundamental of all questions: When and how did Earth come about? -- Who inhabits the heavens--gods, angels or extraterrestrials? No other book recounts humankind's fascination with the heavens as compellingly as Celestial Treasury.

Kenneth; Richardson, David.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThis volume contains papers presented at the US/European Celestial Mechanics Workshop organized by the Astronomical Observatory of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Poland and held in Poznan, from 3 to 7 July 2000. The purpose of the workshop was to identify future research in celestial mechanics and astrometry and encourage collaboration among scientists from eastern and western countries. Also an emphasis was placed on attracting young members of the fields from around the world and encouraging them to undertake new research efforts needed for advancements in those fields. There was a full program of invited and contributed presentations on selected subjects and each day ended with a discussion period on a general subject in celestial mechanics. The discussion topics and the leaders were: Resonances and Chaos -- A. Morbidelli; Artificial Satellite Orbits -- K.T. Alfriend; Near Earth Objects -- K. Muinonen; Small Solar System Bodies -- I. Williams; and Summary -- P.K. Seidelmann. The goal of the discussions was to identify what we did not know and how we might further our knowledge. It was felt, in addition, that Poznan, Poland, with a core of scientists covering a range of ages, would provide an example of how a research and educational group could be developed elsewhere. Also, Poznan is a central location convenient to eastern and western countries. Thus, the gathering of people and the papers presented are to be the bases for building the future of astrometry and celestial mechanics.

The cornerstone of the theory is the postulate that the Solar System is gravitationally isolated from the rest of the Universe and the background spacetime is asymptotically flat. The present article extends this theoretical concept and formulates the principles of celestial dynamics of particles and light moving in the gravitational field of a localized astronomical system embedded to the expanding Friedmann-LemaÃ®tre-Robertson-Walker universe. We formulate the precise mathematical concept of the Newtonian limit of Einsteinâs field equations in the conformally flat Friedmann-LemaÃ®tre-Robertson-Walker spacetime and analyze the geodesic motion of massive particles and light in this limit. We prove that by doing conformal spacetime transformations, one can reduce the equations of motion of particles and light to the classical form of the Newtonian theory. However, the time arguments in the equations of motion of particles and light differ from each other in terms being proportional to the Hubble constant H. This leads to the important conclusion that the equations of light propagation used currently by space navigation centers for fitting range and Doppler-tracking observations of celestial bodies are missing some terms of the cosmological origin that are proportional to the Hubble constant H. We also analyze the effect of the cosmological expansion on motion of electrons in atoms. We prove that the Hubble expansion does not affect the atomic frequencies and hence does not affect the atomic time scale used in the creation of astronomical ephemerides. We derive the cosmological correction to the light travel time equation and argue that its measurement opens an exciting opportunity to\n\nThe Celestial Basis of Civilization\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMasse, W. B.\n\nScholars have long puzzled over the reasons for the ubiquity of celestial images in the residue of the world's earliest civilizations: in art, myth, religious cosmology, iconography, cosmogony, eschatological beliefs, and as portents for the conduct of royal and chiefly power. The general consensus is that these images represented a need by early societies to use the fixed celestial heavens in order to regulate ritual and agricultural cycles, and to satisfy a psychological need by people to relate themselves to their surrounding Universe. Such explanations are facile and miss an important aspect of the celestial heavens. The fixed celestial heavens served as the back-drop for a large number of often spectacular temporary naked-eye visible celestial events which animated the night and sometimes the daytime sky, and which created an 'otherworld' for virtually all cultural groups. In this paper I present a model derived from the detailed analysis of Hawaiian oral traditions and culture history in relation to historic astronomical records of temporary celestial events, and then apply this model to cultural traditions from Mesoamerica and other geographic regions in order to demonstrate that novae, supernovae, variable stars, comets, great meteor showers, aurorae, solar and lunar eclipses, and impacting Solar System debris, together played a critical role in the artistic, intellectual, and political development of early civilizations. These data not only provide important insights into the development of civilization, but also provide important details and longitudinal records of astronomical events and phenomena which are otherwise not readily available for scientific scrutiny.\n\nSolar oscillation time delay measurement assisted celestial navigation method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNing, Xiaolin; Gui, Mingzhen; Zhang, Jie; Fang, Jiancheng; Liu, Gang\n\n2017-05-01\n\nSolar oscillation, which causes the sunlight intensity and spectrum frequency change, has been studied in great detail, both observationally and theoretically. In this paper, owing to the existence of solar oscillation, the time delay between the sunlight coming from the Sun directly and the sunlight reflected by the other celestial body such as the satellite of planet or asteroid can be obtained with two optical power meters. Because the solar oscillation time delay is determined by the relative positions of the spacecraft, reflective celestial body and the Sun, it can be adopted as the navigation measurement to estimate the spacecraft's position. The navigation accuracy of single solar oscillation time delay navigation system depends on the time delay measurement accuracy, and is influenced by the distance between spacecraft and reflective celestial body. In this paper, we combine it with the star angle measurement and propose a solar oscillation time delay measurement assisted celestial navigation method for deep space exploration. Since the measurement model of time delay is an implicit function, the Implicit Unscented Kalman Filter (IUKF) is applied. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of this method.\n\nA Snapshot-Based Mechanism for Celestial Orientation.\n\nPubMed\n\nEl Jundi, Basil; Foster, James J; Khaldy, Lana; Byrne, Marcus J; Dacke, Marie; Baird, Emily\n\n2016-06-06\n\nIn order to protect their food from competitors, ball-rolling dung beetles detach a piece of dung from a pile, shape it into a ball, and roll it away along a straight path [1]. They appear to rely exclusively on celestial compass cues to maintain their bearing [2-8], but the mechanism that enables them to use these cues for orientation remains unknown. Here, we describe the orientation strategy that allows dung beetles to use celestial cues in a dynamic fashion. We tested the underlying orientation mechanism by presenting beetles with a combination of simulated celestial cues (sun, polarized light, and spectral cues). We show that these animals do not rely on an innate prediction of the natural geographical relationship between celestial cues, as other navigating insects seem to [9, 10]. Instead, they appear to form an internal representation of the prevailing celestial scene, a \"celestial snapshot,\" even if that scene represents a physical impossibility for the real sky. We also find that the beetles are able to maintain their bearing with respect to the presented cues only if the cues are visible when the snapshotÂ is taken. This happens during the \"dance,\" a behavior in which the beetle climbs on top of its ball and rotates about its vertical axis [11]. This strategy for reading celestial signals is a simple but efficient mechanism for straight-line orientation. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

C.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nThe small astronomy satellite, SAS-2, used a 32-deck magnetic core digitized spark chamber to study gamma rays with energies above 30 MeV. Data for four regions of the sky away from the galactic plane were analyzed. These regions show a finite, diffuse flux of gamma rays with a steep energy spectrum, and the flux is uniform over all the regions. Represented by a power law, the differential energy spectrum shows an index of 2.5 + or - 0.4. The steep SAS-2 spectrum and the lower energy data are reasonably consistent with a neutral pion gamma-ray spectrum which was red-shifted (such as that proposed by some cosmological theories). It is concluded that the diffuse celestial gamma ray spectrum observed presents the possibility of cosmological studies and possible evidence for a residual cosmic ray density, and supports the galactic superclusters of matter and antimatter remaining from baryon-symmetric big bang.\n\nCelestial Seasonings: Astronomy and Rock Art in the American Southwest\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKrupp, E. C.\n\n1994-12-01\n\nAstronomical interpretations of prehistoric rock art have played a significant part in the development of modern archaeoastronomy since 1975, when interest was renewed in the possibility that the Crab supernova explosion of 1054 A.D. was represented in rock art of the American Southwest. (This hypothesis was actually first formulated in 1955.) In the last two decades, a variety of astronomical functions for rock art have been proposed and investigated. These include representation of specific historical celestial events, symbolic representation of elements of celestial myths, star maps, markers for astronomical observing stations markers for celestially tempered shrines, images intended to invoke and exploit cosmo-magical power, seasonally significant light-and-shadow displays. Examples of astronomical connotations in prehistoric rock art from the Southwest and California illustrate the necessity of understanding the culture in any attempt to understand its astronomy.\n\nAwesome Universe: an exhibition with images that showcase celestial objects as seen by ESO's observatories and associated activities\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarin-Farrona, A. M.\n\n2015-05-01\n\nIn September 2013, an ESO exhibition was shown in Santander: ``Awesome Universe -- the Cosmos through the eyes of the European Southern Observatory\". Around the exhibition, were proposed several activities: guide tours for children, younger and adults, workshops, film projections... In this way, the exhibition was visited by more than two thousand persons. We must keep in mind that Santander is a small city and its population does not usually take part in outreach activity. With this contribution, we want to teach the way in which it is possible to take advantage of science exhibitions. It made possible to show stunning images that showcase celestial objects as seen by ESO's observatories to the great majority of Santander population, and to awaken their interest in or enthusiasm for science.\n\nThe Future of Past Skies: Historical Celestial Cartography at the Adler Planetarium\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRaposo, Pedro M. P.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe Adler Planetarium is home to a world-class collection of scientific instruments, rare books and works on paper. Since 2014, Adler staff has been digitizing a wide selection of items relating to celestial cartography, including: more than 236 rare books and atlases; 97 works on paper; globes and other artifacts, amounting to 58 objects; and approximately 3,750 Carte du Ciel prints. This work has been carried out under the auspices of the Celestial Cartography Digitization Project (CCDP), which is sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities. This poster presentation will include: 1) an update on the project; 2) a description of related resources and tools available to the research community; 3) examples of how the Adler Planetarium is integrating the history of celestial cartography with its public programs; 4) an overview of a prospective citizen science project involving the identification of constellations in historical atlases and charts.\n\nCelestial diffuse gamma radiation above 30 MeV observed by SAS-2\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFichtel, C. E.; Kniffen, D. A.; Hartman, R. C.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nThe Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS)-2, launched on November 15, 1972, carried into orbit a 32-deck magnetic-core digitized spark chamber gamma ray telescope to study celestial gamma radiation in the energy range above 30 MeV. In the study of several regions with b sub 2 15 deg, a finite, diffuse flux of gamma rays with a steep energy spectrum in the energy region from 35 to 200 MeV is observed. Representing the energy spectrum by a power law of the form dJ/dE = AE to - alpha power over this energy range, alpha is found along with the integral flux above 100 MeV. Combining this result with existing low energy gamma ray data yields an energy spectrum which is not a simple power law in energy, as in the X-ray region, but which demonstrates first an increase and then a decrease in slope, consistent within uncertainties with that predicted by cosmological theories, including the continuous production of high energy gamma rays primarily from neutral pi mesons throughout the history of the universe.\n\nDesign of all-weather celestial navigation system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSun, Hongchi; Mu, Rongjun; Du, Huajun; Wu, Peng\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn order to realize autonomous navigation in the atmosphere, an all-weather celestial navigation system is designed. The research of celestial navigation system include discrimination method of comentropy and the adaptive navigation algorithm based on the P value. The discrimination method of comentropy is studied to realize the independent switching of two celestial navigation modes, starlight and radio. Finally, an adaptive filtering algorithm based on P value is proposed, which can greatly improve the disturbance rejection capability of the system. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the three axis attitude is better than 10â³, and it can work all weather. In perturbation environment, the position accuracy of the integrated navigation system can be increased 20% comparing with the traditional method. It basically meets the requirements of the all-weather celestial navigation system, and it has the ability of stability, reliability, high accuracy and strong anti-interference.\n\nMotion of the Jovian commensurability resonances and the character of the celestial mechanics in the asteroid zone - Implication for kinematics and structure\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTorbett, M.; Smoluchowski, R.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe motion of the Jovian commensurability resonances during the early evolution of the solar system induced by the dissipation of the accretion disk results in fundamental differences in the celestial mechanics of objects over which a resonance passes from that observed for a stationary resonance. Objects experiencing resonance passage acquire irreversible increases of average eccentricity to large values accounting for the present-day random velocities of the asteroids. Semi-major axes are similarly irreversibly decreased by amounts capable of clearing the Kirkwood gaps. The gap widths are in agreement with observation.\n\nDetermination of meteor flux distribution over the celestial sphere\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAndreev, V. V.; Belkovich, O. I.; Filimonova, T. K.; Sidorov, V. V.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nA new method of determination of meteor flux density distribution over the celestial sphere is discussed. The flux density was derived from observations by radar together with measurements of angles of arrival of radio waves reflected from meteor trails. The role of small meteor showers over the sporadic background is shown.\n\nProtection of celestial environments and the law of outer space\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTennen, Leslie; Race, Margaret\n\nThe law of outer space expressly addresses the matter of preservation and protection of natural celestial environments from harmful contamination and disruption by mankind in the explo-ration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies. The Outer Space Treaty, however, does not prohibit all human impact to an extraterrestrial environment, but rather permits a wide range of activities that could have significant environmental ramifications. This legal regime may be in conflict with the interests of preserving celestial environments for scientific research, especially when considered in relation to activities conducted for commercial purposes. Nevertheless, the Moon Agreement provides a mechanism by which special protective measures can be implemented to protect particular areas of the moon and other celestial bodies for scientific investigation. This paper examines the current status of the law of outer space vis-a-vis the protection and preservation of natural celestial environments. Particular emphasis is placed on the policies on which the legal obligations are based, together with consideration of the non-appropriation principle, and the commercial use of lunar and other celestial resources and areas. In addition, the concepts of international scientific preserves, special regions, keep out zones, and planetary parks are compared and evaluated as potential means to limit the disturbance to celestial environments caused by the activities of mankind.\n\nFrontiers in Relativistic Celestial Mechanics, Vol. 2, Applications and Experiments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKopeikin, Sergei\n\n2014-08-01\n\nRelativistic celestial mechanics - investigating the motion celestial bodies under the influence of general relativity - is a major tool of modern experimental gravitational physics. With a wide range of prominent authors from the field, this two-volume series consists of reviews on a multitude of advanced topics in the area of relativistic celestial mechanics - starting from more classical topics such as the regime of asymptotically-flat spacetime, light propagation and celestial ephemerides, but also including its role in cosmology and alternative theories of gravity as well as modern experiments in this area.

These stars constitute both an update of and additions to a previously published list of equatorial photometric standard stars. The list is capable of providing, for both celestial hemispheres, an internally consistent homogeneous broadband standard photometric system around the sky. When these new measurements are included with those previously published by Landolt (1992), the entire list of standard stars in this paper encompasses the magnitude range 8.90 < V < 16.30, and the color indexmoreÂ Â» range -0.35 < (B - V) < +2.30.Â«Â less\n\nNeural coding underlying the cue preference for celestial orientation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nel Jundi, Basil; Warrant, Eric J.; Byrne, Marcus J.; Khaldy, Lana; Baird, Emily; Smolka, Jochen; Dacke, Marie\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDiurnal and nocturnal African dung beetles use celestial cues, such as the sun, the moon, and the polarization pattern, to roll dung balls along straight paths across the savanna. Although nocturnal beetles move in the same manner through the same environment as their diurnal relatives, they do so when light conditions are at least 1 million-fold dimmer. Here, we show, for the first time to our knowledge, that the celestial cue preference differs between nocturnal and diurnal beetles in a manner that reflects their contrasting visual ecologies. We also demonstrate how these cue preferences are reflected in the activity of compass neurons in the brain. At night, polarized skylight is the dominant orientation cue for nocturnal beetles. However, if we coerce them to roll during the day, they instead use a celestial body (the sun) as their primary orientation cue. Diurnal beetles, however, persist in using a celestial body for their compass, day or night. Compass neurons in the central complex of diurnal beetles are tuned only to the sun, whereas the same neurons in the nocturnal species switch exclusively to polarized light at lunar light intensities. Thus, these neurons encode the preferences for particular celestial cues and alter their weighting according to ambient light conditions. This flexible encoding of celestial cue preferences relative to the prevailing visual scenery provides a simple, yet effective, mechanism for enabling visual orientation at any light intensity.

This approach makes use of the close link between orbit and gravity field determination. GPS-derived kinematic GRACE orbit positions, inter-satellite K-band observations, which are the core observations of GRACE, and accelerometer data are combined to rigorously estimate orbit and spherical harmonic gravity field coefficients in one adjustment step. Pseudo-stochastic orbit parameters are set up to absorb unmodeled noise. The K-band range measurements in along-track direction lead to a much higher correlation of the observations in this direction compared to the other directions and thus, to north-south stripes in the unconstrained gravity field solutions, so-called correlated errors. By using a full covariance matrix for the K-band observations the correlation can be taken into account. One possibility is to derive correlation information from post-processing K-band residuals. This is then used in a second iteration step to derive an improved gravity field solution. We study the effects of pre-defined covariance matrices and residual-derived covariance matrices on the final gravity field product with the CMA.\n\nLaplacean Ideology for Preliminary Orbit Determination and Moving Celestial Body Identification in Virtual Epoch\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBykov, O. P.\n\nAny CCD frames with stars or galaxies or clusters and other images must be studied for a searching of moving celestial objects, namely asteroids, comets, artificial Earth satellites inside them. At Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory, new methods and software were elaborated to solve this problem.\n\nIntrinsic nonlinearity and method of disturbed observations in inverse problems of celestial mechanics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAvdyushev, Victor A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nOrbit determination from a small sample of observations over a very short observed orbital arc is a strongly nonlinear inverse problem. In such problems an evaluation of orbital uncertainty due to random observation errors is greatly complicated, since linear estimations conventionally used are no longer acceptable for describing the uncertainty even as a rough approximation. Nevertheless, if an inverse problem is weakly intrinsically nonlinear, then one can resort to the so-called method of disturbed observations (aka observational Monte Carlo). Previously, we showed that the weaker the intrinsic nonlinearity, the more efficient the method, i.e. the more accurate it enables one to simulate stochastically the orbital uncertainty, while it is strictly exact only when the problem is intrinsically linear. However, as we ascertained experimentally, its efficiency was found to be higher than that of other stochastic methods widely applied in practice. In the present paper we investigate the intrinsic nonlinearity in complicated inverse problems of Celestial Mechanics when orbits are determined from little informative samples of observations, which typically occurs for recently discovered asteroids. To inquire into the question, we introduce an index of intrinsic nonlinearity. In asteroid problems it evinces that the intrinsic nonlinearity can be strong enough to affect appreciably probabilistic estimates, especially at the very short observed orbital arcs that the asteroids travel on for about a hundredth of their orbital periods and less. As it is known from regression analysis, the source of intrinsic nonlinearity is the nonflatness of the estimation subspace specified by a dynamical model in the observation space. Our numerical results indicate that when determining asteroid orbits it is actually very slight. However, in the parametric space the effect of intrinsic nonlinearity is exaggerated mainly by the ill-conditioning of the inverse problem. Even so, as for the\n\nSpectroscopy of Dwarf Stars Around the North Celestial Pole\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMikolaitis, Å arÅ«nas; TautvaiÅ¡ienÄ, GraÅ¾ina; Drazdauskas, Arnas; MinkeviÄiÅ«tÄ, Renata; Klebonas, Lukas; Bagdonas, Vilius; PakÅ¡ienÄ, Erika; Janulis, Rimvydas\n\n2018-07-01\n\nNew space missions (e.g., NASA-TESS and ESA-PLATO) will perform an in-depth analysis of bright stars in large fields of the celestial sphere searching for extraterrestrial planets and investigating their host-stars. Asteroseismic observations will search for exoplanet-hosting stars with solar-like oscillations. In order to achieve all the goals, a full characterization of the stellar objects is important. However, accurate atmospheric parameters are available for less than 30% of bright dwarf stars of the solar neighborhood. In this study we observed high-resolution (R = 60,000) spectra for all bright (V < 8 mag) and cooler than F5 spectral class dwarf stars in the northern-most field of the celestial sphere with radius of 20Â° from the Î±(2000) = 161.Â°03 and Î´(2000) = 86.Â°60 that is a center of one of the preliminary ESO-PLATO fields. Spectroscopic atmospheric parameters were determined for 140 slowly rotating stars, for 73% of them for the first time. The majority (83%) of the investigated stars are in the TESS object lists and all of them are in the preliminary PLATO field. Our results have no systematic differences when compared with other recent studies. We have 119 stars in common with the GenevaâCopenhagen Survey, where stellar parameters were determined photometrically, and find a 14 Â± 125 K difference in effective temperatures, 0.01 Â± 0.16 in log g, and â0.02 Â± 0.09 dex in metallicities. Comparing our results for 39 stars with previous high-resolution spectral determinations, we find only a 7 Â± 73 K difference in effective temperatures, 0.02 Â± 0.09 in log g, and â0.02 Â± 0.09 dex in metallicities. We also determined basic kinematic and orbital parameters for this sample of stars. From the kinematical point of view, almost all our stars belong to the thin disk substructure of the Milky Way. The derived galactocentric metallicity gradient is â0.066 Â± 0.024 dex kpcâ1 (2.5Ï significance) and the vertical metallicity gradient is â0.102 Â\n\nCelestial polarization patterns during twilight.\n\nPubMed\n\nCronin, Thomas W; Warrant, Eric J; Greiner, Birgit\n\n2006-08-01\n\nScattering of sunlight produces patterns of partially linearly polarized light in the sky throughout the day, and similar patterns appear at night when the Moon is bright. We studied celestial polarization patterns during the period of twilight, when the Sun is below the horizon, determining the degree and orientation of the polarized-light field and its changes before sunrise and after sunset. During twilight, celestial polarized light occurs in a wide band stretching perpendicular to the location of the hidden Sun and reaching typical degrees of polarization near 80% at wavelengths >600 nm. In the tropics, this pattern appears approximately 1 h before local sunrise or disappears approximately 1 h after local sunset (within 10 min. after the onset of astronomical twilight at dawn, or before its end at dusk) and extends with little change through the entire twilight period.\n\nMicroarsecond models for the celestial motions of the CIP and CEO\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCapitaine, N.\n\n2004-09-01\n\nThe Celestial intermediate pole (CIP) and Celestial ephemeris (orintermediate) origin (CEO/CIO) have been adopted by the IAU (c.f. IAU2000 Resolution B1.8) as the celestial pole and origin, respectively,to be used for realizing the intermediate celestial system between theInternational Terrestrial System (ITRS) and Geocentric CelestialReference System (GCRS). Resolution B1.8 has also recommended that theInternational Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS)continue to provide users with data and algorithms for the conventionaltransformation. The IAU 2000 Resolutions have been implemented in theIERS 2003 Conventions including Tables and routines that provide thecelestial motions of the CIP and the CEO with a theoretical accuracy ofone microarcsecond after one century using either the classical or thenew transformation. This paper reports on the method used for achievingthis accuracy in the positions of the CIP and CIO and on the differencebetween this rigorous procedure and the pre-2003 classical one.\n\nArchaic artifacts resembling celestial spheres\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDimitrakoudis, S.; Papaspyrou, P.; Petoussis, V.; Moussas, X.\n\nWe present several bronze artifacts from the Archaic Age in Greece (750-480 BC) that resemble celestial spheres or forms of other astronomical significance. They are studied in the context of the Dark Age transition from Mycenaean Age astronomical themes to the philosophical and practical revival of astronomy in the Classical Age with its plethora of astronomical devices. These artifacts, mostly votive in nature are spherical in shape and appear in a variety of forms their most striking characteristic being the depiction of meridians and/or an equator. Most of those artifacts come from Thessaly, and more specifically from the temple of Itonia Athena at Philia, a religious center of pan-Hellenic significance. Celestial spheres, similar in form to the small artifacts presented in this study, could be used to measure latitudes, or estimate the time at a known place, and were thus very useful in navigation.\n\nAlmanac services for celestial navigation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNelmes, S.; Whittaker, J.\n\n2015-08-01\n\nCelestial navigation remains a vitally important back up to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and relies on the use of almanac services. HM Nautical Almanac Office (HMNAO) provides a number of these services. The printed book, The Nautical Almanac, produced yearly and now available as an electronic publication, is continuously being improved, making use of the latest ideas and ephemerides to provide the user with their required data. HMNAO also produces NavPac, a software package that assists the user in calculating their position as well as providing additional navigational and astronomical tools. A new version of NavPac will be released in 2015 that will improve the user experience. The development of applications for mobile devices is also being considered. HMNAO continues to combine the latest improvements and theories of astrometry with the creation of books and software that best meet the needs of celestial navigation users.\n\nTHE CELESTIAL REFERENCE FRAME AT 24 AND 43 GHz. I. ASTROMETRY\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLanyi, G. E.; Jacobs, C. S.; Naudet, C. J.\n\n2010-05-15\n\nWe present astrometric results for compact extragalactic objects observed with the Very Long Baseline Array at radio frequencies of 24 and 43 GHz. Data were obtained from ten 24 hr observing sessions made over a five-year period. These observations were motivated by the need to extend the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) to higher radio frequencies to enable improved deep space navigation after 2016 and to improve state-of-the-art astrometry. Source coordinates for 268 sources were estimated at 24 GHz and for 131 sources at 43 GHz. The median formal uncertainties of right ascension and declination at 24 GHz are 0.08moreÂ Â» and 0.15 mas, respectively. Median formal uncertainties at 43 GHz are 0.20 and 0.35 mas, respectively. Weighted root-mean-square differences between the 24 and 43 GHz positions and astrometric positions based on simultaneous 2.3 and 8.4 GHz Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations, such as the ICRF, are less than about 0.3 mas in both coordinates. With observations over five years we have achieved a precision at 24 GHz approaching that of the ICRF but unaccounted systematic errors limit the overall accuracy of the catalogs.Â«Â less\n\nCelestial mechanics with geometric algebra\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHestenes, D.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nGeometric algebra is introduced as a general tool for Celestial Mechanics. A general method for handling finite rotations and rotational kinematics is presented. The constants of Kepler motion are derived and manipulated in a new way. A new spinor formulation of perturbation theory is developed.\n\nResearch on the error model of airborne celestial/inertial integrated navigation system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZheng, Xiaoqiang; Deng, Xiaoguo; Yang, Xiaoxu; Dong, Qiang\n\n2015-02-01\n\nCelestial navigation subsystem of airborne celestial/inertial integrated navigation system periodically correct the positioning error and heading drift of the inertial navigation system, by which the inertial navigation system can greatly improve the accuracy of long-endurance navigation. Thus the navigation accuracy of airborne celestial navigation subsystem directly decides the accuracy of the integrated navigation system if it works for long time. By building the mathematical model of the airborne celestial navigation system based on the inertial navigation system, using the method of linear coordinate transformation, we establish the error transfer equation for the positioning algorithm of airborne celestial system. Based on these we built the positioning error model of the celestial navigation. And then, based on the positioning error model we analyze and simulate the positioning error which are caused by the error of the star tracking platform with the MATLAB software. Finally, the positioning error model is verified by the information of the star obtained from the optical measurement device in range and the device whose location are known. The analysis and simulation results show that the level accuracy and north accuracy of tracking platform are important factors that limit airborne celestial navigation systems to improve the positioning accuracy, and the positioning error have an approximate linear relationship with the level error and north error of tracking platform. The error of the verification results are in 1000m, which shows that the model is correct.\n\nPosition determination systems. [using orbital antenna scan of celestial bodies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nShores, P. W. (Inventor)\n\n1976-01-01\n\nA system for an orbital antenna, operated at a synchronous altitude, to scan an area of a celestial body is disclosed. The antenna means comprises modules which are operated by a steering signal in a repetitive function for providing a scanning beam over the area. The scanning covers the entire area in a pattern and the azimuth of the scanning beam is transmitted to a control station on the celestial body simultaneous with signals from an activated ground beacon on the celestial body. The azimuth of the control station relative to the antenna is known and the location of the ground beacon is readily determined from the azimuth determinations.\n\nCelestial Pole Offsets: Conversion From (dX, dY) to (d(psi), d(epsilon).

Cohen's spectral template1 is modified for high spectral resolution and accuracy. Based on the improved spectral template for stars and the blackbody assumption for planets, an IR radiation model is developed which is able to generate the celestial IR background for stars and planets appearing in sensor's field of view (FOV) for specified observing date and time, location, viewpoint and spectral band over 1.2Î¼m ~ 35Î¼m. In the current model, the initial locations of stars are calculated based on midcourse space experiment (MSX) IR astronomical catalogue (MSX-IRAC) 2 , while the initial locations of planets are calculated using secular variations of the planetary orbits (VSOP) theory. Simulation results show that the new IR radiation model has higher resolution and accuracy than common model.\n\nThe historical tension between astronomical theory and observation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGingerich, O.\n\nA review of instances in the history of astronomy wherein conflicts between the results of theory and observation occurred, to be later ameliorated or exaggerated by further evidence, is presented. Among the examples are Aristotle's arguments that the form of a celestial body will always be spherical to evenly distribute the mass, and the currently held concept that all celestial objects greater than a few kilometers in radius will be spherical due to gravitational forces. Ptolemy's observations of planetary orbits, however, are noted to have accurately resulted in a numerical model which did not factually represent planetary orbits. It is noted that observation is usually performed with a theory in mind, and interpretation is therefore hindered from clear analysis of phenomena which do not conform to previously held mental models.\n\nHubble peers inside a celestial geode\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2004-08-01\n\ncelestial geode hi-res Size hi-res: 148 Kb Credits: ESA/NASA, YÃ¤el NazÃ© (University of LiÃ¨ge, Belgium) and You-Hua Chu (University of Illinois, Urbana, USA) Hubble peers inside a celestial geode In this unusual image, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope captures a rare view of the celestial equivalent of a geode - a gas cavity carved by the stellar wind and intense ultraviolet radiation from a young hot star. Real geodes are handball-sized, hollow rocks that start out as bubbles in volcanic or sedimentary rock. Only when these inconspicuous round rocks are split in half by a geologist, do we get a chance to appreciate the inside of the rock cavity that is lined with crystals.

Real geodes are handball-sized, hollow rocks that start out as bubbles in volcanic or sedimentary rock.

In the case of Hubble's 35 light-year diameter âcelestial geodeâ the transparency of its bubble-like cavity of interstellar gas and dust reveals the treasures of its interior. The object, called N44F, is being inflated by a torrent of fast-moving particles (what astronomers call a 'stellar wind') from an exceptionally hot star (the bright star just below the centre of the bubble) once buried inside a cold dense cloud. Compared with our Sun (which is losing mass through the so-called 'solar wind'), the central star in N44F is ejecting more than a 100 million times more mass per second and the hurricane of particles moves much faster at 7 million km per hour\n\nOn the Origin of Rotation of a Celestial Body\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVujiÄiÄ, V. A.\n\n1988-03-01\n\nThe differential equations of the self-rotation of a celestial body have been evaluated. From an integral of these equations a formula for angular velocity of the celestial body was obtained. This formula after being applied to the rotation of the Sun and of the Earth gives, respectively, the following angular velocity ranges: 0.588Ã10-6<Ï<18, 187Ã10-6 and 0.7533Ã10-5<Ï<12,4266Ã10-5. These are up to three times narrower than those previously obtained by SaviÄ and KaÅ¡anin [1].\n\nHigh Resolution Asteroid Profile by Multi Chord Occultation Observations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDegenhardt, Scott\n\n2009-05-01\n\nFor millennia man has observed celestial objects occulting other bodies and distant stars. We have used these celestial synchronicities to measure the properties of objects. On January 1, 1801 Italian astronomer Giusappe Piazzi discovered the first asteroid that would soon be named Ceres. To date 190,000 of these objects have been catalogued, but only a fraction of these have accurate measurements of their true size and shape. The International Occultation Timing Association (IOTA) currently facilitates the prediction and reduction of asteroidal occultations. By measuring the shadow cast on the earth by an asteroid during a stellar occultation one can directly measure the physical size, shape, and position in space of this body to accuracies orders of magnitudes better than the best ground based adaptive optics telescope and can provide verification to 3D inverted reflective lightcurve prediction models. Recent novel methods developed by IOTA involving an individual making multiple observations through unattended remote observing stations have made way for numerous chords of occultation measurement through a single body yielding high resolution profiles of asteroid bodies. Methodology of how observing stations are deployed will be demonstrated, results of some of these observations are presented as comparisons to their inverted lightcurve are shown.\n\nMonthly gravity field solutions based on GRACE observations generated with the Celestial Mechanics Approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMeyer, Ulrich; JÃ¤ggi, Adrian; Beutler, Gerhard\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThe main objective of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission consists of determining the temporal variations of the Earth's gravity field. These variations are captured by time series of gravity field models of limited resolution at, e.g., monthly intervals. We present a new time series of monthly models, which was computed with the so-called Celestial Mechanics Approach (CMA), developed at the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB). The secular and seasonal variations in the monthly models are tested for statistical significance. Calibrated errors are derived from inter-annual variations. The time-variable signal can be extracted at least up to degree 60, but the gravity field coefficients of orders above 45 are heavily contaminated by noise. This is why a series of monthly models is computed up to a maximum degree of 60, but only a maximum order of 45. Spectral analysis of the residual time-variable signal shows a distinctive peak at a period of 160 days, which shows up in particular in the C20 spherical harmonic coefficient. Basic filter- and scaling-techniques are introduced to evaluate the monthly models. For this purpose, the variability over the oceans is investigated, which serves as a measure for the noisiness of the models. The models in selected regions show the expected seasonal and secular variations, which are in good agreement with the monthly models of the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam, German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ). The results also reveal a few small outliers, illustrating the necessity for improved data screening. Our monthly models are available at the web page of the International Centre for Global Earth Models (ICGEM).\n\nDynamical configurations of celestial systems comprised of multiple irregular bodies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJiang, Yu; Zhang, Yun; Baoyin, Hexi; Li, Junfeng\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThis manuscript considers the main features of the nonlinear dynamics of multiple irregular celestial body systems. The gravitational potential, static electric potential, and magnetic potential are considered. Based on the three established potentials, we show that three conservative values exist for this system, including a Jacobi integral. The equilibrium conditions for the system are derived and their stability analyzed. The equilibrium conditions of a celestial system comprised of n irregular bodies are reduced to 12n - 9 equations. The dynamical results are applied to simulate the motion of multiple-asteroid systems. The simulation is useful for the study of the stability of multiple irregular celestial body systems and for the design of spacecraft orbits to triple-asteroid systems discovered in the solar system. The dynamical configurations of the five triple-asteroid systems 45 Eugenia, 87 Sylvia, 93 Minerva, 216 Kleopatra, and 136617 1994CC, and the six-body system 134340 Pluto are calculated and analyzed.\n\nEstablishing a celestial VLBI reference frame. 1: Searching for VLBI sources\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPreston, R.

J.; Johnson, B.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nThe Deep Space Network is currently engaged in establishing a new high-accuracy VLBI celestial reference frame. The present status of the task of finding suitable celestial radio sources for constructing this reference frame is discussed. To date, 564 VLBI sources were detected, with 166 of these lying within 10 deg of the ecliptic plane. The variation of the sky distribution of these sources with source strength is examined.\n\nSpatial water maze learning using celestial cues by the meadow vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus.\n\nPubMed\n\nKavaliers, M; Galea, L A\n\n1994-03-31\n\nThe Morris water maze is widely used to evaluate to evaluate the spatial learning ability of rodents under laboratory settings. The present study demonstrates that reproductive male meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, are able to acquire and retain a spatial water maze task using celestial cues. Voles were able to acquire a modified outdoor Morris water maze task over 4 trials per day, whereby they had to learn and remember the location of a submerged hidden platform, using the position of the sun and associated celestial cues. Their proficiency on this task was related to the availability of the celestial cues, with voles displaying significantly poorer spatial navigation on overcast than clear days and when the testing time (and position of the sun and associated celestial cues) was shifted from morning to afternoon. These findings with meadow voles support the ecological relevance of the water maze task.\n\nA celestial assisted INS initialization method for lunar explorers.\n\nPubMed\n\nNing, Xiaolin; Wang, Longhua; Wu, Weiren; Fang, Jiancheng\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe second and third phases of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (CLEP) are planning to achieve Moon landing, surface exploration and automated sample return. In these missions, the inertial navigation system (INS) and celestial navigation system (CNS) are two indispensable autonomous navigation systems which can compensate for limitations in the ground based navigation system. The accurate initialization of the INS and the precise calibration of the CNS are needed in order to achieve high navigation accuracy. Neither the INS nor the CNS can solve the above problems using the ground controllers or by themselves on the lunar surface. However, since they are complementary to each other, these problems can be solved by combining them together. A new celestial assisted INS initialization method is presented, in which the initial position and attitude of the explorer as well as the inertial sensors' biases are estimated by aiding the INS with celestial measurements. Furthermore, the systematic error of the CNS is also corrected by the help of INS measurements. Simulations show that the maximum error in position is 300 m and in attitude 40â³, which demonstrates this method is a promising and attractive scheme for explorers on the lunar surface.\n\nUnidentified Aerial and Celestial Objects.

While this lovely image contains hundreds of distant stars and galaxies, one vital thing is missing â the object Hubble was actually studying at the time! This is not because the target has disappeared. The ACS actually uses two detectors: the first captures the object being studied â in this case an open star cluster known as NGC 299 â while the other detector images the patch of space just âbeneathâ it. This is what can be seen here. Technically, this picture is merely a sidekick of the actual object of interest â but space is bursting with activity, and this field of bright celestial bodies offers plenty of interest on its own. It may initially seem to show just stars, but a closer look reveals many of these tiny objects to be galaxies. The spiral galaxies have arms curving out from a bright center. The fuzzier, less clearly shaped galaxies might be ellipticals. Some of these galaxies contain millions or even billions of stars, but are so distant that all of their starry residents are contained within just a small pinprick of light that appears to be the same size as a single star! The bright blue dots are very hot stars, sometimes distorted into crosses by the struts supporting Hubbleâs secondary mirror. The redder dots are cooler stars, possibly in the red giant phase when a dying star cools and expands. Credit: ESA/Hubble & NASA NASA image use policy.

H.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nA mathematical description of the data reduction technique used to simultaneously calibrate the Voyager celestial and inertial attitude control subsystems is given. It is shown that knowledge of the spacecraft limit cycle motion, as measured by the celestial and the inertial sensors, is adequate to result in the estimates of a selected number of errors which adversely affect the spacecraft attitude knowledge.\n\nMotions of Celestial Bodies; Computer simulations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nButikov, Eugene\n\n2014-10-01\n\nThis book is written for a wide range of graduate and undergraduate students studying various courses in physics and astronomy. It is accompanied by the award winning educational software package 'Planets and Satellites' developed by the author. This text, together with the interactive software, is intended to help students learn and understand the fundamental concepts and the laws of physics as they apply to the fascinating world of the motions of natural and artificial celestial bodies. The primary aim of the book is the understanding of the foundations of classical and modern physics, while their application to celestial mechanics is used to illustrate these concepts. The simulation programs create vivid and lasting impressions of the investigated phenomena, and provide students and their instructors with a powerful tool which enables them to explore basic concepts that are difficult to study and teach in an abstract conventional manner. Students can work with the text and software at a pace they can enjoy, varying parameters of the simulated systems. Each section of the textbook is supplied with questions, exercises, and problems. Using some of the suggested simulation programs, students have an opportunity to perform interesting mini-research projects in physics and astronomy.\n\nCelestial Navigation in the USA, Fiji, and Tunisia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHolbrook, Jarita C.\n\n2015-05-01\n\nToday there are many coastal communities that are home to navigators who use stars for position finding at night; I was, however, unaware of this fact when I began researching celestial navigation practices in 1997. My project focused on three communities: the Moce Islanders of Fiji, the Kerkennah Islanders in Tunisia, and the U.S. Navy officers and students at the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland. My goal was to answer the question of why people continue to navigate by the stars, but also to understand the role of technology in their navigation practices. Using anthropology techniques of ethnography including participant observation, formal and informal interviews, audio and videotaping, I gathered data over five years at the three communities. I began by learning the details of how they use the stars for navigation. Next, I learned about who did the navigation and where they learned to navigate. I gathered opinions on various navigation aids and instruments, and opinions about the future of using the stars for navigation. I listened to the stories that they told about navigating. In the United States I worked in English, in Fiji, in Fijian and English, and in Tunisia, French and English. For the formal interviews I worked with translators. The navigators use stars for navigating today but the future of their techniques is not certain. Though practiced today, these celestial navigation traditions have undergone and continue to undergo changes. New navigational technologies are part of the stimulation for change, thus 'a meeting of different worlds' is symbolized by peoples encounters with these technologies.\n\nA Celestial Assisted INS Initialization Method for Lunar Explorers\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNing, Xiaolin; Wang, Longhua; Wu, Weiren; Fang, Jiancheng\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe second and third phases of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (CLEP) are planning to achieve Moon landing, surface exploration and automated sample return.

H.\n\n2015-07-01\n\nThe two oldest Armenian calendars - the Haykian and Protohaykian calendars were connected with observations of celestial bodies. Particularly since 2341 B.C. the heliacal rising of the first star of Orion was used to determine the day of the main holiday - Nawasard. Before that the observations of the same star were used in Protohaykian calendar to determine both the beginning and the end of the year. The year was determined as the duration of visibility of the star Betelgeuse. The year started with the heliacal rising of this star and ended with its heliacal setting. The remaining duration was considered to be out of the year. There are also evidences in Armenian medieval literary sources concerning the observations of heliacal rising and setting of Pleiades. An attempt was made to substantiate that the large symbol carved on the rock platform of the small hill in Metzamor also concerns to the Pleiades and shows the direction of heliacal rising of Pleiades.\n\nPrinciples of Celestial Navigation: An Online Resource for Introducing Practical Astronomy to the Public\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUrban, Sean E.\n\n2015-08-01\n\nAstronomy is often called a \"gateway\" science because it inspires appreciation and awe among children and non-scientists. Applied astronomy, with practical, real-world applications, can entice even the most utilitarian people to take notice and learn about the subject. Traditional celestial navigation is an astronomy topic that captures the attention of the public. The U.S. Naval Observatory has led the development of a publicly available online celestial navigation educational module titled, \"Principles of Celestial Navigation\". It can be used world-wide to introduce people to astronomy. This poster describes some of the aspects of this teaching module.\n\nOn a celestial occurrence recorded in the hagiography of St. Vladimir\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBanjeviÄ, Boris\n\n2002-04-01\n\nThere were recorded a number of celestial occurrences in Serbian early history. Amongst them are a few appearances of comets. One except from Bible bearing on life of king David, relating to a phenomenon that might be interpreted as a comet, is in some way similar to the quotation from the hagiography of St. Vladimir. There is possibility that Halley's comet was observed at some time. This affects the chronology of the reign of St. Vladimir by about 11 years. This author thinks that it was in the summer 989 AD.\n\nAutonomous Navigation Using Celestial Objects\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFolta, David; Gramling, Cheryl; Leung, Dominic; Belur, Sheela; Long, Anne\n\n1999-01-01\n\nIn the twenty-first century, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Enterprises envision frequent low-cost missions to explore the solar system, observe the universe, and study our planet. Satellite autonomy is a key technology required to reduce satellite operating costs. The Guidance, Navigation, and Control Center (GNCC) at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) currently sponsors several initiatives associated with the development of advanced spacecraft systems to provide autonomous navigation and control. Autonomous navigation has the potential both to increase spacecraft navigation system performance and to reduce total mission cost. By eliminating the need for routine ground-based orbit determination and special tracking services, autonomous navigation can streamline spacecraft ground systems. Autonomous navigation products can be included in the science telemetry and forwarded directly to the scientific investigators. In addition, autonomous navigation products are available onboard to enable other autonomous capabilities, such as attitude control, maneuver planning and orbit control, and communications signal acquisition. Autonomous navigation is required to support advanced mission concepts such as satellite formation flying. GNCC has successfully developed high-accuracy autonomous navigation systems for near-Earth spacecraft using NASA's space and ground communications systems and the Global Positioning System (GPS). Recently, GNCC has expanded its autonomous navigation initiative to include satellite orbits that are beyond the regime in which use of GPS is possible. Currently, GNCC is assessing the feasibility of using standard spacecraft attitude sensors and communication components to provide autonomous navigation for missions including: libration point, gravity assist, high-Earth, and interplanetary orbits. The concept being evaluated uses a combination of star, Sun, and Earth sensor measurements along with forward-link Doppler\n\nCombining sky and earth: desert ants (Melophorus bagoti) show weighted integration of celestial and terrestrial cues.\n\nPubMed\n\nLegge, Eric L G; Wystrach, Antoine; Spetch, Marcia L; Cheng, Ken\n\n2014-12-01\n\nInsects typically use celestial sources of directional information for path integration, and terrestrial panoramic information for view-based navigation.
