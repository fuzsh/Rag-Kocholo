        "text": "Question “What geometric method was used for Apollo Cislunar navigation? Answer: There was not a single geometric method. Sextant sights were reduced to lines of position, not discrete position fixes. Multiple navigational inputs were numerically integrated by the Flight Computer (FC) to continuously update the State Vector.\n\nQuestion: “Could traditional Marine Celestial Navigation be used for Cislunar navigation?” Answer: Maybe. But hand calculations would be so tedious the answers would likely be irrelevant by the time they appeared. Calculations could be sped up with a computer, but it would still provide only a position fix, not a vector. The State Vector could be derived from multiple fixes, but once again the information would be stale before it arrived.\n\nCislunar navigation on Apollo was dependent on either the Command Module’s FC or ground based computing. It could not have been accomplished by hand calculations and ephemeris.\n\n• The following is excerpted from The Apollo Guidance and Navigation document R-500 from MIT https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19660019469/downloads/19660019469.pdf\n\n“The originally stated premise that a single failure should leave the system with enough capability to return safely should now be examined... If ground tracking navigation data are unavailable because of a loss of communications, then the onboard system can perform all the necessary navigation. If the onboard navigation capability fails, the ground can provide the necessary data. This applies to the failure of either the optics system or the onboard computer.”\n\nA computer is always in the loop. It can do a better, faster job than traditional methods.\n\n• From Chapter III-2 Coasting Flight Navigation: (same document)\n\nFlight Computer (FC) Inputs:\n\nDistance, velocity, elevation and azimuth from well-established reference points\n\nAngles between lines of sight to known celestial objects,\n\nStar occultations, and\n\nApparent planet diameters.\n\nThe input navigation information listed above does not include an absolute position fix, but each piece of information can update a portion of the State Vector coordinates. For instance, radar may provide z-axis data and velocity. Horizon/star sights may provide x-axis and y-axis data but no velocity data.\n\nA value for the 6-dimensional State Vector is maintained in the FC. It uses an Earth- or Moon-centered equatorial coordinate system (depending on the sphere of influence). The computer uses equations of motion to continuously update the State Vector using numerical integration of the inertial sensor data. As other navigational inputs become available, they, too, are used to update the State Vector.\n\nDuring cislunar flight, navigation observations could potentially keep astronauts busy 24/7 … too busy to perform other tasks. To optimize the workload, the flight plan limits navigation observations to those which will increase navigational accuracy. Accuracy was defined as reduced RMS error at the next transit endpoint, such as Lunar orbital insertion."
