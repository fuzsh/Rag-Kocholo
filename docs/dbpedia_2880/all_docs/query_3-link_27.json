        "text": "There's a good collection of the classic Doom games, including Final Doom and The Master Levels, called Doom Classic Complete.\n\nI also love the Soldner-X games, Amiga style euroshmups. Very German and very fun.\n\nTeam 17 also put out a great collection of classic Alien Breed games on the PS3 and Vita, it's just called Alien Breed (there was a reboot in the late 2000s called Alien Breed Impact/Assault/Descent, which are also on PS3. Not as good but decent too, those three are also part of a collection called Alien Breed Trilogy on PSN).\n\nDatura if you want some weird experimental Demoscene stuff, and Thexder Neo if you want a remake of a pretty unique late 80s mech platformer where you can transform into a plane.\n\nNot sure what you have in your collection so im going to name some big games as well:\n\nThe infamous games and DLC where good.\n\nthe Uncharted games\n\nThe Last Of Us\n\nSuper Stardust HD\n\nI think you can still buy Demons Souls on PSN, but the online is turned off now\n\nThe Sly collection i believe is till stuck on the PS3 so you might as well\n\nThe Ratchet & Clank and Jak and Daxter collections are worth looking into\n\nIco and Shadow of the colossus collection\n\nMetal Gear Solid 4 and the HD collection if your into those games, and also stuck on ps3\n\nMotorstorm games are worth looking into\n\nKillzone 2 and 3 where ok. But shooters being shooters i don't know if they still hold up.\n\nPeople dig Tokyo Jungle, which i haven't personally played but is also stuck on ps3 and is usually recommended\n\npuppeteer is another game i haven't personally played yet but people talk about\n\nand there are a good bit of ps1 and ps2 games on there, but i don't think there is anything special about them so you might not want to spend your money on the PSN versions.\n\nIm sure there are alot more but that's what i got off the top of my head. I would also recommend using a site like this to browse the store and find what you want first, because the last time i used the PSN store on ps3 it was basically broken. So find stuff on google and such, then just search the store.\n\n@blergh: Hey, I just played through both the echochrome games recently, they are a lot of fun. I totally forgot the sequel was PS Move required. But luckily I had that set up already because I boot up some of the light-gun games on PS3 here and there. (of which it actually has a pretty solid library!).\n\nMy obscure PS3 download recommendation is Mamorukun Curse! , I don't think it came out on any other platforms in the West. It's only 5 bucks, and a fun shoot-em-up in the vein of something like Pocky & Rocky . It's a G. Rev game, so you know it's legit!\n\nA couple standouts on my ps3:\n\n-Renegade Ops\n\n-Tokyo jungle\n\n-Resident evil code veronica x (HD?) is still the most high res version available if im not mistaken. And has some dynamic lights added and stuff. Its not like the one on ps4.\n\n-The last guy\n\n-Dark mist\n\n-Battlefield 1943 is still online and active on ps3!\n\n-Far cry 3 blood dragon\n\n-Both bionic commando rearmed games. The first is the best but second one is fun too if it isnt too expensive.\n\n-Shank 1+2\n\n-Outland\n\n-Hard corps: uprising\n\n-Tales from space: about a blob & blobs attack\n\n-Stacking\n\n-Shatter\n\n-Virtual-On hd (Japan psn store)\n\n-Raystorm hd (Japan psn store)\n\nBut it might be worth being aware of \"the c-bomb\" of the ps3 if you're planning to still purchase games for it online. if anyone doesnt know what it is: Hikikomori media on youtube has a couple great videos on the subject.\n\nAnd saw someone mentioning demon souls not being able to be played online anymore...thats not entirely true. You only have to input a specific dns adress in your ps3 network setting and you can still play online through a fanmade server.\n\nSame goes for a bunch of different games, last I checked there was a \"beta\" to get warhawk up and running again in that way as well. Warhawk was so good. Some of the best multiplayer fun ive had."
