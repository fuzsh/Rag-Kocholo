        "text": "PlayStation Plus Premium is a revamped version of Sony's subscription service, which is turning into more of a Netflix-style service providing access to hundreds of games for a flat monthly fee.\n\nThe service covers every PlayStation console - from the original PS1 to the PS5, as well as the PSP and, thanks to streaming, PS3 support.\n\nNow available in all territories, at launch, the roster appears to be omitting some iconic franchises - there's no Gran Turismo, for example - but there are plenty of classics from all generations to discover - from Jumping Flash!, Ape Escape and the Jak series in the early years, through to Demon's Souls, Returnal and Miles Morales on PS5.\n\nThird party games will be available too - including access to a \"curated\" version of the Ubisoft+ subscription.\n\nWhat follows is the currently available PlayStation Plus Premium games list - with notable games from other regions listed and noted as such. New Extra / Premium games will be available in the middle of the month, while Essential tier games available on the first Tuesday of the month.\n\nOn this page:\n\nNew PS Plus games coming this month\n\nPS5 games list\n\nPS4 games list\n\nPS3 games list\n\nPS2 games list\n\nPS1 games list\n\nPSP games list\n\nPS VR2 games list\n\nUpcoming PlayStation Plus games in 2024\n\nPrevious PlayStation Plus game releases\n\nEssential, Extra and Premium tier differences, prices\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies.\n\nWhat games are coming to PlayStation Plus Premium, Extra and Essential in August?\n\nHere's the PlayStation Plus Premium, Extra and Essential game lineup for August 2024:\n\nPlayStation Plus Premium and Extra games for August 2024:\n\nWe'll add these when they're announced!\n\nEssentials games for August, which all PS Plus members have access to:\n\nEnder Lilies: Quietus of the Knights (PS4, available Tuesday 6th August to Monday 2nd September)\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's Security Breach (PS4, PS5, available Tuesday 6th August to Monday 2nd September)\n\nLEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga (PS4, PS5, available Tuesday 6th August to Monday 2nd September)\n\nClassics during August, which PlayStation Plus Premium members have access to:\n\nWe'll add these when they're announced!\n\nPS5 games available on PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium\n\nAs part of the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers, the following PS5 games are available:\n\nAfter Us (added June 18th, 2024)\n\nAlex Kidd in Miracle World DX (added September 20th, 2022)\n\nAnimal Well (added May 9th, 2024)\n\nAnno 1880 (added June 18th, 2024)\n\nApe Escape Academy (added October 17th 2023)\n\nAssassinâ€™s Creed Valhalla\n\nAssetto Corza Competizione\n\nBack 4 Blood (added January 17th 2023)\n\nBassmaster Fishing (added on April 18th, 2023)\n\nBen 10: Power Trip (added December 20th 2022)\n\nBlade Dancer: Lineage of Light (added on May 16th, 2023)\n\nBlood Bowl 3 (added on March, 19th 2024)\n\nBorderlands 3 (added February 21st, 2023)\n\nBugsnax (added August 16th, 2022)\n\nBus Simulator 21: Next Stop (added on May 16th, 2023)\n\nCall of the Sea (added September 19th, 2023)\n\nChorus (added November 15th, 2022)\n\nCloundpunk (added September 19th, 2023)\n\nConstruction Simulator (added April 16th, 2024)\n\nControl: Ultimate Edition\n\nCricket 24 (added June 5th, 2024)\n\nCrime Boss: Rockay City (added May 21st, 2024)\n\nCris Tales\n\nCrisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion (added from Tuesday 16th July)\n\nCrusader Kings III (added June 18th, 2024)\n\nCursed to Golf (added August 15th, 2023)\n\nDave the Diver (added April 16th, 2024)\n\nDC League of Super-Pets: The Adventures of Krypto and Ace (added June 20th 2023)\n\nDeath Stranding Director's Cut\n\nDeceive Inc.
