        "text": "Over the last couple of years, PlayStation Plus has reinvented itself into a three-tiered membership. Similar to the likes of a streaming subscription; i.e Netflix, Disney+ etc, the higher the tier you subscribe to, the more benefits you acquire along the way.\n\nBut, what do each of the PS Plus tiers offer; and which one is right for you? That's exactly what we aim to answer in this handy guide, alongside clear answers on how to upgrade memberships, overall costs, included games, and more.\n\nNavigate To:\n\nUse these quick links to find the specific topic you're after!\n\nWhat's the Difference? PS Plus Essential vs Extra vs Premium\n\nWhat Games Are Included in PS Plus?\n\nHow Much Does PlayStation Plus Cost?\n\nHow to Upgrade PS Plus Tiers\n\nPS Plus Essential vs Extra vs Premium\n\nPS Plus Essential is the easiest to define, as it's what PS Plus has always been. Essential provides access to online play, cloud saves, three free games a month (though this month has seen the addition of a fourth game into the rotation), and discounts on the PS Store.\n\nMoving up a tier, to PS Plus Extra, youâ€™re getting new PS4 and PS5 games each month, alongside the slew of PlayStation content already available (around 400 games), and everything PS Plus Essential provides.\n\nIf you opt for the most expensive plan, PS Plus Premium, you're gaining additional access to PS1, PS2, PSP, and PS3 titles, on top of everything else the Extra and Essential tiers provide. You can also stream select PS5 titles from the PlayStation Plus catalog and get access to the Sony Pictures catalog for movies.\n\nIn summary; interested in playing more PS4 and PS5 games? Aim for the Extra tier. Feeling nostalgic? Go all out on the Premium tier. Just want to play online? Go for Essential; it's as simple as that. Here's an additional breakdown as well to make it even easier to understand.\n\nPS Plus Essential\n\nAccess online multiplayer\n\nCloud saves\n\nThree rotating, downloadable games per month\n\nPlayStation Store discounts\n\nPS Plus Extra\n\nAll Essential tier benefits\n\nAccess and download a catalog of up to 400 PS4 and PS5 games\n\nAccess games from the Ubisoft+ Classics collection\n\nPS Plus Premium\n\nAll Extra and Essential tier benefits\n\nPlayers can download or stream PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, and PSP games\n\nPS3 games are streaming-only\n\nPlayers can stream these back catalog games to a PS4, PS5 or PC\n\nTime-limited game trials\n\nStream select PS5 titles from the PlayStation Plus catalog\n\nAccess to the Sony Pictures Catalog\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nJump to Article Top\n\nWhat Games Are Included on PS Plus?\n\nIf you're interested in pure bang for your buck, you probably want to know what games you can access via a PS Plus subscription. For starters, PS Plus Essential members get rotating free games monthly, so keep an eye on updates to find out what games are up for grabs each month.\n\nBut, when it comes to PS Plus Extra and Premium, there's a whole slew of games to get stuck into. Some highlights include Returnal, God of War, Death Stranding, Ratchet & Clank, Spider-Man Miles Morales, Bloodborne, Red Dead Redemption 2, Demon's Souls, and plenty more as well. For a complete breakdown of what's available, feel free to browse the Extra and Premium collections on IGN Playlist.\n\nHow Much Does PlayStation Plus Cost? (As Of April 2024)\n\nPS Plus Essential: $9.99 monthly / $24.99 quarterly / $79.99 yearly\n\nPS Plus Extra: $14.99 monthly / $39.99 quarterly / $134.99 yearly\n\nPS Plus Premium: $17.99 monthly / $49.99 quarterly / $159.99 yearly\n\nJump to Article Top\n\nHow to Upgrade PS Plus Tiers: Essential, Extra, and Premium\n\nIf you're already a PS Plus Essential member, you may be wondering, can I upgrade to a different tier? Yes, yes you can. It's easy to do, simply navigate to the PS Plus page on your PlayStation console, or dedicated webpage, and select which tier you'd like to upgrade to; PS Plus Extra, or PS Plus Premium.\n\nWhen you upgrade, you'll be charged a fee to bring your current account in line with the cost of Extra or Premium. So, for example, if you've paid for a full year of PS Plus Essential already ($79.99), that will be discounted from the cost of upgrading to PS Plus Extra ($134.99) for a year. That means you'll pay just $55 to upgrade your membership and so forth.\n\nThe same principles apply to upgrading to Premium as well from either the Essential or Extra tiers. Just remember you'll then be on a new auto-renewal for your upgraded tier, so be sure to turn that off if you don't want to be charged the full $100-$120 this time next year.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay"
