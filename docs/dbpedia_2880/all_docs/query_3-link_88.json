        "text": "PlayStation 4 is officially ten years old. Well, almost. Time is a construct, true, but a decade has seemingly passed in an instant. Probably because the years have bled into one after playing God of War and Red Dead Redemption 2 far too much. Want to feel really old? There are people who can legally drink who’d call the PlayStation 4 a ‘retro’ games console. Sickening.\n\nBut whether you have the PlayStation 4 Pro, the original PS4 model (or Slim revision), or the PlayStation 5, you have access to the best console game library today. Not only does the PlayStation 4 have a hearty selection of AAA third-party games, but it also has a more consistently appealing selection of indie experiences that are just waiting to be rediscovered. And, for the time being at least, Sony are still releasing brand new titles for the console.\n\nHere are our picks for the 27 best PlayStation 4 games available today, including the greatest releases alongside some of the earliest gems still worth savouring.\n\nGran Turismo 7\n\nSony’s flagship racing game was released earlier this year to show exactly what the PS5 could do, so while you’ll miss out on some of the fancier graphical flourishes by playing on a PlayStation 4, it’s still the same glorious celebration of car culture underneath.\n\nIt’s still at the more serious end of the racing spectrum, but Gran Turismo 7 is surprisingly welcoming to those who don’t know their Nordschleife from their Nürburgring, with a comprehensive suite of assists that makes driving fun for everyone – and there’s not a parking ticket in sight.\n\nElden Ring\n\nWhile Elden Ring might not be easy to love if you’re unfamiliar with FromSoftware’s uncompromising approach to gameplay, those who enter the vast open-world of the Lands Between will be rewarded with one of the most richly realised environments ever committed to pixels.\n\nCreated in collaboration with Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin, Elden Ring is packed with breathtaking scenery, majestic locations to explore, and the kind of enemies that’ll stomp you in seconds if you’re not careful – but you can always go away and come back for another go when you’re more tooled-up. A punishing, if sometimes overwhelming, masterpiece.\n\nThere are few uncharted terrains in gaming. Sure, we all love bashing in zombie brains, but Trek to Yomi is unlike anything we’ve ever played – in a good way. Trek to Yomi is set in the days of the Japanese samurai, and you are a young ronin who must avenge the death of his master. So far, so samurai game. Where Trek to Yomi excels, though, is in its beauty. The game is truly magnificent to see and play, echoing the vintage aesthetics of classic Japanese films such as Seven Samurai, Rashomon and Yojimbo. The downside to Trek to Yomi is that the combat is fairly limited, which is frustrating when such detail has been taken in every other aspect. Still, Trek to Yomi is a playable slice of cinema, and an experience of its own.\n\nEverybody’s Gone to the Rapture\n\nWhere to buy Everyone’s Gone to the Rapture\n\nWe spend a lot of time in games dealing out death – as seen on this list! – but rarely any time at all ruminating about it. Or life, for that matter. So Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture is an anomaly in more ways than one.\n\nSee, everyone but you has suddenly vanished, and you’ll wander a sleepy English village reliving their memories as you try to piece together what happened. It’s minimally interactive but massively compelling."
