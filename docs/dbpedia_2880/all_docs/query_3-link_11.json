From Fallout 4 to Ghost of Tsushima, Sony’s subscription service has a ton of great video games.\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\n\nFeatured in this article\n\nSony released the PlayStation 5 well over three years ago, and gamers who initially duked it out to snag an early console may now have their sights set on the PS5 Pro upgrade model, rumored to launch later this year. Whether you have a PS5 or you’re still holding on to that dusty PS4, PlayStation Plus is a worthwhile video game subscription service. Even though longtime PlayStation devotees may have to really dig through the catalog to uncover a delightful surprise, new adoptees will revel in the available choices.\n\nThe three tiers of PS Plus are Essential, Extra, and Premium. Essential is the cheapest option; for $10 a month you gain access to online multiplayer and can download a couple of curated titles each month. The Extra tier is similar to Xbox Game Pass, and it’s the main focus of this roundup. You receive access to over 100 games for $15 a month with this option. Another $3 elevates you to the Premium tier, which mainly adds streaming access to classic PlayStation games.\n\nFor a deeper dive into this subscription service, check out our PS Plus explainer. Searching for even more PlayStation picks? We got you covered with this list of top-tier PS5 games.\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.
