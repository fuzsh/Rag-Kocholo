        "text": "I love the new update, It looks great! But there are so many things from the older version that i believe makes it better than the newer version. Being able to customize your profiles look by changing your cover image, profile color, and more was a huge deal for me. Customizing group chats was another cool thing. You can do it in the new version, but it has to be with more than two people. In the new version you canât do as much as the older version. profiles just look so dull to me now. When you start the app you can see what your recently played games are. When you go to your profile, you can also see what your recently games played are. I think thatâs unnecessary and boring. I preferred the old layout. Being able to see your friends, who youâre following, and followers was a lot better. Same goes with seeing friends profile. I really donât want to see just mutual friends. The whatâs new page was also removed. I thought that was a great way to see what your friends are up to. what games they started playing and trophies theyâre achieving. I love that you can download games to your console and make purchases though the app. Itâs a lot faster than doing it on console.\n\nHi, Iâm kind of new to gaming but I love your app so much, itâs easy to message people back instead of in game with the controller, easy to filter invite spamming to just your phone instead of popping up on the screen repeatedly while youâre in the middle of a game, but why Iâm writing this review.. one of the first Iâve ever written without ever being prompted nor asked how Iâm enjoying the app (kudos for that too!) is the capture gallery! I love how it saves the clips for a certain amount of time and you can easily just download them to your phone camera roll or send them as a message on play station! I make a lot of random gaming videos to post and the only issue Iâve come across is that they sometimes take days to actually load on the app and be âreadyâ, also (so I guess two things), I can only find the clips from the most recent game I played until I reclip in another game again and then those will pop up. It could be because I clip a lot, but there is an âotherâ folder at the top now, but it doesnât lead me anywhere. But overall, 5 stars of awesome for design and ease of use, yes some things are slower but probably one of the best social apps I have! Thank you!\n\n(Warning the grammar is not good) I know this is the app but idk how to make suggestions anywhere else so here I am I love this app and the PS everything great about it 5 stars but I would like yo add something if your interested so I know we have things to make your privacy feel more private and things like that but I would like to be able to select friends who and see my friends list of who I can trust and who I am comfortable with to see my friends list while I am still friends with them I donât want someone I donât trust snooping around my friends list and adding everyone I play with of my friends something just donât seem right there not that I care that they play with each other itâs just I donât trust em enough for them to be doing that they could be saying stuff that are not true about me for all I know so it would be nice to have a feature like that so I can b friends and see if they can earn my trust or wut not I think they have a feature like that on Facebook Iâm just saying it would be nice to have (thank you for making such a wonderful console and for always making PS a wonderful experience for all of us ð)"
