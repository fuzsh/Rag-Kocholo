        "text": "UPDATE: The remake of Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary has finally been properly announced, including a trailer and collector’s edition.\n\nAs expected Ubisoft merely jumped the gun by a few hours and they have made the first non-accidental annoucement of Beyond Good & Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition, following two previous slip-ups.\n\nThat means there’s not much new to learn now but the game is clearly a remaster and not a full remake, as it’s not been built from scratch but is instead an enhanced version of the original PlayStation 2 game, replacing the Xbox 360 era remaster from 2011.\n\nIt will be released on June 25 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, PC, and Amazon Luna but there’ll also be a standard physical edition and Collector Edition released by Limited Run Games later in the year – with pre-orders starting on July 12.\n\nThe remaster will run in resolutions of ‘up to’ 4K, at 60fps, and include new quality of life features such as autosave, the ability to skip cut scenes, and cross-save across all platforms.\n\nThere’ll also be a new speedrun mode, more than 20 new achievements, and an anniversary gallery including previously unseen art and videos.\n\nPerhaps most interestingly, the new treasure hunt quest will allow you to learn more about Jade’s childhood and offer links to Beyond Good And Evil 2, thereby confirming that game has not been cancelled.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nThe long-rumoured new remake of Beyond Good & Evil will be out on Tuesday, although the tweet announcing it has mysteriously disappeared.\n\nAlthough many leaks do come from inside sources, they’re often a result of mistakes by the publisher or their partners, with websites or YouTube channels being updated before they should.\n\nThat seems to be what has just happened with the much anticipated Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition, which was briefly advertised on Ubisoft’s Twitter account, before the tweet was deleted.\n\nAt time of writing, there’s no mention of it on their website either but the tweet did make it clear that the release date is Tuesday, June 25.\n\nWhy the tweet has been deleted, and why Ubisoft was leaving it so late to announce – considering they had their Ubisoft Forward showcase only last week – is a mystery.\n\nIt’s almost certain that the announcement was supposed to coincide with the Limited Run Games showcase at 7pm BST this evening. That sort of timing mistake is exactly the sort of thing that publishers often do.\n\nIt’s not even the first mistake Ubisoft has made with the game, after they managed to release an early version to some fans by mistake last year – which they openly acknowledged. That means that technically the game has already been announced.\n\nThe now deleted tweet revealed that the game will be released on ‘all formats’ and will feature new content including a treasure hunt, anniversary gallery, and a reorchestrated soundtrack.\n\nWebsite Gematsu saved a copy of both the logo and the reveal trailer, which you can see here.\n\nThe game will run at 4K and 60fps but the only real question is whether it’s a remaster or a full remake, although the trailer suggests it’s the former.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil was originally released for the PlayStation 2 era of consoles and while there’s been a sequel in development for over a decade now its fate has been a mystery for years now.\n\nIt’s never been officially cancelled but it’s also never been shown off in any substantial form, with many expecting that it would be canned once series creator Michel Ancel left the games industry.\n\nIt wasn’t at Ubisoft Forward and that means it may not be heard of again this year, although the best guess as to its fate is that Ubisoft will monitor how the remake does and make their decision on what to do about the sequel after that.\n\nEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, follow us on Twitter, and sign-up to our newsletter.\n\nTo submit Inbox letters and Reader’s Features more easily, without the need to send an email, just use our Submit Stuff page here.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our Gaming page.\n\nMORE : It’s been 15 years and Beyond Good And Evil 2 is still hiring concept artists\n\nMORE : Beyond Good & Evil 2 loses more staff as studio faces labour investigation\n\nMORE : Beyond Good & Evil 2 beats Duke Nukem Forever to become most delayed video game ever"
