        "text": "Established in 1999 as one of the earliest pioneers in the truly all-electronic payment industry, PSN's mission was to automate the recurring customer payment process by integrating the web-based PSN system with account management (now CIS) software. Our mission today, as it was then, is to bring efficiencies and cost savings to the payment and billing process for companies while providing their customers all of the payment options that technology provides now and into the future. We achieved widespread industry success by being adaptable; we customize services for each business to meet their specific needs. As a result, we now serve over 5,400 (and counting) business accounts. In 2020, PSN joined forces with InvoiceCloud, and together, we provide the industry's leading electronic payment and billing platform.\n\nSimply put, no matter how your customers initiate payments—online, mobile app, call-in, text, counter or field transaction, cash payment location, through their bank bill payment system, mailed check—by credit card, eCheck, eSavings, paper check, cash or money order—PSN’s payment system can capture the payment, route the payment, record the payment, deposit the money* and provide comprehensive real-time reports on the “who, where, what, when, how much” of the transaction. Most importantly, all payments are consolidated for one deposit, one posting to your software and one reconciliation report!\n\n​\n\n*Underlying money transmission provided by our partner bank.\n\nWe integrate our web-based solutions with over 90 (and counting) software companies. The PSN system was designed to easily integrate with any software that can import and export customer data for the automated posting of payments and displaying amounts due online, among other data exchanges. Exchange of data between our systems range from batch to real-time to tokenization. Contact us to see if we have already integrated with your software. We also work with website builders and print/mail companies to provide seamless services, if needed."
