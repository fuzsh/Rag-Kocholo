        "text": "The Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition might be releasing soon, if a PSN leak is to indicate anything.\n\nPS5 trophies for Beyond Good & Evil Anniversary Edition have surfaced, and a 1.01 patch for the PS4 version just appeared. This means that the game is ready on PSN's backend, just waiting to be launched.\n\nThe 1.01 patch includes additional features such as a speed run mode, autosave functionality, and anniversary gallery, as well as the ability to skip cutscenes. The patch also contains visual improvements like reworked textures and reworked 3D models.\n\nPlatforms were not officially announced, but the game is expected to launch on, PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox. Interestingly, Ubisoft didn't mention this game at all during its Ubisoft Forward event a few days ago.\n\nIt's possible that Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition could be a shadow drop for the upcoming Nintendo Direct, as president Shuntaro Furukawa already confirmed that there would be one in June. However, the exact date has not been revealed yet."
