        "text": "Why we suspend players\n\nWhen you create an account for PlayStation™Network (PSN), you agree to obey the PlayStation Network Terms of Service, which includes the Community Code of Conduct.\n\nIf you breach these terms we may temporarily or permanently suspend your account. For the most serious breaches, we may suspend your PlayStation console from accessing PlayStation Network.\n\nHow do I know if my account or console has been suspended from PSN?\n\nIf we suspend your account or PlayStation console, you will see an error code when attempting to sign in to PSN.\n\nWe usually email you explaining why you’ve been suspended and how long it will last. We send that to the email address associated with your account (your sign-in ID). Be sure to check your junk or spam folder for the email.\n\nIf you have not received a notification, please contact us for further information.\n\nWhen will my PSN suspension end?\n\nYou can access your account once your temporary suspension ends. You can see how long is left by checking the email notification from PlayStation Safety.\n\nCan I appeal my PSN suspension?\n\nEvery suspension on PlayStation Network is the result of a thorough investigation by PlayStation Safety staff. As a result, suspensions are final and cannot be appealed unless:\n\nYou have been suspended for an account debt. This will be lifted once you have paid off the balance. For more information, please visit the PlayStation Network suspension for account debt guide.\n\nWhat happens if my account or console is suspended?\n\nIf your account is suspended, you will not be able to access PlayStation Network. That means you will not be able to use some products and services, even ones you paid for.\n\nIf your console is suspended you will not be able to connect to PlayStation Network with any account.\n\nHow can I manage my subscriptions if my account is suspended?\n\nIf you are suspended, the following settings will not be available to you:\n\nAdd/Remove a Payment Method\n\nCancel Subscription.\n\nWe will never take payment for a subscription from an account suspended from accessing the network. If a subscription payment is due while your account is suspended, we will not attempt to take payment and your subscription (and any associated benefits) will lapse.\n\nIn the event that you would like to make changes to your subscription settings while your account is suspended, you will need to contact us."
