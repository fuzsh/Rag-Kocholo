Learn more\n\nSony's PlayStation Plus subscription service provides PS5 and PS4 owners with essential services, like online multiplayer, cloud save storage, and tons of downloadable games. Users can choose between three different tiers with monthly and annual payment options.\n\nPlans start at $10 a month, but to unlock access to the game library, you need a more expensive PlayStation Plus Extra ($15) or Premium ($18) plan. PlayStation Plus Premium also includes streaming on PS5, PS4, and PC, so you don't have to wait for games to install before you start playing.\n\nPlayStation Plus is a direct competitor to Xbox Game Pass, a service that has amassed more than 25 million subscribers and is often compared to Netflix for its large library of games and streaming capabilities. Check out our Xbox Game Pass vs. PlayStation Plus breakdown to see how the services stack up.\n\nTo help you decide whether Sony's subscription platform is worth the price of admission, we've put together a rundown of PlayStation Plus plans, features, and games.\n\nWhat is PlayStation Plus?\n\nPlayStation Plus is a gaming subscription service that launched in 2010 and then expanded with new plans in 2022; it's required to play most multiplayer games online on PS5 and PS4 consoles and to keep your game save data backed up in the PlayStation cloud.\n\nPlayStation Plus is available in three tiers: Essential, Extra, and Premium. The latter two plans give members additional features, including the ability to play hundreds of PlayStation games as part of their subscription.\n\nPlayStation Plus members also get access to free games every month that they can keep for as long as they're a member. Sony gives discounts and special offers to PlayStation Plus members in the PlayStation digital store as well.\n\nHow much is PlayStation Plus?\n\nSony offers three PlayStation Plus plans. The Essential plan starts at $10/month, while Extra starts at $15/month, and Premium starts at $18/month. All three tiers are also available at a discount if you choose to pay for three months or one year upfront. Sony's most recent price increase for PlayStation Plus came in September 2023.\n\nPlayStation Plus plans and prices\n\nWhat features are included with PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium?\n\nPlayStation Plus Extra and Premium plans include several additional features you won't find on the standard PlayStation Plus Essential plan.\n\nPlayStation Plus Extra offers up to 400 downloadable games for PS4 and PS5 along with the core services of PlayStation Plus, like online multiplayer, cloud saving, free games every month, and discounts on digital releases.\n\nPlayStation Plus Premium provides more than 300 classic games from the original PlayStation, PS2, and PlayStation Portable, along with more than 400 games for PS4 and PS5. PlayStation Plus Premium members are also able to stream some PS5, PS4, and PS3 games on PlayStation consoles and PC. Subscribers can also access a library of more than 100 Sony movies to stream on demand.\n\nWhat games are included with PlayStation Plus?\n\nSony's website has a full list of games included with PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium plans. The list includes multiple PlayStation exclusives like Horizon Forbidden West, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, God of War, Uncharted, and Ghost of Tsushima. Third-party titles are available, too, like Grand Theft Auto V, Resident Evil 7, and Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade.\n\nMore games get added to the PlayStation Plus catalog on a rolling basis. A game's inclusion in the library isn't always permanent, however, so some titles may be removed over time."
