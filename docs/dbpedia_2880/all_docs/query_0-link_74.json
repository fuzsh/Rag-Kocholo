        "text": "Ahead of Beyond Good & Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition's reveal, Ubisoft has quietly delisted Beyond Good & Evil HD from the Xbox store.\n\nSean Carey\n\nPublished 19 Jun 2024\n\nFollowtopics\n\nSean Carey\n\nIf you want to start unlocking the Beyond Good & Evil HD achievements and don't already own the Xbox action-adventure game digitally, you will now have to find a physical copy as Ubisoft has stealthily delisted Beyond Good & Evil HD from the Xbox store.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil HD removed from sale on digital storefronts\n\nAfter leaking late last year, Ubisoft will officially reveal Beyond Good & Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition at the Limited Run Games Showcase on June 20. Interestingly, the publisher seems to be wasting no time making sure players can only pick up this new version of the beloved action-adventure title when it releases, as it has now delisted Beyond Good & Evil HD from digital storefronts.\n\nThis means if you don't already own a copy of Beyond Good & Evil HD, you're going to need to pick up a rare physical copy of the game (Beyond Good & Evil HD was included in an Xbox Live Arcade compilation released on disc in the UK/Europe) if you want to unlock any of its achievements. It's worth noting here that you might already own the game via Games with Gold, as it was a GwG freebie back in 2016, so check your Xbox library.\n\nWhile it is a shame that this version of the game has been delisted from the store, especially without warning, the Anniversary Edition does sound promising. When the Beyond Good & Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition achievements leaked last year, so too did its store listing, which revealed that this new version will support improved visuals running up to 4K/60fps, enhanced audio, improved controls, and more.\n\nUpdate: After randomly disappearing from the Xbox 360 store, games such as Lego: Harry Potter: Years 1-4 and Harry Potter for Kinect have now been relisted on the storefront.\n\nIn other delisting news, Lego: Harry Potter: Years 1-4, Harry Potter for Kinect, and Need for Speed: Undercover were also quickly delisted from the Xbox 360 marketplace after originally being earmarked for discounts in a new non-backwards compatible Xbox 360 games sale. No warning or reason was given for these delistings, but we imagine it was down to expiring licenses.\n\nWritten by Sean Carey\n\nAvid Xbox and achievement fan, Sean has committed to playing the best RPGs, racing games, and first-person shooters Xbox Game Pass and his precious free time will allow.
