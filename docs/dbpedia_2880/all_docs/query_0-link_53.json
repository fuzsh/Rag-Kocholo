I myself had even guessed that this would cause a delisting due to similar cases from Ubisoft in the past, it’s just a shame we can’t have forewarning or a premonition for dates before these games actually disappear.\n\nQuoting that previous article here on the site – “Re-release projects like this are a common method for promotion to keep interest in the property/IP higher over time and serves of a reminder on how differing companies are at handling their legacy properties – as sometimes a publisher might even go as far as to remove older versions of a game from stores to force more interest in the newest version.”\n\nAbout the Game\n\nStatistics:\n\nGenre – Science Fiction, Action-Adventure.\n\nGameplay Format – Third person perspective, Single player.\n\nGame Modes – Story, No additional/alternate modes.\n\nGame Mechanics – Stealth, Puzzle solving, Melee combat, Picture taking, Vehicle piloting, Companion character commands.\n\nHardware Compatibility – Backwards compatibility – No enhancements (Xbox One, Xbox Series.)\n\nLanguages Supported: Text – English, Deutsch, Español, Français, Italiano, Nederlands.\n\nVoice – Exact same as text supported languages.\n\nInstall Size – 1.5 GB (GOG PC), 1.68 GB (Xbox), 1.5GB (PlayStation).\n\nLaunch Price – 800 Microsoft Points (Xbox), $10/£7.99 (GOG).\n\nAge rating – ESRB T (Teen) – Comic Mischief, Violence.\n\nPEGI 12 – Bad Language, Violence, Gambling.\n\nSubscription service availability – (PlayStation Plus, Pre-2022 version) Free to add to account, 3 November – 1 December 2015.\n\nPlayStation 3/Xbox 360:\n\nPSN Store description:\n\n“Beyond Good & Evil, the award-winning action-adventure game by Ubisoft, is back on PlayStation Network, now in High Definition graphics.
