        "text": "I keep receiving the \"You have lost connection to Playstation(TM) Network, online features will be unavailable\" error whenever I try to join online games. I have tried multiple game types, and still get the error.\n\nI have found that I can occasionally join matches by continually cycling through the error (i.e try to join a match, get the error, try to join another match, etc...), but this process can take up to 30 minutes before I can get in a match. I have also found that I get the error less frequently when trying to join a game that a friend is already in.\n\nThere does not appear to be any issues with my PSN connection, as I remain logged in and can access other PSN services such as party chat and the PlayStation store. However, I still receive the error regardless I'm in a party or not.\n\nI have forwarded the ports that were suggested on this site to improve battlefront connections."
