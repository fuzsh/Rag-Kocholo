        "text": "What does the Code of Conduct say?\n\nThe Code of Conduct sets out how we expect our players to behave on PlayStation Network. The Code of Conduct helps maintain safety and inclusivity on PlayStation Network, so it’s important to keep in mind that there are consequences if you breach it. Read it very carefully and abide by it whenever you go online.\n\nTo put our terms simply, remember to: be a team player, be kind, and be sensible. Don’t cheat, don’t threaten harm or violence, and don’t commit or advocate any illegal activity on our platform.\n\nRemember that any inappropriate, offensive, or threatening content you say, upload, or stream can be reviewed by PlayStation Safety. If the Safety team finds that you have breached the Code of Conduct, you may be suspended from PlayStation Network.\n\nAccount suspension\n\nAccount suspension means that you cannot use your account to access PlayStation Network. If you share a PlayStation system with other players, they can still access PlayStation Network on their accounts, as long as they are not suspended.\n\nWhat can I do if I am suspended from PSN?\n\nIn most cases you will receive an email explaining why you have been suspended and how long the suspension will last. If your suspension is temporary, you will be able to use your account once your suspension ends. To prevent a future suspension, remember to abide by the Code of Conduct whenever accessing PSN.\n\nFor suspensions related to payment reversals, or chargebacks, visit the following article:"
