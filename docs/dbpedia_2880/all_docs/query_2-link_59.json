PlayStation Network is down at the moment, meaning you are unable to access areas including signing in to your account or playing games online, and as far as we’re aware, this is not a result of any PSN maintenance today.\n\nLooking at the PSN status page, Sony has confirmed that Account Management, Gaming and Social, PlayStation Video, and the PlayStation Store are experiencing issues. At the time of writing, PlayStation Direct is the only category on the checklist that isn’t without issues.\n\nThe hardware manufacturer confirmed that the issues PSN started at around 3.46pm BST/7.46am PST, with users rapidly reporting PS5 network down errors.\n\nRelated Content – Upcoming PS5 Games 2024: The Best PS5 Games Coming Soon\n\nSony has confirmed it is aware of the problem and is working to fix these issues, so hopefully it won’t be before PSN is back up and running."
