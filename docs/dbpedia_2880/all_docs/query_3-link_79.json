        "text": "Detroit: Become Human\n\nLifelike androids have replaced the human workforce in the Detroit of 2038 – but these servants are starting to ask questions of their masters and learning to say “no”.\n\nPlay as three very different androids in a riveting story of moral dilemmas and difficult choices, created by the developers of Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.\n\nKey actions have significant consequences, shaping the fate of the androids and perhaps the entire city.\n\nThe Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series\n\nAs a zombie apocalypse hits the world, The Walking Dead begins with convicted criminal Lee Everett meeting Clementine, a girl terrified by what’s happening around her. What comes next, only you can determine.\n\nYour decisions have a profound effect on how the narrative unfolds and can mean the difference between life and death for many characters.\n\nThe Telltale Definitive Series contains all four seasons of The Walking Dead as well as the 400 Days DLC and spin-off title The Walking Dead: Michonne.\n\nObserver: System Redux\n\nKraków in 2084 has become home to corrupt corporations and their crooked empires. Play as an investigator, an Observer, one of the few people supposedly upholding the law.\n\nExplore a gritty cyberpunk world as neural detective Daniel Lazarski, played by Blade Runner star Rutger Hauer, who can hack into the minds of the city’s inhabitants.\n\nHunt down a killer by analyzing the final moments of their victims and enter a digital realm beyond our own to communicate with the deceased.\n\nThe Quarry\n\nAs the sun sets on the last day of summer camp at Hackett’s Quarry, its counsellors throw a party. There’s just one problem: hunting season has begun.\n\nAll your choices matter in this narrative adventure that has you controlling each of the nine counsellors – make the wrong move and the consequences may be fatal.\n\nBlood-drenched locals are a problem – but there’s something far more sinister out in the woods, and its hungry for counsellors who can’t keep their cool.\n\nOxenfree II: Lost Signals\n\nThe small coastal town of Camena is experiencing some very unusual phenomena.
