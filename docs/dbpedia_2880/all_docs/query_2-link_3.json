To sign in to PSN, you must have an account and an Internet connection.\n\nAfter you sign in once, you remain signed in until you sign out. You may be signed out at certain times, such as when there's a system software update or if there's a network outage.\n\nSign in with a passkey\n\nPasskeys are a password replacement that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across your devices.\n\nSign out of PlayStation Network on PS5 consoles\n\nGo to Settings > Users and Accounts.\n\nSelect Other > Sign Out.\n\nSign out of PlayStation Network on all devices\n\nIf you can't physically access your PlayStation console, you can sign out of all your devices by using Account Management online."
