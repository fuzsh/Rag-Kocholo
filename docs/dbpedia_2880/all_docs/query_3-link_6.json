        "text": "From God of War to Marvel's Spider-Man, the best PS4 games are a mix of genres, lengths, and difficulties. Since 2013, the PlayStation 4 has had great games!\n\nKes Eylers-Stephenson\n\nPublished 10 Aug 2024\n\nFollowtopics\n\nPlayStation 4Kes Eylers-Stephenson\n\nUpdate: It was inevitable — we've added GTA V to the best PS4 games for August 2024! Honestly, Rockstar Games' monster hit should've been here earlier.\n\nThe TrueTrophies team and the community have taken a look at the PS4 games list and put together a section of delightful games that offer a best-in-class selection of games on the PlayStation 4. So, these are the best PS4 games that are all available right now!\n\n29 best PS4 games, ranked\n\nBefore we get onto the games, we want to qualify our methodology. Editor Kes and Staff Writers Lee and Sean all have some experience with any given PS4 game. We're using that knowledge combined with each game's critical reception and our community reviews to build out the list.\n\nThe list is always growing too, so if you don't see your favorite, it might get added in the future!\n\nWithout further ado: TrueTrophies' list of the best PS4 games.\n\n29. Mass Effect Andromeda\n\nHere are the Mass Effect Andromeda trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 80-100 hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 7/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nI am aware of the flaws and issues that plagued Mass Effect Andromeda at launch and how many fans were disappointed in this sequel. However, years have passed and the patches have fixed its performance issues. Is it close to the original Mass Effect trilogy? No, that's why it is dead last on this list.\n\nHowever, Andromeda does have a vibrant world to explore and combat that shines. The story is decent without being grand like the original trilogy and Andromeda features interesting companions. Jaal, Peebee, and Vetra were all well-written and added a bit more depth to the game world. So, it's not perfect, but Mass Effect Andromeda is good enough to be here, without the special sauce that made the originals sing.\n\n28. Fallout 4\n\nHere are the Fallout 4 trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 70 hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 3/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, at the PS Plus Extra tier\n\nThis part of the list is reserved for legacy game franchises that should have done better. Here we are with Bethesda's Fallout 4 and its clunky base building, clunkier combat, and the clunkiest bugs — not the kind you shoot, mind. The kind that causes the game to crash, quests to fail, and the game to slow to a crawl.\n\nIn 2015, when everyone was raving over The Witcher 3, Fallout 4's standard just wasn't up to scratch. Nowadays, though, Fallout 4's lack of innovation is strangely refreshing. It's got wicked funny writing, a cool world, and plenty of possibilities for you out in the wasteland — that's more than enough for Fallout 4 to qualify as a success in our books!\n\n27. Driveclub\n\nHere are the Driveclub trophies\n\nTime to platinum: Currently unobtainable\n\nTrophy difficulty: —\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nNo game quite depresses us like the superb PS4 racer Driveclub. Released by Evolution Studios, the former PlayStation Studio behind the Motorstorm series, the arcade-sim blend of Driveclub was beleaguered by online issues. Evolution would be shut down, a Sony decision I firmly believe is among its biggest mistake of the PS4 era.\n\nWhat they shut down was a masterful driving game maker. With gorgeous graphics, perfect dynamic weather systems that truly altered the tracks you raced on, a great array of GT cars, and sound design from the heavens — Driveclub was better than Gran Turismo. Add in a handling model that just purred and it is no wonder it remains amongst the best racing games.\n\n26. Fall Guys Ultimate Knockout\n\nFall Guys trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 30+ hours (skill dependent)\n\nTrophy difficulty: 9/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No, but it's free-to-play\n\nFall Guys is like being woken from a long, drab nightmare. At first, I was disoriented — the colors, the music, and the somewhat alarming bean people. But then, when you see that coveted gold crown, it all clicks; we're just silly bean people having a silly time. Fall Guys is pure, simple, delirious fun and it remains brilliant for that.\n\n25. Kingdom Come Deliverence\n\nKingdom Come Deliverance trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 100+ hours (skill dependent)\n\nTrophy difficulty: 6/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nOur next pick, Kingdom Come Deliverance, is a messy RPG set in medieval Bohemia — a game where you have to teach idiotic protagonist Henry to read, to speak, to pick locks, and to fight if you want to get anywhere. It's not a perfect game, but it is full of more personality and character than many modern RPGs.\n\nThe story is modestly fantastic and it immerses you in the historically accurate world. The fact Henry comes from nothing and has no skills is narratively refreshing and makes gameplay rewarding. Kingdom Come Deliverence is a fan-favorite pick, but I think it is an underrated RPG that trounced many of the big names (Fallout 4 and Mass Effect Andromeda) in the PS4 generation.\n\n24. Detroit Become Human\n\nDetroit Become Human trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 20 hours (skill dependent)\n\nTrophy difficulty: 2/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, on PS Plus Extra\n\nIf you've played Heavy Rain and Beyond Two Souls, we think that PS4's Detroit Become Human is the cleanest and best representation of what this kind of video game can do. You follow three android characters through the slowly unraveling human and android sides of Detroit society, choosing your path through each moment.\n\nEach choice shapes the future, which pays off as you unravel the web of possibilities the story could have had for you by the end. There are tense scenes, emotionally ravaging scenes, and heart-pumping action set pieces and they all hit the mark because they are underscored by emotionally resonant writing and performances. Detroit Become Human is brilliant stuff.\n\n23. Wreckfest\n\nHere are the Wreckfest trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 20+ hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 3/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, on PS Plus Extra\n\nWe didn't know which route to take for our racer of choice: sim or arcade. Then we realized that Wreckfest exists and, despite its name, it strikes a perfect balance of seriousness and fun. One moment, you can concentrate on cornering speeds and braking zones, the next you are driving around with your bonnet sticking out of your rear bumper. Wreckfest is the racer to beat on PS4!\n\n22. Hades\n\nHere are the Hades trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 60-80 hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 6/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nIn Hades you play as Zagreus, the son of Hades, who is seeking to escape the confines of his father's realm in the Underworld. On his quest, Zagreus will be aided by his adoptive mother Nyx, the Gods of Olympus, and a few other inhabitants of the Underworld.\n\nHades is the winner of over 50 Game of the Year awards — just in case you were wondering why it was on this list. Hades provides some of the slickest hack-and-slash combat, a rich atmosphere to explore, and an engaging character-driven storyline. It's one of the best PS4 experiences you can have. So, go give it a try!\n\n21. Wolfenstein The New Order\n\nHere are the Wolfenstein The New Order trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 15+ hours (exploit usage dependent)\n\nTrophy difficulty: 4/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, on PS Plus Extra\n\nOf all the mind-blowing FPS games to get our blood pumping on PS4, Wolfenstien The New Order is the one. Featuring the hulking BJ Blazkowicz in the lead rejoining the fight against the Nazis in a steampunk-esque modern day. It's got meaty combat that effectively uses guns-blazing akimbo and stealthy savagery equally well.\n\nThe level designs are not only gorgeous but incredibly inventive and full of imaginative set pieces. Add in a story that, despite the ultra-violence in gameplay, has a surprisingly gruffly tender narrative at its heart. It manages to showcase the horror of the Nazi regime and allows you the cathartic destruction of it. Finally, with its great soundtrack and fantastic characters, you've got yourself one of the best single-player FPS' on PS4!\n\n20. Nier Automata\n\nHere are the Nier Automata trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 50+ hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 3/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nFor many, the PS4 era's most experimental period was found in Nier Automata. What genre is it? Well, we think it's a JRPG, but it's also a hack 'n slash action game. You see, it's also a bit of a platformer, text adventure, and shoot 'em up too, but don't worry about it — director Yoko Toro certainly doesn't care what genre is what, he just cares about fun.\n\nIndeed, this is a stunningly well-designed game with fun at its core. It also has a fantastic story that requires multiple playthroughs to understand. It's a unique entry for our best PS4 games list, but Nier Automata deserves its plaudits!\n\n19. Days Gone\n\nHere is the Days Gone trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 60+ hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 3/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, on PS Plus Extra\n\nThe critics got Days Gone wrong. Why? Well, our lead Decon St. John isn't the most friendly bloke in the zombie Freaker-infested Oregon world. That and the biker aesthetic probably put a few off, but for most, it becomes steadily more endearing as the game roars on. With its wildernesses, mountain ranges, and deserts — Orgeon is a breeze of fresh air.\n\nThe central narrative about Decon's journey in the apocalypse is sometimes overwrought and cliche, but it's utterly endearing. Then you have the bike — your modifiable horse that gives the game its most unique spin. It is a glorious beast you will come to love dearly. Days Gone deserves a place on this list as the underrated oddity of the PlayStation catalog.\n\n18. Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain\n\nHere are the Metal Gear Solid The Phantom Pain trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 150+ hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 5/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nLegendary creator Hideo Kojima's last game before his split with Konami, you owe it to yourself to play Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain. It's a game that isn't quite finished but what it does contain in story and gameplay is just outrageous. Taking place in an open-world Afghanistan, you'll find yourself in a sandbox with so much freedom you won't be able to drag yourself away from all the possibilities.\n\nFrom rain disguising footsteps to the time of night affecting how visible you are, small details have a big influence on how your intrusions into enemy camps go. The story is good while it is running, though it can be a bit absent. That leaves gameplay to do the talking in Metal Gear Solid V — just as the best of the PS4 games should!\n\n17. Batman Arkham Knight\n\nHere are the Batman Arkham Knight trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 40+ hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 5/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, on PS Plus Extra\n\nWhen people are reminded of Batman Arkham Knight's existence, they immediately feel the urge to go for another drive through the rain-slick streets of Gotham. The game is even more fondly remembered in modern times than it was at launch when players were needlessly hating the tanky Batmobile and twisty plot. Now, players can just appreciate the fact that Arkham Knight was another great outing for The Caped Crusader.\n\n16. Horizon Zero Dawn\n\nHere are the Horizon Zero Dawn trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 40+ hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 2/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nGuerrilla Games' near-perfection of the traditional Ubisoft-style open-world formula was realized in Horizon Zero Dawn. This action RPG-lite was a big step for the developer of the FPS Killzone series when it was released in 2017. With a deep story, beautiful graphics, and meticulous and smart creature designs — Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the PS4's best games.\n\nAloy isn't the most emotionally complex leading lady, but her straightforward, no-nonsense attitude has a unique charm. However, post-post apocalypse America shines with its dinosaur-like terraforming creatures. The combat is honestly some of the best around and has layer after layer of bow and arrow goodness to deconstruct. Horizon Zero Dawn game is a modern PlayStation classic, so get on this wild ride now!\n\n15. Tekken 7\n\nHere are the Tekken 7 trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 10 hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 3/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nBandai Namco gets your adrenaline pumping in Tekken 7 every time you pummel your foes in this high-octane fighting game. By successfully chaining together intricate combos you can keep your opponents juggled for maximum damage — a feeling of pure bliss when you manage to pull it off. Then you have the firey soundtrack which helps lift Tekken 7 into the stratosphere!\n\n14. Monster Hunter World\n\nHere are the Monster Hunter World trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 250+ hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 4/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, PS Plus Extra\n\nHunt, battle, loot, re-equip, and hunt again. Monster Hunter World and its game-changing expansion Iceborne are the perfect example of a simple gameplay loop that hides the deepest complexity just below the surface. The variety of weapons, armor, and monster designs here are well above anything else the series had put together.\n\nMonster Hunter's secret weapon is learning. You'll need to work out the strengths of your enemy, its hunting patterns, where it fits in the food chain, and how to wield the weaponry best suited for taking the beast down. You'll be watching, waiting, listening, and filling out compendium pages on beasts (literally). Yet, that is the perfection of Monster Hunter World and why it's so high on our best PS4 list.\n\n13. Devil May Cry 5\n\nHere are the Devil May Cry 5 trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 50+ hours (skill dependent)\n\nTrophy difficulty: 10/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nFor Devil May Cry 5 to come out 11 years removed from the previous numbered entry and not only retain the quality of DMC4 but to make substantial refinements and improvements to the series formula is like some kind of divine intervention. DMC5 finally shakes free from the constraints by bidding farewell to backtrack and puzzle labyrinths at long last. The results put action front and center to create a tremendous new high for the series on PS4.\n\n12. Ghost of Tsushima\n\nHere are the Ghost of Tsushima trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 60 hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 3/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, on PS Plus Extra\n\nGhost of Tsushima is mesmerizingly stylish with its presentation of feudal Japan under siege by the invading Mongols. The gameplay combines samurai action and stealth perfectly, with the 'stance system' for open combat proving to be an immensely smart design. The environments are gorgeous and look immense on PS4 (let alone on the PS5 as we noted in our Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut review).\n\nSucker Punch stripped out a lot of the HUD that has plagued modern open-world games and replaced it with environmental tells like the wind or a curious fox blazing a firey trail through swaying green grass. The story is decent enough, but not excellent, and I felt the game was a little too large for its good and didn't innovate on the actual open-world activities. Even so, this is a fantastic 60-hour epic and certainly one of PS4's best offerings.\n\n11. Final Fantasy VII Remake\n\nHere are the Final Fantasy VII Remake\n\nTime to platinum: 60+ hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 6/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, on PS Plus Extra\n\nFinal Fantasy VII was a game that defined the original PlayStation, representing a massive step forward in what was possible in video game presentation, story-telling, and production scale. In 2020, after over two decades of fan requests, Square Enix finally released the long-awaited Final Fantasy VII Remake.\n\nWhile it was never likely to redefine modern gaming as we know it today, it delivered tremendously well on reinterpreting the source material and translating that into a modern experience. Where the original showcased raw PS1 power, Remake manages to accomplish the same feat for the PS4.\n\n10. Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End\n\nHere are the Uncharted 4 A Thief's End trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 20+ hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 4/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, on PS Plus Extra\n\nUncharted 4 A Thief's End makes it to the list of the best games on PS4 with pirates, adventure, emotion, graphics, and even more incredible things. It's a little tricky to break down why Uncharted 4 is so special, but we think it's because it nails every incredibly high barometer the other games in the series set.\n\nIt then nonchalantly improves the combat and narrative with graphical upgrades. A Thief's End deepens the adventuring experience, rather than expanding it. The final chapter in the tale of Drake is nothing short of perfection.\n\n9. Grand Theft Auto V\n\nHere are the Grand Theft Auto V trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 200 hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 5/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nGrand Theft Auto V is one of those unanimously agreed upon 'all-time great games.' Rockstar Games' open-world heist action-adventure is in everyone's library at this point, which makes it hard to say anything unique about it. The story is amazing, the levels are creative and epic, Los Santos is iconic, and the gameplay systems are rock solid.\n\nWhile it was initially released on PS3, we think PS4 is where GTA V went from stratospheric success to galaxy-conquering accomplishment. The live-service features of GTA Online kept bringing strands of new content while fostering a violent community of criminals that, against all odds, makes for a fun place to be. Grand Theft Auto V is wholly great.\n\n8. Outer Wilds\n\nHere are the Outer Wilds trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 20 hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 4/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nOuter Wilds is going to be hard to justify to some players, but those who know, know. This is one of the greatest games of all time and a pinnacle of game design. You are an astronaut in a solar system with a dying sun. With every 20 minutes comes another time reset, waking you up over and over to an alien ship exploding above you.\n\nWhy have AAA graphics or a massive open world when all you need is top-tier environmental design, story-telling, and simple but effective puzzle mechanics? Outer Wilds works as a harmony by swelling and softening with the realization that you are solving something conceptually outstanding. This game is sensational and makes for the perfect indie inclusion on our list of the best PS4 games.\n\n7. Bloodborne\n\nHere are the Bloodborne trophies,\n\nTime to platinum: 60 hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 7/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, on PS Plus Extra\n\nAs the namesake of the Soulsborne genre, of course, Bloodborne is here. Compared to the Dark Souls series, the spirit of the game is in the more aggressive combat mechanics. The joy this game elicits when you get the combat flow and start unravelling the game’s world can be is second to none. Despite failing to conquer Bloodborne myself, I still come crawling back because I know it's simply one of the best games on PS4.\n\n6. God of War (2018)\n\nHere are the God of War trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 40 hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 4/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nGod of War is very good, isn't it? Kratos gets paired with his son, Atreus, in a world of the Norse rather than the traditional Greek mythology. It was a stroke of genius by director Cory Barlog as this semi-open world adventure nails its setting and themes as hard as Kratos' Leviathan axe satisfyingly slams into strange new enemies populating the world (and then returns).\n\nThe sense of scale is epic, the narrative is compelling, and the level design is utterly perfect. The one-take camera shot adds to the sense of this game being an event experience — denoting it as one of the purest cases of out-and-out video game fun on this list. Well, that cements its place as one of PS4's best games!\n\n5. Marvel’s Spider-Man\n\nHere are the Marvel’s Spider-Man trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 30+ hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 2/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nInsomniac’s effort makes good on every element of the Spider-Man power fantasy, from the cityscape web-swinging to the spidey-sense tingling combat. What stands out, aside from the stunning graphical fidelity and technical achievements of the game afforded to it by the power of the PS4, is how well-crafted and genuinely affecting the story of Marvel’s Spider-Man is. This is a must-play on the console.\n\n4. Persona 5 Royal\n\nHere are the Persona 5 Royal trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 80+ hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 4/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nJRPG fans, go and explore Persona 5 Royal's compelling story, engaging characters, over-the-top boss fights, insane enemy designs, an OST that slaps, and a slice-of-life element to keep you on your toes. You’ll need to complete two whole playthroughs to have a chance to witness everything the game has to offer. The entire time, you'll never be bored because there is nothing that Atlus hasn’t thought about when crafting this slick and stylish world of Persona 5.\n\n3. The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt\n\nHere are the The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 80+ hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 5/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nThe Witcher 3 Wild Hunt outclassed every other open-world fantasy RPG. The gravel-voiced Witcher himself, Geralt, hunts monsters on The Continent but is ostracised from the very communities that pay him to swing his sword about. He finds solace in the company of other outcasts, witches, witchers, and his semi-daughter Ciri.\n\nThe mystery takes you through wonderful quests, like the legendary tale of the Red Baron, an investigation across the islands of Skillige, and a gang battle for the streets of Novigrad and Oxenfurt. Underpinned by great dialogue and deep, compelling lore — we think nothing touches The Witcher's fantasy world.\n\n2. The Last of Us Part II\n\nHere are the The Last of Us Part II trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 30 hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 3/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nI think The Last of Us Part II is exceptional but it's by no means for everyone. Some of the narrative choices it makes fly in the face of the relationships you find solace in during the original. To the TrueTrophies team and I, The Last of Us Part II was a heartbreaking reminder of mortality — we are not superheroes of the apocalypse, but people attempting to live in a world filled with ghoulish creatures and the worse human beings.\n\nThis is a tale of the horrible things humans are capable of. So, if you want to pursue Ellie's journey, invest in that pathway to hell emotionally, and try and open yourself to the people who appear; you are going to get hurt. For our money, that is a brave and unique way to make a game.\n\nNaughty Dog flaunts cinematic prowess with a new level of motion capture and environmental design. The writing finds a new gear by being let off the leash, though the result is occasionally preachy dialogue that tries to shortcut 'show-don't-tell.' Even with mistakes, it surpasses nigh-on everything else. Throw in a great score and The Last of Us Part II stands above a generation as a controversial all-time classic.\n\n1. Red Dead Redemption 2\n\nHere are the Red Dead Redemption 2 trophies\n\nTime to platinum: 70 hours\n\nTrophy difficulty: 5/10\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 deserves to be front and center among the best games on PS4 — you just don't make games this next level unless you are Rockstar. To call it a 'story' would feel inadequate: this is the yarn of Arthur Morgan's life. The fading world of the old West and the reaction of those inhabiting that strange space are extraordinarily well realized.\n\nWhat sells it is the level of interaction. You can react to everyone and everything which creates emergent scenarios unlike anything I've ever played before (or since). If you so choose, just go and hunt, explore the glorious West, play poker or just journey for days and days ignoring the magnetic figure of Butch and his Van der Lind gang.\n\nWhy would you want to when that tale is so compelling? It has one of the best twists of all time, an unbelievable epilogue, and everything in between. Production values are through the roof. The music, graphical fidelity, writing, and all the other little bits that make a game work, are amped up to 11.\n\nFrankly, RDR 2 puts other open-world games to shame. Ever since I played it, I've not been able to go back to collect-a-thons, map-unveiling towers, and big onscreen markers denoting things of interest easily. Red Dead Redemption 2 is so good, it broke gaming for me.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 is the best PS4 game and one of the best games of all time.\n\nSo, those are our best PS4 games!
