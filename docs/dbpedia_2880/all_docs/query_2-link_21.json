        "text": "ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT\n\n1.1. Please read this entire agreement and indicate whether you accept its terms. It is a contract between you and Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC (\"SIE\"). Access to and use of PlayStation Network (“PSN”) is expressly conditioned upon acceptance of this agreement. You accept this agreement by creating an account for PSN (“Account”), by making a purchase on the PlayStation Store, or through any other use of PSN, or by continuing to use PSN after being notified of a change to these terms. If you do not agree to these terms, you will not be able to create an Account and will not be able to access PSN or its products or services.\n\n1.2. PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THE BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN SECTION 14. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED BETWEEN YOU AND SIE (AND ITS CURRENT OR FORMER AFFILIATES, PARENTS, OR SUBSIDIARIES), AND INFORMS YOU OF YOUR OPT-OUT RIGHTS.\n\nNOTE: Depending on where you reside, you may have rights under applicable local laws that cannot be limited or waived. Nothing in this Agreement limits any such rights under those local laws.\n\n1.3. To accept this Terms of Service and User Agreement and create an account for PSN, you must be at least 18 years of age and have reached the legal age of majority in the country in which your account is registered.\n\nIf you are younger than 18, or have not yet reached the legal age of majority in the country in which your account is registered, your parent or legal guardian must create an account for you and agree to these terms of service in order for you to use PSN. Before you begin to use your Account, ask your parent or guardian to explain these Terms to you. We also encourage you to review the PSN Rules at https://www.playstation.com/legal/psn-rules/.\n\n1.4. In addition to this Terms of Service and User Agreement (\"Agreement\" or \"Terms\"), the following terms apply and form part of your contract with us: (a) the System Software License Agreement, which governs the use of the software embedded in a PlayStation-branded device such as, but not limited to, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 4, or PlayStation 5 system (a \"PlayStation Device\"); and (b) all applicable Software Product License Agreements (which govern your use of PlayStation game, mobile, and application software developed to operate on an PlayStation Device). Copies of these documents can be found at www.playstation.com/legal. We may also require that you agree to additional content-specific or service-specific terms or policies (\"Usage Terms\") in order to access some services or products available on PSN. By accessing those services or products, you agree that the applicable Usage Terms become part of this Agreement and govern your access and use of them.\n\nACCOUNT CREATION, USAGE AND SECURITY\n\n3.1. All information provided during Account creation, and during the use of your Account, must be accurate and complete. We reserve the right to suspend, terminate or restrict any Account (including as stated in Section 12.2 of this Agreement) that uses or was created using false information, or that we determine was created or used for a purpose that violates this Agreement.\n\n3.2. During Account creation you must select the country or region of your residence and in which your account will be registered in. Once your account is created, you will not be able to change the country or region code associated with your account.\n\n3.3. All users should safeguard their Account sign-in ID (\"PSN ID\"), password, passkey, or other authenticating information and take steps to prevent access to your Account by other persons on any shared devices.\n\n3.4. If we believe your Account has been compromised, we may take actions to protect you and SIE. Such actions may include resetting passwords or revoking passkeys; canceling subscriptions; suspending accounts or restricting Account activities or access. We may also upload updates to your PlayStation Devices to stop unauthorized use of your Account or prevent PlayStation Devices from connecting to PSN.\n\n3.5. SIE has the right to deny the creation of any Account, for any reason, in its sole discretion.\n\n3.6. We may request identifying documentation or information from you as part of your Account creation (or at any time thereafter) in order for you to create an Account or for us to provide certain offerings, functionality, or features to you; if we have a reasonable suspicion of fraud, illegal activity, that your Account may have been compromised, or that you or your Account is in violation of these terms; to avoid harm to SIE, its affiliates, licensors, or players; or as may be required by law. We reserve the right to suspend, terminate, or restrict your Account and PlayStation Device, and your participation in or access to offerings, functionality, or features, if you do not provide such documentation or information, or based on our review of such documentation and information.\n\nCHILD ACCOUNTS AND PARENTAL CONTROLS\n\n4.1. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child who will access PSN, you are responsible for creating a Child Account for them. If you have more than one child, you will need to create a separate Child Account for each one. In order to create a Child Account, you will first need to set up an Account for yourself.\n\n4.2. A Child Account must meet certain age requirements. More information about creating and managing Child Accounts is available at www.playstation.com/support.\n\n4.3. Some content on PSN may be inappropriate for younger users. We offer a variety of settings which you can use to tailor a Child Account’s experience and activities on PSN as may be appropriate for their age (\"Parental Controls\"). Visit www.playstation.com/safety to learn how to set up Parental Controls.\n\n4.4. Parental Control features and restriction settings differ based on the device you use to access PSN, and are subject to availability, including availability in the country in which your Account is registered. Some content that you access on your PlayStation Device or via tablet, cell phone, or other device may be accessible by all users of that system or device, and Parental Controls on those devices may not apply to certain types of content.\n\n4.5. Parental Controls may allow you to restrict a Child Account’s access to certain rated game and video content by using restrict-content settings. However, not all content is rated, and Parental Controls may not apply to unrated content. In some cases, third parties provide the content ratings or descriptions for items, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of that information.\n\n4.6. Parental Controls allow you to set a monthly spending limit for Child Accounts. The default spending limit is zero. If you choose to increase the spending limit on a Child Account you are (a) representing that your child understands that they will be charged the listed price for any purchase they make; (b) agreeing that you approve their ability to make purchases through their Account; and (c) agreeing to pay for all purchases up to the approved monthly spending limit.\n\n4.7. Parental Controls set other restrictions for your child’s Account, including control of communication features and online accessibility. More information about Parental Controls is available through your Account settings pages and in our online user guides. Please visit our PlayStation Safety page at www.playstation.com/safety for information on what Parental Controls are available on your PlayStation Device.\n\n4.8. As the parent or legal guardian of a Child with an account for PSN, you are responsible for monitoring your Child's access to and use of PSN, as well as any communications made or received by your Child through PSN. You are also responsible for the use of your Account by your Children or others that may have access to your Account or PlayStation Device.\n\n4.9. You are responsible for explaining these Terms to your Child, especially the Community Code of Conduct in Section 5 (\"Code of Conduct\"), and ensuring they understand how to behave when interacting with PSN. If your Child violates these Terms, we may take moderation action against the Account, Child Account, or console (see Section 12 for more information).\n\n4.10. Your child can also review our PSN Rules at https://www.playstation.com/legal/psn-rules/. The PSN Rules do not contain the full Terms, but they highlight the most important parts for our younger users.\n\n√ Be respectful.\n\nWe know we can’t expect everyone to agree all the time. Disagree respectfully or walk away.\n\n☒ Do not do anything to harm the PlayStation brand or PSN community.\n\n√ Be responsible.\n\nIf you believe you have found a vulnerability in PSN products or services, tell us so we can fix it. Please visit HackerOne.com/PlayStation for information on our BugBounty program.\n\n☒ Do not use the PSN or any of its products for, or associate them with, spam or any commercial activity.\n\n☒ Do not share, buy, sell, rent, sublicense, trade, or transfer any accounts, account details, or other credentials.\n\n√ Be a team player.\n\n☒ Do not disturb or interrupt gameplay.\n\n☒ Do not cheat.\n\n☒ Do not use any bugs, glitches, vulnerabilities, or unintentional mechanics in products or PSN to get an advantage.\n\n☒ Do not phish for or harvest any accounts, account details, or other credentials.\n\n☒ Do not forward recommendations or offers to your contacts without their permission.\n\n☒ Do not share or send information that misleads others.\n\n√ Be discreet. Keep it decent.\n\nAlways use common sense and good manners. Things you say and do online affect other people and have real world consequences. Think before you post anything online. Beware that information you put online can spread and may be seen by people you didn’t expect would see it.\n\n☒ Do not reveal personal information about other people or yourself. It makes you and them vulnerable. Personal information includes, but is not limited to, social network handles, messaging app profiles, phone numbers, email addresses, and real-world addresses like your home, school, or temporary location.\n\n☒ Do not share material that is pornographic, obscene, or that depicts extreme or abhorrent violence.\n\n☒ Do not share or threaten to share any image or other media of another person without their consent.\n\n√ Help us ensure PSN is the best place to play.\n\nWe are committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment. If you breach this Code, or your conduct off PSN gives us reason to believe you may endanger the safety or well-being of our community, we may take any action as reasonably necessary to protect PSN and our players.\n\nIf you believe someone has breached the Code of Conduct, tell us so we can take action to help keep PSN and our community safe. It is particularly important to tell us if you think there is a risk anyone could get hurt in real life. If you see someone else misbehaving:\n\n√ Report them to us using our contextual grief reporting tools. For more information on grief reporting and blocking, please visit playstation.com/reporting and playstation.com/blocking.\n\n√ If you engage with them, stay calm and respectful. Lead by example and don’t breach this Code yourself.\n\n☒ Do not submit false grief reports or otherwise abuse the grief reporting system.\n\n√ Follow any specific rules for each product.\n\nFor more information, find additional resources at playstation.com/safety and playstation.com/behavior.\n\n5.2. We are not responsible for monitoring or recording any activity or communications on PSN, although we may do so in order to investigate violations of or enforce this Agreement, or to protect the rights and property of SIE, its partners, and customers. We are not liable for any violation of this Agreement by you or by any other PSN user. Violations of our Code of Conduct may result in moderation action taken against your Account and PlayStation Devices (see Section 12 for more information). We may also notify law enforcement (or another appropriate government agency) if the breach involves a threat to the life or safety of yourself or others, or any other activity that we believe to be unlawful. If you are rude to, or abuse or threaten, our employees, agents, or representatives, in addition to any other actions we may take under this Agreement, we may restrict you from contacting us by email or refuse to provide you with any further consumer support.\n\nPLAYSTATION STORE\n\n8.1. Access and Use. PlayStation Store is where you can buy digital games, subscriptions, virtual currency, and other digital content. You can pay for purchases on PlayStation Store using PSN Wallet funds or any other current, valid payment method we may identify as acceptable on the Store, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include payment through your account with a third party (an \"Approved Payment Method\"). You must be signed into your Account to complete your purchase. If you delete or close your Account, you may lose access to and use of any purchased Content.\n\n8.2. Account Linking. If a third party publishes a Product you purchase, you may need to associate or link your account for PSN to an account with that third party to use that Product. The Product may become linked to that third-party account as well as the purchasing account. If you unlink the third-party account from your account for PSN, or if your third-party account is closed or deleted, you may lose access to the Product.\n\n8.3. Purchase Terms. By completing a transaction through your Account or allowing a transaction to take place through an associated Child Account, you are (i) agreeing to pay for all transactions made by you or your children; (ii) authorizing SIE to deduct from the Wallet and charge your Approved Payment Method all fees due and payable for all your transactions; and (iii) agreeing to the terms of this Agreement, including any applicable Usage Terms or Third-Party Terms associated with use of the particular Product. All transactions may be deemed to be governed by law and regulatory requirements applicable at the time the transaction was completed.\n\n8.4. No Resale or Commercial Use. You must be an end user to purchase from PlayStation Store. Resellers, as determined by us in our sole discretion, are prohibited. When you order Content from PlayStation Store, you buy a personal license to use that Content for private, non-commercial use. That license is not transferable unless your local applicable laws say it must be. This means you can use a Product in the ways described in the license, but do not own the Product.\n\n8.5. Cancellations and Refunds. All purchases from the PlayStation Store are final and non-refundable except as stated in this Agreement or the then-current PlayStation Store Cancellation Policy (found at https://www.playstation.com/legal/cancellation-policy).\n\n8.6. Pre-orders and Bundles. You may have the option to order certain Content in the form of bundles (such as seasons of television series) or a pre-order. You will be charged for the Content at the time of the order, but some of the content may not be available until the listed release date.\n\n8.7. Safeguarding Payment Transactions. To help protect your Account from unauthorized payment transactions, you may have the option to enable an Account setting that requires a password or other authentication methods, such as passkey, to complete payment transactions on some devices. As applicable, enable this function to prevent others who may use the same device from being able to make purchases or access your payment information. However, enabling some authentication methods may consequently disable \"Require Password at Checkout\" and your current 2-step verification (such as through your authenticator app or SMS), or require additional information to authorize and complete the transaction. We have no liability for any unauthorized usage of any Account.\n\n8.8. Fees and Other Charges. You are responsible for all bank fees related to any transactions or failed transactions (e.g., chargebacks from your bank or credit card provider) initiated by you or your children, including domestic and international transaction fees. We may suspend your console or Account (including any associated Child Accounts) for failure to pay transaction fees. We may also elect to provide a mechanism by which you fund the wallet associated with your Account to prevent your Account (and any associated Child Accounts) from being terminated.\n\n8.9. Price Drops and Errors. The price applicable to your transaction will be the price that was in effect at the time of the transaction. If the price for any content or services you purchased temporarily or permanently drops, you will not be entitled to a refund (unless your purchase independently qualifies for a refund under the PlayStation Store Cancellation Policy).\n\nIf we discover an error in the price of items you have ordered, we will contact you. You will have the option of either reconfirming your order at the correct price or canceling it. If we are unable to contact you, your order will be automatically cancelled.\n\n8.10. Sales Offers and Promotions. We may conduct promotions that offer discounts when you purchase certain items or purchase multiple qualifying items. Promotional offers may be subject to additional terms and conditions. Special products and sales prices and promotions are no longer valid once they are changed or removed, or after any end date or time specified in the offer.\n\n8.11. Subscriptions. We may offer you the opportunity to purchase subscriptions (which may also be referred to as “memberships” or “services”) that provide access to certain content, products or services for a specified period of time. If your subscription is ongoing and renews automatically, you will be charged the applicable subscription fee automatically, at the frequency you chose at purchase until you cancel. If your wallet doesn't have enough funds when an automatic recurring subscription payment is due, the balance will be automatically funded from your default Approved Payment Method on file to cover the subscription fee.\n\nUpon cancellation of a subscription, you will not be able to access content or services provided with your subscription except as permitted by us. Content that you downloaded onto a device and that was provided to you through a subscription at no additional cost beyond the subscription price may not be accessible. Gameplay information, including trophies earned during a trial offer, promotional period or subscription term may not be available. Further information about managing your subscriptions is available at www.playstation.com/support.\n\nSubscriptions may come with their own Usage Terms and/or Privacy Policy. Please make sure to read these agreements carefully before you subscribe.\n\n8.15. Transaction Records. You may make transactions only with the designated SIE regional company that is determined by the country/area of residence to which your account is registered. Your country/area of residence may be verified by your credit or debit card number and may be rejected if the information does not match. Please retain any transaction related communications we may send to you. Your transaction history is also available in your Account management areas.\n\n8.16. Access to Purchased Items. Upon our confirmation of your transaction, and subject to the applicable Usage Terms, you may access the PSN Content you ordered through the Account that you used to complete the order. You bear all risk of loss for accessing the content, and for any loss of content you have downloaded, including any loss due to a file corruption or hard drive crash. You are solely responsible if you do not choose to download or access the content before it is removed or your license expires, and for the authorized ongoing storage and safekeeping of the content. We are not obligated to provide you with replacement copies for any reason.\n\n8.17. Payment Methods. If you have funds in your PSN Wallet, you may use those funds to complete a purchase or renew a subscription. If you do not have enough funds in your Wallet to complete a transaction, we may automatically charge your Approved Payment Method for the balance necessary to complete the purchase.\n\nWe participate in account update services offered by some banks to help keep your payment cards up to date on your Account. Where you have added a payment card as a payment method to your Account and if your bank participates, we may automatically update your card number or expiration date in our system when your card expires. Following any update, we will continue to charge the applicable payment methods to any purchases you make unless you notify us otherwise. You can opt out of the automatic update services by contacting your bank.\n\nYou can update your Approved Payment Method in Account Settings. We may also update your Payment Method ourselves, using information provided by our payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s) for any active recurring subscriptions or new transactions.\n\n8.18. Purchases from direct.playstation.com. Purchases of hardware, peripherals, disc games and other products sold through direct.playstation.com (“PS Direct”) are not purchases made from the PlayStation Store. They are transactions made with Sony Interactive Entertainment America Trading LLC, and are subject to the PS Direct Terms of Sale (found at: https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/terms-of-service) and PS Direct Returns and Refund Policy (found at: https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/returns-refund-policy). To the extent there is any conflict between this Agreement and the PS Direct Terms of Sale, the PS Direct Terms of Sale shall govern with respect to any transactions made with PS Direct.\n\n8.19. Inaccuracy Disclaimer. From time to time there may be information on the PlayStation Store, and related PlayStation websites, that contain errors, inaccuracies, or omissions that relate to product descriptions, pricing, offer terms, and availability. We reserve the right to correct any such errors, inaccuracies, or omissions and to change or update such information at any time without prior notice to you.\n\nVIDEO CONTENT\n\n11.1. Video Content includes any recordings or live streams of sports, music concerts and other entertainment events, television shows and movies made available for rental, purchase, or free viewing through PSN.\n\n11.2. Video Content is made available to Account holders in select territories for your personal, private, non-commercial viewing in your authorized territory, using a limited number of PlayStation Devices or other devices (“Authorized Devices”) during an authorized viewing period (\"Authorized Term\"). Availability of Video Content is subject to change at any time without notice to you.\n\n11.3. Video Content may be made available to you as a live or near-live stream (\"Live Stream Content\"), as a licensed copy for rental for a limited duration (\"Licensed Rental Content\"), a licensed copy for an indefinite duration (\"Other Licensed Content\") or as a licensed stream supported by advertising or promotional materials that may be for a limited duration (\"Ad Supported Content\"). Video Content is subject to digital rights management rules and are subject to other restrictions and limitations depending on the type of Video Content or the Authorized Device you use to access Video Content. Some of these restrictions are described below. More information about these restrictions and accessing Video Content is available at www.playstation.com/support.\n\n11.4. Live Stream Content. Live Stream Content comprises live or near-live transmissions of Live Events. When you access Live Stream Content, you may not be able to view any part of the Live Stream Content that occurred prior to the start of your viewing. We have no control over the start and finish time of a Live Event; the duration of a Live Event; the content of a Live Event (including the availability, quality or suitability of the content or that it complies with applicable law); or that the Live Stream Content be delivered uninterrupted, error-free and without fault or delay.\n\n11.5. Ad Supported Content. Ad Supported Content is Video Content that contains or is displayed with advertising, marketing or other promotional materials (together, the \"Promotional Materials\"). Ad Supported Content may be limited such that it is accessible by only one Authorized Device at any one time. Promotional Materials may be displayed in or around Ad Supported Content by any means selected by us or its Ad Supported Content Partners (defined below). You acknowledge that Ad Supported Content may include, comprise or be displayed with Promotional Materials that may delay or interrupt its playback. We may prevent you from skipping or manipulating the display of Promotional Materials, and, if so, you may not attempt to access Ad Supported Content in any manner not prescribed by us. We do not endorse any third-party advertising or promotional material (including the Promotional Materials) associated with Ad Supported Content in any manner and give no warranty or other assurance in relation to any products or services featured in these advertisements and promotional materials.\n\nCertain Ad Supported Content may be hosted or delivered to you by or through third-party licensors, providers or partners (\"Ad Supported Content Partners\"). We have no control over the content hosted or delivered by the Ad Supported Content Partners (including all associated Promotional Materials, corresponding meta-data, artwork and other peripheral materials). We cannot guarantee that their content will be complete and accurate, comply with applicable laws, correspond to its description, be suitable or appropriate for a particular age group, or be delivered uninterrupted, error-free and without fault or delay.\n\n11.6. Licensed Rental Content. Licensed Rental Content is subject to restrictions regarding when playback can be initiated post purchase, and once initiated, the time period during which Licensed Rental Content can be accessed (\"Rental Terms\"). Licensed Rental Content can only be viewed within the time periods specified in the Rental Terms. The Rental Terms differ based on the type of Licensed Rental Content and the Authorized Device you use to access the Licensed Rental Content. Please review carefully any product descriptions, the Rental Terms, and any applicable Usage Terms made available for each Licensed Rental Content prior to finalizing your rental payment.\n\nYou may select the Authorized Device on which you want to view your Licensed Rental Content, but you may view it on only one Authorized Device at a time, and in some cases on a limited number of Authorized Devices. Licensed Rental Content is also subject to restrictions regarding transferability between Authorized Devices. Once playback of Licensed Rental Content in a particular format has started on an Authorized Device, you may not be able to view that content using any other Authorized Device without a separate license payment.\n\n11.7. Other Licensed Content. Other Licensed Content may be downloaded or streamed to Authorized Devices. For Other Licensed Content that is downloaded, you may be able to view that content for a limited number of times on certain Authorized Devices only. For Other Licensed Content that is streamed, you may be prohibited from streaming multiple titles of Other Licensed Content or multiple streams of a single title of Other Licensed Content from your Account at any one time. After ordering Other Licensed Content, we encourage you to immediately download the content, where supported, on all Authorized Devices on which you may want to later view it. In some cases, Other Licensed Content may not be available for subsequent copying or downloading to additional Authorized Devices. Access to Other Licensed Content that has been purchased may also be subject to compatibility between the Authorized Device and the video format of the Other Licensed Content, continued availability to the Other Licensed Content from our third-party licensors, and other applicable restrictions.\n\n11.8. Technical Requirements. Delivery of and your access to Video Content are dependent on variables not under our control, including the speed and availability of your broadband or network connection, compatibility between the format of the Video Content and the Authorized Device you use to access that Video Content, availability of Video Content from our third-party licensors, and any applicable restrictions that may be imposed on the Video Content from our third-party licensors. SIE is not responsible for any delays or technical difficulties in downloading, streaming, or viewing the Video Content related to these variables. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OR CREDIT FOR ANY DOWNLOADED OR STREAMED CONTENT THAT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO VIEW OR HAVE DIFFICULTY VIEWING DUE TO THESE UNCONTROLLABLE VARIABLES, UNLESS THE CONTENT IS FAULTY OR UNLESS THE LAW REQUIRES OTHERWISE.\n\nYou bear all responsibility for ensuring that you have the capabilities to view Video Content in the appropriate format, or at all. Please carefully review any Usage Terms and descriptions of Video Content made available to you before making any rental or purchase. Output of Video Content in certain formats may require additional equipment that is sold separately.\n\n11.9. Proper activation of a supported Authorized Device by the Account that ordered the Video Content is required to download, stream or view the content. Video Content is connected to the Account used to order that content and cannot be transferred from one Account to another. Each Account can activate no more than the maximum number of Authorized Devices, and each Authorized Device can only be activated for a limited number of Accounts.\n\nACCOUNT TERMINATION, CONSOLE SUSPENSION, AND OTHER REMEDIAL ACTIONS\n\n12.1. Termination by You. You may terminate your Account at any time by contacting PlayStation Support. The best way to request closure of an Account is by going to: support.playstation.com/livechatrequest. Please have the following information readily available: (a) Sign-in ID (email address); (b) PSN ID; and (c) account security information.\n\n12.2. Suspension or Termination by SIE. With or without notice, we may restrict, suspend or terminate your PSN Account and PlayStation Device, or indefinitely restrict, suspend or discontinue your access to or, or use of, certain PSN Content, offerings, features, products and services, if you violate this Agreement or we have a reasonable belief such a violation has or will occur, or as otherwise may be reasonably necessary to protect our PSN users, our partners, our platform, or other SIE interests.\n\n12.3. Effect of Account Termination. After your Account is terminated, you will not be able to access PSN. Any game ranking, scores, trophies, Virtual Items, including virtual currency balances (whether earned or purchased), subscriptions, or other information saved on, or requiring connection to, PSN will not be retained or accessible. Account termination is irreversible.\n\nUPON TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT (OR ANY ASSOCIATED CHILD ACCOUNT) FOR ANY REASON, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND FOR ITEMS (INCLUDING SUBSCRIPTIONS, VIRTUAL ITEMS, AND PRE-PAID PRODUCTS OR SERVICES), VALUE ACCUMULATED ON IN-GAME ITEMS OR ANY UNUSED BALANCE IN YOUR WALLET, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW OR AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n12.4. Effect of Account Termination on Child Accounts. Generally, termination of a Family Manager Account (i.e., the Account of an adult who creates a Child Account) will result in the termination of any associated Child Accounts. However, in some cases,\n\nwe may permit your associated Child Accounts to remain open. In those cases, you will remain liable for all their acts and purchases until the Child Accounts are terminated. Parental Control settings placed on Child Accounts prior to the termination or suspension of your Account will remain in place, and the Child Accounts will be permitted to use the remaining funds in your PSN Wallet subject to any limits that were put in place prior to your Account termination. However, you will not receive any correspondence from us about the Child Accounts’ activities or purchases.\n\n12.5. Console Suspension. Upon suspension of your PlayStation Device, you will not be able to use that console to (a) access PSN with any Account (even if you create a new one); (b) play any games or game modes requiring online access; or (c) access any content purchased from the PlayStation Store. You will still be able to play any disc games that run on your console, if they do not need to connect to PSN to run.\n\n12.6. Other Remedial Actions. If we determine that you or any of your associated Child Accounts have violated this Agreement (including the Community Code of Conduct, the Usage Terms, or any other incorporated terms), or that your actions have injured or damaged SIE or the PSN community, we reserve the right to take any action we believe necessary to remedy the violation or to protect SIE’s interests, including: (a) the automatic removal or blockage of content associated with those Accounts; (b) implementation of upgrades or devices intended to discontinue unauthorized use; (c) the permanent or temporary disablement of access to any PSN Content, PlayStation Devices, products, services or features; (d) notifying law enforcement or the appropriate authority; and (e) initiating legal action.\n\nWARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\n17.1.
