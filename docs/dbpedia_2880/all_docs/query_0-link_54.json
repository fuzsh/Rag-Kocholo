        "text": "With Beyond Good & Evil’s freshly-minted 20th Anniversary Edition out today and bringing the 2003 action-adventure classic onto new platforms with new features and a modest facelift, attention has no doubt turned to the state of Ubisoft’s long-gestating sequel, the appropriately titled Beyond Good & Evil 2.\n\nGiven that the follow-up was first announced all the way back in 2008, before disappearing and returning as a prequel project with an announcement at Ubisoft’s E3 conference in 2017, and given that 2018 was the last anyone in the public or media saw the game in any official capacity, and given that creative director, Emile Morel, sadly passed last year, it’s easy to see why there is a lot of doubt surrounding the development of Beyond Good & Evil 2 in 2024.\n\nThankfully, Ubisoft has come out to try and put some of those doubts to rest, dropping a call out to the game in the midst of a thread on X that’s otherwise dedicated to publishing more information around the release of Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition.\n\nIn the post, the official Beyond Good & Evil account simply writes:\n\n“Yes, Beyond Good & Evil 2 is still in development, and we cannot wait for you to discover more about Jade’s past in the 20th Anniversary Edition!”\n\nThis echoes a similar sentiment from last year, where an Ubisoft representative told Eurogamer, “Beyond Good and Evil 2’s development is under way and the team is hard at work to deliver on its ambitious promise.”\n\nElsewhere in the thread, it’s also reiterated that the 20th Anniversary Edition of the original game will contain all-new content that ties into the second title, with players learning more about protagonist Jade’s past. It’s also restated that Limited Run Games will be producing a physical version of the Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition, including a Collector’s Edition, with pre-orders for both kicking off from July 12th.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition is out now digitally for $29.95 and you can find it on the below platforms/storefronts:"
