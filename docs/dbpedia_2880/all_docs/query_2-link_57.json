        "text": "If you are experiencing connectivity issues attempting to play a Call of Duty game on PlayStation Network, your first steps should be to check the PlayStation Network Status page and server status of the Call of Duty game you are playing.\n\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare\n\nCall of Duty: Ghosts\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops II\n\nIf the status for the Call of Duty game you’re playing is not at DEFCON 5 indicating that all online services are fully operational, you may encounter lag or connectivity issues until the status has returned to DEFCON 5.\n\nIf the status for the Call of Duty game you’re playing is at DEFCON 5, there are a number of steps that you can take to improve the quality of your connection.\n\nRun through the basics\n\nHere are a few things to note before delving any deeper:\n\nRestart your router – Often the easiest and quickest way to resolve connectivity issues.\n\nNetwork bandwidth – Avoid other bandwidth-heavy applications on your network while playing online, including but not limited to streaming music or video content, or downloading files.\n\nWired connections – You will achieve optimal performance when playing an online game over a wired Ethernet connection. Wi-Fi connections have a wide variance in reliability and bandwidth, and can dramatically affect the quality of online gameplay. Wired connections will maintain the minimum bandwidth connection that is required for online gaming.\n\nTest PlayStation Network Connection\n\nSign in to the PlayStation Network.\n\nSelect Settings and then select Network (PS4) or Network Settings (PS3).\n\nSelect Test Internet Connection (PS4) or Internet Connection Test (PS3) and let the test run.\n\nFind out more about connection tests on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.\n\nTest your home networking\n\nThe following tests require you to log in to the router on your home network to troubleshoot your network. You will need your router’s login credentials to proceed. If you do not have your router’s login credentials, you will need to contact your Internet Service Provider.\n\nThese tests refer to options that are typically found in a router’s menu. If you cannot find what you’re looking for, please refer to your router’s manual.\n\nYou may not need to perform all of these tests, so be sure to test the game after attempting each one.\n\nIf you are on an institutional (school), corporate, or other shared network, please refer to your network administrator for further assistance.\n\nTest 1: Universal Plug and Play\n\nTurn Port Forwarding off (if it is turned on) and enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP).\n\nCheck your new settings in game. If this doesn’t resolve your issue, proceed to the next step.\n\nTest 2: Port Forwarding\n\nTurn UPnP off.\n\nTurn Port Forwarding on. Learn more about Port Forwarding.\n\nAssign a Static IP address to your console.\n\nCheck your new settings in game. If this doesn’t resolve your issue, proceed to the next step.\n\nTest 3: DMZ"
