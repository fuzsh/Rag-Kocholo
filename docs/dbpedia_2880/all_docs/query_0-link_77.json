Plans for a sequel have been ongoing ever since.\n\nUPDATE 2.30pm UK: Ubisoft has now confirmed the Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition - though you'll need to wait a while to play it officially. The game will actually launch in 2024 - so 21 years after the original.\n\n\"Due to a technical error, an early development version of Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition was recently released to some Ubisoft+ subscribers,\" a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer.\n\n\"As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Beyond Good & Evil, we're excited to share that the official launch is set for early 2024, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the new year.\"\n\nBGE was a game from a Rayman developper released cheap (I remember buying it new at a budget price) at the same period of Sands of Time and Splinter Cell and became a \"hey that game is actually pretty good\" surprise that they had not communicated much on. It also had a cliffhanger ending which made everyone asks for a sequel, and for some reason, this managed to linger.\n\nIt's an actual good game, but not good enough to have achieved the legendary status it has now. It has achieved part of its legendary status through a failed and absent marketing campaign, imagine that though. Bring on LBA 3, bastards !"
