We’ve got a selection of just a few below.\n\nA Plague Tale: Requiem – Two hours\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 – Two hours\n\nCyberpunk 2077 – Five hours\n\nGod of War Ragnarok – Three hours\n\nThe Last of Us: Part I – Two hours\n\nHogwarts Legacy – 45 minutes\n\nSonic Frontiers – One hour\n\nSpider-Man 2 - Two hours\n\nAs you can see, longer RPGs and story titles get longer trials, so you can get a good sense of what you’re getting into before you fish out your wallet.
