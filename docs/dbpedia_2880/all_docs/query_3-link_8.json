        "text": "PlayStation Plus has undergone several iterations and changes since its introduction. Originally, the service wasn’t required for online play at all and rewarded subscribers with extra discounts and free monthly games. Once the PlayStation 4 generation began, it was required for online play, but still offered those same benefits.\n\nNow, PS Plus is divided into three different tiers of subscriptions. The basic tier, PS Plus Essential, still gets three games per month added, while the Extra and Premium tiers will have a varying number of games added to their catalogs monthly. With hundreds of games already and more coming and going all the time, even the most dedicated gamer won’t be able to play everything on offer. To help you get the most bang for your buck and so that no hidden gems fly under your radar, here are all the best games to play on PS Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium right now.\n\nBest PS Plus Essential games\n\nAs is usually the case, everyone with the lowest tier of PS Plus gets three games this month, two with PlayStation 5 versions and one with a PS4 version. Here’s what you can play this month:\n\nLego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga\n\n79%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nPuzzle, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nTraveller's Tales\n\nPublisher\n\nWB Games\n\nRelease\n\nApril 05, 2022\n\nWe can’t fully guarantee that you’ll have a good time watching all of the Star Wars films (unless you enjoy punishing yourself), but we can fully endorse going through the entire Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga game. This one package lets you play through all the mainline films in a more truncated and lighthearted way. You can take control of Lego versions of all the major, minor, and background characters from each film. If there’s a named character anywhere in the films, odds are you can play as them. The gameplay is simple, but addictive enough to carry you through the various worlds as toy collect millions of bolts.\n\nLego Star Wars - The Skywalker Saga Official Reveal Trailer - E3 2019\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach\n\n53%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Google Stadia\n\nGenre\n\nSimulator, Strategy, Adventure, Indie\n\nDeveloper\n\nSteel Wool Studios\n\nPublisher\n\nScottgames, Steel Wool Studios\n\nRelease\n\nDecember 16, 2021\n\nThe Five Knights at Freddy’s series is long and complicated, but more popular than ever. Security Breach is the latest game in the franchise, but you don’t need to have kept up with all the games for the scares to be any less effective. You play as Gregory, who finds himself trapped in the pizzaplex overnight. Can you survive all the menacing animatronics? There may be even greater monstrosities lying in wait as well.\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach Teaser - PS5 Footage\n\nEnder Lilies: Quietus of the Knights\n\n86%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nPlatform, Role-playing (RPG), Adventure, Indie\n\nDeveloper\n\nLive Wire, adglobe\n\nPublisher\n\nBinary Haze Interactive\n\nRelease\n\nJune 21, 2021\n\nOne of the most visually striking 2D action RPGs of the past few years has to be Ender Lilies. Much like a soulslike, you will explore a devastated kingdom as you try to uncover the history of what caused its downfall. You will adventure through forests, castles, caves, and more, besting challenging bosses and recruiting enemies to your side. Saying much more would only spoil the experience.\n\nENDER LILIES - Steam Early Access Announcement Gameplay Trailer\n\nBest PS Plus Extra games\n\nThe Extra tier is where you can download and play a massive library of both PS4 and PS5 titles. These games cycle in and out every month, though you never know how many will be added or removed at a given time. Here are some of the best ones available right now:\n\nDemon's Souls\n\n86%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nBluepoint Games\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nNovember 12, 2020\n\nSouls games have never been more popular, and this is a remake of the game that started it all. Not only is this remake just astoundingly beautiful to look at, but is as mechanically faithful to the original as possible. The only changes are to quality-of-life features, leaving the challenge of besting the levels, and bosses, all on your shoulders. It’s a little clunky in some ways but holds up remarkably well for a game over a decade old thanks to the new coat of paint.\n\nDemon's Souls - Announcement Trailer | PS5\n\nBloodborne\n\n92%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 4\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nFromSoftware\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nMarch 24, 2015\n\nSticking on the Souls train, we have the other PlayStation exclusive from developer FromSoftware, the fan favorite that they refuse to update in any way: Bloodborne. This title is much more focused on aggression than the others in the series, as well as boasting a unique and detailed world that just oozes with mysteries and intrigue. You usually can’t tell where a Souls game’s story is going anyway, but this game goes places you’d still never guess.\n\nBloodborne - Gamescom Trailer (Official)\n\nDeath Stranding: Director's Cut\n\n89%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nKojima Productions\n\nPublisher\n\n505 Games, Sony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nSeptember 24, 2021\n\nHideo Kojima’s first game after breaking up with Konami was about as off the wall as everyone expected it to be. While some dismiss it as a walking simulator, the act of walking, climbing, scrambling, and tumbling across treacherous but stunning landscapes is far more engaging than it may look. In many ways, it is quite a therapeutic experience, so don’t come expecting a high-action thriller (though there are moments of it here and there). The story is uneven, but the highs are very high, making it a journey worth taking.\n\nDeath Stranding Director's Cut - Teaser Trailer | PS5\n\nUncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection\n\n85%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nNaughty Dog\n\nPublisher\n\nNaughty Dog, Sony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nJanuary 28, 2022\n\nIf you somehow missed the latest Uncharted titles on PS4, you’re in luck because the two latest entries, Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy, have been bundled together and given a brand new coat of paint (plus some additional frames) for the PS5. Granted, this is the conclusion of the series, so it may not be the best place to start from a story perspective, but even with no prior knowledge, you can still enjoy the rollercoaster set pieces and swashbuckling adventure these titles provide.\n\nUncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection - PlayStation Showcase 2021 Trailer | PS5\n\nMonster Hunter Rise\n\n82%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nCapcom Development Division 2\n\nPublisher\n\nCapcom\n\nRelease\n\nMarch 26, 2021\n\nOriginally a Switch exclusive, now all us PlayStation fans who got a taste of the Monster Hunter games with World can jump into the latest entry before Wilds comes out next year. The formula isn’t changed much in Rise, but it’s as addicting as ever. You will be a new hunter tasked with taking down bigger and deadlier monsters as you collect materials and parts from them to upgrade your armor and gear. Aside from the return of the adorable Palico companions, Rise introduced a wolf mount named the Palamute to help you explore the new zones. As always, you can hunt alone or with friends in co-op.\n\nMonster Hunter Rise - Announcement Trailer\n\nHorizon Forbidden West\n\n87%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nGuerrilla Games\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nFebruary 18, 2022\n\nPerhaps the biggest new IP of the PS4 generation, this is the perfect way to get caught up on this robot-dinosaur-hunting adventure. Even though it’s from 2017, this game still looks amazing. You get a nice, big open world to explore, although there are some frustrating limitations on how far you’re allowed to carve your own path, along with hours of quests and tasks to complete. Once you’re done, the even more expansive and breathtaking 2022 sequel is right there waiting for you to download. Continue Aloy’s journey into a brand new environment, full of new threats to take down, and even more mysteries to solve. The story really ramps up here now that the world has been established, and you won’t believe the twists and turns it takes. With every game available, you’ll be ready for the VR spinoff.\n\nHorizon Forbidden West - Announcement Trailer | PS5\n\nKingdom Hearts III\n\n75%\n\n4.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nSquare Enix\n\nPublisher\n\nSquare Enix, Disney Interactive Studios\n\nRelease\n\nJanuary 25, 2019\n\nAs massive Kingdom Hearts fans, it was once very difficult to recommend the series when so many important entries were scattered across platforms. Now, not only are they all in convenient bundles, plus remastered and include each game’s Final Mix content, but all are included on PlayStation Plus Extra. That makes it the easiest it has ever been to go through this epic crossover series from start to finish (at least until Kingdom Hearts 4 comes out).\n\nKINGDOM HEARTS III – E3 2018 Frozen Trailer\n\nDoom Eternal\n\n85%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Google Stadia\n\nGenre\n\nShooter\n\nDeveloper\n\nid Software\n\nPublisher\n\nBethesda Softworks\n\nRelease\n\nMarch 19, 2020\n\nThe Doom franchise ripped and tore its way back into the limelight with its 2016 reboot, and the sequel, Doom Eternal turns the volume up to 11. The action is faster, the enemies deadlier, and your arsenal more varied. Doomguy has never felt so good to control, and the methods for you to dismantle the demonic enemies have never felt so disgustingly satisfying. If you’re an first-person shooter fan, there’s no excuse not to jump into this game and let off some steam.\n\nDoom: Eternal - E3 2018 Trailer\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\n93%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Google Stadia\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Role-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nRockstar Games\n\nPublisher\n\nTake-Two Interactive, Rockstar Games\n\nRelease\n\nOctober 26, 2018\n\nIf you ever wanted to know what it was like to live in the Old West, Red Dead Redemption 2 would probably be the closest you could get to that experience. Set before the events of the previous game, you play as Arthur Morgan, a member of Dutch’s old gang. Being a Rockstar title, you can expect a fantastic, albeit very guided, main story across dozens of hours, locations, and mission varieties. On the other hand, the entire open world is yours to explore on horseback, soaking in the beauty of an untamed West.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 Launch Trailer\n\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart\n\n90%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Platform, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nInsomniac Games\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nJune 11, 2021\n\nThe classic PS2 franchise made a huge first impression on the PS5 with Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart. This game really shows what the new hardware can do in all aspects. The graphics are on the level of an animated feature comet to life, the frame rate is rock solid, and the resolution is beautiful and even offers ray tracing, but the real showpieces are the rifts. The whole concept of this title is that the dimensions are falling apart, allowing Ratchet, and new protagonist Rivet, to seamlessly move from one dimension to the next. It is a trick so amazing that you may not believe it’s real. Oh, and it also helps that the game is a fantastically fun shooter with tons of personality and creative weapons and enemies.\n\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart - Reveal Trailer | PS5 Reveal Event\n\nThe Jackbox Party Pack 9\n\nPlatforms\n\nLinux, PC (Microsoft Windows), Mac, Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Amazon Fire TV, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nPuzzle, Strategy, Indie\n\nDeveloper\n\nJackbox Games\n\nPublisher\n\nJackbox Games\n\nRelease\n\nOctober 20, 2022\n\nWe all know the Jackbox games by now. These party games are perfect to bring out on a game night with friends or family, even when no one else is a traditional gamer. You don’t even need a ton of controllers, or to be in the same room. All everyone needs is a phone to connect and have fun. This pack includes Fibbage 4, Quixort, Junkopia, Nonsensory, and Roomerang. None of these games are hard to learn and they will have everyone laughing and having a blast in no time.\n\nFibbage 4 Is Available Now in The Jackbox Party Pack 9!\n\nSea of Stars\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Turn-based strategy (TBS), Adventure, Indie\n\nDeveloper\n\nSabotage\n\nPublisher\n\nSabotage\n\nRelease\n\nAugust 28, 2023\n\nA rare day-one release on the service, Sea of Stars is exactly what any fan of Chrono Trigger or the 16-bit JRPGs of the SNES has been dreaming of. This is a turn-based game, but it incorporates the time-based elements from something like Mario RPG and all the more modern quality-of-life features you expect. The story is gripping, the environments are beautiful and diverse, and it doesn’t overstay its welcome. If you’ve been a bit disappointed with modern JRPGs and want a taste of what made you fall in love with them in the first place, you can’t do better than this.\n\nSea of Stars - Reveal Trailer (Now on Kickstarter!)\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales\n\n81%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nHack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nInsomniac Games\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nNovember 12, 2020\n\nAs it turns out, this slightly smaller-scale Spider-Man tale is the perfect size for a game like this. Acting as an introduction to playing as Miles’ Spider-Man, this game redecorates the entire map from the base game in a winter setting, adds new side missions and events, plus a gripping and personal story that could only work for Miles’ character. Everything you loved about the first game is back, from the swinging, combat, and upgrades to collectibles and suits to unlock. This is a full-on Spider-Man experience in a tight package that doesn’t overstay its welcome.\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales - Gameplay Demo | PS5\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade\n\n88%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nSquare Enix\n\nPublisher\n\nSquare Enix\n\nRelease\n\nJune 10, 2021\n\nAside from being an absolute mouthful to say out loud, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is the best way to play one of 2020’s best games on your PS5. This already graphically impressive PS4 title has been upgraded to take advantage of your PS5 by doubling the frame rate to 60, improving lighting and textures, and cutting down load times. Plus, this version also comes with the Intermission DLC starring Yuffie which takes place during the events of the main game. With Rebirth looming on the horizon, this is the perfect way to catch up on how the story has changed.\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE – PS5 Announcement Trailer\n\nGhost of Tsushima: Director's Cut\n\n94%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nSucker Punch Productions\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nAugust 20, 2021\n\nIt’s reductive to say, but if you wanted an Assassin’s Creed-style game set in Japan, you need to check out Ghost of Tsushima. The game is so much more than that, however, thanks to a strong narrative with strong characters and an open world that doesn’t waste your time with hundreds of collectibles and repeated side content. The main point of discussion this game brought up was its use of a guiding wind to direct players rather than waypoints and mini-maps. By simply following the direction of the wind, you can fully focus on your samurai quest across the stunning island of Tsushima.\n\nGhost of Tsushima Director's Cut - Announcement Trailer | PS5, PS4\n\nRemnant II\n\n79%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Role-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nGunfire Games\n\nPublisher\n\nGearbox Publishing\n\nRelease\n\nJuly 25, 2023\n\nThe first Remnant had a couple of rough edges, but was a great new take on the souls genre that focused on guns rather than swords. Remnant 2 irons out just about everything and expands the world and mechanics. You now have a host of new classes to unlock and level up, tons of loot and gear to find and upgrade, plus a randomly generated progression system that keeps the grind from wearing you down. This game shines brightest in co-op, so having it as part of the service should make it an easy sell to get your friends on board to go shooting tons of monsters and see if you can overcome the toughest bosses.\n\nRemnant 2 - Gunslinger Archetype Reveal Trailer\n\nHollow Knight\n\n92%\n\nPlatforms\n\nLinux, PC (Microsoft Windows), Mac, Nintendo Switch\n\nGenre\n\nPlatform, Adventure, Indie\n\nDeveloper\n\nTeam Cherry\n\nPublisher\n\nTeam Cherry\n\nRelease\n\nFebruary 24, 2017\n\nThe competition for best indie game is essentially impossible to determine, but Hollow Knight would no doubt be on the shortlist for contenders. This game mixes a hand-drawn art style with buttery smooth movement, Souls-like combat, narrative, and boss fights, and a massive Metroidvania map. This is a game you can get to an ending in within 20 hours, or spend twice that exploring every inch and tackling every challenge it has to offer. While it is a world of insects, it plays and looks so good you won’t want to leave it.\n\nHollow Knight Trailer\n\nReturnal\n\n86%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nShooter\n\nDeveloper\n\nHousemarque\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nApril 30, 2021\n\nComing from developer Housemarque’s arcade shooter roots, Returnal transplants the gameplay of a bullet-hell game into a third-person shooter with rogue-lite elements. That may sound like a little bit of a mess, but it all comes together in a smooth, satisfying but testing game. Running through randomly generated rooms, you will blast some of the most bizarre creature designs ever animated in fluid 60 FPS action, picking up new tools, slowly completing each zone, and learning a bit more about the story. Runs are not as short as your traditional rogue-lite, and there isn’t a huge amount of synergies to discover, but the core movement and shooting are so good you’ll be pulled through to see Selene’s journey to the finish.\n\nReturnal - Announcement Trailer | PS5\n\nBest PS Plus Premium games\n\nThe Premium tier’s exclusive games are all the PS1, PS2, PSP, and PS3 games you can download and stream. The lineup of PS1, PS2, and PSP games was fairly limited at launch but will grow as new games are added monthly. For that retro hit, here are the best games from past generations to try out.\n\nSly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus\n\n79%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 2\n\nGenre\n\nPlatform, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nSucker Punch Productions\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nSeptember 23, 2002\n\nThe Sly trilogy on the PS2 was one of the most influential and unique games on the platform. Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus introduced us to Sly, Bently, and Murray as a gang of thieves portrayed with a striking cel-shaded art style and comic book-inspired cutscenes. The gameplay of sneaking through levels with tons of movement abilities made you really feel like a stealthy raccoon on the prowl. The later games built on and improved everything this first game started, but that doesn’t mean the original should be skipped.\n\nPS2 Sly Raccoon Demo Disc Trailer\n\nArc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits\n\n80%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 2, PlayStation 4\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Turn-based strategy (TBS), Tactical, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nCattle Call\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nMarch 20, 2003\n\nArc the Lad is a long-running, but criminally overlooked JRPG series. The PS2 entry, Twilight of the Spirits, is a great game with an amazing concept: You play as two brothers who are each human-deimos hybrids raised in different parts of the world. Deimos are the monster society of the world that uses magic, while humans use technology, but both racially judge the other. The journey swaps back and forth between these two perspectives, each overcoming their own plots until they finally intersect and have to put their biases aside to face a true evil. It’s great JRPG storytelling with a fantastic battle system.\n\nArc The Lad: Twilight of the Spirits - Gameplay Video 1 | PS2 to PS4\n\nTwisted Metal 2\n\n75%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation, PlayStation 3\n\nGenre\n\nFighting, Shooter, Racing\n\nDeveloper\n\nSingleTrac\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nOctober 31, 1996\n\nWhether you’re anticipating the TV adaptation or not, the original two Twisted Metal games are absolutely worth going back to. This is where car combat really started, and it’s arguably still the best. Each character you play as has a unique story as they attempt to win the titular tournament with the promise of any wish being granted upon victory. However, those wishes are never quite granted in the way the characters expect, making it a treat to play through the game to see how their words are twisted.\n\nJeanne d'Arc\n\n79%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Tactical\n\nDeveloper\n\nLEVEL-5\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nNovember 22, 2006\n\nThe PSP had so many hidden gems, but Jeanne d’Arc is a name you had to be in very specific circles to hear. That lack of popularity wasn’t because the game was bad since it is considered a classic by just about everyone who did get their hands on it. You will relive the Hundred Years’ War in the 15th century as Jeanne engages in tactics-style gameplay. The artwork and story are dark and gripping, but the gameplay is just as brutal as it is addictive. Even if you’re not traditionally a tactics fan, this one is worth a shot.\n\nJeanne dArc Sony PSP Trailer - Debut\n\nApe Escape\n\n78%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation, PlayStation Portable\n\nGenre\n\nPlatform\n\nDeveloper\n\nSCE Japan Studio\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nMay 31, 1999\n\nOne of the first games to require the dual analog controls of the original DualShock controller, Ape Escape is a charming action-puzzle game that helped put PlayStation on the map in its infancy. You run around trying to recapture escaped apes using various tools to snare them. Of course, this is still a PS1 game, so don’t expect the visuals to hold up, and the controls are slightly clunky but completely serviceable. You may not be so engrossed that you beat the whole thing, but it is certainly worth a download for nostalgia’s sake.\n\n(Ape Escape) Intro\n\nTekken 2\n\nPlatforms\n\nLegacy Cellphone, Zeebo\n\nGenre\n\nFighting\n\nDeveloper\n\nNamco Bandai Games\n\nPublisher\n\nNamco Bandai Games\n\nRelease\n\nNovember 02, 2006\n\nOK, it may not be Tekken 3, but it is the next best thing. When fighters started to go in the 3D direction, the Tekken games paved the way and showed the rest how it was done. The roster of characters remains not only iconic but wildly diverse and fun. This fighter is deep but also very approachable for those who aren’t veterans of fighting games since you don’t have to memorize tons of motions or commands to have a good time.\n\nTekken 2 - Zeebo\n\nWild Arms\n\n80%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG)\n\nDeveloper\n\nMedia.Vision\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nDecember 20, 1996\n\nJRPGs with an Old West setting are basically nonexistent, but Wild Arms paved the way for this odd mishmash of cultures in a fantastic JRPG that old-school fans will absolutely love. You play as a trio of characters, letting you get to know each of them intimately. Each one has its own ability to use outside of battle for traversal and puzzle-solving. It features a classic turn-based battle system, but with a dynamic camera thanks to being in 3D, and plenty of strategy and depth. It isn’t the longest game, either, making it an easy entry point to JRPGs as a whole. If that unique blend of West and East worked for you, then the only real way to scratch that itch is with the sequel. Wild Arms 2 features a brand new cast but is set in the same world. This time around, you control a larger party of six, but they’re all just as deep and important as the core three from the first game.\n\nWild Arms intro\n\nIco\n\n85%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 2\n\nGenre\n\nPlatform, Puzzle, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nTeam Ico\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Computer Entertainment, Inc. (SCEI)\n\nRelease\n\nSeptember 24, 2001\n\nThe first game by the developer of the same name, ICO is cited more than almost any other game as being a primary inspiration to some of the biggest games today. This game came before the same developer’s Shadow of the Colossus, and because of that is often overlooked But it’s just as emotionally resonant and will give you that same sense of loneliness, wonder, and curiosity. You play as a horned boy who is locked away in a castle as a kind of sacrifice, only to attempt to escape with a young girl you find there. Neither of you speaks the same language, so you travel around holding hands and fending off shadowy monsters with not much more than a stick trying to find a way to freedom.\n\nICO(PS2) trailer\n\nF.E.A.R.\n\n81%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows)\n\nGenre\n\nShooter\n\nDeveloper\n\nMonolith Productions\n\nPublisher\n\nSierra Entertainment, Vivendi Universal Games\n\nRelease\n\nOctober 17, 2005\n\nThis one is for all you FPS lovers out there. F.E.A.R. is a strange concept of a horror FPS where the shooting is some of the best still to this day. This is all thanks to the implementation of slo-mo, which is not as rare as it was when this game first came out, but even now some shooters still get the feel of it wrong. In F.E.A.R., every bullet, every impact, animation, dust particle, and crack of your gun just looks and feels amazing. The environments are a bit bland by today’s standards, but only because they’re so reactive to everything you do in them. If you want to shove a shotgun into an enemy soldier’s gut, flick on slow-mo, and watch them turn into a cloud of red mist, F.E.A.R. remains the best way to do it.\n\nF.E.A.R.
