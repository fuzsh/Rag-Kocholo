        "text": "The PlayStation Network is essentially unavoidable if you have a Sony console. At the least you need it to access the PlayStation Store, and it’s also the foundation for PlayStation Plus, which provides online multiplayer and curated games. Here’s how to sign in on a PS5 or PS4, and what you can do if login fails.\n\nQUICK ANSWER\n\nOn a PS5, you can sign in at any time by going to Settings > Users and Accounts > Account > Sign in. PS4 owners can do the same via Settings > Account Management > Sign in.\n\nJUMP TO KEY SECTIONS\n\nHow to sign in to PlayStation Network on a PS5\n\nHow to sign in to PlayStation Network on a PS4\n\nWhy is my PlayStation Network sign-in failing?\n\nHow to sign in to PlayStation Network on a PS5\n\nHadlee Simons / Android Authority\n\nThe sign-in screen should be triggered any time you try to access online features or services, such as the PlayStation Store. If you’ve set up 2-step verification (2SV), you’ll need not just your password but a code sent to your phone via SMS or an authenticator app.\n\nIf you want to sign in ahead of time, you can do that from the homescreen by going to Settings > Users and Accounts > Account > Sign in.\n\nRemember that by default, Console Sharing and Offline Play are enabled only on the first PS5 you use to sign into PSN. If you want to switch those features to a different PS5 in your household, you’ll have to use Settings > Users and Accounts > Other > Console Sharing and Offline Play. Only one of your PS5s can have the features on.\n\nHow to sign in to PlayStation Network on a PS4\n\nUnlike the PS5, you have to intentionally sign in on a PS4 by going to Settings > Account Management > Sign in. You’ll be asked for your email address and password.\n\nNote that if you haven’t activated the PS4 you’re on as your “primary,” you’ll be asked if you want to do that. Opt in if it’s your only PS4, but you should probably opt out if you already have another PS4 marked as a primary — only primary PS4s can share Store downloads and Plus benefits with anyone playing on them. They’re also what you connect to when using Remote Play.\n\nWhy is my PlayStation Network sign-in failing?\n\nAssuming your internet connection is working and that you’ve doublechecked your login info, there are a few reasons this can fail, the most obvious being that Sony is having trouble on its end. Check the company’s network service status page — if indicators are anything but green, you’ll have to wait for Sony’s techs to resolve the issue.\n\nHere are some other possible explanations:\n\nYou haven’t verified your email address. If you’re new to PSN, you may not have clicked the link in Sony’s verification email. Check your spam or trash folders if you didn’t see it.\n\nYour system software isn’t up-to-date. Typically this shouldn’t block you, but in some cases an update might help.\n\nYour account has been hijacked or suspended. If it’s suspended, you’ll see an error code during the sign-in process and have to wait out your punishment (if you abused terms of service, say through hate speech) or pay outstanding fees (if you have account debt). You should get an email explaining the situation. If your account is hijacked, you’ll have to contact PlayStation Support.\n\nYou’ve run into device activation limits. While there’s effectively no limit to how many PS5s you can have (Console Sharing and Offline Play support notwithstanding), you can only have 1 “primary” PS4, 2 PS3s, and 2 portable PlayStations on your account. You’ll have to deactivate a console if the limit is preventing sign-in. On a PS4, go to Settings > Account Management > Activate as Your Primary PS4 > Deactivate.\n\nYour console is having network trouble. Assuming the rest of your home is online, it could be that your PlayStation is having trouble connecting to Wi-Fi. Try rebooting your console, and making sure nothing is blocking signal to or from your router. If your PlayStation is still offline, you may need to switch from Wi-Fi to an Ethernet cable.\n\nYou might like"
