        "text": "âUpdate: You can now use Discord voice chat on your PS5Â® console!Â Learn how to connect and start using Discord on your console in this blog post.\n\n(This blog post is available in multiple languages. For non-English, head to our Help Center and select your preferred language at the top-right.)â\n\nBack in May of 2021, our friends at PlayStation announced a new Partnership with Discord, working together to deliver new ways to integrate your PlayStation experience with Discord for your friends and communities to see. Of course, everything needed to stay super-secret at the time, so we couldnât share anything quite yet.Â\n\nBut your daydreams of Squares, Triangles, and Circles swirling in the sky are over as the news drops now: Starting today, we're gradually rolling out the ability to link your PSN account from Discord and display your PlayStationÂ®4 or PlayStationÂ®5 game activity in your user profile!Â\n\nIf youâve ever connected your Discord account to another service that allows you to display your activity, it works similarly here: once your Discord account is linked, the game youâre currently playing on either PS4â¢ or PS5â¢ will be shown as your activity, just like that!Â\n\nYou can even opt to display your PlayStationâ¢Network online ID on your profile so your Discord friends can add you and tag along. Itâs especially great for knowing if your friend is currently playing a game that supports cross-play on another platform.Â\n\nHow to Connect your PlayStation Network Account to Discord\n\nHave you ever linked one of theâ¦ *shuffles through the integration list*â¦ eleven other services we now offer Discord integrations for? Itâs a very similar process, but if this is your first time ever connecting another account to Discord, letâs go through gettinâ it set up:\n\nTo connect your Discord account to your PlayStation Network account, open up Discord and head into User Settings > Connections on either desktop or web. On mobile, go to User Settings > Connections.\n\nOn this page, youâll see a newly-added PlayStation icon. Choose that, and youâre already on your way!Â\n\nFrom there, a browser window to authorize from your PlayStation account will pop up. Use it to sign in to your account on the login page and boom: your PlayStation Network account is all connected. Simple, right?\n\nOnce connected, two new options will appear for your PlayStation Network account: âDisplay on Profileâ and âDisplay PlayStation Network as your status.â While displaying your PlayStation online ID is all fine and dandy, showing your game activity is the real deal and will inspire your friends to join along for the ride.Â\n\nNow, the game youâre currently playing on your PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 console will be happily displayed in your user profile for all your friends and community members to see!Â\n\nDo note that on your PSN Privacy Settings, your âPSN Online Statusâ and âNow Playingâ visibility must be set to âAnyoneâ in order for your status to be visible on Discord. Take a peek at PlayStationâs article on âHow to change privacy settings on PlayStation Networkâ in case you may have adjusted them before.Â\n\nFor more details on the account connection process, be sure to check out our Help Center article.\n\nWhether you stick to single-player games or enjoy having your friends join in on multiplayer endeavors, your friends from all over the world will be able to see all sorts of PlayStation games youâre playing and start a conversation about wanting to jump in and play with you.Â\n\nThe ability to connect your Discord account with your PlayStation Network account is rolling out starting today and will be available on every platform Discord is on: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and the web app.Â\n\nWeâre excited to continue our partnership with PlayStation and explore how we can collectively create great shared experiences for your friends and communities. Show us which PlayStation games youâre excited to share your activity status for, and tell us how youâre using this integration on Twitter or TikTok!Â\n\nAnd if youâve never used Discord and somehow made it to the end of this blogâ¦ whatâre you doinâ?! You can download Discord on your device of choice here."
