        "text": "Why would I buy games from another region of the PlayStation Store?\n\nThere are a few reasons that you might want to buy games from other regions of the PlayStation Store, with the most common being:\n\nThe game is not available in your region.\n\nThe game is cheaper in another region. For example, the Turkey and Hong Kong PlayStation Stores often sell games a bit cheaper than the stores associated with other regions.\n\nYou can earn trophies in the game multiple times by playing versions of it from multiple regions. For example, some games have a different trophy set for the North American version of the game and the European version of the game, so you can platinum it twice (as long as you buy it twice). Note that this does not work for every game – if you are unsure, ask on the forums or check a trophy tracking site like PSNProfiles.\n\nHow do I buy games from another region?\n\nIn order to buy games from another region, you need to do two things: create an account associated with that region, and buy a PSN card for that region.\n\nStep 1: Create an account on the other-region store\n\nSimply create an account on the PlayStation Store that is associated with the country that you want to buy games from. Make sure that you select the correct country (the country you want to buy games from, not the country that you actually live in) when you sign up. You will have to enter a physical address when you sign up – this can be anything (just search Google for valid addresses in that country, if you like).\n\nThe one exception here is Korea – it is essentially impossible to create a Korean PlayStation account unless you actually live there, since you need a Korean i-PIN to register.\n\nStep 2: Buy a PSN card for the other-region store\n\nYou will not be able to use your own credit card on your international PlayStation account directly, since Sony checks to make sure that the country your credit card was issued in matches the country of your PlayStation Store account (so you can only use a Canadian credit card to buy games in the Canadian PlayStation Store, for example). The simplest way around this is to buy an international pre-paid PSN card from an external website. There are a few different options for this, depending on the region for which you want to buy a card:\n\nGermany: Amazon.de (make sure you buy a digital card, not a physical one)\n\nJapan: Amazon.co.jp (make sure you buy a digital card, not a physical one)\n\nUnited Kingdom: Amazon.co.uk (make sure you buy a digital card, not a physical one)\n\nUnited States: Amazon.com (make sure you buy a digital card, not a physical one)\n\nMultiple regions: Playasia (Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States)\n\nOther regions are a bit more difficult to get PSN cards for due to international region restrictions, but methods can often be found online. See this thread for a method of adding money to a Turkish PlayStation account, for example.\n\nStep 3: Buy and play games"
