You should ask your Responsible Adult to read them to you when you join and explain anything you don’t understand.\n\nPlayStation Store is our shop for games, movies and many other things that you can buy and download. Just like with other things you do on PSN, there are some rules for using your PSN Account to buy things from us:\n\nThere are a lot more rules for using PSN but if you follow these 3 rules and never try to cheat, you will be OK. Ask your Responsible Adult to read the full PSN Terms with you when you join and explain anything you don’t understand.\n\nThe best way to contact us is via our website at: www.playstation.com/support. You may also reach us by phone at 800-345-7669.\n\nYou can also write to us at:\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment LLC\n\n2207 Bridgepointe Parkway\n\nSan Mateo, CA 94404.\n\nIf you have a problem with your console or game, visit our Support site for helpful information or to learn how to contact a Support representative.\n\nAsk your Responsible Adult for help if you need it."
