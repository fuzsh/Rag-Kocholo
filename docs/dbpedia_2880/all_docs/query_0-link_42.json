I look forward to seeing more about what it changes and how much it will cost (which all has probably leaked somewhere, based on that broken Xbox link in the OP).\n\nMeatheadSamus\n\nMoblin\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nNov 28, 2023\n\n#13\n\n....so no Switch currently?

Updated HD textures and models and better lightning. 60 fps here on Xbox but I think it'll be same on Switch.\n\nI wonder what other PS2 games Ubi is considering doing the same, there are lots of gems out there: Rayman 3, Driver 3-PL, Splinter Cell trilogy... SC trilogy could be a cool counter for Konami's MGS collections.\n\nYamanoi\n\nI paid $70 for this tag\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nNov 29, 2023\n\n#19\n\nKind of disrespectful to release this on Xbox before Switch IMHO\n\n9-Volt\n\nYoshi\n\nPronouns\n\nhe/him\n\nNov 29, 2023\n\n#21\n\nKind of disrespectful to release this on Xbox before Switch IMHO\n\nIt's not released on Xbox lol.

I dig this poster.\n\nBGE was one of my favorite game of the GC/PS2/XB era. The music was so good (Christophe Heral, who also did Rayman's OSTs), the world intriguing (and full of furries), the french voice acting was perfect (it better be for a french game, mind you).\n\nI hope this can shed a little light for BGE 2. Restart the whole thing at this point, let it be what is was supposed to be : a sequel, not a weird prequel that retcon the original.\n\nLast edited: Nov 29, 2023\n\nAostia82\n\nTingle\n\nPronouns\n\nHe\n\nNov 29, 2023\n\n#32\n\nthey could have at least confirmed the consoles :|\n\nNov 29, 2023\n\n#33\n\nWell that's a hell of a cock-up\n\nWell this certainly wasn't 'alright on the night' was it.\n\nNov 29, 2023\n\n#35\n\nThey're taking the Disney approach and celebrating an anniversary of a thing until they get bored celebrating it.\n\nHockeyBird\n\nPokémon Trainer\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nNov 29, 2023\n\n#36\n\nIt probably was scheduled for this year for the anniversary but it needed more time.

Like Gold Edition or something.\n\nThis is definitely delayed internally as the team couldn't make it on time. The leaked game doesn't match with the screenshots on the game page.\n\nJun 13, 2024\n\n#40\n\na trophy list and a Patch PKG are now up for the PS5 version, suggesting it’s releasing very soon.\n\nthough for the record, a trophy list for the Sands of Time remake has also been on the PSN backend for a while despite getting delayed to 2026.\n\nI believe the situation with that was the original version (with the heavily criticized graphical upgrade) was nearly finished before Ubisoft decided to completely redo it from scratch."
