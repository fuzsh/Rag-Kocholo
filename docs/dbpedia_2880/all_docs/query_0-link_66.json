        "text": "Ubisoft has insisted it's committed to the Beyond Good & Evil franchise and even mentioned its long in-development sequel as part of the reveal of Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil 2 is considered vaporware by many fans after an incredible 16 years since it was announced back in 2008. Despite Ubisoft’s many vague references to it being still alive, no video game has materialized thus far.\n\nBut this week's announcement of Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition has sparked renewed hope that Beyond Good & Evil 2 is real and may even be re-revealed sooner rather than later.\n\nThis remaster includes a brand new mission in which players can discover more about protagonist Jade’s past and collect exclusive cosmetic rewards. Crucially, Ubisoft included a note to press that this new mission “also reveals more about the narrative link to Beyond Good & Evil 2, showing Ubisoft’s enduring commitment to the franchise.”\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThat line strongly suggests Beyond Good & Evil 2 is not just still alive but closer than ever to launch. The question of course will be what form the game takes, given how many times development has stopped and started over the years. At E3 2017, Ubisoft revealed what looked like an incredibly ambitious project, promising a multi-planet world populated by dynamically-generated characters.\n\nIn the meantime, Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition launches June 25 on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Amazon Luna, and PC through the Ubisoft Store, Epic Games Store and Steam, with a physical version from Limited Run Games out July 12. It features the aforementioned new mission, an anniversary gallery, a re-orchestrated soundtrack, support of up to 60FPS, and other \"exclusive new content.\"\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
