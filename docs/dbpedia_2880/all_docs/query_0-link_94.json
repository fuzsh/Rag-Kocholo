        "text": "Updated: After Ubisoft leaked its own announcement earlier today, Limited Run Games officially announced the long-expected Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition.\n\nAlongside a trailer premiering first on Ubisoft's since-deleted post on X/Twitter (which has since been re-posted and is below), Limited Run Games also provided an announcement trailer, along with a June 25th release date. However, those seeking a physical copy must wait until July 12.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nIn addition to a re-release, the 20th Anniversary Edition of Beyond Good & Evil features a new treasure hunt, an anniversary gallery, a re-orchestrated soundtrack, support of up to 60FPS, and other \"exclusive new content.\"\n\nThere had been mentions before of Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary, first surfacing in November 2023, when Microsoft accidentally published (and later pulled) a store listing for the unannounced project. Last week, achievement and trophy database website Exophase spotted a list of trophies for Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary.\n\nMost recently, Beyond Good & Evil was pulled from Steam ahead of the expected remaster announcement.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil was originally released in 2003 for the PS2, PC, Xbox, and Gamecube, created by Michel Ancel, the creator of the Rayman series. The original Beyond Good & Evil is set in a third-person perspective where players control Jade, who is uncovering the dark secrets of her government. Beyond Good & Evil would see an HD re-release in 2011 for Xbox 360 and PS3.\n\nIn our review of the original Beyond Good & Evil, IGN wrote: \"Ultimately, for all its similarities to Zelda, this is where Beyond Good & Evil finds its own ground. Not only does it avoid many of the frustrations of the games it draws from (and yes, that includes Zelda's flat story and tedious item-chasing), but it is pierced throughout with humor, intelligence, and humanity.\"\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2, which will serve as a prequel to the original game, was initially revealed in 2017 at E3, but Ubisoft has kept a tight lip in the years since. In February 2022, we learned that the game was still in pre-production. In August that same year, we learned that Ubisoft hired Sarah Arellano as the game's lead writer."
