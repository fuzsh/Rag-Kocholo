        "text": "Have now tried literally everything, port forwarding, putting the PS5 in a DMZ. Wireless and wired, changing DNS settings, I can even watch streaming apps on the console whilst not signed into PlayStation network, sky go app, YouTube etc….\n\nthe only thing I can’t do is sign in online and play any online games, but tethered to the phone works perfectly. Honestly what has happened here? There has to be a reason\n\nOh really, since when? Today is when it happened to me? Just tried some more troubleshooting and my speed test is 54mb down and 8.8kbps upload!!! Yes you read it right, 8.8kbps and it’s always been exactly that today, must be a bug somewhere in the router? Please someone at three acknowledge this tomorrow, glad it’s not just me at least but we need to figure out a way to fix it. Let me know if you figure anything out please\n\nIf anyone cares, I figured it out finally by googling 8.8kbps as I knew this was the problem.\n\nso using these search results from Google:\n\nhttps://www.ispreview.co.uk/talk/threads/crazy-low-three-5g-hub-upload-8-8kbps-but-only-on-some-devi...\n\nhttps://community.three.co.uk/t5/Network/Three-APN-Settings/m-p/5373\n\ni changed the APN settings in the hub admin page from the address 192.168.0.1\n\nIf you’re on a mobile device you need to change the webpage from mobile to PC view then in the centre of your page you will have a title of “my router”, 4g+ should be toggled on then choose settings, then the bottom option APN. Then from mode auto to manual, and basically I added a new profile, named it 3 (though it’s just a name so doesn’t matter), PDP type is defaultly selected at IPv4 then in the APN field I just typed three.co.uk, authentication is none and username and password is none.\n\nHope this helps someone, my question is now why did this just suddenly happen today? Will this change again in future? And why don’t support have a clue about it at all, and try to blame me or Sony when it’s obvious it’s not the problem, since I told them repeatedly I can use the PlayStation with other internet sources. Goodnight!\n\nI had the issue occur Tuesday February 28th. I woke up and my Echo Dots/Alexa wouldn't work. When I got home in the evening I discovered I couldn't connect to PSN. These APN changes have got me back online, thank you!\n\nAlso, I contacted customer services via phone and chat and they just were a cycle of nobody actually being helpful and similarly to the experience seemingly of most - it was my Echo and PS5 at fault. Ridiculous."
