On Xbox & PS they have a dedicated niche that pick them up for the easy Trophy & Achievements.\n\nOn switch, I'm not really sure what the aim is as their biggest selling point is gone on that platform and you can't do stuff like 10 cent games anymore.\n\n————\n\nRegardless, at this point it's just one of those things and typically you aren't running into them as much on PS & Xbox unless you dig for them.\n\nStuff like this was a big reason as to why I didn't understand Sony's original idea of not allowing all games to have platinums since so much was falling through the cracks anyway. Thankfully they fixed that and the lack of platinums now is typically just an oversight based on how the developers scored their trophies.\n\n_zoipi\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nNov 23, 2017\n\n2,377\n\nMadrid\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#10\n\nDigital stores really want the number of games vailable, and as long they don't have certain 18+ assets, they're fine.\n\njph139\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n14,833\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#11\n\nEvery store has cheap-o garbage shovelware, but honestly, the idea of spending real money to play a garbage game to get a trophy/achievement on your account is very funny to me.\n\ngreenbird\n\n\"This guy are sick\"\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n3,113\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#12\n\nGarbage-ass non-games that literally last a couple of minutes, sole purpose seems to be to reward people with platinum trophies.\n\nYeah, that's the entire reason they exist.

Those games are straight garbage, but if someone wants to spend money on it, that's up to them.\n\nMatrixMan.exe\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n9,535\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#35\n\nIf people want to spend money on platinum trophies more power to them\n\nThis. I do find it weird how there are people here who look down on others who like to achievement/trophy hunt.\n\nStarlatine\n\n533.489 paid youtubers cant be wrong\n\nOct 28, 2017\n\n31,107\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#36\n\nI can sort of understand it on xbox since you need achievements to gain ms bucks but sony doesnt have anything similar in place right? is it just to say you got a platinum? but is it really impressive to show a platinum for jumping nuggets? anyone who knows the game will know what it is, i dont think youre going to wow many people with that\n\nWhy shouldn't they exist ? If it were up to some people here everything that isn't a 90 metacritic AAA release shouldn't be released.\n\nThere will always be a lot of trash in every form of media, gotta take the good with the bad.\n\nEven these trash games probably have their small audiences.\n\nThey're not games, they're \"hold a button for 5 minutes to get a platinum\" apps.

Very common.\n\nNothing throws away more money than making a niche game with hard trophies. Since hell, the easy trophies might attract and bring some word of mouth to the game.\n\noni-link\n\ntag reference no one gets\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n16,329\n\nUK\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#39\n\nIt's the most annoying when there are sales on and you see like 1000+ items reduced, and the list is like 90% garbage games\n\nNecron\n\n▲ Legend ▲\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n8,591\n\nSwitzerland\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#40\n\nThe bigger issue is not the existence of these titles but how they completely take over the 'New Games' section of PSN.\n\nMoreover, it does further devalue the Trophies system which is surprising considering Sony's stance on them regarding BC; it's all without policy/guidelines and oversight. I think that system needs another overhaul if one is to compare say a Plat from Wipeout vs The Giraffe G...\n\nLast edited: Aug 12, 2022\n\nBrando\n\n\"This guy are sick\"\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n1,349\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#41\n\nBetter curating is needed on all store fronts so you can actually browse them without seeing these shit games with easy achievements.\n\nala1995ginobiko\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n1,537\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#42\n\nAnything wrong with that ?\n\nPeople play games for all kind of\n\nI don't have any problems with that\n\nBengraven\n\nPowered by Friendship™\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n29,438\n\nFlorida\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#43\n\nWhat?!?

That way if there's a sale you only check your wishlist and not browse the entire store.

Theyre not games. The xump bump jump ones are, as bad as they might seem. But snow trip and the sort, theres no gameplay at all. you hold a button, a number goes up and it ends in two minutes. If thats a game, a calculator is a console\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#47\n\nIt's the most annoying when there are sales on and you see like 1000+ items reduced, and the list is like 90% garbage games\n\naka every single Switch sale.\n\nLulu\n\nSaw the truth behind the copied door\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n28,140\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#48\n\ndamn the steam greenlight achievement meta is finally on console!\n\nJawmuncher\n\nCrisis Dino\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n40,004\n\nIbis Island\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#49\n\nAnd some don't consider Visual Novels, Kojima Games, Ring Fit, portable/mobile stuff or whatever as games.

On Xbox there's more than a few western ones there that sell because of trophies.\n\nReading the reviews are so funny because apparently a lot of achievement Hunter types don't know what \"VNs\" are. So the reviews are like \"This game is like a book, just keep mashing A and you'll get the achievements\" lol"
