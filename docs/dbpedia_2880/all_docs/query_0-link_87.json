        "text": "The Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition trophies for the PlayStation 5 have appeared online, sparking discussion that the game could be released soon.\n\nThe trophies appeared on Exophase, which uses PlayStation’s backend to update its readers on future title releases and trophies. According to the new article, the game will have 35 different trophies.\n\nLast week, I heard rumblings that the Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition would be gearing up for an announcement. Due to the timing of the rumors with Ubisoft Forward on the horizon, I believed that it would be likely to make an appearance there. A few days on, and we now know that was not the case, but an update to include the game’s trophies suggests that an announcement (and release) is not too far away.\n\nIt’s unclear why the game wasn’t announced at Ubisoft Forward, but I did hear whispers that it failed to meet certain criteria to be shadowdropped during the event. Now, at least, that criteria is likely to have been met, and Ubisoft is likely gearing up to release the game soon.\n\nInterestingly, the update comes as rumors begin to swirl that a Nintendo Direct is just a couple of weeks away, which makes you wonder if the plan is to shadow-drop the game at the rumored event.\n\nWill you be playing Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition when it releases? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nAre you going to check out the Everywhere closed beta?
