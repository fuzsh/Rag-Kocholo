Finally, we can begin the process of forgiving Sony for that PlayStation Network outage. Beyond Good & Evil HD was supposed to be available on the PlayStation Network in May, but the store downtime caused Ubisoft's HD remix to get pushed into release date purgatory.

Today, Ubisoft has announced that the PS3 version of Beyond Good & Evil HD will be available to download next week, June 28th, for $9.99. And once again, everyone that buys the game within the first two weeks of release will get bonus Jade and Pey'j avatars.

But is the game any good? Well, it's certainly good enough to convince me to put my credit card information back on Sony's servers.
