        "text": "By 22 November 1963, the date of his assassination, President Kennedy had made many enemies. He had declared war on the Mafia, racial prejudice and the industrial/military interest in Vietnam. He had humiliated Khrushchev and Castro, who both wanted revenge over the Cuban Missile Crisis. To this day, conjecture surrounds the ballistics evidence and whether multiple assassins were involved. New film material from Washington has just been released."
