Kennedy and His Presidency\n\nEssential Question\n\nHow do we remember leaders?\n\nObjective\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to answer the following questions:\n\nIn your opinion, would President John Fitzgerald Kennedy (JFK) agree or approve of the way he has been remembered, memorialized, or commemorated?\n\nWhat do you think is the best way to remember, memorialize, or commemorate him? Why?\n\nBackground\n\nWhile John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site was created by an act of Congress, the design, furnishing, and early interpretation of the site was done largely by President Kennedy’s mother, Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald Kennedy. This lesson will allow students to explore the theme of commemoration, memorialization, and legacy through reading of primary and secondary sources. They will engage in a consideration of how historical memory is shaped and how we commemorate people and places. The lesson will also allow students to make connections about their own thoughts and feelings regarding history and how it is commemorated.\n\nProcedure\n\nAfter completing the opener and discussing it, students will be divided into groups. Each group will be assigned a different reading/primary source to examine and answer questions. They will then present their findings to the class. Each student will record their findings during the presentations. They will discuss the ways that John F. Kennedy has been memorialized or commemorated. As a class, they will watch the site film \"The Shaping of a President, The First Home of John F. Kennedy\". They should record what they think is most significant about JFK and why. The class will then hold a general discussion about the legacy of John F. Kennedy. Lastly, they will use the new information they have learned to connect back to the first quote they analyzed.\n\nThe following question can be used as an exit ticket or closer: In your opinion, would JFK agree or approve of the way he has been remembered, memorialized, or commemorated? What do you think is the best way to remember, memorialize, or commemorate him? Why?\n\nGrade Level\n\nHigh School: Ninth Grade through Twelfth Grade\n\nStandards\n\nCommon Core English Language Arts Standards/ History/ Social Studies Grades 9-10\n\nKey Ideas and Details:\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.9-10.1 Cite specific textual evidence to support analysis of primary and secondary sources, attending to such features as the date and origin of the information.\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.9-10.2 Determine the central ideas or information of a primary or secondary source; provide an accurate summary of how key events or ideas develop over the course of the text.\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.9-10.3 Analyze in detail a series of events described in a text; determine whether earlier events caused later ones or simply preceded them.\n\nCraft and Structure:\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.9-10.4 Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including vocabulary describing political, social, or economic aspects of history/social science.\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.9-10.5 Analyze how a text uses structure to emphasize key points or advance an explanation or analysis.\n\nIntegration of Knowledge and Ideas:\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.9-10.7 Integrate quantitative or technical analysis (e.g., charts, research data) with qualitative analysis in print or digital text.\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.9-10.8 Assess the extent to which the reasoning and evidence in a text support the author's claims.\n\nMassachusetts Social Studies Curriculum Frameworks\n\nUSI.T6 Rebuilding the US: Industry and Immigration\n\nUSHII.T2 Modernity in the US: Ideologies and Economics\n\nUSHII.T4 Defending Democracy: The Cold War and Civil Rights at Home\n\nNational Council for Social Studies\n\nNational Curriculum Standards for Social Studies\n\nCulture\n\nTime, Continuity, and Change\n\nPeople, Places, and Environments\n\nIndividual Development and Identity\n\nIndividuals, Groups, and Institutions\n\nPower, Authority, and Governance\n\nProduction, Distribution, and Consumption\n\nScience, Technology, and Society\n\nOpener\n\n“As every past generation has had to disenthrall itself from an inheritance of truisms and stereotypes, so in our own time we must move on from the reassuring repetition of stale phrases to a new, difficult, but essential confrontation with reality.\n\nFor the great enemy of truth is very often not the lie—deliberate, contrived and dishonest—but the myth—persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the clichés of our forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.”\n\n- John F. Kennedy, Commencement Address, Yale University, June 11, 1962\n\nAccording to President Kennedy what are lies? What are myths? Why do we “hold fast” to myths? Why might myths be problematic? How do ideas in the second paragraph connect with the first? Why does each generation have to question the “truisms and stereotypes” of the past and have an “essential confrontation with reality?” How does all of this connect with learning and understanding of history?\n\nThe entire text of the speech and an audio recording can be found here.\n\nSource 1 - President Lyndon B. Johnson\n\nStatement by the President Upon Signing Bill Establishing the John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site. Lyndon B. Johnson. May 27, 1967\n\nSome buildings become landmarks because their architecture is imposing; others, because they are meant by a nation or a people to be monuments and symbols.\n\nStill others are set apart through no quality of their own. They become famous because they evoke the name and the memory of great men—or one great man.\n\nSo it is with the two-story frame house at 83 Beals Street, Brookline, Massachusetts.\n\nOn May 29, 1917, John F. Kennedy was born in that house.\n\nToday we establish it as a national historic site.\n\nPresident Kennedy's family bought that house not long ago and presented it to the people of the United States. Through the generosity of his family, it will be restored in a style reflecting his boyhood years there, 1917-1920.\n\nI am happy to sign this bill today. For years to come, for great numbers of visitors it will make more rich, more vivid, and more meaningful the memory of a great American.\n\nAdditional Resources: That same day, President Johnson gave a speech at the dedication of the Aircraft Carrier U.S.S. John F. Kennedy. Watch a short clip of his speech (video begins at 23:29). The full text of his speech can be found here.\n\nAccording to President Johnson, why do buildings become “landmarks?”\n\nWhat is important about the “two-story frame house at 83 Beals Street?”\n\nAccording to this document, how did the house mentioned above become a National Historic Site? Why is that important?\n\nSource 2 – First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy\n\nRead \"A Wife's Experiences\" from the \"Commemorating Camelot: Three Women Who Shaped JFK’s Legacy\" Site Bulletin.\n\nAn excerpt from For President Kennedy: An Epilogue, Theodore White's December 1963 interview with Jackie Kennedy\n\n“When Jack quoted something, it was usually classical,” she said, “but I’m so ashamed of myself—all I keep thinking of is this line from a musical comedy.\n\n“At night, before we’d go to sleep, Jack liked to play some records; and the song he loved most came at the very end of this record. The lines he loved to hear were: Don’t let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.”\n\nShe wanted to make sure that the point came clear and went on: “There’ll be great Presidents again—and the Johnsons are wonderful, they’ve been wonderful to me—but there’ll never be another Camelot again.\n\n“Once, the more I read of history the more bitter I got. For a while I thought history was something that bitter old men wrote. But then I realized history made Jack what he was. You must think of him as this little boy, sick so much of the time, reading in bed, reading history, reading the Knights of the Round Table, reading Marlborough. For Jack history was full of heroes. And if it made him this way—if it made him see the heroes—maybe other little boys will see. Men are such a combination of good and bad. Jack had this hero idea of history, the idealistic view.\n\n”But she came back to the idea that transfixed her: “Don’t Let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot—and it will never be that way again.”\n\nThe full article, as well as Theodore White’s notes about the interview, can be found at the John F. Kennedy Library.\n\nAdditional reading if time allows: Jackie Kennedy’s Post-Assassination Interview With LIFE\n\nWhat was “Camelot” and how did it become associated with John F. Kennedy’s presidential administration?\n\nThe interview was conducted less than a month after the President’s assassination. What impact do you think this timing had on Jackie Kennedy’s responses?\n\nMrs. Kennedy Audio Tour: Living Room\n\nMrs. Kennedy's audio created for the living room at John Fitzgerald Kennedy NHS.\n\nDate created:\n\n10/14/2020\n\nWelcome to our home. Mr. Kennedy and I bought and moved into this house when we were married in 1914. Our eldest son was born at Hull, Massachusetts, a summer resort, but our next three children, including the president, were born here, and this house holds many happy memories. Life was so much simpler then. Here we had space and air, for there were no houses across the street or to the right of this one. At first there were few automobiles and the trolley lines were a fifteen minute walk away. I shall try to point out to you some of the things as we go through the house that were important in our lives. Since the living room in the days before radio and television was the place for the family to be together, we shall start here. We spent a lot of time in this room in the evening. Mr. Kennedy was president of a bank and this was his one opportunity to read the newspaper or his favorite detective stories. He would sit in that red chair by the gate-leg table. We all read The Boston Transcript in the evenings in those days. Papers only cost a penny. Usually I would sit in the wing chair there by the table opposite him. I cant see that chair without remembering the holes in the childrens stockings. They wore knickers then and the boys knee stockings always had holes in them. They had to be darned once or twice a week When the children were ready for bed and had said their prayers they would come to the living room and play for a little while before we put them to bed. Usually after the children were tucked in, Mr. Kennedy and I would take a long walk. It was an hour we both enjoyed. I spent a good deal of the time reading to the children from books carefully selected from a list submitted by the school twice a year or from the Womens Industrial Union. I remember that I would make no engagements outside in the evening so that I could be with the children to help them with their school work, to doctor their colds, or to find out what activities they had been interested in during the day. The piano was a wedding gift and at Christmas, with the tree over there by the south window, I would play and we would all sing Christmas carols. The children did not do too well with their piano lessons. Radio was a new thing then and they said that people wouldnt want to listen to them play when they could hear the same songs on the radio. The pictures are copies of famous paintings I had studied in the European galleries. It gave me great pleasure to have these copies in my home and I thought it an inspiration for the children to grow up with them. Now shall we go upstairs to the master bedroom? On the way you may want to take notice of the old-fashioned telephone in the hall.\n\nAdditional Resources: Mrs. Kennedy's Full Audio Tour\n\n.\n\nHow did Rose Kennedy’s memories shape the re-creation of President Kennedy’s birthplace?\n\nWhat items were in the Kennedy household that Rose Kennedy hoped would influence her children?
