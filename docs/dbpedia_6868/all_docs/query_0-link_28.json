        "text": "Here’s some background information about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963.\n\nTimeline\n\nNovember 22, 1963\n\n- 11:37 a.m. - Air Force One arrives at Dallas’ Love Field with the President and his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, Texas Governor John B. Connally Jr. and his wife, Idanell Connally. Vice President Lyndon Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird Johnson, arrive in a separate plane. It is a campaign trip for the coming 1964 election, although not officially designated as such.\n\nDuring a 10-mile tour of Dallas, the President and Mrs. Kennedy and the governor and Mrs. Connally ride in an open convertible limousine. The motorcade is on the way to the Trade Mart where the President is to speak at a sold-out luncheon.\n\n- 12:30 p.m. - As the President’s limousine passes the Texas School Book Depository, shots are fired from a sixth-floor window.\n\nPresident Kennedy and Governor Connally are both wounded and are rushed to Parkland Hospital.\n\nWire services report three shots were fired as the motorcade passed under Stemmons Freeway. Two bullets hit the President and one hit the Governor.\n\nEmergency efforts by Drs. Malcolm Perry, Kemp Clark and others are unsuccessful at reviving the president. Governor Connally’s injuries are critical but not fatal. From one bullet, he sustains three broken ribs, a punctured lung and a broken wrist. The bullet finally lodged in his left thigh.\n\n- 12:36 p.m. - The ABC radio network broadcasts the first nationwide news bulletin reporting that shots have been fired at the Kennedy motorcade.\n\n- 12:40 p.m. - The CBS television network broadcasts the first nationwide TV news bulletin also reporting on the shooting.\n\n- 1:00 p.m. - Kennedy is pronounced dead by Parkland Hospital doctors, becoming the fourth US president killed in office.\n\n- 1:07 p.m. - News of the shooting causes the New York Stock Exchange to halt trading after an $11 million flood of sell orders.\n\n- 1:15 p.m. - Lee Harvey Oswald kills Dallas Police Patrolman J.D. Tippit approximately 45 minutes after the assassination.\n\n- 2:00 p.m. - A bronze casket carrying the President’s body, accompanied by Mrs. Kennedy and the Johnsons, leaves Parkland Hospital for Air Force One.\n\n- 2:15 p.m. - Oswald, a 24-year-old ex-Marine, is arrested in the back of a movie theater where he fled after shooting Tippit.\n\n- 2:39 p.m. - Johnson is sworn in on the runway of Love Field aboard Air Force One. Federal Judge Sarah T. Hughes, of the Northern District of Texas, administers the oath of office. Witnesses include Jacqueline Kennedy and Johnson’s wife.\n\n- 5:00 p.m. (6:00 p.m. ET) - Air Force One arrives at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. The coffin bearing the President’s body is taken by ambulance to Bethesda Naval Hospital for an autopsy. The flag-draped coffin is taken to the East Room of the White House early the next morning following the autopsy.\n\n- 7:15 p.m. - Oswald is arraigned for the murder of Tippit.\n\nNovember 22-25, 1963 - Major television and radio networks devote continuous news coverage to ongoing events associated with the President’s assassination, canceling all entertainment and all commercials. Many theaters, stores and businesses, including the stock exchanges and government offices, are closed through November 25.\n\nNovember 23, 1963 - Oswald is arraigned for the murder of the president.\n\nNovember 23, 1963 - Johnson designates November 25 as a day of national mourning.\n\nNovember 24, 1963 - As Oswald is being transferred from the Dallas city jail to the county jail, nightclub owner Jack Ruby shoots and kills him. The shooting is inadvertently shown live on TV. Ruby is immediately arrested.\n\nNovember 24-25, 1963 - Kennedy’s flag-draped casket lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda.\n\nNovember 25, 1963 - Kennedy is buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors and representatives from more than 90 countries in attendance.\n\nNovember 26, 1963 - Ruby is indicted in Dallas for the murder of Oswald. He is later convicted, has the conviction overturned on appeal, and dies of cancer in 1967 awaiting a new trial.\n\nNovember 29, 1963 - Johnson appoints the President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. Commonly called the Warren Commission, its purpose is to investigate the assassination.\n\nSeptember 24, 1964 - The Warren Report is released with the following conclusions: “The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally were fired from the sixth-floor window at the southeast corner of the Texas School Book Depository.” And: “The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald.”\n\nOctober 26,1992 - President George H.W. Bush signs the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act into law. The law directs the National Archives to establish a collection of records consisting of any materials, by any state or federal agency, that were created during the federal inquiry into the assassination.\n\nOctober 26, 2017 - The US government releases more than 2,800 records relating to Kennedy’s assassination in an effort to comply with a 1992 law mandating the documents’ release. President Donald Trump keeps roughly 300 files classified out of concern for US national security, law enforcement and foreign relations. In a memo, Trump directs agencies that requested redactions to re-review their reasons for keeping the records secret within 180 days.\n\nApril 26, 2018 - Trump extends to 2021 the deadline for the public release of files related to the assassination. More than 19,000 documents are released by the National Archives, in compliance with the records law and Trump’s 2017 order.\n\nOctober 22, 2021 - The White House announces that it will further postpone the release of more documents related to the assassination, pointing to the “significant impact” of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nDecember 15, 2021 - The National Archives releases almost 1,500 previously classified documents related to the assassination.\n\nDecember 15, 2022 - The National Archives releases over 13,000 previously classified documents collected as part of the government review into the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy."
