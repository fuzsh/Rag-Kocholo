        "text": "Abe Zapruder had no idea when he took his 8-millimeter camera down to Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963 that he would record President Kennedy's assassination. The footage he captured, less than half a minute long, continues to be studied (and to fuel conspiracy theories) to this very day. The following excerpt from by Zapruder's granddaughter Alexandra details how he captured history, and what happened next.\n\nCamera in hand, my grandfather Abe Zapruder went down to Dealey Plaza to scout out a location. He tried a few places, walking all along the curb on Elm Street, but could not find solid footing there. Another spot was blocked by a tree. After a while, his receptionist, Marilyn Sitzman came walking up the hill. All the banks had been closed because of the president's visit, so she gave up and walked back to the plaza, where she encountered Abe taking some test shots of his payroll clerk Beatrice Hester and her husband, Charles, sitting on the pergola at the back of the plaza.\n\nAs Abe continued to look for a place to stand, Marilyn suggested a four foot-high concrete abutment. It was a perfect locationâ€” high above the street, giving him a clear view of the length of Elm; the president and Mrs. Kennedy would ride right past him in the open-top limousine. There was a risk, however: He would need to set the telephoto lens on full zoom in order to get a clear view of them, and he worried that he would get dizzy standing up on the ledge while following them through the lens as they passed by. Since he suffered from vertigo, this was a real possibility. So, as Abe climbed up on the ledge and found his bearings, he asked Marilyn to stand behind him and steady him if he started to lose his balance.\n\nAbe Zapruder wasn't the only photographer on the scene. In fact, there were no fewer than 22 photographers on Dealey Plaza, most of them amateurs, positioned along the last part of the motorcade route. Some were shooting black-and-white or color stills, Polaroids, or 35mm slides, while several others had movie cameras loaded with color film. It seemed everyone had the same idea.\n\nPart of the motorcade route through Dallas.\n\nMary Moorman and James Altgens, their cameras loaded with black-and-white film, were positioned near the curb across the street from where Abe was standing. Farther up the street, near the hairpin turn from Houston to Elm, Phillip Willis stood ready with color film in his camera. Marie Muchmore was standing on the opposite side of Elm from Abe, on a grassy area set back from the street, her movie camera loaded with color film. Over on Main, Orville Nix was waiting with a movie camera and color film, as well.\n\nUp on the concrete ledge, Abe looked out for the motorcade. When the lead motorcycles rounded Houston to Elm Street, he started filming, only to stop when he realized that it was not the president's car yet. He re-cranked the mechanism of the camera to \"full wind\" so that it would run for the maximum amount of time. He didn't start filming again until he could see the president and the first lady coming toward him in the car.\n\nYears later, in an interview she gave with my mother, Marilyn remembered, \"When they started to make their first turn, turning into the street, he said, 'OK, here we go.' \"\n\nThose first few seconds of the film are perfect: The sun is shining and you can clearly see the unmistakable, handsome face of the president as he brushes his hair from his face, lowering his arm as he turns toward the crowds on his right, smiling, and raising his hand again to wave briefly.\n\nThose first few seconds of the film are perfect: The sun is shining and you can clearly see the unmistakable, handsome face of the president as he brushes his hair from his face, lowering his arm as he turns toward the crowds on his right, smiling, and raising his hand again to wave briefly.\n\nFor an instant, the back of a freeway sign obscures the limousine, and then the Kennedys reappear. \"As it came in line with my camera, I heard a shot,\" Abe later recalled. The president's elbows fly up, his face distorted in pain, and he suddenly hunches forward as his wife looks at Governor Connally, sitting in the jump seat across from them, before turning back to her husband with visible confusion on her face. \"I saw the president lean over to Jacqueline. I didn't realize what had happened,\" Abe remembered.\n\nThe President and Mrs. Kennedy shared a limousine with Texas Governor John Connally and his wife Nellie. Governor Connally was also shot, though he made a full recovery.\n\nThe next part of the sequence always feels agonizingly long to me, even though it took place in seconds. The car dips into the lower part of the camera frame, and as the president's body sinks down in the car toward his wife, the fatal shot strikes him. \"And then I realized,\" Abe said. \"I saw his head open up and I started yelling, 'They killed him! They killed him!' \" Jackie recoils, her mouth open in horror, and suddenly she is climbing out of the open- top car, scrambling on the back hood of the limousine, met by Secret Service agent Clint Hill, who pushes her back down into the seat.\n\nFor an instant, Abe and Marilyn stood stunned on the concrete stump, paralyzed by what had just happened. Then someone behind them dropped a soda bottle, which made a loud crack and shattered on the concrete. Marilyn recalled that the noise woke them out of their shocked trance. \"Some people were screaming,\" she said. \"I mean, it was utter chaos by that time. But the first thing I remember is after that bottle hit and I looked down . . . everybody was laying flat on the ground almost. There might have been one or two people still standing but I would say that ninety-eight percent of the people were still laying flat on the side of the hill.\"\n\nAbe never remembered getting down from the ledge or anything that happened in the immediate aftermath of the shooting except for his own anguished screams. A still photo taken by James Altgens of the Associated Press shows Marilyn and Abe in his hat and bow tie, holding the camera; they are faintly visible in the far background, having just gotten down from their perch.\n\nThey moved toward the pergola where the Hesters had been standing during the motorcade, but in the panic and chaos, Abe soon got separated from the rest of them. He was by himself on the plaza, distraught and in a daze, with the camera still in his hand and the case slung over his shoulder, when he encountered Harry McCormick, a reporter from the Dallas Morning News. McCormick had been at the Trade Mart waiting for the president to arrive when he heard of the shooting. He rushed over to Dealey Plaza, where he spotted Abe holding his camera and immediately approached him to find out if he had caught the shooting on film.\n\nAbe answered that he would not speak about the film with anyone but the federal authorities. In Harry's account, it was he who told Abe that the Secret Service would want to see the film, and he offered to get Dallas Secret Service chief Forrest Sorrels and bring him to Jennifer Juniors [the business which Abe owned].\n\nSomehow Abe got back to the office. [His secretary] Lillian remembered that \"Everybody was going nuts, turning on the television. There was nothing and you couldn't get anything on television . . . So anyway, he walked in, and he handed me the camera. He says, 'I've got it all on there.'\" Abe later tried to piece together his memory of the traumatic first moments after the assassination. \"Well, I was in a state of shock when I got back,\" he said, \"and I was kicking and banging the desk. I couldn't understand how a thing like this could happen. I personally have never seen anybody killed in my life, and to see something like this, shooting a man down like a dog, I just couldn't believe.\""
