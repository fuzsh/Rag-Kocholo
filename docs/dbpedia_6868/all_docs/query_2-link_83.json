        "text": "\"It's etched in my memory forever.\" Paramount+ is releasing a new documentary film this fall titled JFK: What The Doctors Saw, turning the latest evidence from the doctors into a whole film. You've probably heard about this as it first came from the doctor's book, but now they have ALL of them sitting down for an interview. Previously unreleased footage unveils an extraordinary reunion involving seven doctors who were present in the Parkland Hospital Emergency Room where President John F. Kennedy was rushed after being shot on November 22nd, 1963. Their testimonies divulge unsettling medical details about the assassination, raising doubt about government investigations that found Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. JFK: What the Doctors Saw also examines the inconsistencies and gaps that plagued the official autopsy, raising even more questions about how many bullets hit the President and what damage they caused, leaving viewers with the looming question: Was there more than one shooter? And what does it all mean? Did the government really take him out? Of course they did. But it will forever be a question without a real answer. What do you think?\n\nHere's the full trailer (+ poster) for Barbara Shearer's doc JFK: What The Doctors Saw, from YouTube:"
