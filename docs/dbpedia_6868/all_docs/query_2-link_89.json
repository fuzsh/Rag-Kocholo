        "text": "On 22 November 1963, the news that President John F. Kennedy had been shot in Texas left America in a state of national shock. The decades that followed would bring a plethora of conspiracy theories in relation to the assassination, from rumours that the American government organised the shooting, to theories that anti-Fidel Castro Cuban groups were incited to kill the president (following the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961).\n\nNow, seven decades on, a new film entitled 2 Days/1963, is expected to promote the theory that organised crime units throughout the US were the real perpetrators of the death. The film is written by Nicholas Celozzi, whose great uncle was the notorious Chicago mobster, Sam Giancana. The film posits that Giancana worked to arrange the assassination of the president as revenge for trying to bring down the mafia after ‘the mob helped put JFK in the White House’.\n\nSam's daughter, Bonnie Giancana, will also serve as a consultant and executive producer on the project. Nicholas has revealed how he heard stories about the assassination from his family, and how he now feels certain they were involved. ‘I feel very solid about all of it,’ he said. ‘My Uncle Joe, we called him Pepe, he was with Giancana those two days when the other guys were down in Dallas […] The story I got, I got from him. The story of the underbelly that pulled it off. When I gave the script to Bonnie Giancana to read, she said you’re about 85 per cent correct.’\n\nTheories of the mob's involvement in Kennedy's death are common, although unfounded. One story goes (and the theory most in tune with 2 Days/1963) that several mafia ‘families’ had allegedly worked with JFK's father, the wealthy American businessman, Joseph Kennedy, to get JFK elected. When news of JFK's vicious crackdown on organised crime throughout the country reached the ears of mafia bosses (after Kennedy had promised a relaxed approach to mob activity from his son), the supposed ‘act of revenge’ was planned.\n\nSome suspect that Lee Oswald, JFK's official shooter, was set up by mafia representatives in Dallas to kill the president. Given his past criminal activity and history of mental instability, Oswald appeared a good fit for ‘the random act of killing' that the mafia would need to remain undercover. Supposed ‘evidence’ for this theorises that Jack Ruby, the club owner that killed Oswald following his arrest ('in a bid to keep him silent'), was an associate of Giancana.\n\nThe film is being headed by the director and producer, David Mamet, whose famous 1981 film, The Untouchables, also centres around illegal underground activity. Per Town and Country, Mamet plans to rewrite the script before production.\n\n‘Nick wrote and sent me this script, and it’s a hell of a script,’ Mamet said. ‘Really inside stuff, similar to what Francis Coppola did with Mario Puzo in The Godfather. What’s The Godfather really about? Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo sitting around a kitchen table and telling the stories they overheard of their grandparents […] That’s why we love that movie. It made me say, I would love to make this movie, and here we are.’\n\nThere's no shortage of films about JFK. From Jackie, a cinematic representation of the aftermath of the president's shooting starring Natalie Portman, to JFK, a political thriller that examines the events leading to the death. 2 Days/1963 will give a new take on the fatal day in 1963, although its accuracy is of course, unconfirmed."
