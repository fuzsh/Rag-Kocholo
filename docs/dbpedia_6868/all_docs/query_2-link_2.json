        "text": "WATCH NOW\n\nThis new documentary on Paramount+ features in-depth talks with seven doctors who were working in the ER at Parkland Hospital when JFK was brought in on the day of his assassination, including their perceptions of his injuries and perspective of the unforgettable event.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nPerhaps the seminal film about the assassination of JFK, this 8-time Oscar nominee weaves a complex tale about the investigation of the assassination led by New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) who faces pushback as he uncovers uncomfortable details that could reveal an even darker layer tot he killing.\n\n(The film is also notable for kicking off writer/director Oliver Stone's milieu of JFK investigations—look out for his name elsewhere on this list.)\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nSpeaking of Oliver Stone, in this documentary (narrated by Whoopi Goldberg and Donald Sutherland) the director examines files about the assassination that were declassified after his 1991, examining the new evidence in context to ferret out what may have happened on that fateful day in 1963.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nAfter his shooting, JFK was rushed to the nearby Parkland Hospital in an attempt to save the president's life. This drama centers on the events that occurred at the hospital and the doctors, secret service agents, and others who would become forever tied to one of the most controversial moments in American history.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nJackie Kennedy was an American icon in her own right, and this drama (starring Natalie Portman as the First Lady) explores the period of her life following the assassination of her husband and the deeply personal trauma left in its wake.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nBased on the sci-fi novel by Stephen King, this series follows Jake (James Franco) a down-and-out teacher from the modern day who finds a door into the past and takes up a quest to change world history by preventing the assassination of JFK.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhile it's not technically a film, this four-part docuseries (also by Oliver Stone) dives into the story of the Kennedy assassination with a true crime bent, digging into the evidence—and sometimes lack of evidence—that still leave questions about the death of JFK."
