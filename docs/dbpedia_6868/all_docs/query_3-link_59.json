        "text": "When the president of the United States makes a public appearance these days, every minute – perhaps every second – is captured from multiple angles by multiple cameras, most of them owned by amateurs. The same was not true in 1963, which is one of the reasons the previously unseen footage of John F Kennedy arriving at Dallas's Love Field airport on the day of his death – released this week by the city's Sixth Floor Museum, which is dedicated to the assassination and its context – is so compelling.\n\nWilliam Ward Warren was a 15-year-old high school student when he filmed the three minutes of 8mm footage the museum released. Local kids were excused lessons because of the presidential visit, so Warren got a ride to the airport from his dad, and borrowed the family home-movie camera, to watch Kennedy's arrival. Mostly showing Air Force One and Air Force Two on the tarmac, his footage also offers glimpses of the waiting crowd (Warren, like them, was on the outside of the airport fence), Texan and Confederate flags, the first couple disembarking and, in the film's final moments, John and Jackie Kennedy, Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson and Texas governor John Connally passing within feet of the camera on their way to the terminal.\n\nKennedy was killed that afternoon as his motorcade drove along Elm Street in downtown Dallas; Connally was also wounded. Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested on suspicion of shooting the president from the sixth floor of the book depository on Dealey Plaza, where the museum is now housed, but was himself shot two days later. According to its curator, Gary Mack, Warren's is \"the best home movie I have seen of the Kennedy arrival in Dallas on November 22, 1963\".\n\nThere are several intriguing aspects to watching such material. Perhaps the overriding sensation is one of tragic irony – to see these smiling figures oblivious to what awaits them can't help but provoke pity and fear. Their humanity is brought into focus by the collision of familiar and novel: the first lady's pink suit and pill-box hat, the president's well-fed smile and that Texan light and Kodak colour have been rendered iconic but distant by that day's better-known home movie, Abraham Zapruder's film of the shooting itself. Yet, here they all are in a fresh context, removed from myth and apparently close enough to touch. Warren says he wasn't sure whether to keep filming or reach out to shake Kennedy's hand.\n\nThis sensation of proximity gives such footage the paradoxical quality of a mediated relic, hinting at a physical link with the extraordinary figure – his image was imprinted on this very film, a celluloid Turin Shroud! – while only in fact being accessible through the analogue technology that recorded it and the digital technology that now disseminates it. Even so, final images of life before death have an eerily memorial power for iconic public figures with whom we interact primarily through images; the CCTV pictures of Diana in the revolving door of the Paris Ritz have a similar impact.\n\nAlthough an early, untimely death is necessary to establish tragic icon status, it isn't sufficient. Kennedy also had charisma and celebrity appeal unusual for a politician. He was the president who could have passed for a movie star (as opposed to Reagan, the movie star who passed for a president). Warren's footage of the scene at Love Field shows glimpses of excited faces in the crowd against the fence, arms and posters waving toward the runway; it's not so different in kind from the response that greeted the Beatles on their arrival in America a mere 11 weeks later, at the New York airport already renamed in honour of the fallen President. Warren's footage does not, of course, offer the kind of behind-closed-doors intimacy of, say, the material unveiled last year which purported to show Marilyn Monroe getting high, but it appeals to the same sense of personal – as opposed to political – curiosity, marking him out as a key figure in the development of postwar celebrity culture. There have been few politicians to whom we are so pruriently attracted – the current president and our own Iron Lady notwithstanding.\n\nIt's more or less a commonplace that everyone's a paparazzo these days – any time a public figure is in public, they can expect to be photographed and filmed, whether or not someone who makes their living by doing such things happens to be around. In this respect, as in so many, Kennedy is a pivotal figure: famously pioneering the exploitation of the polished image and new-media savvy (in his case television) now recognised as necessary for US political success, he was also spared the levels of exposure such figures can expect today. The giant TV vans Warren shows us are a reminder of a time when cameras couldn't be expected to reach everywhere and moving images were disseminated only via major institutions or at home on the living-room wall. An era of telephoto lenses, sex tapes, medical prying and online distribution would not necessarily have been kind to Kennedy. As it is, footage of JFK like this week's combines the arm's-length glamour of classical Hollywood with intimations of world-historical rupture and personal tragedy. No wonder we like to watch."
