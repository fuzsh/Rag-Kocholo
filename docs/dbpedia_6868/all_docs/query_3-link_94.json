        "text": "August 8, 2024\n\nKamala Harris and Tim Walz will officially accept their nominations at the Democratic National Convention. A scholar of the presidency shares memorable moments from previous events.\n\nJuly 2, 2024\n\nTrump and the movement behind him is both new and old. Times are unprecedented but also, to historians of America, frighteningly familiar. Nick Bryant’s book excavates that history.\n\nJune 26, 2024\n\nWhile people now reflect on how or whether Nixon’s sweaty, haggard appearance during the debate cost him the election, the view in 1960 was that the debate was a draw.\n\nJune 12, 2024\n\nRFK Jr wants to get into the television debates, but so far, it’s not looking likely.\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\nWith wealth, charm and tactful leadership, John F. Kennedy set the standard for working toward the common good and decency in public discourse\n\nMarch 15, 2024\n\nA scholar of history of education and American politics explains what is behind his course on conspiracy theories and how students learn to debunk fake ideas.\n\nNovember 21, 2023\n\nHundreds of Australians wrote to Jackie Kennedy after her husband was killed. The letters paint a revealing portrait of who we were and who we wanted to be.\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\nThe event shocked the world. But it also sparked the minds of filmmakers, authors, artists and conspiracy theorists.\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\nJFK’s leadership style has been hugely influential, acting as a model emulated by subsequent presidents including Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama.\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\nThe JFK assassination was a landmark event in TV news history.\n\nMarch 16, 2023\n\nGothic storytelling, with its sinister atmosphere of conspiracy and other hallmarks, offers a way to reframe the Kennedy family lore.\n\nNovember 25, 2020\n\nIn 1967 a Mexican reporter told the CIA he had met Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico City just before the JFK assassination. New research and recently declassified intelligence pokes a hole in his story.\n\nNovember 1, 2020\n\nRewatching the 1991 film classic JFK shows the intricate choreography of montage — and the line between fact and truth still being navigated today.\n\nJune 18, 2020\n\nThe technology isn’t the problem – conspiracy theories were around long before the internet.\n\nJune 10, 2020\n\nThe agency’s earliest ad campaigns emphasized youthful idealism, patriotism and travel opportunities. That was an easier sell than urging Americans to enlist in an anti-communist operation.\n\nMay 27, 2020\n\nThe process of coming to terms with a loss is central to these films, which are aching and inventive renderings of complex feelings and moments.\n\nApril 2, 2020\n\nDuring our current bout of collective trauma, many of our coping strategies have mimicked the ways Americans responded to the Kennedy assassination.\n\nMarch 15, 2019\n\nJFK pushed consumer rights to the top of the national agenda in 1962, leading to a raft of new laws offering new protections. But without enforcement, such rights are meaningless.\n\nJanuary 29, 2019\n\nA decade ago, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the latest legislative effort to close the persistent gap between how much women and men earn. Here’s why it hasn’t made much of a difference."
