        "text": "JFK’s assassination has been dramatised many times on screen. But now a new movie tells the story of the ordinary people caught up in the tragedy. Tom Brook reports.\n\nIt was a murder that shook America – and became a rich source for debate, conspiracy theories and artistic interpretation. As the 50th anniversary of John F Kennedy’s shooting draws near, a new film about the tragic events, called Parkland, is being released.\n\nThe movie, which was co-produced by Tom Hanks, tells the story from the perspective of the ordinary people who were caught up in the action – including the staff at the Parkland hospital, where Kennedy was rushed.\n\nTeen heartthrob Zac Efron stars as one of the doctors who treated Kennedy, and Jacki Weaver plays Lee Harvey Oswald’s mother. Paul Giamatti plays Dallas businessman Abraham Zapruder, who was filming the presidential motorcade with his home movie camera when the fateful shots were fired.\n\nThe film, which premiered at the Venice film festival, has polarised audiences – with some accusing the filmmakers of cashing in on the anniversary of JFK’s death. Tom Brook talks with Parkland’s director, Peter Landesman and its stars, Giamatti and Weaver, to find out more.\n\nFacebook page or message us on Twitter."
