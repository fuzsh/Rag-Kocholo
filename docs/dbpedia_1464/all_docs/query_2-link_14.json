        "text": "Is there a cocktail renaissance happening in Scandinavia? In this April issue of Scan Magazine, we head to Copenhagen to find out. There are profiles of Sweden’s 10 top fashion brands, as well exclusive interviews with the CEO of the Swedish Fashion Council Jennie Rosén, and Louise Lyngh Bjerregaard – one of the most exciting emerging designers out of Denmark in the past two years. In the culture section, we meet BAFTA-nominated filmmaker Marie Lidén for a chat about her new documentary, Electric Malady. Plus, check out curated special themes on Norway’s buzzing art scene, the top experiences in Finland in 2023, and our monthly Best Of guides for where to stay, eat and play, and the culture calendar for everything you don’t want to miss in Scandinavia, this April."
