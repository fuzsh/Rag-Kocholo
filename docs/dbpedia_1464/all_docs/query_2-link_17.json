A standardized system would facilitate therapeutic decisions and the analysis of clinical trial data. To assess the feasibility, reliability, validity and sensitivity to change of the Spanish Acne Severity Scale (EGAE). A Spanish, multicentre, prospective, observational study was performed in patients with facial, back or chest acne assessed using EGAE, Leeds Revised Acne Grading system (LRAG) and lesion count. Clinicians answered 4 questions regarding EGAE use and time employed. Patients were evaluated at baseline and after 5Â±1 weeks. Four additional blinded observers, all dermatologists, evaluated patients' pictures using EGAE and LRAG. In total, 349 acne locations were assessed in 328 patients. Of the dermatologists, 95.6% (CI: 92.9-97.5%) reported that EGAE was easy to use, and 75% used it in 0.85; p<0.001). EGAE mean score in treatment-compliant patients was significantly lower at follow-up than at baseline (2.14 vs. 1.57, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.35).The pre-post-treatment difference in EGAE mean score in non-compliant patients was not significant (1.44 vs. 1.32, p<0.102) and Cohen's d was lower (0.19) than in compliant patients. The use of EGAE to evaluate acne grade in daily clinical dermatological practice in Spanish centres has shown feasibility, high interobserver reliability, concurrent validity and sensitivity to detect treatment effects.\n\nEgas Moniz: 90 Years (1927-2017) from Cerebral Angiography.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nArtico, Marco; Spoletini, Marialuisa; Fumagalli, Lorenzo; Biagioni, Francesca; Ryskalin, Larisa; Fornai, Francesco; Salvati, Maurizio; Frati, Alessandro; Pastore, Francesco Saverio; Taurone, Samanta\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn June 2017 we celebrate the 90th anniversary of the pioneer discovery of cerebral angiography, the seminal imaging technique used for visualizing cerebral blood vessels and vascular alterations as well as other intracranial disorders. Egas Moniz (1874-1955) was the first to describe the use of this revolutionary technique which, until 1975 (when computed tomography, CT, scan was introduced in the clinical practice), was the sole diagnostic tool to provide an imaging of cerebral vessels and therefore alterations due to intracranial pathology. Moniz introduced in the clinical practice this fundamental and important diagnostic tool. The present contribution wishes to pay a tribute to the Portuguese neurosurgeon, who was also a distinguished neurologist and statesman. Despite his tremendous contribution in modern brain imaging, Egas Moniz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1949 for prefrontal leucotomy, the neurosurgical intervention nowadays unacceptable, but should rather be remembered for his key contribution to modern brain imaging.\n\nAnalysis of the Efficiency of Surfactant-Mediated Stabilization Reactions of EGaIn Nanodroplets.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFinkenauer, Lauren R; Lu, Qingyun; Hakem, Ilhem F; Majidi, Carmel; Bockstaller, Michael R\n\n2017-09-26\n\nA methodology based on light scattering and spectrophotometry was developed to evaluate the effect of organic surfactants on the size and yield of eutectic gallium/indium (EGaIn) nanodroplets formed in organic solvents by ultrasonication. The process was subsequently applied to systematically evaluate the role of headgroup chemistry as well as polar/apolar interactions of aliphatic surfactant systems on the efficiency of nanodroplet formation. Ethanol was found to be the most effective solvent medium in promoting the formation and stabilization of EGaIn nanodroplets. For the case of thiol-based surfactants in ethanol, the yield of nanodroplet formation increased with the number of carbon atoms in the aliphatic part. In the case of the most effective surfactant system-octadecanethiol-the nanodroplet yield increased by about 370% as compared to pristine ethanol. The rather low overall efficiency of the reaction process along with the incompatibility of surfactant-stabilized EGaIn nanodroplets in nonpolar organic solvents suggests that the stabilization mechanism differs from the established self-assembled monolayer formation process that has been widely observed in nanoparticle formation.\n\nEgas Moniz: 90 Years (1927â2017) from Cerebral Angiography\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nArtico, Marco; Spoletini, Marialuisa; Fumagalli, Lorenzo; Biagioni, Francesca; Ryskalin, Larisa; Fornai, Francesco; Salvati, Maurizio; Frati, Alessandro; Pastore, Francesco Saverio; Taurone, Samanta\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn June 2017 we celebrate the 90th anniversary of the pioneer discovery of cerebral angiography, the seminal imaging technique used for visualizing cerebral blood vessels and vascular alterations as well as other intracranial disorders.

In acidic endosomes, its translocation domain inserts into endosomal membranes and facilitates the transport of the catalytic domain (DTA from endosomal lumen into the host cell cytosol. Here, DTA ADP-ribosylates elongation factor 2 inhibits protein synthesis and leads to cell death. The compound 4-bromobenzaldehyde N-(2,6-dimethylphenylsemicarbazone (EGA has been previously shown to protect cells from various bacterial protein toxins which deliver their enzymatic subunits from acidic endosomes to the cytosol, including Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin and the binary clostridial actin ADP-ribosylating toxins C2, iota and Clostridium difficile binary toxin (CDT. Here, we demonstrate that EGA also protects human cells from diphtheria toxin by inhibiting the pH-dependent translocation of DTA across cell membranes. The results suggest that EGA might serve for treatment and/or prevention of the severe disease diphtheria.\n\nEGA Protects Mammalian Cells from Clostridium difficile CDT, Clostridium perfringens Iota Toxin and Clostridium botulinum C2 Toxin.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchnell, Leonie; Mittler, Ann-Katrin; Sadi, Mirko; Popoff, Michel R; Schwan, Carsten; Aktories, Klaus; Mattarei, Andrea; Azarnia Tehran, Domenico; Montecucco, Cesare; Barth, Holger\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe pathogenic bacteria Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium botulinum produce the binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins CDT, iota and C2, respectively. These toxins are composed of a transport component (B) and a separate enzyme component (A). When both components assemble on the surface of mammalian target cells, the B components mediate the entry of the A components via endosomes into the cytosol. Here, the A components ADP-ribosylate G-actin, resulting in depolymerization of F-actin, cell-rounding and eventually death. In the present study, we demonstrate that 4-bromobenzaldehyde N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)semicarbazone (EGA), a compound that protects cells from multiple toxins and viruses, also protects different mammalian epithelial cells from all three binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins. In contrast, EGA did not inhibit the intoxication of cells with Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, indicating a possible different entry route for this toxin. EGA does not affect either the binding of the C2 toxin to the cells surface or the enzyme activity of the A components of CDT, iota and C2, suggesting that this compound interferes with cellular uptake of the toxins. Moreover, for C2 toxin, we demonstrated that EGA inhibits the pH-dependent transport of the A component across cell membranes. EGA is not cytotoxic, and therefore, we propose it as a lead compound for the development of novel pharmacological inhibitors against clostridial binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins.\n\nEGA Protects Mammalian Cells from Clostridium difficile CDT, Clostridium perfringens Iota Toxin and Clostridium botulinum C2 Toxin\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchnell, Leonie; Mittler, Ann-Katrin; Sadi, Mirko; Popoff, Michel R.; Schwan, Carsten; Aktories, Klaus; Mattarei, Andrea; Tehran, Domenico Azarnia; Montecucco, Cesare; Barth, Holger\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe pathogenic bacteria Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium botulinum produce the binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins CDT, iota and C2, respectively.

This enhancement is achieved through a room-temperature \"sintering\" process in which the liquid-phase EGaIn alloy binds the AgNP particles (â100 nm diameter) to form a continuous conductive trace. Ultrathin and hydrographically transferrable electronics are produced by printing traces with a composition of AgNP-Ga-In on a 5 Âµm-thick temporary tattoo paper. The printed circuit is flexible enough to remain functional when deformed and can support strains above 80% with modest electromechanical coupling (gauge factor â1). These mechanically robust thin-film circuits are well suited for transfer to highly curved and nondevelopable 3D surfaces as well as skin and other soft deformable substrates. In contrast to other stretchable tattoo-like electronics, the low-cost processing steps introduced here eliminate the need for cleanroom fabrication and instead requires only a commercial desktop printer. Most significantly, it enables functionalities like \"electronic tattoos\" and 3D hydrographic transfer that have not been previously reported with EGaIn or EGaIn-based biphasic electronics.

Contemporary republican legislation established marriage annulment in medical terms and punished relations between persons of the same sex, or contra natura. In his report, Moniz attempted to interpret distinctive elements of the life of the subject using sexological categories, illustrating the interaction between these categories and the changing forms adopted by homosexuality (or homosexual people) of the time.\n\nCaraterizaÃ§Ã£o dos utentes das consultas de periodontologia na ClÃ­nica DentÃ¡ria UniversitÃ¡ria Egas Moniz\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nAfonso, AndrÃ© Filipe Rodrigues\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDissertaÃ§Ã£o para obtenÃ§Ã£o do grau de Mestre no Instituto Superior de CiÃªncias da SaÃºde Egas Moniz Objetivo: caraterizar os utentes das consultas de periodontologia da clÃ­nica dentÃ¡ria universitÃ¡ria Egas Moniz, procurando identificar os fatores de risco mais associados Ã doenÃ§a periodontal (DP) desta populaÃ§Ã£o.

Nevertheless, complex computational workflows are required to interpret these data. Over the past years, the data volume has been growing explosively, requiring robust human data management to organise and integrate the data efficiently. For this reason, we set up an ELIXIR implementation study, together with the Translational research IT (TraIT programme, to design a data ecosystem that is able to link raw and interpreted data. In this project, the data from the TraIT Cell Line Use Case (TraIT-CLUC are used as a test case for this system. Within this ecosystem, we use the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA to store raw molecular profiling data; tranSMART to collect interpreted molecular profiling data and clinical data for corresponding samples; and Galaxy to store, run and manage the computational workflows. We can integrate these data by linking their repositories systematically. To showcase our design, we have structured the TraIT-CLUC data, which contain a variety of molecular profiling data types, for storage in both tranSMART and EGA. The metadata provided allows referencing between tranSMART and EGA, fulfilling the cycle of data submission and discovery; we have also designed a data flow from EGA to Galaxy, enabling reanalysis of the raw data in Galaxy. In this way, users can select patient cohorts in tranSMART, trace them back to the raw data and perform (reanalysis in Galaxy. Our conclusion is that the majority of metadata does not necessarily need to be stored (redundantly in both databases, but that instead FAIR persistent identifiers should be available for well-defined data ontology levels: study, data access committee, physical sample, data sample and raw data file. This approach will pave the way for the stable linkage and reuse of data.\n\nDefining the value of injection current and effective electrical contact area for EGaIn-based molecular tunneling junctions.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSimeone, Felice C; Yoon, Hyo Jae; Thuo, Martin M; Barber, Jabulani R; Smith, Barbara; Whitesides, George M\n\n2013-12-04\n\nAnalysis of rates of tunneling across self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of n-alkanethiolates SCn (with n = number of carbon atoms) incorporated in junctions having structure Ag(TS)-SAM//Ga2O3/EGaIn leads to a value for the injection tunnel current density J0 (i.e., the current flowing through an ideal junction with n = 0) of 10(3.6Â±0.3) AÂ·cm(-2) (V = +0.5 V). This estimation of J0 does not involve an extrapolation in length, because it was possible to measure current densities across SAMs over the range of lengths n = 1-18. This value of J0 is estimated under the assumption that values of the geometrical contact area equal the values of the effective electrical contact area. Detailed experimental analysis, however, indicates that the roughness of the Ga2O3 layer, and that of the Ag(TS)-SAM, determine values of the effective electrical contact area that are ~10(-4) the corresponding values of the geometrical contact area. Conversion of the values of geometrical contact area into the corresponding values of effective electrical contact area results in J0(+0.5 V) = 10(7.6Â±0.8) AÂ·cm(-2), which is compatible with values reported for junctions using top-electrodes of evaporated Au, and graphene, and also comparable with values of J0 estimated from tunneling through single molecules. For these EGaIn-based junctions, the value of the tunneling decay factor Î² (Î² = 0.75 Â± 0.02 Ã (-1); Î² = 0.92 Â± 0.02 nC(-1)) falls within the consensus range across different types of junctions (Î² = 0.73-0.89 Ã (-1); Î² = 0.9-1.1 nC(-1)). A comparison of the characteristics of conical Ga2O3/EGaIn tips with the characteristics of other top-electrodes suggests that the EGaIn-based electrodes provide a particularly attractive technology for physical-organic studies of charge transport across SAMs.\n\nFragmento de inscriÃ§Ã£o funerÃ¡ria romana do PaÃ§o da Ega (Conimbriga â Conventus Scallabitanus)\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nRevez, Ana Lima; EncarnaÃ§Ã£o, JosÃ© d'\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDÃ¡-se a conhecer o fragmento de uma inscriÃ§Ã£o funerÃ¡ria romana, que foi reaproveitada na parede do PalÃ¡cio da Ega (concelho de Condeixa-a-Nova), no termo da cidade romana de Conimbriga, donde poderÃ¡ ter provindo.\n\n\"MÃ¡s piedad que improperios\" : un informe pericial del Dr. Egas Moniz sobre homosexualidad\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMolina Artaloytia, Francisco\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA principios del siglo XX, Egas Moniz, insigne neurÃ³logo y Premio Nobel portuguÃ©s, emitiÃ³ un informe pericial sobre homosexualidad para un caso de anulaciÃ³n matrimonial que constituye un material de gran valor como ejemplo de aplicaciÃ³n efectiva del conocimiento sexolÃ³gico disponible en la Ã©poca.

Pavillion, at the Juqueri State Hospital, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, observed between February 1936 anti December 1945. One hundred and sixty-one patients were operated on by the Egas Moniz's method of leucotomy and 48 by the Freeman and Watts's technique of prefrontal lobotomy. Since January 1946, we are performing the Freeman and Watts's prefrontal lobotomy in three stages for the purpose of determining the effets of incisions in different parts of the prefrontal region as regards mental condition. The available data about this subject are not sufficient to warrant any conclusion and are not discussed here. The majority of our patients were chronic schizophrenics already treated by two or more of the most recent shock therapy methods. The operations were performed by the chief neurosurgeon Dr. A. Mattos Pimenta and his assistants Drs. A. Sette Junior and A. C. Barretto. The results of the Egas Moniz's leucotomy are listed as follows: Schizophrenia (135 cases - failures (108, complete or social recovery (21, deaths (2, improved (4; Feeble minded with other symptoms as prolonged episodes, excitement states (13 cases - failures (7, complete recovery (5, improved (1; Manic-depressive psychosis (5 cases - failures (3, complete recovery (2 psychopathic personality (3 cases - failure (1, improved (1, complete recovery (1; Severe neurosis (2 cases - complete recovery (2; Dementia paralytica (1 case - improved (1; Encephalitis sequellae (2 cases - improved (1, greatly improved (1.

The present study is a brief description of rabies virus (RABV dissemination in tissues of a naturally infected pregnant southern yellow bat (Lasiurus ega and its fetuses, obtained by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR. The RT-PCR was positive in samples from the brain, salivary gland, tongue, lungs, heart, kidneys and liver. On the other hand, the placenta, three fetuses, spleen, intestine and brown fat tissue tested negative. This research demonstrated the absence of rabies virus in the fetuses, thus, in this specific case, the transplacentary transmission was not observed.\n\nO conflito sexual infantil abordado de um ponto de vista psicanalÃ­tico por Egas Moniz, o pai da psicocirurgia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSophie Maurissen\n\n2012-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Em sua conferÃªncia sobre O conflito sexual, proferida no Congresso Luso-Espanhol das AssociaÃ§Ãµes para o Progresso das CiÃªncias e publicada em 1921, Egas Moniz aplica o mÃ©todo psicanalÃ­tico em dois casos clÃ­nicos, utilizando para isso o divÃ£ e fazendo uso da associaÃ§Ã£o livre, da associaÃ§Ã£o de ideias, assim como da anÃ¡lise dos sonhos. Esse neurocirurgiÃ£o, principalmente reconhecido por seus estudos sobre a leucotomia prÃ©-frontal, foi a primeira pessoa a se referir e a recorrer Ã psicanÃ¡lise em Portugal. De fato, tal como Freud, Egas Moniz analisou dois casos da literatura apoiando-se no mÃ©todo analÃ­tico: o caso de JÃºlio Dinis em 1924 e o de Camilo em 1925. No entanto, sua contribuiÃ§Ã£o Ã psicopatologia parece assombrada por seu trabalho sobre a leucotomia, que lhe valeu o PrÃªmio Nobel de Fisiologia em 1949.\n\nÂ«MÃ¡s piedad que improperiosÂ»: un informe pericial del Dr. Egas Moniz sobre homosexualidad\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMolina Artaloytia, Francisco\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA principios del siglo XX, Egas Moniz, insigne neurÃ³logo y Premio Nobel portuguÃ©s, emitiÃ³ un informe pericial sobre homosexualidad para un caso de anulaciÃ³n matrimonial que constituye un material de gran valor como ejemplo de aplicaciÃ³n efectiva del conocimiento sexolÃ³gico disponible en la Ã©poca.

The increase in R is caused by the presence of water and ions in the supramolecular assemblies which react with the Ga2O3/EGaIn layer and increase the thickness of the Ga2O3 layer. This increase in the oxide thickness from 0.7 nm to â¼2.0 nm changed the nature of the monolayer-top-electrode contact from an ohmic to a non-ohmic contact. These results unambiguously expose the experimental conditions that allow for a safe bias window of Â±1.0 V (the range of biases studies of charge transport using this technique are normally conducted) to investigate molecular effects in molecular electronic junctions with Ga2O3/EGaIn top-electrodes where electrochemical reactions are not significant. Our findings also show that the interpretation of data in studies involving applied biases of >1.0 V may be complicated by electrochemical side reactions which can be recognized by changes of the electrical characteristics as a function voltage cycling or in current retention experiments.\n\nBias induced transition from an ohmic to a non-ohmic interface in supramolecular tunneling junctions with Ga2O3/EGaIn top electrodes\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nWimbush, K.S.; Fratila, R.M.; Wang, D.D.; Qi, D.C.; Liang, C.; Yuan, L.; Yakovlev, N.; Loh, K.P.; Reinhoudt, D.N.; Velders, A.H.; Nijhuis, C.A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis study describes that the current rectification ratio, R h equivalent to vertical bar J vertical bar(+2.0 V)/vertical bar J vertical bar(+2.0 V) for supramolecular tunneling junctions with a top-electrode of eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) that contains a conductive thin (0.7 nm) supporting\n\n[Typology of nosocomial architecture on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, XVI century. Enrique Egas' model in Spain and Vasco de Quiroga's model in New Spain].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRodrÃ­guez-Orozco, Alain Raimundo; RodrÃ­guez PÃ©rez, Martha Eugenia\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTwo visions of the nosocomial architecture are discussed, located in a close time period, 1505-1535, but inserted in two different scenarios. One is in the Renaissance Spain, proposed by the architect E. Egas (born in Toledo, Spain), and the other one in the New Spain, proposed by V. de Quiroga, who chose an architectural style coherent with the Franciscan ideals of humbleness and evangelization, which set aside the ornamentation typical of Spanish medieval hospitals rather than palatial monuments built by E. Egas. The \"hospital-village\" project by V. de Quiroga allowed the patients and their families to live together, which was accepted by pre-Hispanic families that in the time were extensive. The hospital-village, both in its typology and in its health conception, returns to designs already in disuse of the Spanish Middle Age by picking up the idea of a hospital as a multifunctional space in which sanitary attention, nurseries, and shelters for poor people were combined within the church.\n\nCharacterizing the Phyllosilicates and Amorphous Phases Found by MSL Using Laboratory XRD and EGA Measurements of Natural and Synthetic Materials\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRampe, Elizabeth B.; Morris, Richard V.; Chipera, Steve; Bish, David L.; Bristow, Thomas; Archer, Paul Douglas; Blake, David; Achilles, Cherie; Ming, Douglas W.; Vaniman, David;\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Curiosity Rover landed on the Peace Vallis alluvial fan in Gale crater on August 5, 2012. A primary mission science objective is to search for past habitable environments, and, in particular, to assess the role of past water. Identifying the minerals and mineraloids that result from aqueous alteration at Gale crater is essential for understanding past aqueous processes at the MSL landing site and hence for interpreting the site's potential habitability. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data from the CheMin instrument and evolved gas analyses (EGA) from the SAM instrument have helped the MSL science team identify phases that resulted from aqueous processes: phyllosilicates and amorphous phases were measure in two drill samples (John Klein and Cumberland) obtained from the Sheepbed Member, Yellowknife Bay Fm., which is believed to represent a fluvial-lacustrine environment. A third set of analyses was obtained from scoop samples from the Rocknest sand shadow. Chemical data from the APXS instrument have helped constrain the chemical compositions of these secondary phases and suggest that the phyllosilicate component is Mg-enriched and the amorphous component is Fe-enriched, relatively Si-poor, and S- and H-bearing. To refine the phyllosilicate and amorphous components in the samples measured by MSL, we measured XRD and EGA data for a variety of relevant natural terrestrial phyllosilicates and synthetic mineraloids in laboratory testbeds of the CheMin and SAM instruments. Specifically, Mg-saturated smectites and vermiculites were measured with XRD at low relative humidity to understand the behavior of the 001 reflections under Mars-like conditions. Our laboratory XRD measurements suggest that interlayer cation composition affects the hydration state of swelling clays at low RH and, thus, the 001 peak positions. XRD patterns of synthetic amorphous materials, including allophane, ferrihydrite, and hisingerite were used in full-pattern fitting (FULLPAT) models to help\n\nReplacing -CH2CH2- with -CONH- does not significantly change rates of charge transport through Ag(TS)-SAM//Ga2O3/EGaIn junctions.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nThuo, Martin M; Reus, William F; Simeone, Felice C; Kim, Choongik; Schulz, Michael D; Yoon, Hyo Jae; Whitesides, George M\n\n2012-07-04\n\nThis paper describes physical-organic studies of charge transport by tunneling through self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), based on systematic variations of the structure of the molecules constituting the SAM. Replacing a -CH(2)CH(2)- group with a -CONH- group changes the dipole moment and polarizability of a portion of the molecule and has, in principle, the potential to change the rate of charge transport through the SAM. In practice, this substitution produces no significant change in the rate of charge transport across junctions of the structure Ag(TS)-S(CH(2))(m)X(CH(2))(n)H//Ga(2)O(3)/EGaIn (TS = template stripped, X = -CH(2)CH(2)- or -CONH-, and EGaIn = eutectic alloy of gallium and indium). Incorporation of the amide group does, however, increase the yields of working (non-shorting) junctions (when compared to n-alkanethiolates of the same length). These results suggest that synthetic schemes that combine a thiol group on one end of a molecule with a group, R, to be tested, on the other (e.g., HS~CONH~R) using an amide-based coupling provide practical routes to molecules useful in studies of molecular electronics.\n\nPronounced Environmental Effects on Injection Currents in EGaIn Tunneling Junctions Comprising Self-Assembled Monolayers.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCarlotti, Marco; Degen, Maarten; Zhang, Yanxi; Chiechi, Ryan C\n\n2016-09-15\n\nLarge-area tunneling junctions using eutectic Ga-In (EGaIn) as a top contact have proven to be a robust, reproducible, and technologically relevant platform for molecular electronics. Thus far, the majority of studies have focused on saturated molecules with backbones consisting mainly of alkanes in which the frontier orbitals are either highly localized or energetically inaccessible. We show that self-assembled monolayers of wire-like oligophenyleneethynylenes (OPEs), which are fully conjugated, only exhibit length-dependent tunneling behavior in a low-O 2 environment. We attribute this unexpected behavior to the sensitivity of injection current on environment. We conclude that, contrary to previous reports, the self-limiting layer of Ga 2 O 3 strongly influences transport properties and that the effect is related to the wetting behavior of the electrode. This result sheds light on the nature of the electrode-molecule interface and suggests that adhesive forces play a significant role in tunneling charge-transport in large-area molecular junctions.\n\nInnovation in medicine: Ignaz the reviled and Egas the regaled.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCsoka, Antonei Benjamin\n\n2016-06-01\n\nIn our current climate of rapid technological progress, it seems counterintuitive to think that modern science can learn anything of ethical value from the dark recesses of the nineteenth century or earlier. However, this happens to be quite true, with plenty of knowledge and wisdom to be gleaned by studying our scientific predecessors. Presently, our journals are flooded with original concepts and potential breakthroughs, a continuous stream of ideas pushing the frontiers of knowledge ever forward. Some ideas flourish while others flounder; but what sets the two apart? The distinguishing feature between success and failure within this context is the ability to discern the appropriate time to accept an innovation with open arms, versus when to take a more cautious approach. And the primary arbiters for whether an idea will catch on or not are the professional audience. I illustrate this concept by comparing the initial reception of two innovative ideas from Medicine's past: sterile technique, and prefrontal lobotomy. Sterile technique was first introduced by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis and was initially ridiculed and rejected, with Semmelweis eventually dying in exile. Conversely, lobotomy was accepted and lauded and its inventor, Dr. Egas Moniz, won the Nobel Prize for his \"discovery\". This begs the question: why was a technique with the potential to save millions of lives initially rejected, whereas paradoxically, one that compromised and sometimes destroyed lives, accepted? Here I explore and analyze the potential reasons why, suggest how we can learn from these mistakes of the pastÂ and apply new insight to some current ethical dilemmas.\n\nKinetics of Cold-Cap Reactions for Vitrification of Nuclear Waste Glass Based on Simultaneous Differential Scanning Calorimetry - Thermogravimetry (DSC-TGA) and Evolved Gas Analysis (EGA)\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nRodriguez, Carmen P.; Pierce, David A.; Schweiger, Michael J.; Kruger, Albert A.; Chun, Jaehun; Hrma, Pavel R.\n\n2013-12-03\n\nFor vitrifying nuclear waste glass, the feed, a mixture of waste with glass-forming and modifying additives, is charged onto the cold cap that covers 90-100% of the melt surface. The cold cap consists of a layer of reacting molten glass floating on the surface of the melt in an all-electric, continuous glass melter. As the feed moves through the cold cap, it undergoes chemical reactions and phase transitions through which it is converted to molten glass that moves from the cold cap into the melt pool. The process involves a series of reactions that generate multiple gases and subsequent mass loss and foaming significantly influence the mass and heat transfers. The rate of glass melting, which is greatly influenced by mass and heat transfers, affects the vitrification process and the efficiency of the immobilization of nuclear waste. We studied the cold-cap reactions of a representative waste glass feed using both the simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry thermogravimetry (DSC-TGA) and the thermogravimetry coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (TGA-GC-MS) as complementary tools to perform evolved gas analysis (EGA). Analyses from DSC-TGA and EGA on the cold-cap reactions provide a key element for the development of an advanced cold-cap model. It also helps to formulate melter feeds for higher production rate.\n\nCombining a coupled FTIR-EGA system and in situ DRIFTS for studying soil organic matter in arable soils\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nM.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nasopharyngeal cultures were performed in children from rooms B (RB (n = 35 and C (RC (n = 37. The Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP patterns were compared among GAS isolates. A social networks questionnaire was filled out for each child and 10 classmates. Structure coefficients were compared among children with and without GAS. RESULTS: Four GAS clones were identified; clone I in five children from RC; clone II in two from RC and one from RB; clone III in one from RB and one from RC; and clone IV in one from RC. Social network structure: Density of RB and RC = 0.40 (Â± 0.87 and 0.35 (Â± 0.80, respectively. In RB, the homophily pattern of interaction was different in carriers (0.00, non-carriers (0.47 and both (0.47 p = 0.35. In RC, the homophily pattern was also different in carriers (0.46, non-carriers (0.68 and mixed (0.19, p = .001. In 4/5 with clone I, the values of degree, closeness and betweenness were above the group mean. In 3/3 with clone II, the values of degree and betweenness were also above the mean. In contrast, in those with clone III and IV, the values of degree, closeness and betweenness were below the group mean. CONCLUSION: The spread of specific GAS clones was associated with groups of children having a high proportion of ties and a high centrality level. This is evidence that spread of GAS strains among children attending day-care centers is not random but dependent on the degree of communication and physical contact between pairs.OBJETIVO: Evaluar el efecto de grados diferentes de centralidad con la presencia de clonas idÃ©nticas de estreptococo del grupo A (EGA en la nasofaringe de niÃ±os de una guarderÃ­a pÃºblica de MÃ©xico.

Here Ag(TS) is a template-stripped silver substrate, -M- and -T are \"middle\" and \"terminal\" functional groups, and EGaIn is eutectic gallium-indium alloy. Twelve uncharged polar groups (-T = CN, CO2CH3, CF3, OCH3, N(CH3)2, CON(CH3)2, SCH3, SO2CH3, Br, P(O)(OEt)2, NHCOCH3, OSi(OCH3)3), having permanent dipole moments in the range 0.5 < Î¼ < 4.5, were incorporated into the SAM. A comparison of the electrical characteristics of these junctions with those of junctions formed from n-alkanethiolates led to the conclusion that the rates of charge tunneling are insensitive to the replacement of terminal alkyl groups with the terminal polar groups in this set. The current densities measured in this work suggest that the tunneling decay parameter and injection current for SAMs terminated in nonpolar n-alkyl groups, and polar groups selected from common polar organic groups, are statistically indistinguishable.\n\nCharacterizing the Phyllosilicate Component of the Sheepbed Mudstone in Gale Crater, Mars Using Laboratory XRD and EGA\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRampe, E. B.; Morris, R. V.; Ming, D. W.; Archer, P. D.; Bish, D. L.; Chipera, S. J.; Vaniman, D. T.; Blake, D. F.; Bristow, T. F.; Sutter, B.;\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Curiosity rover investigated the mineralogy of the Sheepbed mudstone member of the Yellowknife Bay formation in Gale crater. Data from the Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) X-ray diffractometer (XRD) helped identify phyllosilicates in the two drilled samples, John Klein and Cumberland. These patterns showed peaks at low angles, consistent with (001) peaks in 2:1 swelling phyllosilicates [1]. Evolved gas analyses (EGA) by the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument of these samples confirmed the presence of phyllosilicates through the release of H2O at high temperatures, consistent with dehydroxylation of octahedral OH in phyllosilicates [2]. CheMin data for the phyllosilicates at John Klein and Cumberland show that they are structurally similar in that their (02l) peaks are near 22.5 deg 2theta, suggesting both samples contain trioctahedral 2:1 phyllosilicates [1]. However, the positions of the (001) peaks differ: the phyllosilicate at John Klein has its (001) peak at 10 Angstroms, whereas the phyllosilicate at Cumberland has an (001) peak at 14 Angstroms. Such differences in (001) dspacings can be ascribed to the type of cation in the interlayer site [3]. For example, large monovalent cations (e.g., K(+)) have low hydration energies and readily lose their H2O of hydration, whereas small divalent cations (e.g., Mg(2+)) have high energies of hydration and retain H2O in the phyllosilicate interlayers [3,4]. The goal of this study is to determine whether differences in the interlayer cation composition can explain the CheMin data from John Klein and Cumberland and to use this knowledge to better understand phyllosilicate formation mechanisms.\n\nMaterials challenges for repeatable RF wireless device reconfiguration with microfluidic channels\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGriffin, Anthony S.; Sottos, Nancy R.; White, Scott R.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nRecently, adaptive wireless devices have utilized displacement of EGaIn within microchannels as an electrical switching mechanism to enable reconfigurable electronics. Device reconfiguration using EGaIn in microchannels overcomes many challenges encountered by more traditional reconfiguration mechanisms such as diodes and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Reconfiguration using EGaIn is severely limited by undesired permanent shorting due to retention of the liquid in microchannels caused by wetting and rapid oxide skin formation. Here, we investigate the conditions which prevent repeatable electrical switching using EGaIn in microchannels. Initial contact angle tests of EGaIn on epoxy surfaces demonstrate the wettability of EGaIn on flat surfaces. SEM cross-sections of microchannels reveal adhesion of EGaIn residue to channel walls. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) scans of provide volumetric measurements of EGaIn remaining inside channels after flow cycling. Non-wetting coatings are proposed as materials based strategy to overcome these issues in future work.\n\nEspacialidade e temporalidades das vilas e cidade amazÃ´nicas: da vila de Ega Ã cidade de TefÃ© nas Cartas dos Governadores da ProvÃ­ncia do Amazonas, 1852-1857.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSandriele Pessoa dos Santos\n\n2017-05-01\n\nFull Text Available In order to understand the emergence and permanence of the Amazonian cities in the area corresponding to the present state of Amazonas, it was necessary to describe the political and economic facts that led to the disappearance of towns and villages or their spatialisation. The methodology is based on the investigative and descriptive analysis of primary documents. It seeks to reconstruct Tefe's geo-history and its spatiality from Vila to the city. The results show that in the mid-nineteenth century the events related to the elevation of the Amazon to the Province in 1850, the creation of the Comarca of SolimÃµes in 1853 with headquarters in Ega, the introduction of steam navigation and the installation of new institutions to house the apparatus Legal-administrative, transplanted of the Capital.

Some EGAEs demonstrate gonadotoxic, embriotoxic, fetotoxic and teratogenic effects in both humans and experimental animals. Due to the noxious impact of these ethers on reproduction and development of organisms EGAEs are replaced for considerably less toxic PGAEs. The data on the mechanisms of testicular, embriotoxic, fetotoxic and teratogenic effects of EGAEs are presented in this paper.

Dental records of 1886 patients were viewed in this retrospective study 129 patients treated with one of these three functional appliances were identified. 123 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and data were extracted from the dental records. Gender, age, compliance, overjet change at every visit, number of appliance breakages and number of emergency visits apart from appliance breakage were studied. The data were analyzed with Chi-square test, General Linear Model and Fisher scoring test. Results showed that 47 patients were treated with EGA, 38 patients with TBA and 38 patients with A-HG. Mean ages starting the treatment were slightly lower with EGA (11.5 years) than with TBA (12.3 years) and A-HG (11.8 years). Non-compliance was higher in the EGA group (31.9%) than TBA group (26.3%) and A-HG group (23.7%). Mean overjet reduction per month was 0.6 mm for EGA which was lower than TBA group (0.7 mm) and A-HG groups (0.7 mm).The number of emergency visits and appliance breakage were lower in EGA group. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the 3 groups regarding ages,compliance, mean overjet reduction, emergency visits and appliance breakage aspects. In conclusion, this study indicates that EGA is an alternative choice in the treatment of adolescent patients with class II division 1 malocclusion. However, long-term follow-up and cephalometric prospective study should be performed to continue our understanding more about the mechanisms of EGA and more definite conclusions can be made.\n\nVoltammetric Determination of Anti-Hypertensive Drug Hydrochlorothiazide Using Screen-Printed Electrodes Modified with L-Glutamic Acid\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCamilo GonzÃ¡lez-Vargas\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFull Text Available This work deals with the development of screen-printed carbon electrodes modified with L-glutamic acid via two different approaches: electropolymerization (SPCE/PGA and aryl diazonium electrochemical grafting (SPCE/EGA. SPCE/PGA and SPCE/EGA were analytically compared in the determination of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ by differential pulse voltammetry. Both electrochemical characterization and analytical performance indicate that SPCE/EGA is a much better sensor for HCTZ. The detection and quantification limits were at the level of Î¼mol Lâ1 with a very good linearity in the studied concentration range. In addition, the proposed SPCE/EGA was successfully applied for the determination of HCTZ in an anti-hypertensive drug with high reproducibility and good trueness.\n\nVacuum-free processed bulk heterojunction solar cells with E-GaIn cathode as an alternative to Al electrode\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOngul, Fatih; Yuksel, Sureyya AydÄ±n; Bozar, Sinem; Gunes, Serap; Cakmak, Gulbeden; Guney, Hasan Yuksel; Egbe, Daniel Ayuk Mbi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this paper, the photovoltaic characteristics of bulk heterojunction solar cells employing an eutectic galliumâindium (EGaIn) alloy as a top metal contact which was coated by a simple and inexpensive brush-painting was investigated. The overall solar cell fabrication procedure was vacuum-free. As references, regular organic bulk heterojunction solar cells employing thermally evaporated Aluminum as a top metal contact were also fabricated. Inserting the ZnO layer between the active layer and the cathode electrodes (Al and EGaIn) improved the photovoltaic performance of the herein investigated devices. The power conversion efficiencies with and without EGaIn top electrodes were rather comparable. Hence, we have shown that the EGaIn, which is liquid at room temperature, can be used as a cathode. It allows an easy and rapid device fabrication that can be implemented through a vacuum free process.

An End Grain Attack (EGA) as a kind of pit mechanism was conducted on the pipe surface. The early stage of the EGA may come from under-deposit of caustic-water formation compositions like Na+, K+, Ca+, and Mg+ etc. The under-deposit corrosion is caused by the corrosion layer on the pipe surface followed by crevice corrosion due to accumulation of Clâ or Sâ composition between the corrosion layer and the pipe surface. In the early stage, the EGA occurred in all grain boundaries beneath the under-deposit corrosion. In the later stage of EGA, almost all the early attacked grain boundaries stopped at a limited depth of about 10 Âµm. Meanwhile, only the smallest number of the attacked boundaries progressed into the pipe as pit corrosion and resulted in leak failure.\n\nSeroprevalence of equine granulocytic anaplasmosis and lyme borreliosis in Canada as determined by a point-of-care enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchvartz, Gili; Epp, Tasha; Burgess, Hilary J; Chilton, Neil B; Pearl, David L; Lohmann, Katharina L\n\n2015-06-01\n\nEquine granulocytic anaplasmosis (EGA) and Lyme borreliosis (LB) are an emerging concern in Canada. We estimated the seroprevalence of EGA and equine LB by testing 376 convenience serum samples from 3 provinces using a point-of-care SNAP(Â®) 4Dx(Â®) ELISA (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine, USA), and investigated the agreement between the point-of-care ELISA and laboratory-based serologic tests. The estimated seroprevalence for EGA was 0.53% overall (0.49% in Saskatchewan, 0.71% in Manitoba), while the estimated seroprevalence for LB was 1.6% overall (0.49% in Saskatchewan, 2.86% in Manitoba). There was limited agreement between the point-of-care ELISA and an indirect fluorescent antibody test for EGA (kappa 0.1, PABAK 0.47) and an ELISA/Western blot combination for LB (kappa 0.23, PABAK 0.71). While the SNAP(Â®) 4Dx(Â®) ELISA yielded expected seroprevalence estimates, further evaluation of serologic tests for the purposes of disease exposure recognition may be needed.\n\nConversando con Oriol Bohigas\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nRedondo DomÃ­nguez, Ernesto; Moya Sala, Joaquim\n\n2015-01-01\n\n[EN] Interview with Oriol Bohigas [ES] Entrevista con Oriol Bohigas Redondo DomÃ­nguez, E.; Moya Sala, J.

Introducing a series of Lewis acidic/basic functional groups (T = -OH, -SH, -CO2H, -CONH2, and -PO3H) at the terminus of the SAM gave values for the tunneling current density, J(V) in A/cm(2), that were indistinguishable (i.e., differed by less than a factor of 3) from the values observed with n-alkanethiolates of equivalent length. The insensitivity of the rate of tunneling to changes in the terminal functional group implies that replacing weak van der Waals contact interactions with stronger hydrogen- or ionic bonds at the T//Ga2O3 interface does not change the shape (i.e., the height or width) of the tunneling barrier enough to affect rates of charge transport. A comparison of the injection current, J0, for T = -CO2H, and T = -CH2CH3--two groups having similar extended lengths (in Ã , or in numbers of non-hydrogen atoms)--suggests that both groups make indistinguishable contributions to the height of the tunneling barrier.\n\nMidtvejsevaluering af EGA handlingsplanen\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nMÃ¸ller, Niels; Hasle, Peter; Christiansen, JÃ¸rgen MÃ¸ller\n\nCenter for Alternativ Samfundsanalyse (CASA) og Institut for Teknologi og Samfund ved Danmarks Tekniske Universitet har gennemfÃ¸rt denne midtvejsevaluering af arbejdsmarkedets parters handlingsplan mod reduktion af ensidigt gentaget arbejde.

S.; Sanderman, J.; Baldock, J.; Plante, A. F.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nNational-scale inventories typically include soil organic carbon (SOC) content, but not chemical composition or biogeochemical stability. Australia's Soil Carbon Research Programme (SCaRP) represents a national inventory of SOC content and composition in agricultural systems. The program used physical fractionation followed by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. While these techniques are highly effective, they are typically too expensive and time consuming for use in large-scale SOC monitoring. We seek to understand if analytical thermal analysis is a viable alternative. Coupled differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and evolved gas analysis (CO2- and H2O-EGA) yields valuable data on SOC composition and stability via ramped combustion. The technique requires little training to use, and does not require fractionation or other sample pre-treatment. We analyzed 300 agricultural samples collected by SCaRP, divided into four fractions: whole soil, coarse particulates (POM), untreated mineral associated (HUM), and hydrofluoric acid (HF)-treated HUM. All samples were analyzed by DSC-EGA, but only the POM and HF-HUM fractions were analyzed by NMR. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to explore natural clustering in SOC composition and stability based on DSC-EGA data. A partial least-squares regression (PLSR) model was used to explore correlations among the NMR and DSC-EGA data. Correlations demonstrated regions of combustion attributable to specific functional groups, which may relate to SOC stability. We are increasingly challenged with developing an efficient technique to assess SOC composition and stability at large spatial and temporal scales. Correlations between NMR and DSC-EGA may demonstrate the viability of using thermal analysis in lieu of more demanding methods in future large-scale surveys, and may provide data that goes beyond chemical composition to better approach quantification of biogeochemical stability.\n\nOperative link on gastritis assessment stage is an appropriate predictor of early gastric cancer.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhou, Ying; Li, Hai-Yan; Zhang, Jing-Jing; Chen, Xiao-Yu; Ge, Zhi-Zheng; Li, Xiao-Bo\n\n2016-04-07\n\nTo assess the predictive value of Operative Link on Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) and Operative Link on Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia Assessment (OLGIM) stages in gastric cancer. A prospective study was conducted with 71 patients with early gastric cancer (EGC) and 156 patients with non-EGC. All patients underwent endoscopic examination and systematic biopsy. Outcome measures were assessed and compared, including the Japanese endoscopic gastric atrophy (EGA) classification method and the modified OLGA method as well as the modified OLGIM method. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) status was determined for all study participants. Stepwise logistic regression modeling was performed to analyze correlations between EGC and the EGA, OLGA and OLGIM methods. For patients with EGC and patients with non-EGC, the proportions of moderate-to-severe EGA cases were 64.8% and 44.9%, respectively (P = 0.005), the proportions of OLGA stages III-IV cases were 52.1% and 22.4%, respectively (P cancer.\n\nThe Impact of Early Substance Use Disorder Treatment Response on Treatment Outcomes Among Pregnant Women With Primary Opioid Use.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTuten, Michelle; Fitzsimons, Heather; Hochheimer, Martin; Jones, Hendree E; Chisolm, Margaret S\n\n2018-03-13\n\nThis study examined the impact of early patient response on treatment utilization and substance use among pregnant participants enrolled in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Treatment responders (TRs) and treatment nonresponders (TNRs) were compared on pretreatment and treatment measures. Regression models predicted treatment utilization and substance use. TR participants attended more treatment and had lower rates of substance use relative to TNR participants. Regression models for treatment utilization and substance use were significant. Maternal estimated gestational age (EGA) and baseline cocaine use were negatively associated with treatment attendance. Medication-assisted treatment, early treatment response, and baseline SUD treatment were positively associated with treatment attendance. Maternal EGA was negatively associated with counseling attendance; early treatment response was positively associated with counseling attendance. Predictors of any substance use at 1 month were maternal education, EGA, early treatment nonresponse, and baseline cocaine use. The single predictor of any substance use at 2 months was early treatment nonresponse. Predictors of opioid use at 1 month were maternal education, EGA, early treatment nonresponse, and baseline SUD treatment. Predictors of opioid use at 2 months were early treatment nonresponse, and baseline cocaine and marijuana use. Predictors of cocaine use at 1 month were early treatment nonresponse, baseline cocaine use, and baseline SUD treatment. Predictors of cocaine use at 2 months were early treatment nonresponse and baseline cocaine use. Early treatment response predicts more favorable maternal treatment utilization and substance use outcomes. Treatment providers should implement interventions to maximize patient early response to treatment.\n\nTechnical factors that affect anastomotic integrity following esophagectomy: systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMarkar, Sheraz R; Arya, Shobhit; Karthikesalingam, Alan; Hanna, George B\n\n2013-12-01\n\nDue to the significant contribution of anastomotic leak, with its disastrous consequences to patient morbidity and mortality, multiple parameters have been proposed and individually meta-analyzed for the formation of the ideal esophagogastric anastomosis following cancer resection. The purpose of this pooled analysis was to examine the main technical parameters that impact on anastomotic integrity. Medline, Embase, trial registries, and conference proceedings were searched. Technical factors evaluated included hand-sewn versus stapled esophagogastric anastomosis (EGA), cervical versus thoracic EGA, minimally invasive versus open esophagectomy, anterior versus posterior route of reconstruction and ischemic conditioning of the gastric conduit. The outcome of interest was the incidence of anastomotic leak, for which pooled odds ratios were calculated for each technical factor. No significant difference in the incidence of anastomotic leak was demonstrated for the following technical factors: hand-sewn versus stapled EGA, minimally invasive versus open esophagectomy, anterior versus posterior route of reconstruction and ischemic conditioning of the gastric conduit. Four randomized, controlled trials comprising 298 patients were included that compared cervical and thoracic EGA. Anastomotic leak was seen more commonly in the cervical group (13.64 %) than in the thoracic group (2.96 %). Pooled analysis demonstrated a significantly increased incidence of anastomotic leak in the cervical group (pooled odds ratio = 4.73; 95 % CI 1.61-13.9; P = 0.005). A tailored surgical approach to the patient's physiology and esophageal cancer stage is the most important factor that influences anastomotic integrity after esophagectomy.\n\nEvaluating the clinical accuracy of two continuous glucose sensors using continuous glucose-error grid analysis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nClarke, William L; Anderson, Stacey; Farhy, Leon; Breton, Marc; Gonder-Frederick, Linda; Cox, Daniel; Kovatchev, Boris\n\n2005-10-01\n\nTo compare the clinical accuracy of two different continuous glucose sensors (CGS) during euglycemia and hypoglycemia using continuous glucose-error grid analysis (CG-EGA). FreeStyle Navigator (Abbott Laboratories, Alameda, CA) and MiniMed CGMS (Medtronic, Northridge, CA) CGSs were applied to the abdomens of 16 type 1 diabetic subjects (age 42 +/- 3 years) 12 h before the initiation of the study. Each system was calibrated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Each subject underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (blood glucose goal 110 mg/dl) for 70-210 min followed by a 1-mg.dl(-1).min(-1) controlled reduction in blood glucose toward a nadir of 40 mg/dl. Arterialized blood glucose was determined every 5 min using a Beckman Glucose Analyzer (Fullerton, CA). CGS glucose recordings were matched to the reference blood glucose with 30-s precision, and rates of glucose change were calculated for 5-min intervals. CG-EGA was used to quantify the clinical accuracy of both systems by estimating combined point and rate accuracy of each system in the euglycemic (70-180 mg/dl) and hypoglycemic (<70 mg/dl) ranges. A total of 1,104 data pairs were recorded in the euglycemic range and 250 data pairs in the hypoglycemic range. Overall correlation between CGS and reference glucose was similar for both systems (Navigator, r = 0.84; CGMS, r = 0.79, NS). During euglycemia, both CGS systems had similar clinical accuracy (Navigator zones A + B, 88.8%; CGMS zones A + B, 89.3%, NS). However, during hypoglycemia, the Navigator was significantly more clinically accurate than the CGMS (zones A + B = 82.4 vs. 61.6%, Navigator and CGMS, respectively, P < 0.0005). CG-EGA is a helpful tool for evaluating and comparing the clinical accuracy of CGS systems in different blood glucose ranges. CG-EGA provides accuracy details beyond other methods of evaluation, including correlational analysis and the original EGA.\n\nHighly stretchable and conductive fibers enabled by liquid metal dip-coating\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhang, Qiang; Roach, Devin J.; Geng, Luchao; Chen, Haosen; Qi, H. Jerry; Fang, Daining\n\n2018-03-01\n\nHighly stretchable and conductive fibers have been fabricated by dip-coating of a layer of liquid metal (eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn) on printed silicone elastomer filaments. This fabrication method exploits a nanolayer of oxide skin that rapidly forms on the surface of EGaIn when exposed to air. Through dip-coating, the sticky nature of the oxide skin leads to the formation of a thin EGaIn coating (Ë5 Î¼m thick) on the originally nonconductive filaments and renders these fibers excellent conductivity. Electrical characterization shows that the fiber resistance increases moderately as the fiber elongates but always maintains conductivity even when stretched by 800%. Besides this, these fibers possess good cyclic electrical stability with little degradation after hundreds of stretching cycles, which makes them an excellent candidate for stretchable conductors. We then demonstrate a highly stretchable LED circuit as well as a conductive stretchable net that extends the 1D fibers into a 2D configuration. These examples demonstrate potential applications for topologically complex stretchable electronics.\n\nBrote de faringo-amigdalÃ­tis por estreptococo ?-hemolÃ­tico grupo A\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDante R Culqui\n\n2014-04-01\n\nFull Text Available El objetivo fue describir un brote de faringo-amigdalitis causado por estreptococos Î²-hemolÃ­ticos del grupo A (EGA en profesionales de la salud.

However, LM-microelectronics integration is currently limited by challenges in rapid fabrication of LM circuits and the creation of vias between circuit terminals and the I/O pins of packaged electronics. In this study, we address both with a unique layup for soft-matter electronics in which traces of liquid-phase Ga-In eutectic (EGaIn) are patterned with UV laser micromachining (UVLM). The terminals of the elastomer-sealed LM circuit connect to the surface mounted chips through vertically aligned columns of EGaIn-coated Ag-Fe 2 O 3 microparticles that are embedded within an interfacial elastomer layer. The processing technique is compatible with conventional UVLM printed circuit board (PCB) prototyping and exploits the photophysical ablation of EGaIn on an elastomer substrate. Potential applications to wearable computing and biosensing are demonstrated with functional implementations in which soft-matter PCBs are populated with surface-mounted microelectronics.\n\nProduction of Liquid Metal Spheres by Molding\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMohammed G. Mohammed\n\n2014-10-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper demonstrates a molding technique for producing spheres composed of eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn with diameters ranging from hundreds of microns to a couple millimeters. The technique starts by spreading EGaIn across an elastomeric sheet featuring cylindrical reservoirs defined by replica molding. The metal flows into these features during spreading. The spontaneous formation of a thin oxide layer on the liquid metal keeps the metal flush inside these reservoirs. Subsequent exposure to acid removes the oxide and causes the metal to bead up into a sphere with a size dictated by the volume of the reservoirs. This technique allows for the production and patterning of droplets with a wide range of volumes, from tens of nanoliters up to a few microliters. EGaIn spheres can be embedded or encased subsequently in polymer matrices using this technique.

The ease of parallel-processing and the ability to control the location of the droplets during their formation distinguishes this technique.\n\nFormation of nucleoli in interspecies nuclear transfer embryos derived from bovine, porcine, and rabbit oocytes and nuclear donor cells of various species.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLagutina, Irina; Zakhartchenko, Valeri; Fulka, Helena; Colleoni, Silvia; Wolf, Eckhard; Fulka, Josef; Lazzari, Giovanna; Galli, Cesare\n\n2011-04-01\n\nThe most successful development of interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) embryos has been achieved in closely related species. The analyses of embryonic gene activity in iSCNT embryos of different species combinations have revealed the existence of significant aberrations in expression of housekeeping genes and genes dependent on the major embryonic genome activation (EGA). However, there are many studies with successful blastocyst (BL) development of iSCNT embryos derived from donor cells and oocytes of animal species with distant taxonomical relations (inter-family/inter-class) that should indicate proper EGA at least in terms of RNA polymerase I activation, nucleoli formation, and activation of genes engaged in morula and BL formation. We investigated the ability of bovine, porcine, and rabbit oocytes to activate embryonic nucleoli formation in the nuclei of somatic cells of different mammalian species. In iSCNT embryos, nucleoli precursor bodies originate from the oocyte, while most proteins engaged in the formation of mature nucleoli should be transcribed from genes de novo in the donor nucleus at the time of EGA. Thus, the success of nucleoli formation depends on species compatibility of many components of this complex process. We demonstrate that the time and cell stage of nucleoli formation are under the control of recipient ooplasm. Oocytes of the studied species possess different abilities to support nucleoli formation. Formation of nucleoli, which is a complex but small part of the whole process of EGA, is essential but not absolutely sufficient for the development of iSCNT embryos to the morula and BL stages.\n\nEstudo sobre a perceÃ§Ã£o individual de adolescentes no uso de aparatologia funcional removÃ­vel e a sua predisposiÃ§Ã£o no sucesso do tratamento ortodÃ´ntico\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nFigueira, Maria Margarida GÃ³is\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDissertaÃ§Ã£o para obtenÃ§Ã£o do grau de Mestre no Instituto Superior de CiÃªncias da SaÃºde Egas Moniz IntroduÃ§Ã£o: Esta investigaÃ§Ã£o pretende explorar, estudar e descrever a perceÃ§Ã£o individual e adaptativa, relativamente ao tratamento com aparelhos funcionais removÃ­veis, da populaÃ§Ã£o jovem a ser seguida na consulta assistencial de Ortodontia da ClÃ­nica UniversitÃ¡ria Egas Moniz, percebendo-se um envolvimento positivo dos pacientes predispÃµe ao sucesso do seu tratamento.

Few reports have been published on treatment effects with the EGA but no randomized studies have been available. The aim was to find out if 1 year active treatment time with EGA was sufficient for achieving normal occlusal relationships and dental alignment in 7- to 8-year-old children. Eligibility criteria for participants were: fully erupted upper central incisors, and Angle's Class I or Class II molar relationship combined with any of the following traits: deep bite, increased overjet â¥5mm, moderate anterior crowding with overjet â¥4mm. After screening of 148 children, 48 7- to 8-year-old children were recruited in the study. The participants were randomly assigned into a treatment group (N = 25) and a control group (N = 23). Children in the treatment group received treatment with the EGA for 1 year. The controls had no orthodontic treatment. Changes in overjet, overbite, Angle's Class, and crowding were used as primary outcome measures. Occlusal assessments were performed on dental casts obtained from all subjects at start of the study (T1) and after 1 year (T2). Lateral cephalograms were obtained from all subjects at T1 and from the treatment group at T2. All measurements on dental casts and cephalograms were carried out blinded. Forty-six children completed the study. Mean overjet and overbite decreased significantly in the treated subjects during 1 year, in contrast to a slight increase in the controls. Class II molar relationship decreased from 46 to 4 per cent in the treatment group, with no significant change in the control group. Mandibular anterior crowding decreased significantly in the treated subjects, while the controls showed a slight increase. In short term, the EGA seems to be effective in correcting increased overjet and overbite, Class II malocclusion, and lower anterior crowding in the early mixed\n\nSurvey of bat populations from Mexico and Paraguay for rabies.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSheeler-Gordon, L L; Smith, J S\n\n2001-07-01\n\nA mammalian survey was conducted in Mexico (October 1994-January 1996) and in Paraguay (August 1996-March 1997); a complete specimen was collected for each bat in the survey, including primary voucher specimen, ectoparasites, karyotype, and various frozen tissues. The surveys combined provided 937 brain samples (65 bat species) for rabies diagnosis. One male Lasiurus ega, collected in Paraguay, tested positive for the rabies virus (overall prevalence rate of 0.1%). Nucleotide sequence from a 300 bp region of the rabies nucleoprotein gene was compared with sequence obtained from representative rabies virus samples in the repository at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia, USA). Rabies virus extracted from the brain material of L. ega differed by only one nucleotide from a 300 bp consensus sequence (>99% homology) derived from samples for the variant of rabies virus transmitted by Lasiurus cinereus. Lasiurus ego differed by approximately 15% for the variant transmitted by Desmodus rotundus. Phylogenetic analysis found no evidence to suggest L. ego is a reservoir for rabies antigenic variant 6. The most likely explanation for rabies in L. ega was infection following contact with a rabid L. cinereus.\n\nExploratory graph analysis: A new approach for estimating the number of dimensions in psychological research.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGolino, Hudson F; Epskamp, Sacha\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe estimation of the correct number of dimensions is a long-standing problem in psychometrics. Several methods have been proposed, such as parallel analysis (PA), Kaiser-Guttman's eigenvalue-greater-than-one rule, multiple average partial procedure (MAP), the maximum-likelihood approaches that use fit indexes as BIC and EBIC and the less used and studied approach called very simple structure (VSS). In the present paper a new approach to estimate the number of dimensions will be introduced and compared via simulation to the traditional techniques pointed above. The approach proposed in the current paper is called exploratory graph analysis (EGA), since it is based on the graphical lasso with the regularization parameter specified using EBIC. The number of dimensions is verified using the walktrap, a random walk algorithm used to identify communities in networks. In total, 32,000 data sets were simulated to fit known factor structures, with the data sets varying across different criteria: number of factors (2 and 4), number of items (5 and 10), sample size (100, 500, 1000 and 5000) and correlation between factors (orthogonal, .20, .50 and .70), resulting in 64 different conditions. For each condition, 500 data sets were simulated using lavaan. The result shows that the EGA performs comparable to parallel analysis, EBIC, eBIC and to Kaiser-Guttman rule in a number of situations, especially when the number of factors was two. However, EGA was the only technique able to correctly estimate the number of dimensions in the four-factor structure when the correlation between factors were .7, showing an accuracy of 100% for a sample size of 5,000 observations. Finally, the EGA was used to estimate the number of factors in a real dataset, in order to compare its performance with the other six techniques tested in the simulation study.\n\nRepsil on aeg hakata haridusega tegelema / Piret Pert\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nPert, Piret\n\n2006-01-01\n\nSotsiaaldemokraatide hinnangul ei valda haridus- ja teadusminister Mailis Reps hariduseelnÃµude sisu, keeldub arutamast kÃµiki opositsiooni eelnÃµusid ega ilmu Riigikogu kultuurikomisjoni eelnÃµude arutamisele\n\nNomos versus logos / Hent Kalmo\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nVipp, Kaupo\n\n2010-01-01\n\nNaftatipust ja ohejeldamatule tarbimisele jÃ¤rgnevast energiakriisist.

This electrode has, however, one feature whose effect on charge transport has been incompletely understood: a thin (approximately 0.7 nm) film-consisting primarily of Ga(2)O(3)-that covers its surface when in contact with air. SAMs that rectify current have been measured using this electrode in Ag(TS)-SAM//Ga(2)O(3)/EGaIn (where Ag(TS) = template-stripped Ag surface) junctions. This paper organizes evidence, both published and unpublished, showing that the molecular structure of the SAM (specifically, the presence of an accessible molecular orbital asymmetrically located within the SAM), not the difference between the electrodes or the characteristics of the Ga(2)O(3) film, causes the observed rectification. By examining and ruling out potential mechanisms of rectification that rely either on the Ga(2)O(3) film or on the asymmetry of the electrodes, this paper demonstrates that the structure of the SAM dominates charge transport through Ag(TS)-SAM//Ga(2)O(3)/EGaIn junctions, and that the electrical characteristics of the Ga(2)O(3) film have a negligible effect on these measurements.\n\nVÃ¤ljaspool Euroopa NÃµukogu riikide piire toimuv relvakonflikt: riigi jurisdiktsioon ja rahvusvahelise humanitaarÃµiguse kohaldamine.
