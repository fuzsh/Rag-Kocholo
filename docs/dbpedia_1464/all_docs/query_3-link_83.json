        "text": "Most tournaments\n\nThree - by fifteen players...\n\nBilly Wright and Tom Finney played in the 1950, 1954 and 1958 tournaments. Bobby Charlton and Bobby Moore appeared in the 1962, 1966 and 1970 tournaments. Peter Shilton, Terry Butcher and Bryan Robson played in the 1982, 1986 and 1990 tournaments. David Beckham and Sol Campbell appeared in the 1998, 2002 and 2006 tournaments. Ashley Cole and Joe Cole both appeared in the 2002, 2006 and 2010 tournaments. Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney both played in the 2006, 2010 and 2014 tournaments. Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling both played in the 2014, 2018 and 2022 tournaments\n\nBobby Charlton, Rio Ferdinand and Steven Gerrard are the only players named to four England World Cup squads, but they did not play on their first occasions, the 1958, 1998 and 2002 tournaments respectively. Ferdinand was named to the 2010 Finals squad, but withdrew following an injury.\n\nMost appearances\n\nPeter Shilton holds the record with seventeen appearances.\n\nMost appearances in a single tournament\n\nIn Italy in 1990, four players appeared in all seven matches: Peter Shilton, Des Walker, Gary Lineker and Chris Waddle. However, only Shilton and Walker played every minute of every match, 720 minutes in all, a number inflated by England's three extra-time matches. Lineker missed the last seven minutes of the first match, and Waddle, coming on as a substitute, missed 72 minutes of the last, third-place match.\n\nIn Russia in 2018, both Harry Kane and Jordan Pickford appeared in all seven matches, but only Pickford played every minute of every match.\n\nMost consecutive appearances\n\nPeter Shilton made his seventeen consecutive appearances as goalkeeper in all England's matches at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 final tournaments.\n\nMost tournaments as captain\n\nBilly Wright served as captain at three World Cup final tournaments, 1950 in Brazil, 1954 in Switzerland and 1958 in Sweden.\n\nMost appearances as captain\n\nHarry Kane served as a captain in 11 World Cup final tournament matches in 2018 and 2022.\n\nBilly Wright, Bobby Moore and David Beckham each served as captain in 10 World Cup final tournament matches, Wright at the 1950, 1954 and 1958 tournaments, Moore at the 1966 and 1970 tournaments and Beckham at the 2002 and 2006 tournaments.\n\nYoungest player to appear\n\nMichael Owen was by far the youngest player ever to appear for England in the World Cup finals. He was 18 years, 183 days when he made a substitute appearance for England against Tunisia in the opening group match of the 1998 tournament in France. In the third group match, against Colombia, at the time, he became the youngest player to make a starting appearance for England at 18 years, 194 days.\n\nOldest player to appear\n\nPeter Shilton was 40 years, 295 days when he played in the third-place match against host Italy at the 1990 tournament to earn his 125th and last cap for England.\n\nMost goals\n\nGary Lineker is England's top World Cup finals scorer with 10 goals in 12 matches, six in five matches at the 1986 tournament in Mexico and four in seven matches at the 1990 tournament in Italy.\n\nMost goals in a match\n\nGeoff Hurst is the only player to score three in a World Cup Final match, England's 4-2 extra-time victory against West Germany on 30 July 1966. Two of his goals came in extra time, and one of those is highly controversial because of the dispute over whether it actually crossed the line.\n\nGary Lineker was the first England player to score three goals in regulation time in a World Cup match, the 3-0 group stage victory against Poland on 11 June 1986. Lineker actually accomplished the feat in less than regulation time since he was taken off for a substitute at 84 minutes.\n\nHarry Kane, the second, was taken off after 63 minutes after he had scored three goals in a 6-1 victorious World Cup match against Panama on 24 June 2018.\n\nMost goals in a single tournament\n\nGary Lineker set the England record with six goals in five matches at the 1986 tournament in Mexico, when he was the tournament's top scorer.\n\nHarry Kane, also scored six goals in his six matches in the 2018 tournament in Russia, when he was also awarded the Golden Boot.\n\nMost consecutive games with goals\n\nGary Lineker scored in four consecutive World Cup finals matches, England's last three at the 1986 tournament in Mexico against Poland, Paraguay and Argentina and their first at the 1990 tournament in Italy against the Republic of Ireland.\n\nMost tournaments scored in\n\nDavid Beckham is the only player to score in three tournaments, in the 1998, 2002 and 2006 tournaments.\n\nFastest goal\n\nBryan Robson scored after 27 seconds against France on 16 June 1982 in the opening match of the preliminary group phase of the World Cup final tournament in Spain.\n\nYoungest player to score\n\nMichael Owen was by far the youngest England player to score at the World Cup finals when he came on as a substitute and temporarily brought England level with Romania in the second group match at the 1998 tournament in France.

He was 21 years and 77 days.\n\nOldest player to score\n\nTom Finney became the oldest player to score for England in World Cup finals play when he put home a penalty kick against the USSR in the opening match at the 1958 tournament in Sweden. He was 36 years, 64 days. Finney was also the oldest to score from open play, scoring in the quarter-final against Uruguay at the 1954 tournament in Switzerland when he was 32 years, 82 days, until...\n\nJordan Henderson, against Senegal on 4 December 2022, he was 32 years and 170 days, when he scored to become the oldest to do so from open play.\n\nMost expulsions\n\nThree separate players - Ray Wilkins was shown the red card for incurring two cautions in one match against Morocco at World Cup 1986 in Mexico, David Beckham for violent conduct against Argentina at World Cup 1998 in France and Wayne Rooney for an alleged stamp against Portugal at World Cup 2006 in Germany.\n\nMost cautions\n\nThree cautions - Ray Wilkins incurred his first against Spain at World Cup 1982 and two more against Morocco at World Cup 1986, which earned him a red card and suspension from the following two matches. Terry Fenwick was also given three cautions in three separate matches at World Cup 1986, the first against Portugal, the second, against Poland, which brought him a one-match suspension, and the third against Argentina in England's last match of the tournament.\n\nMost cautions in a single tournament\n\nTerry Fenwick's three cautions at the 1986 tournament, drawn in the matches against Portugal, Poland and Argentina, remain the record.\n\nMost tournaments\n\nSteven Gerrard first played in three tournaments, 2000, 2004 and 2012. Then Wayne Rooney joined him when he appeared in his third tournament in 2016, following his appearances in 2004 and 2012. In 2021, Jordan Henderson appeared in his third tournament, following his appearances in 2021 and 2016, and then Harry Kane and Kyle Walker played in their third tournament in 2024, after appearing in 2016 and 2021.\n\nMost appearances\n\nHarry Kane has played in eighteen matches..
