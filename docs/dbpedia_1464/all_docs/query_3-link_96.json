        "text": "England U17s got their Nordic Tournament off to a near-perfect start with an emphatic 5-1 victory over Iceland.\n\nTwo goals apiece from Marcus Edwards and Admiral Muskwe - and another from Yan Dhanda - capped a ruthless display by the Young Lions in Denmark.\n\nDespite the goalfest that was to follow, it was a frustrating opening for Micciche’s youngsters. Sloppy passing prevented them from mounting an attack – and against a robust attacking threesome they had to be wary of the threat posed from the Icelandic frontline.\n\nThe first chance of the game fell the way of Iceland after eight minutes.\n\nLeft-back Kristofer Konraosson, who had already demonstrated his intention to push forward in the early exchanges, lined-up a free-kick from 30 yards – but his effort was easily collected by goalkeeper and debutant, Taye Ashby-Hammond.\n\nMicciche’s youngsters were looking to force the ball forward, but as the half progressed they seemed to become a lot more relaxed on the ball, and were in the ascendency prior to the water break after 20 minutes.\n\nThe stoppage failed to prevent the momentum, and five minutes after the restart they had the lead thanks to an exquisite finish from Liverpool attacker Yan Dhanda.\n\nA ball from Trent Arnold found Marcus Edwards in the middle. He beat three defenders before finding Dhanda – who cut in and curled a beauty into the top corner from the edge of the area.\n\nDhanda turned provider twelve minutes later – placing a ball over the right-back for Admiral Muskwe to power on to, and beat the goalkeeper from an acute angle with the outside of his foot to give England a two-goal lead at the break.\n\nDespite their second group match against Finland kicking-off just 24 hours after the first, no changes were made at the break as England began the half in ruthless fashion.\n\nFour minutes later they had a third courtesy of Tottenham Hotspur forward Marcus Edwards, who met a long ball and controlled perfectly before finishing right-footed.\n\nDhanda was denied his second moments later thanks to a great save from Gretarsson before Muskwe fired just wide – but a fourth duly arrived courtesy of Edwards who sealed his brace in emphatic style.\n\nWith 49 minutes on the clock, Dhanda cut down the left and played it to the feet of Edwards, and he produced a fantastic strike from just inside the area to grab his second from 14 yards.\n\nEngland were not finished yet, though, and within five minutes of the fourth they had a fifth.\n\nThis time it was Muskwe who grabbed his second – capping an impressive performance for the Leicester City hotshot.\n\nAs both sides began to make a raft of changes with the next game in mind, and the sun beaming down, the game began to lose some of its tempo.\n\nAlthough there was time for another goal – albeit a consolation for Iceland as Dagur Hilmarsson headed home from a corner.\n\nA positive start for England, who will head into Tuesday’s game with Finland brimming with confidence.\n\nEngland (4-2-3-1):\n\n1 Taye Ashby-Hammond (Fulham); 2 Trent Arnold (Liverpool), 6 Reece Oxford (West Ham), 18 Edward Francis (Manchester City), 3 Vashon Neufville (West Ham); 4 Herbie Kane (C) (Liverpool), 16 Sadou Diallo (Manchester City); 12 Kyle Edwards (West Brom), 10 Marcus Edwards (Tottenham), 8 Yan Dhanda (Liverpool); 11 Admiral Muskwe (Leicester City).\n\nSubstitutes:\n\n14 Daniel Wright (Sunderland) for Kane (46), 5 Darnell Johnson (Leicester City) for Oxford (46), 18 Callum Slattery (Southampton) for Neufville (46), 15 Todd Cantwell (Norwich City) for M Edwards (62), 7 Lucas N’Mecha (Manchester City) for Dhanda (62), 9 Jonanthan Leko (West Brom) for Francis (68), 13 William Huffer (Leeds United) for Ashby-Hammond (74).\n\nGoals: Dhanda (25), Muskwe (37) (54), M Edwards (44) (49).\n\nBookings: M Edwards (40)\n\nHead Coach: Dan Micciche\n\nIceland (4-3-3):\n\n1 Andri Por Gretarsson; 13 Birkir Valur Jonsson, 14 Mikael Haroarson, 4 Axel Andresson, 3 Kristofer Konraosson; 8 Julius Magnusson (C), 6 Dagur Hilmarsson, 15 Aron Mar Brynjarsson; 17 Erlingur Agnarsson, 7 Jon Dagur Porsteinsson, 9 Mani Hilmarsson.\n\nSubstitutes:\n\n18 Solon Breki Leifsson for Haroarson (40), 16 Horour Ingi Gunnarsson for Agnarsson (40), 11 Sveinn Aron Gudjohnsen for Magnusson (46), 12 Daoi Freyr Arnarson for Por Gretarsson (54), 5 Denis Hoda for Hilmarsson (54), 10 Egir Jarl Jonsson for Konraosson (67), 2 Alfons Samsted for Hilmarsson (80)."
