        "text": "MOSCOW (AP) — The Latest on Friday at the World Cup (all times local):\n\n7:08 p.m.\n\nAhmed Musa has scored in the 49th minute to give Nigeria a 1-0 lead against Iceland at the World Cup.\n\nMusa's half-volley came after a quick Nigeria counter attack which started in its own area.\n\nVictor Moses crossed from the right, and Musa's brilliant first touch saw him kick the ball in the air in front of him. He let it bounce and then lashed it into the net.\n\n___\n\n6:48 p.m.\n\nNigeria and Iceland are locked 0-0 at halftime in a World Cup Group D game in Volgograd.\n\nIceland had its best chance in the last minute after Gylfi Sigurdsson whipped a free kick into the Nigeria penalty box but none of his teammates could stretch out enough to tap the ball into the net.\n\nThe tactical changes from the coaches appear to have cancelled each other out. For Nigeria, captain John Obi Mikel is playing in a more defensive role in midfield, his presence helping to shore up the defense against Iceland's two-man forward line. In the 1-1 draw against Argentina, Iceland played with a lone striker.\n\nWhatever the result, Iceland will still have a chance to progress in the World Cup. Defeat for Nigeria would mean it is eliminated.\n\n___\n\n6:30 p.m.\n\nBrazil coach Tite says he pulled a muscle during his wild celebrations after Philippe Coutinho's late goal in the 2-0 win over Costa Rica.\n\nTite was unintentionally pushed to the ground by substitute goalkeeper Ederson Moraes as the coach ran onto the field from the dugout after the goal in the first minute of injury time.\n\nTite says \"I was going to celebrate with them but I had to limp back.\"\n\n____\n\n6:15 p.m.\n\nEngland defender Kyle Walker has urged the media covering the team not to revel team secrets, after a photographer tweeted an image of the planned lineup for the next match against Panama.\n\nWalker says \"try to keep it to yourself and don't bring it out to the world, because it's not going to help us come the later stages of the tournament.\"\n\nHe adds: \"You guys have to do your little bit. So if you could just please help us with that, it would be polite.\"\n\nLondon's Evening Standard photographer Jeremy Selywn photographed a piece of paper in the hands of assistance coach Steve Holland showing players in formation.\n\nOther journalists defended the right to publish Holland's handwritten notes.\n\n\"Let's just be clear on one thing,\" Matt Law, a football writer for the Daily Telegraph newspaper, posted on Twitter. \"The pic of the England team was taken in an OPEN training session in which photographers and cameramen are invited to take pictures. You may not agree with it being published, but there was certainly no hiding in bushes.\"\n\n___\n\n5:59 p.m.\n\nGermany could be without starting central defender Mats Hummels for Saturday's match against Sweden due to a neck injury suffered in training.\n\nCoach Joachim Loew said Friday that Hummels aggravated a vertebra in his neck during Thursday's training and he would not be practicing Friday. Loew did not say who might replace Hummels in the lineup but said Germany would need to be strong in the air if the 6-foot-2 defender is unavailable.\n\nHummels has anchored of Germany's defense since the 2012 European Championship and scored two goals during their run to the World Cup title in 2014, including the game-winner in the quarterfinals against France.\n\nGermany sits at the bottom of the group with South Korea after losing its opening match 1-0 to Mexico.\n\n___\n\n5:35 p.m.\n\nIceland and Nigeria have made lineup changes for their World Cup match in Volgograd.\n\nHeimir Hallgrimsson has made two changes to his Iceland squad, bringing in Rurik Gislason for the injured Johann Berg Gudmundsson and forward Jon Dadi Bodvarsson to replace midfielder Emil Hallfredsson as the team moves to a 4-4-2 formation from the 4-5-1 used during the 1-1 opening draw against Argentina.\n\nNigeria coach Gernot Rohr has brought in speedy Ahmed Musa and Kelechi Iheanacho to play up front instead of Odion Ighalo and Alex Iwobi. Defender Kenneth Omeruo has replaced Abdullahi Shehu. Nigeria lost its opening match 2-0 to Croatia.\n\nLineups:\n\nNigeria: Francis Uzoho, Bryan Idowu, Wilfred Ndidi, William Ekong, Leon Balogun, Kenneth Omeruo, Oghenekaro Etebo, John Obi Mikel, Victor Moses, Kelechi Iheanacho, Ahmed Musa\n\nIceland: Hannes Halldorsson, Birkir Mar Saevarsson, Ragnar Sigurdsson, Birkir Bjarnason, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Alfred Finnbogason, Kari Arnason, Rurik Gislason, Aron Gunnarsson, Hordur Magnusson, Jon Dadi Bodvarsson\n\n___\n\n4:56 p.m.\n\nPhilippe Coutinho and Neymar have scored in injury time to give Brazil a 2-0 win over Costa Rica at the World Cup.\n\nAfter frustrating the Brazilians for 90 minutes, the Costa Ricans finally conceded twice in stoppage time and slumped to a second loss that ended their chances of advancing to the knockout stage.\n\nCoutinho poked the ball through the legs of goalkeeper Keylor Navas and into the net after Gabriel Jesus controlled the ball in front, for his second goal of the tournament.\n\nNeymar sent his nation's yellow-shirted fans wild when he volleyed the ball in with virtually the last kick of the game.\n\nIt had appeared as if Brazil, after a 1-1 draw with Switzerland in its opening game, was heading for another stalemate.\n\nBrazil attacked relentlessly in the second half and was awarded a penalty in the 78th minute when Neymar was impeded as he cut inside defender Giancarlo Gonzalez.\n\nBut referee Bjorn Kuipers went over to look at the sideline TV monitor, then reversed the decision.\n\nBilled as one of the tournament favorites in Russia, Brazil has four points heading into its last group game against Serbia next Wednesday. Serbia won its opener and was looking to move top of Group E with victory against Switzerland later Friday.\n\n___\n\n4:38 p.m.\n\nReferee Bjorn Kuipers has reversed a decision to award a penalty to Brazil for an apparent foul on Neymar in the 78th minute.\n\nCosta Rica's Giancarlo Gonzalez put his hand across Neymar on the left of the penalty area and the Brazil forward went down. Kuipers pointed the spot.\n\nMoments later, the Dutch referee went over to look at the sideline monitor, then returned to the field and reversed the decision\n\nThe score was 0-0.\n\n___\n\n4:27 p.m.\n\nBeing boring is working well for Belgium coach Roberto Martinez.\n\nAsked why this squad seemed much calmer than at previous tournaments, Martinez says they're avoiding making headlines for off-field issues.\n\nMartinez says: \"We do want to be boring. We're a football team, we're not here to fulfill stories or fill pages.\"\n\nBelgium made a no-fuss start at its World Cup, beating overmatched Panama 3-0 and now plays Tunisia on Saturday in Moscow. England is also in Group G.\n\nMartinez cut out one potential problem by not picking Radja Nainggolan. The Spanish coach had a difficult relationship with the Roma midfielder.\n\n___\n\n4:15 p.m.\n\nA Russian soccer fan who has groped a journalist during a live broadcast in Moscow has offered her an apology .\n\nThe man groped DW reporter Julieth Gonzalez Theran and kissed her on the cheek as she was reporting on the World Cup last week, drawing international attention.\n\nThe German outlet said Friday the man who identified himself by his first name, Ruslan, has visited its office to offer his \"most profound apologies.\" It posted a video of his Skype conversation with Theran, in which he said he made a bet with a friend that he would kiss a reporter on air.\n\nHe said \"I acted carelessly\" and was sorry for \"an unsuccessful joke with a kiss on the cheek turned into sexual harassment.\"\n\nTheran accepted his apologies during their conversation.\n\n___\n\n3:55 p.m.\n\nSweden has arrived in Sochi short-handed for Saturday's match against Germany at the World Cup.\n\nThree players remained in Gelendzhik after becoming ill. Swedish coach Janne Andersson says the expectation is defenders Pontus Jansson and Filip Helander, and midfielder Marcus Rohden will fly to Sochi on Saturday and join the team. Andersson did not indicate whether any of the three will be included in the final 18-man squad.\n\nJannson started in central defense for the Swedes in the opening victory over South Korea. Helander and Rohden were not used.\n\nSweden forward Isaac Kiese Thelin suffered an ankle injury in practice and was not training Friday. Thelin came on as a sub late in the second half of the opener.\n\n___\n\n3:48 p.m.\n\nBrazil and Costa Rica were locked at 0-0 at halftime in their second group game at the World Cup.\n\nThe Brazilians were having problems breaking down Costa Rica's packed defense, with Neymar also getting frustrated at some strong tackling — he was fouled three times in a five-minute span. Neymar was fouled 10 times in Brazil's opening 1-1 draw with Switzerland.\n\nBrazil striker Gabriel Jesus had a goal disallowed for offside, while Costa Rica's best chance saw Celso Borges drag a shot wide following a cut-back.\n\nThe half ended with Neymar, surrounded by his teammates, remonstrating with referee Bjorn Kuipers.\n\nCosta Rica, a World Cup quarterfinalist in 2014, lost 1-0 to Serbia in its opening game.\n\n____\n\n3:43 p.m.\n\nCroatia's players have stoked ethnic tensions by celebrating their 3-0 victory against Argentina by singing a nationalist song that glorifies the Balkan country's wartime struggle against the Serbs.\n\nA brief clip shows defender Dejan Lovren singing the song with other players in the dressing room after Thursday's match. The song by a popular Croatian singer known as Thompson starts with a chant that was used by Croatia's pro-Nazis during World War II. It also mentions chasing Serb \"bandits\" will be chased out of Croatia — a reference to the war between the two former Yugoslav republics in the 1990s.\n\nSerbia's President Aleksandar Vucic says Friday he doesn't understand why the Croatian players would celebrate in such a way.\n\nHe says, \"If I was in their place, I would be happy with the victory. For some people, their hatred for their neighbors is more important.\"\n\nCroatia and Serbia could meet in later rounds at the World Cup.\n\n___\n\n2:40 p.m.\n\nBrazil star Neymar caused a stir with his \"spaghetti\" hairstyle for his opening match at the World Cup.\n\nFive days later, it appears to have gone.\n\nWarming up for the game against Costa Rica in St. Petersburg, the Brazil forward had a more routine haircut with his fringe swept back and those long, curly pasta-style locks nowhere to be seen.\n\nWhat will he come up with for Serbia on Tuesday?\n\n___\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nThis World Cup is right on pace to be the lowest scoring ever despite no goalless games so far.\n\nJust 51 goals have been scored in 23 games going into Friday's play, at a rate of 2.217 per game.\n\nThe rate was 2.212 at the 1990 World Cup in Italy — a tournament seen as a low point for exciting games.\n\nIn 1990, the 24-nation format rewarded cautious play in the group stage by sending some third-place teams into the Round of 16.\n\nThe most prolific World Cup in terms of scoring was 5.38 per game in 1954 hosted by Switzerland.\n\nIn the 32-team tournament era, the record goals tally was 171 — a rate of 2.67 per game — in 1998 in France and four years ago in Brazil.\n\nThe all-time average goals per game since 1930 was 2.85 before the tournament kicked off play in Russia.\n\n___\n\n1:20 p.m.\n\nPSV Eindhoven says coach Phillip Cocu is moving to Fenerbahce and will be replaced by Australia's assistant coach Mark van Bommel.\n\nThe Dutch club announced Cocu's departure Friday and said Van Bommel, who is Bert van Marwijk's assistant at the World Cup, has a three-year contract to replace him.\n\nVan Bommel, a tough tackling midfielder, played at PSV for six seasons before moving overseas to play at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AC Milan.\n\nBefore the World Cup, the 41-year-old Van Bommel had been coaching PSV's youth players as the club groomed him to succeed Cocu. PSV General Manager Toon Gerbrands says, \"He's ready.\"\n\nPSV says Van Bommel will return to Eindhoven after Australia's last match in Russia.\n\nCocu led PSV to three Eredivisie titles in his five years in Eindhoven.\n\nAustralia is third in World Cup Group C, after losing 2-1 to France and a 1-1 draw with Denmark\n\n___\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nEgypt is set to lodge a complaint to FIFA about what its federation chairman describes as the \"injustice\" of the match officials during the team's World Cup loss to Russia.\n\nEgyptian Football Association chairman Hany Abo Rida says the match officials \"did not achieve justice\" in the game.\n\nEgypt's 3-1 loss to Russia, combined with Saudi Arabia's loss to Uruguay, ended its changes of progressing beyond the group stage at its first World Cup in 28 years. Egypt and Saudi Arabia meet Monday in Volgograd in their last Group A match.\n\nAbo Rida, speaking from the Egyptian squad's World Cup base in Grozny, Chechnya, did not specify which incident would form the basis of the complaint.\n\nThe Egyptians contend that defender Ahmed Fathi was pushed before the ball deflected off him for an own goal that gave the Russians a 1-0 lead. The players also thought forward Mohsen Marwan should have been awarded a penalty when he was brought down inside the box. Both incidents took place in the second half."
