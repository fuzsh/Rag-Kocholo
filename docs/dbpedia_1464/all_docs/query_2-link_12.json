Ovarian blood flow was measured using a laser Doppler flowmeter. Blood pressure was markedly increased following 49 degrees C stimulation. Ovarian blood flow, however, showed no obvious change during stimulation, although a small increase was observed after stimulation. Ovarian blood flow and blood pressure responses to 49 degrees C stimulation were abolished after hindlimb somatic nerves proximal to the stimuli were cut. Heat stimulation (49 degrees C) resulted in remarkable increases in both ovarian blood flow and blood pressure in rats in which the sympathetic nerves supplying the ovary were cut but the hindlimb somatic nerves remained intact. The efferent activity of the ovarian plexus nerve was increased during stimulation at 49 degrees C. Stimulation at 40 degrees C had no effect upon ovarian blood flow, blood pressure or ovarian plexus nerve activity. Electrical stimulation of the distal part of the severed ovarian plexus nerve resulted in a decrease in both the diameter of ovarian arterioles, observed using a digital video microscope, and ovarian blood flow.The present results demonstrate that noxious heat, but not non-noxious warm, stimulation of the hindpaw skin in anesthetized rats influences ovarian blood flow in a manner that is attributed to reflex responses in ovarian sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure.\n\nIndividualization of controlled ovarian stimulation in vitro fertilization using ovarian reserve markers.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrisendi, Valentina; La Marca, Antonio\n\n2017-06-01\n\nIn assisted reproduction technologies (ART) the controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) therapy is the starting point from which a good oocytes retrieval depends. Treatment individualization is based on ovarian response prediction, which largely depends on a woman's ovarian reserve. Anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count (AFC) are considered the most accurate and reliable markers of ovarian reserve. A literature search was carried out for studies that addressed the ability of AMH and AFC to predict poor and/or excessive ovarian response in IVF cycles. According to the predicted response to ovarian stimulation (poor- normal- or high-response) is today possible not only to personalize pre-treatment counseling with the couple, but also to individualize the ovarian stimulation protocol, choosing among GnRH-agonists or antagonists for endogenous follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) suppression and formulating the FSH starting dose most adequate for the single patients. In this review we discuss how to choose the best COS therapy for the single patient, on the basis of the markers-guided ovarian response prediction.\n\nHow to personalize ovarian stimulation in clinical practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nSighinolfi, Giovanna; Grisendi, Valentina; La Marca, Antonio\n\n2017-09-01\n\nControlled ovarian stimulation (COS) in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles is the starting point from which couple's prognosis depends. Individualization in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) starting dose and protocol used is based on ovarian response prediction, which depends on ovarian reserve. Anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone levels and the antral follicle count are considered the most accurate and reliable markers of ovarian reserve. A literature search was performed for studies that addressed the ability of ovarian reserve markers to predict poor and high ovarian response in assisted reproductive technology cycles. According to the predicted response to ovarian stimulation (poor- normal- or high- response), it is possible to counsel couples before treatment about the prognosis, and also to individualize ovarian stimulation protocols, choosing among GnRH-agonists or antagonists for endogenous FSH suppression, and the FSH starting dose in order to decrease the risk of cycle cancellation and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. In this review we discuss how to choose the best COS therapy, based on ovarian reserve markers, in order to enhance chances in IVF.\n\nOvarian parameters and ovarian blood flow of women living in the area of environmental crisis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBalmagambetova, Aru; Abdelazim, Ibrahim A; Bekmukhambetov, Erbol; Zhurabekova, Gulmira; Yehia, Amr H; AbuFaza, Mohannad\n\n2016-05-01\n\nExposure to environmental hazards will destroy a number of ovarian primordial follicles, reduce ovarian reserve and subsequent reproductive ability. This study designed to evaluate ovarian parameters and ovarian blood flow of women living in the area of environmental crisis Shalkar city (Kazakhstan) compared to women living in Aktobe city (Kazakhstan). 220 women in their reproductive age studied and classified into two groups; study (Shalkar) group and control (Aktobe) group. Blood sample taken from studied women during follicular phase (day 3) for hormonal level evaluation including; follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH). Studied women evaluated using trans-vaginal ultrasound (TVS) to detect antral follicle count (AFC) during follicular scan and ovarian volume (OV), ovarian blood flow (OBF) using pulsatility index (PI) during follicular scan and luteal scan. Both ovaries AFC was significantly less in study (Shalkar) group compared to and control (Aktobe) group (p=0.0001). Mean ovarian volume was significantly less in Shalkar group in both follicular phase and luteal phase (5.86Â±0.23 and 6.19Â±0.22Cm(3); respectively) compared to Aktobe group (6.85Â±0.19 and 6.92Â±0.18Cm(3); respectively). In addition, mean ovarian pulsatility index was significantly high with subsequent decrease in ovarian blood flow in Shalkar group in both follicular phase and luteal phase (3.36Â±0.20 and 3.45Â±0.19Cm/s; respectively) compared to Aktobe group (2.96Â±0.16 and 2.92Â±0.15Cm/s; respectively). This study suggests definite environmental effect on ovarian parameters as indicated by decreased AFC, decreased both follicular and luteal OV and OBF in women living in environmental crisis Shalkar group compared to Aktobe group.

A mild ovarian stimulation strategy in women with poor ovarian reserve undergoing IVF leads to similar ongoing pregnancy rates as a conventional ovarian stimulation strategy. Women diagnosed with poor ovarian reserve are treated with a conventional ovarian stimulation strategy consisting of high-dose gonadotropins and pituitary downregulation with a long mid-luteal start GnRH-agonist protocol. Previous studies comparing a conventional strategy with a mild ovarian stimulation strategy consisting of low-dose gonadotropins and pituitary downregulation with a GnRH-antagonist have been under powered and their effectiveness is inconclusive. This open label multicenter randomized trial was designed to compare one cycle of a mild ovarian stimulation strategy consisting of low-dose gonadotropins (150 IU FSH) and pituitary downregulation with a GnRH-antagonist to one cycle of a conventional ovarian stimulation strategy consisting of high-dose gonadotropins (450 IU HMG) and pituitary downregulation with a long mid-luteal GnRH-agonist in women of advanced maternal age and/or women with poor ovarian reserve undergoing IVF between May 2011 and April 2014. Couples seeking infertility treatment were eligible if they fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: female age â¥35 years, a raised basal FSH levelÂ >10 IU/ml irrespective of age, a low antral follicular count of â¤5 follicles or poor ovarian response or cycle cancellation during a previous IVF cycle irrespective of age. The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy rate per woman randomized. Analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis. We randomly assigned 195 women to the mild ovarian stimulation strategy and 199 women to the conventional ovarian stimulation strategy. Ongoing pregnancy rate was 12.8% (25/195) for mild\n\nRelationships between ovarian blood flow and ovarian response to eCG-treatment of dairy cows.\n\nPubMed\n\nHonnens, A; Niemann, H; Herzog, K; Paul, V; Meyer, H H D; Bollwein, H\n\n2009-07-01\n\nThe goal of the present study was to investigate ovarian blood flow and ovarian response in cows undergoing a gonadotropin treatment to induce a superovulatory response, using transrectal colour Doppler sonography. Forty-two cows including 19 cross-bred, 14 German Holstein and 9 German Black Pied cows were examined sonographically before hormonal stimulation on Day 10 of the oestrous cycle, three days after administration of eCG (Day 13) and seven days after artificial insemination (Day 7(p.i.)). After each Doppler examination, blood was collected for determination of total oestrogens (E) and progesterone (P4) in peripheral plasma. The blood flow volume (BFV) and pulsatility index (PI), which is a measure for blood flow resistance, were determined in the ovarian artery, and B-mode sonography was used to count dominant follicles and corpora lutea. Important criteria to assess the ovarian response following the hormonal treatment were the number of follicles >5mm in diameter on Day 13 and the number of corpora lutea on Day 7(p.i.) per cow. The number of follicles ranged from 2 to 61 (mean+/-S.E.M.: 17.5+/-1.7) and corpora lutea from 0 to 50 (mean+/-S.E.M.: 17.0+/-1.6). The BFV increased from 28.4 to 45.0 ml/min between Days 10 and 13 and reached a maximum of 108.5 ml/min on Day 7(p.i.) The PI decreased from 6.25 on Day 10 to 4.70 on Day 13 and to 2.10 on Day 7(p.i.) The BFV and PI on Day 13 did not correlate with the number of follicles (P>0.05). However, on Day 7(p.i.) the number of corpora lutea correlated positively with the BFV (r=0.64; P<0.0001), and an inverse relationship was found for the PI (r=-0.51; P=0.0005). There were no correlations (P>0.05) between the BFV and PI on Day 10 and the number of follicles on Day 13 or the number of corpora lutea on Day 7(p.i.) Results of the present study show that in cows, a hormonal treatment to induce a superovulatory response yielded a marked increase in BFV and a marked decrease in PI in the ovarian artery.

Evidence supports an individualized approach to ovarian stimulation, usually involving combinations of ovarian reserve tests, body mass index and age to tailor the exogenous gonadotropin dose, and potentially adjuvant treatment aiming for high safety and a shortening of time to live birth. While stimulation and trigger concepts have been developed successfully in normo- and hyperresponder patients, the poor responder patient remains difficult to manage. However, recent advances in definition and classification of the expected poor ovarian responder patient might enable a more accurate and clinically useful interpretation of new treatment concepts in a more homogenous study population. In the present review, we discuss the classification of the expected poor ovarian responder patient as well as clinically useful measurements of efficacy for controlled ovarian stimulation, and finally, we discuss the evidence for clinical management of patients with expected poor ovarian response, including adjuvant treatments such as growth hormone, androgens, and LH activity.In conclusion, the best available evidence supports that the treatment of the expected poor ovarian response patient should be individualized in all steps of ART, including the choice of GnRH analogue, the gonadotropin type and dose, ovulation trigger, and the possible use of adjuvant therapies.\n\nReference values in ovarian response to controlled ovarian stimulation throughout the reproductive period.\n\nPubMed\n\nLa Marca, Antonio; Grisendi, Valentina; Spada, Elena; Argento, Cindy; Milani, Silvano; Plebani, Maddalena; Seracchioli, Renato; Volpe, Annibale\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAbstract The age-related decline in ovarian response to gonadotropins has been well known since the beginning of ovarian stimulation in IVF cycles and has been considered secondary to the age-related decline in ovarian reserve. The objective of this study was to establish reference values and to construct nomograms of ovarian response for any specific age to gonadotropins in IVF/ICSI cycles. We analyzed our database containing information on IVF cycles. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 703 patients were selected. Among inclusion criteria, there were regular menstrual cycle, treatment with a long GnRH agonist protocol and starting follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) dose of at least 200âIU per day. To estimate the reference values of ovarian response, the CG-LMS method was used. A linear decline in the parameters of ovarian response with age was observed: the median number of oocytes decreases approximately by one every three years, and the median number of follicles >16âmm by one every eight years. The number of oocytes and growing follicles corresponding to the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th centiles has been calculated. This study confirmed the well known negative relationship between ovarian response to FSH and female ageing and permitted the construction of nomograms of ovarian response.\n\nFollicular fluid placental growth factor is increased in polycystic ovarian syndrome: correlation with ovarian stimulation.\n\nPubMed\n\nTal, Reshef; Seifer, David B; Grazi, Richard V; Malter, Henry E\n\n2014-08-20\n\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by increased ovarian angiogenesis and vascularity. Accumulating evidence indicates that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is increased in PCOS and may play an important role in these vascular changes and the pathogenesis of this disease. Placental growth factor (PlGF), a VEGF family member, has not been previously characterized in PCOS women. We investigated levels and temporal expression patterns of PlGF and its soluble receptor sFlt-1 (soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase) in serum and follicular fluid (FF) of women with PCOS during controlled ovarian stimulation. This was a prospective cohort study of 14 PCOS women (Rotterdam criteria) and 14 matched controls undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation. Serum was collected on day 3, day of hCG and day of oocyte retrieval. FF was collected on retrieval day. PlGF, sFlt-1 and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) protein concentrations were measured using ELISA. Since sFlt-1 binds free PlGF, preventing its signal transduction, we calculated PlGF bioavailability as PlGF/sFlt-1 ratio. Serum PlGF and sFlt-1 levels were constant throughout controlled ovarian stimulation, and no significant differences were observed in either factor in PCOS women compared with non-PCOS controls at all three measured time points. However, FF PlGF levels were increased 1.5-fold in PCOS women compared with controls (pâ<â0.01). Moreover, FF PlGF correlated positively with number of oocytes retrieved and the ovarian reserve marker anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and negatively with age. In addition, FF sFlt-1 levels were decreased 1.4-fold in PCOS women compared to controls (pâ=â0.04). PlGF bioavailability in FF was significantly greater (2-fold) in PCOS women compared with non-PCOS controls (pâ<â0.01). These data provide evidence that FF PlGF correlates with ovarian stimulation and that its bioavailability is increased in women with PCOS undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation. This\n\nThe ISMAAR proposal on terminology for ovarian stimulation for IVF.\n\nPubMed\n\nNargund, G; Fauser, B C J M; Macklon, N S; Ombelet, W; Nygren, K; Frydman, R\n\n2007-11-01\n\nIVF is performed with oocytes collected in natural and stimulated cycles. Different approaches to ovarian stimulation have been employed worldwide. Following the introduction of GnRH antagonists and strategies to reduce multiple births such as single embryo transfer, there is a genuine scientific interest in the revival of natural cycle and mild approaches to ovarian stimulation in IVF. Recent evidence suggests that application of natural and mild IVF is patient-centred, aimed at reducing the cost of treatment, patient discomfort and multiple pregnancies. However, there seems to be no consistency in the terminology used for definitions and protocols for ovarian stimulation in IVF cycles. Following the recent International Society for Mild Approaches in Assisted Reproduction (ISMAAR) meeting and communication with interested international experts, this article has recommended revised definitions and terminology for natural cycle IVF and different protocols used in ovarian stimulation for IVF. It is proposed that these terms are adopted internationally in order to achieve a consistency in clinical practice, research publications and communication with patients.\n\nChanges in ovarian reserve and ovarian blood flow in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome following laparoscopic ovarian drilling.\n\nPubMed\n\nKamal, Nasser; Sanad, Zakaria; Elkelani, Osama; Rezk, Mohamed; Shawky, Mohamed; Sharaf, Abd-Elbar\n\n2018-04-10\n\nThis prospective cohort study was conducted on 80 patients with clomiphene citrate (CC)-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome undergoing laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD). Pre- and post-LOD ovarian reserve parameters (anti-Mullerian hormone: AMH, ovarian volume: OV, and antral follicle count: AFC) and ovarian stromal blood flow indices (Vascularization index: VI, flow index: FI, and vascularization flow index: VFI) were measured to explore the effect of LOD and to find out the correlation between serum AMH and different clinical, hormonal, and ultrasonic variables. There was a highly significant reduction of the serum AMH (pâ<â.001) after LOD with significant reduction in OV, AFC and vascular indices (VI, FI and VFI) of the right and left ovaries (pâ<â.05). LOD significantly reduced ovarian reserve parameters (AMH, OV and AFC) and ovarian stromal blood flow indices (VI, FI and VFI) with no observed correlation between AMH levels and Doppler indices.\n\nDual ovarian stimulation and random start in assisted reproductive technologies: from ovarian biology to clinical application.\n\nPubMed\n\nVaiarelli, Alberto; Venturella, Roberta; Vizziello, Damiano; Bulletti, Francesco; Ubaldi, Filippo M\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe opportunity to use gonadotropins to stimulate the growth of antral follicles coming from different follicular waves available in different moment of the menstrual cycle allowed the implementation of innovative protocols in assisted reproductive technologies. The purpose of this review is to explore the possible advantages related to these new controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) strategies. Women exhibit major and minor wave patterns of ovarian follicular development during the menstrual cycle, as it is in animal species. These observations led to the introduction of two new strategies for COS: the random start and the double ovarian stimulation within a single menstrual cycle. The use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist COS protocols, started randomly at any day of the menstrual cycle, is today a standard procedure in those cases where obtaining oocytes is an urgent task, such as in case of fertility preservation for malignant diseases or other medical indications.On the other hand, in poor prognosis patients, double ovarian stimulation has been suggested with the aim of maximizing the number of oocytes retrieved within a single menstrual cycle and, in turn increasing the chance to obtain a reproductively competent embryo. Randomized control trials are necessary to confirm these preliminary findings.\n\n[Evolution of ovarian stimulation in in vitro fertilization].\n\nPubMed\n\nDelbaere, A; Devreker, F; Hannes, M; Koenig, I; Holoye, A; Englert, Y\n\n1999-10-01\n\nThis paper reviews the different treatments of ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF). It emphasizes the recent development of new molecules, including recombinant gonadotrophins and GnRH antagonists. Because of their higher purity, recombinant gonadotrophins are theoretically less immunogenic than the urinary forms. Their preparation mode ensures a better batch to batch consistency. Their clinical use in IVF seems to be associated with a higher number of developing follicules and retrieved oocytes, but pregnancy rates are comparable to those obtained after ovarian stimulation with urinary gonadotrophins. The GnRH antagonists induce a direct inhibition of the pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. In association with an ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophins, they efficiently prevent premature LH surges when administered during the end of the follicular phase. The GnRH antagonists are still in clinical evaluation phase and the optimal protocol and dose still to be defined. They should become available in the coming year. The risks related to the controlled hyperstimulation together with the reduction of the number of transferred embryos has recently led \"soft stimulation\" to a reevaluation of the stimulation protocols towards a simplified procedure. However, the validity of this attitude could be in opposition with the wish to limit the number of transferred embryos since embryo quality seems to be directly related to the total number of embryos.\n\nEffect of ovarian endometrioma on uterine and ovarian blood flow in infertile women.\n\nPubMed\n\nEl-Mazny, Akmal; Kamel, Ahmed; Ramadan, Wafaa; Gad-Allah, Sherine; Abdelaziz, Suzy; Hussein, Ahmed M\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAngiogenesis has been found to be among the most important factors in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The formation of new blood vessels is critical for the survival of newly implanted endometriotic foci. The use of 3-D power Doppler allows for the demonstration of the dynamic vascular changes that occur during the process of in vitro fertilization (IVF). We aimed to evaluate the effect of ovarian endometrioma on uterine and ovarian blood flow in infertile women. In a case-control study at a university teaching hospital, 138 women with unilateral ovarian endometrioma scheduled for IVF were compared to 138 women with male-factor or unexplained infertility. In the mid-luteal (peri-implantation) phase of the cycle, endometrial thickness, uterine and ovarian artery pulsatility index and resistance index, endometrial and ovarian volume, 3-D power Doppler vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization FI (VFI) values were measured in both groups. There were no significant differences ( P >0.05) in endometrial thickness, uterine ovarian artery pulsatility index and resistance index, endometrial and ovarian volume, or VI, FI, and VFI between the two groups. Furthermore, the endometrial and ovarian Doppler indices were not influenced by endometrioma size. No significant differences were observed in the ovarian Doppler indices between endometrioma-containing ovaries and contralateral ovaries. Ovarian endometrioma is not associated with impaired endometrial and ovarian blood flows in infertile women scheduled for IVF, and it is not likely to affect endometrial receptivity or ovarian function through a vascular mechanism.\n\nResponse to ovarian stimulation is not impacted by a breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nQuinn, Molly M; Cakmak, Hakan; Letourneau, Joseph M; Cedars, Marcelle I; Rosen, Mitchell P\n\n2017-03-01\n\nDoes a breast cancer diagnosis impact ovarian function in the setting of fertility preservation? Ovarian reserve and ovarian stimulation outcomes are similar in patients with a new diagnosis of breast cancer and patients undergoing elective fertility preservation. Prior studies, with small study populations, lack of controlling for individual differences in ovarian reserve and infertile controls, have reported conflicting outcomes for cancer patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for fertility preservation. This retrospective cohort analysis included 589 patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for fertility preservation between 2009 and 2015. Women with a recent breast cancer diagnosis (n = 191) and women desiring elective fertility preservation (n = 398) underwent ovarian stimulation with an antagonist protocol at an academic medical center. The aromatase inhibitor letrozole was administered to breast cancer patients with estrogen-sensitive disease. Baseline antral follicle count (AFC) was not different between the breast cancer patients and controls (15.4 Â± 10.4 [mean Â± SD] vs 15.4 Â± 10.0, P = NS), even after categorization by age. Total (19.4 Â± 0.9 [mean Â± SEM] vs 17.0 Â± 0.5, P = NS) and mature (MII) oocytes retrieved (13.7 Â± 0.7 vs 13.2 Â± 0.4, P = NS), adjusted for age, BMI and total gonadotropin dose, were also similar between the two groups. Letrozole use was associated with a decreased maturity rate (MII/total oocytes retrieved) compared to elective cryopreservation (0.71 Â± 0.01 vs 0.77 Â± 0.01, P < 0.001), although the mature oocyte yield [MII/AFC] was comparable (1.01 Â± 0.06 vs 0.93 Â± 0.03, P = NS). The single center design may impact generalizability. Additionally, the lack of subsequent embryo and pregnancy data is an inherent weakness. In females, a breast cancer diagnosis does not impact gonadal function as measured by AFC or ovarian stimulation outcomes. Breast cancer patients should be counseled that their response to ovarian stimulation\n\nRandom Start Ovarian Stimulation for Oocyte or Embryo Cryopreservation in Women Desiring Fertility Preservation Prior to Gonadotoxic Cancer Therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nDanis, Rachel B; Pereira, Nigel; Elias, Rony T\n\n2017-11-10\n\nWomen of reproductive age diagnosed with cancer are often interested in preserving gametes or reproductive tissue that would allow for future genetic parenthood. Preservation of fertility is often accomplished in young cancer patients via ovarian stimulation followed by oocyte or embryo cryopreservation. Conventional stimulation protocols, however, require 2-4 weeks to complete ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval and possible fertilization. Such a strategy may not be feasible in patients requiring urgent cancer treatment. Recent studies have highlighted that random start ovarian stimulation can be initiated irrespective of the phase of the menstrual cycle and is an attractive alternative to conventional ovarian stimulation. The primary aim of the current review is to discuss the feasibility and success of random start ovarian stimulation for oocyte or embryo cryopreservation in women desiring fertility preservation prior to gonadotoxic cancer therapy. We performed a systematic review of medical literature published between January 2000 to June 2017 reporting the utility of random start ovarian stimulation for fertility preservation. Search terms included \"fertility preservation,\" \"cancer,\" \"ovarian stimulation,\" \"random-start ovarian stimulation,\" \"embryo cryopreservation, and\" \"oocyte cryopreservation.\" Publications were included in this review only if patients underwent random start ovarian stimulation prior to cancer therapy. Nineteen publications were identified and perused by the authors. Most publications described the utility of random start ovarian stimulation in the setting of breast cancer. Radom-start stimulation was associated with a reduced time interval between ovarian stimulation initiation and oocyte or embryo cryopreservation. The yield of mature oocytes and their developmental potential into embryos was comparable between conventional and random-start protocols, albeit with higher gonadotropin doses in the latter. The current review suggests\n\nOocyte mitochondrial deletions and heteroplasmy in a bovine model of ageing and ovarian stimulation.\n\nPubMed\n\nHammond, Elizabeth R; Green, Mark P; Shelling, Andrew N; Berg, Martin C; Peek, John C; Cree, Lynsey M\n\n2016-04-01\n\nMaternal ageing and ovarian stimulation result in the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions and heteroplasmy in individual oocytes from a novel bovine model for human assisted reproductive technology (ART). The levels of mtDNA deletions detected in oocytes increased with ovarian ageing. Low levels of mtDNA heteroplasmy were apparent across oocytes and no relationship was identified with respect to ovarian ageing or ovarian stimulation. Oocyte quality decreases with ovarian ageing and it is postulated that the mtDNA may have a role in this decline. The impact of ovarian stimulation on oocyte quality is poorly understood. Human studies investigating these effects are often limited by the use of low quality oocytes and embryos, variation in age and ovarian stimulation regimens within the patients studied, as well as genetic and environmental variability. Further, no study has investigated mtDNA heteroplasmy in individual oocytes using next-generation sequencing (NGS), and little is known about whether the oocyte accumulates heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations following ageing or ovarian stimulation. A novel bovine model for the effect of stimulation and age in human ART was undertaken using cows generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) from one founder, to produce a homogeneous population with reduced genetic and environmental variability. Oocytes and somatic tissues were collected from young (3 years of age; n = 4 females) and old (10 years of age; n = 5 females) cow clones following multiple natural ovarian cycles, as well as oocytes following multiple mild (FSH only) and standard (based on human a long GnRH agonist protocol) ovarian stimulation cycles. In addition, oocytes were recovered in a natural cycle from naturally conceived cows aged 4-13.5 years (n = 10) to provide a heterogeneous cohort for mtDNA deletion studies. The presence or absence of mtDNA deletions were investigated using long-range PCR in individual oocytes (n = 62).

Personalization of treatment in IVF should be based on the prediction of ovarian response for every individual. The starting point is to identify if a woman is likely to have a normal, poor or a hyper response and choose the ideal treatment protocol tailored to this prediction. The objective of this review is to summarize the predictive ability of ovarian reserve markers, such as antral follicle count (AFC) and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), and the therapeutic strategies that have been proposed in IVF after this prediction. A systematic review of the existing literature was performed by searching Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane library and Web of Science for publications in the English language related to AFC, AMH and their incorporation into controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) protocols in IVF. Literature available to May 2013 was included. The search generated 305 citations of which 41 and 25 studies, respectively, reporting the ability of AMH and AFC to predict response to COS were included in this review. The literature review demonstrated that AFC and AMH, the most sensitive markers of ovarian reserve identified to date, are ideal in planning personalized COS protocols. These sensitive markers permit prediction of the whole spectrum of ovarian response with reliable accuracy and clinicians may use either of the two markers as they can be considered interchangeable. Following the categorization of expected ovarian response to stimulation clinicians can adopt tailored therapeutic strategies for each patient. Current scientific trend suggests the elective use of the GnRH antagonist based regimen for hyper-responders, and probably also poor responders, as likely to be beneficial.

Retrospective cohort study including 105 women aged between 18 and 40 years, who were referred for fertility preservation (oocyte vitrification) between 2013 and 2016. The women were divided into three groups: breast cancer, lymphoma or other cancer. All of them had been recently diagnosed with cancer, with gonadotoxic treatment scheduled, and had oocyte vitrification after ovarian stimulation with antagonist protocol. Baseline antral follicle count and anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone were no different between women with breast cancer, lymphoma or other cancer. The number of cancelled cycles for poor ovarian response was similar between the groups. The number of FSH units per mature oocyte, the number of mature oocytes (metaphase II) retrieved, and the oocyte maturity rate were not significantly different between the three groups. As the type of cancer does not seem to significantly affect ovarian reserve and ovarian response to ovarian stimulation, our results do not support the relevance of integrating this parameter when establishing ovarian stimulation protocol for oocyte vitrification cycle in women with cancer.

As the freezing of entire cohorts does not compromise, and may even improve, the results of IVF attempts, it is possible to break away from the standard sequence of stimulation-retrieval-transfer. The constraints associated with ovarian stimulation in relation to the potential harmful effects of the hormonal environment on endometrial receptivity can be avoided. This review will look at the new stimulation protocols where progesterone is used to block the LH surge. Thanks to 'freeze all' strategies, the increase in progesterone could actually be no longer a cause for concern. There are two ways of using progesterone, whether it be endogenous, as in luteal phase stimulation, or exogenous, as in the use of progesterone in the follicular phase i.e. progestin primed ovarian stimulation. A literature search was carried out (until September 2016) on MEDLINE. The following text words were utilized to generate the list of citations: progestin primed ovarian stimulation, luteal phase stimulation, luteal stimulation, duostim, double stimulation, random start. Articles and their references were then examined in order to identify other potential studies. All of the articles are reported in this review. The use of progesterone during ovarian stimulation is effective in blocking the LH surge, whether endogenous or exogenous, and it does not affect the number of oocytes collected or the quality of the embryos obtained. Its main constraint is that it requires total freezing and delayed transfer. A variety of stimulation protocols can be derived from these two methods, and their implications are discussed, from fertility preservation to ovarian response profiles to organization for the patients and clincs. These new regimens enable more flexibility and are of emerging interest in daily practice. However\n\nThe role of aromatase inhibitors in ameliorating deleterious effects of ovarian stimulation on outcome of infertility treatment\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMitwally, Mohamed FM; Casper, Robert F; Diamond, Michael P\n\n2005-01-01\n\nClinical utilization of ovulation stimulation to facilitate the ability of a couple to conceive has not only provided a valuable therapeutic approach, but has also yielded extensive information on the physiology of ovarian follicular recruitment, endometrial receptivity and early embryo competency. One of the consequences of the use of fertility enhancing agents for ovarian stimulation has been the creation of a hyperestrogenic state, which may influence each of these parameters. Use of aromatase inhibitors reduces hyperestrogenism inevitably attained during ovarian stimulation. In addition, the adjunct use of aromatase inhibitors during ovarian stimulation reduces amount of gonadotropins required for optimum stimulation. The unique approach of reducing hyperestrogenism, as well as lowering amount of gonadotropins without affecting the number of mature ovarian follicles is an exciting strategy that could result in improvement in the treatment outcome by ameliorating the deleterious effects of the ovarian stimulation on follicular development, endometrial receptivity, as well as oocyte and embryo quality.

Availability of folate affects DNA methylation profiles and thereby gene expression profiles. We investigated the effects of low-dose folic acid use (0.4 mg/d) on the ovarian response to mild and conventional ovarian stimulation in women. In a randomized trial among subfertile women, 24 and 26 subjects received conventional and mild ovarian stimulation, respectively. Blood samples were taken during the early follicular phase of the cycle prior to treatment and on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration for determination of serum total homocysteine, anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH), estradiol, and folate. Folic acid use was validated by questionnaire and serum folate levels. Preovulatory follicles were visualized, counted, and diameters recorded using transvaginal ultrasound. The relation between folic acid use and ovarian response was assessed using linear regression analysis. Folic acid use modified the ovarian response to ovarian stimulation treatment. The estradiol response was higher in nonfolic acid users receiving conventional treatment [Î²(interaction) = 0.52 (0.07-0.97); P = 0.03], and this effect was independent of serum AMH levels and the preovulatory follicle count. In the conventional treatment, the mean follicle number was also greater in nonusers compared with the users group (14.1 vs. 8.9, P = 0.03). Low-dose folic acid use attenuates follicular and endocrine responses to conventional stimulation, independent of AMH and follicle count. The nature of this observation suggests that the effect of folic acid is most prominent during early follicle development, affecting immature follicles. Deleterious effects of folate deficiency, like DNA hypomethylation and oxidative stress, can help to explain our observations.\n\n[Which ovarian stimulation to which women: The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)].\n\nPubMed\n\nMerviel, P; BouÃ©e, S; MÃ©nard, M; Le Martelot, M-T; Roche, S; LeliÃ¨vre, C; Chabaud, J-J; Jacq, C; Drapier, H; Beauvillard, D\n\n2017-11-01\n\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a frequent pathology in the young woman, linking infertility to a metabolic disease. Initial support will include a plan (in the case of overweight or obesity) to lose at least 5 to 10% of the weight. Subsequently, clomiphene citrate is the first treatment for ovulation induction with pregnancy rates of 40 to 80% after 6 cycles. If there is resistance to clomiphene citrate, the choice will be between the ovarian drilling (50-60% of pregnancy in the year following, including the half spontaneous) or ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins. The risk of ovarian stimulation in these women is hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancies. We also discuss the place of the GnRH pulsatile administration, insulin-sensitizers, in vitro fertilization and in vitro maturation in these women. Once infertility support, these women should be long-term followed because of the neoplasic and cardiovascular risks they present. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The \"mild\" ovarian stimulation approach, in which a lower-than-average dose of exogenous gonadotropins is given and gonadotropin treatment is started from day 2 to 7 of the cycle, represents a significant step toward a more patient's friendly IVF. However, a clear view of its virtues and defects is still lacking, because only a few prospective randomized trials comparing \"mild\" vs. conventional stimulation exist, and they do not consider some important aspects, such as, e.g., thawing cycles. This review gives a complete panorama of the \"mild\" stimulation philosophy, showing its advantages vs. conventional ovarian stimulation, but also discussing its disadvantages. Both patients with a normal ovarian responsiveness to exogenous gonadotropins and women with a poor ovarian reserve are considered. Overall, we conclude that the level of evidence supporting the use of \"mild\" stimulation protocols is still rather poor, and further, properly powered prospective studies about \"mild\" treatment regimens are required.

An explorative randomized controlled trial was performed comparing one cycle of IVF with elective single-embryo transfer (eSET) versus three cycles of IUI-ovarian stimulation in couples with unexplained subfertility and a poor prognosis for natural conception, to assess the economic burden of the treatment modalities. The main outcome measures were ongoing pregnancy rates and costs. This study randomly assigned 58 couples to IVF-eSET and 58 couples to IUI-ovarian stimulation. The ongoing pregnancy rates were 24% in with IVF-eSET versus 21% with IUI-ovarian stimulation, with two and three multiple pregnancies, respectively. The mean cost per included couple was significantly different: â¬2781 with IVF-eSET and â¬1876 with IUI-ovarian stimulation (P<0.01). The additional costs per ongoing pregnancy were â¬2456 for IVF-eSET. In couples with unexplained subfertility, one cycle of IVF-eSET cost an additional â¬900 per couple compared with three cycles of IUI-ovarian stimulation, for no increase in ongoing pregnancy rates or decrease in multiple pregnancies. When IVF-eSET results in higher ongoing pregnancy rates, IVF would be the preferred treatment. Couples that have been trying to conceive unsuccessfully are often treated with intrauterine insemination (IUI) and medication to improve egg production (ovarian stimulation). This treatment carries the risk of multiple pregnancies like twins. We performed an explorative study among those couples that had a poor prognosis for natural conception. One cycle of IVF with transfer of one selected embryo (elective single-embryo transfer, eSET) was compared with three cycles of IUI-ovarian stimulation. The aim of this study was to assess the economic burden of both treatments. The Main outcome measures were number of good pregnancies above 12weeks and costs.

This offers a good opportunity to attain biological parenthood to individuals with gonadal insufficiency including cancer survivors. However, role of various intra- and extra-ovarian factors during PF growth initiation still remain poorly understood. Ovarian biology has assumed a different dimension due to emerging data on presence of pluripotent very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) and ovarian germ stem cells (OGSCs) in ovary surface epithelium (OSE) and the concept of postnatal oogenesis. The present study was undertaken to decipher effect of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on the growth initiation of PF during organ culture with a focus on ovarian stem cells. Serum-free cultures of marmoset (n=3) and human (young and peri-menopausal) ovarian cortical tissue pieces were established. Cortical tissue pieces stimulated with FSH (0.5 IU/ml) or bFGF (100 ng/ml) were collected on Day 3 for histological and molecular studies. Gene transcripts specific for pluripotency (Oct-4A, Nanog), early germ cells (Oct-4, c-Kit, Vasa) and to reflect PF growth initiation (oocyte-specific Gdf-9 and Lhx8, and granulosa cells specific Amh) were studied by q-RTPCR. A prominent proliferation of OSE (which harbors stem cells) and transition of PF to primary follicles was observed after FSH and bFGF treatment. Ovarian stem cells were found to be released on the culture inserts and retained the potential to spontaneously differentiate into oocyte-like structures in extended cultures. q-RTPCR analysis revealed an increased expression of gene transcripts specific for VSELs, OGSCs and early germ cells suggestive of follicular transition. The present study shows that both FSH and bFGF stimulate stem cells present in OSE and also lead to PF growth initiation.

In PCOS patients vascularization parameters are altered. Transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL) is a mini-invasive approach for ovarian drilling in PCOS patients. In this study, we assessed the effect of ovarian drilling using THL on ovarian volume (OV) and vascularization index (VI) using 3D power Doppler ultrasonography in CC-resistant PCOS patients. A case-control study on 123âCC-resistant PCOS women who underwent THL ovarian drilling was performed. Patients underwent 3D ultrasound and power Doppler to measure VI, flow index (FI), vascularization flow index (VFI) and to evaluate OV before and after the procedure, at six months, and on the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. After THL ovarian drilling, OV and power Doppler flow indices were significantly reduced compared to pre-operative values (OV: 7.85 versus 11.72âcm 3 , pâ<â0.01; VI: 2.50 versus 4.81, pâ<â0.01; VFI: 1.10 versus 2.16, pâ<â0.01; FI: 32.05 versus 35.37, pâ<â0.01). In conclusion, THL ovarian drilling seems to reduce OV and 3D power Doppler indices, and could therefore be a viable alternative to LOD in PCOS patients resistant to medical therapy.\n\nCirculating basal anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone levels as predictor of ovarian response in women undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization.\n\nPubMed\n\nNardo, Luciano G; Gelbaya, Tarek A; Wilkinson, Hannah; Roberts, Stephen A; Yates, Allen; Pemberton, Phil; Laing, Ian\n\n2009-11-01\n\nTo evaluate the clinical value of basal anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) measurements compared with other available determinants, apart from chronologic age, in the prediction of ovarian response to gonadotrophin stimulation. Prospective cohort study. Tertiary referral center for reproductive medicine and an IVF unit. Women undergoing their first cycle of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Basal levels of FSH and AMH as well as antral follicle count (AFC) were measured in 165 subjects. All patients were followed prospectively and their cycle outcomes recorded. Predictive value of FSH, AMH, and AFC for extremes of ovarian response to stimulation. Out of the 165 women, 134 were defined as normal responders, 15 as poor responders, and 16 as high responders. Subjects in the poor response group were significantly older then those in the other two groups. Anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone levels and AFC were markedly raised in the high responders and decreased in the poor responders. Compared with FSH and AFC, AMH performed better in the prediction of excessive response to ovarian stimulation-AMH area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC(AUC)) 0.81, FSH ROC(AUC) 0.66, AFC ROC(AUC) 0.69. For poor response, AMH (ROC(AUC) 0.88) was a significantly better predictor than FSH (ROC(AUC) 0.63) but not AFC (ROC(AUC) 0.81). AMH prediction of ovarian response was independent of age and PCOS. Anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone cutoffs of >3.75 ng/mL and <1.0 ng/mL would have modest sensitivity and specificity in predicting the extremes of response. Circulating AMH has the ability to predict excessive and poor response to stimulation with exogenous gonadotrophins. Overall, this biomarker is superior to basal FSH and AFC, and has the potential to be incorporated in to work-up protocols to predict patient's ovarian response to treatment and to individualize strategies aiming at reducing the cancellation rate and the iatrogenic complications of COH.\n\nProtein concentration in pre-ovulatory follicular fluid related to ovarian stimulation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSuchanek, E; Mujkic-Klaric, A; Grizelj, V; Simunic, V; Kopjar, B\n\n1990-05-01\n\nSixty follicular fluids obtained from 26 women with either clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) or hMG-induced ovulation were analyzed for the contents of total proteins, fibrinogen, plasminogen, antithrombin III, ceruloplasmin, alpha-2 macroglobulin, alpha-1 antitrypsin and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM). Concentrations of these proteins was correlated to the type of ovarian follicle growth induction. Follicular fluids from patients stimulated with clomiphene citrate-hMG contained significantly higher concentrations of ceruloplasmin than those treated with hMG alone. No significant differences in the concentrations of other proteins were noted between the two types of ovarian induction. A multivariate data analysis resulted in three Varimax factors (VRX I) suggesting that proteins with antiprotease activity in the follicular fluid may play a role in human follicle maturation. Follicular fluid Ig may reflect the degree of follicular wall permeability under hMG treatment. Accordingly, it may be assumed that a combination of different proteins described by VRX factors could be used for evaluation of ovarian stimulation.\n\nOvarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization alters the intrauterine cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor milieu encountered by the embryo.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoomsma, Carolien M; Kavelaars, Annemieke; Eijkemans, Marinus J C; Fauser, Bart C J M; Heijnen, Cobi J; Macklon, Nick S\n\n2010-10-01\n\nTo elucidate the impact of ovarian stimulation on the intrauterine milieu represented by the cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor profile in endometrial secretions aspirated before embryo transfer. Prospective cohort study. Fertility center in tertiary referral university hospital. Forty-two patients undergoing ovarian stimulation with GnRH analogues were recruited. They participated in both a natural and an ovarian-stimulated cycle for within patient comparisons. Endometrial secretion aspiration was performed immediately before embryo transfer. The concentrations of 17 mediators known to be involved in human embryo implantation were assessed by multiplex immunoassay. After correction for multiple testing, significantly higher concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HbEGF), eotaxin, and dickkopf homologue-1 were present in endometrial secretions obtained in stimulated compared with natural cycles. Endometrial secretion analysis provides a novel means of investigating the effect of ovarian stimulation on the intrauterine milieu. The in vivo milieu encountered by the embryo after transfer is significantly altered by ovarian stimulation. Copyright Â© 2010 American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Patient and method(s) 121 patients with benign ovarian endometroitic cysts were randomised to either laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy using bipolar electrocoagulation (61 patients) or laparotomic ovarian cystectomy using sutures (60 patients). Serum follicle-stimulating hormone, Antimullerian hormon, Basal antral follicle Count, mean ovarian diameter, and ovarian stromal blood flow velocity were measured at 6, 12 and 18Â months after surgery and compared in both groups. Result(s) A statistically significant increase of serum FSH was found in the laproscopic bipolar group at 6-, 12 and 18-month postoperativly compared to open laparotomy suture group. Also, a statistically significant decrease of the mean AMH value occurred in laproscopic bipolar group at 6-, 12 and 18-month follow- up compared to open laparotomy suture group. Basal antral follicle number, mean ovarian diameter and peak systolic velocity were significantly decreased during the 6-, 12,18 -month follow-up in laproscopic bipolar group compared to open laparotomy suture group. Conclusion(s) After laproscopic ovarian cystecomy for endometrioma all pareameter of ovarian reseve are significantly decreased on long term follow up as compared to open laprotomy.

Concrete practical recommendations for the dosage of gonadotropins, the preferred protocol and preventive methods to avoid ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) are lacking. We present retrospective data of 235 individually calculated gonadotropin low-dose stimulations for ART in a single center from 2012 to 2014. Clinical data and outcome parameter of patients diagnosed with PCOS according to Rotterdam criteria (nâ=â39) were compared with patients without PCOS (nâ=â196). The starting dose of gonadotropins was individually calculated depending on patients' age, BMI, ovarian reserve, ovarian response in previous cycles, and diagnostic criteria of PCOS. Mean age and duration of infertility did not differ between the groups, whereas mean BMI (pâ=â0.007) and AMH (pâ<â0.001) were higher in the PCOS-group. A lower mean FSH-starting and maximum dose was administered to women with PCOS (pâ<â0.001). The biochemical pregnancy rate of 42.4â% and the clinical pregnancy rate of 32.2â% for PCOS-patients did not differ from those of the control group (42.2â% and 34.4â% respectively). Neither mild, nor moderate or severe manifestation of OHSS occurred significantly more often in patients with PCOS. Our study supports the use of a calculated low-dose FSH-stimulation strategy in ART for patients with PCOS. Further randomized clinical trials should confirm this strategy and lead to define individual risk factors for OHSS, which can be used for recommendation of safer ART-techniques like in vitro maturation.\n\n[Corifollitropin alfa compared to daily FSH in controlled ovarian stimulation for oocyte donors].\n\nPubMed\n\nBenchabane, M; Santulli, P; Maignien, C; Bourdon, M; De Ziegler, D; Chapron, C; Gayet, V\n\n2017-02-01\n\nTo demonstrate that corifollitropin alfa is as effective as daily FSH in controlled ovarian stimulation of oocyte donors. From January 2013 to October 2015, 77 cycles controlled ovarian stimulation, derived from a continuous cohort of 77 oocyte donors, were analyzed. After synchronization by oestroprogestatif or estrogens, ovarian stimulation was started by corifollitropin alfa (Group corifollitropin alfa) or by daily FSH (Group daily FSH). In both groups, a GnRH antagonist was used for the prevention of premature surge of luteinizing hormone (LH). The induction of ovulation was induced by a GnRH agonist. The duration of treatment, estradiol rate, numbers of mature oocytes, fertilization rate, clinical and ongoing pregnancies rates were evaluated in the two groups. There is no difference for the age, the markers of ovarian reserve and the duration of treatment. The average rate of estradiol on the eighth day of the stimulation is lower for the corifollitropin alfa (845Â±694.5 vs 1742Â±1177.3, P<0.001), there is no difference in the number of mature oocytes retrieved (14.4 vs 13.4, P=0.979), with a fertilization rate significantly higher in the corifollitropin alfa group (59.8% vs 49.3%, P<0.001). The rate of ongoing pregnancies is higher but without reaching significant difference in this same group (36.6% vs 26%, P=0.277). As compared to daily FSH, corifollitropin alfa, in oocyte donors offers, advantages in terms of ease of use with identical efficiency. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Our aim is to compare the results obtained in IVF/ICSI cycles using the short protocol for controlled ovarian stimulation to the results from the modified mild protocol used in our department. A total of 240 cycles were conducted from January 2010 to December 2011. When comparing both protocols, it could be observed that there was a significant difference in the quantity of gonadotropins doses in the mild protocol and in the short protocol. No significant difference was observed regarding pregnancy rates per cycle, 22% and 26.2%, in short and mild protocols, respectively. The protocols of controlled ovarian stimulation are often associated with high risk of complications such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, excessive emotional stress, high rates of treatment dropouts, and abdominal discomfort. With the data obtained in this study, one can conclude that there are less risks and complications for the patient when using the mild stimulation protocol. It was also observed that in this group there was a slightly higher rate.\n\nProgestin-primed milder stimulation with clomiphene citrate yields fewer oocytes and suboptimal pregnancy outcomes compared with the standard progestin-primed ovarian stimulation in infertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nYe, Hongjuan; Tian, Hui; He, Wen; Lyu, Qifeng; Kuang, Yanping; Chen, Qiuju; Sun, Lihua\n\n2018-05-28\n\nOral progestin has recently been used to prevent premature LH surges in ovarian stimulation, and this progestin-primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) is effective and safe in patients with different ovarian reserves. The current data are lacking regarding how to individualize the gonadotropin dose and regimen for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). A retrospective cohort trial was performed to evaluate the efficacy of progestin-primed milder stimulation with clomiphene citrate (CC) compared to the standard progestin-primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) protocol for infertile women with PCOS. A total of 220 PCOS women were collected and classified into the study group (HMG 150Â IU/dâ+âCC 50Â mg/dâ+âMPA 10Â mg/d) and control group (HMG 225Â IU/dâ+âMPA 10Â mg/d). Ovulation was triggered by GnRH agonist 0.1Â mg and hCG 1000Â IU when dominant follicles matured. Viable embryos were cryopreserved for later transfer. The primary endpoint was the ongoing pregnancy rate. Secondary outcomes included the cycle characteristics and the live birth rate. The study group consumed less HMG (1470.0âÂ±â360.1Â IU vs 1943.8âÂ±â372.0Â IU, Pâ<â0.001) and harvested fewer oocytes than the control group (12.2âÂ±â7.4 vs 18.2âÂ±â9.7, Pâ<â0.001). The study group showed a higher mid-follicular LH concentration (4.49âÂ±â2.49 mIU/ml vs 2.52âÂ±â2.09 mIU/ml, Pâ<â0.05) but no endogenous LH surge. No between-group difference was found in the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (0.91% vs 0.91%, Pâ>â0.05).

The milder PPOS with CC in PCOS women led to lower oocyte yields and suboptimal pregnancy outcomes compared to the standard PPOS treatment. The two regimens both achieved a low incidence of OHSS.

Thirteen women were recruited. The uterine artery blood flow was studied using pulsed color Doppler ultrasonography and the ovarian stromal blood flow was measured using three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasonography. Ultrasound scan examinations and blood pressure measurements were performed in the morning and evening. The diastolic and the mean arterial pressures were significantly higher in the evening. An increase in the uterine artery pulsatility index and resistance index in the evening was observed. The ovarian vascularization index, vascularization flow index, and right ovarian flow index were significantly lower in the evening. Despite the small sample size, we have demonstrated the presence of a diurnal change in uterine artery and ovarian stromal blood flow after pituitary down-regulation. Such changes may be related to the systemic change in the sympathetic system and hence vascular resistance. Future study regarding ovarian stromal blood flow should take into account the effect of the time of the day on the readings in order to avoid misleading interpretation of data.\n\nShould luteal phase support be introduced in ovarian stimulation/IUI programmes? An evidence-based review.\n\nPubMed\n\nCohlen, B J\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWorld-wide, intrauterine insemination (IUI) is still one of the most applied techniques to enhance the probability of conception in couples with longstanding subfertility. The outcome of this treatment option depends on many confounding factors. One of the confounding factors receiving little attention is the quality of the luteal phase. From IVF studies, it is known that ovarian stimulation causes luteal phase deficiency. Based on the best available evidence, this short review summarizes the indications for mild ovarian stimulation combined with IUI and the optimal stimulation programme. While it has been established that stimulated IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles have deficient luteal phases, the question remains whether the quality of the luteal phase when only two or three corpora lutea are present (as is the case in stimulated IUI cycles) is impaired as well. There are too few large non-IVF trials studying luteal phase quality to answer this question. Recently a randomized trial has been published that investigated luteal phase support in an IUI programme. This study is discussed in detail. It is recommended to apply luteal phase support in stimulated IUI cycles only when proven costeffective. Further trials are mandatory to investigate both endometrial and hormonal profile changes in the luteal phase after mild ovarian stimulation, and the cost-effectiveness of luteal support in IUI programmes.\n\nComparison of Results of Cycles Treated with Modified Mild Protocol and Short Protocol for Ovarian Stimulation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAguiar, L.

Our aim is to compare the results obtained in IVF/ICSI cycles using the short protocol for controlled ovarian stimulation to the results from the modified mild protocol used in our department. A total of 240 cycles were conducted from January 2010 to December 2011. When comparing both protocols, it could be observed that there was a significant difference in the quantity of gonadotropins doses in the mild protocol and in the short protocol. No significant difference was observed regarding pregnancy rates per cycle, 22% and 26.2%, in short and mild protocols, respectively. The protocols of controlled ovarian stimulation are often associated with high risk of complications such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, excessive emotional stress, high rates of treatment dropouts, and abdominal discomfort. With the data obtained in this study, one can conclude that there are less risks and complications for the patient when using the mild stimulation protocol. It was also observed that in this group there was a slightly higher rate.

The endpoints were: number of oocytes and mature oocytes retrieved, fertilization, cancellation and pregnancy rates. Methods This prospective crossover study enrolled poor responders from previous ovarian stimulation cycles submitted to a novel protocol called ANDRO-IVF. The protocol included pretreatment with transdermal AndroGel(r) (Besins) 25 mg, oral letrozole 2.5 mg and subcutaneous hCG 2500 IU; cycle control was performed with estradiol valerate and micronized progesterone; ovarian stimulation was attained with gonadotropins FSH/LH 450 IU, GnRH antagonist and hCG 5000 IU. Results Fourteen poor responders were enrolled. One patient did not meet the inclusion criteria. Thirteen patients previously summited to the standard protocol were offered the ANDRO-IVF Protocol.-Standard Protocol: Mean age: 35.30 years; cancellation rate: 61.53%; mean number of MII oocytes retrieved per patient: 1.8; fertilization rate: 33.33%. Only two patients had embryo transfers, and none got pregnant.-ANDRO-IVF Protocol: Mean age: 35.83 years; cancellation rate: 7.69%; mean number of oocytes retrieved per patient: 5.58, MII oocytes: 3.91. ICSI was performed in 84.61% of the patients and a mean of 1.5 embryos were transferred per patient. Fertilization rate: 62.5%; cumulative pregnancy rate: 16.66%; mean duration of stimulation: 9.77 days. Conclusion ANDRO-IVF allows intra-ovarian androgenization by increasing serum and intra-follicular androgen levels and preventing androgen aromatization. This protocol apparently improved clinical outcomes of poor responders in parameters such as number of oocytes retrieved and clinical pregnancy rates. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

Comparative study of the plasma and FF concentrations of total renin in women with and without PCOD after stimulation with hMG. In vitro fertilization-embryo transfer program at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the University Central Hospital of Turku, Finland. Thirty-six women undergoing IVF-ET for infertility with (n = 10) or without (n = 26) ultrasonographically diagnosed PCOD. Of the latter group, 15 women had tubal infertility, and the rest suffered from an anovulatory infertility and reacted with PCO-like ovarian response to stimulation. The concentrations of total renin in plasma and FF, serum E2, and protein in FF. The concentrations of plasma total renin after the gonadotropin stimulation were significantly higher in the PCOD and PCO-like groups when compared with the tubal group. The concentration of total renin in FF and the ratio of total renin per protein in FF were higher in the PCOD and PCO-like groups than in the tubal group, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Positive correlations were found between the plasma total renin and serum E2 concentrations in the PCO-like and in the tubal group and between plasma total renin concentrations and the number of mature follicles in all groups. Follicular fluid total renin did not correlate with FF protein in any group. All findings were independent of the total hMG dosage used and the body mass index of the patients. In the present study the concentrations of total renin in plasma were enhanced markedly after gonadotropin stimulation in women with PCOD compared with women having tubal infertility. The pattern of the hormonal secretions revealed a group of infertile patients reacting biochemically like women with PCOD.\n\nOccurrence of ovarian follicular dominance during stimulation for IVM impacts usable blastocyst yield.\n\nPubMed\n\nRomero, Sergio; Pella, Ricardo; Escudero, Francisco; PÃ©rez, Ygor; GarcÃ­a, Mario; Orihuela, Patricia\n\n2018-03-01\n\nTo evaluate the influence of ovarian follicular dominance on the outcome of oocyte in-vitro maturation. This retrospective cohort study included 21 patients with polycystic ovaries or polycystic ovary syndrome (Rotterdam criteria, 2004) subjected to 24 invitro maturation (IVM) cycles between October 2015 and January 2017. Patients undergoing IVM received minimal gonadotropin stimulation starting on day 2 or 3 of the cycle; ovum pick-up typically occurred on days 6 to 8. No hCG-trigger shot was given. Following 30h of IVM, mature oocytes were inseminated by ICSI and the resulting embryos cultured up to the blastocyst stage. Ovarian follicular dominance was observed in nine of the 24 IVM cycles. Oocyte IVM yielded an overall maturation rate of 69.3Â±23.8%, and no difference was observed when the groups with or without a dominant follicle were assessed independently. The rates of fertilization and usable blastocysts per fertilized oocyte, mature oocyte (Metaphase II) or cumulus-oocyte-complex were nearly three times higher (28.7Â±22.5%) in the group without ovarian follicular dominance. No differences were found in the clinical pregnancy rates attained by the individuals with or without a dominant follicle after 21 vitrified-warmed blastocyst transfer cycles. Occurrence of ovarian follicular dominance during hormonal stimulation for in-vitro maturation negatively impacted embryological outcomes. Strategies devised to limit the appearance of ovarian follicular dominance must be further explored.\n\nOccurrence of ovarian follicular dominance during stimulation for IVM impacts usable blastocyst yield\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRomero, Sergio; Pella, Ricardo; Escudero, Francisco; PÃ©rez, Ygor; GarcÃ­a, Mario; Orihuela, Patricia\n\n2018-01-01\n\nObjective To evaluate the influence of ovarian follicular dominance on the outcome of oocyte in-vitro maturation.

Diestrous mares received a single treatment of saline, 100Î¼g gonadorelin (GnRH), or 1500IU hCG 10days after ovulation. Plasma LH and progesterone concentrations, resistance index (RI) for ovarian artery blood-flow, and percentage of corpus luteum (CL) with color-Doppler signals of blood flow were determined immediately before treatment (hour 0) and at hours 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. In the GnRH group, LH increased (P<0.0001) between hours 0 and 0.25 and then progressively decreased; concentration of LH was not affected in the saline and hCG groups. Progesterone concentration was not different among groups. In the GnRH group, RI tended (P<0.07) to decrease between hours 0 and 1.5 and increased (P<0.01) between hours 1.5 and 4. In the hCG group, two transient RI decreases (P<0.05) occurred before hour 2. The percentage change from hour 0 in the percentage of CL with blood-flow signals was greater at hour 0.5 in the GnRH group than in the saline group and was intermediate in the hCG group. The similarity among groups in progesterone concentration indicated that changes in progesterone were not involved in the GnRH and hCG stimulation of ovarian vascular perfusion. Effects of treatment might have been mediated through LH; however, since hCG biological activity is primarily LH-like, the differences in timing and degree of ovarian and luteal blood flow changes after GnRH or hCG administration in the present study suggest that GnRH might have a direct effect on ovarian blood vessels and vascular control.

Oocytes collected from females with identical nuclear genetics show decreased mtDNA copy number and increased expression of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress gene with repect to ovarian stimulation, whilst differences in the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function, antioxidant protection and apoptosis were evident in relation to maternal ageing and the degree of ovarian stimulation in cumulus cells. Oocyte quality declines with advancing maternal age; however, the underlying mechanism, as well as the effects of ovarian stimulation are poorly understood. Human studies investigating these effects are often limited by differences in age and ovarian stimulation regimens within a patient cohort, as well as genetic and environmental variability. A novel bovine cross-sectional maternal age model for human IVF was undertaken. Follicles were aspirated from young (3 years of age; n = 7 females) and old (10 years of age; n = 5 females) Holstein Freisian clones following multiple unstimulated, mild and standard ovarian stimulation cycles. These bovine cloned females were generated by the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) from the same founder and represent a homogeneous population with reduced genetic and environmental variability. Maternal age and ovarian stimulation effects were investigated in relation to mtDNA copy number, and the expression of 19 genes involved in mitochondrial function, antioxidant protection, oocyte-cumulus cell signalling and follicle development in both oocytes and cumulus cells. Young (3 years of age; n = 7 females) and old (10 years of age; n = 5 females) Holstein Freisian bovine clones were maintained as one herd. Stimulation cycles were based on the long GnRH agonist down-regulation regimen used in human fertility clinics.

Five Santa InÃªs ewes were subjected to a short- (Days 0-6, Group 1) and five to a long-term progesterone-based protocol (Days 0-12, Group 2) to synchronize estrus and ovulations after the superovulatory treatment. Porcine FSH (pFSH, 200mg) was administered in 8 decreasing doses over 4 days, starting on Days 4 and 10 in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. After CIDR removal, all ewes were bred by a ram and embryos were recovered surgically 7 days later. Transrectal ovarian ultrasonography was performed the day before and on all 4 days of the superovulatory treatment. Both an arbitrary-scale [(0) non-detectable; (1) small; (2) moderate; (3) intense blood flow] and quantitative analysis of the blood flow area were used to assess the follicular blood flow in color Doppler images. There were no significant correlations between the arbitrary blood flow scores and superovulatory responses in the ewes of the present study. However, there was a positive correlation between the quantitative estimates of follicular blood flow on the final day of the superovulatory treatment, and the number (DA: r=0.68, P<0.05; DA/TAÃ100%: r=0.85, P<0.05) and percentage (DA: r=0.65, P<0.05; DA/TAÃ100%: r=0.91, P<0.001) of unfertilized eggs (DA: Doppler area, TA: total area of the largest ovarian cross section). This experiment presents a commercially practical tool for predicting superovulatory outcomes in ewes and evidence for the existence of follicular blood flow threshold that may impinge negatively on oocyte quality when surpassed during hormonal ovarian superstimulation.

Multiple factors influence the ovarian response to COS, making predictions about oocyte yields not so straightforward. As a result, the ovarian response may be poor or suboptimal, or even excessive, all of which have negative consequences for the affected patient. There is a group of patients that present with a suboptimal response to COS despite normal biomarkers of ovarian reserve, such as AFC and AMH. These patients have a lower number of retrieved oocytes than what was expected based on their ovarian reserve, thus showing the inadequacy of using only the traditional ovarian reserve biomarkers to predict the ovarian response. Suboptimal response to COS might be related to ovarian sensitivity to exogenous gonadotropins modulated by genetic factors. The understanding of the gene polymorphisms related to reproductive function can help to improve the clinical management of this patient population and to explain some of the individual patient variability in response to COS. The development of a pharmacogenetic approach concerning COS in the context of assisted reproduction seems attractive as it might help to understand the relationship between genetic variants and ovarian response to exogenous gonadotropins. The patient Ìs genetic profile could be used to select the most appropriate gonadotropin type, predict the optimal dosage for each drug, develop a cost-effective treatment plan, maximize the success rates, and lastly, decrease the time-to-pregnancy.\n\nHuman ovarian cancer stem/progenitor cells are stimulated by doxorubicin but inhibited by Mullerian inhibiting substance\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMeirelles, Katia; Benedict, Leo Andrew; Dombkowski, David; Pepin, David; Preffer, Frederic I.; Teixeira, Jose; Tanwar, Pradeep Singh; Young, Robert H.; MacLaughlin, David T.; Donahoe, Patricia K.; Wei, Xiaolong\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWomen with late-stage ovarian cancer usually develop chemotherapeutic-resistant recurrence. It has been theorized that a rare cancer stem cell, which is responsible for the growth and maintenance of the tumor, is also resistant to conventional chemotherapeutics. We have isolated from multiple ovarian cancer cell lines an ovarian cancer stem cell-enriched population marked by CD44, CD24, and Epcam (3+) and by negative selection for Ecadherin (Ecadâ) that comprises less than 1% of cancer cells and has increased colony formation and shorter tumor-free intervals in vivo after limiting dilution. Surprisingly, these cells are not only resistant to chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin, but also are stimulated by it, as evidenced by the significantly increased number of colonies in treated 3+Ecadâ cells. Similarly, proliferation of the 3+Ecadâ cells in monolayer increased with treatment, by either doxorubicin or cisplatin, compared with the unseparated or cancer stem cell-depleted 3âEcad+ cells. However, these cells are sensitive to Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS), which decreased colony formation. MIS inhibits ovarian cancer cells by inducing G1 arrest of the 3+Ecadâ subpopulation through the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. 3+Ecadâ cells selectively expressed LIN28, which colocalized by immunofluorescence with the 3+ cancer stem cell markers in the human ovarian carcinoma cell line, OVCAR-5, and is also highly expressed in transgenic murine models of ovarian cancer and in other human ovarian cancer cell lines. These results suggest that chemotherapeutics may be stimulative to cancer stem cells and that selective inhibition of these cells by treating with MIS or targeting LIN28 should be considered in the development of therapeutics.

Ovarian response to COH vary widely among POCS patients and while some patients are more likely to show resistance to COH, other experienced an exaggerated response. The aim of our study is to investigate a possible correlation between PCOS phenotypes and the variety of ovarian response to COH and ART outcomes in patients with different PCOS phenotypes. We retrospectively analyzed a total of 71 cycles performed in 44 PCOS infertile patients attending ART at Centre of Infertility and Assisted Reproduction of Pisa University between January 2013 and January 2016. Patientsundergoing IVF with GnRH-antagonist protocol and 150-225âUI/days of recombinant FSH; triggering was carried out using 250 mg of recombinant hCG or a GnRH analogous on the basis of the risk to OHSS. We observed that Phenotype B had a tendency to have a greater doses of gonadotropins used respect to all phenotypes. Phenotype A group showed a greater serum estrogen levels compared to all phenotypes groups, a greater number of follicles of diameter between 8-12âmm found by ultrasound on the day of triggering and a greater mean number of freeze embryo. Additionally serum AMH and antral follicles count (AFC) follow the same trend in the different phenotypes ad they were significantly higher in phenotype A and in phenotype D. In conclusion this study shows that the features of PCOS phenotypes reflect the variety of ovarian response to COH as well as the risks to develop OHSS. Serum AMH and AFC are related to the degree of ovulatory dysfunction making these 'added values' in identifying the different PCOS phenotypes. Phenotype A seems to be the phenotype with the higher risk to develop OHSS and the use of GnRH as a trigger seems to improve oocyte quality.

Corticosteroid effects on the functioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis are thought to be a key aspect of stress-mediated reproductive dysfunction. A vital component of the stress response is the pituitary secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which binds to the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) in the adrenal glands and activates cortisol biosynthesis. We recently reported MC2R mRNA abundance in fish gonads leading to the hypothesis that ACTH may be directly involved in gonadal steroid modulation. Using zebrafish (Danio rerio) ovarian follicles, we tested the hypothesis that acute ACTH stimulation modulates cortisol and estradiol (E2) secretion. ACTH neither affected cortisol nor unstimulated E2 release from ovarian follicles. However, ACTH suppressed human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated E2 secretion in a dose-related manner, with a maximum decrease of 62% observed at 1 I.U. ACTH mLâ1. This effect of ACTH on E2 release was not observed in the presence of either 8-bromo-cAMP or forskolin, suggesting that the mechanism(s) involved in steroid attenuation was upstream of adenylyl cyclase activation. Overall, our results suggest that a stress-induced rise in plasma ACTH levels may initiate a rapid down-regulation of acute stimulated E2 biosynthesis in the zebrafish ovary, underscoring a novel physiological role for this pituitary peptide in modulating reproductive activity.

Pretreatment with oral contraceptives increased the mono-ovulatory cycles, the duration of stimulation for noncanceled cycles, and the number of vials of gonadotropins used. It also reduced the number of dominant follicles and the peak E(2) levels for dominant follicles. No effect was observed in rates of cycle cancellation, pregnancy, abortion, live birth, multiple pregnancies, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\n\nDoes the Ovarian Stimulation Phase Length Predict In vitro Fertilization Outcomes?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlport, Brie; Case, Allison; Lim, Hyun; Baerwald, Angela\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Bi-directional communication between the follicle and oocyte is necessary to regulate follicle and oocyte development. Currently, it is not practical to monitor the serial growth of individual follicles during assisted reproduction. The ovarian stimulation phase length (SPL) is an indirect measure of mean follicular growth rate. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that a short or long SPL would be associated with suboptimal outcomes in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Materials and Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 140 women who underwent IVF. Follicle development was monitored every 2-3 days during ovarian stimulation using transvaginal ultrasonography. Once > 3 follicles reached â¥ 17 mm, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was administered. Oocyte retrieval was performed approximately 35 hours after hCG. Oocytes underwent IVF on the day of collection and were evaluated daily thereafter. Embryos were transferred on days 3 or 5, depending on the number and quality of embryos available. Associations between SPL, age, follicle, oocyte, embryo and pregnancy outcomes were evaluated (SPSS version 17.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results A SPL of 11 days was associated with an optimal number of follicles that developed to â¥ 6 mm, â¥ 10 mm and â¥ 15 mm; serum estradiol concentrations; and number of oocytes collected (p<0.05). Gradual reductions in the number of developing follicles, serum estradiol concentrations and number of oocytes collected occurred with SPL less than or greater than 11 days (p<0.05). The SPL did not influence endometrial, embryo or pregnancy outcomes (p>0.05). Associations between SPL and outcomes were not influenced by age (p>0.05). Conclusion The ovarian SPL can be used to predict the number of follicles that develop, oocytes collected and serum estradiol concentrations, but not embryo or pregnancy outcomes.

The real incidence in natural cycles has been poorly studied, so whether this frequency may be induced by external factors, such as use of gonadotropins for ovarian stimulation, remains unknown. Design: We conducted a prospective cohort study in a University-affiliated private infertility clinic with a comparison between unstimulated and stimulated ovarian cycles in the same women. Preimplantation genetic screening by fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed in all viable d 3 embryos. Objective: The primary objective was to compare the incidence of embryo chromosomal abnormalities in an unstimulated cycle and in an ulterior moderate ovarian stimulated cycle. Secondary outcome measures were embryo quality, blastocyst rate of biopsied embryos, number of normal blastocysts per donor, type of chromosomal abnormalities, and clinical outcome. Results: One hundred eighty-five oocyte donors were initially recruited for the unstimulated cycle, and preimplantation genetic screening could be performed in 51 of them, showing 35.3% of embryo chromosomal abnormalities. Forty-six of them later completed a stimulated cycle. The sperm donor sample was the same for both cycles. The proportion of embryos displaying abnormalities in the unstimulated cycle was 34.8% (16 of 46), whereas it was 40.6% (123 of 303) in the stimulated cycle with risk difference = 5.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) = â20.6â9.0], and relative risk = 1.17 (95% CI = 0.77â1.77) (P = 0.45). When an intrasubject comparison was made, the abnormalities rate was 34.8% (95% CI = 20.5â49.1) in the unstimulated cycle and 38.2% (95% CI = 30.5â45.8) in the stimulated cycle [risk difference = 3.4 (95% CI = â17.9â11.2); P = 0.64]. No differences were observed for embryo quality and type of chromosomal abnormalities. Conclusions: Moderate ovarian stimulation in young\n\nOvarian Stimulation in Patients With Cancer: Impact of Letrozole and BRCA Mutations on Fertility Preservation Cycle Outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nTuran, Volkan; Bedoschi, Giuliano; Emirdar, Volkan; Moy, Fred; Oktay, Kutluk\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAromatase inhibitors (AI) have been introduced to reduce estrogen exposure in women with estrogen-sensitive cancer undergoing ovarian stimulation for oocyte/embryo cryopreservation. There have been questions regarding whether the addition of AI and the presence of BRCA mutations affect cycle outcomes. We sought to determine the impact of letrozole and BRCA mutations on fertility preservation (FP) cycle outcomes of patients undergoing ovarian stimulation with an antagonist protocol. The data were generated by the secondary analysis of a prospective database of all females diagnosed with cancer who underwent embryo or oocyte cryopreservation for FP. The final analysis included 145 patients stimulated with an antagonist protocol either using letrozole combined with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH; LF, n = 118) or rFSH alone (FA, n = 24). The mean number of total (15.6 [7.9] vs 10.2 [7.8]; P = .004) and mature oocytes (10.4 [5.1] vs 7.8 [3.5]; P = .044) and embryos frozen (7.7 [5.3] vs 5.3 [2.7]; P = .043) were significantly higher after LF stimulation versus FA. In the LF group, women with BRCA mutations produced significantly fewer oocytes (11.0 [8.0] vs 16.4 [7.7], P = .015) and embryos (5.1 [4.4] vs 8.2 [4.7], P = .013), compared to those who were mutation negative. After adjusting for age, body mass index, baseline FSH level, and BRCA status, LF protocol still resulted in higher number of total oocytes (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9 to 3.6; P = .002) mature oocyte (95% CI: 0.3 to 1.4; P = .028), and embryo yield (95% CI: 0.7 to 1.4; P = .015). In women with cancer undergoing FP, letrozole appears to enhance response to ovarian stimulation while the presence of BRCA mutations is associated with lower oocyte and embryo yield.\n\nEfficiency of metaphase II oocytes following minimal/mild ovarian stimulation in vitro fertilization.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, John J; Yang, Mingxue; Merhi, Zaher\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAn inverse relationship between oocyte efficiency and ovarian response was reported in conventional IVF. The purpose of this study was to report metaphase II (MII) oocyte efficiency according to oocyte yield in minimal/mild stimulati"
