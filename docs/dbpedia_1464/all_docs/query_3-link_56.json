        "text": "My prediction: 9th place\n\nÍBV Vestmannaeyjar\n\nFounded 1903\n\nBest result: 2nd place 2003, 2003 and 2012\n\nLast years result: 8th place\n\nCoach: Andri Ólafsson\n\nAbout the team: The hometown of Margrét Lára Viðarsdóttir, Vestmannaeyjar has always had a good combination of local talent and foreign internationals. Last year was no exception. But after loosing their best player, the Canadian-Icelander, Cloé Lacasse to Benfica, the team crumbled. After a very disappointing season a new young coach was hired and many of the local key players decided to leave the club. To compensate, the club signed many new foreign internationals which leaves many questions to be asked about the team. Vestmannaeyjar is a beautiful town on the Island of Heymaey, just south of the mainland. Weather can be quite brutal there and so these foreign players have much to get used to. The town was nearly buried by lava in 1972 after a volcanic fissure opened up on the eastern part of the island. Instead of abandoning their town the townspeople decided to save their town by creating an elaborate pipe system to distribute sea water over the lava to cool it down and succeeded in doing so. This just shows how hardy these people are who live there, so never count them out.\n\nBest player: Fatma Kara (28), a Turkish international. Quick with good technique and vision. Can do things with the ball that other players can't do but also has a habit of turning off her game. Easily irritated and then looses interest.\n\nOther players to watch: Auður Sveinbjörnsdóttir (18) a young and promising goalkeeper and Karolina Miksone (20) a striker from Latvia, strong in the air and has a lot of pace.\n\nMy prediction: 8th place\n\nFH Hafnafjörður\n\nFounded: 1929\n\nChampions: 1972, 1974 and 1975\n\nLast years result: 2nd place in the 1. Division\n\nCoach: Guðni Eiríksson\n\nAbout the team: FH is back to the Úrvalsdeild after one year in the 1. division. Despite a slight slump during the second half of the season last year, the team looked solid with young and exciting players leading the charge. With the addition of two players with international experience, the team could surprise other teams that are now ranked above them prior to the season.\n\nBest player: Sigríður Lára Garðarsdóttir (26), a box to box midfielder with 20 international caps. Tall, strong and physical, she reminds me a little bit of Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir on the field. Of course, she does not share the same talent, drive or consistency as Gunnarsdóttir and is not as comfortable with the ball but she can score the occasional goal and has the same never say die attitude. This is the first time she plays with a club other than ÍBV in Iceland. She had though a short stint with Lilleström in 2018. A new challenge for her. Hopefully for FH, she will be able to rise to it.\n\nOther players to watch: Andrea Mist Pálsdóttir (22), another midfielder who can play in the hole behind the striker. Icelandic champion with Þór/KA in 2017. Has three caps to her name. Birta Georgsdóttir (18), one of the most promising prospects in Iceland today. Plays as a striker but can also play on the flanks. As of yet, she hasn't been prolific in front of the goal but the talent is there. Hopefully this year, the goals will come pouring in. Rannveig Bjarnadóttir (21), another exctiting young player who can also provide goals from the midfield.\n\nStjarnan\n\nFounded: 1960\n\nChampions: 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2016\n\nLast year: 5th place\n\nCoach: Kristján Guðmundsson\n\nMy prediction: 7th place\n\nAbout the team: The most most dominant team in Iceland in the last decade, it has seen some decline in the last three years: Gone are such players like Harpa Þorsteinsdóttir (67 caps, 19 goals) Gunnhildur Yrsa Jónsdóttur (71 caps, 10 goals), Glódís Perla Viggósdóttir (84 caps, 6 goals) and Anna Björk Kristjánsdóttir (43 caps). Instead the team has had to rely on players from their youth academy and are thinking long term. Last year, Stjarnan surprised everyone by finishing in 5th place at the end of the season. This year with a little added experience Stjarnan is expected to continue to cause some further upsets but can not hope for much better than 7th place, everything above that should be considered a bonus.\n\nBest Player: Betsy Hassett, a New Zealand international with 119 caps for her country and 13 goals. A surprise move from KR Reykjavík which will add much needed experience to the team. A good all around player with pace and good understanding of the game. A real boon for Stjarnan and a good role model.\n\nOther players to watch: Anna María Baldursdóttir (25), a player from the 95' class of Icelandic players which is considered to be one of the best ever produced in the country and includes such players as Glódís Perla Viggósdóttir, Elín Metta Jensen, Sandra María Jessen, Sava Rós Guðmundsdóttir and Telma Hjaltalín Þrastardóttir. A tall and strong central defender, she is expected to become the leader of this young and inexperienced team. Hildigunnur Ýr Benediktsdóttir (17), a name to remember though difficult. Only 16 years old, she played 10 games and scored 7 goals last year, not bad for a youngster. Jasmín Erla Ingadóttur (22), a box to box midfielder who scores on a regular basis. Should be in form after a brief loan spell in Cyprus this winter. Thelma Hjaltalín Þrastardóttir (25), a player who has suffered one horrible injury after another. Was once considered to be one of the most promising players in Iceland but after tearing her ACL on three occasions it is a miracle that she is expected to return to the field again this year.\n\nÞór/KA\n\nFounded: 1999\n\nChampions: 2012 and 2017\n\nLast year result: 4th place\n\nCoach: Andri Hjörvar Albertsson\n\nMy prediction: 6th place\n\nAbout the team: Akureyri, sometimes referred to as the capital of the north, is the largest town in Iceland outside of the capital area with around 19.000 residents. The town is known for its love of sports. It is for example the only town in Iceland outside of Reykjavík to have an ice hockey team. The largest sports clubs in Akureyri are KA (Knattspyrnufélag Akureyrar) and Þór. In 1999 the two clubs decided to merge their women's football teams into one. This proved successful and in 2012 they won their first title. Since then Akureyri has been a force to be reckoned with in the Icelandic women's league. This year things are probably gonna be a little different. Many of the key players who won the title for Akureyri in 2017 are now gone. Players like Sandra Stephany Mayor, Bianca Sierra, Sandra María Jessen and Anna Rakel Pétursdóttir are all now playing professionally elsewhere. Akureyri therefore have had to rely on young players from their youth academy's. Thankfully for them there is plenty of talent in the north. Nonetheless, a team can only handle so much hemorrhage and it is doubtful that Akureyri can make it to the top half of the league this year.\n\nBest player: Arna Sif Ásgrímsdóttir, a tall and powerful central defender. A true leader of the team and a monster inside the penalty box. You have a corner kick? Forget about it, Arna reigns supreme. With 12 caps and one goal for the national team this 28 year old has been one of the most reliably defenders in the Icelandic league. Had a brief stint with Verona in Italy but cut it short when the team did not honor its contract with the player.\n\nOther players to whatch: Karen María Sigurgeirsdóttir (19) is the most promising prospect to come out of Akureyri in the last five years or so. Quick with good technique and a good shot Karen can proof a handful for any defender in any league. Plays as a striker or as a winger. Hulda Ósk Jónsdóttir (23), a winger who can outrun most players in the Icelandic league and can score goals on a occasion. Tall and physically strong. Lára Einarsdóttir, though only 25 years old is one of the most experienced players in the team. Though as nails, Lára is good at intercepting passes and turn a defensive play into a offensive one.\n\nKR Reykjavík\n\nFounded: 1899\n\nIcelandic champions: 1993, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2002 and 2003\n\nLast years result: 7th place\n\nCoach: Jóhannes Karl Sigursteinsson\n\nMy prediction: 5th place\n\nAbout the team: KR Reykjavík is the oldest football team in Iceland, founded in 1899. It is also one of the most successful teams in the history of women's football in Iceland. KR won its last title in 2003 but since 2008 has seen a steady decline. This has probably most to do with management as KR has wanted to use their resources to fund the men's football team and their men's basketball team, but both teams have been very successful in recent years. This year, KR has decided to pour money into the women's team in hope of returning to former glory. It's probably gonna take time for the team to gel together but the talent is obvious to anyone in Iceland. A good blend of young and old players with many international caps in their resume. This year is gonna be interesting for \"west town\" of Reykjavík.\n\nBest player: Katrín Ásbjörnsdóttir (27), a player who grew up in \"west town\" and was considered at the time one the most promising player to ever come through the youth academy. Tall, fast and with great skills, she plays as a attacking midfielder but can also be utilized as a striker. Katrín has 19 caps for Iceland and one goal. She has played 136 games in the Icelandic top league and scored 61 goals. Katrín moved from KR to Þór/KA in 2012 and became an Icelandic champion that year. She also won the title with Stjarnan in 2016. Her best year though was probably in 2017 when she scored 7 goals in the UEFA Women's Champions League finishing 3rd, only behind Ada Hegerberg and Pernilla Harder, as that years top goalscorer. Katrín did not play last year due to pregnancy but many are looking forward to see her again in the black and white stripes.\n\nOther players to watch: Katrín Ómarsdóttir (33). Once a regular in the Icelandic national team (69 caps and 10 goals). At a relatively young age Katrín left Iceland to become a professional player in Europe where she for example played for Liverpool and Doncaster Rovers. A natural talent if there ever was one, but sometimes seems to lack the drive to push herself further which has frustrated some of her coaches from what I have gathered. Þórdís Hrönn Sigfúsdóttir (27), the fastest player in the team, she plays on the flanks and earned her first caps for Iceland last year. Joined KR from Þór/KA. Lára Kristín Pedersen (26), a holding midfielder, one of best in the country and maybe the player KR needed to tie their midfield together. Also joined KR from Þór/KA. Ana Victoria Cate (29), an american born Nicaraguan international. Plays as a midfielder or right back. A quick player who loves to run forward and score occasional goals but sometimes leaves her defense a little bit exposed while doing so. Probably no one in better physical form as she also works as a physical trainer for KR.\n\nFylkir\n\nFounded: 1967\n\nBest result: 5th place 2009, 2010 and 2014\n\nLast years result: 6th place\n\nCoach: Kjartan Stefánsson\n\nMy prediction: 4th place\n\nAbout the team: From the Reykjavík suburb of Árbær, Fylkir has been in and out of the Úrvalsdeild in the last 15 years or so. Last year they finished 6th which at the time was thought to be a decent result considering that they earned their promotion only a year earlier. Despite losing arguably their best player from last year, Fylkir has acquired a lot of young talent this year, most of whom are currently playing with the under-19 national team. In the preseason they have surprised a lot of people with interesting results (f.ex. beating the champions from last year) and seem to have found something very special. A combination of youth, talent and team spirit. The only problem is that they haven't yet found their goalscorer. Very much looking forward to see how they will fare this summer.\n\nBest Player: Cecilía Rán Rúnarsdóttir (16). Remember this name, she could possibly be the world's most promising goalkeeper. Big words, I know. At 6 ft and 2 in (188 cm), this 16 year old (she will turn 17 in july) has already earned her first cap for Iceland and was huge factor in how well Fylkir did last year. With a better defense in front of her, it's gonna be a difficult task scoring against Fylkir this year.\n\nOther players to watch: As mentioned above, Fylkir has acquired a lot of young talent. Among them are the twin sisters Katla María Þórðardóttir (19) and Íris Una Þórðardóttir, who both play in the defense, Eva Rut Ásþórsdóttir (19), one of the most promising midfielders in Iceland who can play box to box and is also an excellent passer with good vision, and Stefanía Ragnarsdóttir (20) a promising striker. Already in the roster they have Berglind Rós Ágústsdóttir (25) who can both play in the midfield and as a central defender, probably the most important player of the team, and Bryndís Arna Níelsdóttir (17), an attacking midfielder who has a lot of goals in her, another name to remember.\n\nSelfoss\n\nFounded: 1936\n\nBest result: 3rd place 2015 and 2019\n\nLast years result: 3rd place\n\nCoach: Alfreð Elías Jóhannsson\n\nMy prediction: 3rd place\n\nAbout the team: Selfoss is the largest town in the south of Iceland with around 7.000 residents. It's located in the agricultural heartland of Iceland and is famous for its dairy products. The town has also produced many fine athletes throughout the years. Selfoss seemed to be on its way to become a powerhouse in Icelandic women's football five years ago, but after losing a few key players, the team was relegated in 2016. After only a year in the 1. division Selfoss began to rebuild their team and were the dark horse last year finishing 3rd. They also won the cup for the first time. With arguably the best coach in the league, Selfoss is now looking for their first title and have acquired some of the biggest talents in Icelandic football in order to do so. Could this be the year that the south will win its first title?\n\nBest player: Without a doubt, the biggest news this year in Icelandic women's football, was the decision of Dagný Brynjarsdóttir (29) to leave the Portland Thorns and join Selfoss. Dagný is the unicorn of Icelandic football. Standing at 5 ft and 11 in (180 cm) she is fast, tall, strong with a good header and always seems to be in the right place at the right time (at least when she plays for the Icelandic national team. Having earned 88 caps for Iceland and scoring 26 goals there are only two other players who have scored more goals than her in the blue jersey. The success of Selfoss depends a lot on what form Dagný is in.\n\nOther players to watch: Anna Björk Kristjánsdóttir (31), joined Selfoss from PSV Eindhoven. Tall and strong central midfielder who is gonna add a lot of experience to the defense. Has 43 caps for Iceland. Barbára Sól Gísladóttir (19), plays as a winger or right back but can also play in the midfield. A future regular for the Icelandic national team, fast and strong, Barbára can in fact out muscle just about anyone. She also scores goals. Hólmfríður Magnúsdóttir (36), one of the best players to ever play for Iceland. Hólmfríður has 112 caps for Iceland and 37 goals. Only Margrét Lára Viðarsdóttir has scored more goals than Hólmfríður. \"Fríða\" started her career with KR before moving to Sweden where she played for Kristianstad. She also had a brief spell in the US, playing for Philadelphia Independence from 2010 to 2011. Last year her goal against KR awarded Selfoss their first cup. Clara Sigurðardóttir (18), came from ÍBV prior to the season, this diminutive player was thought to be the most promising player in Iceland two years ago and has a lot to proof.\n\nBreiðablik\n\nFounded: 1950\n\nChampions: 1977, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2015 and 2018\n\nLast years result: 2nd place\n\nCoach: Þorsteinn H. Halldórsson\n\nMy prediction: 2nd place\n\nAbout the team: The most successful team in women's football in Iceland, many are expecting them to claim the title this year and not without a reason. The team is stacked with talent. Hailing from the municipality of Kópavogur which is part of the greater Reykjavík city area, Breiðablik women's team has proved to be much more successful that their men's team. Breiðablik dominated the league in the early 80's and the early 90's. Ásta B. Gunnlaugsdóttir (26 caps and 8 goals), Ásthildur Helgadóttir (69 caps, 21 goal), Þóra B. Helgadóttir (108 caps, 1 goal and sister of Ásthildur) and Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir (131 caps, 20 goals) are just few of the many internationals who have played for Breiðbalik. Last year the team finished 2nd without losing a single match. Three draws meant that only two points was the difference between them and the current titleholders. Breiðblik did also well in the Champions league last year, reaching the round of 16 where it was outclassed by Paris St. Germain. This year, Breiðablik has added a few good players to an already stacked team.\n\nBest player: Berglind Björg Þorvaldsdóttir (28), the topgoalscorer in 2019 and 2018. Berglind has been very consisted in front of the goal throughout her career (125 goals in 188 games in the Icelandic league) and has one of the best headers in the game. Berglind joined AC Milan in January and before the league was shut down in march managed to score 5 goals in 5 games. For some reason Berglind has never repeated her form on the international level, scoring only 4 goals in 44 games. Still no one in Iceland doubts her capabilities to score goals.\n\nOther players to watch: Agla María Albertsdóttir (21), aged only 18 years old this pacey winger started against France in the last Euros. Hasn't really lived up to her potential playing for the Icelandic national team but hopefully that will change soon. Alexandra Jóhannsdóttir (20), an attacking midfielder. Alexandra scored 11 goals in 18 games from the midfield last year and is likely to cement her place in the starting lineup of the Icelandic national team this year. Many consider her to be the successor of Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir which is kind of fitting as Sara Björk trained her at Haukar when Alexandra was a kid. Sveindís Jane Jónsdóttir (19), is considered by many the most exciting talent in league, tall, extremely fast Jónsdóttir is a goalscoring machine. Just this year she scored a hat trick for the Icelandic u-19 national team in a 4-1 victory over Switzerland (in the same tournament Iceland won Italy 7-1 and Germany 2-0). Her secret weapon are her long throws, which have to be seen to be believed. Rakel Hönnudóttir (32), joined Breiðablik from Reading. A versatile player who can really play any position on the field except maybe goalkeeper. A technically gifted player she is going to add a lot of experience to the team. Has 102 caps for Iceland and 9 goals. Karólína Lea Vilhjálmsdóttir (19), tall, fast with good technique she might be the most technically gifted player in Iceland today and a future star for the Icelandic national team. Áslaug Munda Gunnlaugsdóttir (19), probably the fastest player in the entire league, Áslaug and Sveindís have caught the attention of teams such as Paris St. Germain which offered them to train with the team in January. Plays as a Left back or a Winger. She will own the former position for the Icelandic national team in the years to come. Honorable mentions: Andrea Rán Hauksdóttir (24), Hildur Antonsdóttir (25), Selma Sól Magnúsdóttir (22) and Heiðdís Lillýjardóttir (24)."
