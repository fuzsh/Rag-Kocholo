        "text": "The association between major birth defects and preterm birth.\n\nPubMed\n\nHonein, Margaret A; Kirby, Russell S; Meyer, Robert E; Xing, Jian; Skerrette, Nyasha I; Yuskiv, Nataliya; Marengo, Lisa; Petrini, Joann R; Davidoff, Michael J; Mai, Cara T; Druschel, Charlotte M; Viner-Brown, Samara; Sever, Lowell E\n\n2009-03-01\n\nTo evaluate the association between preterm birth and major birth defects by maternal and infant characteristics and specific types of birth defects. We pooled data for 1995-2000 from 13 states with population-based birth defects surveillance systems, representing about 30% of all U.S. births. Analyses were limited to singleton, live births from 24-44 weeks gestational age. Overall, birth defects were more than twice as common among preterm births (24-36 weeks) compared with term births (37-41 weeks gestation) (prevalence ratio [PR] = 2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.62-2.68), and approximately 8% of preterm births had a birth defect. Birth defects were over five times more likely among very preterm births (24-31 weeks gestation) compared with term births (PR = 5.25, 95% CI 5.15-5.35), with about 16% of very preterm births having a birth defect. Defects most strongly associated with very preterm birth included central nervous system defects (PR = 16.23, 95% CI 15.49-17.00) and cardiovascular defects (PR = 9.29, 95% CI 9.03-9.56). Birth defects contribute to the occurrence of preterm birth. Research to identify shared causal pathways and risk factors could suggest appropriate interventions to reduce both preterm birth and birth defects.\n\nShared molecular and cellular mechanisms of premature ageing and ageing-associated diseases.\n\nPubMed\n\nKubben, Nard; Misteli, Tom\n\n2017-10-01\n\nAgeing is the predominant risk factor for many common diseases. Human premature ageing diseases are powerful model systems to identify and characterize cellular mechanisms that underpin physiological ageing. Their study also leads to a better understanding of the causes, drivers and potential therapeutic strategies of common diseases associated with ageing, including neurological disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Using the rare premature ageing disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome as a paradigm, we discuss here the shared mechanisms between premature ageing and ageing-associated diseases, including defects in genetic, epigenetic and metabolic pathways; mitochondrial and protein homeostasis; cell cycle; and stem cell-regenerative capacity.\n\nDefective Wound-healing in Aging Gingival Tissue.\n\nPubMed\n\nCÃ¡ceres, M; Oyarzun, A; Smith, P C\n\n2014-07-01\n\nAging may negatively affect gingival wound-healing. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. The present study examined the cellular responses associated with gingival wound-healing in aging. Primary cultures of human gingival fibroblasts were obtained from healthy young and aged donors for the analysis of cell proliferation, cell invasion, myofibroblastic differentiation, and collagen gel remodeling. Serum from young and old rats was used to stimulate cell migration. Gingival repair was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats of different ages. Data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, with a p value of .05. Fibroblasts from aged donors showed a significant decrease in cell proliferation, migration, Rac activation, and collagen remodeling when compared with young fibroblasts. Serum from young rats induced higher cell migration when compared with serum from old rats. After TGF-beta1 stimulation, both young and old fibroblasts demonstrated increased levels of alpha-SMA. However, alpha-SMA was incorporated into actin stress fibers in young but not in old fibroblasts. After 7 days of repair, a significant delay in gingival wound-healing was observed in old rats. The present study suggests that cell migration, myofibroblastic differentiation, collagen gel remodeling, and proliferation are decreased in aged fibroblasts. In addition, altered cell migration in wound-healing may be attributable not only to cellular defects but also to changes in serum factors associated with the senescence process.

However, the precise immunological mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate an increase in the ratio of inhibitory T follicular regulatory (TFR) cells to stimulatory T follicular helper (TFH) cells in aged mice. Aged TFH and TFR cells are phenotypically distinct from those in young mice, exhibiting increased programmed cell death protein-1 expression but decreased ICOS expression. Aged TFH cells exhibit defective antigen-specific responses, and programmed cell death protein-ligand 1 blockade can partially rescue TFH cell function. In contrast, young and aged TFR cells have similar suppressive capacity on a per-cell basis in vitro and in vivo. Together, these studies reveal mechanisms contributing to defective humoral immunity in aging: an increase in suppressive TFR cells combined with impaired function of aged TFH cells results in reduced T-cell-dependent antibody responses in aged mice.

Although alterations in the lymphoid progenitor content of aged mouse bone marrow (BM) have been described, irradiation-reconstitution experiments have failed to reveal defects in T-lineage potential of BM hematopoietic progenitors or purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from aged mice. Here, we assessed T-progenitor potential in unmanipulated recipient mice without conditioning irradiation. T-progenitor potential was reduced in aged BM compared with young BM, and this reduction was apparent at the earliest stages of intrathymic differentiation. Further, enriched populations of aged HSCs or multipotent progenitors (MPPs) gave rise to fewer T-lineage cells than their young counterparts. Whereas the T-precursor frequency within the MPP pool was unchanged, there was a 4-fold decline in T-precursor frequency within the HSC pool. In addition, among the T-competent HSC clones, there were fewer highly proliferative clones in the aged HSC pool than in the young HSC pool. These results identify T-compromised aged HSCs and define the nature and cellular sites of prethymic, age-related defects in T-lineage differentiation potential.

We recently reported that calcium augments the expression of chemokine receptor CXCR4 and enhances the angiogenic potential of bone marrow derived cells (BMCs). Neovascularization is impaired by aging therefore we suggested that aging may cause defects of CXCR4 expression and cellular responses to calcium. Indeed we found that both the basal and calcium-induced surface expression of CXCR4 on BMCs was significantly reduced in 25-month-old mice compared with 2-month-old mice. Reduced Ca-induced CXCR4 expression in BMC from aged mice was associated with defective calcium influx. Diminished CXCR4 surface expression in BMC from aged mice correlated with diminished neovascularization in an ischemic hindlimb model with less accumulation of CD34+ progenitor cells in the ischemic muscle with or without local overexpression of SDF-1. Intravenous injection of BMCs from old mice homed less efficiently to ischemic muscle and stimulated significantly less neovascularization compared with the BMCs from young mice. Transplantation of old BMCs into young mice did not reconstitute CXCR4 functions suggesting that the defects were not reversible by changing the environment. We conclude that defects of basal and calcium-regulated functions of the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis in BMCs contribute significantly to the age-related loss of vasculogenic responses.

By STE, LV global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) was lower in HTx. PET showed no transient or chronic ischemia in 83 of 115 HTx (73%). Fixed perfusion defects were observed in 17% of HTx and reversible ischemia in 10%. Significant coronary stenosis was observed only in 10 cases. GLS was independently associated with age at HTx and fixed perfusion defects (HR 0.41; P<.001). Such relationships underline STE ability to early identify HTx pts with subclinical myocardial dysfunction during long-term follow-up.

We examined associations between thyroid medications and individual birth defects using data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS). The NBDPS is a multisite, population-based, case-control study that included pregnancies with estimated delivery dates from 1997 to 2011. We analyzed self-reported thyroid medication use from mothers of 31,409 birth defect cases and 11,536 unaffected controls. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using logistic regression for birth defects with five or more exposed cases, controlling for maternal age, race/ethnicity, and study center. Crude ORs and exact 95% CIs were estimated for defects with 3 to 4 exposed cases. Thyroid hormone was used by 738 (2.3%) case and 237 (2.1%) control mothers, and was associated with anencephaly (OR = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.03-2.73), holoprosencephaly (OR = 2.48; 95% CI, 1.13-5.44), hydrocephaly (1.77; 95% CI, 1.07-2.95) and small intestinal atresia (OR = 1.81; 95% CI, 1.04-3.15). Anti-thyroid medication was used by 34 (0.1%) case and 10 (<0.1%) control mothers, and was associated with aortic valve stenosis (OR = 6.91; 95% CI, 1.21-27.0). While new associations were identified, our findings are relatively consistent with previous NBDPS analyses. Our findings suggest thyroid medication use is not associated with most birth defects studied in the NBDPS, but may be associated with some specific birth defects. These results should not be interpreted to suggest that medications used to treat thyroid disease are teratogens, as the observed associations may reflect effects of the underlying thyroid disease.

A cross-sectional study with a randomised representative sample was carried out with 1101 children aged 2-5 years enrolled in public preschools (50% prevalence of DDE in primary teeth, a standard error of 3%, and a confidence level of 95%). Three calibrated dentists (KÂ >Â 0.62) performed clinical examination. Data collected were: sex, age, DDE (Modified DDE Index) and dental caries (WHO). Descriptive analysis, Chi-square test and multinomial logistic regression were applied for data analysis. Among children, 565 (51.3%) were boys; mean age was 3.7 (Â±0.9 years). The prevalence of enamel defect was 39.1%; the prevalence of diffuse opacities, demarcated opacities and enamel hypoplasia was 25.3, 19.1 and 6.1%, respectively. The prevalence of dental caries was 31.0%, with mean def-t 1.14 (Â±2.44). Primary teeth with enamel hypoplasia had three times the odds of having dental caries than those with absence of enamel defects (ORÂ =Â 3.10; 95% CI: 1.91, 5.01). The presence of enamel defects was moderate and associated with dental caries.\n\nPhotographic guide of selected external defect indicators and associated internal defects in northern red oak\n\nTreesearch\n\nEverette D.

Although several groups have documented age-dependent defects in adaptive immune priming, the deficits that occur prior to antigen encounter remain largely unexplored. Herein, we identify novel mechanisms for compromised adaptive immunity that occurs with aging in the context of infection with West Nile virus (WNV), an encephalitic flavivirus that preferentially causes disease in the elderly. An impaired IgM and IgG response and enhanced vulnerability to WNV infection during aging was linked to delayed germinal center formation in the draining lymph node (DLN). Adoptive transfer studies and two-photon intravital microscopy revealed a decreased trafficking capacity of donor naÃ¯ve CD4+ T cells from old mice, which manifested as impaired T cell diapedesis at high endothelial venules and reduced cell motility within DLN prior to antigen encounter. Furthermore, leukocyte accumulation in the DLN within the first few days of WNV infection or antigen-adjuvant administration was diminished more generally in old mice and associated with a second aging-related defect in local cytokine and chemokine production. Thus, age-dependent cell-intrinsic and environmental defects in the DLN result in delayed immune cell recruitment and antigen recognition. These deficits compromise priming of early adaptive immune responses and likely contribute to the susceptibility of old animals to acute WNV infection.\n\nBDA: A novel method for identifying defects in body-centered cubic crystals.\n\nPubMed\n\nMÃ¶ller, Johannes J; Bitzek, Erik\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe accurate and fast identification of crystallographic defects plays a key role for the analysis of atomistic simulation output data. For face-centered cubic (fcc) metals, most existing structure analysis tools allow for the direct distinction of common defects, such as stacking faults or certain low-index surfaces. For body-centered cubic (bcc) metals, on the other hand, a robust way to identify such defects is currently not easily available. We therefore introduce a new method for analyzing atomistic configurations of bcc metals, the BCC Defect Analysis (BDA). It uses existing structure analysis algorithms and combines their results to uniquely distinguish between typical defects in bcc metals. In essence, the BDA method offers the following features:â¢Identification of typical defect structures in bcc metals.â¢Reduction of erroneously identified defects by iterative comparison to the defects in the atom's neighborhood.â¢Availability as ready-to-use Python script for the widespread visualization tool OVITO [http://ovito.org].\n\nIdentifying Defects with Guided Algorithms in Bragg Coherent Diffractive Imaging\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nUlvestad, A.; Nashed, Y.; Beutier, G.; ...\n\n2017-08-30\n\nIn this study, crystallographic defects such as dislocations can significantly alter material properties and functionality.

The declining functioning of tissues and organs during aging can lead to the increased risk of succumbing to aging-associated diseases. Congenital syndromes that are caused by heritable mutations in DNA repair pathways lead to cancer susceptibility and accelerated aging, thus underlining the importance of genome maintenance for withstanding aging. High-throughput mass-spectrometry-based approaches have recently contributed to identifying signalling response networks and gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the physiological adaptations occurring upon unrepaired DNA damage. The insulin-like signalling pathway has been implicated in a DNA damage response (DDR) network that includes epidermal growth factor (EGF)-, AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPK)- and the target of rapamycin (TOR)-like signalling pathways, which are known regulators of growth, metabolism, and stress responses. The same pathways, together with the autophagy-mediated proteostatic response and the decline in energy metabolism have also been found to be similarly regulated during natural aging, suggesting striking parallels in the physiological adaptation upon persistent DNA damage due to DNA repair defects and long-term low-level DNA damage accumulation occurring during natural aging. These insights will be an important starting point to study the interplay between signalling networks involved in progeroid syndromes that are caused by DNA repair deficiencies and to gain new understanding of the consequences of DNA damage in the aging process.\n\nCan Anal Sphincter Defects Be Identified by Palpation?\n\nPubMed\n\nShek, Ka Lai; Atan, Ixora Kamisan; Dietz, Hans Peter\n\nThe aim of this study was to correlate clinical findings of anal sphincter defects and function with a sonographic diagnosis of significant sphincter defects. This is an observational cross-sectional study on women seen 6 to 10 weeks after primary repair of obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIs). All patients underwent a standardized interview including the St Mark incontinence score, a digital rectal examination, and 3-/4-dimensional transperineal ultrasound imaging. Two hundred forty-five patients were seen after primary repair of OASIs. Mean age was 29 (17-43) years. They were assessed at a median of 58 (15-278) days postpartum. One hundred fifty-seven (64%) delivered normal vaginally, 72 (29%) delivered by vacuum, and 16 (7%) delivered by forceps. A comparison of external anal sphincter (EAS) and internal anal sphincter ultrasound volume data and palpation was possible in 220 and 212 cases, respectively. Sphincter defects at rest and on contraction were both detected clinically in 17 patients. Significant abnormalities of the EAS were diagnosed on tomographic ultrasound imaging in 99 cases (45%), and significant abnormalities of the internal anal sphincter were diagnosed in 113 cases (53%). Agreement between digital and sonographic findings of sphincter defect was poor (k = 0.03-0.08). Women with significant EAS defects on ultrasound were found to have a lower resistance to digital insertion (P = 0.018) and maximum anal squeeze (P = 0.009) on a 6-point scale. The difference was however small. Digital rectal examination does not seem to be sufficiently sensitive to diagnose residual sphincter defects after primary repair of OASIs. Imaging is required for the evaluation of sphincter anatomy after repair.\n\nDwarfism and age-associated spinal degeneration of heterozygote cmd mice defective inâaggrecan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWatanabe, Hideto; Nakata, Ken; Kimata, Koji; Nakanishi, Isao; Yamada, Yoshihiko\n\n1997-01-01\n\nMouse cartilage matrix deficiency (cmd) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a genetic defect of aggrecan, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in cartilage. The homozygotes (â/â) are characterized by cleft palate and short limbs, tail, and snout. They die just after birth because of respiratory failure, and the heterozygotes (+/â) appear normal at birth. Here we report that the heterozygotes show dwarfism and develop spinal misalignment with age. Within 19 months of age, they exhibit spastic gait caused by misalignment of the cervical spine and die because of starvation. Histological examination revealed a high incidence of herniation and degeneration of vertebral discs. Electron microscopy showed a degeneration of disc chondrocytes in the heterozygotes. These findings may facilitate the identification of mutations in humans predisposed to spinal degeneration.

Here, we have shown that B cell progenitors in old mice exhibit marked signaling, gene expression, and metabolic defects. Moreover, B cell progenitors that developed from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transferred from young mice into aged animals exhibited similar fitness defects. We further demonstrated that ectopic expression of the oncogenes BCR-ABL, NRAS(V12), or Myc restored B cell progenitor fitness, leading to selection for oncogenically initiated cells and leukemogenesis specifically in the context of an aged hematopoietic system. Aging was associated with increased inflammation in the BM microenvironment, and induction of inflammation in young mice phenocopied aging-associated B lymphopoiesis. Conversely, a reduction of inflammation in aged mice via transgenic expression of Î±-1-antitrypsin or IL-37 preserved the function of B cell progenitors and prevented NRAS(V12)-mediated oncogenesis. We conclude that chronic inflammatory microenvironments in old age lead to reductions in the fitness of B cell progenitor populations. This reduced progenitor pool fitness engenders selection for cells harboring oncogenic mutations, in part due to their ability to correct aging-associated functional defects. Thus, modulation of inflammation--a common feature of aging--has the potential to limit aging-associated oncogenesis.\n\nPercutaneous treatment of atrial septal defects, muscular ventricular septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus in infants under one year of age.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrada, Fredy; Mortera, Carlos; Bartrons, Joaquim; Rissech, Miguel; JimÃ©nez, Lorenzo; Carretero, Juan; Llevadias, Judit; Araica, Mireya\n\n2009-09-01\n\nAmplatzer devices are used for the percutaneous closure of ostium secundum atrial septal defects, muscular ventricular septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus. However, very little experience has been gained in using these devices in infants under 1 year of age. Between January 2001 and January 2008, 22 symptomatic infants aged under 1 year underwent percutaneous treatment: three had an ostium secundum atrial septal defect, 15 had patent ductus arteriosus, and four had a muscular ventricular septal defect. All the procedures were completed successfully. No immediate or medium-term complications were observed. Closure of these types of defect using an Amplatzer device in infants under 1 year of age, who would otherwise require surgery, is a safe and effective procedure.\n\nKey role of T cell defects in age-related vulnerability to West Nile virus.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrien, James D; Uhrlaub, Jennifer L; Hirsch, Alec; Wiley, Clayton A; Nikolich-Zugich, Janko\n\n2009-11-23\n\nWest Nile virus (WNV) infection causes a life-threatening meningoencephalitis that becomes increasingly more prevalent over the age of 50 and is 40-50x more prevalent in people over the age of 70, compared with adults under the age of 40. In a mouse model of age-related vulnerability to WNV, we demonstrate that death correlates with increased viral titers in the brain and that this loss of virus control with age was the result of defects in the CD4 and CD8 T cell response against WNV. Specific age-related defects in T cell responses against dominant WNV epitopes were detected at the level of cytokine and lytic granule production, each of which are essential for resistance against WNV, and in the ability to generate multifunctional anti-WNV effector T cells, which are believed to be critical for robust antiviral immunity. In contrast, at the peak of the response, old and adult T cells exhibited superimposable peptide sensitivity. Most importantly, although the adult CD4 or CD8 T cells readily protected immunodeficient mice upon adoptive transfer, old T cells of either subset were unable to provide WNV-specific protection. Consistent with a profound qualitative and quantitative defect in T cell immunity, old brains contained at least 12x fewer total effector CD8 T cells compared with adult mice at the peak of brain infection. These findings identify potential targets for immunomodulation and treatment to combat lethal WNV infection in the elderly.\n\nOmics Approaches for Identifying Physiological Adaptations to Genome Instability in Aging\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEdifizi, Diletta; Schumacher, BjÃ¶rn\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDNA damage causally contributes to aging and age-related diseases. The declining functioning of tissues and organs during aging can lead to the increased risk of succumbing to aging-associated diseases. Congenital syndromes that are caused by heritable mutations in DNA repair pathways lead to cancer susceptibility and accelerated aging, thus underlining the importance of genome maintenance for withstanding aging. High-throughput mass-spectrometry-based approaches have recently contributed to identifying signalling response networks and gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the physiological adaptations occurring upon unrepaired DNA damage. The insulin-like signalling pathway has been implicated in a DNA damage response (DDR) network that includes epidermal growth factor (EGF)-, AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPK)- and the target of rapamycin (TOR)-like signalling pathways, which are known regulators of growth, metabolism, and stress responses. The same pathways, together with the autophagy-mediated proteostatic response and the decline in energy metabolism have also been found to be similarly regulated during natural aging, suggesting striking parallels in the physiological adaptation upon persistent DNA damage due to DNA repair defects and long-term low-level DNA damage accumulation occurring during natural aging. These insights will be an important starting point to study the interplay between signalling networks involved in progeroid syndromes that are caused by DNA repair deficiencies and to gain new understanding of the consequences of DNA damage in the aging process.

An improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive age-associated neurogenic deficiency could lead to the development of strategies to alleviate cognitive impairment and facilitate neuroregeneration. An essential step towards this aim is to investigate the molecular changes that occur in NSPC aging on a genomewide scale. In this study, we compare the transcriptional, histone methylation and DNA methylation signatures of NSPCs derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of young adult (3Â months old) and aged (18Â months old) mice. Surprisingly, the transcriptional and epigenomic profiles of SVZ-derived NSPCs are largely unchanged in aged cells. Despite the global similarities, we detect robust age-dependent changes at several hundred genes and regulatory elements, thereby identifying putative regulators of neurogenic decline. Within this list, the homeobox gene Dbx2 is upregulated inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo, and its promoter region has altered histone and DNA methylation levels, in aged NSPCs. Using functional inÂ vitro assays, we show that elevated Dbx2 expression in young adult NSPCs promotes age-related phenotypes, including the reduced proliferation of NSPC cultures and the altered transcript levels of age-associated regulators of NSPC proliferation and differentiation. Depleting Dbx2 in aged NSPCs caused the reverse gene expression changes. Taken together, these results provide new insights into the molecular programmes that are affected during mouse NSPC aging, and uncover a new functional role for Dbx2 in promoting age-related neurogenic decline.

Mutant him-19(jf6) animals show a reduction in pairing of homologous chromosomes and subsequent bivalent formation. Consistently, synaptonemal complex formation is spatially restricted and possibly involves nonhomologous chromosomes. Also, foci of the recombination protein RAD-51 occur delayed or cease altogether. Ultimately, mutation of him-19 leads to chromosome missegregation and reduced offspring viability. The observed defects suggest that HIM-19 is important for both homology recognition and formation of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks. It therefore seems to be engaged in an early meiotic event, resembling in this respect the regulator kinase CHK-2. Most astonishingly, him-19(jf6) hermaphrodites display worsening of phenotypes with increasing age, whereas defects are more severe in female than in male meiosis. This finding is consistent with depletion of a him-19-dependent factor during the production of oocytes.

However, our understanding of early events in prohormone maturation in the ER remains incomplete. Highlighting the significance of this gap in knowledge, a single POMC cysteine-to-phenylalanine mutation at position 28 (POMC-C28F) is defective for ER processing and causes early onset obesity in a dominant-negative manner in humans through an unclear mechanism. Here, we report a pathologically important role of Sel1L-Hrd1, the protein complex of ER-associated degradation (ERAD), within POMC neurons. Mice with POMC neuronâspecific Sel1L deficiency developed age-associated obesity due, at least in part, to the ER retention of POMC that led to hyperphagia. The Sel1L-Hrd1 complex targets a fraction of nascent POMC molecules for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, preventing accumulation of misfolded and aggregated POMC, thereby ensuring that another fraction of POMC can undergo normal posttranslational processing and trafficking for secretion. Moreover, we found that the disease-associated POMC-C28F mutant evades ERAD and becomes aggregated due to the presence of a highly reactive unpaired cysteine thiol at position 50. Thus, this study not only identifies ERAD as an important mechanism regulating POMC maturation within the ER, but also provides insights into the pathogenesis of monogenic obesity associated with defective prohormone folding.

Studies have reported a potential association between developmental defects enamel (DDE) and dental caries occurrence. We investigated the association between DDE and caries in permanent dentition of children and teenagers. A systematic review was carried out using four databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and Science Direct), which were searched from their earliest records until December 31, 2014. Population-based studies assessing differences in dental caries experience according to the presence of enamel defects (and their types) were included. PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews were followed. Meta-analysis was performed to assess the pooled effect, and meta-regression was carried out to identify heterogeneity sources. From the 2558 initially identified papers, nine studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria after checking the titles, abstracts, references, and complete reading. Seven of them were included in the meta-analysis with random model. A positive association between enamel defects and dental caries was identified; meta-analysis showed that individuals with DDE had higher pooled odds of having dental caries experience [OR 2.21 (95% CI 1.3; 3.54)]. Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that adjustment for sociodemographic factors, countries' socioeconomic status, and bias (quality of studies) explained the high heterogeneity observed. A higher chance of dental caries should be expected among individuals with enamel defects. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Experience with surgical repair is limited, and results vary considerably. Between 1984 and 1996, we repaired 14 consecutive patients with this combination seen in our center. Their ages ranged from 8 months to 21 years (median 7.4 years). Six (42.9%) had Down's syndrome. In eight patients the correct diagnosis was made using echocardiography alone. In the remaining six patients, who had previously-constructed arterial shunts and/or suspected pulmonary arterial stenosis, catheterization and angiocardiography were also performed. The repair consisted of double patch closure of the septal defect, reconstruction of two atrioventricular orifices, and relief of pulmonary stenosis at all levels. In five patients with a hypoplastic pulmonary trunk, a monocusp transannular patch (four patients) or an allograft (one patient) was used for restoration of continuity from the right ventricle to the pulmonary arteries. Patch enlargement of one or both pulmonary arteries was necessary in five patients. One patient (7.1%) died early, and another late. The twelve surviving (85.8%) patients have been followed for 1.2-12.5 years after surgery (median 4.9 years, mean 5.9+/-3.9 years). During the follow-up, reoperation was necessary for repair of residual ventricular septal defect and pulmonary regurgitation in two patients, and closure of an atrial septal defect and alteration to left atrioventricular valvar regurgitation in one patient. Seven patients are in class I of the New York Heart Association, four in class II, and one in class III. Tetralogy of Fallot associated with atrioventricular septal defect can be corrected with low mortality and good long-term results. Residual lesions, however, have a tendency to progress, especially when seen in combination. After surgery, all patients need long-term close follow-up.\n\nKlippel-Feil syndrome associated with atrial septal defect.\n\nPubMed\n\nBejiqi, Ramush; Retkoceri, Ragip; Bejiqi, Hana; Zeka, Naim; Maloku, Arlinda; Berisha, Majlinda\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThree major features result from this abnormality: a short neck, a limited range of motion in the neck, and a low hairline at the back of the head. Most affected people have one or two of these characteristic features. Less than half of all individuals with Klippel-Feil syndrome have all three classic features of this condition. The etiology of Klippel-Feil syndrome and its associated conditions is unknown. The syndrome can present with a variety of other clinical syndromes, including fetal alcohol syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, anomalies of the extremities etc. Associated anomalies occur in the auditory system, neural axis, cardiovascular system, and the musculoskeletal system. Cardiovascular anomalies, mainly septal defects, were found in 7 patients in Hensinger's series, with 4 of these individuals requiring corrective surgery. In our case we have had registered a nonrestrictive atrial septal defect and corrective surgical intervention at age 18 months in the Santa Rosa Children's Hospital (USA) has been done successfully. Careful examinations of specialist exclude anomalies in other organs and systems. Radiographs and MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine are obtained and other anomalies have been excluded.\n\nMediation analysis of gestational age, congenital heart defects, and infant birth-weight.\n\nPubMed\n\nWogu, Adane F; Loffredo, Christopher A; Bebu, Ionut; Luta, George\n\n2014-12-17\n\nIn this study we assessed the mediation role of the gestational age on the effect of the infant's congenital heart defects (CHD) on birth-weight. We used secondary data from the Baltimore-Washington Infant Study (1981-1989). Mediation analysis was employed to investigate whether gestational age acted as a mediator of the association between CHD and reduced birth-weight. We estimated the mediated effect, the mediation proportion, and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using several methods. There were 3362 CHD cases and 3564 controls in the dataset with mean birth-weight of 3071 (SDâ=â729) and 3353 (SDâ=â603) grams, respectively; the mean gestational age was 38.9 (SDâ=â2.7) and 39.6 (SDâ=â2.2) weeks, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, the estimated mediated effect by gestational age was 113.5 grams (95% CI, 92.4-134.2) and the mediation proportion was 40.7% (95% CI, 34.7%-46.6%), using the bootstrap approach. Gestational age may account for about 41% of the overall effect of heart defects on reduced infant birth-weight. Improved prenatal care and other public health efforts that promote full term delivery, particularly targeting high-risk families and mothers known to be carrying a fetus with CHD, may therefore be expected to improve the birth-weight of these infants and their long term health.\n\nThe Co-Occurrence of Autism and Birth Defects: Prevalence and Risk in a Population-Based Cohort\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSchendel, Diana E.; Autry, Andrew; Wines, Roberta; Moore, Cynthia\n\n2009-01-01\n\nAim: To estimate the prevalence of major birth defects among children with autism, the prevalence of autism in children with birth defects, and the risk for autism associated with having birth defects.

Although older adults are more susceptible to such infections, no study has examined whether aging in humans influences NET formation. We report that TNF-Î±-primed neutrophils generate significantly more NETs than unprimed neutrophils and that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and interleukin-8 (IL-8)-induced NET formation exhibits a significant age-related decline. NET formation requires generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this was also reduced in neutrophils from older donors identifying a mechanism for reduced NET formation. Expression of IL-8 receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2) and the LPS receptor TLR4 was similar on neutrophils from young and old subjects, and neutrophils challenged with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) showed no age-associated differences in ROS or NET production. Taken together, these data suggest a defect in proximal signalling underlies the age-related decline in NET and ROS generation. TNF-Î± priming involves signalling through p38 MAP kinase, but activation kinetics were comparable in neutrophils from young and old donors. In a clinical setting, we assessed the capacity of neutrophils from young and older patients with chronic periodontitis to generate NETs in response to PMA and hypochlorous acid (HOCL). Neutrophil extracellular trap generation to HOCL, but not PMA, was lower in older periodontitis patients but not in comparison with age-matched controls. Impaired NET formation is thus a novel defect of innate immunity in older adults but does not appear to contribute to the increased incidence of periodontitis in older adults.

In response to infection with intracellular microorganisms, old animals mobilize decreased numbers of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells with reduced production of effector molecules and impaired cytolytic activity. However, the CD8+ T cell-intrinsic contribution to, and molecular mechanisms behind, these defects remain unclear. In this review we will discuss the mechanistic contributions of age related changes in the CD8+ T cell pool and the relative roles of intrinsic functional defects in aged CD8+ T cells vs. defects in the aged environment initiating the CD8+ T cell response.

Eosin-nigrosin stained semen smears and evaluation reports of 1642 bull breeding soundness evaluations were procured from 6 veterinary clinics in Alberta. Sperm morphology was determined for at least 100 sperm per bull. The most common defects were detached head [4.86% Â± 5.71%; mean Â± standard deviation (s)], distal midpiece reflex (6.19% Â± 9.13%), and bent tail (1.01% Â± 1.54%). Although breed, age, and SC did not significantly affect the prevalence of head or midpiece defects, morphologically normal or abnormal sperm, tail defects were more prevalent in Angus and Hereford bulls compared with other breeds. Overall, solely on the basis of sperm morphology, 1363 (83.0%) bulls were classified as satisfactory potential breeders and the remainder 279 (17.0%) as unsatisfactory (> 30% abnormal sperm, > 20% defective heads, or both). Although not significantly different, the breed with the highest percentage of satisfactory potential breeders was Limousin (90.6%) and the lowest was Hereford (78.8%). That 17% of bulls subjected to breeding soundness evaluation were designated as unsatisfactory solely on the basis of sperm morphology highlights its importance.

Associated extrapulmonary malformations such as heart defects and chromosomal aberrations are rare. The objective of this study was to describe the natural history, outcome and other associated malformations in fetuses with lung lesions and an associated heart defect. Retrospective analysis of 4 cases of prenatally diagnosed fetal CCAMs and hybrid lesions with an associated heart defect and review of 8 cases in the literature. At a single referral center 1.9% of the fetuses with Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) were diagnosed with an associated heart defect. Seven of the total 12 cases (58%) reviewed had a conotruncal heart abnormality. Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 5 (42%) of the cases. This retrospective review shows that karyotyping in fetal lung lesions with an associated heart defect or isolated large lung lesions is indicated. It also suggests that there is a subpopulation of fetuses with CCAMs who have conotruncal heart defects. This finding may suggest a common genetic background.

METHODS We employed proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE, 3 MeV proton beam) to investigate the concentrations of zinc, copper, calcium, sulfur, chlorine, potassium, titanium, iron and nickel in washed sperm and seminal plasma from non-smoking groups of 10 older men (65â80 years old) and 10 younger men (22â28 years old) who were concurrently assayed for sperm function and genomicly defective sperm. RESULTS The older group showed elevated zinc, copper and calcium in sperm and elevated sulfur in seminal plasma compared with the younger men. The older group also showed reduced motility as well as increased sperm DNA fragmentation, achondroplasia mutations, DNA strand breaks and chromosomal aberrations. Sperm calcium and copper were positively associated with sperm DNA fragmentation (P < 0.03). Seminal sulfur was positively associated with sperm DNA fragmentation and chromosomal aberrations (P < 0.04), and negatively associated with sperm motility (P < 0.05). Sperm calcium was negatively associated with sperm motility, independent of male age (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS We identified major differences in elemental concentrations between sperm and seminal plasma and that higher sperm copper, sulfur and calcium are quantitatively associated with poorer semen quality and increased frequencies of genomic sperm defects.

Recently, two studies reported birth defects after the use of MMI in early pregnancy to affect 2-4% of exposed children, and one study also found birth defects after the use of PTU. On the other hand, some published studies did not find associations between the use of thionamides and birth defects. The methods used in the two positive and the four negative reports are reviewed. The two positive studies included a sufficient number of children exposed to MMI (nâ=â1231 and 1097) to evaluate the studied outcomes, whereas the four negative studies included a much lower number of exposed children (nâ=â73, 108, 30, and 124). Considering PTU, the birth defects observed in one study were in general milder and tended to be diagnosed and registered only when they resulted in complications and led to surgery after one year of age. None of the negative studies has investigated outcomes after one year of age. Studies finding no associations between early pregnancy exposure to antithyroid drugs and birth defects were either not sufficiently powered or did not study outcomes at optimal ages.\n\nGenome-wide linkage analysis of congenital heart defects using MOD score analysis identifies two novel loci\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Congenital heart defects (CHD) is the most common cause of death from a congenital structure abnormality in newborns and is often associated with fetal loss. There are many types of CHD. Human genetic studies have identified genes that are responsible for the inheritance of a particular type of CHD and for some types of CHD previously thought to be sporadic. However, occasionally different members of the same family might have anatomically distinct defects â for instance, one member with atrial septal defect, one with tetralogy of Fallot, and one with ventricular septal defect. Our objective is to identify susceptibility loci for CHD in families affected by distinct defects. The occurrence of these apparently discordant clinical phenotypes within one family might hint at a genetic framework common to most types of CHD. Results We performed a genome-wide linkage analysis using MOD score analysis in families with diverse CHD. Significant linkage was obtained in two regions, at chromosome 15 (15q26.3, Pempiricalâ=â0.0004) and at chromosome 18 (18q21.2, Pempiricalâ=â0.0005). Conclusions In these two novel regions four candidate genes are located: SELS, SNRPA1, and PCSK6 on 15q26.3, and TCF4 on 18q21.2. The new loci reported here have not previously been described in connection with CHD. Although further studies in other cohorts are needed to confirm these findings, the results presented here together with recent insight into how the heart normally develops will improve the understanding of CHD.

A cross-sectional study was undertaken in 1296 school children ages six to 72 years. The DED [FDI; 1982] in both dentitions were identified by means of an oral exam scoring enamel opacities [classified as demarcated or diffused], and enamel hypoplasia. Sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables were collected through a questionnaire. Socioeconomic status (SES) was determined based on the occupation and maximum level of education of parents. Statistical analysis included logistic regression. Mean age of participants was 8.40 +/- 1.68; 51.6% were boys. DED prevalence was 7.5% in the permanent dentition and 10.0% in the primary dentition. The logistic regression model, adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables, showed that for each primary tooth with DED, the odds of observing DED in the permanent dentition increased 7.38 times [95% CI = 1.17-1.64; p < 0.001]. An association between DED presence in both permanent and primary dentitions was observed. Further studies are necessary to fully characterise such relationship.\n\nAge-Related Defects in Erythrocyte 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate Metabolism in Dementia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKaminsky, Yury G.; Reddy, V. Prakash; Ashraf, Ghulam Md; Ahmad, Ausaf; Benberin, Valery V.; Kosenko, Elena A.; Aliev, Gjumrakch\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAlzheimer disease (AD) is the most common dementing illness. Metabolic defects in the brain with aging contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. These changes can be found systematically and thus can be used as potential biomarkers. Erythrocytes (RBCs) are passive âreporter cellsâ that are not well studied in AD. In the present study, we analyzed an array of glycolytic and related enzymes and intermediates in RBCs from patients with AD and non-Alzheimer dementia (NA), age-matched controls (AC) and young adult controls (YC). AD is characterized by higher activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and bisphosphoglycerate mutase and bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase in RBCs. In our study, we observed that glycolytic and related enzymes displayed significantly lower activities in AC. However, similar or significantly higher activities were observed in AD and NA groups as compared to YC group. 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels were significantly decreased in AD and NA patients. The pattern of changes between groups in the above indices strongly correlates with each other. Collectively, our data suggested that AD and NA patients are associated with chronic disturbance of 2,3-DPG metabolism in RBCs. These defects may play a pivotal role in physiological processes, which predispose elderly subjects to AD and NA.

Metabolic defects in the brain with aging contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. These changes can be found systematically and thus can be used as potential biomarkers. Erythrocytes (RBCs) are passive \"reporter cells\" that are not well studied in AD. In the present study, we analyzed an array of glycolytic and related enzymes and intermediates in RBCs from patients with AD and non-Alzheimer dementia (NA), age-matched controls (AC) and young adult controls (YC). AD is characterized by higher activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and bisphosphoglycerate mutase and bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase in RBCs. In our study, we observed that glycolytic and related enzymes displayed significantly lower activities in AC. However, similar or significantly higher activities were observed in AD and NA groups as compared to YC group. 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels were significantly decreased in AD and NA patients.

Previous studies have suggested that the development of OHDs involved a complex interplay between genetic variants and maternal factors. Using the data from 569 OHD case families and 1,644 control families enrolled in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) between 1997 and 2008, we conducted an analysis to investigate the genetic effects of 877 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 60 candidate genes for association with the risk of OHDs, and their interactions with maternal use of folic acid supplements, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Applying log-linear models based on the hybrid design, we identified a SNP in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene (C677T polymorphism) with a main genetic effect on the occurrence of OHDs. In addition, multiple SNPs in betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT and BHMT2) were also identified to be associated with the occurrence of OHDs through significant main infant genetic effects and interaction effects with maternal use of folic acid supplements. We also identified multiple SNPs in glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (GCLC) and DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B) that were associated with elevated risk of OHDs among obese women. Our findings suggested that the risk of OHDs was closely related to a combined effect of variations in genes in the folate, homocysteine, or glutathione/transsulfuration pathways, maternal use of folic acid supplements and pre-pregnancy obesity.

Systems biologyâbased approaches may help to identify key pathways that mediate metal-induced birth defects as well as potential targets for prevention. Objectives: First, we applied a novel computational approach to identify a prioritized biological pathway that associates metals with birth defects. Second, in a laboratory setting, we sought to determine whether inhibition of the identified pathway prevents developmental defects. Methods: Seven environmental metals were selected for inclusion in the computational analysis: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and selenium. We used an in silico strategy to predict genes and pathways associated with both metal exposure and developmental defects. The most significant pathway was identified and tested using an in ovo whole chick embryo culture assay. We further evaluated the role of the pathway as a mediator of metal-induced toxicity using the in vitro midbrain micromass culture assay. Results: The glucocorticoid receptor pathway was computationally predicted to be a key mediator of multiple metal-induced birth defects. In the chick embryo model, structural malformations induced by inorganic arsenic (iAs) were prevented when signaling of the glucocorticoid receptor pathway was inhibited. Further, glucocorticoid receptor inhibition demonstrated partial to complete protection from both iAs- and cadmium-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity in vitro. Conclusions: Our findings highlight a novel approach to computationally identify a targeted biological pathway for examining birth defects prevention.

We utilized data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a large population-based multisite case-control study, to examine associations between maternal reports of periconceptional exposure to secondhand smoke in the household or workplace/school and major birth defects. The multisite National Birth Defects Prevention Study is the largest case-control study of birth defects to date in the United States. We selected cases from birth defect groups having >100 total cases, as well as all nonmalformed controls (10,200), from delivery years 1997 through 2009; 44 birth defects were examined. After excluding cases and controls from multiple births and whose mothers reported active smoking or pregestational diabetes, we analyzed data on periconceptional secondhand smoke exposure-encompassing the period 1 month prior to conception through the first trimester. For the birth defect craniosynostosis, we additionally examined the effect of exposure in the second and third trimesters as well due to the potential sensitivity to teratogens for this defect throughout pregnancy. Covariates included in all final models of birth defects with â¥5 exposed mothers were study site, previous live births, time between estimated date of delivery and interview date, maternal age at estimated date of delivery, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, nativity, household income divided by number of people supported by this income, periconceptional alcohol consumption, and folic acid supplementation. For each birth defect examined, we used logistic regression analyses to estimate both crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for both\n\nAssociation of childhood adiposity measures with adulthood knee cartilage defects and bone marrow lesions: a 25-year cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeng, T; Thayer, S; Venn, A; Wu, F; Cicuttini, F; March, L; Dwyer, T; Halliday, A; Cross, M; Laslett, L L; Jones, G; Ding, C; Antony, B\n\n2018-05-25\n\nTo describe the associations between childhood adiposity measures and adulthood knee cartilage defects and bone marrow lesions (BMLs) measured 25 years later. 327 participants from the Australian Schools Health and Fitness Survey (ASHFS) of 1985 (aged 7-15 years) were followed up 25 years later (aged 31-41 years). Childhood measures (weight, height and skinfolds) were collected in 1985. Body mass index (BMI), overweight status and fat mass were calculated. Participants underwent 1.5Â T knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during 2008-2010, and cartilage defects and BMLs were scored from knee MRI scans. Log binomial regressions were used to examine the associations. Among 327 participants (47.1% females), 21 (6.4%) were overweight in childhood. Childhood adiposity measures were associated with the increased risk of adulthood patellar cartilage defects (Weight relative risk (RR) 1.05/kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.09; BMI 1.10/kg/m 2 , 1.01-1.19; Overweight 2.22/yes, 1.21-4.08; fat mass 1.11/kg, 1.01-1.22), but not tibiofemoral cartilage defects. Childhood adiposity measures were not significantly associated with adulthood knee BMLs except for the association between childhood overweight status and adulthood patellar BMLs (RR 2.87/yes, 95% CI 1.10-7.53). These significant associations persisted after adjustment for corresponding adulthood adiposity measure. Childhood adiposity measures were associated with the increased risk of adulthood patellar cartilage defects and, to a lesser extent, BMLs, independent of adulthood adiposity measures. These results suggest that adiposity in childhood has long-term effects on patellar structural abnormalities in young adults. Copyright Â© 2018 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Here, we demonstrate a selective electrochemical method that labels point defects and makes them easily visible for quantitative analysis. High-quality SWNTs are confirmed to contain one defect per 4 microm on average, with a distribution weighted towards areas of SWNT curvature. Although this defect density compares favourably to high-quality, silicon single-crystals, the presence of a single defect can have tremendous electronic effects in one-dimensional conductors such as SWNTs. We demonstrate a one-to-one correspondence between chemically active point defects and sites of local electronic sensitivity in SWNT circuits, confirming the expectation that individual defects may be critical to understanding and controlling variability, noise and chemical sensitivity in SWNT electronic devices. By varying the SWNT synthesis technique, we further show that the defect spacing can be varied over orders of magnitude. The ability to detect and analyse point defects, especially at very low concentrations, indicates the promise of this technique for quantitative process analysis, especially in nanoelectronics development.\n\nCytoskeletal defects in Bmpr2-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnson, Jennifer A; Hemnes, Anna R; Perrien, Daniel S; Schuster, Manfred; Robinson, Linda J; Gladson, Santhi; Loibner, Hans; Bai, Susan; Blackwell, Tom R; Tada, Yuji; Harral, Julie W; Talati, Megha; Lane, Kirk B; Fagan, Karen A; West, James\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe heritable form of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is typically caused by a mutation in bone morphogenic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2), and mice expressing Bmpr2 mutations develop PAH with features similar to human disease. BMPR2 is known to interact with the cytoskeleton, and human array studies in PAH patients confirm alterations in cytoskeletal pathways. The goal of this study was to evaluate cytoskeletal defects in BMPR2-associated PAH. Expression arrays on our Bmpr2 mutant mouse lungs revealed cytoskeletal defects as a prominent molecular consequence of universal expression of a Bmpr2 mutation (Rosa26-Bmpr2(R899X)). Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells cultured from these mice have histological and functional cytoskeletal defects. Stable transfection of different BMPR2 mutations into pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells revealed that cytoskeletal defects are common to multiple BMPR2 mutations and are associated with activation of the Rho GTPase, Rac1. Rac1 defects are corrected in cell culture and in vivo through administration of exogenous recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2). rhACE2 reverses 77% of gene expression changes in Rosa26-Bmpr2(R899X) transgenic mice, in particular, correcting defects in cytoskeletal function. Administration of rhACE2 to Rosa26-Bmpr2(R899X) mice with established PAH normalizes pulmonary pressures. Together, these findings suggest that cytoskeletal function is central to the development of BMPR2-associated PAH and that intervention against cytoskeletal defects may reverse established disease.\n\nAssociations between toxic and essential trace elements in maternal blood and fetal congenital heart defects.\n\nPubMed\n\nOu, Yanqiu; Bloom, Michael S; Nie, Zhiqiang; Han, Fengzhen; Mai, Jinzhuang; Chen, Jimei; Lin, Shao; Liu, Xiaoqing; Zhuang, Jian\n\n2017-09-01\n\nPrenatal exposure to toxic trace elements, including heavy metals, is an important public health concern. Few studies have assessed if individual and multiple trace elements simultaneously affect cardiac development. The current study evaluated the association between maternal blood lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), and selenium (Se) levels and congenital heart defects (CHDs) in offspring. This hospital-based case-control study included 112 case and 107 control infants. Maternal peripheral blood draw was made during gestational weeks 17-40 and used to determine trace element levels by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess associations and interactions between individual and multiple trace elements and fetal CHDs, adjusted for maternal age, parity, education, newborn gender, migrant, folic acid or multivitamin intake, cigarette smoking, maternal prepregnancy body mass index, and time of sample collection. Control participants had medians of 2.61Î¼g/dL Pb, 1.76Î¼g/L Cd, 3.57Î¼g/L Cr, 896.56Î¼g/L Cu, 4.17Î¼g/L Hg, and 186.47Î¼g/L Se in blood. In a model including all measured trace elements and adjusted for confounders, high levels of maternal Pb (OR=12.09, 95% CI: 2.81, 51.97) and Se (OR=0.25, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.77) were harmful and protective predictors of CHDs, respectively, with positive and negative interactions suggested for Cd with Pb and Se with Pb, respectively. Similar associations were detected for subgroups of CHDs, including conotruncal defects, septal defects, and right ventricle outflow tract obstruction. Our results suggest that even under the current standard for protecting human health (10Î¼g/dL), Pb exposure poses an important health threat. These data can be used for developing interventions and identifying high-risk pregnancies. Copyright Â© 2017. Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n\nMissing defects? A comparison of microscopic and macroscopic approaches to identifying linear enamel hypoplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nHassett, Brenna R\n\n2014-03-01\n\nLinear enamel hypoplasia (LEH), the presence of linear defects of dental enamel formed during periods of growth disruption, is frequently analyzed in physical anthropology as evidence for childhood health in the past. However, a wide variety of methods for identifying and interpreting these defects in archaeological remains exists, preventing easy cross-comparison of results from disparate studies. This article compares a standard approach to identifying LEH using the naked eye to the evidence of growth disruption observed microscopically from the enamel surface. This comparison demonstrates that what is interpreted as evidence of growth disruption microscopically is not uniformly identified with the naked eye, and provides a reference for the level of consistency between the number and timing of defects identified using microscopic versus macroscopic approaches. This is done for different tooth types using a large sample of unworn permanent teeth drawn from several post-medieval London burial assemblages. The resulting schematic diagrams showing where macroscopic methods achieve more or less similar results to microscopic methods are presented here and clearly demonstrate that \"naked-eye\" methods of identifying growth disruptions do not identify LEH as often as microscopic methods in areas where perikymata are more densely packed.

A total of 16 reverse radial artery flaps were utilized in a period of three years to cover various soft tissue defects of hand for paediatric age group patients. The age ranged from 5-18 years. The two common causes of soft tissue defects in this series were mechanical trauma and fireworks trauma with five cases in each group. Three of the cases were burn victims and other two presented with earth quake injuries. One patient had wound because of road traffic accident. Soft tissue defects of palm were covered with this flap in eight cases while in three cases it was wrapped around the thumb. First web space defects were covered with this flap in two cases. Two cases required coverage of amputation stump at transmetacarpal level and yet another required a big flap to cover the soft tissue defects at palm, dorsum and thumb. Donor site was covered with split skin graft in all cases but one, which was closed primarily. We had partial loss of flap in one case. Grafted donor sites healed uneventfully and were quite acceptable to the patients in due course of time. Reverse radial artery flap has a quite long arc of rotation which brings it great ease to cover the soft tissue defects of various areas of hand like palm, dorsum, first web space and thumb.\n\nA leucine-to-proline substitution causes a defective [alpha]-antichymotrypsin allele associated with familial obstructive lung disease\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPoller, W.; Scholz, S.; Fischer, M.\n\n1993-09-01\n\nUsing denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing of amplified genomic DNA, the authors have identified two defective mutants of the human [alpha][sub 1]-antichymotrypsin (ACT) gene associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A leucine 55-to-proline substitution causing a defective ACT allele (Bochum-1) was observed in a family with COPD in three subsequent generations. Another mutation, proline 229-to-alanine (Bonn-1), was associated with ACT serum deficiency in four patients with a positive family history. These mutations were not detected among 100 healthy control subjects, suggesting a possible pathogenetic role of ACT gene defects in a subset of patients with COPD. 14moreÂ Â» refs., 1 fig., 1 tab.Â«Â less\n\nMechanisms of PD-L1/PD-1-mediated CD8 T-cell dysfunction in the context of aging-related immune defects in the EÂµ-TCL1 CLL mouse model.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcClanahan, Fabienne; Riches, John C; Miller, Shaun; Day, William P; Kotsiou, Eleni; Neuberg, Donna; Croce, Carlo M; Capasso, Melania; Gribben, John G\n\n2015-07-09\n\nT-cell defects, immune suppression, and poor antitumor immune responses are hallmarks of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory signaling has emerged as a major immunosuppressive mechanism. However, the effect of different microenvironments and the confounding influence of aging are poorly understood. The current study uses the EÎ¼-TCL1 mouse model, which replicates human T-cell defects, as a preclinical platform to longitudinally examine patterns of T-cell dysfunction alongside developing CLL and in different microenvironments, with a focus on PD-1/PD-L1 interactions. The development of CLL was significantly associated with changes in T-cell phenotype across all organs and function. Although partly mirrored in aging wild-type mice, CLL-specific T-cell changes were identified. Murine CLL cells highly expressed PD-L1 and PD-L2 in all organs, with high PD-L1 expression in the spleen. CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells from leukemic and aging healthy mice highly expressed PD-1, identifying aging as a confounder, but adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated CLL-specific PD-1 induction. Direct comparisons of PD-1 expression and function between aging CLL mice and controls identified PD-1(+) T cells in CLL as a heterogeneous population with variable effector function. This is highly relevant for therapeutic targeting of CD8(+) T cells, showing the potential of reprogramming and selective subset expansion to restore antitumor immunity.

Adenosine stress may occasionally be associated with ECG changes. This study evaluated the strength of association between adenosine stress-related ECG changes and perfusion defects on Tc-MPS. 117 (mean age: 61.25Â±9.27 years; sex: men 87, women 30) patients with known/suspected coronary artery disease underwent adenosine stress MPS. ECG was monitored continuously during adenosine stress for ST-depression. On the basis of the summed difference score, reversible perfusion defects were categorized as follows: normal: less than 4, mild: 4-8, moderate: 9-13, and severe: more than 13. ST-depression was observed in 27/117 (23.1%) and reversible perfusion defects were observed in 18/27 (66.66%) patients. 2/27, 6/27, and 10/27 patients had mild, moderate, and severe ischemia, respectively. 9/27 patients had normal perfusion. ECG changes and perfusion defects showed a moderate strength of association (correlation coefficient r=0.35, P=0.006). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ECG findings for prediction of ischemia were 35.29, 86.36, 67.67, and 63.33%, respectively. ECG changes during adenosine stress are not uncommon. It shows a moderate strength of association with reversible perfusion defects. ECG changes during adenosine merit critical evaluation of MPS findings.\n\nLong-term Associations of an Early Corrected Ventricular Septal Defect and Stress Systems of Child and Mother at Primary School Age.\n\nPubMed\n\nStonawski, Valeska; Vollmer, Laura; KÃ¶hler-Jonas, Nicola; Rohleder, Nicolas; Golub, Yulia; Purbojo, Ariawan; Moll, Gunther H; Heinrich, Hartmut; Cesnjevar, Robert A; Kratz, Oliver; Eichler, Anna\n\n2017-01-01\n\nVentricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital heart defect, with larger VSDs typically being corrected with an open-heart surgery during infancy. Long-term consequences of a VSD-corrective surgery on stress systems of child and mother are still unknown. The aim of the present study is to investigate the associations of an early corrected VSD and diurnal cortisol release of child and mother. 26 children (12 boys) between 6 and 9âyears old, who underwent surgery for an isolated VSD within the first 3âyears of life, and their mothers participated in the study. Their diurnal cortisol profiles were compared to a sex-, age-, and socioeconomic status-matched healthy control group. Within the VSD group, associations between cortisol and characteristics of surgery and hospitalization were investigated. Child and mother psychopathological symptoms were considered as a possible interfering mechanism of altered cortisol profiles. Diurnal cortisol profiles of children with an early corrected VSD did not differ from those of controls. However, mothers of affected children exhibited higher cortisol levels in the morning ( p â<â0.001, [Formula: see text]) and a steeper diurnal cortisol slope ( p â=â0.016, [Formula: see text]) than mothers of healthy children. Results indicate a favorable development of children with an early corrected VSD, in terms of comparable diurnal cortisol profiles with healthy controls, according to a comparable mother-rated psychopathology. Mothers of affected children reveal altered diurnal cortisol levels, without differences in self-rated psychopathology. This divergence should be clarified in future research.\n\nAnalysis of Selected Maternal Exposures and Non-Syndromic Atrioventricular Septal Defects in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, 1997â2005\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPatel, Sonali S.; Burns, Trudy L.; Botto, Lorenzo D.; Riehle-Colarusso, Tiffany J.; Lin, Angela E.; Shaw, Gary M.; Romitti, Paul A.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAlthough the descriptive epidemiology of atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs), a group of serious congenital heart defects (CHDs), has been recently reported, non-genetic risk factors have not been consistently identified. Using data (1997â2005) from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, an ongoing multisite population-based caseâcontrol study, the association between selected non-genetic factors and non-syndromic AVSDs was examined. Data on periconceptional exposures to such factors were collected by telephone interview from 187 mothers of AVSD case infants and 6,703 mothers of unaffected infants. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from logistic regression models. Mothers who reported cigarette smoking during the periconceptional period were more likely to have infants with AVSDs compared with non-smokers, independent of maternal age, periconceptional alcohol consumption, infant gestational age, family history of CHDs, and study site (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1â2.4). The association was strongest in mothers who smoked more than 25 cigarettes/day. In addition, mothers with periconceptional passive smoke exposure were more likely to have infants with AVSDs than unexposed mothers, independent of maternal age, active periconceptional smoking, infant gestational age, and family history of CHDs (aOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0â2.0). No associations were observed between AVSDs and maternal history of a urinary tract infection or pelvic inflammatory disease, maternal use of a wide variety of medications, maternal occupational exposure, parental drug use, or maternal alcohol consumption. If the results of this preliminary study can be replicated, minimizing maternal active and passive smoke exposure may decrease the incidence of AVSDs.

We used data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study to conduct a case-control study investigating associations between maternal water consumption during pregnancy and birth defects (BD). We used interview data on water consumption during the first trimester of pregnancy in 14,454 cases (major BDs n â¥ 50) and 5,063 controls. Total water consumption was analyzed as a continuous variable and in quartiles. We evaluated the role of dietary quality and sugar sweetened beverage consumption. Logistic regression models were used to assess effects of water consumption on risk of BDs with adjustment for relevant covariates. Mean daily maternal water consumption among controls was 4.4 eight-ounce glasses. We observed decreases in estimated risk associated with increases in water consumption for several BDs, including neural tube defects (spina bifida), oral clefts (cleft lip), musculoskeletal defects (gastroschisis, limb deficiencies), and congenital heart defects (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, right-sided obstructions, pulmonary valve stenosis). Our results were generally unchanged when an indicator for overall dietary quality was included; however, there was evidence of effect measure modification by heavy consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages for some defects, but not all.
