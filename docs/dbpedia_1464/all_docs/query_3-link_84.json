But as Iceland pushed for a late goal that might keep them in the tournament, space opened up for Perisic to grab the last-gasp winner.\n\nMatter of fact\n\nIceland’s three second-half yellow cards were their first of the tournament\n\nTalking point\n\nOnly Luka Modric and Ivan Perisic retained their starting places for the final group game after coach Zlatko Dalic made wholesale changes.\n\nStats\n\nIceland/Croatia\n\nPossession (%): 41/59\n\nGoal attempts: 17/13\n\nAttempts on target: 8/8\n\nCorners: 10/5\n\nFouls: 10/12\n\nPass accuracy (%): 73/87\n\nDistance covered (km): 103/101\n\nIceland vs Nigeria (22nd June) Match Report\n\nMatch preview here.\n\nIceland Starting XI: 1 Hannes Halldorsson, 2 Birkir Saevarsson, 6 Ragnar Sigurdsson (5 Sverri Ingason 65), 8 Birkir Bjarnason, 10 Gylfi Sigurdsson, 11 Alfred Finnbogason, 14 Kari Arnason, 17 Aron Gunnarsson (23 Ari Skulason 87), 18 Hordur Magnusson, 19 Rurik Gislason, 22 Jon Dadi Bodvarsson (9 Bjorn Sigurdarson 71)\n\nNigeria Starting XI: 23 Francis Uzoho, 2 Brian Idowu (21 Tyronne Ebuehi 46), 4 Wilfred Ndidi, 5 William Troost-Ekong, 6 Leon Balogun, 7 Ahmed Musa, 8 Oghenekaro Etebo (18 Alex Iwobi 90), 10 Jon Obi Mikel, 11 Victor Moses, 14 Kelechi Iheanacho (9 Odion Ighalo 85), 22 Kenneth Omeruo\n\nVolgograd\n\nNigeria 2 Iceland 0\n\nScorers\n\nNigeria: Musa 49, 75\n\nIceland: none\n\nMatch overview\n\nThe blistering pace of Ahmed Musa destroyed Iceland, whose tight organisation melted away in the face of Nigeria’s second-half attacks.\n\nAfter an incident-free first half, Nigeria sprung to life after the break. Victor Moses led a swift counter-attack that was finished with with a scorching volley by Musa for the first goal. Musa then outran the Iceland defence to dispatch the second. Nigeria could have had more – Musa rattled the crossbar – before a VAR review gave Iceland the chance to get back in the game. But Gylfi Sigurdsson sent his penalty over.\n\nMatter of fact\n\nNigeria had no goal attempts in the first half.\n\nTalking point\n\nNigeria were a side transformed from their opening game against Croatia thanks to the changes made by coach Gerhard Rohr. Musa and Kelechi Iheanacho started in a revamped 3-5-2 formation.\n\nStats\n\nNigeria/Iceland\n\nPossession (%): 57/43\n\nGoal attempts: 16/10\n\nAttempts on target: 6/6\n\nCorners: 6/5\n\nFouls: 9/9\n\nPass accuracy (%): 82/69\n\nDistance covered (km): 100/106\n\nIceland vs Argentina (16th June) Match Report\n\nPlaying in their first World Cup, can Iceland manage to stop the offensive class of Argentina? – Match preview here.\n\nIceland Starting XI: 1 Hannes Halldorsson, 2 Birkir Saevarsson, 6 Ragnar Sigurdsson, 7 Johann Gudmundsson (19 Rurik Gislason 64), 8 Birkir Bjarnason, 10 Gylfi Sigurdsson, 11 Alfred Finnbogason (9 Bjorn Sigurdarson 89), 17 Aaron Gunnarsson (23 Ari Skulason 76), 14 Karl Arnason, 18 Hordor Magnusson, 20 Emil Hallfredsson\n\nArgentina Starting XI: 23 Willy Caballero, 3 Nicolas Tagliafico, 5 Lucas Biglia (7 Ever Banega 54), 13 Maximiliano Meza (9 Gonzalo Higuain 84), 14 Javier Mascherano, 10 Lionel Messi, 11 Angel Di Maria (22 Cristian Pavon 75), 16 Marcos Rojo, 17 Nicolas Otamendi, 18 Eduardo Salvio, 19 Sergio Aguero\n\nMoscow Spartak\n\nArgentina 1 Iceland 1\n\nScorers:\n\nArgentina: Aguero 19\n\nIceland: Finnbogason 23\n\nMatch overview\n\nArgentina’s opening game ended in frustration after being held by a disciplined Iceland side playing their first ever World Cup match. Lionel Messi was denied the winner by Iceland keeper Hannes Halldorsson, who saved a second-half penalty and was the anchor of an Iceland defence that resisted a wave of Argentina attacks.\n\nMan of the match\n\nIceland’s keeper Hannes Halldorsson saved a Lionel Messi penalty and kept his team in the game when saving from from Cristian Pavon late in the game.\n\nMatter of fact\n\nArgentina’s goal was Sergio Aguero’s first World Cup goal.\n\nTalking point\n\nThe clash of styles was highlighted by the pass accuracyy stats. Argentina completed 92 per cent of their passes, compared to only 67 per cent for Iceland. Argentina also enjoyed the vast majority of possession (72 per cent) but Lionel Messi frequently found himself crowded out by two or three Iceland defenders.\n\nStats\n\nArgentina/Iceland\n\nPossession (%): 72/28\n\nGoal attempts: 26/9\n\nAttempts on target: 9/5\n\nCorners: 10/2\n\nFouls: 10/15\n\nPass accuracy (%): 92/67\n\nDistance covered (km): 101/105\n\nIceland World Cup Guide\n\nAmazingly, Iceland reached the 2018 World Cup finals as winners of their group. They are by far the smallest nation ever to qualify and – at a mere 339,000 – the first with a population under a million. The team were a bit rusty at first, following an amazing run at their first major tournament at Euro 2016, where they were unbeaten until losing in the quarter-finals to hosts France. The players grew in strength and, against all odds, won seven of their 10 games, including all of their home games.\n\nKey Moments in Qualifying\n\nSep 2016\n\nA lucky 3-2 win over Finland with two goals in injury time, including a disputed winner.\n\nSep 2017\n\nStrangely, a 1-0 loss to Finland in Tampere, with three more games to play, is crucial. The players realise they have probably become complacent and, following the defeat, they go back to basics.\n\nOct 2017\n\nA fantastic 3-0 win away to Turkey puts Iceland on top of the group again, as Croatia draw at home against Finland the same night.\n\nOct 2017\n\nPlaying hosts to Kosovo, and with their fate in their own hands, they break down their resilient guests just before half-time, adding a second goal after the interval.\n\nIceland World Cup Group\n\nIceland are in Group D alongside Argentina, Ivan Rakitic’s Croatia, and Nigeria.\n\nIceland World Cup Friendlies\n\nIn January of 2018, Iceland dismantled Indonesia 4-1, to get the year off to winning ways. But they then lost three matches in a row against Mexico, Peru and Norway. In their final game, they got a draw against Ghana.\n\n14th January – Indonesia (won 4-1)\n\n24th March – Mexico (lost 3-0)\n\n28th March – Peru (lost 3-1)\n\n2nd June – Norway (lost 3-2)\n\n7th June – Ghana (drew 2-2)\n\nIceland World Cup Fixtures\n\nIceland open their tough group account against Argentina on the 16th of June. Nigeria then await on the 22nd, and finally a potentially crucial game against Croatia takes place on the 26th.\n\n16th June – Argentina (drew 1-1)\n\n22nd june – Nigeria\n\n26th June – Croatia\n\nRelated: Ivan Rakitic November 2007\n\nThe Coach\n\nHeimir Hallgrimsson, age 50 (10.06.67)\n\nA qualified dentist who still runs a clinic in his native Westmann Islands, he was appointed assistant to Lars Lagerback, when the Icelandic Football Federation hired the Swede as national coach in 2011. Shortly after failing to qualify for the 2014 World Cup, Hallgrimsson and Lagerback signed contracts as joint managers, and when the Swede called it a day after Euro 2016, Hallgrimsson became the sole boss.\n\nThe Players\n\nStars\n\nAlthough having a very quiet start to his Everton career, midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson was top scorer during the World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nStalwarts\n\nCaptain Aron Einar Gunnarsson is the heart of the Iceland team, with Sigurdsson being the brain. Gunnarsson’s never-say-die attitude is crucial, pulling the strings in midfield and allowing Sigurdsson time and space to attack. Centre-backs Ragnar Sigurdsson and Kari Arnason are an important pairing, with keeper Hannes Halldorsson another essential piece in the puzzle.\n\nMissing\n\nForward Kolbeinn Sigthorsson has hardly played since Euro 2016, having sustained a knee injury in September 2016, but he hopes to return to action before the end of 2017.\n\nIceland World Cup Squad\n\nFinal 23-man squad –\n\nGOALKEEPERS: Hannes Thor Halldorsson (Randers FC), Runar Alex Runarsson (FC Nordsjælland), Frederik Schram (FC Roskilde).\n\nDEFENDERS: Kari Arnason (Aberdeen), Ari Freyr Skulason (K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen), Birkir Mar Saevarsson (Hammarby), Sverrir Ingi Ingason (FC Rostov), Hordur Magnusson (Bristol City), Holmar Orn Eyjolfsson (Maccabi Haifa), Ragnar Sigurdsson (FC Rostov).\n\nMIDFIELDERS: Johann Berg Gudmundsson (Burnley), Birkir Bjarnason (Aston Villa), Arnor Ingvi Traustason (Malmo FF), Emil Hallfredsson (Udinese), Gylfi Sigurdsson (Everton), Olafur Ingi Skulason (Kardemir Karabukspor), Rurik Gislason (FC Nurnberg), Samuel Fridjonsson (Valerenga), Aron Gunnarsson (Cardiff City).\n\nFORWARDS: Alfred Finnbogason (FC Augsburg), Bjorn Bergmann Sigurdarson (FC Rostov), Jon Dadi Bodvarsson (Reading), Albert Gudmundsson (PSV Eindhoven).\n\nIceland World Cup Injuries\n\nIceland’s best player Gylfi Sigurdsson suffered a serious knee injury whilst playing for Everton. He is in a race against time to be fit for the tournament.\n\nThe Unanswered Questions\n\nHow can such a small nation qualify for the World Cup?\n\nThe recent generation of players is strong, both physically and mentally. All of them playing professionally abroad, although few are with big teams in strong leagues.\n\nHow have Iceland climbed the FIFA ranking list so quickly?\n\nThe transition can be traced back 15 years to when the country started building indoor football arenas. Before then, adverse weather conditions meant players could not train properly during the winter. Another reason is a high standard of coaches.\n\nHas Iceland got enough strength in depth if key players get injured?\n\nIf important players such as captain Gunnarsson or Gylfi Sigurdsson are not available, their replacements would not be of the same quality even though Iceland has a pretty strong squad of 20 to 25 players. Recent friendlies suggest that, at this moment in time, others are not ready to step up.\n\nWill Heimir Hallgrimsson stick to his tried and tested 4-4-2 formation?\n\nIceland usually play 4-4-2 but during the qualifiers they sometimes used a 4-5-1 set-up, with Sigurdsson in the hole behind a lone striker. In a recent friendly they even experimented with three centre-backs in a five-man defensive line – which could be used at times in the summer.\n\nAt World Soccer we will update you with all the news related to the World Cup on our website.
