We had enough chances to win by a few goals but we failed to put away our chances.\n\nGrindavik 2-1 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 372917\n\nRemember 'Johann Laxdal'? The right-back I bought in my first season. He's now managing Grindavik, and he somehow managed to beat me, his former boss... And no I didn't let him win.\n\nFram 0-1 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 372916\n\nBack to winning ways with a 1-0 win over Fram. 'Olli Nygard' with the only goal of the game.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 5-0 Selfoss (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 372915\n\nA good performance here with a 5-0 over Selfoss.\n\nKFR Hvolsvollur 0-4 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Cup 4th Round)\n\nView attachment 372914\n\nAnother side I've never heard of. I played a weakened team and we won comfortably as expected.\n\nThrottur R. 0-7 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Cup Quarter Finals)\n\nView attachment 372913\n\nAnother game against a much weaker side in the Icelandic Cup. I again fielded a weakened side, and won with ease. We played very well.\n\nIcelandic Premier League\n\nView attachment 372912\n\nDespite a few slip-ups this month, we are still 7 points clear at the top of the league, and should end up winning it by a fairly large margin.\n\nPlayer Of The Month\n\nView attachment 372911\n\nStriker 'Dusan Marinkovic was our best player this month. He doesn't usually start, but he got a few chances this month, and impressed.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nWho do we get in our Champions League Group?\n\nWill we finally get anything decent from our youth intake?\n\nView attachment 372910\n\nAugust\n\nWe finally got a decent youth intake .\n\nWe were 2nd seeds in the Champions League again.\n\nWe didn't have to qualify for the group stages this year.\n\nAugust Fixtures\n\nBreidablik 1-3 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 372909\n\nAn expected 3-1 win over Breidablik.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 2-0 Fram (Icelandic Cup Semi-Finals)\n\nView attachment 372908\n\nWe overcame Fram to make the finals of the Icelandic Cup where we will face Stjarnan.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 4-1 Stjarnan (Icelandic Cup Finals)*****FINALS*****\n\nView attachment 372907\n\nA good performance here as we win the Icelandic Cup with a 4-1 win over Stjarnan.\n\nHaukar 1-4 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 372906\n\nAn easy win over a relegation threatened Haukar side.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 2-2 Fjolnir (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 372905\n\nA poor performance and result. We went into half-time in shock at the fact we were 2-0 down. We fought back to a 2-2 draw, but i'm still disappointed.\n\nIcelandic Premier League Table\n\nView attachment 372904\n\nAfter we dropped a couple of points in the league this month, our lead was reduced to 5 points, as Fram won every game this month.\n\nPlayer Of The Month\n\nView attachment 372903\n\nTor Skippervik was our best player this month.\n\nChampions League Group Stage\n\nView attachment 372897 View attachment 372910 View attachment 605494 View attachment 372902\n\nBayern Munich................Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur................Rangers FC.......................CFR Cluj\n\nFor the 2nd season in a row we were drawn as 2nd seeds, and I expect to finish 2nd. Rangers are not a bad side, but we are better and i'm confident we will finish above them.\n\nYouth Intake\n\nView attachment 372900 View attachment 372899\n\nIt really wasn't a bad youth intake this year. Striker 'Julius Fridriksson' was the best prospect & attacking midfielder 'Orri Jakobsson' also looks like becoming a good player.\n\nTransfer Center\n\nView attachment 372898\n\nNot much has been happening on the transfer front. The only move of note was midfielder 'Marius Blokhus' joining dutch side 'NEC Nijmegan' for a fee of ?2mil. He was only ever a backup player for us.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nHow many points will we win the league by this year?\n\nView attachment 372785\n\nSeptember\n\nWe win all our league games this month.\n\nWe lose our first group game in the Champions League to Bayern Munich.\n\nSeptember Fixtures\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 5-0 Vikingur R. (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 372784\n\nAn easy win for us against a relegation threatened side.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 3-0 Valur (Icelandic Premier league)\n\nView attachment 372782\n\nA good performance. We comfortably beat Valur 3-0.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 0-2 Bayern Munich (Champions League Group A)\n\nView attachment 372780\n\nBayern Munich were just too strong for us. We didn't really trouble the German giants very much.\n\nStjarnan 3-5 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 372779\n\nI imagine this was a very entertaining game for the fans. We wen't into a 3-0 lead, but somehow we managed to let it slip, and we dropped down to 3-3 which was disappointing. We ended up winning 5-3 in the end.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 4-1 Fimleikafelag Hafnarfjardar (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 372775\n\nA strong performance here as we beat 'FH' convincingly. 'Tor Skippervik' scored a hat-trick in the process.\n\nVikingur O' 0-3 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 372774\n\nWith this comfortable win over 'Vikingur O' we confirm we have won the league with a game to spare. I would have rathered had the league wrapped up earlier than this, but the main thing is we won the league.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 5-2 Grindavik (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 372773\n\nA good performance to end the league campaign. Striker Gudmundur Kolbeinsson who hasn't played that much this season scored 4 of our goals.\n\nIcelandic Premier League Table\n\nView attachment 372762\n\nWe end up winning the league by 5 points. We were never really in danger of losing the league.\n\nPlayer Of The Month\n\nView attachment 372756\n\nTor Skippervik was our best player this month. The striker has been in great form this season.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nA review of this season.\n\nHey !\n\nYou still don't manage the national team ?\n\nWhat is its ranking by now ?\n\nI hope you'll reach Champions League's semi-final this year!\n\nNope. I don't really want to manage the national team at the moment. The side is pretty woeful at the moment, and the fact I don't have that many Icelandic internationals at KR makes me even less motivated to go for the national job.\n\nIceland are currently ranked 100th place which is pathetic, especially as about 5-6 years ago (when I had quite a few Icelandic internationals at KR) they were ranked around 35th-40th.\n\nI really want to challenge for the CL this year, and I feel we could challenge for it if we're at our best (and we don't draw Monaco who I just can't seem to beat :S)\n\nView attachment 369526\n\nSeason Review\n\nWe won the quadruple again as expected.\n\nFram did manage to put in a slight challenge for the title.\n\nI do hope to win the win the Champions League soon, but we seem to always struggle once we get past the group stages.\n\nStats\n\nView attachment 369525\n\n'Olli Nygard' was our top goal scorer in the league with 15 goals. 'Tor Skippervik' was close behind with 14 league goals.\n\n'Tor Skippervik' had an average rating of 8.45 which was the best in the league & a new record high for the league.\n\n'Tor Skippervik' was also our assist leader, creating 14 goals during the league campaign.\n\nFair Play Award\n\nView attachment 369523\n\nFram won the fair play award this year. We were 2nd. We are almost always in the top 3 for this which is good. We play fair and win fair .\n\nTeam Of The Year\n\nView attachment 369515\n\nWe had 5 players in the team of the year. Espen Falch-Olsen, Patrick Knudsen, Joseph Okafor, Jorgen Bertilsson & Olli Nygard made the team of the year.\n\nManager Of The Year\n\nView attachment 369514\n\nI won the manager of the year award.\n\nOur Player Of The Year\n\nView attachment 369513 View attachment 369512\n\nJorgen Bertilsson was our player of the year, and also won the Icelandic player of the year award.

Here's how the other group games went.\n\nRangers 0-5 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Champions League Group A)\n\nView attachment 367863\n\nA great performance here as we put 5 past Rangers in Glasgow.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 5-0 CFR Cluj (Champions League Group A)\n\nView attachment 367862\n\nAnother very good performance here, winning 5-0 against Cluj.

Didn't really create much, and didn't look too good in defence either.\n\nChampions League Group A Table\n\nView attachment 367857\n\nOur performances were a bit hit & miss throughout this group. We finished 2nd and progressed to the knock-out rounds which is the main thing. We will need better performances though if we are to mount a challenge for the Champions League.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nA preview of the upcoming season.\n\nView attachment 367752\n\nPre-Season\n\nNot the busiest of pre-seasons.\n\nNo new signings just yet.\n\nPre-Season Fixtures\n\nFurth 1-1 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur\n\nAstra Giurgiu 0-3 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur\n\nNew York 0-3 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur\n\nSeattle 1-3 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur\n\nFram 1-4 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (For a Fram players testimonial)\n\nTransfer Centre\n\nView attachment 367751\n\nA couple of notable players leave.\n\nColin Posa joins Italian side Udinese for a fee of £5.25mil. He was no longer a regular starter so it made sense to cash in.\n\nLars Bo Frandsen joins Swiss giants Grasshoppers for a fee of £3.9mil. The 19 year old never developed so it made sense to sell.\n\nBranko Mikic joins Danish giants FC Kopenhavn for a fee of £2.2mil. He's another 19 year old who never really developed.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nThe start of the Upper League Cup which I expect to win again.\n\nWe play AC Milan in the Champions League 1st knock-out round.\n\nView attachment 367750\n\nFebruary\n\nA fairly short February as usual.\n\nFebruary Fixtures\n\nValur 0-1 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Upper League Cup Group B)\n\nView attachment 367749\n\nA 1-0 over Valur, but it was a comfortable victory.

Right-back Patrick Knudsen was the goal-scorer. It was a very even game. We will probably need a goal in the away leg to see ourselves through.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 6-0 Ithrottafelag Reykjavikur (Upper League Cup Group B)\n\nView attachment 367741\n\nAn easy victory over much weaker opposition.\n\nUpper League Cup Group B Table\n\nView attachment 367740\n\nNot much to say here..\n\nPlayer Of The Month\n\nView attachment 367739\n\nPatrick Knudsen, for securing us a first leg win over AC Milan.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nCan we see off AC Milan and get to the CL Quarter Finals?\n\nView attachment 367251\n\nMarch\n\nA busier month.\n\nWe get past AC Milan.\n\nMarch Fixtures\n\nHandknattleiksfelag Kopavogs 0-7 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Upper League Cup Group B)\n\nView attachment 367250\n\nA 'Tor Skippervik' inspired win as the striker nets 5 of our goals.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 4-0 Fimleikafelag Hafnarfjardar (Upper League Cup Group B)\n\nView attachment 367249\n\nA good performance and win over 'FH'.\n\nAC Milan 1-1 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Champions League 1st Knockout Round / Second Leg)\n\nWe win 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nView attachment 367248\n\nWe get through to the quarter finals of the CL after a nervy 1-1 draw in Milan.
