        "text": "The 2018 World Cup is set to kick off in Russia on June 14. Thirty-two teams in eight groups will vie for the FIFA World Cup, the most prestigious prize in international soccer.\n\nThis year's competition features several compelling storylines: the ongoing battle between Argentina's Lionel Messi and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo for the title of the best player in the world; defending World Cup champion Germany's repeat bid; and the Cinderella stories such as the upstart Iceland team and Egypt, which is making its first World Cup appearance in nearly three decades. Then, of course you have storied countries such as Brazil and England attempting to add to their lore.\n\nMORE: Sign up for a free seven-day trial to watch the World Cup on fuboTV!\n\nHere's a group-by-group breakdown of key teams and players to watch in the 2018 World Cup, along with our picks and predictions to emerge from each group.\n\nWorld Cup 2018: Groups, teams, players to watch\n\nGroup A: Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Uruguay\n\nFavorite: Uruguay. Uruguay has advanced past the group stage in four of the last five World Cups, but hasn't won it since 1950. It will be looking to carry on tradition in Russia.\n\nPlayer to watch: Luis Suarez\n\nAt 31, the Barcelona man could be playing in his last World Cup. Coming off a season during which he scored 33 goals in all competitions, he's at the height of his powers and ready to put on for his country.\n\nDark horse: Egypt\n\nEgypt is making its first World Cup appearance in 28 years and will need a fully healthy Mohamed Salah to have a chance to emerge from its group. If he can revisit the record-breaking form he showed at Liverpool, for which he scored a Premier League record 32 goals in 38 games, in 2017-18, he could be the talk of the tournament.\n\nBest matchup: Russia vs. Saudi Arabia\n\nThis game will kickoff the World Cup when it starts at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow June 14 at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nPicks to advance: Uruguay, Russia\n\nGroup B: Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Iran\n\nFavorite: Portugal. The winner of of the 2016 Euros should come into Russia with all the confidence in the world.\n\nPlayer to watch: Cristiano Ronaldo. Enough said.\n\nDark horse: Iran\n\nIt took a goal in the 91st minute goal from Lionel Messi to defeat Iran back in 2014. Iran was good then, and should be even better now.\n\nBest matchup: Portugal vs. Spain\n\nPicks to advance: Portugal, Spain\n\nWORLD CUP 2018: World Cup 2018: Schedule, group matches, how to watch live\n\nGroup C: France, Australia, Peru, Denmark\n\n​Favorite: France\n\nPlayer to watch: Ousmane Dembélé\n\nThe 21-year-old striker who's been underwhelming since making a monster move to Barcelona from Borussia Dortmund back in August. Amid transfer rumors, he could prove he's the world-class wonderkid, he's been billed as while helping lead a loaded French side to the biggest prize in international soccer.\n\nDark horse: Peru\n\nThirty-four year-old Paolo Guererro is likely playing in his final World Cup. Peru's all-time leader in caps and goals, he won't be satisfied with simply leading his country to its first World Cup since 1982.\n\nBest matchup: Peru vs. Denmark\n\nFrance is head and shoulders above the rest of the competition, so the matchup between Peru and Denmark could be an all-out battle for the other spot into the Round of 16 from this group.\n\nPicks to advance: France, Denmark\n\nGroup D: Argentina, Iceland, Croatia, Nigeria\n\nFavorite: Argentina. The World Cup is the only dragon Lionel Messi hasn't slayed. He'll have his opportunity one more time in Russia.\n\nPlayer to watch: Lionel Messi\n\nAgain. Need we say more?\n\nDark horse: Nigeria\n\nLed by a roster that includes young, energetic talent, including Alex Iwobi (Arsenal) and Kelechi Iheanacho (Leicester City) and veterans such as Victor Moses (Chelsea) an Odion Ighalo (Changchun Yatai), the Super Eagles could be primed to shock some people.\n\nBest matchup: Iceland vs. Nigeria\n\nOne thing's for sure, when these two get it cracking, their supporters, some of the most uniquely vibrant in world football, will make the atmosphere extremely spirited.\n\nPicks to advance: Argentina, Croatia\n\nWORLD CUP GOLDEN BALL: Who are the contenders for Russia 2018 best player award?\n\nGroup E: Brazil, Switzerland, Costa Rica, Serbia\n\nFavorite: Brazil. Too. Much. Sauce. Brazil is just too talented and too technical not to begin following up its gold medal in the 2016 Olympics by outclassing the rest of the competition in the group stages at the World Cup.\n\nPlayer to watch: Neymar Jr./Phillipe Coutinho/Roberto Firmino\n\nJust pick one. Neymar, fully fit, will obviously be the headliner, but Brazil's roster is flush with skill all the way through with talent such as FC Barcelona midfielder Phillipe Coutinho and Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino. Brazil will be a joy to watch.\n\nDark horse: Costa Rica\n\nCosta Rica was given 2,500 to 1 odds to win the World Cup in and wound up finishing eighth. It's got to be thinking it can do what many don't suspect it will again.\n\nBest matchup: Costa Rica vs. Switzerland\n\nPicks to advance: Brazil, Switzerland\n\nGroup F: Germany, Mexico, Sweden, Korea Republic\n\nFavorite: Germany. The juggernaut should run through this group like a yellow light.\n\nPlayer to watch: Marco Reus. The Borussia Dortmund star was hurt when Germany won the 2014 World Cup, but is back in the fold in 2018 despite returning to action after yet another injury in February.\n\nDark horse: Mexico\n\nBest matchup: Mexico vs. Sweden\n\nPicks to advance: Germany\n\nGroup G: Belgium, Panama, Tunisia, England\n\nFavorite: Belgium\n\nYou won't find a side with more proven talent, from Romelu Lukaku (Manchester United) to Eden Hazard (Chelsea) to Kevin De Bruyne and Vincent Kompany (Manchester City) Belgium has no excuse not to contend for the World Cup title.\n\nPlayer to watch: Kevin De Bruyne\n\nWhat can't the midfielder do? De Bruyne is one of the most skilled player isn the world and likely would've been the Premier League's Player of the Year had it not been for Salah's goal-scoring prowess. Grab your popcorn whenever he takes to the pitch. It's going to be a movie.\n\nDark horse: England\n\nDon't let a disappointing finish in the Euros, which included a loss to Iceland, England still has a roster that boasts the likes of Harry Kane (Tottenham) and Raheem Sterling (Manchester City), two of the Premier League's top five goalscorers.\n\nBest matchup: Belgium vs. England\n\nPicks to advance: Belgium, England\n\nGroup H: Poland, Senegal, Colombia, Japan\n\nFavorite: Colombia\n\nPlayer to watch: Sadio Mane'\n\nThe lightning fast striker scored 20 goals and dished out eight assists across all competitions while helping Liverpool reach the Champions League final and has been linked to Real Madrid.\n\nDark horse: Senegal\n\nBest matchup: Poland vs. Senegal\n\nIt's presumed Colombia, which reached the quarterfinals in last years's World Cup, will move on. So, the battle between Poland, led by Bayern Munich superstar Robert Lewandowski, could have huge implications for the Round of 16."
