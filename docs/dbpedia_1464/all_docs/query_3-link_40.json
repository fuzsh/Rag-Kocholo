        "text": "Play the PFS World Cup Prediction Challenge.\n\nThe World Cup\n\nThe World Cup is soccer’s most prestigious event. Occurring every four years, billions of people tune into the month-long festival of soccer contested by international teams, meaning the players are all natives of the country they represent (similar to how a college team operates where all players are students of the university). Players train their entire careers around representing their country in this tournament.\n\nThe Format\n\nThere are three phases of the World Cup: qualification, the group stage, and the knockout stage.\n\nQualification\n\nTeams have been qualifying for the 2018 World Cup since 2015. Only the host nation (this year, Russia) is guaranteed a spot.\n\nA country must be recognized by FIFA to qualify for the World Cup. Each country is affiliated with a confederation (roughly broken down by continents). Each confederation has its own qualifying format. FIFA dictates how many teams can qualify for the World Cup from each confederation. FIFA offers a comprehensive breakdown of each confederation’s World Cup qualification format and team allotment.\n\nGroup Stage\n\nA total of 32 countries qualify for the World Cup.\n\nThese countries are split up into 8 groups of 4 (labeled Group A, Group B, and so on).\n\nA draw determines the composition of the groups. Teams are split into four “pots”. The host country is always assigned placed in Pot 1. The remaining teams are placed in the pots based solely on the FIFA World Rankings as of October 2017.\n\nNo two teams are allowed to be in the same group if they are from the same confederation. The exception is UEFA (Europe), who is allowed up to two teams in each group due to the high amount of teams that qualify.\n\nThe group stage is 8 small round robin tournaments. Each team will play each other once for a total of 3 games per team.\n\nThe result of each game decides the amount of points are awarded to each country. Points are assigned as follows: 3 for a win, 1 for a draw (tie), and 0 for a loss. In the group stage, draws are possible.\n\nOnce all the games are completed, the top two countries from each group advance to the knockout stage. If two teams are tied with the same point total, the standings are decided by goal differential. This is calculated by how many goals one country scored minus how many goals the same country has conceded. The complete tiebreaker procedure can be found on the FIFA website.\n\nKnockout Stage\n\nA total of 16 teams advance to the knockout stage.\n\nA bracket is set based on how the teams fared in the group stage. The bracket below depicts how each country is placed, with the letter representing the group and the number representing the rank in their group.\n\nThere are no draws in the knockout stage. If there is still a tie after the regulation match, an extra 30 minutes (two halves of 15 minutes) are played. The full 30 minutes of overtime are played regardless of whether goals are scored during that time.\n\nIf there is still a tie after the extra 30 minutes, penalty kicks take place. Teams alternate shooting from a spot 12 yards (10.97 meters) from the goal. Each team is given 5 attempts to score. The match ends either when one team leads after both teams complete their five attempts or if at any point one team cannot even the score by the end of the five attempts. If a tie persists after these 5 penalty kicks, the match goes into sudden death. The match then ends when one team is ahead after each team had the same number of attempts.\n\nThe knockout stage proceeds from 16 to 8 to 4 to 2 and finally to 1, the World Cup champion.\n\nThe Groups\n\nThe Favorites\n\nGermany\n\nThe defending champions are full of veteran talent backed by explosive youth. With one of the best goalkeepers in the world and a solid defense, Germany has a good chance to defend its World Cup title. Primary keeper Manuel Neuer is coming off an injury, providing just a hint of intrigue. The exclusion of Leroy Sane from the 23 man squad was major question mark, since Germany’s one flaw appears to be a lack of a premier striker.\n\nBrazil\n\nYouth defines Brazil. With youth, though, you could get a deep run or an early flame out. Neymar the star of this squad. He had to leave the 2014 World Cup after fracturing a vertebrae in his back. Neymar’s absence was starkly apparent in their last outing on the World Cup stage, in which Brazil were exposed by Germany 7-1 in the semifinal. If they get back on track, Neymar could end up with the Golden Boot (top scorer) by the end. Expect a fiery team that has a huge chip on their shoulders.\n\nArgentina\n\nThis team lives and dies with Lionel Messi. He is one of the 2 best players in the world (the debate for best player between Messi and Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo is eternal) with his majestic approach to soccer. He is the heart and soul of this team, single-handedly carrying them through the qualifying stages. La Albiceleste lost to Germany the last time around in the final. Sergio Aguero, Angel Di Maria, and Paulo Dybala are nice complementary pieces, but Argentina could be booted in the group stage if Messi gets bottled up.\n\nFrance\n\nOn paper, this team might be the favorite. Paul Pogba, Antoine Griezmann, Hugo Lloris, and N’Golo Kante: all studs in the club scene. This team has the talent to win the tournament without contest, but also lacks the experience of comparable front runners. Expect a semifinals appearance and a clean sweep of their easy group. Griezmann also could end up with the Golden Boot, but the 19 year old sensation Kylian Mbappe might be stealing a few of his goals.\n\nSpain\n\nIn 2014, they entered the World Cup the #1 ranked team. They subsequently got crushed by the Netherlands and Chile and were ousted in the group stage. A repeat should not happen, with some new faces carrying them through the group. Drawing Portugal in their group, though, will be one of the spiciest matchups of the tournament. Expect a deep run led by Real Madrid’s Isco, an attacking midfielder making his World Cup debut at age 26. Real’s defensive powerhouse in Sergio Ramos will captain the team with keeper David De Gea. This team has the best back line in the tournament, a major difference between this tournament and the 2014 one.\n\nThe Dark Horses\n\nBelgium\n\nThis is the Golden Age for Belgium soccer. Never have they had a team this talented, especially in the midfield. Expect them to have a good showing regardless, but if Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard performs like he does during the club season, this team can win it all. Romelu Lukaku is their primary scorer, but Dries Mertens and Kevin De Bruyne offer a potential attack from the midfield. A solid defensive team as well, this nation is built to have a fantastic showing.\n\nEngland\n\nAn early disappointment feels inevitable for this team based on recent history. The Lions tend to drop out early all the time, having not make it past the first knockout round since 2006. Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Marcus Rashford, Raheem Sterling, and Kyle Walker are some of the Premier League’s best and highlight a new look for the Three Lions. Expect this team to make a deep run; do not be convinced they will falter early.\n\nPortugal\n\nAfter discussing Messi earlier, his rival Cristiano Ronaldo is the other player known to be one of the best. He carried the Portuguese side to their first European Championship in 2016, leaving the FIFA World Cup Trophy as the only one he has yet to lift between his La Liga and international careers. Expect his best, but just like Messi and Argentina, Portugal’s success depends on him and him alone.\n\nColombia\n\nJames (ha-mez) Rodriguez stole the show the last time out, ranked as the best player in the group stage in 2014. This team is not deep enough to be called favorites, but expect a decent showing and some big wins. A 3-2 win over France in a friendly on March 23 highlights their potential; subsequent 0-0 draws to Australia and Egypt demonstrate their floor.\n\nUruguay\n\nThis team is very underrated and ended up an easy group A. La Celeste is almost guaranteed a spot in the knockout round, led by Barcelona’s scoring machine, Luis Suarez, and PSG’s Edinson Cavani. As long as Suarez can stay on the field (by not biting anyone), this team can make a run. A first knockout round match up against Portugal or Spain looms large.\n\nThe Potent Notables\n\nIceland\n\nThe darlings of Euro 2016 and World Cup qualifying. In Euro 2016, they tied the eventual winners (Portugal) on their way to finishing second in their group, then upset England in the Round of 16 before falling in a nail-biter to France. In World Cup qualifying, they clinched a World Cup berth by topping their group, going 7-2-1, the first time ever for this small nation of about 300,000 people. They have had games where almost 10% of the entire Icelandic population was in attendance. Everyone is cheering for this Skol-chanting, Viking-clapping team. They will be fun to watch.\n\nMexico\n\nThe best North American representative, do not expect too much. They have advanced beyond the group stage in the last 6 World Cups, but have been knocked out immediately in the Round of 16 each time. El Tri got an unfortunate draw with Germany and two under-seeded teams in South Korea and Sweden, so that streak could be in jeopardy for the worst. They are full of MLS talent, so this team may have some recognizable names to American soccer fans. A 0-2 loss to Denmark in their final World Cup tune up suggests some poor form, but a winning tradition could buoy them in tight matches.\n\nCosta Rica\n\nThis team was the Cinderella of Brazil 2014, making the quarterfinals and losing to the Netherlands in a penalty shootout. The small Central-American nation has a small shot given that they were placed in a favorable group. Expect their games against Serbia and Switzerland to be fantastic as they will be fighting to be the second team to escape the group stage behind Brazil. Keylor Navas, best known as the starting goalie for Real Madrid, is the star to know.\n\nEgypt\n\nThe world’s greatest new player is Mohamed Salah. Named the player of the year, Liverpool rode him to the Champions League final. He carried this African team through qualifiers. It’s Salah and a bunch of guys not many people have ever heard of, includeing a 45 year-old goalkeeper. Don’t expect much, but they could steal an upset somewhere just off of Salah’s talent.\n\nPanama\n\nThis is the team essentially that stole the US’s spot. They snuck in during the last day of the CONCACAF qualifying hex stage, defeating Costa Rica and watching the US lose by the same score to Trinidad and Tobago. Keep an eye on this newbie to the World Cup, as they try to continue to defy the odds.\n\nThe Missing\n\nUSA\n\nPerhaps years in the making, the US failed to qualify for the World Cup after a loss to lowly Trinidad and Tobago and unlikely victories for Panama and Honduras. Christian Pulisic’s first shot at leading this team to glory will not happen this time around, as this team wasted 4 years of his talent and hard work. (The US did win a Gold Cup in 2017, though). Expect a team full of new players and some qualifying struggles as they try to get their spot back in Qatar 2022.\n\nItaly\n\nThe Azzurri lost in a playoff to Sweden and ended up missing the World Cup after a combination of poor managing and poor play when it counted. This team would’ve likely been in the conversation of favorites, but failed to even qualify.\n\nNetherlands\n\nNot only did the Netherlands not qualify for the World Cup, they missed the 2016 European Championships. If you are a follower of the Dutch, you may remember that Robin Van Persie scored the second most famous goal from the 2014 World Cup.\n\nChile\n\nQualifying in South America is not easy, as there are few spots and a lot of great teams. Unfortunately, Alexis Sanchez and Arturo Vidal could not carry all the weight, so the coastal nation bit the bullet and missed out on the fun.\n\nGhana\n\nIt is only fitting that with the US missing the tournament, Ghana would, too. Team USA ended up playing this African nation in the last few tournaments, but they were unable to succeed in the African Qualifiers, missing out this time around.\n\nCan’t Miss Matches\n\nAll times are EDT\n\nRussia vs Saudi Arabia\n\nThursday, June 14, 10 A.M.\n\nThe opening match of the tournament, almost a little preview for the future, as neither of these two teams really stand a chance at winning it all, and it only gets better from here.\n\nSpain vs Portugal\n\nFriday, June 15, 1 P.M.\n\nThe two neighboring nations battle for control of the group. The winner almost guarantees themselves a spot in the knockout round.\n\nArgentina vs Iceland\n\nSaturday, June 16, 8 A.M.\n\nA special moment as Iceland plays their first ever World Cup game. Their welcoming party includes the right to play one of the greatest players ever in Lionel Messi.\n\nArgentina vs Croatia\n\nThursday, June 21, 1 P.M.\n\nThis can relabeled “Luka Modric vs Lionel Messi.” Keep your eye on Modric’s ability to create against a quality opponent. This is a battle for the control of Group D.\n\nSweden vs Mexico\n\nWednesday, June 27, 9 A.M.\n\nThis should be a back-and-forth battle for the second-place spot behind Germany. Should have have the feeling of a knockout round game.\n\nEngland vs Belgium\n\nThursday, June 28, 1 P.M.\n\nThe group winner may be determined through this game. Two favorites lacking recent success should be battling for the better seed in the knockout round. This has the makings for a classic.\n\nTrivia\n\n– Only 8 countries have ever won the World Cup (it has been held 20 times), but a different country has won each of the last five.\n\n– Those 8 World Cup countries have only either come from Europe or South America.\n\n– The last non-European, non-South America teams to make the semifinals were Turkey and South Korea, who advanced that far in 2002.\n\n– Germany’s Thomas Müller leads all active players with 11 World Cup goals. The all-time leader is Germany’s Miroslav Klose, who set the record at 16 at the last World Cup.\n\n– The host country last won the World Cup in 1978 (Argentina). The only host country to not advance to the knockout rounds was South Africa in 2010.\n\n– The Republic of Ireland made the quarterfinals in 1990 without winning a game in regulation, drawing their 3 matches in the group stage and beating Romania on penalties in the Round of 16.\n\n– This is the first World Cup that will utilize Virtual-Assistant-Referees, which can be used to review a number of calls.\n\nWorld Cup Final Prediction\n\nBelgium over Spain, 2-1\n\nMake your own predictions by playing the PFS World Cup Prediction Challenge.\n\nHYPE\n\nHow about a montage from the last World Cup to get your blood pumping?"
