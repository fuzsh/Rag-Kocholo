        "text": "The Netherlands suffered a 2-0 defeat away to Iceland who maintained their perfect start to Euro 2016 qualifying thanks to Gylfi Sigurdsson’s first-half double.\n\nSigurdsson had been a doubt with an injury sustained against Latvia on Friday but the Swansea City midfielder featured from the start and was worth his weight in gold for the hosts.\n\nHe scored his first goal in the 10th minute of the Group A game when he converted a spot kick conceded by Stefan de Vrij, who fouled Birkir Bjarnason inside the penalty area.\n\nSigurdsson then doubled his tally three minutes before halftime when he fired home after being quickest to react to a loose ball after the Dutch failed to clear a corner.\n\nThe Netherlands had never lost to Iceland, having won nine out of 10 previous matches – the other was a 1-1 draw in Reykjavik in 1982 – but could not break down their defence.\n\nIn another match, Bosnia and Belgium drew 1-1 after midfielder Radja Nainggolan cancelled out Edin Dzeko’s first-half opener for the Balkan nation on Monday.\n\nA clinical strike by Dzeko gave Bosnia the lead against the run of play before Nainggolan equalised thanks to a blunder by keeper Asmir Begovic, who had kept his team afloat in the first half.\n\nMeanwhile, in the early kick-off, the Czech Republic cruised to a 4-2 win over Kazakhstan as the visitors maintained their perfect start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.\n\nThe Czechs, having already earned the more exalted scalps of the Netherlands and Turkey in Group A, scored twice in each half to make it three wins from three in a game they dominated from the start.\n\nResults:\n\nKazakhstan 2 – 4 Czech Republic\n\nIceland 2 – 0 Netherlands\n\nLatvia 1 – 1 Turkey\n\nAndorra 1 – 4 Israel\n\nBosnia-Herzegovina 1 – 1 Belgium\n\nWales 2 – 1 Cyprus\n\nCroatia 6 – 0 Azerbaijan\n\nMalta 0 – 1 Italy\n\nNorway 2 – 1 Bulgaria"
