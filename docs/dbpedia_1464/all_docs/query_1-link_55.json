        "text": "My passion for Iceland began in 2008 when the country reached the Olympic Handball final in Beijing. I thought: How can a country of this size achieve this feat? I called my brother and repeated the question to him. When I was turning a business professional and studying/living management, I realized that these feats have to do with method, process, discipline and vision. And it’s really the case that this text wants to show.\n\nThen football becoming serious in the country. The Uefa Euro 2016 arrived and Iceland dit great things again, reaching the quarterfinals.\n\nAnd the positive saga did not stop there, with a historic qualification for the 2018 World Cup. The tie with Argentina in the FIFA World Cup was not a coincidence recently.\n\nMy curiosity on the country has not leave my head. And the idea of ​​understanding how this has to do with management and planning does not either.\n\nIn 2017 I reached out one of the players of the Icelandic National Team to learn more about this phenomenon. And he promptly ran into the chat. Below is the text and all the talk I had with Birkir Már Sævarsson. The country had no tradition in football and created a planned structure, with schools and “soccer houses” scattered throughout the territory, in addition to developing many coaches and teachers with official Uefa's licenses.\n\nI hope you enjoy and get some ideas of his thoughts for your life and for your work.\n\nLet's go together.\n\n______\n\nImagine that you were born in love with football, start taking good steps in childhood sports, become a pro at age 19 and spend the rest of your career preparing to play in a World Cup. It looks like the story of any top-level Brazilian, Argentinean or German athlete, but it represents the trajectory of an Icelandic who has built almost a fairy tale in his country’s football.\n\nIt turns out that making Iceland qualify for the World Cup was not an easy task (the tiny country has only 332,000 inhabitants and has never had a long tradition in the sport). Yes, it was not. It is a fact that the Icelanders have made it to the 2018 World Cup and have a chance to continue the writing of the fairy tale started in 2016 …\n\nBirkir Már Sævarsson is the fifth player with more CAPS for the Nordic team (79 in total) and was on the pitch in the mythical campaign that reached the quarter-finals of Uefa Euro 2016 in France. The firm and serious defender of the Hammarby IF of Sweden, played all the matches of that championship and carried in the back the responsibility to face Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) in one game and Sterling (England) in another. And that was not a problem at all.\n\nThe Euro was not just that marvel for Birkir, as he is commonly called in Iceland. He scored a own goal, in a match against Hungary. But nothing that shook the morale of the seasoned player.\n\nHe knows what football and the spectacular 2016 campaign means to the Icelandic people and how the results on the field represent much more than the sport. The party outside the pitch is also a source of pride, which recognizes that Icelandic fans have become famous all over the planet for the frenzy played in France.\n\nFootball is by far the most popular sport in Iceland. I can say that it has been a kind of symbol of unity for the Icelandic people as they faced the economic and political crisis in Iceland in the last decade. Now we have fantastic (and world famous) fans that always appear in games at home and even abroad.\n\nAs a team record holder for Iceland, what is it like to be living this new phase of football in the country?\n\nIt is fantastic to have been able to take part in the uprising of Icelandic football these last few years. When I started playing for Iceland we were not getting good results, nobody was coming to the games and it went fast downhill. But now we are one of the best teams in the world and are still improving. And next up is a new Stadium in Reykjavik so there are very exciting years we have ahead of us.\n\nWhat is the country’s relationship with football (people, media, fans)? What is the number 1 sport in Iceland?\n\nFootball is by far the most popular sport in Iceland. Football has been a sort of a symbol of unity for the Icelandic people as they faced the economical and political crisis in Iceland in the last decade. Now we have fantastic (and world famous) fans who always show up at games at home and even abroad.\n\nAnd What about your personal relationship with this sport?\n\nI’m born into a football family so football has always been close to me. My father was a pretty good player in his younger years and his brother was once the goalkeeper for the Icelandic national team. We even got to play some games together.\n\nHave you ever imagine you would see Iceland qualify for the Euro and World Cup?\n\nIf you had asked me this 10 years ago I would say it’s impossible. But when Lars Lagerback took over and the guys who had played U21 EURO came up to the A team something started to happen. And in the 2014 World Cup qualifying we started to believe that we could do it. We didn’t make it to Brazil but in that qualifier we got valuable experience and since then we have shown that we belong in the big tournaments.\n\nDo you remember the environment in the locker room after qualifying for the Euro and the Cup? And the reaction of the Icelandic people?\n\nIt was crazy! Everybody was so happy. We went to downtown Reykjavik, where all of Reykjavik (it seemed) had come together in a square, and celebrated with the fans. And Reykjavik centrum was buzzing the whole night.\n\nHow old were you when you started playing and how was the routine? Did you do any other sport in your childhood? Who was your main motivator to play football?\n\nI started training with my team, Valur, when I was 5 years old. I had around 3–4 trainings every week and then I played football with my friends and in the school every time we had the chance. My parents motivated me and helped me along the way and then I had self a motivation to become a professional football player. I also played handball and basketball as a child along with football.\n\nDo you remember having some childhood idol? Or some sportsman you admire a lot these days?\n\nMy father and my uncle (dads brother) were my biggest idols in football as a child. But international I was a big fan of Romario and Pep Guardiola mostly because I love Barcelona and I always supported Brazil in the World Cup.\n\nWho was the best player you played together? And the most difficult to face in the field?\n\nThe best players I have played with are Eidur Gudjohnsen and Gylfi Sigurdsson. I can’t really choose between those two because they are both fantastic football players. The most difficult player I have faced is Cristiano Ronaldo for obvious reasons :)\n\nFor the vast majority of Icelandic players, is it possible to be just an athlete or do you have to have another profession?\n\nMost of Icelandic football players play as amateurs or semi-professional because the salary in Iceland is not enough so that you can only play football. Most either study or work beside playing football.\n\nWhat’s the hardest memory you have of the sport?\n\nI think that, even though it didn’t matter in the end, the own goal against Hungary in the EUROS last year was the worst moment in my career. We were winning 1–0 and would go through to the 1/16 finals with a win but in the end I put the ball into my own goal which was devastating for me at that moment.\n\nWhat to expect from football in Iceland in the next few years?\n\nWe will continue to bring up good players and challenge for the big tournaments. I’m sure of that.\n\nAnd what is your expectation for next year’s World Cup?\n\nWe are not in the WC just to participate. We want to go to every game to win it and we have shown the last few years that we can beat anyone on a good day. Then we will see where that will take us.\n\nIn social networks you seem to be a very calm guy, who enjoys family, friends … this has to do with his philosophy of life?\n\nI think it’s safe to say that I am a family guy. I love spending time with my family and friends and for me that comes before football. Someone, I don’t remember who, once said that he would rather be remembered as a good human being than a good football player and I think that describes my life philosophy.\n\nIn Brazil, players end up becoming very young celebrities. What is the society’s relationship with athletes in Iceland and\n\nSweden?\n\nIn Iceland it’s very laid back. Football players are known inside the football world but there are no stars in Iceland. Here in Sweden it’s a little different. Players who play for the big clubs in Stockholm and Malmö for example are like mini celebrities in the country and get recognized on the street.\n\nIn the great centers of football, it is fundamental to have a businessman or a company that takes care of your career. How does this work in Nordic football?\n\nI think most professional players in the Nordic countries have an agent to take care of business. Of course not everybody but the vast majority has.\n\nWhat do you design for your career in the coming years? And you already have plans when you retire?\n\nRight now I have no idea what’s going to happen with me. My contract with Hammarby goes out in december and I haven’t signed for a new club yet. The only thing I know is that I will be leaving Hammarby. And I have no plans on retiring. I want to play football for as long as my body can do it and I think it is fun. And at some point I will move back to Iceland to play for Valur, the club I grew up in.\n\nWhat is it like to live in another country? Does Sweden’s culture closely resemble that of Iceland? And how was Norway?\n\nI’m very grateful to have gotten the chance to live and work in another country than Iceland. You both grow as a person and a football player by trying something new and different. But having said that both Sweden and Norway has a very similar culture as Iceland. I think all the nordic countries are very alike.\n\nWhat do you like to do outside the professional football environment?\n\nMostly I hang out with my wife and children and we do some activities. But I also love music and whenever I am alone I listen to rock music. I also have plans to learn how to play the guitar as soon as I find the time to do it.\n\nHow about your brother starting to build a career?\n\nI’m very happy with that he has come up through the youth teams of Valur and up to the A team. He just signed a new 2 year contract with them a few days ago and hopefully he will get the chance next season. And I have a little dream that we will someday play together at Hlidarendi Stadium, the home pitch of Valur."
