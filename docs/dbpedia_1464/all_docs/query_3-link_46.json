        "text": "I see the prices of your players are low like mine was in Stjarnan, until year 2028. Something happened after that, league reputation was rose before so I don't know what happened but prices of players go to normal level, like in other non Icelandic clubs. Maybe 2nd team in league rise enough. I also reported this problem to SI. And I need to say you have a nice story, I'm following.\n\nThanks Good to know you enjoy this save.\n\nHow much did the value of your players increase to when you reached 2028? It is a bit annoying that my players value isn't very high.\n\nThe only other Icelandic team looking good at the moment is Valur and they don't ever get far in Europe, so maybe if they start doing well in Europe it will help our league boost alot & help boost my players values.\n\nHey Kerguelen. I've been loving this story so far! c:\n\nI've been looking to try this sort of thing (take a club in a smaller Euro nation and bring them into domestic and eventually European domination). What nation do you suggest I do? o:\n\nAlso, what nations have you set as Playable/View-Only? I'm just curious, because I want to know how you've ran the game so long without it getting bloated. xD\n\nThanks .\n\nI would suggest any Scandinavian team. Maybe Rosenborg or Molde from Norway, as they're fairly small, but decent teams.\n\nThe nations I have loaded are England up to league 2, France up to national, Germany up to second division, Holland up to jupiler league, Iceland up to first division, Italy up to serie b and Spain up to liga adelante. In total 17 leagues from 7 nations, all set as playable.\n\nView attachment 426529\n\nPre-Season\n\nA short and fairly indifferent pre-season.\n\nA few new signings made.\n\nPre-Season Fixtures\n\nThor Akureyri 0-4 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur\n\nGrindavik 0-4 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur\n\nReynir S. 0-7 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur\n\nKeflavik 5-2 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur\n\nOur pre-season started off well, but ended very disappointingly with a 5-2 loss to Keflavik. Had that loss been in the league I would have gone ballistic.\n\nPlayers In\n\nView attachment 426528\n\nOur first signing is forward 'Juan Manuel Paredes' who comes in from Paraguayan side 'Sportivo Luqueno' for a fee of ?15K. He will be used as a rotation/backup option.\n\nView attachment 426527\n\nOur 2nd signing is young defensive midfielder 'Arnar Johannesson' who comes in from 'Vikingur O' for a fee of ?20k. Despite his less than impressive 2 star potential rating, I believe he could become a good player for us and have taken the chance with him.\n\nView attachment 426526\n\nOur 3rd signing is the key one. American midfielder 'Ryan Arce' comes in on a free transfer & will be an important player in the first team.\n\nTransfer Center\n\nView attachment 426525\n\nNot too much in the outgoing section. A few players going out on loan & we sell 'Samuel Kari Fridjonsson' to 'Valerenga' for a fee of just under ?250K. He's 28 and was a rotational player, so I've decided to let him go and free up some space for a young player to get a chance.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nThe start of the upper league cup. How will we do?\n\nWe play 'Ajax' in the first knockout round of the Europa League. Can we record a surprise victory?\n\nView attachment 426259\n\nFebruary\n\nA disappointing start to the new season.\n\nWe fail to even put up a fight against Ajax which annoyed me.\n\nFebruary Fixtures\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 3-1 IBV Vestmannaeyjar (Upper League Cup Group Stage)\n\nView attachment 426256\n\nAn expected result against our first division opponents. New signing 'Juan Manuel Parades' gets 2 goals on his debut.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 0-2 Ajax (Europa League 1st Knockout Round / First Round)\n\nView attachment 426252\n\nA very poor performance means the tie is pretty much over before we even travel to Holland. We didn't even create a decent chance all much.\n\nStjarnan 1-3 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Upper League Cup Group Stage)\n\nView attachment 426248\n\nA good performance here as we run out 3-1 winners. 'Juan Manuel Parades' is looking very impressive as he gets on the score sheet again.\n\nAjax 1-0 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Europa League 1st Knockout Round / Second Leg)\n\nAjax win 3-0 on aggregate.\n\nView attachment 426245\n\nThe tie was pretty much over after our disappointing first leg, and we didn't do much better here as we lose 1-0. We lose 3-0 on aggregate.\n\nUpper League Cup Group C Table\n\nView attachment 426243\n\nWe are top of our group in the upper league cup so far. Our group is actually really easy, with 'Stjarnan' the only decent team we have to face until the knockout rounds.\n\nPlayer Of The Month\n\nView attachment 426242\n\nNew signing 'Juan Manuel Parades' has made a very positive start to his career with us, scoring 3 goals, including 2 in his debut.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nMore games in the upper league group stages.\n\nWill we make any more signings?\n\nView attachment 425815\n\nMarch\n\nA better month.\n\nWe destroy a couple of teams.\n\nMarch Fixtures\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Fjallabyggdar 0-3 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Upper League Cup Group Stage)\n\nView attachment 425814\n\nA good performance here as we win 3-0.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 6-1 Bi/Bolungarvik (Upper League Cup Group Stage)\n\nView attachment 425813\n\nA brilliant performance as we win 6-1. Both 'Juan Manuel Paredes' & 'Olafur Aron Throvaldsson' scored 2 goals.\n\nHandknattleiksfelag Kopavogs 0-6 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Upper League Cup Group Stage)\n\nView attachment 425812\n\nAn even better performance as we win 6-0 away to our first division opponents. 'Juan Manuel Paredes' is looking like being one of my best signings as he's again on the score-sheet.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 1-1 Ithrottafelag Reykjavikur (Upper League Cup Group Stage)\n\nView attachment 425811\n\nA poor performance to end the month, as we are held to a draw by newly promoted 'Ithrottafelag Reykjavik'. We had enough chances to win comfortably but we failed miserably in front of goal.\n\nUpper League Cup Group C Table\n\nView attachment 425810\n\nWe are through to the knockout rounds with a game left, and need 1 point to confirm we win the group.\n\nPlayer Of The Month\n\nView attachment 425809\n\n'Juan Manuel Paredes' was our best player for the 2nd month running. He's really looking like a brilliant signing.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update Do we manage to win the upper league cup?\n\nView attachment 425701\n\nApril\n\nWe win the Upper League Cup.\n\nWere performing back at the level I expect.\n\nApril Fixtures\n\nFram 0-3 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Upper League Cup Group Stage)\n\nView attachment 425700 View attachment 425699\n\nIn what was my 500th game in charge of 'KR' we convincingly win 3-0 against Fram.\n\nView attachment 425698\n\nWe topped our group, finishing 5 points ahead of 2nd placed Fram.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 3-1 Keflavik (Upper League Cup Quarter Finals)\n\nView attachment 425697\n\nA 'Vigfus Einarsson' hattrick sends us into the semi-finals.\n\nValur 1-3 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Upper League Cup Semi Finals)\n\nView attachment 425696\n\nWe beat Valur to go into the finals. We were mostly in control even before our opponents went down to 10 men.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 5-0 Fram (Upper League Cup Finals)*****FINALS*****\n\nView attachment 425695\n\n***** We destroy Fram as we add another 'Upper League Cup' to our name. We showed our goal-scoring quality in the team as we had a different name on the score sheet for each goal.\n\nPlayer Of The Month\n\nView attachment 425694\n\nTall central defender 'Lars Martinez Olsson' has been our best player this month putting in some very impressive performances.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nWe play Valur in the Icelandic Champions Cup. Do we win another trophy?\n\nDo we get off to a good start in the league?\n\nView attachment 424923\n\nMay\n\nAnother 'Icelandic Champions Cup' lost to Valur on Penalty's.\n\nOur Premier League season starts well though.\n\nMay Fixtures\n\nValur 1-1 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Champions Cup)*****FINALS*****\n\nValur win 5-4 on penalty's.\n\nView attachment 424922\n\nAnother 'Icelandic Champions Cup' penalty loss to 'Valur'. In fact we missed 2 penalty's (thanks Daniel Helgesson ) one in open play & one in the shootout. Looks like penalty shootouts are basically a guaranteed loss for my team.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 7-0 Tindastoll (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 424921\n\nWhat a way to bounce back from our 'Icelandic Champions Cup' disappointment. Newly promoted 'Tindastoll' are probably wishing they stayed in the first division after this battering.\n\nKeflavik 1-3 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 424920\n\nA good performance away against a decent Keflavik side. Central defender 'Grimur Bjorn Atlason' seem's to be getting on the score-sheet fairly often these days.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 3-1 Haukar (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 424913\n\nA decent performance against a decent side. Not much to say about this game.\n\nIcelandic Premier League Table\n\nView attachment 424918\n\nWe have started the league campaign as I had expected with 3 wins from 3 games.\n\nPlayer Of The Month\n\nView attachment 424915\n\n'Grimur Bjorn Atlason' has been our best player this month, and has been very good both defensively and going forward.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nA very short month with only 2 games, as Iceland are representing in the Euro's.\n\nOnly 1 league game will be played, the other game will be a cop game.\n\nView attachment 424330\n\nJune\n\nA short and awful month.\n\nWe are out of the Icelandic Cup already.\n\nJune Fixtures\n\nFram 3-2 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Cup 3rd Round)\n\nView attachment 424328\n\nDue to pretty much all my first team playing for their respective countries in the EURO's I was forced to play a reserve squad. We went into halftime 2-0 up and everything was going well, then we just collapsed and ended up somehow losing 3-2. I was disgusted with our 2nd half showing.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 3-2 Knattspyrnufelag Akureyrar (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 424325\n\nWe struggle to beat a relegation candidate at home which is not good enough. This is the kind of game we should easily be winning. We had all our first team players back and most of them played in this game which is why i'm so disappointed.\n\nIcelandic Premier League Table\n\nView attachment 424323\n\nDespite our indifferent form so far this season, we still have 4 wins from 4 games in the league, and are top on goal difference.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nA busy month.\n\nHopefully we can improve, as the way things are going it's only a matter of time before we start dropping silly points in the league.\n\nView attachment 424267\n\nJuly\n\nA perfect month.\n\nWe're playing amazing football.\n\nI bring in 1 new player & a few backup players leave.\n\nJuly Fixtures\n\nValur 0-3 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 424266\n\nA very good performance & win away to Valur. All 3 of our goals came from defenders.\n\nFjolnir 1-5 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 424265\n\nAfter looking poor in the first 20 minutes and going behind early in the game, we turn things around with an amazing second half performance and end up winning 5-1.\n\nBreidablik 0-5 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 424264\n\nWe carry on where we left off in the 2nd half of our last game and steamroller a decent 'Breidablik' side. All goals came in the first half and we just relaxed in the second half.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 8-0 TNS (Champions League 2nd Qualifying Round / First Leg)\n\nView attachment 424263\n\nWe completely annihilate the 'Welsh' champions. Both 'Vigfus Einarsson' & 'Olafur Aron Thorvaldsson' managed to record hat-tricks.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 5-0 Ithrottafelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 424262\n\n'Ithrottafelag Reykjavikur' become the 4th team in a row to concede at least 5 goals to us. We really are looking amazing right now.\n\nTNS 0-2 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Champions League 2nd Qualifying Round / Second Leg)\n\nWe win 10-0 on aggregate.\n\nView attachment 424261\n\nWe done all the hard work (if you could call it that) in the first leg, and could just relax in the away tie. We win 10-0 on aggregate.\n\nVikingur O. 1-3 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 424260\n\nA comfortable 3-1 win for us. New signing 'Olli Nygard' gets on the score-sheet in his debut. He played very well and ended up winning the man of the match award.\n\nGrasshoppers 1-3 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Champions League 3rd Qualifying Round / First Leg)View attachment 424259\n\nA very good win against a team considered slightly better than me. We were dominant throughout and fully deserved to win 3-1. I'm very confident about the 2nd leg. (I wasn't feeling confident about this tie before kick-off)\n\nIcelandic Premier League Table\n\nView attachment 424258\n\nWe are currently top and 3 points ahead of 2nd placed Valur.\n\nPlayer Of The Month\n\nView attachment 424257\n\n'Juan Manuel Parades' has continued to be brilliant, and was once more the best player of the month.\n\nTransfer Center\n\nView attachment 424254\n\nOur new signing 'Olli Nigard' come's in from Finnish side 'FC Inter Turku' fora compensation fee of ?400. Yes four hundred pounds. What a bargain he could prove to be.\n\nView attachment 424250\n\nI terminated the contract of 'Arnor Ingi Traustason' as he's in his final year of his contract, 31 years old, and complaining about the lack of first team football.\n\nMidfielder 'Steinar Gunnarsson' leaves for a fee of ?235K and heads of to Italian Serie B side 'Cremonese'.\n\nWe let a few players leave on loan to get some first team football.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nCan we keep up our brilliant form?\n\nWill we make the group stage of the Champions League?\n\nWill we get a good youth intake this year?\n\nView attachment 423797\n\nAugust\n\nOur frustrating indifferent form is back.\n\nWe fail to make the Champions League group stage & have to settle for Europa League.\n\nAugust Fixtures\n\nStjarnan 0-2 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 423795\n\nNot the best of performance's here, and our shooting was awful. The main thing is we still managed to pick up the 3 points we came here for.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 3-0 Grasshoppers (Champions League 3rd Qualifying Round / Second Leg)\n\nWe win 6-1 on aggregate.\n\nView attachment 423794\n\nA brilliant performance, just like in the first leg. We win 6-1 on aggregate. I had expected to struggle to get past this team, but we didn't have many problems at all.\n\nHaukar 1-2 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 423793\n\nWe were dominant throughout the match, and I don't know how we only won 2-1. It really could and should have been 5 or 6 goals for us.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 0-0 Keflavik (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 423792\n\nA very disappointing draw at home to Keflavik. Good thing Valur lost their game otherwise they would have only been a point behind us.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 1-2 Petrolul (Champions League Playoff Round / First Leg)\n\nView attachment 423790\n\nAwful, Awful, Awful. No excuses for losing this game. It's going to be hard to get through now.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 5-0 Vikingur O. (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 423789\n\nA very good performance as we smash relegation threatened 'Vikingur O'.\n\nPetrolul 1-1 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Champions League Playoff Round / Second Leg)\n\nPetrolul wil 3-2 on aggregate.\n\nView attachment 423788\n\nMaybe the less said about this the better. We should have made the Champions League group stages, yet we have to settle for the Europa League group stages.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 4-2 Valur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 423787\n\nA very important win, possibly the most important win of the season. Had we lost Valur would have gone top, although we would still of had a game in hand. We won so we go 4 points clear at the top with a game in hand. I doubt we will fail to win the title from here even with our inconsistent form.\n\nIcelandic Premier League Table\n\nView attachment 423786\n\nWe are 4 points clear at the top with a game in hand over 2nd placed Valur.\n\nPlayer Of The Month\n\nView attachment 423784\n\nCentral midfielder 'Daniel Helgesson' was our best player this month.\n\nEuropa League Group Stage Draw\n\nView attachment 423783 View attachment 423781 View attachment 423797 View attachment 423780\n\nInter Milan........................SC Heerenveen..............Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur..........Atromitos\n\nPretty much what I expected from a Europa League group. 'Inter' will definitely win this group, while 'Atromitos' will almost certainly finish bottom. It will be between ourselves & 'SC Heerenveen' (Who are probably slightly better than us) to see who makes it to the knockout rounds.\n\nYouth Intake\n\nI'm not sure what's happening here. Our youth intakes have just been awful in recent years. Again no-one had a potential of more than 2 stars and the players with the 2 star potential still looked awful. All trials were terminated again.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nDespite having a relatively poor season so far, surely we won't fail to win the league.\n\nView attachment 423286\n\nSeptember\n\nOur frustrating form is still around.\n\nWe still win the league though.\n\n'Juan Manuel Paredes' to miss this month with injury.\n\nSeptember Fixtures\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 1-1 Fylkir (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 423285\n\nA very poor performance as we struggle to draw with relegation threatened Fylkir. Had it not been for a deflected late goal we would have lost.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Akureyrar 0-5 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 423284\n\nThis performance was 1000% better as we smash a mid-table side. Now why can't we always perform like this?\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 3-0 Breidablik (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 423283\n\nA good performance here, especially in the first half as we run out 3-0 winners against a decent side.\n\nTindastoll 1-6 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 423282\n\nWe smash struggling 'Tindastoll' as we edge closer to the title. 'Olafur Aron Thorvaldsson' & 'Atli Sigurjonsson' both score 2 goals in this victory.\n\nInter Milan 2-1 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Europa League Group J)\n\nView attachment 423281\n\nWe were unlucky to come away with nothing against Inter.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 0-0 Stjarnan (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 423279\n\nHad we of won this the league would have been confirmed. However we were awful in front of goal and never looked like scoring.\n\nKnattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur 3-0 Fjolnir (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 423278\n\nWe confirm that the league is ours for the 6th year running with a 3-0 win over Fjolnir.\n\nFylkir 1-1 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 423277\n\nFylkir score with their only shot of their game as we draw with them again. Our domination of the game came to nothing.\n\nIthrottafelag Reykjavikur 0-1 Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (Icelandic Premier League)\n\nView attachment 423276\n\nDespite completely dominating the game and having enough decent chances to win 11-0 we only manage a 1-0 against the team who finished bottom of the league.\n\nIcelandic Premier League Table\n\nView attachment 423275\n\nWe win the league by 7 points, but I still think things could have gone alot better for us if we were more consistent.\n\nPlayer Of The Month\n\nView attachment 423274\n\n'Indridi Thorlaksson' was our best player this month.\n\nWhat To Expect In The Next Update\n\nA review of this season."
