        "text": "At the full time whistle, the easy verdict was already in: England’s “shock” loss to Iceland was the worst in their history.\n\n“That was the worst performance I’ve ever seen from an England team, ever,” legendary English striker Alan Shearer told the BBC.\n\n“The worst defeat in our history,” record-setting former England forward Gary Lineker tweeted, “England beaten by a country with more volcanoes than professional footballers.”\n\n“Unless you tell me that the Faroe Islands has beaten Brazil, I would tell you that this is probably the biggest upset of all time,” noted soccer hater Tony Kornheiser added on PTI.\n\nWhile the blistering hot takes condemned the English defeat, look a little deeper and you’ll see that Iceland’s win wasn’t all that shocking.\n\nIn the group stage, England was a strategic mess as they managed draws against Russia and Slovakia and only beat Wales by ditching tactics all together, throwing three strikers into the fray and grabbing a 92nd-minute miracle goal.\n\nIceland, meanwhile, forged themselves into a well-oiled machine by beating tournament dark horses Austria and grabbing gutsy draws against Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal and tournament darlings Hungary.\n\nDeploying two banks of four extremely disciplined defenders, Iceland sat deep, frustrated teams through sheer hard work and broke fast on the counter-attack to score goal after amazing goal.\n\nGiven Iceland’s amazing run, you’d think that England’s manager Roy Hodgson would want to scout Iceland in person to find a tactical weakness England could exploit. Nope, not Hodgson. In an amazing show of arrogance, Hodgson passed on the opportunity to watch Iceland beat Austria and instead went sightseeing in Paris with his assistant coach Ray Lewington.\n\nWhile the sightseeing trip looks especially bad in retrospect, it is indicative of Hodgson’s terrible reign as England manager.\n\nAppointed in 2012 because he was the best Englishman available (and the English Football Association didn’t want to hire a foreign manager), Hodgson’s first major test was the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. England got bounced in the group stage after picking up a single point in a dour 0-0 draw with Costa Rica.\n\nFollowing that ignominious World Cup exit, Hodgson somehow kept his job and promised to forge a new England team with a focus on youth.\n\nGone were stalwarts such as captain John Terry and in came a core of young players including Tottenham striker Harry Kane and Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling.\n\nAt first blush, Hodgson’s plan seemed to work. England went 10-0 qualifying for Euro 2016.\n\nHowever, Hodgson’s new “young” England team were still reliant on a quickly aging Wayne Rooney and only picked up all those points because they were in a terrible qualifying group. The group was so bad, in fact, no team in the qualifying group won a knockout-round game in the Euros.\n\nIn comparison, Iceland were thrown into a qualifying group with powerhouse Netherlands and perennial challengers Turkey and Czech Republic. Against all odds, Iceland beat the Netherlands twice on their way to qualifying for their first major international tournament.\n\nThe achievement was a long time in the making. For years, the tiny country of roughly 330,000 people invested in coaching and youth team training and rose from being ranked No. 133 in the 2012 FIFA World Ranking to No. 34 at the start of Euro 2016.\n\nThus, when the two teams met Monday, it was not a case of big bad England vs. tiny underdog Iceland.\n\nIt was the case of a long-fading English team getting what was coming to them at the hands of a well-constructed and in-form Iceland team.\n\nNo wonder Hodgson resigned immediately after the match in a well-prepared speech."
