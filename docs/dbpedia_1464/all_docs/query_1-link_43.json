But Nigeria stuck with its patient passing game, and it paid off in a far superior second half.\n\nIn the 49th minute, Victor Moses raced down the sideline and sent a cross into the box for Ahmed Musa. He controlled it nicely with his first touch, then used his second to slam it home.\n\n[UP NEXT: Follow our live coverage of Switzerland vs. Serbia]\n\nMusa nearly got a second when his shot caromed off the top bar. Then a moment later, in the 75th minute, he latched onto a long ball, beat a defender and then the keeper, and poked the ball into an unguarded net.\n\n“I have to thank my teammates and the coach who believed in me,” Musa said after the match. “We have to focus on the last game because that’s more important than today’s win.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
