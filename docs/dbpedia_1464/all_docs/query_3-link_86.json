        "text": "Robert Tressell 19/02/2021\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson is a genius.\n\nWith 5 goals and 7 assists in 29 games this season, our Icelandic talisman is clearly our Player of the Season so far. After being played out of position last season, he’s getting back to his brilliant best of the 2018-19 season, where he got a remarkable 14 goals and 7 assists in 41 games.\n\nIndeed, over his Everton career, he’s managed 28 goals and 22 assists in 139 games. That’s slightly better than 1 goal (scored or assisted) every 3 games. Quite a remarkable return.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbout these ads\n\nOther players in his position or similar this season include:\n\nFernandes at Man Utd [£55M fee - 21 goals and 12 assists in 36 games]\n\nHavertz at Chelsea [£80M fee – 5 goals and 6 assists in 26 games]\n\nBarkley at Aston Villa [4 goals and 1 assist in 16 games]\n\nLoftus-Cheek at Fulham [1 goal in 21 games]\n\nDe Bruyne at Man City [3 goals and 15 assists in 24 games]\n\nMaddison at Leicester City [10 goals and 10 assists in 31 games]\n\nMount at Chelsea [3 goals and 4 assists in 23 games]\n\nAnd the picture is much the same across Europe’s big leagues.\n\nFascinating statistics, eh?\n\nAnyway, for those about to explode with rage, I don’t actually think Sigurdsson is our best player but I did want to highlight his important contribution — especially when played in his correct, specialist position alongside people who move faster than a potato.\n\nHe’s not in the same league as Fernandes or De Bruyne, clearly, and he’s behind Maddison too. However, from an end-product point of view, he’s not doing too badly at all. Which leads me to my point...\n\nWe need to replace Sigurdsson in the first team with someone just as skilful but more dynamic in order to improve. Unfortunately, there aren’t tonnes of options for this position. Over the years, I’ve expected Loftus-Cheek to mature into a dynamic, goalscoring midfielder in this position but, now 25, he has only 10 Premier League goals and 8 assists in 98 games. It looks like it might not happen for him now.\n\nFernandes and Havertz show how expensive it is to get a ready-made player in this position and Havertz, talented though he is, has shown how hard the transition is to the Premier League for a young player. He’ll get better though, especially under Tuchel.\n\nAnd then there’s the issue of attracting players to a club without (we expect) Champions League football but with a stadium that would grace the city of Sheffield. This leaves us potentially hunting for players like Draxler (always injured), Isco (overweight and out of form), and Zielinksi who would come with very big wage demands and could end up representing a big loss and drain on the club if it doesn’t work out. I really hope we don’t go down this path. As much as I love James Rodriguez, I don’t think the answer is to buy more players like him.\n\nThe better option might be to dispense with a goalscoring midfielder altogether and go with 3 more agricultural players in midfield (eg, Allan, Davies and Doucouré) in order to free up the full-backs and allow an attacking trio to stay higher up the pitch and get goals .\n\nThis would mean we could go for someone like Pedro Goncalves of Sporting Lisbon who has bagged 14 goals and 2 assists in 17 games this season, but from a more advanced and wider position than Sigurdsson plays. However, that would squeeze out Rodriguez (which may or may not be a good thing).\n\nThe other option is to keep Sigurdsson in his correct position while grooming a very young player such as the Baumgartner of Hoffenheim or Olise of Reading (4 goals and 9 assists – and only 19) or the astonishingly talented Aouchiche of St Etienne (2 goals and 3 assists but only 18).\n\nThe final option is to bite the bullet and pay the likely £40M asking price for Buendia of Norwich (9 goals and 10 assists in 26 Championship games).\n\nThe likes of Leicester City and RB Leipzig, two good role models for us, would probably plump for Goncalves and Olise due to age, mobility and price. Leipzig would definitely not pay £40M for Buendia; Leicester might. I can still see the sense in going for Loftus-Cheek if he is fit and cheap.\n\nWhatever the case, there’s a good chance that Sigurdsson (whether we like it or not) will continue to be an important part of the side until the end of his contract in Summer 2022. Primarily because it's going to be hard to replace him with someone significantly better who complements what we've already got.\n\nShare this article\n\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.
