        "text": "Karim Benzema’s 10th season at the highest level has been the most satisfying of his career. Liberated by the departure of his main rival, Gonzalo Higuaín, for Napoli last summer, the former Lyon player has had a ball with Real Madrid.\n\nThis, at least, is the opinion of Grégory Coupet, the former France and Lyon goalkeeper, who witnessed the 17-year-old Benzema’s debut for Lyon in December 2004. “He’s fully realised his potential,” Coupet says. “To me he has the all-round game, the technique and the mental strength to make him the best French forward right now.”\n\nEven if the numbers seem to indicate otherwise – he scored 24 goals in 51 games for his club during the 2013-14 campaign, compared with 32 in 52 in 2011-12 – he exerts a greater influence on Real’s game than ever before. “He’s become more influential,” Coupet says. “You sense that he’s in a good place. He exudes serenity and confidence.”\n\nAnd this in a role which is markedly different from what is traditionally expected from a classic No9, particularly in his movement up front; something which has not always been counted in his favour with the national team in the past, it should be said. Genuine centre-forwards have always been a scant commodity in France, apart from Just Fontaine and Jean-Pierre Papin.\n\nThat the Lyon-born striker has reached such a level is anything but a surprise for those who have followed him since he joined Lyon when he was nine years old. Even then, it was predicted that he would become “un super-crack”.\n\nCoupet nods when asked if he had already heard about the prodigy before he joined the reserves. In fact, everybody had. A 15-year-old striker who scores close to 40 goals in a single season for the club’s under-16s could hardly go unnoticed. It is said that Gérard Houllier decided against recruiting a third striker to complement Fred and John Carew back then, Lyon’s sporting director, Bernard Lacombe, having told him: “We’ve already got one.”\n\nBenzema’s career started explosively, when he had yet to celebrate his 17th birthday, first with the reserves (12 goals in 14 games), then in Ligue 1, when Paul Le Guen called on him for a 2-0 win over Metz, in which he delivered his first assist. Coupet was one of his team-mates that day. “He was a player apart. Off the field, very discreet, keeping himself to himself, no misdemeanours to speak of. It was a different story on the pitch. Usually, when a youngster gets in the professional squad [Benzema would only sign his first proper contract six months later], he still lacks a few things, be it tactically, in his positioning or in the speed at which he executes his skills. Benzema? Non. His dexterity was impressive.”\n\nBenzema would still have to wait to the end of that year – 6 December 2005 – to score his first senior goal, in a 2-1 win over Rosenborg in the Champions League, and most of his appearances that season came as a substitute. But his progress gathered speed after he scored – in Ajaccio, on 4 March 2006 - the first of his 43 goals in 112 Ligue 1 matches for his home town club, to which he added 12 in 19 in the Champions League.\n\nHoullier’s confidence had been rewarded. The teenager seemed unfazed by his own ascent. In October 2006, against Marseille, thrown on in the hostile atmosphere of the Vélodrome after Fred had suffered an injury early in the game, he rounded off what was a potential title decider by volleying in the visitors’ fourth goal. France could not ignore him any longer. Neither could Europe’s leading clubs.\n\nIf a fitness problem prevented him from answering Raymond Domenech’s first call, in November 2006, he did not have to wait long to celebrate his first cap, awarded in a friendly against Austria on 28 March 2007, when he replaced Djibril Cissé and scored the game’s only goal.\n\nLyon – with whom he had won the French Golden Boot in 2007-08 with 20 goals - despite their domestic successes, was becoming too small a club for a player destined, or so it was thought, to become one of his country’s finest ever strikers.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson had him followed closely for Manchester United, but so did Florentino Pérez, for whom signing the young Frenchman became a “personal project”, which was crowned with success when Lyon accepted a €35m bid (£28.5m) from Real in July 2009.\n\nOpinions differ as to whether Benzema’s progress at Real Madrid, which is beyond discussion when statistics alone are taken into account, proves that the promise he had shown as soon as he joined Lyon has really been fulfilled. There have been slips in his private life which were widely reported in the French media. The influence of his entourage has also been questioned.\n\nLa Liga proved a tough environment to flourish in to start with, though it is true that the preference of his first manager at Real, Manuel Pellegrini, for Gonzalo Higuaín did not advance his cause. A total of nine goals in 33 games in 2009-10 was not the kind of return that Pérez was hoping for. Crucially Pellegrini, not Benzema, was perceived to be the problem and the striker’s career would resume its upward course. And 26 goals in 2010-11, 32 in 2011-12, which enabled him to become the leading French goalscorer in the history of Real Madrid and of La Liga – beating the records of Zinedine Zidane.\n\nIf, like a few others, he found the last season of José Mourinho’s reign at the Bernabéu something of a challenge, he has prospered since Carlo Ancelotti took over, the Italian manager giving him more starts than any of his other players, with the exception of Sergio Ramos. “Ancelotti’s arrival has done him a world of good,” Coupet says. “It seems that he’s more at peace with himself off the pitch too. He’s become a father.” (Benzema’s partner, Chloe De Launay, gave birth to a girl named Melia in February 2014).\n\nAnd he has started to score again for France, after playing 1,222 goalless minutes between June 2012 and October 2013. One of the goals that followed this lean period was a crucial one, bringing Les Bleus back level on aggregate in their play-off against Ukraine, which went some way towards defusing a constant criticism of his “going missing in big games” for a national team that he has a complex relationship with.\n\n“Algeria is my country,” he had said back in 2006, “France is about sport.” He does not sing La Marseillaise (Michel Platini did not either), a trait which has also been used by some not necessarily innocent parties to question his devotion to the national cause.\n\nIf his talent has never been doubted, his commitment has repeatedly. A return of a goal a little over every three games for France is below what should be expected.After having to watch the 2010 World Cup debacle on television, Benzema now has the chance to gain some kind of revenge in Brazil. But even a fan like Coupet believes that it is up to the player to “impose himself, not just as a technical leader, which he is already, but as a leader, full stop, someone who is unquestioned within the group. He must be seen, and heard. In any case I hope that he will sweep everything before him.”\n\nTo which all of France says: amen. Whether Les Bleus achieve anything in Brazil or not will probably hang on the quality of his performances there. Should he carry on in the vein of his best season at Real Madrid, then who knows? Karim Benzema could well be France’s x-factor.\n\nBruno Rodrigues writes for France Football\n\nFollow him here on Twitter\n\nClick here for a tactical analysis of France"
