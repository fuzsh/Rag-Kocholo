Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nEscuintla experiences significant seasonal variation in the perceived humidity.\n\nThe muggier period of the year lasts for 9.6 months, from March 8 to December 27, during which time the comfort level is muggy, oppressive, or miserable at least 70% of the time. The month with the most muggy days in Escuintla is August, with 30.9 days that are muggy or worse.\n\nThe month with the fewest muggy days in Escuintla is February, with 18.4 days that are muggy or worse.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in Escuintla\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in EscuintlamuggyJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%Jan 3060%Jan 3060%100%Sep 19100%Sep 19Mar 870%Mar 870%Dec 2770%Dec 2770%NowNowoppressiveoppressivemuggymuggyhumidhumidmiserablemiserablecomfortablecomfortable\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec Muggy days 19.4d18.4d23.2d27.0d30.1d29.8d30.8d30.9d29.9d30.0d26.8d23.6d\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground.

Those scores are combined into a single hourly composite score, which is then aggregated into days, averaged over all the years in the analysis period, and smoothed.\n\nOur cloud cover score is 10 for fully clear skies, falling linearly to 9 for mostly clear skies, and to 1 for fully overcast skies.\n\nOur precipitation score, which is based on the three-hour precipitation centered on the hour in question, is 10 for no precipitation, falling linearly to 9 for trace precipitation, and to 0 for 0.04 inches of precipitation or more.\n\nOur tourism temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 50Â°F, rising linearly to 9 for 65Â°F, to 10 for 75Â°F, falling linearly to 9 for 80Â°F, and to 1 for 90Â°F or hotter.\n\nOur beach/pool temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 65Â°F, rising linearly to 9 for 75Â°F, to 10 for 82Â°F, falling linearly to 9 for 90Â°F, and to 1 for 100Â°F or hotter.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nTemperatures in Escuintla are sufficiently warm year round that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss the growing season in these terms. We nevertheless include the chart below as an illustration of the distribution of temperatures experienced throughout the year.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in Escuintla\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in EscuintlaJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%100%Jan 1100%Jan 1100%Jul 2100%Jul 2NowNowcomfortablewarmhotsweltering\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature.

Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy experiences some seasonal variation over the course of the year.\n\nThe brighter period of the year lasts for 2.0 months, from February 16 to April 17, with an average daily incident shortwave energy per square meter above 6.2 kWh.

Within 10 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (6,749 feet). Within 50 miles also contains extreme variations in elevation (13,376 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Escuintla is covered by cropland (89%) and trees (11%), within 10 miles by cropland (65%) and trees (35%), and within 50 miles by cropland (33%) and trees (31%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Escuintla, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Escuintla.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Escuintla according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Escuintla is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Escuintla and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nTapachula International Airport (MMTP, 72%, 41 mi, southeast, -167 ft elevation change)\n\nHuehuetenango (MGHT, 12%, 79 mi, east, 5,974 ft elevation change)\n\nGeneral Div P A Angel H Corzo Molina (MMTB, 17%, 104 mi, north, 1,644 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Escuintla and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
