The nearest neighboring Holocene volcanoes are 275 km and 200 km to the southeast and northwest, respectively. El Chicho??n is built on Tertiary siltstone and sandstone, underlain by Cretaceous dolomitic limestone; a 4-km-deep bore hole near the east base of the volcano penetrated this limestone and continued 770 m into a sequence of Jurassic or Cretaceous evaporitic anhydrite and halite. The basement rocks are folded into generally northwest-trending anticlines and synclines. El Chicho??n is built over a small dome-like structure superposed on a syncline, and this structure may reflect cumulative deformation related to growth of a crustal magma reservoir beneath the volcano. The cone of El Chicho??n consists almost entirely of pyroclastic rocks. The pre-1982 cone is marked by a 1200-m-diameter (explosion?) crater on the southwest flank and a 1600-m-diameter crater apparently of similar origin at the summit, a lava dome partly fills each crater. The timing of cone and dome growth is poorly known. Field evidence indicates that the flank dome is older than the summit dome, and K-Ar ages from samples high on the cone suggest that the flank dome is older than about 276,000 years. At least three pyroclastic eruptions have occurred during the past 1250 radiocarbon years. Nearly all of the pyroclastic and dome rocks are moderately to highly porphyritic andesite, with plagioclase, hornblende and clinopyroxene the most common phenocrysts.

Subsequent geologic studies, based on stratigraphic and radiocarbon investigations, showed that at least three explosive eruptions had occurred previously at this volcano. In this paper, we present the result of recent studies on the stratigraphy of the volcano and new radiocarbon ages which show that at least 11 eruptions have taken place at El Chichon in the past 8000 years. Explosive events, most of them producing block-and-ash flow and surge deposits, occurred around 550, 900, 1250, 1500, 1600, 1900, 2000, 2500, 3100, 3700 and 7700 years BP. The juvenile products of these eruptions have a trachyandesitic composition with similar degree of evolution, as evidenced from their SiO2 abundance and depletion in MgO, CaO, TiO2, as well as trace and rare earth elements. This suggests segregation of olivine and orthopyroxene from the melt. Since human settlements in southeast Mexico and Central America can be traced as far back as approximately 2500 years BP, most of these events probably affected human activity. In fact, there are reports of pottery shards and other artifacts in deposits from the eruption of 1250 BP. Pottery fragments in deposits of an eruption that took place 2500 BP are also reported in this paper. Thus, the impact of the volcano on human activities has been frequent, with most of the repose intervals lasting between 100 to 600 years. The impact of the eruptions was probably of greater than local extent, because airfall tephra could reach distant sites and possibly even affect weather. The eruptive history of El Chichon also offers clues in the investigation of the Maya civilization. Several researchers have considered the volcano as an important factor in the answer to some intriguing questions such as the extensive use of volcanic ash in Late Classic Maya ceramics or, of greater importance, the causes of the\n\nGeology of El Chichon volcano, Chiapas, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDuffield, Wendell A.; Tilling, Robert I.; Canul, Rene\n\n1984-03-01\n\nThe (pre-1982) 850-m-high andesitic stratovolcano El ChichÃ³n, active during Pleistocene and Holocene time, is located in rugged, densely forested terrain in northcentral Chiapas, MÃ©xico.

P.; Finnegan, D. L.; Zoller, W. H.; Hart, M. A.; Moyers, J. L.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nAircraft measurements were made of trace gases, atmospheric particles, and condensed acid volatiles in the plume of El Chichon volcano, Chiapas, Mexico, in November 1982. Hydrogen sulfide was the primary gaseous sulfur species in the plume at the time of collection. Concentrations of 28 elements were determined by neutron activation analysis of particulate material from the plume. The volatile elements sulfur, chlorine, arsenic, selenium, bromine, antimony, iodine, tungsten, and mercury were enriched relative to bulk pyroclastic material by factors of 60 to 20,000. Arsenic, antimony, and selenium were associated predominantly with small (not greater than 3 micrometer) particles. Calcium and sodium were present almost exclusively on larger particles and aluminum and manganese were bimodally distributed. Ashladen particulate material injected into the stratosphere during the early violent eruptions was enriched by factors of 10 to 30 relative to ash in some of the same elements observed in the quiescent plume.\n\nPetrologic characteristics of the 1982 and pre-1982 eruptive products of El Chichon volcano, Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMcGee, J.J.; Tilling, R.I.; Duffield, W.A.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nStudies on a suite of rocks from this volcano indicate that the juvenile materials of the 1982 and pre-1982 eruptions of the volcano have essentially the same mineralogy and chemistry. Data suggest that chemical composition changed little over the 0.3 m.y. sample period. Modally, plagioclase is the dominant phenocryst, followed by amphibole, clinopyroxene and minor phases including anhydrite. Plagioclase phenocrysts show complex zoning: the anorthite-rich zones are probably the result of changing volatile P on the magma and may reflect the changes in the volcano's magma reservoir in response to repetitive, explosive eruptive activity.-R.E.S.\n\nThe CO2 Flux and the Chemistry of the Crater lake in 2013-2015 Evidence for the Enhanced Activity of El Chichon volcano, Mexico.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTaran, Y.; JÃ¡come Paz, M. P.; Inguaggiato, S.; Collard, N.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nDuring 2013-2015, four CO2 flux surveys were performed in the El Chichon crater both, from the lake surface and from the soil of the crater. The chemistry of the lake water, as well as its physical parameters (surface area, depth, temperature) were also determined. The CO2 flux in 2014-2015 compared to the 2007-2008 data (Mazot et al., 2011, BV, 73: 423-441) increased almost one order of magnitude (from ~ 140 ton d-1 in 2008 to ~ 840 ton d-1 in 2014). During the last two years the lake became the largest for the whole time of observations with the maximum surface area more than 18 ha covering completely the NE fumarolic field and all thermal springs feeding the lake with mineralized water. Despite the maximum volume of the lake it was characterized in 2015 by the highest since 2007 chloride content (~2500 ppm) and temperature (34Â°C). A large degassing spot in the middle of the lake for the first time was observed in April 2015 with more than 10,000 g m-2 d-1 of the CO2 flux. These observations evidence that the volcano-hydrothermal system of El Chichon volcano came into a new stage of activity associated most probably with changes in the magmatic activity at depth.\n\nMagma mixing, recharge and eruption histories recorded in plagioclase phenocrysts from El Chichon Volcano, Mexico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nTepley, F. J.; Davidson, J.P.; Tilling, R.I.; Arth, Joseph G.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nConsistent core-to-rim decreases of 87Sr/86Sr ratios and coincident increases in Sr concentrations in plagioclase phenocrysts of varying size (~ 1 cm to 2 mm) are reported from samples of the 1982 and pre-1982 (~ 200 ka) eruptions of El Chichon Volcano. Maximum 87Sr/86Sr ratios of ~ 0.7054, significantly higher than the whole-rock isotopic ratios (~ 0.7040-0.7045), are found in the cores of plagioclase phenocrysts, and minimum 87Sr/86Sr ratios of ~ 0.7039 are found near some of the rims. Plagioclase phenocrysts commonly display abrupt fluctuations in An content (up to 25 mol %) that correspond to well-developed dissolution surfaces The isotopic, textural and compositional characteristics suggest that these plagioclase phenocrysts grew in a system that was periodically recharged by higher-temperature magma with a lower 87Sr/86Sr ratio and a higher Sr concentration. Rim 87Sr/86Sr ratios in plagioclase phenocrysts of rocks from the 200 ka eruption indicate that, at that time, the magma had already attained the lowest recorded 87Sr/86Sr value of the system (~ 0.7039). In contrast, cores from plagioclase phenocrysts of the 1982 eruption, inferred to have grown in the past few thousand years, have the highest recorded 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the system. Collectively, the Sr isotopic data (for plagioclase and whole rock), disequilibrium textural features of the phenocrysts, known eruption frequencies, and inferred crystal-residence times of the plagioclases are best interpreted in terms of an intermittent magma chamber model. Similar processes, including crustal contamination, magma mixing, periodic recharge by addition of more mafic magma to induce plagioclase disequilibrium (possibly triggering eruption) and subsequent re-equilibration, apparently were operative throughout the 200 ky history of the El Chichon magma system.\n\nExperimental petrology applied in deposits of the 550 yr b.p. eruption at El Chichon volcano, Chiapas.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMora, J. C.\n\n2002-12-01\n\nThe 550 years ago a plinian-type eruption took place at El ChichÃÂ¢n volcano, this event produced a 1.5 km3 pumice fall deposit. Contrary to the 1982 eruption, this event occurred under open vent conditions similar to the present crater. Comparing the pre-eruptive conditions of these two events would shed new lights on the location of the magma chamber, and the magmatic evolution. In order to determine the pre-eruptive conditions (P and T) of the 550 yr BP magma, laboratory experiments were carried out under fixed pressure and temperature conditions at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks. For this purpose fresh samples of the pumice were crushed, pulverized and saturated with water. The sample was then placed into ~2mg experimental tube charges of Ag70Pd30 of 2mm diameter. Our results indicate that prior to the 550 plinian the magma has a temperature of 825-830Â°C. and at approximated pressure of 2500 bars. This pressure estimate differs from the 4000 bars estimated with the geobaromether of Al-hornblende. The water contents obtained in the experiments were oversaturated similar to the calculated with the plagioclase-melts equation (5.3-6.1 percent in vol.)\n\nThe effect of El Chichon on the intensity and polarization of skylight at Mauna Loa\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKing, M. D.; Fraser, R. S.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nAn empirical model of the stratospheric aerosol over Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) has been developed, in order to study the effect of aerosol particles from the eruption of the El Chichon volcano on the intensity and degree of skylight polarization. The modeling computations were based on measurements of monthly mean optical thickness for July 1982, together with lidar measurements of the vertical distribution of aerosols. On the basis of the theoretical computations, it is shown that the number and location of polarization neutral points, and the location and magnitude of the peak polarization were both functions of the relatively narrow distribution of aerosol particle size near 0.4 microns.\n\nOn the prolonged lifetime of the El Chichon sulfuric acid aerosol cloud\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHofmann, D. J.; Rosen, J. M.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe observed decay of the aerosol mixing ratio following the eruption of El Chichon appears to have been 20-30 percent slower than that following the eruption of Fuego in 1974, even though the sulfuric acid droplets were observed to grow to considerably larger sizes after El Chichon. This suggests the possible presence of a condensation nuclei and sulfuric acid vapor source and continued growth phenomena occurring well after the El Chichon eruption. It is proposed that the source of these nuclei and the associated vapor may be derived from annual evaporation and condensation of aerosol in the high polar regions during stratospheric warming events, with subsequent spreading to lower latitudes.\n\n[Nutrition intervention actions in relief situations: report on 4 experiences in Mexico].\n\nPubMed\n\nMadrigal-Fritsch, Herlinda; RuÃ­z Arregui, Liliana; PÃ©rez Gil Romo, Sara Elena; Cervantes Turrubiates, Leticia; Torre Medina-Mora, Pilar; RamÃ­rez GarcÃ­a, Guadalupe; Escobar PÃ©rez, Margarita\n\n2004-06-01\n\nIn the last years Mexico faced several natural and human provoked disasters. We choose the Mexico City earthquake, the Chichonal volcano eruption, the Guatemala war and its refugees and the Chiapas armed movement. In all of them the INCMNSZ surveillance system proposal has been applied. To establish the intervention we classified the emergencies according to its magnitude and localization. The intervention consisted in: immediate attention of serious cases, immunizations, quimioprofilaxis, personal hygiene, environment control, nutritional assessment and diet definition. The affected population attended were: in the eruption 4.500, in the earthquake 1.000, in the Guatemala war 19.000 and in the Chiapas movement 6.940. Population damaged by the eruption and the war received mass feeding; complementary feeding (vulnerable groups) and therapeutic feeding (people with tuberculosis and serious undernutrition). In the earthquake people received first, prepared food and later they were organized to bring, plan, prepare and distribute their food. In the Chiapas armed movement people received only special baby food. In all cases, population also receive nutritional information and only with the refugees and the Chiapas damaged people the local food production was promoted. We suggest evaluating every emergency program and share experiences to afford this type of situations in a better way.\n\nEl ChichÃ³n's \"surprise\" eruption in 1982: lessons for reducing volcano risk\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nTilling, R.I.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nUnfortunately, the eruptions came as an almost total surprise for scientists and government authorities, effectively precluding opportunities to implement timely mitigative countermeasures. During the months before eruption onset, fumarolic activity increased and inhabitants living close to the volcano felt occasional earthquakes, prompting the Chiapas government to request help from the Federal government. Both the Chiapas and Federal governmental actions were slow, and the requested assistance came after the volcano erupted. Perhaps the most important lesson learned from the disastrous outcome at El ChichÃ³n is that its decreased activity (29 Marchâ2 April) should not have been assumed by the senior scientist on siteâand the military authorities acting on his adviceâto signal the end of eruption. While the 1982 eruptions caused a national tragedy, they also fostered multidisciplinary studies of eruptive phenomena, not only at El ChichÃ³n but also other explosive volcanoes in the world.\n\nSTS 8 Orbiter mission window pitting and the possible association with the El Chichon eruption of March and April 1982\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCour-Palais, B. G.; Kessler, D. J.; Zook, H. A.; Clanton, U. S.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe possibility that the pitting that occurred in the STS-8 Orbiter windows was caused by dust from the El Chichon volcano eruption in March-April 1982 is considered. The pit density was more than 30/sq cm, most being 2.5-5 microns deep, and showed no evidence of impact melting. An 'alley' of higher incidence of pits in one window coincided with the line of a seam between TPS tiles. The particles causing the sandblasting were concluded to have arrived in parallel and could not be attributed to the ET, SRBs or a dust storm. The sulfuric gas-rich El Chichon plume injected sufficient material into the atmosphere so that the globe was soon encircled. Most of the resulting particulates (480-8400 tons) stayed in the Northern Hemisphere, and H2SO4 and ash concentrations were high during the STS-8 mission. The Orbiter cut through the debris layer at 19.8 km altitude at a 10 deg angle of attack, which matches the particle crater impact angle in the Orbiter windows. Since the passage was at night, larger H2SO4 droplets may have coalesced and formed larger particles on available solid nuclei, thus producing the 20-40 microns cratering observed in the windows.\n\nVolcanic Risk Perception in Five Communities Located near the ChichÃ³n Volcano, Northern Chiapas, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRodriguez, F.; Novelo-Casanova, D. A.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe ChichÃ³n volcano (17Â° 19â N and 93Â° 15â W) is located in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. This volcano is classified by UNESCO as one of the ten most dangerous volcanos in the world. The eruptions of March and April in 1982 affected at least 51 communities located in the surroundings of the volcano and caused the death of about 2000 people. In this work we evaluate the risk perception in five communities highly populated: JuÃ¡rez, OstuacÃ¡n, Pichucalco, Reforma and Sunuapa. We selected these communities because they have a high possibility to be affected by a volcanic eruption in the future. Our survey was carried out during February and March 2006. A total of 222 families were interviewed using a questionnaire to measure risk perception. These questionnaires retrieved general information as how long people had been living there and their reasons to do so; their experiences during the 1982 events, their opinion about the authorities participation and their perception of volcanic risk; the plans of the community for disaster prevention and mitigation. Some of the most important results are: (1). People perceive a very low volcanic risk and the 70% of interviewees believe that a new eruption in the future is almost improbable because it happened in 1982. This result is particularly interesting because, according to the state government, more than 100,000 inhabitants will be directly affected in case of a new similar eruption; (2). About 95% of the population do not know the current activity of the volcano and consider that the authorities do not inform properly to their communities; (3). The response of the authorities during the events of 1982 was ranked as deficient mainly because they were unable provide shelters, storage facilities, food as well as medicine and health care access; (4). Approximately 60% of the community will accept to be re-located again in case of a new eruption; (5). About 70% of the population will not accept to be re-located because\n\nEl Chichon volcanic ash in the stratosphere - Particle abundances and size distributions after the 1982 eruption\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGooding, J. L.; Clanton, U. S.; Gabel, E. M.; Warren, J. L.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nVolcanic ash particles collected from the stratosphere after the March/April, 1982 explosive eruption of El Chichon volcano, Mexico, were mostly 2-40 micron vesicular shards of silicic volcanic glass that varied in abundance, at 16.8-19.2 km altitude, from 200 per cu m (30-49 deg N lat.) in May to 1.3 per cu m (45-75 deg N) in October. At the minimum, the ash cloud covered latitudes 10-60 deg N in July and 10 deg S-75 deg N in October. In May and July, ash particles were mostly free, individual shards (and clusters of shards) but, by October, were intimately associated with liquid droplets (presumably, sulfuric acid). In May 1982, the total stratospheric burden of ash was at least 240 tons (2.2 x 10 to the 8th g) although the total ash injected into the stratosphere by the eruption was probably 480-8400 tons.\n\nInter-laboratory comparison of X-ray fluorescence analyses of eruptive products of El ChichÃ³n Volcano, Chiapas, Mexico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nTilling, Robert I.; Bornhorst, Theodore J.; Taggart, Joseph E.; Rose, William I.; McGee, James J.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nAn inter-laboratory comparison has been made of X-ray fluorescence analyses of 10 samples of lava and pumices from El ChichÃ³n Volcano, Chiapas, Mexico. Some determinations of major-element constituents agree within analytical uncertainty, whereas others exchibit significant bias. Analyses carried out at the Michigan Technological University (MTU) laboratory are systematicallyÂ lowerÂ in MgO (26â48%), Fetotal(5â18%), CaO (4â15%) and higher in K2O (0â15%) than analyses made at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Denver laboratory. These differences are ascribed in part to a complex combination of calibration assumptionsand mineralogical and particle-size effects inherent in the use of pressed rock-powder pellets in the analytical procedure of the MTU laboratory. Other, but as yet unknown, differences in sample preparation and/or analytical technique may also be important; effects related to natural sample inhomogeneityare believed to be insignificant. The inter-laboratory differences in the analytical data complicated accurate assessment of whether El ChichÃ³n magmas have changed composition during the past 300 000 a. Knowledge of such change is needed for understanding petrogenetic history and for such related studies as evaluation of volcanic hazards.\n\nSize-specific composition of aerosols in the El Chichon volcanic cloud\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWoods, D. C.; Chuan, R. L.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nA NASA U-2 research aircraft flew sampling missions in April, May, July, November, and December 1982 aimed at obtaining in situ data in the stratospheric cloud produced from the March-April 1982 El Chichon eruptions. Post flight analyses provided information on the aerosol composition and morphology. The particles ranged in size from smaller than 0.05 m to larger than 20 m diameter and were quite complex in composition. In the April, May, and July samples the aerosol mass was dominated by magmatic and lithic particles larger than about 3 m. The submicron particles consisted largely of sulfuric acid. Halite particles, believed to be related to a salt dome beneath El Chichon, were collected in the stratosphere in April and May. On the July 23 flight, copper-zinc oxide particles were collected. In July, November, and December, in addition to the volcanic ash and acid particles, carbon-rich particles smaller than about 0.1 m aerodynamic diameter were abundant.\n\nThe dust cloud of the century\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRobock, A.\n\n1983-02-01\n\nThe structure and composition of the dust cloud from the 4 April 1982 eruption of the El Chichon volcano in Chiapas state, Mexico, is examined and the possible effects of the dust cloud on the world's weather patterns are discussed. Observations of the cloud using a variety of methods are evaluated, including data from the GOES and NOAA-7 weather satellites, vertically pointing lidar measurements, the SME satellite, and the Nimbus-7 satellite. Studies of the gaseous and particulate composition of the cloud reveal the presence of large amounts of sulfuric acid particles, which have a long mean residence time in the atmosphere and have a large effect on the amount of solar radiation received at the earth's surface by scattering several percent of the radiation back to space. Estimates of the effect of this cloud on surface air temperature changes are presented based on findings from climate models.\n\nCoastal Zone Color Scanner atmospheric correction - Influence of El Chichon\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGordon, Howard R.; Castano, Diego J.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe addition of an El Chichon-like aerosol layer in the stratosphere is shown to have very little effect on the basic CZCS atmospheric correction algorithm. The additional stratospheric aerosol is found to increase the total radiance exiting the atmosphere, thereby increasing the probability that the sensor will saturate. It is suggested that in the absence of saturation the correction algorithm should perform as well as in the absence of the stratospheric layer.\n\nRadon emanometry in soil gases and activity in ashes from El Chichon Volcano\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde La Cruz-Reyna, S.; Mena, M.; Segovia, N.; Chalot, J.

Results show a general decreasing pattern of222Em concentration in soil with time after the eruptions. Activity measurements of radon daughters in ashes show that a large amount of222Em and220Em was released from magma degassing during the eruptions, and that only a fraction of the degassed magma was erupted. An important fluid interaction between the magma chamber and the surrounding sedimentary rock is also suggested.\n\nAirborne lidar measurements of El Chichon stratospheric aerosols, October 1982 to November 1982\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMccormick, M. P.; Osborn, M. T.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nA coordinated flight mission to determine the spatial distribution and aerosol characteristics of the El Chichon produced stratospheric aerosol was flown in October to November 1982. The mission covered 46 deg N to 46 deg S and included rendezvous between balloon-, airplane-, and satellite-borne sensors. The lidar data from the flight mission are presented. Representative profiles of lidar backscatter ratio, plots of the integrated backscattering function versus latitude, and contours of backscatter mixing ratio versus altitude and latitude are given. In addition, tables containing numerical values of the backscatter ratio and backscattering functions versus altitude are supplied for each profile. The bulk of the material produced by the El Chichon eruptions of late March 10 to early April 1982 resided between latitudes from 5 to 7 deg S to 35 to 37 deg N and was concentrated above 21 km in a layer that peaked at 23 to 25 km. In this latitude region, peak scattering ratios at a wavelength of 0.6943 micron were approximately 24. The results of this mission are presented in a ready-to-use format for atmospheric and climatic studies.\n\nA taxonomic monograph of the genus Tylodinus Champion (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Cryptorhynchinae: Tylodina) of Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nLuna-Cozar, JesÃºs; Anderson, Robert S; Jones, Robert W; LeÃ³n-CortÃ©, Jorge L\n\n2014-04-15\n\nThe species of the genus Tylodinus from the Mexican state of Chiapas are revised.

Volcanic clouds from eruptions of La Soufriere, Sierra Negra, St. Helens, Uluwan, Alaid, unknown volcano, and El Chichon were detected one after another in only three years from 1979 to 1982. In july 1991 strong scattering layers which were originated from the serious eruptions of Pinatubo in June and were almost comparable to the El Chichon clouds were detected. Volcanic clouds from pinatubo and other volcanos mentioned are examined and carefully compared to each other and to the wind and temperature which was measured by Fukuoka Meteorological Observatory almost at the same time as the lidar observation was made.\n\nRuby lidar observations and trajectory analysis of stratospheric aerosols injected by the volcanic eruptions of El Chichon\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nUchino, O.; Tabata, T.; Akita, I.; Okada, Y.; Naito, K.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nLarge amounts of aerosol particles and gases were injected into the lower stratosphere by the violet volcanic eruptions of El Chichon on March 28, and April 3 and 4, 1982.

We present a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) specifically performed to evaluate seismic hazard in the Chiapas state. The PSHA was based on a composited seismic catalogue homogenized to Mw and was used a logic tree procedure for the consideration of different seismogenic source models and ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs). The results were obtained in terms of peak ground acceleration as well as spectral accelerations. The earthquake catalogue was compiled from the International Seismological Center and the Servicio SismolÃ³gico Nacional de MÃ©xico sources. Two different seismogenic source zones (SSZ) models were devised based on a revision of the tectonics of the region and the available geomorphological and geological maps. The SSZ were finally defined by the analysis of geophysical data, resulting two main different SSZ models. The Gutenberg-Richter parameters for each SSZ were calculated from the declustered and homogenized catalogue, while the maximum expected earthquake was assessed from both the catalogue and geological criteria. Several worldwide and regional GMPEs for subduction and crustal zones were revised. For each SSZ model we considered four possible combinations of GMPEs. Finally, hazard was calculated in terms of PGA and SA for 500-, 1000-, and 2500-years return periods for each branch of the logic tree using the CRISIS2007 software. The final hazard maps represent the mean values obtained from the two seismogenic and four attenuation models considered in the logic tree. For the three return periods analyzed, the maps locate the most hazardous areas in the Chiapas Central Pacific Zone, the Pacific Coastal Plain and in the Motagua and Polochic Fault Zone; intermediate hazard values in the Chiapas Batholith Zone and in the Strike-Slip Faults Province. The hazard decreases\n\nOrganochlorine pesticides in the ambient air of Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlegria, Henry; Bidleman, Terry F; Figueroa, Miguel Salvador\n\n2006-04-01\n\nOrganochlorine (OC) pesticides were measured in the ambient air of Chiapas, Mexico during 2000-2001. Concentrations of some OC pesticides (DDTs, chlordanes, toxaphene) were elevated compared with levels in the Great Lakes region, while those of other pesticides were not (hexachlorocyclohexanes, dieldrin). While this suggests southern Mexico as a source region for the former group of chemicals, comparably high levels have also been reported in parts of the southern United States, where their suspected sources are soil emissions (DDTs, toxaphene) and termiticide usage (chlordane). Ratios of p,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDE and trans-chlordane/cis-chlordane/trans-nonachlor (TC/CC/TN) in Chiapas suggest a mixture of fresh and weathered sources, while congener profiles of toxaphene suggest emission of old residues from soils. This is supported by air parcel back trajectory analysis, which indicated that air masses over Chiapas at the time of sampling had previously passed over areas of continuing or recent use of some OC pesticides as well as areas of past use.\n\nThe 8 September 2017 Tsunami Triggered by the M w 8.2 Intraplate Earthquake, Chiapas, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRamÃ­rez-Herrera, MarÃ­a Teresa; Corona, NÃ©stor; Ruiz-Angulo, Angel; Melgar, Diego; Zavala-Hidalgo, Jorge\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe 8 September 2017, M w 8.2 earthquake offshore Chiapas, Mexico, is the largest earthquake in recorded history in Chiapas since 1902. It caused damage in the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas and Tabasco, including more than 100 fatalities, over 1.5 million people were affected, and 41,000 homes were damaged in the state of Chiapas alone. This earthquake, an intraplate event on a normal fault on the oceanic subducting plate, generated a tsunami recorded at several tide gauge stations in Mexico and on the Pacific Ocean. Here, we report the physical effects of the tsunami on the Chiapas coast and analyze the societal implications of this tsunami on the basis of our post-tsunami field survey. The associated tsunami waves were recorded first at Huatulco tide gauge station at 5:04 (GMT) 12 min after the earthquake. We covered ground observations along 41 km of the coast of Chiapas, encompassing the sites with the highest projected wave heights based on our preliminary tsunami model (maximum tsunami amplitudes between 94.5Â° and 93.0Â°W). Runup and inundation distances were measured along eight sites. The tsunami occurred at low tide. The maximum runup was 3 m at Boca del Cielo, and maximum inundation distance was 190 m in Puerto Arista, corresponding to the coast in front of the epicenter and in the central sector of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Tsunami scour and erosion was evident along the Chiapas coast. Tsunami deposits, mainly sand, reached up to 32 cm thickness thinning landward up to 172 m distance.\n\nChecklist of the continental fishes of the state of Chiapas, Mexico, and their distribution\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVelÃ¡zquez-VelÃ¡quez, Ernesto; LÃ³pez-Vila, JesÃºs Manuel; GÃ³mez-GonzÃ¡lez, AdÃ¡n Enrique; Romero-Berny, Emilio Ismael; Lievano-Trujillo, Jorge Luis; Matamoros, Wilfredo A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract An updated checklist of the distribution of fishes that inhabit the continental waters of the Mexican state of Chiapas is presented. The state was compartmentalized into 12 hydrological regions for the purpose of understanding the distribution of fish fauna across a state with large physiographic variance. The ichthyofauna of Chiapas is represented by 311 species distributed in two classes, 26 orders, 73 families, and 182 genera, including 12 exotic species. The families with the highest number of species were Cichlidae, Poeciliidae, Sciaenidae, Carangidae, Ariidae, Gobiidae, and Haemulidae. This study attempts to close gaps in knowledge of the distribution of ichthyofauna in the diverse hydrological regions of Chiapas, Mexico.

J.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nThe presence of volcanic ash used as temper in Late Classic Maya pottery (AD 600-900) at El Pilar has been long known although the volcano(s) contributing ash have not been identified. We use geochemical fingerprinting, comparing compositions of glass shards in potsherds with volcanic sources to identify the source(s). El Pilar is located in the Maya carbonate lowlands distant from volcanic sources. It is unlikely Maya transported ash from distant sites: ash volumes are too large, the terrain too rugged, and no draft animals were available. Ash layer mining is unlikely because mine sites have not been found despite intensive surveys. Nearest volcanic sources to El Pilar, Belize and Guatemala, are roughly 450 km to the south and east. The ash found in potsherds has a cuspate morphology. This suggests ash was collected during, or shortly after, an ash airfall event following eruption. Analyses of n=333 ash shards from 20 ceramic (pottery) sherds was conducted by electron microprobe for major elements, and LA-ICPMS for trace elements and Pb isotopes. These analyses can be compared to volcanic materials from candidate volcanoes in the region. The 1982 El Chichon eruption caused airfall deposition (< 1 mm isopach) at El Pilar which lead Espindola et. al, 2000 to suggest that earlier eruptions at El Chichon could have caused ash fall at El Pilar during the Late Classic. 333 individual glass shards found within about 20 distinct potsherds have a mean silica content of 78.3Â±1.1 wt. % (one-sigma). The 1982 El Chichon eruption products have a mean silica content of 60.2Â±7.2% (one-sigma, n=48); the circa 1475 AD eruptive products of El Chichon have a mean silica content of 53.4Â±3.4 wt % (one-sigma, n=8). This suggests that El Chichon was not a source of the ash at El Pilar. In order confirm or refute the El Chichon source hypothesis, comparison of trace element ratios between archaeological samples and El Chichon has been made. The atomic ratios of La/Yb, Nb/Ta, Zr/Hf, Sr\n\nA comparison between high-altitude horizon photography and direct sampling of El Chichon cloud particles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nColetti, A.; Hofmann, D. J.; Rosen, J. M.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nPerturbations to the visible radiation by the El Chichon aerosol layers in the stratosphere observed on May 18, 1982 in Laredo, Texas using in situ, time-lapsed photography are analyzed. The densitometric data are compared with optical counter data. Good correlation is detected for the scattered light intensities of the sky estimated with the two techniques. It is observed that the optical thickness of the stratosphere from 18.8 km to the top of the atmosphere = 0.18 and the residual optical thickness at 27 km = 0.0007. The relationship between the isodensity contours and the height of the observations, cloud cover, specific vertical aerosol distribution, and earth curvature is examined.\n\nOzone destruction through heterogeneous chemistry following the eruption of El Chichon\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHofmann, David J.; Solomon, Susan\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe results of ozone observations at northern midlatitudes in late 1982 through 1983, following the eruption of El Chichon are discussed, together with the observations of other trace gases which may be linked to possible variations in ozone chemistry. These results are related to the in situ aerosol observations following the El Chicon eruption, with particular attention given to data relevant to heterogeneous reactions, such as the aerosol surface area and weight percent H2SO4. It is shown that, at midlatitudes, the observed volcanic-particle surface area reached a maximum of about 50 sq microns/cu m (above a typical background value of about 0.75) at an altitude of 18-20 km in early 1983; this enhancement of surface area is about the same as that encountered in stratospheric clouds in the Antarctic, suggesting a possible basis for ozone depletion through heterogeneous chemistry. The fraction of ozone reduction that may have occurred as a result of heterogeneous chemicl effects is estimated.\n\nSolar Mesosphere Explorer satellite measurements of el Chichon stratospheric aerosols. 1: Cloud morphology\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRusch, D. W.; Clancy, R. T.; Eparvier, F. G.; Thomas, G. E.; Thomas, R. J.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nData from the Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME) is used to track the time, latitude, and altitude (above 18 km) development of the aerosol cloud injected into the stratosphere by the eruption of el Chichon. This unique data set, using scattering data from the near-infrared (1.27 and 1.87 microns) and visible (440 nm) spectrometers on SME, covers the period from the initial injection in April 1982 through the end of 1986. Although the bulk of the mass is contained in the latitude band from 10 deg S to 30 deg N for the entire duration of the measurements, transport of material to high latitudes is apparent in the data in the post eruption period. The times aerosol density maxima vary greatly as a function of altitude and latitude.\n\n[Food insecurity and social vulnerability in chiapas : the face of poverty].\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez-RodrÃ­guez, Julio C; GarcÃ­a-Chong, NÃ©stor R; Trujillo-Olivera, Laura E; Noriero-Escalante, Lucio\n\n2014-12-01\n\nTo estimate the frequency, distribution, and trends of food security/insecurity conditions of families in Chiapas and their relationship with low income factor and sociodemographic characteristics. Retrospective and cross-sectional descriptive study. Information of 1430 households from The National Health and Nutrition Survey 2012 was included. The Food Insecurity was measured using the harmonized version of the Latin and Caribbean Food Security Scale for MÃ©xico. 83% of households in Chiapas has some type of food insecurity, 86.5% is concentrated in the lower socioeconomic levels, 85% of households in rural areas have food insecurity, 87% of households beneficiary of Oportunidades still have food insecurity. A large part of this population continues to have high levels of Food Insecurity. Clearly targeted social programs designed to eliminate this lag, fail to reduce levels of access to food which affects the physical and intellectual potential development of Chiapas people, becoming an obstacle to the development of the State. Reorientation of food policy in MÃ©xico is considered. Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014. Published by AULA MEDICA.

To address this, apatite fission track and U-Th-He thermochronometry, combined with zircon U-Pb dating, were performed on bedrock and sedimentary samples of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas to discern timing of exhumation and identify sediment source areas. The U-Pb results show that Paleocene-Eocene terrigenous units outcropping at the northern section of the Sierra were mostly derived from Grenville (Ë1 Ga) basement whereas the internal sections of the chain yield mainly Permian to Triassic ages (circa 270-230 Ma) typical of the Chiapas massif complex. Grenville-sourced sediments are most probably sourced by the Oaxacan block or the Guichicovi complex and were deposited to the north of the Sierra in a foreland setting related to a Laramide deformation front. Other possibly source areas may be related to metasedimentary units widely documented at the south Maya block such as the Baldi unit. The apatite fission track and U-Th-He data combined with previously published results record three main stages in exhumation history: (1) slow exhumation between 35 and 25 Ma affecting mainly the Chiapas massif complex; (2) fast exhumation between 16 and 9 Ma related to the onset of major strike-slip deformation affecting both the Chiapas massif complex and Chiapas fold-and-thrust belt; and (3) a 6 to 5 Ma period of rapid cooling that affected the Chiapas fold-and-thrust belt, coincident with the landward migration of the Caribbean-North America plate boundaries. These data suggest that most of the topographic growth of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas took place in the middle to late Miocene. The new thermochronological evidence combined with stratigraphic and kinematic information suggests that the left-lateral strike-slip faults bounding the Chiapas fold-and-thrust belt to the west may have accommodated most of the displacement between the North American and\n\nEffect of the eruption of El Chichon stratospheric aerosol size and composition\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOberbeck, V. R.; Danielsen, E. F.; Snetsinger, K. G.; Ferry, G. V.; Fong, W.; Hayes, D. M.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nDominant effects of the El Chichon eruption on stratospheric aerosols at 19.8 to 20.7 km are: (1) vapor depositional growth of the small-aerosol (background) mode; (2) development of a large-particle mode by sedimentation from the highest altitudes in the cloud; (3) a change in the large-particle mode from sulfate-coated silicates to sulfate aerosols, some with silicate cores; (4) a 100-fold increase in sulfate mass in the large particle mode. Terminal velocities of large silicate particles, maximum r = 2.3 micron, sampled 1 month after eruption, and calibrated with the aid of lidar data, indicate initial injection to 26 to 27 km. Smaller velocities of sulfate aerosols, median r = 0.5 micron, are compatible with major growth in 2 to 3 months at 27 to 28 km. Aerosol settling accounts for the descent of the main lidar return to 26.5 km in August and to 20 to 21 km in December.\n\nRadiative effects of the El Chichon volcanic eruption. Preliminary results concerning remote sensing\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBandeen, W. R.; Fraser, R. S.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe aerosols and gases resulting from the El Chichon volcanic eruption had, and may still have, significant effects on satellite measurements of the properties of the Earth's atmosphere. The sea surface temperature measured by the AVHRR was biased up to -2.5 C for many months. The total amount of ozone derived from TOMS with a standard algorithm was greatly in excess of the possible value. This apparent excess can now be explained in terms of additional absorption by SO2. Infrared temperature sounders have observed both positive and negative anomalies. These effects and others on many satellite measurements are addressed following a discussion of the history and composition of the ejecta remaining in the stratosphere. Finally, recommendations are made for further study to account for the effects of volcanic eruptions on satellite observations and for use of such observations to measure the characteristics of the ejecta.\n\nPrehispanic Use of Chili Peppers in Chiapas, Mexico\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPowis, Terry G.; Gallaga Murrieta, Emiliano; Lesure, Richard; Lopez Bravo, Roberto; Grivetti, Louis; Kucera, Heidi; Gaikwad, Nilesh W.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe genus Capsicum is New World in origin and represents a complex of a wide variety of both wild and domesticated taxa. Peppers or fruits of Capsicum species rarely have been identified in the paleoethnobotanical record in either Meso- or South America. We report here confirmation of Capsicum sp. residues from pottery samples excavated at Chiapa de Corzo in southern Mexico dated from Middle to Late Preclassic periods (400 BCE to 300 CE). Residues from 13 different pottery types were collected and extracted using standard techniques. Presence of Capsicum was confirmed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)/MS-MS Analysis. Five pottery types exhibited chemical peaks for Capsicum when compared to the standard (dihydrocapsaicin). No peaks were observed in the remaining eight samples. Results of the chemical extractions provide conclusive evidence for Capsicum use at Chiapas de Corzo during a 700 year period (400 BCEâ300 CE). Presence of Capsicum in different types of culinary-associated pottery raises questions how chili pepper could have been used during this early time period. As Pre-Columbian cacao products sometimes were flavored using Capsicum, the same pottery sample set was tested for evidence of cacao using a theobromine marker: these results were negative. As each vessel that tested positive for Capsicum had a culinary use we suggest here the possibility that chili residues from the Chiapas de Corzo pottery samples reflect either paste or beverage preparations for religious, festival, or every day culinary use. Alternatively, some vessels that tested positive merely could have been used to store peppers. Most interesting from an archaeological context was the presence of Capsicum residue obtained from a spouted jar, a pottery type previously thought only to be used for pouring liquids.

El Chichon in 1982 on the Umkehr ozone data at the Tateno Aerological Observatory was determined. In addition, the effects of the aerosols on the Umkehr ozone data at Arosa, Switzerland were investigated using lidar data collected at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. It was found that both stratospheric and tropospheric aerosols induced a significant negative ozone error in the uppermost layers (33-47 km), caused a small and usually negative ozone error in layers between 16 and 33 km, and induced a significant positive ozone error in layers between 6 and 16 km.\n\nChiapas' Delayed Entry into the International Labour Market: A Story of Peasant Isolation, Exploitation, and Coercion.\n\nPubMed\n\nDavis, Jason; Eakin, Hallie\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThis manuscript presents a synthetic view of Chiapas' migration history over the last century through a thorough examination of relevant English and Spanish-language literature sources. Unlike most Mexican states, Chiapas did not heavily rely upon migration, especially international migration, as an economic strategy until very recently. The reasons that underlie Chiapas' late adoption of economic migration include socio-political and economic structural factors that shaped rural and agrarian policy and demographic trends. This paper evaluates these structural factors with regards to several migration theories to assist our understanding of how and why Chiapans were prevented or discouraged from leaving their native communities. The paper concludes by detailing the perfect cascade of climatic, demographic, economic and political factors that ultimately forced Chiapans to resort to international migration as a major economic diversification strategy.\n\nStratospheric HTO perturbations 1980-1983\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMason, A.

It has been built by thousands of eruptions, beginning about 600,000 years ago. At least 25 vents on the flanks and summit have been active during several eruptive episodes of the past 10,000 years. The most recent eruption 1,300 years ago produced the Big Obsidian Flow. Thus, the volcano's long history and recent activity indicate that Newberry will erupt in the future. The most-visited part of the volcano is Newberry Crater, a volcanic depression or caldera at the summit of the volcano. Seven campgrounds, two resorts, six summer homes, and two major lakes (East and Paulina Lakes) are nestled in the caldera. The caldera has been the focus of Newberry's volcanic activity for at least the past 10,000 years. Other eruptions during this time have occurred along a rift zone on the volcano's northwest flank and, to a lesser extent, the south flank. Many striking volcanic features lie in Newberry National Volcanic Monument, which is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The monument includes the caldera and extends along the northwest rift zone to the Deschutes River. About 30 percent of the area within the monument is covered by volcanic products erupted during the past 10,000 years from Newberry volcano. Newberry volcano is presently quiet. Local earthquake activity (seismicity) has been trifling throughout historic time. Subterranean heat is still present, as indicated by hot springs in the caldera and high temperatures encountered during exploratory drilling for geothermal energy. This report describes the kinds of hazardous geologic events that might occur in the future at Newberry volcano. A hazard-zonation map is included to show the areas that will most likely be affected by renewed eruptions. In terms of our own lifetimes, volcanic events at Newberry are not of day-to-day concern because they occur so infrequently; however, the consequences of some types of eruptions can be severe.

L.; Lippman, J.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nA critical test of the new understanding of volcanic aerosols developed since 1982 is to determine if it can predict the effects of larger eruptions than those that have occurred since El Chichon. To do that, requires detailed information about the effects of specific large eruptions. We have been investigating the human and climatic impacts of the 1600 eruption of Huaynaputina volcano in Peru. The estimated Volcanic Explosivity Index for this eruption is 6, which is comparable to that of the 1815 eruption of Tambora volcano in Indonesia, which produced global cooling and led to crop failures, famine and social unrest. On the basis of tree-ring data, Briffa et al. (1998) suggested that the most severe short-term Northern Hemisphere cooling event of the past 600 years occurred in 1601, the year following the Huaynaputina eruption. In order gain a better understanding of the nature and extent of this cooling, we have been collecting annual time series that provide information about climatic conditions during time intervals that bracket the Huaynaputina eruption. Among the time series that we have examined (or plan to examine) are ice conditions in the harbors of Tallinn, Estonia, and Riga, Latvia and in Lake Suwa in Japan: cherry blossom blooming (sakura) dates from Kyoto, Japan; records of agricultural production from China and Russia; tithe records from the Spanish colonial empire; dates of the beginning of the wine harvest in France and the rye harvest in Sweden; prices of agricultural commodities in Europe; and river flows from the Nile and the Colorado. Often, in the records we have examined, 1601 shows up as one of the coldest years, if not the coldest year. In addition, the worst famines in Russian history took place between 1601 and 1603, which eventually led to the overthrow of Tsar Boris Gudonov. Thus, there is considerable evidence that the climatic impacts of the Huaynaputina eruption were comparable to those from the Tambora eruption.

This composite volcano, located about 50 kilometers east of the capital city San Salvador, has a volume of about 130 cubic kilometers, rises to an altitude of about 2180 meters, and towers above major communities such as San Vicente, Tepetitan, Guadalupe, Zacatecoluca, and Tecoluca. In addition to the larger communities that surround the volcano, several smaller communities and coffee plantations are located on or around the flanks of the volcano, and major transportation routes are located near the lowermost southern and eastern flanks of the volcano. The population density and proximity around San Vicente volcano, as well as the proximity of major transportation routes, increase the risk that even small landslides or eruptions, likely to occur again, can have serious societal consequences. The eruptive history of San Vicente volcano is not well known, and there is no definitive record of historical eruptive activity. The last significant eruption occurred more than 1700 years ago, and perhaps long before permanent human habitation of the area. Nevertheless, this volcano has a very long history of repeated, and sometimes violent, eruptions, and at least once a large section of the volcano collapsed in a massive landslide. The oldest rocks associated with a volcanic center at San Vicente are more than 2 million years old. The volcano is composed of remnants of multiple eruptive centers that have migrated roughly eastward with time. Future eruptions of this volcano will pose substantial risk to surrounding communities.\n\nVolcanoes.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTilling, Robert I.\n\nOne of a series of general interest publications on science topics, this booklet provides a non-technical introduction to the subject of volcanoes.

The malaria case in Chiapas, Mexico, 2002.\n\nPubMed\n\nCastillo-Salgado, Carlos\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe new public health surveillance requires at the global, national and local levels the use of new authoritative analytical approaches and tools for better recognition of the epidemiologic characteristics of the priority health events and risk factors affecting the population health. The identification of the events in time and space is of fundamental importance so that the geo-spatial description of the situation of diseases and health events facilitates the identification of social, environmental and health care related risks. This assessment examines the application and use of geo-spatial tools for identifying relevant spatial and epidemiological conglomerates of malaria in Chiapas, Mexico. The study design was ecological and the level of aggregation of the collected information of the epidemiological and spatial variables was municipalities. The data were collected in all municipalities of the state of Chiapas, Mexico during the years 2000-2002. The main outcome variable was cases and types of malaria diagnosed by blood smears in weekly reports. Independent variables were age, sex, ethnicity, literacy of the cases of malaria and environmental factors such as altitude, road type and network in the municipalities and cities of Chiapas. The production of thematic maps and the application of geo-spatial analytical tools such Moran and local indicator of spatial autocorrelation metrics for malaria clustering allowed the visualization and recognition that the important population risk factors associated with high malaria incidence in Chiapas were low literacy rate, areas with high percentage of indigenous population that reflects the social inequalities gaps in health and the great burden of disease that is affecting this important vulnerable group in Chiapas. The presence of road networks allowed greater spatial diffusion of Malaria.

Kanaga Island is an elongated, low-relief (except for the volcano) island, located about 35 kilometers west of the community of Adak on Adak Island and is part of the Andreanof Islands Group of islands. Kanaga Volcano is one of the 41 historically active volcanoes in Alaska and has erupted numerous times in the past 11,000 years, including at least 10 eruptions in the past 250 years (Miller and others, 1998). The most recent eruption occurred in 1993-95 and caused minor ash fall on Adak Island and produced blocky aa lava flows that reached the sea on the northwest and west sides of the volcano (Neal and others, 1995). The summit of the volcano is characterized by a small, circular crater about 200 meters in diameter and 50-70 meters deep. Several active fumaroles are present in the crater and around the crater rim. The flanking slopes of the volcano are steep (20-30 degrees) and consist mainly of blocky, linear to spoonshaped lava flows that formed during eruptions of late Holocene age (about the past 3,000 years). The modern cone sits within a circular caldera structure that formed by large-scale collapse of a preexisting volcano. Evidence for eruptions of this preexisting volcano mainly consists of lava flows exposed along Kanaton Ridge, indicating that this former volcanic center was predominantly effusive in character. In winter (October-April), Kanaga Volcano may be covered by substantial amounts of snow that would be a source of water for lahars (volcanic mudflows). In summer, much of the snowpack melts, leaving only a patchy distribution of snow on the volcano. Glacier ice is not present on the volcano or on other parts of Kanaga Island. Kanaga Island is uninhabited and is part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, managed by\n\nApatite Fission-Track Analysis of the Middle Jurassic Todos Santos Formation from Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAbdullin, Fanis; SolÃ©, JesÃºs; Shchepetilnikova, Valentina; Solari, Luigi; Ortega-ObregÃ³n, Carlos\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe Sierra de Chiapas (SCH), located in the south of Mexico, is a complex geological province that can be divided on four different lithological or tectonic areas: (1) the Chiapas Massif Complex (CMC); (2) the Central Depression; (3) the Strike-slip Fault Province, and (4) the Chiapas Fold-and-thrust Belt. The CMC mostly consists of Permian granitoids and meta-granitoids, and represents the basement of the SCH. During the Jurassic period red beds and salt were deposited on this territory, related to the main pulse of rifting and opening of the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the Cretaceous stratigraphy contains limestones and dolomites deposited on a marine platform setting during the postrift stage of the Gulf of Mexico rift. During the Cenozoic Era took place the major clastic sedimentation along the SCH. According the published low-temperature geochronology data (Witt et al., 2012), SCH has three main phases of thermo-tectonic history: (1) slow exhumation between 35 and 25 Ma, that affected mainly the basement (CMC) and is probably related to the migration of the ChortÃ­s block; (2) fast exhumation during the Middle-Late Miocene caused by strike-slip deformation that affects almost all Chiapas territory; (3) period of rapid cooling from 6 to 5 Ma, that affects the Chiapas Fold-and-thrust Belt, coincident with the landward migration of the Caribbean-North America plate boundaries. The two last events were the most significant on the formation of the present-day topography of the SCH. However, the stratigraphy of the SCH shows traces of the existence of earlier tectonic events. This study presents preliminary results of apatite fission-track (AFT) dating of sandstones from the Todos Santos Formation (Middle Jurassic). The analyses are performed with in situ uranium determination using LA-ICP-MS (e.g., Hasebe et al., 2004). The AFT data indicate that this Formation has suffered high-grade diagenesis (probably over 150 ÂºC) and the obtained cooling ages, about 70-60 Ma\n\nPreliminary volcano-hazard assessment for Iliamna Volcano, Alaska\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nWaythomas, Christopher F.; Miller, Thomas P.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nIliamna Volcano is a 3,053-meter-high, ice- and snow-covered stratovolcano in the southwestern Cook Inlet region about 225 kilometers southwest of Anchorage and about 100 kilometers northwest of Homer. Historical eruptions of Iliamna Volcano have not been positively documented; however, the volcano regularly emits steam and gas, and small, shallow earthquakes are often detected beneath the summit area. The most recent eruptions of the volcano occurred about 300 years ago, and possibly as recently as 90-140 years ago. Prehistoric eruptions have generated plumes of volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows, and lahars that extended to the volcano flanks and beyond. Rock avalanches from the summit area have occurred numerous times in the past. These avalanches flowed several kilometers down the flanks and at least two large avalanches transformed to cohesive lahars. The number and distribution of known volcanic ash deposits from Iliamna Volcano indicate that volcanic ash clouds from prehistoric eruptions were significantly less voluminous and probably less common relative to ash clouds generated by eruptions of other Cook Inlet volcanoes. Plumes of volcanic ash from Iliamna Volcano would be a major hazard to jet aircraft using Anchorage International Airport and other local airports, and depending on wind direction, could drift at least as far as the Kenai Peninsula and beyond. Ashfall from future eruptions could disrupt oil and gas operations and shipping activities in Cook Inlet. Because Iliamna Volcano has not erupted for several hundred years, a future eruption could involve significant amounts of ice and snow that could lead to the formation of large lahars and downstream flooding. The greatest hazards in order of importance are described below and shown on plate 1.\n\nNew species of rhynchobdellid leech (Hirudinea: Glossiphoniidae): a parasite of turtles from Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nLÃ³pez-JimÃ©nez, Serapio; Oceguera-Figueroa, Alejandro\n\n2009-12-01\n\nA new species of rhynchobdellid leech, Placobdella ringueleti n. sp., is described based on the examination of 25 specimens.

The catastrophic eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, made clear the awesome destructive power of a volcano. Yet, over a time span longer than human memory and record, volcanoes have played a key role in forming and modifying the planet upon which we live. More than 80 percent of the Earth's surface--above and below sea level--is of volcanic origin. Gaseous emissions from volcanic vents over hundreds of millions of years formed the Earth's earliest oceans and atmosphere, which supplied the ingredients vital to evolve and sustain life. Over geologic eons, countless volcanic eruptions have produced mountains, plateaus, and plains, which subsequent erosion and weathering have sculpted into majestic landscapes and formed fertile soils.\n\nRisk management of El ChichÃ³n and TacanÃ¡ Volcanoes: Lessons learned from past volcanic crises: Chapter 8\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nDe la Cruz-Reyna, Servando; Tilling, Robert I.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBefore 1985, Mexico lacked civil-protection agencies with a mission to prevent and respond to natural and human-caused disasters; thus, the government was unprepared for the sudden eruption of El ChichÃ³n Volcano in MarchâApril 1982, which produced the deadliest volcanic disaster in the countryâs recorded history (~2,000 fatalities). With the sobering lessons of El ChichÃ³n still fresh, scientists and governmental officials had a higher awareness of possible disastrous outcome when TacanÃ¡ Volcano began to exhibit unrest in late 1985. Seismic and geochemical studies were quickly initiated to monitor activity. At the same time, scientists worked actively with officials of the Federal and local agencies to develop the âPlan Operativoâ (Operational Plan)âexpressly designed to effectively communicate hazards information and reduce confusion and panic among the affected population. Even though the volcano-monitoring data obtained during the TacanÃ¡ crisis were limited, when used in conjunction with protocols of the Operational Plan, they proved useful in mitigating risk and easing public anxiety. While comprehensive monitoring is not yet available, both El ChichÃ³n and TacanÃ¡ volcanoes are currently monitoredâseismically and geochemicallyâwithin the scientific and economic resources available. Numerous post-eruption studies have generated new insights into the volcanic systems that have been factored into subsequent volcano monitoring and hazards assessments. The State of Chiapas is now much better positioned to deal with any future unrest or eruptive activity at El ChichÃ³n or TacanÃ¡, both of which at the moment are quiescent as of 2014. Perhaps more importantly, the protocols first tested in 1986 at TacanÃ¡ have served as the basis for the development of risk-management practices for hazards from other active and potentially active volcanoes in Mexico. These practices have been most notably employed since 1994 at VolcÃ¡n PopocatÃ©petl since a major\n\nAlaska Volcano Observatory\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nVenezky, Dina Y.; Murray, Tom; Read, Cyrus\n\n2008-01-01\n\nSteam plume from the 2006 eruption of Augustine volcano in Cook Inlet, Alaska.

The amber-bearing beds in Chiapas constitute a Conservation LagerstÃ¤tte with outstanding organic preservation inside plant resin. The new species is diagnosed as having putative characters that largely correspond with the genus Tityus Koch, 1836 (Scorpiones, Buthidae). Accordingly, it is now referred to as Tityus apozonalli sp. nov. Its previously unclear phylogenetic relationship among fossil taxa of the family Buthidae from both Dominican and Mexican amber is also examined herein. Preliminarily results indicate a basal condition of T. apozonalli regarding to Tityus geratus Santiago-Blay and Poinar, 1988, Tityus (Brazilotityus) hartkorni LourenÃ§o, 2009, and Tityus azari LourenÃ§o, 2013 from Dominican amber, as was Tityus (Brazilotityus) knodeli LourenÃ§o, 2014 from Mexican amber. Its close relationships with extant Neotropic Tityus-like subclades such as âTityus clathratusâ and the subgenus Tityus (Archaeotityus) are also discussed.

Great Sitkin Island is located about 35 kilometers northeast of the community of Adak on Adak Island and 130 kilometers west of the community of Atka on Atka Island. Great Sitkin Volcano is an active volcano and has erupted at least eight times in the past 250 years (Miller and others, 1998). The most recent eruption in 1974 caused minor ash fall on the flanks of the volcano and resulted in the emplacement of a lava dome in the summit crater. The summit of the composite cone of Great Sitkin Volcano is 1,740 meters above sea level. The active crater is somewhat lower than the summit, and the highest point along its rim is about 1,460 meters above sea level. The crater is about 1,000 meters in diameter and is almost entirely filled by a lava dome emplaced in 1974. An area of active fumaroles, hot springs, and bubbling hot mud is present on the south flank of the volcano at the head of Big Fox Creek (see the map), and smaller ephemeral fumaroles and steam vents are present in the crater and around the crater rim. The flanking slopes of the volcano are gradual to steep and consist of variously weathered and vegetated blocky lava flows that formed during Pleistocene and Holocene eruptions. The modern edifice occupies a caldera structure that truncates an older sequence of lava flows and minor pyroclastic rocks on the east side of the volcano. The eastern sector of the volcano includes the remains of an ancestral volcano that was partially destroyed by a northwest-directed flank collapse. In winter, Great Sitkin Volcano is typically completely snow covered. Should explosive pyroclastic eruptions occur at this time, the snow would be a source of water for volcanic mudflows or lahars.

It has erupted hundreds of times during its half-million-year history, including nine times during the past 5,200 years, most recently 950 years ago. This record represents one of the highest eruptive frequencies among Cascade volcanoes and includes a wide variety of different types of lava flows and at least two explosive eruptions that produced widespread fallout. Compared to those of a typical Cascade stratovolcano, eruptive vents at MLV are widely distributed, extending 55 km north-south and 40 km east-west. The total area covered by MLV lavas is >2,000 km2, about 10 times the area of Mount St. Helens, Washington. Judging from its long eruptive history and its frequent eruptions in recent geologic time, MLV will erupt again. Although the probability of an eruption is very small in the next year (one chance in 3,600), the consequences of some types of possible eruptions could be severe. Furthermore, the documented episodic behavior of the volcano indicates that once it becomes active, the volcano could continue to erupt for decades, or even erupt intermittently for centuries, and very likely from multiple vents scattered across the edifice. Owing to its frequent eruptions, explosive nature, and proximity to regional infrastructure, MLV has been designated a 'high threat volcano' by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Volcano Early Warning System assessment. Volcanic eruptions are typically preceded by seismic activity, but with only two seismometers located high on the volcano and no other USGS monitoring equipment in place, MLV is at present among the most poorly monitored Cascade volcanoes.\n\nCynthia J.

Rio La Venta enters the reservoir via a narrow canyon about 16 km long with spectacular, near-vertical limestone bluffs up to 320 m high and inhabited by the flora and fauna of a pristine tropical forest.\n\nInstrumentation Recommendations for Volcano Monitoring at U.S. Volcanoes Under the National Volcano Early Warning System\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMoran, Seth C.; Freymueller, Jeff T.; LaHusen, Richard G.; McGee, Kenneth A.; Poland, Michael P.; Power, John A.; Schmidt, David A.; Schneider, David J.; Stephens, George; Werner, Cynthia A.; White, Randall A.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAs magma moves toward the surface, it interacts with anything in its path: hydrothermal systems, cooling magma bodies from previous eruptions, and (or) the surrounding 'country rock'. Magma also undergoes significant changes in its physical properties as pressure and temperature conditions change along its path. These interactions and changes lead to a range of geophysical and geochemical phenomena. The goal of volcano monitoring is to detect and correctly interpret such phenomena in order to provide early and accurate warnings of impending eruptions. Given the well-documented hazards posed by volcanoes to both ground-based populations (for example, Blong, 1984; Scott, 1989) and aviation (for example, Neal and others, 1997; Miller and Casadevall, 2000), volcano monitoring is critical for public safety and hazard mitigation. Only with adequate monitoring systems in place can volcano observatories provide accurate and timely forecasts and alerts of possible eruptive activity. At most U.S. volcanoes, observatories traditionally have employed a two-component approach to volcano monitoring: (1) install instrumentation sufficient to detect unrest at volcanic systems likely to erupt in the not-too-distant future; and (2) once unrest is detected, install any instrumentation needed for eruption prediction and monitoring. This reactive approach is problematic, however, for two reasons. 1. At many volcanoes, rapid installation of new ground-1. based instruments is difficult or impossible. Factors that complicate rapid response include (a) eruptions that are preceded by short (hours to days) precursory sequences of geophysical and (or) geochemical activity, as occurred at Mount Redoubt (Alaska) in 1989 (24 hours), Anatahan (Mariana Islands) in 2003 (6 hours), and Mount St. Helens (Washington) in 1980 and 2004 (7 and 8 days, respectively); (b) inclement weather conditions, which may prohibit installation of new equipment for days, weeks, or even months, particularly at\n\n\"Mediterranean volcanoes vs. chain volcanoes in the Carpathians\"\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChivarean, Radu\n\n2017-04-01\n\nVolcanoes have always represent an attractive subject for students. Europe has a small number of volcanoes and Romania has none active ones. The curricula is poor in the study of volcanoes. We want to make a parallel between the Mediterranean active volcanoes and the old extinct ones in the Oriental Carpathians. We made an comparison of the two regions in what concerns their genesis, space and time distribution, the specific relief and the impact in the landscape, consequences of their activities, etcâ¦ The most of the Mediterranean volcanoes are in Italy, in the peninsula in Napoli's area - Vezuviu, Campi Flegrei, Puzzoli, volcanic islands in Tirenian Sea - Ischia, Aeolian Islands, Sicily - Etna and Pantelleria Island. Santorini is located in Aegean Sea - Greece. Between Sicily and Tunisia there are 13 underwater volcanoes. The island called Vulcano, it has an active volcano, and it is the origin of the word. Every volcano in the world is named after this island, just north of Sicily. Vulcano is the southernmost of the 7 main Aeolian Islands, all volcanic in origin, which together form a small island arc. The cause of the volcanoes appears to be a combination of an old subduction event and tectonic fault lines. They can be considered as the origin of the science of volcanology. The volcanism of the Carpathian region is part of the extensive volcanic activity in the Mediterranean and surrounding regions. The Carpathian Neogene/Quaternary volcanic arc is naturally subdivided into six geographically distinct segments: Oas, Gutai, Tibles, Calimani, Gurghiu and Harghita. It is located roughly between the Carpathian thrust-and-fold arc to the east and the Transylvanian Basin to the west. It formed as a result of the convergence between two plate fragments, the Transylvanian micro-plate and the Eurasian plate. Volcanic edifices are typical medium-sized andesitic composite volcanoes, some of them attaining the caldera stage, complicated by submittal or peripheral domes\n\nVolcanoes\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKunar, L.
