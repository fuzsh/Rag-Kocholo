This means, “these people from a region of rubber, these people near the tree gourds” and it is where some scholars got the name “Olmeca” or “Olmec”.",

What qualifies as self-awareness? What qualifies as sentience? Can an intelligence not be sentient, but still report back that it is? Can something be sentient, but not intelligent enough to report back that it is? Can something be neither intelligent or sentient, but be statistically likely to compose sentences like it was trained on that fool a human into thinking it it both intelligent and sentient? How harmful can an AI become that can fool someone into thinking it is a person? How do we handle a case where an AI is a completely different \"personality\" (for lack of a better word) from one interaction to another and from one person to another? How do we a handle a being that has no consistent self-identity from one moment to another?\n\n11/15/2022"
