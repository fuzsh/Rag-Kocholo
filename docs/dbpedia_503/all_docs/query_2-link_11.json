        "text": "TUXTLA GUTI�RREZ\n\nCHIAPAS\n\n�\n\n�\n\n- PREHISPANIC EPOCH -\n\n- INDEPENDENCE -\n\n- COOL PLACES -\n\n[Home][Versi�n en espa�ol]\n\n�\n\nPREHISPANIC EPOCH\n\nThis city is located in Southeast of Mexico.It is the capital of Chiapas state. Its history goes back until prehispanic period when zoques, an indian group related with mixes from Oaxaca, spread from Zanatepec (Oaxaca) to Soconusco in Chiapas (Mapastepec, Tonal�, Escuintla are some locations placed in Soconusco). Xoconochco (Soconusco) was inhabited by mames, this region really was a paradise because the products extracted from there as cacao, birds and amber; so, some groups as the olmecas and toltecas wanted the mames to be subdued and get the control of this zone.Soconusco was a strategic region, it was the access to the quiche mayan zone in Guatemala. Thus, zoque group was obligated to move, by toltecas, to the mountains of central Chiapas. Finally, they established in a valley, close to the Sumidero Canyon. In that place Coyatocm� or Coyatoc (land of rabbits, in zoque language) was founded. Toltecas named this city Tochtl�n or Tuchtl�n, in their own language: nahuatl, it means land of rabbits too.\n\nAround VIth century another ethnic group came to Chiapas to establish in there. It is thought this group came from Central America, they were great warriors, had a brave and untamed spirit, their name: sectones, chiapa or chiapanecas. This group stablished beside Grijalva River or R�o Grande, in that place they founded their capital: Napinioka (Big Town, in chiapaneca language), also this city was known by its nahuatl name: Chia-p�n -as cited by some authors (chias�place)- or Chia-ap�n -as pointed by others- (chias�river, or water where chias grow). Chia is a prehispanic curative plant, its seeds were used to paint red tones. Zoque town was located near Chiap�n. Zoques could not resist the chiapanecas� warrior force and, finally, the strongest won.When spaniards arrived to Chiapas, in 1523, zoques were subdued by chiapanecas. But spaniards got the control of both populations. However, this control could not subsist a long time: native groups rebelled against europeans, so a new spanish invation took place in 1528. This time zoques joined european people because they believed it was an oportunity to get their freedom, to revenge, to dominate chiapanecas (but in fact it was only an spanish invalid promise: in the end europeans enslaved all native groups). Thus, chiapanecas warriors fought spanish conquerors in majestic Sumidero Canyon in a hard and bloody battle, fighting face to face. It is believed that chiapanecas decided to die when they saw that conquerors had the best armament and the likelihood of winning was very low; death was prefered rather than being damned to live as slaves; so, with decision and valor, chiapanecas dropped from the top of the Canyon (about 800 m high) to the waters of R�o Grande, the river who gave them life and name.\n\nTop\n\nINDEPENDENCE\n\nThere were three centuries of hispanic colonialism, during those years Chiapas belonged the Capitan�a General de Guatemala (Commander�s Jurisdiction of Guatemala). Airs of liberty spreading through all New Spain (Mexico) came soon to Chiapas, and Independence of Chiapas was proclaimed in1821 in Comit�n City by Mat�as de C�rdova and followed by Joaqu�n Miguel Guti�rrez in San Marcos Tuxtla Village. Actually this city is known as Tuxtla Guti�rrez in honour of our hero. New independent Chiapas joined the Iturbide�s empire: M�xico. However, Agust�n de Iturbide did not last a long time as a leader and when he left the power (1823) populations that had belonged to the Commander�s Jurisdiction of Guatemala decided to segregate from M�xico forming the United Provinces of Central America, with the exception of Chiapas which proclaimed the Plan of Free Chiapas, this document said \"...Province of Chiapas is free and independent of Mexico and the United Provinces of Central America\" until it decide to unite one of those countries. Next year, in 1824, a referendum was used to decide which country Chiapas must unite. Most people prefered to join Mexico. Thus, oficially, Chiapas belongs to Mexico since september 14th of 1824.\n\nTuxtla is capital of Chiapas state since 1892 when liberal groups from Tuxtla fought conservative ones from San Cristobal de las Casas (that city was, until that time, capital of Chiapas).\n\nTop\n\nCOOL PLACES\n\nIn Tuxtla you can visit the Zoo (called ZOOMAT: Zool�gico Miguel �lvarez del Toro) it is unique. In the begining of 80�s it was clasified as the best zoo all over Latin America, the reason: it only exhibits fauna from this region (as jaguar, quetzal, pumas, crocodiles, guacamayas, monkeys, and scorpion just to cite a few) and because the animals are within a natural-like place, this zoo is embebed in a tropical rainforest far from downtown.\n\nOur town also has two important museums: Natural History and Archeology and History Museums. In the first one you will find information about the origen of biodiversity of this region (Chiapas is one of the two more biodiverse states of Mexico, and Mexico is fourth in the world), some fossils and data about flora of Chiapas. In front of this museum there is a Botanic Garden when you can learn about our vegetal environment. Species exhibited in here are all from Chiapas. In the Museum of Archeology there is a wide colection of vestiges from important cultures that flourished in our state in different times: prehistory, early classic, classic, late classic and postclassic. Cultures very important such as olmecas, mames and mayas. In a separate room there is information about colonial and independent periods.\n\nAbout 15 Km from Tuxtla is located the majestic Sumidero Canyon, it was formed by the constant erosion that Grijalva River has produced in the central valley�s mountains. There are tours by boat through the river. Quay is located in Chiapa de Corzo town, tour takes about 45 minutes. Do not forget to bring your camara!\n\nIn the heart of Tuxtla there is a place where you can enjoy hearing regional music at night, from 7 to 9: the Parque de la Marimba (Park of Marimba). If you have not listened to marimba yet, we invite you to do it here\n\nYou should not forget to taste pozol and tazcalate: they are refreshing beverages prepared with maize (second one has a red color due to chia, a regional plant that also gives its name to our state: Chiap�n means chias� place or water where chias grow). We drink those cool drinks at midday, under this hot and humid climate they are always welcome. Tamales and cochito are food very delicious too.\n\nThis is brief description of our town that lies beside Mactumatza Hill�s foot. We are waiting for your questions and suggestions about this homepage.\n\nVisit our forum and write your opinion about the following topics: education, friendship, music, zapatistas and environment."
