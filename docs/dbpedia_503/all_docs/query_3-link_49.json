        "text": "Part 2 >>\n\nILLUSTRIOUS PEOPLE\n\nEiji Matsuda\n\nMatzuda Eiji, who for a long time dedicated himself to education in Taiwan, emigrated to Mexico, arriving in Escuintla in 1921 with the purpose of studying the Flora of Chiapas. For this purpose, he bought a small ranch located on the shores of Escuintla and named it “Esperanza.” From this moment he established his study center to carry out explorations in the Ovando mountain, a project that spanned nearly 20 years and that later gave him recognition as one of the best botanists in the world.\n\nDuring his stay in Chiapas, Matsuda Eiji ordered the construction of a school on his ranch in 1930, with the purpose of teaching the town's inhabitants to read and write. The literacy project was focused on the benefit of the community. This activity was one of the great contributions that Matsuda directed, because the town did not have a school, and the only one that existed until now (Aurora) had been built by the cooperative society for the Nisei descendants.\n\nLikewise, the commitment that he expressed to the people of Escuintla was aimed at teaching the reading of the Bible and the practice of the Christian faith. That is why he began to give talks at the “Esperanza” ranch, which in a short time managed to gain greater importance. So a facility was built that could accommodate more people. This is how the construction of the “good shepherd” temple was carried out, which today continues to be the main temple of what is currently Acacoyagua.\n\nThe valuable discoveries of exotic plants that Matsuda made gave him prestige as a botanical researcher, receiving recognition from large universities in Japan, Mexico and the United States. In 1950 he was invited by the Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) to teach botanical studies. In his practice as a teacher and researcher, he promoted the creation of the UNAM botanical garden in Toluca. Over time he became one of the most prominent botanists in the world. He finally died in 1978 in Peru carrying out new investigations.\n\nRenji Ota\n\nAdded to this contribution of illustrious figures is the work of Dr. Renji Ota, who, like Takahashi and Terui, was part of the 35 immigrants from the Enomoto colony and together with them, worked for the progress of the Cooperative society. He graduated from the Miyagi school of agronomy and was a disciple of Dr. Jinpei, who was a doctor from Escuintla. In 1908, Dr. Ota traveled back to Japan due to his mother's illness, who died shortly thereafter. It is during this trip to Japan that he married Hatsu Ota in Tokyo in May 1908, who accompanied him again to Chiapas, living in Escuintla from 1909 to 1917, the date on which he died.\n\nDuring this period, Mrs. Hatsu kept documents, letters and memoirs, which allowed her to write in 1970, at the age of 84, the diary that narrates her stay in Chiapas. In it, it is explained that upon his return to Escuintla, Dr. Ota dedicated himself to planting rice and corn on a small 45-meter ranch that by then had 30 calves. Renji Ota's purpose was to establish a company and leave the practice of medicine in Escuintla, an objective that he could not achieve because the inhabitants of the town continued to consider him as a doctor.\n\nOta's medical training was due to his dedicated commitment as an assistant to Dr. Jinpei Nihara. Who dies in Escuintla from yellow fever disease. Ota, who years before had studied veterinary medicine, incorporated the new knowledge for the practice of medicine, under the idea that “charity must inspire the practice of medicine or medicine has to be charitable” (Ota, 1970:16) . The affection that Renji Ota earned with the town, through his generosity, kindness and altruism, led to him being appointed municipal councilor for a short time, becoming one of the most respected people in the town.\n\nThe death of Dr. Ota, which occurred in 1917, was one of the most significant for the town of Escuintla and for the Enomoto neighborhood. The funeral was supported by all the people of the town, burying him in the municipal pantheon of Escuintla, where a monument was erected to his memory with the legend that reads as follows: “to the memory of the noble and generous Dr. Otta. As a testimony of the gratitude of his admirers from Escuintla, Acapetahua and Mapastepec.” \"Rest in peace\". Two more monuments were also built, by Mr. Horita who was a close friend of Ota. As well as, Eiji Matzuda who ordered a monument to be built in 1950. Currently the main street of Escuintla is called Av. Dr. Ota.\n\n* * *\n\nIn conclusion, it can be said that the effort that the Enomoto colony showed, despite the various circumstances such as the lack of knowledge of the Chiapas lands, the planting of coffee trees, as well as the diseases and the process of the Mexican revolution. It opened the way for future immigration projects throughout the Mexican Republic. The same thing resulted in the emergence of new massive immigrations in Mexico and Latin America, a factor that continued to favor international agreements, until today.\n\nA look from the inside, as the title points out, allows us to reconnect with the past that today celebrates 115 years of history, and that is still present in the collective memory of the Nikkei of Soconusco Chiapas. Therefore, to look back at those men who traced the paths of a migratory project is to return to the roots, to the traces marked in time. That allows us to name history, remember it and live it, thus preventing us from falling into the box of oblivion. The Nikkei identity is past and present, it is built over time, not just named.\n\nBibliography\n\nBonfil Battle Guillermo. 1993. Symbiosis of cultures. Immigrants and their culture in Mexico.
