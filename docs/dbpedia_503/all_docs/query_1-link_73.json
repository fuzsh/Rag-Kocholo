        "text": "Guatemala plans to connect its 800km railway network with the 200bn-peso (US$9.8bn), 1,500km Maya train that will cross five southeastern Mexican states.\n\n“Southern Mexico will be linked [to Guatemala] soon,” Antonio Malouf, Guatemala’s economy minister, told BNamericas.\n\nMexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) offered Guatemala’s President Alejandro Giammattei a rail link to access the passenger and freight rail line, Malouf said.\n\nBut a Mexican-British company is also about to sign a deal with Guatemala’s state-owned railway development company Ferrovías, a subsidiary of Ferrocarriles de Guatemala (Fegua), to rehabilitate the rail link between Tecún Umán in San Marcos department, bordering Mexico’s Chiapas state, and Quetzal port in Escuintla department, he said.\n\nThis rail stretch is part of the first of a three-stage plan to implement the 700km Bicentenario train, a publicly financed rail corridor from the Guatemala-Mexico border to Puerto Barrios port in Izabal department on the Atlantic coast, crossing almost the entire country.\n\nAlthough related, the Bicentenario train is a different project than the Mexico-Guatemala link to the Maya train.\n\nBoth are included in a Ferrovías master plan to rehabilitate 821km of rails to improve commercial links between Mexico and Guatemala.\n\nIn the long term, both trains could facilitate trade in Central America and the link between San Marcos and Mexico’s Chiapas state could capture 5-10% of the trade that passes the Mexican-Guatemalan border near Tecún Umán railway station, according to the master plan.\n\nEnabling a rail link with Mexico will allow Guatemala to boost exports to the Yucatán Peninsula and the US, Malouf said, adding his country is already mulling upgrading its port, airport, highway and logistics infrastructure to help the project.\n\nThe government is also mulling other port modernizations on the Atlantic coast that could become part of the rail corridor.\n\nBelize also announced at the end of September that it was seeking to connect to the Maya train.\n\nMexico-Guatemala train\n\nWhen Giammattei announced the Mexico-Guatemala rail link in November 2020, he said he expected to sign an agreement with AMLO by the end of that year.\n\nUpdates have not been provided since, but on August 9 Ferrovías said a four-wagon train from Ciudad Hidalgo in Chiapas arrived at Tecún Umán railway station. \"These tests are a small step for trade between the two countries,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"There is still pending work to be done, both in terms of infrastructure and procedures and permits with tax authority SAT for the creation of a customs office that allows commercial exchange with Mexico and generate the economic and social development of the region,\" Ferrovías said.\n\nIn March, BNamericas reported SAT was completing a warehouse on the border as part of efforts to provide the facilities necessary to reopen.\n\nMexico’s national tourism board Fonatur, in charge of supervising the Maya train, did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nBicentenario train details\n\nStage one of the project involves rehabilitating 235km of rail lines from Tecún Umán city to Quetzal port, with a 30km branch from Retalhuleu department to Champerico port. Stage two comprises 250km from Puerto Barrios port to El Rancho city near El Progreso port, and stage three 165km from Escuintla department to El Rancho.\n\nIt contemplates seven terminal projects, especially at the Quetzal, Barrios, and Chemperico ports. Stage two also involves the 74km El Estor-Mariscos highway, the 75km Zacapa-Angiatu highway, and the 15km Entre Ríos-Santo Tomás de Castilla highway.\n\nFerrovías has launched nine tenders related to the Bicentenario since 2020 to lay the foundations for the project, according to procurement documents on the company’s site.\n\nTwo of these concern the first and second stages’ pre-feasibility and demand studies.\n\nThe contract for the stage one studies was awarded in August and stage two’s in January, according to procurement documents on the Ferrovías site. Yet, the contracts or the winners have not been made public.\n\nThe train’s first stage studies could be conducted by the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (Cabei) in collaboration with the Export-Import bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) and Guatemala’s Fegua.\n\nCabei announced in January a series of studies it would help finance to connect Central America via rail lines. One such study refers to a \"Guatemalan segment of railway connection in Central America.\"\n\nThe bank has not specifically said that it is working on the Bicentenario train studies’ first stage, but in a July statement, it said the rail line would run from Tecún Umán to Guatemala City “with a length of 274km, made up of three sections, Tecún Umán-Mazatenango, Mazatenango-Santa María and Santa María-Guatemala City.”\n\nThe studies received US$466,900 from the South Korean economy and finance ministry’s knowledge exchange program."
