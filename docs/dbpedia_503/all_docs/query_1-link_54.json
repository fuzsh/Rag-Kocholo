        "text": "This study provides an isotopic examination of both human and animal paleodiets and mobility patterns at a highland Maya community. Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala, was a large Prehispanic center located in a distinctly cooler, drier setting compared with the majority of Maya sites in the surrounding lowlands. Previous archaeological research at Kaminaljuyu revealed it played an important political and economic role in the Maya region, assisting in the obsidian trade network and maintaining ties with communities as far away as Teotihuacan in central Mexico. By examining the strontium (87 Sr/ 86 Sr), carbon (δ 13 C), and oxygen (δ 18 O) isotope values from dental enamel of humans and terrestrial mammals at the site, this study provides direct evidence of long-distance animal trade, explores the nature and timing of such activities, and compares highland dietary patterns with faunal studies in the lowlands. Our results indicate that isotopically non-local humans and animals are most frequently found in special and ceremonial contexts, indicating that long-distance movements of people and products were motivated for politically or ritually significant events. Although dietary patterns showed cross-species variation, diets within species were similar between highland and lowland settings.\n\nReceived 22 May 2012 Revision received 7 July 2013 Keywords: Maya Mobility Migration Isotopes Provenience Human remains Strontium Oxygen Carbon Enclave Introduction Copan has been a World Heritage site since 1980. The archaeo- logical site, located in western Honduras near the Guatemalan bor- der, was once the important capital of a Classic Maya state. The ruins of the ancient city extend over an area of approximately 16 km2 in the Copan Valley, one of the best-preserved centers in the entire Maya region. Small farming communities appeared in the valley ca. 1400 BC and monumental construction at Copan itself began during the late Preclassic and the first part of the Early Classic period (ca. AD 200–400). In AD 426/427, a royal dynasty was founded at Copan by a foreign individual known as K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo’. His reign was followed by a sequence of 15 rulers who governed the city and its surrounding polity for a period of some 400 years, until ca. AD 822 (Andrews and Fash, 2005; Bell et al., 2004; Fash, 2001; Martin and Grube, 2008; Price et al., 2009; Webster et al., 2000). ⇑ Corresponding author. E-mail address: tdprice@wisc.edu (T.D.

All rights reserved. abstract Strontium, oxygen and carbon isotopes are measured in human tooth enamel from 32 human burials in structural complex 10J-45 at the Classic Maya site of Copan in western Honduras. These results are com- pared with similar information from the Copan Acropolis, common graves throughout the site, and base- line information from the surrounding region and the Maya area in general. More than one-third of the burials are identified as non-local based on strontium and oxygen isotope ratios. These non-local individ- uals came from a variety of different places. Two of these persons appear to be dynastic rulers or highly placed nobles in Copan society. The high density of non-locals and the location of the burials suggest this area may have been an enclave of foreign Maya at the site. The presence of non-local rulers in both this area and the Acropolis supports the concept of ‘‘stranger kings’’ in the Maya realm.\n\nWe analyzed strontium isotopes in more than 500 samples of shell, bone, and dental enamel from modern and archaeolog ical contexts throughout Mesoamerica. The results correspond closely with expectations based upon the local geology and earlier measurements of geological materials. The results show that isotopic variation is significant across Mesoamerica. Thus strontium isotope ratios in dental enamel, which mark the place of childhood residence, can be used not only to doc ument mobility but also in some cases to determine geographic origin. We present five archaeological case studies to illus trate the anthropological significance and range of applications for this technique: the origins of individuals in the \"Oaxaca Barrio\" at Teotihuacan, a northern origin for the founder of Copan, a local king at Tikal, the regional origin of two of Palenque's rulers, and individuals of African birth in a colonial cemetery in Campeche. Se evaluawn las proporciones isotopicas de estroncio en mas de quinientas muestras fosiles y modernas de concha, hueso y esmalte dental, colectadas en numerosos sitios de toda Mesoamerica. Los resultados reflejan estrechamente las expectativas fundamentadas en la geologia local y algunas medidas previas que habian sido obtenidas de diferentes sustratos geologicos. Los presentes datos se empleardn en el diseho de un mapa rector que mostrard pan-regionalmente los rangos de relacion isotopica de estroncio. Se puede utilizarse el analisis de las proporciones isotopicas de estroncio en el esmalte dental, el cual retiene las caracteristicas del lugar de nacimientos, no solo para investigar aspectos generales de movilidad, sino tambien para determinar el origen geogrdfico de un individuo. Aqui se presentan cinqo estudios de caso arqueologicos que ilustran la relevancia y gama de aplicaciones de esta tecnica: los origenes de los individuos del \"Barrio Oaxaqueho^ en Teotihuacan; la procedencia de elfundadordel linaje dindstico de Copan, del norte; el origen intra-regional de la \"Reina Roja \" de Palenque y de Janaab' Pakal; asi como la identificacion de esclavos oriundos de Africa en un cementerio colonial de Campeche.\n\nMigration is an important factor in the process of urbanization in past and present cities. This study presents new stable carbon and oxygen isotope data from 38 human individuals buried at the ancient Zapotec city of Monte Alban in the modern state of Oaxaca, Mexico. Both bone and enamel tissues were sampled, providing the opportunity to explore mobility over different phases of individuals' lives. The results document the presence of two statistical outliers and three other individuals who were likely born in foreign locations. One of these non-local individuals (T.8-1(A)) exhibits exceptionally high stable oxygen isotope values in both bone and enamel tissues, suggesting he was born and spent most of his life in a region outside of the valley of Oaxaca, perhaps within the city of Teotihuacan in the Basin of Mexico. The other non-local and possible non-local individuals exhibit outlying stable isotope values in their teeth, but not their bones, suggesting they had moved to Monte Alban many years before death. The results of this study are contextualized within a broader discussion about the nature of the relationship between Monte Alban and Teotihuacan and the possibility of using stable oxygen isotope analysis to detect migration in pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica.\n\nIsotopic data are regularly employed to investigate and reconstruct migration, diet, and other anthropological questions about the past. Here we present new radiogenic strontium isotope values for western Honduras that have been understudied in relation to mobility among the ancient Maya in Mesoamerica. We employ biologically available isotopic compositions (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) derived from local fauna and plants to create a baseline for these regions to determine the degree of movement into populations at Late Classic (600–820 CE) Copan, Honduras. Our results demonstrate that while movement certainly occurred within the Maya region, it also may have included areas beyond the perceived physical and cultural boundaries of the Maya world. We focus on the biogeochemical data to highlight how paleomobility (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) data should be used cautiously to understand mobility across Mesoamerica, and to consider how non-Maya peoples were likely part of Maya communities.\n\nMobility among the ancient Maya at Caledonia, Cayo District, Belize was investigated using stable oxygen isotope analysis of 15 bone and five tooth enamel carbonate samples. While all samples exhibited values expected for the site area, some variation was detected. Three individuals from Burial 1 had the most positive bone oxygen isotope values, indicating they may have lived elsewhere before moving to Caledonia later in life. The difference between the enamel and bone oxygen isotope values suggests a non-local origin for one individual from Burial 3. Finally, the four individuals who may have consumed marine protein exhibited local bone oxygen isotope values and likely did not move to Caledonia from a coastal region in the last several years of their lives."
