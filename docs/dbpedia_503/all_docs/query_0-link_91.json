        "text": "King cobra, black mamba, taipan, habu, diamondback, bushmaster, fer-de-lance…\n\n…are all venomous snake names that bring gleams to eyes in the marketing departments of armament and tactical gear manufacturers, not to mention those of “extreme” nature documentary filmmakers. For the rest of us, they evoke images of the defensive postures of some of tropical wilderness’ most lethal residents as they rear up to confront threats.\n\nI’ll start this off by saying that, despite contemporary interest associated with this storied name, it seems nowadays no-one other than some ecotour guides, online journalists, and hidebound Gringo reptile collectors call Central American viperid snakes “fer-de-lance”. This is a Creole-French term coined by naturalist Bernard-Germaine de Lacépède following a visit to the southeastern Caribbean in the late 18th century and means spear- or lancehead, an allusion to these snakes’ crown shape when viewed from above. While it is still mentioned in the herpetological literature in association with Martinican and St. Lucian lanceheads (Bothrops lanceolatus and B. caribbaeus), it is not used on the islands where these snakes occur and apparently never has been (Campbell and Lamar, 1989; 2004; W. Lamar, pers. comm.)! Some make the case that this is a good optional common name for the very widespread South American lancehead (B. atrox) but, other than in Guyane/French Guiana, I disagree. Why fer-de-lance would be an appropriate name for two snake species whose ranges are otherwise restricted to countries where indigenous languages, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, and English are spoken–but not French–is a bit of a mystery to me.\n\nBut it certainly caught your attention, didn’t it?\n\nAinsi, les fer-de-lance ensuite!\n\nIn 1934, American crime fiction writer Rex Stout published the classic Nero Wolfe murder mystery “Fer-de-Lance” in an obvious nod to both an earlier tale of his own, “The Last Drive” (1916), and Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous Sherlock Holmes short story, “The Adventure of the Speckled Band” (1892). Both works of suspense employ improbably compliant exotic venomous snakes and elaborate mechanical devices to assist the murderers in dispatching their victims.\n\nDetective fiction author, screenwriter, and literary legend Raymond Chandler, of “The Big Sleep” (1939) and “The Long Goodbye” (1953) fame, who was also a discerning and respected critic of crime stories, shook his head and chuckled at these types of farcically complex murder plots, evoking, “…hand-wrought dueling pistols, curare and tropical fish…” in “The Simple Art of Murder” (1950).\n\nIn one devastating passage, Chandler managed to run a double-decker bus over not only Conan Doyle and Stout, but also the popular 20th century suspense writers Agatha Christie and Sax Rohmer.\n\nThus ended the hopes of future starring roles for tropical vipers in highbrow crime fiction.\n\nAmong the larger and more notorious venomous, (or “hot”) snake species around the world that inspire anxiety in people who coexist with them in nature, the reality is that most are fairly rare, retiring, and non-confrontational animals when encountered in the field. Nonetheless, accidental or intentional close contact with any of them can be a hair-raising and life-threatening experience when an alarmed, highly venomous snake opts for “fight” rather than “flight”.\n\nThe species I will discuss here is Bothrops asper (Garman, 1883), a very formidable animal in every way, whose Latin binomial’s free translation is “the pit-faced rough one”. This snake’s scientific name has traveled a rather meandering taxonomic path since its first description in 1868 and is once again the subject of debate, which I will now sidestep and forget about for the rest of this article.\n\nIn actuality, the names used by rural people for this species are myriad across the northern American tropics and a small sample include: nauyaca/nauyaca real (México), cantíl cola de hueso or nauyaca cola de hueso (Guatemala and México), tamagás (Guatemala), devanador (Guatemala), barba amarilla (Guatemala, Belize, Honduras and western Nicaragua), Ik’bolay (Guatemala), tommygoff/yellowjaw tommygoff (Belize), terciopelo and toboba (Costa Rica, southeastern Nicaragua, and western Panamá), equis (Panamá), boquidorá (Caribbean Colombia), mapaná/mapanare (Colombia), and Central American lancehead (U.S.). Many American and British herpetologists, reptile collectors, and regional ecotourists seem to have adopted the rather sexy Costa Rican designation “terciopelo” for common name usage in English, which is also fine by me.\n\nDespite being unrelated and quite different in their respective ecologies, in terms of medical importance and ability to sustain viable populations near human habitation in rural areas despite constant persecution, barba amarilla appears to have parallels throughout much of Africa with puff adders (Bitis arietans) and in tropical Asia with Russell’s vipers (Daboia russelii; Conan Doyle’s infamous “Speckled Band” mentioned above). At maturity all are large, heavy bodied viperids with long fangs, sizeable venom glands, highly toxic venoms, large litter sizes and–often it seems–hair triggers when closely approached by humans or livestock.\n\nEnvenomation by Near Eastern, Asian, and American pitvipers can be extremely serious and life-changing events even if the snake is one of the smaller species or a juvenile. I have had healthy adult male friends hospitalized for days following bites by captive neonate Neotropical pitvipers. While a surprisingly high percentage of pitviper bites appear to be “dry” (i.e., little or no detectable venom is injected during the bite), a small but significant percentage can involve unnerving instances where the snake may even sink its teeth into its victims’ extremities, hang on bulldog tight, and deliberately pump large amounts of venom into the musculature of its antagonist. This type of bite always has serious, and sometimes permanent, consequences for the victims. Given the complexity of venom chemistry across populations of even the same pitviper species that sometimes include neurotoxins, snakes’ lethality can vary enormously from one region to the next. This is (in)famously the case in Mojave rattlesnakes (Crotalus s. scutulatus) in the southwestern U.S. and northern México and cascabels (C. durissus, most subspecies) in South America. Venom from specific populations of C. scutulatus (so-called “venom A secretors”), have been shown to be >10X more toxic than snakes that lack this enzyme subunit.\n\nYou definitely don’t really want to find out whether the pitviper that might bite you has an obscure active neurotoxic component to its venom or not.\n\nVenomous snakebite is considered a rare accident even in the wet tropical lowlands, but it is not altogether that rare in some regions of the world. A fairly recent study based on careful analysis of public health records across the American tropics suggests ~60,000 bites annually, with approximately 370 victims dying every year from bites (Chippaux, 2017). Data is known to be both incomplete and usually very retrospective. It is widely accepted that significant undercounting occurs since a high number of cases, particularly in remote areas, never reach treatment centers (Gutiérrez, 2014). In 2017 it was recategorized as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization (WHO) following its removal in 2013 after only four years (Tumang Frare et al., 2017). For what it’s worth, the WHO’s current estimates for snakebite fatalities in the Neotropics are much, much higher than those documented in the recent Chippaux survey (Chippaux, 2017; WHO, 2019). Morbidity and mortalities have no doubt been greatly reduced since the advent of antivenin in the early 20th century and its improved efficacy dating from recent decades. The vast majority of both envenomations and fatalities in the Neotropics involve Bothrops species and among these the lion’s share are attributed to our star actor, B. asper, and its slightly smaller but equally short-tempered sibling species, B. atrox.\n\nA severe Bothrops asper envenomation can produce horrific effects on those unfortunate enough to get chomped, and falls firmly into the, “No thanks, none for me today!” category. I’ll forego the usual X-rated clinical shots of bitten extremities, but curious or morbid readers can easily find cringe-inducing examples online. Suffice to say that common early effects include sustained and stabbing pain, major edema caused by an impeded lymph flow, bleeding from gums, upper respiratory tract tissue, tear ducts, ears and other orifices, partial blindness, rapid fleshy tissue discoloration, and resultant necrosis. Later effects of even moderate envenomations include dermal tissue sloughing and blistering around the bite marks in a high percentage of cases. All this as well as troublesome secondary infections associated with these exposed lesions. Anything other than an obviously dry or very mild bite requires prompt antivenin and other support therapy to neutralize the venom’s effects and save a victim’s limb or life.\n\nDespite outsized media attention paid to the infinitesimal number of snake-related accidents U.S. and European tourists suffer in Costa Rica, it is actually Panamá that has the highest per capita incidence of snakebite both in the region (~1,800-2,800 reported annually depending on the author/s) and in Latin America as a whole (Gutiérrez, 2014; Pecchio et al., 2018). Notwithstanding this relatively high number of envenomations for the country’s size, fatalities are surprisingly low (~20-30 a year) and a tribute to antivenin therapy. Panamanian snakebite numbers are very likely linked to the low elevations that prevail throughout much of the country, together with lightly to moderately disturbed habitats and high rainfall that favors high population densities of Bothrops asper. This snake is responsible for approximately 45% of all documented bites and almost all of the fatalities there (Pecchio et al., 2018).\n\nWhile some mature individuals found prowling about at night on the forest floor or streamside can be shadowed cautiously at a distance with a headlight fully on them for several minutes before they decide to disappear under a log, glide down a hole, swim away or–in a trick guaranteed to get your attention–simply vanish into darkness, others instantly fall back into a fighting coil, raise their heads, and rapidly beat their tails on the ground in warning. A thoroughly annoyed barba amarilla will not hesitate to make long, lightning fast, multiple strikes towards anyone who chooses to press forward in unambiguous, “GO AWAY!!” messaging. I have never had one turn fully offensive and start moving towards me in an overt manner, but they will certainly fire both barrels at you even while semi-extended and in rapid movement if you’re along or astride their escape route. This sometimes erratic “slide-stop-strike” flight behavior is likely the source of widespread reports in rural northern Latin America that these snakes will not hesitate to attack when closely approached. Their speed over very short distances and unnerving habit of abruptly switching direction requires extreme care when within a few feet/meters of one that’s so angered or fearful it’s bumping against the rev limiter in terms of a defensive response. A recent, well-documented regional study showed that foot and lower leg bites represent ~75% of all cases (Laínez-Mejía et al., 2017) so calf high rubber boots are certainly very useful for protection. Light hiking boots are not. Bites on hands and forearms are also a real risk. I shudder when I think of the horrendous effects and almost certain fatal consequences that getting bitten on the face or neck by a big one would result in; both a close friend and an acquaintance have miraculously escaped this type of accident while in the field in Costa Rica.\n\nNeotropical venomous snake researcher Bill Lamar, in what I find a particularly good insight, has called this species “inscrutable” in that it seems as if they themselves don’t really know how they are going to react until they actually flip the switch. As evidence he recently wrote me that, ”…I have had them lie motionless, even when stepped upon; I've had them coil into a defensive ball; one shot between my legs as it fled; I've had one run up me better than halfway before abruptly turning around; and one that I will never forget…”\n\nYou get the point.\n\nUnpredictable.\n\nBarba amarilla alarm responses to potential human threats are the byproduct of a defensive arsenal refined over millions, not thousands, of years. It is highly likely that the impressive counter threat behaviors that many larger New World pitvipers employ have evolved entirely to impress and deter mammalian predators such as the tropical forest peccary species (Pecari tajacu and Tayassu pecari) and large opossums (Didelphis marsupialis), all of which are known to show resistance to crotaline venoms and occasionally feed on Bothrops, Crotalus and Lachesis species (Almeida-Santos et al., 2000; Sasa, Wasko and Lamar, 2009; W. Lamar, pers. comm.).\n\nThis species occurs along the Gulf coast of México from the El Cielo Biosphere Reserve in southwestern Tamaulipas state (located ~200 miles/320 km south of McAllen, Texas) throughout the southeast to the Caribbean coastal areas of the southern Yucatán Peninsula, Belize, the Pacific slope of the Sierra Madre of Chiapas, México and the volcanic piedmont of western and central Guatemala, throughout the Caribbean and Gulf slopes of Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, both slopes in Costa Rica, Panamá, and Caribbean Venezuela, both slopes in Colombia as well as the upper Amazon basin, the Pacific slopes of Ecuador and into northern Perú. While irregularly distributed from sea level to middle elevation cloud forests throughout much of its range, it is usually much more common in lowland tropical rainforest or disturbed lowland habitats than at higher elevational levels (Campbell and Lamar, 1989; pers. obs.).\n\nBarba amarilla are extremely variable in terms of pattern and color, both ontogenetically as well as across populations. Generally speaking, the ecotypes in southeastern México and northern Guatemala tend to towards gray, buff to reddish brown colors with chalk, cream or clear white cross marks on their backs, while Costa Rican and western Panamanian Bothrops asper can have very bold chocolate brown, dark gray or black ground colors with pure white, yellow or pale pink cross marking. Northern South American examples of this species may bear little resemblance to most of their Mesoamerican cousins (Campbell and Lamar, 1989; 2004).\n\nBesides the considerable dorsal color and design changes evident across its range, at some localities barbas that have disproportionately large heads in relation to their body mass represent a small but conspicuous percentage of those encountered in the field (see image below and M. Fogden’s photograph of another in Savage, 2002). At one time I believed this might just another uncommonly expressed manifestation of sexual dimorphism in this species, but I have since realized that it does not appear to be correlated to the gender of the snake and is just an unusual individual trait. Presumably these “big-headed” snakes are able to feed on larger prey items due to their ability to distend their jaws wider than the average example they coexist with. What’s going on with this peculiar morphological variant? Are they evolving to someday be able to swallow naughty children who stay up past their bedtimes?\n\nWho knows?\n\nIn the forested tropical lowlands of eastern Guatemala, like other areas on the Caribbean coast of Central America and Colombia, barba amarilla are likely to be the most conspicuous snake seen by nightwalkers and can be especially abundant in some very productive secondary forest localities. In a 1920’s study conducted just east of Guatemala’s Izabal Department in the vicinity of Lancetilla, in Honduras’ Atlántida Department, one out of every 10 snakes brought into the old Serpentarium and venom extraction lab for identification were Bothrops asper.\n\nThese snakes are commonly found near permanent water such as rivers, streams, and swamps, as well as the aguadas that dot the lower Yucatán Peninsula. In my experience in Guatemala and from comments made by Costa Rican and Panamanian friends, the highest population densities in Central America occur in or adjacent to the interface of mature primary forest and pastures or recently planted tree crops. They can be particularly abundant in old growth African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations in Central America (C. Moya, pers. comm.; A. Solorzano, pers. comm.; pers. obs.). They may also be commonly encountered in the vicinity of rural refuse tips in the lowlands due to the presence of increased rodent populations. Juveniles and smaller adults may be arboreal, and fatal bites have been reported from young snakes encountered in trees.\n\nHome ranges for both sexes in lightly disturbed lowland rainforest in northern Costa Rica range from 9.25 acres/3.7 ha. to 15 acres/~6 ha. Daily movements typically are less than 35’/10 m from daytime refuge to ambush site followed by less frequent longer distance movements when prey is depleted in any given area (Sasa, Wasko & Lamar, 2009).\n\nImages: ©F. Muller 2020.\n\nJuvenile barba amarilla are sexually dichromatic with males having white or pale-yellow tails (shown above left in a richly-colored eastern Panamanian snake), while females have pale-pink or pinkish brown tails (shown above right in a northwestern Guatemalan example). The conspicuous pale tail color in young males is the origin of the “cola de hueso” (bone tail) and “rabo amarillo” (yellow tail) suffixed names across its range (e.g., toboba rabo amarillo in some parts of Costa Rica). I have observed young examples of both sexes employ them in caudal luring to attract small lizards introduced to their enclosures as food items, as was also the case for many other young Neotropical pitviper species I have kept. When small they feed largely on a variety of arthropods, small lizards and frogs, then shift to small and mid-sized rodents as they mature. Sizeable adult females are capable of dispatching and consuming mammals as large as medium-sized opposums (Didelphis, Caluromys, and Philander species), young agouti (Dasyprocta species), probably juvenile coatis (Nasua species) and hog-nosed skunks (Conepatus species). Although I have not seen evidence of bird remains in fresh feces of large wild collected Bothrops asper held in captivity, they do feed opportunistically on any suitably sized birds such as ground thrushes (Turdidae) and tinamou (Tinamidae) together with others they may encounter (Sasa, Waska and Lamar, 2009). The hunt for arboreal frogs and small, sleeping perched birds may explain the presence of young adults in trees (Vega-Coto et al., 2015). Mature examples can shift back to feeding on large frogs in the absence of suitably sized mammalian prey (Wasko & Sasa, 2009; Sasa, Wasko and Lamar, 2009).\n\nThere is some controversy over the maximum size this species can achieve. The apparent record length for this species in Costa Rica and Panamá exceeds 7’/2.15 m (Solorzano, 2004; see below). Despite unconfirmed published reports indicating lengths over 8’/2.50 m that have become gospel among snake collectors for almost 100 years (see Ditmars, 1931; Ripa, 2002; and Savage, 2002 for three examples), a recent quick canvassing of a trio of New World herpetologists who are experts on this species and that included a review by one of them of almost 350 preserved specimens held in American museums revealed no Bothrops asper exceeding 6.70’/2.06 m in length (Lamar, pers. comm.). The largest female that I ever handled was just over 6.5’/2 m long and was collected in low elevation cloud forest at Finca Rosario Vista Hermosa on the Pacific slope of Guatemala’s Volcán de Agua in the Department of Escuintla. This locality also yielded several other very large female B. asper over the years. She fed well from the start, was fairly heavy bodied throughout and probably weighed in excess of 10 lbs/4.5 kg during much of her stay with me. I kept her in my study collection for several years before donating as a live specimen to a local university. The largest live animal I’ve ever seen was another huge female from Limón Province at the Universidad de Costa Rica’s venom lab, the Instituto Clodomiro Picado. Costa Rican herpetologist and author Alejandro Solorzano showed me this enormous if light bodied snake in the late 1980s. Because it fed indifferently at the time it was rather slender when I saw it, but the head was certainly the size of my fully outstretched palm. Alejandro subsequently put a tape measure on this exceptional individual towards the end of its life, and it measured 7.25’/2.23 m (Lamar, pers. comm.). This is, as far as I am aware, the longest B. asper reported by an unimpeachable source.\n\nThe classic grainy image, purportedly of Douglas March, taken in Lancetilla, Honduras in the late-1920s with what is claimed to be an eight-footer/2.45 m that is shown here in Ditmars (1931) is likely an intentional exaggeration and the relative size of the barba amarilla in the photo an artifice of foreshortened perspective. In my opinion, shared by others I know who have handled and photographed dozens of very large Bothrops asper, based on the snake’s rather small head size coupled with its girth, as well as compared with other images taken contemporaneously of different individuals posing with large B. asper at the same gate to the snake pit at the Serpentarium in Lancetilla (Balloffet, 2020), it is highly unlikely that this animal is much more than 6’/1.85 m long.\n\nImmobility is probably the least reported defensive response in crotalines when facing mammalian threats, but was reportedly the most common defensive behavior shown by South American rattlesnakes, Crotalus durissus facing predation in one study at the Instituto Butantan in São Paolo, Brazil (Almeida-Santos et al., 2000). I have two firsthand experiences where apparently healthy adult Bothrops asper have feigned death (thanatosis or tonic immobility) when confronted by humans.\n\nOn the first occasion, I was walking on a gravel railroad embankment at midday near Puerto Barrios, Izabal Department, Guatemala when I detected slight movement alongside the rails far ahead. I continued walking and finally came across a barba amarilla about 40”/1.0 m long, motionless and partially rolled on its side. I paused for a fairly close but superficial examination of the snake and, despite no sign of external injuries, it seemed quite dead. I assumed that it had been struck a glancing blow by a passing freight train or killed by some other shock earlier in the day. Without actually touching it with my sneaker shod foot or doing anything else rash, I started walking again. Continuing on for about 30’/9 m, I turned to glance back at it. To my astonishment the snake was slowly crossing the tracks with normal motion and no evidence of having been wounded, then sped up and fast disappeared over the side of the embankment and into the weeds as I returned. Perhaps it was just stunned when I found it and recovered immediately afterwards, but in light of the following event I don’t really think so.\n\nThe second case of one playing ‘possum involved a freshly captured captive Caribbean coast barba in my personal collection that was determined to have died overnight during the course of a routine late morning inspection by Haroldo García, my animal keeper. Haroldo had a great deal of experience manipulating both captive and wild native venomous reptiles, as well as exotic venomous snakes of many genera. He was, if such a thing is possible, generally overcautious in the way he handled hot snakes. He later swore up and down that he was extremely careful to ascertain that it was absolutely dead by shifting the Neodesha case it was in back and forth several times and seeing it flip upside down, limp and motionless. Haroldo then slid the door back, reached inside to remove it bare-handed and instantly received a full bite from the now obviously live and fully alert snake. He communicated all this to me in slow, painfully measured detail during an emergency call interrupting a heated business meeting I was in that then had me racing to a nearby private hospital to meet up with him and the 20 ampoules of Costa Rican polyvalent crotaline antivenin he had brought from the house. By the great grace of God, despite having received a full tag with both fangs on the base of his thumb by a ~4.5’/1.50 m newly caught Bothrops asper, it was a dry bite. My thoroughly chastened employee was discharged from hospital after eight hours of observation, a tetanus shot and bandaged thumb with nothing really wounded but his pride and my credit card.\n\nThe snake was, somewhat surprisingly to me, perfectly fine when I checked on it the next day and lived for more than a year afterwards.\n\nSo, are barbas really as crazy cantankerous as many regional campesinos and some naturalists would have us believe?\n\nMost times, probably not, since they’d be easy targets for avian predators or a machete if they lashed out madly at everything that passed by. Given their relative abundance in some areas, cryptic coloration and small size when coiled, it seems pretty obvious to me that many hundreds of thousands of rural people in northern Latin America must walk right by one every day without even seeing them, much less getting struck at. While I would say that those that I have come across during the day were generally, but not always, given to gliding quickly away when discovered, most large adults I have encountered after dark are altogether different creatures and whenever approached became–take your pick–a). visibly nervous, b). obviously testy, or c). borderline hysterical. In defense of these pitvipers’ responses, being suddenly confronted and confused with blinding light, strange tastes and smells in addition to the kind of vibrations that may herald the appearance of a large predator or other dangerous creature is enough to ruin anyone’s evening.\n\nCue main theme to “Close Encounters of the Third Kind”.\n\nSo just how fast can these snakes strike when they’re motivated? On many late afternoons I have watched relaxed subadult captive-raised bushmasters (Lachesis stenophrys and L. muta) softly twitch their heads in my direction when their enclosures were approached and, after I opened the doors, effortlessly snag dead rat pups I tossed to them off long forceps in mid-air. However, like a keyed up batter facing a set pose, these snakes knew the pitch was imminent so these aerial pickups, while quick and beautifully executed, were hardly remarkable.\n\nThat, mae, is a hot snake that can strike both fast and accurately. Pray you never meet it when you’re wearing short pants and flip-flops on a dark and stormy night while on summer vacay in Costa Rica.\n\nOn the flip side of the realities of close association with these animals: I lived at an 800 acre/320 ha mostly forested site on the Caribbean coast of Guatemala in the Department of Izabal for about 18 months during the mid 1970s in an area that harbored fairly high numbers of Bothrops asper. Despite the abundance of this species on the property and snakebite from several venomous species being a quite common occurrence in the region–which was dominated by swamps, ranches, secondary forest and banana plantations–we never had an accident involving farm staff there although we did lose some very valuable livestock to bites by pitvipers, presumably barbas.\n\nThe short video clip shown below, filmed by nature guide Fred Muller in eastern Guatemalan lowland rainforest in 2019 and linked from my Vimeo account, shows two distinctive physical characters and one behavioral trait that illustrate the origins of three Spanish common names for this snake in Central America. First, the very conspicuous “yellow beard” (barba amarilla) when spotlit; second, the very deliberate “spooling” (devanador) reaction into a defensive coil against a buttressed tree and; third, the distinctly velvet (terciopelo) dorsal aspect of the snake evident when fully coiled at the end. The video also shows how, after having been first encountered out in the open on the forest floor, this individual deliberately retreated to a spot between two buttress roots of a canopy tree to make its stand. Sit and wait predators of all kinds often show clear and intimate familiarity with both favored ambush spots and refuges on their home range. This particular snake is obviously alert and situationally aware throughout the clip but the absence of non-stop tongue flicking and tail drumming shows that it is not overly alarmed despite both the spotlight fully on it and close proximity to Fred and companions.\n\nClick to play.\n\nLike contemporary nature TV heroes who have met unpleasant ends while engaged in foolhardy behaviors for the camera or on their day off, previous generations also lost their share of reckless snake handlers and zoo keepers who were likewise wildlife media darlings of their era. See Murphy & Jacques (2006) for an excellent profile of two well known “herpetologists”* from the 1950s and 1960s who both resulted with unexpected and acute cases of death after seriously pressing their luck with hot snakes for decades.\n\nAmong reptile collectors, it has long been known that inexpert pinning of large, heavy bodied but thin-necked snakes like adult examples of the larger pitviper species shown here can result in death for the animal during the act or after the fact. Even when they do not suffer cervical vertebrae dislocations, it is always wildly stressful for these animals to be manipulated just to show off for companions or the camera. For us it’s just a casual thrill, but for them it’s very likely perceived as a life-threatening event and absolutely no fun at all. Although I am well aware and somewhat begrudgingly accept that reptiles and amphibia usually must be captured and posed to stage the “Dairy Queen” menu, “Vogue” cover, or “Indiana Jones” poster-style images sought by all, fieldworkers and photographers should exercise extreme caution when closely interacting with any venomous snake that has the size, personality, and toxicity to send you home in a casket à la Cal Academy of Sciences researcher Joseph Slowinski (Oliver/LA Times, 2001).\n\nJust as foolish and slow self-styled “Elephant Whisperers” and other incautious on-holiday Bwanas sometimes become the pink stuff between the toes of short-tempered African elephants or in the teeth of lions who didn’t read the script, reckless and slow amateur venomous snake fanciers sometimes find out just how incredibly painful, debilitating, expensive or lethal a seriously hot snakebite can be today.\n\nBetter lucky than smart, I always say.\n\nAfter working with well over a thousand dangerously venomous reptiles from around the world over a time frame spanning my early teens well into adulthood and having had at one time in the mid and late 1980s, one of the largest and most species diverse research collections of Neotropical pitvipers, coralsnakes and venomous lizards anywhere (Slavens 1987-1989; Wille, 1992), I was never bitten by a venomous reptile.\n\nFull disclosure, I once impaled my right index finger on a single extended fang of a young yellow eyelash palm-pitviper (Bothriechis nigroadspersus) while administering anti-parasitic medication via catheter. Fortunately, this accident produced no symptoms other than a brief bout of anxiety and rather free bleeding from the puncture site. I attribute my near perfect score over more than 20 years to having always believed facing these snakes required intense focus at all times, that they are best manipulated with instruments like aluminum hooks, softly-employed grabsticks, endoscopic forceps or clear plastic control tubes whenever feasible and NEVER left to roam free on the floor while you work around them. Luck certainly plays a huge role in terms of final score. Every single friend and acquaintance I have that has worked with hot snakes, some far more skilled than me, has experienced a moderate to severe bite, always while handling them. This includes some very famous and respected herpetologists, reptile dealers, zoo employees, venom lab workers and wildlife photographers as well as garden variety bozos who interact/ed with venomous reptiles. Unsurprisingly (to me, at least), despite all of us having spent a combined hundreds of thousands of man hours in the field searching for reptiles around the world, off the top of my head, no-one that I know personally has ever been bitten by an unrestrained wild front-fanged snake.\n\nProper safe handling of venomous reptiles on a regular basis is a technique that takes time to perfect and is often developed the hard way**. Certainly, I’ve had my share of very close calls both trying to capture wild snakes in nature and handling fast, flighty captives during medical evaluations or cage maintenance so, again, better lucky than smart.\n\nOne of the people who generally impressed me as a very careful venomous snake handler during the time I interacted with him is Alejandro Solorzano of San José, Costa Rica. When I first met Alejandro during the mid 1980s, he was an assistant researcher and lab technician in charge of extracting venom from live native snakes held at the Universidad de Costa Rica’s facility in Coronado that produced antivenin for regional crotaline and coral snakes. At that time, during any given active month he probably manipulated more dangerously venomous snakes with his bare hands than most major zoo reptile keepers do in a decade.\n\nWhile we were friends, he had his first and hopefully last (?) envenomation involving a medium-sized Bothrops asper that, while thrashing about while being milked, squirmed partially free from his grip then stabbed him deep in a finger before he could get it free from his hands. Probably because the fang was bathed with fresh venom along its entire length this was, for all intents and purposes, probably equivalent to a moderate bite by a young snake. Despite being in excellent physical condition and having freshly prepared, refrigerated polyvalent antivenin at hand, during the relatively short interlude between the envenomation and emergency medical care counteracting its effect, he described the pain as being both almost unbearable and physically devastating. Notwithstanding his best efforts to tough it out in front of both his doctors and his father, who arrived on the scene shortly following notification his son had been bitten, Alejandro told me that tears of indescribable pain streamed down his face constantly for more than half an hour.\n\nFar from “Familiarity breeds contempt”, in my opinion close daily interaction with venomous snakes should inspire ever increased caution and respect for both their capacity to inflict a serious or fatal injury and the growing odds against you avoiding a costly slipup as time goes by.\n\nAs a professional venomous snake handler, the other extreme was Douglas March. March was a U.S. amateur reptile collector that embarked New Jersey for northern Central America at the beginning of the 1920s. His name emerges frequently in early 20th century Central American herpetological accounts, largely due to his connections with friends Raymond Ditmars of the Bronx Zoo and Dr. Thomas Barbour of Harvard University. Both well-respected scientists championed his management of the Serpentarium and venom extraction facility run by United Fruit’s Tela Railroad Company and Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology at Lancetilla, Honduras. Douglas March was by all accounts more a thrill-seeker and foolhardy adventurer than serious herpetologist, but he certainly did enjoy interacting with hot snakes. Ditmars, hardly a shrinking violet when it came to handling venomous reptiles, was reportedly a bit shaken after seeing him at work:\n\n“The Tela serpentarium’s young manager regularly descended by ladder into his serpent pit to collect venom from the dreaded barba amarilla vipers, a duty he relished. Clad in high leggings, the fearless Pennsylvanian would descend into the pits among a hundred or more venomous serpents, brazenly free handling them to extract their venom. A recent accident with a barba amarilla, leaving March partially blind until serum could be administered, failed to temper his reckless behaviour.” (Eatherley, 2015).\n\nSome of March’s more noteworthy claims have not stood the test of time, to say the least. In a short paper drawn from field notes and published in 1928, March wrote that the barba amarilla’s reputation was “somewhat exaggerated”. He moved to the Canal Zone in Panamá in 1933, apparently assumed the title “Doctor” and started his own serpentarium in what is now the Casco Viejo in Panamá City. It is reported that he was bitten 17 times by venomous New World snakes prior to his final accident. He misjudged the lethality of his subject matter on one too many occasions and ultimately died in 1939 at age 52 from a Bothrops asper bite in Panamá.\n\nYet another Gringo who had to find out the hard way.\n\nA warning note on the two open mouth Bothrops asper photos shown up top. It can be tricky to restrain some species of slender, long-fanged vipers with a three-fingered hold on the head in a natural setting if they are thrashing around and constant attention is not paid to correct finger placement while proper pressure maintained throughout. Plenty of very experienced reptile handlers around the world have been finger stabbed and envenomated by frightened or enraged vipers doing just this. While the photographs shown are, in my opinion, well composed and of great visual impact, it would be incredibly foolhardy for almost anyone to attempt to duplicate them - so please don’t.\n\nAdditional Disclaimer: After having interacted for decades on a personal basis with research taxonomists, museum herpetologists, zookeepers, venom lab workers, field biologists, and private collectors who kept captive venomous snakes in their homes and places of employment, and after seeing how some handled and cared for their animals, I am now firmly opposed to unregulated private ownership of venomous snakes as “pets”. These animals are all potential “widow-makers” in the truest sense. I particularly dislike the notion that hard-to-handle, extremely toxic large elapids and exotic crotalines are legally available for purchase by almost any halfwit in some areas. In the U.S. and the EU, one would think that the potentially catastrophic legal liability alone would curb people’s appetites to own them, but no. If one escapes and kills a neighbor’s child, the guilty collector will likely be both emotionally and financially bankrupted for life. Indeed, in today’s crazed media environment and the prosecutorial zeal it whips up, they may even end up in jail for a prolonged stint for criminal negligence.\n\nThis article in no way promotes nor endorses private ownership nor free-handling of venomous snakes anywhere in the world.\n\nReferences Cited\n\nAlmeida-Santos, S.
