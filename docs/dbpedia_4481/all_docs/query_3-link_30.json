        "text": "6 Ways to Prevent High Employee Attrition Rates\n\nThere are many ways that organizations can prevent high employee attrition rates. Below are a few recommendations:\n\nStart Engagement Early\n\nOne of the most attrition-prone times of the employee lifecycle is pre-boarding. A new hire may accept an offer just to not show up on their first day. This “first-day ghosting” is largely caused by a lack of engagement between offer acceptance and the first day during the downtime. Organizations can avoid this early-stage employee attrition by regular communication between the offer and the first day, including manager and team introductions, a virtual office tour, first-day information, and equipment updates.\n\nSet realistic expectations\n\nOne of the most common causes of attrition is due to employees misunderstanding their job expectations. Avoid post-hire shock and ensure that all new hires are given clear instructions on their day-to-day responsibilities and job functions.\n\nOffer support and show appreciation\n\nA company’s culture can either foster a supportive environment, or it can lead to employees feeling stressed and undervalued. By expressing frequent shows of gratitude, you can significantly reduce employee turnover. Consider offering rewards for excellent performance. When employees feel happy, safe, and motivated in the workplace, engagement increases. Encourage and motivate your employees to give and receive feedback; how that information is received and acted upon can be a predictor of attrition.\n\nTrain employees with effective tools\n\nA lack of proper training and resources to support employee growth and development is a high contributor to employee attrition. Empower your teams to obtain the skills they need to succeed by utilizing modern platforms that enable microlearning and gamification.\n\nCommunicate well and often\n\nCommunication is key to sustaining employee engagement. After the initial onboarding process is over, employees can feel out of the loop and isolated, especially those working in remote environments. A Work Institute study shows that nearly 40% of employees who quit do so in the first year, but in some sectors like call centers this can be significantly higher. Ensure your organization’s goals and any company updates are frequently shared with the entire team. Open up various forms of communication to ensure everyone can be heard.\n\nCompensate fairly and recognize high performers\n\nIt’s no surprise that many employees jump ship when a better opportunity comes their way. In today’s competitive landscape, you must regularly evaluate your employees’ salaries to ensure they meet market standards. Ensure high-performing team members are rewarded, both with compensation and recognition by their leaders.\n\nSee a Preview of Centrical\n\nLooking to Get Ahead of Employee Attrition in Your Organization?\n\nAttrition is costly because it takes time and resources to redistribute work and find and train new talent.
