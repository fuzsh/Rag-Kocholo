        "text": "At the University of North Georgia, we deeply value and uphold the cherished right of every American to freely express themselves. It is a hallmark of our history, our tradition, and permeates our culture. As a distinguished Senior Military College, with a legacy spanning over 150 years, we take great pride in our role of cultivating leaders who tirelessly defend these fundamental freedoms for all citizens. The legacy of our graduates in this regard is second to none.\n\nAs campus leaders, our primary responsibility is to cultivate an academic environment that ensures this exchange of ideas and the safety of our community. Across all five campuses, we are committed to fostering a welcoming atmosphere where individuals feel empowered to freely express themselves and engage in exploration and learning. However, it is essential that these rights are exercised in a manner that upholds our academic mission, preserves the safety of all, and is in accordance with our institutional policies, without unlawful behavior. This means breaking the law, harassment, intimidation, trespassing, violence, and other criminal acts will not be tolerated at the University of North Georgia.\n\nTogether, let us uphold the principles of respect, understanding, and civility as we equip our students to walk toward their purpose.\n\nBold Forward!"
