        "text": "If you have string fields in your data that contain multiple distinct pieces of information (for example, the first and last name of a customer) you may be able to split the values into separate fields.\n\nYou can use split options in Tableau Desktop to separate the values based on a separator (delimiter)Â or a repeated pattern of values present in each row. In the example of Customer Name, the common separator is a space (\" \") between first and last name.\n\nFind the Split option\n\nTableau Desktopâbut not web editing in the browserâhas a menu option for automatic or custom splits. These are based on the SPLIT string function, which can also be used manually in a calculation for complete control over the split.\n\nNot all data sources support SPLIT. You can tell if your data supports the SPLIT function by checking for the Split and Custom Split menu options:\n\nOn the Data Source page, check the menu for Split and Custom Split.\n\nFrom the Data pane on a sheet, check the menu for Transform > Split and Custom Split.\n\nSplit on the web\n\nWeb authoring doesn't support splitting from a menu. To split data while working in the browser, you can manually create a SPLITÂ calculation. See Alternatives to splitting from the menu.\n\nSplit fields\n\nA string field can be split automatically based on a common separator that Tableau detects in the field. You can also manually define the split\n\nDepending on the connection type, a split can automatically separate a field's values in up to ten new fields.\n\nSplit a field automatically\n\nOn the Data Source page, in the grid, click the drop-down arrow next to the field name, then select Split.\n\nIn the Data pane, right-click the field you want to split, and then select Transform > Split.\n\nThe results of the split are standard calculated fields that can be edited or deleted like any other calculated field. The data type of the new fields generated by the split can vary depending on the pattern combination that Tableau detects.\n\nSplit a field with custom split\n\nUse the custom split option for more control over the split. You can specify the separator and choose to split the values at the first N occurrences of the separator, the last N occurrences, or at all occurrences.\n\nOn the Data Source page, in the grid, click the drop-down arrow next to the field name. Select Custom Split.\n\nFrom the Data pane, in the Data pane, right-click the field you want to split, and then select Transform > Custom Split.\n\nThe new fields generated by the custom split always result in a string data type.\n\nNote: In some cases, if the automatic split takes too long to generate new fields or Tableau can't find a common separator, the custom split dialog box displays.\n\nCustom split is useful when the number of separators varies from value to value. Automatic split can't be used in these cases.\n\nFor example, suppose a field Employee Info has the following values:\n\njsmith| accounting | north\n\ndnguyen | humanresources\n\nlscott | recruiting| west\n\nkarnold |recruiting |west\n\nThe custom split could be configured to split on the pipe character (\"|\") and split off all columns. For the value without a region, the third result field will be null for that row.\n\nAlternatives to splitting from the menu\n\nSplit manually using the SPLITÂ function\n\nThe SPLITÂ function works similarly to a custom split, but only one result field is returned per calculation. You define the separator and specify which value to return by providing a token number.\n\nFor example, to split Customer Name into First Name and Last Name, create two calculated fields:\n\nFirst Name:Â SPLIT([Customer Name], \" \", 1)\n\nLast Name:Â SPLIT([Customer Name], \" \", 2)\n\nThe Employee Info example (such as \"jsmith| accounting | north\")Â would use three calculated fields:\n\nUsername:Â SPLIT([Employee Info], |, 1)\n\nDepartment:Â SPLIT([Employee Info], |, 2)\n\nRegion:Â SPLIT([Employee Info], |, 3)\n\nFor more information, see the SPLIT function.\n\nSplit manually using LEFTÂ and RIGHT functions\n\nIf your use case is more to extract a specific part of a string than to split it based on a separator, you can use the LEFTÂ and RIGHTÂ functions. These return only a portion of the string based on a specified number of characters.\n\nFor example, if the value of a row is IGW8892:\n\nCalculation Result RIGHT([Value], 4) 8892 LEFT([Value], 4) IGW8 LEFT(RIGHT([Value], 2) , 1) 9\n\nFor more information, see LEFT andÂ RIGHTÂ in String Functions.\n\nUse regular expressions for fields contain mixed separators\n\nFields canât be split automatically if the separator types are different. For example, suppose a field includes the following values:\n\nsmith.accounting\n\ndnguyen-humanresources\n\nlscott_recruiting\n\nkarnold_recruiting\n\nIn cases like this, consider using regular expressions to extract the desired information. For more information, see Additional Functions.\n\nWorking with splits and custom splits\n\nThings to keep in mind when working with splits and custom splits.\n\nNew fields canât be used as keys to join tables, but can be used to blend data sources.\n\nNew fields canât be used in a pivot.\n\nSplit and custom split options arenât supported for sets, groups, parameters, and bins.\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server only allows up to four split fields.\n\nTo generate more than ten new fields, consider splitting multiple times. You can use split again on a field from the first split that still includes multiple pieces of information.\n\nTroubleshooting splits and custom splits\n\nKnown issues you might experience when using splits and custom splits:\n\nSplit and custom split options missing for a supported data source type: Split and custom split options are available only for fields that are a string data type.\n\nNull values: After creating a split or a custom split, new fields might contain null values or no values at all. Null values or empty cells happen when there are no values for the expected new fields.\n\nData has been removed: Tableau might use portions of the fieldâs values as a separator. If a portion of a field's value is used as a separator, those values no longer appear in the new fields.\n\nFor example:\n\nOriginal value Split field values Zip-98102 98102 Zip-98109 98109 Zip-98119 98199 Zip-98195 98195\n\nThe split doesn't create a separate field for \"Zip-\" because that entire string is used as the separator."
