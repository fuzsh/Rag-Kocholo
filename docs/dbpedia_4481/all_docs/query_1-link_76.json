In most cases, a user is an individual working at the company, but can also be a vendor, partner, or customer.\n\nFor a user to have access to NetSuite, their records must contain an email address (used as their user ID) along with a password. User accounts need to be set up in the NetSuite system and can be granted access by the NetSuite administrator ‒ they can send an access notification email with a link to create a user profile.\n\nEach user is assigned a specific role within NetSuite. Based on the user’s role(s), permissions will be granted and define what they can view and modify in the system.\n\nWhat is a NetSuite Role?\n\nA role is a configuration assigned to a user, which defines what an individual can see and do in the NetSuite system. In other words, a user's role is restricted by the permissions associated with that role. Depending on the role(s) assigned, a user can get access to different data and perform various actions within the system.\n\nEvery role is tied to a center, which comes in the form of a unique interface that is linked to that specific role. Based on the role, the user will have access to the interface that best meets the business needs of their functional area.\n\nIt’s important to note that a user may be assigned multiple roles. For example, a user may be assigned the role of accountant and payroll manager.\n\nWhat are NetSuite Permissions?\n\nPermissions are provided by NetSuite and determine what data and interface users have access to. Permissions are tied to roles, which are assigned to users. Depending on the role(s) a user is assigned to, they’ll have access to certain permissions tied to their role(s).\n\nWhat are NetSuite Restrictions?\n\nRestrictions are tied to a user’s role(s) and limit the use of permissions so that a user can only see and modify data that relates to their department, subsidiary, or class. For example, a manager may be assigned permissions that allow them to access employee records, but be restricted to only seeing data relating to employees in their team.\n\nLearn more about the different types of restrictions here.\n\nWhat are NetSuite Interfaces?\n\nThe interface is unique to the user and their role(s). Depending on the role, a user might see different dashboards, have access to a different navigation, or other changes.\n\nTypes of Roles in NetSuite\n\nThere are two types of roles in NetSuite:\n\nStandard Roles\n\nStandard roles come with predefined permissions offered by NetSuite. For the most part, these roles are linked to standard employee positions like Accountant, A/P Clerk, Sales Rep, etc. These roles are available to Vendors, Partners, and Customers, depending on if they have access to NetSuite.\n\nCustom Roles\n\nCustom roles give you the ability to create and modify roles with any permissions you choose. In practice, it is normally easier to start with a standard role and then customize it to better meet your needs.\n\nWhat are Full Access Users?\n\nA full access user license allows you to assign roles, from any varying degree of small to large, and give permissions within the NetSuite instance. This license is reserved for staff that will be performing more in-depth tasks in NetSuite, from saved searches to reporting, working within the CRM, and more.\n\nWhat are Employee Access Users?\n\nAn employee access user does not require a role within your NetSuite instance, and their access is limited to time and expenses. This means that they can access the system to enter and track their time or projects, but will not have access to the CRM, in-depth ERP functionalities, or be able to affect changes within your instance.\n\nWhat is a NetSuite Administrator?\n\nThe NetSuite administrator is responsible for configuring and maintaining NetSuite for your business. A NetSuite administrator will collaborate with team members across all business functions and external development teams to perform customizations, resolve user issues as well as define processes within NetSuite. This role will also be responsible for system cleanup and establishing best practices across the NetSuite environment to achieve business goals.\n\nWhat is a NetSuite Developer?\n\nDevelopers can create customized vertical and industry-specific applications tailored to your customers through NetSuite ERP / Accounting / CRM software. A NetSuite partner, like GURUS Solutions, can act as your NetSuite solution by scripting and creating tools to ensure your cloud solution fits your organization like a glove. Learn more about our Customization & Development services.\n\nDoes NetSuite provide security to restrict viewing of reports and screens based on the user?\n\nYes. NetSuite provides role and permission-based security that allows administrators to control visibility, actions, and/or data.\n\nDoes NetSuite offer role-based views or dashboards?\n\nYes. NetSuite allows users to customize their dashboards based on the user's roles and permissions. You can learn more about customizing dashboards here.\n\nWhat are the Different NetSuite User Types (and tools offered)?\n\nThe 6 standard user types for NetSuite are: Business Analyst, Developer, Administrator, CIO, Partner, and Everyday User. Your ERP comes with a designed set of configurations for each user that you can customize for your needs. For a breakdown of the User Types and to find out what you can customize in NetSuite, watch this short video.\n\nCompanies That Use NetSuite\n\nCompanies of various sizes use NetSuite. In general, companies that have more than 50 employees making over $1M in annual revenue would be a NetSuite customer. This can vary from company to company, as well as the industry the company is in.\n\nSome companies that use NetSuite include:"
