        "text": "Any business would require ERP software to optimize organizational operations. Of course, there is always a requirement of ‘much more’ from the tool if we start looking at the various options. NetSuite and Epicor fall under the same category of best offerings and have delectable additional features that shall be useful to run your business with minimal manual effort.\n\nOne of the main reasons NetSuite and Epicor are preferred is because of the large volumes of data they can handle. Especially for mid-sized and large corporations, software like NetSuite becomes inevitable. It not only saves a lot of time in doing unnecessary tasks but also has the capacity to give useful reports on a real-time basis. Moreover, Epicor is immensely popular as NetSuite and has specific solutions to select industry types that you may not find in Oracle NetSuite. This article shall give a piece of detailed information about the differences, similarities and also an in-depth comparison of both the tools. Upon reading this you will definitely have an idea of choosing either of the two for your organization. In fact, any ERP software must suit your company’s needs too.\n\nNetSuite and Epicor – History You Must Know!!!\n\nNetSuite was founded in 1998. When Evan Goldberg started NetSuite, it was a simple web-based account management software. However, in a quick time, a massive transformation of the tool happened. NetSuite was developed into a spectacular ERP software that also handles\n\nFinancial Planning and Management\n\nOmni Channel Commerce\n\nThe best part of the software is, it was and is a cloud-based tool. That means to say, you can log in to the tool anytime and from anywhere without any hassle.\n\nInterestingly, Oracle acquired NetSuite for a whopping $9.3 Billion in 2016. From then on, it is called Oracle NetSuite. In fact, the financial management aspects took pace after this merger. Further, NetSuite was earlier targeting the small, medium and large corporations. However, it was preferred majorly by the larger ones as the need for the software is too much for such mid and small-sized companies. The underlying reason is, even if they buy the product, many features in the tool may be left unused but still end up paying for the services. It was considered expensive too. Once Oracle took over NetSuite, the entire scene changed. They reworked the price package and started offering what the customer requires and not those features that are unnecessary for them. Of course, the subscription pattern of business worked wonders for both parties.\n\nNetSuite now has a wide range of customers connected to over 200 countries. Thanks to multi-channel support and multi-currency transaction support. Oracle NetSuite has over 16000 customers worldwide. No doubt, they are pioneers in cloud-based solutions.\n\nOn the other hand, Epicor has a deep history in business software creation and maintenance. Epicor Software Corporation was started in 1972. The company was based out of Austin, Texas. The software products developed then were under the name Triad Systems Corporation. In fact, before the company could be named Epicor, it had one more name as well. It was called Activant Solutions Inc.\n\nThe growth of the company happened through mergers. The major task force was to create business software solutions that shall help the clients to manage and maintain accounts. The financial product in the form of accounting solutions was manufactured and distributed for LAN based environments earlier.\n\nOnce DataWorks acquired the company, it was named Epicor Software Corporation. The company is owned by KKR, a PE firm that had bought it for $3.3 Billion in 2016. Epicor provides the following services now\n\nEnterprise Resource Planning\n\nCustomer Relationship Management\n\nSupply Chain Management\n\nHuman Capital Management\n\nAs software to companies to automate their business processes. They have two different models to deploy the software. One is the cloud-based solution as a SaaS and the other is the on-premise deployment of the product.\n\nThey are on par with NetSuite in terms of their customer count. They have around 20000 customers in 150 different countries of the world. They have more than 15 different products developed mainly for\n\nRetail Industries\n\nManufacturing Industries\n\nProduction Industries\n\nEpicor also caters to several other niches and helps organizations of different sizes to flourish using their products.

It not only helps in gaining the business but also helps in staffing. One can easily streamline the process of product delivery right from the scratch. You can in fact look into minute details of every employee who is connected to a particular project.\n\nNetSuite and Epicor – Functional Comparison\n\nDelivery Options and Ease of Integration\n\nAs with NetSuite, we are aware that it offers cloud-based SaaS and it runs through a single code base. Not many of us are aware of the fact that this feature helps in smoother integrations and greater reliability. The third-party integrations through cloud-based solutions are made pretty easy in NetSuite’s case. The tool offers greater flexibility and remarkable security when it comes to sensitive data as well.\n\nOn the other hand, Epicor is by far the largest platform for an on-premise solution. That means to say, if you are looking for an on-premise ERP, then NetSuite cannot be your choice. Whereas, the cloud-based functionality is recently developed and it has few issues when it comes to implementation and execution as well. You might require multiple hosting partners to do so.\n\nSo, if it is going to be a Cloud-based solution, then it must be NetSuite.\n\nSimilarly, the ease of integration with third-party software is remarkable in both cases. But, the third-party tool must be cloud-based and on premise-based in either of the cases. Further, NetSuite Alliance Partner shall notify you that any third party software that is an on-premise solution can work well with NetSuite and that’s the truth too.\n\nCost Factor\n\nThe Cloud-based solutions offered by NetSuite and Epicor do not seem to have any difference in the subscription cost. As said earlier, with the errors still available in the software, you may find NetSuite far better for its pricing options.\n\nAt the same time, it is not only about the subscription but also about longer run usage and costs involved in it. The maintenance, upgrades and licensing pattern adds further cost to NetSuite while Epicor works out less expensive.\n\nFor example, NetSuite requires named user access, while Epicor’s login credentials can be shared across time zones, leaving the client to buy only one license instead of two in the case of NetSuite.\n\nScalability Factor\n\nThe cloud customization process in NetSuite is quite limited compared to Epicor. As such, NetSuite is suitable for small and mid-sized companies that have minimal complexity in the functions. On the other hand, Epicor deals with large corporations with more complex functionalities. Further, the scalability of Epicor is boundless.\n\nLanguage Support\n\nBoth the tools are versatile when it comes to the number of languages it supports. While NetSuite supports 27 global languages, Epicor is the best in this aspect. It maintains robust operational efficiency in terms of any business application. That means to say, the applications running in one language in a different country will have different language support depending on the location. It helps keep the data intact and the information’s readability is also feasible.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nNetSuite and Epicor fall under the same bracket of support features. If one offers 24/7 tech support over the phone, the other offers the same. Both offer live as well as an online training facility for the users to learn clinical insights about the tool.\n\nSuiteAnswers helps with all the relevant and required information while virtual education is available with Epicor. One slight difference is, Epicor offers instructor-led training as well.\n\nSecurity and Reliability\n\nBoth the tools are on par when it comes to data security. Be it the on-premise or the cloud-based solution of Epicor, they are excellent. NetSuite on the other hand develops every module keeping security factors in mind. You can get to see it as the user credentials are also based on the levels and not everyone can view everything.\n\nCan We Conclude?\n\nThe dissection of features in each of the tools helps us understand many things. If you watch them closely, the quality management factor in both the tools is just the same. While the purchase management capacity of Epicor eclipses NetSuite conveniently. At the same time, there is enough opportunity for both to develop product technical support.\n\nIt all bottles down to what type of tool you are looking at. Is it on-premise or cloud-based? Epicor is an excellent on-premise software while NetSuite is the cloud giant in ERP.\n\nExperts also suggest that if you are a manufacturing company, the inventory system and purchase management capacity of Epicor suits your business while NetSuite is more applicable to service based industries.\n\nBoth the tools help you achieve the goals effectively. With multi-language and multi-currency support, the financials are intact. You can look at the growth of your company on a real time basis too.\n\nRelated Post:\n\n1.
