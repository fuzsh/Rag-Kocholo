There are six options:\n\nAgreement\n\nSalary\n\nFixed hourly rate\n\nBase rate with conditions applied\n\nBase rate with location overrides\n\nBase rate with only job overrides\n\nIf employees are paid the same rate regardless of how many hours they work, then choosing a fixed hourly rate means that overtime and any other wage conditions will not apply to the employee."
