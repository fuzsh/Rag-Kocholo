        "text": "Cost is inevitably an important factor in your ERP decision. While it would be nice to see a clear monthly fee for NetSuite software, you won’t find it online.\n\nHere’s why…\n\nNetSuite is a scalable platform.\n\nA $5 million business can implement a preconfigured NetSuite solution with accounting, sales and basic inventory management. A $50 million company can implement a customized NetSuite solution with advanced financial and inventory management, plus ecommerce.\n\nSetting the implementation costs aside, even the monthly subscription fee would differ for these two companies as they use different modules.\n\nWhile we can’t give you a crystal-clear number here, we’ll explain how the NetSuite pricing model works and answer the most common pricing questions.\n\nPrefer to skip the details? Contact our team directly and we’ll create a personalized estimate.\n\nHow much does NetSuite ERP cost?\n\nThe price of your NetSuite subscription will vary based on your company size, number of users and the modules you purchase. A NetSuite implementation project can range from under $30,000 to $250,000+ depending on the scope and complexity of your requirements.\n\nHere are the factors that impact your price:\n\nNetSuite edition (determined by company size)\n\nNetSuite service tier (determined by transaction volume)\n\nNumber and type of user licenses\n\nAdvanced NetSuite modules\n\nImplementation approach and scope\n\nCustomizations and integrations\n\nPart 1: NetSuite subscription cost\n\nNetSuite edition cost\n\nThe NetSuite edition you need is largely determined by the size of your company and how many legal entities you need. An important note – all editions are built on the same underlying code base, so you can easily move to the next edition as your company grows.\n\nNetSuite Starter Edition: Small companies with up to 10 users and one legal entity are a great fit for NetSuite Starter. The SuiteSuccess Starter implementation uses preconfigured solutions based on your industry to reduce implementation time and cost.\n\nNetSuite Standard Edition: Companies that have up to 30 users and/or more than one legal entity will use NetSuite Standard edition. If you need to consolidate financial reports across multiple currencies, you’ll need Standard edition at a minimum.\n\nNetSuite Premium Edition: Large companies with 1,000+ users and/or multiple legal entities are the best fit for NetSuite Premium edition.\n\nWhat’s included in each NetSuite edition?\n\nEach edition comes with standard ERP and CRM functionality. For capabilities beyond what’s listed here, you’ll move to advanced NetSuite modules (more on that later).\n\nNetSuite ERP\n\nGeneral Ledger\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nAccounts Payable\n\nPayment Methods – Credit Cards, ACH, EFT\n\nBank Management & Reconciliations\n\nMulti-currency & Multi-language\n\nItem & Basic Inventory Management\n\nBasic Project Management\n\nOrder Management\n\nPurchasing\n\nTime & Expense Management\n\nNetSuite CRM\n\nMarketing Automation\n\nSales Force Automation\n\nCase Management\n\nPartner Relationship Management\n\nNetSuite service tiers\n\nAll NetSuite systems use the SuiteCloud Infrastructure to provide best-in-class availability, leading security controls and data redundancy. Since companies of different sizes will have varying resource requirements, NetSuite service tiers match computing resources to what’s required for each business. Tiers are determined by:\n\nMax number of users\n\nFile storage\n\nMonthly transaction lines\n\nYour NetSuite Solution Provider can help you determine which NetSuite service tier you need: Standard, Premium, Enterprise or Ultimate.\n\nNetSuite user license cost\n\nNetSuite uses a named user approach, which means you need one license for each user. Pricing will depend on the modules you use and how many of each license type you need.\n\nA full-user license is best for users who perform transactions on a day-to-day basis. This would include your accounting team, sales, purchasing and others.\n\nA self-service user license is best for users who perform limited tasks, like entering time and expenses.\n\nWe advise against sharing licenses to reduce costs. Sharing licenses limits your ability to audit changes made in the system and reduces productivity as only one employee can be logged into the system at a time. Not to mention that sharing passwords goes against ERP security best practices.\n\nDoes NetSuite have read-only access?\n\nNo, you can’t provide read-only access to users. However, for employees who need to view reports, you can schedule email alerts with attached reports in Excel, Word or PDF.\n\nNetSuite module cost\n\nIf you need functionality beyond the core ERP and CRM, you can choose from NetSuite advanced modules. While you can choose modules à la carte, it’s typically more economical to purchase a suite of modules based on your industry.\n\nHere are just a few of the advanced modules to give you a sense of what’s available – check out our NetSuite modules guide for the full list.\n\nNetSuite AP Automation\n\nNetSuite Planning and Budgeting\n\nNetSuite CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote)\n\nNetSuite Advanced Inventory Management\n\nNetSuite WMS (Warehouse Management System)\n\nNetSuite Demand Planning\n\nNetSuite Advanced Manufacturing\n\nSuiteCommerce (B2B and B2C ecommerce)\n\nNetSuite Field Service Management\n\n4 tips to get the best price on NetSuite licensing\n\n1. Buy from a NetSuite Solution Provider\n\nThe number one way to optimize your NetSuite software price is to purchase through a NetSuite Solution Provider. With access to the same pricing as the NetSuite direct team, we use our inside knowledge to negotiate the best price for you.\n\n2. Negotiate contract terms and conditions\n\nLike all subscription software, there’s a chance your NetSuite price will increase at renewal time. There are a couple of ways you can protect against significant increases.\n\nChoose a longer subscription term. NetSuite typically works on an annual subscription, but you can sign on for a longer term (up to five years) and guarantee that price for the duration of your contract. The longer your term, the more money you’ll save.\n\nNegotiate maximum annual increases. If you get a discount on licenses for your initial term, that discount may not apply when you renew. Negotiating a maximum annual increase can prevent surprises down the road.\n\nWhen it comes to ERP software, you’re in it for the long run, so it makes sense to secure more predictable pricing.\n\n3. License NetSuite as you go\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes we see in ERP projects is trying to ‘boil the ocean’ and implement every feature on the wish list at once. It’s not practical.\n\nThe same applies from a licensing perspective – buying modules you think you’ll need three years from now may not be the most cost-effective option. We recommend working closely with your NetSuite Solution Provider to determine which modules you should buy now and which should wait until later.\n\n4. Consider NetSuite SuiteSuccess Starter if you’re a small business\n\nThe SuiteSuccess approach gives you access to the ERP features you need as a small business while keeping your implementation costs low. Keep in mind that this isn’t the best option if you need customizations or integrations right away; but if you can delay that until a later phase, SuiteSuccess Starter is a great option to get you up and running.\n\nPart 2: NetSuite implementation costs\n\nThere are two ways that NetSuite is implemented – which one you choose will depend on the size and complexity of your company.\n\nOption 1: SuiteSuccess implementation for small businesses\n\nIf your company is price-sensitive and you have relatively simple processes, a SuiteSuccess implementation could be a good fit. It’s a preconfigured solution that uses industry best practices to get you live with NetSuite quickly.\n\nThe fixed-price implementation cost appeals to small businesses that want the benefits of ERP but don’t have the budget for a traditional ERP project. It’s a great way to get started with ERP and gradually increase your system use over time.\n\nOption 2: Traditional NetSuite implementation for mid-sized businesses\n\nIf your business is in the mid-sized range (typically over $10 million in revenue), a traditional NetSuite implementation is likely the better bet. At this size, your processes are complex enough that you need more than a preconfigured ERP solution.\n\nThe cost of an implementation can vary because the price is driven by your business needs. Your NetSuite Solution Provider will start with a deep analysis of your processes to understand which processes will carry over to NetSuite and identify any gaps in your workflows. Then, they’ll design your solution, including any customizations or integrations, before configuring the system and migrating data.\n\nBigger, more complex businesses can count on a higher implementation cost.\n\nNetSuite customization cost\n\nThere are several options for customizing your NetSuite solution.\n\nCustom reports are typically created when reporting requires calculations.\n\nSuiteFlow is a point-and-click tool that non-technical users can use to customize workflows.\n\nSuiteScript is built on JavaScript and requires experienced software developer knowledge to create business logic and data objects.\n\nMost mid-sized companies customize their NetSuite solution in some way – the price of those customizations will be driven by the scope.\n\nWe recommend using standard functionality wherever possible and only customizing where truly necessary. As your NetSuite Solution Provider, we help you determine where it makes sense to customize based on what you’re trying to achieve.\n\nNetSuite integration cost\n\nWhile NetSuite has a ton of functionality, you may need to integrate with other systems that handle specific business processes. NetSuite has the flexibility to accommodate a variety of integrations. Here again, the cost of an integration will range based on your requirements.\n\nSuiteTalk and APIs can be used to develop custom integrations. Few companies have the internal development resources to build these integrations, so it’s best to work with a qualified NetSuite Solution Provider.\n\nNetSuite Connectors allow NetSuite to ‘plug and play’ with other applications, without coding. There are options available – your NetSuite Solution Provider can recommend the best connector to fit your needs.\n\nPart 3: Optional NetSuite costs\n\nWe’ve covered the most important factors, but these final points can also impact your NetSuite total cost of ownership.\n\nPremium technical support\n\nNetSuite offers technical support for all editions at no additional charge. For 24/7 access to NetSuite Support, you can upgrade to NetSuite Premium Support for an additional fee, based on your software contract value.\n\nIf you work with a NetSuite Solution Provider, you’ll also have access to their team for support and optimization. They should be your first line of defence as they have a full understanding of your implementation and your business needs. Depending on what support you need, additional fees may apply.\n\nNetSuite Sandbox\n\nA NetSuite Sandbox account gives you an identical copy of your production environment where you can develop and test customizations without impacting your operational data. A Sandbox comes at an additional cost, based on a percentage of your annual subscription. It’s available in 6-month increments so you can turn it on and off as needed.\n\nCompanies with more complex customizations or integrations may want a Sandbox indefinitely. Others will use it leading up to go-live or when implementing new customizations, then turn it off. For simple activations with no customization, a Sandbox may not be necessary at all.\n\nYour NetSuite Solution Provider can help you determine if you need a Sandbox – and for how long – based on the specifics of your system.\n\nNetSuite Learning Cloud Support passes\n\nNetSuite Learning Cloud Support (LCS) is a continuing education platform for NetSuite users. There are two types of passes based on your training needs:\n\nThe Explorer Pass provides free access to beginner-level training courses for new users.\n\nThe Company Pass provides paid access to online learning, live events, reference materials and more. It’s available for a percentage of your annual subscription and is often negotiable.\n\nYou can also work with your NetSuite Solution Provider for tailored one-on-one training above and beyond what's included in your implementation project.\n\nYour next steps with NetSuite\n\nNetSuite is a powerful ERP solution with endless possibilities to streamline operations and improve efficiency. Understanding the cost relative to the value for your business is an important part of your ERP decision.\n\nAs your NetSuite Solution Provider, we’ll answer any questions and help you build a NetSuite solution that fits your business needs today, tomorrow and 10 years from now.\n\nNetSuite pricing FAQ\n\nCan you get better software pricing from NetSuite direct than from a NetSuite Solution Provider?\n\nNo. Solution Providers have access to the same pricing and discounts as the NetSuite direct team.\n\nIs NetSuite affordable?\n\nNetSuite can seem expensive if you’re coming off simple software like QuickBooks. But you’re paying for a platform that you can grow on for years to come. This makes it more affordable for mid-size and enterprise-level companies. For small, high-growth businesses, the SuiteSuccess Starter package is the most affordable way to get started with NetSuite.\n\nHow long is a NetSuite subscription?\n\nThe standard subscription term is one year, but you can choose longer terms to negotiate better pricing (up to five years).\n\nHow do you buy NetSuite?\n\nYou can buy NetSuite software directly from NetSuite or a NetSuite Solution Provider, like ProjectLine. A Solution Provider is preferred if you want to go beyond the SuiteSuccess methodology – either during your initial implementation or in the future.\n\nHow do you determine the NetSuite total cost of ownership?"
