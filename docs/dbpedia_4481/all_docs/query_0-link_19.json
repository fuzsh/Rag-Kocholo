        "text": "Download PDF of Article\n\nRoughly 84% of U.S. Fortune 500 companies have a peer mentoring program in place.1 This statistic is not surprising considering the beneﬁts that peer mentoring can bring to organizations, their employees, and ultimately, their customers.\n\nA recent article from Indeed states some of these beneﬁts2 include:\n\nStrengthening team bonds\n\nBoosting morale\n\nEnhancing engagement\n\nOptimizing employee potential\n\nSaving costs\n\nImproving communication\n\nCreating a comfortable work environment\n\nFacilitating knowledge transfer\n\nPeer mentoring is often more specialized than other forms of training. The transfer of knowledge often comes from the mentor’s own role-specific experiences. When implemented in our contact center environment, we’ve found that peer mentoring has a direct and indirect positive effect on the experience of our clients’ customers.*\n\nIMPROVING THE EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE\n\n“Clients do not come first. Employees come first. If you take care of your employees, they will take care of your clients.”\n\n– Richard Branson, Virgin\n\nThe link between employee satisfaction and a positive customer experience can best be explained by the service-profit chain theory. Harvard University-developed service-profit chain is a business model that illustrates the link between employee satisfaction, customer satisfaction and business success.\n\nA 2019 CNBC/SurveyMonkey study shows that 90% of employees who have a mentor are happy at work. Further, they are more likely to be satisfied with their job than those who don’t, regardless of their income level. The cost of peer mentoring is minimal, but it can make workers feel as if they’ve gotten a raise in terms of workplace happiness. 3\n\nHOW DOES MENTORING HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE?\n\nSkill development: Beyond sharpening the specific skills acquired in training, peer mentoring facilitates the development of critical soft skills such as communication, empathy and active listening – all vital skills for building successful relationships and collaborations, especially in contact centers.\n\nBolstering collaboration: The sharing of knowledge at the heart of peer mentor programs can foster a sense of support and camaraderie. When executed correctly, mentees find comfort in knowing that they have a trusted confidant who provides guidance and encouragement. An effective mentor serves as a reliable sounding board, offering a safe space for mentees to discuss their questions, concerns and goals.\n\nJob fulfillment: Peer mentoring programs don’t just have a positive effect on the mentees. Mentors also experience a sense of fulfillment by making a meaningful impact on someone else’s development and success. Moreover, mentors benefit from their role in this exchange by reinforcing their own knowledge and expertise through teaching and guiding others.4\n\nIncreasing employee retention: High employee retention rates can boost morale, improve corporate culture, improve the employee experience, reduce recruitment costs and enhance the customer experience.5\n\nWhen compared to those who don’t participate in mentorship programs,\n\nretention rates are significantly higher:\n\nMORLEY EXPERIENCE:\n\nMuch like the service-profit chain theory, we believe an exceptional customer experience begins with our associates. Morley’s leadership approach is based on the servant leadership mentality, which means we put our associates first and help them grow. Instead of managing struggling associates out, we manage them in.\n\nWhen an agent struggles to meet specific key performance metrics, we take a service-first approach. The peer mentoring program offers a high level of support and collaboration, for both mentee and mentor. Our program pairs high-performing agents with a desired behavior with agents performing low in the same behavior.\n\nFor mentees, successful mentoring can lead to better schedule options, increased autonomy, higher wages, leadership development, morale boosts, wage increases and career advancement. Successful mentees who have the desire to “pay it forward” have the option to go from mentee to mentor, thus perpetuating the cycle of servant leadership.\n\nImprovements in key contact center metrics supports peer mentoring as a contributor in delivering\n\nexceptional experiences.*\n\n\"I love & enjoy peer-to-peer mentoring. I think it’s less nerve-wracking without team leads and quality agents involved. I appreciate how it helps us to trade ideas on how to handle our calls as well\".\n\n– Summer, Morley Universal Phone Agent\n\n\"We both, mentee & mentor, learned how to improve metrics while helping customers. All sessions have been very positive & the mentee has been receptive to being coached in the sessions. As the mentor, I felt like I was helping them achieve better results for themselves and their customers, and it felt very rewarding to be able to help them be more successful\".\n\n– Christy, Morley Universal Phone Agent\n\nInsight #1: By having peer mentors, employees have a better workplace experience, which translates into a higher quality of customer service.\n\nUSING AI TO IMPROVE PEER MENTORING PROGRAMS\n\nPreviously, we’ve shared how using Voice of the Customer (VOC) and Automated Quality Management (AQM) provides objective customer data for real-time agent development. Both VOC and AQM provide the automated collection and analysis of CX intelligence with the purpose of enhancing the customer experience.\n\nUsing automated programs to measure the customer experience allows contact center leaders to:\n\nIdentify low score triggers in real time and offer swift resolutions.\n\nPair low performers within the desired behavior with high performing mentors within the selected desired behavior.\n\nMeasure the effectiveness of the peer mentoring program on the customer experience.\n\nMORLEY EXPERIENCE:\n\nUsing VOC and AQM programs, Morley quality teams monitor customer interactions and identify areas for agent growth and improvement. It enables leaders to promptly identify peer teams for mentoring and monitor performance improvement throughout the course of the peer mentoring process.\n\nAs a result of peer mentoring, Morley data has shown improved performance levels within desired targeted behaviors, including increased performance in other metrics such as CSAT, AQM and Assurance of Availability and Help scores.*\n\nInsight #2: Pairing peer mentoring programs with AI-provided customer data can have a dynamic, near immediate impact on the customer experience.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nPeer mentor programs offer a multitude of benefits to both mentees and mentors. From knowledge sharing and personal growth to support and networking opportunities, these programs have a transformative impact on individuals and organizations alike. By harnessing the power of peer-to-peer relationships, mentor programs create a nurturing and empowering environment that enhances professional development, increases employee longevity and fosters sustained increases in customer satisfaction.\n\nSources:\n\n1 Forbes: Does Mentoring Still Matter For Fortune 500 Companies?\n\n2 Indeed: What Is Peer-to-Peer Learning?
