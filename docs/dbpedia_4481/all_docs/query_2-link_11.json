Editions refer to the core platform and number of user licenses you purchase, while service tiers dictate the more quantitative aspects of NetSuite.\n\nNetSuite service tiers refer to the different levels of NetSuite available, making sure you only pay for what you need. Service tiers determine:\n\nHow many total NetSuite users (not licenses) you can have\n\nHow much data you can process\n\nThe amount of data storage you receive\n\nSuiteCloud Plus licenses available\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of the four different service tiers.\n\nService Tier\n\nUsers\n\nFile Storage (GB)\n\nMonthly Transaction Lines\n\nSandbox\n\nStandard\n\n100\n\n100\n\n200,000\n\nNo\n\nPremium\n\n1,000\n\n1,000\n\n2,000,000\n\nYes\n\nEnterprise\n\n2,000\n\n2,000\n\n10,000,000\n\nYes\n\nUltimate\n\n4,000\n\n4,000\n\n50,000,000\n\nYes\n\nSo, Which NetSuite Edition is Best?\n\nThe NetSuite Edition that's best for you depends on how many user licenses you need, the size of your company, and whether your business has more than one legal entity.\n\nWhile it might seem like a straightforward decision, there are a lot of things to consider when you're building the best NetSuite setup for your company.
