        "text": "For the 3rd Time, Genesis Consulting Partners, LLC Appears on the Inc. 5000, Ranking No. 2550 With Revenues Having Nearly Tripled Over the Past Three Years\n\nNEW YORK, August 17, 2021 – Inc. magazine today revealed that Genesis Consulting Partners, LLC is No. 2550 on its annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the nation’s fastest-growing private companies. Earning a place on this list places Genesis in the top 0.07% of growing companies in the United States. Founded in 2008, this is Genesis’ third time being featured on the Inc. 5000, having earned spots in 2013 as the fastest growing business in central Virginia, and again in 2014. The list represents a unique look at the most successful companies within the American economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent small businesses. Intuit, Zappos, Under Armour, Microsoft, Patagonia, and many other well-known names gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.\n\n“The past few years have been filled with so many complex challenges. With many of those challenges came enormous opportunities for Genesis to seize the moment, lean into change and adversity, and find the silver linings which have ultimately catapulted the organization forward. We’ve made huge strides towards our goal of creating an organization that is Value Driven and Performance Focused. This cultural mindset is what continues to promote Genesis as a trusted Digital Transformation partner and advisor in both the Public and Private sectors. When everyone from the back office to delivery is focused on continuous improvement, performance, and delivering value...That’s truly what allows a firm that has been around for over ten years to triple its size again over just a three-year period!”\n\nCameron Chaplin, Chief Financial Officer\n\nNot only have the companies on the 2021 Inc. 5000 been very competitive within their markets, but this year’s list also proved especially resilient and flexible given 2020’s unprecedented challenges. Among the 5,000, the average median three-year growth rate soared to 543 percent, and median revenue reached $11.1 million. Together, those companies added more than 610,000 jobs over the past three years.\n\nComplete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria, can be found at www.inc.com/inc5000. The top 500 companies are featured in the September issue of Inc., which will be available on newsstands on August 20.\n\n“The 2021 Inc. 5000 list feels like one of the most important rosters of companies ever compiled,” says Scott Omelianuk, editor-in-chief of Inc. “Building one of the fastest-growing companies in America in any year is a remarkable achievement. Building one in the crisis we’ve lived through is just plain amazing. This kind of accomplishment comes with hard work, smart pivots, great leadership, and the help of a whole lot of people.”\n\nAbout Genesis Consulting Partners\n\nGenesis Consulting is a SWaM certified small business headquartered in Richmond, VA, with other offices in Reston, VA, Washington, D.C., and most recently São Paulo Brazil, along with other various satellite operations around the globe.
