        "text": "Oracle NetSuite Analytics Warehouse\n\nWhat is NetSuite Analytics Data Warehouse?\n\nNetSuite Analytics Warehouse is the only out-of-the-box data warehouse and analytics platform prebuilt for Oracle NetSuite ERP. NetSuite Analytics Warehouse brings together multiple sources of data, including NetSuite data and other business systems data, to identify patterns and insights that drive growth. It leverages both the machine learning-powered analytical tool Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) and Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), which automatically tunes, scales and patches itself.\n\nMyers-Holum has implemented NetSuite Analytics Warehouse for many clients like Thread, highlighted in this video, who consider it important to their business. As the COO of Thread, Mitch Sanders has identified five ways that NetSuite Analytics Warehouse has helped their business. First, NetSuite Analytics Warehouse provides reliable data feeds, which was a problem with their previous data analytics solution. Second, it's easy for employees to use and understand, making it accessible for different teams. Third, it creates accountability and fosters a culture of using data across the organization. Fourth, it's customizable for their changing needs, and sales uses customized dashboards. Last, it creates deeper insights across all channels, highlighting deficiencies and enabling them to create plans to improve. The data from NetSuite Analytics Warehouse helps them to stay informed.\n\nNetSuite Analytics Warehouse provides access to all NetSuite ERP data that Myers-Holum integrates with our customers' third-party applications like Salesforce, Shopify and other custom content so that it is a single logical view with a common analytics interface - Oracle Analytics Cloud. This supports deep analytical insights across all our customers' business applications and data, in the form of KPIs, dashboards, published reports and interactive data visualizations.\n\nHow is NetSuite Analytics Warehouse implemented?\n\nAs the NetSuite Alliance Partner of the Year for North America and NetSuite Analytics Warehouse Spotlight Award winner, Myers-Holum can implement NetSuite Analytics Warehouse as part of your ERP product suite. NetSuite Analytics Warehouse offers the full set of capabilities of the Oracle Analytics Cloud with its robust features. This includes logical data modeling, joining data together from multiple sources and creating shareable ERP intelligence.
