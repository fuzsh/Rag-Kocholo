Advances in technologies, such as the internet of things and big data analytics, are systematically enabling the digital information world to see, understand and influence the physical operational world. When implemented properly, IT/OT convergence can merge business processes, insights and controls into a single uniform environment. Use this guide to learn more about IT/OT convergence, its benefits and challenges, plus industry examples, use cases and more.\n\nDefinition\n\ninformation technology (IT)\n\nBy\n\nKinza Yasar, Technical Writer\n\nWhat is information technology?\n\nInformation technology (IT) is the use of computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data. Typically, IT is used in the context of business operations, as opposed to the technology used for personal or entertainment purposes. The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.\n\nHarvard Business Review coined the term information technology in 1958 to distinguish between purpose-built machines designed to perform a limited scope of functions and general-purpose computing machines that could be programmed for various tasks. As the IT industry evolved from the mid-20th century, computing capability increased, while device cost and energy consumption decreased, a cycle that continues today when new technologies emerge.\n\nTypes of information technology\n\nInformation technology encompasses a wide range of technologies and systems that are used to store, retrieve, process and transmit data for specific use cases.\n\nCommon information technology types include the following:\n\nInternet and web technologies. This includes the tools and protocols used to access, navigate and interact with information on the internet. Examples include web browsers, websites, web servers, Hypertext Markup Language, cascading style sheets, JavaScript, HTTP and other internet-related technologies.\n\nCloud computing. This involves the delivery of computing resources and services over the internet on a pay-per-use basis. This can include infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, software as a service and cloud storage options.\n\nDatabases. This includes IT systems and software used to store, organize and retrieve data. Examples include MySQL, NoSQL, relational database management systems and MongoDB.\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning. AI and ML-based IT technologies use algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Examples include speech recognition, image recognition and natural language processing.\n\nCybersecurity. This type of IT includes technologies and best practices designed to protect IT systems, networks and data from unauthorized access, cyber attacks and other security threats. Cybersecurity can be enforced through firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, intrusion detection systems and security policies.\n\nInternet of things. This includes the network of interconnected devices and sensors that collect, exchange and analyze data. IoT technologies enable the integration of physical objects into computer systems, providing automation, monitoring and control in various domains.\n\nIT governance. This involves making policies and rules for the organization to ensure effective operation.\n\nData analytics and business intelligence. BI focuses on tools and techniques for extracting insights from large data sets to support decision-making and business operations. This can include data mining, statistical analysis, data visualization and predictive modeling.\n\nWhat does information technology encompass?\n\nThe IT department ensures that the organization's systems, networks, applications, data and information all connect and function properly. The IT team handles the following three major areas:\n\nThis article is part of\n\nWhat is IT/OT convergence? Everything you need to know\n\nWhich also includes:\n\nBenefits and challenges of IT/OT convergence\n\nUnderstand the best IT/OT convergence strategies\n\n5 ways to facilitate the convergence of IT and OT in IoT\n\nDeploying and maintaining business applications, services and infrastructure -- including servers, networks and storage.\n\nMonitoring, optimizing and troubleshooting the performance of applications, services and infrastructure.\n\nOverseeing the security and governance of applications, services and infrastructure.\n\nMost IT staff have different responsibilities within the team that can be broken into the following key areas:\n\nAdministration. Administrators handle the day-to-day deployment, operation and monitoring of an IT environment, including systems, networks and applications. Admins often perform a range of other duties such as software upgrades, user training, software license management, procurement, security, data management and observing adherence to business process and compliance requirements. Effective delegation is also part of IT administration and is crucial for a team's productivity.\n\nSupport. Help desk staff specialize in answering questions, gathering information and directing troubleshooting efforts for hardware and software. IT support often includes IT asset and change management, helping admins with procurement, handling backup and recovery of data and applications, monitoring and analyzing logs and other performance monitoring tools and following established support workflows and processes.\n\nApplications. Businesses rely on software to perform work. Some applications, such as email server applications, are procured and deployed by third parties. But many organizations retain a staff of skilled developers that create the applications and interfaces -- such as application programming interfaces -- needed to deliver critical business capabilities and services. Applications might be coded in a wide array of popular programming languages and integrated with other applications to create smooth and seamless interactions between different applications. Developers might also be tasked with creating interactive business websites and building mobile applications. The trend toward agile or continuous development paradigms requires developers to be increasingly involved with IT operations, such as deploying and monitoring applications.\n\nCompliance. Businesses are obligated to observe varied government and industry-driven regulatory requirements. IT staff play a major role in securing and monitoring access to business data and applications to ensure that such resources are used according to established business governance policy that meets regulatory requirements. Such staff are deeply involved with security tasks and routinely interact with legal and business teams to prevent, detect, investigate and report possible breaches.\n\nWhy is information technology important?\n\nIt's been said that data is what powers industries worldwide. That might be hyperbole, but few businesses -- large or small -- can remain competitive without the ability to collect data and turn it into useful information. IT provides the means to develop, process, analyze, exchange, store and secure information.\n\nData processing plays a significant role in the following core business practices:\n\nProduct development and design.\n\nMarketing and market research.\n\nSales and invoicing.\n\nData analysis and decision-making.\n\nCustomer development and retention.\n\nAccounting and taxes.\n\nHuman resources and payroll.\n\nRegulatory compliance.\n\nInformation technology plays a vital role for businesses in the following ways:\n\nFacilitates communication and collaboration. IT enables seamless communication and collaboration across different locations and time zones. For example, global corporations that are spread across continents can use video conferencing, instant messaging and content collaboration tools to bridge geographical distances and communicate effectively.\n\nAdvances pervasive computing. Computing has penetrated practically every part of business and much of our personal lives. The ubiquity of computing -- also referred to as pervasive computing -- is another reason why IT is critical. Computing devices have evolved well beyond PCs and servers. Today, all businesses and most people have and use multiple computing devices, including phones, tablets, laptops, game consoles and even doorbells, thermostats, vacuums and many kitchen appliances.\n\nEnhances efficiency and productivity. IT systems and tools streamline processes, automate repetitive tasks and provide access to real-time data, thereby improving the overall efficiency and productivity of businesses. For example, a retail company with an integrated IT system can use an automated inventory management tool to track stock levels in real time and replenish them through automatic reordering.\n\nEnables access to information. IT provides access to vast amounts of information and knowledge in databases and online libraries, empowering individuals and organizations to make informed decisions and stay updated with the latest developments.\n\nSupports innovation and creativity. IT fosters innovation by providing platforms for creative expression, experimentation and problem-solving. For example, consider a software development company utilizing IT platforms for innovation. Its developers can collaborate in virtual environments, experiment with new coding techniques and technologies and create groundbreaking software through iterative testing, feedback loops and problem-solving.\n\nSupports critical business operations. IT is essential for the smooth functioning of modern businesses, from managing operations and finances to marketing and customer service. For example, most customer service teams use IT systems for efficient communication, issue resolution and feedback collection to ensure a positive user experience.\n\nHelps with education and research. IT plays a vital role in education, providing access to educational resources, facilitating distance learning and supporting research endeavors. Remote learning technologies enable access to education from anywhere, bridging geographical barriers and providing opportunities for lifelong learning.\n\nProvides cost savings. IT reduces costs associated with paper-based processes, manual labor and physical infrastructure, leading to significant savings for both businesses and individuals.\n\nProvides connectivity to the internet. Virtually all IT devices, many of which are part of the IoT, tap into the internet, which interconnects billions of devices worldwide.\n\nExamples of information technology\n\nSo how is IT involved in day-to-day business? Consider the following six common examples of IT and teams at work:\n\nServer upgrade. One or more data center servers are near the end of their operational and maintenance lifecycle. IT staff will perform the following:\n\nSelect and procure replacement servers.\n\nConfigure and deploy the new servers.\n\nBack up applications and data on existing servers.\n\nTransfer that data and applications to the new servers.\n\nValidate that the new servers are working properly.\n\nRepurpose or decommission and dispose of the old servers.\n\nSecurity monitoring. Businesses routinely use tools to monitor and log activity in applications, networks and systems. IT staff receive alerts of potential threats or noncompliant behavior, such as a user attempting to access a restricted file; check logs and other reporting tools to investigate and determine the root cause of the alert; take prompt action to address and remediate the threat, often driving changes and improvements to security posture that can prevent similar events in the future.\n\nNew software. The business determines a need for a new mobile application that can enable customers to log in and access account information or conduct other transactions from smartphones and tablets. Developers work to create and refine a suitable application according to a planned roadmap. Operations staff post each iteration of the new mobile application for download and deploy the back-end components of the app to the organization's infrastructure.\n\nBusiness improvement. A business requires more availability from a critical application to help with revenue or business continuance strategies. The IT staff might be called upon to architect a high-availability cluster to provide greater performance and resilience for the application to ensure that it can continue to function in the face of single outages. This can be paired with enhancements to data storage protection and recovery.\n\nUser support. Developers are building a major upgrade for a vital business application. Developers and admins collaborate to create new documentation for the upgrade. IT staff might deploy the upgrade for limited beta testing -- enabling a select group of users to try the new version -- while also developing and delivering comprehensive training that prepares all users for the new version's eventual release.\n\nDigital workplace organization. Employees in a bustling office are wasting too much time trying to locate paper documents, files and office supplies that are scattered throughout the workspace. The office has decided to incorporate a digital filing and inventory management system. Each document in the office is scanned and stored electronically and tagged with relevant keywords. Additionally, office supplies are also tracked in a digital inventory database. Now, whenever an employee needs to access a document or find a tool, they promptly open the digital inventory system. With just a quick search, they pinpoint the precise file or item along with its current physical location in the workspace. This enhances the efficiency and productivity of the employees.\n\nSoftware vs. hardware\n\nWhen it comes to IT systems, both software and hardware are integral and interdependent components of computer systems. The following are some main differences between the two:\n\nSoftware\n\nSoftware refers to a set of instructions that enable the hardware to perform specific tasks. It includes system software, application software and other programs that run on the computer.\n\nThere are two categories of software: system software and applications. System software encompasses the computer programs that manage the basic computing functions. They include the following:\n\nOperating systems (OSes).\n\nBIOSes.\n\nBoot programs.\n\nAssemblers.\n\nDevice drivers.\n\nExamples of business applications include the following:\n\nDatabases, such as Microsoft SQL Server.\n\nTransactional systems, such as real-time order entry.\n\nEmail servers, such as Microsoft Exchange.\n\nWeb servers, such as Apache and Microsoft's Internet Information Services.\n\nCustomer relationship management, such as Oracle NetSuite and HubSpot.\n\nEnterprise resource planning systems, including SAP S/4HANA.\n\nThese applications use programmed instructions to manipulate, consolidate, disperse and otherwise work with data for a business purpose.\n\nMobile applications that run on smartphones, tablets and other portable devices typically connect with cloud or data center applications over the internet. These applications have expanded the scope of computing and created a new category of software and telecommunications that requires special expertise to maintain.\n\nHardware\n\nHardware refers to the physical components of a computer that come in many different forms, including the monitor, servers, central processing unit, keyboard and mouse. Computer servers run business applications. Servers interact with client devices in the client-server model. They also communicate with other servers across computer networks, which typically link to the internet.\n\nStorage is another type of hardware. It's any technology that holds information as data. Storage can be local on a specific server or shared among many servers, and it could be installed on-premises or accessed via a cloud service. Information that is stored can take many forms, including file, multimedia, telephony, and web and sensor data. Storage hardware includes volatile RAM (random-access memory) as well as non-volatile tape, hard disk drives and solid-state drives.\n\nTelecom equipment -- comprising network interface cards, cabling, wireless communications and switching devices -- connects the hardware elements together and to external networks.\n\nAbstracting hardware and software\n\nAbstraction simplifies resource provisioning, management and scalability. By hiding the complexities of hardware, abstraction streamlines resource allocation, ensuring optimal utilization of available resources.\n\nIT architectures have evolved to include virtualization and cloud computing, where physical resources are abstracted and pooled in different configurations to meet application requirements. Clouds can be distributed across locations and shared with other IT users, or they can be contained within a corporate data center or some combination of both deployments.\n\nVolatility is a characteristic of virtualized resources, enabling them to expand and contract as needed. Subscription-based cloud or locally installed resources, such as storage or composable architectures, can spin up resources, such as servers, OSes and application software, as needed and then release them when processing is complete.Top of Form\n\nInformation technology vs. computer science\n\nWhen researching careers in IT, one is likely to come across the term computer science.
