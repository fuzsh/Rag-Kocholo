        "text": "IRS-compliant mileage logs are a necessity for organizations with employees whose job responsibilities require a vehicle.\n\nTracking mileage substantiates the business use of a vehicle to avoid taxing employees and to allow the company to write off reimbursements as a business expense.\n\nIn other words, if you want to provide a tax-free reimbursement, you have to record employees’ business mileage – unless you want to track every single car expense.\n\nMileage tracking for IRS-accountable reimbursements\n\nWhen it comes to offsetting employees’ business expenses, the IRS distinguishes between accountable plans (tax-free reimbursement) and non-accountable plans (taxable compensation).\n\nIn order to meet the criteria for an IRS-accountable plan, you must prove that all payments to an employee – whether a monthly car allowance, a mileage reimbursement rate, or a fuel card – constitute reimbursement for business expenses, and not compensation.\n\nTo prove these payments are reimbursements, you have to show that the payments do not exceed the business expenses incurred by the employee while operating a vehicle.\n\nAn IRS-compliant mileage log is the only way to prove this without resorting to the tedious process of tracking each employee’s individual expenses.\n\nThe form your company’s mileage log takes can impact several different aspects of the organization beyond taxation:\n\nCost control\n\nEmployee productivity\n\nAdministrative efficiency\n\nAttrition rates\n\nEmployee privacy\n\nCRM adoption by employees\n\nThe type of mileage log available has always depended on current technology. Originally, mileage logs were paper books to store entries that included date, business purpose, origin, destination, odometer readings, and miles driven.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1980s, computers revolutionized the mileage log book. Many organizations began storing mileage in spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel. Recording mileage remained time-consuming because it still involved keeping a separate log and inputting data each week or month into the spreadsheet. However, spreadsheets added convenience by automating the arithmetic and allowing electronic record-keeping.\n\nIn the early 2000s companies adopted new software to track and reimburse expenses. Some of these expense systems relied on odometer readings. Others integrated with Google Maps. All the driver had to do was enter a starting address, a destination, and a description, and the expense system did the rest.\n\nIntegration accelerated in the 2010s as mobile apps emerged to store and calculate mileage. Some of these apps continue to rely on Google Maps and manual inputs, but others use GPS tracking to automatically calculate and record mileage. All the driver has to do is press “Play” on a smartphone or tablet.\n\nMany companies have yet to adopt these integrated mileage platforms. This matters. A lot. To understand why, let’s look at each of the available mileage capture methods and consider their possible impacts on an organization.\n\nFor decades, nearly all mileage logs relied on self-reported mileage (manual entry and calculation). While self-reporting can take many forms, no form can eliminate the costly problems inherent to self-reporting.\n\nThe most common form of self-reported mileage is the spreadsheet. It's easy to use Microsoft Excel to create a spreadsheet that calculates mileage once you enter the trip information. However, the spreadsheet mileage log is a deeply flawed approach.\n\nSelf-reported mileage logs are subject to human error\n\nAccuracy is necessary for effective mileage capture. But self-reported mileage relies on humans who are prone to error and may not always act honestly.\n\nYou can switch from a paper logbook to an Excel spreadsheet, but you’re still relying on human beings to input accurate trip data in the first place. You can reduce redundancy and opportunity for errors by using an integrated expense system, but as long as the calculations rely on human-provided data, there’s still room for mistakes and dishonesty.\n\nSelf-reported mileage logs are subject to costly shortcuts\n\nLet’s face it – mobile employees are tasked with a wide variety of time-consuming responsibilities. As rational beings, they will look for shortcuts. We all do this.\n\nTheir tasks may include keeping up with internal reports, CRMs, and more. When employees are tasked with calculating business mileage, costly shortcuts occur.\n\nThey may estimate or guess mileage. They may even buffer their mileage, especially if their reimbursement rate isn’t keeping up with their expenses. (Try checking their productivity against their mileage. If the latter rises but not the former, that could be an indicator of buffering.)\n\nIf an employee makes an error with their mileage, the error will likely be in their favor. Even small errors or slight over-estimates can add up over time across a large organization.\n\nSelf-reported mileage logs are nearly impossible to audit\n\nWhen employees self-report, it’s very difficult to test their accuracy. How do you catch errors in mileage inputs or discern whether a trip occurred in the first place? Can you afford to task management with this level of time-consuming oversight?\n\nMany organizations find themselves at the mercy of employees *hopefully* doing the right thing when it comes to mileage capture and calculation. This is a costly proposition, especially if you pay the IRS business rate of 67 cents per mile (for 2024).\n\nSelf-reported mileage logs demand unproductive employee time\n\nPaper logbooks and Excel spreadsheets obviously require significant non-revenue generating time. But even expense systems do not fully solve this problem.\n\nEmployees must carry out many of the following steps:\n\nKeep a log of trips for the month\n\nCalculate mileage for the trips\n\nEnter the information into the spreadsheet or expense system\n\nSubmit the mileage for approval\n\nHave the mileage approved\n\nCorrect any errors that are caught during mileage approval and resubmit\n\nThis is an inefficient process and leaves the door open to human error.\n\nGoogle Maps cannot fix the spreadsheet mileage log problem.\n\nEven if mobile workers utilize Google Maps or MapQuest to determine trip distance, accuracy can still suffer, and inefficiency can still result.\n\nMapping tools look for the shortest time between point A and point B. However, interstate travel can make a longer route the fastest.\n\nAnd what if an employee takes an alternative route because of traffic, construction, or weather? They are left to add mileage to make up the difference between the actual route and the Google Maps calculated mileage. Or they must undertake the time-consuming process of creating a customized route in Google Maps.\n\nTrue, utilizing mapping software takes less time and delivers higher accuracy than other manual forms of calculating mileage, but it cannot fully solve the problems inherent to self-reported mileage.\n\nNearly everyone has used GPS to navigate on a trip, whether with a Garmin device or an iPhone app. The Global Positioning System has become a part of everyday life, and it’s quickly becoming the most accurate and efficient way to record mileage.\n\nGPS devices communicate with a network of satellites to pinpoint the device’s geographic location. The Department of Defense began developing what would become the GPS system in the 1960s to improve navigation and to track nuclear submarines.\n\nIn the 1980s, the airline industry became the first commercial users of GPS. By the 2000s, the shipping industry had adopted GPS to track packages. And now nearly everyone uses GPS to get around. That means nearly everyone can be tracked as they go about their business. And there’s the rub. Who wants to be tracked like a FedEx package or a nuclear sub?\n\nGPS mileage tracking: effectiveness vs. privacy\n\nThere’s no way around it: GPS mileage tracking is the most convenient and low-cost option for mileage capture. There’s no easier way to comply with the IRS mandate of “fresh” mileage logs. When it comes to calculating mileage, there is no better substitute to capture the actual route. It is difficult for employees to make up a trip or mileage using GPS.\n\nPlus, GPS mileage tracking leverages existing hardware. Mobile employees all use a mobile phone or tablet already, so why not employ these tools to track mileage and eliminate self-reporting?\n\nEdward Snowden. The NSA. Facebook. Big Brother. People living in the 21st century face an unprecedented awareness of ways they can be monitored by powerful organizations. No one wants their boss added to that list. Or do they?\n\nHow real employees feel about GPS tracking\n\nAn independent survey conducted by TSheets in 2016 found that only 5% of workers who had been tracked by employers using a GPS system had a negative experience. In fact, 54% had a positive view, with the rest feeling neutral.\n\nIn 2019, mBurse surveyed mobile workers about GPS tracking and found that 81% would support their employer tracking their business mileage if it meant receiving full reimbursement of vehicle expenses.\n\nOverall, while some employees express concerns about micromanagement and being tracked after hours, those who have been tracked find those concerns largely alleviated. Privacy concerns tend to dissipate if an employer uses GPS tracking in ways that clearly protect employees’ privacy and that don’t lead to micromanagement.\n\nBest practices for mileage tracking apps\n\nIn order to realize the benefits of GPS mileage logs without driving employees out the door, it’s important to choose an appropriate GPS app and institute guidelines for appropriate use.\n\n1. Choose a GPS app that delivers only business mileage data to the employers.\n\nDrivers should be able to edit trips and designate certain portions as personal so that no data about these trips will be sent to the employer. Our GPS app mLog, for example, never shares real-time location data with employers, allowing users to designate personal mileage before data is submitted for reimbursement. Drivers should also be able to turn off the app if necessary.\n\n2. Set clear boundaries for acceptable use of business mileage data.\n\nJust because you have data on your employees’ whereabouts during business travel doesn’t mean you have to have a conversation about every detail. The primary purpose of the GPS app is to provide accurate mileage tracking for reimbursement and tax purposes.\n\nUsing a GPS app can boost productivity simply by providing greater visibility of work habits. It is standard for most organizations to monitor employees’ usage of the internet on company devices. The simple fact of monitoring discourages unproductive internet use without any micromanagement.\n\nIt’s all about how you use the data.\n\nGPS III and business mileage reporting\n\nThe U.S. Air Force contracted with Lockheed Martin to develop GPS III as a new satellite design that will revolutionize the use of GPS tools. With more powerful signals, an expanded navigational payload, and a 15-year life expectancy, GPS III will improve accuracy while extending the satellites' orbit life.\n\nGPS III’s signals will triple the current accuracy. The U.S. government is in the process of adding new civilian signals to the existing civilian signal. Most notably, signals L1C and L2C will reduce the “urban canyon” effect and the blocking effect of mountains and hills.\n\nSome of the new satellites have been launched already, and all ten should be operational by 2023.\n\nWith GPS III on the horizon, now is a great time to switch to a GPS mileage log and leverage this increasingly powerful technology.\n\nWhile most organizations have long since left paper mileage logs behind, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets remain the norm for many. Spreadsheets are easy and require no research or training.\n\nBut is the status quo worth the hours of unproductive time and uncontrollable costs? The tools exist to revolutionize mileage capture. Consider the benefits of using a mobile app mileage log from the employee’s point of view:\n\nNo more tedious compiling and reporting of mileage\n\nNo more looking up mileage using Google Maps\n\nConvenient integration and automation of mileage capture and reimbursement\n\nConfidence that no one will second-guess recorded mileage\n\nAnd consider the benefits from management's viewpoint:\n\nGreater cost control\n\nIncreased productivity\n\nMore efficient reimbursement process\n\nImproved CRM adoption\n\nIn the 21st century, you need a 21st-century mileage log. Take the time to explore your options.\n\nNew apps are being created on a regular basis. Technology continues to progress. Increasing numbers of organizations are switching to mileage apps.\n\nDon’t get left behind. Try a 30-day free trial."
