I am not able to find out any NetSuite API which does this. So I just want to know if there is any API which I can use or if not then what could be the alternatives to achieve this.\n\nThere is no API available to check if a user is currently logged in. The only thing you can get from NetSuite is the TimeStamp of the logins if it is Successful or Failed but it will not tell you when the user logs out or still actively in the account. You may want to check it at Setup > Users/Roles > View Login Audit Trail.\n\nanswered Mar 25, 2015 at 1:13\n\nvVincethvVinceth\n\n91555 silver badges77 bronze badges"
