        "text": "NetSuite Accounting Pros and Cons\n\nBefore thoroughly analyzing the platform, letâ€™s take a quick look at some NetSuite pros and cons.\n\nWhat is Oracle NetSuite for Accounting?\n\nNetSuite is a popular name in the cloud accounting industry, with over 37,000 current users and a presence in more than 215 countries.\n\nIt all started in 1998 when Evan Goldberg and Larry Ellison came up with the idea of selling software online.\n\nNetSuite began as a web-hosted accounting company with $125 million in capital from Larry, the founder and CEO of Oracle.\n\nIt became the first company to sell business applications on the internet. However, NetSuite was not under Oracleâ€™s brand name at the time. It was only in 2016 that Oracle made a formal offer to purchase NetSuite for $9.3 billion.\n\nOracle NetSuite is one of the biggest names in enterprise-level accounting solutions.\n\nHaving won over 80 awards in its 25+ years journey, it continues to simplify accounting for businesses.\n\nYou can automate various parts of your business, such as invoicing, payments, and journal entries.\n\nPlus, NetSuite is well-known for its extensive reporting functions, which allow you to quickly generate personalized reports.\n\nIs NetSuiteâ€™s Software Good for Accounting?\n\nThe NetSuite accounting package is one of the best enterprise-level accounting software in the market, particularly for large-scale businesses that need customization.\n\nUnlike other accounting tools, you arenâ€™t limited to a pre-set package of features. Instead, you can pick and choose the features (modules) you need and only pay for those. You can also customize the NetSuite dashboard according to the specific user role.\n\nIt allows you to create and automate invoices, manage vendor payments, and generate reports. Plus, NetSuite is one of the few platforms with a dedicated feature to help accountants during financial close and tax management.\n\nThat said, NetSuite is not as cheap as some of its competitors. In addition to a monthly subscription, you have to pay a one-time setup fee, which can cost anywhere between $10,000 and $300,000. This is why we found NetSuite incompatible with small businesses.\n\nYou can look at alternatives like Xero or Zoho Books if youâ€™re on a tight budget. However, only a few accounting software products can match (or come close to) NetSuiteâ€™s accounting capabilities.\n\nNetSuite Key Features\n\nNetSuite offers a host of accounting features to streamline recording and reporting transactions. Letâ€™s look at some of the core ones.\n\nCash Management\n\nNetSuite simplifies cash and bank account management by automating many reconciliation tasks.\n\nFor starters, you can connect your bank accounts and credit cards to your NetSuite account, and all the transactions will flow seamlessly into your accounting dashboard.\n\nThen, NetSuiteâ€™s intelligent rules engine matches all your bank data with entries in your books of account and reconciles them automatically. This saves you the time of going through each entry and matching them manually.\n\nIf you do not post your bank transaction journal entries, NetSuite will do it for you by using predefined user criteria.\n\nFurthermore, you also get a NetSuite Cash 360 Dashboard for a snapshot of your cash and bank balances. You can also quickly generate accurate future cash forecasts and run various what-if scenarios to plan future expenses and cash flows.\n\nFixed Asset Management\n\nNetSuite has a dedicated fixed asset management module that automates fixed asset depreciation and lease accounting. You can manage a fixed asset throughout its entire lifecycle â€“ from procurement to disposal.\n\nYou can maintain an extensive fixed asset list and include relevant information like purchase date, cost, location, and estimated useful life. NetSuite automatically calculates the depreciation and applies it to your books of accounts.\n\nYou can even develop a custom method for depreciation. Suppose you have a seasonal business. In that case, you can depreciate your assets based on the number of units produced. This way, when production is slow, depreciation will also be less, and your profits will be more accurate.\n\nAnother advantage is easy fixed asset reporting. You can generate several reports using different filters, such as asset location and value.\n\nFinancial Close Management\n\nClosing your books of accounts at the end of a financial year can be a hassle, and key details can be easily missed. With NetSuite, though, you get a standardized close checklist so that you can close your books in the right order.\n\nThis way, your accounting team clearly understands what they need to do, and managers can ensure that no account is left open.\n\nConsolidating accounts can be even more challenging if yours is a large company with several subsidiaries (or even a single subsidiary, for that matter). However, NetSuite automatically posts and consolidates subsidiary-level accounts.\n\nYou can review the consolidations and make changes if needed. NetSuite gives you a great starting point for your consolidations, which otherwise you would have had to build from scratch.\n\nAccounts Receivables\n\nNetSuiteâ€™s â€˜at-a-glanceâ€™ dashboards give you a unified view of all your receivables. You can see each customerâ€™s record in detail, including contacts, open invoices, and transaction and communication history.\n\nIn our testing, we loved NetSuiteâ€™s automated invoicing feature, which converts sales orders into invoices when the orders are met.\n\nPlus, if a customer places multiple orders in a single billing period, the platform is smart enough to convert them into one invoice. And when the payments are received, it automatically allocates them to each order.\n\nIf you donâ€™t want to use the pre-set invoice templates, you can create your own and send them via fax, e-mail, or online. You can even add a â€˜Pay Nowâ€™ button to your e-invoices and receive payments via card, ETF, bank transfer, and check.\n\nTax Management\n\nNetSuiteâ€™s tax module helps you comply with all tax requirements no matter the country in which you operate. The platformâ€™s built-in tax logic calculates taxes on every sale according to the tax jurisdiction.\n\nNetSuite also validates the VAT numbers of all your vendors so that there are no errors when reporting.\n\nThe invoices include line-by-line details of the taxes charged, including rate change histories so that auditors can quickly find the rationale behind tax charges.\n\nYou can even set your own tax rules, such as exempt items and sales tax holidays. Pulling up and customizing reports is also easy. You can generate real-time reports on sales taxes and VAT positions.\n\nNetSuite Accounting Pricing\n\nNetSuiteâ€™s pricing is not publicly available. Youâ€™ll have to contact their sales team and list your requirements to get a custom quote suited to your needs.\n\nYouâ€™ll also have to pay an annual license fee to use NetSuite. This fee is made up of three components: core platform access, optional modules, and the number of users.\n\nWhile core platform access is a standard offering, the price varies depending on the additional modules you need and the number of users you want to bring on board.\n\nOnce you purchase a plan, you can add additional modules or users whenever the need arises. The average licensing fee is around $999/month.\n\nIn addition to this, youâ€™ll also have to shell out a one-time setup fee, which can range from $10,000 to $300,000, depending on your businessâ€™s size.\n\nAlthough itâ€™s difficult to put a finger on NetSuiteâ€™s exact cost, itâ€™s certainly among the most expensive cloud accounting software out there. This is why it is well-suited for large enterprises with complex accounting needs.\n\nNetSuite Interface and Ease of Use â€“ Is It Easy to Use?\n\nThe best thing about NetSuite is that the interface and dashboard depend on the userâ€™s role. So, the dashboard for accountants will be totally different from that of administrators.\n\nThe main NetSuite board contains two major parts: the Centers and the Portlets. Centers are options in a blue toolbar at the top of the dashboard. From here, you can access options like Customers, Vendors, Payroll, Documents, and Payments.\n\nNext are the Portlets, which are movable panels containing various shortcuts specific to a user role.\n\nFor example, an accounts payable managerâ€™s dashboard contains Portlets with quick access to vendor lists, aging reports, and open bills. The left side of the dashboard has a list of reminders or a to-do list.\n\nIf you switch to the administrator role, the dashboard changes dramatically. You now see a System Notes Audit Log portlet in the center while the shortcuts are pushed to the left. Youâ€™ll also see a new â€˜Customizationâ€™ option in the Center tab.\n\nIn a nutshell, NetSuite is highly customizable and lets you personalize these dashboards further according to your role. This ensures you have all the tools you need to do your job in one place.\n\nNetSuite also offers a handy on-the-go app for both Android and iOS devices. The app allows you to manage expenses and billable time, your NetSuite Calendar, edit and attach files, and make and receive business calls.\n\nHowever, the app canâ€™t really replace the desktop version.\n\nLike on a desktop, you get various customizable Portlets for a quick view of your key performance indicators.\n\nWe found the app to be just an extension of the software, which you can use to view crucial information. NetSuite is primarily desktop software and performs best on a PC or laptop.\n\nNetSuite vs Top Accounting Software\n\nHereâ€™s a look at some NetSuite accounting package alternatives so that you can better understand its competition and what they have to offer â€“ ultimately choosing a platform that best suits your specific needs.\n\nAs you can see, NetSuite is certainly a notch ahead when it comes to accurately performing core accounting functions. Plus, it offers large teams an industry-leading level of customization that weâ€™ve not seen from any other accounting platform.\n\nYou can manage your cash and bank balances in real time, generate and share invoices, get paid instantly, manage GST and VAT compliances, and generate customizable reports with NetSuite.\n\nHowever, NetSuiteâ€™s pricing means that it is not for everyone. So, if youâ€™re looking for a more affordable solution, weâ€™d recommend alternatives like Xero or Zoho Books.\n\nXero starts at just $29/month/user, and even its most expensive plan, $62/month, is a lot cheaper than NetSuite. However, Xero wonâ€™t give you functions like fixed assets or financial close management.\n\nIf you want an in-depth comparison of NetSuite with the others, read our guide to the best accounting software. There, we also list the most important factors you should consider to select the most appropriate tool for your needs.\n\nNetSuite Reviews â€“ What are Customers Saying?\n\nNow that you know how powerful NetSuite can be for your business, letâ€™s dive deep into some Netsuite accounting software reviews from some real users.\n\nThe platform has a 4-star rating on G2 from 3,000+ reviews, more than 47% of which are 5-star reviews. Hereâ€™s some feedback from a manager handling 1,000+ employees.\n\nAs you can see, people love NetSuiteâ€™s customizability.

Its automated bank reconciliation has also drawn praise from regular users.\n\nHowever, a few users pointed out the steep learning curve associated with the platform. During our testing, we found this to be true to an extent. With so many features, it can take some time for novices to get the hang of the product.\n\nHowever, once you do, NetSuiteâ€™s capabilities make sure you can handle all your accounting needs from one place. Simply put, time spent learning NetSuiteâ€™s functionalities has an insane return on investment in the long run.\n\nWhy You Can Trust Our NetSuite Accounting Review\n\nOur experts have over a decade of experience reviewing and testing different SaaS products, including the best accounting software.\n\nWeâ€™ve tested, compared, and drafted comprehensive reviews of popular accounting solutions, which gives us first-hand knowledge of the industry.\n\nIt is from this experience that we can identify and bring you only the best and value-adding accounting software.\n\nDuring our NetSuite testing, we signed up for a plan and used every feature the platform offers.
