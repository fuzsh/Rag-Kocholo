There’s no need to import or run a third-party system to post to the general ledger. All is easily accessible in one system.\n\nThis reduces the cost of unnecessary external systems and expenses derived from manually data.\n\nNetSuite SuitePeople Payroll is available as an add-on module to all NetSuite users in the United States or companies with American subsidiaries.\n\nFor those outside of the United States, NetSuite’s platform is easily integrated with other third party payroll applications that ensure all information is under one home.\n\nFor more information on everything NetSuite, keep up with our series, NetSuite: What Is It? or contact our team of experts today."
