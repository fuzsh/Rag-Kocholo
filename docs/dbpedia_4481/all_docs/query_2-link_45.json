On this page, we’ll show you how NetSuite pricing works, and how you can score the best possible ROI when licensing from ScaleNorth. Discover how Oracle NetSuite pricing works, and how ScaleNorth can help you get the most from your ERP investment.\n\nTopics Covered on this Page:\n\nHow much does NetSuite cost?\n\nIndustry Suites & Bundles\n\nWhat industries use NetSuite?\n\nWhat does a NetSuite implementation cost?\n\nWhy buy NetSuite from a Solution Provider?\n\nThe ScaleNorth advantage\n\nHow do I get a NetSuite demo?\n\nNetSuite pricing summary\n\nNetSuite Pricing and Cost\n\nFirst, you’ll need to determine which NetSuite modules are needed to effectively and efficiently run your business. NetSuite’s core ERP offering is complemented by dozens of modules that provide unique functionalities. These modules span a variety of business functions ranging from supply chain management to human resources.\n\nNetSuite’s additional modules seamlessly integrate into the core ERP offering, so cross-departmental data is available whenever you need it without duplication of data entry or efforts.\n\nDon’t be intimidated by the robust list of modules. When utilizing a NetSuite Solution Provider like ScaleNorth, our expert NetSuite consultants will do a deep dive into your business processes to determine which NetSuite package is right for you.\n\nNetSuite Users\n\nAs with many software solutions, the number of users also affects NetSuite pricing. User licenses are required for the members of your team who need access to the NetSuite instance. Full user licenses allow complete use of the software and will be needed for everyone ranging from warehouse managers to CFOs. Not everyone in your organization will need access, so avoid using your overall headcount for this estimation. Sharing licenses is discouraged, as it can also cause internal issues with auditing errors, efforts, and changes.\n\nThere are also partial user licenses, called “Self-Service Users” or sometimes “Employee Center Users”, with limited but essential functionality such as tracking time entries or entering expense reports.\n\nNetSuite does not offer “read-only” licenses. However, it does allow for the exporting of CSVs, dashboards, and other forms of information so data can be distributed to users without access.\n\nTo help keep your NetSuite pricing to a minimum, you’re able to add users at any given time, so you only pay for what you need. In the event that you need to remove users, you can do so during any renewal period.\n\nWhat NetSuite Versions are Available?\n\nNetSuite pricing is also affected by the SKU that is required. The different Suites available are NetSuite Starter, NetSuite Standard, and NetSuite Premium. These editions are simply based on the number of NetSuite user licenses required and/or your organizational headcount.\n\nThere is a 4th and cheaper option, NetSuite Financials, which omits some functionality in pursuit of cost savings.\n\nLastly, there is the BPO route for growing small businesses. In this instance, a BPO Provider like ScaleNorth carves out user licenses for your business and provides outsourced accounting using those licenses. You don’t technically own the licenses, so it’s a cost-effective way to get onto the platform while enjoying the benefits of outsourced accounting. When you choose to take over the licenses yourself, it’s a matter of a few signatures.\n\nNetSuite Financials\n\nThe most basic package is “NetSuite Financials.” The financial Suite gives you all the financial functionality of NetSuite ERP including:\n\nAn employee center for time tracking and expense management\n\nAccounts Receivable & Accounts Payable\n\nBank Management & Reconciliations\n\nGeneral Ledger\n\nMulti-Currency\n\nMulti-Language\n\nOrder Management\n\nProcurement\n\nCredit card acceptance\n\nBasic Inventory Management\n\nBasic Project Management\n\nNetSuite Standard\n\nNext in line, NetSuite’s Standard offering is the ideal solution for businesses with more than 10 named users as well as those with two or more legal entities.\n\nIt allows you to consolidate financials across multiple currencies, making running multiple entities in more than one country a breeze. The mid-market package is the most utilized Suite available.\n\nNetSuite Premium\n\nBoasting the same features as Starter and Mid-Market, NetSuite Premium Edition is the ideal solution for businesses requiring 1,000 or more named user licenses.\n\nReady to see the true cost of NetSuite for your business? Start the conversation with ScaleNorth today.\n\nNetSuite Tiers\n\nThere are different NetSuite “tiers” to keep in mind, which are derived not only from the number of users, but the amount of storage and monthly transaction lines allotted. This is independent of the Suite type (Mid-Market, Enterprise, etc.).\n\nService Tier Maximum Users File Storage Monthly Transactional Lines Standard 100 100 GB 200,000 Premium 1,000 1,000 GB 2,000,000 Enterprise 2,000 2,000 GB 10,000,000 Ultimate 4,000 4,000 GB 50,000,000\n\nThe number of transaction lines includes all transaction types. Note, this does not just pertain to the number of sales. It is inclusive of everything from fulfillment to billing. All tiers except for Standard come with a sandbox instance for testing and development.\n\nDuring the implementation process, ScaleNorth will help you determine which tier is best for your business. Should the need to switch tiers arise in the future, doing so is seamless.\n\nNetSuite Industry Suites & Bundles\n\nAs mentioned above, NetSuite has an entire library of modules that can be added on to its base ERP offering to expand its functionality and accommodate a variety of industries and tasks.\n\nNetSuite has taken it a step further by bundling modules that are commonly packaged together by various industries such as Food & Beverage, Manufacturing, and Professional Services. The Professional Services Industry Suite, for example, gives you access to the base ERP system, Customer Relationship Management, Professional Services Automation, and Services Resources Planning.\n\nOther popular Industry Suites include:\n\nWholesale Distributor\n\nCore ERP functions\n\nInventory management\n\nGrid order management\n\nSoftware\n\nCore ERP functions\n\nRevenue management\n\nSoftware management\n\nFinancial management\n\nRetailer\n\nCore ERP functions\n\nFinancial management\n\nGrid order management\n\nDemand planning\n\nInventory management\n\nPOS\n\nPick, pack and ship\n\nWork orders & assemblies\n\nManufacturing\n\nCore ERP functions\n\nGrid order management\n\nWork orders & assemblies\n\nInventory management\n\nWIP & routings\n\nDemand planning\n\nWhether you are adding on modules a-la-carte, or purchasing an industry suite, NetSuite pricing will be affected by the number of modules along with the edition type such as Mid-Market or Enterprise and the appropriate tier.\n\nWhat Type of Businesses Use NetSuite\n\nNetSuite’s industry software solution is trusted by more than 33,000 companies in over 200 countries and territories. Its customers range from small to large businesses because it is designed to support companies at every stage of growth. Further, it caters to practically every industry and business model. Some of the key industries it supports include:\n\nWholesale Distribution Professional Services Software General Services Life Sciences Field Service Manufacturing Franchises Private Equity Retail & Ecommerce Financial Services Energy & Utilities\n\nThe number of transaction lines includes all transaction types. Note, this does not just pertain to the number of sales. It is inclusive of everything from fulfillment to billing. All tiers except for Standard come with a sandbox instance for testing and development.\n\nDuring the implementation process, ScaleNorth will help you determine which tier is best for your business. Should the need to switch tiers arise in the future, doing so is seamless.\n\nDoes NetSuite Work for Small Business?\n\nNetSuite works for businesses of all sizes. While startups or companies under a few million in revenue might be too strapped for cash to undergo an ERP implementation of any type, small businesses with Private Equity backing or those that are on a growth trend are prime candidates for a NetSuite implementation.\n\nSmall, growing businesses can start with NetSuite Financials to keep costs low while enjoying the key benefits of the world’s leading cloud-based ERP system. As you scale, you can tack on more features or modules to ramp up the platform’s power.\n\nWhy is NetSuite the ideal ERP for growing companies?\n\nNetSuite will scale with your business and support its growth from a few million in revenue to $1B+. 20% of Fortune 100’s utilize NetSuite, and it’s often considered the last ERP you will ever need.\n\nNetSuite Implementation Pricing\n\nNetSuite implementations are another factor when calculating true NetSuite pricing. Implementation of NetSuite will vary depending on the size and complexity of your business, the NetSuite partner you choose to work with, the modules required, needed integrations, customizations and more.\n\nAs a result, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how much it will cost to implement NetSuite. However, working with an experienced NetSuite partner like ScaleNorth can help you keep costs down and get the most out of your NetSuite investment.\n\nHow to Reduce Your NetSuite Implementation Cost\n\nTo reduce the cost of a NetSuite implementation, it’s essential to hire a consulting firm that can do it once and do it right. As with many aspects of business, there is always someone out there who can do it cheaper. It’s essential to look far beyond just what a provider may quote you, particularly if the quote is lower than the competition.\n\nThroughout our success as a white-glove NetSuite implementation firm, we’ve seen all too many examples of firms partnering with low-cost providers, only for the project to end in disaster. As a sobering fact, many businesses come to ScaleNorth in search of a NetSuite recovery, or to rescue their failed implementation.\n\nWhen going through a lower cost, but less experienced provider, businesses often invest countless hours and tens of thousands of dollars before realizing that their implementation is dead in the water. They then seek out a more experienced NetSuite implementation team, like ScaleNorth, to turnaround their failing instance and get them where they need to be.\n\nIt serves as a prime example of “you get what you pay for” and shows that going with the cheapest option available typically leads to increased costs and frustration in the long run.\n\nERP implementations will affect every corner of your business for years to come. Therefore, it is essential to seek out a NetSuite implementation team that can do it once and do it right. Doing so will save you time, energy, and money.\n\nNetSuite Implementation Pricing\n\nNetSuite implementation pricing varies by the level of expertise of your consultant and the size & complexity of the project. Expect to pay between $175 – $275 per hour for your NetSuite implementation consultants. Keep in mind that paying a higher hourly rate doesn’t necessarily mean paying more for the project. Advanced consultants can accomplish more in an hour than their less experienced counterparts. Choosing a consultant based on the lowest hourly rate can often lead to a significant increase in billable hours along with a struggling or failed implementation.\n\nTypically, projects take between 50 and 250 hours to complete, but again, that can vary wildly on your business’s needs. A rule of thumb is that an implementation will cost roughly 2 to 3 times the price of the annual NetSuite licensing fee.\n\nNetSuite Implementation Configuration\n\nOnce the project requirements and timelines have been set, your NetSuite consultants will begin the implementation phase. Implementations can last several months and will require internal resources to provide the consultants with information and access when needed. It’s important to note that implementation success is correlated to the availability and willingness of your own internal team. Being responsive and providing the proper resources when needed can drastically improve a consultant’s ability to successfully implement NetSuite.\n\nThis process will involve customizing the platform to fit the business requirements, integrating key parts of your technology stack, building custom dashboards and workflows, and other items part of the project scope.\n\nScaleNorth takes a phased migration approach that allows for a seamless transition over to the new system. Our data experts will migrate your data from the legacy system, so all historical information is preserved.\n\nOnce the system is configured, you’ll undergo User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to determine that everything is working properly, and that your employees understand how to operate on the new platform.\n\nFinally, it’s time to go live on NetSuite ERP and reap the benefits for years to come.\n\nWhy work with a NetSuite Solution Provider?\n\nFirst, what is NetSuite’s Direct Team?\n\nNetSuite has an internal team that sells and implements the software. This is known as NetSuite’s Direct Team. While they have everything you need to get up and running on NetSuite, there are some key advantages of using a Solution Provider that you should be aware of.\n\nWhat are NetSuite Solution Providers?\n\nNetSuite Solution Providers like ScaleNorth are approved resellers of NetSuite software and can help smooth the process from evaluation, to purchase and implementation, to ongoing support.\n\nSolution Providers have direct access to NetSuite resources and will help you find the best solution for your company. We’ll work directly with NetSuite’s team to get the best package and pricing for your needs, so you can be sure you’re getting the best NetSuite pricing. There is no markup on the cost of NetSuite when you purchase the software through a Solution Provider.\n\nNetSuite Solution Providers can bring a number of advantages to the table that help you get the most out of your ERP investment. For starters, roughly half of a successful NetSuite implementation involves software and tasks outside of the NetSuite ecosystem. Most companies that implement NetSuite will want one or more key pieces of software integrated with the platform. Utilizing a Solution Provider with technical integration knowledge will be key to creating optimal efficiency.\n\nSome NetSuite partners specialize in specific industries while lacking experience in others, so you’ll want to vet your Solution Provider to determine if they understand the pain points and underlying strategies of your business and the industry it operates in.\n\nThe ScaleNorth Advantage\n\nScaleNorth is the largest ERP value added reseller that strictly focuses on NetSuite and the systems connected to it.

We’ve included some role specific NetSuite demos below.\n\nNetSuite for the Controller\n\nNetSuite for the CFO\n\nNetSuite for the CIO\n\nNetSuite for the Sales Manager\n\nNetSuite for the Operations Manager\n\nNetSuite for the Support Rep\n\nCustom NetSuite Demos\n\nOne of the key value propositions of NetSuite is its ability to be heavily customized to your industry and internal processes.
