        "text": "Oracle NetSuite has tools and teams, such as ACS Optimize and Support, to help solve performance-related problems and optimize your service tier and number of SuiteCloud Plus licenses.\n\nWhen you think about performance, your most common question is likely how long will it take? Performance issues including page load times, integration request process times, and single transaction load/save/edit times can be resolved by using the Application Performance Management tools, doing root cause analysis with Support, and involving ACS for more technical health-check reports. Regardless of your service tier, you should use these tools and teams to help you optimize the performance of your NetSuite account.\n\nFor more information, see Application Performance Management (APM).\n\nWhen you think about scalability, your most common question is likely how many do we need? Scalability issues include user counts, map-reduce, and integration concurrency, which can be monitored using APM Concurrency. One main option to resolve these issues is to purchase additional SuiteCloud Plus licenses. The service tier you choose, affects the maximum number of SuiteCloud Plus licenses you can add to your NetSuite account.\n\nFor more information, see SuiteCloud Plus Settings.\n\nThe service tier upgrade begins immediately after the sales order is billed. After the sales order is billed, an invoice is generated, and a new license is created for the service tier. You will receive your new service tier within 3 days of license creation.\n\nAfter the new license creation, the system updates the base concurrency threads automatically.\n\nYour new service tier components, such as file cabinet storage size, full licensed users purchased, and monthly transaction line limits are provisioned as of the contract start date.\n\nA user is an individual who has access to a NetSuite account. Full Licensed Users are individuals who are assigned any role (Standard or Custom) that requires the user login to perform activity within NetSuite. To check the number of Full Licensed Users currently provisioned or currently used in your account, go to Setup > Company > View Billing Information and look under Billable Components.\n\nIt is important to note that it is the email address associated with the user that is counted as one user license. That email address can be associated with multiple roles within NetSuite, but still only counts as one Full Licensed User.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf the user only has an Administrator role assigned, this is counted as one user against the Full Licensed Users.\n\nIf the user has both an Administrator role and a Custom role assigned, this only counts as one user against the Full Licensed Users, if the user is using the same email address for both roles.\n\nIf the user has both an Administrator role and an Employee Center role assigned, this is only counted as one user against the Full Licensed Users.\n\nIf the user only has an Employee Center role assigned, this is not counted against the Full Licensed Users count.\n\nThe following roles do not count against the Full Licensed Users count, because they do not grant the user with full NetSuite account access:\n\nCustomer Center role\n\nEmployee Center role\n\nAdvanced Partner Center role\n\nFor more information about the above mentioned roles, see:\n\nCustomizing the Customer Center Role\n\nAbout the Employee Center Role\n\nAssigning the Advanced Partner Center Role\n\nCustomer Center, Vendor Center, and Partner Center Roles"
