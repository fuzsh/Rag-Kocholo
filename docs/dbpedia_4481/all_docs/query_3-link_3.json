        "text": "Statistical schedules in NetSuite allow you to automate your statistical journal entries on a schedule basis. Once you have a schedule set up, you can determine the frequency (monthly, quarterly, etc.) of how often you want your statistical account(s) updated. This will allow you to automatically have the right count in your statistical account without any manual update. In order for the schedule to work, you will need to create a saved search to accurately count the number of data by either class, department or location.\n\nHere is how to create statistical schedules in NetSuite:\n\nStep 1) Create the right Units of Measure Ex: Headcount.\n\nThis is a mandatory step so the system knows what units the statistical account will be tied too.\n\nLists > Accounting > Units of Measure > New\n\nIf using Headcount, populate the necessary fields with a base unit conversion rate of 1\n\nStep 2) Create a Statistical Account\n\n(Statistical accounts are non-monetary accounts that can be used to maintain statistical information for a variety of metrics.)\n\nLists > Accounting > Accounts > New\n\nPopulate Account Number\n\nWrite in Account Name Ex: Headcount\n\nFill in type “Statistical”\n\nSave\n\nStep 3) Create a Saved Search Ex. Employee Search by Department.\n\nThis saved search will need to calculate the correct amount of employees in each department, so we will have to add functionality that sums each employee per department.\n\nReports > Saved Searches > All Saved Searches > New\n\nEmployee Search\n\nFill out the necessary header fields along with the correct check boxes\n\nCriteria – None (Unless you need to filter out certain employees)\n\nResults\n\nField – Name\n\nSummary Type – Count\n\nField – Department\n\nSummary Type – Group\n\nSave\n\nThe final result will look like this:\n\nStep 4) Create Statistical Schedule\n\nTransactions > Financial > Create Statistical Schedule\n\nPopulate Statistical Account\n\nPopulate Saved Search\n\nValidate Saved Search to ensure the count is populating\n\nPopulate Frequency\n\nPopulate Start date\n\nSave\n\nStep 5) To test your schedule\n\nSelect Statistical Schedule in “View Mode”\n\nSelect “Create Journal Entry” button\n\nStep 6) Review your Journal Entry.\n\nWhen reviewing your journal entry, you want to make sure all of the necessary fields are populated.\n\nAll of the header fields (Ex: Accounting period, date etc.)\n\nThe correct Units of Measure\n\nAll of the line fields being populated (Ex: Account, Amount, Memo, Department, Class etc)\n\nHave any questions about how to create statistical schedules in NetSuite for expense allocations?
