        "text": "1.5K\n\nOracle NetSuite is an integrated cloud software suite with project accounting, eCommerce, and other specialized business features.\n\nIt offers NetSuite solutions like NetSuite Professional Services Automation (PSA), NetSuite SuiteSuccess, NetSuite Openair, NetSuite ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), etc.\n\nOne of its main features, time tracking functionality, is a part of NetSuite Professional Services Automation. This feature lets NetSuite users track working hours, record billable hours, and invoice clients.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore NetSuite time tracking, how to use it, and its three limitations. We’ll also look at seven popular alternatives to NetSuite time tracking.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow to use NetSuite time tracking\n\nAdvantages of Netsuite time tracking\n\n3 major limitations of NetSuite time tracking\n\n7 better alternatives to NetSuite time tracking\n\nHow to use NetSuite time tracking\n\nNetSuite offers an interactive timer that lets you generate and submit detailed timesheets, customize time approval workflows, and more. You’ll find the feature in the NetSuite Timesheet Management functionality.\n\nHere are the steps to follow to use the Timer:\n\nClick on Transactions > Employees > Track Time.\n\nEnter the relevant details.\n\nClick on the Timer icon next to the Duration.\n\nHit the Start button when the Timer popup window appears to begin logging time.\n\nClick Pause to stop tracking time when you take a break.\n\nThen, click Submit.\n\nThe tool rounds off your work break time to the nearest minute and will show it automatically in the Duration field.\n\nOther ways to track time in NetSuite\n\nNetSuite offers other time tracking options like:\n\nManual Time Entry: Lets employees enter time entries to track their work hours.\n\nWeekly TimeTracking: Tracks the hours employees work in a week.\n\nWeekly Timesheets: Captures weekly time entries by offering a customizable method.\n\nInteractive Timer: Tracks the hours employees work in real-time.\n\nNow, let’s look at the pros of tracking time using NetSuite.\n\nAdvantages of Netsuite time tracking\n\nHere are the few benefits of tracking employee time using Netsuite:\n\nAllows flexible time entry, i.e., tracking clock in and out times from any location.\n\nOffers self-service timesheet tracking and approvals for better visibility.\n\nNotifies managers when a timesheet is ready for approval.\n\nTracks the approval process from the dashboard.\n\nOffers NetSuite training and education services like webinars, product demos, customer stories, etc., to help train employees.\n\nNow, let’s look at the drawbacks of using NetSuite time tracking.\n\n3 major limitations of NetSuite time tracking\n\nHere are the three important limitations of tracking time with NetSuite:\n\n1. Expensive to set up and maintain\n\nSetting up NetSuite is a complex and tedious process. As a result, you have to provide employees with adequate training on using the tool’s necessary features, increasing expenditure.\n\nAdditionally, the tool has many modules and is difficult to operate. It could confuse employees when an issue arises or if the tool requires maintenance.\n\nFor that, you may have to either employ an in-house IT (Information Technology) team or contact a third-party solution provider for support services and regular maintenance. This could add to the initial expense.\n\n2. Lack of employee monitoring features\n\nNetSuite doesn’t offer employee monitoring features like web and desktop monitoring. As a result, the timer may record non-billable hours where the employee didn’t work.\n\nNetSuite timesheets will also account for the non-billable time, and you may end up paying employees for the time they didn’t work.\n\n3. Disruptive user experience\n\nNetSuite’s time tracking features doesn’t let employees navigate away from the Time Tracking page or the Timer Pop-up window while they track time. This can disrupt an employee’s work and reduce their productivity.\n\nAdditionally, subscribers with the NetSuite CRM+ plan can’t record billable hours, invoice customers’ billable time, or record time for payroll.\n\nInstead, you can use dedicated time tracking tools to track work hours. Let’s take a look at a few of them.\n\n7 better alternatives to NetSuite time tracking\n\nHere are the seven best alternatives to tracking work hours with NetSuite:\n\n1. Time Doctor\n\nTime Doctor is a time tracking and productivity management software that helps you track every minute an employee works in a day, week, or specified date range. Used by small businesses like Thrive Market as well as large enterprises like Ericsson, it offers many integrated time tracking features.\n\nThe tool also offers other robust and user-friendly features to increase employee productivity.\n\nLet’s take a look at some important ones:\n\nKey features\n\nA. Silent and interactive time tracking\n\nTime Doctor offers an interactive and silent time tracker to record every second an employee has worked.\n\nWith the tool’s manual or interactive time tracking feature, an employee can start tracking time when they begin work and stop the timer when they finish or take a break.\n\nIt also offers an automatic or silent time tracking feature that tracks the time when an employee switches on their computer. The timer runs in the background and doesn’t interfere with the task they’re working on.\n\nB. Idle time tracking\n\nTime Doctor’s idle time tracker shows when an employee is idle while the timer runs.\n\nThe tool detects an employee’s keystrokes and mouse movements and records the duration of time they’re idle. Upon crossing a set time limit, the tool nudges the employee to resume work by showing an idle time pop-up alert.\n\nNote: Time Doctor isn’t a keylogger. It only detects whether the employee clicked any keys or moved the mouse.\n\nC. Work schedules\n\nWith the work schedule feature, you can create shifts for employees and track the time they spend on each shift.\n\nYou can also record whether an employee started their shift on time and worked for a minimum number of hours. Based on the time tracked, the tool automatically assigns them attendance statuses, like ‘Absent,’ ‘Present,’ ‘Late,’ or ‘Partially Absent.’\n\nD. Screencasts (Optional)\n\nTime Doctor allows you to take screencasts of employees’ screens to spot unproductive activities and check if they’re working properly.\n\nYou can take screenshots after regular time intervals of 3, 15, or 30 minutes.\n\nNote: Admins and managers can blur or delete screencasts of an employee or a group of employees to protect their privacy.\n\nE. Project and task management\n\nTime Doctor lets you create projects and tasks and assign them to a group or an individual employee. You can also organize tasks by projects or with five default folders for better workflow.\n\nHere are the five default folders the tool offers:\n\nPermanent Tasks: Assigned by admins that can’t be marked as completed.\n\nCurrent Tasks: Which employee is currently working.\n\nNext Tasks: That an employee will work on next.\n\nFuture Tasks: That an employee will work on in the future.\n\nCompleted Tasks: That are marked as completed.\n\nNote: Only admins can assign projects to team members.\n\nF. Productivity ratings\n\nTime Doctor allows you to set productivity ratings for each website and app based on whether they’re relevant to work.\n\nThe different productivity ratings are:\n\nProductive.\n\nUnproductive.\n\nNeutral.\n\nUnrated.\n\nFor example, you can rate Instagram as ‘Unproductive’ and Microsoft Word as ‘Productive’ for your accounts team.\n\nG. Productivity reports\n\nTime Doctor can generate various productivity reports depending on the time tracked. From these reports, you can spot employee productivity patterns like weaknesses and strengths.\n\nHere are the different types of productivity reports:\n\nActivity summary report: Lets you view an employee’s active, unproductive, productive, manual, and mobile time for a selected time range.\n\nTimeline report: Displays the time an employee spends working and taking breaks.\n\nHours tracked report: Shows your team’s work hour data during a specific date range.\n\nProjects & tasks report: Displays how much time an employee spends on different tasks and projects.\n\nCustom export report: Lets you customize employee information to include in an exported report without downloading individual reports.\n\nWeb & app usage report: Lists the sites and applications employees use during work hours, and the time they spend on each of them.\n\nH.
