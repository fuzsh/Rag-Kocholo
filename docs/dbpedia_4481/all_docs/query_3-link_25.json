        "text": "Key takeaways\n\nThe chart of accounts (CoA) is an index of all financial accounts in a company's general ledger.\n\nThere are 5 major account types in the CoA: assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses.\n\nThe leading digit on each account is a reference number indicating what type of account it belongs to.\n\nIt's a best practice to never delete accounts in your CoA until the end of the year.\n\nWhat is a chart of accounts (CoA)?\n\nA chart of accounts is an index of all the financial accounts in a company's general ledger (GL).\n\nThe general ledger is the greater record keeper for a company's financial accounts, with a trial balance validated debit and credit account records.\n\nIt segments financial transactions during a specific accounting period into specific account types.\n\nThe general ledger—and by extension, CoA—tells you where to record each transaction, making lookup and access easy.\n\nCoA replaces the filing cabinets of yore, where back offices had intricate paper indexing systems for their transactions.\n\nNow you have a birds-eye view of a company’s daily operations and how it’s spending and making money.\n\nWhy charts of accounts are important\n\nThe CoA is essential to good bookkeeping and financial management. A standard chart of accounts makes it easy for anybody to come into a business and quickly understand your finances.\n\nIt also makes it easy to track expenses and account balances so you can calculate financial ratios to quickly and easily report on the business's financial health.\n\nBecause it’s an index, it should make it easy to look up numbers and track money coming in and out of the company. It makes recording transactions simple.\n\nA well-designed CoA will help you make better decisions, check your company's financial health, and make it simple to follow accounting and reporting standards.\n\nHow a chart of accounts (CoA) works\n\nThe CoA follows a principle known as double-entry accounting. Every time you log something in the chart of accounts, you make two entries: a debit from one account and a credit to another.\n\nHere's what this means in practice:\n\nSay you buy a new employee laptop for $800. You'd debit $800 from the appropriate Asset accounts (in this case, Cash) and credit $800 to the appropriate Asset accounts (in this case, Computers). This way the chart of accounts stays balanced, with the sum of the two entries being zero every time.\n\nFive major account types in a chart of accounts are divided into balance sheet accounts and income statement accounts. While CoA can vary depending on the business, it will include assets, liabilities, equity, income/revenue, and expenses.\n\nIt's a best practice to list accounts in the order of appearance in financial statements, starting with the balance sheet.\n\nBalance sheet accounts\n\nAssets, liabilities, and equities make up the balance sheet. The balance sheet provides insight into the business’s current financial health and whether or not it owes money.\n\nAsset accounts\n\nThe assets account lists a company's assets. These include liquid assets like cash, inventory, and equipment, plus prepaid expenses like paid-in-full leases or money that is under contract to come in.\n\nThese also include fixed assets like pieces of equipment that the company owns or office supplies like an expensive company printer.\n\nA small corporation might include some arrangement of the following sub-accounts under their assets:\n\nCash (main checking account)\n\nCash (payroll)\n\nCash (main savings account)\n\nMarketable securities\n\nPetty cash balance\n\nAccounts receivable\n\nUndeposited funds\n\nInventory assets\n\nPrepaid insurance\n\nPrepaid expenses\n\nVehicles\n\nBuildings\n\nEquipment\n\nComputers\n\nAsset reference numbers usually begin with a 1.\n\nReference numbers are used within a chart of accounts as the leading digit on each account number denotes its type. This code makes it easier to find specific transactions in your chart of accounts.\n\nThe reference number for Assets is 1, Liabilities is 2, Equity is 3, Income/Revenue is 4, and Expenses are 5, 6, and 7. We’ll get into a more granular breakdown later.\n\nLiabilities\n\nLiabilities are any debt your company owes. These are the typical sub-accounts you'll see under liabilities:\n\nAccounts payable\n\nCompany credit card(s)\n\nWages payable\n\nAccrued liabilities\n\nTaxes payable (including sales tax)\n\nNotes payable\n\nLiability reference numbers usually begin with 2.\n\nYou may have noticed that liability accounts usually have the word \"payable\" in their name. This is because liability accounts are where you record money that is under contract to leave the business but hasn't yet changed hands.\n\nBecause it's the company's obligation to make these payments, these accounts are \"payable.\"\n\nShareholders equity\n\nEquity is whatever is left after subtracting your company's liabilities from its assets. The simplest chart of accounts will only have three equity accounts listed here:\n\nCommon stock\n\nPreferred stock\n\nRetained earnings\n\nEven private companies will have shareholder equity accounts like this if they offer stock options to employees.\n\nEquity accounts usually begin with reference number 3.\n\nIncome statement accounts\n\nExpense and income/revenue accounts make up the income statement, which conveys the business’s overall profitability.\n\nIncome/Revenue\n\nRevenue is the money your business brings in through sales or investments. Revenue accounts keep track of the money that comes in through normal business operations so you can calculate your net income and operating revenues.\n\nInvestment income\n\nSales\n\nSales returns and allowances\n\nFees earned\n\nIncome or revenue account numbers usually begin with reference number 4.\n\nExpenses\n\nExpenses are all the non-debt money you need to spend to keep your business running.\n\nCost of goods sold (COGS)\n\nAdvertising expenses\n\nBank fees\n\nDepreciation expenses\n\nPayroll tax expenses\n\nRent expenses\n\nSupplies expenses\n\nTravel expenses\n\nUtilities expenses\n\nWages expenses\n\nOther expenses\n\nExpense accounts typically begin with reference number 5.\n\nIt's common for organizations to structure their expense accounts by business function. This means that different company divisions have their own expense accounts.\n\nSample chart of accounts\n\nThis is a sample chart of accounts for a fictional SaaS company. You can see account descriptions, their account type, and the corresponding statement type.\n\nNumber\n\nAccount Description\n\nAccount Type\n\nStatement\n\n1010\n\nCash\n\nAssets\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n1020\n\nSavings\n\nAssets\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n1030\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nAssets\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n1080\n\nComputers\n\nAssets\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n2010\n\nAccounts payable\n\nLiabilities\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n2011\n\nCredit cards\n\nLiabilities\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n2014\n\nWages payable\n\nLiabilities\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n2020\n\nAccrued liabilities\n\nLiabilities\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n2050\n\nTaxes payable\n\nLiabilities\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n2060\n\nNotes Payable\n\nLiabilities\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n3010\n\nPreferred Stock\n\nEquity\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n4010\n\nSales\n\nIncome\n\nIncome Statement\n\n5000\n\nAdvertising Expenses\n\nExpenses\n\nIncome Statement\n\n5014\n\nWages Expenses\n\nExpenses\n\nIncome Statement\n\n5050\n\nPayroll Tax Expenses\n\nExpenses\n\nIncome Statement\n\nChart of accounts: best practices\n\nNow let’s review the best practices for managing your chart of accounts.\n\nAccount descriptions\n\nThe chart of accounts should have a short, helpful description next to each account name and account type.\n\nNames like \"Accounts Receivable,\" \"Credit Card (Operations),\" and \"Fees Earned\" all have the appropriate level of detail.\n\nThese descriptions are important: you want to make it easy to find the appropriate accounts to create whatever financial statement you need for your reporting.\n\nDon't delete accounts until the end of the year\n\nIt's a best practice to wait until the end of the year—after a close—to merge, rename, or delete accounts. Changing or removing accounts mid-year can add extra complexity during tax season.\n\nThat said, you can always add new accounts if needed.\n\nDon't create too many accounts\n\nYour chart of accounts is an index, but it's also meant to be a quick lookup table. You don't need to create a separate account for every transaction, utility, or sale.\n\nBe smart about lumping similar items together. This keeps you from creating too many specific accounts and spares you from a painful cleanup process at the end of the year.\n\nBe consistent with your CoA\n\nIt's best if your CoA doesn't dramatically change year over year.\n\nWhy?\n\nYou want to make it easy to compare the performance of different accounts over time. If you're splicing, merging, and deleting accounts, that information can get lost and you'll lose valuable financial data.\n\nOr you'll spend too much time reconstructing old accounts, which can lead to mistakes and inaccurate data.\n\nPlus, the GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) set forth by the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) states regularity and consistency as the first two rules.\n\nConsolidate at the end of the year\n\nTake the end of the year as an opportunity to consolidate and simplify your CoA.\n\nRemember: brevity is elegance. You might be worried that a shorter chart of accounts obfuscates important details, but in our experience, that's unlikely to happen with a good naming system.\n\nUnderstand reference numbers\n\nWe told you we’d come back here! Reference numbers are the first digit on each account number that denotes its type.\n\nMost financial accounting software will automatically assign numbers for you, so you don't need to worry about creating them yourself. You just need to know the code.\n\nAssets - 1\n\nLiabilities - 2\n\nEquity - 3\n\nIncome/Revenue - 4\n\nExpenses - 5, 6, and 7\n\nHere's a more granular breakdown of these different numbers in a standard chart of accounts:\n\n1000 Assets\n\n1200 Receivables\n\n1300 Inventories\n\n1400 Prepaid expenses & other current assets\n\n1500 Property plant & equipment\n\n1600 Accumulated depreciation & amortization\n\n1700 Non-current receivables\n\n1800 Intercompany receivables\n\n1900 Other non-current assets\n\n2000 Liabilities\n\n2100 Payables\n\n2200 Accrued compensation & related items\n\n2300 Other accrued expenses\n\n2500 Accrued taxes\n\n2600 Deferred taxes\n\n2700 Long-term debt\n\n2800 Intercompany payables\n\n2900 Other non-current liabilities\n\n3000 Owner equities\n\n4000 Revenue\n\n5000 Cost of Goods Sold\n\n6000-7000 Operating Expenses\n\nFollow FASB and GAAP chart of account guidelines\n\nFASB is The Financial Accounting Standards Board which determines the GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).\n\nThe FASB is an independent nonprofit organization responsible for establishing accounting and financial reporting standards for companies and nonprofit organizations in the United States. It has the authority to establish and interpret GAAP for all of these entities.\n\nPublic companies in the U.S. must follow GAAP when their accountants compile their financial statements.\n\nUse accounting software\n\nThere are several software solutions that can help automate and manage the chart of accounts.\n\nWhile Excel and Google Sheets are great for beginning businesses, you’ll most likely want a dedicated financial software platform for all of your accounting needs.\n\nBest chart of accounts software\n\nAccounting solutions handle your CoA for you, which makes it super simple and easy to set up.\n\nHere are some of our recommendations:\n\nQuickBooks\n\nQuickBooks from Intuit is more than an accounting solution: it's an ERP trusted by businesses of all sizes and across industries.\n\nWe like QuickBooks in particular because it integrates nicely with Cube, meaning you can keep your data stored in and managed by QuickBooks and import it to Excel or Google Sheets when you're ready to do your strategic finance work.\n\nIt's a win/win.\n\nQuickBooks also has powerful reporting, which makes it easy to produce financial statements and other reports on your company's financial health.\n\nAdditional Features:\n\nIncome & payment tracking\n\nInvoicing\n\nCash flow planning\n\nBill management\n\neCommerce\n\nPayroll\n\nHR advisor\n\nPricing:\n\nSimple Start: $30/month\n\nEssentials: $55/month\n\nPlus: $85/month\n\nAdvanced: $200/month\n\nSelf-Employed: $15/month\n\nSage Intacct\n\nLike QuickBooks, Sage Intacct is an ERP trusted by all kinds of businesses.\n\nQuickBooks is more lightweight than Sage Intacct. We find that most enterprise companies prefer a bigger solution like Sage Intacct while companies who value leanness and agility flock to QuickBooks.\n\nSage Intacct also integrates with Cube, so all the aforementioned benefits still apply.\n\nAdditional Features:\n\nProject accounting\n\nAccounts payable\n\nAccounts receivable\n\nOrder management\n\nInventory management\n\nCash management\n\nCloud planning and budgeting\n\nPricing: Pricing is custom, but customers typically pay between $15,000 - $35,000 on an annual subscription, with sources reporting that pricing can reach $60,000 or more.\n\nNetSuite\n\nLike Sage Intacct, NetSuite is more than a simple accounting solution. It's an enterprise-level, cloud-based ERP.\n\nWe like NetSuite because it's a single platform for multiple services. Just like how marketers like HubSpot because it consolidates several independent tools in one place, FP&A professionals like NetSuite because it does accounting, works as a CRM, and allows for ecommerce transactions.\n\nNetSuite's powerful reporting makes it easy to produce any kind of financial statement or to provide a snapshot of your financial performance.\n\nNetSuite also integrates with Cube, so you can keep your accounting and FP&A separate. We call that a win.\n\nAdditional Features:\n\nFinancial management\n\nInventory management\n\nAcounts receivable\n\nAccounts payable\n\nMulti-currency\n\nCash flow\n\nPayroll\n\nProject accounting\n\nPricing: Pricing is custom. However, customers and reviewers have reported that NetSuite costs include a $999/month licensing fee and an additional $99/month for each user.\n\nXero\n\nXero is an accounting solution for everyday businesses that allows users to work smarter with intuitive invoicing software. It enables you to send online invoices from the desktop or app as soon as the job is done.\n\nThe software tracks your finances with accounting reports and allows you to collaborate with your advisor online in real time. It can also track costs and profitability with its project and job tracker software.\n\nAdditional Features:\n\nBill payment\n\nExpenses management\n\nBank connections\n\nProject management\n\nAnalytics\n\nMulti-currency\n\nReporting tools\n\nPricing:\n\nEarly: $12/month\n\nGrowing: $34/month\n\nEstablished: $65/month\n\nGoogle Sheets\n\nGoogle Sheets offers a user-friendly interface widely used beyond the FP&A or finance worlds. It works on all computers and has some great features that Excel does not offer.\n\nWhile most finance pros prefer Excel, Google Sheets makes numbers more accessible, easier to understand, and transparent.\n\nAdditional Features:\n\nReal-time editing\n\nEasy sharing\n\nComments\n\nSmart fill\n\nFormula suggestions\n\nIntegrations\n\nPricing:\n\nPersonal: Free\n\nBusiness: $12/month\n\nExcel\n\nExcel is probably the most widely known and used spreadsheet software available. This classic go-to software for FP&A and strategic finance professionals is still widely used today.\n\nExcel is not easily replaced by new software because it’s so familiar and effective. That’s why we designed Cube to be spreadsheet-native: it functions as a single source of truth for your source systems and lets you quickly push and pull data into Excel or Google Sheets.\n\nAdditional Features:\n\nWeb and mobile versions\n\nReal-time collaboration\n\nImage recognition\n\nPower BI data sources\n\nIntegrations\n\nPricing:\n\nPersonal: $6.99/month\n\nFamily: $9.99/month\n\nBusiness Basic: $6/user/month\n\nBusiness Standard: $12.50/user/month\n\nBusiness Premium: $22/user/month\n\nBusiness Apps Only: $8.25/user/month\n\nFreshBooks\n\nFreshBooks is a cloud-based accounting software platform designed for business owners and accountants.
