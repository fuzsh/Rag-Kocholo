        "text": "Have you ever thought about utilizing your ERP software to better help you manage your employees? If not, don’t be ashamed. Oftentimes, businesses invest in management software like Oracle NetSuite because they think it can simplify their tech and automate their processes — not manage their employees.\n\nBut what if it could do both? Spoiler alert: If you’re working with management software like Oracle NetSuite, it absolutely can. In fact, your ERP software can often take on the heavy load that often weighs down your HR department by automating the hiring process, managing and supporting an employee’s success and so much more. Read on to find out how.\n\nOnboarding + Offboarding\n\nThe way you onboard an employee can often set the stage for their success, so you'll want to do it right. But manually handling forms and setting up trainings and tours can easily make the entire process a bit overwhelming.\n\nThankfully, with Oracle NetSuite's SuiteApp, you can customize plans and templates while automating workflows in your hiring process to ensure you’re never second-guessing whether or not you’ve checked off all the boxes and given your new employee every chance for success.\n\nLikewise, when it’s time to say goodbye, SuiteApp has your back. By charting out the ultimate offboarding plan, you can create a template you and your staff return to time and time again to make the easiest of transitions.\n\nPerformance Management\n\nJust like you have big goals for your business, your employees have big goals for themselves. And part of managing your employees, retaining talent, and growing a positive and healthy work culture is ensuring that you're building an environment in which your employees believe they can achieve those goals.\n\nOracle NetSuite's SuitePeople HR's Performance Management does just that! With features like goal management, performance reviews, and areas of focus, SuitePeople helps your employees feel on top of and in control of their future and their success.\n\nWorkforce Management\n\nKeeping track of your workforce takes time and energy. Both of which could be directed to so many other needle-moving initiatives within your organization.\n\n​​That's why, one of the most exciting parts of using Oracle NetSuite to manage your employees can be found right in the SuitePeople Workforce Management tool. Here, you can manage shift scheduling, hours, attendance, and even calculate wages. Plus, with a mobile-app feature, you can even do it while you’re on the move! Making it 10x easier to manage and navigate last-minute requests while accommodating the needs of your team.\n\nManage Your Success\n\nYour ERP software has so many hidden talents. Talents that are all centered around making your job as “boss” easier while helping you get to your desired level of success, faster.\n\nBut if you’re unsure of how to leverage your management software to simplify your processes, manage your employees, and efficiently run your business, then reach out to the team here at Ekwani! With a team of business tech experts and certified alliance partners with Oracle NetSuite, we can bring clarity and direction to your biggest business goals."
