        "text": "NetSuite is often called the first cloud computing software company to offer web-based business applications. Initially funded by Oracle’s co-founder Larry Ellison in 1998, NetSuite evolved to become a top ERP software. Oracle acquired NetSuite in 2016, and now nearly 30,000 global use the solution for ERP, cloud-based financing, and “omnichannel commerce software” (source).\n\nHowever, as more businesses discover the advantages of cloud-based systems, many face the daunting challenges of NetSuite implementation. An often-quoted statistic from the analyst firm Gartner pins the ERP implementation failure rate at 55% – 75%. The firm has predicted that up to 80% of firms will fail to deliver a successful ERP strategy (source).\n\nTo effectively meet the challenges of a NetSuite implementation, firms may need to hire skilled consultants, project managers, administrators, and of course, developers for short and long-term positions. Sadly, the real reason for such a high failure rate of NetSuite implementations is failed recruiting efforts.\n\nNewConfig is a NetSuite Staffing Services Firm located in Montgomery County, PA. We help firms locally and globally find skilled talent to fuel NetSuite installation and implementation. We understand why most firms fail to find excellent NetSuite professionals. To learn more about our NetSuite Staffing Services, please get in touch with our offices.\n\nAnd please read below to learn more about the top NetSuite staffing challenges–and how to overcome them.\n\nHiring Professionals with Specific NetSuite Knowledge\n\nWhen implementing new ERP solutions, many firms mistakenly hire professionals with generalized ERP experience. NetSuite offers various certifications to enterprising developers, administrators, and project managers.\n\nIdeally, however, you must find a skilled professional with valid NetSuite certifications and solid real-world NetSuite implementation experience. To find the best professionals, ignore the typical hiring sites. Instead, search LinkedIn or other social media for suitable candidates or call a qualified NetSuite Staffing Services firm like NewConfig. Furthermore, having Certifications, also known as book knowledge, is helpful, but we recommend focusing on real-world experience. That can be by giving the candidates functional questions about their Netsuite knowledge. NewConfig follows this best practice to uncover the best Netsuite talent.\n\nHiring Both Permanent and Temporary Staff\n\nNetSuite implementation projects often require both permanent and temporary staff. Some businesses will enjoy a quick and easy implementation. Other companies will have to migrate data from a legacy system to NetSuite, a potentially tedious and time-consuming process that may impact every part of the company.\n\nUnderstanding who you need to hire and for how long may require a NetSuite consultant with abundant experience implementing various projects.\n\nCreating a Streamlined Hiring Process\n\nThe competition for NetSuite talent is growing, and the most skilled professionals rarely stay on the job market for too long—often only a matter of hours or days. A speedy and streamlined hiring process is the key to finding the best talent for your project. A NetSuite Staffing Services firm can source and hire talent in two days or less."
