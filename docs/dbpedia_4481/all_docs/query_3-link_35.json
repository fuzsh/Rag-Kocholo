        "text": "Utilize the Statistical Accounts feature in NetSuite’s Advanced Financial module to enable tracking non-monetary data to include in financial reporting. Users can then create Statistical Schedules which allow them to automate statistical journal entries on a schedule basis. This article will walk through the necessary steps to generate these accounts and schedules. For example, if you are looking for a way to allocate office expenditures across multiple departments using headcount – statistical account entries and dynamic allocation in NetSuite will allow you to do so.\n\nSetup/Prerequisites for Statistical Account and Dynamic Allocation Use\n\nNavigate to Setup > Company > Enable Features\n\nNavigate to the Accounting subtab\n\nUnder Advanced Features, ensure Expense Allocation, Dynamic Allocation, Statistical Accounts are checked\n\nCreate the Statistical Account\n\nNavigate to Lists > Accounting > Accounts > New\n\nGive this account a name and number\n\nSelect ‘Statistical’ in the Type field\n\nSelect the Type of unit to associate the statistical account with or create new unit type\n\nNavigate to Lists > Accounting > Units of Measure > New\n\nOn the Units Type page, enter the Type Name\n\nFor this example, I have selected Headcount since I’m working with employees\n\nIf you were to be calculating months or weeks you could create a sub-unit.\n\nEx: Unit = Weeks, primary unit = 1\n\nSubunit = Days, relation to primary unit = 7\n\nSelect all the line level fields and then Save the unit type\n\nPopulate all other mandatory fields\n\nClick Save\n\nCreate the Statistical Saved Search\n\nReference\n\nNavigate to Lists > Search > Saved Searches > New\n\nSelect the Type and name the search\n\nFor this example, I have selected an Employee search since I’m calculating Headcount\n\nNavigate to the Results subtab\n\nAdd the field ‘Internal ID’ and select ‘Count’ as the summary type\n\nAdd the field ‘Subsidiary’ and select ‘Group’ as the summary type\n\nAdd any other fields necessary to your search\n\nClick Save\n\nCreate the Statistical Schedule\n\nNavigate to Transactions > Financial > Create Statistical Schedule\n\nEnter a name for this Statistical Schedule\n\nSelect the Statistical Account previously created for this schedule\n\nSelect the Saved search previously created for this schedule and select Validate to ensure the search performs as expected\n\nFill out all other mandatory fields\n\nClick Save\n\nOnce you have completed the steps above, there will be an option to select ‘Create Journal Entry’ which allows you to view the automated statistical journal entries shown below.\n\nAs you can see, the JE allows users to see the headcount of employees broken down by department. It is important to note that Statistical accounts do not post to the General Ledger since they are non-financial."
