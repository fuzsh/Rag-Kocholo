        "text": "Using Sales Force Automation in NetSuite, you can create Sales Teams (via Setup->Sales->Sales Teams->New). From what I can gather, these appear to be a kind of Group of employees (you can list them via a saved search). You can then use them to assign an entire Sales Team to a customer (which really means assigning all of the people in that Sales Team to the customer - NetSuite doesn't keep a record of which Sales Team you assigned, just its members).\n\nWe have multiple (hundreds) of sales teams defined. One for this state, one for that state, one for this group of counties in this other state, one for that state but just for customers who are under a certain threshold of revenue, etc., etc. So we get employees who are on multiple sales teams - again, some employees are on tens or hundreds of sales teams.\n\nWhat I want to do is operate on those sales teams via a mass update or similar. For example, I want to be able to remove John Smith from all Sales Teams (I stress that by this I do not mean remove him from all customers in which he is in the sales team; I mean remove him from the defined Sales Team), or add Sue Brown to all Sales Teams involved in a specific state. Again, I stress that I don't mean to make changes to the people or sales teams assigned to customers - if I made this change, it would not change anything in relation to any customers; it would ONLY change the Sales Team itself.\n\nBut I can't even search for Sales Teams (or groups) and get the names of all the members in the search result.\n\nHow are Sales Teams structured/stored in NetSuite? Can they be operated on in this way?"
