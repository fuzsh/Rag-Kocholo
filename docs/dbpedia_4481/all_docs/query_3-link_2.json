The estimate title text appears on lists, in search and reporting results, and on the Estimates subtab of records with which it is associated.\n\nWhen an estimate is converted from an opportunity, the title from the opportunity defaults into the title field on the estimate. If there is already an estimate against the opportunity, the second estimate has a number following the title.\n\nFor example, if the first estimate title is Project Estimate, the second estimate title is Project Estimate1. For each subsequent estimate created against that opportunity, the number in the title increases by 1. This incremental increase distinguishes between multiple estimates associated to a single opportunity.\n\nThe estimate title field is also available for customization, inline edits, and mass updates."
