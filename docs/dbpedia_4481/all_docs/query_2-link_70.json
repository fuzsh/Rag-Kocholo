Don’t miss out on the opportunity to get tailored insights and answers to all your questions. Choose a convenient time for your consultation.\n\nThe Oracle NetSuite ERP Pricing Guide 2024\n\nFind the answers to all your NetSuite ERP cost, licensing and implementation questions in our comprehensive Pricing Guide for buyers.\n\nIntroducing the GURUS’ NetSuite Pricing Guide\n\nDo you want to understand how NetSuite pricing works to start budgeting your project? Although we recommend using our fast and easy NetSuite pricer (see above) to get an accurate number for your unique project, our team has assembled a comprehensive NetSuite Implementation pricing, licensing and knowledge guide.\n\nYou can read through the information and resources we’ve gathered below, based on nearly two decades of expertise in the NetSuite space.\n\nAs a 10 year running 5-Star Award NetSuite partner, our team of business development professionals, NetSuite Consultants, and NetSuite Integration specialists set the standard for best practices in the implementation, integration and customization of Oracle’s NetSuite ERP solutions.\n\nWe work with growing businesses to help scale up their corporate processes with the cloud, resulting in unmatched productivity and efficiency. How do we differentiate ourselves in the market? Simple, through a unique process which reduces risk and optimizes all your day to day business operations.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nHow Does Oracle NetSuite Pricing Work?\n\nDepending on the size and maturity of your organization, we recommend these 3 core Netsuite Solution Pricing Models to adapt to your business:\n\nThese three packages depend on your business size and your growth trajectory, with pricing models that are based on the foundation of “Suites”. Unlike the on-premise hardware-based ERPs of a bygone era, NetSuite is a flexible cloud based system. That means that if your business is a better fit for the starter, eventually upgrading to the mid-market edition or adding functionality to manage multi-nationals is as painless as it gets.\n\nIn that sense, the main difference between these 3 editions (or “suites”) is simply determined by a few criteria:\n\nNumber of employees in your organization\n\nNumber of user licenses needed\n\nNumber of legal entities\n\nOnce you’ve gone through with implementing your initial suite and your company scales, you can consult with your NetSuite partner to readjust your ERP licensing for your increased needs. All of the packages we’ll talk about in this guide share the same underlying code base and deployment model.\n\nLearn \"How Much Does NetSuite Cost?\" and everything you need to know about NetSuite's Licenses for small, medium and enterprise size businesses.\n\nWatch our short video that explains NetSuite ERP cost by business size, as well as how the pricing and licenses model works. This will give you a better idea of what to keep in mind when planning out your ERP implementation.\n\nUnderstanding NetSuite Pricing Models at a High Level\n\nNetSuite Starter Edition Pricing\n\nThe NetSuite Starter package is priced for small businesses. It’s the ideal ERP foundation for companies that operate within one country, have under 50 employees and will require 6-10 user licences. When you choose the starter package, you can also select the SuiteSuccess implementation approach, which allows for a fast set-up - NetSuite calls this the “zero to the cloud in 100 days” approach. As mentioned earlier, you will have the flexibility to seamlessly upgrade from the starter edition to more advanced packages as your company grows.\n\nNetSuite Mid Market Edition Pricing\n\nThe NetSuite Mid Market Edition is priced for businesses that require more than 10 user licences or have several legal entities. Perfectly suited for businesses that are expanding their operations across multiple locations or that have more complex requirements to adhere to their day to day processes, the mid market ERP package allows companies to execute consolidated financial reports with multiple currencies. At its core, you still get everything from the aforementioned Starter Edition, but with added customizations and scripting to suit a vaster array of needs.\n\nNetSuite Enterprise Pricing\n\nThe NetSuite Enterprise Edition is built for companies with a large scope of operations and more than 150+ users. In addition to coming with all the features and functionality of the Starter edition, the Enterprise package includes add on modules like NetSuite OneWorld for regularly handling acquisitions and the ability to manage multiple currencies and subsidiaries.\n\nNetSuite ERP Features:\n\nGL (General Ledger).\n\nAP (Accounts Payable).\n\nPurchasing.\n\nInventory.\n\nOrder Entry.\n\nAR (Accounts Receivable).\n\nExpense Reporting.\n\nAdvanced Shipping (with integrated shipping depending on your location).\n\nUse of Fulfillment Requests and Automatic Location Assignment for up to 5000 orders annually.\n\nReal-time Dashboards with key business metrics, report snapshots.\n\nNetSuite Basic Customer Support. Current URL Terms for support are located at www.netsuite.com/supportterms.\n\nNetSuite CRM Features:\n\nSales Force Automation (SFA) with quote and order management.\n\nMarketing Automation with campaigns.\n\nPartner Relationship Management.\n\nCustomer Service/Support.\n\nProductivity tools including contacts/calendar/events.\n\nHow Much Does NetSuite Cost Per User?\n\nNetSuite licenses are priced per named user and type of user. NetSuite ERP uses a SaaS model for their pricing structure to facilitate customers moving from one platform to another with minimal upfront costs. Your full pricing depends on which modules you’ll need right from the start, how many users will require a full user license, and how many users you’ll want to issue self-service user licenses to as well.\n\nA full user license is generally issued to roles that require access to specific functionalities in your ERP, such as your CFO, Controller, Director of Operations, VP of Sales, Marketing Manager, and so on.\n\nThese are the roles within your company that will be leveraging features in NetSuite on a day to day basis to access comprehensive data, build reports, and make critical business decisions.\n\nMeanwhile, a self-service user license in NetSuite is for employees who will perform limited tasks or functions in the ERP system, like time entry for projects, as well as expense tracking and/or expense reports as common examples.\n\nAt an executive level, you might ask: “How much does it cost for NetSuite users who only need to access specific reports?”\n\nNetSuite data, including saved searches and specific reports, can actually be exported from your ERP into Excel or Google Sheets for secure sharing using GURUS’ own NetSuite Data Exporter Tool for NetSuite Users. There is a free version and a paid premium version of the application, depending on your requirements.\n\nHow many entities/ companies are included in NetSuite’s base price?\n\nNetSuite's base price includes 1 company/entity.\n\nCan I get a discount on my NetSuite Licensing / Implementation?\n\nIf you’re looking to save on your NetSuite ERP implementation, you’re in luck because Oracle NetSuite offers a brick-by-brick scaling model of software. At its core, NetSuite is a financial software that functions as a very sophisticated accounting system with a strong ecosystem of add-on modules to build an infrastructure. The advantage here is that it integrates with most third party applications and legacy systems, which means that you can strip your licensing and project down to the core essentials.\n\nFor example, if you’re already running on a CRM, you don’t have to implement NetSuite’s own integrated CRM module. On the other hand, if you’re looking to completely overhaul and modernize your business processes, you can also take advantage of NetSuite’s growing ecosystem of add-ons.\n\nOracle has geared its portfolio of products and partnerships to allow its customers to easily build out an all-in-one system for everything from your Marketing to Sales, Payroll, HR, WMS and more.\n\nHow Much Does a NetSuite Implementation Cost?\n\nThis is a tricky question because no two implementation projects are the same. There are a large number of criteria that will impact the overall cost of a NetSuite ERP implementation. Based on our experience, your estimate can change significantly when we discover more requirements in the following areas:\n\nSystem integration between NetSuite and other applications\n\nHistorical data migration\n\nCustom development of functionality normally outside of an ERP System\n\nAs a best practice when discussing your implementation project with a NetSuite partner, we recommend making sure you identify all items in these areas to alleviate surprises down the road.\n\nAn experienced implementation partner will generally sit down with your team and dive into your requirements to architect a thorough project plan before the start of your project.\n\nThat being said, it is very important that you be as open as possible about specificities that are unique to your business structure, to ensure every detail is given the right amount of attention early on. This will ensure a hitchless go-live.\n\nDoes an ERP Implementation Partner Travel On-Site for the project?\n\nWe strongly recommend that the Project Manager and Lead Consultant(s) be on-site for the Planning and Architecture and Project Kick-Off for an ERP implementation.\n\nDepending on your type of business, our team will travel on-site to ensure a seamless process during your go-live as this can be a very intense period of time during any ERP project.\n\nThe remainder of the engagement takes place at GURUS Solutions’ offices. When not on-site, we use virtual meeting tools (Zoom). However, with the current global situation, an on-site visit might not be convenient depending on the timing.\n\nIn that case, our team is adept at taking on Remote implementation projects and working through digital tools to ensure as smooth a communication as possible. You can learn more about our Remote-Enablement here.\n\nCan I get a discount on your rate for the Implementation project?\n\nThe main factors affecting your rate will be the size of your implementation and the timeline for your go-live. For large implementations, we offer discounted prepaid banks of hours. We can also be more flexible if you have more time to go live, as it is easier to schedule your project activities with the availability of our team.\n\nAsk your Gurus Sales representative what options would be available for you.\n\nHow fast can a NetSuite Implementation Team start my project?\n\nWith most NeSuite partners, you can expect your project to start 2 to 4 weeks after you sign your Service Agreement.\n\nHow long will it take to go-live with a NetSuite Implementation?\n\nBased on nearly two decades of experience working with businesses across most major industries, we estimate that the average Go-live with NetSuite ranges within 90 to 120 days after the project kick-off.\n\nGURUS Implements NetSuite with our Sherpa methodology, using a phased approach and by leveraging the NetSuite SuiteSuccess modules.\n\nNetSuite Subscription Billing & Length\n\nDue to its SaaS (Software as a Service) model, Oracle NetSuite ERP is a fully subscription based platform. When you’re signing on for an implementation, you have a lot of flexibility in managing your subscription length. For example, you can subscribe on a monthly basis or yearly.\n\nHowever, if you’re implementing a new ERP system, you’re likely in it for the long run. In that case, there is a sweet spot that we recommend to NetSuite customers. Signing on for a longer term (5 years or more) subscription with NetSuite is a good way to guarantee a fixed price for the future. That means that you won’t get impacted by possible price increases when renewal periods come along.\n\nFor the sake of ensuring you get the best price protection and contract term for your needs, we recommend discussing with your NetSuite Partner.\n\nDo I need a NetSuite Sandbox?\n\nNetSuite sandbox is a testing environment that Oracle offers to its customers on a license basis. This is provided at an additional cost to your ERP license.\n\nYour sandbox will function as an identical copy of your NetSuite instance and production environment, allowing you to test new changes, scripting modifications, add-ons and upgrades before they go live. This is important if you foresee any customizations, changes or scripting being done in your instance.\n\nTo learn more about NetSuite Sandbox or to request information, check out our page or download our free data sheet.\n\nWhat is a NetSuite Partner and why work with one?\n\nThe cloud offers innovative ways to differentiate yourself in a competitive, global business environment. From a 360 degree view of the customer business experience, to a “Single Source of Truth”, and real-time access to information anywhere/anytime, cloud technology has proven success in increasing business efficiency. NetSuite’s sophisticated ERP software goes beyond that in offering a very flexible solution that molds to your business specificity and can adapt to your company growth and shifting business processes over time.\n\nYou want your core system for enterprise resource planning to be as agile as possible, because that solidifies your entire business infrastructure. In his book, “Scale Up Your Business with Cloud Technology”, GURUS Founder Martin McNicoll calls this “Future-Proofing”. If anything, the unpredictable market shifts of 2020 going forward have made the case for how crucial flexibility and agility have become in the technology market.\n\nSo where does an ERP Implementation partner come in? They are not just there to install your system for plug and play, but rather to help you optimize it and ensure it’s well adapted to your company. An ERP implementation can be like a heart transplant for most companies - choosing your NetSuite professionals is like getting to pick the heart surgeon that does your operation.\n\nPlay: Video\n\nTheir experience, knowledge and willingness to collaborate will be crucial during the process of implementing and integrating your new Cloud ERP system. Your NetSuite consultants will be able to guide your team through everything from change management to translating specific processes into powerful automations to ensure you’re getting the most bang for your buck and are set for the future.\n\nLong after implementation, the right partner will also stick around for questions, support, optimizations, scripting, training, and anything else you’ll need related to your new ERP in the future. Even more, they’ll already have a strong familiarity with your team and business, which will make any work you need as streamlined as possible.\n\nGURUS Solutions recognized the potential of cloud-based solutions in 2005 and has been ahead of the game ever since.\n\nOur dynamic team of business and technical professionals set the standard for best practices in the assessment, implementation, integration, customization and optimization of NetSuite ERP Software. We scale up business with cloud solutions for financials, CRM, Marketing, eCommerce (Shopify, Amazon) and more, which results in unmatched productivity and efficiency. Experience is everything, and when paired with proven methodologies, effective risk management, change management and a proactive approach to account management, GURUS Solutions creates value for its clients time and time again.\n\nOur Vision and How We Stand Out\n\nWe Scale Up Businesses with Cloud Solutions. Our vision is to understand your business goals, processes, people and technologies, and review possible solutions to help you focus your business efforts on future growth. We work with many organizations who spend more time working for the technologies rather than having the technology work for them, which often results in a lack of focus on their core business. We strongly believe in leveraging streamlined methodologies, processes, and cloud solutions to Scale Up Businesses!\n\nThree key differentiators of working with GURUS Solutions:\n\nDiscovery and Alignment\n\nOur clients have an opinion on the type of solution they want. It is GURUS Solutions’ mission to clearly understand all aspects of our clients’ business (strategy, objectives, etc.) in order to recommend the best approach / architecture, as well as identify limitations, risks and gaps.\n\nSherpa Methodology - Flexible Mode of Engagement:\n\nAfter discovery, assessment and architecture, we employ collaborative modes of engagement and iterative work. We make a point to ensure your involvement in every step of the project. With GURUS Solutions, you choose your level of engagement. Some clients have champions on staff and simply want training, coaching and guidelines in the implementation / integration / optimization of their solution, whereas other clients may request an all encompassing delivery, service and execution from GURUS Solutions.\n\nProactive Account Management:\n\nGURUS Solutions is dedicated to its clients long-term; we value our business relationships. Once the project takes place, we will continue to propose new ways for our clients to make the most out of their solutions.\n\nThe GURUS Approach to NetSuite Implementation\n\nWhen considering the implementation of a new technology, regardless of whether it is web-based or in-house server-based, every company will face the four elements presented in this approach:\n\nStrategic Initiative(s)\n\nYou have a strategic plan and the partner / solution you select needs to support your initiatives;\n\nTechnology\n\nYou are already considering various technologies, cloud-based or not, and you are also evaluating Gurus Solutions for software solutions such as NetSuite;\n\nProcess\n\nOver the course of the next few months, you will be asked to truly map out and question your process(es). Implementing a new technology offers the best opportunity for process improvement and realignment with best practices.\n\nChange Management\n\nPeople are key to implementing new technology however they are often resistant to change. Employees may experience concerns or fears of changing their day-to-day processes, while learning a new system. Experiencing a positive implementation and successful business transformation often relies on the deployment of a strong change management strategy focused on continuous improvement.\n\nOur Proven 5-Step Process to Implementing NetSuite\n\nGURUS Solutions uses a stage/gate process, carefully placing quality measures at the beginning and end of each phase of the engagement, to ensure that strategic initiatives, technology, processes, change management requirements, and challenges are fully addressed.\n\nDiscovery\n\nHand in hand with Netsuite, Gurus Solutions understands and evaluates your business and technologies. We want to propose solutions that truly fit your needs.\n\nDesign / Architecture\n\nArchitecture is the stepping-stone of our unique process. Our Business Analysts will review the key aspects of your business goals, current processes, systems, workflows, activities, and resources. We will evaluate your challenges, objectives, and timelines in order to clearly define your requirements while identifying constraints, risks, and gaps.\n\nScope\n\nThe details collected during the architecture provide the information required for the design of a robust proposal, tailored to your requirements. We will validate the scope with you, and make revisions to ensure all key stakeholders are in agreement.\n\nProject (Kick-Off to Post Go-Live)\n\nWe will work in close collaboration from Kick-Off through to Post Go-Live. Interactive workshops, training sessions and weekly progress reports will provide you with full project visibility and control.\n\nChange Management\n\nGURUS Solutions embraces the ‘Train the Trainer’ approach to empower your team and make sure your resources are self sufficient. We work with you to understand your needs and develop the training, documentation and/or support packages that fit your requirements.\n\nProactive Account Management, Continuous Improvement, and Optimization\n\nOnce your system is live, GURUS Solutions will be there when you need us. We will help ensure that you are leveraging the expected results. You will be assigned an account manager who will regularly review your progress, and propose solutions to continuously improve and optimize your solutions.\n\nNetSuite Modules by Industry\n\nEvery company comes with its own unique requirements when it comes to implementing a new ERP system. That’s where a heavily scalable cloud solution like NetSuite truly excels. NetSuite’s expansive ecosystem of modules, add-ons and integrations allow you to choose your license, set-up and build based on your unique needs.\n\nYou can start exploring the different modules and plan your implementation project by referencing our online selection tools.\n\nYou can also download our NetSuite Modules by Industry guide here.\n\nIndustry-Specific Solutions for NetSuite\n\nOver nearly two decades of playing in the NetSuite waters has inspired our team to engineer our own set of powerful solutions for industries that we specialize in.
