1.) Rippling

Average Customer Size: 25-300 employees

Vendor Snapshot: If youâre looking for the most advanced technology in the HR space, Rippling is a really interesting choice. Rippling can integrate with just about any of your existing tools, while drastically simplifying your onboarding, payroll and ben admin experience. A few drawbacks with Rippling are their limited functionality (limited timekeeping and no performance or learning) and the uncertainty around the platformâs scalability. Finally, Ripplingâs founding teamâs track record with Zenefits is another thing to keep in mind. See a demo of Rippling

Modules offered: HRIS, Ben Admin, Payroll, Onboarding, Time &Â Attendance, Learning, ATS, Performance, Engagement

Not included: Learming (limited)

Price range: $21-29 PEPM

2.) Paycor

Average Customer Size: 50-500 employees

Vendor Snapshot: Paycor offers a full suite of HR tools that can help manage the entire employee lifecycle from hire to retire. Like many HCM companies, Paycor began as a payroll tool, but unlike many of their peers, they also have strong capabilities in performance and recruiting too, due to their acquisitions. Their ATS is one of the strongest ATS natively available in an HRIS. Some challenges with Paycor are that their system isnât fully unified which can lead to an inconsistent user experience and delays in real-time data for reporting. Additionally, Paycor has traditionally been more of a small business solution so the product is a bit lean in some areas (such as compensation), but they are hoping to move up-market by acquiring 3rd party tools and making an investment in customer success.

Modules offered: HRIS, Ben Admin, Payroll, Onboarding, Performance, Time & Attendance, Learning, ATS

Price range: $19-26 PEPM

3.)Â Paycom

Average Customer Size: 50-750 employees

Vendor Snapshot: Paycom is one of the most integrated payroll systems . They offer a modern-feeling platform that can make end users comfortable on their own, while still being robust enough to support most HR needs. The platform can be implemented quickly and they have a strong product roadmap for the future of their platform. The biggest drawbacks with Paycom are that their integration capabilities are fairly basic and, although Paycom provides direct support, it is not always the most experienced. Additionally, their pricing is higher than most of their peers and also less predictable due to their billing model

Modules offered: HRIS, Ben Admin, Payroll, Onboarding, Performance, Time & Attendance, Learning, ATS

Price range: $24-34 PEPM

4.)Â Paylocity

Average Customer Size: 50-500 employees

Vendor Snapshot: Paylocity is a strong platform for mid-sized companies. They have become known for their strong Core HR offering, but have continued to build new functionality to layer on top of the core. Paylocity also continues to make strategic investments to become more global, more integration friendly and more user friendly. The biggest drawbacks with Paylocity are: (1) support, as their implementations have gotten very poor reviews of late and (2) admin experience, which can be choppy for users, especially when Paylocity opts to use 3rd parties for benefits and time.

Modules offered: HRIS, Ben Admin, Payroll, Onboarding, Performance, Time & Attendance, Learning, ATS

Price range: $22-32 PEPM

5.)Â UKG Ready (formerly Kronos)

Average Customer Size: 150-2,500 employees

Vendor Snapshot: UKG Ready used to be known as Kronos Workforce Ready. UKG Ready is a scalable and unified HRIS platform that works especially well for companies that have large hourly workforces, due to Kronos' historical success in Workforce Management. UKG provides their own layer of proactive and knowledgeable support on top of the product's capabilities.

Modules offered: HRIS, Ben Admin, Payroll, Onboarding, Performance, Time & Attendance, ATS

Not included: Learning

Price range: $22-29 PEPM

6.) ADP Workforce Now

Average Customer Size: 50-2,500 employees

Vendor Snapshot: ADP is one of the most well-known payroll solutions and many buyers find it to be a safe choice. ADP often does well with core HR (payroll, ben admin, and time & attendance), and they are one of the few companies that can fully outsource things like payroll & benefits. ADP, unfortunately, is known to have below average customer support. Also, due to the structure of the system, users find they donât have a great deal of control over how processes are set-up and how integrations work. This can lead users to being forced to adopt ADPâs processes and workflows.

Modules offered: HRIS, Ben Admin, Payroll, Onboarding, Performance, Time & Attendance, Learning, ATS

Price range: $19-26 PEPM

7.) PrimePay

Average Customer Size: 50-500 employees

Vendor Snapshot: PrimePay is a supportâdriven organization that can offer a support model with fewer layers and more personalization. PrimePay acquired SyncHRâs HRIS platform in 2021 and can offer a modern architecture that is flexible and open to integrations. SyncHR's technology is especially dynamic around org charts, reporting and budgeting. The platform covers the entire lifecycle, but some of the system is provided by 3rd parties, rather than being fully built internally.

Modules offered: HRIS, Ben Admin, Payroll, Onboarding, Performance, Time & Attendance, ATS

Price Range: $19-25 PEPM

8.) UKG Pro (formerly UltiPro)

Average Customer Size: 250-10,000 employees

Vendor Snapshot: UKG has a long track record of delivering smart automations to complex, global companies. They offer a robust, highly capable and reliable HCM platform that can scale with any organization's growth. Despite being a full featured system, UKGâs user interface is still accessible and intuitive for admins and employees alike. A few drawbacks with UKG are that the systemâs back-end isnât as modern as their peers and some of their modules are provided by 3rd parties. Additionally, while the merger with Kronos is going smooth, there are additional questions to be asked during evaluations to get comfortable with those changes

Modules offered: HRIS, Ben Admin, Payroll, Onboarding, Performance, Time & Attendance, Learning, ATS

Price range: $28-38 PEPM

9.) Dayforce (formerly Ceridian)

Price range: $22-31 PEPM

Modules offered: HRIS, Ben Admin, Payroll, Onboarding, Performance, Time & Attendance, Learning, ATS

10.)Â Workday

Average Customer Size: 1,000+ employees

Vendor Snapshot: Workday offers a single database solution that is configurable to any organizationâs needs and user friendly for employees. When they do acquire companies, they translate the new code into the existing code base to keep the back-end databases and front-end user experiences uniform. Workday also spends a huge sum on R&D and is on the leading edge with AI and 3rd party integrations
