NetSuite, a cloud-based ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, rose to prominence by offering businesses a unified platform for managing finances, inventory, customer relationships, and more. Acquired by Oracle in 2016, NetSuite has become a juggernaut in the Cloud-based ERP SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) space, praised for its scalability and functionality. However, beneath the surface lies a potential pitfall for businesses, especially those considering (or currently running) the seemingly cost-effective Mid-Market solution.

NetSuite's pricing structure utilizes a tiered system (based on the number of licenses you purchase), with the Mid-Market edition targeting companies under 1000 employees. This edition boasts a significantly lower price tag compared to the Enterprise version. While the feature sets are not identical, the allure of a lower upfront cost is a powerful line and sinker, the hook comes when your organization crosses the 1,000-license threshold and is forced to upgrade to their Enterprise Edition.

Imagine this: you've implemented NetSuite, integrated it with other systems, trained your staff, and just as it gains traction, your company surpasses the 1,000-employee mark. Suddenly, you're facing a potential increase of 200% to 300% of your costs to upgrade to the Enterprise edition and access the full suite of features your growing business now requires. By then, switching to a different ERP system becomes a complex and expensive proposition due to sunk costs and integration efforts, leading to a high cost of switching. That’s when NetSuite's pricing strategy might feel a bit like a "Trojan horse" - a seemingly attractive initial offer that leads to a much larger commitment down the line.

NET(net) Chief Value Officer Mike Welsh says, “NetSuite’s mid-market solution is a third of the cost of its Enterprise edition, which leads to a huge price shock when customers either cross the 1000 employee mark or require the advanced features only available in the Enterprise edition.”

Navigating the NetSuite Subscription Options:

NetSuite offers various subscription levels within each edition (Mid-Market and Enterprise) catering to different needs and user bases. Here's a simplified breakdown:

User Limits: Each tier restricts the number of users that can access the system.

Features: Higher tiers unlock more advanced functionalities within the core ERP platform.

Storage: Data storage capacity varies across tiers.

Support: The level of customer support (response times, dedicated account management) is often tied to the chosen tier.

Demystifying Service Tiers:

Adding another layer of complexity, NetSuite offers service tiers on top of the subscription levels. These tiers determine the level of disaster recovery, support response times, and access to dedicated account managers. Higher service tiers naturally come with a higher price tag.

Additional Considerations:

Industry-Specific Solutions: There are also niche players offering specialized ERP solutions tailored to specific industries like manufacturing, healthcare, or distribution. These might be a good fit if your company has unique needs.

Regional Players: Depending on your location, there might be strong regional competitors with a loyal customer base in your area.

How to Choose the Right:

Focus on finding a solution that aligns with your specific needs, not just on market share. Here are some key factors to consider:

Company Size & Growth Stage: Consider your current user base and projected growth. Does the solution scale with your needs?

Industry Requirements: Do you have industry-specific needs that require specialized functionalities?

Budget: Evaluate pricing structures, including subscription costs, per-user fees, and potential upgrade costs down the line.

Top 5 Ways to Save on NetSuite

Here are 5 ways to optimize your NetSuite costs:

Evaluate Needs: Carefully analyze your current and future business needs. Don't get swayed by features you might not require.

Right-size User Access: Ensure only authorized personnel require access to NetSuite. Streamlining user licenses can keep you within a lower-cost tier.

Optimize Storage: Implement hierarchical storage management, including data archiving strategies to avoid exceeding storage limits and incurring additional charges.

Leverage Expert Support: Work with us to price-benchmark your proposed deal and (re)negotiate your commercial arrangement and contractual agreement. Discounts are generally available for platform selection, BoM inclusions, added volume, and extended terms.

Consider Alternatives: If your needs don't perfectly align with NetSuite's offerings and/or they are unwilling to negotiate reasonably requested commercial concessions, research alternative competitive solutions that might provide a better fit at a lower cost point.

The Takeaway & Call to Action:

If you're a growing business nearing the 1,000-employee mark and currently on NetSuite's Mid-Market edition, it's time for a proactive evaluation. Analyze your future needs and explore all options, including alternative ERP solutions. Don't get locked into a potentially expensive upgrade path later. Remember, the best ERP solution is one that scales and adapts with your business, not one that forces a costly migration when you least expect it.
