Each NetSuite edition comes standard with NetSuite's ERP and CRM functionalities. Here is what's included with each of those.

(If you need capabilities beyond what's listed below, you'll need to look into additional NetSuite modules, such as financial management, inventory and order management, or eCommerce.)

How Much Does Each NetSuite Edition Cost?

Whoever you're working with for your NetSuite implementation can guide you through the NetSuite Edition that's best for you and provide some pricing information.

NetSuite Editions vs NetSuite Service Tiers

It might be a bit confusing, as there are multiple layers to NetSuite, but editions and service tiers aren't the same things. Editions refer to the core platform and number of user licenses you purchase, while service tiers dictate the more quantitative aspects of NetSuite.

NetSuite service tiers refer to the different levels of NetSuite available, making sure you only pay for what you need. Service tiers determine:

How many total NetSuite users (not licenses) you can have

How much data you can process

The amount of data storage you receive

SuiteCloud Plus licenses available

Here's a quick breakdown of the four different service tiers.
