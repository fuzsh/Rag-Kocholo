        "text": "Godzilla (1998) is a different kind of disaster for director Roland Emmerich. Toho has been making kaiju movies ever since 1954. Godzilla is a distinctly Japanese creation, but he became just as popular in America. Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, King Kong vs. Godzilla, and Godzilla 1985 were all Americanized versions that were edited with additional footage. Invasion of Astro-Monster was an American co-production, but a fully American reimagining from TriStar Pictures wasn’t approved until 1992. Which is why Godzilla was temporarily killed off in the Heisei era. Longtime Japanese cast & crew members were actually on board with a big budget American remake of their iconic monster. Little did they know how bad it would turn out. There was originally an unproduced 1994 script written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio.\n\nIt would’ve been directed by Jan de Bont with classic creature designs from Stan Winston and sounded a lot better than what they ended up with. Although that movie would’ve made Godzilla the artificial creation of Atlanteans with a Moby Dick inspired rivalry and an extraterrestrial monster. The only way to see Godzilla ’94 is as an online graphic novel. Godzilla (1998) was instead given to Independence Day director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin. It would be a dream project for most directors, but Emmerich is kind of an a-hole who wasn’t a Godzilla fan and deliberately made as many changes as possible. He threw out the original script, redesigned Godzilla, and angered actual fans in the process. My brother and I may have seen Godzilla (1998) multiple times when we were kids, but we still knew who the real Godzilla was…\n\nGodzilla (1998) is Godzilla in Name Only. A critic coined the phrase GINO since the character is nothing like the original. Toho went an extra step by referring to the monster as “Zilla” since there’s nothing god-like about this version. Since that name wasn’t created until later, I’ll refer to “Zilla” as “Godzilla” since we’re made to believe this giant lizard is Gojira. The worst thing about Godzilla (1998) is how badly they butchered his appearance. Roland Emmerich had the audacity to criticize the original upright Godzilla and wanted something more realistic. Production designer Patrick Tatopoulos turned Godzilla into an enormous bluish grey iguana with giant legs, a long tail, strong chin, and the posture of a dinosaur. The only recognizable feature are his dorsal plates. His roar is similar to the original, but something about it feels off. Godzilla’s atomic breath was nearly replaced by heavy winds, but that would’ve crossed the line. Instead Emmerich appeased fans by making “Godzilla’s” breath capable of igniting flames.\n\nCompared to the 1954 original, the only story element that they kept was his origin as a creature affected by nuclear tests. “Godzilla” is shown to be an iguana affected by radiation in French Polynesia. Of course “Godzilla” had to attack a Japanese fishing boat in the South Pacific Ocean and get his name from a Japanese myth. Rather than attack Tokyo, “Godzilla” heads for New York City. Probably the only smart decision Emmerich made was deliberately obscuring the monster in marketing. A teaser trailer where “Godzilla” steps on a T-Rex skeleton at a museum is enough to get anyone exciting. I have a hard time remembering if I saw Godzilla (1998) in theaters, but I would’ve been less than 3 years old at the time. The build up to “Godzilla” is genuinely good until we finally see all of him. This was the first time Godzilla was done entirely in CGI. Suitmation was only used for reference. I’m sure the effects were fine in the late 90’s, but they haven’t aged well. Just like the cast.\n\nAlthough I’ve gained an appreciation for the humans in Godzilla movies, the same can’t be said for this mismatched group of characters. Matthew Broderick wandered onto set as “worm guy” Dr. Nick Tatopoulos. His difficult to pronounce Greek last name came from the production designer. Nick is a biologist who studies worms affected by radiation in Chernobyl. The Government calls him in to study “Godzilla,” but his other purpose is cheesy one-liners. Glenn Morshower is unsurprisingly part of the Military, but it’s Kevin Dunn who takes action as Colonel Hicks along with Doug Savant as young soldier Sergeant O’Neal. Japan is practically substituted for France with Jean Reno as exaggerated French secret service agent Philippe who poses as an insurance agent. He keeps tabs on Nick when he travels to New York. Michael Lerner plays the candy eating Mayor Ebert who doesn’t know how to handle “Godzilla” and berates his assistant Gene. Of course the real critics had the last laugh.\n\nVicki Lewis plays a scientist who fawns over Nick, but his actual love interest is college sweetheart Audrey. Maria Pitillo earned her Razzie win as a desperate school girl who wants to be a serious reporter. There’s a truly bizarre Simpsons connection with Hank Azaria as Audrey’s bumbling cameraman friend Animal, Harry Shearer as her slimy Kent Brockman boss, and even Nancy Cartwright as his secretary. Your guess is as good as mine. Animal actively tries to get footage while his wife Lucy takes care of displaced individuals. “Godzilla” still travels by sea, but he’s a lot faster on land. Another problem was turning the King of the Monsters into an animal that’s neither good, nor bad. Emmerich is always good for citywide destruction, but “Godzilla” doesn’t cause much of a rampage. In fact, he avoids gunfire and the Military end up causing more destruction. Despite his size, “Godzilla” burrows underground, but emerges when he’s given a lot of fish to eat.\n\nOne of the dumber changes was having “Godzilla” reproduce asexually and lay over 200 eggs in Madison Square Garden. They find the nest after “Godzilla” is seemingly killed and the entire sequence feels out of place. It’s literally a rip-off of Jurassic Park with the raptor sized “Baby Godzillas” picking off soldiers one by one. You really start to feel the over 2 hour runtime. The nest is blown up, but a vengeful “Godzilla” has one last stand on the Brooklyn Bridge before being killed for good. I have no idea how I’m supposed to feel since they treat it like a tragedy and a victory at the same time. A leftover “Baby Godzilla” egg leaves the door open for a sequel, but thankfully a planned trilogy was scrapped despite moderate box-office success. The only continuation was the animated Godzilla: The Series that fans liked more than the movie. Godzilla (1998) ended up with 6 Razzie nominations, 2 wins, and a 19% on Rotten Tomatoes. America wouldn’t make another Godzilla movie for another 16 years. Godzilla (1998) is a remake that proves bigger names and effects mean nothing without respect for the source material."
