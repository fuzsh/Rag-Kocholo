        "text": "The World Premiere\n\nYes, it's true. I attended the World Premiere showing of the American Godzilla movie on Monday, May 18th. The bad news was that I got \"general seating\" tickets instead of the special \"studio\" tickets that would have let me sit up front and hobnob with the rich and famous but, as it turned out, that didn't really matter....\n\nThe fun all began when I arrived at Penn Station earlier in the day. Signs for the movie were absolutely everywhere -- on buses, on buildings and on billboards! Here are just some of the ones I saw:\n\nThat's me in the black Godzilla T-shirt, by the way....\n\nLater, I changed into my tuxedo [a very clever plan, as you will shortly see], and my date and I made our way back to Madison Square Garden:\n\nWell, we got there a bit early, but there were already huge crowds gathered near the main entrance. Police had blocked off the streets, and there were limos and cameras everywhere. There didn't seem to be any way actually in, so I told a policeman that we had tickets to the premiere and we were wondering how to get in. He took one look at my tuxedo and ushered us past the barricades. Suddenly, we found ourselves standing on the \"Green Carpet\" -- the VIP path to the main entrance!\n\nAs we walked up the green carpet, arm-in-arm, people started cheering and cameras started flashing. Video crews from dozens of countries turned our way and started filming. We were on the green carpet and all dressed up, so we had to be important, right? So, we did what anybody else would have done in the same situation -- we smiled, waved at everybody and kept on walking down that green carpet! Of course, when we finally got to the entrance and they checked our tickets, we were told that people with general seating tickets had to enter the building around the back. Fortunately, the security guards let us go around the side instead of sending us back down the carpet in shame and defeat....\n\nOnce inside, we took our seats way up in the bleachers. Security guards were checking everyone's bags to make sure that nobody brought cameras or camcorders or anything, but I was able to slip my little snapshot camera in my pants pocket and conceal it with my tuxedo jacket....\n\nThe hype inside the Garden was incredible! Approximately 12,000 people were in attendance, and the entire floor was covered with folding chairs for all the people with VIP passes. The entire Garden was festooned with posters and banners, there were green spotlights dancing around, and they showed trailers and live footage from outside on the overhead monitor. It was so intense! My only regret was simply that I was way up high away from all the famous people. And then I remembered -- I was wearing a tux!\n\nSlowly, carefully, I made my way down to the floor. One usher caught my attention, and I was sure I was going to be sent back to my seat. Instead, however, she just wanted to compliment me on my outfit. Apparently, most of the VIP's had come casual, and she was glad to see somebody in a tuxedo. Score!\n\nThe first person I recognized was Kevin Dunn, who plays Colonel Hicks in the movie. I wasn't able to get his picture, but we were able to chat for a few minutes. Real nice guy. I then saw Mohammed Ali, but was unable to get close enough for a picture. Too bad!\n\nNever fear, though! I next bumped into two extremely lovely ladies:\n\nThe woman on the right is, of course, the inimitable Arabella Field, one of the stars of Godzilla. The woman on the left is the equally inimitable Shae D'lyn, star of ABC's \"Dharma and Greg.\" I told them who I was and even gave them one of my \"Temple of Godzilla\" cards. They thought it was \"so cute!\" Aw, shucks....\n\nAn announcement was then made that it was time to head to our seats, so I started making my way back. And then, to my utter amazement, I saw one of my favorite actors, Hong Kong Cinema's number one action star, Chow Yun Fat! This was too good to pass up! I cautiously approached and told him how much of a fan I was. I then politely asked it I could take his picture. To my surprise and utter delight, he not only agreed but actually took my camera and gave it to his wife, who took the following picture [I'm the handsome guy on the left, in case you can't tell]:\n\nFive minutes before the movie started, there was a loud BOOM which reverberated throughout the garden, and a loud voice called out \"ONLY FIVE MORE MINUTES UNTIL GODZILLA!\" This was repeated at at four minute mark, the three, the two and the one. Then, the last five seconds: BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!!! All the lights went down, and a single spotlight lit the center of the floor, where the \"Let's Get Ready to RUMMMMMMBLE!\" guy [Michael Buffer, I believe] was standing with a big microphone. He then went into his spiel, saying something like \"in this corner, weighing 200 million pounds, the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, GODZILLA!!!\"\n\nThe crowd, needless to say, went wild! I mean, really wild! It was mind-numbing!\n\nWell, the movie was a lot of fun [click HERE to read my review]. There were a lot of friends and family of the the various actors and crew in the audience, and everytime someone's name was mentioned in the opening credits or made their first appearance onscreen, different sections of the audience started cheering. And everytime anything exciting happened in the movie, all 12,000 people burst into applause and cheering. I swear, this had to be the world's most enthusiastic audience! The entire experience was completely overwhelming, and it was great to see Godzilla on a really big screen!\n\nOne funny thing happened toward the end of the film. I won't give away the plot for those of you who haven't seen the movie or read my review of it yet, but there's a point toward the end where you think the movie is over. At this point, hundreds of people stood up and started making a break for the exits. Having read the script, however, I knew that there was still a lot of action to go, so I started yelling \"it's not over yet! Sit down!\" Nobody listened to me, of course, but 30 seconds later there were a bunch of people trying to find their seats again in the dark....\n\nAfter the movie ended, I decided to give the tux one more shot, so my date and I threaded our way back down to the main floor. Most of the big names at already left, but a few were still chatting. I recognized Nick Nolte right away, and politely asked if I could take his picture. His response was something like \"well, you're gonna take it anyway, so you might as well.\" Not exactly Chow Yun Fat, but at least he didn't sic his security guards on me:\n\nNote the woman on the right? Well, that's Vicki Lewis. Not only does she star in Godzilla, but she's one of my favorite TV actresses for her work on \"News Radio\". I managed to catch her a few minutes later, and told her that I thought she acted circles around her co-star, Matthew Broderick. She thought that was sooooo sweet of me to say, and then let my date take a picture of us together [and just for reference, I stand about 5' 10\" tall]:\n\nWell, that was about it. I didn't get to meet Dean Devlin, Ronald Emmerich and Matthew Broderick as I had hoped, but I still had an amazing time! Which just goes to show that you should never underestimate the power of a good tuxedo....\n\nBack to the table of contents\n\nClose This Window"
