        "text": "I admit it: When “Godzilla” was announced I was as giddy as a five-year old. After seeing the teaser for the first time, I was jumping for joy. As the movie’s release date approached, I could hardly contain myself.\n\nThen I saw “Godzilla” and a little bit of my childhood died that day.\n\nComing off the blockbuster “Independence Day,” director Roland Emmerich and writer Dean Devlin seemed like the ideal filmmakers to handle a Godzilla reboot., But instead of doing something fresh, the duo followed the timeless outlines of countless other monster/disaster movies, including “Independence Day.” It’s as if Emmerich and Devlin said “Let’s do the same stuff we did in ID4, but bigger.”\n\nThe story in “Godzilla” is a familiar one: Alarming blips start appearing on radar screens, and there are ominous attacks on ships at sea all over the world. And only one scientist figures out that nuclear tests may have spawned a giant mutant creature.\n\nThe cast is filled with stereotyped stock characters who are only there to say lines like, “I don’t understand–how could something so big just disappear?” Umm, you’re the scientists, you tell me!\n\nThe main character is Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick), an expert on the mutant earthworms of Chernobyl. Hey, now we know what Ferris Bueller has been up to! Anywho, Ferris’ big achievement is discovering that Godzilla is a female.\n\nThere is also a French military team, because apparently Godzilla is French or something. The team is led by Jean Reno, one of my favorite actor who plays this role as if he got one hell of a paycheck.\n\nOther lame characters include a wannabe TV reporter Audrey (Maria Pitillo) who used to be Ferris Bueller’s girlfriend, but dumped him to follow her career. Her friend is a gutsy cameraman (Hank Azaria), who is there to offer some comic relief. The man chasing Godzilla around the globe is Colonel Hicks (Kevin Dunn). I like Dunn’s work, but when he plays the bad guy or a tough guy, it just doesn’t work.\n\nLet’s see who else is there? Oh yes, tI forgot anchorman Charles Caiman(Harry Shearer). and Doug Savant as Sergeant O’Neal. You might remember Savant from “Melrose Place.”\n\nThe Mayor of New york named Ebert and his top aide is named Gene. One is fat and the other is skinny. If you’re old enough, you’ll get the joke.\n\nAs you can see, this cast was huge, and I didn’t mention all of them. But the problem is, none of these characters are memorable in any positive way. Unlike like in ID4, if one of these characters died, I wouldn’t care.\n\nAt the beginning of 2001’s “Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All Out Attack, ” Upon hearing about a monster attacking the East Coast of the US in 1998, a student asks, “That was Godzilla, right?” Another student responds, “The Americans say it was, but the guys over here have their doubts.” That pretty much sums up 1998’s “Godzilla.”\n\nUnlike the other Godzilla movies, this puppy takes place in New York City. There is no particular reason for this, other than to give Roland Emmerich a chance to destroy Manhattan, again. To add mood to the film, it rains all through “Godzilla,” and it mostly takes place at night. My belief is that it takes place in the dark and in the rain so we forget how idiotic the plot and the monster are.\n\nEver since his debut in 1954, Godzilla had always been handled as a myth, and aa symbol of Japanese history. But the re-imagined version by Emmerich and Devlin, was nothing more than a mutated dinosaur. The Toho pictures not only entertained audiences, but it gave them a reason to care about Godzilla. The 1998 film is more like the neighbor’s dog got loose and knocked over the trash cans.\n\nThe monster’s revamped design bears no resemblance to any Godzilla I’ve ver seen. The thick legs are gone, as are the back spines. Even the cruel, humanoid eyes which were so vital in the early films are gone.\n\nInstead of Godzilla, Roland Emmerich gave fans a second-rate Jurassic Park attraction.Once fans saw the movie, they screamed in horror, and not in a good way. “Godzilla” earned $136,314,294 domestically, this against a reported $130 million budget. Plans for two proposed sequels, were quickly scrapped.\n\n“Godzilla” is filled with too many questions that are never answered, such as: At one point Godzilla can fit inside a subway tunnel, so how is it that when the film’s heroes hide inside the Park Avenue tunnel, this tunnel is too small for Godzilla to enter? I’m no expert, but I’m guessing the Park Avenue Tunnel is larger than a subway tunnel.\n\nAlso, just how big is the monster, anyway? Sometimes it’s as a big as a high rise, but it can fit on the Brooklyn Bridge with no trouble. And how come Godzilla rarely uses his fire-breathing ability?"
