Skir,\n\nMarty Isenberg February 13, 1999 As tension threatens to break up the H.E.A.T. team for good, major problems arise: a Giant Bat is terrorizing the countryside of Nigeria, the U.S. military has dredged the Leviathan ship from the bottom of the Pacific, and worst of all, the aliens are back, with an army of mutations under their control and plans to conquer Earth. 13 Monster War: Part 2 Steven Melching February 20, 1999 From their secret base on Isle del Diablo, the aliens assemble their forces. H.E.A.T. desperately fights to resist, but are easily defeated. Once captured and brought to the aliens, they are told that the mutation army — including a brainwashed Godzilla — will be used to attack major cities across the world in preparation for a full-scale invasion of Earth.

When Audrey lets this slip on live TV, despite being told in confidence by Nick, their relationship looks set to be torn apart. Meanwhile, when called in to investigate extensive deforestation in the Amazon rain forest, they discover that a mutant termite colony is devouring the forest at an alarming rate. H.E.A.T. must find a way to destroy the voracious insects before they devour the entire rain forest. 18 Web Site Marsha Griffin May 1, 1999 H.E.A.T. is charged by the Pentagon to investigate the growing population of spiders near an Army base in the Canary Islands.

Can they stop Winter and reveal the truth before it is too late? 20 Trust No One Greg Pincus July 31, 1999 Acting on confidential information from Phillipe, H.E.A.T. investigate an abandoned lab in the Amazon rain forest where, 50 years before, French scientists succeeded in creating a creature made of pure DNA. The creature is capable of mimicking the shape of any living creature it touches and soon the team are put on edge, uncertain whom to trust. They must find a way to aid Godzilla and destroy the creature before it can reproduce and go on to create a new master race of monsters. 21 Juggernaut Tom Pugsley,\n\nGreg Klein August 14, 1999 The Techno-Sentient, an alien piece of technology, falls to Earth and begins to bond with all manner of human technology, growing to gargantuan proportions. Worst of all, it taps into the Internet and learns of the location of humanity's weapons of mass destruction. The team and Godzilla must find a way to stop the Techno-Sentient before it takes control of an arsenal of nuclear missiles.\n\n# Title Script Air Date Summary 1 Future Shock Tom Pugsley,\n\nGreg Klein September 18, 1999 While pursuing a mutant jellyfish, a mysterious storm propels the H.E.A.T. team into the year 2022. There, they discover a post-apocalyptic future where Godzilla and the other mutations are all dead, humanity is all but extinct, and the world is overrun by terrifying creatures known as Dragmas. As the team battle for survival alongside future versions of Craven and Hicks, they discover that the Dragmas was created by the scientist Johnathan Insley (voiced by Nick Jameson). After narrowly making their way back to the past, they decide to stop him before he can create the monster race. But Insley's Democratic Resurgence Against a Global Mechanized Armageddon (D.R.A.G.M.A.) project is ready to be activated, and now the team must battle to destroy Insley's work before the Dragmas are unleashed and the bleak future they saw becomes a reality. 2 Cash of the Titans Andrew Deutsch September 25, 1999 In the middle of an attack on H.E.A.T. headquarters by a giant water beetle, the team is shocked to find Godzilla is not responding to their distress call. After fending off the beetle, the team discovers that the billionaire Maximillian Speil (voiced by Clancy Brown) is hosting a monster fighting ring - with Godzilla as his new main attraction. Now with Audrey and Animal in tow, the team must save Godzilla from a brutal fight to the death against other mutations.\n\nNote: the Shrewster, a mutation from the episode \"The Twister\", makes its chronologically second appearance in this episode, but again, like the previous season's episodes with the King Cobra, it was broadcast before the aforementioned chronologically first appearance had aired.\n\n3 S.C.A.L.E. Scott Lobdell October 2, 1999 Told in a documentary style and from the point of view of cameras (either Animal's video camera or Monster Island's security cameras), the H.E.A.T team are called to Miami to deal with Skeetera, a giant mutant female mosquito, when they come under attack from S.C.A.L.E. (Servants of Creatures Arriving Late to Earth), an eco-terrorist group - led by Alexandra Springer (voiced by Linda Blair) - who believe that mutations are the next stage of evolution. After capturing the rampaging insect, H.E.A.T transports Skeetera to Monster Island so she can be studied by the U.S. military. But unknown to them, they have unwanted guests: Animal and Audrey have stowed away on board the 'Heat-Seeker' hoping for a good story and S.C.A.L.E. has tracked them to Monster Island. When the terrorists take over Monster Island with plans to release the mutations that are already held there, the only hope lies in the combined forces of Godzilla, H.E.A.T, Major Hicks and his troops, and Audrey and Animal. 4 Protector Mark Hoffmeier October 9, 1999 Archaeologists in Egypt accidentally reawaken Norrzug the Iron Lion, a gargantuan Sphinx-like monster that once served as the guardian of the ancient city of Amon-Ra. H.E.A.T. discovers from ancient texts that the people of the city deliberately rusted the creature to stop its rampage after it turned on them. Now the team must find a way to repeat the feat before this mythological terror devours every last drop of oil in the Middle East. 5 Freak Show Steve Hayes December 11, 1999 When circus ringmaster Tobias Wilson (voiced by Dorian Harewood) brings his \"Weird World of Wonders\" mutation circus to Manhattan, things go terribly wrong when a mutant sea anemone called Medusa escapes her tank and goes on the rampage. When the team discovers the creature is sucking water out of her victims, as she needs the electrolytes found in water to survive, the race is on to stop Medusa before she drains every drop of water on the planet. 6 End of the Line Steven Melching December 18, 1999 While on a romantic cruise to Alaska, Nick and Audrey's ship is attacked by a mutant turtle, but they are saved - not by Godzilla, but by Komodithrax, a mutant Komodo dragon. When Godzilla heads for Alaska to find Nick and H.E.A.T. follows, they make a shocking discovery: Godzilla and Komodithrax are in love and Godzilla has become the surrogate father to an egg laid by Komodithrax. The menacing turtle is still nearby, however, and the U.S. military is ordered to destroy all monsters in the area, leading to Nick and the team to try to protect the two gargantuan reptilian lovers. During the battle, the airstrike causes the giant turtle as well as Komodithrax and her egg to fall into a fissure. All three are presumed dead. Saddened, Godzilla retreats. Nick wants to propose marriage to Audrey, but she misunderstands. Heartbroken, Nick heads back to New York. 7 What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been Janna King Kalichman January 15, 2000 While fighting a giant mutant bacterium named the Bacillus, Godzilla is infected by it and left fighting for his life. While Elsie, Randy, and Mendel create an antibiotic to weaken the bacterium, Nick and Monique must enter Godzilla's body and destroy the infection at its source before Godzilla dies. 8 Wedding Bells Blew Steve Cuden January 22, 2000 When Elsie's estranged parents come to New York for her spoiled sister's wedding, she is forced to attend as maid of honour instead of helping H.E.A.T capture a mutant manta ray. When the military's battle with the creature ends up interrupting the wedding, Elsie is determined not only to catch the creature but also to prove to her parents that she is not the screw-up that they think she is.\n\nNote: Robert Forster voices Elsie's father: Jack Chapman and Alice Hirson voices Elsie's mother: Peg Chapman\n\n9 Metamorphosis George Melrod January 29, 2000 Shortly after receiving an anonymous check for $5 million, H.E.A.T. are called to Illinois, where a gigantic mutant chilopod, the Megapede, is devouring thousands of dollars worth of crops. The team is unable to stop the creature when they first encounter it and upon finding it again, they discover it has metamorphosed into a Giant Cicada. The insect's mating call is disrupting all radar in Chicago and now H.E.A.T must find a way to silence the creature long enough to launch a counterattack. 10 Area 51 Jeff Wynne February 5, 2000 Just as H.E.A.T has had it with Randy, Elsie convinces the rest of the team to investigate a possible mutation sighting at Area 51, where they discover the real secret of Area 51 is not aliens but mutations, created by underground nuclear testing. When one of the captive mutations - a mutant thorny devil (a species of lizard) - breaks out of its cage, the team and Godzilla must stop the creature from escaping the base and destroying nearby Las Vegas.\n\nNote: Doug Savant starred in Godzilla (1998) as Sgt. O'Neil, but he voices a different character in this episode.\n\n11 The Twister Lara Runnels,\n\nPatti Carr February 12, 2000 During a nice relaxing day at the beach, the team is caught off-guard by a twister. They trace its origins to an experimental energy experiment at a local power plant, as well as discovering strange tracks near the plant. When the twister strikes again, H.E.A.T. discovers that a giant mutant shrew has been bonded to the twister, creating a \"Shrewster\", and now the race is on to defeat it before its ravenous metabolism drives it to eat everything in New York. The Shrewster scratches and pierces Godzilla's skin using its claws and bites his neck, but Godzilla recovers and defeats it. 12 Shafted Robin Russin February 19, 2000 On their way to an expo in an attempt to win a research patent, the team meets a lost young girl named Meg (voiced by Mae Whitman). She asks the team to rescue her two brothers Steven (voiced by Mikey Kelley) and Kevin (voiced by Robbie Rist), who went into a silver mine where a gang of miners disappeared without trace fifty years before. While Monique is left babysitting Meg (much to her displeasure), the rest of the team encounters the Silver Hydra: a monster capable of encasing anyone unfortunate enough to meet it in silver and able to regenerate itself every time it is harmed. Now the race is on to defeat the Hydra before Kevin, Steven, Elsie, and Godzilla end up as lifeless silver statues. 13 Where Is Thy Sting? William Stout February 26, 2000 While tracking Godzilla to Fort Armstrong, New Mexico, the team discovers that a gigantic mutant scorpion, called Ts-eh-go by the locals, is on the rampage. But when they try to contain the mutation, they come under fire from the U.S. military under the command of Colonel William Tarrington (voiced by Michael Chiklis), an old friend of Hicks, who is out to destroy both Ts-eh-go and Godzilla. When H.E.A.T discover Ts-eh-go was created by the army's \"First Wave\" program, and that Tarrington is planning to use the creature's offspring - codenamed the \"Second Wave\" - as bioweapons, H.E.A.T and Hicks must convince Tarrington to abort the mission when the scorpions get out of control. Godzilla protects Major Hicks and Colonel Tarrington by stepping in front of them and being sprayed with the scorpion's acid. Tarrington then orders Godzilla to be killed and Hicks is aghast, pointing out that Godzilla took a hit for him. 14 Lizard Season Robert N. Skir March 11, 2000 Cameron Winter springs Dale, Bill, and Hank, the redneck hunters from \"Cat And Mouse\", from jail and uses them to pilot the \"Lizard Slayers\": three extremely well-armed battle mechas (a giant robot, a tank, and a jet plane) programmed with one mission: to destroy Godzilla. When Cameron takes control of H.E.A.T.'s computer systems to stop them from intervening, Nick and the others must get rid of Cameron, then find a way to save Godzilla from the three hunters. 15 Vision Carl Ellsworth March 18, 2000 The team are called to San Francisco, where a flock of giant mutant hummingbirds are attacking aircraft. The creatures move too fast for the naked eye to see them, making them impossible for Godzilla to fight them. Now Craven must rig up a special set of goggles that will allow Godzilla to see the birds, giving him a chance to fight back. 16 Underground Movement Marsha Griffin April 1, 2000 The team is split up due to a lawsuit by the city of Miami (over damages caused by a giant mutant vampire bat). While Nick, Monique, and Elsie deal with the lawsuit, Randy and Craven decide to deal with a mutation (without Nick's permission) in Michigan. The mutation in question is Armillaria, a giant fungus with the ability to suck the amino acids out of any living thing. It swiftly proves too much for the duo, who end up trapped in the wilderness with nothing but their wits and the clothes on their backs. Once the others hear of their antics, the race is on to rescue the duo and defeat Armillaria before it sucks Godzilla dry. 17 Ring of Fire Rodney Gibbs April 22, 2000 The FireFly, a strange creature made of living flame, attacks an oil platform in New Mexico. When H.E.A.T. and Godzilla arrive to stop it, Randy and Craven sense a chance to make a lot of money if they can exploit the monster's ability to regenerate energy. Once H.E.A.T has taken the creature out, Randy and Mendel sneak it back to headquarters for study, but things go terribly wrong when the FireFly regains consciousness and starts burning down everything in its path. 18 The Ballad of Gens Du Marais Angel Dean Lopez unaired While in New Orleans covering Mardi Gras, Audrey hears rumours of a strange \"Swamp Beast\" and decides to call in H.E.A.T.. The creature swiftly proves itself a match for Godzilla and the team begin to suspect something is afoot when the locals claim the beast is the swamp's revenge against a corrupt local politician, Paul Dimanche (voiced by Jesse Corti), who wants to mine oil in the bayou. But can they prove it before the Swamp Beast destroys New Orleans?\n\nNote: This episode did not air, but it was shown at the 2001 Asian Fantasy Film Expo in New Jersey.\n\n19 Tourist Trap Marty Isenberg unaired The Deep-Dweller, a huge mutant frogfish, begins to attack boats and fishing ships off the coast of New Jersey. H.E.A.T. must help Godzilla drive the creature back to deeper waters and also deal with the interference of the sleazy and obnoxious tour promoter Milo Sanders (voiced by Stuart Pankin), who runs a mutation boat tour called the Manhattan Mutant Line and hopes to make even more money by getting good footage of Godzilla.\n\nNote: This episode did not air, but it was shown at the 2001 Asian Fantasy Film Expo in New Jersey."
