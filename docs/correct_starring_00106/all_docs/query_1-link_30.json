        "text": "Even today, Godzilla remains a cultural icon present in mainstream media. There have been countless media that has addressing the bomb, such as John Hersey’s Hiroshima articles or even films like the aforementioned Children of Hiroshima. While these certainly hold relevance in some facet today, Godzilla himself remains the biggest symbol of Hiroshima in American culture. The December 7th attack on Pearl Harbor is frequently touted as a day of remembrance for the 2,300 dead, even appearing on American calendars. But most Americans probably don’t even know the date of the Hiroshima & Nagasaki bombings, nor would recognize the over 200,000 dead as anything but a necessary sacrifice of war.\n\nThis may seem callous, but the truth is that even as opinions have delicately shifted over decades, data shows that in 2015 more than half of Americans still felt the bombings were justified. While that may seem like a significant shift from the 85% approval in 1945, taking a moment to assess what that is truly saying makes 56% approval still seem way too high. To put it simply:\n\nMore than half of Americans believe killing more than 200,000 people, obliterating two cities beyond repair, and that using weapons of mass destruction on civilians was justified.\n\nPart 2: The Beginning or the End\n\nEven before Godzilla or Children of Hiroshima were conceived, America was already in full force justifying the use of the bomb, evidenced by public opinion. “Necessary to end the war” was and is the phrase thrown around.\n\nHollywood more than played its role in releasing propaganda both during and after the war to sway public opinion as well as it could. 1943’s Mission to Moscow, went out of its way to present Stalin in a positive light to make Americans feel good about being on the side of the dictator as cruel, if not crueler, as their enemies. First Yank into Tokyo was another soldier film from 1945, and notably the first feature to reference the atomic bombs. In every other aspect, it is run of the mill. In terms of Hiroshima, the ultimate example of pro-American propaganda is 1947’s The Beginning or the End.\n\nThe Beginning or the End is a remnant of the pro-bomb propaganda that seeped its way into all corners of American culture in the late 40’s. I was introduced to the movie by Greg Mitchell’s book The Beginning or the End: How Hollywood and America Learnt to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. The book covers the insane story of how this movie ended up being made. To put it incredibly simply, it is a Hollywood story that had a small chance to be a realistic story of the Manhattan Project, but ended up being a government propaganda piece after interference from government officials, key among them being President Truman and General Leslie R. Groves.\n\nMy point in discussing this film is not to claim it is an iconographic film that had any sway on modern opinion, nor that it even had any effect on those in 1947. In fact, it lost somewhere around 1.5 million dollars in the box office (somewhere around 20 million today). It was an utter failure. With that said, the lies and bomb-worship it propagates are symbolic of America’s continued ability to ignore the real damage we caused with the A-bomb.\n\nIf the supposed idea of this movie is that it tells the true story of the making of the Atomic bomb, it is a complete failure. The science in the film is meaningless jargon, and yet fills at least half an hour of dialogue. Shoehorned on top of that is an emotionless love story between two scientists and their brides-to-be.\n\nPerhaps the first step in ruining The Beginning Or The End’s chance at holding any truth happened in pre-production. Prior to 1950, real persons appearing in films had to agree to their fictionalized appearance. Lise Meitner (Austria), Niels Bohr (Denmark) and Sir James Chadwick (United Kingdom) all refused to appear in this film despite their work on the bomb. Samuel Marx, lead producer, lamented how the film ended up an “All-American Affair”.\n\nThe politics of the film itself are riddled with lies thanks to Truman and Groves’ interference:\n\nThis scene captures all of the lies of this film encapsulated into one moment; Truman debating whether to use the bomb on Hiroshima. What makes this scene most bizarre is that it is complete fiction. Truman and Groves had no reservations about dropping the bomb. In fact, when the US “Secretary of War Stimson struck Kyoto off the target list for the first atomic mission, Groves repeatedly tried to get him to change his mind”. It seems he was aiming to murder as many Japanese civilians as possible. What’s most amazing about this scene is that this is the final product which supposedly captured enough “empathy” to please Truman (he demanded reshoots until he was satisfied with the scene). Watching that scene I just see a president saying out loud the justification for killing the hundreds of thousands he had already decided he was going through with. If that was his perception of empathy, I fear what the real conversations between him and Groves could have been.\n\nIf you managed to stomach through that entire sequence, you may have noticed Truman mentioning the “leaflets” to be dropped over the city warning civilians of the bomb. This may not only be the most atrocious lie in this movie, but it is one of those remnants of the 40’s that has somehow made it into even modern education of WWII. This lie rears itself again later in the film before the dropping of the bomb.\n\nAs this soldier says in The Beginning or The End, we supposedly dropped leaflets over Hiroshima for 10 days; which he proudly touts is “10 more than they gave us for Pearl Harbor”. This is a blatant and disastrous lie.\n\nHarrison Browns review from 1947 after the movies premiere covers exactly how awful this lie is better than I could:\n\nEven if Hiroshima were one of the cities that received plenty of these leaflets, it doesn’t make it much better. Where were citizens meant to go if all the cities were receiving threats? Even if they left, is the destruction of their homes justifiable? If you receive a note that tells you you’re going to be killed in an act of terrorism next Friday, does that make your death on that day more manageable somehow?\n\nAll these lies culminate into this pro-bomb piece devolving into a fictitious piece of military promo. It is even worse when you consider some of Groves’ strange requests. The man insisted the model of the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the bomb, be as close as possible to the original. He made similar requests on the pilots uniforms. Somehow, he didn’t find a problem with the Enola Gay being fired at by Japanese gunshots on its journey. This, of course, did not happen, as the attack was a complete surprise and Hiroshima was not a military city.\n\nPart 3: Acknowledging a Bomb\n\nWhere the original 1954 Godzilla prevails is in its ability to tell a story that metaphorically and without blame poses all the correct questions about humanity and its creation of the atomic bomb. Reiterating here that the film does not once mention America, Hiroshima, or Nagasaki by name even once feels important. In fact, one scene early on features two civilians discussing the news of Godzilla’s appearance. The woman actually says “How could we create such a thing?”. While the U.S. responded to Hiroshima’s with a bunch of lies, Godzilla is a fiction that elevates questions the bomb created.\n\nThis inclusive language is what makes the questions and answers revolving around Godzilla so important. When it is discovered that Godzilla was woken up by WMD’s, the politicians discuss how much of this information to make public. The scientist Serizawa who eventually destroys Godzilla regrets that he will have to use an equally destructive weapon to do so. Throughout the entire film, Godzilla’s origin is omnipresent. Therefore, Hiroshima is an omnipresent force without ever shoving it in the audience’s face. The questions and answers extend to humanity.\n\nThis is also where the 1998 Godzilla immediately fails. In fact, the only allusion to the United States use of the atomic bomb exists in the 3-minute opening sequence. In these credits, a montage of atomic weaponry testing in French Polynesia with flashes of a lizard shares screen time with the opening credits. Of course, we assume this lizard is the creature who will eventually be mutated into Godzilla himself. We are then brought to Godzilla’s first attack in the South Pacific Ocean on a crew of fishermen.\n\nGeographically, this is a disastrous read of the original film. The monster in the 1954 film represents what happens when WMD’s are used on man, and Godzilla himself is but one of the consequences. Having Godzilla be the result of testing misses the mark here, but it is plausible a new take on the metaphor.\n\nIt is then that we’re introduced to Dr. Nick Tatopoulos, apparently the only scientist who has been studying the effect that the Chernobyl explosion had on worms in the area. The military recruits Dr. Nick as his work is vital in this case. At this point, there is actually a semi-promising reimagining of the Godzilla metaphor being presented. The ’54 film explored the consequences of the first usage of atomic weaponry. It is reasonable that a ’98 version would explore how these weapons have become a commonplace testing tool for first-world militaries and the effects that would have on populations/planets. In fact, placing the film in America would make some sense in this case as we were the kings of dropping bombs even just for tests.\n\nThe problem is that this metaphor dies incredibly quickly. Within 30 minutes of the film, Dr. Nick deduces that the creature is a result of radiation mutations. The issue is then completely dropped. The tone of the movie was already an odd mix of monster suspense with weird military action-comedy at this point, but it really delves deep into the latter here. The remainder of the movie feels like Jurassic Park but leans far too heavily into both the action and the comedy. There is no more mention of Godzilla’s origin, nor does it have any resonance.\n\nIn the ’54 film, Godzilla’s origin defines him. Here, his origin is completely abandoned once its discovered. Instead, Dr. Nick’s begins focusing entirely on Godzilla’s need to nest? And apparently New York City was the place he went to do this. It is a blatant shoehorn of a location where the monster doesn’t belong.\n\nOn top of all of this, Nick’s former lover who desperately wants to be a reporter also manages to find herself in New York at the time. Much of the movie ends up focusing on her and her rag-tag cameraman friend as they try to get the scoop on Godzilla. Then there is the small subplot of the caricatured NYC mayor character quarreling with the military. My favorite character, however, is the French secret service agent who, for some unexplained reason, is there to stop Godzilla’s babies. This nonsense floods the movie so much and reeks of Hollywood intrusion that if there was ever meant to be a message in this film, it was washed away quickly.\n\nEven though some of the comedic moments are admittedly funny in a standalone context, and perhaps even funnier when you consider they’re supposed to be part of a Godzilla movie, they are so overblown they take screen time away from Godzilla’s presence.\n\nMy core criticism of the 1998 Godzilla moving forward is its total ignorance to offer any valuable discussion about WMD’s. Obviously, there is an obvious caveat in terms of the character’s history. Godzilla has appeared in multiple movies at this point, many of which have completely omitted his being as a symbol for WMD’s. There do exist interesting arguments that the second film Godzilla Raids Again can represent the randomness of Nagasaki, and I could accept those. The 1995 Godzilla Vs. Destroyah has a monster, Destroyah, created as a side effect of the Oxygen Destroyer’s usage on Godzilla in the ’54 film. That movie raises its own wonderful questions about how even when used for supposed “good” there are certain autonomous barriers meant not to be broken in terms of science. But I digress as none of this matters at all for three reasons.\n\nFirst, Godzilla is a Japanese creation. I think it’s fair to deem it up to Japan and its filmmakers how to progress the character. Many of the movies do propose interesting themes, and many are just corny monster movies. But it’s up to them what to do with him.\n\nSecond, these movies do not attempt to rewrite the story of Godzilla’s origin as the American ones do. They are all a continuation of the 1954 story. Even if many are two men in monster suits fighting and pounding their chests, they all stem from the original. I’m sure there may be a Japanese film scholar who believes every movie after the original is a degradation of the symbol, and I greatly respect that argument. But it is not mine to make.\n\nMost importantly, these sequels are NOT created by Americans, the people who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, in an attempt to rewrite the story of the creature who represents the greatest single destruction of civilians in modern history.\n\nThe tone of the film really ends up feeling like an episode of Law & Order with Godzilla as the guest star. It’s such a stark contrast to any of the Japanese films and it really doesn’t even make sense in the context of itself. There’s a certain ridiculousness to those scenes that really are just action-comedy when you consider Godzilla’s existence. Here’s a small montage of some of my favorite moments:\n\nThere isn’t any sarcasm to those being my favorite moments either. The truth is, this really isn’t a Godzilla movie. The plot ends up focusing on Dr. Nick, his reporter girlfriend, the ‘New Yawk’ Cameraman, and a French secret service agent uncovering Godzilla’s hatchlings. Godzilla himself falls to the background and is used as a trope. These small moments where the movie accepts that it isn’t serious are more entertaining than the actual plot.\n\nPart 4: Military, Politics & Citizens\n\nWatching any of these scenes one is bound to notice how plastered the military is across the entire movie. However, this alone is not where criticism should come from for the ’98 movie. The ’54 Godzilla itself includes plenty of military intervention as well. This is not inherently wrong for a Godzilla movie. In fact, it would be ridiculous to have Godzilla invade a city and not have the military attempt to interfere.\n\nThe other standout character here was probably the bumbling mayor of New York City. His idiocy, humor, and incompetence appears throughout the movie. Again though, this is not out of the realm of reality for a Godzilla movie. The original again includes a particularly memorable scene of Japanese politicians debating how much of their knowledge of Godzilla should be made public to their citizens and the world’s politicians.\n\nThe presentation of citizens’ response to Godzilla is also somewhat similar to the original. In the original film, the audience is shown occasional glimpses of citizens responding to the monster. There is the aforementioned example of the woman on the train, as well as multiple scenes where hordes of regular Japanese citizens attempt to escape from him as he terrorizes an island or city. In the ’98 Godzilla, we get plenty of scenes of “regular” New Yorkers bracing for the attack on their city. Scenes of diners crowded with those who took refuge, as well as later ones in apartments flooded with people watching TV hoping their city is saved.\n\nAt their core, both of the films use these groups to perform the same function. Unfortunately, the ’98’s presentation of the military, the politicians, and the citizens is completely misguided.\n\nTonally, the ’98 film is obviously a mess in this regard. Simply, it’s an action-comedy adventure movie with all of the horrible trappings of one. Nothing is inherently wrong with the genre, but dropping Godzilla dead-center in the middle of it leads to him feeling out of place. The military is full of Ben Affleck-types figuring out the most badass way to kill the monster, the mayor of NYC is an overused joke, and the citizens are only used as a vessel to lead a love interest to Dr. Nick. Neither the militaristic, political, or citizen-based response ever indicates the gravity of the situation.\n\nOne of the most notable differences between the original and the ’98 is whether the military ultimately fails. In the original, ten frigate ships, the electric fence, and the tanks all fail to do anything but aggregate Godzilla further and cause more damage than he may have otherwise. There are plenty of similar moments in the ’98 Godzilla, where a trigger-happy sergeant tells his men to fire when Godzilla is simply sniffing around the area. Attempts to kill the monster continuously fail throughout the movie. The difference is that despite their failures, the American military ends up succeeding. Dr. Nick and his gang manage to lead Godzilla to the Brooklyn Bridge, where he gets trapped in the cables, allowing the Air Force Jets to successfully open fire and kill him. Having Godzilla be killed solely by the military misses the message of what the beast is. He is meant to be a symbol of the atomic bomb, the greatest power that man ever created. Even greater than their armies. He should not be able to be killed by typical human weapons. It’s like it was such an obsession to make sure there was a scene where the military could hug each other in self praise that the gravity of the monster was completely lost. On top of that, what message does that send about the usage of radiation, nuclear power, and atomic weaponry? Even if we choose to completely ignore all the messaging from the original Godzilla, Dr. Nick made it very clear that Godzilla was a result of radiation. Is the message that no matter what we create, we will always find a way to destroy it and continue pushing our planet’s boundaries? In the context of the film, none of these questions come up at all of course. But when you consider Godzilla as a character, it’s a travesty not to raise these questions. Godzilla’s origin is a critique of the militarization of science, not a simple beast that needs to be destroyed. A Godzilla movie is meant to have more losers than winners, as he himself is a punishment on humanity.\n\nThere isn’t much to say about the politicians of the movie that isn’t true for the military. I suppose there is some merit in making the primary politician a self-centered buffoon, but then shouldn’t he eventually receive punishment? The mayor simply gets to celebrate with the military and figure out how he will use this to push his next campaign. It’s a fine joke, but the universe of the film encourages his stupidity. In the original, we see their bickering, but they disappear once the point has been made that they are pointless.\n\nThe presentation of citizens feels mundane to critique, but there is merit to it. In the ’54, the audience is shown multiple perspectives of citizens. There is a scene of an old man who has heard legends of Godzilla, a scene of city urbanites casually expressing their concern, and scenes of villagers experiencing the real effects of the monster’s attack. However, none of these random citizens are shoehorned into becoming main characters. When their struggles are shown, it expands the audience’s knowledge of Godzilla, and then the movie continues. In the ’98 movie, every citizen-based scene revolves around Audrey Timmonds, Dr. Nick’s ex-girlfriend. Any of the gravitas the scenes focusing on citizens should have carried is destroyed, as it’s all done for the purpose of getting Audrey to Dr. Nick.\n\nIn the original Godzilla, the military, the politicians, and the citizens all take a backseat when they are not needed. In the ’98 American version, everything has to be connected and kept throughout the entire film. One of the very last scenes montages through our cast of characters celebrating Godzilla’s defeat.\n\nWhat culminates from all these misconstrued attempts to recreate a Godzilla movie is a 2-hour-long desecration of a film icon. Worse, it manages to have the same obsessively pro-military mise-en-scene as in The Beginning or The End.\n\nOne of the core reasons the ’98 fails is that it’s leading man, Dr. Nick Totopoulous, doesn’t hold a prayer compared to Dr. Daisuke Serizawa from the original.\n\nPart 5: Dr. Serizawa and the Oxygen Destroyer; Dr. Nick & nothing\n\nDr. Serizawa and Dr. Nick are two characters who hold similarities that only highlight where the latter film fails. Both are presumably great scientists who seem to have a deeper understanding of Godzilla than those around them. They both play the key role in defeating Godzilla.\n\nDr. Serizawa might be a perfect character. The only character in the original Godzilla as important as the monster himself, everything about him is masterfully developed. His eyepatch is the assumed result of the war, connecting him to Godzilla’s origin at a base level. This connection drives them together even more throughout the film. It is revealed that Serizawa has developed an Oxygen Destroyer, presumably the only device that could defeat Godzilla. The machine eliminates all oxygen nearby, instantly killing all life forms.\n\nThe Oxygen Destroyer is the perfect storytelling device for both Godzilla and Serizawa. It is a weapon with potentially untapped power to take away not only animal, but also human life. Initially, Serizawa’s response is an absolute refusal to use the Oxygen Destroyer on Godzilla, citing politicians and armies using it for their own good. Not only that, he fears the implications it could have for mankind to release another weapon of this magnitude onto the Earth. It is amazing that Serizawa had more reservations about using a weapon to destroy a fictional dinosaur than Truman was able to come up with for having killed thousands of people in The Beginning or The End. There is a wonderful irony in the fact that Truman’s scene was historical fiction meant to create empathy, but a man with an eyepatch using an “oxygen destroyer” manages to do it tenfold.\n\nThen there is Dr. Nick. While I personally adore Matthew Broderick, Dr. Nick is just a basic and boring man. Presumably, he is supposed to be the mirror to Serizawa for a modern day American Godzilla. He does recognize Godzilla’s origin, but the similarities end about there. After some minor exposition about Godzilla’s radioactive origins, he immediately moves onto how Godzilla is “nesting”. When he continuously brings this up to the military and politicians, he is eventually kicked out for going against their narrative. Amazingly, there is actually almost a good point in here about these bodies refusing to listen to scientists providing them answers. Especially considering his character was studying at Chernobyl, it would have been so easy to extend this metaphor to the general consequences of these entities pushing man against the will of the planet. Instead, any signal of this metaphor is immediately dropped, as Dr. Nick ends up underground in the subway with his ex-girlfriend fighting Godzilla’s hatchlings. There is a randomness to the ’98 movie, and any time it’s about to make a point a new distracting car chase, military squad, or flat joke interrupt.\n\nThe worst part of Dr. Nick is that he doesn’t have an equivalent to the Oxygen Destroyer. The Oxygen Destroyer is what gives Serizawa his weight as a character. It is what allows the Japanese military to fail without a message of complete hopelessness. It also reiterates Godzilla’s position as a power beyond what man can or should handle. As Dr. Nick has no weapon that could take out Godzilla, he remains at the whim of the military, the only source of brute power in the film. Along with that, it completely ruins any of the potential meaning gained from him being dismissed from his team of military and politicians. In the end, he relies on and works with them.\n\nSecondly, Dr. Nick not having an Oxygen Destroyer equivalent means he has no decision to make. The original Godzilla is flooded with debates about whether Godzilla even should be killed. After all, he is a punishment for man’s power thirst and a being of nature. He occupied the Earth peacefully before human disturbance. Serizawa must recognize that using the Oxygen Destroyer, and him having created it in the first place, is a continuation of the sin that brought them to this moment. Dr. Nick has no inner battle. The only mirror between him and the monster is when Dr. Nick frowns as he watches him die on the bridge.\n\nObviously, any monster film will ultimately side with the humans who need to defeat the monster in order to continue society. But joining in with the military and politicians to do so misses that Godzilla is a creation of these very people. Dr. Serizawa is an outsider who knows the war and the bomb were bad, where Dr. Nick seems like a blind beagle following orders throughout the film. Even when he is discharged by his military friends, he is immediately picked up by the French Secret Service to carry out the same mission he was already pursuing; defeating Godzilla!\n\nThe two Godzilla movies are similar at their core, but separate at any critical thematic moment that by the end they’re not even the same genre. The ending scenes for the monster himself highlight the distant paths these movies take from each other. First, here is the 1998 Godzilla scene where he is defeated.\n\nHaving finally agreed to go down with his Oxygen Destroyer, Serizawa and his partner Ogata submerge themselves down to Godzilla underwater. It is expected that both will return, but Serizawa knows he is not coming back up. He brings down with him not only the Oxygen Destroyer, but also all of his knowledge of the device. Serizawa and Godzilla, both products of war, destroy themselves with a weapon equal in scale to the one that created them. Serizawa’s sacrifice embodies an answer about the atomic bomb to questions that most Americans still haven’t asked. Weapons of this sort are beyond monstrous, and they are bound the create more monsters than they defeat. There are real lives impacted.\n\nAs Ogata emerges from the water, the movie closes with Emiko’s loss of her friend Serizawa. The film does not end with celebration, but an acknowledgement of loss and of understanding. Loss of Serizawa and an understanding that all of this was an unnecessary creation by man.\n\nPart 6: Back to the Bomb\n\nThe odd truth of the 1998 movie is that the more you delve into and analyze it, the less you talk about Hiroshima. While The Beginning or the End was propaganda in its rawest form, the 1998 Godzilla is what happens when 50 years later there is no need for propaganda anymore.\n\nWe are now 75 years from the event, and American opinion still rides in favor of the bomb. Most Americans believe and are taught the lies about leaflets, the bombs necessity to end the war, and that it was inevitable in the tumultuous war. August 6th is not a day of remembrance. The 130,000 dead are another meaningless statistic, as opposed to groups of real civilians, with real lives suddenly and permanently interrupted.\n\nAfter Serizawa’s death, Godzilla ends with his friend and leading lady Emiko sobbing aboard the ship he was supposed to come back to. After doing all of this research and attempting to envelop myself in the history of the bomb, her tears began to hit me on a more emotional level. In the moment of the movie, she is indeed sobbing alone for Serizawa. As I watched it this time, she was representing the tears of a country that were never appropriately wept across the world. After the bombing, the war went on, and when it ended, regime change led by the U.S. happened quickly. History was written to have the United States as the hero who ended the terrible war. Clichéd, but the 1954 Godzilla doesn’t provide a happy ending because there was no happy ending in Japan.\n\nWhen the 1954 film became the massive hit it was and was sent over the United States, the script was heavily edited down to include less references to atomic weaponry, the bomb, and anything that could be assumed as criticism of the U.S. I find this so odd, as the original script is so fair and metaphorical in this regard already. Bomb erasure is commonplace in America though, which is why the 1998 Godzilla is such a grossly perfect vessel for it. It is typical of a Hollywood feature to take an idea that is based on America’s own crime and rinse it into something so vacuous as that movie.\n\nWith all of that said, I don’t think anyone making the 1998 Godzilla had these malicious intents I seem to be prescribing them. I don’t think Roland Emmerich directed it in such a way as to lead the movie away from any meaning about WMD’s. I don’t think Matthew Broderick realized his character was a horrible whitewash of a scientist who symbolized the horror of war. Even the over-flooding of the military, while certainly blatant, was not done maliciously. The truth of Hollywood and reboots is that they fall upon the simple cultural touchstone and not the message of that touchstone. The movie recreates Godzilla in a physical form, but recreates absolutely nothing else from the original. The result, evidently, is that without his nuclear gravitas, Godzilla can’t hold the movie up on his own. The real crime here is the convenience of it all. None of this was given a second thought beyond selling the new monster as a product. It is much more convenient to ignore that Hiroshima ever happened and create another pointless movie than acknowledge it and recreate the message.\n\nThere isn’t really much less to say other than a reminder once more that the 130,000 people killed in Hiroshima on August 6th, 1945, were all real people. They woke up one morning and then didn’t the next for no real reason. The same is true for the 30,000 more three days later in Nagasaki. I grew up assuming this was OK, but it’s not and it’s an absurd assumption. The 1954 Godzilla happens to be one of the metaphors that helped me look deeper into this. It is wrong of the American version to take the metaphor and toss it away. If anything I’ve written here has changed any of your thinking about the bombs, please consider donating to the Hiroshima Peace Culture Foundation, a local charity, or a bail fund in your area."
