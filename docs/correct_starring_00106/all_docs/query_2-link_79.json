Doug \"Autistic\" Savant.\n\nThe Nutshell\n\nHere’s\n\nthe thing about Roland Emmerich’s Godzilla. It’s not that good.\n\nSpeaking of not good, my 1998 CHUD.com review of the film:\n\n“This\n\nfilm has been ripped apart by critics across the country, the unfortunate fact\n\nsince the film has a higher profile than God right now. Everything regarding\n\nthe film is magnified due to its \"event\" status, both the good stuff\n\nand the bad stuff. I’ll take a different perspective, and keep it low key and\n\nsmall.\n\nGodzilla\n\nDirected\n\nBy Roland (Universal Soldier, Stargate, Independence Day) Emmerich.\n\nStarring\n\nMatthew \"I’ve got no talent but get to sleep with Sarah Jessica\n\nParker\" Broderick, Hank \"I get to sleep with Helen Hunt and I have\n\ntalent\" Azaria, Jean \"I’m French, so I sleep with everyone\"\n\nReno, Harry \"Are we going to do Stonehenge tonight?\" Shearer.\n\nThis film\n\nhas been heavily promoted since Princess Di was a tea drinker, and its ad\n\ncampaign about Size Mattering has helped keep Jeff Stryker in business.\n\nEveryone has seen at least one Godzilla film, and they have accepted the poor\n\nacting, dialogue, special effects, and production values. This film, while of a\n\nhuge budget, revels in its FX but I’ll be damned if the story isn’t the same\n\nkind of tacky we’ve grown to accept. The plot is this: Nuclear tests cause side\n\neffects and an iguana grows mighty! It goes to New York to do his deed. We fight him. The\n\ndoor is left open for a sequel.\n\nThe Bad: Story is pretty lame, acting is\n\nmoderate at best, and the film is derivative of the Jurassic films with a\n\nlittle bit of Gremlins in for extra measure.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe FX are colossal. Godzilla as a creation and as a character is the most\n\nthree dimensional one in the film, funny considering he’s a series of pixels.\n\nSee it\n\nbecause you have to, but don’t expect greatness, just enjoy the eye candy.\n\n6.0 out\n\nof 10”\n\nIt’s a\n\nmiracle the site didn’t fold on the basis of that stellar bit of\n\nnon-criticiquedom. Godzilla was a big spiritual defeat for me even though I’m not\n\na spiritual guy though I plan to change that in the afterlife and will haunt the\n\nnightmares of each and every one of you.\n\nTo say I\n\nwas excited about Godzilla is like saying a virginal geek is excited when Natalie\n\nPortman’s nipple is almost visible through her Coruscant negligee. It was THE\n\nBIG ONE for me, possibly as important as the release of The Phantom Menace or possibly\n\nKlute\n\n2.0: Still Klutin’. Huge. I have loved the Japanese Godzilla flicks since I flew out of my\n\nfather’s dick in the bum’s rush to find my first egg breakfast and the affair\n\nintensified with each GIANT!!! MONSTER!!! BATTLE!!!. I had plenty of adoration for\n\nthe Dean Devlin/Roland Emmerich duo (Mr. Devlin has subsequently formed a\n\nhard-on for myself and CHUD.com and has been a right prick to me in our\n\ncorrespondence) so the project seemed like a win/win despite the presence of my\n\nhated Matthew Broderick. Here’s why it turned out to not be a win/win at all:\n\nThe\n\nplayful nature of the Japanese Godzilla\n\nfilms (aside from the sober and Burr-tastic original) is gone, replaced by easy\n\nvisual gags and very broad bits of comedy. Even though the Eastern films have a\n\nweird balance of ultra serious bland human elements and over the top monster\n\naction, they are fun and are aware their audience gets it. This film just replaces\n\nthe killer tidal wave, tornado, or sandstorm with a lizard and makes the\n\nmistake of being a very corporate adventure film and a situation desperately craving something fresher.\n\nIn my\n\nbrilliant six year old review I mentioned that Godzilla was the best character\n\nin the film and my former self was right in a sense. Contrary to public\n\nopinion, I like the American design just fine. It’s pretty cool and that’s not\n\njust because I chair the Jutting Chin\n\nFansite. It’s a cool design as long as you don’t drag your romanticized\n\nidea of a bottom heavy Godzilla into the mix. If you think of it, the Japanese Godzilla is\n\nbuilt sort of like the proprietor of an Ebay Star Trek merchandise store, so a lithe and leaner reptile is fine\n\nby me. Though the character has no real depth, the titular lizard is the most\n\ninteresting and likable one in the flick.\n\nThe Siskel\n\n& Ebert running joke. When Jean Reno makes a private visit to an old\n\nJapanese sailor in a hospital and the same scene is show as news footage a scene later. The\n\nlack of human destruction (a staple of these flicks). Oddly cast roles. Kevin\n\nDunn as a military leader? Matthew Broderick as a lead? Maria Pitillo as a\n\nperson? 11 gigs of RAM as Godzilla? It just feels a little “off” and these are but a few of the myriad reasons.\n\nThe\n\nresulting film has some nice eye candy and the most noble of intentions (I\n\nthink Devlin and Emmerich meant well but just lacked the grace to execute\n\nmaterial that needed a little nuance) but just is crushed under the weight of its\n\nhype and the lingering scent of the nearly universally adored Jurassic Park.\n\nIt’s a misstep, a somewhat decent one at times but a misstep regardless.\n\nIt didn’t\n\nrape my childhood, but it did beat off while having impure thoughts about my\n\nchildhood.\n\nThe Package\n\nThis is as subtle as flying into the sun to cure frostbite. King Kong (we weren’t sent a screener of that so you get this instead) hits home video, and here’s a \"Monster Edition\" hitting shelves with minimal new stuff (3 episodes from the cartoon and a collection of fight scenes from the Toho flicks) as well as some of the features from the original release. Want to see a video of The Wallflowers’ very worst song? Today is your lucky day!\n\nThis is a shameless release, still boasting at the bottom that SIZE DOES MATTER even though it really doesn’t (and after Elektra‘s SAIS DOES MATTER campaign you’d think they’s steer clear). It’s why Peter Dinklage gets acting jobs and Gheorghe Muresan doesn’t. Godzilla is a footnote to the 80’s and early 90’s blockbuster era, nowhere near the bomb and stinker people treat it as, but not a very good film either. It’s just there.\n\nNow it’s just here in a new and unremarkable double dip."
