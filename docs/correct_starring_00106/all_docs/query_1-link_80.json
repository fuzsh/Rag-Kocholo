        "text": "Twice a month Joe Lipsett will dissect a new Amityville Horror film to explore how the “franchise” has evolved in increasingly ludicrous directions. This is “The Amityville IP.”\n\nFor the 25th entry of this editorial series (!), we’re looking at the lone Amityville directed solo by a woman: Rebecca Matthews’ Witches of Amityville Academy (2020). Also known as Amityville Witches or Witches of Amityville, this British production is another “Amityville in name only.” That means the characters say the word, but it has no bearing to haunted objects and/or its DeFeo predecessors. In fact, the film is closer in tone and visual aesthetic to a soap opera than the preceding 26 titles.\n\nScreenwriter Tom Joliffe opens the film with not one, but two cold opens. The first features witches being hanged in 1602, while the second jumps ahead to the present day as white magic sisters Sam (Kira Reed Lorsch), Lucy (Donna Spangler), and Elena (Brittan Taylor) pacify a pair of burglars who break into their house.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that aside from these men and a slightly lecherous ride share driver, the film features only one significant male character: the demonic threat Botis (Toby Wynn-Davies). The rest of the cast is entirely female, which makes sense given the film’s preoccupation with sisterhood and spellcasting.\n\nThe plot centers around Jessica (Sarah T. Cohen), a girl without familial connections who receives an impromptu invitation to study “drama and the arts” at Amityville Academy. The school is run by Mrs. Dominique Markham (Amanda-Jade Tyler, vamping it up), a headmistress prone to sacrificing her students in order to accrue more power.\n\nThe only people who can oppose Dominique are the trio of Belle sisters. They also studied under teacher Tild Von Erich (Niccola Wright) but the trio use their powers exclusively for protection and healing. When Dominique realizes that Jessica is a powerful untapped witch and tries to kill her, the trio must step in to defend her, teach her their ways and ultimately banish Dominique before she can bring about the end of the world.\n\nThat description is more exciting than the actual film, which looks and plays (for better or worse depending on your preference) like a daytime soap. The acting ranges from melodramatic (Tyler) to earnest (Cohen) to a little stiff (Spangler and Taylor) and judging from the limited locations, as well as the lived-in production and low-fi FX, it’s clear the film is a low budget affair.\n\nStill, there’s something endearing about Witches of Amityville Academy. Perhaps it’s the film’s focus on older actresses, the familiar visual iconography of women performing spells together, or the not-so-subtle homages to witchy texts like Suspiria and Charmed, but Amityville Witches wound up being a simple, comforting watch.\n\nCritical viewers will undoubtedly favour the (admittedly better) texts the film is referencing. At the very least those films feature better special effects; Matthews makes only sporadic use of Angel Kunev’s green and violet visual effects for battle sequences. In fact, the majority of the time the actors simply strain and use hand motions to signify they’re using magic, which is often more than a little laughable.\n\nIt’s also hard not to wish that the narrative was a little more adventurous. Joliffe’s story is fairly paint by numbers and offers few, if any, surprises. The film also features too many characters, especially when the other students at the Academy are factored in. Aside from teacher’s pet Katherine (Barbara Dabson), none of them are distinguishable from each other. One saving grace, though? While there is very little violence, when blood is shed, such as when poor Sally (Georgina Jane)’s throat is slit, the gore looks okay.\n\nThat word could just as easily describe Amityville Witches overall: this is a totally fine, inoffensive film, albeit one that is a little too familiar and even a little boring. If you like seeing women of a certain age hovering over a pot of strange liquid or talking about repressed memories from another life, this is probably your jam.\n\nThe Amityville IP Awards go to…\n\nBest Dialogue 1: When dropping off Jessica on the side of the road at dusk, the ride share driver confirms a quick five-minute walk through the woods will get her to the Academy, adding “You can’t miss it!”\n\nBest Dialogue 2: During their first meeting, Dominique welcomes Jessica to Amityville Academy with the observation: “You’ve a rather sad existence. Alone. Friendless.”\n\nSlug Magic: At one point in the film, Dominique attacks Lucy, forcing a slug into her mouth. It’s unclear why ingesting this item, which looks like a cross between an amulet and a chocolate bar, nearly kills her, or what the two drops of amber liquid does to save her, but…sure. Lean into that slug magic, movie!\n\nProps to You: The film is prone to reusing the same props, which means that everyone has the same dagger and chalice. They’re both visually distinct so they stand out, which just makes it all the funnier when, say, Tild uses the same ceremonial dagger that Dominique killed Sally with or when Lucy pulls out the same chalice that Dominique collected blood in earlier.\n\nWitchy Homages: As mentioned, Joliffe is pretty obvious with his references. At one point we drop a “Power of 3” line (Charmed) and there’s another sequence where Dominique uses her magic to cause a pupil in another room to contort and convulse before dying (2018’s Suspiria). And while I can’t be certain, the dancing with incense sequence plays like a gentle nod to the kitchen scene in Practical Magic.\n\nNext Time: 2020’s offerings continue with Thomas J. Churchill’s The Amityville Harvest.\n\n“There’s some whores in this house!” blasts from the speakers. The stage lights brighten, and the queens strut out onstage. In Jem Garrard’s camp classic Slay, a Tubi original that dropped earlier this year, four drag queens – Mama Sue Flay (Trinity the Tuck), Robin Banks (Heidi N Closet), Bella Da Boys (Crystal Methyd), and Olive Wood (Cara Melle) – descend upon a sleazy redneck dive to deliver the performance of their lives.\n\nSet to Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s “WAP,” the salacious musical number bursts at the seams with the magic of queerness, drag performance, and community. As our dolled-up and dazzling quartet flits and flutters around the stage, the crowd looks on in both wonder and disgust. While country bumpkins like Travis (Daniel Janks) wrinkle their noses and scoff in between chugs of beer, bar regular Shiela (Robyn Scott) applauds the performance and even expresses her jealousy. Adoring fans Jax (Donia Kash) and Steven (Gabriel Harry Meltz) also show up to support the show – giving the performance great significance for the queer crowd.\n\nDrag as a real art form wasn’t something I had growing up. I wasn’t introduced to it until college. Coming from a small town, I lived a pretty secluded life surrounded by cows, crows, and cornfields. The only queer media I was familiar with was Will & Grace. While the popular NBC show featured drag queens occasionally, I didn’t yet understand the importance of drag performance. When I moved for college, I traded out those cows, crows, and cornfields for theatre studies, a rail system that never worked, and a flourishing LGBTQ+ culture.\n\nA whole new world opened up before me. I frequented the prominent gay fixture Vice Versa every weekend with my friends, and that’s where I witnessed my first drag show. I was in awe. Newly out as a gay man (I now identify as non-binary), I found myself entranced by the queens sashaying around the stage, wanting desperately to live my life just as fearlessly. The exaggerated makeup, the flowing costumes, and the big pop hits all conspired to make nights I’ll remember forever.\n\nThat’s the feeling I get every time I watch Slay.\n\nA refreshing mix of terror and humor, the film cherishes queerness in a very real way. The four leads, whose chemistry oozes in each frame, embody living as your most authentic self. In spite of the outside world, you accept who you are and let the shackles of the past loosen and fall off your body. The world might hate you, but you wear self-love and the love of other queer people like armor that repels hate and permits you to live a life worth living.\n\nIt’s too cliché to say “it gets better,” when sweeping anti-trans and anti-gay legislation makes it hard to believe it actually will get better for us. It might not, truth be told – but we forge ahead anyway because we value ourselves and the community we’ve built since Stonewall. What Slay represents to me is knowing that hatred has nothing to do with me but speaks to another person’s fear of the unknown.\n\nThat fear presents itself in the film as a horde of vampires that seek only one thing: blood. In the opening, the bar’s vendor Rufus (Shane John Kruger) makes a pitstop on his way to The Bold Buck, a biker bar on the outskirts of town. While taking a leak out by his truck, a vampire pounces and takes a hearty chunk out of his neck. Rufus’ transformation leads to a rampage in true From Dusk Till Dawn fashion. Later that night, he saunters into the bar, walks up to an unsuspecting local, and sinks his razor-sharp fangs into their neck. Chaos ensues as the others scramble, with other locals tossing Rufus out into the dirt. But he’s just getting started.\n\nThe groups (the bikers vs the queers) blockade the entrances in hopes of warding off the growing mass of vampires outside. Tensions reach a fevered pitch, and before long, they must set aside their differences and work together to survive the night. Travis doesn’t necessarily accept Mama Sue Flay and her friends, but he does grow increasingly tolerant – baby steps! Throughout the film, he teams up with Mama Sue to fight vampires down in the basement, and their shared traumas bring them just a few inches closer. They learn from each other, and while it’s not full acceptance, they come to respect one another in a mutual understanding.\n\nThese character moments tangle together with another underlying subplot involving the bartender, Dusty (Neil Sandilands), a closeted gay man, who harbors his share of childhood trauma. Early in the vampire attacks, Dusty heads to the drag queens’ dressing room to hide out. He tip-toes over to the vanity, where he eyes an array of makeup on the tabletop. His eyes widen in interest. Mama Sue and Robin Banks dash into the room moments later and spot Dusty seated at the vanity wiping on some blush. Caught in the act, he shrugs it off, clearly ashamed of what he’s done. But Robin is quick to the rescue, telling Mama Sue that “he needs this.”\n\nMama Sue and Robin transform Dusty into a flaming-haired drag queen. Dusty’s face changes. Gone is the shame his father beat into him. Instead, he glows. His posture shifts, too. Packed into a red little number, he appears back in the barroom carrying a double-barrel shotgun. Just because he’s now embracing his femininity doesn’t mean he doesn’t know how to take care of business. In fact, he’s far stronger and more self-assured than he’s ever been.\n\nDusty’s transformation is a beautiful thing. The moment he claims himself, he casts the past aside and learns exactly what it means to love yourself. That’s the marvel in drag performance. It’s taking up the mantel of identity, clenching your fists, and charging ahead. Femininity, often perceived as a weakness in a patriarchal society, is not a bad thing. And embracing female energy is an act of bravery. It’s looking toxic masculinity straight in the eyes and spitting in its face.\n\nWhile I’ve never performed in drag onstage, I have done drag for Halloween. And it was never just a costume for me. A few of the characters – Queen of Hearts, Miss Lucky, Sporty Spice – gave me access to femininity in a way I’d never felt before. It permitted me to finally love myself and see the value in honest living. While it’s been ages since I last dressed up, I have unlocked female power in other ways – like wearing eyeshadow, earrings, women’s clothing, etc. – and continued supporting drag whenever I can.\n\nSlay arrives as such a special experience. Aside from its exploration of queerness, the film is a damn fun vampiric romp with crisp, stylish cinematography (shout-out to the director of photography Trevor Calverley). Real care has been taken in every aspect, from script to filming. The characters feel like real people, and the performances are honest, pulsating with immense heart.\n\nIf you were ever skeptical about Tubi Originals, I implore you to give Slay a shot. It just might surprise you, too."
