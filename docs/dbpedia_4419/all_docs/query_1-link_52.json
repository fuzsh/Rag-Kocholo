        "text": "My 13-year-old son is considering his future and has indicated that he would be interested in joining the navy with a view to a career in Weapon Engineering , Communications Officer or Engineer Technician!\n\nAs his dad who wants him to make the path as easy as possible for him, are there any 'activities' you would recommend that he could do now which would assist him.\n\nObviously he may change his mind further down the line but at the moment that is the direction he is interested in.\n\nThanks for reading and any help will be gratefully accepted.\n\nThanks\n\nI'm not quite sure - why is \"math math math\" the recommendation? Is there something more mathematical about such a job than any other in engineering?\n\nPersonally, I found learning too much math brought me out of touch with the things that can turn out to matter a lot in engineering. I'd tend to say science science science! That stuff can involve math, but it keeps it in perspective as a tool.\n\nI'm just puzzled, not doubting what anyone is saying or anything.\n\nOh OK, I see. Yes, if there's too little math going on, it's definitely a danger. I should go ahead and caution though that there is such a thing as upsetting the balance :) there's something to be said of remembering what the math is for.\n\nI mean unless he wants to get sucked into math as a discipline, which is also great but not quite the intent here.\n\nI'd second Antiphon's suggestion. Just learning pure math without any direct applications may not really do the trick. You wouldn't even know where to start! I'd rather suggest him to do something cool which keeps him interested (like, building stuff); that is the best way of seeing that some of that abstract stuff is actually required and helpful in the real world. Many people have learned linear algebra because they needed it for making circuits or for programming music synthesizers.\n\nFrom my own experience: When I was a child, I learned tons of math, comp sci, and english(!) simply because I needed it for my actual hobby: programming. I would never have set out to a task like \"hey, let's learn english vocabulary because I might need it in the future!\"; but if you read thousands of pages of technical documentation over the years, some of those things come automatically. It's the same thing with math and other topics.\n\nMath is essential for understanding concepts and getting through school. However, as one mentor told me when I started working as an engineer: If you're doing something that requires more than basic arithmetic, STOP. You're probably reinventing the wheel somewhere. More than likely, you will make a mistake and then you won't be doing anyone any favors.\n\nIn my career so far, spanning 25 years, I have only very rarely had to solve differential equations, integrals, or any of the higher math that people study so religiously in college. Most of my work can be described with basic trig and arithmetic rules of thumb.\n\nAlso note, as someone who took an interest in engineering starting at age 10, you shouldn't have to push. Feed the curiosity, but don't push.\n\nradi said:\n\nMy 13-year-old son is considering his future and has indicated that he would be interested in joining the navy with a view to a career in Weapon Engineering , Communications Officer or Engineer Technician!\n\nAs his dad who wants him to make the path as easy as possible for him, are there any 'activities' you would recommend that he could do now which would assist him.\n\nObviously he may change his mind further down the line but at the moment that is the direction he is interested in.\n\nThanks for reading and any help will be gratefully accepted.\n\nThanks\n\nHey radi and welcome to the forums.\n\nI suggest some programming. Doesn't have to be overly technical, but usually this kind of work requires some kind of programming of some sort.\n\nMaybe he could write a simple game like a guessing game, or a text-based game to start off with. Although QBASIC doesn't teach you how to become a \"good technical programmer\", I would still recommend it since it is very easy to learn and the results can be seen pretty quickly.\n\nchiro said:\n\nHey radi and welcome to the forums.\n\nI suggest some programming.
