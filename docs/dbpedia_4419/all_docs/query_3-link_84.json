        "text": "All 50 states have ignition interlock laws on the books. If you’ve been convicted of drunk driving, or if you refused to submit to a chemical test, you may be required to install an ignition interlock device on your vehicle(s). But if you drive for a living, or you drive a work vehicle, how does that apply to your case? You may be eligible for the employer exemption for ignition interlock devices.\n\nYour DUI lawyer and your state Department of Transportation or Department of Motor Vehicles can give you the specifics that apply to your case. In this article, we discuss the exemption in general terms.\n\nThe Reasons Behind the Employer Exemption for Ignition Interlock Devices\n\nInitially, many states applied the ignition interlock device requirement to ANY vehicle an offender drove. That requirement resulted in some people being fired from their jobs. As a result, some states instituted an employer exemption for ignition interlock devices. This means those states have determined that if you drive a work vehicle strictly for work reasons, and it is owned or leased by your employer an ignition interlock device is not required on that vehicle in order for you to drive it.\n\nExamples of who might want to apply for the employer exemption assuming the employer agrees, include:\n\nDelivery truck drivers\n\nSemi-truck drivers\n\nDelivery van drivers\n\nLimousine or taxi drivers\n\nConstruction workers or HVAC workers who use a company vehicle\n\nAnd more\n\nNow let’s face it. Some employers will fire you for a drunk driving conviction if driving is a big part of your job. Other employers may reassign you for the duration of your restricted driving period. Still, others may allow you to drive one of their work vehicles with some specific requirements. Each case is different, and each employer is different. Be advised, the exemption most certainly DOES NOT apply if you are self-employed and own your work truck, big rig, or delivery van.\n\nStates with an Employer Exemption for Ignition Interlock Devices\n\nFor states with the employer exemption for ignition interlock devices, there is a lot of paperwork involved, and there is no guarantee you will be granted the exemption.\n\nAs of this writing, here are the states who list that they have an employer exemption for ignition interlock devices:\n\nAlaska\n\nArkansas\n\nCalifornia\n\nHawaii\n\nIllinois\n\nKansas\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisiana\n\nMaryland\n\nMichigan\n\nMinnesota\n\nMississippi\n\nNew York\n\nOklahoma\n\nOregon\n\nPennsylvania\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nTexas\n\nVirginia\n\nWashington\n\nWyoming\n\nIf your state allows the employer exemption for ignition interlock devices, if your employer agrees, filling out the proper paperwork should allow you to drive the work vehicle for business purposes only. You will still have to get the ignition interlock device installed on your personal vehicle, and drive your personal vehicle to and from work.\n\nTrying to cheat the system and driving the work vehicle for personal reasons can land you in legal trouble. If you have an ignition interlock restricted license and you’re caught driving a non-equipped vehicle during non-work hours (if you have the employer exemption) you could face fines, revocation of your restricted license, and more.\n\nInstalling an Ignition Interlock Device on Your Work Vehicle\n\nIf your employer values you as an employee, and wants to allow you to keep driving the work vehicle, but your state doesn’t have the employer exemption for ignition interlock devices, we can help.\n\nYour employer may want to let you drive, but needs some assurance that you will not drink and drive in the company vehicle. If that’s the case, we can install an ignition interlock device in your work vehicle. We work with employers and commercial vehicles every day. Installing an ignition interlock device on a commercial vehicle is really no different than installing it on a personal vehicle.\n\nIf you’re an employer and you want to install ignition interlock devices in your commercial fleet as a precaution, we can do that as well. The information the device records would be transmitted to you rather than a state monitoring agency.\n\nSchedule Your Ignition Interlock Device Installation Today\n\nALCOLOCK has ignition interlock device installation locations all across the country.
