        "text": "Ignition Awards\n\nThe Ignition Award program awards funds to researchers to advance an idea with clear commercial potential to a valuable inflection point milestone. Designed for researchers who are committed to bringing an idea to market, Ignition Awards funds are often used to achieve milestones such as generate compelling data, show proof-of concept, create a prototype, etc.\n\nAll BU faculty are invited to participate. Proposals are not a business plan – they are designed to focus on the next valuable milestone that will advance your idea while reducing risk. More than anything, the Ignition Awards are designed to be an educational experience to:\n\nRefine and improve your idea\n\nHelp PIs learn about your idea’s value in the market\n\nInteract with practitioners from industry\n\nWe offer two types of awards: $75,000 and $25,000. The process for approval is the same for either award.\n\nTo select the awardees, BU Technology Development (OTD) runs a three-part proposal and review process. Initially you will submit a letter of interest. This is reviewed internally to ensure that your proposed project is eligible and meets the goals of the awards. Once this internal review has been completed a group of semi-finalists will be invited to submit a full proposal to OTD. The full proposals will be sent to the Ignition Review Committee, which is comprised of outside representatives (investors, industry) and BU academics, who will select a group of finalists. The selected finalists will be invited to present their idea to and answer questions from the Ignition Review Committee who will make funding recommendations to OTD.\n\nOTD oversees the entire process and approves the final recommendations. OTD staff do not vote on funding recommendations.\n\nTechnology Development is here to help. We can advise you as you complete your proposal and will offer special programs on preparing a full proposal and presenting to the reviewers for anyone selected as a finalist. You can also review the slides from this December 2019 workshop on Writing Business Proposals. Finally, we offer programs on assessing your potential market and customers that we highly recommend to anyone interested in the Ignition Program.\n\nQuestions? Contact Michael Pratt at mpratt@bu.edu.\n\nRelated Reading:\n\nWant Wider Recognition for Your Idea? Ignition Awards Offer More Than Funding\n\nAnnouncing the 2023 Ignition Award Winners\n\nAnnouncing the 2022 Ignition Award Winners\n\nEssential Information\n\nDownload a visual of the Ignition Award process\n\nTimeline\n\nThe fun begins every fall on October 1 when we begin soliciting for letters of interest. See the full timeline below.\n\nOctober 1 Solicitation opens November 1 Letters of interest due to Technology Development November 25 Request for full proposals sent to semi-finalists January 15 Full proposals due to Technology Development February 15 Finalists notified April 6-8 Final presentations – actual dates to be determined in early 2023 Before May 10 Awardees announced\n\nScope and Uses of the Award\n\nThere are two classes of Ignition Award: up to $75,000 or $25,000, over one year, contingent on satisfactory progress towards proposed and accepted (by OTD) milestones. There is no overhead charge associated with Ignition Awards. Funds may be used in many ways to move an idea or technology closer to commercialization. Some examples:\n\nConduct further defined research on an invention that will lead to proof of concept or prototypes;\n\nUndertake testing of a technology or material to obtain initial data on performance;\n\nDevelop a more user-friendly software interface;\n\nSend a material out to independent third party for testing under industrial conditions;\n\nConduct in vivo or animal testing of a new compound;\n\nHire outside expert consultants or services to validate technology.\n\nFunds may not be used for:\n\nSalaries for faculty, including summer salaries\n\nBasic research;\n\nLegal expenses to advance intellectual property protection;\n\nPublicity expenses (e.g., the development of marketing materials);\n\nLegal and other expenses of business formation and operation;\n\nAttendance at academic conferences;\n\nPurchase of computer or other unrelated equipment;\n\nExpenditures that are covered by other funding sources (grants or sponsored research)\n\nBusiness purposes such as market research, interviewing customers, hiring business consultants or students\n\nWe encourage you to match Ignition Awards with other funding. If you can use the Ignition Award funds to augment or to attract other commercialization funds, we would like you to show this in your proposal. If you are awarded funding from multiple sources for the same project, we will want to see budgets and milestones showing which parts of the projects will be paid for by the Ignition Award and which will be paid for by other funding sources.\n\nEligibility\n\nFunds are awarded only to principal investigators at BU or BMC.\n\nIgnition Award funding is intended to assist researchers bring their BU ideas to market, whether that’s via a license to a third party or a startup you create (and then license the technology to your startup).\n\nThese funds are intended for BU licensable assets which can take the form of a patent or copyright. Your idea should result in such a licensable asset and your proposal should reflect how you intend to develop that asset.*\n\nYou must have disclosed your technology to Technology Development before applying for an Ignition Award. If you have not already disclosed your technology to Technology Development, you will be required to make a disclosure prior to the review.\n\nIf your technology was invented with other researchers from outside of BU and the intellectual property is co-owned, you may still apply for funding but you must include this information in your letter of interest.\n\n*Note: We’re not suggesting that you’ll complete the creation of that “asset” with this Ignition Award. But we do want to know that the creation of such an asset will be the result of your effort.\n\nSelection Process\n\nThe BU Technology Development office runs a three-part proposal and review process. Initially you will submit a short, mandatory letter of interest to Technology Development. This is reviewed internally to ensure that your proposed project is eligible and meets the goals of the awards. Once this internal review has been completed, a group of semi-finalists will be invited to submit a full proposal to Technology Development. The full proposals will be sent to the Ignition Review Committee, which is made up of outside representatives (investors, industry) and BU academics, who will select a group of finalists. The selected finalists will be invited to present their idea and answer questions to a select group of the Committee, who will make funding recommendations to Technology Development. Technology Development oversees the entire process and approves the final recommendations. Technology Development staff do not vote on funding recommendations.\n\nReview Criteria\n\nProposals will be reviewed by the review committee using the following five criteria. All criteria are weighted equally.\n\nTechnology Potential\n\nMarket and Product\n\nProject Plan and Milestones\n\nTeam\n\nOutcome and Impact\n\nReviewers will be asked to take the following factors into account when scoring against these criteria.\n\nTechnology Potential. Factors to consider in making this evaluation:\n\nInvention/technology/product concept is technically/scientifically new and unique\n\nDemonstrated that they have thought of how and why the invention/technology/product concept will be used in the market\n\nIdentified the current solutions that this new technology will compete with\n\nUnderstanding of the competitive advantages that this technology will have over current technologies. Performance metrics identified.\n\nMarket and final product. Factors to consider in making this evaluation:\n\nDescribed the value proposition for the product in the selected market (based on the needs of a customer, not just a solution to a problem)\n\nFinal product concept clearly differentiated from those already marketed and known to be in development\n\nEnd user identified. PI reveals evidence as to why this user will be interested in the proposed product\n\nSize of the market indicated. The market need not be big but they have to demonstrate that they know enough about the market to create a financially sustainable business or attract a buyer for the asset (even with revenues of <$1M)\n\nProject Plan and Milestones. Factors to consider in making this evaluation:\n\nClearly described and realistic project plan. Clearly defined milestones with rationale for each milestone and a clean end point (goal)\n\nPlan to develop a licensable BU asset (patent or copyright) is realistic\n\nAchieving the milestones will make the technology more attractive to a potential partner, investor or licensee\n\nUpon achieving the stated endpoint there is a plan or at least some knowledge of the next steps in commercialization and the resources needed to complete them\n\nTeam. Factors to consider in making this evaluation:\n\nThe team has demonstrated preparation for or commitment to the pursuit of commercializing this idea (i.e., programs, training, advice, mentorship either at BU or elsewhere)\n\nTeam is responsive to criticism and suggestion (e.g., critique and suggestions for the presentations from the proposals)\n\nThe necessary talent to perform the Ignition Award project has been recruited or identified\n\nPost IA activities: Identified team members to carry the project forward to the next step if IA project successful\n\nOutcome and Impact. Evaluate the social and/or economic impact of the award. Factors to consider in making this evaluation:\n\nPI has identified a real problem that, if addressed, will bring positive impact, and has identified the type of impact the solution will have, e.g., economic (job creation); make a process more efficient; improve welfare of people or environment; save lives\n\nThe invention has the potential to address said problem\n\nThe PI has determined the next funding source or audience to advance the idea\n\nThe PI has identified the next funder or audience’s criteria to “write a check”\n\nReview Committees\n\nMed Tech Reviewers\n\nBruce Carvalho\n\nFluidics and Materials Engineering Professional\n\nBruce Carvalho is currently a principal at Aixtek, a fluidics consultancy practice, and contributes to the technical leadership of LivOnyx, a Lowell-based hand sanitization start-up.

His work has focused on mechanisms of immune deposition and the role of complement in diseases of the kidney glomerulus, and on the structural biology of the podocyte. He was one of the earliest proponents of the notion that podocyte injury forms the basis of most, if not all, proteinuric kidney diseases. In a landmark New England Journal of Medicine paper in 2009, David and his colleagues described their discovery that a high proportion of patients with membranous nephropathy have circulating autoantibodies to the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor on human podocytes. This discovery was awarded international patents and was licensed by EuroImmun, a German company that has marketed an FDA approved diagnostic immunoassay for membranous nephropathy with world-wide distribution and sales. In collaboration with his colleague, Dr. Weining Lu, David has also been engaged in a cooperative program with Pfizer CTI that developed a potential therapeutic agent for proteinuric kidney diseases currently undergoing a phase II clinical trial.\n\nDr. Salant has received several awards and honors, including an Established Investigator Award from the American Heart Association, the Jean Hamburger Award from the International Society of Nephrology, the John P. Peters Award from the American Society of Nephrology, the Donald W. Seldin Award from the National Kidney Foundation, the Marilyn Farquhar Award at the 11th Annual Podocyte Conference and the Edward N. Gibbs Award from the New York Academy of Sciences. In 2015, he was the Boston University Innovator of the Year and he was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has served on several NIH advisory panels and on the editorial boards of several major journals.\n\nAndrew Senesi\n\nAssociate in Global Innovation, TechAtlas division, RA Capital Management.\n\nAndrew Senesi is a Principal with Tencent Exploration team, a corporate venture arm of tech giant Tencent, that seeks to tackle problems of global scale focusing on healthcare, sustainability, and breakthrough technologies.

It should define the basic outline of your idea, and establish its relative merit and general objectives. LOIs that meet our criteria will advance to a full proposal invitation.\n\nCriteria for a Letter of Interest\n\nPI has demonstrated commitment to commercializing the idea: e.g., identified market need, contacted or recruited industry experts, engaged in training to learn to bring an idea to market, etc.\n\nThe project has sufficient substance (work commenced, momentum, data) to warrant Ignition funding\n\nThe milestones are realistic\n\nThe project is designed so that it will enable the team to raise follow-on (additional) funding\n\nThe project has the potential to result in a licensable asset\n\nThere are no conflicts associated with project’s the intellectual property\n\nThe intellectual property is protectable (e.g., not published)\n\nDownload the Letter of Interest Template\n\nLOIs must be filled out on the template and submitted by email.\n\nHow to Submit a Full Proposal\n\nFull proposals will be requested from PIs based on promising letters of interest that meet LOI selection criteria. Full proposals are limited to five pages and are intended to provide Technology Development and the Review Committee with a full description of the technology, market considerations, budget, and a concrete project plan. Selected full proposals will be invited to give an oral presentation to the Review Committee for final award consideration.\n\nFull proposals need to be thorough but concise. Proposals will be reviewed by people with a technical, and/or legal or business background. However, they may not necessarily be familiar with your area of expertise. The proposals should be written with this consideration in mind and should enable them to assess the potential feasibility and commercial value of your technology.\n\nWhen proposing to the Ignition Review Committee please be sure to address how your approach fulfills an unmet need in the marketplace, how it compares to the “gold standard” or current solution, the anticipated regulatory path or standards that will be required, and how the product will be traded in commerce (e.g., reimbursed by healthcare providers), what milestone you will achieve with the funds and the nature of the funding opportunity that awaits you upon achieving that milestone.\n\nDownload the Ignition Full Proposal Template\n\nFull proposals must be filled out on the above template and submitted by email.\n\nYou will receive an email confirming receipt of your completed application.\n\nApplications that are not received by the specified deadline will not be considered in that competitive round but may be re-submitted in a subsequent solicitation for consideration.\n\nFinalist Presentation\n\nThe Ignition Review Committee will select a group of finalists from submitted full proposals. The finalists will be invited to make (virtual) in-person presentations to members of the Ignition Review Committee. For this presentation you should use the template that is supplied to you by Technology Development. Following these presentations, the Committee will make funding recommendations to Technology Development.\n\nWhen evaluating the IA presentations, the Reviewers will use the following achievements, for each of the five criteria and questions (listed in the Review Criteria of the IA website), to deliver a grade of “5” on a one to five scale.\n\nTechnology Potential\n\nThird party validation of the idea’s uniqueness\n\nThird party validation that it will improve upon the incumbent\n\nComplete list of incumbent technologies\n\nQuantitative data to support this technology’s superiority over incumbents\n\nMarket and Product\n\nValue proposition tested with customer\n\nTable or chart using third party data to demonstrate PI technology’s differentiation\n\nVoice of the user represented\n\nAddressable market clearly identified\n\nProject Plan and Milestones\n\nQuantitative endpoint and a plan for next steps\n\nPatent or copyright filed\n\nIntended audience for follow on funding consulted and desired output of this project stated by that third party\n\nSuccessful outcome of the IA linked to a basic, clear, and well justified commercialization plan\n\nTeam\n\nFor a startup: A technical champion (PI, doctoral student, or postdoc) has set aside time committed to support commercialization. For a license: they’ve communicated with more than one potential licensee to understand what they would want to see in a “packaged” deal\n\nTeam not only addressed recommendations and critiques from proposal feedback but did homework to address risks, gaps and/or third party perspective\n\nPI has already identified committed talent required to advance the idea upon completing this project\n\nTeam has taken steps to lay groundwork for continuing commercialization beyond IA through concrete steps (e.g., initiated discussions with external funding sources, applied for SBIR grant, etc.)\n\nOutcome and Impact\n\nPI has identified a real problem that, if addressed, will bring positive impact, and has identified the type of impact the solution will have, e.g. economic (job creation); make a process more efficient; improve welfare of people or environment; save lives\n\nImpact potential is validated by more than one third party\n\nPI has made contact (conversation or correspondence) with at least one follow-on funding source\n\nContact with next funder or audience resulted in understanding their criteria (for writing a check)\n\nPost Award Requirements\n\nAward recipients will report progress on pre-determined milestones and will be awarded funding based on completion of those milestones. See the award letter here to view your obligations upon receiving the award. Those obligations include:\n\nYou agree to work with Technology Development to formulate milestones that incorporate the Reviewers’ comments and suggestions, our suggestions, and your objective. This may include editing, altering and re-characterizing your milestones from your originally proposed version in your full proposal and presentation. A good milestone will maximize the value and reduce the risk of your idea upon the conclusion of the Ignition Award. The purpose of a well-constructed milestone is to position your idea for the next stage of funding to help you achieve your commercialization objective.\n\nYou agree to follow the reporting requirements as outlined in the accompanying FAQs.\n\nAward recipients will use the milestone report (see below for link to download milestone report), be asked to report progress on pre-determined and mutually agreed upon sub-milestones and be awarded the next sub-amount upon completion and approval from OTD of the previous intra-project milestone’s completion. In the event you do not submit sub-milestones and/or do not receive approval for those sub-milestones, any funds expended beyond those for which you have been granted permission will fall on the PI to return to OTD\n\nAs part and a requirement of your milestone assignment, you will conduct five business (investor, corporate, industry expert) interviews with each milestone and submit a summary of those interviews (company, title of person, nature of conversation) with your milestone report\n\nDownload Milestone Template\n\nYou will attend Technology Development functions designed to create a “community of innovators” among the IA recipients. These will include zoom meetings, lunches and dinners and require you to give a short update on your progress to your colleagues and tell them the challenges you face in bringing your idea to market.\n\nThe term of the grant is one year, and any unused funds will be rolled back into the Ignition Award Program unless a no cost extension is approved by Technology Development prior to the expiration date.\n\nYou affirm that your proposed research is in compliance with Boston University research policies including approvals from appropriate committees such as COI, IRB, etc. Please complete and return a Financial Interest Disclosure Form and follow the instructions from the COI website on how to submit.\n\nIf BU is successful in commercializing the technology, any Ignition Award Funding received will be repaid since award funds constitute “granted by the University specifically for the invention or discovery process” within the terms of the Boston University Patent Policy. The award will be repaid from licensing proceeds (if any) before the patent policy revenue sharing goes into effect or, if the technology becomes the basis for a startup company, equity Consideration (to be determined) will be granted to Technology Development.\n\nYou agree to work with Technology Development and BU Today to prepare materials and provide an interview to BU’s online community news page. You agree to help foster commercialization at BU by supporting the University’s efforts to publicize and showcase BU technologies.\n\nYou will commence this project within three months of the date on the award letter. The following tasks must be completed to constitute a commenced project: 1) this letter signed; 2) financial administrator name and contact information supplied; 3) COI form completed; 4) milestones approved by OTD; 5) funds transferred. If you have not completed all five requirements the award will be rescinded unless you are able to supply proof of a delay beyond your control. In the event of a granted delay within three months of the date of this letter, the award will be rescinded six months from the date of this letter regardless of mitigating circumstances.\n\nAt the end of the funding period up to one year, award recipients will be required to present in person the status and next steps of their research to the Director, Faculty Entrepreneurship. Recipients will continue to report to the Director, Faculty Entrepreneurship for another year to quantify the economic benefits of the Ignition Awards. In all cases these reports will be submitted to Technology Development (Michael Pratt at mpratt@bu.edu).\n\nThe Ignition Award program is considered a discretionary outlay of funds by the University and as such is considered a “University cost” per Section IV E of the Intellectual Property Policy. As such, the funds provided through an Ignition Award will be repaid out of future royalty or licensing income (if any) prior to any distribution specific to Section IV E of the Intellectual Property Policy."
