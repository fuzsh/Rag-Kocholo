        "text": "How can I find out how much I owe for my court fines that are suspending my license?\n\nYou may find the balance for your fines by looking them up using Iowa Courts Online. You can pay your fines online using the Iowa Courts Online payment service. Otherwise, you can call or visit the clerk of court in the county where the fine is owed to determine the current balance. Their contact information is on the official notice of suspension.\n\nHow can I pay my fines?\n\nCourt fines can be paid in full directly to the clerk of court either online or in person. Please provide your receipt or confirmation of online payment to the Iowa DOT to end your suspension. Submit your proof of online.\n\nI am not able to pay the fine in full, is there a payment plan available?\n\nA payment plan referred to as either the License Reinstatement Program or County Attorney Payment Plan (CAPP) may be available. You can apply for this program by contacting the county attorney’s office* in the county where the fine is due. If that county does not offer the program, contact the county attorney’s office in the county where you live or the county nearest you that offers the program.\n\nFind your county attorney’s office contact information.\n\n*Note: The License Reinstatement Program in Linn County is administered through the Linn County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nDo I pay interest or additional fees with my payment plan?\n\nIf the payment plan is through the applicable county attorney office, there is no interest involved. Iowa law authorizes the Judicial Branch to contract with a private debt collector for collection of debt owed to the state of Iowa. If a payment plan is established through this entity, there will be a fee up to 25% added to the total debt owed.\n\nHow does a payment plan with the county attorney’s office work?\n\nStaff with the county attorney’s office will work with you to set up the details of your payments. Once the plan is finalized, your first payment will be sent to the clerk of court. The clerk of court will then ask the Iowa Department of Transportation to withdraw the suspension(s) for failure to pay the fine(s).\n\nIf I start a payment plan will I automatically get my license back?\n\nA payment plan with the county attorney only ends suspensions for non-payment of fines. If your license is suspended, revoked, or barred for another reason, you can check with the DOT to see if you are eligible for a Temporary Restricted License (TRL/work permit) and to see if you have other reinstatement requirements to meet. You can view your reinstatement requirements by logging into https://mymvd.iowadot.gov.\n\nWho do I set up a payment plan with ?\n\nCourt debt: If you owe court debt, who you set up a payment plan with will depend on the situation. It may be the judge, the clerk of court, the county attorney, the sheriff’s office or the Department of Revenue. The rules about who collects these debts are complicated. If you owe court debt for more than one case, more than one of these agencies may be in charge of collecting the different debts.\n\nClerk of Court: Court debt stays with the clerk of court for the first 30 days. You cannot get a payment plan with the clerk for a debt that is $300 or less. If you already have a payment plan with the clerk that you are current on, you may be able to add a new court debt of less than $300 to that plan.\n\nDepartment of Revenue: If you default on your court debt, it is first sent to the Department of Revenue. They may charge a collection fee. The Department of Revenue is under no limitations as to how low monthly payments may be, and there is no minimum total to qualify for a payment plan.\n\nCounty Attorney: In some (but not all) counties in Iowa, the county attorney may collect delinquent debt 90 days after imposition. Like the Department of Revenue, county attorneys under no limitations as to how low monthly payments may be, and there is no minimum total to qualify for a payment plan. Many county attorneys have developed their own programs which have varied rules. You should contact the county attorney in the county where your debt is.\n\nWhat if the county I owe the fines does not have an installment agreement program?\n\nIf the person enters into an installment agreement with the county attorney or the county attorney’s designee, the person shall execute an installment agreement in the county where the fine, penalty, surcharge, or court cost was imposed. If the county where the fine, penalty, surcharge, or court cost was imposed does not have an installment agreement program, the person shall execute an installment agreement in the person’s county of residence. If the county of residence does not have an installment agreement program, the person may execute an installment agreement with any county attorney or county attorney’s designee.\n\nI owe court fines out of state. What can I do to end the suspension for failure to pay the fine?\n\nIf you owe court fines to another state, you must contact that state to determine a way to pay the fine or make a payment arrangement. The contact information for the court in the other state is included on your official notice of suspension from the Iowa Department of Transportation.\n\nTemporary restricted license (TRL)\n\nIf you are a resident of Iowa who is at least 18 years old and your Iowa driver's license has been revoked, suspended, or barred, you may be eligible for a temporary restricted license (TRL).\n\nIf your license is revoked due to an OWI offense under Iowa Code chapter 321J, a temporary restricted license issued under chapter 321J allows you to operate a motor vehicle in any manner allowed for a person issued a valid noncommercial driver’s license unless otherwise prohibited by chapter 321J. You must install an approved ignition interlock device on all vehicles operated for a first OWI offense to be eligible for a temporary restricted license. If it is a second or subsequent OWI offense, the person must install an ignition interlock device on all vehicles owned or operated as a condition of your temporary restricted license. If your OWI revocation began prior to July 1, 2018, and you are still under revocation, and otherwise eligible for a temporary restricted license, you may wish to apply or re-apply for a temporary restricted license because as of July 1, 2018, there are no longer mandatory periods of ineligibility or driving location restrictions for most OWI revocations.\n\nIf your license is revoked, suspended or barred under an Iowa Code section other than chapter 321J, a temporary restricted license may be issued allowing you to drive for specific reasons and during specified times.\n\nFor non-OWI offenses, you can apply for a temporary restricted license for the following:\n\nEmployment (work permit)\n\nHealth care - for you or a dependent\n\nChild care\n\nContinuing education\n\nSubstance use disorder treatment\n\nCourt-ordered community service\n\nProbation or parole officer appointments\n\nTo apply for a temporary restricted license for an OWI offense, you will need to complete Form 430400, Request for Temporary Restricted License – OWI Revocation.\n\nTo apply for a temporary restricted license for a non-OWI offense, you will need to complete a Form 430100, Application for Temporary Restricted License.\n\nIf you meet all requirements, you will be sent a notice that your application has been approved. You must then take the notice to a DOT driver's license station where you may be required to:\n\nPass all required examinations (vision, written and/or driving test)\n\nPay any civil penalties\n\nFile proof of financial responsibility\n\nPay a $20 reinstatement fee and the license fee\n\nIf your Iowa driving privileges have been revoked for operating while intoxicated (OWI), you will have to complete all requirements of Iowa's OWI law, including installation of an ignition interlock device.\n\nFor complete information regarding your eligibility for a temporary restricted license, contact:\n\nIowa Department of Transportation\n\nP.O. Box 9204\n\nDes Moines, Iowa 50306-9204\n\nTelephone: 515-244-9124 or 515-244-8725\n\nFax: 515-239-1837\n\nE-mail: Driver.Services@iowadot.us"
