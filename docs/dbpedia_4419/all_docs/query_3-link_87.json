        "text": "Upon completion of initial training at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes (known as Boot Camp), those pursuing a Construction Mechanic role report to Class “A” Technical School in Port Hueneme, CA, for 16 weeks. Here, you will develop a working knowledge of basic construction skills and theories required for work as a Construction Mechanic.\n\nAfter you’ve completed your schooling, you’ll be assigned to a Naval Mobile (NMCB) or Amphibious Construction Battalion (ACB), and may rotate between homeport and overseas locations, where additional training may be provided.\n\nPromotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. Advanced technical and operational training in the construction field may also be available during later stages of your career.\n\nPost-Service Opportunities\n\nSpecialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields in the civilian world.\n\nA high-school diploma or equivalent is required to become an Enlisted Sailor and a Navy Construction Mechanic. Those seeking a position with the Seabees must be U.S. citizens.\n\nConstruction Mechanics must be able to use tools, equipment and machines and have good use of your hands. Other important qualifications include knowledge of arithmetic, good speaking and writing skills and the ability to keep records while doing detailed work.\n\nImportant personal traits for Construction Mechanics include resourcefulness, curiosity and an interest in ideas and information. You should also possess a cooperative attitude and be in good physical condition.\n\nGeneral qualifications may vary depending upon whether you’re currently serving, whether you’ve served before or whether you’ve never served before.\n\nServing part-time as a Navy Reserve Sailor, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Construction Mechanics in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.\n\nFor annual training, you may serve anywhere in the world, including locations in the U.S., at bases overseas, or in areas where humanitarian needs are great.\n\nTake a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Navy Reserve Sailors.\n\nMost of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.\n\nSeabees in the Navy Reserve serve in an Enlisted role. Before receiving the ongoing professional training that comes with the job, initial training requirements must be met.\n\nFor current or former military Enlisted servicemembers, prior experience satisfies the initial Recruit Training requirement, so you will not need to go through Boot Camp again.\n\nFor those without prior military experience, you will need to meet the initial Recruit Training requirement by attending Boot Camp in Great Lakes, IL. This training course will prepare you for service in the Navy Reserve and count as your first Annual Training."
