        "text": "If you have lived in the District of Columbia for 60 days or more and you drive a vehicle in public, you must get a driver license from DC DMVâ€”unless you are a student, diplomat, active military member, part-time resident, member of Congress, or presidential appointee and are thus eligible for driving privilege reciprocity with your home state or jurisdiction.\n\nThe types of documents you are required to provide DC DMV depend on the type of driver license you are seeking to obtain. To learn what documents you need to successfully complete your transaction, use DC DMV's online Document Verification Guide.\n\nIf you get a REAL ID driver license, you will be able to designate certain options regarding voting, organ donation, Selective Service eligibility, veteran status and special designation indicators such as Autism, Visually Impaired, Hearing Impaired, and Intellectual Disability. If you get a Limited Purpose driver license, you will be able to make a designation on your license regarding organ donation as well as the special designation indicators. More information on these designations is available at the link below:\n\nLicense or Identification Card Designations\n\nDC DMV offers two different licenses for District residents, the REAL ID driver license and the Limited Purpose ID driver license, as well as driver permits, provisional and conditional licenses, commercial licenses, and motorcycle endorsements. Information on each type of license, license revocation and reinstatement, driver records, and other Driver Services related to licenses, is located at the pages listed below:\n\nDC DMV REAL ID Driver License\n\nObtain a REAL ID Driver License\n\nRenew a REAL ID or Limited Purpose Driver License\n\nReplace a REAL ID or Limited Purpose Driver License\n\nConvert Out-of-State Driver Licenses\n\nLicense Designations: Donor Status, Selective Service, Voting, Veteran, Autism, Hearing Impaired, Intellectual Disability\n\nDC DMV Limited Purpose Driver License\n\nObtain a Limited Purpose Driver License\n\nRenew a Limited Purpose Driver License\n\nReplace a Limited Purpose Driver License\n\nDC DMV Limited Occupational Driver License\n\nProvisional License\n\nFull License with Conditions\n\nDriver License for Non-US Citizens\n\nCommercial Driver License\n\nMotorcycle Endorsement\n\nSuspended or Revoked License\n\nLicense Reinstatement"
