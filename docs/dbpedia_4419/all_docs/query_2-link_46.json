Most of your information will be parsed from your resume; you will need to review it for accuracy, answer a few questions, and click the \"Submit\" button.\n\nCan I apply to multiple job postings?\n\nAbsolutely! Since there are many separate groups across the Laboratory, often hiring for similar skill sets, please feel free to apply to each position you are qualified for. Also, please note that once you submit an employment application, your resume will become part of our searchable candidate database and may be identified as a match for future job postings.\n\nHow can I submit a cover letter, letters of reference, transcripts, work samples or other documentation when I apply?\n\nSubmitting additional documentation at the time of application is not required.

Once logged in, you will see the status of your current applications in the “My applications” section. If your status indicates “New” or “In Review”, your resume is still under review. If your status indicates that your application was archived, your resume has been reviewed and you were not selected to move forward in the hiring process for this position and/or that position has been filled.\n\nCan I change my application after I have submitted it?\n\nYes, you can modify your application by doing one of the following:\n\nReapply to the position; your updated resume will be added to your application.\n\nAccess your application by requesting a one-time passcode at thislink, entering the same email address used when you applied.

Once you have signed in with your login information, you will see the jobs to which you have applied as well as the current status in the “My Job Applications” section.\n\nWe are committed in partnering with our hiring teams to provide every applicant feedback in a timely manner, but sometimes that may not be feasible.

Once the seven-day minimum posting requirement has been met, postings may be removed at the discretion of the hiring team and will no longer be searchable on our Careers Page. For positions that are filled on an ongoing basis, we create pipeline job postings that are regularly cycled throughout the year.\n\nWhy do some positions require US citizenship?\n\nAs a Department of Energy National Laboratory, there are some positions that may include portions of work that are classified in nature. Therefore, it requires the employee to be eligible to successfully obtain a security clearance. For job postings that have a requirement of a security clearance the eligibility requirements include the following: applicant must be at least 18 years of age; US citizenship is required. See DOE order 472.2 for additional information.\n\nDo you only hire US citizens?\n\nNo. We have some positions that do not require US citizenship. The requirements are indicated on each job posting in the header. When performing a job search on our site, you can apply the Security Clearance filter function to identify job postings that do not require US citizenship.\n\nDo you provide visa sponsorship?\n\nYes. Our Immigration team works with you to get work authorization for both full-time roles and internships.\n\nWhere can I find information about LLNL’s position types provided in the job postings?\n\nView our Position Types document for information about LLNL’s job position types.\n\nInterview Process\n\nWhat is the interview process?\n\nMost interview processes follow the stages of a phone screen, technical phone interview, on-site/virtual panel interview and presentation(s).\n\nWhat happens during a phone screen?\n\nA phone screen allows us to gather additional information about you. Phone screens are typically generalized and broad with the goal of further assessing your overall skill set, career progression and what you are looking for in your next job as well as understanding why you may be interested in working at LLNL.

Promptly completing the background check form will expedite the onboarding process.\n\nHow long do hiring contingencies take to clear?\n\nLLNL supports key critical missions involving national security and defense; as a result, we must uphold rigorous hiring screening standards.\n\nDrug screen results typically come back quickly upon completion.
