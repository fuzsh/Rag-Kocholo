        "text": "A driving restriction is a limitation of your driving privileges that may have been imposed for various reasons. The MVA may restrict your driving privileges as a result of a judge's decision in a court or administrative hearing case in which you are involved, because of an alcohol or drug related incident, or for medical or other reasons.\n\nWhat kinds of driving restrictions may be imposed?\n\nDepending upon your situation, one of the following types of restrictions may be placed on your driving record:\n\nWork or education restriction You may be limited to driving only to and from work or school and during the course of your employment. In some instances, your employer may be asked to verify your employment in writing.\n\nMedical restriction You may be required to use special equipment when driving, or your driving times and/or driving area may be limited. The types of medical restrictions that may be imposed include:\n\nCorrective lenses required\n\nAdaptive equipment required\n\nHand control\n\nSpinner knob\n\nLeft foot accelerator\n\nOutside mirrors required on both sides of the vehicle\n\nProsthetic aid required\n\nAutomatic transmission required\n\nDaylight driving only permitted\n\nDriving limited to a certain geographical area\n\nNo driving on expressways, beltways, or interstate highways\n\nAlcohol/drug restriction\n\nYou are prohibited from driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol, or any other mood altering substance, in any amount. Furthermore, if you receive two alcohol related convictions within a 2-year period you will be subject to a 3-year alcohol restriction. If you are under 21 years of age you are restricted from driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level between .02 grams/100ml and .08 grams/100 ml.â€‹\n\nIgnition interlock device restriction\n\nYou are required to install and maintain an Alcohol Breath-Analyzed Ignition Interlock Device in your vehicle that is equipped with a camera. You must breathe into this device every time you start your vehicle so that it can test for the presence of alcohol in your system. See Ignition Interlock Program for more information about this process, or contact an ignition interlock service provider.\n\nWhat happens when a decision is made to impose a driving restriction?\n\nOnce it is determined that your driving privilege must be restricted, you will receive a letter that explains the type of restriction and how you can obtain a new, restricted driver's license at any MVA branch office. The restriction will be marked on the front of your driver's license.\n\nIf you do not comply with the restriction rules, your driver's license will be suspended, or other actions may be taken to further limit your driving privileges.\n\nFees:\n\nThere is a fee for a new driver's license. If the restriction is imposed because of your physical impairment, or if you are required to add adaptive equipment to your vehicle, the MVA will issue you a new, restricted license at no cost to you. However, if you are eligible to have your driver's license renewed when the restriction is applied (6 months or less prior to the expiration of your driver's license), you will be requested to pay the standard license renewal fee.\n\nThere are fees associated with the installation of an Ignition Interlock Device.\n\nContact Information:\n\nMVA\n\nDriver Wellness and Safety Division\n\n6601 Ritchie Highway\n\nGlen Burnie, MD 21062\n\nMVA\n\nAdministrative Adjudication Division\n\n6601 Ritchie Highway, N.E.\n\nGlen Burnie, MD 21062\n\nFor telephone questions:\n\nMVA Customer Service Center: 1-410-768-7000\n\nTTY/Hearing Impaired: 1-301-729-4563"
