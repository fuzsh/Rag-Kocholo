        "text": "“Blow harder” means that your breath sample did not last long enough for your test to register. “Hum stronger” means that you began humming either too late or too soon. It might also mean that your hum was not strong enough to register. “Blow softer” means that your breath sample was too strong. “Don’t inhale” means that you might have inhaled while your lips were still around the mouthpiece, therefore sucking air into the unit. “Abort tamper” means that you covered the vent on the back of your IID while blowing. “Mouth closer” means that you’ll need to hold the Ignition Interlock Device more firmly against your mouth to avoid letting the device pull away as you blow. To complete your test successfully, you will need to blow steadily for the full time of your test. Keep both your breath volume and your hum even during testing.\n\n“Abort lock” means that you have exceeded the allowed number of aborts during a 15-minute period and will need to wait until the countdown completes before you attempt another test.\n\n“Initial BAC” means that the device has detected alcohol during your initial test. “RRTEST” means that the device detected alcohol during your rolling re-test. “CIRC” means that circumvention has occurred in the form of you disconnecting your handheld while driving. “Templock” means that your test detected a low level of alcohol and your device has been temporarily locked based on your state’s limits. “RRSkip” means that a rolling re-test skip has occurred because you did not take a test when prompted after your initial test. Even if you are at your destination, you must test again if your device prompts you to do so.\n\nThis means you have lost all your points and have exceeded the violation grace period. You must now call (800) 831-3299 to obtain a one-time unlock code in order to take the vehicle to a Smart Start service center. You can also click here to obtain a one-time, six-hour unlock code. You must take your vehicle to a service center within 6 hours of entering the code to regain the use of your device. If you fail to take your vehicle to the nearest service center within 6 hours, you will unfortunately have to tow your vehicle at your own expense."
