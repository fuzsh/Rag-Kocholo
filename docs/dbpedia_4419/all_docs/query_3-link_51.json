        "text": "The built-in Wi-Fi® Hotspot* (vehicle must be on or in the accessory position for Wi-Fi to function) turns your vehicle into a reliable mobile hub, with great signal quality and bandwidth. It provides a better in-vehicle experience than your smartphone and is powered by your vehicle, so you’re not reliant on a mobile device battery.\n\nThe SSID is the name of the Wi-Fi Hotspot for the vehicle, and the passphrase is the password associated with the hotspot. The SSID will be used to identify which Wi-Fi Hotspot you connect to, and the passphrase will be entered to complete the connection.\n\nMembers who purchase an eligible Wi-Fi equipped Chevrolet,® Buick® or GMC® vehicle can receive up to 1 month of unlimited data for the available in-vehicle Wi-Fi Hotspot.\n\nMembers who purchase an eligible Wi-Fi equipped Cadillac® vehicle up to 6 months of unlimited data.\n\nYou can check how much data you have remaining with your myChevrolet,® myBuick,® myGMC® or myCadillac® Mobile App* or by visiting your GM account. Additionally, you can push the blue OnStar button and ask an Advisor.\n\nThe built-in Wi-Fi Hotspot provides a better in-vehicle experience than your smartphone. Our stronger signal means you have a fast and reliable connection. It is powered by your vehicle, so you’re not reliant on a mobile device battery, and you can access your hotspot up to 50 feet (vehicle must be on or in the accessory position for Wi-Fi to function) from your vehicle. The built-in Wi-Fi Hotspot is easy to use because it’s automatically on after initial setup and ready to connect to your mobile devices.\n\nThe coverage for the built-in Wi-Fi Hotspot depends on the wireless carrier network coverage. When you are in areas where coverage fluctuates, performance may be impacted. In a 2G-coverage area, the Wi-Fi Hotspot will not work. In a 3Gcoverage area, streaming data or video to your devices may result in the degradation of your service. View the coverage map.\n\nAlso, the vehicle ignition needs to be in the “Run” or “Accessory” position for the Wi-Fi Hotspot to be active."
