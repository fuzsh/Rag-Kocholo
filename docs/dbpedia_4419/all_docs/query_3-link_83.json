        "text": "Applying to Ivy Tech is Free & Easy\n\nThe Ivy Tech application is free and easy—you don’t need a certain test score, GPA, or class rank to get started at Ivy Tech. Applying takes about 10-15 minutes and can be completed entirely online.\n\nNo Application Deadlines\n\nIvy Tech does not have a deadline for admission. Our 8-week class sessions start throughout the year—in January, March, June, August, and October—and there is no hard deadline for applying for any of the start dates. It's important, though, to apply early enough that you'll be able to complete all the degree planning, financial aid, and registration activities that need to happen before your first day. We recommend you apply about one month before you intend to start classes. See upcoming start dates\n\nSteps to Apply\n\n(1) Apply to Ivy Tech\n\nIf you’ve never applied to Ivy Tech Community College before (or if it’s been two years since you last attended classes here), your first step is to apply to Ivy Tech. You can apply online or in person. To apply in person, reach out to your local admissions team and arrange a meeting. Or, stop by any campus on any Tuesday for Tuesdays@TheTech to receive personal assistance with applying and registering for classes.\n\nApply Now\n\n(2) Submit Assessment Documents\n\nAfter you submit your application, you'll be asked to upload documentation—such as SAT/ACT/PSAT scores or high school and college transcripts—that can assess your readiness for college-level coursework and help us make sure you are taking classes that are the right fit for you. How to upload assessment documents\n\nIf you don't have your scores or transcripts at your fingertips, don’t worry. Go ahead and submit your application. You can go back to upload assessment documents at any time until the end of the term for which you applied.\n\n(3) Look for a Confirmation Email\n\nOnce your application is processed, you will receive a confirmation email at the email address provided on your application. Typically the email will arrive within 1-2 business days of submission, but during peak processing periods (April-June) could take up to 5-10 business days.\n\nThe email will contain instructions on how to register for classes, as well as important information regarding your Ivy Tech student portal (MyIvy account), tuition, payment options, and more.\n\n(4) Create an Account in MyIvy\n\nMyIvy is Ivy Tech's online student portal. Students use MyIvy to check e-mail, register for classes, pay tuition, manage financial aid, get the latest news and announcements, and much more. MyIvy also contains \"QuickLinks\" to the Ivy Tech websites and online tools you will use most often. Learn more about MyIvy\n\nFor first-time user instructions and other MyIvy tips: View/Print MyIvy Help Sheet\n\n(5) Course Placement\n\nBefore you can register for classes you will need to submit documentation or complete an assessment test. Your test scores can help us determine the best English and math starting classes for you. See the Test Score Course Placement Chart\n\nIf you submitted assessment documentation during the application process, your advisor will likely be able to work with those documents to determine course placement and you won't need to take any further steps. If you don't have any of those documents or the scores don't meet minimum thresholds, don’t worry! Your advisor will direct you to complete our free Knowledge Assessment to help develop your customized learning path to better prepare you for courses.\n\n(6) Register for Classes\n\nOnce you have completed the steps above, you may register for classes. Ivy Tech students register for courses using the Schedule Builder tool which can be accessed within MyIvy. If you are a new, first-time Ivy Tech student, we recommend that you meet with your advisor who will help you develop your Academic Completion Plan and help you sign up for courses that are the best fit for you.\n\nFor a complete list of registration steps, including detailed registration steps, deadlines, and information about holds, withdrawals, waitlists, and refunds, visit our Registration 101 page.\n\n(7) Pay Your Tuition"
