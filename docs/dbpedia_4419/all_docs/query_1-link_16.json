        "text": "The Group* strives to enhance corporate value by added value creation aligned with its business strategy in seeking to promote its talent strategy aligned with its business strategy.\n\nAt the same time, the Group engages in various initiatives in striving to achieve sustainable growth with its sights set on maximizing added value and enhancing productivity and creativity of every employee.\n\nThe group does this by setting the axis of our Talent strategy, which aims to allow diverse talents to shine through spreading success and gaining confidence of individuals. The Group began experimenting with “Talent creativity” as a benchmark reflecting such initiatives in 2023 and introduced “Talent creativity” as a global management KPI to the Mid Term Business Plan (2024-2026).The Groupâs basic approach to “Talent creativity” is reinforcing talent investment to increase added value and create a virtuous cycle of value creation. The Group sets the “Talent creativity KPI” as one standard as a global company and works on issues by region / by country while tracking global progress through its KPI (adjusted operating profit (value added) divided by talent investment (sum of labor expense, training and development expense, and welfare and benefit expense).\n\nIn seeking to promote this talent strategy and enhance Talent creativity, the Group engages in initiatives to address its globally common priority items of “Securing Bridgestone-like talent“, “Talent development“, “Improving Working Environment“, and “Creating a place where diverse talent can shine“. The Group has also embarked on initiatives for visualization of both talent and position in seeking to promote and strengthen its talent portfolio in alignment with its business strategy.\n\nSince its founding, the Group has been expanding and evolving its business to meet the changing needs of society while continuing to support the mobility of people and objects with safety and peace of mind, guided by its unwavering mission of “Serving Society with Superior Quality.” Bridgestone DNA has been shaped and refined over the course of its history through its journey of taking on challenges. This includes the Group's \"focus on quality,\" \"respect for being on-site (Genbutsu-Genba),\" \"being attentive and supportive of customer problems,\" and championing a \"challenging spirit\". The Group believes that “Securing Bridgestone-like talent” in terms of individuals who empathize with and embody these four elements of its DNA is essential when it comes to its aims of working toward the notion of “becoming a resilient “excellentâ Bridgestone that transforms change into opportunity, unperturbed by continuous change while remaining robust and flexible like rubber,” as set forth in the “2030 Long Term Strategic Aspiration-Bridgestone 3.0 Journey,” and also for Management, Working & business quality improvement, namely entailing the objective of “Create good business quality,” in the Mid Term Business Plan (2024-2026) with 2024 as the first year. And the foundation of this is the Groupâs unique “Deming Plan,” which was formulated in the 1960s toward receiving the Deming Application Prize, given to companies that demonstrate distinguished and comprehensive quality management. The Group was awarded the Deming Application Prize in 1968, and its quality management activities are strongly reflected in the Groupâs mission of “Serving Society with Superior Quality” and “focus on quality”, which is part of Bridgestone DNA. The Groupâs “Continuous Improvement” activities implemented on-site while embodying the notion of “respect for being on-site (Genbutsu-Genba)” serve as âits global asset. The Group accordingly believes that improving working & business quality derives from its pursuit of operational excellence, meaning that the Group always aims to improve productivity and to perform high quality work in all of its operations. This is achieved by promoting continuous improvement and innovation amid a scenario where everyone from the Groupâs leaders and the organization overall to each and every employee embrace this asset. In seeking to re-enhance understanding regarding Bridgestoneâs unique Deming Plan, the Group began reinforcing its Management quality and working & business quality improvement workshop starting with the Companyâs management in 2023. The Group will extend it to a wider level (executive / managerial / staff) and expand it globally in 2024. Global EXCO members attended a workshop in Kurume, Bridgestoneâs birthplace, in March 2024.\n\nJapan\n\nEnhancing “Challenging Spirit”:\n\nBridgestone is encouraging the transformation of mindset and behavior in part through introduction of the “Genba (on-site) 100-Day Challenge Program.” This program allows participants to apply voluntarily to take initiative in investigating and verifying self-identified issues and hypotheses at sites both in Japan and overseas involving various operations. Additionally, the “Management Challenge Program,” which offers junior employees who are motivated to take on challenges the opportunity to gain management experience early in their careers by serving in a pre-management position. In 2023, 15 people took part in the “Genba (on-site) 100-Day Challenge Program” and 10 people took part in the âManagement Challenge Program.â\n\nLeadership training:\n\nAs for strengthening the foundation of management behavior, the following programs are being implemented for all line managers responsible for organizational management.\n\n360-Degree Evaluation:\n\nA program aimed at strengthening management behavior by reflecting on their own leadership characteristics through multi-faceted evaluations, in order to lead the team's achievements and growth.\n\nCoaching Program:\n\nA program that focuses on effective dialogue and motivation for the growth of each team member, learning \"coaching\" skills and applying them to support the actions and growth of the members.\n\nAs for practical training tailored to business strategy, the Company offers action learning programs that focus primarily on core positions and cover actual business themes across operations, as part of “Talent Development College” training framework. The programs are designed to enhance the skills required to manage a business.\n\nDigital training:\n\nThe Company has introduced “Digital 100-Day Training” covering a wide range of levels by having employees select a program that matches individual digital skill level since 2023. The program consists of introductory training, where participants learn basic digital literacy compiled by Digital Literacy Council through classroom lectures, and practical training, where participants deepen their knowledge through exercises focused on digital technologies related to their own job responsibilities. In 2023, more than 700 people participated in this program, according to their skill levels and their needs, and worked on enhancing their digital skills. Additionally, for intermediate and advanced levels, the Company initiated the \"Bridgestone x Tohoku University Co-creation Lab\" project in 2021, where employees are dispatched to Tohoku University. Through planning and developing AI and algorithms, the Company aims to cultivate \"AI/Algorithm Experts\" who play a core role in solution business and research and development, as well as \"Solution Field Engineers\" who can identify problems in business operations and propose solutions utilizing digital technologies.\"\n\nTraining for a wide range of employees:\n\nThe Company has established and operated the “Talent Development College” training framework, which aims to reinforce the skills (job performance and management capabilities) required of all employees, regardless of department or function, and support employees who are self-motivated to take on challenges and achieve growth. The training framework effectively combines learning with practice to support individuals to grow and maximize their capabilities, in turn revitalizing the organization and contributing to achievement of the Companyâs business strategies and goals. Moreover, the Company assesses participant feedback and needs, and conducts annual program reviews and expansion while rigorously implementing the PDCA cycle.\n\nIn addition to company-wide training programs, sections in charge of professional training in each department equip employees with the required skills, be it relating to research and development, production technology, safety and disaster prevention, quality, environment, sales, financial affairs, intellectual property, or public relations. The major training programs are as follows:\n\nNew employee training\n\nTraining for regular new graduate employee\n\nFor new graduate employees, the Company offers around seven months of training that starts from the time they join the Company and lasts until assignment to a particular department.

When enrolling, the course to be taken is determined based on the individual's motivation and abilities, taking into account communication with their supervisor. After completing the course, the learning is reinforced by applying it to their work. The following are the various styles of learning opportunities the Company provides:\n\nGroup training:\n\nThe Company offers face-to-face and online training sessions that facilitate career development and acquisition of business skills through discussions, dialogues, and role-playing with others.\n\nSelf-development support:\n\nThe Company provides a variety of courses, including e-learning, to enable employees to work on skill development according to their own needs and timing, such as acquiring professional knowledge, obtaining certifications, and enhancing language skill.\"\n\ne-learning programs\n\nThe Company conducts a monthly curriculum to learn repeatedly about Bridgestone Essence (corporate philosophy), \"Bridgestone E8 Commitment,\" and sustainability. In addition, the Company utilizes a wide range of e-learning opportunities to ensure all employees have the opportunity to learn about topics they should be aware of.\"\n\nAsia Pacific, India, and China region\n\nEnhancing “Challenging Spirit”:\n\nBSAPIC believes in the power of experiential learning will benefit talent the most in their development. The focus on the “Challenging Spirit” encourages employees to continuously seek new challenges and opportunities for growth. These are achieved through talent exchange between group companies, fostering cross-regional/functional projects collaboration and knowledge sharing to drive innovation and address business challenges effectively.ãIn addition, BSAPIC will implement new initiative such as the “Genba”100-days Challenge (similar to the program in Japan) in 2H 2024, which will strategically increase assignments and rotations.\n\nLeadership training:\n\nBSAPIC provides several key training programs and adopts 360-degree review tools for strengthening the regionâs succession dashboards in developing and building future-ready leaders.\n\nRegional New Manager Induction Program\n\nDesigned to onboard newly hired and promoted managers across the region and provide insights into business strategy, organizational structure, and key initiatives.\n\nHigh-Potential General Management Program (GMP)\n\nDesigned to strengthen their General Management skillsets on their strategic thinking and decision making in partnership with Asiaâs top-ranked business school.

Each employee is strongly encouraged to achieve a minimum of 40 training hours per annum to promote the culture of continuous learning and development. BSAPIC is delighted to report employees achieved 534,900 total annual training hours in 2023, which was equivalent to over 30 hours per employee, and increase of 53% vs 2023.\n\nBE INSPIRED campaign\n\nSince 2020, BSAPIC launched its BE INSPIRED campaign and continues to promote a culture of self-paced learning through sharing of “bite-sized” self-learning content on a regular basis with employees. The content of the BE INSPIRED campaign includes SBU-curated virtual e-learning courses on soft skills and hard skills (predominantly functional domain centric) as well as leadership development and general management articles.\n\nLaunch of SuccessFactors E-Learning System\n\nIn 2023, BSAPIC proudly introduced the SuccessFactors (SF) e-Learning System across the group companies in the region, beginning with indirect salaried employees, followed by direct salaried employees from 2025. By leveraging this system, BSAPIC facilitates structured and consistent self-directed e-learning experiences, ensuring a seamless and effective approach to skills development for the employees. More than 4,000 online courses (soft and hard skills) in 7 Asian languages are offered. With the convenience of self-paced e-learning, accessible anytime and anywhere, individuals can proactively pursue skill enhancement and personal development in alignment with their career aspirations.\n\nCritical New Skills for the Future initiative\n\nThis initiative commenced in late 2020 and completed in 2022 summarizing the 95 soft skills and 188 hard skills to upskill and reskill BSAPICâs talent. They can be acquired through designated 70-20-10 (Education)* model.\n\n* 70:20:10 Model suggests individuals tend to learn 70% of their knowledge from challenging experiences and assignments, 20% from developmental relationships, and 10% from coursework and training.\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa region\n\nEnhancing “Challenging Spirit”:\n\nTargeted approach to develop teammates and build their capability for future roles and future needs of the business.\n\nProvide skills-based development to ensure teammates have the capabilities needed to deliver business results.\n\nActively draw on identified talent to fill critical workforce gaps and support the needs of the business.\n\nIdentify key roles for talent exchange between business units and regions to provide experiential learning that develops business acumen and a global mindset.\n\nBSEMEA is committed to developing talent for the future.

BSEMEA provides teammates with a wide variety of experiences and challenging opportunities where they can gain new skills, collaborate with different individuals and teams, own their personal journey, and build a career that is meaningful for them and for Bridgestone. BSEMEA believes that the richest learning is experiential.\n\nLeadership training:\n\nBSEMEA is laser-focused on assessing and bridging the talent gaps. BSEMEA aims to enhance its competitive edge by investing in talent. BSEMEA provides the leadership curriculum to the managers as below.\n\nLead4Success:\n\nCurriculum for the managers who step into the function of leading others\n\nHelp Them Grow/Love Them or Lose Them:\n\nCurriculum for the managers to hold engaging and retention conversations with their team\n\nDigital training:\n\nBSEMEA drives its digital transformation journey and creates the culture for better use of digital technology and tools. BSEMEA has introduced an online e-learning authoring tool called Flowsparks and allows SMEs in different locations to create their own online content. BME and Digital ID projects use Flowsparks for Manufacturing sites, as well as several locations use it to support onboarding. BSEMEAâs back-office teams use it to update employees on changes in policy and guidelines, as well as to create awareness and share updates on DE&I, GHRP or Sustainability. BSEMEAâs sales teams have also used Flowsparks to launch new products.\n\nTraining for a wide range of employees:\n\nBSEMEA aims to be a learning organization. This includes using SME-generated bite-sized online content that is automatically translated and shared among different countries, several additional resources available to all employees offered by BSEMEA Center of Excellence (CoE), and overall support for all the local initiatives organized by the local Learning & Development (L&D) teams.\n\nLinkedin Learning\n\nBSEMEA has used Linkedin Learning for more than four years as the external content library. In 2023, BSEMEA launched a Weekly LinkedIn Learning challenge to announce and recommend specific courses throughout BSEMEA via B-Connected and randomly selected winners.\n\nGoFluent\n\nBSEMEA launched GoFluent in February 2023. BSEMEA offers free online language courses to all employees (including operators and contractors) to allow them to develop their language skills in various 12 languages. Employees have spent more than 4,000 hours for language learning in 2023.\n\nLearning Weeks\n\nIn 2023, BSEMEA organized two Learning Weeks in April and November, which involved a 1-hour-calendar-block to be used on training activities directly by CHRO and announcing a full week of several virtual learning events. Learning Weeks resulted in more than 3,000 participants joining in person and 900 completions of e-learnings later in 2023.\n\nMentoring\n\nBSEMEA conducts mentoring for mentees and mentorsâ trainings regularly and encourage employees to participate in the mentoring program.\n\nInitiatives for employeesâ performance enhancement & career development\n\nThe Group ensures fair application of its performance evaluation systems across all regions. Employees are evaluated based on their demonstrated abilities and actual performance. The Groupâs overarching evaluation principles emphasize ongoing dialogue between employees and their supervisors. This ensures employees have the right feedback and support to deliver results, allows them to complete meaningful and rewarding work and develops their skills and capabilities. In order to encourage a culture of open feedback, multidimensional evaluations, including 360-degree evaluations, have been introduced in each of the Groupâs regions.\n\nThe Group supports all employees in their efforts to continually and independently develop their careers. Across the Groupâs operations, employees are encouraged to have career and development plans that they work towards in collaboration with their supervisors and leadership teams. The table below reflects the percentage of employees regularly receiving career development interviews (assessments).\n\nRegular performance reviews\n\n2023 Japan Total 91% Bridgestone Corporation 100% China, Asia Pacific 96% Americas 55% Europe, Middle East and Africa 73%\n\nPercentage of employees attending career development interviews (assessments)\n\n2023 Japan Total 69% Bridgestone Corporation 94% China, Asia Pacific 14% Americas 26% Europe, Middle East and Africa 36%\n\nDeveloping manufacturing-sector employees group-wide\n\nAs of October 2023, the Group has 97 production sites worldwide. The Group understands it is essential to maintain and improve product quality across all these sites. As such, the Global Manufacturing Education Centre (G-MEC) in Japan works with the personnel development organizations at the SBUs and worksites in every region (Japan: J-MEC; China: C-MEC; Asia: AP-MEC; North America: NA-MEC; South America: LA-MEC; Europe: E-MEC; and Turkey: BRISA-MEC) to develop key manufacturing personnel known as “masters” at each SBU and worksite. In doing so, the aim is to develop personnel who can implement uniquely Bridgestone manufacturing techniques across the world.\n\nNumber of masters (as of December 2023)\n\nRegion Japan China, Asia Pacific Americas Europe, Middle East and Africa Total Production process management 10 19 3 6 38 Standard skills instructor 24 29 - 24 77 Equipment maintenance management 30 36 11 18 95 Total 64 84 14 48 210\n\nBased on the belief that the success of diverse talent leads to the creation of value as expressed in the “Bridgestone E8 Commitment,” the Group has created a workplace environment where each and every employee can play an active role. Positioning the improvement of employee engagement as one of the key issues in globally promoting culture changes in line with the “Bridgestone E8 Commitment,” the Group has started to conduct monitoring through engagement surveys and shares good practices from each region. Moreover, the Group began conducting globally unified engagement surveys*1*2 in 2023. These surveys seek to deepen and make progress on initiatives based on a common evaluation and activity framework globally, while respecting regional differences in cultures and characteristics.\n\nGlobal common strength and further improvement items based on the result of engagement survey\n\nThe Groupâs foundation for corporate management is the notion of “Safety First, Always,” as set forth in its Safety Mission Statement. Promoting activities to ensure every employee is able to work in a safe workplace with peace of mind is an expectation not only of employees but also of our customers and other stakeholders. As such, this Safety Mission Statement is furthermore essential in ensuring industrial safety and hygiene with respect to the Groupâs employees and contractors through the application of stringent safety standards. These standards must continue to evolve as the Group continuously learns from experience, while ergonomic risks increase with the aging of populations, as regulations change, as machinery and equipment ages and as new technologies are progressively introduced at its sites. The Group is also proactively promoting the highest levels of safety culture within the new businesses it develops or acquires.\n\nAdditionally, to improve the manufacturing site environment, the Group is also implementing quick-impact investments that reflect the voices of employees who work at “Genba (on-site)” and are working to enhance benefits, improve the workplace environment, and reduce the workload.\n\nThe Group has been making further progress in developing opportunities for diverse talent to shine and take on various challenges through multiple initiatives. The Groupâs aim entails enhancing employee engagement, creating a new DNA in line with the value creation of the “Bridgestone E8 Commitment,” promoting culture change, and developing female leadership talent as well as arranging for assignment and placement of such talent. The eight words starting with the letter “E” set forth under the “Bridgestone E8 Commitment” symbolize the axis and guiding principle of Bridgestone-like value creation. They are incorporated into the Bridgestone Group Awards (BGA), the highest level of employee recognition in the Group, and the Total Quality Management (TQM) Conference as major review standards. They are also embedded into daily business and on-site improvement activities. Through engagement surveys and other surveys for gauging various attitudes and behaviors, the Group will visualize the progress and enhance the quality and level of its activities while implementing PDCA cycles.\n\nQuestions on Employee Engagement (commitment/motivation) and Employee Enablement (the right persons in the right positions/working environments to support employees) are answered using a six-point scale (Strongly Agree/ Agree/ Neutral/ Disagree/ Strongly Disagree/ Don't know or don't apply) to ascertain conditions across the company, in each department, and each workplace.\n\nGlobal respondent: 89% in the survey of 2023:\n\nRegional initiatives\n\nJapan\n\nIn Japan, Bridgestone is taking action to catch up with and bridge the disparities relative to the Groupâs overseas locations when it comes to engagement and the domain of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I).\n\nImprovement of employee engagement:\n\nIn 2020, Bridgestone switched from using the Employee Satisfaction Survey, which measures the level of satisfaction with working environments, to an Employee Engagement Survey, which measures employeesâ motivation to self-directed work and creating a sense of connection with the Company. In 2022, to more frequently implement PDCA cycles for its activities, the Company implemented a quarterly pulse survey to gauge the efficacy of activities and organizational conditions. By analyzing these results, recognizing that there are engagement issues compared to other regions, identifying issues, and making improvementsâand implementing this process in line with the characteristics of each organization and workplaceâthe Company is independently moving forward with activities to improve engagement and create better workplaces. The Company conducts the initiatives to improve employee engagement for value creation as follows:\n\nTraining in place of foundingã(Kurume visit)\n\nThe Company has introduced a training program in Kurume, the place of its founding, for newly appointed managers and new employees. This program helps to instill pride with respect to working for the Group, thereby providing an opportunity to further experience the founderâs thoughts, Bridgestone DNA and the Bridgestone Essence (corporate philosophy). The Company creates opportunities for not only employees working in Japan but also for members of Global EXCO and the participants of overseas business school training programs in \"Bridgestone NEXT100\", a program to develop the next-generation management leaders which includes employees from overseas locations.\n\nContinuous town hall meetings\n\nThe Company continues to provide opportunities for the management team and employees to interact through town hall meetings to motivate employees to contribute to the Company and grow, and also to reflect employeesâ opinions back into company operations.\n\nDevelopment of a foundation for DE&I promotion:\n\nIn order to develop a foundation for diverse talent to shine, the Company has been promoting a variety of initiatives unique to Bridgestone. This has entailed increasing focus on promoting the development and assignment of female leaders in seeking to respect diverse values and promote diversity in decision-making as an organization. This has also entailed developing a foundation for diverse talent to shine by arranging DE&I management workshops for all line managers and introducing a FemTech program to address women-specific health issues using technology. For further information, please refer to the website â “Respecting diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I)”.\n\nChina, Asia-Pacific region\n\nBSAPIC has made employee health and well-being a top priority with the philosophy “Safety First, Show Care and Stay Connected,” since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This philosophy has been fully embraced by regional group companies in all 10 countries and regions where BSAPIC operates and remains relevant today to drive performance while strongly supporting employee well-being by improving work-life balance.\n\nA cross-country task force\n\nBSAPIC created a cross-country task force in 2021 to develop regional guidelines on hybrid work and employee health and well-being to provide flexibility to BSAPICâs employees and promote work-life balance. Following the establishment of the regional framework in 2022, hybrid work was implemented in 2022 in all the BSAPIC group companies across the 10 countries and regions with localization to adapt to the dynamic situations in different countries and sites. Complementary guidelines on Meeting Management and After Working Hours Communications were also rolled out in the group companies to further reinforce support for employee work-life balance and well-being.\n\nRecognizing the value of the hybrid work model in promoting work-life balance and enhancing employee engagement, BSAPIC's group companies have chosen to maintain this work model. By offering employees the flexibility to work both remotely and on-site, BSAPIC reaffirms its commitment to fostering a supportive and inclusive workplace culture.\n\nBSAPIC has been actively engaged in assessing and enhancing employee engagement and its organizational culture through Employee Engagement Surveys. BSAPIC has steadily seen positive progression over the last five years in Employee Engagement Survey.\n\nThe results indicate that BSAPIC teammates are highly engaged and enabled, shows high levels of pride and commitment towards the organization, and enjoy an enabling environment that makes good use of their skills and abilities. These surveys serve as invaluable tools for understanding employee perspectives and driving continuous improvement initiatives across the organization.\n\nAmericas region\n\nBSAM is committed to cultivating a culture that promotes well-being to serve the diverse needs of its teams, helping them thrive. BSAM has learned to listen carefully, communicate often, form strategic partnerships, and continuously evolve to provide resources, strong benefit programs, and education that support employeesâ emotional, physical, and financial well-being. BSAM is also committed to equity in its benefit programs while ensuring health efficacy and removal of barriers to healthcare and well-being support for employees and their families.\n\nIn 2022, BSAM launched a Well-being Task Force with a focus on receiving feedback from well-being champions throughout BSAM to further enhance the programs in the future. In 2023, the team also partnered with Bridgestone employee resource groups (ERGs) and vendors to provide webinars on topics such as womenâs health and wellness, family goals and planning, suicide awareness for active members of the military and veterans and more. Furthermore, in 2023, BSAM continued to build upon its Well-being space by adding new benefit programs in support of the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of its employees. Each month, BSAM spotlighted a different well-being topic to provide employees with tools and resources to elevate their wellness. From proactive health engagement, managing stress, crisis and legal support, to planning for retirement or saving for a childâs college tuition, BSAM has an array of tools, resources, and partnerships to support employeesâ needs. Effective January 1, 2024, BSAM expanded its initiatives in the U.S. as follows:\n\nIncreased its paid Parental Leave time off for non-bargaining-unit hourly and salaried teammates\n\nImplemented a company-paid long-term disability benefit for non-bargaining-unit hourly and salaried teammates\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa region\n\nBSEMEA continued to conduct monthly pulse surveys to ask questions and quantitatively measure key drivers of its culture. The pulse survey has four strategic points â well-being, engagement, culture and collaboration â which drives targeted actions for improving lower scoring items. BSEMEA has made the conscious choice not to use other KPIs, opting instead to gather raw, honest data through its pulse survey. In the two years since adopting this approach, BSEMEA has seen a positive impact on well-being, engagement and culture in different employee groups. As one of the concrete activities, based on the survey result, BSEMEA has been working on employee well-being for the last two years through “B-Olympic” and led to a structured action plan focused on four topics: psychological well-being, social well-being, physical well-being and workplace environment.\n\nAlso, in manufacturing field, a structural cultural change management program has been implemented over the last years, which is named “B-ME” (Bridgestone Manufacturing Excellence) which has resulted in well-trained and empowered employees, autonomous teams and significantly better operational results. The “B-ME” program continues to be impactful in the development and empowerment of manufacturing teammates. The expansion of this program will continue.\n\nRegional initiatives\n\nJapan\n\nSince 2020, Bridgestone has rolled out its Human Resources Transformation (HRX) in stages. To date, the creation of HR system and mechanisms has been fundamental to these HRX initiatives. Moving forward, Bridgestone will seek to enhance its PDCA cycle. At the same time, it will accelerate various initiatives to support employee growth so that the growth of the Company and that of each and every employee goes hand in hand.\n\nSpecifically, once a year, employees have a C&D interview with their supervisors to clarify their thoughts on their career, work style, and growth. This interview provides an opportunity for employees to deepen their understanding of themselves and to concretize their career direction, the realization of value within the Company, and the actions they need to take for learning and challenges. Additionally, the Company provides the opportunity for employees to apply for a transfer or to take on a different challenge to encourage talent who are motivated to try a new job type or role.\n\nOpen Posting System\n\nThis system involves the Company clearly indicating the expectations and associated levels for positions that require challenging and diverse expertise. Employees with motivation can apply for these positions regardless of their current job title, and they are considered for assignment on an ongoing basis.\n\nJob-Matching System\n\nThis system allows employees to register their unique skills and experiences, acquired both internally and externally. It matches the specific skills, expertise, and knowledge required by departments with the skills and experiences of employees and facilitates their assignment in positions where they can utilize their skills and experiences at the appropriate timing.\n\nChina, Asia-Pacific region\n\nPerformance Development System\n\nBSAPIC recognizes the importance of nurturing a high-performing culture where every individual's potential is realized, contributing to the collective success. Central to this ethos is the robust Performance Development System (PDS), which serves as the cornerstone in driving excellence, growth, and alignment of individual aspirations with organizational goals.\n\nDuring the PDS journey, managers and employees communicate and align individual goals with the organizational objectives. Through continuous dialogue and feedback loops, BSAPIC prioritizes constructive coaching and guidance, empowering employees to enhance their performance and develop them to their full potential.\n\nCareer Development and Discussion (CD&D)\n\nBSAPIC 's CD&D process is a vital tool in the talent management strategy, fostering dialogue between employees and managers to align career aspirations with company goals. It empowers employees to create actionable Career Development Plans in consultation with their managers, driving personal career and organizational growth. The process is a continuous journey driven by the employee with the managerâs support. BSAPIC aspires to make its CD&D process available to all indirect employees. Since its inception in 2020, participation has surged from 500 to 2,400 employees in 2023. This process reflects the commitment to nurturing talent and fostering a culture of continuous development at BSAPIC.\n\nEmbodying the BSAPIC Talent Development Approach, managers collaborate with employees to design tailored development plans that leverage the 70-20-10 framework: 70% Experience, 20% Exposure, and 10% Education. Under the Experiential Learning, employees are provided with opportunities such as stretch assignments and cross-functional projects, enabling them to expand their skillsets and broaden their perspectives. Additionally, under the Coaching/Mentoring initiatives, including networking opportunities and executive coaching, foster a culture of continuous learning and mentorship.\n\nAt BSAPIC, the commitment to talent development is unwavering. Through PDS, CD&D and Talent Development Approach, BSAPIC strives to cultivate a culture of excellence, where each individual is empowered to thrive, driving sustainable growth and success for the organization as a whole.\n\nAmericas region\n\nPerformance management framework:\n\nBSAM believes its employees are the key to its success as an enterprise. To support them in delivering outstanding results, BSAM provides employees with access to a number of development opportunities and ongoing performance feedback throughout the year. To meet the needs of its evolving business, BSAMâs performance management framework called AMP (Accelerating My Performance), is designed to provide transparency and trust around the assessment of employees and the most important business priorities. Additionally, it ensures employees receive the ongoing feedback and support they need to achieve their professional goals.\n\nThrough AMP, BSAM has created an environment where employees and managers continuously communicate and share feedback to ensure employees are delivering great results and progressing on reaching their career goals. While goals should be reviewed and modified as often as needed, managers and employees typically have quarterly AMP Check-Ins to review individual performance and development goals and to discuss any changing priorities. In 2023, to further support a culture of continuous conversations, people managers were required to attend a virtual workshop focused on incorporating feedback into AMP conversations. A total of 25 workshops were conducted for over 700 people managers. BSAM will continue to evolve AMP over the coming years to further enhance the culture of agility, continuous performance and development feedback. AMP represents a shift to a more forward-looking talent management process that aligns with BSAMâs evolution toward a more agile, sustainable enterprise. With AMP, BSAM aims to increase retention, development and recognition to keep up with employee expectations.\n\nCareer development with more cross-region talent mobility\n\nBSAM continues to focus on helping leaders and employees have more robust and effective career discussions as well as more cross-region talent movement. BSAM also continues to expand its focus on succession planning, internal talent movement (talent brokerage), short-term assignments for development, and continuing to provide employees with access to a broad range of learning programs that suit both their personal aspirations and interests, and the critical capability needs of the business. In 2023, a Global Short-Term Assignment Policy in BSAM was developed that will further facilitate more cross-region talent movement.\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa region\n\nBSEMEA focuses on having clear, shared goals most importantly for talent development, so all employees know what to do and what to focus on. Goals are shared via the Organization Key Results (OKR) system, which ensures key priorities in the company are aligned between teams and employees know how to collaborate. Upon the above structure, BSEMEA provides continuous feedback to empower managers and employees in their development and performance. Performance is measured based on concrete business results (the “what”) and on the way people behave and achieve their results (the “how”). Its “Go Beyond” recognition system awards points to managers and employees that demonstrate good behaviors. Managers at BSEMEA hold regular review meetings to follow up on execution and motivate and develop team members.\n\nBridgestone Europe, Middle East and Africa (BSEMEA) considers the work of building a strong culture and empowering people as a continuous journey. Also, BSEMEA has addressed employee career development and engagement enhancement from various aspects.\n\nSelf-directed career development and personal growth\n\nBSEMEA has implemented the tools to support its employees in their development (example: 360-degree feedback, mentorship, targeted training paths with e-courses).\n\nEnsuring pay equity\n\nThe Groupâs talent strategy is centered on “creating a place where diverse talent can shine”. As the foundation for this, the Group ensures pay equity and designs its compensation programs to be competitive in each market based on regional and country-specific labor market trends and best practices.\n\nIn Japan, Bridgestoneâs compensation program establishes salaries according to \"role and responsibilities,\" \"ability to demonstrate,\" and \"achievement and growth,\" and the same compensation program is used for all employees regardless of their characteristics. Compensation levels are based on a survey conducted to ensure a competitive position in the market in talent acquisition and retention, and salary revisions are considered including their necessity each year based on social trends and other factors in Japan. In determining compensation for employees who are represented by labor unions, the Company holds labor management negotiations with the Bridgestone Labor Union every spring, and revises employee salaries in accordance with agreements reached. The Company holds labor management negotiations to maintain and ensure market competitiveness of its compensation levels, which are based on enhancing productivity and creativity, and to establish a compensation system that supports employees who are self-motivated to take on challenges and achieve growth. Regarding pay equity between male and female employees, there is a difference between male and female employees as a result of current talent portfolio in terms of job categories and the percentage of managerial positions, resulting in wage disparities. The Group is initiating efforts towards a more balanced talent portfolio, enhancing participation of female managers in key positions and strengthening recruitment of female employees, along with improving working environment at manufacturing sites as well.\n\nBSAPICâs compensation program aims to attract, motivate and retain the right talent with the right skills to be at the right position. Its major compensation programs, which include base pay, short- and long-term incentives, are designed to drive employee engagement and motivation, while fostering a performance-driven culture in alignment with both individual and company-wide objectives.\n\nRegular annual market reviews ensure the compensation programs remain competitive and relevant within the industry landscape, providing the employees with compensation packages that reflect their true worth. Moreover, each program undergoes thorough scrutiny and approval by the Succession, Nomination, and Compensation Committee of BSAPIC's Board of Directors on an annual basis, demonstrating the commitment to transparency and fairness.\n\nBSAPIC is dedicated to upholding pay equity for its employees, regardless of gender or any other differentiating factor. Factors such as experience, skills, market conditions, local legislation, and performance are carefully considered to ensure each employee is compensated fairly and in accordance with their contributions to the organization. Additionally, for employees represented by labor unions, BSAPIC adheres to all relevant conditions outlined in the labor agreement, further solidifying the commitment to equitable compensation practices.\n\nBSAMâs compensation program is committed to attracting, motivating and retaining employees who enable the company to achieve its short and long term business goals.

BSAM ensures pay equity through the job offer process, its annual compensation practices, and periodic internal compensation reviews. External market data is leveraged to evaluate and develop competitive pay structures, which are updated annually. Additionally, short-term and long-term incentive programs are utilized to meet business needs and offer market competitive total direct compensation. These programs are reviewed and approved annually by the Succession, Nomination & Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of BSAM.
