        "text": "First offenders with .08 to .14 blood alcohol level must have an ignition interlock for a period of six months.\n\nIf a first-time offender has a child of 14 years old or younger, has a BAC of 0.15 or higher, or causes an injury to another person, an ignition interlock device must be installed for 1 year, once their license has been returned to them. Second offenders have the same requirement, regardless of extenuating circumstances. A first time offender may also elect for an ignition interlock device for six months in lieu of the mandatory ninety-day license suspension. For third-time offenders the period is 3 years, and for fourth and subsequent offenses, the period is 5 years.\n\nThe court shall require any persons who are convicted of DUI to equip any motor vehicle the person operates with an ignition interlock device.\n\nThe court shall also require offenders to equip vehicles operated with ignition interlock devices for 1 year at the conclusion of the license suspension/revocation period or on the date of conviction whichever is later if (1) a second drunk driving offense occurs within 84 months; (2) a third or subsequent drunk-driving offense (aggravated driving under the influence ); (3) a drunk-driving offense where the offender is driving on a suspended or revoked license for a prior DWI offense or a prior admin. per se violation (AGDWI); (4) a first or second BAC of 0.15 offense; or, (5) a drunk-driving child endangerment offense.\n\nOffenders are eligible for an ignition interlock after 45 days of their license suspension if they wish to resume driving more quickly. For offenders who were convicted of driving with a BAC of 0.15 to 0.2, a judge may suspend all but 9 days of their jail time if they install an ignition interlock device. For drivers convicted of driving with a BAC greater than 0.2, a judge may suspend all but 14 days of their jail sentence if they install an interlock device.\n\nExemptions: Emergency.\n\nFor a first offense, offender's license will be revoked for 9 months, with the option after 1 month, to install an ignition interlock device and receive a limited license.\n\nA person with greater than BAC of 0.17 is classified as a “persistent drunk driver” and must use an ignition interlock for at least 1 year.\n\nFor either (1) an impaired, under the influence or illegal per se offense or (2) a habitual offender offense related to one of these alcohol offenses where there has been a previous alcohol driving offense conviction of any type within a 5-year period, an offender must install ignition interlock devices on the vehicles that person drives and is required to hold a restricted license for at least 1 year prior to full license reinstatement.\n\nA person who has had his driving privileges revoked for more than 1 year either for (1) driving while either impaired, under the influence or illegal per se or (2) an admin per se violation, is eligible for early license reinstatement with driving restrictions with the use of an ignition interlock device. The restrictions remain in effect for “the longer of 1 year or the total time period remaining on the license restraint prior to early reinstatement.”\n\nGeorgia law allows for first offenders to use an ignition interlock.\n\nSecond and subsequent offenders on probation must install ignition interlock devices on all of the vehicles they own and only operate vehicles equipped with such devices. Use begins when the offender is issued limited driving privileges and must last for at least 12 months.\n\nIf habitual offender status is based on two or more drunk-driving offense convictions and the offender is placed on probation, the use of a probationary license is conditioned of the use of an ignition interlock device for 6 months after the probationary license has been issued.\n\nAn ignition interlock device limited driving permit shall be restricted to allow the holder thereof to drive solely; to work, to school, regularly scheduled sessions or meetings of treatment support organizations, and monthly monitoring visits with the permit holder's ignition interlock device service provider.\n\nIf a court grants an exemption from the ignition interlock device requirements, such person shall not be eligible for a limited driving permit or any other driving privilege for a period of one year.\n\nExemptions: Financial hardship.\n\nA defendant whose alcohol concentration is .08 but not more than .10 shall not be eligible for any temporary restricted license for at least thirty days if a test was obtained and an accident resulting in injury or property damage occurred. The department shall require the defendant to install an ignition interlock device on all vehicles if the defendant seeks a temporary restricted license.\n\nA defendant whose alcohol concentration is more than .10 shall not be eligible for any temporary restricted license for at least thirty days if a test was obtained and an accident resulting in injury or property damage occurred or the defendant’s alcohol concentration exceeded .15. The department shall require the defendant to install an ignition interlock device on all vehicles if the defendant seeks a temporary restricted license.\n\nA second or subsequent offender, after the mandatory license revocation period, may be granted restricted driving privileges provided they install ignition interlock devices on all of the vehicles they own. Prior to reinstating the driving privileges to a second or subsequent offender, the State shall require such person to install ignition interlock devices on all of the vehicles they own for 1 year.\n\nFor either a first or subsequent refusal, a restricted license may be issued by the licensing agency provided the minimum period of license revocation has expired. A person must install an ignition interlock system on the vehicle(s) they operate as a condition for obtaining a restricted license.\n\nA person who tampers with or circumvents an ignition interlock device installed as required in this chapter and while the requirement for the ignition interlock device is in effect commits a serious misdemeanor.\n\nFirst offense, BAC over 0.08: a 30-day suspension followed by 6 months of ignition interlock device if your record is clear OR 12 months of interlock if you have a prior open container violation or three or more moving violations.\n\nFailure of a breath test with a result of BAC over 0.15 the first time, or over 0.08 on a second or subsequent occurrence is a 1 year suspension followed by ignition interlock (length of interlock is dependent on priors).\n\nRefusal of a breath, blood or urine test is a 1-year suspension, followed by ignition interlock requirement (length of interlock is dependent on priors), regardless of how many prior Kansas DUI occurrences a person has.\n\nThose that are required to install ignition interlocks for 10 years may petition the court after 5 years to have it removed.\n\nDriver with an ignition interlock can drive vehicle only for the purposes of getting to and from: Work, school or an alcohol treatment program; and the ignition interlock provider for maintenance and downloading of data from the device.\n\nTampering or circumventing the ignition interlock device is a class A, nonperson misdemeanor: first conviction, restriction extended 90 days; second or subsequent conviction, restart the original restriction period.\n\nExemptions: Employer.\n\nAs a condition of license reinstatement, the Secretary of State may require a person to install in the motor vehicle the person operates for a period of up to 2 years an ignition interlock device. The license of a person with one OUI offense may be reinstated after 30 days of the suspension period has run if the person has installed for a period of 150 days or the length of time remaining for an ignition interlock device approved by the Secretary of State in the motor vehicle the person operates.\n\nThe license of a person with 2 OUI offenses, convictions or adjudications may be reinstated after 2 years if the person installs for a period of 9 months an ignition interlock device approved by the Secretary of State in the motor vehicle the person operates. The license of a person with 3 OUI offenses, convictions or adjudications may be reinstated after 3 years if the person installs for a period of 3 years an ignition interlock device. The license of a person with 4 or more OUI offenses, convictions or adjudications may be reinstated after 4 years if the person installs for a period of 4 years an ignition interlock device approved by the Secretary of State in the motor vehicle the person operates.\n\nAs a condition of probation, the court may order a defendant for 1-3 years to operate only vehicles equipped with ignition interlock devices. If defendant registers a BAC of 0.15 or more, the court must order ignition interlock for at least 1 year.\n\nThe licensing agency may establish an ignition interlock program for persons who have been convicted of alcohol-related driving offenses. This program does not apply to persons who have been convicted of driving while under the influence of a controlled substance. A person who is subject to license suspension via the point system for a conviction of DWI may be issued a restricted license by participating in the Ignition Interlock Program. A person who is subject to license revocation following a conviction for either DWI or for DUI may have the license suspended in lieu of revocation by participating in the ignition interlock program. The suspension periods (or restricted license) imposed are the same as for DWI. A fourth or subsequent offender is considered a “habitual offender” and he cannot have his driving privileges restored until he has participated in this program for at least 24 months.\n\nExemptions: Employer.\n\nA judge is not required to sentence a person as provided in this section if the judge requires the person as a condition of probation to drive only motor vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device meeting the standards described in section 171.306. First offenders may apply for conditional reinstatement of the driver's license, subject to the ignition interlock restriction.\n\nSecond or subsequent offenders may apply for a limited license, subject to the ignition interlock restriction, if the program participant is enrolled in a licensed chemical dependency treatment or rehabilitation program as recommended in a chemical use assessment, and if the participant meets the other applicable requirements of section 171.30.\n\nTampering or attempting to circumvent the interlock system: 180 days for a first violation; 1 year for a second violation; or 545 days for a third and each subsequent violation.\n\nSubd. 4. Issuance of restricted license. (a) The commissioner shall issue a class D driver's license, subject to the applicable limitations and restrictions of this section, to a program participant who meets the requirements of this section and the program guidelines. The commissioner shall not issue a license unless the program participant has provided satisfactory proof that:\n\n(1) a certified ignition interlock device has been installed on the participant's motor vehicle at an installation service center designated by the device's manufacturer; and\n\n(2) the participant has insurance coverage on the vehicle equipped with the ignition interlock device. If the participant has previously been convicted of violating section 169.791, 169.793, or 169.797 or the participant's license has previously been suspended or canceled under section 169.792 or 169.797, the commissioner shall require the participant to present an insurance identification card that is certified by the insurance company to be noncancelable for a period not to exceed 12 months.\n\n(b) A license issued under authority of this section must contain a restriction prohibiting the program participant from driving, operating, or being in physical control of any motor vehicle not equipped with a functioning ignition interlock device certified by the commissioner. A participant may drive an employer-owned vehicle not equipped with an interlock device while in the normal course and scope of employment duties pursuant to the program guidelines established by the commissioner and with the employer's written consent.\n\nExemption: Employer. Exception not allowed for violations causing bodily harm.\n\nAt the expiration of 30 days (60 days if test refused) after an order of administrative license revocation for 90 days is entered, any person who submitted to a chemical test which disclosed the presence of a concentration of alcohol in violation of the statutory limit is eligible for an order to allow application for an ignition interlock permit to operate a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device upon presentation of sufficient evidence to the Department of Motor Vehicles that such a device is installed.\n\nAs an alternative to vehicle disablement, the court shall order the convicted person, in order to operate a motor vehicle, to obtain an ignition interlock permit and install an ignition interlock device on each of the motor vehicles owned or operated by the convicted person if he or she was sentenced to an operator's license revocation of at least 1 year and has completed at least 1 year of such revocation.\n\nThose without prior records may operate their ignition interlock equipped vehicle only to work, school, a substance abuse treatment center, a parole meeting, to a healthcare facility, or to community service.\n\nThose with a record may only drive to school, work, or to a treatment facility.\n\nPersons under 18 years of age shall not be eligible for an ignition interlock permit.\n\nTampering or attempting to circumvent the interlock shall, in addition to any possible criminal charges, have his or her revocation period and ignition interlock permit extended for 6 months beyond the end of the original revocation period.\n\n3. Any person who commits a violation of this section after having been convicted of a felony offense pursuant to the provisions of this section or a violation pursuant to the provisions of any law of this state or another state prohibiting the offenses provided for in this section, Section 11-904 of this title or paragraph 4 of subsection A of Section 852.1 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes shall be guilty of a felony and participate in an assessment and evaluation pursuant to subsection G of this section and shall be sentenced to:\n\na. follow all recommendations made in the assessment and evaluation for treatment at the defendant's expense, two hundred forty (240) hours of community service and use of an ignition interlock device, as provided by subparagraph n of paragraph 1 of subsection A of Section 991a of Title 22 of the Oklahoma Statutes, or\n\nb. placement in the custody of the Department of Corrections for not less than one (1) year and not to exceed ten (10) years and a fine of not more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), or\n\nc. treatment, imprisonment and a fine within the limitations prescribed in subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph.\n\nHowever, if the treatment in subsection G of this section does not include residential or inpatient treatment for a period of not less than ten (10) days, the person shall serve a term of imprisonment of at least ten (10) days.\n\n4. Any person who commits a violation of this section after having been twice convicted of a felony offense pursuant to the provisions of this section or a violation pursuant to the provisions of any law of this state or another state prohibiting the offenses provided for in this section, Section 11-904 of this title or paragraph 4 of subsection A of Section 852.1 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes shall be guilty of a felony and participate in an assessment and evaluation pursuant to subsection G of this section and shall be sentenced to:\n\na. follow all recommendations made in the assessment and evaluation for treatment at the defendant's expense, followed by not less than one (1) year of supervision and periodic testing at the defendant's expense, four hundred eighty (480) hours of community service, and use of an ignition interlock device, as provided by subparagraph n of paragraph 1 of subsection A of Section 991a of Title 22 of the Oklahoma Statutes, for a minimum of thirty (30) days, or\n\nb. placement in the custody of the Department of Corrections for not less than one (1) year and not to exceed twenty (20) years and a fine of not more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), or\n\nc. treatment, imprisonment and a fine within the limitations prescribed in subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph.\n\nHowever, if the person does not undergo residential or inpatient treatment pursuant to subsection G of this section the person shall serve a term of imprisonment of at least ten (10) days.\n\n(d)(1)(i) Every person found to have violated subsection (b)(1) shall be sentenced as follows: for a first violation whose blood alcohol concentration is eight one-hundredths of one percent (.08%), but less than one-tenth of one percent (.1%), by weight, or who has a blood presence of any scheduled controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of title 21, shall be subject to a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100), nor more than three hundred dollars ($300); shall be required to perform ten (10) to sixty (60) hours of public community restitution, and/or shall be imprisoned for up to one year. The sentence may be served in any unit of the adult correctional institutions in the discretion of the sentencing judge and/or shall be required to attend a special course on driving while intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance; provided, however, that the court may permit a servicemember or veteran to complete any court-approved counseling program administered or approved by the Veterans' Administration, and his or her driver's license shall be suspended for thirty (30) days up to one hundred eighty (180) days. The sentencing judge or magistrate may prohibit that person from operating a motor vehicle, pursuant to subsection (d)(9) or 2(d)(10) of this section, that is not equipped with an ignition interlock system and/or blood and urine testing as provided in § 31-27-2.8.\n\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles shall require a person who is convicted of violating the provisions of Sections 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, 56-5-2945, 56-5-2947 except if the conviction was for Section 56-5-750, or a law of another state that prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or who is issued a temporary alcohol license pursuant to Section 56-1-286 or 56-5-2951, to have installed on any motor vehicle the person drives, except a moped or motorcycle, an ignition interlock device designed to prevent driving of the motor vehicle if the person has consumed alcoholic beverages. This requirement shall not apply to a person who submitted to a breath test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950 and had an alcohol concentration of .00 one hundredths of one percent.\n\nThe department may waive the requirements of this section if the department determines that the person has a medical condition that makes the person incapable of properly operating the installed device. If the department grants a medical waiver, the department shall suspend the person's driver's license for the length of time that the person would have been required to hold an ignition interlock restricted license. The department may withdraw the waiver at any time that the department becomes aware that the person's medical condition has improved to the extent that the person has become capable of properly operating an installed device.\n\nThe department also shall require a person who has enrolled in the Ignition Interlock Device Program in lieu of the remainder of a driver's license suspension, denial of license to operate a vehicle as an habitual offender pursuant to Section 56-1-1090, or denial of the issuance of a driver's license or permit to have an ignition interlock device installed on any motor vehicle the person drives, except a moped or motorcycle.\n\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles shall suspend the driver's license of a person who is convicted for a violation of Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or a law of another state that prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.\n\n(2) For a first offense, a person shall enroll in the Ignition Interlock Device Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2941, end the suspension, and obtain an ignition interlock restricted license pursuant to Section 56-1-400. The ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle for six months.

The ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle for two years.\n\n(4) For a third offense, a person shall enroll in the Ignition Interlock Device Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2941, end the suspension, and obtain an ignition interlock restricted license pursuant to Section 56-1-400. The ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle for three years. If the third offense occurs within five years from the date of the first offense, the ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle for four years.\n\n(5) For a fourth or subsequent offense, a person shall enroll in the Ignition Interlock Device Program pursuant to Section 56-5-2941, end the suspension, and obtain an ignition interlock restricted license pursuant to Section 56-1-400. The ignition interlock device is required to be affixed to the motor vehicle for life.\n\nA person convicted of any DUI offense, when applying for and the court orders the issuance of a restricted motor vehicle operator’s license, must operate only a motor vehicle that is equipped with a functioning ignition interlock device. The order is a condition of probation if at the time of the offense, the defendant:\n\n(1) Has a blood or breath alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or higher;\n\n(2) Is accompanied by a person under 18 years of age;\n\n(3) Is involved in a traffic accident for which notice to law enforcement is required under present law and the accident is the proximate result of the person's intoxication; or\n\n(4) Is in violation of the implied consent law, and has a conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication for a violation that occurred within five years of the instant implied consent violation, for implied consent, underage driving while impaired, the open container law, or reckless driving if the charged offense was DUI.\n\nAn ignition interlock device must be in operation during the entire time period a restricted license is effectuated and must continue to be in operation six months after the license revocation period has expired. The license suspension periods are the following:\n\n(1)First offense: one year\n\n(2) Second offense: two years\n\n(3) Third offense: six years\n\n(4) Fourth or subsequent offense: eight years.\n\nIf a person convicted of a DUI has a prior DUI conviction within the past five years, then, after the revocation period, the person may only operate only a motor vehicle that is equipped with a functioning interlock device for one year and such requirement is a condition of the person's probation. For a second DUI violation within ten years, the installation of an ignition interlock device is mandatory.\n\nNo geographic restriction requirements for restricted licenses.\n\nExemption: Employment.\n\n(a) (1) First offense. A person whose license or privilege to operate is suspended or revoked under this subchapter may operate a motor vehicle, other than a commercial motor vehicle as defined in section 4103 of this title, if issued a valid ignition interlock RDL or ignition interlock certificate. Upon application, the Commissioner shall issue an ignition interlock RDL or ignition interlock certificate to a person otherwise licensed or eligible to be licensed to operate a motor vehicle if:\n\n(D) the applicable period set forth below has passed since the suspension or revocation was imposed if the offense involved refusal of an enforcement officer's reasonable request for an evidentiary test:\n\n(i) 30 days for a first offense;\n\n(ii) 90 days for a second offense;\n\n(iii) one year for a third or subsequent offense.\n\nPersons who elect to obtain an ignition interlock RDL following a conviction under this subchapter when the person's BAC is 0.16 or more shall be required to install an ignition interlock device with a Global Positioning System feature.\n\nSecond or subsequent offenders must install an ignition interlock device for 18 months before a driver's license will be reinstated.\n\nTampering or attempting to circumvent the interlock is a criminal offense and if convicted the period of use is extended by 6 months.\n\nThe court shall order any person convicted of an alcohol-related violation or an equivalent local ordinance to apply for an ignition interlock driver's license and to have a functioning ignition interlock device installed on all motor vehicles operated by the person. The court may also order the installation of an interlock device for a driver that is convicted of reckless or negligent driving within 7 years of an alcohol-related driving offense. An ignition interlock may be required for reckless or negligent drivers without a prior DUI conviction. An ignition interlock device will be required for any driver convicted of vehicular homicide while driving under the influence. If a minor passenger was in the vehicle at the time of the DUI offense, the use of an ignition interlock device is extended by six months.\n\nThe court may waive the requirement that a person obtain an ignition interlock driver's license and operate only vehicles equipped with a functioning ignition interlock device if the court makes a specific finding in writing that the devices are not reasonably available in the local area, that the person does not operate a vehicle, or the person is not eligible to receive an ignition interlock driver's license.\n\nFor a person who has not previously been restricted, the device shall be installed for a period of 1 year; for a second restriction, a period of 5 years; for a third or subsequent restriction, a period of 10 years. The driver may apply for day-for-day credit towards the period of license revocation for use of an interlock device, as long as the device is installed in all non-exempt vehicles the driver operates.\n\nA person receiving an ignition interlock driver's license waives his or her right to a hearing or appeal under RCW 46.20.308. If a minor passenger was in the vehicle at the time of the DUI offense, the use of an ignition interlock device is extended by six months.\n\nExemption: Employer.\n\nAn individual convicted of driving under the influence must participate in the State’s Alcohol Test and Lock Program (ATLP). Part of the ATLP is use of an ignition interlock device (IID). Within sixty (60) days of installing an IID through a state-approved service provider, individuals must enroll in the ATLP. An IID must be installed on all vehicles owned or operated by the offender.\n\nAn ignition interlock device must be installed for the following time periods:\n\n(1) First time offender with a BAC between .08 and .15: at least one hundred and twenty-five days.\n\n(2) First offense for refusing a test: at least one year.\n\n(3)First offense with a BAC < .15: at least two hundred and seventy days.\n\n(4) First offense resulting in the death of another person: at least two years.\n\n(5) First offense resulting in serious bodily harm to another person: at least one year.\n\n(6) First offense with a minor in the vehicle: at least ten months.\n\nSubsequent admin per se violation or DWI offense and second or subsequent refusal: The ignition interlock must be used for 2 years.\n\nFor a first conviction where the conviction is based on the person having BAC of 0.15 or more, operate only vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device for a period of 6 months from the date of conviction;\n\nFor a second conviction, operate only vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device, for a period of 1 year from the date of conviction;\n\nFor a third conviction, operate only vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device, for a period of 2 years from the date of conviction;\n\nFor a fourth or subsequent conviction, operate only vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device, for the remainder of the offender's life, except 5 years from the date of conviction and every 5 years thereafter, the offender may apply to the court for removal of the ignition interlock device required by this paragraph. The court may, for good cause shown, remove the ignition interlock device requirement if the offender has not been subsequently convicted of driving a motor vehicle in violation of this section or other law prohibiting driving while under the influence.\n\nIf a person fails to submit to all required chemical tests requested by the peace officer shall result in the suspension of his Wyoming driver's license or his privilege to operate a motor vehicle for a period of 6 months for a first offense or 18 months for a second or subsequent offense and he may be required to drive only vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device.\n\nExemption: Employer."
