        "text": "Pennsylvania law makes the Ignition Interlock requirement mandatory for first-time DUI offenders with high blood alcohol levels, repeat DUI offenders, individuals who refuse chemical testing, and for illegally operating a motor vehicle not equipped with an Ignition Interlock system.\n\nAn Ignition Interlock system is a device that is installed on motor vehicles to prohibit an individual under the influence of alcohol from operating the vehicle. An individual is required to blow into the device before starting the vehicle. If the device detects alcohol, it will prevent the vehicle from starting. In addition, at random times during the operation of the vehicle, the individual will be prompted to blow into the device to ensure they are not under the influence."
