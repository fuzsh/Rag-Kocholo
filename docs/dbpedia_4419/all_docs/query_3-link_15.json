        "text": "How much does training cost?\n\nDue to factors like differences in course topic or duration, prices may vary. Please refer to the course details for more information.\n\nDoes attending a training course include Ignition Certification?\n\nYes, you can earn certification by attending Inductive Automation and Distributor-led training classes. Ignition Core Training courses grant Core Certification while advanced courses like Perspective and Databases and Scripting grant Gold Certification (Gold Certification can only be earned if you are already Core Certified).\n\nWhat are Authorized Training Providers (ATP)?\n\nThe Authorized Training Provider (ATP) program extends the reach of Ignition training by partnering with qualified organizations from all over the world. ATPs are led by Ignition experts who have been certified in Ignition and authorized to use official training materials developed by Inductive Automation. Inductive Automation will only endorse courses from centers that meet our standards for quality. ATP courses do not grant Ignition Certification.\n\nCan I become certified through an Authorized Training Provider (ATP) course?\n\nNo. Authorized Training Provider (ATP) courses do not grant certification for either Core or Gold levels and cannot be taken in place of Inductive Automation or distributor-led classes.\n\nHow long does my certification last?\n\nThere's no annual fee for certification, and all certification levels are granted for a three year period starting when your certification is earned. When your expiration nears, you can sign up for a shorter certification update class, or take a test that covers pertinent new material.\n\nQuestions or concerns about the test?\n\nPlease contact Training at training@inductiveautomation.com.\n\nI purchased a Core Certification Test. How long do I have to complete it?\n\nCore Certification tests must be completed within 30 days of the date of purchase. If you’ve purchased a test and are unable to complete it in the allotted time, contact training@inductiveautomation.com.\n\nWhat’s the difference between an IU Credential and Ignition Certification?\n\nAn IU Credential is awarded upon completion of the free online courses at Inductive University. The purpose of an IU Credential is to help showcase your Ignition knowledge, individually or as part of the Integrator Program. Ignition Certification is not granted through Inductive University and can only be earned through training classes offered by IA and authorized Ignition distributors or a certification test. The purpose of Ignition Certification is to help establish individuals and integrators as experts in the platform and is required for any integrator before achieving Certified, Gold, and Premier status.\n\nIs an IU Credential required before becoming certified?\n\nNo. While we recommend completing the courses offered at Inductive University to familiarize yourself with topics addressed in training, a credential is not required to become certified.\n\nAre test discounts available for universities in IA's Educational Engagement Program?\n\nProfessors teaching Ignition to their students as part of our Educational Engagement Program are eligible to receive a free certification test (Core or Gold). This free test must be approved by the Educational Engagement Program Manager.\n\nWhere can I find more information on the content of Certification Tests and training courses?\n\nCore and Gold Certification Test study guides, as well as training course itineraries, can be found at training.inductiveautomation.com."
