They tackle strategic and core operational issues and provide practical and innovative solutions that increase revenue, reduce costs, boost productivity, and streamline processes. They are experts in their field.\n\nThere are many types of consultants and consulting firms. Niche or boutique firms focus on a particular industry, such as financial services or health care, or specialize in recommending solutions for a specific area, such as consumer marketing or information technology. Larger firms provide a full range of management consulting services. Independent consultants specialize in a particular area.\n\nFoster is abundant with opportunities that will help you decide if consulting is the right career path for you and, if it is, how best to prepare.\n\nSince the consulting field is vast and covers nearly every type of industry and function, you need to take a look at your interests, strengths and skills. Understanding where you would be the happiest and most successful starts with understanding yourself.\n\nTypically, consulting firms value individuals with experience in project management and in developing and delivering client-facing presentations. Being able to research and solve problems using analysis as well as creative thinking are important skills to illustrate in interviews. Interpersonal and relationship building skills are equally as important as analytical problem-solving skills. Some specialized consulting firms look for experience in a particular industry (such as healthcare). The willingness and ability to travel frequently is often a requirement, especially for larger firms.\n\nAs you research the industry, look for the types of consulting and firms that would match best with your experience and interests. Start a list of firms that interest you and then research them further. Engage in informational interviews to get the inside scoop on what it is really like to work at that company. As you discover more, you will narrow down your list to your top firms – those that attract you most because of their types of customers, kinds of projects, company size, corporate culture, and any other qualities that are important to you.\n\nCheck out the online resources below to learn more about the field of consulting.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics overview and outlook\n\nFreakonomics podcast\n\nVault overview\n\nIn order to really understand an industry and speak their language, regularly read their latest publications and join their professional associations.

At Revel, I’m part of an accomplished and experienced team where we push each other daily to think in new and innovative ways. Our culture is one we’re constantly collaborating and learning in, and also have a lot of fun doing it along the way. I can say I have more than colleagues at Revel – I have lifelong friends here.”\n\nBrad Wang\n\nSenior Associate, Revel Consulting\n\nUW MBA, Class of 2004\n\n“Effectiveness as a consultant required developing meaningful professional relationships with the client at whatever level I was at…and as project opportunities arose I tried to visualize myself in the key client decision maker’s role and bring the best ideas and people that the firm offers…even if the best person for the task at hand wasn’t me, my role was to make sure the project was successful from the client’s perspective. Success in such a role required a combination of relationship, consensus building, communication and technical skills.”\n\nKen Dixon\n\nFormer Partner and Consultant\n\nDeloitte\n\nBusiness Analysis and Data Science\n\nAll MBA careers require the ability to use data effectively. However some roles are dedicated to scrutinizing data-based information to provide recommendations that assist senior leadership in making decisions. These positions are found in nearly all functions and industries. Some of the MBA titles you’ll come across are business analysts, digital marketing analysts, financial analysts, operations analysts and market research analysts.\n\nTraditionally data analysts have been concerned with structured data from a single database source; however the use of unstructured data from multiple sources – “Big Data” – has given new depth and complexity to data analysis. Companies that have the technical capabilities to harness the multitudes of unstructured data need individuals who can ask the right business questions, analyze the resulting data effectively, and understand the appropriate statistical techniques.\n\nWhether a business analyst or a big data analytics expert, these roles require business acumen, database and analysis skills, communications and presentation skills, and often some coding abilities such as SQL, or statistics software experience such as R or SPSS. Data scientists typically have Ph.D.s in Statistics or Computer Science.\n\nIndustry knowledge in a particular field is a plus, and may be required by some employers. Business and data analysts are found in all industries, from non-profits, government and education, to high-tech, finance, and consumer products.\n\nCheck out these on-line resources to learn more about the field of business analysis and data science.\n\nIf you enjoy working data in different ways, exploring the stories that data may reveal, and even experimenting with visualization techniques, you may enjoy a role in data science. Data analysis is necessary in almost every field and industry and analysts with MBAs are expected to play a role in guiding strategic decisions. They are in a unique position to assist leaders in determining the right questions to ask as well as in interpreting the answers that data provides to help determine the organization’s most effective courses of action.\n\nDiscover more about different types of business analysts by exploring the resources listed below.\n\nBridging the Gap blog (changing careers to business analyst)\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics Financial and Market Research Analysts\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics Operations Research Analysts\n\nVideo: What Does a Data Scientist Do?\n\nThese Are the Skills You Need to Be a Data Scientist at Facebook\n\nWhat Is Big Data?\n\nWisegeek: What Does a Data Analyst Do?\n\nGlassdoor’s The 10 Best Jobs in America in 2017\n\nIn order to really understand an industry and speak their language, regularly read their latest publications and join their professional associations.

The real business successes, I believe, will come from those folks who embrace data, not as a static asset such as a report or dashboard, but rather as an enabler of an exploratory journey into the information unknown.”\n\nNick Choat\n\nformer Vice President, Big Data Analytics and Digital Advertising Technology\n\nWalt Disney Company\n\n“The most enjoyable part of my role as a Business Analyst is the investment analysis piece.

It sounds like we barely scratch the surface of what we can do with data.\n\nI work in a digital marketing agency as a Manager in Data Science. For me, it is fascinating to work on some of the coolest projects, using the latest technology stack. It would be interesting to see more and more business invest in Data Analytics / Data Science capability as a strategic initiative and hire data-centric MBAs to accelerate the journey as we move forward. Foster MBA helps me connect the dots faster from quantitative and qualitative dimensions along with the latest technology stacks. It is crucial to have both the data and the context to tell a wonderful story.
