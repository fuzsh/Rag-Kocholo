        "text": "Job Description\n\nHello, Good Geeky Citizen!\n\nAre you tired of living half your life in a drab gray cubicle working with drab gray people?\n\nWouldn't it be nice to work from the comfort of your own gaming chair within easy reach of your espresso maker?\n\nIgnition, Inc. (www.ignitionit.com) is seeking an IT Help Desk Master of Disaster to work from the comfort of your own home, and we hope that person is you!\n\nABOUT IGNITION\n\nWe're a 23-year-old I.T. Managed Services Provider based in San Francisco. Currently, our team is 11 people.\n\nWe serve businesses of between 20 to 250 people, with a unique (but not exclusive) focus on cybersecurity, mobile and remote workforce technologies, and macOS.\n\nBut really, we're the anti-MSP: We're not stuffy. We're not stiff. There's no uniform. Most of us dislike Windows even if we support it all the time. Our motto is \"49% tech support, 51% human support.\" We hire people with deep emotional I.Q. instead of folks with lots of certifications that start with the letter M.\n\nOur customers feel the difference. They enjoy working with us, as you will, too.\n\nOur employee turnover is practically zero. Folks enjoy working at Ignition. We respect your humanity because we share it.\n\nABOUT THIS JOB\n\nOur Help Desk is drowning, and we need more talented folks like you to get in there with swinging elbows! Some of your duties will include:\n\nTriage incoming support requests, making sure the most urgent ones get attended to, the clients get replied to, and nothing gets ignored\n\nAnswer the Help Desk phone either resolve support issues independently, collaborate with your colleagues, or escalate to someone else\n\nAssist our other engineers in resolving the issues they're working on\n\nWhen you see balls start to approach the floor, scream like a motherf**ker and make sure somebody grabs them before they hit!\n\nBut, be forewarned: we do NOT have a formal training program. We're not going to send you to Microsoft Universityâ„¢ to get a bunch of useless certs. You'll learn like the rest of us learned: in the trenches, asking questions and hoping that somebody else on our team has a couple minutes to give you an answer. Thus, you'd better be a quick learner, able to do your own research and devise your own curriculum... and you'd better hurry because the client is on the phone and it's 6:00 on a Friday evening and you are late for your own wedding!\n\n(Just kidding. If you were getting married, we'd cover for ya.)\n\nTHE IDEAL CANDIDATE\n\nThis position is ideal for someone with a few years of IT troubleshooting and tech support experience, either formal or informal.\n\nWhile we don't require formal I.T. work experience, we do require demonstrable tech savvy and mighty, earth-shattering Google Fu. Our interview process will test your ability to find answers to questions about which you know nothing. It's less important that you get the answers 100% correct than that you demonstrate that you know how to find them with minimal guidance.\n\nIn addition to being a geek-minded hobbyist and tinkerer, you should be warm, friendly, and empathetic. Only 49% of our job is technical support: the remaining 51% is human support, helping our clients feel well-fed and productive with their technology. If people can hear the smile in your voice over the phone, they'll forgive you for not immediately knowing all the answers.\n\nBASIC REQUIREMENTS\n\nBe available to work full time, weekdays from 9:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. Eastern time\n\nBe a naturally friendly person who's easy to work with\n\nWrite clear, useful technical documentation, and clear, articulate end-user correspondence\n\nHave a quiet place in your home from which you can work, with reliable Internet\n\nCOMPENSATION\n\nWe pay on an hourly basis according to your experience. We also provide medical, dental, and vision insurance; a 401(k) plan; holiday, sick, and vacation pay; stipends, and an annual bonus.\n\nTO APPLY\n\nVisit https://forms.gle/T6NCzuw6cJpaJZCB8\n\nSEE YA SOON\n\nIgnition is an equal opportunity employer supporting diverse workplaces. We look forward to considering all qualified applicants. Thanks for reading!"
