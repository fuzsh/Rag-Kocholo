        "text": "No. In order for time to count toward your restriction, an IID “P” restriction must be placed on the driving record and license reinstated. Customers must visit a driver license service center or tax collector office after having an IID installed to have the “P” restriction added. The cost to reinstate can be found on the fee page.\n\nIn order to reinstate a driver license, the customer must have an IID installed in a vehicle that he/she owns and/or routinely operates. There is no reinstatement provision for people who do not own and/or routinely operate a vehicle.\n\nIf the customer meets the IID requirements, holds a valid license with a “P” restriction, and has written permission from the employer, the person may operate the employer’s vehicle for job-related purposes without the required IID. The letter granting permission from the employer is to be kept with the vehicle and provided to law enforcement should the individual be stopped for a traffic violation.\n\nYes. However, if there are any outstanding insurance, child support, or failure to pay (D6) suspensions, the license plate cannot be issued. These suspensions must be cleared on the driver record before a plate can be issued.\n\nNo. They will have up to three minutes to give a breath sample before the alarm sounds. If the individual is uncomfortable with giving a sample while driving, this will allow plenty of time to pull over.\n\nMost likely, if the mouthwash contains alcohol, the device will register it. The level at which it will register can vary. If the level is high enough to prevent the car from starting, the customer will need to rinse their mouth out with water and wait for the five minute retest. It is important to take the retest. By passing the retest, the device will identify the first test as latent alcohol. Failure to take and/or pass the retest will result in a violation.\n\nThe IID alcohol threshold is set at a 0.025 blood alcohol level (BAL) reading, if convicted after July 1, 2013. Anything above this level will not allow the vehicle to start.\n\nThe IID alcohol threshold is set at a 0.050 BAL, if convicted before July 1, 2013. Anything above will not allow the vehicle to start.\n\nAny two breath test results above the mandated BAL upon initial startup of the vehicle; any refusal to submit to a required rolling retest (missed test); any rolling retest above the mandated BAL; or any evidence of equipment tampering.\n\nContact a licensed DUI program serves the county where the customer lives, works, or attends school within 10 days of the date of the letter to schedule an appointment. The DUI program will review the use of the IID with the customer and discuss the circumstances related to the notification.\n\nInform the IID provider prior to having the vehicle repaired, then present the receipt at the next monthly appointment. Note, any time the battery is disconnected due to service work, the customer must bring a repair receipt to the next monthly appointment.\n\nCustomers must surrender their license before a provider will remove an IID. Customers may go to a driver license office or tax collector office and request to voluntarily surrender their license. Customers will be given proof that they have surrendered their license and must present it to the provider for them to remove the IID. Please be aware that if the IID is removed prior to the expiration date on the restriction, customers may be required to start their restriction time over without credit for past compliance."
