Most jobs in local government fall under the Civil Service system. A \"Civil Service\" employee can be anyone from a secretary, a nurse, a mechanic or a supervisor for a department. Different jobs have different requirements. Some jobs require that you take an examination to be considered for a permanent job. These are called competitive positions. There are three types of positions that have no examination requirements:\n\nExempt positions are those where the employer decides the qualifications of applicants and chooses the person they want to hire. The process is similar to that found in private industry.\n\nNon-competitive positions have specific education and experience requirements that you must meet. Employers choose from among the qualified people who apply.\n\nLabor positions have no requirements. Employers may choose anyone for these jobs.\n\nMost of the positions in Oneida County departments, towns, villages, school districts, (except cities of Rome, Utica and Sherrill), Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, Mohawk Valley Community College, (except education positions), and Mohawk Valley Water Authority are filled by one of the above criteria.\n\nIf you are interested in a tested or a non-tested position, you must complete the same application, available from this website or the Oneida County Department of Personnel."
