        "text": "Hi All -\n\nLong time lurker, first time poster...I have pictures to help newbie questions\n\nConfiguration: Lochinvar FTXL boiler (LP) two years old, Ecobee Thermostats\n\nProblem: Starting about a week ago, I started receiving an increase in lockout messages, both \"flame fail ignition\" and \"flame fail running.\" Also during that same time period, I started to see anomalies on the thermostat: after several hours of the temperature behaving as expected (within 1 degree of the set point), there were long (more than an hour) periods in which the thermostat was calling for heat but the temperature continued to drift down (as low as 5 degrees below the set point) before heating resumed. I started to poke around a bit this weekend, and noticed an increasing discrepancy between ignition attempts and successful ignitions. I suspect that these are related, but there is not a 1:1 correlation so I can't be certain.\n\nI have attached pics of the lockout history, temp, and ignition attempts/successes below to show you what's going on.\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1) Are the ignition attempts/success related to the lockouts? I assume that there must be more than \"x\" failures before triggering the lockout condition which would explain what I'm seeing. Correct?\n\n2) What might cause the somewhat random behavior seen here? Most of the time it works fine. And then it doesn't. Then it does. I would think that if it was gas pressure then the errors would be more consistent?\n\n3) The working theory is that the ignition module is beginning to fail. Does that make sense, and would that fail intermittently before failing completely?\n\n4) This problem has been seen over the past week or so during very cold weather. Might that impact?\n\nI have a very simplistic view that when the thermostat calls for heat, the boiler should ignite and heat comes out. I'm struggling with which of the 1,000,001 things might be causing that simplistic view to go wrong.\n\nAs an aside....service tech is coming out this week...he's quite good and I'm confident in his approach. I'm picking your collective brains for ideas in the meantime, and will post what he discovers later in the week.\n\nGreg\n\n0\n\n2 years is awful short lifespan for a Lochinvar ignitor and flame rod.\n\nWHB is a great boiler, I have installed lots of them. LP can be tricky to tune in properly, and in my experience, depending on your altitude (I'm at 6000 feet) can require a bias adjustment (something that needs to be done while talking to a tech from Lochinvar to keep your warranty) for proper combustion numbers to be achieved. Something that needs to be verified also is that the second stage LP regulator is functioning properly. I have pulled my hair out for hours, before finally checking the regulator to find that it is not functioning correctly. If your did not do this when they did the combustion test, I would ask the static inlet pressure, and the pressure drop when running at full fire. On LP I would want 10\" static, and a pressure drop of no more than 2\" when at high fire. I would hope for a pressure drop of only .5\" or 1\". 8\" is the minimum inlet pressure for this boiler. When a regulator goes bad you will either see a slow creep of static pressure going up, or you will see a huge drop in dynamic pressure as the gas valve opens. If it drops below 8\" you will start to see combustion problems and nuisance lockouts as a result.\n\nThis may not be the problem, but just wanted to throw it out there as a possibility.\n\n0\n\nThanks, zman and Ironman.\n\nA couple of things...\n\nAgree that bird screens are necessary - they have now been ordered and will be installed in a week.\n\nAgree there are a lot of 90deg bends...but...as long as the length is less than the equivalent of 100’ (including the penalty that the 90s impose), how much of a problem is that really?\n\nAgree that the exhaust/intake should be at least 12”, and will get that fixed. It’s close, but it’s not 12”. Is there a maximum distance?\n\nThe problem that I’m just not sure how to address is the 4’ separation from the sidewall. The design of the house just doesn’t allow for it without the vent pipes being routed such that my wife would shoot me. Is there anything that could be done that would help, if not completely fix, the issue? For example, could I angle the intake at 45deg? Increase the height of the exhaust to increase separation by another 12”?\n\nThanks again for your help.\n\n0\n\nSo the room air intake would have worked, but would have provided more mysteries as to why it worked.\n\nI make my own bird screens out of 1/4\" SS mesh.\n\nI cut a circle to just fit inside a hub tightly. Then cut a 3/8\" long piece of pipe of that size. Bury the mesh into the hub all the way. Push the short pipe ring up into the hub to keep the mesh from turning sideways. To remove, a screwdriver will pry the ring out and then hook the mesh.\n\nBut if you are rebreathing exhaust the 1/4\" will frost up under certain conditions.\n\nI was just out last week to clean an intake.\n\n1/2\" mesh would keep birds out but still snakes and mice could make it thru.\n\nBut less chance of frosting shut.\n\nIIRC, I had a screen included with a Lochinvar, it was a round globe of mesh with a SS plate dividing it in half. It is the size of a softball and mounts on 3\" pipe. Never have had that one frost up.\n\nI also put a PVC wye in the horizontal run of inlet pipe, with clean out on the bottom,\n\nthe clean out such that it is downstream of the air flow. Drill a drain hole in the plug.\n\nThe wye will collect some dirt somewhat like a strainer. The hole would drain any moisture out. If outside inlet is frosted shut tightly and inaccessible, the plug may be removed temporally and then use inside air. Sometimes there is no snow right at the house but may be a 4'+ drift all around that side of the house.\n\nIf homeowner calls during a blizzard at 1AM, they can remove the plug and often that gets the heat on after resetting power. They are all advised of this.\n\nI also learned to not assume the function of components;\n\nHad a Loch KBN 106 running, I often check the safeties, on any gas burners, by for instance pull the FS cable off to check if that function is working....well the ignitor doubled as a FS also, had to remove both cables to shut down.\n\nThen I am used to pulling the hoses off the pressure switch for shut down.\n\nFire stayed on, pressure switch was always NC with fan on or off.\n\nThen learned that this is a blocked inlet NC switch.....if enough negative pressure is developed the board assumes that not enough air is entering and shuts down burner as the pressure switch opens.\n\nSeems to simple to be safe....well if the fan is not running it will suck no gas in, perhaps the board will not open the gas valve at all if a certain RPM is not registered.\n\nFWIW\n\n0"
