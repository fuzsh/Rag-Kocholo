        "text": "Information for Individuals With Criminal Convictions Who Are Considering an Occupation or Profession That Requires Licensure, and an Overview of the License Application Process\n\nEffective Dec. 27, 2020\n\nDownload a PDF of the ACT 53 of 2020 Best Practices Guide\n\nPreliminary Determination Application: User Guide\n\nEspañol: Ley 53 de 2020 GUÍA DE BUENAS PRÁCTICAS\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of State’s Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs (BPOA) is responsible for licensing and regulating a wide variety of occupations and professions, ranging from accountants and auctioneers, to vehicle salespeople and veterinarians, and dozens more in between such as barbers, cosmetologists, doctors, engineers, funeral directors and geologists − just to name a few.\n\nTo become licensed, an individual must meet certain standards and requirements established by BPOA’s 29 boards and commissions. While those requirements vary from one board to the next depending on the particular occupation or profession, they all have a common goal: to protect, preserve and improve the health and safety of Pennsylvania’s citizens.\n\nSafeguarding public health and safety requires a variety of factors to be considered and weighed when deciding whether or not to issue someone a license. For example, convictions for certain criminal activity − by the very nature of the underlying crimes − can raise serious public safety concerns and therefore must be considered.\n\nUntil recently, whether or not an individual possessed “good moral character,” or had been convicted of a “crime of moral turpitude,” or otherwise engaged in “unethical or dishonest practice or conduct,” could also be considered.\n\nThis Best Practices Guide is intended to provide an explanation of certain changes to the laws governing the use of criminal convictions in professional and occupational licensing determinations as a result of the passage of Act 53 of 2020. While this Guide is designed for applicants (individuals who are considering or seeking licensure), the statute itself - Act 53 of 2020 - also applies to licensees and certificate holders who may be subject to discipline for criminal offenses.\n\nAct 53 of 2020\n\nOn July 1, 2020, Governor Tom Wolf signed into law Act 53 of 2020, which made sweeping changes to the occupational licensing rules that govern the use of criminal history information in determining whether to grant, deny, suspend, or revoke a professional license.\n\nWith regard to the consideration of criminal convictions, Act 53:\n\nProhibits BPOA’s licensing boards and commissions from denying licensure based on considerations of “good moral character,” “crimes of moral turpitude,” or “ethical or honest practice.”\n\nRequires each board and commission to develop and publish a schedule of criminal offenses that may constitute grounds to deny, suspend or revoke a license. The list must also identify which crimes are likely to pose a barrier to licensure because they are considered to be offenses “directly related” to the occupation/profession.\n\nProvides for an “individualized assessment” of each license applicant using objective, detailed criteria that includes rehabilitation and public safety.\n\nProvides a process for individuals who have criminal convictions to request a “preliminary determination” as to whether a particular conviction will be a bar to licensure. This new tool will enable people with criminal convictions to find out if their convictions would prevent them from getting a license − before enrolling in a training or educational program, before investing significant time and resources, and before formally applying for licensure.\n\nPreliminary Determinations (Section 3115 of Act 53)\n\nIf you have a criminal conviction in your past and are concerned about whether it could prevent you from getting a license, certificate, registration or permit for a particular occupation or profession, your first step should be to review this Best Practices Guide closely, including the Appendices.\n\nIf, after reviewing this Guide, you are still unsure whether your conviction is likely to prevent you from getting a license, you may submit an application to the appropriate board or commission requesting what is known as a preliminary determination.\n\nThe preliminary determination will inform you whether your specific conviction falls within the set of crimes that the board has determined to be “directly related” to the occupation or profession you are considering.\n\nA “directly related” crime is significant. It means that in the board’s view, the nature of the criminal conduct has a direct bearing on a person’s fitness or ability to perform the tasks, duties or responsibilities necessarily related to a particular profession or occupation.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN YOU WILL BE DENIED A LICENSE.\n\nFor the most part, with a few notable exceptions, the fact that your criminal conviction has been identified as being “directly related” to the profession does not mean that you will automatically be denied a license.\n\nThe board could still grant a license notwithstanding the conviction. For example, the board may have the option to grant a license on probation, or may place certain restrictions on the license.\n\nIf you subsequently do decide to formally apply for a license, you would have the opportunity to present any evidence in your favor as part of the application process.\n\nDownload and print: Instructions that explain how to request a preliminary determination. There is a $45 fee for each request (this fee may be waivable where in forma pauperis status is established).\n\nThe board/commission is required to issue a preliminary determination within 45 days of your request.\n\nAsking for a preliminary determination is an optional step. There is no requirement that you request one.\n\nIf you ultimately decide to formally apply for a license, you should review the next section of this Best Practices Guide, which explains “Consideration of Criminal Convictions.”\n\nThe Assessment Factors discussed below are particularly important: they outline the criteria the board will use to consider your conviction in making the overall determination whether or not to grant you a license. You should be prepared to provide the board with as much information as possible.\n\nConsideration of Criminal Convictions (Section 3113 of Act 53)\n\nAfter December 27, 2020, in determining whether or not an individual’s criminal conviction constitutes grounds for denying that person a license, the boards and commissions may only use the criteria, processes and procedures set forth in Act 53.\n\nIn evaluating what impact a past criminal conviction may have on an individual’s fitness for licensure, boards will generally conduct a two-stage analysis.\n\nTwo-Stage Evaluation Process:\n\nFIRST: CONSULT THE LISTS OF OFFENSES.\n\nThe board will determine whether your criminal conviction is “directly related” to the profession or occupation for which you are seeking a license. This is done simply by reviewing the schedules of offenses provided at Appendices A-D for the type of license you are seeking.\n\nIf the offense is listed on the schedules, it is presumed that granting you a license would pose a substantial risk to the health and safety of others (patients, clients, the general public, etc.) or create a substantial risk of further criminal conduct/convictions.\n\nAt that point, the burden is then on you to refute that presumption, by presenting evidence of rehabilitation using the Assessment Factors (see below).\n\nIf your conviction is NOT listed on the schedules, then the board skips to the second stage of the evaluation process.\n\nSECOND: CONDUCT AN INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT.\n\nAn “individualized assessment” involves a review of your conviction using the following factors to determine whether licensure is appropriate. The burden is on the board to establish that granting you a license would pose substantial health/safety risks or further convictions.\n\nThe Assessment Factors\n\nThe facts and circumstances surrounding your conviction.\n\nThe number of convictions you have.\n\nWhether the criminal conduct for which you were convicted involved an act or threat of harm against you.\n\nThe increase in your age or maturity since your conviction.\n\nYour criminal history, or lack of criminal history, after the date of the conviction.\n\nWhether you have successfully completed any training or education activities, such as those offered through programs within an SCI or county correctional facility.\n\nReferences from employers or others, including probation/parole officers, etc.\n\nWhether you can show evidence of progress in personal rehabilitation since your conviction.\n\nWhether you meet all of the other licensing qualifications for the type of license you are seeking.\n\nAny other factor which the board deems relevant, and any additional information that you may wish to provide, or that the board may request.\n\nThere are three notable exceptions to the two-stage evaluation process.\n\nException 1: Sexual Offenses:\n\nIf you have been convicted of any of the “sexual offenses” provided at Appendix A, you are prohibited from practicing or being licensed as a health care practitioner (this term is defined in Act 53; it includes, for example, doctors, nurses and a number of other professions and occupations).\n\nException 2: Crimes of Violence:\n\nA conviction for one of the “crimes of violence” provided at Appendix B is not necessarily a bar to obtaining a license, if you can show that:\n\n(for those who were incarcerated) at least three years have passed since your release and you have remained conviction-free during that three-year period, or\n\n(for those who served or are serving a sentence other than incarceration) at least three years have elapsed since your sentence was imposed, and you have remained conviction-free during that three-year period.\n\nYou will also need to demonstrate significant rehabilitation since your conviction for a crime of violence.\n\nFinally, the board must reach a determination that granting you a license does not pose a substantial risk to others’ health and safety. The board will utilize the Assessment Factors, above, to make that determination.\n\nThe board also takes into consideration the extent to which granting a license might increase the risk of additional convictions because the nature of the occupation might present opportunities for criminal activity.\n\nException 3: Drug Trafficking Offenses:\n\nSome boards have restrictions on granting licenses to individuals who have been convicted of one of the “drug trafficking offenses” provided at Appendix C. If you have been convicted of a drug trafficking offense, these boards may only grant you a license if:\n\nTen (10) years have elapsed since the date of the conviction.\n\nYou can demonstrate to the board that you have made significant progress in personal rehabilitation since your conviction for a drug trafficking crime.\n\nThe board makes a determination, using the Assessment Factors, that granting you a license does not pose a substantial risk to others’ health and safety. The board also takes into consideration the extent to which granting a license might increase the risk of additional convictions because the nature of the occupation might present opportunities for criminal activity.\n\nYou satisfy all of the other requirements and qualifications for the type of license you wish to obtain.\n\nRestricted Licenses\n\nRestricted Licenses for Barbers and Cosmetologists (Section 3112 of Act 53)\n\nSome barbers and cosmetologists get their training through barber and cosmetology schools that are located within an SCI or county correctional facility. Therefore, it is not uncommon for individuals who wish to become licensed barbers or cosmetologists to have convictions on their record.\n\nFor those reasons, Act 53 includes an additional pathway for barbers and cosmetologists who might otherwise be ineligible for licensure because of their criminal history: it’s called a “restricted license.”\n\nTo qualify for a restricted barber or cosmetologist license, you would need to demonstrate that:\n\n(if you were incarcerated) you maintained a record of good behavior, and successfully completed any rehabilitative programming that may have been offered.\n\n(if you were enrolled in a barber or cosmetology program while incarcerated) you successfully completed the education or training requirements of the program.\n\nyou have not violated the terms of your probation or parole.\n\nyou are committed to living a law-abiding life, which can be accomplished by providing a letter of recommendation, for example, from your probation or parole officer or an appropriate correctional official.\n\nThe board determines how long each restricted license is good for (between 1 and 2 years), and can place certain conditions on the restricted license.\n\nYou may be limited to performing only certain tasks and not others. (Example: Restricted Licensee may cut hair, and trim moustaches and beards, but may not provide facial shaves.)\n\nYou may be required to work at a specific location. (Example: Restricted licensee may provide services only at Sally’s Salon, 123 Anywhere Street, Yourtown, PA.)\n\nYou may be allowed to perform services only when being directly supervised by a licensed barber or cosmetologist.\n\nIf you fail to comply with any of the conditions placed on your restricted license, or are subsequently convicted of another misdemeanor or felony offense, your restricted license will be automatically revoked.\n\nWhen your restricted license expires, you may be eligible for a full license if, within 30 days, you:\n\narrange for your supervisor or shop/salon owner to provide a letter to the board indicating that you have complied with all conditions of your restricted license; and\n\nyou meet all of the other qualifications for full licensure.\n\nWith a full license, you can provide barbering or cosmetology services without restrictions.\n\nRestricted Licenses for Other, Future Professions (Section 3112.1 of Act 53)\n\nIf, in the future, a county correctional facility or SCI decides to implement additional training programs − beyond barbering or cosmetology − for a profession or occupation that would require licensure, the relevant board or commission may offer an alternative pathway to licensure via a restricted license.\n\nIn that case, the applicable board could choose to issue a restricted license to an applicant with a past criminal conviction as an alternative to denying a license in the same manner as the restricted licenses for barber and cosmetology.\n\nJuvenile Adjudications (Section 3114 of Act 53)\n\nA board or commission may not consider a person’s juvenile adjudications.\n\nIf you are applying for a license or seeking a preliminary determination, you do not need to disclose any juvenile adjudications.\n\nEven if you did disclose juvenile adjudications (for example, by mistake, inadvertently, etc.), the boards and commissions would be prohibited from considering those adjudications.\n\nAPPENDICES\n\nSCHEDULES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES/CONVICTIONS THAT MAY BE GROUNDS FOR GRANTING, DENYING, SUSPENDING OR REVOKING A LICENSE, CERTIFICATE, REGISTRATION OR PERMIT\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nSexual Offenses\n\nCrimes that appear in APPENDIX A are sexual offenses.

Some boards are limited in their ability to license individuals who have been convicted of the drug trafficking offenses that meet the criteria set forth in Act 53 unless:\n\nAt least 10 years have elapsed from the date of the conviction.\n\nThe individual demonstrates that he/she has made significant progress in personal rehabilitation since the conviction.\n\nThe board determines that licensure of the individual would not be expected to create a substantial risk of harm to the health and safety of the individual’s patients or clients or the public or a substantial risk of further criminal convictions.\n\nThe applicant otherwise satisfies the qualifications for the license, certificate, registration or permit sought.\n\nThis list applies to the following boards/commissions:\n\nState Board of Chiropractic\n\nState Board of Dentistry\n\nState Board of Medicine\n\nState Board of Optometry\n\nState Board of Veterinary Medicine\n\nState Board of Psychology\n\nState Board of Social Workers, Marriage & Family Therapists and Professional Counselors\n\nState Board of Crane Operators\n\nState Board of Massage Therapy\n\nState Board of Nursing\n\nState Board of Pharmacy\n\nState Board of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nState Board of Physical Therapy\n\nDRUG TRAFFICKING OFFENSES:\n\nA violation of section 13(a) (14), (30) or (37) of the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act (63 P.S. § 780-113(a) (14), (30) and (37)) (relating to prohibited acts; penalties), as follows, provided the relevant drug meets the quantity or weight restrictions in Act 53:\n\n(14) The administration, dispensing, delivery, gift or prescription of any controlled substance by any practitioner or professional assistant under the practitioner's direction and supervision unless done (i) in good faith in the course of his professional practice; (ii) within the scope of the patient relationship; (iii) in accordance with treatment principles accepted by a responsible segment of the medical profession.\n\n(30) Except as authorized by this act, the manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance by a person not registered under this act, or a practitioner not registered or licensed by the appropriate State board, or knowingly creating, delivering or possessing with intent to deliver, a counterfeit controlled substance.\n\n(37) The possession by any person, other than a registrant, of more than thirty doses labeled as a dispensed prescription or more than three trade packages of any anabolic steroids listed in section 4(3)(vii).\n\nAPPENDIX D\n\nSchedules of Additional “Directly-Related” Crimes for Each of BPOA’s 29 Boards and Commissions\n\nAPPENDIX D contains a schedule of criminal convictions for each of the 29 professional and occupational boards and commissions.\n\nIncluded in these schedules are those crimes that have been determined to be “directly related” to the professions and occupations regulated by that board/commission.\n\nIf a crime has been identified as “directly related,” that means that the board/commission has found that the nature of the criminal conduct has a direct bearing on the fitness or ability of the individual to perform one or more of the duties or responsibilities necessarily related to the profession or occupation for which the individual seeks licensure.\n\nIf a crime is listed as “directly related” to a particular profession or occupation, that does not mean an individual with a conviction for that crime would automatically be denied a license.
