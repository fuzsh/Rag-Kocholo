        "text": "The primary purpose of these high-visibility efforts is to catch drunk drivers, communicate to potential offenders that there is no tolerance for impaired driving, and to help end drunk and drugged driving once and for all.\n\nImpaired driving checkpoints are a highly organized and coordinated screening of drivers as they pass through an area where traffic is diverted by law enforcement. The intention is to briefly engage randomly selected motorists in a conversation on the side of the road while officers closely examine the driver’s behavior, language and movements. Officers look for signs of impairment that indicate the driver’s inability to safely travel on the road, presenting a danger to themselves, their passengers and other motorists. Checkpoints are a critical component of high-visibility traffic safety enforcement, and the publicity surrounding them helps serve as a deterrent to drunk and drugged driving.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of MADD’s Campaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving® is high-visibility traffic safety enforcement to both catch drunk drivers and — equally important — to deter others by sending a strong message that if you drive impaired, you will get caught. MADD has designated the Saturday before Labor Day weekend as Saturation Saturday, a day to team up with law enforcement departments nationwide to amplify the message that if you choose to drive impaired, you will get caught. MADD volunteers and staff coordinate with their local departments to host media events, roll call briefings and sobriety checkpoints to show support for officers conducting high-visibility enforcement. The campaign is aimed at lowering drunk driving crashes and fatalities during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year.\n\nMADD also supports the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and law enforcement in their impaired driving crackdowns. After all, to deter potential drunk drivers, they have to know enforcement is out there. The crackdowns do just that – let people know that law enforcement is keeping a special eye out for drunk drivers during dangerous parts of the year.\n\nWhat can you do to help? You can be the eyes and ears to help prevent drunk driving by learning the signs of a drunk driver and what to do when you see one here."
