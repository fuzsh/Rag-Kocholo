A specialized tool for students to engage in career action planning before starting vocational training is required. We submit ROADMAP Career Book™ for your consideration. Why? Studies show that 80% of workers don’t have career fit – being in the job role that best suits their knowledge, skills, and abilities. Career misfit causes apathy and hinders career advancement, mobility, and job creation. To help students find their ideal career, each student should receive a book for career action planning at around 13 years (class 7 – form 1). To include teachers in student's career life planning and minimize harmful effects of teacher-community friction caused by corporal enforcement of learning by teachers. How? Teachers placed in charge of subjects and departments should receive career guide training (at the school’s cost) to improve career prospects for students. Career exploration on specially designed exercise books will increase students’ chances of finding career fit. When? Self-directed career management should start early, with selection of subjects to specialize in past secondary school. Beginning career exploration early gives a student better career prospects in their chosen field. Where? Students can engage in career planning at school and at home, relying on the input and guidance of teachers, guardians, mentors, etc. Career Development Career Counseling Career Management Career Development Coaching Careers In Dubai @Global Careers Outlook @The Education Trust @African Education Foundation Save the Children International Plan International Childhood Education International @Roma Education Fund African Union African Leadership Academy Fundación Escuela Nueva ROTAC FOUNDATION LitWorld Center for Global Development EDC (Education Development Center) Education Development Trust Education Development Institute Career Development Institute Career Education Corporation Teachers Without Borders Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) TSC Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers (KUPPET) Kenya National Innovation Agency (KeNIA) @KNUT IREX FAWE @Kenya Education Fund LitWorld Tostan Pratham Education Foundation @Room to Read Barefoot College International Asante Africa Foundation Moving Mountains Publishers EF Education First @Community Education Concern @African Children Education Fund @The Agha Khan Foundation Career Choice 360 Career Choice Inc.\n\nBeing in Recruitment for 2 decades now I am realizing the typical difference in Employment and employability which typically has widened which actually is defined as.. *Employment* refers to the state of having a paid job or occupation, where an individual works for an employer or organization in exchange for compensation, benefits, and other rewards. It involves a contractual agreement between the employer and employee, outlining the terms and conditions of work, responsibilities, and expectations. *Employability*, on the other hand, refers to the ability, skills, and qualities that make an individual capable of being employed. It encompasses the personal attributes, knowledge, and competencies that enable someone to secure and maintain employment. Employability skills include: 1. Communication and teamwork 2. Problem-solving and adaptability 3. Time management and organization 4. Leadership and initiative 5. Continuous learning and professional development 6. Digital literacy and technical skills 7. Emotional intelligence and self-awareness 8. Resilience and flexibility Having strong employability skills can help individuals: 1. Secure better job opportunities 2. Advance in their careers 3. Adapt to changing work environments 4. Stay competitive in the job market 5. Achieve personal and professional growth In essence, employment is the outcome, while employability is the foundation that enables individuals to achieve and maintain employment.\n\nMy Experience as a Student Permit Holder in the Job Market As a student permit holder navigating the job market, I've encountered several challenges that have hindered my ability to secure employment. Here's a glimpse into my journey: Talent Overlooked: Despite possessing relevant skills, experiences, and a strong academic background, I've found that many employers overlook my qualifications due to my student permit status. It's disheartening to see talent disregarded simply because of legal restrictions. Limited Part-Time Opportunities: Finding part-time work to support myself while studying has been incredibly challenging. With limited opportunities available for student permit holders, it's been a struggle to make ends meet and gain valuable work experience. Obstacles in Obtaining References: Building a professional network and obtaining job references without local work experience has been an uphill battle. Many employers require local references, making it difficult for student permit holders like myself to prove our capabilities. Unrecognized Potential: Despite possessing the skills, professionalism, and communication abilities necessary for success, I've often felt overlooked by employers who prioritize work permit holders. It's frustrating to see my potential go unrecognized due to bureaucratic barriers. Through my experiences, I've come to realize the need for greater support and opportunities for student permit holders in the job market. By advocating for change and raising awareness about the challenges we face, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable job market for all. #StudentPermit #JobMarketChallenges #InclusionMatters\n\nAre you a young woman aged 17-24, currently unemployed or out of school?

Tigo Tanzania Plc\n\nEdit: Since I've got a number of people seemingly confused, I need to clarify that these are teaching jobs in the middle and far east. Not in the UK and not in my home country. --- This is one of many interactions where I have faced disqualification from even applying to a job because of my nationality. How is a British, American, Canadian or Australian citizen more qualified than I am given that we hold the same degrees and have had similar experiences? Given that these website are hiring for countries in the middle and far east... I keep wondering on how deep this practice is rooted? And how do schools advertise as an 'equal opportunity employer', a 'diverse and welcoming workplace' yet get a pass for similar practices? Please feel free to share your experiences, ideas on how to overcome this, or if you're an employer, how does your school take active steps to bring genuine diversity to your classrooms?\n\n🌟 Frustration & Opportunity in Employer Engagement 🌟 The Reality Check of Work Experience: Bridging the Gap Between Expectations and Availability. Educators emphasise the importance of work experience, but there’s a disconnect between local opportunities and the expectations of both educators and students. This disconnect frustrates coordinators and disillusions students. As part of the employer engagement team, we invest a tremendous amount of hard work liaising with employers who generously offer placement opportunities for our students. However, we've encountered a significant challenge: a substantial number of these placements—35% to be exact—are not being utilised by the students and schools. This underutilisation not only disheartens our dedicated coordinators and placement providers but also leads to disillusioned employers who feel their time and efforts have been wasted. The consequence? These employers may be less inclined to support our students in the future. The Reality Check of Work Experience Unrealistic Expectations Students often seek placements in industries that don’t exist locally, such as high-tech startups or entertainment production houses. This makes matching students with meaningful placements nearly impossible. The Travel Dilemma Many students are unwilling or unable to travel far for placements, further limiting the pool of opportunities. Saturated Marketplace Employers are unable to support the high volume of opportunity requests within a limited number of weeks, making it even harder to find suitable placements. Empathy for Educators Educators work tirelessly to secure placements, liaising with businesses and managing logistics, often with limited resources. Their dedication deserves appreciation and support. A Call for Realism and Flexibility - Educate Students on Local Industries: Align student expectations with the realities of the local job market. - Encourage Flexibility: Students should be open to diverse work experiences. - Facilitate Travel Solutions: Explore transportation options to broaden the placement pool. - Set Realistic Goals: Prevent disappointment and ensure valuable experiences by setting achievable expectations. By bridging the gap between student aspirations and the local job market, we can create meaningful work experiences that benefit students and ease the burden on coordinators. Let’s work together to make work experience a truly enriching step in a student’s career journey."
