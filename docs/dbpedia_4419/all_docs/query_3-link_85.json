By completing this form, you are not committing to a placement year.\n\nHow to apply for a work placement\n\nMost undergraduate students can opt to do a professional placement. If you are interested in doing a placement year as part of your course, you will need to apply directly to an employer.\n\nYou can look for placements using CareerHub or try:\n\nTARGETjobs\n\nProspects\n\nRateMyPlacement and Gradcracker (for STEM jobs)\n\nCogent Placements (Life Sciences placements).\n\nHow we can support you\n\nWe can support you through our Placements Preparation Programme, which is a series of events and resources to help you plan for a placement year. The programme usually starts in the autumn term, but you can search for, book on to events, and see exact timings in CareerHub.\n\nThe programme includes:\n\nan introductory talk about what a placement is, where to go and how to arrange one\n\naccess to an online resource where you can plan your placement year and receive guidance on how to find the best placement, how to apply, and tips for interview\n\naccess to employer events and workshops\n\nweekly emails from the Sussex Placements Team offering support\n\nplacements vacancies advertised on CareerHub\n\naccess to our Careers Fair\n\nmeetings with our placement officers and placement connectors who can guide you when you apply\n\nsmall group intensive workshops.\n\nYou also have access to:\n\nour employer engagement team who have links with local, national and international employers (currently nearly 10,000 on our database)\n\nan allocated placement tutor from your department, who will support you throughout the duration of your placement\n\na placements tracker to view your step-by-step progress.\n\nInternational placements\n\nA placement at a company or organisation abroad means you gain all of the benefits of a professional placement as well as valuable insights into working in a different country. You can immerse yourself in a different culture and learn a language, plus an ‘international mindset’is a skill highly valued by employers in the UK and worldwide.\n\nIf you are interested in working outside of the UK, we can give you advice on where to look for placements through our Placement Preparation Programme.\n\nYou can also use GoinGlobal (login via CareerHub), which has information on working in different countries (including job sites), or try:\n\nAll About Careers\n\nProspects\n\nTarget Jobs (Working Abroad)\n\nHigherEd (Sussex has a subscription via the Business School, but you need to register).\n\nHow to apply for an international placement\n\nYou should tell the placements team – and your academic adviser – that you want to do an international placement. Whether you are looking to work in an NGO or an investment bank, we can help you make sense of your international options and advise you on how to apply. Alternatively, you might decide not to do a placement and instead spending your year studying abroad.\n\nIf you would like international experience but don’t want to spend a whole year away, there are lots of opportunities for shorter vacation internships overseas.\n\nWhat to do if you express interest in doing a placement late\n\nIf you have engaged with our Placement Preparation Programme throughout your first and second years, you will be in an excellent position to secure a placement. However, if not, don’t panic. We can still help you even if you are part-way through your second year.\n\nPlacements are advertised (and secured) right up until the end of the second academic year. If you are in your second year and want to do a placement, you should now make sure you complete the placement interest form and contact the placements team at placements@sussex.ac.uk for more information.\n\nPlacements for Masters students\n\nSome Masters students have the opportunity to undertake an optional placement year as part of their course, which is a minimum of 40 weeks. These placements may be linked to a dissertation, depending on your course structure. Talk to your course leader to find out the specific timings and requirements for your course.\n\nYou will not be placed at an organisation. Instead, you will need to do a lot of preparation and research to give yourself the best possible chance of securing a placement, which suits your aspirations. Most postgraduate placements are not advertised, it is therefore recommended that you contact organisations speculatively. You can contact us at: placements@sussex.ac.uk if you’re a Masters student and need help applying for a placement.\n\nYour employment rights"
