        "text": "What began four decades ago as a small, fledgling industry heavily dependent on research and development with few approved products on the market has matured into a large, diverse industry with hundreds of life-enhancing products manufactured at commercial scale and with more in development.\n\nThe industry’s ascension is “an overnight success 40 years in the making,” as Charles Hamner, former president of NCBiotech, is fond of saying.\n\nBy the end of 2023, North Carolina was home to 810 life sciences companies that directly employed 75,000 people. Another 2,500 companies supported or were related to this thriving industry.\n\nThis heft placed North Carolina among the top tier of states in the life sciences with growth out-pacing most other states.\n\nNot even the largest economic recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s could shut down North Carolina’s life science juggernaut.\n\nWhen the U.S. housing bubble burst and the global financial crisis flared, spurring a major economic downturn from 2007 to 2009, the life sciences emerged as one of the few bright spots in North Carolina’s economy.\n\nAs unemployment in the state reached record-high levels, biotech employment grew.\n\nThe sector remained a large generator of income and taxes statewide, according to a study by the Battelle Technology Partnership Practice. The report showed North Carolina's life science jobs grew by 30.9% between 2000 and 2012, compared with a mere 1% overall private sector growth in the state during the same time. And those jobs paid an average of $81,000 a year.\n\nAccording to the Battelle study, life sciences companies and institutions generated $73 billion in economic activity for the state, a jump of 60% since the recession hit in 2008, and accounted for 228,259 direct and indirect jobs – 5% of all employment in the state.\n\nNorth Carolina’s life sciences future “has never been brighter,” Battelle said in the report. “North Carolina has a realistic ‘line of sight’ to specific growth opportunities that build upon its industry strengths and research assets and allow North Carolina to differentiate itself and compete on a national and global scale.”\n\nThe Battelle analysts cited six areas of technology strength in the state:\n\nCrop genetic engineering\n\nOutsourced drug development\n\nAdvanced wound healing, surgical devices and regenerative medicine\n\nPersonalized medicine and diagnostics\n\nContract manufacturing\n\nHealth informatics\n\n“The reason we are ahead of the curve is because . . . we’ve invested in the biotech industry and it’s paying dividends,” Norris Tolson, the Biotech Center’s president and CEO, said in a 2010 interview with Business Leader magazine.\n\nThat same year, Art Pappas, founder and managing partner of Pappas Ventures, a Durham-based venture capital firm, explained to the News and Observer of Raleigh why biotech was critical to the state’s economy during the recession:\n\n“The life sciences are an engine of job creation with a high ‘multiplier’ rate – they create a lot of jobs indirectly. In addition to elite, Ph. Ph.D.-level positions, the life sciences create a range of jobs, including support and manufacturing roles ideal for workers transitioning from declining industries such as furniture or textiles. If North Carolina is to climb out of the recession permanently, it will do so on the shoulders of good-paying, sustainable jobs like these.”\n\nIn 2011, the state took steps to ensure it seized the full economic opportunities of biotechnology. At the request of the General Assembly, NCBiotech prepared a strategic plan to accelerate the industry’s growth at a time of stiffening competition from other states.\n\nNCBiotech consulted with more than 50 of the state’s life sciences executives and identified a lack of early-stage and late-stage funding for companies, as well as a shortage of experienced executives to manage those companies. Its report recommended seven strategies to address these gaps.\n\nFrom the North Carolina Biotechnology Center’s earliest years onward, educating the next generation of citizens about the technology and preparing them for jobs in in the field was a constant priority.\n\nSince 1987 the Biotech Center’s Education and Training Program had offered summer biotech workshops to more than 1,700 middle and high school teachers in all of North Carolina’s 100 counties, preparing them to teach about biotech. It supported those teachers in the classroom with biotech lesson plans, videos, supplies and loaned equipment for lab activities.\n\nIn turn, those teachers reached about 100,000 students a year with lessons about the science, applications and issues of biotechnology, along with career information. Many of those students went on to study biotech-related fields at the state’s community colleges and universities and then pursue jobs and careers in the industry.\n\nThe program also awarded hundreds of grants totaling $7 million to promote biotech teaching and training at schools, community colleges and universities.\n\nWith its experience and expertise, the program was well suited to address a growing need for specialized workers in the early 2000s.\n\nAs more biotech products gained regulatory approval and came to market, companies began building and expanding production capacity at a feverish pace to manufacture those products. The industry needed an ever-larger supply of workers skilled in biomanufacturing, the production of proteins and other biological molecules using living cells.\n\nNot having enough trained workers would be a rate-limiting factor in the industry’s growth, said Sam Taylor, head of NCBIO, the state’s industry association. “We believe that the biomanufacturing industry has enormous potential to bring jobs to all regions of North Carolina as biotechnology moves from a research base to a manufacturing base.”\n\nAt the industry’s request, the Education and Training Program surveyed the state’s biotech companies to determine how many biomanufacturing workers they would need and the skillsets those employees should have. The results were published in a seminal report, “Window on the Workplace,” which projected the industry would need 2,000 to 3,000 new employees every year for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs NCBiotech found its footing, it selected a new president and CEO in late 1987 to succeed the first president, Richard Patterson, and interim president Roy Morse. Charles E. Hamner Jr., Ph.D., D.V.M., brought a mix of scientific, academic and business experience to the job in February 1988. He had been associate vice president for health affairs and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Virginia Medical Center and was previously head of research and development at A.H. Robins Co., a pharmaceutical company in Richmond, Va.\n\n“Biotechnology is a very young industry with potential for explosive growth in the coming decade and into the next century,” Hamner said at the time. “Molecular biology and genetics offer enormously improved productivity and protection for plants, animals and people. NCBiotech offers a direct way to foster these improvements by continuing to enhance the state’s outstanding research universities and strongly developing biotechnology industry.”\n\nThe same year he took office, NCBiotech published its first directory of biotechnology-related companies, listing 83 company sites in the state that collectively employed about 1,300 people. The numbers were a start, but they would pale compared to what would come in the Hamner era."
