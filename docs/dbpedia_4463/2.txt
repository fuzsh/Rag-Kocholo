Found this old Railway Roundhouse by accident as I was traveling on the S-Bahn one Sunny day in July 2012. Railway buildings have always intrigued me,and I just had to go and have a look at the place.

Getting in to the old maintenance yard was quite easy and there was many other deserted buildings to explore,the state of the roundhouse is in a bad state and the roof is in a bad way, as are other buildings just rotting away, I do not know if they have it down as a listed building or not but it would be a shame to see it fall down, as there are not many of these left around.

The Pankow-Heinersdorf Roundhouse and the other buildings which make up this railway maintenance site are situated in the north of Berlin and was part of the GDR (East German) railway maintenance infrastructure.
