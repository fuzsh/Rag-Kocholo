Ok then, here goes. Second proposal for today. This is a bit of a stretch but pretty interesting. Lets do this...

The Line

This runs for 88.98 miles between the German capital of Berlin to the Polish city of Szczecin. The Stettiner Bahn runs from Berlin Gesundbrunnen in real life but I felt it would be best to extend it a bit further to Sudkreuz so we can include more services.

Rolling Stock

3 trains will be included, these being the: DB BR 628, DB BR 646 and DB BR 650. However, the Talent 2 and DB BR 112 can be layered in for extra services in the Berlin area.

Services

The services on offer are run by DB Regio Nordost and Niederbarnimer Eisenbahn (NEB). Lets take a look...

DB Regio Nordost

RE 3: Elsterwerda Biehla- Stralsund [operated by DB BR 112] {starts in Berlin Sudkreuz, ends in Angermünde}

RE 66: Berlin Gesundbrunnen- Szczecin Glowny [operated by DB BR 628]

Final Words

I feel this route is really good, as it allows for cross border operations and cross city drives in Berlin. Also, it will come with 3 DMUs, and interesting ones at that.

Excellent idea and if you own this one the Red DB BR650 can be layered onto my Suggestion Appenweier-Strasbourg Railway in addition to the yellow paint DB BR650 Ter A11 service. German trains need to have a switch for Polish SHP train safety system for services to or from Szczein (Stettin) . Practice with Germany and Austria seems to be like this if a foreign city has a German name then they put it in parentheses. Therefore RB66 destination displays needs to say Szczein (Stettin). DB BR112 needs to be layered from Hamburg-Lübeck route. Theres a possibility of making Berlin Stettin the new Main Spessart Bahn Aschaffenburg-Gemünden by having all German route locomotives and DLC locomotives appear here. Yards in Berlin get G6 363 & 204
