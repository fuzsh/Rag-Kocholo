Overview

Pankow is the second-largest borough in Berlin, and has at least 10 varied "sub-districts". The southern area bordering Mitte offers an array of posh cafes and shops, while the north is quite low income. You will find plenty of students and families with young kids in this district.

What can I do here?

Pick up a currywurst sausage at Konnopke's, followed by coffee at Anna Blume. Or grab a beer at the Prater beer garden and explore Kulturbrauerei, an old brewery that has been transformed into a cultural space. Kollwitzplatz is considered one of Berlin's most beautiful squares, and Oderberger Strasse its hippest street!
