        "text": "Mail and Packages\n\nSending To A Residence Hall\n\nHall Addresses can be found on each individual residence hall page.\n\nPackages\n\nAll packages MUST be addressed to the resident and their hall address.\n\nPackages arriving from a same-day vendor or food delivery service must include your full name (first and last) and your room number; if they do not, the deliverer must contact you to come and pick up your delivery yourself. University Housing is not responsible for packages being left at package station or front desks without contact information.\n\nPackages for students with fall housing contracts will begin being accepted on August 1.\n\nMail\n\nThe street address, room number and hall are all required for delivery. If information is missing, mail will be delayed from two to five days. Below is an example of how to format the mailing address:\n\nName\n\nUniversity Residence Hall/Room Number/Hall Name\n\nStreet Address\n\nCity/State/Zip + 4\n\nResidents living in University Housing Apartments can find mailing address guidance in the Facilities section of the Apartment Resident Handbook.\n\nReceiving Packages\n\nWhen a package is delivered, you will receive an email notification at your Illinois.edu address. You can also tell us your preference for package notification, such as a text message, by logging into MyHousing. After receiving a notification, you can pick up the package by presenting your i-card at your hall's package station (see the location list below). An i-card is required at the time of pick-up; you cannot send a friend in your place. Using your Illini ID (the QR code) in your Illinois app can work as well.\n\nPlease note that while you may receive a delivery notice or tracking information from a third party, the package must still be processed by Housing first. We know you are eager to receive your package, and we will do our best to process packages on the same day as delivery. When classes are in session, packages not picked up within two weeks will be returned to sender. Packages will be held over Fall, Winter and Spring Breaks and can be picked up when the halls reopen after the break ends.\n\nPackage Pick Up Locations\n\nIkenberry Commons Residence Halls\n\nPackages can be picked up at the Student Dining and Residential Programs Building (SDRP). The package station is located on the first floor of the SDRP behind the staircase.\n\nHours: Monday - Saturday 9 a.m. - 6 p.m.\n\nSDRP Package Station Phone: 217-300-0393\n\nUrbana Residence Halls\n\nPick up packages from your hall's service desk.\n\nPlease see the individual hall pages for their contact information.\n\nDaniels and Sherman Halls\n\nPick up packages from your hall's service desk.\n\nPackages will start being accepted only after you check in. We do not have additional storage for packages due to summer housing at Daniels Hall and Sherman Hall is closed for the summer. Please do not ship packages before you arrive, or they will be returned to sender. Please see the individual hall pages for their contact information.\n\nUniversity Housing Apartments\n\nAll apartment locations have a mailbox system which allows residents to receive packages via a secured package mailbox. If you receive a package, a key to the secured box will be placed in your apartment mailbox. After obtaining the package from the mailbox, replace the key in the package box lock. It is important to retrieve these packages as quickly as possible so that the package box can be used by other members of the community."
