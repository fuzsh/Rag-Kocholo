        "meta_description": "The well-kept old building was built around 1900, when Niederschönhausen was still a community on the outskirts of Berlin. The property has four floors with a total of nine residential units. Above the basement with tenants' cellars and two spacious storage rooms is the mezzanine floor, followed by two upper floors and the attic, which was converted into living space in 1997.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful entrance areas have stucco-decorated walls. You reach the 2-room apartment on the 2nd floor via the daylight staircase with historic wooden banisters. The spacious living, cooking and dining area with access to the balcony, a bedroom with balcony, the new bathroom and the hallway are spread over approx. 47 m². The apartment shines in new splendor: new parquet flooring, smooth plastered walls, double-glazed windows. It is quietly located and flooded with light thanks to its south-facing orientation. The small courtyard at the rear of the building with its sandpit and barbecue area invites residents to socialize.",
