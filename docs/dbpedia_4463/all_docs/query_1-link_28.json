The gentleman who at least tried to fix our faulty A/C; the Genovese guy who bothered to make me coffee at 4AM for my USA based Zoom meeting; generally friendly staff. Studio apartment concept very positive. Money would have been over-priced, however, if not for my having paid with some rewards points. Priced way too high otherwise for the decor and general condition of the place. It isn't the Ritz Carlton, or even Marriott, the latter of which was actually cheaper. Most egregiously: The A/C's did not function properly, and sometimes didnt function AT ALL. And it was 30 degrees out, for the two days we were there. Murderously hot in the rooms we rented, with no let up. This is tell-tale sign of hotels owned by indifferent and complacent organizations that think people shouldnt or won't complain about bad A/C's, and thus will never have the integrity or professionalism to repair or replace same. It is a cheap BS attitude, and, at least in our case, has eliminated the possibility of appx 35 people in our sphere ever going to this place again, great customer service notwithstanding. I received a response apologizing for this, and committing to ”share the criticism”, whatever that meant. To be clear: That does absolutely NOTHING for me, and doesn't answer the fundamental question: when are these A/C's being replaced? The answer to that question dictates when, if ever, this hotel will ever get the many thousands of euros I, and my family and friends, would otherwise be spending there.\n\nShow More\n\n4.3/5\n\nExcellent\n\nGGuest UserWe stayed at 2 hotels during our recent holiday to Berlin, both 4 star, both junior suites and both similar prices - this one was head and shoulders above the other in every possible aspect! I can honestly say if we visit Berlin again we will definitely come back here as it had everything. We stayed for 3 nights in a junior suite on the 7th floor with a balcony with city view (room 744) and it was spacious, very clean, modern and the beds were comfortable. Would definitely recommend getting a balcony room, it really added to the experience sitting outside in the warm evenings watching night fall on Berlin. The Eco scheme the hotel runs where you can get tokens for a free drink at the hotel bar when opting not to have towels/bedding changed was a great idea and we found the bar had a nice feel to it. The breakfast was AMAZING, such a large and fantastic choice of food and drink. Our 10 year old was completely obsessed with the pancake machine and he couldn't believe his luck when staff came round the tables every morning with trays of mini brownies (and iced coffee). The breakfast staff were also great, particularly the guy with the aforementioned tray who was always smiling. Actually all the staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful - it honestly makes such a difference. The location is also perfect, safe and so central to many attractions with plenty of cafes and restaurants in walking distance, along with a chemist and supermarket. The U-bahn station is a minute's walk away and is on the U2 and U6 line which made it easy to get everywhere we wanted to visit without having to change tubes.\n\nShow More\n\n4.2/5\n\nVery Good\n\nSSherpa42652655027This is a gorgeous spanking brand-new hotel in Berlin. Reception is exceptionally courteous, friendly and accommodating - I couldn't have asked for a better team of associates. The bar staff, breakfast room staff, concierge, and even the maintenance staff are as wonderful. I had a lovely large room with the most comfortable bed & pillows - all in modern, tasteful decor. The room also had amenities such as a mini-fridge, coffee service, waters, robe, and iron and work desk area with accessible power points on top (no bending under the desk here!) Upon arrival & departure I was greeted warmly . This sets the tone for a positive experience and I certainly felt the genuine welcome with pleasant smiles and friendly nature. The hotel is quite accessible to 2 U-Bahn stations, and within walking distance of the Berlin Zoo. Getting around Berlin is fairly easy with a well-integrated underground system of U-Bahn & S-Bahn trains. The hotel is on a quiet road across the Los Angeles Platz small park/square. Everything Berlin has to offer is easily accessible, plus plenty of shopping, dining and outdoor activities within a small perimeter. Vielen Dank für Ihre freundliche Gastfreundschaft!\n\nShow More\n\n4.2/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserThe location of Hilton Berlin is fantastic and the exterior of the hotel plus the lobby is very beautiful. Very walkable location with many surrounding dining and sightseeing options. Overall, housekeeping was good. The rooms run fairly small and look dated, so value for money is not that great. Bathroom is clean but not very well-maintained, especially the toilet. The check-in concierge staff were ok but I would expect friendlier and more proactive service for the price we were paying and being a diamond member as well. The staff who was a blonde lady with glasses checked me in and out and was the friendliest staff i encountered during my stay. Rarely did the other staff smile or greet us when we walked past them and they generally did not have great customer service skills, and generally just unfriendly. The front door concierge and door staff were much friendlier and greeted us more than the check-in staff. I also had a very terrible experience with the night security staff when my friend and I came back to the hotel around 6 am after a night out. We walked in and were stopped by a man who was not wearing any uniform, or any attire to signal he was working at the Hilton, and in regular clothes, he was a bit hard to understand because he had a thick accent, and I thought he might be another patron at the hotel or a taxi driver, so I politely smiled at him and said “no thank you” and walked towards the elevator. He got extremely angry, began shouting at me, and said he was a worker there and showed me his keys with a Hilton keychain. He wanted to verify that we had a room key. While we were taking out the key, he was calling me rude and dismissive and that I was a terrible person. It was so jarring because there was no need to be that rude, he was acting like I shooed him away when I’m reality it was a miscommunication. He then went into the back of the concierge to complain about me loudly, didn’t even wait till I was out of earshot. It was hard to identify him as a staff, much less security, and I didn’t need to be scolded like a child. Overall, very unprofessional and made the remainder of my stay feel much more sour. I can look past the dated rooms because I know that is out of the staff’s control at that point of time. But unprofessional and unfriendly staff make the value of my stay and diamond member status much worse.\n\nShow More"
