A customer representative will immediately process a new electronic ticket for your VBB-fahrCard. This will then be valid from the following month. In return, the previous ticket will be cancelled.\n\nInterns and school students or their guardians should change their tickets when they move or change schools, for example. If you reside in Brandenburg, please contact the school administration office or the responsible transportation company.\n\nIf you have bought tickets from S-Bahn Berlin (indicated by the symbol on the bottom right of the ticket), you can return them at any S-Bahn Berlin sales point as part of a refund application. A fee of EUR 2 is charged for processing this application.\n\nIf the validity period of a monthly or weekly pass has already begun, the fee also includes the equivalent of two single journeys (according to VBB's fare system) for every day since the beginning of validity, including the day you apply for a refund.\n\nIf you have bought your tickets from another transport operator (e.g. BVG), please contact the relevant sales points.\n\nIf you have any additional questions, simply contact a customer service employee at +49 (0) 30 297-43333.\n\nYou can change your bank details, address, e-mail or phone number quickly and easily using our subscription portal (only german).\n\nIf you make any changes to your name, please send our subscription processing centre a copy of your new government-issued ID to the following address:\n\nS-Bahn Berlin GmbH\n\nAbo-Center\n\nPostfach 90 01 13\n\n12401 Berlin\n\nGermany\n\ncontact form\n\nFax: 030 297-43344\n\nProcessing the changes will take require some time, so we would ask you to forward the information about your new personal details by the 10th day of a given month if you want the changes to come into effect in the following month.\n\nIf you have any additional questions, simply contact us via our subscription information hotline at +49 (0) 30 297-43555.
