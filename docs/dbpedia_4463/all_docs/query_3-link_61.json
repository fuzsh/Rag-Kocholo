        "text": "Package Pickup\n\nTo reduce the number of packages arriving on campus, we suggest students consolidate their purchases whenever possible. We strongly encourage students to schedule their shipments accordingly.\n\nTo track your USPS packages, go to the USPS Tracking page.\n\nStudent P.O. boxes at the United States Postal Service at Yale Station and Amazon lockers remain viable options for individuals to receive mail and packages going forward.\n\nAmazon Lockers\n\nAddress Locker Name 206 Elm St (New Haven) Qasim 800 West Campus Dr. (Orange) Grade\n\nMail Delivery\n\nPlease do not address any regular mail to the Yale Barnes & Noble Student Package Center - 77 Broadway Lower Level. Any mail received in error will be returned back with USPS mail carrier and possibly returned to sender.\n\nThe only student mail exceptions can be addressed to your residential college office address are as follows: Any government mail including Voting ballots, Passports Jury Duty notices, and Social Security Cards.\n\nPost office Boxes (to be used after you arrive to campus)\n\nTo receive United States Postal Service (USPS) mail on campus, all students are required to have a U. S. Post Office Box. You can rent your U.S. Post Office Box by going to PO Boxes page on the USPS website. You cannot ship your items to the US post office until you activate your post office box number. Packages mailed to 77 Broadway Lower Level must have a scannable bar code. All other packages without a scannable bar code, will be returned to sender. Only packages are accepted, no mail or correspondence will be accepted (including magazines, bank statements, cards and letters).\n\nU. S. mail sent to you at Yale without your Post Office Box number or the Yale Station street address will be subject to delay in delivery, and in some cases will be returned to the sender. There is no direct delivery by U. S. mail to Yale buildings, so do not include the street address of your residential college or dormitory on packages sent by U. S. mail. All packages addressed to colleges or dorms, will be sent back to sender.\n\nTo ensure that US mail can be addressed and delivered to students living on-campus, Yale’s existing policy requiring students to establish a PO Box and mailing address at Yale Station remains in effect. The temporary practice of Campus Mail delivering student US Mail to each residential college office will be discontinued. Any misaddressed US Mail will be returned to sender. Exceptions will be made for voting ballots, passports, and jury duty notices, which on-campus students without PO Boxes can address to themselves at their residential college office address, for delivery by Campus Mail.\n\nAvoid Lost or Delayed Mail\n\nAll letters and packages to your Post Office Box should be addressed according to the following sample:\n\nYour Name\n\n206 Elm Street\n\nP. O. Box Number\n\nNew Haven, CT 06520-____ (the last 4 digits of you post office box #)\n\nStudents may not address their Priority/Certified mail to Campus Mail, 77 Broadway, nor their affiliated college. All Priority/Certified mail for students must be addressed to the student’s PO Box number, otherwise it will be returned to sender.\n\nLetters and packages sent by U. S. mail can be picked up at the Yale Station post office, 206 Elm Street, during regular operating hours.\n\nP.O. Boxes and Summer Break\n\nAny student who is going to receive mail or packages while at Yale, must use their U.S. Post Office box. No mail should be addressed to your residential college. Using a Yale Station P.O. Box guarantees that letters and packages, including UPS and FedEx, will get to one location without delay. If you do not have a box, visit Yale Station today and sign up for one. During your time at Yale, you will keep the same box number.\n\nBefore summer break, be sure to empty the P.O. Box and submit a Change of Address Card to Yale Station, 206 Elm Street, New Haven, CT 06520.\n\nGraduating Seniors Take Note\n\nAfter Commencement and before you leave for home, please be sure your post office box has been emptied and submit a Change of Address card to Yale Station, 206 Elm Street, New Haven, CT 06520.\n\nFor more information, email yalebarnesnoble@gmail.com."
