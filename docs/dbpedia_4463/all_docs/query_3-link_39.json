        "text": "Expand AllClick here for a more accessible version\n\nElk Hunt - 2024\n\nArchery Season: Sept. 14-​28, 2024\n\nGeneral Season: Nov. 4-9, 2024\n\nLate Season: Dec. 28 - Jan. 4, 2025 (excluding Sundays)\n\nDrawing: The annual drawing for elk licenses will take place Saturday, July 27, 2024​ during the Elk Expo at the Elk Country Visitor Center in Benezette. Successful applicants who provide a phone number or email will be notified promptly by those methods, others will receive notification by postal mail​.\n\nEach application costs $11.97, applying for all three seasons would cost a total of $35.91.\n\nApplicants can only be drawn for one season/tag per year, and all three drawings are held on the same day (July 27, 2024) in consecutive order. For example, if you applied for all three seasons and were drawn for the archery season, your applications for the general and late seasons would be instantly removed and you would be awarded bonus points for those seasons (1 point per season).\n\n​Elk Viewing\n\nStay tuned for more information this fall.\n\n​Elk FAQ\n\nResearch and data collection are a fundamental part of elk management in Pennsylvania. Radio collars are specifically used to estimate three things: age specific survival, habitat use and population.\n\nOne bonus point is earned for each unsuccessful application, but points are exclusive to each season. Any existing bonus points for the general elk season will not be applied to the archery or late seasons. For example, if you have previously earned 5 bonus points for the general season and this year you apply for the archery season AND the general season, your existing bonus points are only included in your general season application. If you are unsuccessful in drawing you would earn 1 bonus point for the archery season and 1 bonus point for the general season (meaning you would now have 1 archery & 6 general points). Those points would then be included with the following years application but only for the season in which they were earned.\n\nBonus points serve as a multiplier and your name is entered in the drawing for as many bonus points as you have, effectively increasing the probability of drawing a license.\n\nBonus points reset to 0, if drawn for a specific season, however, any points for alternate seasons remain unchanged. You must apply in the current license year for any bonus points to be included.\n\nYou can check your bonus points through the Pennsylvania Automated License System (PALS) by logging into your existing account on huntfish.pa.gov. After verifying your personal information you will notice an Applications and Points section on the left side of the page towards the bottom. Point totals are listed separately for each season. If you believe there is an error, please contact the License Division at 717-787-2084.\n\n​When visiting Benezette, tune into the Game Commission's Northcentral Elk Viewing Area Information Radio Station, WRBR385, broadcasting on 1620 AM. The radio station provides a guided tour of the heart of the elk management area. In addition to regular seasonal messages and safe elk viewing tips, the station broadcasts important notices about upcoming events and emergencies. The broadcasts are brought to you in partnership with the Keystone Elk Country Alliance and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation.\n\nAs of March 2023, the elk population is estimated between 1300-1400 animals,\n\nFor details on how the Game Commission estimates the elk population see this short video.\n\nHow to apply: How ​To Apply For A Pennsylvania Elk Hunting License Online​ (Youtube)\n\n2024 Elk Application Period: February 1 through July 14, 2024.\n\nApply Online. Visit HuntFishPA site to apply for the elk license drawing and check the status of your application.\n\nApplicant Options: For most of the seasons, there are four options when an applicant applies.\n\nAntlered Only: Applicant is only interested in hunting antlered elk.\n\nAntlerless Only: Applicant is only interested in hunting antlerless elk.\n\nEither-Sex: Applicant is interested in hunting either antlered or antlerless elk.\n\nPoint-Only: Applicant is NOT included in the current years drawing but is awarded the bonus point.\n\nMore information:\n\n2024 Elk Li​cense B​rochure​\n\n2024 El​k License Flyer​​\n\nKnow where to go, when to go, what to do and what to not do. Check out these Elk Viewing Destinations before your visit. During your visit be safe, considerate and respectful. Wildlife watchers often congregate in areas with the best viewing opportunities. Problems can arise when folks gather on the shoulders of rural roads and are focused on watching elk rather than oncoming traffic. Your actions help all elk-watchers, landowners, law enforcement and conservation officials have a good experience.\n\nKeep a Safe Distance — Elk are wild animals. Always observe from a safe distance, and at the minimum of 100 yards (the length of a football field). Risk of serious injury or death can occur if a safe distance is not observed. If you cause the animal to move, you are too close.\n\nDo Not Block Traffic — When viewing elk from your vehicle, park completely off the roadway or view elk from designated Wildlife Viewing Areas.\n\nRespect Private Property — Elk know no boundaries. Please respect private property when viewing elk.\n\nBe Mindful of Rutting Season — Mid-September through October is elk mating season. During this time bull elk are very protective of their harems and can be extremely aggressive.\n\nDo Not Feed Elk — Feeding elk in Pennsylvania is illegal.\n\nFind hotels, restaurants and activities near the Pennsylvania elk range on the PA Great Outdoors Visitors Bureau website.\n\nThis varies with geography. In Pennsylvania wild cow elk live and average of 10 years, while bulls live an average of 8 years. The oldest known cow in Pennsylvania was 32, and the oldest bull was 15. Captive elk live longer than wild elk.\n\nHunters have successfully harvested elk in every hunt zone. Carefully examine each zone considering road access and the amount of available public and private land.\n\nFor more details, consult: Elk Hunt Zone ​M​ap Book​​, Elk Hunt Zone Des​criptions​, Annual Elk Harvest Maps, the Game Commission Mapping Center and maps of the Department of Conservation & Natural Resources' state forests.\n\nYes, bears and coyotes will prey on elk calves, but cow elk have a strong maternal instinct to protect their calves. People are the only predator of adult elk in Pennsylvania.\n\n​The annual drawing for elk licenses will take place Saturday, July 27, 2024​ during the Elk Expo at the Elk Country Visitor Center in Benezette. Successful applicants who provide a phone number or email will be notified promptly by those methods, others will receive notification by postal mail.\n\nTo some degree, nearly all Pennsylvania wildlife compete for resources. Elk are primarily grazers while deer are primarily browsers, however, elk will seasonally shift to a browse-based diet, particular in winter. The Game Commission and several partner organizations put a tremendous amount of time and effort into improving elk habitat, which inevitably benefits deer and other wildlife.\n\nThe 2024 Elk Check Station will be located at the Elk Country Visitor Center, 134 Homestead Dr., PA 15821, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Opening dates will be announced soon) GPS coordinates are 41.3233 N and 78.3684 W. Cell coverage on the elk range is sparse.\n\nElk Check Station (map) (PDF)\n\nResults from the Elk Check Station (near real-time map)\n\nAll elk harvested during the general season must be brought to the check station within 24 hours of harvest. Weight and several biological samples will be collect by Game Commission biologists.\n\nThe check station is open to the public. A variety of vendors and educational displays and programs will be available. The Elk County Visitor Center will be open every day from 8 a.m. until the close of the check station and a presentation on the history of elk in the commonwealth will run every 30 minutes in the theater.\n\nNote: The check station for the late and archery seasons will be held at the Game Commission Maintenance Building at 3508 Winslow Hill Rd. Benezette, PA 15821. Hours are 1000-1200 everyday of the season. Hunters will be notified of additional details via mail.\n\nThe elk rut is triggered by photoperiod (day length) and generally begins around the middle of September and carries through the early- to mid-October. If a cow is not bred in her first estrus cycle, she'll re-cycle approximately every 21 days providing up to three additional opportunities for conception.\n\nPermitted Commercial Elk Outfitters\n\nCheck Station: Harvested elk need to be taken to the elk check station within 24 hours. The Elk Check Station is located at the Elk Country Visitor Center, 134 Homestead Dr., Benezette, PA 15821. GPS Coordinates are 41.3233 N and 78.3684 W. Cell coverage on the elk range is sparse. Elk Check Station (map) (PDF) Results from the Elk Check Station\n\nRegulations: Please consult the current Pennsylvania Hunting & Trapping Digest for details about this year's elk hunt.\n\nElk are Large Animals: An adult bull may weigh 600-1,000 pounds and an adult cow may weigh 400-600 pounds. Part of your hunt plan should include how to field-dress and move the animal from the kill site to your vehicle and on to the check station. Regulations prohibit the use of motorized vehicles, including ATVs on state-owned property, with few exceptions. The animal may be skinned and quartered and packed out by horses or mules or on pack boards. Hunters should bring plenty of help. Any number of unlicensed persons may accompany hunters as long as they wear the required fluorescent orange and do not participate in the hunt itself or carry a firearm. Persons just accompanying an elk hunter are not required to have an elk guide permit.\n\nTable - License Issued and Harvest Success\n\nWhere can I get detailed information about individual elk hunt zone boundaries?\n\nHunters have successfully harvested elk in every hunt zone. Carefully examine each zone considering road access and the amount of available public and private land.\n\nFor more details, consult: Elk Hu​nt Zone Ma​p Bo​ok​​​, Elk Hun​t Zone Descriptions​, Annual Elk Harvest Maps, the Game Commission Mapping Center and maps of the Department of Conservation & Natural Resources' state forests.\n\nArchery Elk Shot Placement (video 2:44)\n\nTo check the status of an Elk License Application: Go to huntfish.pa.gov. Log into your account and scroll to the bottom left-hand corner under \"Applications and Points\", your Bonus Points awarded to date will be displayed. Click \"Submitted Applications\" to check the status of an application for the current license year.\n\nElk are crepuscular, moving more during dawn and dusk. So whether you're trying to view or hunt elk, you'll have more success if you go early in the morning or late afternoon/evening. The most popular time of year to observe elk is during the rut because they are very active.\n\n​\n\nCow elk usually begin calving the last week of May through the first two weeks of June, with the peak around June 5th. Every year one or two newborn calves are seen later in the summer (July or August) and these animals are from cows that were bred after the peak of the rut (September).\n\nPersons interested in becoming a guide for Pennsylvania elk hunters should contact the Special Permits Enforcement Division at 717-783-8164.\n\nAt birth calves generally weigh between 33 and 45 pounds, with males being heavier than females. A calf's birth weight is correlated to the health of its mother, which is dependent upon the quantity and quality of the available habitat and seasonal variation in weather patterns.\n\nCalves grow very quickly, and by late September they will lose their spots as their summer coats are replaced with winter coats.\n\nVery rarely, twinning is possible but occurs in less than 1 percent of elk births. There is only one record of twins occurring in Pennsylvania and they were still-born.\n\nYes, many scientists believe that the teeth are remnants of tusks from prehistoric ancestors. They are also called buglers, whistlers and ivories.\n\nMost bulls tend to lose their antlers right between March 10 and 25; there are always exceptions. Changes in photoperiod (day length) cause a reduction in testosterone that ultimately causes a bull's antlers to drop off.\n\nYes, collecting sheds from public lands (except National Parks) or land you own or have permission to be on is legal. However, it is not legal to pick up any parts or bones of an elk you found dead, including skulls and antlers.\n\nFinding an elk shed is about 90 percent luck. There are a few tips that might improve your chances. First; think about where elk spend time when sheds are dropping. Elk home ranges shift seasonally, so searching for sheds where you've seen elk in the summer is generally a poor strategy. Second; go slow and try to develop an \"eye\" for sheds. Walk slowly through an area scanning back and forth and look for the white tips of the antler sticking up. Third; put your time in. The people that seem to find sheds every year are usually the ones that spend hours walking around the woods."
