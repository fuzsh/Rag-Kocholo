I then edited that style to add a piece of Reference text for the other alignment. The new piece of text currently displays as ???\n\nWhen the label is selected the Properties dialog displays the object that the Reference Text is referring to. Clicking on the field currently showing <none> should bring up an option on the command line to pick the other alignment.\n\nSteve\n\nPlease use the Accept as Solution or Kudo buttons when appropriate\n\nSteve\n\nExpert Elite Alumnus\n\nI really appreciate for your effort Mr.Steve,\n\nBut one more thing, Actually i have many interchanges so do you have any idea if there is available way to superimpose locations of phisical nozes from layout plan to profile view with label that display tha name and offset of adjacent alignments.\n\nMy idea is to superimpose cogo point in the profile view but i can't figure out if there is a way to display adjacent alignment name and offset of the label for cogo points.\n\nI think it can be done by expressions but i don't know how can i do that.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nPlease do not forget approve as solutions and Points\n\nto Remember Please Accept as Solution and Kudos Please"
