If so, 7 On Your Side wants to help you!\n\nEmail your questions, issues, or story ideas by filling out the form below or by emailing 7OnYourSideNina@abc.com.\n\nAll emails MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME AND CELLPHONE NUMBER. Without a phone number, 7 On Your Side will not be able to respond.\n\nAlso, please make sure you've already:\n\nContacted the company and explained your complaint.\n\nIf your complaint wasn't resolved, you should request a chance to work out the problem with a supervisor.\n\n7 On Your Side primarily deals with consumer problems, usually, but not limited to, the purchase of goods and services by individuals.\n\nExcept in extraordinary cases, we do not handle family law disputes and criminal issues. 7 On Your Side cannot help resolve civil disputes such as suspected malpractice and issues that are scheduled for, or are already in court or before an attorney or arbitrator. We can, however, refer you to the proper agencies that may be able to provide the help you need.\n\nBefore submitting an email, please make sure you are contacting the correct station. This is the 7 On Your Side unit at WABC-TV, the ABC station in New York City.\n\nPlease Note: We receive a lot of \"undeliverable\" e-mail. Please be sure to double-check your return e-mail address if you are expecting a reply from us. We cannot be held liable for an email that is undeliverable because an incorrect address was provided."
