        "text": "Sorry, I didn't state the question correctly. What I'm trying to do is change the labels on the alignment shown in picture 2 to start at a higher number than zero, but when I try unchecking the Start Station column, I just get the error as shown in picture 3.\n\nI would like to be able to change this without recreating the alignment.\n\nPat\n\nOr you can create a expression to achieve the result you want, under the Alignment>label styles>Station>Major Station, right click on Expression and select new…., in the Edit Expression dialog box, under the expression area, put in “{Station Value}+40000” 40000 being the start station that you want, once you have the expression create, you can apply that new expression into your major station label style. That way, you aren’t changing the geometry itself instead you just change the label.\n\nI would modify the alignment to start at the number that you want and not mess with the label set. You can start the alignment from any station value you need either when you start drawing the alignment or at any point in the project. After setting the starting station of the alignment, the labels will reflect that automatically.\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter Funk\n\nAutodesk, Inc.\n\nPeter Funk\n\nAutodesk, Inc.\n\nChanging the alignment staioning in the Alignment Properties can cause already created profile views, sample lines, and corridors associated with that alignment to behave very strangely, even vanish. You have to go into each element through the Prospector and change their relative stationing to reflect the revised alignment stationing for them to return to normalcy, and that's a lot of work. This is why changing the labels through an expression, as suggested by an earlier contributor, is a viable idea at this point. However, as others have mentioned, and to avoid some real connundrums down the line, changing the stationing via the Alignment Properties is the best long term solution. This is my recommendation as well.\n\nFor this reason, it is HIGHLY recommended to get the stationing right before you create profiles, corridors, etc.\n\nIs there any way to change the DEFAULT Starting Station for an alignment?\n\nAs a rule, my company starts stations at 10+00 instead of 0+00. Not sure why, but it'd be nice to change this once and never have to deal with it again.\n\nThanks!\n\nAs long as you are in the source drawing for the alignment, you should be able to edit the starting station. Enter the value in the field you circled and press the \"Apply\" button.\n\nAnother way that you could do this is to add a station equation at the start of the alignment.\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter Funk\n\nAutodesk, Inc.\n\nPeter Funk\n\nAutodesk, Inc."
