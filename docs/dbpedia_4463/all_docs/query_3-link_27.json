        "text": "EVE University offers\n\na class on:\n\nBookmarks (CORE class)\n\nA bookmark is a saved location, either of a \"spot\" (coordinate bookmark) or an \"object\" (object bookmark). Bookmarks can be used to warp or align to (when in the same system) or to add the location to the route waypoint list. Bookmarks can be personal (private) or shared.\n\nCommon uses\n\nThere are many types of bookmarks, but all capsuleers should at least have some basic bookmarks to travel in space safely and avoid traps or hunts. Depending on your role or operation you could extend your repertoire to various bookmarks.\n\nSafe spot\n\nSee also: Safe spots\n\nSafe spot bookmarks are one of the most important ways to use bookmarks. Safe spots are locations in space away from all charted entities. The only way to find someone in a safe spot and warp to that location is by using scan probes. Although you can be seen in a directional scan, you cannot be followed unless someone scans your location with probes.\n\nThere are three basic types of safe spots.\n\nMid-point safes are the simplest and least secure form of safes. Create a bookmark while warping between two celestials. It is fairly easy to get the approximate position of a midpoint safe by using directional scanner which makes them easier to probe. A determined pilot can even locate mid-point safes with the directional scanner and mid warp bookmarks.\n\nUnaligned safes are considerably more secure than mid-point safes. These spots are not in alignment between two celestial objects. Unaligned safes can be made by either bookmarking signatures/mission sites or by creating a safe spot while warping from between a mid-point safe and another location.\n\nDeep safes are the most secure form of safe spots. Usually, a safe is considered to be deep safe if it is more than 14 AU from any celestial and is not in between celestials. This makes it impossible to be seen with the directional scanner. Proper deep safes can be hard to make. The following are the three most common methods:\n\nSansha's Nation incursion sites spawn far enough to be used as deep safes.\n\nSleeper Caches can spawn more than 14 AU from the nearest celestial.\n\nAbyssal Deadspace can be exploited to make deep safes.\n\nA long, long time ago...\n\nThe old probe scanning system could be used to warp to an arbitrarily far location. This allowed making bookmarks that were hundreds or thousands of AU away. The safes nowadays called deep are just a pale imitation of the deep safes of the past.\n\nNever warp to within 'zero' of your safe spot. This will reduce your chance of being detected or compromising your safe spot location. And always move rather than sit still, so even if your location is known your adversaries will not be able to land to you at zero.\n\nSalvage\n\nWrecks can not be scanned down. If you wish to return to the battlefield you will need to bookmark the location before you leave.\n\nInstadock\n\nWhen you warp to any location your ship will land approximately 2500 meters away from the target. On stations, this means that you can land outside of the docking range and are vulnerable to ganks as you approach the station. This is especially dangerous at trade hubs where gankers may try to kill you. Instadock bookmarks solve this issue.\n\nAn instadock bookmark is simply a bookmark that is placed at least 2500 meters inside of the docking range. One common way of creating an instadock bookmark is by undocking from a station and saving the location immediately or while the overview says that you are within 0 meters of that station. Instadock bookmarks can be used in combination with the autopilot. Set the target station as your destination and warp to the instadock bookmark. Enable autopilot after entering the warp. As soon as you land on the bookmark your autopilot will automatically dock your ship.\n\nYou can find a demonstration video on YouTube: Staying Safe - Insta-Docks.\n\nInsta-undock\n\nWhen you undock from a station your ship will be moving at maximum velocity towards a certain direction. By having a bookmark far in that direction it is possible to instantly warp off after undocking.\n\nThe most common way of making an insta-undock is to use a very fast MWD frigate. Undock from the station and burn away. It is also possible to use mid-warp bookmarks, celestial alignment or lucky signatures. The insta-undock bookmark should ideally be far enough from the station so that it is not on the same grid. This way you will disappear from their overview after warping to it.\n\nIt should be noted that the ship heading has a small random variance on undock.\n\nUsing insta-undocks is not recommended for slow ships. A well-placed combat prober will be able to probe a slow ship at the landing position before the slow ship is able to warp away.\n\nTactical\n\nTactical bookmarks are bookmarks that are on grid with a point of interest (such as station or stargate) but far enough that hostiles on the grid will not be a danger to you and drag bubbles will not drag you. They should be at a minimum, 200 km away so that warping between the target and the bookmark is always possible.\n\nTactical bookmarks can be used to check the target grid before warping in or to prey on passing by ships, ready to warp in as soon as the victim arrives.\n\nTactical bookmarks \"above\" or \"below\" the target can also be used for bypassing bubbles.\n\nTactical bookmarks can also be used for fast repositioning on grid. The recommended layout for a Tactical PvP Bookmark Setup is the classic 3 axes, 4 points per axes, with 150km separating each Bookmark Point. With this layout, almost every point around a designated area (eg. Jump Gate, POS, Station...) in a radius of 300km can be reached, allowing fast position changes as well as the famous \"50km Warp\" known to be the smallest distance a ship can warp to. if you have a target 50 km away and a tactical bookmark 200 km behind them you can warp to the bookmark at 150 km and land right on top of the target.\n\nThe fastest way to create a Tactically Bookmarked Location would be the combined use of Micro Jump Drives (MJD) and Micro Warp Drives (MWD), although it was rarely used in the middle of a fleet fight, these could allow fast creation of such Bookmarks in those situations.\n\nEnder's View of Tactical bookmarks\n\nFor those who are a fan of the book Ender's Game:\n\nWhile at first glance, an undocking ship appears to travel in a straight line, remember this is space and the orientation is in the eye of the beholder. Accordingly, Ender would articulate that when you undock, you are really \"falling\". Thus, the bookmark behind the undock point represents the High Ground of any combat situation. (If you want to see it in practice, imagine someone is shooting at you from behind the station the next time you undock; try to turn around and burn towards the hypothetical aggressor, and enjoy getting stuck bumping into the station.)\n\nOnce you have established this collection of bookmarks around a station, you can extend the thinking to key stargates within the system. The \"high ground\" of a stargate is either the path that is furthest away from the sun or furthest away from your home station.\n\nBubbling\n\nFinding a good spot for a warp disruption bubble takes time. So if you think you may be camping the same stargate in the future, you will want to save the location where you want your bubble to be.\n\nLimits\n\nThe number of bookmarks that a capsuleer can have is limited.\n\nEach personal bookmark folder can contain 3,000 bookmarks.\n\nA capsuleer can have up to 30 personal bookmark folders (online + offline)\n\nA capsuleer can have up to five personal bookmark folders online at once.\n\nEach shared bookmark folder can contain 500 bookmarks.\n\nA capsuleer can be connected to up to 30 shared bookmark folders (online + offline)\n\nA capsuleer can have up to three shared bookmark folders online at once.\n\nBookmarks in shared folders become usable 2 minutes after being added.\n\nChanges to shared bookmark folder access take up to 5 minutes to apply.\n\nUse\n\nBookmarks can be used as a target for Warp to and Align to, when in the same system, and to create waypoints on the route planner.\n\nBookmarks as a target can be accessed through the in-space right-click menu and the \"Locations in <System>\" folder.\n\nTo use the in-space menu right-click on a free spot somewhere in space. Hover over Locations (only present when there are bookmarks in the system) to expand the locations(bookmark) list. Clicking on a bookmark will start the warp to the location, this is always a warp to 0 regardless of the default setting of \"Warp to Within\".\n\nNote: The objects above the Locations option work similarly way except that the warp to will be to the default \"Warp to Within\" distance.\n\nUsing the \"Locations in <System>\" can be done, docked in the Locations window or through either of the two freestanding forms (See Root folders) of the \"Locations in <System>\" folder. Use of the bookmarks here is done by either right-clicking which offers the bookmark options menu or click and hold to invoke the radial menu.\n\nBookmarks have an options menu which among others has the option to warp to a specific distance and align to the location. The default \"Warp to Within\" distance can also be set here. This menu is activated by hovering over a bookmark.\n\nWaypoints are set by using a bookmark's right-click menu or the radial menu (When available). This can be done everywhere a bookmark can be accessed.\n\nCreate\n\nBookmarks are created through the New Location window The window has the following fields:\n\nLabel - The name of the bookmark. Pre-filled with for\n\ncoordinate bookmarks - \"Spot in <System name> solar system\"\n\nobject bookmarks - the name of the object\n\nNotes - Optional field for notes about the bookmark\n\nDon’t try to write labels and notes in stressful situations - just save the bookmark.\n\nFolder - A selection list with the available (sub-)folders where the bookmark will be saved. The folder of the last saved bookmark is kept as the active selection\n\nExpiry - The automatic delete time. Choose an option by selecting the corresponding radio button. The setting of the last saved bookmark is kept on a per folder base\n\nNever\n\nIn 2 Days\n\nIn 3 Hours\n\nBookmarks are saved when the Submit button is clicked. When saving a coordinate bookmark the saved coordinates are from the position the ship is in when the button is clicked, even when in mid-move/warp. Object bookmarks save the coordinates from the object regardless of where your ship is.\n\nTips and tricks\n\nProbes in space can be bookmarked, useful for creating perches on gates for example. See Bookmarking probes\n\nImportant: When an object is destroyed or moved the bookmark still points to the original position\n\nExpiry can not be edited, but it can be canceled.\n\nThe same label can be used for multiple bookmarks. Identical labels will not overwrite each other.\n\nCreating a second bookmark of the same object will cause a warning. If the warning is ignored a new bookmark is created for that object.\n\nOpening the New Location window when docked will start the creation of an object bookmark. This will not change when undocking\n\nOpen the New Location window\n\nThe window can be opened in several ways:\n\nFor coordinate bookmarks.\n\nOpen the Locations window and click the Add Location button.\n\nUse the hot-key (default: CTRL+B).\n\nFor object bookmarks\n\nUse the right-click option Save Location on an object (some objects, like ships, can not be saved and thus do not have the option)\n\nThis option will work on, among others, - brackets in space - objects in the overview - objects in the market window - objects in the agent mission offer window - linked objects and agents in chat, mail and the notebook, anomalies and fully identified (green - 100%) signatures in the probe window and more.\n\nUse the radial menu. The push-pin on the second level.\n\nOpen the Locations window and click the Add Location button (Only when docked).\n\nShare\n\nBookmarks are shared by placing them in a shared folder. For the bookmarks to be available the folder must be connected.\n\nAccess to a shared folder is governed by Access Lists. Before creating a shared folder at least one access list must exist to be used for the folder.\n\nShared folders have four different levels of access. Higher access levels include all the features of lower access levels.\n\nView access: View folder and contents, and use locations.\n\nUse access: Add locations, edit/delete own locations, copy locations, create sub-folders, edit/delete own sub-folders.\n\nManage access: Edit/delete all locations and all sub-folders.\n\nAdmin access: Rename/delete the folder and access management[Note 1]. Additionally, connect to the shared folder without a connection link.\n\nConnection link\n\nNon \"Admin access\" users need a connection link to connect to a shared folder. To create a connection link drag the shared folder into chat, a chat channel's MOTD or EVE mail. Clicking on the connection link will add the folder to the Location window, when having access permission, and not having reached the connections limit.\n\nWhen creating a shared folder the connection link can also be dragged from the confirmation window.\n\n\"Admin access\" users do not need a connection link, they can connect to a shared folder via the \"Shared folders With Admin Access\" folder.\n\nCreate a shared folder\n\nIf you haven't already done so, create an Access List and add the contacts you wish to share the folder with to it.\n\nOpen the \"Locations\" window (Neocom -> Personal -> Locations, default shortcut L)\n\nClick the Create Folder button\n\nEnter a folder name (Required)\n\nEnter notes (Optional)\n\nSelect the Shared folder option and:\n\nAssign an access list for Admin access (Required)\n\nAssign access lists to the other access levels as wanted (Optional)\n\nClick Submit\n\nOrganize and manage\n\nAs time goes by you will create a lot of bookmarks and if you don’t organize and manage them, you will mess them up. This section presents some basic techniques that can be used to avoid that. The following are not strict rules. They are, however, built upon solid experience. In time, feel free to develop your own style and system. Corporations or elements thereof may have as EVE Unis WHC does, rules for labeling\n\nLabel\n\nThe most important part of organizing bookmarks is labeling. In stressful situations, you have to be able to recognize the right bookmark and use it in an instant. Therefore, bookmark labels need to have a standard, easily recognizable format. It is important to create - and use - an efficient way to label bookmarks from the beginning. You will thank yourself in the future.\n\nBefore labeling bookmarks, you should familiarize yourself with the information automatically stored with the bookmarks in the Locations window.\n\nLabel\n\nName assigned to the bookmark.\n\nType\n\nType of bookmark. Either \"Coordinate\" for coordinate bookmarks or the type of the bookmarked object like \"Station\", \"Citadel\", \"Refinery\" etc for object bookmarks.\n\nJumps\n\nNumber of jumps from the current location.\n\nSOL\n\nSolar system the bookmark is located in.\n\nCON\n\nConstellation the bookmark is located in.\n\nREG\n\nRegion the bookmark is located in.\n\nDate\n\nDate and time of creation.\n\nExpiry\n\nDate and time of auto-deletion.\n\nCreator\n\nName of the capsuleer that created the bookmark\n\nThis information is visible in (sort-able) columns on the Locations window and apart from Label and Expiry (limited) can not be edited.\n\nTry not to use information already available in the Locations window for bookmark labels, and keep it as simple as possible because you may need to find a bookmark in an instant in case of an emergency or a strict situation.\n\nLocations window\n\nThe Locations window is the central repository of bookmarks. It has a three-level structure of root folders, folders and sub-folders.\n\nFolders and sub-folders can be used to organize bookmarks. Folders are also used to control the availability and the visibility in space (see § Folder status).\n\nBookmark data is divided into 9 columns: Label, Type, Jumps, SOL, CON, REG, Date, Expiry and Creator (See § Label for a description).\n\nBookmarks that are in the current system are highlighted, with the color depending on the Color Theme in use.\n\nA folder, of any level, can be opened in its own, stand-alone window by using the right-click menu option \"Open Group Window\" or double-clicking the folder. Opening a folder in its own window automatically collapses the folder in the Locations window. Expanding that folder in the Locations window will close the stand-alone folder.\n\nRoot folders\n\nThe Locations window has four build-in \"root\"-folders:\n\nLocations in <System>: This folder is managed by the game and will contain all personal and shared bookmarks that are in online folders in the current system\n\nIt has a second stand-alone window form that differs from the standard one as it has fewer(3) and different columns (Labels, Folder and Expiry). This folder is opened by clicking on the icon on the far right of the folder name in the Locations window[Note 2].\n\nPersonal Locations: This folder contains folders with your personal bookmarks that only you can see.\n\nShared Locations: This folder contains folders that either are shared with others or others have shared with you.\n\nAgent missions: This folder is managed by the game and will contain all bookmarks to locations that are related to accepted missions.\n\nThe root folders Personal- and Shared Locations are divided into player-controlled folders and sub-folders. There must be at least one folder to be able to store bookmarks.\n\nFolders\n\nFolders can contain a mixture of sub-folders and bookmarks. Folders are used to control the usability of the bookmarks within (online/offline), the visibility of bookmarks in space and, in the case of shared folders: access control.\n\nFolders are created by clicking the Create Folder button. Folders can not be moved or copied. Folders can be edited or deleted through the right-click menu. (See also § Create a shared folder)\n\nSub-folders\n\nSub-folders can be created inside folders and can only contain bookmarks. Sub-folders can be used to control visibility in space.\n\nSub-Folders can be created by clicking the Create Subfolder button or through the folder's right-click menu. Sub-folders can not be moved or copied. Sub-folders can be edited or deleted through the right-click menu.\n\nAdministrative folders\n\nThese folders are controlled by the game.\n\nOffline Folders\n\nWhen one or more folders have the offline status this folder is created and the offline folders are placed in it. When there are no more folders with offline status this folder is automatically removed. This folder can exist in both Personal- and Shared Folders\n\nShared folders With Admin Access\n\nThis folder contains all the shared folders with \"Admin access\" permission regardless of their statuses (connected/disconnected - online/offline). The statuses are visible behind the folders.\n\nFolder status\n\nStatus Applicable to Description online / offline (Shared) Folders Controls whether the bookmarks are available for use and the availability of the folder when creating a bookmark.\n\nOffline/online status is managed through the right-click menu.\n\nWhen a folder is offline it is moved to the \"Offline Folders\" folder and appears grayed-out. visible / invisible (Shared) Folders\n\nSub-folders Controls the visibility of bookmarks in space.\n\nThe visibility status is indicated and managed by the eye symbol behind the folder name. Green means visible, and grey means hidden.\n\nClicking the eye symbol swaps the status. connected / disconnected Shared folders Controls whether a shared folder is available.\n\nDisconnected folders with \"Admin access\" permission can be reconnected through the \"Shared folders With Admin Access\" folder. Reconnecting to shared folders without \"Admin access\" requires the connection link (see § Share).\n\nOpen the Locations window\n\nThe locations window can be opened by:\n\nusing the Neocom menu: Personal > Locations\n\nusing the Neocom short-cut icon: Locations[Note 3]\n\nusing the hot-key (Default: L)\n\nEdit\n\nOnly bookmarks in online folders can be edited. Editable fields are Label, Notes and Folder. Changing the Folder effectively moves the bookmark.\n\nExpire can be sort of edited in that a set expiration time can be canceled making the bookmark permanent.\n\nThe edit window is accessed through the bookmarks right-click option \"Edit Location\".\n\nCopy and move\n\nCopying and moving bookmarks can only be done between online folders.\n\nBookmarks are copied by Ctrl+Shift-dragging a bookmark on top of the destination folder.\n\nBookmarks are moved by either Ctrl-dragging a bookmark on top of the destination folder or by changing the folder when editing the bookmark.\n\nWhen using the drag method multiple bookmarks can be copied/moved in a single action. When using the drag method bookmarks of multiple source folders can be copied/moved in a single action. Selecting multiple bookmarks is done by either Ctrl-clicking individual bookmarks or, for consecutive bookmarks by clicking on the first and then Shift-clicking the last bookmark.\n\nDelete\n\nOnly bookmarks in online folders can be deleted. Bookmarks can be deleted via the bookmarks right-click option \"Remove Location\" in the Locations window or on the bookmark brackets. When doing so in the Locations window multiple bookmarks, in multiple folders, can be deleted in a single action.\n\nSelecting multiple bookmarks is done by either Ctrl-clicking individual bookmarks or, for consecutive bookmarks by clicking on the first and then Shift-clicking the last bookmark.\n\nNote: When deleting a (sub-)folder the bookmarks in it will be deleted as well.\n\nNotes"
