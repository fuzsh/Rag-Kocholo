Advertising Claims\n\nCan a manufacturer advertise that their product does not contain a certain active ingredient (e.g., “DEET free”)? LC21-1208; 10/14/21\n\nClaims such as “free of [active ingredient]” or “contains no [active ingredient]” may constitute misbranding and may need to be removed. EPA is concerned that users might understand these types of statements to be safety claims. This could give users the impression that products without a certain active ingredient are safe or safer than products with the active ingredient, which may be false or misleading. Safety claims are considered false or misleading statements that constitute misbranding under 40 CFR 156.10(a)(5)(ix) and (x). Misleading comparative claims about the safety of the product versus other products also constitute misbranding under 40 CFR 156.10(a)(5)(iv) and (vii). These claims are therefore disallowable under FIFRA sections 2(q)(1)(A) and 12(a)(1)(E).\n\nConsumers can readily determine if a pesticide product contains an active ingredient (e.g., DEET) by reviewing the active ingredients listed on the front panel of the label in accordance with 40 CFR 156.10(g). Because all active ingredients must be listed, the absence of an active ingredient in the ingredient statement would indicate it is not in the product.\n\nIf my clear waterbased roof coating contains the EPA-recommended maximum dosage of an already EPA-registered fungicide/mildewcide, can I claim on my marketing pieces that my coating contains an EPA-registered fungicide/ mildewcide as long as I do not specify the kinds of fungus/ mildew it prevents growth of on the film? Also, would I need to list that EPA-registered fungicide/ mildewcide on my label and literature? LC13-0656; 08/30/13\n\n40 CFR 152.25(a) provides an exemption from the requirements of registration for qualified treated articles or substances. The exemption provision states that “an article or substance treated with, or containing, a pesticide to protect the article or substance itself (for example, paint treated with a pesticide to protect the paint coating, or wood products treated to protect the wood against insect or fungus infestation), [is exempt] if the pesticide is registered for such use.”\n\nIf your product otherwise qualifies for the treated article exemption, you may make claims about the pesticide in your product so long as each of the requirements cited above continues to be met and none of your claims or statements state or imply in any way that the pesticide provides any benefit beyond mere protection of the treated product itself.\n\nIf any of the above-cited requirements are not met or if any of the statements or claims state or imply in any way that the pesticide is protecting more than the treated product itself, the treated product would need to be registered.\n\nMay a FIFRA-exempt 25(b) label state:“Bedbugs are small parasitic insects that feed on the blood of humans. Use...to eliminate infestation.\"? LC12-0546; 08/02/12\n\nPesticides qualify for an exemption from registration requirements as described at 40 CFR 152.25(f) [promulgated under the authority of FIFRA 25(b)] if they:\n\ncontain only active ingredients listed at 40 CFR 152.25(f)(1);\n\ncontain only permitted inerts as described in 40 CFR 152.25(f)(2); and\n\nmeet all of the conditions listed in 40 CFR 152.25(f)(3).\n\nOne of the conditions in 40 CFR 152.25(f)(3) is that such product \"must not bear claims either to control or mitigate microorganisms that pose a threat to human health, including but not limited to disease transmitting bacteria or viruses, or claims to control insects or rodents carrying specific diseases, including, but not limited to ticks that carry Lyme disease.” While the Agency does consider bedbugs to be pests of significant public health importance (see PR Notice 2002-1), the claim “bedbugs are small parasitic insects that feed on the blood of humans. Use ... to eliminate infestation” does not indicate that bedbugs carry specific diseases and therefore does not itself disqualify a pesticide product from the exemption.\n\nAnother condition in 40 CFR 152.25(f)(3) is that the pesticide labeling not include any false and misleading statements. To meet this condition, all claims, such as a claim that the product will eliminate bedbug infestation, should be substantiated in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s guidelines for substantiating advertising. More information on FTC's guidelines.\n\nDoes the Agency distinguish between repellency claims and resistance claims for purposes of determining whether a product is a pesticide? For example, if a mulch product claimed to “resist insects” would that constitute a pesticide claim? If “resists insects” is considered a pesticide claim would the mulch in this example require registration prior to being offered for sale? LC12-0525; 05/24/12\n\nFIFRA section 2(u) defines pesticide, in part, as “any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest.” As explained in 40 CFR 152.15(a), when a person distributes or sells a substance with claims that it can or should be used for a pesticidal purpose (e.g. preventing, destroying, repelling or mitigating pests), the substance must be registered unless it has otherwise been exempted from the requirement for registration in 40 CFR 152 Subpart B.\n\nProduct claims are considered to be pesticidal if they are synonymous with “preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating pest.” Claims are judged on a case-by-case basis considering the context in which they are made, but it is likely that a claim that mulch “resists insects” would be considered a pesticidal claim because \"resisting\" pests is similar to \"preventing, destroying, repelling or mitigating\" pests.\n\nOne exception is products containing no toxicants that are intended to exclude pests only by providing a physical barrier against pest access are not considered pesticides because EPA has determined they are not intended for a pesticidal purpose. 40 CFR 152.10(c). Unless the mulch fits this exception or is otherwise exempt, it would need to be registered to be sold or distributed in the United States. For more detail on what pesticide products are exempt from registration requirements see Pesticide Registration Manual: Chapter 1.\n\nThe Department of Pesticide Regulation's Legal Office is currently reviewing the label of a pool filter product that contains diatomaceous earth. The company is claiming that the product is not a pesticide. However, their packaging states the product \"removes dirt, harmful pathogens and microbes down to 2 microns.\" On one hand, the diatomaceous earth filter could be seen as a physical barrier, which would not require registration. On the other hand, the reference to \"harmful pathogens\" seems to be getting into the arena of a public health claim. Would U.S. EPA consider this product to be a pesticide requiring registration? LC11-442; 10/6/11\n\nThe label statement “removes pathogens and microbes down to 2 microns” is a pesticidal claim. In order for the product to qualify as a barrier product under 40 CFR 152.10(c), the product the following conditions must be met:\n\nThe product is not intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate a pest, or to defoliate, desiccate or regulate the growth of plants.\n\nThe product or article does not make a pesticidal claim on the labeling or in connection with sale and distribution.\n\nThe product is intended to exclude pests only by providing a physical barrier against pest access, and contains no toxicants.\n\nBased on the criteria listed above, this product does not appear to qualify as a barrier because it makes a pesticidal claim and is intended to mitigate a pest (the pathogens) . The product would also not be classified as a pesticidal device since it contains a substance “diatomaceous earth,” which is contained in a number of EPA registered products. Therefore, this product would be a pesticide and subject to regulation under FIFRA.\n\nCan you put on the label of a registered pesticide a statement that is a \"new and improved\" or \"next generation\" version of a previously unregistered pesticide? LC10-0353; 05/07/10\n\nHistorically, EPA has allowed the claim \"new\" to be used on labeling for a period of six months following approval of a new registration. \"New\" has not historically been allowed as part of a product name. Terms or marketing claims such as \"improved,\" \"next generation,\" etc. are reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they are false or misleading and therefore not allowable. A review of the complete label is needed to determine the acceptability of such terms. See Label Review Manual, Chapter 12, Section VII.\n\nMay a label contain advertising for a registrant's other products? For example, may it show pictures of fertilizer and other pesticide products the registrant distributes and say \"For More Lawn and Garden Products visit. . .(website)\"? LC09-0284; 11/4/09\n\nYes, this is allowed as you have described so long as the reference to other products is (1) not false or misleading and (2) does not detract from required label information. See FIFRA 2(q)(1)(A); (2)(q)(1)(E. If either condition is not met, the product is misbranded and cannot be sold or distributed. FIFRA 12(a)(1)(E). To avoid a product being misbranded, EPA suggests the following guidance for registrants when adding references (including pictures and/or website addresses) to other products including pesticides on a label:\n\nIt should be very clear that those products are separate and distinct from the subject product, ie. such references to these other products should be clearly distinct from the required labeling of the subject product. It is especially important that reference to other products does not distract users from reading the labeled product's Directions for Use.\n\nThe advertising should not contain mandatory language saying another specified product must be used in order to achieve control/relief. Any requirement that products be used in combination to achieve efficacy for a pesticide product must be part of the Directions for Use and must be evaluated by EPA as part of the granting of a registration.\n\nThe registrant should understand that any reference to a website makes that website labeling and therefore subject to more searching EPA review than if it were not referenced. Future versions of a website referenced on a label will also subject to the same review, though at this time the Agency does not require notification or approval of such changes.\n\nPlease note that distributor products are not allowed to add claims to the label that have not been approved on the parent product's label. 40 CFR 152.132(d). Therefore, a distributor may not add advertising for its other products unless such advertising is also on the parent product's label.\n\nA lawn care operator (LCO) has advertising in a local newspaper advertising its service, claiming mosquito and other pest elimination from customer yards. At the bottom of the ad, it states \"Safe.\" Is stating a service using a registered product is “safe” in an advertisement a violation of FIFRA or its associated regulations? (LC08-0177)\n\nSection 12(a)(1)(B) of FIFRA makes unlawful any sale or distribution of “any registered pesticide if any claims made for it as a part of its distribution or sale substantially differ from any claims made for it as a part of the statement required in connection with its registration.” The statement required for registration must include “a statement of all claims to be made for [the pesticide].” FIFRA 3(c)(1)(C).\n\nEPA generally has not allowed the use of “safe” in labeling because it has been considered to be false or misleading. 40 CFR § 156.10(a)(5)(ix). False and misleading claims make a product misbranded and sale and distribution of such product unlawful. See FIFRA §§ 2(q)(q)(A); 12(a)(1)(E). If use of the term “safe” has not been allowed in labeling and use of the term hasn’t been otherwise approved, use of “safe” in advertising the sale or distribution of a pesticide product would generally be considered to substantially differ from what was approved in the registration and sale or distribution of the pesticide would be unlawful under section 12(a)(1)(B) of FIFRA.\n\nIt is important to point out, however, that Section 12(a) is limited to unlawful sale or distribution, which is defined in FIFRA 2(gg) to exclude \"the holding or application of registered pesticides ... by any applicator who provides a service of controlling pests without delivering any unapplied pesticide to any person so served.\" See also FIFRA 2(e)(1). This limits EPA's authority to regulate advertising claims made by certain home lawn care service companies that do not sell or distribute pesticides but merely apply them. To the extent EPA lacks regulatory authority over advertising of services, however, the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) broad authority to regulate advertising provides a means to regulate and enforce against excessive or misleading claims made by lawn care operators. Therefore, lawn care operators that do not sell or distribute pesticides but make false or misleading claims about their services, may be subject to enforcement by the FTC.\n\n2. Antimicrobial Claims\n\nCan an antimicrobial product to be used as a hard surface disinfectant have a contact time of greater than 10 minutes? There currently don't appear to be any guidance documents prohibiting contact times of greater than 10 minutes for hard disinfectants. LC11-0481; 12/08/11\n\nWhile the Agency reviews proposed contact times for disinfectant products on a product-by-product basis, in general, the Agency does not accept a hard surface disinfectant contact time of greater than 10 minutes unless the material to be disinfected is to be immersed in the disinfectant product solution as part of the disinfection process. Disinfectants that are applied to surfaces that are not immersed in the disinfectant product solution will dry out and therefore contact with the disinfectant product solution will generally not last longer than 10 minutes.\n\nThe Agency recommends the use of the AOAC International Use-Dilution Methods or the AOAC International Hard Surface Carrier Test Methods (distilled water only) to develop efficacy data to support a disinfectant claim. These methods specify a contact time of 10 minutes or less. In addition, on January 27, 2010 the Agency made available to the public for comment its draft proposed 810.2000 Series Product Performance Guidelines which included draft proposed guidelines for disinfectant treatment of hard surfaces. The proposed disinfectant guidelines for use of antimicrobials on hard surfaces (810.2200) would, once they are final, specify that disinfection of hard surfaces be achieved within a disinfectant product contact time of 10 minutes or less.\n\nIs it allowable to have a statement on an unregistered cleaning product that makes a claim saying \"Compare to the Cleaning Performance of ...\" a specific EPA registered antimicrobial pesticide product? LC11-0441; 11.30.11\n\nEPA does not have jurisdiction over cleaning products that make no pesticidal claims. However, a label that compares properties of a cleaning product to those of a registered pesticide product appears to make a pesticidal claim, which would likely result in the need to register the cleaning product bearing such claim.\n\nWhat are the standard levels of Quaternary Ammonium for sanitation? 200 ppm is accepted as the minimum, is there a maximum level that is acceptable or a range, say 200 - 400 ppm? LC11-444; 10/6/11\n\nThere are no “standard levels” of a quaternary ammonium that can be used for sanitization. The dosage rate for a sanitization claim is determined by efficacy data that are required to be submitted since sanitization is a public health claim. There are limits established in 40 CFR 180.940 (tolerance exemptions for food contact sanitizers) regarding the ppm level of a solution containing a quaternary ammonium that can be used on a food contact surface. For some quaternary ammonium compounds the maximum level is 200 ppm while for other quaternary ammonium compounds the solution can contain up to 400 ppm. The rate specified on the product label determines the ppm level that can be used in a sanitizing solution whether it is used on non-food or food-contact surfaces.\n\nSodium hypochlorite is commonly used in drinking water as a disinfectant. Can you tell me what the current sodium hypochlorite levels that are allowed for drinking water use and who has a label approved for such use? LC11-405; 5/19/11\n\nResidues of sodium hypochlorite in water are measured as available chlorine. In 1998, the Office of Water (OW) working with the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) established a maximum residual disinfectant level (MRDL) of 4.0 mg/L (ppm) for chlorine (40 CFR 141.54) that is allowable in community water systems (CWSs) and nontransient noncommunity water systems (NTNCWs) from either a primary or secondary disinfectant treatment. View the Federal Register Notice for the final rule (88 pp, 1,011K, About PDF).\n\nIn general, the Agency does not identify and/or recommend specific pesticide products. Therefore, we suggest that you contact your local water utility to determine what disinfectant products they may be using.\n\nWhen is the \"General Precautions\" statement required on an antimicrobial label? Is the statement required when it is marketed for a hospital or medical facility? If it does not have a hospital or medical claim or the label is for residential do they need the \"General Precautions\" paragraph? LC11-403; 5/19/11\n\nIn general, there are no differences in the precautionary statements required for a hospital product versus a residential product. Precautionary statements may vary among specific products due to the hazards that may be posed by the particular product in question. The major differences between product labels for hospital products versus residential products are differences in the use directions including the use sites and pests.\n\nA “General Precautions” statement is not a required label statement and thus does not have to be used on either a hospital or a residential product. Many companies choose to use that format to organize the precautionary information provided to the user. The precautionary statements required on a label are specified in Subparts D and E of 40 CFR Part 156. Further, EPA may require product specific precautionary label statements on a case-by-case basis through the registration process.\n\nSeveral customers have requested confirmation of what is allowed concerning claims for antimicrobial products. The question has arisen due to the fact that the Agency has allowed claims of effectiveness against H1N1 when the product has a claim against any Influenza A strain. For example, if a product is registered as effective against a single Salmonella species can it be claimed that the product is effective against Salmonella in general? LC10-0371; 08/13/10\n\nIn general, the Agency requires registrants to submit efficacy data to support all public-health-related label claims. If a registrant wants to list a specific public-health microorganism on their product label, they would need to generate and submit efficacy data showing the product is effective against that specific microorganism.\n\nIn the case of H1N1, the Agency believed a different approach was needed due to the emerging threat posed by the spread of Pandemic 2009 H1N1 Influenza A Virus. Thus, the Agency used an approach based on the determination that data submitted to support a claim for control of any Influenza A virus was sufficient to support a label claim against Pandemic 2009 H1N1 Influenza A virus. This determination was in part based on the fact that efficacy data that support use against Influenza A also support use against different strains within the same type of virus. See Guidance for Testing and Labeling Claims against Pandemic 2009 H1N1 Influenza A Virus. Search EPA Archive\n\nHowever, in the case of Salmonella, 1) the pandemic scenario is not present and 2) the genus of Salmonella is a much broader category of organisms than is encompassed by the Influenza A virus type. Species of Salmonella include those that are resistant to antibiotics as well as those associated with food-borne illness or typhoid fever. Efficacy data on a singles species are not adequate to support a general Salmonella claim; therefore, data must be submitted to support each Salmonella species listed on the label.\n\nI work for a state regulatory agency that regulates Day and Home care operations. We have a rule that requires our operations to use specific disinfecting solutions, one of them being a \"commercial grade product that meets the EPA's standards for \"hospital grade\" germicide\". In reviewing your website, it seems you do not use this term often. The term you use in \"disinfectant\". Are these two terms inter-changeable? Secondly, do you have a list of EPA- approved hospital grade germicides available? Is there another term our inspectors should be looking for? (LC09-0268; 8.13.09)\n\nEPA does not categorize disinfectants as “commercial grade” or “hospital grade.” In fact, those types of descriptors are generally considered as misleading with respect to the chemical’s composition and effectiveness (156.10(a)(5)(i) and (ii)) because such statements could lead purchasers to believe they are getting a more effective product which is not necessarily the case.\n\nOn the other hand, an antimicrobial product label may bear instructions for use in the hospital or medical environment if, among other things, the product passes efficacy testing for such use(s). The efficacy testing guidelines for such products are contained in 91-2(d)(3) of Subdivision G of the Pesticide Assessment Guidelines. Specifically, to be registered for use in a hospital or medical setting (such as a nursing home, day care center, doctors office), the product must be approved as a broad spectrum disinfectant and also must be proven through efficacy testing to be effective against the nosocomial bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additional claims may be made if testing against other specified microorganisms demonstrates that the product is efficacious. Information on efficacy testing for such products can be found in the Subdivision G testing guidelines and at Disinfectants for Use on Hard Surfaces.\n\nWe do not keep a list of EPA registered antimicrobial products that have been registered for use in hospitals.\n\nTo assess whether products can be used in hospitals, your inspectors should look for disinfectant products with directions for use in hospitals.\n\nAn antimicrobial sanitizer label contains directions for use on food-contact surfaces that require a one-minute contact time although the data requirement for such products specifies only a 30-second performance test. The FDA Food Code, which is used by state and local jurisdictions to develop their own food safety rules, allows as little as a 7-second exposure time under certain circumstances. Is it a violation of the EPA label to use the described sanitizer product in a commercial dishwasher with a 10-second final rinse time (the only contact time with the sanitizer is during the 10-second rinse)? LC09-0254; 6.26.09\n\nIt is a violation to use a registered pesticide in a manner inconsistent with its labeling, FIFRA § 12(a))(2)(G). Therefore, it would be a violation of the label to use a registered sanitizer product at less than the contact time specified on the product label. The Food Code may provide a minimum exposure time where it applies but it does not supersede a pesticide’s labeling. In your example, the 10-second final rinse time is the only time during which the sanitizer contacts the surfaces it is sanitizing, therefore the sanitizer is being used inconsistently with its labeling which requires a one-minute contact time.\n\nCan a sanitizer spray be considered to be effective against microorganisms other than those specifically listed on the label if the manufacturer has data to back up the claims? (LC08-0234; 2.26.09)\n\nFIFRA section 12(a)(1)(B) makes it unlawful for any person to distribute or sell any registered pesticide “if any claims made for it as a part of its distribution or sale substantially differ from any claims made for it as a part of the statement required in connection with its registration.” Accordingly, to make lawful claims, including providing or referencing data in connection with the product's sale or distribution, that a sanitizer spray is effective against specific pests, a registrant must submit those proposed claims and supporting data to EPA for approval as a part of its registration package and obtain EPA approval of the proposed claims.\n\nFIFRA section 2(ee) does allow a user to apply “a pesticide against any target pest not specified on the labeling if the application is to the crop, animal, or site specified on the labeling, unless the Administrator has required that the labeling specifically state that the pesticide may be used only for the pests specified on the labeling after the Administrator has determined that the use of the pesticide against other pests would cause an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment.” It must be noted that with respect to antimicrobial pesticides targeted against human pathogens, 40 CFR Part 168.22(b)(5) states that EPA will regard as unlawful the placement or sponsoring of advertisements which recommend or suggest the purchase or use of a registered pesticide for an unregistered use even if the use would be permitted by FIFRA section 2(ee).\n\nAn antimicrobial product uses materials from renewable resources. Will EPA permit labeling to make claims regarding renewable, naturally derived, or biodegradable materials? (LC08-0187)\n\n____ material made from X% biodegradable _____\n\n____ made from X% biodegradable _____\n\n____ made from X% biodegradable materials\n\nMade with biodegradable ______\n\nBiodegradable ____ material\n\nThis product is biodegradable (with supporting data for the liquid _________)\n\n____ made from X% naturally derived ______\n\n____ material made from X% naturally derived ______\n\n____ material made from X% renewable ______\n\n____ made from X% renewable ______\n\n____ made from X% renewable materials\n\nLabel claims are evaluated on a case-by-case basis when individual product labels are reviewed and registered. Claims regarding renewable, naturally-derived or biodegradable materials have historically been found to be not acceptable. While these terms may be factually correct in describing some of the attributes of a product, these terms can be misinterpreted as claims that relate to the safety of the product and therefore may be misleading. The terms “naturally” and “renewable” suggest that a particular product contains certain ingredients that are safer than other products that contain other ingredients. EPA does not approve claims that suggest a pesticide is safe, and does not approve claims that could be considered misleading comparative claims about the safety of a product versus other products that do not contain these same ingredients. LC08-0187; 7.8.08\n\nIn September 2011, EPA initiated a pilot program to allow claims of biodegradability for products meeting certain criteria. The criteria are posted on the Agency's website at: the Pilot Criteria for Biodegradability Claims On FIFRA Registered Products On FIFRA Registered Products.\n\nCan a pathogen name (or any portion of a pathogen name) be included in the product name of a registered pesticide? (LC08-0128; 11/8/07)\n\nA pathogen name may be included in a product name if its inclusion does not make the product misbranded because the labeling is false or misleading. See FIFRA § 2(q)(1)(A). Although the Agency discourages the use of pathogens in a product name, product names are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. If there is a concern that a name may be misleading (such as presenting a heightened efficacy claim), the Agency may require evidence that it is not misleading before we accept it.\n\nMany antimicrobial products labeling indicate use on \"highchairs\" and \"toys\" but are ambiguous as to use directions. Are \"highchairs\" and \"toys\" a food-contact surface or are they a non-food-contact surface? If \"highchairs\" and \"toys\" are a food-contact surface should there be indication in the label? Since \"highchairs\" and \"toys\" come in direct contact with infants/small children hands and mouths, there should be specific directions in antimicrobial product labels to reduce the possibility of contact and ingestion of pesticides. Infants/small children exposure to antimicrobial pesticides is not equivalent to adult. Defining \"highchairs\" and \"toys\" as a food-contact surface is a minor definition issue which could reduce \"potential\" pesticide exposure in a potentially vulnerable population (infants/small children). (LC07-0114; 9/24/07)\n\nThe use of an antimicrobial on highchairs is considered to be a food use. However, the use of an antimicrobial on toys is treated as a non-food-contact use. The Agency has not typically required a separate set of use directions for use of antimicrobials on highchairs or toys because the rate, method of treatment, target pests and other parameters are the same as for treatment of other hard non-porous surfaces that are typically found on antimicrobial labels.\n\nThe Agency does assess indirect dietary exposure for uses such as counter tops, appliances, tables, utensils, food packaging and other areas where there may be incidental contact such as high chairs. The Agency uses an FDA model (Chemistry recommendations, appendix I, II, III, IV, V) that takes into account application rates, residual solution, area of the treated surface that comes into contact with food, pesticide migration fraction and body weight. In this assessment, the Agency determines whether an additional margin of safety for infants and children is needed.\n\nThe Agency also evaluates the use of antimicrobial pesticides on toys taking into account the mouthing contact (i.e., incidental oral contact) and the completeness of the data base on toxicity and exposure. If the available data indicate that an additional margin of safety for infants and children is needed (susceptibility and sensitivity issues) then the Agency will apply it.\n\nIn regards to claims made by antimicrobial type pesticides, certain statements on labels require EPA registration (such as “kills,” “disinfects” and “sanitizes”). Does EPA consider the term “sanitary” (as in “leaves surfaces sanitary”) to be a pesticidal claim? (LC06-0012)\n\nThe Agency considers the appropriateness of the use of the term “sanitary” on product labels on a case-by-case basis. The Agency has generally interpreted the use of this term as implying a state of cleanliness. However, if, among other things, the use of the term implies a claim of antimicrobial properties, the term may be considered a pesticidal claim, and if so, the product must be registered in order for the product to retain the claim and be able to be lawfully sold or distributed in the United States. Other factors that may imply that a product’s intended use is for antimicrobial effect include whether the product is similar in composition to FIFRA-registered products that make antimicrobial claims and whether the product contains an ingredient at levels for which there is no functional reason other than pesticidal activity.\n\n3. Chemigation\n\nIs an apparatus of a pump connected to a bottle of concentrated pesticide, which in turn is hooked into a residential lawn irrigation system (sprinkler system) considered a chemigation device? Can chemigation be referred to in a residential setting? The pesticide used in this case is a 25(b) exempt product. Could other registered conventional pesticides be used? (LC06-0064)\n\nThe apparatus in question is application equipment that turns a residential lawn irrigation system into a chemigation system by introducing the pesticide into the irrigation system. Chemigation is defined in 40 CFR 170.3 as “the application of pesticides through irrigation systems.” While this regulatory definition is exclusive to agricultural settings, it is reasonable for the Agency to apply it to similar situations outside of agricultural settings such as in residential lawn irrigation systems. Thus the Agency would consider use of the apparatus described above as a chemigation application. To the extent that a label prohibits the use of a product in a chemigation system, the label prohibition must be followed.\n\nChemigation has also been addressed in the agricultural setting through PR Notice 87-1, but this notice specially states that it does not apply to any pesticide product intended solely for residential setting. However, the scope of the PR Notice was limited based on the information the Agency had on the extent of chemigation as a practice at the time. The agency is currently reviewing PR Notice 87-1 to update in accordance with changing practices and will be putting a draft out for public comment.\n\n4. Contract Manufacture\n\nOur company is looking at a repackaging project that involves receiving end-user household-type pesticides that have been returned to the retailer from which they were purchased. Assuming permission has been granted from the original registrant, can the product be repackaged and labeled with a trade name other than the original product/trade name without having to re-register the formulation? (LC06-0053)\n\nA repackaged product may be labeled with a trade name other than the original product trade name without having to re-register the formulation only if the registrant has registered the alternate brand name for that particular product registration and your company is operating under a contract with the registrant that allows you to relabel with an alternate brand name. In addition, repackaging must occur at a registered establishment in accordance with 40 CFR Part 167.\n\nIs it true that all product produced at a contract manufacturer should carry a statement 'Produced for Company X? Or since the contract manufacture is working for the registrant, is the 'producer' really the registrant - meaning that the label does not need to carry the 'Produced for Company X'? (LC06-0022)\n\nAs stated in the Code of Federal Regulations section 156.10(c) \"If the registrant's name appears on the label and the registrant is not the producer, or if the name of the person for whom the pesticide was produced appears on the label, it must be qualified by appropriate wording such as \"Packed for * * *,\" \"Distributed by * * *,\" or \"Sold by * * *\" to show that the name is not that of the producer.\"\n\nIn this case, the registrant is not the producer, irrespective of the contract manufacturing arrangement. The contract manufacturer is the producer of the pesticide, and therefore the registrant's name must be qualified with either the statement \"Produced for * * *\" or \"Manufactured for * * *.\"\n\n5. Use Sites\n\nFor commercial seed treatments, is the treated seed considered a pre-harvest use? BPPD has taken a position that commercial seed treatments are a post-harvest use, and we are looking for some clarity.\n\nIn a generic example, if the active ingredient and all the inert ingredients in a pesticide formulation are exempt from the requirement of a tolerance under 40 CFR 180.910, 180.920 and 180.950, is it necessary to use a dye for commercial seed treatments? What if an ingredient is only cleared in 180.920 (preharvest use only), is a dye required for commercial seed treatment? LC14-0813; 12/15/14\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR § 153.155(a), “[p]esticide products intended for use in treating seeds must contain an EPA-approved dye to impart an unnatural color to the seed, unless appropriate tolerances or other clearances have been established under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for residues of the pesticide.” Seeds can either be planted in order to derive a food commodity that is grown from the seed, or can be a food crop if they are to be used directly as food or feed. The inert tolerance exemptions found in 40 CFR 180.920 for pre-harvest uses apply to formulations applied to growing crops only. Because seed is not a growing crop when it is treated, an exemption under 40 CFR 180.920 is not sufficient to escape the requirement to include a dye in the pesticide product used for the treatment.\n\nHow is \"greenhouse,\" as a use site, defined by EPA? Would EPA consider cold frames to be greenhouses? (LC10-0393; 3/3/11)\n\nFor the purposes of the Worker Protection Standard (WPS), 40 CFR 170.3 defines \"greenhouse\" as \"any operation engaged in the production of agricultural plants inside any structure or space that is enclosed with nonporous covering and that is of sufficient size to permit worker entry. This term included, but is not limited to, polyhouses, mushroom houses, rhubarb houses, and similar structures.\" EPA has not defined \"greenhouse\" in the context of use sites but the WPS definition is instructive. If a cold frame is enclosed with nonporous covering and is large enough to permit worker entry, it would likely be considered a greenhouse.\n\nCleanout and disinfection of crawl spaces (area underneath houses) is a new service being provided by a number of PCO companies. We are having difficulty determining whether disinfectants can legally be used in crawl spaces. Often the sites on disinfectant labels are very broad and seem to allow treatment in any area of a structure (including the crawl space), but then the specific directions only cover areas with non-porous surfaces inside of a structure. It would be helpful for EPA to address this new use pattern and in the meantime we would appreciate some guidance on when disinfectants with current labels can be used in crawl spaces. (LC08-0176; 10/18/08)\n\nThe Agency does not have a standard definition for crawl spaces. As a result, the user must refer to the label of the disinfectant product to determine whether the product can be used to treat crawl spaces. Typical components of a crawl space include ground and bare wood. The Agency considers these surfaces to be porous surfaces. These types of surfaces cannot be treated unless the label contains directions that would allow the product to be used to disinfectant porous surfaces. If the label has language limiting applications to hard non-porous surfaces, application to a crawl space with porous surfaces would not be permitted.\n\n6. Definitions of Terms\n\nIn a preplant and planting soil treatment: is a band treatment the same as an in-furrow treatment? (LC10-0328; 6/3/10)\n\nIn-furrow treatments are always done at-plant where the granules or liquid is applied into an open seed furrow just before it is closed by the presswheel. The pesticide resides only at the bottom of the seed furrow.\n\nBanded applications are done at-plant over a closed seed furrow, postplant over the row, or post-emergent often as a side-dress application. They are usually superficially soil incorporated with drag chains or tines.\n\nA banded application at-plant over an open seed furrow, is called a T-band.\n\nPreplant applications are usually broadcast over the entire field and incorporated. They are usually referred to as Preplant Incorporated or PPI.\n\nI am trying to find the definition or examples for the areas allowed in food-handling establishments versus the non-food areas. I am also searching for the definition of spot treatment. (LC08-0223; 1.28.2009)\n\nEPA published definitions and policies related to food-handling establishments in the Federal Register on August 10, 1973, available at 38 FR 21685. The notice defined a food handling establishment as “an area or place other than a private residence in which food is held, processed, prepared and/or served.”\n\nFood areas \"include areas for receiving, serving, storage (dry, cold, frozen, raw), packaging (canning, bottling, wrapping, boxing) preparing (cleaning, slicing, cooking, grinding), edible waste storage, enclosed processing systems (mills, dairies, edible oils, syrups).\n\nNon-food areas include garbage rooms, lavatories, floor drains (to sewers), entries and vestibules, offices, locker rooms, machine rooms, boiler rooms, garages, mop closets, and storage (after canning or bottling).”\n\nThe notice also defines spot treatment as “application to limited areas on which insects are likely to occur, but which will not be in contact with food or utensils and will not ordinarily be contacted by workers. These areas may occur on floors, walls, and bases or undersides of equipment. For this purpose, a ‘spot’ will not exceed 2 square feet.”\n\nCan you provide a definition of high level and low level disinfection. I have looked all over your site. There is the disinfectant definition, but it does not explain this. (LC08-0225; 1.28.09)\n\nEPA does not have a definition for high and low level disinfection. These are terms used by FDA. More information on high and low level disinfectants. Also see guidance on review by FDA.\n\nDoes EPA recognize 29 CFR 1910.133 and (by reference) 1910.6 as the standard for labeling required safety glasses? (i.e., safety glasses need to be ANSI-approved and carry an ANSI number). If not, do you recognize any standard for safety glasses or can users use any type of glasses that have brow and temple protection? (LC08-0229; 1.28.2009)\n\nAccording to the worker protection standard and 40 CFR §170.240(7) (Protective Eyewear): “When “protective eyewear” is specified by the product labeling, one of the following types of eyewear must be worn: (i) goggle; (ii) face shield; (iii) safety glasses with front, brow, and temple protection; (iv) full face respirator.”\n\nIf no more specific instructions are included in the directions for use, any safety glasses with front, brow, and temple protection would be allowed. While the OSHA regulations you cite do not technically apply to pesticide users, EPA strongly recommends following the OSHA guidelines when choosing safety glasses.\n\n7. Distributor Product Labeling\n\nRegistrant R and Company A have entered into a supplemental distribution agreement for a pesticide product. May Company A sell the pesticide product exclusively through another distributor, Company B? If so, can the label state \"Manufactured for Company A\" and \"Distributed by Company B\"? LC13-0584; 01/15/13\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 152.132, a registrant, and only the registrant, may sell and distribute its registered pesticide product under another person's name (i.e., the \"supplemental distributor\" or \"subregistrant\"). A supplemental distributor may not sell or distribute the registrant's product under another person's name.\n\nFor the scenario above, in order for the product to be sold or distributed under Company B’s name, Registrant R must enter a supplemental distributor agreement with Company B using EPA Form 8570-5, which must be submitted to EPA prior to distribution.\n\nWe are a producer of a registered pesticide. We wish to sell the product in bulk to a refiller (distributor). The distributor then wishes to repackage our product into smaller refillable containers for re-sale. Can we:\n\nuse our label but remove our product name from the label;\n\nadd the distributor name and address and distributor registration number to the label; and\n\nchange the storage and disposal language to reflect storage and disposal requirements of a refillable product? (LC10-0369) 08/10/10​\n\nYou cannot do any of the activities you describe without the consent of the registrant. Even with the consent of the registrants, there are limitations.\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 152.132, the registrant may enter in a supplemental distributor agreement with another party to distribute a registered product under another person’s name and address instead of or in addition to the registrant’s own. For a supplemental distributor to distribute a pesticide, the registrant must notify EPA and the distributor must complete a Notice of Supplemental Distribution of a Registered Pesticide Product (EPA form 8570-5) signed by both the registrant and the distributor. 40 CFR 152.132 limits what can differ about a distributor product from the registered product. The distributor may only package the registrant’s product if the distributor is the same producer (or under contract in accordance with 40 CFR 152.30) as the producer who produces, packages, and labels the registered product. See 40 CFR 152.132(b). Further, the distributor product may not be repackaged (i.e. it remains in the producer’s unopened container). See 40 CFR 152.132(c).\n\nThe label of the supplemental registrant’s product must be the same of the registrant with the exception that:\n\nthe product name may be different;\n\nthe name and address of the distributor may appear instead of that of the registrant;\n\nthe registration number of the registered product must be followed by the distributor’s company number;\n\nthe establishment number must be that of the final establishment where the product was produced; and\n\nspecific claims may be deleted provided no other changes are necessary.\n\nThe registrant must ensure that the EPA-approved labeling of the registered product includes appropriate statements for refillable containers in accordance with 40 CFR 156 Subpart H.\n\nBecause you are the producer of the pesticide and the distributor is not, the distributor would not be able to repackage the product into smaller containers even with a supplemental distributor agreement with the registrant. Under a supplemental distributor agreement you may be able to change the product name and the distributor name, address and number. But without a change to the EPA-approved label of the registered product, you cannot change the storage and disposal language.\n\nCan a marketing statement be placed on a label that identifies the retail outlet that is offering the product for sale? If so, what are the parameters of an acceptable statement, and must the statement be submitted as an amendment\" (LC10-0329, LC10-0332) 3/11/10\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Section 156.10(c), “An unqualified name and address given on the label shall be considered as the name and address of the producer. If the name of the person for whom the pesticide was produced appears on the label, it must be qualified by appropriate wording such as “Packed for …” “Distributed by … ,” or “Sold by …” to show that the name is not that of the producer.” FIFRA 2(p)(1) defines “label” as “the written, printed, or graphic matter on, or attached to, the pesticide or device or any of its containers or wrappers.” Thus any writing appearing on the pesticide label is considered part of the label that must be approved by EPA and may not be false or misleading. Changes to the label specifying “Packed for….Distributed by…or Sold by…” are not specified in PR Notice (PR) 98-10: Notifications, Non-Notifications and Minor Formulation Amendments and therefore these label changes are considered amendments.\n\nWe recently are putting together a label for supplemental distribution. The primary registrant is telling us to avoid using any parentheses on our label (even though theirs has some). Our particular statement where we use parentheses is dosages. We typically state use x to y ppm (a to b gals per 1000 gallons).\n\nWhere a and b are simply converted values of x and y. Is this wrong? (LC10-0323) 3/11/10\n\nIn general, EPA allows the use of parentheses on a label unless:\n\nthe parentheses are used in such a way that the labeling becomes false and/or misleading; or\n\nthe use of the parentheses causes confusion making the directions for use inadequate to protect human health or the environment.\n\nThe example you cite where you provide correct ppm information to the user based on the rate on the label would generally be an acceptable use of parentheses on a label.\n\nPlease note, however, that the label of a distributor product must be identical to the master label of the parent product, except as provided in 40 CFR 152.132(d). A supplemental distributor may not present statements in parentheses on a label unless the master label of the parent product also contains the same statements in parentheses. Further, the supplemental distributor may not delete statements in parentheses that appear on the parent product's label unless they involve one of the changes allowed in 40 CFR 152.132(d).\n\n40 CFR 152.132(d) says \"the label of the distributor product is the same as that of the registered product\" ... Does that mean the label must be identical in layout, verbiage, design, etc. or does it mean the information required in 40 CFR 156 (other than excepted in 152.132(d)) must remain unchanged? (LC10-0316) 3/11/10\n\nThe supplementally distributed product must bear the same information as the parent product with the exception of the information listed in 40 CFR 152.132(d). Except for the pieces that may change, the wording must be identical. The layout and format of the label of the supplementally distributed product may differ from that of the parent product so long as the change in layout or format doesn’t make the label false or misleading.\n\nCan the registrant of a product whose company name and address appear on the primary label add a second label to the container indicating a distributor company name? Essentially this would avoid the supplemental distribution and subsequent state pesticide registration fees associated with supplemental distribution. (LC09-0298) 3/11/10\n\nExample:\n\nPrimary Container label\n\nManufactured for\n\nABC Company\n\nDistributed by or sold by:\n\nXYZ Company\n\nA registrant could add the suggested language you propose as a second label indicating a distributor company name, if the change were reflected on the master label for the product. See 156.10(c). Generally, all information on labeling needs to be approved by EPA in what is collectively referred to as the \"master\" label. Products can be sold or distributed with a subset of the master labeling provided no changes would be necessary to precautionary statements, use classifications or packaging. To add an alternate distributor name, a registrant could list the standard company name on the master label and include alternates that would be used as appropriate on products depending on how they are distributed. If added as alternative language on the master label, EPA would not treat this scenario as a supplemental distribution as described in 40 CFR 152.132. FIFRA 2(p)(1) defines \"label\" as \"the written, printed, or graphic matter on, or attached to, the pesticide or device or any of its containers or wrappers.\" Thus any writing appearing on the pesticide is considered part of the label that must be approved by EPA and may not be false or misleading. Adding distributor information to the master label, however, may have no effect on state registration fees, which are governed by state laws.\n\nIf a supplemental distributor obtains NSF registration for the distributor product but the basic registrant does not have NSF registration, can the distributor submit a notification to EPA to have the NSF logo added to the distributor label? (LC09-0291) 12/10/09\n\n40 CFR § 152.132 states: “the label of the distributor product is the same as that of the registered product” with listed exceptions. One listed exception is that the distributor may delete specific claims that are found on the basic registrant’s label. Distributors may not add claims that don't appear on the basic registrant's label. EPA considers placement on the label of a third-party certification such as the NSF logo to be a claim, and therefore a distributor may not add it to the distributor label unless it also exists on the label of the basic registrant’s product. For guidance on the use of the NSF label generally, see NSF Logo Letter.\n\nDoes the Agency allow the use of the GHS corrosive symbol on supplemental distributor labeling without the symbol being on an approved stamped label? (LC09-0192) 8/28/08\n\n40 CFR 152.132(d) requires that \"the label of the distributor product is the same as that of the registered product\" with certain listed exceptions such as the product name, registration number and establishment number. Inclusion of additional symbols or graphics on a distributor label is not one of the exceptions. Thus the basic registrant would have to add the GHS corrosive symbol to their label first before a distributor could use it.\n\nA pesticide dealer copies mixing directions from a product label, puts them on a sticker, and puts the sticker on the products he sells. He also puts a sticker with his business address on the containers. Does either sticker misbrand the products? (LC08-0232) 2/26/09\n\nBoth activities are unlawful presuming the dealer is not acting with the permission of the registrant and in accordance with various regulatory requirements. FIFRA § 12(a)(2)(A) states that it is unlawful “to detach, alter, deface, or destroy, in whole or in part, any labeling required [under FIFRA].” Putting the copied mixing directions on another product is considered labeling and must be done in a registered establishment and in accordance with the registration of the product to which the sticker is added. If the product getting stickered doesn’t include the sticker information as part of its approved labeling, the product would be misbranded.\n\nPesticide/fertilizer labels in certain states must have a label attached to the package, which includes an acceptable Internet statement (e.g., \"Information regarding the contents and levels of metals in this product is available on the Internet at: http://www.aapfco.org/metals.htm.\") Is it legal for a supplemental distributor to add the Internet statement on their supplemental distributor fertilizer/pesticide product labels when the master EPA label does not have this statement? (LC08-0197) 10/30/08\n\nThe label of a distributor product must be identical to the master label of the parent product, except as provided in 40 CFR 152.132(d). A supplemental distributor may not add statements such as that proposed in the question unless the master label of the parent product is amended to include the statement\n\nIf a registered pesticide label is distributed in both the USA and in another country does the Agency allow both the USA Distributor Company's Division Name & address and the International Distributor Company's Division Name and address on the same supplemental label? (LC08-0193)\n\n40 CFR 156.10(a)(1)(ii) requires that the name and address of the producer, registrant, or person for whom produced appear on the label. Further 40 CFR 156.10(c) requires that if the producer is not the company listed in the name and address on the label, the name and address must be qualified by a phrase such as “Distributed by,” “Produced for,” or “Sold by” to show that the name appearing on the label is not that of the producer. So long as the qualification is not false or misleading, the international distributor’s name and address may be added to the label if it is properly qualified by a phrase such as “Distributed Internationally by” or “International Distributor:”. See FIFRA sec. 2(q)(1)(A).\n\nIn a situation where a registrant voluntarily cancels a registration, the registrant generally has 18 months to continue to sell product in channels of trade. When a basic registrant terminates a supplemental registration, does the sub-registrant (the supplemental distributor) have the same 18-month period to sell product? (LC08-0156) 3/20/08\n\nEPA interprets 40 CFR 152.130(c) to generally permit a supplemental distributor 18 months to sell and distribute existing stocks after the basic registrant terminates the supplemental registration. In this context, the supplemental registrant's existing stocks are only those affected pesticide products that have been released for shipment as of the effective date of termination of the subject supplemental registration. Sale or distribution of any quantities of the affected distributor product produced after the effective date of termination would be considered illegal under FIFRA.\n\nIt is important to note that while EPA regulations may permit such distribution or sale of existing stocks for 18 months following termination of the supplemental distribution, the contractual arrangement between the basic registrant and the supplemental distributor may contain terms that further limit or preclude sale and distribution by the supplemental distributor (although such contractual arrangements would be enforceable through the courts, and not by EPA).\n\nMust a subregistrant use the warranty statement that is on the Basic Registration label? The subregistrant wants to substitute its own warranty statement. (LC08-136) 12/13/07\n\n40 CFR § 152.132(c) generally limits the changes that can be made between a registrant’s label and a supplemental distributor’s label to the:\n\nname of the product;\n\nname and address of the distributor;\n\nregistration and establishment numbers; and\n\ndeletion of claims on the distributor product.\n\nHowever, because warranty statements are not required by EPA to be on pesticide labels, the Agency will allow supplemental distributors to use their own warranty statements so long as such a change to the labeling is allowed by contract between the registrant and the distributor and the substitute warranty statement is not false or misleading. See FIFRA Compliance Program Policy No. 3.2 (May 10, 1982). Any revised warranty statement on a distributor's label cannot expand upon, either explicitly or implicitly, the uses allowed on the registrant's label and cannot conflict with the claims stated on the label. For help in developing an acceptable warranty statement, see the guidance available at the Guidance on Warranty Statements\n\nWe are a supplemental distributor registrant for a product. One of our customers would like to buy our subregistered product, but they would like to have their name and logo on the packaging. Can we label the product with our customer's name, address and logo on the front panel, qualified by \"Sold by\"; and still put our name, address, Reg. No., and Est. No. on the back panel, qualified by \"Distributed by\"? (LC08-0131) 1/31/08\n\n40 CFR 152.132(d) requires that the labeling of the distributor product be the same as that of the registered product with the following exceptions:\n\nThe product name of the distributor product may be different (but may not be misleading).\n\nThe name and address of the of the distributor may appear instead of that of the registrant.\n\nThe registration number of the registered product must be followed by a dash, followed by the distributor’s company number (obtainable from the Agency upon request).\n\nThe establishment number must be that of the final establishment at which the product was produced.\n\nSpecific claims may be deleted, provided that no other changes are necessary.\n\nThese exceptions do not allow for the supplemental distributor to put a customer’s information on the label. However, the supplemental distributor could incorporate the customer’s name into the product name (e.g. X’s insecticide) so long as the new product name is not misleading and the registrant allows the subregistrant to make such a change under any applicable contracts between the registrant and subregistrant.\n\nOur company imports a commodity chemical from outside the United States into a public warehouse. One end-use of the chemical is as an EPA-registered pesticide. The quantity of this chemical that we currently have in stock at the public warehouse is not labeled. When we receive an order for the EPA-registered pesticide, the warehouse labels packages of the product with the registrant’s label and ships it to the customer. The registrant provides the necessary labels for the warehouse to affix to each package. Do we as the distributor need to be registered in order to direct our third-party public warehouse (physically in possession of the product) to affix the labels on the registrant's behalf? Or does the warehouse need to be registered, or both? (LC07-0120)\n\nThe person doing the labeling must be doing so under the instruction of the registrant but does not have to be registered. In contrast, the warehouse where the labeling is taking place must be registered as a pesticide producing establishment since labeling is defined as production of a pesticide and all pesticide production must take place in a registered establishment. See 40 CFR Part 167. The establishment number of the warehouse where the labeling is taking place must appear on the label of the product. 40 CFR 156.10(a)(1)(v). You may obtain an establishment registration for the warehouse by contacting the EPA Regional office which has jurisdiction over the state where the warehouse is located. See more information on establishment registration process and reporting obligations.\n\nIs it acceptable for a Supplemental Distribution of a Registered Pesticide Product form to have two distributor product names listed in the box (e.g., XXX Algae Relief and Algae Pond Relief)? In the past, each distributor product has had its own form. (LC07-0105)\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 152.132(a) each distributor must complete a signed Notice of Supplemental Distribution of a Registered Pesticide Product (EPA form 8570-5), however, the form can contain more then one brand name. So, it is possible for a distributor to list two product names on the form. The names would have to be for the same registered product and be submitted by the same distributor.\n\nMy questions are in regard to a combo product, a fertilizer with a pesticide on it. When sub-registering a product, and the primary label mentions \"spreader settings\" on the label, is it a requirement for the sub-registered label, to carry this same statement about what the settings should be, or is it permissible to include a general statement of contacting the spreader manufacture for up to date settings for the product, due to the large amount of spreaders and possible changes, and also since \"spreader settings\" is not a FIFRA or 40 CFR label requirement? (LC07-0086)\n\nA distributor label under Supplemental Distribution must be the same as that of the registered product except for a limited set of exceptions, 40 CFR 152.132(d). Directions for Use are not excepted and must be identical to those of the registered product. Therefore, the “spreader settings” of the parent registered product must be used on the Distributor label, being a part of the Directions for Use. If the distributor label included any additional text not included on the registered product label, it would not be the same as the registered label, and thus in violation of the regulations.\n\nMay distributor labels differ from EPA-accepted labels? (LC07-0089)\n\n40 CFR 152.132(d) requires that \"the label of the distributor product is the same as that of the registered product\" with certain listed exceptions such as the product name, registration number and establishment number. In addition, claims may be deleted for the distributor label provided no other changes are necessary (40 CFR 152.132(d)(5)).\n\nIn situations where a product is produced by a contract manufacturer as well as the registrant, could the registrant preface his name and address on the label with the term \"produced for\" regardless of whether he is the producer or the contract manufacturer is the producer of the pesticide? (LC06-0059)\n\nA registrant may qualify his name and address with the term \"produced for\" regardless of who is the producer of the product. The registrant may also qualify his name and address with the terms \"Sold by\" or \"Distributed by,\" which are equally acceptable. See, generally, 40 CFR 156.10(c).\n\nCan a product label list the distributor's name and address on the packaging label in the absence of the distributor's company number appended to the product registration number? The product is not \"sub-registered\" to the distributor, but is an alternate brand name, with the ABN including the distributor's name. (LC06-0052)\n\nA product label may list a distributor's name and address on the label without the distributor's company number appended to the product registration number. If the distributor is not the producer of the pesticide, the distributor's name and address must be qualified as required in 40 CFR part 156.10(c).\n\nIs it a violation of FIFRA if the literature accompanying a supplemental distributor label lists more microorganisms than those listed on the distributor label even if the organisms listed in the literature are also listed on the EPA-approved master label? (LC06-0035)\n\nNo, it would not be a violation of FIFRA. With some exceptions, not relevant here, 40 CFR 152.132(d) requires that the label of the distributor product be the same as that of the registered product. The term \"label\" is defined as \"the written, printed, or graphic matter on, or attached to, the pesticide or device or any of its containers or wrappers.\" FIFRA sec. 2(p)(1). The more expansive term \"labeling\" is defined as \"all labels and all other written, printed or graphic material\" that accompanies a pesticide or device at any time or to which reference is made on the label or in literature accompanying the pesticide or device. FIFRA sec. 2(p)(2). As long as the EPA-approved master label for the registered product lists these pests, the supplemental distributor can market its product with those approved uses, claims, etc.\n\nA company is proposing to distribute a pesticide product which currently has an EPA registration number. On the front of the label, they would like to indicate their brand and on the back of the label, they would like to indicate a \"Distributed by\" notation with the address of the distributor. First, can they do this without reregistering the product? Second, does a distributor number need to be included and if so, how does a distributor become registered (and is it a per-product registration)? (LC07-6-0007)\n\nThe distribution or sale of a registered product under a distributor's name and address is called \"supplemental distribution.\" The requirements for supplemental distribution are set out in 40 CFR 152.132. The product can be distributed as a distributor product without a separate FIFRA section 3 registration. The distributor would need to be a registered company with their own company number - that company number would be used on all their distributor products. Their EPA Registration number on the distributor products would look something like this: EPA Reg. No. xxx-xxx-xxx or [parent company, number]-[product number]-[distributor company number]. The company numbers may be acquired through the nearest EPA regional office, or by written request to OPP. The Label Review Manual provides a more detailed explanation of supplemental distribution process in Chapter 14-1, Section III.\n\nIf a distributor sells a pesticide with another registrant's name and EPA information on the container, can that distributor apply a tag or label stating:\n\nSold By:\n\nXYZ Distributors\n\nAnywhere, USA\n\nThis information would only be used to identify where the consumer may have purchased the product. An example might be a garden center selling \"Round-Up\" Weed Killer and applying a small sticker to the side of the container with his name and phone number on it. (LC06-0024)\n\nA distributor may not place a tag or sticker to a product as this is considered labeling and the product would be considered misbranded.\n\nCan a box of 12 pesticides be shipped by a formulator to a private-label distributor unlabeled? EPA-approved private labels are affixed by the distributor upon receipt? Would the box need to be relabeled? (LC06-27)\n\nA formulator may ship unlabeled pesticides to a private label distributor provided the pesticides are transferred to a registered establishment and the conditions of 40 CFR Part 152.30(b) are met. The private label distributor may label the products under a contract manufacturing agreement with the registrant of the pesticide product. The container the unlabeled pesticides are shipped in must bear the label of the registered product.\n\n8. Exception to Use in a Manner Not Permitted (FIFRA Sec 2ee)\n\nDo all states have to comply with the FIFRA section 2(ee) opinion stating: \"The Agency’s current position on greenhouse application is that in accordance with FIFRA section 2(ee) a label does not have to specify greenhouse as a site, provided the crop is on the label, in order to use the product in a greenhouse.\", or are states allowed to decide that on an individual basis? LC09-0296; 3/11/10\n\nStates may further restrict the use of pesticides by enacting state requirements that do not contradict the federal labeling. For example a state could ban the use of a product at less than the labeled use rate, which FIFRA section 2(ee) normally would allow. A state could also place additional restrictions on the use of the product within the state to protect sensitive use sites such as greenhouses.\n\nDo FIFRA 2(ee) recommendations generally include rate of application requirements or is the user bound by label directions? For example, if a 2(ee) recommendation for a product applied to a pest includes a 2% use dilution recommendation, can it be applied at 5% use dilution if 5% is an allowable rate on the label? LC09-0276; 8.13.09\n\nA FIFRA 2(ee) recommendation may be made for a number reasons, one being the application of the pesticide at less than the label dosage, concentration or frequency. An applicator may apply the product at the use dilution listed on the label or at a lesser use dilution listed in the 2(ee) recommendation. A FIFRA 2(ee) recommendation is just that, a recommendation. An applicator has the option of applying a product at less than the use dilution listed on the label unless the label specifically prohibits such dilution. Note that for antimicrobial pesticides targeted against human pathogens, it is unlawful for any person selling or distributing these products to advertise uses permitted by FIFRA 2(ee). See 40 CFR 168.22(b)(5).\n\nIs placing mothballs outside on the grass along a fence line to repel cats an illegal use of mothballs? LC09-0269 and LC09-0270; 6.26.09\n\nGenerally, it is unlawful to use any registered pesticide in a manner inconsistent with its labeling under FIFRA sec. 12(a)(2)(G). At present, there are no registered pesticides containing the active ingredients in moth balls that are approved for use in repelling cats. The FIFRA section 2(ee) definition of \"to use any registered pesticide in a manner inconsistent with its labeling\" provides for certain exceptions under which use is lawful. For example, it is not unlawful to use a registered pesticide \"against any target pest not specified on the labeling if the application is to the crop, animal, or site specified on the labeling...\" This exception would not allow application of mothballs along a fence line because registered mothballs products specify the use site as \"air-tight containers and storage closets.\" Because applying mothballs to a fence line would not be applying them to a site specified on the labeling, such use is unlawful.\n\nOur specific question is in regards to the use of mothballs as a general animal repellent. We frequently encounter people who use mothballs (in an attic, in a crawl space, in the garden, etc.) to repel such animals as skunks, raccoons, opossums, etc. We inform them that this manner of control does not consistently work, and therefore, we cannot recommend it. We also would like to be able to tell them if using this chemical in this manner is illegal - in reference to the terminology found on any chemical/pesticide product that \"It is a violation of Federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.\" We are having trouble sorting through the information you provide on Use in a Manner Inconsistent with Its Labeling (FIFRA Sec 2ee). This question can also apply to such things as ammonia, bleach, kerosene, gasoline, etc. that people pour in or around such described areas (aside from the obvious that using flammable chemicals in such fashion is dangerous) - the ultimate question is \"Is it illegal?\" Please advise, as we are anxious to provide our cooperators with the most accurate information. (LC08-0190)\n\nUsing a registered pesticide like mothballs against a pest not listed on the label is legal unless (1) the pesticide is used on a site not specified on the labeling or (2) the label specifically restricts the pests against which the pesticide may be used (e.g. “for use only against ants”). This is an exception to the definition of “use of a pesticide in a manner inconsistent with its labeling” in FIFRA section 2(ee)(2) which reads in part: “…except that the term shall not include…(2) applying a pesticide against any target pest not specified on the labeling if the application is to the crop, animal, or site specified on the labeling, unless the Administrator has required that the labeling specifically state that the pesticide may be used only for the pests specified on the labeling after the Administrator has determined that the use of the pesticide against other pests would cause an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment,...” The other substances you list may be both registered for pesticidal use or available unregistered for non-pesticidal uses. While the Agency does regulate the sale and distribution of unregistered pesticides, it does not regulate the personal use of unregistered pesticides. The personal use of products that are not registered pesticides – such as ammonia, bleach, kerosene, gasoline – may be dangerous, but it is not a violation of FIFRA.\n\nA rodenticide label says a block weighs one pound and is scored to be broken into eight pieces, which means only one 2oz piece of the block is to be used per bait placement. Most of the time, 2 oz. is too much. The manufacturer says it can be used in smaller quantities based on FIFRA 2(ee). Is this correct? (LC08-0179)\n\nSection 2(ee)(1) allows applying a pesticide at any dosage, concentration, or frequency less than that specified on the labeling unless the labeling specifically prohibits deviation from the specified dosage, concentration, or frequency. So if the label at issue does not prohibit breaking the 2 oz pieces into smaller pieces, lesser amounts may be used.\n\nSection 2(ee) states an application of \"a pesticide against any target pest not specified on the labeling\" is allowed as long as the site is identified on the label. This text and meaning is very straightforward. However, EPA's interpretation and action in this regard appears to be based on tighter, unknown criteria or restrictions. Section 2(ee) says one thing but EPA appears to act differently. An example is Sevin / carbaryl that is labeled for turfgrass. EPA interpretation is that “turf-sited” Sevin / carbaryl cannot be used for the control of earthworm pests in turf? Why not? FIFRA Section 2(ee) text allows this usage. Thank you.\" (LC07-0107; 9/24/07)\n\nSection 2(ee) allows the use of a pesticide against any target pest not specified on the labeling as long as the site is identified on the label and there are no other label restrictions that would preclude use against the pest.\n\nAre there any stipulations on who can make a FIFRA 2(ee) recommendation? Can a user make a recommendation? Can the manufacturer make a recommendation to use a pesticide in a manner that would be allowed under 2(ee)? Is there any entity that cannot make a 2(ee) recommendation? (LC06 - 0056)\n\nOn October 22, 1981, EPA published a notice in the Federal Register (46 FR 51745) entitled \"Advocacy of Pesticide Uses Which Do Not Appear on Registered Pesticide Label; Statement of Policy,\" which addresses who may legally recommend or advertise uses under section 2(ee)(1-5) of FIFRA. The notice states the any person can make a recommendation under FIFRA section 2(ee)(1-5). A subsequent FR Notice (51 FR 19174) dated May 28, 1986, amended the Agency's previous position by stating that persons may not make claims under section 2(ee) for antimicrobial pesticide products targeted against microbial human pathogens.\n\nRegarding FIFRA section 2(ee) recommendations; is there a recommended expiration period (e.g., 1 year, 5 years)? Does this need to be added to the recommendation? (LC06-0015)\n\nThere is no recommended expiration period for a FIFRA section 2(ee)(1)-(5) recommendation.\n\nWhat is the proper/legal way that FIFRA section 2(ee) bulletins can be distributed by extension services, universities or others? Can they be displayed with the product? (LC06-0011)\n\nFIFRA section 2(ee) bulletins are recommendations, allowed by section 2(ee)(2) of FIFRA, advocating use of a product on a pest not specified on the labeling if the pest is on a site listed on the label and the agency has not required labeling that only allows use on specified pests. FIFRA section 2(ee) bulletins may be distributed by virtually any means; i.e., through extension personnel, industry representatives, at the point of sale, displayed with the product, or downloaded off the Internet, provided the bulletin is factually correct and conforms to the restrictions of section 2 (ee). EPA does not allow 2(ee) bulletins for antimicrobial products with public health claims (i.e., targeted against human pathogens, 40 CFR 168.22(b) (5)) or other products with such claims. FIFRA section 2(ee) reads as follows:\n\n\"(ee) TO USE ANY REGISTERED PESTICIDE IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH ITS LABELING.-The term ''to use any registered pesticide in a manner inconsistent with its labeling'' means to use any registered pesticide in a manner not permitted by the labeling, except that the term shall not include (1) applying a pesticide at any dosage, concentration, or frequency less than that specified on the labeling unless the labeling specifically prohibits deviation from the specified dosage, concentration, or frequency, (2) applying a pesticide against any target pest not specified on the labeling if the application is to the crop, animal, or site specified on the labeling, unless the Administrator has required that the labeling specifically state that the pesticide may be used only for the pests specified on the labeling after the Administrator has determined that the use of the pesticide against other pests would cause an unreasonable ad-verse effect on the environment, (3) employing any method of application not prohibited by the labeling unless the labeling specifically states that the product may be applied only by the methods specified on the labeling, (4) mixing a pesticide or pesticides with a fertilizer when such mixture is not prohibited by the labeling, (5) any use of a pesticide in conformance with section 5, 18, or 24 of this Act, or (6) any use of a pesticide in a manner that the Administrator determines to be consistent with the purposes of this Act. After March 31, 1979, the term shall not include the use of a pesticide for agricultural or forestry purposes at a dilution less than label dosage unless before or after that date the Administrator issues a regulation or advisory opinion consistent with the study provided for in section 27(b) of the Federal Pesticide Act of 1978, which regulation or advisory opinion specifically requires the use of definite amounts of dilution. \"\n\nIs there a required permit/process for an applicator to use, or a dealer to recommend the use of, a pesticide in accordance with FIFRA Section 2(ee)? (LC06-0036)\n\nThere is no required permit or process to obtain or undergo in order to use a product or recommend use of a product under Section 2(ee)(1)-(5) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).\n\n9. Existing Stocks\n\n40 CFR 152.130 and the Existing Stocks Policy (56 FR 29362) create a general 18-month period to distribute or sell products with existing labeling following approval of a voluntarily amended label. Frequently EPA’s approval of the voluntarily amended label will direct the registrant to use this newer language at the next production or within 18 months. New production after the 18-month window requires that labels use the newer text. However, in many instances certain states (CA/NY) may take significantly longer to approve the newer text. (LC07-0094)\n\n40 CFR 152.130 discusses distribution under approved labeling. The Existing Stocks Policy further elaborates on the requirements of 40 CFR 152.130. If labeling is amended on the initiative of the registrant, the registrant may distribute or sell under the previously approved labeling for a period of 18 months after the approval of the revision. The Agency may alter the time period for distribution or sale under the approved labeling in which case the registrant must comply with the EPA mandated time frames.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nCan registrants continue printing older version label language (at the next production but within the 18-month window) until the newer label text is approved by CA and/or NY?\n\nA registrant may distribute or sell a pesticide under previously approved labeling until the 18-month time period has expired. After 18 months the pesticide must bear the newly registered labeling. The 18-month time frame is independent of state registration status of a product.\n\nCan registrants continue printing older version label language after the 18-month window if the newer label text has not yet been approved by CA and/or NY.\n\nRegistrants may not continue to label products with old labels after the 18-month period regardless of the registration status of the product in a particular state.\n\nDoes the term \"new production\" refer to the production of the label or the production of the pesticide product.\n\nThe term “new production” generally refers to production of the pesticide product. If the new label cannot be printed in time to coincide with new production of the pesticide product and the production is within the 18-month time period, old labels may be used, however supplemental or sticker labeling bearing the newly approved labeling must be used after the 18-month date to bring the product into compliance.\n\n40 CFR 152.130 and the Existing Stocks Policy (56 FR 29362) create a general 18-month period to distribute or sell products with existing labeling following approval of a voluntarily amended label. New production after the 18-month window requires that labels use the newer text. Must the new label text be employed at retail bulk sites after 18 months, even if the manufacturer has not implemented the new label for non-refillable packages because no new manufacturing of the formulation has occurred since approval? (LC06-0060)\n\nRegardless of whether the registrant has engaged in new production during the 18 months, any new production after 18 months must bear the new amended labeling. Repackaging is considered production therefore pesticide product repackaged into refillable containers must bear the new amended labeling.\n\nWhen a registration is transferred, what is the existing policy for product labeling/produced in the \"old\" EPA registration number to be used up? (LC06-0009)\n\nGenerally, the new registrant may distribute or sell under the previously approved labeling for a period of 18 months after the effective date of the transfer. The Agency specifies the time period in its letters of transfer. See 40 CFR 152.130(c) and 152.135(e) or Chapter 15-2 of the Label Review Manual.\n\nWhen a product's registration is transferred from one company to another, e.g. Company A to Company B, what are the requirements for changing the product's labeling? (LC16-0942)\n\nWhen a product registration is transferred from Company A to Company B, EPA allows Company B to sell and distribute existing stocks of the product for 18 months. Existing stocks are stocks that were produced and released for shipment by the date of the transfer and therefore would bear labeling based on Company A's registration. Each container or package bearing Company A's labeling must be clearly and accurately marked with the batch number, lot number or other descriptive designation used to identify the product in Company B's records. After 18 months, if any existing stocks remain, they would need to be relabeled with Company B's labeling in order to be sold or distributed.\n\nAny product produced after the date of the transfer must bear Company B's labeling, including the new company name and new EPA Registration Number.\n\n10 . General Labeling\n\nIf we are not going to sell the product to a specific industry, do we still have to leave the claims for that specific industry on the label? For example, if there are specific claims for dentist, but we are not selling to the dentist - do we still have to include the dentist claim on the label? LC11-418; 7/7/11\n\nAll claims to be made for registered pesticide products must be submitted for review in accordance with FIFRA 3(c)(1)(C). Once claims are approved, registrants may choose from the approved claims, which will appear on the marketed product label. Claims may be omitted so long as the omission does not make the marketed label false or misleading. For supplemental distributors, there are limitations to what changes can be made to the approved label; however, regarding claims 40 CFR 152.132(d)(5) allows specific claims to be deleted from the product labeling provided that no other changes are necessary.\n\nRegarding anticoagulant rodenticides, such as (by a.i.) Bromadiolone and Difethialone. If labels do not specifically state that they can be used in food storage facilities or food processing plants, can these rodenticides be used under 21 CFR 110.35(c), which states in part \" The use of insecticides or rodenticides is permitted only under precautions and restrictions that will protect against the contamination of food, food-contact surfaces, and food-packaging materials.\" LC11-410; 5/19/11\n\nYou cannot use the pesticide at a food site unless it fits into one of the approved sites listed on the label and there is no restriction against it. It should be noted that on products labeled for indoor, commensal rodent control that include the food processing facility site, the following language should appear - \"Do not contaminate water, food, feedstuffs, food or feed handling equipment, or milk or meat handling equipment or surfaces that come into direct contact with food or feed. When used in USDA inspected facilities, this product must be applied in tamper resistant bait stations.\"\n\nWhat is the correct verbiage and placement on the label for expiration dates? LC10-0343; 6/3/10\n\nPesticides which change in chemical composition (e.g., the amount of active ingredient degrades so that it falls bellow the EPA-approved certified lower limit) must bear the following statement in a prominent position on the label: \"Not for sale or use after [date].\" 40 CFR 156.10(g)(6)(i). The agency requires this statement for products that cannot demonstrate one year storage stability in product chemistry guideline number 830-6317 for conventional pesticides and guideline 63-17 for antimicrobial pesticides. The product must meet all label claims up to the expiration date indicated on the label. For placement of the statement, we recommend it be placed on the front panel, either immediately below the product name or ingredient statement.\n\nSee also Label Review Manual Chapter 5, Section VIII(a). Expiration dates may appear on labeling for other reasons. If they do, the correct wording and placement is determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nA label gives directions for use on Ornamental Turf Areas and lists specifically golf courses, cemeteries, parks, turfgrass, and other grass areas, but there is no indication or directions for use specifically on sod farms. There is also no strict prohibition against using the product on a sod farm. Can this product be used on a sod farm? LC10-0319; 6/3/10\n\nThe Agency treats sod farms as a separate use site from those on the directions for use list. Ornamental turf is not considered to include agricultural crop and sod farms are considered to be an agricultural crop. Since sod farms are not listed as a specific site for application on this label, and sod farms are not covered by the Agency's definition of ornamental turf, this pesticide can not be applied to sod being grown on sod farms.\n\nIs it true that the manufacturer's label on a CONSUMER (as opposed to agricultural, etc.) pesticide imposes a legal obligation on the purchaser to use the product only as directed on the label? LC10-0330; 4/6/10\n\nFIFRA sec. 12(a)(2)(G) makes it a violation of federal law for any person \"to use any registered pesticide in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.\" All registered pesticides, including registered consumer pesticides, must bear the statement:\n\n\"It is a violation of Federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.\" 40 CFR 156.10(i)(2)(ii).\n\nSection 2(ee) of FIFRA provides limited exceptions to what is considered \"in a manner inconsistent with\" labeling. For instance it is not a violation to use a pesticide at a rate lower than that specified on the label unless the label specifically prohibits deviation from the specified rate.\n\nWe recently are putting together a label for supplemental distribution. The primary registrant is telling us to avoid using any parentheses on our label (even though theirs has some). Our particular statement where we use parentheses is dosages. We typically state use x to y ppm (a to b gals per 1000 gallons). Where a and b are simply converted values of x and y. Is this wrong? LC10-0323; 4/6/10\n\nIn general, EPA allows the use of parentheses on a label unless: 1) the parentheses are used in such a way that the labeling becomes false and/or misleading or 2) the use of the parentheses causes confusion making the directions for use inadequate to protect human health or the environment. The example you cite where you provide correct ppm information to the user based on the rate on the label would generally be an acceptable use of parentheses on a label.\n\nPlease note, however, that the label of a distributor product must be identical to the master label of the parent product, except as provided in 40 CFR 152.132(d). A supplemental distributor may not present statements in parentheses on a label unless the master label of the parent product also contains the same statements in parentheses. Further, the supplemental distributor may not delete statements in parentheses that appear on the parent product's label unless they involve one of the changes allowed in 40 CFR 152.132(d).\n\nWhat constitutes a label's \"front panel\"? LC10-0321; 4/6/10\n\nThe front panel is generally regarded as the part of the label that is (normally) visible to the user, consumer, etc. when the product is in a retail environment. At a minimum, the front panel must contain the following information:\n\nRestricted Use Product statement (if applicable)(40 CFR 156.10(j)).\n\nProduct Name, Brand or Trademark (40 CFR 156.10(b)).\n\nIngredient Statement (unless permission is granted to place it elsewhere due to impracticability) (40 CFR 156.10(g)(2)).\n\nKeep Out of Reach of Children Statement (40 CFR 156.60).\n\nSignal Word (40 CFR 156.64).\n\nFirst Aid (or referral statement if First Aid is allowed on other parts of the label) (40 CFR 156.68(d)).\n\nSkull & Crossbones Symbol and the word Poison (if applicable) (40 CFR 156.64(a)(1)).\n\nIn addition, generally the net weight or contents also appears on the front panel. See Label Review Manual Chapter 3, VII.\n\nDevice labeling: 40 CFR part 152.500 makes the labeling requirements of Part 156 applicable to Devices (Ultraviolet light systems or ultrasonic devices). However, nearly all Part 156 requirements are phrased as applying to 'pesticide products' (not Devices), and otherwise are logically applicable only to substances, not devices (e.g., requirements tied to chemical concentrations and toxicity values). Has the Agency issued guidance concerning which of the detailed Part 156 requirements are intended to apply to Devices, or the Agency’s expectations concerning how those requirements would be applied to Devices? LC10-0324; 3/11/10\n\nThe Agency has not issued guidance on what specific 40 CFR Part 156 labeling requirements must be on device labels. However, some of the labeling requirements include but are not limited to that the device:\n\ncannot bear false or misleading information;\n\nmust bear the number of the registered EPA Establishment where the device was produced; and\n\nmust bear adequate directions for use and warning or caution statements to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on the environments.\n\nMy question is in regards to shipping containers and the labeling of them. For example: A company produces a pesticide product that is put into a container for sale. This container is labeled per FIFRA requirements using the most recent EPA stamped accepted label. These containers are then placed in a cardboard box, whose sole purpose is to provide for ease of transporting the product. Once the box is received at the final destination, it is either put into stock until a pesticide container is needed or the pesticide containers are removed from the box and placed into use. Given this scenario:\n\nDoes the box need to have the same exact labeling attached to it as the containers inside? Again, the box serves no other purpose except for transporting the pesticide containers.\n\nAre there any restrictions/requirements for the labeling on the outside of the box (e.g. Product name, company name and contact information, number and quantity of containers)? LC10-0322; 3/11/10\n\n40 CFR 156.10(a)(4)(i) states that: “The label shall appear on or be securely attached to the immediate container of the pesticide product.” The regulations go on further to state: “If the immediate container is enclosed within a wrapper or outside container through which the label cannot be clearly read, the label must also be securely attached to such outside wrapper or container, if it is part of the package as customarily distributed or sold.”\n\nIf the pesticide product is customarily removed from the shipping container prior to being distributed or sold to the retail purchaser, the shipping container does not have to bear the full product label. If the shipping container is the unit which is customarily distributed or sold to the retail purchaser the shipping container must bear the full product label. Even where the shipping container is not required to bear the full product label, any information on the shipping container is labeling, and labeling that is false or misleading would be in violation of FIFRA. While the regulations do not specify particular labeling for shipping containers, the Agency recommends that the shipping container be labeled with enough information for emergency personnel to be able to identify the material in the shipping container in the event of an accident or spill. Be advised that DOT requirements may require labeling of the shipping container depending on the characteristics of the material being shipped.\n\nIs there a regulation that specifies that only an EPA-registered establishment can affix \"stickers\" to its pesticide labels? LC09-0303; 12/10/09\n\nAffixing a sticker to a container is considered labeling and therefore production as defined in 40 CFR 167.3. 40 CFR 167.20(a)(1) requires any establishment where production occurs to be registered. Affixing a sticker must take place in a registered establishment.\n\nWhen active ingredients, manufacturing-use products or end-use products are being imported into the United States and the proper U.S. labeling is present, are these products allowed to have other country or international labeling on the product container as well? (LC06-0034)\n\nGenerally, to be sold or distributed in the United States, a pesticide must be registered and must be labeled in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 156. The label (all written, printed or graphic matter on, or attached to, the pesticide) and any other labeling (written, printed or graphic material which accompanies the product or is referenced to on the label) may not be misbranded (e.g. false or misleading) as set forth in FIFRA section 2(q)(1)(A) and 40 CFR part 156. Labeling language that is in addition to that required by FIFRA and its implementing regulations may be allowed if it is not false or misleading. Therefore, so long as the international labeling is not false or misleading, or otherwise causes the pesticide to be misbranded, it may be allowed on a product container (or accompanying the product) in addition to the U.S.-required labeling. Determining whether specific international labeling would be allowed requires a case-by-case comparison of the U.S. label and the international label.\n\nSome pesticide products have a container label and a booklet containing the directions for use attached to the container. The EPA Label Review Manual spells out the requirements for the container label but it does not specify requirements for the booklet. What are the minimum requirements for booklet labels? Do they need to have the EPA registration number? What other information must be included in these booklets? LC06-0068\n\nThe booklet is considered “labeling,” defined in part as: “all labels and all other written, printed, or graphic matter (A) accompanying the pesticide or device at any time; or (B) to which reference is made on the label or in literature accompanying the pesticide or device.” FIFRA § 2(p)(2). Labeling must meet the requirements of 40 CFR Part 156 and must not be false or misleading.
